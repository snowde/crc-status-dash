Iulian T.,"Somerville, MA",26,27,4,4.0,11/4/2012,"We check in for a late brunch and we had good service, food was great, I went for the energy breakfast that took a little longer to be served, but the Belgian waffle make up for everything, was unexpectedly good. Server was pleasant, but his uniform was way too wrinkled and his white shoes not exactly white, originally they were meant to match the white uniform, but at this state were just worn. Also we had to wait a bit more to get the check. Beyond that we had a great experience for brunch!"
Karen D.,"Watertown, MA",27,310,24,3.0,1/1/2011,"I've been here a few times when I was on a mall jaunt, but only when there wasn't an insane wait. I prefer to eat in the bar area. Yes, it's a chain, but the food is consistent and if you have navigated the menu, you know what to pick for your palate, you can get a pretty decent meal. I have always found the staff to be professional and pleasant in any Cheesecake Factory, but there is one bartender here who is really rough around the edges. She had the finesse of Carla from Cheers without the wit. Approaching the bar she barked, ""Are ya's going to be eatin!"" No pleasantries like ""hello."" The entire meal she was abrupt, didn't smile, and her ""warm"" demeanor seemed to be a standard with all customers. Maybe she was the only one they could find to work the day after Christmas, but if you're taking my holiday money, you gotta show me some holiday cheer. I'm sure I'll go back there when I'm at that mall again, but if she's running the bar, I'll be giving it a pass."
Eric L.,"Seattle, WA",7,38,,2.0,5/26/2013,"Unprofessional staff. Server ignored us basically the whole night except to take our orders and give us the check. When we walked past her, she was texting on her phone."
Michelle J.,"Boston, MA",92,51,1,2.0,2/19/2012,"For some reason, the Cheesecake Factory chain has built up a good amount of hype for itself--particularly amongst out-of-towner suburbanites.  If it weren't for my family's love of this place, I'd probably never have stepped foot in here a second time.   TCF tries to be all things for all people, and herein lies its main failure.  It is a jack of all foods, master of none.   In no way is it necessary for a menu to be 15+ pages long.   While I appreciate my ability to order a Thai lettuce wrap, a fried macaroni and cheese ball ""Glamburger"" (WTF is a GLAMBURGER? WTF are fried mac n' cheese balls?), Baja chicken tacos, BBQ salmon, etc. all from the same place, I am overwhelmed and even turned off by the sheer number of choices.  After all, if the cooks need to maintain that huge of a repertoire, how are they possibly going to do them well?  There is a very good reason why the best of the best restaurants only offer a few items on the menu.  I'm not saying TCF has to be best of the best, but some restraint would be welcome.  Even more of a turn-off than the long menu are the full page advertisements on every other page of said menu.  Cheesecake F. presents itself as a classy date gig--but it really isn't that classy to pick out your Chicken Madeira while simultaneously discovering the best place to get hair electrolysis.  Stay classy, TCF.  You really know how to set the dining mood.  When you first arrive at TCF, you gather like hungry anxious cattle in the waiting area, hoping your table will be called sometime in the next century.  A 25 minute wait is not even the norm for a Friday/Saturday night--most of the time you are looking at waits upwards of 40-45 minutes.   But TCF will not take reservations, either, so really the only time it makes sense to come here is when nobody in your party is actually hungry.  Gee, that makes a whole lot of sense.   I don't have much to say about the food itself except for every meal I've ever ordered here requires a heavy dose of salt and pepper before it actually starts to taste like food.   You would think the cheesecake factory's one redeeming quality would be its cheesecake.  But alas, even the cheesecake kind of sucks at the Cheesecake Factory.  Again, too many options and they all basically end up tasting the same.  You can almost  taste the conveyor-belt uninspired uniformity of every slice.  I dare say that the frozen cheesecakes in the grocery store satisfy my cheesecake cravings more.   One star for the whole wheat bread, which is the only thing I've ever actually enjoyed here, and one star for the dish presentation which showed some attention to detail.  That's as generous as i can be.   One last thought--when I go to restaurants like TCF, which are notorious for having 1200 calorie + entrees, I typically look for something that might count as ""lighter fare.""  TCF has this really embarrassing way of highlighting all the low-cal options on its ""Skinnylicious"" menu. OK, just because I'm trying to eat healthier doesn't mean I like to shout over the din that I'd like to order the ""Skinnylicious grilled salmon.""  Between the ""Glamburgers"" and the ""Skinnylicious salads,"" i'm starting to think that Paris Hilton inspired this menu."
Jace F.,"Allston-Brighton, MA",2,38,,3.0,12/1/2010,"I've been to the cheesecake factory a few times, and every time I order the same thing, the thai lettuce wraps. This is an appetizer, but is big enough to feed a small family. really delicious and fun to make each individual lettuce wrap myself. I would love to keep coming back :) I would also love if CCF looked into the green restaurant association's certification. They list all of the certified green restaurants in Boston.. and the isshy thing is that there really are too few certified green restaurants in this city. Could the Cheesecake Factory be the next on the list?! I think it could be =)"
Joshua M.,"San Diego, CA",204,1480,170,3.0,9/5/2012,"We got in and out pretty fast for a Cheesecake Factory, and our service was good.  The food is always consistent, it's just these restaurants are so damn LOUD.  It's pretty difficult to have a conversation or really relax.  The orange chicken I had was pretty decent, but definitely not healthy."
Meka A.,"San Francisco, CA",589,66,5,3.0,2/18/2013,"As the name suggests, this place is famous for its cheesecake. The place has an endless selection of delicious cheesecakes.  They do have food though, and lots of it.  Cheesecake factory has a HUGE menu with everything from Salads and sandwiches, to seafood and Chinese food, to Mexican and traditional American fare.  The entrees are also GIGANTIC. I can throw down a lot of food in one meal and I still can never finish an entire entrée from this place. Despite the wide selection on the menu, cheesecake delivers a solid dining experience. My favorite dish is the Chicken Marsala followed up with the Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert.  It might be 1500+ calories but its worth each one."
Terrance W.,"North Kingstown, RI",5,29,6,2.0,8/31/2014,"The service was good and the servers were very nice. And we didn't wait a long time for the server. It was 3 of us and we ordered 2 appetizers, the waitress brought out 1 and we also ordered a extra drink, that she didn't bring out, instead she brought out our food so we ate and ordered our dessert to go. When I signed the check and included my tip to come off my debit card, she brought it back because I didn't leave the ""suggested gratuity"" her words where ""was the service ok? Because I gave you a paper with the amounts and you pick from those 3 because that's how I get paid"" I'm sorry but that is very unacceptable because I've been a waitress before and anything is better than nothing and it wasn't like I left her a 2-3 dollar tip. So I took the receipt back and started to put 0.00 but I instead I left it at what it was. Now I would've left more BUT I never received 2 things that I clearly ordered and she wrote down."
Ajit S.,"Cambridge, MA",0,4,,1.0,6/13/2012,One of the pasta dishes ordered was microwaved. The plate itself was piping hot and pasta was cold and rock solid.  Even other stuff was nothing spectacular. Typical commercial chain food albeit with decent ambiance and hefty price tags. One should not be surprised given the menu is as thick as a macro-economics textbook and restaurant has huge seating area. The chefs cannot be anyone else but a bunch of microwave experts. The wait was also very long.
Mary G.,"Cambridge, MA",346,101,4,2.0,11/3/2010,"I will be up front, did I expect to like the Cheesecake factory?  Not really.  However, a friend of mine was visiting from out of town and aside from being gluten intolerant she is also the pickiest eater I have ever known: I asked her if she had ever consumed a whole, cooked bean the answer was ""Not since I was old enough to say 'no'.""  My friend was hoping to eat something that wasn't just white rice and diet coke, though, and who am I to deny her that? So yeah, I was left to choose from places like TGIFridays, Ruby Tuesday's, etc.  Kind of a Hobson's Choice if there ever was one.  I went with Cheesecake Factory, kind of grimly curious to see the substance behind stories of 1500 calorie salads and deep fried macaroni.  The environment was more cavernous than I expected, and about as bright as as one too.  At one point during dinner the lights inexplicably became quite bright, then faded back to dimness.  The decor was kind of odd to say the least, we couldn't decide if it was faux-Egyptian, Mayan, Roman, or other. One friend and I split the fish tacos and the Clubhouse salad.  The picky friend got the chicken medallions.  The white fish on the tacos were surprisingly good, but the tempura batter had a taste of rancid fry-oil aftertaste.  The tacos became tastier when we added some ranch dressing to them.  They also came with a somewhat bland side of dirty rice and beans, in a cast iron dish.  At 14 dollars for 4 tacos, however, I was not impressed. The Clubhouse Salad was not the disgustilicious dish I was hoping for but was rather a decent salad with a rather odd addition of cubed cheddar in addition to the cheddar shreds.  Regardless, the salad was kind of decent, in no way seemed healthy, but left us full (it was apparently only about 1100 calories).  The picky friend's dish was, after her requested alterations, a large pile of white rice and 3 or 4 pieces of plain grilled chicken, plus an order of diet coke, of course.  She seemed satisfied. The service was perfectly fine, diet coke refilled, and it was explained the gluten-free menu was currently unavailable this week but would be back soon. I, however, will gladly not return for mediocrity at best, not when The Helmand is right around the corner... or a mall food court."
Stacy R.,"Bellevue, WA",50,38,,4.0,4/26/2010,"Synopsis: Huge selection, strong drinks, pleasant wait staff As with all Cheese Cake Factory locations, the menu is huge, think 20+ pages.  We love going here as many of our friends are picky eaters and with this menu there is something for everyone!  We have gone on very busy evenings and only once have we had to wait more than ten minutes for a table. The food is sometimes awesome (The Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp is my fave!) and sometimes just ok.  Not sure what type of fish they use in their fish tacos, but I wouldn't recommend them. Occasionally they have Cream of Mushroom soup and it's fantastic! The drinks are tall & very often strong.  The waitresses are very friendly and the service is usually quick.   Conclusion: We go here probably once a month & it's almost always excellent!"
Dillon J.,"Boston, MA",18,3,,5.0,12/3/2012,"Went with my friend for dinner on 11/16/12 and had the best experience, all due to our waitress. We had Yashanna R. and she really made our experience worth while. She went out of her way to make sure that all of our needs were met and satisfied. She told us to be honest and tell the truth because if we don't let her know then she doesn't know how to fix a problem. This was the first time a waiter/tress has ever said this to me and I believe if all waitstaff asked this question everyone would have a great time when they go out to eat. I love Yashanna and will be requesting her when I go back!"
Camille R.,"Los Angeles, CA",207,427,515,1.0,2/22/2012,"1.) As a new Yelper, I try not to review these big box joints because everyone knows about them and can make their own judgement about whether or not they're going to eat there. 2.) I really don't like this place and I don't know why I keep going back!! That all being said, the food is good and pretty consistent among the 3 or 4 different stores I've been to. The prices are outrageous and definitely not worth it. The cheesecake is just okay. I've had so much better and I hate that they have so many to choose from. As a matter of fact, I hate that the menu is as large as it is. It's annotying to have to flip through so many food choices and a lot of them look the same. The service... I've actually decided to write this review because of my last experience here. I came with a group of maybe 10 or more and everyone ordered a lot of food. Our server was nice though she left us hanging for awhile - be it to take our order, bring our bread, refill water, ask how we're doing, etc. She was nice to us and I know large groups can get crazy. Our entrees were starting to come out and the guy bringing them out was the biggest dick I've ever seen. He came over and screamed with an attitude that the plate was hot so don't touch it, okay?! Condesendingly he said, 'okay?!' again. As we were trying to make room for our food, he was yelling that we had to move more plates out of the way if we wanted our food, he rolled his eyes, snarled, yelled about moving more things out of the way, and slammed things down onto the table. As one of my friend's was moving a plate, he sntached it out of her hand and moved it himself.  I really wish I had said something, but I was having a good time with friends and didn't want to ruin our evening. As I was driving to the restaurant, I saw this guy smoking near the loading dock  on the side of the mall and thought about how disgusting it was to see him smoking right on the street. I knew he worked there from the white gear (anyone know why they have to wear ALL white?? That's gross, too) and hoped he wouldn't be our server. You'll usually find me here when large groups want to eat here and I don't really have a say. What a shame. I really can't stand Cheesecake Factory."
Mike H.,"Peabody, MA",13,59,,2.0,11/19/2010,"I got Chicken and Biscuits. The potatoes were OK, the gravy was meh, the chicken itself was mediocre and the biscuits were crap. I got food poisoning after eating here, but the other people in my party did not. We shared appetizers so I can only assume it was the chicken and biscuits. But as I don't have conclusive evidence I can't accuse them of causing my illness. I can accuse them of having mediocre food, crappy decor and a beer list with only two reasonable beers."
Nola P.,"Elmwood, LA",1,44,,3.0,9/20/2014,My husband and I love the Cheesecake Factory. We never had a bad experience at this location. Would recommend.
Emily D.,"Quincy, MA",251,394,942,2.0,3/16/2010,This location of the cheesecake factory bothers me sooo much. The service is always slow...yes there's always a wait for a table.. but an hour and 45 min wait. That's pretty ridiculous...especially when I know that when I finally sit down.. the food will take at least another half hour to come out. I prefer to just go straight to the cheesecake counter and order it to go.. I'd prefer to eat dinner some place else.
C N.,"Cambridge, MA",0,4,,1.0,8/12/2013,"The food is generally good here, but lately there seems to be a problem with the food and also the service is slow. the restaurant was not that busy, so  It should not take 30 minutes to get a burger and the salad was wilted too which was not edible. The manager came by to apologize, but it felt more like  lip service and vacant. Didn't seem to really understand.  It's too bad really, this place could under if they don't get it together and fast too."
erica c.,"Boston, MA",762,194,96,3.0,11/30/2006,"For a food chain, this one is damn tasty.  When my lunch appointment informed me that this is where we would be dining, I cringed.  I would rather eat at a local hole -in -the -wall then a chain restaurant(except outback...i love the sweet potatoes) but seriously folks, I was largely mistaken and pleasantly surprised. My chicken Thai thingie lettuce wraps were fresh, full of flavor and out of this world. I would def. go back for a safe and affordable lunch date."
Jim C.,"Redwood City, CA",150,1366,711,2.0,9/2/2007,"4 stars for the food and value minus 2 stars for crappy take out phone service. Good food and nicely sized portions, but service is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get. (Calling) ""Hi, can I place a take out order?""  ""Hold on. Let me forward you."" (Click. Hangs up on me.) (Calling again) ""Hi, can I place a take out order?"" (different girl) ""Hold on. Let me forward you."" (Puts me on hold for 5min with no one answering. I hang up. ) (Calling again) ""Hi, can I place a take out order? You've already hung up on me and put me on hold for 5 min"" (Click. They hang up on me accidentally again. Or intentionally.) Now, I REALLY wanted Cheesecake Factory so decide to try again. Otherwise I'd tell them to go to hell. (Calling again) ""Hi, can I place a take out order? You've already hung up on me twice and put me on hold for 5 min"" (After 1 min wait, I finally get through and she's actually nice.) Bottom line: I like their food a lot but PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR INCONSISTENT SERVICE!!"
Johan P.,"Falsterbo, Sweden",8,9,,1.0,10/1/2014,"Bin there a few times now, but getting tired of the long wait. An entrée takes between 35 and 45 minutes. New excuses every time. Won't come back."
