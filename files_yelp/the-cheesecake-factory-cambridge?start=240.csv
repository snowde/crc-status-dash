Jane Z.,"Cambridge, MA",0,73,,3.0,6/14/2013,"Lots of great food, and I really like the setup of this particular location. Very nice for dining with family and friends, so I highly recommend them. Great overall!"
Peachy L.,"York, United Kingdom",6,41,2,2.0,2/24/2010,"I love the cheesecake factory. My boyfriend has always hated it though and now I agree he truely has a reason why.  We went in today for lunch ( he brought me to make me happy) but probably will never go back.  We got our food (mine was fine) he got a baked potato soup. He thought he didn't feel good because we hadn't ate till almost 3pm and went outside for air. When he came back in he started in on his soup again. Not a minute after he was holding his water glass up over his mouth. I yelled "" if you're going to throw up run to the bathroom!"" and he did.... And he puked. That was the signal to leave so we got our salads to go and left.  When we were there he made it very well known he has a severe apple allergie and asked for his salad with out it. The waitress assured us that there would be no apple in his chopped salad. Just now we dig into our leftovers. We had asked for dressing but were given none. He takes a bite and 20 seconds he starts coughing and runs to the sink. What was in it??? APPLE. So for the last ten mins he's been drinking milk and has taken benedryl. Luckily it was only one bite. One more and we could be heading to the er right now. His allergy is so severe that his throat can close.  We both work in the restaurant industry and know there are allergy alert buttons  on the computer systems and also it can be grounds for termination if your carelessness causes someone a severe allergy attack.  Needless to say nice waitress or not we will never be going back."
Alain T.,"Orange County, CA",141,364,921,1.0,10/1/2012,"The review is based strictly on the service.  My hotel happened to be across from this restaurant and decided to eat here on our first night. I've been to other Cheesecake restaurants in the past and their food has always been consistent and above average. However, the service in this restaurant is horrendous. The waiter has no business working here as he completely lacked customer service skills. He completely ignored our party for most of the night. Never came for refills, kept forgetting what we had ordered for dinner. Acted completely aloof and generally a total ass to our party. Terrible job and definitely lost my business my next visit in town."
David Y.,"Waltham, MA",91,453,3,2.0,8/9/2010,"What can be said about this place that you don't already know?  Unimaginative food.  Big quantities (except for the green chile burger I got) and average or below average quality.  My green chile burger I would call smaller than expected and lacking flavor, even with jalapenos and chipotle mayo.  For $9, was on their cheaper side of the menu but I didn't really want to come here in the first place.  I got a tall $7 beer but it still made for a disappointing meal.  Service was generally fine but I could see how they could be slow if there were more than half packed full."
Jamie B.,"Boston, MA",153,8,6,1.0,12/5/2011,"I need to start off by saying OMG! Cheesecake Factory is not really my style, saying that my friend works at the galleria and we wanted to get a quick bite with a drink. This was by far the worst dinning experience I have ever encountered in all of my year... We walk in and no one is at the desk NO HOSTESS ON A SUNDAY NIGHT?!?! really we finally get seated and was not greeted for a good 17 minutes, I know because I texted the boo telling him where I was.. Finally I flag my waitress down and we try to order, she was confused to say the least. she wasnt sure if it was her table or not... We tell the waitress that we need to catch the 11 pm it was 9:30 when we had arrived in and now its 10ish.. so I order my tangueray with SODA water, she was confused she didn't know what tangueray was and couldn't understand I wanted SODA water and extra limes, I politely explained it was gin. my friend orders a strawberry Margarita.... so we wait... The drinks show up and I have NO LIMES and my drink is deff tonic and my friends drink is a Mango Margarita, I ask for some limes after we order a few smallplates we ordered  -fried mac and cheese balls -thai lettuce wraps  -a flat bread pizza She shows up flustered and with no limes saying she waiting for our food... so we wait.... I mean these are quick dishes why is it taken 30 mins when the place is dead? Some other waiter brings our food.. The food... -fried mac and cheese-the sauce under the mac balls was burnt,stuck to the plate.. *still good but not the best I have ever had -the flat bread pizza was burnt and dry *really, really?!?!  -Thai lettuce wraps were good so we waited for our waitress to come back and check up on us and she never did, we had to ask a busser for water refills... when she finally came back she said I know you girls are in a rush heres the check, after she presented it she asked about the food I told her we didn't really like the flat bread and she said well now you know what to not order next time and went on to talk about how amazing the mac balls were. I paid the bills and we finished eating because we stlll weren't done, she tried to clear the plates while my friend was still cutting her mac ball.. she brings back the bills and I sign and we are getting ready to leave and she comes running over flustered saying she needed my credit card again because she voided the Transaction, I handed over my card reluctantly and asked how i know I am not being charged twice, she said you aren't you will see on your statement..... but if you see your charged twice CCF will refund you REALLY!?!?!"
Beck N.,"Roxbury, MA",31,280,86,3.0,3/7/2010,"This place is pretty much exactly like every other Cheesecake Factory.  Typically I sit at the bar & while there is almost always a seat, I feel like I'm too close for comfort with my neighbors at the bar...& thus end up awkwardly bumping elbows with strangers. The food is decent here - haven't had anything I didn't like, but the pre-dinner bread is a bit dry.  Service has been OK,  but I've never had exceptional service."
Julie T.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,2.0,8/13/2014,"My boyfriend and I love coming here for the food.. Its always amazing! The service on the other hand is terrible.. We always wait atleast 5-10 minutes for a server to even say hi to us.. Followed by rushing us to order our drinks and food. Normally I wouldnt write a review but today our experience was terrible, which doesnt surprise us since every other times have been here it was the same way. All it takes is a few extra seconds to make your tables feel welcome."
Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1698,31,2.0,6/3/2010,"The menu is huge but that's about all I can say for this chain.  They offer quantity and variety but not exactly quality.  The cashew chicken was okay, but the rice was a bit soggy.  They forgot the cheese on the fresh vegetable salad...unless you count the 50 mg that I got in mine.  The pomegranate vinagrette that it came with was ultra tangy, almost too acidic.  The highlight of the meal was probably the bread basket and cheesecake.  The service was okay but our waitress wasn't very attentive although she was plesant when she did decide to drop by.  This gets 2 stars...just because I enjoyed the bread and cheesecake."
Kadin L.,"Boston, MA",15,59,96,2.0,7/20/2012,"I like The Cheesecake Factory as a chain restaurant, but no this one. I came here along with 7 of my friends, instead of Hooters, i know right....-__-.... I got the orange chicken with brown rice and its not the best that I've tasted. The chicken was too orangey and citrusy; very plain seasoning. I prefer and recommend the one at  The Prudential."
Omari C.,"Boston, MA",3,3,,4.0,2/22/2013,Nice service. One of of the problems that I have is the the waiting time because it can get busy but other than that I find it great.
Lynne C.,"Everett, MA",0,12,,3.0,1/2/2010,"OK, admittedly, I'm a plebeian who frequents chain restaurants. When the Factory first opened, I was young and impressed - quasi fusion dishes, seemingly funky decor... But now, the love affair has ended and even the once noteworthy cheesecake tastes chain-y. First, quite simply this place is overpriced (even if the rumors are true and they give diners 1 lb. & a 1/4 of pasta). 10 dollars for a slice of cheesecake? That's ridiculous. Go to an Italian community and buy a whole cheesecakefor the same price! Next, the food is TOO oily - I'm talking Paula Deen here folks!  I had the Evelyn pasta at Thanksgiving time, and some pesto dish right before Christmas. The Evelyn dish was bland and grease-filled. The pasta itself was a little too al dente and it appeared dessicated, as if had been under the warmer too long. The most recent time, with the pesto dish, there was so much oil that I had to put paper napkins in my plate to absorb the excess! Of course, I should have spoken up. However, the waiter walked by twice and blithely pretended not to notice. On a side note, there was a little verbal spat between two of the waitstaff. How gauche; they should have gone into the kitchen. Don't do it. Your money is better spent in the South End, or some quirky place in Allston/Brighton or Davis Sq."
Tom L.,"Derwood, MD",1,229,9,1.0,8/30/2011,"Yuck.  This location is way to busy and therefore dirty and out of control.  Dirty silverware.  Bathroom was a disaster.  To top it off, our waiter was REALLY strange.  A lot of customers were overheard complaining about long waits and wrong orders.  If you are at the science center or waiting for a duck tour, DO NOT walk over here - go somewhere else in the mall.  You'll be glad you saved the money."
Michele H.,"Cambridge, MA",10,84,,2.0,7/12/2010,"I've made a huge mistake. This place gets two stars in lieu of one purely because of their incredible Passion Fruit Mojito.  I don't feel incredibly rewarded, however, because the delicious drink put a $10 before tip dent in my wallet. Foodwise, I ordered two small plates--a plate of stuffed mushrooms, and a mushroom pizzette.  Yes, I love mushrooms.  I would eat mushrooms stuffed in mushrooms. When it arrived, the pizzette looked essentially like two slices of TOAST with cheese, sauce, and mushrooms on top.  It tasted even worse.  The stuffed mushrooms weren't too bad, but after consuming the meal, I felt the mushrooms evolved angry fists that were punching out the lining of my stomach. I can understand (though not appreciate!) getting sick after eating maybe a bad cut of meat.  But I ate MUSHROOMS!  Is their food so un-fresh that even the mushrooms can make you sick here? If I come back, it'll only be for a drink."
Brian G.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,265,20,3.0,11/21/2009,"I usually would give the Cheesecake Factory a 1 star but this was probably the best visit I've ever had to one. We were desperate because we were hungry after work and went here because California Pizza Kitchen across the hall closes at 9:30p and this place closes at 11p.  I hate the suburban-esque Orlando style they have here, but this time wasn't so bad- I gave them a 2. The service was great I have to say the waiter was very nice, accommodating, and gave me a to go cup of mint tea. The Louisiana chicken pasta was decent- the pasta and sauce was pretty good, but the chicken was fried, dry, and bland.  Overall, this was the best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I usually have a bad attitude coming in because i hate their mall style and tacky approach to food, but this brightened up my demeanor towards this chain just a tad."
Bram E.,"Iowa City, IA",3,47,1,1.0,4/18/2011,"I was going to give this Cheesecake Factory two stars, but I think on the drive home I may have thrown one of them up."
Dawn E.,"Somerville, MA",17,61,,4.0,1/23/2009,"I KNOW. Just hear me out.  I received a gift card, and it was a snowy Sunday and we felt like a walk and also some gooey, cheesy, abundance. All signs point to the CF. Helpful hint if you've never been there: it's a good idea to know what you might be in the mood for before you get there because the menu will overwhelm you and you'll order in haste and the whole enterprise will be roo-eened. Friends recommended the fried mac & cheese appetizer and I'm glad they steered me in that direction. What you get are four of these crispy, salty, creamy bombs of deep-fried artery busting food art arranged on a platter of better-than-average, eat-with-a fork-marinara. The were so rich I could only eat one, but they were just as good warmed up the next day. Also: nachos. I am very picky about my nachos, and I know I'm always risking disappointment when I order from a new place, but our server said they were good so we went for it. I must say, well played, Cheesecake Factory. Their 'chos are nothing fancy, just a solid example to show to places that insist on stacking up the dry chips. What is that? CF does the one-layer method, every chip enrobed in baked cheese, studded with jalapenos and served with a scoop each of guacamole and sour cream, plus salsa on the side. They're also quite voluminous.  The Cheesecake Factory does not boast an impressive beer list, but a 22 oz. Sam on draft suited my needs just fine.  Overall I'd be loath to come here on a weekend night, and I can't speak for the entrees or even the famous cheesecake, but for my appetizer-happy self everything was just right."
Matt P.,"Boston, MA",7,13,,2.0,4/12/2010,"The menu is humongous here - we had to reference dishes we were looking at by page number. I guess maybe you could use that to recommend to parties? I found it a bit overwhelming. Our table started off with some sliders. These tasted like your average, very thin, over-cooked hamburger with very few toppings. You can fill in the rest. I followed up with fish tacoes, which I had never had. The fish was cooked too long, so that it was hard to tell that it was fish, and the salsa was tasteless. I had a bite of my friend's cheesecake. The eponymous dish is, at least, pretty good. Still, not really my thing. It's not cheap, either."
Jenny S.,"Cambridge, MA",0,16,,2.0,3/31/2011,"My poor husband got food poisoning after eating at Cheesecake.  I usually try not to eat here, since it is overpriced for what it is.  But my pregnant belly had a strange craving for it.  Our server was nice, but he was obviously busy as it took him ten minutes to introduce himself and then another ten minutes to get the drinks."
Sara M.,"Boston, MA",92,507,5,3.0,9/3/2009,"I swear, EVERY mall in America has a Cheesecake Factory.  They apparently do not build malls without consulting this restaurant first. I used to live close to this mall so we would do our shopping and/or eat at this restaurant (maybe just get drinks).  For some reason, this place is ALWAYS crowded.  The food isn't even that great but perhaps there are no other restaurants close by...? I am not sure what road they were trying to go with the menu but they have almost every type of cuisine on there.  The Chinese chicken salad at 500 calories is quite filling and good.  The shepherd's pie was filling, savory, and enjoyable.  There was one dish that I had which was NOT good but I cannot remember (or chose to forget) what it was now. However, my favorite meal here is (surprise) the turkey club!  It is huge and has layers of deliciousness, like bacon.  The fries are also quite good and crisp.  I love clubs and this is probably one of my favorites.  The cheesecake is good - not great, but good.  The prices are expensive and a Grey Goose dirty martini can run you $12 or $14 apiece!  Also, this particular restaurant served me a Bloody Mary with a fly in caught in the celery - they comped it but gross. If you enjoy average Americanized fare and are not worried about price, this is your place."
Leeta W.,"Mattapan, MA",104,33,5,1.0,1/11/2009,"Don't blow a week of dieting and exercise on this place like I did. I actually planned for this meal and was really looking forward to it but was greatly dissapointed. BUFFALO BLASTS®  Chicken Breast, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing Fried mush. They were kind of like huge fried raviolis with what looked like miniscule bits of chicken inside...goo... with some kind of  cheese. They were VERY oily which made the mush inside even less pleasant.  AVOCADO EGGROLLS    Chunks of Fresh Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Deep Fried in a Crisp Chinese Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce The dipping sauce was the best part of  this. The filling had absolutely no flavor at all. There is no way that one could tell that it had the ingredients above in it. It tasted like an unripe avocado smashed into a friend eggroll shell.  THE FACTORY BURGER  Charbroiled with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions. Served on Sourdough French or Wheat Loaf with Fries This ended up being an over-priced, over-greasy, Big Mac! The THREE pieces of bread were the size of my head and the ""special sauce"" aka Thousand Island dressing was hard to even find. They gave me a side of it which helped but could not salvage the dry, tastless burgers, sandwiched between these gigantic greasy bread patties. I took off 2.5 pieces of the bread and ate 3/4 of the burger. Yuck. The fries were extra boring..no taste...just greasy and boring. GODIVA® CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE    Layers of Flourless Godiva Chocolate Cake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse this was ""okay"" but definitely not worth the calories or the price. Cheescake factor seems to have suffered the fate of many once ""classy"" restaurants. It's just a glorified fast food joint in my opinion. Oh well...you live you learn."
