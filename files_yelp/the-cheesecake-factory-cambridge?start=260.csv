Clay W.,"Milford, NH",0,53,29,1.0,1/4/2014,"Stay away from the Asian chicken salad. Weird tasteless dressing, taste like wet lettuce. Not happy with this place."
Eddie S.,"Boston, MA",0,43,1,3.0,5/29/2012,"The food is fine, but this place crowds you in like sardines in a can. The tables are too close together, reminds me of some places in the North End and like a few places where they actually sit you with strangers due to lack of seating. The noise level is bad stay away if you're not in a loud, talkative mood."
Becki W.,"Somerville, MA",367,141,4,2.0,7/31/2008,"Cheescake Factory as reviewed by a Math Geek 270 = minutes we had to wait for cheesecake (Thanks LeighAnn for suggesting that 2 hours of that wait be at Dante) 9 = bites it took to eat cheesecake 270 / 9 = 30 minutes we waited per bite of cheesecake $1.50 = cost of piece of cheesecake during anniversary special 1.50 / 9 = $0.18 per bite of cheesecake  (great deal normally, eh this trip) $8.95 = Cost of Georgia Peach @ Cheesecake Factory $12.00 = cost of Mojito @ Dante $20.95 = cost of alcohol this evening  $150.00 = session on couch with therapist to vent about cheesecake wait $150 - $20.95 = $129.05  (money saved by sanity-saving alcohol drinks) Epic Fail = 0 stars Major Success = 5 stars Paco the server = 1 star upgrade Georgia Peach = 1 star upgrade 5 stars - 2 stars = 3 stars lost in total  270 / 3 = 90 minute wait time for every star lost in this review 5 hours with awesome Yelpers = PRICELESS"
Barbara Ann B.,"Arlington, MA",124,21,2,1.0,8/1/2008,"I also lived through the ""Yelpers & The Cheesecake Factory"" ordeal, but I have a bit of a different story to tell.  I was so happy to find out that a Yelp event was happening on a Wednesday because that's the day that I have a sitter because I work late.  I finished up most of my work and hooked up with the crew at Cafe Rustica at the very end of office hours knowing that atleast some of us were heading to the Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake (and make quite a bit of it) and I have always loved the food at Cheesecake Factory.  So when we get there and there is an estimated 2 hour wait, I decide to go back to work while everyone is waiting to finish up and have them call me when our table was ready because I only work 10 minutes away. I go back to work and work for more than an hour, stop by Devon's to drop off some things that I had for her and the call from Ligaya comes that says that the table is almost ready. So I dart over to the Mall and I get a text from Becki saying that they are seated as I pull into the garage.   Cool, I have managed not to have to wait 2 hours for a table, my work was done so I can relax for a bit and hopefully get out of there within an hour or so and pick my son up in Roxbury by 11. How long could it take for them to serve pre-made, Pre-sliced cheesecake.  Some people ordered drinks, I think the table ordered one app total (at least that was all that I saw being brought to the table) but most of us just ordered cheesecake. I was told by my sitter that I could only stay out so late if I brought her back some cheesecake, so when I ordered I ordered one slice to go (at the regular price) and one slice for me to enjoy with my Yelp friends. After a while, I think at about the same time the app came to the table, a waiter came over with my to go slice of cheesecake. Cool, we will be served soon, right? After about 45 minutes of staring at my to go container of cheese cake, the Yelpers are wanting me to fork it over. But I can't, it's for Ann Marie!  I predict they have run out of cheesecake and they are waiting for the frozen cheesecakes to thaw before they serve us. So I decide to go over and find out what the hold up is and see if they can make my other slice of cheesecake to go also because I have to leave and pick up my son and it's already after 11. When I walk up, I see several people behind the counter with a few slices of cheesecake and not much happening. I ask what's going on and someone says, ""we are very busy and the only thing that people are ordering is Cheesecake and we are doing our best to get the Cheesecake out to your table"" I explained that I had to leave and was told that it would be out shortly.  One of the people behind the counter asked what I was waiting for so they could try to get it out first but the other woman cut her off and said ""They decided to have this big promotion today and we have 4 people working and all of these tables to serve, your food will be out shortly"" and I looked for the other woman who was trying to help get mine so that I could leave but she wasn't there anymore. I go back to the table thinking shortly, I can deal with shortly but we wait and wait and still no cheesecake. I am getting very annoyed because I know how long it takes to put a piece of cut cheesecake on a plate and put some whipped cream on it. If you have 4 people doing it, one person gets the cheesecake, one person plates the cheesecake, one person garnishes with whipped cream and one person makes sure the order is right and passes on to the server. There is no cutting involved, it doesn't really matter how many slices you have to serve in a night.  If you run out, go back to the table and say ""I am sorry, we have run out of the chocolate, can I offer you something else""  I hit my boiling point because I was too deep into it to just walk out empty handed, I was past the point of no return it is now almost Midnight and I want my $1.50 cheesecake!! Give it to me so I can leave!!! One of the yelpers gets up to go to the ladies room and comes back and says there's no TP, I stood up again and said that there will be TP in there shortly (because, damn it I have to pee too) and i get up to go tell one of the people that are standing around chatting, that they need TP in the ladies room but I was headed off by the woman who told me that our food would be out shortly.  She had two plates with cheesecake in her hand and she was walking in our direction and said ""it's coming, it's coming"" so I go sit down (funny, how l no longer need to pee so bad) and she walks right by our table, WTF! A few minutes later our cheesecake actually comes and I wolf down a few bites and throw the rest into one of my take out containers (I had two because they put the strawberries on the side) handed Becki some cash, said a quick Bye and Ran! I got to my son at 12:45, I was in Big Trouble! Thanks CCF!"
Marc C.,"Boston, MA",176,110,29,1.0,7/31/2008,"*UPDATE: Changed to 1 star, I refuse to credit them for our humor... ________ I apologize ahead for length, but it needed to be covered (I guarantee - my longest review ever). Here's some basic math equations for this visit: Entire experience - my fellow diners + time involved = EPIC FAIL! Entire experience + [my fellow diners + Visit to Dante's + time involved  (absurdity +lack of attentiveness +lack of manager response)] x booze x laughter = the only reason that this review gets 2 stars  OK , well that and the fact that I am unable to give a zero... Our group decided that we need to go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate National Cheesecake Day with $1.50 slices of cheesecake. You would think they would be prepared, but I digress... So we all arrive at the restaurant with a party of 16. We are given a quoted wait time (after an agitated sigh from the hostess- ever so welcoming) of 2 hours... no problem, expected... change the number to 12, quoted a wait time of 1 1/2-2 hours. The bar didn't have space for us, so we decide to skip (almost literally) over to Dante's across the street for fun, frivolity, and alcohol. The pager wouldn't work over there so our quick thinking leader gives a phone number to call us so we can relax in comfort (this isn't a review for Dante's so I'll skip that). After 2 hours we head back to CF and finally get seated at the 2 1/2 hour mark.  The server (Paco) was nice and friendly got the food and drink orders. Two more people showed while he is taking orders, no problem, the table next to us left and it was added. Took a little while to get the drinks, but no problem. My martini was room temperature and I did not get the side of rocks I requested... ok, larger group, I'll deal. So we ordered drinks, 1 appetizer, and 13 (that should have been an omen, guys) slices of cheesecake for here, 2 to go. Server comes back, they are out of the appetizer ordered- no problem, ordered a different Appetizer which came out in about 10-15 minutes. Then we waited... And laughed with each other and waited... The two to go slices arrive... And laughed with each other and waited (notice a pattern)... Look around, tables seated after us got their food and desserts... and all the servers are sitting around the front of the restaurant chatting away. Meanwhile no drink refills were offered and most of us ran out of water (those that did actually did have water poured some of theirs into their neighbors empty glasses). We actually felt we were not being attended to because the server knew the gratuity would be added to the party. One of us gets up and informs the manager of our situation as we sit in the near empty dining room. Server comes back, I ask for water refills, they are refilled within 5 minutes. And we laughed with each other and waited (at this point for over an hour)... Another member informs the manager we still don't have our cheesecake. Another server comes by and tells us there are only four people working in the dessert pantry (I have been in the business for 20 years and know that is insufficient for this night), OK, how about planning ahead?  And we laughed with each other and waited... Finally, after 1 hour and 25 minutes of being seated, the cheesecake arrives. Delirious to see the Holy Grail of our quest, we dig in... it was good, although two of them were still frozen, but we dealt with it. Besides the restaurant was nearly empty and they were mopping around us- bathroom trip and exit from restaurant included sliding feet-- how about clean water, wet floor signs, and waiting until guests leave next time). I did not order a second drink since I was already over it. We get the bill, nothing was adjusted, but the gratuity was still added (of course). It also would have been nice if the manager visited the table and at least acknowledged the problem. The kicker after we paid? The server (Paco) came over and confronting us about speaking to the manager and stated that she yelled at the servers in front of their gossip gathering. He also stated that they ran out of cheesecakes... hello... planning ahead? Or how about letting us know so we can select another instead of frozen ones? Summary thus far: 4 1/2+ hour cheesecake, good but not that good.  Second kicker? We got out so late the subway stopped running and the car was locked in the parking garage and we had to get a security guard zipping around on a Segway to let us out. So if you want to go next year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day, I suggest the following alternative- July is also National: July Belongs to Blueberries Month, Ice Cream Month, National Baked Beans Month (feel free to make the beans yourself from scratch- you'd still get them faster than the cheesecake...) As for me, next year, I may wait for 08 Aug and celebrate National Sneak Some Zucchini on Your Neighbor's Porch Night (I swear I did not just make that up) with the great people I dined with..."
Anonymous G.,"Cambridge, MA",0,16,1,1.0,2/9/2012,"had a burger, got stomach pain, never going there again - hey, it rhymes :) About two months later - It was late, for a pizza plate, I made mistake, went to cheesecake, now I have stomach-ache - Hey,I am getting good at it :)"
Aboud Y.,"Cambridge, MA",206,608,30,1.0,12/4/2010,All that is wrong about restaurants can be found at The Factory (even the name).  I always try to avoid at all costs.
Leighann F.,"New York, NY",3243,961,695,2.0,7/31/2008,"Recently added to my list of things that one should never admit in public: I waited a total of 4.5 hours to eat a $1.50 slice of cheesecake. From a chain restaurant. In honor of National Cheesecake Day. Before I hang my head i shame, I must say that the cost/benefit analysis of this experience was only positive because these 4.5 hours were spent with some fabulous yelpers and a bit of alcohol. Two and a half hours total waiting time for a table (which was spent sipping cocktails at Dante across the street) and another two hours waiting for the cheesecakes to arrive to our table!  I WISH I was kidding you. Now, I understand that this promotional deal probably caused quite the hullabaloo for the staff at Cheesecake and a table of fourteen threw just another wrench into the mix, but seriously...TWO HOURS for a slice of cheesecake?  Two hours when other tables that sat after us got their slices way before us? Two hours when your entire staff is standing up at the dessert counter goofing off and completely ignoring our table because we met the requirements for auto-gratuity and they were going to get their tip no matter what?! I assume that this corporate promotion was well planned and each chain was well-informed of this event long ago, so my question is how on earth are you not better prepared? Which in turn leads me to recall another list: Reasons why I do not frequent chain restaurants."
Ricky R.,"Austin, TX",38,13,,1.0,7/31/2008,"As all my National Cheesecake Day cohorts have already weighed in on the lengthy fiasco, I feel compelled to opine on the matter myself.  Also because I am told one must review something to be considered a ""yelper.""  But I digress.  On most days, Cheesecake Factory is not a single star establishment.  National Cheesecake Day is not most days. You might think that a factory which turns out cheesecake would be equipped to handle the wave of pilgrims on cheesecake's holiest of days.  You would be mistaken.  You might think that the departure of all the other restaurant patrons (having already been served and finished their meals) would cause your cheesecakes to appear.  Again, you would be mistaken.  You might think that that after being ignored for about an hour the wait staff would eschew sass in favor of a kind, conciliatory tone.  You would again be mistaken.  You might even think that they would throw in an extra slice or sing as song as though it were your birthday with the cheesecakes finally do arrive.  Sadly, you would be mistaken yet again. I won't get into the minutiae of the evening, as that has been more eloquently done by others, so I'll sum up my review as follows: Start with 5 stars for $1.50 slice of cheesecake, subtract 1 star for every hour it takes to get said cheesecake.  In our case, this leaves you with 1 star.  (If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt and not count the wait time for the table, then take off those other two stars anyway for their lack of compassion.) As mentioned elsewhere, the company of the yelpers and the merriment that was made was a 5-star affair.  The Factory had little to do with this, however, so they're still stuck with 1. Who'da thunk my first yelp would be such a burn?"
Christopher M.,"Concord, MA",271,541,15,2.0,7/31/2008,"My most recent experience at the Cheesecake Factory was with a dozen other Yelpers who seem to be covering every detail of the evening in excruciating detail, which means I get to write a brief review (for once).  Thanks guys! Every experience I've ever had with the Cheesecake Factory has involved waiting.  I don't know if they invented the little vibrating pagers, but they've taken their use to an almost sadistic level.  I used to work at a bookstore in a mall next to a Cheesecake Factory, and I guarantee that 60% of our sales during dinner time were from people waiting for their table at the Cheesecake Factory. Yes, the food is pretty good.  Yes, those avocado egg rolls are AMAZING.  Yes, some people have developed romantic relationships with the cheesecake.  But after my last visit involved  over four hours of waiting for a single slice of cheesecake, I think takeout is now the only acceptable form of dining at the Cheesecake Factory. EDIT: and I almost forgot, they were OUT of the egg rolls!  WTF?!?"
Chi N.,"San Francisco, CA",88,59,,3.0,7/21/2008,"So they say America is fat. But they also have many reasons why. Its the fast food. Nope, it's all the high fructose corn syrup. Nope, nope, it's the lack of exercise. Nope, it's the South and their chicken fried steak fried pork. But they'd all be wrong. Because I think I know why. After you wake up tomorrow, right before the stroke of noon, drive over to your nearest Cheesecake Factory or order something. Anything. And they'll ask you if you want a lunch-sized portion. Tell them no, hell no, what are you, a smelly European. Then after you get your lunch, finish every bite on the plate, and finish off with a signature slice of not-very-good cheesecake. Now, go home, it's hot outside, and take a nice nap. You'll need it after the long drive to the mall. Then repeat this process each day for a month. Don't worry, the Cheesecake Factory has over 20,000 different entree's to choose from. Their menu is so long they had to include advertisements. Then write to me documenting your weight and body shape changes after that month diet of Cheesecake Factory. Because I think I can confidently say, without a doubt, this place is solely responsible for  the energy situation, Global warming, the Iraq War, the economic downturn, China's taking over the world, Pol Pot, Hitler, American Idol, and every other affliction to hit this world in the twentieth century. And most of all, for America being fat."
Cory M.,"Sammamish, WA",91,41,,2.0,7/31/2008,"I also was at what I call ""the $1.50 Cheesecake fiasco""  A lot of you where there as well and have been writing about it, so I don't feel the need to go into great detail about what happened.  All I have to say is that in the time I spend waiting, I could have made my own cheesecake at home.   The only 2 things redeeming about this experience was a) the cheesecake, when it finally came, was amazing  and b) I got to spend it all of you fun and interesting yelpers:)"
John D.,"Cambridge, MA",55,109,117,3.0,8/10/2011,This place is always consistent but the portions are always on steroids.  I mean honestly 2 people can share most plates here.
Jen H.,"Somerville, MA",439,564,100,2.0,7/31/2008,"OMG, I don't think I've ever realized how insanely cheap I can be sometimes.... or how large my love of cheesecake is. I think both parts of my personality were tested last night when 11 other Yelpers, plus a few friends... ventured here for National Cheesecake day. Mind you, we get there... find out it's a 2 hour wait, and consider the possibility of just buying whole cheesecakes, and go out somewhere else to eat them. Roni and I check out the scene, but we quickly realize that a $45 cheesecake/12 = $3.75 per person.... and we want our $1.50 cheesecake damnit! So, by choice we keep our name down for the 2+ hour wait, head to Dante for some drinks (about $10 for one), and then head back to Cheesecake factory for our $1.50 slice ... which took for-ev-er to arrive. To the Cheesecake Factory for next years Cheesecake day - be more prepared. The lack of staff that you had on hand was highly disappointing. Next time, screw the $1.50 slice - which ended up costing me way more than the $3.75 when you throw in the alcohol at the other venue while we waited - I'll be down for getting the whole cheesecake and popping a squat for an impromptu picnic. The only bonus that was had for the long wait, was the fact that I got to laugh, pout, share stories with, and enjoy my time spent with some great ass Yelpers."
Matthew U.,"Arlington, MA",24,14,1,2.0,12/27/2013,"This is the worst Cheesecake factory and that is a pretty low bar. I have had to go here three times to meet friends (their choice). Slow drinks, slower food. when I have a lunch meeting I normally am on a time constraint. So a 1 to 1.5 hour lunch is a bit much. Not to mention they messed up the drinks all 3 times. Food is passable I guess. But for $70 for 2 people last time. I think we could have done better almost anywhere"
rachelle b.,"Boston, MA",0,11,,4.0,3/10/2009,"Sad to say, I've never had one of their cheesecakes, but let's cut to the point. Try not to go there on weekends because it gets really packed and the service is really slow. The scene is mostly college kids. The decor is pretty amazing. ...I'd say! Your day starts off by the waiter asking what you would like to drink, and if you don't already know what you want to eat prepare to be stuck looking at the menu for 20 extra minutes before he or she comes back to ask if your ready. I mean, the prices aren't that bad. Depends what your getting... The burgers are huge! My favorite was the bacon bbq cheesebuger ($10.98 if i can recall) My mouth waters from the thought of it .. ooh the delight!  Their meals are very quick to fill you up on an empty stomach. But I'd say very fattening...(not good for anyone on a diet) Only thing that I don't like about their burgers is the cheese. (sorta plastic for some reason)  But any who, the fries were great, and my waiter was so sweet I had to give a good tip. =-] I work at the mall so I've been in and out a few times, WARNING. ordering to go is the worst on weekends! On weekdays, if your here alone it's pretty relaxing. Not a bad place for an overall score of 4."
Jessica R.,"Lynnfield, MA",2,30,,1.0,2/27/2011,I bought my mother a 6 inch cheesecake for her birthday but I wasn't sure if she liked chocolate. So when I got home I told her it chocolate before she opened the box and she told me she hates chocolate-go figure? So she went back the NEXT day and returned it (unopened of course)and they charged my credit card TWICE.  I called the manager to complain about the second charge and they told me they couldn't reimburse me and that they would have to send me a check that would take 2 weeks to process...oh great.  Point is avoid this place if possible because they have no idea what good customer service is. I truly regret even stepping inside of this place.
Roni E.,"Waltham, MA",703,565,507,1.0,7/31/2008,"I will direct you to the last 8 2-star reviews from the other Yelpers who lived through the ""Yelpers & The Cheesecake Factory"".  All I can really add is that Roni gets a lil cranky, punchy, and fiesty after a lot of waiting and not having the ability to have another drink 'cause she's gotta drive. Classic case of ADHD.  For Fecks Sake I coulda MADE my own cheesecake for the amount of time we waited. While others may have felt it was worth the wait, IMHO I would have preferred to stay at Dante's and kicked back a few more drinks.  However, the company in which I was with was AMAZING!!!  *duck*duck*duck*duck* GOOSE!!!!"
Sana A.,"Carrollton, TX",119,31,2,3.0,6/17/2008,"Noontime, gettin' uptight. Where are you? I've been waitin', now it's quarter to two I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' your food. Hey, you, It's a fact they're talkin' in town. You're service sucks and you're always bringing me down. I'm not really upset; don't like lookin' like a clown. I think of your cheesecakes ev'ry night and day. You took my tummy, then you took my pride away. I hate myself for loving you. Can't break free from food that you do. I wanna walk but I run back to you, that's why I hate myself for loving you. April spent the month without you. But I've been dreamin' of the burgers you do. I won't be as angry 'bout the hell you put me through. Hey, man, bet you can treat me right. You just don't know the money you were missing last night. I wanna order and say forget it just from spite. I hate myself for loving you . Can't break free from your yummies at night. I wanna walk but I run back to you, that's why I hate myself for loving you. I hate myself for loving you. I think of you ev'ry night and day. First you took my taste buds, then you took my pride away. I hate myself for loving you . I know, it's a chain. The food is medicore. The service is terrible. I just can't quit it though. Perhaps it's because they are a block from my apartment, perhaps it's the cheesecake, perhaps its the fact that the servers wear all white and look like the pillsbury dough boy? I don't know. Either way. I hate myself for loving it. And frequenting it...time after time."
