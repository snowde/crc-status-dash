Brian C.,"Peabody, MA",47,36,12,5.0,5/27/2011,Wild mushroom soup(when a special) is amazing . . .  Follow it with Chicken Marsala and you can't go wrong
Nupur L.,"Houston, TX",240,269,15,4.0,6/27/2008,"Yeah, I give it four stars. Sue me, Yelp-inistas. It is what it is, which is appetizers large enough for a meal and some amazing chocolate..peaNUT BUTTER...COOKIE DOUGH CHEESECAKE. With a dollop of whipped cream the size of a small child's fist. The Cheesecake Factory is a monument to American excess from the decor to portions, numerous iterations of egg rolls and burgers and cheesecake that sits on a coconut macaroon crust with whipped cream and chocolate. How can you take it so seriously? If you're on a diet."
M B.,"Concord, MA",0,63,,4.0,6/30/2013,"Love the salads, tho remember the low calorie menu means different dressing only, FYI    The servings fill the plates with flavor and taste good. Skip the Vietnamese tacos as the soft tacos are tough to chew. The sliders were cooked as we requested and bread was fresh as well.  The shrimp appetizer was cooked perfectly though one or two more on the plate would have been perfect. The hostess lacked warmth but waiter David made up for her lack of it. He appeared to treat each table as though it was his only customers. his kindness remained evident the whole meal! Parking in the galleria lot costs a little bit, but heck, go to Macy's or Gap while you are there:)"
Mark M.,"Charlestown, MA",2,5,,5.0,8/6/2013,Really like the Cheesecake Factory. Staff are attentive and friendly. Large portions and extensive menu to choose from. We come here one/two times a week and have a great time with great food and atmosphere. The restaurant caters well for vegetarian and will customize any menu offering to that end - my wife is vegetarian.
Aamir M.,"Cambridge, MA",64,24,2,1.0,12/24/2012,This place blows. You tell them you want to do a party party with 14 people and they won't take a reservation. Show up and write your name down and you're told every 20 minutes to wait another 20 minutes. Ludicrous.
Natalie K.,"Medford, MA",4,71,,4.0,3/18/2013,"Always great tasting food, i've never had anything bad there, good service as expected at any chain. The cheesecakes are delicious. I highly recommend the avocado rolls as an appetizer and the  tuxedo or kahlua cheesecake."
Walter O.,"Cambridge, MA",0,2,,5.0,9/30/2011,"Lunch yesterday (9-25-11) for the thousandth time. Please don't ever change.  As always it was simply sensational.  Primarily I want to single out our server, Paula. You have a treasure there She made our day even more special. Congratulations.."
Orly M.,"Somerville, MA",320,280,1,2.0,10/2/2007,Ads on the menu?  No spank you.  It's like when you buy a Vogue and have to flip through 12 pages of ads to find the freaking articles and they suck anyway. Crowds of roudy teenagers?  No thanx. Always a wait?  Think I'll pass. Warm pumpernickel loaf?  I'll have some of that.  To go.
David A.,"Brooklyn, NY",379,684,63,4.0,10/29/2008,"Want a great deal? Come here 4-6 pm M-Fri and hit up the bar. Happy hour for food. The avocado egg roll and Spicy Ahi tempera were to die for.  Chicken Potstickers were eh. I'm not a huge fan of potstickers, so I figure I'm biased. Same goes for the spring rolls. The sliders were decent, but nothing to write home about. Neither were the lettuce wraps. Order 2 of the bar menu items and you'll be stuffed. 3 is probably just right for a couple. We ordered 4 and were in a food coma. If you want dinner, they serve past midnight, so they're great for a late night snack or dinner post party munchies.  The salads are good. The kobe beef burger was pretty good. The navajo sandwich was OK. The guacamole chips were amazing, but the salsa sucked. Can't go wrong with the tasty drinks.  The service is usually pretty good. The waiters/waitresses pay a lot of attention to you and are pretty friendly and chatty.  How to get there? Take the green line Lechmere train, 69 bus, or drive. There's street parking and INEXPENSIVE mall parking in the garage. Take a romantic stroll by the Charles before or after. It's pretty.  Want to avoid the crowds? Come here late at night."
Kathy K.,"Cambridge, MA",10,81,48,2.0,12/18/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory sort of treds water, neither sinking nor advancing in my opinion rating every time I visit it.  I have never been there without one of three things being out of whack during that visit.  Here are the three areas that seem to take turns being an issue: 1.   I pick an entree that is better ordered at an actual Italian, Thai or other ethnic restaurant.  Ineveitably, I am sad as I have definitely had said dish better at the less expensive neighborhood joint.  In the worst case, I could swear the Lean Cuisine frozen version was better. 2.  Some member of the staff who happens to be somehow responsible for either seating, serving or bussing my table is confused, oblivious or on break.  If I am successful in picking a tasty entree, somewhere the chain of custody of my dining experience is broken. 3.  Lastly - but maybe the most damning factor that dashes my meal if 1 and 2 go well -- my fellow patrons are morons.  Maybe by choosing to dine in the mall I am welcoming this, but it still is just wrong. This restaurant has an alarmingly high rate of babies and kids stretched beyond nap time, really loud teenagers often using really loud profanity, and people that have more bags, strollers and assorted packages than their allotted floor space. All in all, it can be a really taste, convenient and good time, but it can also crash and burn pretty violently."
Tracee D.,"Seattle, WA",76,312,5,3.0,1/19/2007,"I mean no disrespect but if a chain restaurant is your favorite and its not addressed as your ""favorite chain restaurant"" its merely your fave...I don't know what the world is coming to. I heard great things about C.F. the hype was unreal...I thought it was a real restaurant. The menu is the Sears Wish book of menu's TMI for this lil lady. I can't handle it.  When I ordered a glass of crappy red zin, I got white zin and my server had never even heard of Zinfandel say what? I though corporate restaurants were training aficionado's. The salads are good.  The story on the menu about cheesecakes in a basement  blah blah blah, is the best part of this monster chain. This place is what it is: Average corporate-all over the place-restaurant-saurus-rex Went back last weekend...why? I wanted cheesecake. The service was great. Brandon our server was a doll. I had the green tea smoothie-soo good (better w/out honey) an endive and pecan salad and oreo cheesecake. the wait was forever long, but it was a standard experience. It is what it is. sometimes its better."
Debra L.,"Hingham, MA",346,539,6,3.0,11/20/2007,"Three words: Weight Management Salads. WTF?! What Marketing genius thought it wise to name their healthy salads ""Weight Management Salads"". Can anyone (especially those who might be in need of some weight management) feel good about themselves ordering something called that? Well, after having just gone on a world class eating binge in New Orleans, I was in need of some dietary management. So yes, I sheepishly ordered one of these salads and it was actually pretty good. Spicy chicken, black beans, lots of fresh greens etc. But, I couldn't really enjoy it. I was too pissed off that I was eating something called a ""Weight Management"" salad when I don't have a weight problem! I guess what really angered me the most was the fact that my 12 year old nephew (whose every rib is visible) ordered the ""Double Bacon  BBQ Cheeseburger, hold the lettuce"" and then proudly claimed ""and for desert I'm getting the Blackout Chocolate Cake"". Cheesecake Factory made me feel bad about myself BUT it made my nephew's night!"
Sandy W.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,18,,5.0,8/15/2011,We brought a small business group here and had a great experience! Thank you to the general manager and the rest of the staff--everyone is great and good at their jobs. The food of course is fabulous!
Ryan R.,"Beverly, MA",7,19,1,1.0,5/26/2007,"I actually like Cheesecake factory, as other people have said, chain restaurants arent normally my thing, but its ok.  This particular one though, awful.  It scored low in just about every category a restaurant can, wait staff, food quality / quantity, interior design, general company, any others I should mention? To start with the wait staff, they were completely ridiculous.  The waiter that we had among other things introduced himself three times, which I can understand maybe hes a little stressed, but I think we were the only people there that werent a) old, or b) swarming with children, so a little easier to spot.  Im pretty sure he introduced himself, we ordered drinks, then he came, introduced himself again, asked for our drinks again...and so on.  Another waitress woman we saw slinking by our table was carrying some plates to another table and proceeded to wipe her nose on her arm WHILE carrying the plates still. As for the food quality vs. quantity, all of the dishes are basically colored styrofoam in a pile with awful crunchy rice.  I ordered Orange Chicken that was in my opinion way too orange visually and taste-wise and piled high on top of some undercooked rice.  As for the edamame (soy beans), dont EVER order them, they were so overcooked the pods fell apart, for those of you who enjoy edamame, thats NOT supposed to happen! One quick last thing, the interior is a disaster, its like early Egyptian / Greco-Roman / Rennaissance / Baroque / Art Deco and a melange of other perhaps Cheesecake Factory-invented styles. Overall, awful! Dont go to this one, go to the one at the Pru, its way better and better general company, less crotchedy old ladies and less people with all manner of screaming youngsters."
Dachary C.,"Cambridge, MA",44,126,,4.0,5/24/2006,"Yummy food. Great drinks. Long waits. The Cheesecake Factory is a recent discovery for me, but one that I'm very pleased to have made. The first time I tried to go, I got turned off by the 45 minute wait to seat 1 and elected to leave. On subsequent visits, though, it was a pleasant experience. If you get there early (between 5-6) the wait isn't bad, even on a Friday night. On a weekend mealtime, though, waits are steadily long, so don't go if you're in a hurry. But if you get stuck waiting, you can always peruse the mall while you're killing time. Or use the time productively by reading the novel-length menu to start trying to decide what you want. An added pro: the bar is open seating, so start with a drink while you wait. Ahh, yes - the drinks. The Cheesecake Factory has a section of four ""Super Creamy"" signature drinks - I have now tried them all, and can safely conclude that they're all fantastic! If you've got a hankering for girly drinks, definitely try one. Warning, though: in the Flying Gorilla and the Strawberry Creamsicle, you can't even taste the alcohol - generally resulting in sucking them down far too quickly and going back for more. I find those types of drinks particularly dangerous. The menu is voluminous and very diverse. No matter what you're in the mood for, you should find something here to satisfy you. The food is very good quality and full of flavor. Do *not* expect to eat a full portion, though - either plan to split it with someone or take leftovers home. The serving sizes are easily two meals, especially if you elect an appetizer or dessert. And you will probably only be able to handle one or the other - if you're going to have an entree, be warned that appetizer + entree = no room for dessert. Likewise, entree + dessert = no room for appetizer. Eating here is definitely about picking and choosing. The tab can get expensive - especially if you add drinks and appetizer/desert. I've easily spent $80-$100 for two people. But if you're in the mood for good food and don't mind waiting to be seated and having to sift through a zillion menu choices, this is the place to go."
Nicole P.,"Cambridge, MA",107,160,,3.0,2/19/2008,"It took me 20 minutes to get through the phone book menu! The menu is literally a book with numbered pages and includes advertisements.  I know this is not an upscale restaurant but ads in the menus?! Really? Now that's class. [ads minus 1 star] After my mind was done reeling from too many choices I finally chose a random dish of chicken stuffed tortillas.  My gf had the chicken madeira (sp?) and we shared a side of mac n' cheese.  The food was OK, nothing special and way overpriced.   I guess if you're hungry at the Cambridge Side Galleria it's a better option then the food court if you want to spend about $20 pp for lunch but I'd rather eat before I shop next time. [pricey ok food minus 1 star] That said I didn't have the cheesecake which I have to assume is really good."
Anam S.,"Cambridge, MA",0,22,,3.0,8/28/2013,"We ordered chocolate caramel cake and 30th Anniversary cake. The former one, was very delicious and we yearned for every bite!! However, though the latter looked extremely delicious it was also extremely heavy and made me difficult to finish it all in one go. Will definitely go there again to have the chocolate caramel cheesecake!!"
Chaoyu M.,"Turlock, CA",1,7,,4.0,2/4/2013,The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants to go to. Pretty cheap food for the portion size but service is a little slow. My friends and I waited for about 30 minutes to get our food even though we were there at a time when no one was there. With that said I will still continue to go there.
Allison R.,"Somerville, MA",239,689,173,3.0,7/13/2008,"Three stars for my neighborhood Cheesecake Factory, since it's usually pretty okay. Tucked in the corner of the Cambridgeside Galleria, this place ads a smidge of tasty class to this mall. There is never a wait of more than 10 minutes and the food is always good, even though my better half and I are usually stopping by for a late-nite snack. (Okay, meal-sized snack.)"
Susan N.,"Brooklyn, NY",284,570,17,5.0,12/22/2007,"Now I live by some pretty great restaurants - Helmands, Similians, Desafina.  So why would I ever go to the Cheesecake Factory, right? So last night, the boy and I were hungry.  It was 10 pm and we hadn't eaten dinner yet.  A quick search showed us that The Similians would be open.  Yay!  As the boy's never tried it, I decided to bring him there.  Alas, they closed at 10 and it was now 10:30.  Then my friend called to pick up stuff from my place.  By the time we were ready to go out again to eat, it was 11:30 pm and the boy's stomach was cursing at me in Urdu, a language he doesn't even know! We were resigned to do take-out and both lukewarm on the idea.  But lo and behold, The Cheesecake Factory was open till 12:30 am!  Score #1 for TCF!  He was lukewarm on the idea and normally I'd never go there, being lukewarm on the idea of chain restaurants but I have always heard the myth of TCF, but till I moved here last year, didn't believe it actually existed.  Curiousity got the better of me. We came in and were seated immediately.  11:30 pm at night really is the best time to go, I guess.  We ordered an appetizer to share and an entree each.  What were we thinking?!?!?  These things were GINORMOUS!  It's ok, though, b/c we ended up having so much to take home.  And for a chain, the food quality was surprisingly good, so it's stuff that I definitely didn't mind taking home.  The waitress was also so sweet and helpful.  We had a really good experience there. Would I go there again?  Well, being anti-chain restaurant, I'm not in a rush, but when it's late at night and we're super hungry, yes, we may actually hit up The Cheesecake Factory again.  *hangs head in shame*"
