Kay C.,"New York, NY",2,56,2,3.0,9/7/2012,Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad is amazingly good. I will be back for that again
Ilya Jacob R.,"Somerville, MA",23,74,29,3.0,6/21/2007,"Okay. I admit it. I used to work here.  The people who work here now are not those that I worked with. Management has changed. So I don't know if the ""service"" is better or worse since my tenure here. But generally speaking, it shouldn't be bad because its corporate and they drill into you the fear that you'll get ""mystery shopped"" (if you get a low score you get canned). If you have any problem, I'm sure that management will be eager to get it resolved.  As far as the food goes, its above average. They have all these different ethnic choices - wide ranging - and some are pretty decent. In my time there, I tried everything. I liked the tuna tataki salad - a bit steep price wise, but really great. I've sought out something that comes close but its really actually great. The Thai Chicken Pasta is pretty decent too for a non-Thai joint.  Also, they have some good drinks - the frozen iced mango and frozen iced raspberry are awesome.  Prices here are a bit on the high side, but portions can make up for it."
Rachel Q.,"New Boston, NH",21,87,5,5.0,9/2/2008,"Ok, ok, so everyone's been here already. But with the ten or so times I've been there, I've been amazed at the consistency of food quality and service. The food is great--no matter what you order--it's not salty or undercooked, and has the perfect amount of flavor.  I think the prices are reasonable, the portions are great, the cheesecake is overpriced, but you usually don't have room for it anyway. The bread you get before the meal is even great. The only downside is that it's ALWAYS crowded. But the good thing is that it's usually in a mall, so you can just grab a pager, and walk around during your wait. It's not an ordinary casual dinner or anything, but it's fancy enough to go on a date or after a show in the town.  Unfortunately, based on these reviews, everyone seems to hate this place, but I think it's great. And I've been to the Cambridge one the most, and it's just fine. The Burlington restaurant is also nice, and the one in the Prudential Center as well. It's not overrated, and pretty good for a chain."
stacey l.,"MA, MA",11,155,,3.0,1/15/2007,"I agree with the general sentiment of the most recent posts - but lets keep in mind that it is a chain and this restaurant does have it's place. It's good for groups since they have so much to choose from, and its family friendly. Can I emphatically recommend their appetizers and desserts.  Skip the dinners, they can be inundated with huge portions of side dishes, and light on the main course.  I go late night  and have no wait because we asked to be seated at the bar...slower service, but at 10:30 we were told there was a 15 minute wait to be seated in the main dining room.  Also recommend for take out....that way it is more kosher to order one meal and split with someone."
Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",165,1240,162,5.0,2/22/2006,"""This place can have QUITE the wait so be prepared. The food is delicious but try to save room for the dessert, clearly. Order the avocado eggrolls and you won't be disappointed. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich lives up to its name. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is mine too. The Bistro Shrimp Pasta is too scrumptous for words. Can you tell I go here a lot? I always assumed this place would have so-so food and amazing cheesecake but everything about it is good. That's probably why the line is out the door!"""
Chrissy H.,"Portland, ME",180,328,116,3.0,1/14/2007,"When shopping in the Cambridgeside galleria, bring a little extra money and a bit of extra time to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. The food court at the mall leaves little to be desired and no where else can you find the yummy warm oatmeal bread the CCF serves before your meal. (you also get a little loaf of sourdough) The portions of everything are so huge and the price is so medium. I advise ordering an appetizer for a meal or splitting an entree. Even the salads are gigantic! You basically get an entire garden. The menu is actually a short book of cocktails (I like the peach Bellini,) appetizers (the sweet tamale corn cakes are to die for,) salads (even the plain garden salad is tasty,) entrees (chicken stuffed tortillas are so bomb,) and of course cheesecake (I enjoy the strawberry cheesecake or the Linda's fudge cake.) Just remember that if you just can't stuff anymore food into your belly, you can always have dessert to go. A few things to keep in mind when dining at CCF:      Expect a wait. It's by far the most popular establishment in the mall so you can expect to be on at least a 30 minute waiting list during peak dining hours.      Expect to spend quite a bit of money if you order alcoholic beverages and dessert because they are not cheap and add up fast!     Be aware that the waitstaff isn't always top notch but you'll always get your food in a timely manner. The one time we didn't, the manager came by and picked up the check for us.     And if you work or live in or near the mall you can always order take out. You might have to hold for 5 minutes before someone takes your order but it's worth it. If you order a beverage on take out, make sure they remember to give it to you because they have forgotten mine on multiple occasions."
Lauren V.,"Newburyport, MA",264,486,22,3.0,4/24/2008,The cheesecake is always delicious.  The salads are huge. The menu is about the size of an epic novel. The avocado and turkey sandwich is tasteless. The place is always noisy and there is almost always a wait near dinner time. The drinks are WEAK. Three stars because the cheesecake is so damn good (if not slightly overpriced). Especially the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream (mmm...mascarpone mousse) and the Tiramisu Cheesecake. That is really all I have to say about that.
Susan D.,"Pasadena, CA",108,494,38,1.0,6/12/2007,"This is Americanized cuisine at its best. Stay clear if you're looking for flavors jumping off your palate. No cilantro, basil, chili-punch, etc. Just bland, bland, and more bland. However, since it offers everything under one roof, I have begrudgingly gone for coworker's farewell luncheon, unimaginative dinner pals, or just plain, boredom. I have tried the caesar salad (huge), french fries (crispy and fresh out of the fryerlator), and numerous cheesecakes (turtle, banana, chocolate mousse). All of the above were acceptable, not exceptional. They get one star for consistent desserts."
K D.,"West Newton, MA",0,41,1,3.0,4/1/2010,"I like the multiple food options and the tasty luau salad, BUT they always mess up my take out order.  It has gotten to the point I don't go there anymore, especially since PF Changs has also now opened at the Galleria."
Andrew C.,"Natick, MA",14,73,3,3.0,10/2/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory has good food, not great food, and they charge more than they should  for just good food. The place is huge but seems always busy. The bread is pretty tasty, the cheesecake is very good.     Service can be spotty because the place is so big, especially at the lunch rush. Had a few bad service experiences there but the food has never been bad, just more expensive than it should be. Softdrinks are also pricey but there is free refills.    I'm happy to go there with a group or if someone wants to go but I would never choose it at my first choice. I think there are plenty of places on Cambridge Street in Cambridge that charge the same prices and offer much better food."
Hana C.,"Boston, MA",57,80,69,2.0,8/30/2009,"food is decent. But omg such crappy takeout service- always ALWAYS missing something- whether it be salad dressing, broken go-away box, or an entire entree missing, or some side dish missing...."
Sarah L.,"Binghamton, NY",28,227,,4.0,3/20/2007,"What can I say, I love the cheesecake factory.  It is factually correct to describe cheesecake factory as a chain with a fairly whack design philosophy, but I'm a total sucker for fried macaroni and cheese, avocado eggrolls, milkshake cocktails, not being able to decide what to eat, and having to take home 3/4 of what I ordered if I want to have any hope of making it any signifcantly nonzero portion of the way through a cheesecake. The only problem this particular one has above and beyond what other cheesecake factories have is its mall internal-ness:  I don't know if I've ever been here on the weekend and had less than an hour long wait for a table for dinner."
Vanilla P.,"Castro Valley, CA",154,1022,32,3.0,7/24/2007,"After walking around the mall for upwards of an hour, I was really excited to get a booth and read my book in private. Imagine my horror when the only seats available were high tops, since the other sections were full, and I would have to wait until a booth cleared out! So I took a high top, and everyone got to watch me slop the salad into my mouth like a special toddler.  Thank you, Cheesy, for remembering to bring my salad out sans chicken. Thank you for constantly coming around and refilling my beverage.  NO thank you for forgetting to bring me bread. Other than the cheesecake itself, that's why I come here. No thank you for calling me ma'am repeatedly. I know I'm on the brink of my thirties, but you don't have to remind me every time you come to the table."
Niesha G.,"Medford, MA",7,3,,5.0,1/13/2012,"omg the red velvet cheesecake is crack, and the crag ragoon/ wontons were also great. high calories, but i would rather die happy:)"
Annie M.,"Boston, MA",11,28,,3.0,10/18/2007,"This place is alright.  But let's face it, who wants to eat with a bunch of mallrats and business park sell outs?   The food is good, but it's the typical chain restaurant fare- except this menu has the added bonus of including advertisements for your reading pleasure!  There's always a pretty long line- usually of teenagers with A&F bags and soulless corporate whores who can't get through the meal without scrolling through their BlackBerry. The food probably won't make you sick.  Just the people."
Tin T.,"Mattapan, MA",2,18,,4.0,7/23/2010,"I'm not going to lie, I freaking love their starter bread. The darker bread is amazing, i can eat it all day. The only thing I don't like about eating at the cheesecake factory is that its too dark! I mean I understand some people like to eat in the dark, but I don't. A little bit of light can't hurt anybody. The burgers are good, you can't go wrong with a burger. The portions are pretty big. Their pasta plates can feed two people. The service is pretty good, i never had a problem and I have eaten here more than 20+ times. Yea its kinda pricey but you pay for what you eat. I only thing i can they should change is the price on their drinks. 10 dollars for some mixed drink is kinda too much."
Pisces P.,"Boston, MA",3,57,,2.0,10/29/2011,"Hey Everyone, Yesterday I celebrated one of my friends' bday!! I really wished that I had chosen a different place to eat!! I arrived at 7p to meet my friend and had asked whether or not there were tables available for a party of two.  I was told that there were.  I waited for awhile for my friend to arrive in the meantime I was getting tired and decided to order take out.  Ironic enough my friend arrived after I had got the takeout.  She ordered take out as well.  We were just going to eat in the food cort, but I decided why not eat at the restaurant.  Anyways I had asked the waitstaff if we could have a take and she said that was fine.  To make a long story short.  I didn't know that there was a rule for not eating take out inside.  We paid for the food and it wasn't as though we were sneaking in.  This was the icing on the cake waitstaff were walking pass our table giving us attitude and dirty looks.  I had had it!!! I went to the front and explain the confusion and was told it was ok and that we wanted to order drinks.  I stayed calm, but the pregnant waitstaff girl who was giving me an attitude stood there looking at me while I chatting and trying to get clarity and service!! She told me I was being rude to her!! She handed my the menu with an attitude!! My friend and I later enjoyed the evening and order sangrias and a different waitstaff girl was nice enough to assist us with a smile!! The only reason why I chose this place is because I had a gift card!!!"
Evelyn S.,"Boston, MA",0,6,,5.0,9/5/2010,Absolutely in love. The service was great. The place is clean and the atmosphere is great. Our waitress was very nice and knew exactly what to suggest. She suggested we try the Fried Mac and cheese balls were AMAZING and the Long Island Iced Tea is served in a HUGE glass. We both ordered pasta and they brought it in a huge plate. The servings are big enough for two. Their prices are a bit high but compared to portions they are reasonable. I am definitely going back.
Mary R.,"Somerville, MA",28,121,,4.0,1/24/2009,"We all know the Cheesecake Factory means long lines, larger than normal portions, a menu that if you actually read would take you all night and slightly higher than you'd like prices. But what the Cheesecake Factory means to me is corn tamale cakes. I'm in love with this gooey, awesome appetizer. It's perfect - from the little avocado slices, to the sour cream and corn. Seriously I'm in love."
Lei L.,"New York, NY",86,56,,4.0,12/29/2008,"wow more college memories, spent so many birthday dinners here. the food is good, felt so high class by college standards....but EACH time i went for the molten frozen ice cream chocolate cake, such decadence....god it tasted good! i ate too much in college, so i always felt sick afterwards...so i have a lot of sick memories from cheesecake factory"
