Billy E.,"Scottsdale, AZ",21,164,16,2.0,5/2/2009,"Warm spring day taking my wife and doggy to Petco cambridgside to pick up the little guys food.  Thought yum, I'll stop at cheesecake factory for some lunch.  We took the doggie last year a few times as it got a little colder and less people on the patio, no problems.  Today, a bit busy but not crazy, we asked to sit on patio with dog....they told me that we can eat but dog has to be on opposite side of the fence....W..T...F?   We were cool last year when you weren't that busy but not now when you're busy, my dog has to sit next to the street...nice.  You guys suck.....oh,  your food is okay."
K O.,"Allston, MA",1,36,,3.0,8/27/2008,"Timing can be everything.  I dropped by this Cheesecake Factory around 2:00 on a weekday afternoon and the place was almost empty.  I had a seat within minutes, the server was attentive, and I didn't have to wait long for my meal.  Otherwise, this is a Cheesecake Factory like every other Cheesecake Factory.  It's definitely pricey compared to the nearby food court, but the food is better and the atmosphere is more conducive to chatting and relaxing after work or shopping.  For the money, you also get a huge amount of reasonably tasty food -- the ""light"" lunch version of the beer-battered fish and chips was enough to fill me up.  (And I didn't even touch the cole slaw that came with it!)  Overall, satisfying if not particularly memorable."
Welton B.,"Saugus, MA",3,47,,1.0,5/29/2008,"Food like this should never cost money. This is dreck. I've been there twice: the first time for a salad, which was approaching mediocre but couldn't quite make it; the second time for fish tacos, which were a complete abomination, and an insult to every foodstuff included, not to mention the intended victim--me. A week ago I had fish tacos for the first time in San Diego at Rubio's--a cheap fast-food joint that serves fish tacos. I liked them. So I tried them when I got back to Cambridge, and figured I'd try 'em at TCF--at 4 times the price, they should be at least decent, right? WRONG! The tortillas, which for some odd reason were doubled on each taco, tasted bland, there was WAY too much unseasoned cabbage (about 80% of the filling, by my estimate), and at the bottom was some oddly tasteless fish that had some kind of coloring that one would think might be seasoning. But one would be wrong. It has to just be food coloring. There was ""pico de gallo"" on the side, consisting of diced tomatoes and nothing else (God save us from anything like seasoning or spice!), along with a lump of what they consider guacamole--presumably a lump of old library paste that had green food coloring added and a couple of pencil erasers. This was one of the blandest meals I've ever had... oh, and another thing, there was a drop of special sauce in each of the tacos--I know, because that one drop that was supplied fell on my shirt, where I got a chance to taste it. It wasn't bad. But what's with the rationing? Are we having a national fish taco sauce shortage? Did I not have enough rationing stamps? The meal came with rice (yellow minute rice with bird's eye vegetable bits thrown in) and black beans (possibly the high point of the meal--not too much to screw up between the can and the plate). To sum up, the food tastes awful, the service is unusually busy, and hence have no time for actual individual interaction with customers, and the prices are outlandish. This is a good place to take that boss to lunch if he just fired you--then make him pay."
Angie G.,"Boston, MA",143,161,3,2.0,7/31/2008,"imagine a two hour wait for a table. and then an hour and (what 40 minutes?) wait for a damn cheesecake. imagine the cheesecake being still almost frozen (shit, as long as i waited, i thought it wouldve been melted by then!) yeah. thats how awesome this place was.  well, okay. its not that bad. i've had a good time there before."
Natalia L.,"Nutley, NJ",0,8,,5.0,1/3/2012,"Food is delicious, no waiting for a table, huge menu and cheesecake are deliciuous!!! Great place to go in any occasion."
Sophie M.,"Seattle, WA",19,23,,2.0,12/27/2008,"I'm afraid to say that this was my first experience of sit down dining in Boston, courtesy of a friend's going away dinner, and I was pretty unimpressed. Although I enjoyed the ridiculous decor, service was slow and incompetent (even by my own fairly low standards) and the food unappealing. The menu itself is overwhelming, with most of our number choosing to order off the list of 6 'specials' rather than negotiate the endless pages of print and nowhere is the actual cost of alcohol stated, which always rings warning bells for me. I don't like cheesecake at all, which I'm lead to believe is completely unnatural, but I enjoyed the novelty of the flavours on offer and my companions enjoyed their selections, so for those two reasons alone The Cheesecake Factory gets two stars."
Lisa C.,"Somerville, MA",0,1,,5.0,11/10/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to go out to eat! I love the buffalo blasts for an appetizer, and always get farfalle chicken & mushroom pasta (minus the pasta, lol). Service is always awesome, with the exception of the hostesses. The BEST server here is Sean. Me and my boyfriend ALWAYS get him, he's the best   :)"
Brad D.,"Durham, NH",19,129,6,1.0,1/15/2007,"I've heard rave reviews about how large their menu is.  Well, they certainly focus on quantity and not quality.  I was disappointed with my meal.  I had a chicken dish that was very bland.  The cheesecake was good, but I have had better.  They should maybe focus on a smaller menu to help out with the quality.  This place is another reason that I usually don't eat in chain restaurants."
Lia M.,"Arlington, VA",800,1755,1373,1.0,5/13/2007,"I am not so much rating the food here, as what I saw happen.  First of all, I like Cheesecake Factory.  It's one of the few chain restaurants I do like.  It's not my favorite restaurant, though it might be my favorite chain.  This one is no different than any other location.  Our service here was awesome & I feel bad because I can't remember our server's name.  However, I watched on in disbelief as a party was seated.  One woman in the party looked at the booth & noticed the seats were dirty.  She took a napkin & started cleaning the seats as the staff member who was seating the party just watched.  IMO, the staff member should have been apologetic & offered to do it for her.  I don't know if anything was said to this party, but I was shocked that a. the person who cleaned the table would leave the seats dirty and b. that the staff member seating this party didn't offer to clean.  Even though it didn't happen to me, I was still shocked.  Very poor."
Phil D.,"Oakland, CA",17,124,7,2.0,8/24/2006,"I think this is the most mediocre restaurant in the world. I didn't review it earlier because everyone else has it right. Overpriced? Check. Huge portions? Check. Long wait? You bet. Worth it? No. Do not (no matter how tempting it may be because it sounds all homey and like-mom-used-to-make) order the meatloaf sandwich. That's what I had and it was pretty ugly. Should have stuck to the burger. The Cheesecake itself (I had the plain) is OK, but it's no Junior's."
Tyisha J.,"MA, MA",1,5,,2.0,1/9/2007,"What can I say? Maybe it was an off  day or something but for me the restaurant fell short of all the hype. The wait was long-as expected. The service was decent. It was the food that just didn't do it for me. I ordered Orange Chicken with mixed vegetables and Rice, a friend of mine had Fettuccine Alfredo, another Chicken Mashed Potatoes and Veggies. And at the end of the meal we all had alot of food left on our plates-and not because of the ridiculously large portions. The food was well very very bland. The cheesecake-I had a special Godiva edition was pretty good though-but I thought I would get a slightly larger slice for the price. So... I guess I would go back -but save my money and go straight for desert and coffee."
Shirley Y.,"San Francisco, CA",97,225,176,3.0,1/13/2008,"it's a chain restaurant.  with horrible decor [shudder].  and when i say horrible, i mean horrible.  i feel like i'm in a theme park. however, there's something about the food and drink here that keeps me coming back.  i feel like it's my guilty pleasure, like us magazine.  if you're stuck at the mall and you can't get out [really stuck inside, since there are great restaurants just across the street from the mall], it's one of the better mall restaurants.  the portions are huge, and the food pretty decent.  great for hungry people like me [ie. binge eater] and great for leftovers.  they also have my favorite cocktail of choice:  the well-mannered dirty martini [includes blue cheese stuffed olives!].  and their cheesecake is decadent [lives up to the name], even though i do not have much of a sweet tooth.  so i keep coming back...but it's advisable to bring someone to share the food and not everyone is as keen as i am on the cheesecake factory."
Stephanie H.,"Salem, MA",83,406,,3.0,3/2/2008,"Went here for breakfast this morning. I love the selection of food they have. My sister and I got there soon after they started serving breakfast, around 10am. We were seated at a two person booth type table in the bar area. The place wasn't busy at all. I think it was due to getting there so early. The breakfast menu has changed since the last time I went for breakfast= but it was still good and filling. The orange juice is half pulp which I HATE! That is why I gave it three stars instead of 4. The other reason I didn't give it a full five stars is due to the fact that the waitress, who was friendly enough ,seemed to be in a rush to get us out of there. During the hour we were there, the place didn't even have any sort of wait that I have normally seen it have during peak lunch or dinner hours so I don't know what the rush was."
vinny o.,"Boston, MA",0,30,2,4.0,3/19/2011,"Ok so ive been to the cheesecake factory quite a few times and i just cant seem to find anything wrong with this place,like i said in my previous review the consistency of the place is what makes me keep on going back.The cambridge location seems to be the best though,they always get it right and never overcook or undercook any of my food,you guys should try it for yourselves,the menu has something on it for EVERYBODY,from gluten free to low carb meals and tons of other options!"
Jessica B.,"New Britain, CT",258,99,96,3.0,9/10/2007,"this was actually the 5th or 6th time i had been here. we had company in town and figured, with nothing planned in advance, it would be accommodating to just about any appetite- given the extensive menu. i've never really been blown away by this place but it usually gives me what i expect. we were seated promptly as it was just after 1 on a saturday afternoon. the waitress came over quickly and returned with our drinks. my girlfriend and i shared the ahi carpaccio (appetizer: 10.95) which was accompanied by a non-descript aioli, avocado slices, a cucumber salad, and a soy-ginger-esque dipping sauce. it was light and delicious. we also ordered a kobe burger topped with caramelized onions and fontina cheese (12.95). it was over done but extremely flavorful. the fries left much to be desired. we also ordered the edemame. i think it would be hard to mess them up...they were up to par. the waitress was super good about refills which i was so pleased about, it was about 90 degrees outside and i was thirsty! she did offer to bring my green tea sweetened by the bar but couldn't really say what it was sweetened with, just that they did it there. i opted for splenda.  i wouldn't really go out of my way for this place but my experiences have been fairly consistent."
Adrienne B.,"New York, NY",40,317,5,2.0,8/17/2005,This place is good for someone who doesn't quite know what they want and doesn't mind waiting for it. I sometimes get the overwhelming urge to go to Cheesecake for no apparent reason.  They have a huge menu- but I often find I don't want anything on it and the salads are so big I feel incredily wasteful ordering them.  Its fun with groups cause it has something for everyone- but its really annoying that they won't take reservations for big parties.  There are always obscene waits on weekends at this Cheesecake- and probably every other in the U.S.  A trick to try is become a vulture and nab a high table in the bar area which are first come first serve.  If you're gonna get anything try the Chicken Romano- but ask for extra sauce they never give enough or the Chicken Kabobs- that dish is actually really really good.  Their nachos are great too- I had them at the new Burlington location and they were salty and delicious.
J B.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,240,5,1.0,2/12/2007,I have been convinced to go here multiple times over the year and every single time I am dissapointed by the food. I have never once had a quality meal here.
Julie A.,"Arlington, MA",61,456,5,3.0,4/7/2007,"I have to say I hate chain restaurants, but this is one of the better ones. You have to wait forever, yes, but at least at this location you can browse around the mall while you wait.  The menu is huge so no matter who you are with, someone will find something they can eat and at a very fair price. Vegans, vegetarians, carnivores, kids, adults, teens, etc they will all be able to find something on the menu. Personally I feel as if a lot of their items are too bland and soggy, but for the price, amount of food, and fact that it's a chain, it's not all that bad. I kept hearing about how good their steaks were and finally tried one. It was very good. the mashed potatoes were also yummy. I got the surf and turf another time (steak and salmon) which was also very good. Stay away from the soggy fish tacos and most of the pastas are overcooked and blah. I'm not a fan of cheesecake so me saying I don't like it here doesn't really mean much, but I'll say it anyway. By no means is this great gourmet food, but it's a hell of a lot better than some other chains out there."
Lisa S.,"Melrose, MA",5,43,,4.0,12/12/2007,"I'm actually surprised at all of the negative reviews.   I love it here, but it's the cheesecake factory and in a mall so there are some things to be expected.  Such as the long waits (if you go on the weekend or some evenings, expect to wait upwards of an hour or two depending on the severity).   The prices are on the higher side of average, but the portions are large so i guess it evens out.  They have the best bread (i'm assuming a sort of honey-wheat-oat), although i can do without the sourdough. I rarely get an appetizer or dessert for that matter.  I always bring the dessert home instead of eating it in the restaurant because i'm usually too stuffed from the bread and entree. My favorites are the Chicken Madeira and the Farfalle w/chicken & roasted garlic.  Love them!  I've only had one bad meal there and it was the meatloaf.  Not your typical meatloaf and i learned my lesson, so now i order with caution. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer is amazing but i think i felt my heart stop mid-bite.  Not for the health conscious. Note: I'm not sure if anyone else will agree, but i've gotten take-out here several times and it NEVER tastes as good as when i dine-in.  The food always tastes much blander.  I don't get it, but it's a bummer."
amanda n.,"Framingham, MA",0,50,22,4.0,1/28/2007,"Cheesecake Factory gets 4 stars for a few tried-and-true menu items that my brother and I stick with almost every time.      a)  Fried Calamari with a great garlic sauce    b)  the Classic Burger, a good burger one can always rely on. Trying other things on the extensive menu always leaves me disappointed.  We rarely get cheesecake, but sure, it's good."
