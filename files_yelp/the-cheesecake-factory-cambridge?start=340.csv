Ross M.,"Boston, MA",0,5,,2.0,11/30/2012,"Okay, let me start of by stating that I don't normally complain about service, but tonight I had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory in The Cambridge Side Galleria; it was good food, but OH MAN!! Did the service suck! I had the displeasure of having Christine S. as my waitress and she was HORRIBLE! I understand they are always packed, but 15 + min for our drinks to arrive is a little much....we had wine. Our food was great, it came way before our drinks did. I was really hoping that once the food and drinks arrived, Christine would pick up the service and be a little more attentive. She came into our section a bunch of times but rushed passed us. After our food was finished it took 10 minutes for her to even notice we wanted the check, then took another 5 minutes to bring us the check.  Initially we wanted dessert (of course we did, its the Cheesecake Factory), but after the amount of time it took her we knew we would be there for another hour just to get a menu, order, and receive dessert.  Instead when she finally got us the bill- we paid, shopped and then returned to take dessert home. YIKES! WHAT AN ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE EXPERIENCE."
Alex L.,"Allston, MA",51,177,,2.0,9/4/2007,"Cheesecake Factory doesn't really have that good of food.  It's decent, but not great.  The reason I put 2 stars is how rude our hostess was.  The girl who took our name down was nice and smiled, but the girl who seated us looked like she REALLY didn't want to be there.  I tried to be friendly, but she came off like a bitch.  Service like that just puts a whole damper on the feel of dinner.  I'll more than likely come back since sooooooo many people love this place, but I can't say that I'm ever impressed."
Alice K.,"Cambridge, MA",5,59,,3.0,10/26/2005,"Best cheesecake in town!  All slices are huge and come with a generous dollop of whipped cream.  The restaurant's title item is its best feature, though.  The menu is huge, varied and so All-American that any attempts at ethnic dishes are sapped of their vitality.  It's an excellent place to take a large group of fussy eaters.  Make a reservation, though, otherwise you'll find yourself in line behind other large groups of fussy eaters."
Anthony Y.,"Winchester, MA",10,7,,3.0,12/27/2009,"The food looked pretty greasy, but the presentation was rather good. I found the environment that they seat you in a bit too dimly lit. Also, the waitresses were very difficult to reach if there was a problem. Our waitress was never in sight. Obviously is was busy, but I think their human resources were spread too thin to make the evening even enjoyable."
Karolina B.,"Gilbert, AZ",82,10,,2.0,11/18/2006,"I don't understand why this place is a huge hit - I think it is slightly overrated. I went here once for my boyfriend's friend's birthday party - it was a party of 20 and we had reservations yet they were still about an hour and a half late getting us our table. I can sort of understand that as it was Saturday night, but still, we had reservations - you'd think they be better prepared. Once we got our table, the service was very good. We had one waitress to the whole table and she was very good at handling everyone's drink orders and dinner orders - so I had to give it 2 stars for great service. Unfortunately, the food was something that was obviously frozen and microwaved. It tasted very fake and I was not impressed (I had the quesadillas). My boyfriend had a turkey sandwich or burger, and I could see him grimacing all throughout the meal. Thinking that dessert would be the highlight of our evening, we ordered the cheesecake (we are both cheesecake lovers by the way) we heard so much about. We couldn't finish one slice - it was way too sweet and thick. We were not impressed and didn't understand why it was so highly rated. I'm sure others like it, but we weren't too happy with the quality of the food. It's definitely a fun atmosphere for large crowds and the prices are moderate - I'll give it that. So if you must go, go for the atmosphere (just be ready to wait for an hour plus - even with reservations), but you might want to go light on the food and just order a pizza afterwards... just a thought."
Joey F.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,19,10,4.0,8/8/2008,"This restaurant is very good.  I am both amazed and appalled at the recent rash of negative comments surrounding this particluar restaurant on the night of national cheesecake night.  Did it ever enter your mind that they ran out of cheesecake and had to get more in the middle of the shift?  And this business about bad service because the gratuity was included is just plain ludicrous.  18% on $1.50 is less than .30 a person, because the majority of you guys were cheap asses anyway that just ordered water.  So I hardly doubt, your 4.00 tip total was even close to being enough to deal with a group of negative nancys like yourselves!  Maybe you guys should go out and experience a real dinner  on a standard night and write a real review, so people can get an accurate depiction of this restaurant and not a skewed reality because you had to wait a little longer to be cheap asses. maybe they should rename it national cheapass night."
L S.,"Somerville, MA",9,160,12,2.0,7/6/2005,"When I first went to this restaurant I was shocked by the huge menu, but then I realized that I didn't even like most of the stuff on the menu. Last time I came to the Cheesecake Factory at the galleria I waited over an hour and they still would not seat us, meanwhile they were seating people who came after us. So basically, if you want to go to the cheesecake factory don't come to the one at the galleria. And if you decide to go do order cheesecake it's delicious!!"
FELICIA F.,"Suffolk, MA",0,5,,3.0,3/28/2010,"My major gripe about this place is the wait for a table. There is always a long wait. After a few visits, I have decided that I don't even like their food, so now I only go for cheesecake. I thorougly enjoy bypassing the mopes waiting for a table (for nasty food and uncomforatably close seating) and go right to the counter to order my multiple slices of delicious cheesecake. This has been my thing more recently. Well the last time I visited this establishment (for cheesecake only), it was a semi disaster. First I asked the employee if they had the red velvet cheesekcake (because I did not see it in the case) and she said yes and pointed it to me. Of course I jumped all over that and asked for a piece of that and the banana creme cheesecake. My boyfriend (who worked in the food industry forever) noticed she had been handling money or something and needed fresh gloves, so he immediately reminded her of that before she began slicing up my cheesecake. He placed his order and we took a seat on the bench. This is where I'll add that for some odd reason, I do enjoy the decor of this place. Anyway we pay for cakes and go home. Upon arrival at home, I am absolutely horrified when I discover my red velvet order was somehow mistaken for apple crisp or something. How in the world did she screw that up after the animated conversation we had?! At this point, I am infuriated that I had to deal with Cambridgeside Galleria and the miscreants who frequent it, only to come home with the wrong order. I phone the place and speak to a manager who very insincerely apologizes and asks me to come back and get my cake. I respond with a no and she responds by putting me on hold forever. Finally she returns and offers to send me a $10 gift certificate. I accept. I have since used my gift certificate (on cheesecake of course!)and definitely checked my order before going home."
Greg S.,"Arlington, MA",2,116,,4.0,12/30/2007,"I like the Cheesecake Factory, for many different reasons, The selection on the menu is huge, the prices may seem high but here is a simple solution, don't gorge yourself and bring home leftovers and you have 2 meals, when you factor that in it actually really isn't all that bad because their portions are huge. For instance the meatloaf which I think is really good is like half a meatloaf. Anyway, I've tried a lot of different things on the menu, most of the pasta dishes, orange chicken, some of the steak items, the brunch menu is really good, and you can always get the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito which is really good. I've also tried a lot of their cheesecake which you can get to go or buy a smaller or larger cake to go, the smaller ones are usually plenty big enough because you can cut small pieces for about ten people and they are filling. I've tried the Oreo, plain, Snickers, carrot cake, and pumpkin and they are all fantastic. Also, if you like Iced tea try their iced tea i think it's really good, and if you get their lemonade tell them no sugar on the glass it's too much."
