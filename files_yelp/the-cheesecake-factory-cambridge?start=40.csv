Kim S.,"Lowell, MA",184,272,3892,2.0,1/1/2015,"Starting to go downhill.. this used to be a great place with consistent food and service.  A group of friends and I went there to catch up after the holidays and the staff didn't seem like they wanted to be there.   My salad came out wet and over-killed with dressing.  They also need to upgrade their seatings/booths.  When we were sitting, we could feel the other guests with their back towards us (separate from others) moving, getting up and moving etc.  It was really awkward. The apps were good and I love the small plates."
Nandanie S.,"Quincy, MA",418,523,355,3.0,1/4/2016,"I think the Cheesecake Factory is best for apps and dranks and cheesecake. Each time I've gotten an entree, it falls short. I got the basil shrimp pasta, and it was a little tasteless. I had to drown it a little in black pepper to taste good. Apps were YUMMY! Fried mac and cheese balls, avocado egg rolls, and calamari were all delicious. Seriously...next time i'll just get an appetizer for a meal. I got the pineapple moscow mule for a cocktail, and it was nice. Cheesecake was the salted caramel one, which I took half home for hubby bear. Great spot for hanging out, but I just may not entrees next time. They're huge and sometimes unappealing. I think that the restaurant chain should expand their small plates menu, and scale down the 48754097 pages of entrees."
Chyna B.,"Cambridge, MA",61,3,,3.0,5/21/2017,"The taste of the food is great and the cheesecake and desserts are also amazing!!! I would recommend the Steak Diane, the banana cheesecake, the Lemoncello cake, Lindas fudge cake (delicious), the herb crusted salmon, and the shrimp bistro pasta (yummy). On the other hand, the service is inconsistent at this location.  I can say I haven't had two consecutive visits that have gone well.  We have had the wrong food brought out, cold chips, waiters forget to bring our food out or put out order in (more than once), etc.  The copley location is better. Even with the mess ups...as mentioned the food is good so we keep going but that is why I can't give it more than 3 stars"
Ben S.,"Allston, MA",217,118,11,2.0,11/23/2015,"I've been here three times and all three times received poor service in some shape or form. Some of the waiters are super friendly and very professional and the food quality is on par with all other CF locations.  However, in my most recent visit there were four people joking around loudly at the hostess stand that were swearing and completely ignoring me for about a minute. Then when I asked for a table for two the host made a joke saying ""nope sorry you're gonna have to sit on the floor"".  Then when we were seated I waited for five minutes without a waiter greeting our table until I asked for help from a random waiter.  During our meal we were right next to a POS station and could hear pretty loudly waiters talking about how customers were being ""cheap"" with tips lately- suggesting the foreign customers were ignoring the sticker in the check books saying that ""it is customary to tip 15-20% in America"".  Then when our check did come the waiter had printed the wrong check - probably a rushed mistake but still just one more part of our experience that was negative.  I want to emphasize that some people that work here are extremely professional and that the food is great. I've just had several poor customer service experiences that have made me want to avoid this location even though it is convenient for me."
Erik P.,"Thornton, NH",0,38,1,1.0,8/31/2017,"For starters this place should be good. But it isn't. We sat in the bar area where you didn't need to be seated by the hostess who mind you wasn't in site. Then about 10 minutes waiting our waitress showed up. We eventually ordered food, how ever the chicken came out cold. Ok so upon mentioning this issue the chicken went away and we waited. I swear we waited so long that I thought I watched a snail racing across to the finish line. Manager didn't come around to apologize. We had to stop one in his tracks to inform him the problem. And did he offer anything to make up for it? Or to stop us from leaving? Nope. Instead we got a typical ""sorry""!!!!! So another. But that's not the point. We waited and waited until we were almost done with the salad. What is the point of having a chicken salad without the chicken? Sorry? That's it? Offer us a free dessert or something. So finally a hot plate of chicken came to our table by another manager. She offered ""anything else I can do for you?"" Yeah take it off our bill. Or give us a couple of sweet freebies so I can feel loved by cheesecake. So we finished our food. And waited another 30 years (as it felt) again watching the same snail moving to the other side of the finish line. Our waitress came and asked the typical question. Anything else? Yeah my check so I can escape the inescapable. And empty my tummy by walking. She finally came with the check. ****** and was anything done?******** noooo!!! So I grabbed the manager nearly pulling his shirt Out and asked to take off the chicken at least because of the fact that we ate a chicken salad without the chicken. And did he offer anything? Nope!!! Typical guy who collects a paycheck to make a living. He doesn't care nor anyone in there. They are negligent, incompetent, inconsiderate, uneducated in management and just plain dumb people. Get your act together. Educate yourself in customer satisfaction, find someone who can teach you how to approach a dissatisfied customer. And for goodness sake grow a sense of humor and don't act like a dead doorknob. Yes I had to get him to take It off and he finally did. But why should I have to call them out for their mistakes. It wasn't even busy. Grow up guys in Cheesecake Factory. And maybe just maybe you'll get better ratings."
Steph L.,"Boston, MA",7,39,67,5.0,3/3/2016,"Perfect place to grab a bite after some shopping therapy at the mall.  The portions are generous, our waitress was wonderful. Food was delicious, nothing else to ask for. Too bad we didn't have room for dessert :)  We'll be back for sure."
Keith C.,"Newton, MA",47,224,9,2.0,12/14/2015,"So, staying in the Marlowe, and wanted to grab Sunday Brunch, we didn't want to go outside. Unfortunately there is nothing in the Galeria which is brunch-ish, so we wandered in here. The place was empty, and we were seated pretty quickly. I got the four-cheese gluten-free pasta, and my wife the breakfast omelette. Both plates had a decent taste, but portions were smaller than I'd expected. Not unreasonably so, but normally pasta dishes are pretty sizable because well, they cost nothing to make. Afterwards, we got the only gluten-free cheesecake, which was also good. I would give three stars for this, however there were two main issues. The first was that out waiter said basically nothing, and kinda seemed upset in general? Maybe he was having a bad day, but it was pretty weird. He wasn't unfriendly, just... intensely quiet. He was good about refilling drinks though. The other big issue is that several times during brunch they were doing something that was either vacuuming or blendering or whatever, but it was so loud that I couldn't hear my wife, who was sitting 3 feet away, over the sound of it for several minutes. Very annoying. Short story, food was fine, service was ok-ish, and ambiance was pretty annoying."
Chris F.,"Quincy, MA",105,3,,1.0,8/24/2017,"I went in for lunch with a cousin and sat in the bar / lounge for snack hour and a beer. I sat squirming in my chair for about 10 minutes and made eye contact multiple times with a manager at the host stand who saw me wrenching my neck in an attempt to locate our server. As I squirmed in my chair this manger , who was casually chatting with a few servers st the host stand , made eye contact with me multiple times. It was obvious we were not greeted , we had no drink order , no napkin on our table . He did not do anything to get a server to our table or even acknowledge our growing frustration . If you don't want my business that is fine. We got right up and went across to world of beer for a wonderful lunch. Cheesecake was our first choice but that will never happen again. This Cambridge location is usually empty and dead and I can see why if this is the tone this manager sets. The Braintree location has a line out the door and a long wait on every visit! If Cambridge is getting less customers they should value the few that still want to go in and pay 12 dollars for a cocktail. Greet your guest within a minute of them sitting down ! Basic rule #1! This place is awful ! Go to world of beer or a better mall / restaurant . This particular manager should probably be at Burger King with his customer service skills"
Audrey P.,"Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",49,81,59,5.0,9/20/2014,"Yes there's always a line, you have to wait, service can be non-existant...  But oh man who cares, their desserts!!!!! I mean the menu is awesome: portions are huge and I had the best veggie burger in a while, but it's a restaurant where you might think ""Life is uncertain... Let's eat dessert first"".  Their ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake changed my life forever, I'm not joking... WOOAHHHH"
Tenzin Y.,"Boston, MA",48,7,20,4.0,4/11/2016,"My friend and I went on Wednesday around 2p for lunch. Surprisingly it wasn't busy then. The hostess was friendly and we only had to wait like 1 minute for seats.  Their menu has a wide selection of food. I ordered a cappuccino as it was cold that day (the cup was huge and it definitely warmed we up). We ordered crab wontons for appetizer and I was surprised it came in such a large portion size. Their breadsticks with butter was delicious (esp the brown bread). We ordered orange chicken and tomato basil pasta which were both delicious and worth the price as it came in huge portion.  Our waiter was friendly and checked in to see if everything was alright and constantly filled our glass with water. Our food came quickly and the presentation was great. Yes it's quite expensive but judging from the size it's worth it. I also suggest sharing food with your friends if you're on a tight budget. We started to get full and didn't get to order their famous cheesecake... But that's something to look forward to in the future.  Also, my friend mentioned how the lighting is pretty dim here as it was difficult to take pics of our food or to even see the food. Overall, we had a great experience here and took the leftovers home which still tasted great after a couple days. :)"
Regret B.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,12/17/2016,"The waitstaff that work the takeout are appalling.  It's not the first time that this has happened which is even worse.  When I call in my order, I have to call back a minimum of 3-5 times and ask for the manager as each time, I get put on endless hold and no-one ever picks up.  Tonight, I called in my order, said I'd be there in 30 minutes. Whoever took my call said the food will be ready and out in 15 minutes.  It took me 40 minutes to get there.   As I was trying to park my car for curbside pickup there was a large SUV which parked over 2 spaces, I called into the restaurant to see if they could run the order out to my car and I would just pay them. However the employee (woman) who answered said, ""Oh, I'm sure that's my ride, I'm on my way out and I'll tell him to move.""  I said ok and waited, 10 minutes later, a woman waddles out and continues to shove bags of food into the back of the car and then squeezed herself into the front seat. Another 5 minutes passes before she and the driver pull out. I park and walk into the takeout area.  There are 2 employees standing behind the takeout counter, one of them fussing with her cell phone and the other plays with rolls of coins in the cash register.  They see me but ignore me and continue NOT to do their job. I walk away to the hostess desk and tell the hostess  that no one acknowledged that I was standing at the takeout area.  The hostess tells me she's going to get the manager and walks me back to the takeout area where the ""coin girl"" decides to acknowledge me, at which point the manager comes up and I repeat the story in front of the ""coin and cell phone girls"" as they stand there and shrug their shoulders.  It was probably 50 minutes now since my initial phone call and my food is no where to be seen.  The manager rushes back to the kitchen and again, I'm left to wait.  After what seems like too many minutes, I leave. I call back 10 minutes later to ask for the regional manager's name and phone number.  The hostess who answers the phone puts me on hold to find the information.  5 minutes later, she answers the phone again, telling me the restaurant manager is busy and can't get that information to me.  I said, "" You're telling me the manager who I just spoke with face to face, is too busy to take my call?  Is that right?""  She responds, ""Well, I....I ....can't really find him, I don't know where he is, I think he's with another guest.""  At which point, I say good bye and hang up. So, if the hostess doesn't know where the manager is, how does she know he's with another guest or busy?.   It seems that no  one in the restaurant knows which way is up.   The service is subpar even for a low-level mass  production franchise restaurant. the employees are juvenile, rude and extremely unprofessional"
Jessika E.,"Boston, MA",0,8,12,2.0,7/29/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory countless times. However, I haven't been on a late Friday night. It didn't seem busy from the walk in (before 8pm). There was no one waiting. This was the first time we got seated right away. First, we were a party of two and our hostess wanted to seat us at a table near the front with several other parties. It looked crowded over there. It didn't have any arm room, so we asked to be in a booth. They accommodated us. We get seated. Now, it still doesn't look crowded just a good amount of parties. There was a party of four behind us that was clearly enjoying their selves because we could hear the commotion over our convo. Now our waitress arrives and takes our drink orders. Immediately, she wanted to take our orders from the menu. Mind you, we haven't been in the booth for five minutes yet. She arrives with our drinks in less than two minutes and brings forth our bread. Now, we still haven't looked decided what we wanted because it's only been a minute or two. She asked us if we're ready to order. Now I'm feeling rushed. We don't say anything. We just say we need some time! Anywho, she comes back now and we order our appetizers. Now a party of eight I wanna comes in. They are given full cooperation. They were sitting right across from us. Not only were they not rushed but they we're attended too. minutes before we got the appetizer we were asked about entrees. Now the table was small so I normally don't order my appetizer and entrees so close together. However, we were feeling rushed so we just put them in. We did not see the waitress again. We had to flag her down countless times. She passed by us multiple times not even to look and see if we're we're still living or if our food was to our satisfaction. Not once were we checked on after taking our orders. The only time we seen her again was the last time we flagged her time for the check and we ordered our dessert to go because we knew we weren't seeing her again."
Lan N.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,1.0,8/16/2017,"Food is good. The service, however, is a different story. If you're there when there are only a handful of customers, you're golden. Anymore than that, go somewhere else. Their staff is not trained to handle a half full or completely full restaurant - you won't talk to your waiter for awhile (although you will see them just hanging out talking to other waiters), once you place your order, you should probably bring a snack because you're in for an even longer wait. I absolutely do not recommend coming here when it is super crowded, when you walk in and see people waiting in line, turn around and pick another restaurant"
Josh C.,"Cambridge, MA",49,27,11,3.0,9/10/2016,"Your classic favs at the Cheesecake Factory. You can't go wrong with the food here as there are possible selections from every type of cuisine: Asian, American, Italian, etc. We got the chicken and shrimp gumbo and it was fairly tasty. Have that with white rice and you've got yourself a full meal. Appetizer was a white crab with asparagus dip. No complaints there: good old seafood dip with toasted bread. There is an issue when your server fails to notice that during your hour of dining experience that you didn't had a single utensil at your table and had to keep stealing from the adjacent table. There is an issue when the servers congregate in front of your table and you notice that your server, and EVERY one of them at this place, is chatting and taking 15 minutes to enter each order. Verdict: Came here for the food because we didn't want to eat at the food court. Knew the service would be slow given the countless previous reviews. Left knowing that we won't be back."
Janette C.,"Queens, NY",6,60,90,2.0,2/2/2017,"Didn't really enjoy my meal here. Service was a little slow, it was 12.00 lunchtime on  Wednesday and fairly quiet, but I had a wait before my order was taken, and the waiter had to come tell me my food wouldn't be long. I had the Renee's special (cup of soup, half turkey sandwich & small green salad). The soup was cream of wild mushroom, containing shitake mushrooms, it was not to my taste:  rich, strong and intense in flavour, almost like a steak sauce and quite salty. The sandwich was ok, but the salad was limp, with some of the leaves showing signs of decay as they were dissolving, the tomatoes were hard and tasteless. $3 for bottomless fountain drinks seemed a good deal and the waiter kept me topped up.  After the initial delay the waiter returned to my table twice to see if everything was ok, but I felt to awkward to say I didn't enjoy the soup. I decided against cheesecake for dessert even though that's what I went in for in the first place. $20 for soup, half a sandwich, drink & tip."
Alex M.,"Boston, MA",0,6,,5.0,2/15/2017,Whenever I come to cambridgeside galleria I switch off between this and World Of Beer. I always sit at the bar because the bartender Neurrodine is very friendly. The parmesan garlic bread is a good app to start off on. The garlic butter it is served with is very good as well. I always get a burger and for a chain restaurant the burger is pretty good. Usually come when I get out of school or have free time on my hands so if you go make sure to sit at the bar.
Ela Q.,"Boston, MA",2,21,,1.0,6/26/2017,"If I could give this place a 0 I would. Every time I've been here they've messed up our food, making us wait another 15-20 mins to get out food fixed. Last time we ended up taking the food home because we were so annoyed. The staff is rude. Seems like they don't like working there."
Dominique M.,"Chelsea, MA",21,9,,5.0,2/23/2017,Food and Prosecco was amazing! Our waitress Dana was so nice and polite made our evening so much more memorable. I had an amazing evening here with my fiancé.
Willy W.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,1.0,2/1/2017,Completely inept when placing pick up. Try the one in Back Bay instead. The management of this restaurant should change. I have placed multiple orders and they somehow 'lost' or 'didn't receive it'.  This is an incredibly poor reflection on the Cheesecake brand. Avoid.
S P.,"Saugus, MA",0,4,,1.0,3/30/2017,"ATROCIOUS!!! Never have I ever had the worst dining experience in my entire life up until last night. Our waiter (JOHN) was the utmost disgusting, rudest, and pompous individual I have ever met. He never properly introduced himself when greeting us and never asked us what we wanted for beverages. Instead he assume we wanted water and bread without a peep out of his mouth. I kindly asked for lemon and before I was able to order a cocktail he cut me off and said ""sure, I'll get you lemon"" then quickly left. By that awkward moment my friend and I decided to just settle for water since clearly he couldn't let us order drinks.  When he came back with my lemon he asked us if we were ready to order. I was extremely frustrated, but bit my tongue and ordered. My friend requested if she could have the chicken Bellagio, but instead with the Louisiana chicken and his response ""So you want fried chicken..."" with an unwelcoming tone. This was uncalled for and instead of stating the obvious he could've addressed it politely and with no attitude that way we could of had a better understanding.  Instead of leaving or requesting a new server we decided to deal with his sour personality. We proceeded to order and got 2 appetizers and 1 entree . In the past the server normally asks us if we would like the order to come out together. This man was so quick to cut us off again that we never got a chance to even ask.  He came back to drop off appetizer plates and basically slammed it on our table. He came back to drop off the 2 appetizers and not once asked us how everything was. Then before the entree even arrived he didn't bother to pick up the unused dirty plates. Eventually I just stacked the plates together thinking he could take a hint. Correct me if I am wrong, but EVERY TIME I get pasta they offer parmesan, but no he didn't. We didn't even bother to ask and didn't want to hunt down our waiter who clearly doesn't want to be there.  We barely even spoke to him throughout the entire evening. Again, he never asked us how our entree was either. He came back to the table again to give us water when we didn't need it because our cups were practically full. My friend kindly said ""Sir, would you please remove these plates."" HE CUT HER OFF of course and said ""YEAH, CAN I GIVE YOU WATER FIRST CAN I DO THIS FIRST!"" I was at disbelief of what was going on and instead of grabbing the dirty plates he instead grabbed the appetizer plate with food still on it that we were STILL WORKING ON. I didn't know what he was mad about, but he took the blame on us. We were so upset we didn't even want to continue to talk to this man so we let him grab whatever he wanted that was in front of us.  At this point we couldn't take it anymore we were livid! He came back again and said to my friend ""Are you still working on that?"" mind you she didn't have a single thing on her plate. We knew he was being a sarcastic jerk. She said ""Well what am I working on there's nothing on my plate."" He didn't deserve a kind response so we gave him a little taste of his own medicine. He proceeds to ask if he can take it while being a smart alec.  Finally he called a manager for us so we could complain about the horrendous service. She asked us if everything was okay. Clearly not. Everything was far from okay. We explained to her what had happened. She asked if we wanted a different server and we said yes. We both came out for a nice dinner so we never let his poor service ruin our evening until the moment he decided to argue with us about removing the plates from before. Midway through the evening we still didn't even know his name. After speaking to the manager he didn't even bother to come and apologize. As we left we saw him laugh at us. He was not only a terrible server, but he's a bully who is clearly not right for hospitality. No one should ever have to endure or feel as horrible as this man made us feel. This is the last time I will be dining at The Cheesecake Factory in Cambridge because he really ruined it for us and that's very unfortunate because I use to love coming here."
