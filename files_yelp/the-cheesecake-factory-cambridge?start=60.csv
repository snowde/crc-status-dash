Rather Be D.,"Cambridge, MA",0,7,,1.0,1/25/2017,"Hi - This was my dining experience.  I was dining alone. I was seated across from the waiter transaction station. The waiter brought me bread with butter. I immediately informed him that I don't eat dairy products and that if they put it in my food I would send it back. I asked him to bring me olive oil. He said ""right away"".  I waited for several minutes and watched him wait on other tables and my bread grow cold. I looked at him as he walked by and he asked me about the weather and if it was still nice out. I reminded him about the olive oil. He had forgotten. Not long thereafter I was served the grilled salmon that I had ordered. It was quite raw in the center. I showed it to the waiter who said that they served their salmon medium rare. I repeated a few times as he kept saying that that it was served medium rare that it was raw. He took it back to the kitchen. The manager came out and said it was a mistake and that they would not knowingly serve their food that way. The waiter came by and said they would give me a fresh serving. I waited for a while. Out came salmon drenched in butter, not grilled, and with pesto sauce on it. I had ordered just plain grilled salmon as it is offered on the menu, with nothing on it, and grilled.  The manager returned and denied there was butter on it, said that it was grilled, just some oil from the pesto sauce (which pesto sauce, or butter, was not on my original order.  Given that he was aggressively denying there was anything awry with the order, I said that I didn't want to argue, and just pushed the food away and put my head in my hands, as I was 99% sure that it was butter not oil. Another manager came over and asked if everything was all right. Clearly it wasn't.  I said that I was willing to pay for the meal but I did not trust it and would not eat it. I got my money back.  It is a violation of US health codes to serve uncooked fish and if the kitchen makes a mistake the second time it should not be denied.  I was taking myself out for my birthday. THANKS!"
Dorothy C.,"Redmond, WA",67,113,16,5.0,8/23/2016,"We were staying at the marlowe and since it was between cheesecake factory or P.Fake Chang's, We decided to choose the former. The host & hostess had their backs turned to us upon coming in. They saw us but continued to joke around before acknowledging & seating us. First impression could have been better, but whatever.  Our server Eduardo came right away and served us drinks & bread. We ordered an app and two entrees plus a side of mashed potatoes. Everything arrived in good time except for the mashed potatoes. I was told it would be right out, then 5 min later was told they ran out and would take 20 minutes to make. I didn't mind because I was super desperate and craving mashed potatoes. I could wait.. i would have waited all night if I had to. 10 min later the manager came over and said it would take another 15 min. He apologized, made the mashed potatoes complimentary, and even made one of our entrees complimentary (I did not expect that at all!). We ordered the godiva cheesecake while we waited, then eduardo brought out hot and fresh mashed potatoes in a takeout container.. Not one, but TWO heaping portions! It was the highlight of my day. We tipped him as if the bill hadn't been altered (not his fault they ran out of mashed potatoes) and went on our merry way. Thank you!"
Nitya R.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,19,3,1.0,6/5/2016,"Came here with my friend on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The place was pretty packed but everyone being given a table quicker than expected.  The food took forever to come! Waited for over 45 minutes. People beside us got tired of waiting and left, and some others were heard arguing with the manager for late service.   When we finally got our food after a constant 'food will be out in 5 minutes', my Evelyn's favorite pasta was still raw and the food my friend ordered without mushroom had mushroom!  Had to send back my food (& cancelled that order) and picked out mushroom and ate it.  Overall the worst experience ever in The Cheesecake Factory. Never have I ever experienced such bad service or average food here."
Jane L.,"Brighton, MA",199,116,2565,4.0,8/16/2015,"I like franchised restaurants. I know a lot of you guys will judge/criticize me but I believe there should be a reason why a certain restaurant became a chain restaurant. I like the standardized dishes that I can have the same quality of food regardless of where I go. There are several dishes that I really like - chicken salad, meatloaf, carbonara pasta, and American burger. Big portion is a plus too. But the highlight is the cheesecake after the main meal. Different selections of cheesecakes makes you to come here even more often. Service in this location was great."
DuJuan S.,"Ludington, MI",2,14,7,5.0,5/1/2016,"Although my last visit over 2 years ago (15 or so years before that...hey..id written off chains..been Chef 25 years..and..I'm picky) was...I'll just say not fun..no fault on the establishment whatsoever...the two things I could remember about Cheesecake Factory was thier cozy yet artistic furnishings and their amazing food! I honestly forgot what I had back then but during a staycation with my fiancee we decided to do lunch there as we where in the area..  What's there NOT to say? First off..of normally take pictures before I eat..yeah right...looked to good and it just didn't last guys...sorry.. Awesome plate of Salmon with Shrimp Scampi and Mashed Potatoes with surprisingly PERFECTLY cooked Zucchini..the Queen had a huge Cobb Salad she couldn't finish..the Egg Roll Sampler with assorted sauce app..damn...as I'm seriously typing right now, I could use some of those... The place is clean in and out..wait staff move like machines...love it.. Our waitress Nancy has been...no lie one of the friendliest and attentive wait staff I've dealt with in the last several months...requested a Sunnyside up egg along with my meal?..no worries...yes...if we are ever there again..I'm asking for her..she actually gets it..and does it with a huge smile!! Hope you're reading this CF...she really made that part of our day great. Salute Nancy! Keep it up guys..we didn't do dessert..have wedding outfits to get ready for... But we'll be back.."
Vivian C.,"Boston, MA",126,1439,14550,4.0,4/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has a new long and skinny menu insert listing their new SkinnyLicious® Menu.  As a lover of variety, I decided to order two of those to make up my evening's meal. We were then asked if we'd like bread and butter - and miss their yummy honey wheat?  Silly question!  But plates were MIA so I ate mine on top of a napkin. WARM ASPARAGUS SALAD $6.95 Oven Roasted Tomatoes, Pine Nuts, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Lemon and Parmesan Cheese, Topped with a Sunny Side Up Egg ROASTED PEAR AND BLUE CHEESE FLATBREAD $6.50 Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions Sound good?  Yup, sounds good.  And they were pretty good, yet petite, though reasonable for the price.  I ate it all though, so a heavier eater would need something more. I also picked up some dessert for later.  A tiramisu cheescake that was light and not too sweet, and their Lemoncello layer cake $7.95.  If you like lemon, and you like your sweets not toooooooo sweet, you just might like this one. 3 stars *** 1/2016 *** We were seated in the bar area shortly after 5:30pm, and lucky us, we discovered that they have a bar menu now!  From 4pm - 6pm on Monday - Fridays, they offer 18 items for $5.50 apiece. The three of us picked a number of dishes to share and had ourselves a good time and meal. . Avocado Eggrolls served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce $10.95 (regular menu price) . Fried Macaroni and Cheese crispy crumb coated Macaroni and Cheese balls, served over creamy marinara sauce $10.95 . Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke served with a spicy vinaigrette and garlic dip . Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes topped with sour cream, salsa, cilantro, avocado and salsa verde $10.95 . Southern Fried Chicken Sliders crispy fried chicken breast on mini-buns, served with lettuce, tomato and pickles $9.95 . Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip a delicious blend of crab, artichokes and cheese served warm with grilled bread $11.95 We particularly enjoyed the sweet and savory of the tamale cakes, while finding the fire roasted artichokes a rather messy experience as water dripped down our arms. Five probably would have fit our appetites a bit better along with a loaf or two of their wonderful honey-wheat.  Four if we had planned to save room for a slice or two of their delicious creamy cheesecakes. 4 stars"
Claude A.,"Brockton, MA",0,22,8,2.0,8/14/2016,The food here is superb. worth trying because it is in a convenient location after all. Beautiful decor and chill atmosphere. The only reason I'm giving it a two is because the service was God awful I sat with my girl at the bar and the barkeep looked disinterested and over all unhappy. We were ignored at times and it was off putting.
Renee W.,"Dorchester, MA",0,6,,3.0,11/27/2016,I ordered the almond encrusted salmon salad to go.  Its a good healthy option. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake as well....of course that was delicious!  The salad was tasty. They added the multi grain bread with butter which I loved! Overall: The order came out in a timely manner. My only concern was that they did not put plastic utensils in the bag or even offer them. I also noticed that when I looked at my bank statement there was a little more charged to my account than there should be. It should have been finalized with a 15% tip added but it finalized for a few cents to almost a dollar more I think....I am hoping that was a mistake. Next time I will use cash.
Anna G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,13,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Everything was exceedingly slow and people were unresponsive. I had to ask for water three times. They didn't bring out my three year old's pasta & butter (pasta and butter!!!) until more than 15 minutes after the rest of us were served. My son's kids' meal consisted of four tiny chicken strips, not nearly enough for any normal kid to be satisfied. The manager made me feel like I was inventing the problem but if so, why was he stopping by every table in our row? It sucked for everyone. Then the waitress brought me a bill and told me the manager had comped my son's chicken strips, but what was comped was the replacement dish they brought out, even though I hadn't requested one--how generous (eyeroll). I made myself clear to the waitress and manager and ended up having both the strips and the pasta removed from the check. But you should not have to advocate for yourself just to get the bare minimum of timely service and appropriate portions."
M G.,"Newport Beach, CA",6,28,11,1.0,10/25/2016,"We've been to cheesecake factories in other parts of the country.  You can generally count on consistently good food and service.  But lately we have been going a lot less because the service tends to be slow and we get tired of waiting. This one though seems to need a new manager - unless I completely misunderstood him. The restaurant was mostly empty.  We walked in the door and the manager greated us tersely - almost like he was ready for a fight. We let him know my wife and I would be meeting our son and asked if we could be seated at a booth if it was available. He let us know it wasn't and had the hostess seat us at a two-person table. A little weird, but we asked to be reseated and, after checking, the hostess seated us at a 4-person. Our waitress was great.  Quickly taking our order and updating it when our son arrived.  Food came out fine and was delicious. But then we ordered dessert. Initially the hostess came and let us know that would be a little longer than normal (10 minutes) because they had to cook new shortbread.  After the 10 minutes went by she came and apologized again and told us it probably be more like 20. After another 20 minutes went by she came and apologized again saying sorry is taking so long.  Finally the manager comes out and says that they burnt the shortbread. He didn't offer an explanation, no offer of a different desert, no apology, no nothing. More like we just waisted your time but ""tough luck""."
Alexa B.,"Malden, MA",0,2,,4.0,2/22/2017,"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend. Wendy was our server and she is one of the best I've ever had. She was sweet, attentive and took very good care of me with my order and allergies. Our food took a little longer than it should have but with my allergies it's expected. She is a great addition to your staff and I will be coming back and requesting her. Thank you Wendy !"
Amy T.,"Chesterfield, NH",22,21,9,2.0,8/3/2016,"The food was as expected but the service was absolutely terrible. We waited over 25 minutes for somebody to acknowledge us at our table, The drinks took forever to arrive and were wrong, and then our food arrived with an extra meal... Better than no meal but we had to wait for a burger for 10 more minutes.  Not excited sbout going back... And this was at 5:30 with very few tables occupied."
Stephanie V.,"Somerville, MA",1,3,,1.0,5/25/2017,"Today I had the worse experience at cheesecake. I went there with a friend and took her out for lunch for her birthday - we both order a salad. Once we received the salad there was a piece of hair in it. It was so disgusting! We told the waiter, she took back the salad and she spoke to her manager about it. They was able to bring us a new salad but still charged us for both. The manager didn't bother apologizing to us, which was very disappointing. I wouldn't recommend going to this particular cheesecake factory . Their customer service is terrible."
Pierre B.,"Malden, MA",180,55,57,5.0,12/13/2015,"Overall great experience!!! Considering how busy it was- the food came out in rather good time, it was hot and most importantly delicious!!! Compliments to the kitchen staff tonight!  My gf and I enjoyed our dining experience and feel that this is the best location in the state and would gladly recommend it. The menu is huge and I would guarantee there is something in there for everyone to love. Tonight I had the picatta and the lady had the jambalaya... Both very delicious..."
Jonathan P.,"Ewa Beach, HI",107,1,5,3.0,7/4/2015,"Seated promptly, waitress friendly and food was expected. However, the wait for food was long, albeit today is July 4th, even though they did not seem short staffed both on the floor or kitchen. I had ordered the hibachi steak which was a tad on the sweet side, but cooked as I ordered (medium well), however a bit too charred, and the Wasabi mashed potatoes complimented each other."
Ashley B.,"Kennesaw, GA",7,73,47,5.0,9/25/2016,We really enjoyed ourselves here. Our waitress was very nice and helped us navigate the menu. I got the meatloaf and hubby got the jambalaya pasta. My meatloaf was tasty but for some reason I couldn't help eating my husbands pasta. That pasta was spicy and delicious. Next time we are in Boston we will be back to this place. PS before this visit he had gotten the jambalaya pasta in Franklin TN and it was horrible; he was very skeptical to get it a second thine but this time he was not di
Rachel L.,"Malden, MA",30,271,21,3.0,2/13/2016,"A solid meeeeeeh. I remember coming here all the time few years back; I was younger and I used to love the place. Came here a couple weeks ago after hitting up the mall (like the good old days) and we decided to have dinner here. Waited a few minutes for a table, waited probably 10 minutes just to get water, and then another few minutes to place our order, and then another 15 or so minutes to get 6 pot stickers. Lame, since it wasn't even that busy. The meal/food was good, just not so much the service. Super rip off for the pot stickers, but I mean - what I get for ordering them, yah? Anyways, the meal was fine - the boy got spaghetti and meatballs and I got the skinnylicious ceaser salad. You can't mess that up. Will probably be back during another mall trip. But won't go out of my way for it."
Carlos P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/21/2016,"We waited more than 20 minutes for the receipt after paying in cash. I had to chase the waitress to get. After we finally got it, we didn't get the change."
Lyndsey C.,"Sterling, VA",231,982,173,3.0,10/13/2014,"I am just not a Cheesecake Factory fan, really, but my mother in law loves it so I always try to take her from time to time... the wait staff is nice enough and the food is fresh and good... as always and with any CF, the menu is quite large and portions are huge...  The outside area has been nice to sit at. Overall, I don't have anything against CF, it is just a major chain to me... you get a lot of tourists at this location but they have decent service, etc."
Erina S.,"Boston, MA",48,2,,1.0,9/25/2016,"I ordered a red velvet whole cheese cake for my friend's birthday. The next day I pick it up and go to my friend's birthday party just to find out the cake was already cut. If I'd had known, I would have got the whole cake from somewhere else and I don't think I'd had to pre-order to get the already cut slices. This is so dumb and annoying."
