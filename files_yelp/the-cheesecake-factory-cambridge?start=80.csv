Lilly P.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,41,14,1.0,11/29/2015,"I wish I could give zero stars.  First off I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory, but the service here was so bad I am likely to never return. I don't know if it was a race thing (we are a bi-racial couple) or if our server just decided that we were not worth taking care of. But after the server brought over our drinks (he even brought diet instead of regular) he didn't come back to take our orders. He visited the table next to us, 3 times before finally we flagged him down to take our order. We waited an extremely long time to get our food and when it was served it was barely warm like it waited a long time in the window before being served.  We never did get a refill on our sodas, we asked for our meals to be boxed up. He brought out two boxes and a bag to us, we boxed up our own leftovers.  He then picked up the leftovers at the table behind us and boxed those up in the kitchen for them, and presented them to the couple.  The place was empty, he wasn't busy, the server had three tables with two people at each table. He blatantly ignored us, we normally order coffee and cheesecake after, but we'd already been there for two hours and decided that it wasn't worth the wait.  What a sad start to our Boston trip!"
Jason A.,"Athol, MA",44,63,10,1.0,12/17/2014,"We showed up after a day at the museum of science back in october around 5 pm.  Now there was 10 of us and the wait wasnt long.  So they get a star for that. Our waiter did a solid job and they get another star for that. Food - sucked.  I had some kind of chicken sandwich w avacado.  Taste was ok but the bread was extremely hard. One of my daughters order the kids cheese pizza.  Worst thing ive ever seen and I wouldnt feed it to a dog.  And Im not an animal lover.  The thing was falling apart on the plate.  Just flat out pathetic to ever call it a pizza.  I flat out will never order actual food from there again.  Im sure my wife wil force me in for dessert, I hope thats better than their pizza. Now that ive remembered how bad that pizza was I have to take away a star ugh"
Michael B.,"San Diego, CA",0,40,,1.0,11/15/2015,"I've been to many cheesecake factories across the country. Some good, others not so much and many in between.  Here for business and dropped in because typically the food is predictable in terms of quality. This place however is absolutely abysmal. Tried the calamari and chicken teriyaki . I can't put into words how woeful they were."
Kylie S.,"Brookline, MA",79,21,,2.0,1/29/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and I'm very brand loyal but I am ALWAYS disappointed when I visit this location. I recommend going to the one in the Prudential Center if you can. The workers here are very rude. There have been multiple occasions where the front desk hosts and hostesses are very unprofessional--i.e. not paying attention when I come up to the desk, not being friendly, turning me away saying they can't help me when I forgot something on the table. I've also noticed that around the holiday times one worker was on her phone facetiming when she was sitting at a table to sell giftcards--this was very uninviting and very rude. The servers are more friendly but just very slow usually, especially when they are packed. BUT the food is always standardized (because it's a chain) and pretty good."
Vallerie L.,"Lawrence, MA",46,4,5,5.0,2/25/2015,"Love this location! The food was great AS ALWAYS. Love the consistency of the quality food & service they provide. Sometimes even chain restaurants aren't consistent, which is understandable because everything is fresh at the CF. I always get the Buffalo Blasts as an appetizer (which in turn makes me take home over half of my entree.. Yay for leftovers) and the lemon meringue cheesecake was.. Beyond words. Still dreaming of Buffalo Blasts and Lemon Meringue Cheesecake today. Go try them!"
Samantha L.,"Potomac, MD",1908,1022,9453,4.0,12/4/2014,"Tonight, there wasn't a wait for dinner. Our waitress was very warm and friendly as she asked if we had any questions about the menu or needed anything through our dinner. As soon as we sat down, our waitress brought water for the table. After we ordered, the waitress brought a basket of two kinds of bread - baguette and pumpernickel with butter. The bread served cool / room temperature. I love their frozen drinks / smoothies. I ordered a  Tropical Smoothie which consisted of  mango, passion fruit, pineapple, coconut and ice. It had a thick consistency so it came with a wide straw. The Tropical Smoothie was garnished with strawberry, lime slice, and orange slice. For appetizers, we shared the Avocado Egg Rolls which consisted of avocado and red peppers in wonton skin and deep fried. The Avocado Egg Rolls came with sweet tamarind-cashew sauce, over a bed of crispy white noodles, garnished with grated fresh parsley. My mom ordered the Chicken Marsala which came with bowtie pasta and garnished with fresh parsley. My dad ordered the Pasta with Chicken in Scampi sauce. The Scampi sauce was cheesy and creamy garlic sauce. This dish came with tender chicken and diced tomatoes. I ordered the Miso Salmon which came with a large filet of salmon, five snow peas, over a bed of white rice, and in a sweet miso sauce. My brother ordered the Lemon Garlic Shrimp, which was five large shrimp, sautéed in basil, tomato, lemon garlic sauce, and wirh asparagus and angel hair pasta. Every dish was flavorful in it's own way. We enjoyed everything we ordered!"
Tina G.,"Revere, MA",104,43,13,5.0,12/21/2015,"Paco P! Thank you for the incredibly attentive and knowledgable service!  I enjoyed a quick bite to eat after work.  Paco suggested a few things on the menu and I am very glad I chose the southwestern jalapeño guacamole chicken sandwich and he suggested a great Sauvignon Blanc to compliment!  Quick, delicious and has restored my faith in a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory."
Thomas N.,"Townsend, MA",1,543,,5.0,6/5/2016,"ok, just 3 stars??????? have been here a few times and it has always been good, we had lunch recently, ate at the bar, the drinks were good (their specials) the bacon burger with a side green salad was great, wife had the greek salad (she ordered the beet salad but i think the noise at the bar caused some confusion) and the mini crab cakes ( good and very good), service was fine by a very busy bartender even though it was not a full restaurant, decor was nice and outside seating was full........so we liked it all!!!"
Kamran N.,"Jersey City, NJ",59,237,23,4.0,10/19/2015,We went here for lunch and ordered a chicken cream soup to share for starter: The soup was simply amazing. The bread on the side was nice and hot and the whole experience was great. For our mains we had two burgers: I had Kobe burger. It was nice but I didn't realise that the onion on the burger is caramalised onion. On the menu it mentioned with onion and that was the reason I wanted this burger. There is something about fresh onion and burger that make the combination magical. That was the only thing missing from overall experience. Other than that everything was great. We didn't have any space to try the cheesecake although they looked great and wish to try them in our next visit.
Kelvin N.,"Bethesda, MD",33,9,,1.0,5/1/2015,"LARGE GROUPS SHOULD AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS. When a restaurant deserves only one star despite serving above-average food, either the service, location, or prices are exceptionally unreasonable. Here, it's the service. THREE confirmations of a single reservation for 30 people were insufficient to convince the manager that the customer really values the reservation, and highly respects the restaurant, knowing how popular and busy it can be. Over the phone, the manager promised 2 tables of 15, only to split us into 4 tables of unequal size all over the restaurant. Actions speak louder than words; how the inability to honor such a concept earned the manager his position is utterly revealing of the restaurant's leadership. Arrogance and complacency do overshadow respect for the customer - this restaurant is an epitome of that. Alas, as long as the business continues to thrive with small groups, such a spacious restaurant will ironically need miracles to properly handle large groups."
Roland G.,"Boston, MA",71,22,1,2.0,6/26/2016,"The cheesecake factory in Cambridge seems to be a good place to meet, because of the parking facility. The restaurant itself however, can be a bit like a food factory. Avoid being seated near the kitchen... Even when not busy, the level of noise is quite unreasonable.  When I informed the workers at the hostess desk, all I got was a reply of I'm sorry.  Simply, just go elsewhere."
Domenic G.,"Chelmsford, MA",91,53,,3.0,8/10/2016,I used to love this place but other chains have caught up and wait is long. I love their food except the Fish Tacos. Don't get them. I love their cheesecake but enough calories in one as your daily calorie intake so not an option most days.
Jean M.,"Carver, MA",1,77,20,5.0,7/17/2016,This is the best location in and around boston my opinion! Always a friendly staff and food is always perfect. Once we are done eating we can shop:) a girls too fav things all in one stop.
Lucy E.,"Atlanta, GA",293,19,86,2.0,10/21/2015,"Food is always good at Cheesecake Factory. We came a bit early as a group for food and drinks.  Service was fine.  The awkward thing is an employee who I'm assuming is supposed to greet customers as they come in the restroom, which is weird because the bathroom is really small so she is more of an obstruction rather than a symbol of hospitality.. But anyway I walk in, she's sitting on top of a bench, she looks at me then proceeds to continue looking at her phone. I felt uncomfortable using the restroom so I mess on my phone for a while, 5 mins later she's still on her phone so I leave and she doesn't say anything. I thought this was really weird and uncomfortable. I didn't know if she was a restroom greeter or just avoiding work...."
Rena M.,"Portland, OR",159,181,21,4.0,8/1/2014,"I'm not a fan of restaurants with huge waits, but if you go here on a weekday or at lunch time, usually you won't have to wait that long.  I went here with my boyfriend the other night and I was very happy with their new ""Skinnylicious"" menu. I got a delicious roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread that was under 490 calories! He got the bang bang chicken which was really good too! Our waiter, Nicholas, was awesome! Great service and gave us great cheesecake recommendations. The reason I'm taking away one star is because one time I came here for brunch and had to wait over an hour for my food to arrive- but my most recent experience was a good one!"
Cristian S.,"Somerville, MA",0,4,,2.0,12/27/2016,"I've been going to cheesecake for years with family and friends, I was there for my birthday in November. I decided to step in for a meal the day before Christmas Eve and it might just be the worst experience I've ever had at cheesecake to this day."
Lloyd W.,"Boston, MA",69,4,13,5.0,8/20/2015,It's always a great time here at the Cheesecake Factory today I ordered the crispy chicken costoletta
Amanda C.,"Brighton, MA",1,10,1,2.0,5/14/2016,"I usually have a good experience at the Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location has horrible service. Won't be coming back here."
Ciro D.,"Revere, MA",0,4,,4.0,11/17/2016,"It's a beautiful place, and the food is pretty good. The hamburgers are awesome, and I think it's the best that I have ever tried in us. At the same time, they have an awful service. The host was extremely rude, and she didn't even say hi to me and my girlfriend. She just brought us to sit at the dirtiest table that the restaurant had that night. While the waiters are okay. If the owner fire that host, I would give 5 stars to that restaurant."
Victoria G.,"Seattle, WA",1,37,8,2.0,9/27/2015,"First, the good... The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is really good, and a huge portion. I'd say it can easily feed 3-4 people. Throw in bread, apps, drinks and dessert and you'll leave stuffed. Their drinks are decent, and their apps are nice to try. Their cheesecake list is very large, and has something for everybody although I find them wayyyy too sweet. Now, for the bad... I used to love their Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and would get it every time I went. Last time I got it, it looked nothing like it did every other time. There were only 4 small pieces of tuna, a much smaller bed of lettuce (and wilted), one slice of tomato and 2 incredibly thin slices of avocado, a big heaping of ginger and then the side of dressing. I noticed they had raised the price by a few dollars as well. I was very disappointed but the waitress insisted this was how it was. Although I told her I've had the dish many times she seemed lost for words and did nothing. I expressed my disappointment later to management and they offered to mail me a voucher in the amount of the dish as they agreed that's not how it was supposed to come out. I never got the voucher. Last time I was here, my bf and I wanted to try two new appetizers, one of which was the chicken pot stickers. He has several food allergies, and asked what was in the chicken pot stickers. The waitress looked at us incredulously and said ""ummm...chicken?"" like we were a bunch of idiots. She looked right at me when I told her we needed to know if there was anything else in there because he has food allergies. She just stood there and stared, so my bf further clarified that sometimes there are other things in pot stickers, like carrots and cabbage, both of which he is allergic to. She finally said ""oh! you should have told me you had allergies! so do you want the pot stickers or do you want me to ask the chef what's in them?"" We obviously wanted to know what's in them, why else would we ask??? Maybe I will return to the Cheesecake Factory for the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, but only if at a different location."
