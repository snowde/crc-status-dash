Caryn P.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",3,25,23,5.0,1/5/2018,Great food and cheesecake!  But long line on Friday night and won't take reservations after 5 pm. We waited an hour. My fried shrimp was delicious.  Good atmosphere but music too loud to enjoy conversation!  Sara was an excellent waiter and gave us wonderful service and was willing to split the bill into three checks!
Che B.,"West Hills, CA",2,77,17,1.0,12/30/2017,"This 1 star is specifically for your bar tender working at 3:45 on Saturday the 30th. Dark hair- all I can say is she was so rude I wanted to fire her myself. Horrible service, doesn't smile! I asked for a water to go and she gave me the dirtiest look and then handed it to me with her fingers all over my straw and didn't say your welcome or anything! There are a ton of people who need jobs fire her and hire Someone who will treat your customers right!  She has terrible customer service and honestly ruined my experience. I will take my business else where!"
Nadia G.,"San Diego, CA",4213,331,209,5.0,12/21/2017,I have been to many Cheesecake Factories in different states and especially all over California over the years. This is by far the best experience I have had at a Cheesecake Factory. They excel at customer service compared to the others.  We were seated quickly which never happens and our waitress was excellent. She was on top of it when we needed drink refills and she was attentive without being intrusive. The food was good - the usual of what you get at any Cheesecake Factory.
Nikki K.,"Los Angeles, CA",995,100,225,3.0,12/5/2017,"I'm torn between giving this location a two or three star review. I understand that all Cheesecake Factory's are extremely busy, especially on the weekends, but that should not compromise the service of the staff. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by two hosts backs turned towards us. One of the girls turned around, looked directly at us and continued her non-work related conversation with her co worker. When she finally had the time to do her job, she ""welcomed"" us by curtly asking, ""how many?"" I asked her how long the wait would be for a party of 2, and she let out a sigh looked around and said maybe 10 minutes. I put our name down and we waited on the side of the host's stand.  I was extremely upset with the host's attitude and lack of customer service skills. I understand that everyone has bad days or that you may not like your job, but it's very obvious when there is absolutely no effort being put into your job. We were very fortunate to have a very polite and friendly server named Daryl. He instantly changed my mood when he greeted us with warm fresh bread and promptly took our orders. The food was delicious and Daryl went above and beyond to turn our dining experience around.  If you dine in at this Cheesecake Factory's location, beware of the rude service from the hosts!"
Evelina C.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",388,399,369,3.0,11/1/2017,"Always super busy and the service is not always the best. It can be really hard to find a table during busy hours so if you are celebrating - definitely reserve a table. Happy hour windows are super slight and the menu is not great at all. To be honest not worth it for food. The happy hour portions are two pieces. One for him one for her.  Our favorite is the habachi steak, my hubby loves it and introduced me- rare with Wasabi mashed potatoes. DELICIOUS.  Our server was cool. But not very attentive and efficient.  Wish I didn't have to ask for my water to be filled- time in and time out. But other than that, sure we'll eat here on occasion."
Tally S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,37,14,4.0,1/9/2018,I love Cheesecake Factory but the chicken piccata was not my favorite dish. I really enjoyed the lemon sauce and pasta but the chicken was not the best. The celebration cheesecake was the best cake I have ever had. I definitely recommend the celebration cheesecake.
Kimberly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",583,102,162,4.0,12/24/2017,Came here Saturday before Christmas for brunch. It was busy but only had to wait 10 min for a table. Always love the complimentary warm bread they bring out. I opted for breakfast spinach egg benedict & my husband got burger & fries. They had messed up on my order at first but my waiter was quick to let me know that the server picked up the wrong plate. My husbands fries were cold when they brought out his food. We didn't get any cheesecake this time but my favorite is the Oreo!
Aaron F.,"Mesa, AZ",240,101,101,5.0,1/3/2018,"What can you say about the world famous cheesecake factory. Be careful ordering as the serving sizes are generous. If you eat too much, you won't have room for that desert you deserve."
Jenny R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",149,71,106,4.0,12/29/2017,"I go to this Cheesecake Factory a lot mainly because of its convenient location. Food is good but the servers take a long time with the food , maybe because they were very busy with the holiday season"
Lola W.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,62,17,4.0,11/23/2017,"Stopped by for a quick lunch Friday afternoon and was able to be seated right away. This Cheesecake Factory is located on the outside of the mall with entrance from the parking lot. I always find it odd that parking is a little tricky for this location given it's located by the parking lot.  This location seems clean and well kept. The servers were really nice and offered to take our drink order right away. Bread and butter was brought to the table promptly. Once we placed our orders, we didn't wait long for our food. My all-time favorite items at Cheesecake are avocado egg rolls and buffalo wings. While the menu offers much yummier items, for me, those two are favoriteeee. Which means I order them at each location and judge each location how well they can prepare those items. Oddly enough, yes they do vary in flavor, freshness, etc. The avocado egg rolls were amazing, super fresh. Fresh avocado and really well made. Chicken wings were good too, I personally think they were better/crispier at The Grove location.  Another items I tried this particular day was chicken madeira, which is their most popular item, or so it says so on their menu. Anyway, it was really good. Chicken was juicy and not dry at all, super filling too.  Overall one of the better locations for Cheesecake Factory."
Leslie A.,"Canoga Park, CA",37,150,179,2.0,11/29/2017,"First time coming to The Cheesecake Factory since they made the move over from the Warner Center.  *Deep Sigh* What happened guys? Like... what were you guys thinking? When The Cheesecake Factory was located in Warner Center it was worth going to. It felt fancy AF in there. It was clean, the outside seating was beautiful, & it stood on it's own. It was FUN to go out & have a date night. Now... it sucks. It's located on probably the worst side of the mall by the old Sears. ""Outside"" seating is just a joke. You get either: a beautiful view of the Valet Parking lot, so you can watch the snobs too lazy to find parking on their own pay $15. Or you can choose plan B of their outdoor seating by having a beautiful view of the MALL. & by view of the mall, I mean all you see is an old Sears, Wetzels Pretzels, & Forever 21. WTF? Again, what was the thought process here? While I'm sure sales are up because of the foot traffic, the quality has gone doooown. This place is Sizzler quality now. Sucks. Find somewhere else to buy a $20 bowl of chicken."
Annie W.,"Anaheim, CA",677,75,458,5.0,11/14/2017,"It's Cheesecake Factory, so of course it's good! The funny thing is every time I come here, I'm so full from their delicious food, that I don't get dessert! Awesome place to come from happy hour! 4-6pm in the bar area only! (Tip: The low two top tables in the bar are seat yourself until 6pm) They have a bunch of great appetizers that are around $5 and few cocktails and draft beers also on special! Some of our favorite appetizers to get are: Avocado Egg Rolls Potstickers  Sliders We also love to split the Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic (it's more calories than one person should probably consume at once) and then get a few small plates to share!  Right now we love the taquitos & Nashville Hot Nuggets! Perfect spot for date night, outing with friends, or happy hour!"
Denese V.,"West Hills, CA",15,70,203,2.0,9/4/2017,"Today was the 3rd time I've been to Cheesecake Factory. Each time I have gotten something different and I'm always disappointed. It's not the location or the service, it's the food. I have tried different things each time I've gone and I've found the food to be very bland and boring. The cheesecake is also mediocre at best. This place is way overrated and overpriced.  I don't mind waiting for a table or paying more if the food is good but this place is so not worth my time or money. No plans at all to go back."
Rena H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",971,792,4678,5.0,7/14/2017,"It's been a while since I wrote a 5 star review for Cheesecake Factory even though I go here almost 1x a month.   Their service, food and cleanliness are excellent.  Whenever I'm done with Cheesecake Factory, I have enough left overs to last me 2 days.   I love this place!!!!"
K H.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/9/2018,Love eatting at this place. I enjoy eatting at this place. I would definitely recommend people to eat at this location! Great
Matias P.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",26,49,109,3.0,11/10/2017,I've come to Cheesecake Factory a handful of times and this place is always PACKED! Not sure why you can't make reservations ahead of time at such a nice looking spot. Their food is ok. Not many WOW factor dishes. Their service is also ok.  Takes way too long to get your food.  If you do come here you should try their Mac and cheese fried balls. To die for.
Cheri N.,"West Hills, CA",24,194,1647,5.0,7/23/2017,"We love Cheesecake Factory on Topanga.  Friday night we were celebrating my daughter's 11th birthday.  We were an intimate party of six, walked in at 6pm and were immediately seated.  Wow!   This is the second time at this location where we had no wait but it seemed busy.   I love that! The food as usual was great.   Ordered a new item called chicken Parmesan ""pizza style"" and it was delish.  I also love their basic tossed salad with blue cheese dressing.  Their dressings are flavorful, thick, and rich.  The best dressing here is the blue cheese with thick chunks of blue cheese all through out. On the down side: The artichokes appetizer went up in price to $11.95 for one and a half artichokes and last night it was undercooked, tough, and over charred.   The mayo dressing dip was ok but I liked the balsamic that they used to serve with a tender fire toasted choke.    Also, the sourdough bread was tough, it seemed day old and a bit stale.  Boo! On the up side: Loved the cheesecake and other deserts; they made my girl's birthday special with a decorated desert plate, candle, and song.  Sweet! Although the parking is vast at this location, it can be a nightmare to walk through the mall parking lot since there are a lot of zig zag rows and many drivers moving about.    They also offer valet if you'd rather just avoid the stupid parking lot."
Monica M.,"Sylmar, CA",64,88,304,4.0,10/8/2017,"Best thing to do on a busy Saturday night is send someone from your party to reserve a table while you continue to shop, you'll get a txt when your table is up next.  About 45 minutes later we got a txt and heard over to CF. We all ordered lemonades, I had the cucumber lemonade and it's a little to sweet but nothing some water mixed in can't help. This visit our waitress was on point, she kept the refills coming and checked on us often.  I tried my hunny and my daughter's plate and I must say the chicken n biscuits is to die for."
Lovely B.,"Calabasas, CA",48,43,13,5.0,1/5/2018,"Yummy.. and great service:) The menu has so many wonderful options, amd everything Ive ordered over the last year has been yummy! Good job, keep being great!"
Jason S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1285,137,507,4.0,9/8/2017,"Not bad for a afternoon snack. Food looks good  and tastes great. If your on this side of town or at the mall, stop in and grab a seat. Oh and yes parking is good."
Esther C.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,8,2,4.0,11/29/2017,Ate here for my birthday with my parents and boyfriend. As usual they were packed so service (although they were very nice) was lacking. It was hard to flag down our waiter.  However the dishes I tried were fantastic. We ordered two dishes off of their specialties menu (new dishes that they are testing the waters with). I forget the exact name but it had Asian influences and contained chicken and pineapples. I didn't fall in love with it but my boyfriend raved about it afterwards for a long time. Next we ordered the carne asada medallions. Delicious! Absolutely recommend it for the next time you go. Lastly we ordered the fresh strawberry cheesecake. No complaints there. They wrote happy birthday and I was ecstatic.
Jamie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,399,1196,5.0,4/16/2017,"Been here enough times to make me a Yelp Regular.  Woo Hoo!   Things I recommend: Fish and Chips Fried Shrimp Platter Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps Fried Calamari Old Fashion Cheeseburger Chicken Bellagio Chicken Piccata Eggs Benedict Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta Any Cheesecake, duh. I had the Fish Tacos once.   No bueno.  Everything else has been consistently good.  Service is always good.  Nice restaurant inside.  One of my favorite places (to get fat). I wanted Fish and Chips but I also wanted some Fried Shrimp.  Fat guy craving fried food, imagine that.  They don't offer a combo of these two.  They really should, people would go nuts.  So, the Queen of Reseda's #2 daughter and I split the two dishes.  It was perfect. Here's a hot tip for you.  I asked the waiter how many pieces of fish you get with the lunch portion apposed to the regular order.  There's about a $3.00 or $4.00 difference between the two.  He said they both come with the same (4) pieces of fish.  The regular order just comes with more fries!  I never eat all the fries anyway, who does?"
Dinah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,141,416,5.0,9/9/2017,"Another wonderful experience at this C.F. location, we came around 11:30 am in a Saturday.  Perfect timing bc no wait time and able to sit near the back with view of the mall, which is fine with me bc I have a very active toddler. We order various small plates (chicken samosa, chicken taquitos, tuna tartare,  tomato, basil flat bread), Asian chicken salad and the hazelnut cheese cake to go. Our server, Jerry with supporting staff like Daryll were all great with customer service. I would have given 4 stars due to portion sizes were a little smaller than what I remembered however the overall staff made for it in attentiveness."
Michael T.,"Tarzana, CA",306,174,25,5.0,9/5/2017,"I had a hard time giving a chain restaurant like The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars... but I try to give fair grades based on expectations and on what they are.  While this isn't ""as good as it gets"" compared to an amazing local restaurant with amazing ambience... when you go to a Cheesecake Factory, you have certain expectations of what you're getting... and for a Cheesecake Factory... this IS ""as good as it gets"", therefore... 5 stars. While the food and beverages are amazing and the menu is GIANT, a visit to The Cheesecake Factory isn't cheap... so it's not an everyday place to go for my family.  It has become a tradition for us to visit this location on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.  I look forward to it every year!  This location is nice and relaxing.  The wait staff is very nice.  In the past I've gotten a beer at the bar while my wife did some shopping, and it was very nice.  I highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip and the southwestern egg rolls for appetizers!   Despite the name and what they're famous for... we rarely get cheesecake because we opt for the appetizers over the dessert and are too full for dessert. I just really enjoy this place."
Karen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,18,1.0,12/29/2017,"Don't know what all the hype is about. Went in today at 4:30pm with my sister and they seated us quickly but the service here was poor. Our server took a while to bring out our drinks and our food was brought to us at 6pm! That's ridiculous! It was unacceptable and definitely upsetting that my pregnant sister had to wait over an hour for her food. The food wasn't even warm, food is mediocre and the cheesecakes are less than ok, you'll get a better cheesecake at Vons. This place is definitely not worth the money. Next time I want to have a nice meal with my sister or anyone else I'll go somewhere else as should you."
Aileen R.,"Canoga Park, CA",784,400,4292,4.0,2/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has variety and many options for all to eat. The wait is ridiculous at most hours of the day and night but we got lucky and on a Sunday evening and had a wait of about 30 minutes for a table for two.  I enjoyed a mac and cheese well done cheese burger.  It was unique and delicious. Our server informed us of some items that will be going off the menu the first week of February. Some of those items that I was able to remember are: hibiscus lemonade and fried avocado, zucchini and mushrooms.  Of course I had to go for a slice of cheesecake and I went with my favorite, banana creme cheesecake.  Our server was excellent, friendly and attentive and the restaurant has a fun out going feel to it. I found it to be a very busy noisy place so if your looking for a nice quiet dinner this place is not the one for you."
Johanna D.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",319,70,74,3.0,11/10/2017,Cheesecake Factory is def not in my top 5 but today I can in and got their avocado toast and let me tell you! It's amazing! I wish I had this recipe. So yummy! Lemony. Spicy. Crunchy. Super good. I'll be getting that again!
Jessie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,245,274,4.0,8/29/2017,"This review is for their happy hours only. My hubby and I really like cheesecake factory's happy hours. It's Monday through Friday 4 to 6 p.m. at this location. They have a wide variety of happy hour food items and lots of drink options as well. So far, we've tried the stuffed mushrooms, happy hour burger sliders, fries, Greek salad, and summer spring rolls. All are delicious. The soy dipping sauce for the summer rolls was really tasty and refreshing. The salad was fresh with a nice tangy dressing. The stuff mushrooms were really flavorful. The fries and the sliders were well cooked and nice. I also had the happy hour mojito. It's kind of light on alcohol, but for $5.75 it's a decent drink.  I guess the only down side is you can only do happy hours in the bar area with limited amount of tables, it usually fills up fast. If you're not there early, you will end up waiting for a while."
Akita K.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",0,2,1,4.0,1/10/2018,Love the service fast and great food and staff . I will go back to this branch for sure
Avril N.,"Chatsworth, CA",51,239,65,3.0,8/1/2017,"Best cheesecake days ever! Unless I have a gift card, this is basically the only time I'll ever come in. I gave up on their happy hour a long time ago. The coffee and cream cheesecake was delicious."
Jessica S.,"West Hills, CA",106,71,302,5.0,7/29/2017,"The food is never bad here... sometimes the service is iffy but the food always makes up for it!! They have a great vegan selection... can make several things vegetarian and a great ""low fat"" or ""skinnylicios"" menu! Selections for days!!! Always clean and always got a great tasting food."
Michelle C.,"Solvang, CA",139,5,,1.0,11/19/2017,This location has cockroaches. I watched one crawl around the front where you walk in and the staff didn't do anything about it until a manager was finally notified and was more grossed out that she had to pick it up rather then it being there in the first place. I left really grossed out.
Christeen M.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,"I waited for almost 45 min and after I got seated, all the utilities were very greasy ,smelly  and even the water cups were smelly and not even a bit clean. It was very disgusting and disappointing"
Monica M.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",311,43,46,4.0,10/21/2017,Love Cheesecake Factory. Shrimp and sausage pasta on the lunch menu is the perfect size for me. Also hubby says he's planning on going down the omelette list here. Carrot cake cheese cake is perffff. Esp with their coffee (black)
Abdul S.,"West Hills, CA",21,116,220,5.0,4/23/2017,"Within all the years of going to Cheesecake Factory the service and quality surprisingly has not gone down at all. Being in the mall the wait is longer than usual but nothing out of the ordinary. Waiters and waitresses were very helpful in providing information on the items the have to offer. The menu is HUGE so whatever you may be craving you'll be satisfied. Decided to go with Americana Cheeseburger, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Avocado Rolls, And Crab Bites. Everything was good but the burger which I found mediocre. Definitely a top choice to eat at when done shopping at the mall."
Krista K.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,124,374,4.0,5/9/2017,Good spot to grab a nice lunch or dinner near The Village. Service is quick.  Tends to be seating.. If not reservations are accepted at this location. Salads are an option. Good place for a drink or quiet eat if needed.
Pardees F.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,27,7,5.0,12/16/2017,"Juan V was our server last night and he was great! He was very polite, patient, and kind. He was also always checking in on us and offering great service which is often hard to get at busy restaurants like Cheesecake Factory. The man from the kitchen who brought our food was also so kind. I am not sure what his name is. Thanks for everything!!!"
Moe L.,"Canoga Park, CA",18,20,6,5.0,10/8/2017,Always a great experience at this restaurant.  Waiter Jerry was awesome and the food could not be any better. Definitely a solid 5 STAR. Been coming here for years and its better every time.
Glen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,68,,1.0,1/3/2018,"Well, here we go. We ate at the Cheesecake Factory last night and tonight. Both nights our food took over an hour to arrive after ordering it.   We had to send back food last night because it was burned. At the very least our servers could have said something instead they just ignored us. I understand sometimes things happen but be up front about it. It's not a big deal. Then what really irked me was when one of the guys bussing the table behind us was hitting the bread crumbs off the seat with his towel and they went flying  right by us slightly hitting my son in the face. The manager came out to our table and apologized how their Kitchen should not be like this. Not only should the kitchen not be like this the people working here should not be like this as well. I didn't mention the flying food incident to our manager and I wished I would have.  I would send them all back to be retrained!!!  The way we were handled was very pathetic!  It will be a long time before I come back to this restaurant again."
Michael C.,"Hidden Hills, CA",383,66,90,3.0,5/25/2017,Their food tastes the same every single time you go. The only item I would not recommend is the fish and chips as I had a really bad experience with that dish.  Service at this location is great! And they have an outdoor patio that is in the mall as well as one that is outside.
