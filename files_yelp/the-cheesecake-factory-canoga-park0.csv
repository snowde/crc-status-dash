Gloria A.,"Simi Valley, CA",16,8,3,3.0,12/31/2016,"If you're hungry and want to eat in a hurry, don't go there. Our 15 min wait turned into 30.... Our food took longer than most would expect but in all it was tasty.  Waiter either got it wrong or the person who prepared it did. So had to start one order over. Kind of pricey but a great menu with large selection of food. Didn't try the cheesecake though. I'm going back to a different location to try the desserts....."

Andrew W.,"Brisbane, Australia",208,124,484,5.0,4/19/2014,Always good when you need some extra calories. There are pages and pages of choices for entrees and desserts. I always try something new and leave lots of room for cheese cake Highly recommend: chicken Marsala and the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake.
Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,122,24,5.0,5/10/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory shares parking with the mall which made finding a parking spot difficult. Those trying to park were petty aggressive, so be careful. There is valet service if you don't want the hassle with driving around looking for a spot. I put my name on the wait list and was told it would be 30 minutes for a table. For as busy as they were it seemed reasonable. They were right on the money with the time to wait. We were seated and our server, Erin, was right there to take our drink order. I had the filet mignon medium rare, my wife had the chicken piccata, and my daughter had the spaghetti. The filet was perfect made as requested, extremely tender cut of meat. My wife enjoyed the chicken which I tried was really good as well. Erin was our server and she was amazing. She didn't hover over us, but she was there if we needed something. It was a good balance were we could enjoy are meal without being asked if we needed anything with food in our mouths."
Coraal D.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",350,14,1,3.0,7/15/2016,"When we got to the restaurant they said it would be a ten minute wait, but we received the text telling us our table was ready 20 minutes later. When we arrived at the restaurant they then made us wait an additional 5 minutes. When we got our table it was still wet and the check from the previous people was still on the table. It took them a few minutes to actually give us utensils and wipe off the water and when they gave the utensils it was very disorganized across the table. When we finally got our waiter, Derek, he was very nice and helpful. We had to wait thirty minutes for our food from when we ordered until we got the meals. Overall just an annoying experience, this place needs to get their shit together. And Cheesecake services replied to his email trying to solve the problem of the wait time, but they failed to recognize the main issue of disorganization and not being upfront with customers. If it was going to be longer than 10 minutes, then the hostess should've said it was going to be around 25 minutes and had the table ready with utensils when we came."
Myles P.,"Dana Point, CA",1,6,3,2.0,3/18/2017,"Terrible absolutely terrible. This establishment will not be seeing me anytime soon. Food made very under par. Sadly the best thing I had tonight was the ice in my water. Yes, maybe the waiters were good and did a very good job of being friendly and bringing our food out. But service isn't the main thing at these type of restaurants. Food is what we want and sadly the food just didn't taste as well as it should have been. My mother had the Jambalaya and it tasted very bland. My dad had the farfalle and it too did not have the right kick of flavor to it. For me I went simple with some calamari and a sausage pizza. The calamari was too airy and did not adhere to the palettes on my tongue.  The sausage pizza was mainly just a cheese pizza with one small sausage on every slice. I'm not exaggerating either. I will not be coming to this establishment anytime soon and hopefully there food tastes better if I even bring my business here again in the future."
Mark S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/19/2017,"Very good experience. Started with the olives appetizer and finished with the Cuban sandwich. Service was decent. Food took a while, but was perfect."
Liat Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,19,18,1.0,3/18/2016,I cannot believe that a high class restaurant does not have paper towels in the restrooms! I washed my hands and have to use a dryer to dry them but how am I supposed to open the door to get out without paper towels. It is ridiculous and unsanitary to not have paper towels in a restroom.
Sha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,103,30,2.0,2/8/2016,I ordered a side of Mac and Cheese and they topped it with Coconut shavings instead of bread crumbs LOL The service was good but I think the kitchen was having an off night
Donna N.,"Agoura, CA",21,17,2,1.0,1/1/2017,Had dinner at this restaurant tonight. Had to wait over an hour for a table and was given a very bad table. Asked to have a booth or better location we were told that we would have to wait a lot longer.  Our Waiter E Giancarlo was very very slow. Took forever to get anything. Over 20 minutes to get bill. Then I gave him a 75.00 gift card for a 49.00 bill and he brought it back and said it did not work. I was very upset. Came home checked your website for balance and it said I had the 75.00 balance. The salad and salmon was ok nothing special. This was a very upsetting night.
Dolores L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",18,7,1,4.0,12/31/2016,I really like this place foods and the service the only negative thing is too much waiting
V M.,"Downtown, Glendale, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Bad food. Ordered salmon and came out as ""beefjerky"" fish. Burned bottom, dry and took one bite tasted like cardboard.  Surprised waitress didn't see the salmon in that condition before placing the plate in front of me. I cancelled my order and filled up eating the bread."
Jessica P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1282,75,8,4.0,7/24/2016,Great food with great romantic atmosphere and amazing service. Love the variety on the menu for food and cakes! Has a great bar section as well. Convening let located at the Topanga Mall at Westfield with valet service.
Anthony H.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",123,1,,1.0,7/9/2017,Worst service I've ever had not even Mcdonald food comes out cold.kasmira needs to get some people skills.
Joseph Y.,"Chatsworth, CA",4999,701,684,3.0,1/2/2014,"I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory on Canoga Ave. However, recently they built this new location so my wife and I went to give it a try. We are huge fans of Cheesecake Factory and so we were looking forward to going for dinner. The wait time we were told was 40 minutes. 35 minutes later I receive a text to my cell that our table is ready. We rushed to the main entrance, check in and were told we would be seated. 5 minutes goes by, 10 minutes goes by... It's starting to get packed in the entrance at an uncomfortable level. People were stepping all over each other, patrons were confused which line was to check in, which was to be seated, who was standing around, who was waiting. It was a disaster. This never happens at the other location. After 15 minutes of dodging people, we were seated. Our waitress was not a happy camper, she never said hi, never said please, you're welcome and this an additional piece that was ruining the mood. The food was great as usual no complaints. I hope this fine tune their check in experience a bit better in the near future."
Barbara N.,"West Hills, CA",80,73,144,1.0,9/13/2016,"Ok, let me be clear, my 1 Star rating on this establishment which I normally love so much is based out of the bakery department. So On Sunday, My boyfriend and I decided to go in and order a 10 inch cheesecake for Tuesday (today) for my sisters birthday since she doesn't really like cake. The girl taking our order was very nice and polite and asked us if we wanted the cheesecake ready to serve because if not it would be frozen but all we needed to do was leave it out for about an hour or two and it would be ready to serve. I let her her know that I would pick it up at 5 and I needed it ready to serve as my sister and her boyfriend had reservations for dinner so I needed it ready to go. I called today (the day to pick up) let them know if be there by 5 and to please make sure it was cut and ready to serve. I show up around 5:15 and they initially didn't know what I was speaking of, they fumbled around looking for it and finally after about 15-20 min the manager came over and explained to me that the cheesecake was still frozen and I would need to leave it out for about 2 hours. I let him know that I could not do that and I was already running late so I needed anything he had ready to serve, mind you I paid almost $60 for this 12 slice cheesecake... He then said he could have another cake but I would need to wait for it to be ready and they could not cut it and could offer me some water while I wait. Yes, water. I waiter almost 30 minutes for it to be ready! I'm a fair person and that cheesecake WAS beautiful when it was done but I didn't like the approach that was taken to try and correct the issue."
Kendal W.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",904,324,669,1.0,2/27/2014,Horrible chicken salad sandwich...just tasted like mayonnaise.  My wife's salmon was mediocre and green beens were over cooked. It should have been a sign when the people next to us sent both their dishes back. Very disappointed!
Kat V.,"Chatsworth, CA",188,988,32,1.0,3/6/2016,"I came here on a Friday night dinner with a buddy who had a gift card for this place.  I love Cheesecake Factory for their smoothies.  The food was ""bleh.""  The Skinnylicious Turkey & Avocado sandwich was a bit of a oxymoron.  Bacon inside of a sandwich that is about 1/10th the size of a normal sandwich.  Ummmmm.....yeah.  The entire sandwich took no less than 10 bites to completely consume.  The fruit salad that was offered was a bit tooo tart for my liking.  Simply not my thing.  I was hungry even after eating what I could eat from the fruit salad & the entire sandwich.  No low salt items here unless you're counting the fruit salad & any salad without dressing.  Methinks, I won't come here again unless I am forced to."
Vijay C.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",39,266,38,1.0,2/28/2016,"Where do I begin? I ordered a cheesecake on December 23 and went to pick it up shortly after 5pm. Never mind how expensive it was and that it tasted off for some reason. My problem was the customer service.  I waited and waited and waited for my cheesecake to be ready. As did others. I stood at the bakery growing more and more impatient. Then some server told me I needed to move because I was in the walkway, which admittedly I sort of was but at least a half dozen employees were able to pass me and didn't make any comment at all about it. But for some reason this server decided to angrily tell me to move out of the way because, and I quote, ""I am preventing people from doing their job"". My response was ""I'm not sure how me standing here is preventing the three people who are more than 5 feet away from me from doing their job"". She just made several sarcastic remarks that frankly irritated me given I was a customer and she was belittling me. One of the bakery workers saw this and rushed to get me my cheesecake so I can be happy and leave. I happily took the cheesecake and left the bakery area. Is this where the story ends? Nope. Some very tall individual in a blue dress shirt was behind the bakery register. He clearly looked like a manager. I went up to tell him that I did not appreciate the manner in which one of the servers talked to me. I wasn't going to ask for anything - especially since I already paid for my cheesecake about a half hour ago at this point - but to let him know that what happened. Well he didn't look like he cared at all about what I wanted to say or my feelings. He just wanted to help people in line at the register and ignored me. Normally I'd get incredibly angry at this and make a scene but at this point I had my cake and just wanted to go. Oh and to add injury to insult, this cheesecake which cost more than $40, did not taste right. Something about it was off. So yeah, terrible customer service, including from a probable manager and a lackluster product. Hence the One star review.  Update: 28 days later and no one from Cheesecake Factory has reached out to me. You would think they care about something like this, especially when I outright call out a manager for poor customer service but I guess they don't care as long as they got paid for their goods. A place like the yardhouse in Northridge immediately reached out to me when I left a poor review. I have since become a regular there. I highly recommend the yardhouse and I highly dissuade you from the Cheesecake Factory.  Update. It's now two months later and still nothing. They really just don't care."
Victoria S.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,96,140,4.0,12/22/2014,"This is my third experience dining in Cheesecake Factory, and I figured that this is a restaurant chain with high diversity of culture, you will see Chinese, Mexican, Italian and French cuisine all in one place, for sure they are all Americanized...     Anyway, this time is better than my previous experience with Cheesecake Factory, better ambiance, nice service and neater restroom. I ordered Meat Loaf with Mashed potato, a cup of Cosmopolitan and a Godiva Cheesecake, the cost is over my expectation, but I had good experience today.     Again, good place to catch up with old buddies, but not a place for first or second date.     Will come back !!"
