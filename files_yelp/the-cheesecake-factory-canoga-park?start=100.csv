Skitter H.,"Irvine, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/14/2017,Shrimps Angle hair. Love it! Cooked to perfection with a kick of spicy. I always add more spicy in my own.
Sean M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",89,44,12,5.0,8/19/2017,"Pretty good spot when you're looking to satisfy many different tastes. The ""Skinnylicious"" menu is actually pretty good. Allegedly all items on the Skinnylicious menu are under 600 calories. So you can either eat relatively well or save a good amount of room for dessert (which is likely why you are at the Cheesecake Factory in the first place). I did the Shrimp dish with angel hair pasta recently and was pretty happy."
Huong N.,"Santa Monica, CA",378,162,247,4.0,7/18/2016,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake and this location was perfect when my gluten-allergic friend and I were searching for a place to lunch in the valley.  I ordered my usual - garlic noodles with shrimp. The shrimp and noodles were were both over cooked, sadly. However, they were so nice about accommodating my friend's gluten allergy and brought us gluten free bread that she could eat. She also loved her GF tacos.  Overall, we had a nice lunch. I would probably try something other than my usual next time I come here, though."
Michelle C.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",97,8,,5.0,5/6/2017,I ordered their sweet potato fries and it was super amazing. I liked how crunchy the fries were and the seasoning was perfect. :) I also ordered a chicken salad sandwich that I wasn't to fond of... I felt like the chicken was too salty. It was a bit hard to eat and the waiter was super kind and took it off my bill. I went with a group of friends and had an amazing time. The atmosphere of this cheese cake location is very lively. If you're looking for a place to hang out and talk I suggest you come here. :D Thank you so much Kimberly D (waiter)! I had a wonderful time here. Thank you for being patient and kind. :) 5 star +
Sam R.,"Los Angeles, CA",331,260,849,4.0,2/11/2016,"Hostess was efficient even when dealing with the lunch hour rush. Came here with my family, and we were sat within 5 minutes of our arrival. In the mean time we gazed in aww at their usual cheesecake display, which they have a major variety to choose from. When we were sat, our server was friendly and very accommodating to my wife, my toddler, and myself. We ordered our food, and while waiting we were served with the complimentary bread. The bread was good as usual, and went well with the soup they served which was ""corn chowder.""  My wife had their pasta, while I went with their American burger, both entrees were made with care and quality. Food was finished off, with no room left in our tummies. We wish we had room for one of their cheesecakes, but unfortunately not this trip. Location also is great, due to their access to topanga mall and located right across the street from ""the village."" We definitely will be coming back."
Kiki T.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,162,1393,1.0,3/19/2017,"Service sucked tonight!! Took forever for the food to come,  I had to ask about the food, when we got the food...waitress never in came back to ask how we are doing or ask if I need my coffee cup refilled. Seriously ridiculous!!  Food on the other hand is excellent!!"
Thanh D.,"Granada Hills, CA",38,5,7,5.0,1/25/2017,"I can always count on Cheesecake Factory. They have never done me wrong. Lol ok back to english, so my wife had her all time favorite which is the bistro shrimp , freaking bomb dot com!!! I on the other hand tried the Shepherds pie!!! Freaking delicious moist mashed potatoez on top of nicely crisp ground meat with sauteed veggiez covered in a oozy gravy that just kicks your tongue back up from where it came from. Then to finish it off Banana cream cheesecake!!! Man ease off the whip cream its like they want me to get FAT!!!! still I finished it *cough *cough I had my wife finish it lol!!! Two thumbs up!!!"
Marky S.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,35,25,4.0,8/20/2017,"I love the place so 4 stars but we got seated at corner circular booth and what sucks is, before a waiter or our designated server gets to us, he passes thru 8 other tables. Chances are, someone asks something from him somehow. So before he finally asks us if we need anything else, its like 15 mins. Tip: dont be seated all the way to theend."
Jennie H.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",1,39,78,4.0,3/25/2017,"I like how they give plentiful amount of food, but I expected better. The food was okay. I liked the service and his spacious the place was. I think I will come back here later for a bite with my family and friends"
Jackie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",736,430,1233,4.0,5/28/2016,"The new cheesecake is great. Not crazy about the location at the mall now. The wait cane be long at times.  Same great food never disappoints! Large portion sizes. Love the brown bread and butter. Always fresh and delicious. Avocado egg rolls are the best! The green dipping sauce is delicious. We shared a Cob salad and Bistro shrimp pasta today. The Bistro shrimp pasta is really good. Raspberry white chocolate cheesecake is amazing! Friendly service and plenty of staff to help you. Parking lot is busy, parking is tough at times but they do offer valet."
Kishan D.,"Porter Ranch, CA",68,7,1,4.0,4/11/2017,"Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake is THE BEST!!! I love the 3 C's - Chocolate,Cakes and Cookies. And this cheesecake is the perfect blend of those. Chicken Samosa and Tex Mex Egg rolls are yummy. P.S. Happy hours (M-F 4-6) should be renamed as the Happiest Hours."
Nico L.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,227,1,4.0,3/5/2017,"Yes it's a chain, but they do it well. Their pastas are fresh and flavorful. The bread is divine. The apps were a bit meh. We had the mozz-bacon apps that are new and they were very bland. Otherwise, this place is clean and friendly. TCF is pretty good at every location and this one is no different. It won't knock your socks off but you will leave with very little complaints"
Jackie S.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,23,4,1.0,9/3/2017,One of the worst locations I have ever experienced in the entire chain of restaurants. The bar tender is absolutely horrible he is a guy with like brownish hair and very flamboyant. My son is gay but he at least has respect for human life. Another horrible is when the manager who is also a guy doesn't receive respect from his employees and he doesn't even know how to treat his customers he is rude and doesn't stand by the consumer. If I could give zero stars I would. The only reason I would give it a one star is because of the general manager who is a sweet women and has a lot of respect for her customers.
Karen A.,"Burbank, CA",290,67,277,4.0,1/29/2017,"This place ROCKS! THE staff is GREAT and so is the food! I do think they need to cut down on the portion sizes though. But then again, that's more to take home for later!"
sara c.,"Los Angeles, CA",420,35,,5.0,5/11/2017,This close by so we always enjoy it the food is decent for the price I think it's the cheesecake that  Keeps everyone coming back
Ilene K.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",0,8,2,4.0,8/30/2017,"Went there for lunch. The wait time for a table was extremely long but the service was good and quick, as soon as we got seated. This location is kids friendly and the kids menu has plenty of choices (though not particularly healthy) for picky eaters. If you don't mind waiting, it's a great place for lunch with decent food."
Sonj H.,"Santa Monica, CA",461,870,358,3.0,5/17/2016,"Both my mother and I really enjoyed the ahi salad, the key was ordering it without the sweet dressing. The three dips ( ginger/ponzu, wasabi and something else) more than suffice for the small salad and are packed with flavor. A sugary sweet balsamic just ruins the thing! Service was poor, handed us off early when we requested early check, without letting us know."
Irene B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,9,,5.0,5/1/2017,"The waitress was extremely nice, and the food came out in a reasonable time.  This is my new go-to Cheesecake factory, instead of the disrespectful one in Thousand Oaks. Thank you guys."
Jonalyn L.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",34,14,8,5.0,2/16/2017,"Good service, amazing portion and they serve tasty pasta. Will surely comeback soon. Bistro shrimp pasta, highly recommended"
Rebeca K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,4,1.0,6/14/2017,"Theeee worst. I called 1 hour in advance to ask for a simple order to be prepared my 9pm. Simple as in 1 loaf of bread, 1 order of stuffed mushrooms and 1 strawberry shortcake (it's national strawberry shortcake day, btw) I explained how important it was for me to pick this up on time at 9pm, sharp. I arrived early... nothing is ready. The cake is NOT EVEN A CAKE!! (my fault for not being suuuuuper clear that I need a STRAWBERRY SHORT CAKE, to celebrate strawberry shortcake day!) Nothing was prepared when I arrived. It is now 9;20 and mushrooms are still not ready. Meanwhile, the ice cream is melting. The biscuits are getting soggy and not a single person in their staff is can take responsibility. Not even a simple, ""sorry to keep you waiting"" or ""we'll be with you in a minute"" or something....??! In their defense seems like there are a handful of other unhappy eaters who were mistreated by a waiter and need to speak to a manager.  But not sure if that should make me feel sorry or even more disappointed for coming here. Oooh update! Someone literally just came to charge  me $8 for a side of ranch dressing and Parmesan cheese (asking for a receipt to add a pic). WOW!  I called my sister to find another place to pick up a strawberry shortcake right now... the rest of the guests know I was going to this Cheesecake Factory at 9 for pick up-- they all heard me place the order at 8pm and watched me head out at 8:30.. Thissss is going to be a funny story to share when I get back. It's 9:40, but, I'm on my way guys! Haha Bottom line is, if you think it's a good idea to place an order in advance here to avoid waiting--- DONT! If you assume they can manage to get your order right- DONT. Seriously, DONT!"
