Christopher H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,1.0,8/25/2017,"The wait was long, waitress took a long time to bring food and drinks. We told her we where out celebrating a friends birthday and she did not make a comment or anything. Paid for out dinner and took her Tim to bring receipts back. Won't be coming here again. One star service"
Tiffany T.,"Los Angeles, CA",366,261,111,2.0,11/26/2016,"So Disappointing! We just left this location and I wanted to write my review while it was fresh on my mind. Normally most Cheesecake Factory restaurants have ridiculously long wait times so I was impressed when the really nice hostess told us we would only have a 20 minute wait. We got a text message when it was time to be seated and the beginning of our experience seemed great. We noticed it took a reaaally long time for our server to even approach our table. After what felt like about 10 minutes being at the table, our server finally came to our table with a dry introduction, not including her name, and went off to get our drinks. Maybe 10-15 more minutes had passed and she finally came back to take our order. She seemed to have great knowledge of the menu, however, the service was AWFUL. She never came to check on us, another server had to refill my beverage, and she eventually came back to give me the cheese that was originally supposed to be added to my salad but instead thrown in a bowl. She had to walk by our table to take care of her other tables so I don't quite understand why she simply didn't stop by our table on the way to the others to check up on us. The food was OKAY. My chicken inside one of the enchiladas was slightly burned but I just ate around it. 2 stars for the prompt seating. Other than that, everything seemed to go downhill.  I hope this review helps you decide on where to go have a nice dinner while shopping at the Topanga Mall! :)"
T V.,"Lakeside, San Francisco, CA",0,22,205,1.0,8/5/2017,"Just did a to go order here, specifically asked if the shrimp was frozen or fresh. She said fresh...I get home to eat and it's rubbery and over cooked, and texture shows this clearly wasn't fresh shrimp. Wtf! On top of that, it was $39 for 2 shrimp dishes and We only got like 4 prices if shrimp each. I got brown rice which was super hard and asparagus that wasn't fully cooked. 20 min after eating I felt super nauseous and so did my fiancée who got the same thing. I threw up...he's keeping it down but we will see. I'm 99% sure the shrimp was bad. I tried to call but the girl went to get the manager and just left me on hold for 10 min+. I just hung up! Never coming here again. Terrible customer service and food."
T C.,"Hidden Hills, CA",2,212,,5.0,8/3/2017,"A big thank you to ERNETTA G. on being such a great waitress.  We were in a hurry to have dinner before going to a show in LA and hadn't realized the restaurant would be so chaotic due to their Cheesecake Day special offer.  We sat at a high top in the bar area and Ernetta made sure we had speedy service with a big smile and a happy joke or two even though she was kept really busy with all her tables on such a busy evening.  Her customer service was great, we had a quick meal and didn't feel we would be late for our show.  Hopefully next time we hit the bar for dinner Ernetta will be our waitress. I had the avocado egg rolls which were deliciously melt in the mouth yet crunchy, hubby had the sliders which disappeared quickly!  The small bites Greek salad was just the right size to share."
Chris K.,"Granada Hills, CA",52,7,,1.0,8/11/2017,"I had one of the most humiliating experiences at this restaurant today when I went to use the restroom. As I was going into a stall a woman behind me at the sink said ""Excuse me sir, this is the woman's restroom"" very loudly. As I turned around she realized I am a woman and was in the right restroom and apologized. I am a gay woman with short hair but have never had an experience at a restaurant bathroom such as that! And the worst part was that she is an EMPLOYEE! It was extremely embarrassing to me and it definitely made an impact on me for quite a while. I am really embarrassed that a young woman in this day and age, in California.......not the Midwest, would be so inconsiderate to a customer at HER place of work. I am flabbergasted at how hurtful she was to me. Unfortunately, I am sure I am probably not the first to experience it from her, and probably won't be the last.  I did complain to the manager up front, and he apologised and said he would speak to her. I was pretty upset and hurt and will probably make sure that I, nor anyone I know, goes to eat at that location. I am still so humiliated. Her name is Rachel and she should be ashamed of her behavior. I couldn't put 0 stars or I would have!"
Elen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,15,9,4.0,7/26/2017,"Came here for lunch with my sister while doing some shopping. We ordered salads and they messed up on my dressing. After waiting for about 15 mins for the salads I had to wait even more, mind you I'm starving :( the manager came to say sorry and offer us for soup or fries, that was nice. Food is very good."
Rashmi V.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",1113,904,3333,4.0,7/12/2015,"I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Delicious food, hugeee portions, really amazing cheesecake. Service has always been great. Wait time sucks but they text you, sometimes they can be off on their times whether being late or early. They told me 30mins but they text me within 15mins but ended up waiting another 10mins to get seated. My personal favs: Their brown bread with ranch dressing yes I said ranch, it's sooo good just dip it, it's yummy! The honey chipotle pasta with extra chicken, no peas add onions/bellpeppers, and my all time favorite the factory burrito grande. Salads, appetizers, desserts=YUMMYYY. Prices are a lil high but I definitely visit here on a monthly basis! Wish they took reservations though."
Christina D.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,64,,2.0,8/7/2017,Was there yesterday for dinner. The service was poor. Took at least 30 minutes from the time we ordered until the food was served. Food was barely warm. I ordered the hibachi steak.  The food itself was good but it was missing the asparagus which the waitress has to bring to me after I told her it was missing from the plate. Also it was NOT wasabi mashed potatoes. Just the regular mashed potatoes. I knew it was not wasabi mashed potatoes because my mom had the lemon herb chicken and we got the same type of mashed potatoes. Very disappointing as we usually love eating there! It has gone down hill since it moved from the Canoga blvd location.
Carissa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,15,4.0,3/12/2017,"I have been to several different Cheesecake Factory locations, this one wasn't as nice as the others but more than decent to come to since it's in the mall. The ambience was casual but nice; the waitress was attentive despite being overwhelmed since it was really busy this particular night on Thursday.  I ordered the cheese pizza and mozzarella triangles and my friend ordered the salmon. The wait time for the food was a bit long but while we waited we got to hear the staff sing happy birthday to several different tables who were all celebrating a birthday the same day, the food came and it met our standards and the standards of Cheesecake as I've come to know. I give this place four stars instead of five because of the long wait time . Hopefully five stars next time otherwise this place has class and casualness and is always clean inside and out."
Shari W.,"Marietta, GA",8,10,7,3.0,7/14/2017,"Not as good as it was back in the 1990's. Not as fresh and tasty, and expensive for the quality. The decor at all Cheesecake Factories is always very nice."
Joseph D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,14,1,2.0,7/20/2017,This is with some of the worst food I have ever eaten. The fries are not fried they're as microwaved. The  Catfish was also microwaved and cold in the middle. All there food is under cooked.
Irene Y.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",135,16,21,5.0,6/24/2017,"My bff's favorite spot, my favorite place for the skinny drink menu ...I love their Skinny Long Island & the fact that it's served in a large tall glass ;) All their dishes are amazing, the tuna tartar, ahi carpaccio, & seared tuna salad...my favs! Always great service, never disappointed."
Troy H.,"Chatsworth, CA",811,653,191,4.0,5/9/2015,"This is a great gem in woodland hills that can satisfy that craving. They options that they have to assist your stomach needs will not leave you disappointed. They have great pasta dishes that can fulfill any hunger as well as burgers that will have you asking for more such as their mushroom burger or Mac & cheese burger. To down these delicacies you can have one of their special martinis such as their spiced pineapple. Service was great as Chelsea made sure our needs were met. She was friendly,professional, and courteous. Parking was at the mall and it gets packed but usually a non issue."
Alia C.,"North Hills, CA",75,83,67,3.0,9/16/2017,Food at this location is a hit or miss. Sometimes you get good food with good portion sizes and sometimes you don't. It depends. When you get it to go it's a hit or miss- depends on who prepares your food. This location is always busy for the most part though
Kiki R.,"Flagstaff, AZ",1,15,,1.0,10/22/2017,"Awful service, especially on a Sunday night. I will not come back to this location.  I understand this location can get pretty packed but this is not okay. Very disappointed to say the least. I asked 3 different servers for the bill while ours was on break and yet, none of them couldn't figure out how to bring the bill out to us. Will now be going to TO location."
Vered G.,"Calabasas, CA",0,24,20,3.0,10/21/2017,"Great menu, lots of options like the skinny licious menu,, love the lettuce  wraps. Though I must say we waited for the food a long time , longer then average , and then it came cold . Half of us are eating and the rest are waiting for the food to be made again."
Sherryl I.,"Camarillo, CA",804,275,827,3.0,3/3/2016,"I work close to this location and have given it about a dozen chances over the past couple years.   Food = tasty with a huge menu book offering a variety of flavors sure to please any type of craving you're having Portions = still relatively generous, though I have noticed that the portions have become smaller and smaller over time --- easy for me to notice because I always get the same dish, combo with chicken madeira and salmon Service = friendly, but there is ALWAYS some sort of delay each and every time I've gone there.  At least 1 or more of the following ALWAYS HAPPENS: - seating takes a while, even if I've made reservations beforehand - food takes a long time (20+ minutes) - bill takes a long time (10+ minutes) --- this is the most common - non-existent server (not because they're terrible, but because they've been assigned too many tables) If not for the unreliability of getting my food or the bill, I would make this more of a go-to spot for lunch.  I always leave this location feeling like I had an irritating experience, because by the time I leave, I'm running back to my car after noticing it's already well past my lunch break. I probably won't be going back any time soon.  There are so many new options now, especially at The Village where I can get great/cheaper/faster food."
Brittany K.,"WEST HILLS, CA",0,61,12,4.0,6/9/2017,"The corn tamales are reaaally interesting. It's an appetizer but should really be a dinner. The sizing proportions are too big honestly. It's savory, sweet, tangy, literally a bit of everything perfectly combined into a tamale.... never had anything so exceptional. I also added chicken!"
Lili K.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",5,7,5,5.0,2/13/2017,"This one is located at the  Westfield Mall which is convenient for us since every Sunday is a shopping day with my girlfriends. I liked love this place, portions are big and can barely can finish it, let alone start a desert. It is why I order cheesecake ""to_go"". Wonderful service and relaxing atmosphere.  P. S. If you like chicken I recommend Chicken Madeira (I hope I spelled it right:"
Michele R.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",11,69,,5.0,9/19/2016,"I had not been to a CF in a while. I was thrilled to find they have many healthy selections now. I have enjoyed the lettuce wraps before, and they taste great and healthy. This time I had grilled salmon with mashed potatoes, a lemon cream sauce and fresh asparagus. It was great! A wee bit over cooked, but way better than most restaurants. Over cooking salmon is a pet peeve.  I was there with a friend for a long lunch, so we kept the table for a long time. The waitress was attentive and understanding.  I finally ordered the Oreo vanilla ice cream shake. Yummy.  I was energized enough to go to Nordstrom's for a great new hat. CF was not crowded, the tables are well spaced, the food was excellent and the waitress was excellent, so she got a great tip. A very happy experience, unexpected in a shopping center. Btw, just because they have cheesecake doesn't mean you have to order it, lol."
