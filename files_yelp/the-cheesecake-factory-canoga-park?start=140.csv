Mr B.,"Hollywood, CA",172,107,183,3.0,11/12/2016,"Staff is killer, super nice Wait sucks where there is one My complaint is the bar staff is terrible. The people working the tables are really forgetful and just don't care. I think it's all trainees....."
Zoya N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,1.0,3/24/2017,Such awful service tonight!!! Our waiter not only did he not introduce himself but he was all over the place & when he brought the bread & butter he literally threw the butter on the table without any apologies!!! Then he completely ignored us & when we gave feedback on the taste of our Salmon he could care less with nasty attitude. Unprofessional & wont be back.
Jim K.,"Camarillo, CA",1371,503,3770,4.0,1/30/2016,"I met a dealer out here at the mall to look at a job he is doing and took him to The Cheesecake Factory.  We grabbed a tall table in the bar and our waiter Scott was very attentive and on point, he brought us water and hot bread to start. I ordered the Southwest Chicken Sandwich Grilled Chicken Breast, Crushed Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro, Jalapeño Peppers and Chipotle Mayo on a Toasted French Baguette the chicken was moist and tender with all the ingredients all melted together and toasted up, it's  flavor profile was firing on all cylinders it came with a nice side of fries also hot.  I ate Half of the sandwich which was huge, and brought the other half home for Elizabeth ;) My dealer having had a large breakfast and not super hunger, opted for the Stuffed Mushrooms served in a mini baking pan with Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce. he also sopped up the sauce with some of the hot bread at the end.  It was good food and flavor all around. I'm at the cheesecake factory and didn't even look at the cheesecake... FAIL should have at least got you a cheater shot of the goods."
Jocelyn M.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,47,14,4.0,9/4/2016,The food was good. Of course it's cheesecake. The device was good but the food took a while to get here Favorite part was the patio.
Natasha G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,3,1.0,5/29/2017,Horrible latte will never return and the second time the server brought me a new one it was worst than the first!
Marc D.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",277,249,578,3.0,3/14/2016,"My first thoughts before dinner at the Cheesecake Factory:  What can I order that won't have 6,500 calories?   Lucky for me, things have changed since my last visit to this venerable chain, with the addition of the Skinni-licious Menu.  Sure, I felt like an idiot saying the word Skinni-licious when I ordered my chicken tacos, but I felt better the next day, knowing the 3 tasty tortillas filled with spicy chicken and vegetables clocked in at fewer than 600 calories.   With that added peace of mind, I felt comfortable with the added piece of brown bread on my plate. I'm going to say the word, 'Skinni-licious' just once more as I mention that this reduced calorie menu also featured burgers, and other classic selections sure to satisfy those in your party who usually ruin the party, complaining about how fattening the food is."
Nick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,173,1149,5.0,11/6/2016,The food was good and hot. Our server Sarah G was polite and friendly. Glad we made a stop here since it was the only restaurant open after 10pm in the area. Took a cheesecake to go. Hope that works out well to.
Amir M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/5/2017,"From the atmosphere, selection, quality and off course quantity. Cheesecake has always given me a great experience. The waiting time passes fairly fast in the Topanga mall.  Amir."
J. M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",43,39,34,2.0,4/6/2017,"I came here to have a nice lunch with a friend that I was meeting up with. When I got there I couldn't understand why the host looked at me so rudely and said oh yeah this way. I had my baby in his stroller we were walking around the mall and he fell asleep before going to lunch I never have any issues eating any where or am mistreated in restaurants they always accommodate my needs as a mom. Well, when I sat down my friend was furious with the hostess she was rude to me for the pure fact that I had my two month old son in a stroller in their restaurant and she told my friend that I was not aloud with a stroller I was so shocked because I never had a restaurant act like that towards me or any mom for that matter. It really bothered me that I was treated so rudely for something like that.  The waitress was friendly and attentive she was the only thing that actually made that uncomfortable moment and little more pleasant but it was embarrassing to be treated like that. Food is usually always decent there so I would just advise management to retrain their hostess on respect towards customers"
Craig P.,"West Hills, CA",0,3,1,1.0,10/1/2017,"Ordered a 16 dollar 10inch pizza, it looked and tasted like a frozen school cafeteria pizza.  I was very disappointed with my visit."
Ana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,31,28,3.0,9/11/2017,"Let me start off by saying that Cheesecake is one of my all time favorite places to eat, so coming to this location I was a bit dissatisfied. Our wait to be seated was minimal despite it being busy since we opted to sit outside. When I first sat down I thought I saw dirty towel napkin, only to find out I wasn't seeing things and that in fact the napkin was dirty and stained. I would NEVER set this at my own table for guest, let alone at a place I am PAYING. Since there was an extra set, I tried to ignore it. Our waitress was super nice which was great, but our food took FOREVER to come out. It was only 3 of us and we didn't order anything fancy that needed major cooking or prepping. By the time our food came, we were ready to go home and weren't hungry any more. We ended up taking our meals to go and have it for lunch the next day which defeated the purpose of having a nice dinner that day. Overall, it wasn't the experience I was expecting from one of my favorite chains."
Private I.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,5.0,7/18/2016,"Alright I dine here all the time and can't believe I haven't written a review.  The staff here really has it together. The GM must run a tight ship, because the service I have received has always exceeded my expectations.  Josh Stride- he is a manager here. This guy is a professional gentleman. He has such a powerful and authoritative presence but he has such a strong duality about him that he is also extremely compassionate and sensitive. It is such a pleasure whenever I have the chance to see him. Sheldon Cohen is the best server in the house. I usually see him when I dine in the bar and he is so efficient, managing so many tables with ease. He is also entertaining and good looking- but most importantly, he does his job right."
Patara R.,"Canoga Park, CA",5,58,87,4.0,3/3/2016,"What's with all the hate? Aww. I grew up in the valley and I eat everything from In N Out to Matsuhisa. I just wanted to say that I think this place is great for what it is. The flavor of the food (at least everything I have tried) is fantastic. The portion is huge. I would say most of the time, the service is also really wonderful. They are so busy there, but they do try to come by to check on you once in a while. That dark bread there is so good too! :p. The only bad thing is the long line and long wait usually.  I had fancy friends laugh at me for going to Cheesecake Factory because usually we would be eating at Places like Gjellina, but I think the food is good here. I don't discriminate if it's a chain restaurant, cheap, or fancy. Just give me good food, and I'm happy :p.  Extra delicious stuff: Tex Mex, Louisiana chicken pasta, chicken Bellagio, all their salads."
Alex P.,"Los Angeles, CA",209,109,462,3.0,5/10/2015,"My family and I came here for Mother's Day. There was a 40 minute wait period, but its not bad because you can just pass the time by walking around the mall. They will text you when your seat is ready. The hostess who seated us said that Mother's Day was their busiest day of the year, and I could tell that it was pretty hectic. Despite this, the service was still really good. My family really likes the wheat bread that they provide throughout the meal. I filled up on this alone. We ordered the avocado, mushroom, and zucchini fries as an appetizer. Fried avocado is amazing. I ordered the chicken fettucine alfredo, which wasn't that great. TL; DR: Service was good, food was OK."
Mike T.,"Simi Valley, CA",4725,371,1020,4.0,12/28/2015,Decided to come to this restaurant for lunch time and it never disappoints. I ordered the Steak Diane & Herb Crusted Salmon with Cilantro Rice and my wife ordered the 4 cheese pasta with chicken. Both dishes came out very nice and they were both delicious. The fudge cake here is amazing and everybody should try it at least once in your life because it is very decadent.
Erica S.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",358,3,,5.0,6/14/2017,"Dined here last night. For the life of me, I wish I could remember the name of our server. She was fantastic! Attentive with the bread and beverage refills, knowledgeable of the menu, and she just had a very pleasing personality as well. Combine that with our delicious food, and it was a stellar experience!"
Noelle R.,"Modesto, CA",24,4,1,1.0,6/10/2017,"My family came to dine here for dinner, there was 8 of us so they told us it would be 20 minutes for 2 tables of 4 but they couldn't guarantee that our tables would be together so we told them we would wait for a bigger table. They told us the wait would be 40 minutes. Well 1 1/2 hours layer we still weren't seated although they sat a group of 7 that came in after us. The hostesses were really rude to us and tried to make excuses. I guess they just don't like parties over 4. I was really bummed because we are from out of town and were looking forward to dining here. Never again, don't go to to this rude place if you have a big family!!"
Tod A.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,27,,2.0,12/25/2016,"I love cheesecake factory, and I always chose one whenever I travel. I know I can never get wrong. But Woodland Hills is one of the bottom of my list. Here are the cons and pros: Pros: 1. Food is always good, even though they removed my favorite Lao salad. Cons: 2. A lond wait in line. 3. Very very, noisy. I went there before Christmas and the music was so loud that I could not hear anything my friends say. So we chose to communicate through text messaging, hilarious. The music was not my cup of tea and very loud, at least they could have played Christmas songs. 4. I asked for bread, which I love, and they were bringing it with the check after the dinner. 5. The parking is $15, which I think its a ripoff. So what that they have a mobile notification, I don't think is fair to charge me $10 additional using paperless valet parking. I don't think I am coming here again."
Josh S.,"West Hills, CA",2,53,,1.0,8/16/2016,"Take-out fail, AGAIN! When I arrived to pick-up my take-out, they hurriedly ""check"" the order, and I'm off. As I got into my car, I realized that they forgot my wife's drink, so I went back inside. The take-out guy had to run off somewhere to get it, which he did, while I waited, again. As I got back to my car, I though that I should again, check the order. I discovered that they also forgot my Crispy Cuban Rolls . I went back in again, and patiently waited, again, for the take-out guy to go find them, which he did. Upon getting home, and serving the food to my family, we discovered that our Chinese Chicken Salad had no chicken at all, no green onions, and just 5 slivers of almonds. It was just lettuce and cabbage. This is the second fail in a row, for CF take-out. Just a couple of weeks ago, my wife also brought home an in-accurate order.  It's not THAT hard guys, really."
Lily P.,"Malibu, CA",1,11,,5.0,5/21/2017,I love the cheesecake factory and the consistency but happy hour should start earlier. I really come to your Woodland Hills location to see Dylan sarasay Chris Chrissy and Jenn they're all a pleasure. Find myself coming in less because there's no Wi-Fi for some reason well is so many new restaurants and options in the area. I also think if you're going to eliminate the purse hooks that you need to change your chairs so that a purse can hang on them .
