Jazz M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,56,37,3.0,9/9/2016,"I'd give 5 if there was more Vegan options! Apart from the Vegan Cobbsalad and maybe two more things, I can't eat any real entrees. Plus, the waitors misinformed me and served me pasta that contains egg. There are SO many vegans and vegetarians now, a big menu like the cheesecake factory's could better reflect that. And of course, vegan cheesecake!  I'd love to continue to come hear with my friends..."
Joe A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,12,1,5.0,11/12/2016,"Love this place great rib eye steak for 27$ defiantly worth it , basically I truly think that the cheesecake factory is the best place   To eat Fair prices ( not too pricy ) Manu is great ,  Best value for your money and the food is awesome !!! Staff is super professional !!!"
Almond B.,"Northridge, CA",0,24,2,2.0,11/13/2017,"I'm always disappointed when I order from this restuarant but my son loves the miso salmon and so I keep giving them another chance. I don't know why they can't just have the website setup to let you place and pay for your order online. Instead you can only order for DoorDash delivery but I don't want so middleman touching my food. I ALSO don't like waiting for 10 minutes for someone to take my order over the phone. At this cheesecake the order is never ready when they say it will be so add on an extra 15 to 20 minutes. Also the parking situation is aweful. You have vallet,  the trolley and to-go customers all cruched in the same space with pedestrians crossing constantly. Also, I've found that the bread at this location is always overdone. Although the food is consistent, because of how long you have to wait to place your to-go order, to find a place to park and the brick bread they get 2 stars."
Irena G.,"Burbank, CA",45,5,3,4.0,5/11/2017,"Good place I love the food but the service is very slow here, only 4 star because I didn't like the service here."
Candice W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",142,126,39,1.0,1/26/2017,"I have been coming to this location for quite some time now. We have always had good or decent service.  Last night my friend and I came in around 5:30PM for dinner. We were sat in an empty section in the back. They must have just opened our section because after we were sat there were other parties being sat all around us. Jaclyn, our server got us drinks and put in our order. We got our water but never any refills. When we got our food we never saw her again. Kept trying to get her attention but she never ever even looked at us. Did not have a drink the entire time I had my meal. Jaclyn was way too focused on the group of 7 or 8 sitting next to us.. But we were sat first...? It was clear that she was trying to make a better tip with the larger party. A different server brought us our check. I was confused who our server even was at this point. A manager came by our table and said, ""Sorry she got so caught up with her other table."" But, we were first to be sat, why were we left in the dust? Literally the worst customer service from our server and even the manager who made an excuse for her. Nothing even offered to come off the bill. Just horrible. Get it together. Don't work for bigger tables so you can pocket bigger tips! Work because you like to serve everyone!"
Alexa H.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/9/2017,I love cheesecake factory. Always so delicious everything on the menu is the  . I like coming out to friends or family to customer service is always on point. The cheesecakes for dessert are you Delightful. I definitely see myself coming back here to eat again and again and again. I also recommend you guys to with this please if you haven't tried cheesecake factory yet.
Karina Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,140,30,1.0,5/24/2016,"I dine at this cheesecake location about 2-3 times a week, no joke. After today I'm not sure when I'll be back. Do they not care about their loyal customers?  I called to place a pick up at 11:11am and waiting maybe for 3-4 minutes until the bakery picked up to take my order (always the case with pick up orders).  I placed my lunch order and the man said 15 minutes, no problem! I leave work for my lunch in a timely matter and arrive to pick up at 11:45am which gave them more time. I waited till 12:10!!!! To get my order. The problem here I have is I'm on my lunch so don't tell me 15 min, I'm ok with 30/45mjn but learn how to manage your time correctly. When I approached the manager all he had to say was ""it takes long"" umm i understand that but now I have to rush back to work and can't eat!  For being such a big corporation I would think they would have better customer service."
Rebecca L.,"Alhambra, CA",0,8,,3.0,8/21/2017,"We ordered takeout on a Friday night and had it brought to the car via their curbside service. I paid through CakePay and they were very quick with bringing the order out to me. I saw that there were two containers of food but didn't inspect them closely. Upon arriving home we noticed that one of the entrees consisted of steak and broccoli, but was missing the mashed potatoes. I called them with the intention of letting them know I was just going to come back to grab it.  I was placed on hold two times with two different people before speaking to the manager (mind you, I never asked to speak with him). They didn't let me finish speaking before transferring me over to the next person. We didn't get a hold of the manager until 20 minutes later when we arrived at the location."
Chris N.,"Agoura Hills, CA",4,11,3,1.0,2/22/2017,10 minutes to seat people at lunch???  Wtf???  Tons of open seating. Four hostesses standing around. This isn't Five star dining folks. This is why I hate coming here. Totally disorganized. Always happens. Got a gift cert for Xmas otherwise I wouldn't be here. Sucks as the food is pretty good usually.
niki m.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",31,18,2,3.0,10/18/2015,Very average. Very little attention from the wait staff! Very disappointed after the Oaks Cheesecake Factory is such a service orientated restaurant.
Robert T.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,5,5,5.0,10/26/2016,"Excellent food, my favorite is Chicken  Madeira. It comes with asparagus and potatoes. Chicken is always tender and melted cheese over it makes it mouthwatering. Great service. The only downside is their seating area. Tiny tables, feels like it's overcrowded and a bit too noisy. Otherwise I'm very satisfied with the experience."
Renee C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,10,5.0,8/15/2017,"Great service! Great prices! And the best food ever!! There servings can feed two people I cannot believe how well priced the food is because it is so tasty and you get so much. My favorites are steak Diane, the pizza, the honey truffle chicken littles."
Cynthia I.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,39,20,5.0,7/16/2016,I'm only giving it 5 stars because of jasmine our server. She was amazing and came by frequently to make sure everything was in order. We sat outside it was a nice night I ordered a salad but jasmine made sure to come back and let us know all the different ways we can change up whatever we wanted or what we can sub with what meal. She's amazing I'll definitely be coming back in hopes of Jasmine being our sever!  Thanks Jasmine!
Tiffany H.,"Calabasas, CA",171,188,366,4.0,8/20/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is my go-to restaurant when I don't really know what I feel like eating. Because their menu is SO large with SO many options to choose from. Just recently, they added a ""Superfoods Section"" that hosts a selection of healthier ingredients. This particular location isn't exactly my favorite because the restaurant is a little too small for my liking. I preferred the prior location on Canoga Ave. due to the higher ceiling and wider space. But I've had pretty good dining experiences here thus far. The service is very good and everyone is friendly. It just gets a little loud and hectic because it is in the Topanga Mall.   My favorite pasta is the Four Cheese pasta! So many different oozy cheeses with creamy texture! I always get this dish when I come here. Definitely worth the try! I also really like the pretzel crusted chicken appetizer served on skewers with delicious dipping sauces.  For dessert, i actually enjoy the strawberry shortcake the most. The biscuits have cane sugar on top for an added crunch and tons of ice cream and strawberries all over. I also love their seasonal cheesecakes such as the peppermint bark and pumpkin pie cheesecake. So much flavor!"
Brendan B.,"Calabasas, CA",0,2,2,1.0,8/24/2017,The service was absolutely terrible.  I went there last Friday and it took about 30 minutes for the waitress to hand out the check and collect it. My cheeseburger looked sloppy and a product of little effort.
Rusann I.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,11,5.0,8/10/2016,"The food here is 10x times better than one located at Americana, Glendale. I feel like the test was a lot different.  Don't even talk to me about service, The service was freaking amazing!!! Reese, has only worked there for 2 weeks but her personality was bubbly and she works so well with customers. She made my family feel welcomed. Reese is defs the reason why I would come back! 4 stars for service and food."
Lily G.,"Granada Hills, CA",14,63,276,4.0,7/20/2016,"love the atmosphere, feel lively with people actually converging. It gets busy during the evening time, got there at about 5pm. we were seated  and attentive to. very polite and professional servers and hostess. gathered for a birthday celebration. about 5 bday going on that day which was a weekday. sweet candle and treat with singers to make you feel special. food never disappoint me at this place. a bit overwhelming menu but something for everyone. gotta have a cheese cake!!! we had the Godiva mouse chocolate cheesecake. it was the best cheesecake ever had. you couldn't really taste the cheesecake flavor, melt in your mouth. yum!!!highly recommend."
Karina S.,"Chatsworth, CA",1,7,8,5.0,10/15/2016,Oh I just love dining at Cheesecake factory! When I was pregnant my hubby would take me there every Sundays :) I think I would get pregnant again just for that reason lol  Love their cucumber lemonade and dark bread. Shepherd's pie is my favorite! Service is always excellent!  5 STARS!!!!!
Krysha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",290,5,1,5.0,3/4/2017,I love the BBQ chicken salad! They have these delicious fried onions at the top. I also love their pizzas and all their cheesecakes. This location is usually very good with wait times and the staff is very friendly.
Np H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,7,,4.0,8/8/2017,"Always a delight to come here. The portions are huge, the service is immaculate. The wait for a table can be overpowering! The addition of a very expensive valet service is disappointing. I recommend the restaurant, but I can not recommend the parking accommodations. And the restaurant does not validate. Come later in the evening to be able to get a parking place, or have your hiking shoes on, and the alternative is to suffer ""wallet bleed"". I'd rather spend my money on food rather than enrich a valet pocket."
