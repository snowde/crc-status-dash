Arian K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",127,29,21,4.0,9/1/2015,I love this place. It's really hard to get seated as they are always crowded so we normally come during happy hour and sit by the bar and eat which is fine by me. The menu in Cheesecake Factory standard I guess so there is a lot to choose from and we've always had great servers.  The crowd is mixed so you might have loud kids around and as it is so crowded you will have at least 3 people run up to you and ask you if the seat next you is free when one person has to use to the restrooms but is the Westfield mall so wouldn't be here if you weren't will to put up with masses of partially annoying people.
Harmony L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",337,301,156,4.0,7/15/2014,"Been here many times, and each time, I've never had a problem. The waiters are always extremely nice and helpful. I always ask them to recommend a dish and I usually get it and they are delicious!!!! I've never had a bad meal here. Also, to add, their bread is amazing! The brown bread = the best!!  This time I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and wow, it was amazing. Our waitress said this was one of the most popular, and I can see why! Rich flavors, but not too strong and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I got the lunch portion and my goodness it was HUGE. I don't even want to know how big the dinner portion is! I've gotten the Garlic Noodles and loved it. It was pretty garlic-y...just the way I like it. Very simple dish that you could probably make at home though. I've also had the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I had it as a semi healthier option. This portion for an appetizer was pretty big...I couldn't finish it. Very generous with the meat in it, as well.  Cheesecake Factory always has HUGE portions, for lunch and dinner. I wish they had an option for a smaller portion at dinner since I'd rather pay less and get less. I always have to take food home! But I can't complain, since even though it is pricey, you get your money's worth.  Their cheesecakes are also SUPER rich. I've gotten the Red Velvet, Oreo Dream, and Godiva Chocolate. Split it among 2 people and we couldn't finish it, not because we were full, but because it was so rich!"
Ash M.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",7,202,134,3.0,8/11/2015,"The problem with Cheesecake Factory is their service is always horrible and it don't matter what location you go to, but the food is always good!  We waited 1:25 mins to get a party of 12 available. Once we got or table waiter took our orders  numerous times they forget to bring some of the drinks, ranch, hot sauces etc. I don't need to repeat myself few times, to get my drink.  Horrible slow customer service.  -1star for service -1 star waiting period"
Isaac S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",55,17,8,5.0,2/19/2017,I have to say I've had a great experience. Katherine the manager was amazing she was accommodating and food was great. I will definitely come here again
Jesse B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/19/2017,"Food was great, but our server Rimi was even better!! Very attentive and friendly. If only more servers were like her."
Ellen I.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,41,1,2.0,1/28/2017,"Generally speaking I leave The Cheesecake Factory with a to-go box, as I have never actually finished a meal there. Last night, however, I left the restaurant hungry.  In short, after an hour wait (not the estimated 40 minutes), which was understandable due to it being a Friday evening, we were shown to a table in the mall. You know the place--next to the closed Sears location. Ordinarily, not an issue, but it was cold last night. Everyone in the section was wearing a jacket. As it was late, and given the fact that it was a busy Friday, we put our jackets on and sucked it up.  Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Three meals satisfactory, mine cold. Not just warm from the trek from the kitchen across several dining rooms to the mall warm, but cold. Pre-prepped mashed potatoes that were scooped out of a bowl without warming. Broccoli that went a tad past crisp-tender to blanched and sitting in ice water. So I sent it back. I told my dinner mates to eat, lest theirs get cold.  So 15 minutes (and three clean platers) later, my dish arrived. The waitress apologized for the issue and walked away. The plate itself was warm, but if it was possible, the food was actually colder than when I sent it back the first time.  I handed my plate to the first person I could find and asked to have the meal removed from my bill. Which it was.  A manager came over to apologize and ask if he could bring me another meal, some cheesecake, a to-go box, something, anything? Thanks, but no thanks. I really did not need to subject us all to another 20 minutes of sitting in the cold mall. Besides, ironically, I had spent a good part of the day baking an elaborate triple chocolate mousse birthday cake, so a slice of cheesecake wasn't going to placate me.  While I appreciate the manager showing up to make amends, I have to say, this chain has been around for a long time, and this wasn't the first busy Friday night. If a plate comes back because the food is cold, the expediter shouldn't send it back to a customer unless there is steam rising from the mashed potatoes! In the main, I find The Cheesecake Factory a fun and satisfying place to eat, especially with people whose palates are all over the place. I had a situation arise about six months ago with a location in New Jersey, and during a call with corporate, I said that I wouldn't Yelp the experience because it was a ""training opportunity"" that I was sure they would address. (Curiosity seekers can reference my Maggiano's review.) Had that situation not happened, I probably wouldn't have bothered with this one because not every service meets the ideal. Someone draws the short straw, and last night it was I.  But this is two strikes, Cheesecake Factory. Three, and you're out. Let's not let it come to that."
Colin W.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1942,104,310,4.0,4/18/2016,"I always love this place, their menu is huge and everything is made so well.  Only reason I gave a four star and not five is because they need to be more reliable in the drinks at this location. We had to send one drink back, and one was just decent enough to keep. Food wise, it is amazing! TIP - they have a valet right in front of the front door, DO NOT use it. It was $10 to move it maybe 30 feet away. Park yourself and buy another cocktail :)"
Diana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,7,1.0,11/8/2016,"PLEASE READ.... I went to Cheesecake Factory today for lunch after shopping with my family and we got food , which was wonderful by the way ,the only thing is  I WARN anyone who dined there to beware of their personal belongings...  As I was leaving I know I remember placing my expensive glasses on the table looking for my wallet to pay and I know cause that's where I left them $400 Tom Ford Sunglasses and  I realized walking out , right away I went back n they were gone SUPPOSEDLY NONE of the staff saw them (LIARS BTW) the mgr LAUREN BLONDE VERY RUDE by the way was not being a good manager trying to rush me out after my family n I just ate there n gave our business .... She was very rude n unsympathetic... said she had an honest staff ... just how honest are the staff though ... no other dining customers were sitting near us we were in the back toward the mall , ... I'm sure corporate would love to hear about this supposedly honest staff who takes thing that don't belong to them ... ALL I CAN SAY is Lauren shouldn't be a Manager ... on top of that why I really could tell she was rushing me is because she did not even ask me to get my number in the first place I had to call back in case anybody did find anything she just rushed me and wanted me to leave like she couldn't handle a tough situation, That's not a manager that's just somebody who is lazy and doesn't want to do their job . So be careful when leaving your items even keys on the table because one of the staff members can come by and steal them ... i'm sure corporate's gonna love to hear about this. I'm not one to complain or give  bad reviews, Because the service was phenomenal in the beginning it was until I went back and everybody just lied that's not an honest that and that's definitely not a good manager"
Noesh H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",18,115,203,3.0,10/4/2015,"Nice restaurant, good service! I am a frequent Cheesecake Factory diner, and love all of their cheesecakes, especially ""The Chocolate Tuxedo Cake"". Their service is excellent, however their food quality seems to be lacking. I get their jambalaya pasta every single time, and the past 3 or 4 times the pasta seems to be dry and not so tasty! Maybe a new chef? Overall good restaurant, but be prepared to wait at least 1-2 hours for a table!"
Lisa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,6,4.0,8/29/2016,"Visited this past Saturday. The server, Amanda was very sweet and on top of it. Ordered the lunch chix caesar, chix was hard. I pulled Amanda aside and told her. She took care of it and brought me out a fresher piece.  I don't visit often, but when I do it is a nice experience."
Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,3,3.0,8/7/2016,"Came here with my husband an hour before closing time . Ordered an appetizer which was the skinnylicious shrimp rolls , and to my surprise after dipping my roll into the peanut butter sauce I spotted something in the sauce . I thought it was lent , while I was pulling out this so called lent , it was hair !!! Believe me , this hair was long about the size of my finger . I was so disgusted I couldn't eat anymore and told our server about it . Yuck .!!  Thankfully our server was nice enough to take our rolls out of our bill."
Clarissa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,222,1616,4.0,10/21/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory always hits the spot. My go-to restaurant because they're open a bit later than other places and I love the wide variety of choices on their menu.    I went to this location a few nights ago for dinner with my friend. Our server was Mario. He's super nice and got us everything we asked for. I come to this location often with my boyfriend and we've had him as our server several times too. Always good service from him.  My absolute favorite on the menu is the pasta da vinci (penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a Marsala cream sauce). I'm also addicted to the brown, honey oat bread that they bring as an appetizer. When I came a few nights ago, I tried their cucumber lemonade for the first time. SO GOOD. It tastes really refreshing and there's free refills. And of course, their desserts are delicious. Some of my favorites are the tiramisu, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. A few others are too sweet for my liking.  All in all, I love coming here to satisfy my cravings. Will keep coming back."
Cristina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,2.0,1/31/2017,"Great food !No complains there but the service was not great. Waitress was very impolite ,took plates from us without asking multiple times. Very unsatisfied with the service, unfortunately becuase I love the good here."
Alex K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",58,83,2718,5.0,12/15/2016,I've only been here once and to be honest I really enjoyed it. It's super big! And perfect during those summer nights. They can hold large parties easily and they don't nit-pick about the small things. It's a cool place and definitely a grand restaurant to eat at. Definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area!
Stuart L.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,25,,1.0,7/10/2016,"Terrible experience tonight at dinner. 1. Was told would be 10 minute wait, turned out to be 35 minute wait.  2. Dinner order took 45 minutes to receive food.  3. Staff not very friendly.  I keep coming back, but the situation never changes.  Needs management change to improve environment."
Judi H.,"West Hills, CA",223,178,594,1.0,2/26/2016,"Went to an early dinner at Cheesecake Factory today with my two girls. We were seated within 5 minutes which was great but this was the end of our good service. Our waitress took our drinks order with absolutely no personality or smile. She couldn't wait one minute to take my cocktail order. When she returned with our drinks, we placed our meal order and my cocktail order. Our food took forever to come out and my cocktail came out the same. As we continued to eat, our waitress never returned. We waited so long to see if she would ever come around. Finally we had to ask a manager for our check."
Ferlay S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",215,183,323,5.0,2/26/2016,"Cheesecake Factory has received the honor from my group of pals as the ultimate ""go-to"" place for GOOD food, GOOD service, and all around good times. This location has nestled itself nicely in the Topanga Mall, right smack where the Sears used to be and right across from Forever21. I choose this location as a fave, because if you're familiar with Cheesecake Factory, you know you will most likely wait awhile to get seated. The great thing about this location is that ""waiting"" can turn into something productive. They ask for your phone number so  they can text you. Nope, they don't give you those annoying, useless .1223942 mile radius pagers that just confine you to the waiting area of the restaurant so you can see your life and stomach pass by as the hostess calls out parties before you. That being said, there's a huge mall to walk around in while you wait! Go get your new pair of jeans before you get too bloated after dinner! Take advantage of that sale at H&M or snoop around Apple just to kill time on your facebook games. Orrrr better yet, you can get all your shopping musts done at Target.  It seems smaller than it's former location, but they are very swift with their service. My menu faves are:  -Tex Mex Rolls (appetizer) -Avocado Rolls (appetizer) -Chicken Piccata -Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp -Luau Salad  -Chicken and Biscuits -Hibachi Steak -Miso Salmon (with brown rice!) Cheesecake Faves:  -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle (rich with a touch of tangy fruit!) -Mango Key Lime (tropical, light, and tasty!) -Banana (light, basic, and delish!) -White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut (richhhhh) -Lemon Raspberry Cream (light and amazing! Feels like Tuscany!)"
Michelle H.,"San Fernando, CA",28,13,1,1.0,10/18/2016,"Service tonight was terrible.  It took 20 minutes just to get my son his apple juice.   Waitress had an excuse for everything.  What waitress does not know the soup of the day?  They didn't even have anymore of the soup of the day.  Our kids meals came out ok, but ours took a lot longer.  No visit from the manager to apologize for the unusual delay.  Just a night of poor service and excuses.  Not our typical visit to the his restaurant, but a night that had to be noted."
Lucy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,22,5,1.0,12/1/2016,Very shitty restaurant. They don't even carry mozzarella sticks anymore and I mainly came here for that.
Guido K.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,176,,4.0,4/20/2016,Initially having wanted to go to Islands - whose service attitude was so bad that we left before ordering - we managed to get a table for the ten of us here - and enjoyed as always.
