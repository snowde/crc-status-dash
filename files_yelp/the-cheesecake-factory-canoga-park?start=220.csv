Elle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,99,44,5.0,4/9/2016,"Where has Dylan been my whole life??!! My kids and husband love cheesecake, it's a staple, but I've started to hate it lately UNTIL we met Dylan. Somehow the food even tastes better now. He's priceless!!"
Al T.,"Los Angeles, CA",226,577,29,4.0,9/25/2016,"Always a good experience....very big portions, superb wait service.  Their menu is way too big though - they've shortened it and it's not as overwhelming but it is still too big.  I always have a hard time deciding what I want.  I guess everything on their menu gets ordered regularly by people??  Eventually I do decide and it's always fine.  Waiters are very professional!  I'm glad they moved to the mall; much better than their old location on Canoga."
Carol K.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",131,73,337,4.0,11/16/2014,"My family and I go this restaurant often. Its somewhere we all can eat something we all like. We like the appetizers, usually the calamari. Its really good! They give both the tentacles and the circle hoop squid lol. The batter tastes good and the sauce is great! The chicken madeira is good if you are hungry. Usually I take half of it to go. We like their mashed potatoes too. Especially with the chix madeira sauce. I haven't really eaten anything else but that lately (creature of habit) ha so I will write more when I try something different. The service here is usually great, and there is a wait during dinner hours, but it does go by fairly quickly."
Lush K.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/21/2017,It's unbelievable the waiting is very bad they was lotts  of places to seat and they are asking to wait 40 min don't go there waist your time
Grant M.,"Tampa, FL",16,92,246,5.0,3/8/2015,"We had an amazing dinner here! The food was fantastic, our waitress was amazing, and the wait, even though it was a little long, was totally worth it. The chicken tenders will melt in your mouth, also the skinny menu has a great variety of healthy food options that taste great, and the strawberry lemonade was crazy good! Oh, and who could forget the strawberry cheesecake....heaven on earth, not kidding."
Julie V.,"West Hills, CA",313,103,251,4.0,3/8/2016,"Came here for my friend's birthday and it was a blast! It can get quite busy and when it's busy, the food takes a while to come out. But the waiters and waitresses that work there are superfast and accommodating. They took our drinks right away and brought us out some complementary bread. And when we were done with our meal, the staff came out with the cheesecake for my friend's birthday and even sang her a birthday song!"
Carolyn J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/19/2017,My trip to the Cheesecake Factory was unforgettable.  My server Yazmin made my birthday dinner a special night. She was very attentive and the food was amazing.  She also made sure that my guests were happy as well.  Definitely coming back soon and will obviously request her service again!
Arlette T.,"CANOGA PARK, CA",224,3,3,5.0,3/15/2016,Loved the alfredo pasta it was extremely decadent and fresh my mom ordered the ribeye which was uhhhmayyyzingggg
Alexander M.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,96,6,1.0,12/26/2015,They should definitely train their staff to be courteous on the phone. I called this afternoon to ask if they were busy or not and if they would take a reservation the person that answered the phone was horribly unprofessional I would not answer my question and would not accommodate my party always a long wait for the decent ended up going to the Mexican restaurant right down the street which was great why pay cheesecake factory $80 if you can get away for half the cost for a much better food and a smile when you order
Jen L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",195,584,253,4.0,10/11/2013,"The outdoor seating is not as good as it was in the other woodland hills location. Not enough shade provided.  Food and service were both good.  It's October! Means pumpkin cheesecake and my favorite pumpkin pecan. Sad news, no more coconut chocolate cheesecake on the menu.  This visit I got the Thai lettuce wrap app for my lunch. It was perfect."
Brianne Y.,"West Bath, ME",0,29,1,5.0,10/10/2016,"Great food and cheesecake of course!!  Professional and friendly staff!  Nice outdoor seating to eat at...  This was my first dining at a Cheesecake Factory and I will definitely be returning.  My two friends and I were all satisfied with our meals.  Pizza, steak and potatoes, bread, drinks etc..."
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,2.0,10/29/2014,"This review is for the pre-order/take out area only. My office had ordered lunch for some clients so I showed up to pick up the order. I got to the pick up counter just as a customer was finishing being helped. She left with her food and the employee turned around to clean some things up behind her. That's fine.  However, she then started talking to another employee who came back there. They never even looked up at me. I stood there for a couple minutes giving them the benefit of the doubt while I could see my order just sitting there. It wasn't until another employee (dressed like a manager, but I can't confirm that) saw me waiting there a bit annoyed and asked if I had been helped. I shook my head no and they just flew into overdrive. To the point where they just looked panicked. I appreciate them trying to make good, but I was worried that they were going to mess up.  Luckily they didn't but I still left with a bad taste in my mouth. I've never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake until this day. I hope my experience was a fluke."
Altinay S.,"Encino, CA",36,58,133,1.0,8/9/2016,"Ordering take out here is like climbing up Everest.  Very incompetent teenagers pick up the phone, then you're on hold for about 7-10 minutes hoping someone picks up. After my phone got disconnected for 4 times. I asked Kim in the front to get me the name of the manager. She said only Bret is available!! And guess what?!! Disconnected again. There is always A problem when ordering take out. It is unacceptable. Poor management"
Mark R.,"West Hills, CA",250,206,490,4.0,2/5/2016,"Glad they moved to westfield mall, much convenient after walking around and shopping, wait times vary depends on the reservations. Place is roomy and exact same setting like in their former location on canoga. We decided to eat with friends inside and not on their mall patio because i dont want to have that feeling where people walking around and see me eating. We were sat inside and food was great! I only ordered nacho supreme, and our friend ordered fish tacos, my wife ordered their house salad"
Uriel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,1,5.0,9/19/2016,Came in a couple weeks ago and I was very pleased with the service the food and everything else it was one of the best experiences I've had at a Cheesecake Factory around the valley. Alex the waiter was amazing dude was very nice and friendly and suggested some amazing plates we haven't had tried and went above and beyond to give the best service possible 10 stars to him and the food was very delicious as well can't want to go again
Cee C.,"Reseda, CA",30,8,8,4.0,5/25/2015,"Long wait??  Obviously!!  It's Cheesecake Factory.  Bad service?  Rarely, but if I do feel that the service is bad,  I usually complain to them after I get my check. Or in the receipt where it says 'Tip' instead of leaving a monetary tip...  Haha I leave a TIP or ADVICE and explain how they can improve in some areas.   Regarding the food I cannot complaint. Food is amazing, but big portions."
Ethan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,25,,3.0,12/19/2015,This place is not consistent  Every time I come here it's Long waiting times  Some time the food is not good like in other locations
Marvin A.,"Sylmar, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/2/2016,"Get ready to get sick.  My son got sick off the Pepperoni Pizza.  I'm also allergic to Gluten, and they serve me something that had Gluten.  This after I specifically asked to have a gluten free food. Good luck, if you have allergies, and trusting them."
Sarah A.,"West Hills, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/5/2016,Good family restaurant. Although service is slow and my orders have been wrong quite a few times here.
Abigail G.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,49,14,2.0,8/15/2016,"We come here pretty regularly and tonight, when I have to drive back to Long Beach after a long day, we sat and waited 30-40 minutes JUST FOR TO-GO CHEESECAKE! We had already had our meal and to try to speed things along we ordered it to go. Bad idea! The waiter said they were backed up at the cheesecake counter, which we've never heard before, but after I had called the manager over, who just offered to check on things, didn't even offer a comp piece or anything, then the waiter came back with the cheesecake  and said he had forgotten them on a counter .  Not happy. And now I have a long drive ahead of me so I'll be getting home even later. Not cool. Not a happy customer at all"
