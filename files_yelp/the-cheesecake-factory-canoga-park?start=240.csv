Natalie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,17,5.0,9/26/2016,Awesome place to go to after shopping-Great food and drinks -- the staff was extremely nice and helped me out on what to order - I'll be back
Leslie N.,"Woodland Hills, CA",232,139,167,3.0,11/12/2015,"Came here for an late lunch last night... When we enter the restaurant the host clearly saw us and he just turned his back on us... His co worker whose a server had to even turn him and face the front... I really thought that was rude... We had a lovely dinner, my boyfriend had the Kobe burger and I had the shepherds pie... I really thought it was a flaky pie crust but it was just bake mash potatoes... Overall, dinner was good."
Brent W.,"Woodland Hills, CA",11,18,4,5.0,10/16/2016,I eat here quite often but this was the first time I have Sunday brunch at this location and it was amazing lemon ricotta pancakes and chicken and waffles and avocado toast was phenomenal orange juice was probably the best ever had. Looking for a spot to have brunch with friends come here.
Samiye B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",22,27,,5.0,9/20/2016,"My husband and I take the kids to the Cheesecake Factory at least twice a month, they love this place. Yesterday we were there for lunch and we had an amazing waiter name Justin. He was so sweet, so on it with everything. He was really good at attending to his customers. We would have our drinks filled w/o having to ask. He was quick, very professional and super sweet. We love the Cheesecake Factory so having this awesome waiter made our lunch even better. Justin Thank you!!! We will ask for you next time we are there. Best Service Ever!!!!"
Ashley D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",27,16,1,1.0,6/10/2016,"I will no longer be coming to this Cheesecake Factory. It's so disappointing- anytime my boyfriend and I want to go out to eat we always came to this location (no joke like twice a week). Every visit is worse than the last. My last visit 100% hit the point of no return. My BF always orders the steak Diana a $20 dinner, the last 2 times he ordered it he received a burnt steak- said nothing and ate his plate. This visit his steak came out burnt again, he asked for the manager. Every piece of steak was chard and the manager had nothing but excuses of why the steak was burnt- like they sear their meat. We have ordered this plate 100s of times and never had a problem until recently. After all the excuses and stories, we received no apology and no maters of working anything out. It took us 30 minutes to get our seats and 45 minutes to receive our food and now we have to wait for his food to be recooked. Now I'm sitting with my plate of food, which I ordered the salmon- dry and tasteless. I'm staving but not trying to eat without my BF he's pissed off and starving too. He gets up to go smoke and wait for his food. I'm sitting by myself and the waiter comes us and asked me how my food was, I answered, kinda hard to enjoy considering the situation, he says sorry and walks away. 3 mins later a different manager comes up and says let me take that plate for you, AND TAKES MY PLATE. I instantly felt unwelcome and that they wanted us to leave. WHY ARE YOU TAKING MY PLATE?! WHAT KIND OF MANAGERS DO YOU GUYS HAVE WORKING HERE!?!! So I left.. I've never felt so embarrassed and like I needed to defend myself. Since you guys have moved into the mall, the customers and food don't matter any more. So sad you guys lost a good paying customer  March 2016 I love the Cheesecake Factory, we would eat dinner here at least once a week. Our last couple of visits the servers had the attitude that they didn't want to be there and we were ""bothering"" them. Not one smile, I would have to flag them down if I wanted something. Great food but if I receive unhappy services, the great food means nothing. I much rather have great friendly services and crappy food- if I had to pick from the two. It's been at least 2 months since my boyfriend and I have eaten here."
Jean Y.,"Chatsworth, CA",192,732,4043,4.0,12/4/2013,"I've been a few Cheesecake Factories in LA, such as Redondo beach, Marina Del Ray...  I always liked their cheesecakes, but not so much of their food.  My friend Claudia eats gluten free, and she found out this Cheesecake Factory serves those stuffs. They even had a separate menu for gluten free. Anyway this Cheesecake Factory located right inside the Topanga Mall, was very nice. Claudia liked her gluten free salad and chocolate cheese cake, I loved my salmon with brown rice and mango cheese cake. Very friendly service and good food. A bit pricy..."
Bob B.,"Calabasas, CA",0,18,2,4.0,9/15/2016,"Thank you, thank you , thank you. Josh.   We ate at the Cheesecake Factory on Tuesday 9-13-16.  My wife lost her wallet and after searching everywhere (we had forgotten eating at the ""factory"") we gave up and cancelled all her credit cards today, the 15th.  Tonight after eating there again, which we do a lot, Josh stopped us on the way out after recognizing us and asked if we had lost a wallet.  What a pleasant surprise!  This place has absolutely the best ""happy hour"" anywhere, but it ends at 6.  Amazing food and drink selection, and they free pour the drinks, unlike many of the nearby restaurants where they are careful that they do not pour more then a oz.  It is no wonder that the Cheesecake Factory is so successful all across the U.S.  Great food, and great well trained employees like Josh , Cindy and many,many others."
Tiara A.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,13,19,1.0,5/18/2016,"I called in a delivery order, which was disgusting my pasta was delivered cold and stale. Then when I called about my order the manager Dave refused to help or remake my order saying its ""not his problem""  never again. You spend $100 or more on trash food? No thank you."
Bianca L.,"Tarzana, CA",0,28,,5.0,8/23/2016,"Dropped in today to have lunch with my daughter and was greeted with the best customer service at the front desk. My daughter and I were seated outside so we can People Watch and enjoy this beautiful weather... Our server Joe was the BEST, always checked on us and made sure we we're hydrated because it's so freaking hot out here...!!!(10 stars for him) please make sure your order the Grilled Salmon with the lemon butter sauce. Absolutely delicious"
Nikki G.,"Los Angeles, CA",304,129,32,5.0,1/14/2016,"This is my favorite places to eat! If ever anyone where I want to go I always say here. There are so many great things to eat, but let me help you pick some great things out.  -tex mex egg rolls -tempura shrimp -zucchini sticks  - crab cakes -herb crusted salmon sub the asparagus for broccoli this si my all time favorite entree on the menu.  my second favorite is hands down the Lousianna chicken pasta without mushrooms! I cant tell you how good this is. Make sure you take some to go because the next day for reason is even better then that day. Try any of these dishes and you cant go wrong!"
Shawn B.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA",0,13,2,1.0,6/19/2016,Might be the last time I go to my favorite restaurant. I have been going here for years. Today is Father's Day and I wanted to go there and eat before the game 7 tonight. My food came out as the wrong order. No problem. Then the right one came out. Angel hair with shrimp. Noodles totally undercooked. I figured I would try the Bistro shrimp instead but take it to go as the game had started. It was like mushy battered shrimp pieces. Totally gross. So bummed out that my fav restaurant has dropped its' quality standards. Probably cost of doing business....  Then charge more. Don't not make cheap food. Feeling bummed out.
Rebeca F.,"Pocatello, ID",3,13,23,5.0,3/6/2016,"The wait to be seated was 15 min, but my husband and I didn't mind, we could tell it was busy. The service was wonderful, like I said they were busy, but they tried their best to check up on you, out waiter even went out of his way to bring me a gluten free bun because I couldn't eat the bread.  Our meals were delicious, and the portions were generous; and of course dessert was even better!!!"
Ej F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",427,497,1567,4.0,10/19/2013,"(+) Food is great as expected.  Drinks too.  Huge menu (with ads) like any other Cheesecake Factory.  Amazing how much they offer for a factory that makes cheesecake. (+) Better parking availability than the Canoga location (+) Probably since it's a new location, but servers still look a little lost when they are bring out food, questioning themselves if they're going to the right table (this is amusing to me, never gets old). (+) Go shopping while you wait for your table, well not sure how far the buzzer range is but at least you can do more people watching at the mall while you wait. (+) THAT FREE BROWN BREAD THOUGH!!! (-) Limited outdoor seating compared to the Canoga location (-) Bar area could be bigger.  I think it's a first come first serve seating area with full menu available but I'm not sure."
Christine N.,"WINNETKA, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/5/2016,Unfortunately I can't give a review on the food since I didn't get the chance to eat there. I put my name down to get seated & was told the wait would be 20 minutes.  After over 20 min. of waiting I checked to see how many people were ahead of us. The hostess said it had been 22 min. & she had me for a 30 min. wait special it would be another 10 min. The hostess  needs to do a better job on timing the wait list. Since I was not happy about the additional time to wait we left. Very poor customer service in my opinion
C W.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,58,,5.0,3/27/2017,"Excellent food, excellent service. Had to wait 30 minutes on a Saturday night which isn't too bad went into the bar and had some cocktails. Bartender was friendly. Waitress rocked."
Pier View P.,"Chatsworth, CA",10,156,62,5.0,2/12/2016,Centrally located in the west valley area along the main drag. Plenty of amazing dishes to choose from.  We either indulge and have dinner at the bar or relax in a booth.  Never been disappointed.
Bonnie K.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",891,18,5,4.0,1/24/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is so much more than cheese cake there is truly something for everyone.  Salads , pasta   Fish , steak  , shrimp and chicken  My favorites are the salads they are all good. Dave room for cheesecake  They have the best!"
Anton E.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,1153,670,3.0,9/15/2015,"one fine evening a few friends and i had a sweet tooth and Stopped by for just some cheesecake from, you guessed it, the cheesecake factory! i ordered the Oreo cheesecake, ordered a recess peanut butter cup cheesecake to go for a friend, one friend with us ordered the hershey's and the other friend ordered the original cheesecake my oreo cheesecake was delicious! initially not TOO sweet, loved the oreos crushed and used, and the oreo cream in the center HOWEVER, after a few more bites, the oreo cream was just way too overpowering and too sweet to handle i didn't finish it and even taking it back, took me 2-3 more desert meals to finish! i tried the recess, and bleh did not like that one the hershey's was even sweeter than mine! and yet the original was the best!"
Itzik H.,"Los Angeles, CA",502,238,52,4.0,6/27/2015,"While I did enjoy the old location on Canoga,  I see why they moved. The new location in the Westfield Topanga Mall provides plenty of parking. I feel that the best part is when you are waiting for your table, you can go shopping & they will text you when your table is ready instead of using a buzzer. Our meal started with the famous brown & white bread with butter. Always fresh and crunchy. Our waitress was Sarah & she was super friendly. My family decided to start with the avocado egg rolls appetizer. My personal favorite, I enjoyed how the fresh avocado cubes go so well with the crunch of the egg rolls breading. They also have a sweet green sauce that adds a complicating taste to the all ready good egg roll.  I decided to stay on the healthy path as usual and go with the ""skinnylicious"" turkey burger(no mayo) with a salad. I thought they did a good job giving a dinner dish under 600 calories. I thought the Caramelized onions worked well with the turkey burger. The salad, however, was very disappointing. It was bland, and didn't have any significant taste to it. I ended up taking two bites & giving up on it. I enjoyed my dinner experience and would come back. The salad was really disappointing. I do think the 4 out of 5 was well deserved. Solid meal that filled me up for under 1000 calories all together. Thanks for taking the time to read my review :)"
Brittany D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,74,5.0,3/12/2016,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory for a Birthday dinner. We arrived just before 5:30 pm and were seated in a matter of minutes. Our server was extremely friendly and did a great job at keeping our glasses filled. She was knowledgeable of the menu and made meal recommendations. I ordered my favorite menu item, Shrimp and Sausage Pasta. My boyfriend had the Chinese Chicken Salad. My boyfriend's grandmother, the birthday gal, had a chicken quesadilla. The Chinese Chiken Salad was huge! It could easily be shared by two or three people. I would suggest ordering the salad as an appetizer and everyone share it. The quesadilla came in a generous sized portion. The Shrimp and Sausage Pasta is delicious. Our bill came out to $66 tip included."
