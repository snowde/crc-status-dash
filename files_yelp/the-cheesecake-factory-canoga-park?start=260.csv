Alisa P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,11,1,5.0,3/25/2017,"It's 7:25pm today and always, The Cheesecake Factory was EXTREMELY busy. I placed a ""Take Out"" order inside. I decided to add to the order after I'd already paid for my 1st order, and didn't want to stand in the ridiculously long line, so BRETT (the Manager) went out of his way to assist me with my additional request. He was quick, courteous, polite and professional.....  even had a smile on his face and didn't scowl like a regular server has in the past. Thank you so much, Brett! You saved me so much time and made me feel like an appreciated & valued customer. I really appreciate you"
Erica M.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",486,53,143,4.0,9/27/2015,"You can tell the hosts hate their job. I feel for them though because most of their clientele are snobby, you can immediately see it if you watch the host stand. We got sat earlier than our quote time, so that's always good (:  Kimberly is sweet and her service is fast! I would definitely recommend her if you want a server with a good attitude (:  Our food came out at reasonable rates also.  We got the usual bread right when we got our drinks. And we ordered the stuffed mushrooms and zucchini fries which came out right when we were finished with our bread. Lastly, we shared the bacon bacon glam burger. It was delicious and if you like bbq sauce I think they add that to the secret sauce. You can also choose regular fries or sweet potato fries with it."
Xochitl S.,"Studio City, CA",119,215,72,4.0,7/13/2015,"I love the cheesecake factory. This is a regular lunch spot for me, since I work about a block from here. Their dynamite shrimp appetizer is always absolutely delicious, especially with their mashed potatoes. The orange chicken never disappoints! The food is always great, continuous quality! The have very good drinks and beers. This place can sometimes get pricey, but the service and food quality make it worthwhile!"
Joey G.,"Bakersfield, CA",133,91,33,3.0,4/11/2016,"Cheesecake Factory! You never fail me, however this visit did leave me a bit disappointed. I was greeted promptly when I walked in and was seated quickly. My server was quick to see me, however that initial interaction was one of the few I would have with her. For starters, she got my drink and food order and then never came back until it was time for dessert and to pay... I had to flag down another server to get me a refill. I was enjoying my chicken Madeira and trying not to choke because I had nothing to wash it down! All jokes aside, it was kind of annoying. When I ordered dessert I saw her again and she seemed rushed and rushed me a bit when I was ordering. Given the huge selection of cheesecake slices available, it was a tough choice! There weren't a lot of tables and it was a weird time of day... She seemed more concerned with getting me in and out. The food was great and the cheesecake was phenomenal, but I was bummed with the server. I know the Cheesecake Factory usually has a high expectation for their customer service."
Alissa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,5,2.0,7/7/2015,"I had a very weird experience here. As we were about to be seated, our host told us that we had to leave our stroller near the front desk as it couldn't go with us to our seat because it was an aisle seat.  This was very strange as my 4 month old was with us and can't go in a high chair and all of our shopping bags were there. They said that this area is stroller parking and the staff would watch it, but it would just be in the open and I am uncomfortable leaving all my stuff there...so weird! I asked if it could at least go behind the desk or something. So i told them the aisle seat won't work and we can wait, but he insisted that we leave it.  Just very unprofessional and I don't want to deal with this. I ended taking the stroller with me as I saw that others had theirs with them. It was a very odd request to make for a mother with a small infant. The food was ok although I asked for extra butter twice and never got it! Maybe they should try to up their service here. Won't return to this location"
Linette P.,"Los Angeles, CA",387,603,2111,5.0,7/21/2014,"Wonderful experience here! The service and food was on point. I love Cheesecake Factory. They especially have a wonderful happy hour! I would rather come to this location than the one in Sherman Oaks. Take advantage of their seating, lovely views. :)"
Angelina T.,"West Hills, CA",232,111,43,1.0,11/15/2015,"I am done with this place. I don't even know why I keep on giving them one chance after another. So I have dined here three times this week. On Monday, they had to replace my pasta twice because they couldn't get it right. It isn't that complicated to hold olives and add extra artichoke hearts. By the third time, I told them to just cancel it. On Friday, I found hair on the wheat bread. The manager came out apologizing and took the entree off my bill. Today I ordered to go. I asked for medium steak Diane, but what I got was burnt overly well done steak with burnt veggies. I mean when you see that you burnt the meal, why would you package that and serve it?  I feel like their quality in food and service went down hill ever since they moved their locations."
Susy A.,"Canoga Park, CA",221,270,16,4.0,6/19/2015,"I havent been to cheesecake factory in a while. Today was a special day. The 4 kids that we had with us were on their best behavior during their play date at the park and then the movies. Our waiting time was not that bad, our waitress was very patient and very helpful. She even told us that we had some of the best behaved kids that she has ever seen. Yay us food mommies! Everything that you eat here is delicious. I've yet to try a dish that isn't good. Only bad thing is their prices,  I  mean come on now $8 for one slice of cheesecake is quite steep."
Ruthie S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",7,86,38,5.0,6/18/2015,Howard the manager and our server TJ was amazing. Truly at first I was  unhappy with the wait and some other issues but the team made it a point to remedy the situation. It's a chain restaurant so you know to expect the food and drink to be what you expect. The service and attention was amazing. Thank you for all your amazing service and great night. Truly appreciate it.
Alya G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",41,31,53,3.0,7/30/2014,"I do love their cakes, truly. But the place is always so busy, even though they have moved and now there is free parking it takes forever to be seated still and that's just the beginning because it takes forever to order and get food as well.  Also while a lot of dishes are great some are not, so it  can go either way. We  sent a few plates back on our visits there. All in all it is still a good place to go due to the variety of choices and prime location, but there are better places out there for sure."
Martin H.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",23,150,,3.0,10/17/2015,"Food is good as was the service. But be prepared to wait and then negotiate your way through the hordes of people.  The menu is beyond rediculous-- way too many things -- and my experience is that when there are too many things, few are good but on this occasion we were happy with our orders. The portions are quite large -- we took about half home. Prices are in line. While we tried several different dishes and all ok, but nne were outstanding. There was a long wait between ordering and receiving the food. My only major issue was the noise -- way too much noise as it is not absorbed and it made it difficult to converse across the table, but worse was the music from the speakers. Overall ok but the noise detracted from my rating."
Ruthie P.,"North Hills, CA",209,97,42,1.0,5/24/2014,"BEWARE! Not gluten-free friendly!  I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory this one is a mistake! Ordered my regular meals I would order from other cheesecake restaurants but this time it came out very different.. The Food was disappointing and NOT Gluten free, specially for someone who is allergic. Our server seemed like she was on drugs! I regret coming here and I would recommend you to eat anywhere else on this mall than ""cheesecake restaurant"". Biggest regret!"
Nahal K.,"Los Angeles, CA",612,389,199,3.0,6/5/2014,"The only time I come here is when my friends and I have difficulties deciding and agreeing on a place.  There are so many better places to try and taste then this place. The food is always consistent. Taste, price and fat. LOL I have had so many things from here and all of them have been ok. Nothing to die over. The Ahi Tuna salad is NOT good even though they charge you more than $15+ for it. However, their Ahi tuna carpaccio appetizer is yummy so opt for this when you are feeling fishy."
Sanaz M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,5,3.0,11/28/2015,"I like this place but I always have problem with their tea!!!!!! They keep the hot water in the metal pot for a long time and when they bring it to you, it smells awful!!! I've told them about it but no one cares!!!"
Deanna H.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,3,2,1.0,2/8/2017,"Do yourself a favor and never order curbside at this location. You will not be able to find a parking space despite there being reserved spaces for it. The valet uses the spots. When you call in, they tell you to just idle by the curb and you will be stressed out because they take FOREVER to come out and meanwhile you will be blocking through traffic, the mall trolley and the ever fabulous valet. Seriously, you will be honked at. Just not worth it."
Judy E.,"West Hills, CA",54,98,52,4.0,5/26/2016,When are The Cheesecake Factory last week with my girlfriend for our monthly dinner date it was so much fun like always great atmosphere amazing food no complaints whatsoever about this place just definitely want to keep everybody in that their appetizer chicken lettuce wraps are awesome and you can substitute out the pasta in your shrimp scampi finished off our meal with a delicious key lime and mango cheesecake which I'm still dreaming
Brooke B.,"Long Beach, CA",37,26,2,5.0,8/5/2015,"I love this place! I have only been twice and each time has been great.  The Chicken Madeira is delicious and one of my friends got the Thai Glaze Salmon which was also amazing. They cooked it perfectly! I suggest both of those meals. Our party ordered a couple cheesecakes to share: the tuxedo, Chris' outrageous, and the key lime cheesecake. The party favorite was Chris' outrageous, it was so rich and decadent. At first I was hesitant because there are so many different ingredients, but they all tasted delicious together. The tuxedo was good but a little boring compared to the other two. The key lime cheesecake surprised me with how good it was! It was very refreshing and flavorful. The ruby red sunrise was also my favorite cocktail."
Di A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/31/2017,"Terrible customer service ,  the food was cold , i asked them to change it , but it still was terrible . The bread they always bring to the table  was stiff and not fresh at all. The better fix the food quality ."
Darren F.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,24,25,5.0,7/15/2015,I love the food and my server Craig was really nice I love the 30th anniversary cheesecake
