Spencer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,97,9,4.0,9/20/2015,"My brother and I ordered the grilled pork chop. The pork chop was a little overcooked and a little hard to cut and consume. The Apple sauce that went with the pork chop was phenomenal. It really went well with the taste of the Pork chop and added a very strong flavor. The mashed potatoes were off the charts. They were seasoned very well and were very tasty. It was a very solid dish and presented beautifully. I would order the grilled pork chop dish again.      My dad order the shepherds pie. He thought it was very tasty and flavorful. He really liked the taste and presentation of it. He was very satisfied with it. He expected it to be more like a ground beef. But, it was more of a steak which he liked better.       Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal, and by the responses of my dad, he was to. This is a great gourmet restaurant with great food and service. I definitely recommend this restaurant."
Rihan K.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",86,491,1429,4.0,8/7/2014,"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times. It used to be on Canoga now they moved it to the topanga mall. Every time I go I am with a big party so they take care of you. It is much nicer compared to the old one on Canoga. There menu is good they have a menu for people who are on a diet. Surprisingly I've never had there cheesecake, I'll get it next time I go it is just to heacy. Overall great place Great service, and a nice restaurant."

Hashani S.,"Ventura, CA",492,523,766,1.0,4/23/2014,"Came here for my little cousin's birthday Easter weekend, the food is good (pretty pricey) but get ready to wait for your food if you have a party of 6 or larger and man did this waiter have an attitude! I would suggest coming out for happy hour or lunchtime specials if you want to go easy on your wallet and have as little server contact as possible. We ordered our drinks first, the aunties took a little longer but as a server you have to just deal with it, showing your incapability to wait will not earn you a bigger tip. Upon waiting for the drinks, the kids realized they could not wait too long for their food...again they are kids...its understandable they can not wait for their meals. They flagged down the server and ordered right away, the spicy chicken sandwich and the crispy shrimp platter in addition to the Oreo milkshake and cheesy garlic bread. The server took their order and left without asking if everyone else was ready to order and disappeared for 30 minutes only to return and tell the kids that they had no ice cream left and could not make the milkshake. The server took our party's order in a rude, rushed manner, rolling his eyes with every request. Almost an hour and a half passed before we saw our order, the groups next to us had sat down for their meal and left twice over, very irritating. Finally our food came, this was probably the only good about our cheesecake experience. I ordered the veggie burger with a side salad while my mother ordered the fish tacos. Pretty tasty. The fries that came with my uncle's sandwich were satisfactory, I like the ranch that came with them, not too heavy. The spicy chipotle sauce was good too. The cheesy garlic bread, by the way, was no where to be found and was not presented other than on the bill. The kids were also very disappointed with the waiter offered them ice cream desert and wondered why he couldn't make their milkshake if he indeed had the ice cream on hand. The manager came by and apologized stating that the waiter didn't explain that milkshakes and sundaes consisted of different ice cream. The manager offered to make the milkshake using the sundae ice cream but I told him to forget it as we were pretty much done with our meals and could not wait another 30 minutes for a milkshake that I could get from a Jack in the Box. I flagged down another waitress for my cousin's birthday sundae as I did not want to deal with our waiter again, she promptly brought out the sundae (wish we had her as our server) and sang happy birthday all by her lonesome self. We quickly paid and left after that. The food is good but they need to really improve the quality of customer service. Its pretty disappointing for an esteemed eatery. I will only comeback to this location for a quick happy hour/lunch special with a small party or to pick up a cheesecake slice to go."
Asya Z.,"Woodland Hills, CA",115,154,3,5.0,3/27/2015,"What makes a baby birthday lunch truly magical? Aside from cake and presents - great, personable, attentive and knowledgeable service of course. Kimberly at the Cheesecake Factory made our 1st birthday celebration a truly memorable one.  First, Kimberly offered to bring banana slices for the baby while we waited for our food.  Second, when a pacifier fell on the floor, Kimberly brought hot water from the kitchen so that we could sanitize it.  Third, Kimberly kept checking in with us, making sure that the baby was having a good time.  Fourth, Kimberly told other guests, many of whom had babies, that our little one is celebrating a birthday. As s result, another mom and a baby stopped by to say hi (which was very sweet.)  Fifth, Kimberly checked with us on the name spelling to make sure that the birthday cake contained the right spelling.  Last, Kimberly took several pictures of us (all of which turned out very nice.)  Even though she had plenty of other tables to attend to, Kimberly was extra attentive and very cheerful with us. Thank you, Kimberly, for making a birthday experience for our little one a really terrific one!  PS. If you have a kid, I highly recommend requesting to be seated in Kimberly's section."
Roman C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/23/2017,"Service was not great tonight. The waitress was so bad. It looked like she was still in training. She ordered the food wrong. My wife's pasta had too much sauce, after we requested very easy sauce. My pasta was super dry. My coffee refill came out when i was done eating my meal. We all wanted water, i never saw her after she came to check on our meal. I usually get good service, but tonight was a bad one. I think her name was Jordon or something"
TheArguetas A.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,28,45,1.0,11/26/2016,"only giving a 1 star because i can't give a zero star!!!! came in the mood for pizza, saw ur pizza everything and it read amazing. i ask for a crust crunchy all the way thru and what i got was a wetttttt messsssss!!! sloppy and soggy!!!! to be honest it killed my mood. my family was eating while i waited for plan b. they lagged so much on a chicken avocado club that i just said forget it. why would u ever leave a restaurant hungry??? doesn't make sense... came in feeling happy, left feeling hungry and disappointed.... just wrong!!!!!"
Jeff K.,"Calabasas, CA",0,8,4,1.0,12/15/2015,"Unsanitary! They do not provide any paper towels in the restrooms at this location. When I went into the restroom at this location and noticed there were no paper towels to wipe my hands and use to open the door, I decided to wait for the other person to open the door first, but he was waiting for me I finally used my shirt.  But this made me think of something more disturbing, does food prepares use this bathroom.  If so, and since there are no paper towels to open the door, bacteria can be passed easily from the door handle to the food and can cause foodborne illness.  Cheesecake shouldn't be so stingy, and I don't think it would hurt their profit margin to provide paper towels!"
Stars S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,101,51,5.0,3/23/2016,"Excellent service by Darryl. Always checked on us. Food was good. The best part was we got a private table to ourselves. While looking around this Cheesecake Factory location, I noticed there's no ridiculous middle seats like in Sherman Oaks and the grove. Take notes cos this is how a seating chart should be. Great job Topanga !"
Alesya D.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,1,2,5.0,1/18/2016,It is my first time here. So delicious cheesecake ! I like Cheesecake Factory in this area.  There are a lot of kinds of cheesecakes ! You must try it. Thank you guys keep going !
Vivian G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,101,159,5.0,6/5/2016,It's my go to place the food here is consistent I usually order the Chinese chicken salad chicken Romano or shrimp scampi those are my favorite dishes here
Joyce R.,"West Hills, West Hills, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/13/2017,"I guess the heading ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" was automatically generated when I rated Cheesecake Factory two stars.   I should have rated it a 1.  I took my family of four for lunch, three ordered Fettucine Alfredo, the larger portion of the two offered,  and  I was shocked when it came.  If that was the large, you'd probably need a microscope to see the small. And it comes with nothing else.  How can they charge what they do for a few bites of pasta?  Shame on them.  I ordered the Pit Beef Au Jus, side of mashed.  It was all potatoes and a weird tasting roll.  Like the old commercial, ""Where's the Beef?""  And there was no ""au jus,"" they said it was coming.  After 10 minutes or so with everything getting cold, I tried to hail a waiter.  Finally had to get up and  find someone to ask for the rest of my order.  We ordered dessert, the strawberry cheesecake was the only good part of lunch.   I don't remember quality or service ever being so bad, portions so stingy, and food so unappetizing.  Something has happened to the Cheescake Factory, it's not the same, and I won't be back."
Papa Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/30/2016,"Alex is awesome. He hooked me up with an off the menu salad, and was very attentive. First time at this Cheesecake Factory, and by far best experience."
Nichole S.,"Los Angeles, CA",251,8,7,5.0,7/12/2016,Such an amazing experience! Needed a little girl time and came in for some wine- Jerel was so sweet and accommodating! He has great suggestions and made us feel so comfortable! Will definitely be coming back!!
Michael F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,39,91,2.0,3/20/2015,"In my experience it was overall bad. I just give them 2 stars because of the bar. Drink was good. First, long waiting line, over 45min and the server was in the rush for order/serve/check. I didn't enjoy my food. Second the quality was less than average, even our chickens was cold they heat it up again and bring it back, it took 15min. And next time the sauce was missing from plate! Third most of the meal was a little bit smaller than normal size. Finally at this class of restaurant you can find better option in this area, with better service and meals."
John Z.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/10/2016,"My wife and I  have been frequent  patrons of the this establishment and have been satisfied with the service in the past\. However, the accommodations at todays breakfast was beyond disappointing. Upon being seated, I reached for my napkin only to pull spoiled pits and nuts onto my lap that was underneath my napkin. That being the start of my experience, I received stale bread and a bagel hard , stale and tasteless. My Omelette was not much different. It was bland and tasteless. This establishment might be able to get get away with this sub- standard quality for fly by night tourist. However, unfortunately , this will not be the case of the locals that frequent all the restaurants in the area. My recommendation is find a close alternative. There plenty in the area.

Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,299,343,5.0,2/19/2015,"I really like this place. First time at this location. Very nice inside. Located in the mall. The staff was all so very nice. Came to celebrate my birthday with my aunt. I got the beef dip sandwich and she got a Caesar salad. Big portions. For Dessert we got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake. They are very good but really sweet,  it could be shared with at least three people. Our waitress was very very nice! Even had some people take pictures for us. Our waitress was even nice enough to write a nice birthday message on my receipt as well as everyone singing happy birthday to me. So cool!!! Even though other locations get busy like this I feel like the staff had a lot more time to help out their customers. usually I'm waiting forever-for someone to help us. Definitely coming back to this location! Thanks guys!"
Juan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,220,208,5.0,3/20/2016,"had a fantastic time with my bestie she took me for my birthday and it was great. we had a mac and cheese balls that can be described as sinful and then lunch, she went with the Bang bang and Me with the biscuits and Gravy I mean come on lets just say yummmmmmm"
Rachel N.,"San Rafael, CA",45,275,24,4.0,5/23/2014,"Looooove CCF. I worked at the location in the Trillium nearly a decade ago and I haven't been able to break myself of craving their flavors ever since. Everything is just so good, and I can tell you first-hand as someone who's been on the inside, they take a lot of care with their food and service.  I've been ordering my stuff to-go lately, which I feel is the ideal way to do it, as they are SO busy should you choose to dine in. To-go also ensures that you don't end up waiting more than a pre-set period of time.  They are aptly named The Cheesecake Factory. There's a plethora of awesome (and quite expensive) flavors to choose from for dessert; my favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry, but they have an option for just about everybody. My only comment otherwise is that this definitely isn't dense New York-style cheesecake, so if that's what you're looking for, you will not find it here.  Their new location has them on the outskirts of the Topanga Mall. It's not necessarily a glamorous location, between mall traffic on the inside and cars passing by on the outside, but I don't recommend going for the atmosphere. Otherwise, it's as good as ever!"
Danis F.,"Chatsworth, CA",154,45,39,5.0,11/7/2016,"My wife, friend and I had an absolutely exquisite experience at this location on Saturday. The valet service was modern and efficient. We parked our car right by the front door, and we were sent a text message with a link to retrieve our car. The Cheesecake Factory restaurant itself was very well-maintained. I was surprised at how clean the men's restroom was despite the restaurant being completely full. While we were waiting for our table, I had the opportunity to visit the bar. There were no available spots, and the bartender went out of his way to approach me. I have some experience as a bartender, and I watched as he made the drinks - all the proportions were by the book. When the time came for us to be seated, we were approached by a very friendly lady who took us to our table. Our waitress was also very happy and cheerful. We ordered a rather complicated order with a lot of modifications, and everything was delivered to our table exactly how we ordered it. The food was of the classic Cheesecake Factory variety: consistent, well-prepared and reasonably priced. We brought our own Champagne, and it was opened for us with proper glasses, put on ice, and a towel was provided. The corkage fee was more than reasonable. As we were eating, we experienced a small problem with our table. We brought it to the staff's attention, and the manager immediately came out, apologized profusely and moved us to another table. When we asked for the check, the manager personally brought it to us and comped a large portion of our order. All in all, I was so impressed with the entire evening that I chose to write this review. I can't believe that this place is rated so low on Yelp. We got Beverly Hills service at Cheesecake Factory prices. Maybe people are upset because of the wait, but ... nothing can be done about that. The food, the service, the location and the attention are great. No wonder people keep coming. I will 100% be back."
