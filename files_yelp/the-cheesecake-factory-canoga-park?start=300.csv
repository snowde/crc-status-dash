Eddie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,2.0,12/30/2016,food sucked i got a side salad and it was literally just lettuce and ranch no tomato no onions or anything. The only good thing about this place is their cheesecake at least they do one thing right
Audi A.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,1.0,4/18/2015,The worst time EVER ! First we waited 1hr to sit . Then waited another 30 mins for the wrong order. Got the worst drinks . Ended up returning the food. spending $50 dollars on drinks & bread.  Really bad experience.  If I could give them zero stars I would .
Eli A.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,7,4,3.0,7/19/2016,"As a customer who come to cheesecake often, I have to say it is over all great. The food is delicious and you can never go wrong with the Louisiana chicken pasta. The chicken is just so good and crunchy. But if I had to complain about a couple of things it would be that they never get any new items on their menu. For years I have been eating there and the menu has hardly"
Gloria R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,9,5.0,6/29/2016,"The best service ever!! Veronica was outstanding. Although she was extremely busy, she always checked on us and made sure we were fully taken care of. She was sweet and pleasant throughout our time there. I've had lunch there many times, and I can honestly say this is the first time I felt the service was excellent. Veronica made my experience at this Cheesecake memorable. The food was also fresh (salads) and tasty. I look forward to coming again and hopefully having the pleasure of sitting in Veronica's section. :))"
Jennifer G.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,17,2,1.0,11/17/2016,"My daughter decided to go to Cheesecake Factory for her birthday celebration. When we arrived we were sat down and our drink order was taken. My brother order a hot coffee drink. When the drinks arrived his hot coffee drink was in a glass cup. Like a soda glass cup and it was super messy, spilling everywhere. When then proceed to order our food. I order the lettuce wraps my brother order a breakfast plate. after what felt like an hour of wait for our food its finally arrived. My lettuce wraps were something soo different from what i ordered. I told the waiter that this wasnt what i order. that i wanted lettuce wraps, so he took my food, then my brother takes a bite out of the bagel he received with his breakfast plate. The bagel was sooooooo hard he couldnt bite a piece off. So the waiter comes back with my lettuce wraps and turns out all they did was make the food they gave me into lettuce tacos. I told him to take the food back and take it off my bill and we also told him about the bagel. he took it back. Then after we were done eating they came singing happy birthday and he asks out loud where is the birthday ""boy"" my daughter looks at him and says im a ""girl"". like serious dude. Could have you messed up any more. OVerall our experience at this place was horrible and we will not be going back. thanks for nothing cheesecake."
Crystal H.,"Panorama City, CA",109,264,81,3.0,3/25/2014,"Is it just me or all Cheesecake Factory's have a big kitchen and everything else just looks tiny? I think it's just their decor.  The server was pretty nice. I think his name was Adam. He was very attentive and it sounded like he tried almost everything on the menu and complimented on our choices. :) I recommend getting the brown bread and get extras! lol It comes out of the oven. The sourdough is good too but the brown (i think it's oat) bread is the best!  The menu is unbelievably huge. I just tend to order the same - I usually get the white bean chili with the rice. Their pasta dishes it can be a hit or miss. I got the garlic noodle this time around and it wasn't very garlic-y. It was ok. I think I had something in mind and it missed expectation. I think I was expecting something dry and this was wet just because it was pasta with white wine or something and a bunch of garlic. The garlic taste was there but if you ate it, you probably wouldn't notice that the name was garlic noodle."
Melissa B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",197,253,92,5.0,3/30/2016,"The service here is always excellent. I love meeting one of my best friends here for lunches and dinners. We catch up, enjoy our favorite bread, a nice meal, drinks, and something sweet. We've had some awesome servers at this location and always satisfied with our food. Always looking forward to our next time here."
blahblah h.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,67,,1.0,5/14/2016,"The restaurant and service was much better when they were located on Canoga next Warner Center.  I came here to eat brunch with my mom and the service was poor. We had to remind our server twice to bring us the check. The restaurant was not even crowded. It was obvious he avoided bringing our check as we saw him walk to the other side of the restaurant only to gab with his co-workers. On top of the poor service, the entree my mom ordered was overcooked. We definitely will not be coming back for brunch or lunch. Hopefully, the dinner service is better.   The only good part of our dining experience was the hostess was polite and nice."
Stephanie G.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",174,100,108,4.0,3/2/2014,"Went to this location with my co-workers and had a great experience.  The service was outstanding! I wish I remembered the name of the waiter because she was incredible. She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, answered all our questions and was very attentive. Best customer service I've had in a while. The food was pretty good too.  I ordered samosas first which were flavorful and came with a great dipping sauce. For my entree I got a crusted chicken and pasta dish, totally forgot the name, but it was pretty tasty and a good portion.  My friends got the Fettuccine Alfredo w/ Chicken and the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. They both really liked their food. Of course you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory with having some cheesecake. So we got a S'mores Cheesecake and a Strawberry Topped Cheesecake to share. Both were just delicious!"
Jackie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,577,31,4.0,5/14/2014,"First time coming to their new fancy location at the mall. Came here on a weeknight. Service was great. Our waiter (Stephen, I believe) was super super awesome. LOVED him. He was honest and gave his opinions on drinks/food we ordered when we asked. He was super fun too. He made our night even better. I ordered a margarita....Ok, I ordered TWO. Very good, but kind of expensive. ($10 each).  For my meal, I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair off the skinnylicious menu. It was delicious. Plus, it wasn't a HUGE portion like their regular menu items. The portion size was just right. Not too small, not too big. I was happy. I will definitely order that again, as well as ask for Stephen.  For dessert, I was a fatty and ordered the S'mores and Strawberry cheesecakes to go. The strawberry was good. Simple, flavorful, and delicious. The S'mores one was a bit too much. It was way too rich.  I like their new location, but I will miss their outdoor patio."
Pauline B.,"Irvine, CA",27,32,23,4.0,3/9/2014,I always like to come here with my girls for shopping and lunch time! The Kale and quinoa salad is very flavorful!  The red velvet cheesecake is the bomb!
Lissa G.,"West Hills, CA",999,861,81,3.0,12/26/2013,"This is the new Cheesecake Factory, located in the Westfield Topanga Mall.  They've taken over the space where CPK previously was (they've moved to another mall spot). Everyone knows what Cheesecake Factory is, so there's not much which surprises me here.  Jim G. and I stopped by to use a gift card we had. For us, it was a no-brainer, head to the bar for some snacks and casual hanging out. Adam was our server and he couldn't be more kind, helpful, and funny! He had quite a ridiculous table to deal with; it's stunning how rude people can be. We were surprised with some of the flavors of some of the snacks.  The Asparagus with the Egg on top was nice, as was the Chiles stuffed with cheese. Drinks are well made and people watching is always amusing.  In the bar, the high top tables are first come, first served; be on the lookout and grab a spot!"
Julie K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",988,590,41,3.0,5/3/2015,Decent  eats... They need more specials.. New stuff.... Always the go to spot when shopping for things you dont need at malls lol
Suzanne E.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,20,2,2.0,9/28/2015,Food was usual as you find at any other Cheesecake Factory Painful - booked for a group of 8. As people arrived they wouldn't seat them at our reserved table until at least half  were there. Won't be coming back with a group
Tina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,5,4,4.0,11/8/2015,"Everytime I eat at the Cheesecake Factory, I always get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. And each time, regardless of location, they cook it with immense consistancy. It's always colorful, never undercooked or overcooked, with just the right amount of heat. However, my server Stacy, did not live up to her predecessors. I've always known the serving staff to be bright and while she was in no way disrespectful or neglectful, her shift ended in the middle of my meal and handed us off to another server. Having been a server myself, I understand that there are times when you have to leave whether it's a personal reason or the manager forces you off the floor and so I was grateful that she took the time to introduce me to the server who would be taking over. I can't blame her though, the restaurant was busy and seemed slightly understaffed. Overall, it was a pleasant experience with the chique  atmosphere and delicious food."
Michelle T.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,13,2,4.0,5/2/2016,"The food here is really good, not my personal top favorite but it's very delicious. The service is amazing the waitress we had was attentive and polite."
Sasha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,28,,2.0,12/21/2014,"Came here to have a nice anniversary dinner. Did not end up that way. This placed has changed a lot since it was on Canoga in Woodland Hills. First, we approached a very nice  host gentleman who told us the wait was 15 mins. Cool. He said we'd get a text when our table was ready. We got the text, came right away, and was told to wait. We ended up waiting about another 15 mins. So i guess our table wasn't ready... Then we sit down and there's still someone else's check with money in it sitting on our table. I tried to give it to the hostess that sat us. She just told me she couldn't take it, or tell our server to come take it. It also made me wonder if the table had been wiped down because the last people's check wasn't moved. So we sat about 15 more mins when our waitress came to take both our drink and food orders. I could have used water a little earlier but what ever. We get our bread at the end of taking our order.  The food didn't take too long, what you'd expect for that caliber of restaurant. It also was pretty good, which is why they get the second star. Most annoying though, was being sat next to the kitchen and hearing people hooping and hollering about the foot ball game on the TV above us. Hard to have a nice anniversary dinner that way. After paying, I asked to talk with the manager. It ended up being an older brunnette (i think) lady. She did not seem to care. She kept saying I should have told her sooner so she could have made it better or done something. I wasn't trying to get anything for free. Then she tried to tell me some of what I didn't like was just the way they did things. I just thought that management should hear about a shitty experience so they can try to improve. She just did not care.  I went back to my table and it had been cleared (funny that it happened so fast because it wasn't cleared when we got there) and my hat I left on the seat was gone. I asked the server, she asked a busser in front of me. Both of them said they hadn't seen it, and I guess that was it. I waited in front of the table for about five mins before i decided to go ask for the manager again.  When explaining it to her, a host over heard and brought me my hat. Once again, the manager did not care that no one would help me find my hat. She just kind of pushed me out the door. Safe to say I will never dine here again."
Phyllis L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",19,120,37,3.0,4/18/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  But today, I have to give it 3 stars because the kitchen made a mistake on my friend's order.  She ordered the bang bang chicken with chicken only.  Not only did they take a LONG time to bring us our food but they got both of our orders wrong.  I asked for my Chinese chicken salad sans green onions and it came with them.  My friend's bang bang chicken came with shrimp.  So I kept my salad and sent back the bang bang. It took the kitchen forever to bring back the bang bang with chicken.  Forever!  So, that's why the 3 stars.  Our waiter, Cody, was SUPERB!  None of this was his fault.  He even brought the situation to his manager's attention.  So we got the bang bang complimentary.  Thank you for that!   Thank you, Cody, for being awesome.  Mr or Mrs Chef in the kitchen - what happened?  :("
Tom G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",23,79,80,5.0,1/25/2014,"I had a great experience at Cheesecake Factory last night. Usually I have a good meal here, but last night was amazing. They always seem to be pushing the bar, and improving on the food. We ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps, Avocado Egg Rolls, and Vegi Burger. The Thai Lettuce Wraps were great. Huge portion. The pieces of chicken were bigger than ever and cooked perfectly. They finally gave enough lettuce wraps, so I didn't run out. All the ingredients tasted fresh. The Avocado Egg Rolls were huge and perfectly cooked. They seemed much bigger than ever before. Also, they weren't cold in the middle. I love the green sauce they come with. The Vegi Burger was outstanding. It was my first time getting this. It was huge and delicious. I would absolutely get this again. The service was amazing. I wish I would have got our server's name. He was very friendly, outgoing and accommodating. It topped off the experience. For all the reasons stated above, I'm updating my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. Great job Cheesecake Factory! We had a great time! Can't wait to come back!"
Nina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,407,1100,2.0,6/3/2015,"This location is just a hot mess, I stopped by to eat around 3pm, there was not that many people in the restaurant and I ordered a salad with salmon and it nearly took 30 minutes to come out"
