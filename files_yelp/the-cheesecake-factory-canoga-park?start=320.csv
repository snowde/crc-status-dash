Anne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/26/2016,Do NOT come here on a Saturday night with a large group. We were told at 5 o'clock that it would be a 45 minute wait. It ended up being one hour and 20 minutes.  The food took an additional hour to be served. Smaller tables that were seated after us finished their meals before ours even came. If they can't handle large groups (10 people) then they should tell you that up front. This was a birthday celebration that was ruined. Awful service!  It is now 8 and we are still waiting for the check! (Topanga location)
Karina M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",187,264,647,4.0,12/2/2013,"Celebrating my friends birthday!! It was great, they just text you when your table is ready. I got their about 5:45 pm on a Friday and it was a little nuts, Thankfully my friend hadn't arrived yet. So I waited in the mall, I waited about 20 min., Our waitress was cool, I did mention it was my friends birthday when I arrived and asked if I needed to let the waitress know and the guy up front no need. Well they forgot and I was a TAD embarrassed cuz I wanted my friend to enjoy her bday dinner!  OH WELL NEXT TIME I'LL TELL THE WAITRESS MYSELF."
Thilini J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,14,4.0,6/20/2015,"Every time I celebrate any special occasion with my dad I pick this place coz its his favorite restaurant. This food taste great and served in good portions (I can eat the honey wheat bread they serve for starters all day) the staff is very friendly and of course the cheesecake is the BEST I've ever had!! The new location is convenient as it's located in the mall and there's plenty of parking. But every time I go, there is a long wait time but the food makes up for it."
Kimberly W.,"Canoga Park, CA",105,7,1,1.0,5/23/2016,Worst experience ever with their workers!!!!! We called in 2 week in advance to make reservations for about 20 people and the workers told me that there will be no reservations. I called two days ago just to make sure I'm not mastaken and still no reservations! So the day comes of my sister graduation  brunch and we all show up hurry and the worker in the front desk tell us it's a 2 hour wait because of all the reservation  and she told us we should have called to make reservations. She called her manger  and he  was so rude and gave us so much attitude when we were explain to him that they told us there was no reservations! Worst workers ever! Never will go again
Charles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,86,,4.0,11/30/2016,"We had a good experience with this particular location. Servers were nice and the food was really good. As with all Cheesecake Factories, the cooking part is on the slow side. There is no such thing as a quick bite with any of these restaurants. But I have to admit, if you are not in a rush, this location is really nice. Parking is fairly easy due to it being at a Mall. And if you want Cheescake...there really is not much better than the Cheesecake Factory...lol."
Ryan G.,"Calabasas, CA",594,15,4,4.0,8/6/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has been one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I have been going to their many different locations since I was a kid and I still have never gotten tired of it. Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place for you to feel like the upper class while still being able to eat at an affordable price.  the food is absolutely incredible. With a wide selection of foods you can virtually get anything at this restaurant. not to mention the bread is probably the best thing you can eat. my recommendation is the Chinese chicken salad, healthy, affordable and delicious. it's my go to however I am also a fan of their pastas and omelettes. don't be shy like I said virtually anything on the menu is delicious. don't forget to get a piece of their world famous cheesecake  the service is great and they are very friendly. the only problem is it is very rare to peak your head into the restaurant and expect a table. the wait is usually about 20 minutes minimum so a reservation is crucial.  nonetheless Cheesecake Factory near you is a must stop by."
Hallie N.,"WEST HILLS, CA",46,40,1,4.0,6/2/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is my Mother's and I go-to place for lunch. It's where we go last minute and it's always a pleasure. We usually share a bottle of wine and a selection of appetizers during lunch. We usually are always seated fast here. The last time we went there was no wait at all which was nice. The restaurant is large, clean and they have decent music playing.  The staff is usually fantastic. The reason I write this review is because last time we went our server didn't arrive for over 15 minutes, arrived took our drink order and then didn't bring our drinks for another 15 minutes. We were still waiting when the nicest young lady came over (whom was also a waitress) and went and got our drink order right away, I'm talking 1 minute or less. She then took our entire order. To top it off she brought our original waiter to the table and schooled him on what we ordered and how to run things, I assume he was new. She was truly a gem and I've had her wait on us twice. Her name slips my mind at the moment, but she rocked. Made a bad experience into an awesome one.  Also we spilled a glass of wine and a bus boy helped us in about 10 seconds cleaning it up. Thank you guys for making my mom happy!"
Freddi K.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,17,10,2.0,5/16/2016,I gave this place a third try and it will be my last. This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have eaten at. Rotten salad that was brought to manager Justin said it looked okay to him with the black rot on it. You are warned to find another location because this one will turn you away from Cheesecake Factory forever.
Arik T.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,193,398,5.0,3/28/2015,"Seriously if you don't like the cheesecake factory... I don't even have a way to end that. Who doesn't like this place?! Its not possible, from appetizers to the cheesecakes and everything in between its always a good time. This is the only place where I go and will FOR SURE have a dessert. No question. EVERY TIME. The atmosphere is always nice and not too loud. The servers are always friendly, and the food is always epic. I don't have one bad thing to say about it....the parking on the other hand is a whole different issue."
Alice C.,"Palmdale, CA",1851,280,506,3.0,1/6/2015,What can I say it's always good at the cheesecake factory I love the ice tea refills and all the lunch plate special offers. But if you want great service go to the cheesecake  at the grove in farmer Market on 3rd St in los Angeles
L M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/21/2016,"Horrible Service! Even on the phone! On two occasions now I've called for curbside pick-up. The first time, after waiting over 15 minutes for them to bring my order out- I had to wake a sleeping toddler to go inside to pick it up only to find the workers just standing there picking their noses! After making a comment to them, one of them responded with ""well at least it's just salads"". On another occasion I called and was transferred 3 times for them Just to take my order, after about 15 minutes of holding, I hung up. Never again!"
Maral K.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,56,144,5.0,10/10/2013,"Love the new location, the new look, and the fact that it's finally here! Cheesecake Factory really can't go wrong... Especially with the new ""Village"" being built across the street. I made a trip over today to check out the new place. I had a great experience. My server was pleasant and quick, good was delicious, and of course the bread... Yummy! I had the Chicken Piccata (lemon chicken with angel hair pasta). It was delicious and had some to go as well. I also love the Chicken Madeira, Steak Diane, and the Ahi Tuna Tartare here!  My next trip will involve a Cheesecake to I for sure. The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake is heaven... Enjoy the new convenient location!"
Nathan A.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,41,17,3.0,10/1/2016,"The only reason only 3 stars is the seating arrangement lasnight  five adults in 2 or max 4  table we were 5 and and it was very uncomfortable ,the food was good."
J R.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,30,3,3.0,9/4/2015,"We went for dinner here mid-week (Wednesday evening).  To my surprise, the parking was a bit full.  That is probably due to the location being a shopping center.  Otherwise once we walked in, the wait for 3 people for dinner was 10-15 minutes.  The noise level is dependent on where you sat.  We were near the bar, so it was pretty loud and hard to make a conversation.  If you sit toward the back or outside, it would be a better location for a conversational dinner. They start off by offering you bread and butter (sourdough and whole wheat grain) and it was brought to our table warm.  We started off with fried calamari for appetizer, which was delicious but quite greasy.  It would have been better if they allowed it to sit a little longer to drain the oil.  It was served with a red cocktail sauce and garlic dip.  The cocktail sauce tasted like any traditional cocktail sauce and the garlic dip tasted more like mayonnaise and Dijon mustard with a hint of garlic.  It wasn't bad but this dish and its dips could use a little improvement. My dinner selection was from the skinny menu, Golden Steak Medallion.  It was served with roasted asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and freshly mashed potatoes (not the kind you'd get out of a box).  The steak can be cooked to your liking, I chose medium well.  It was not over-seasoned and I could still taste the flavor of the angus steak.  It's not overly large portion so it was a perfect size for my appetite. The service was good, our server was Adam.  He did an excellent job making sure we got our food on time and checked on us if we needed anything.  We tipped him 19% of our bill.  Don't misunderstand the 3-star rating, the food was mediocre but our server did a great job. Overall, it was a pleasant dinner."
J V.,"Studio City, CA",87,10,,1.0,5/22/2017,"This past Saturday, we tried to have a surprise birthday dinner for a friend.  There were 12 of us.  Of course, they will not take a reservation, and they will not let you sit unless all of your party is there.  We were told to be there by 5 for a 6:00 table and if the majority of us were there, they would seat us.  3 of us were there at 4:30, they had a table then for 12 and said they would hold the table for 10 minutes if everyone could get there,  of course, not possible.  One person offered $100 to hold the table, they said no, they offered to buy drinks and food until the rest of us got there, they said no.  10 of us were there at 5:45, they would not seat us.  We had to have the ""surprise"" in the bar and still, we waited.  When all 12 of us were there, the hostess said ""now it will be an hour wait""!!!!!!!!!! Again, we complained to the manager - nothing. Does anyone think this is acceptable?  We were not seated until 7 PM, 3 of us had to sit in their stupid bar for 2 1/2 hours.  I don't care what the food is like, this is no way to treat your patrons when they are trying to have a special dinner.  I also do not care what their rules are, if they can't offer decent customer service, no way am I ever going back.  No compensation was offered either, you would think the least they could have done is bought the birthday girl a drink or give her a free dessert.  Very disappointing."
J M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,2,5.0,10/10/2016,"Renisha was our server, she made it up for our last experience at the new location in Santa Monica. She was very attentive, polite and on top of everything. It's rare to have a good service like this. We really enjoyed our night. The food was deliscious. Thank you!"
Eileen R.,"Simi Valley, CA",11,13,2,5.0,11/25/2014,"Very satisfied with our meal and our experience here tonight.  Our waiter Adam is very friendly and attentive.  This location is trying out a new menu that if successful will be used company wide.  We tried the Pasta with shrimp and sausage, it was awesome!!! They came back and asked us to give feedback.... The only thing we could say was how Delicious it was!!! I've been to this location many times and have always left completely Happy!!! Kudos"
Anja K.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,5.0,9/21/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is fantastic. My friend and I went in on a Saturday night expecting a long wait time and delayed service because this is usually the busiest day of the week. We were wrong, they took great care of us! The front desk helped us out quickly and easily giving us a wait time of 30 minutes, when in actuality they called us back in 10. Our waiter Ann was perfect, she was sweet, entertaining and attentive.  She kept us laughing the whole time and was speedy with everything perfect! I highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory and try to get Ann as your server because she is amazing and so much fun to talk to.  Give this girl a raise! I will be returning soon. :)"
Juliene P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,31,11,4.0,3/17/2015,"Great food. Mediocre service. Love Cheesecake Factory because of their cheesecakes of course and their Grilled Porkchops with mashed potatoes , apple sauce (something like that) and asparagus( originally the meal comes with spinach) . I am hooked with that grilled Porkchops. It's perfectly cooked, juicy and just so delicious! Everyytime I go to cheesecake I order the Porkchops. I definitely recommend it.  Service is ok. Our server wAs somewhat attentive. I guess.  Valet parking is 10$"
Annie S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,26,,1.0,10/4/2016,"Just when I was enjoying eating here again, I had a bad experience. In short, the waitress brought me the wrong dinner item, than was not to be seen until much later in the meal, than she admitted she knew it was wrong. I choose not to make a big deal of it but I did I reach out two times ""behind the scenes"" over a month ago and never received a response. Want to make a bet that now I get some sort of a acknowledgment. I should have accepted the offer for a proper order since I don't think I will be going back any time soon again."
