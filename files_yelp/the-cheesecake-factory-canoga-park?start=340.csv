Leny Z.,"Chatsworth, CA",9,19,24,4.0,1/2/2015,"We waited 45 mins to be seated but all worth it. First time ordering the Criapy Chicken Costalleta and my boyfriend ordered his usual, kobe burger. All worth the wait. The costalleta is fresh, light, crispy and juicy! Kobe burger always consistent. Will be back to this Cheesecake Factory!"
Omar M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,9,1,3.0,11/24/2015,This place sucks.first I have to wait 3 hours to eat and it's my nieces birthday!but the food is good so just don't come to topanga Cheesecake Factory cause it's crowded
Jamie R.,"Montebello, CA",208,22,5,3.0,2/20/2016,"Good food and great place to eat, but waited for 2hrs to be seated and another 35 minutes to get our food."
Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,3.0,12/23/2013,"They have Cheesecake It's a cheesecake factory - no more or less.  The service and food quality is on par with some of the better cheesecake factory resturants I've been to, but it's not my favorite.  The main reason I'm writing this review is the location - it's not always that easy to go to.   It's at the tail end of a mall and the parking alone can get very difficult on a weekend evening.  The mall is always crowded so be default so is this place.  Be mindful of that when coming here and expect a long wait/evening if coming during peak times."
Steve W.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",6,107,,4.0,8/8/2016,First time for Sunday brunch at the bar. Bartender was outstanding. Food was great and plentiful. Very nice brunch menu. Great drinks and the bar tender made us one of your new drinks that come out this week. The espresso martini needed a tweek with a half ounce of cream added and is outstanding now.  Will be back next Sunday
Kami H.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",4,65,39,5.0,11/10/2014,The Cheesecake Factory never fails. Every location always has the best service and the most amazing variety of food.
Fred M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,2,1,5.0,7/5/2015,"We've been always hoping for our date night out, but instead we arrived for a family outing and had such a great experience. The staff is so family friendly. They really treat you well. Everything is good. Ordering the off menu items were a real win. The soba noodles item is really full of flavor and texture, and also is very filling. The salted caramel cheesecake is another great surprise. This restaurant is worthy of five stars."
Avetis A.,"WEST HILLS, CA",3,12,,1.0,9/17/2016,"I've typically had decent service and food. However, my last visit was horrid. We waited 30 minutes for our food... once it came it was salty, cold and just gross. No drink refills, no follow up, nothing... Finally I asked for a Manager, she came, apologized, brought be something else... sandwich dripping in mayo, wrong bread and again, salty.  I called and spoke to the GM and he said ""ok, sorry about that, hope to see you soon"". NOPE.. Never again. Lost a customer."
Daniel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,5.0,10/8/2016,"Always great service when we come here. They made a mistake on my food, but the manager came right over and fixed everything. Servers are super nice and attentive and the food was great. Overall I had a great experience!"
Leon K.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/14/2014,"This review is solely based on the negligent service we received before we were even seated. The food itself was very good, and our waitress was very genial and attentive. We were given a 20 minute wait time, and after about 30 minutes of waiting, we asked one of the hostesses how much longer we needed to wait, to which she replied ""any minute now"". After another 15 minutes of waiting, we again asked what was taking so long and the same hostess assured us that our name was just about to be called. After yet another 10 minutes of waiting (I'm being objective), I insisted on speaking with the manager. When the manager arrived, the hostesses claimed that not only was our name already called (which it certainly was not), but that we had already received a text notifying us that our table was ready (a bold-faced lie). One of the hostesses even had the audacity to claim that she had never seen me before.  Though we were eventually seated and had a good lunch, the lack of professional courtesy and attention was disgusting. Nothing could justify the hostesses' rude and untrue remarks about their customers. The management needs to do a better job of training their hostesses to be professional and accommodating rather than accusatory and defensive."
Jamie C.,"West Hills, CA",72,422,3688,3.0,3/8/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is ok, I usually eat here because of someone elses choosing, but when that time rolls around I'll go with it. This restaurant gets busy and there's almost always a wait. The workers though are usually friendly, I've always had a pleasant dining experience here.  Servers have always been most attentive and most informed. On a scale of 1-10 on loudness in the restaurant, I'd give it a 8.5.  It's near impossible to enjoy an intimate dinner here. For tasters-I do like the Avocado Egg Rolls, 3-fat egg rolls are stuff with fresh avocado, sun-dried tomato and cilantro sliced into 6-pieces, comes with a side of tamarind cashew sauce. French Country is a nice appetizer of mixed salad greens tossed in a light vinaigrette with beets, pecans & goat cheese Complimentary Sourdough & Squaw bread  I'm so predictable when it comes to my entree, I usually order the Lemon-herb roasted chicken.  The chicken is moist, sits on a good amount of creamy red potato mash cooked in a nice zesty sauce and topped with fresh herbs; portions are generous I recently ordered the Shepard's Pie and wasn't thrilled-its too heavy/saucy, the ground beef inconsistent in texture, with large chunks of ground beef within tender smaller ground beef; mash is always creamy good  Chicken Maderia is decent I've had a few of their cheesecakes.  Most recently: Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake With dessert I usually get a hot cuppa water and the tea selection-NOA & Numi  The patio maybe refreshing for some, it is certainly comfortable as far as tempurature-stays toasty on cold evenings, but uncomfortable as far as seating goes. On my last visit the table behind us couldn't get in an out of his seat without excusing himself and vice versa. Self parking is off Trillium-in the business park parking structure, 2-hours are free with validation. Valet is available."
Brett W.,"Calabasas, CA",1,22,1,1.0,3/13/2016,"The wait is ridiculous! They claim they'll text you when your table is ready but that just means you get to wait inside for another 10-15 min. after the text. Too many jerky kids working the front. After seated I ordered fish and chips which was greasy and my gf ordered tuna tartar which she said was ok. The service was awful, the noise is unbearable and then they play the most horrible background music I've ever heard. Not worth it!!!"
Maryam A.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",192,113,14,3.0,10/16/2014,"Not going to lie.... I miss the old location on Canoga! I know this is much bigger and blah blah blah, but this location lacks character and the right staff! Your waiter won't check up on enough because they're huddled in a corner with their pals, gossiping and whatnot. Or you get the pervy waiter who tries to spit game at you, in front of your husband, from the minute you sit down! To the bland tasting food that used to be so damn good!  Kind of disappointed...."
Mari F.,"Northridge, CA",18,32,43,3.0,1/18/2015,"Service was good, CF always excels in that area. First time that I come for their Sunday Brunch.. it was okay. I thought I'd order something different,  so I got the Montecristo Sandwich with a side of potatoes. Sandwich was good, basically a breakfast sandwich with French Toasted bread. The potatoes made me feel sorry I didn't opt for the sliced tomatoes. They were severly over cooked, they were more like potato  chitlins.. and they looked oily. I may have eaten 3, but no more."
Jennifer M.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,65,24,5.0,1/11/2015,"They don't take reservations (which i was aware of already). I showed up on a Friday afternoon with a large party for my daughter's birthday and they were very accommodating and kind.  Garrett was the host taking our info, he went above and beyond to get us seated and keep me informed as far as wait time. Sarah was our waitress ,she was very sweet and attentive."
Heyz E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,30,5.0,6/8/2015,"Food is always great at the place as well as the service. From receptionist to server, service is great. Its not as pricey as you think. Lunch special are at huge portions until 5pm. If you dont plan to take home the rest, just stick with the lunch specials."
Steph H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",39,162,60,3.0,11/25/2014,"Just came in for a late night dessert. Was ok. Too much whipped cream on the two desserts we ordered. We ordered coffee and they came in clear glasses that were very dirty and unfortunately we did not notice until we were almost finished and it was pretty dark in there, I can only imagine what they looked like in the light. Not sure if we will be coming back."
Phrab R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,2.0,8/28/2016,Chicken & biscuits has changed for the worse. Biscuits were stale.   Whole dish was terrible. Service was slow. The Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks is much better. Live & learn!
Amir K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",7,59,25,1.0,9/3/2015,"I'm still reeling from this move.  Yes, the Trillium was a complete dump and never caught on because of the hideous pink granite tiles that covered the entire inside and outside of the building, but at least the Cheesecake Factory was HUGE with a great wait staff and laid out better than any other restaurant in the valley.  It's been a few years now since they've gone to the old CPK location and it's simply not enough space nor wait staff to handle the type of business that Cheesecake does.  They've also setup the patio, but it's the valley!  Nobody's going to sit outside for like 5 months out of the year due to the heat/cold.  Anyway, onto this particular experience...  They take your cellphone number to text you when your table's ready, but once you check-in with them you need to then wait another period of time until they seat you.  I can only assume that the point-of-sale alerts the hostess to call you when the credit card for the party vacating the table you're going to be on is swiped.  But some people like to hang around after paying the bill and shoot the breeze, thus causing this bizarre scenario where your table is ""ready"" but not really.  Moving past that, we ended up with absolutely atrocious service from our waiter who was either overworked or completely clueless.  Our drinks took nearly 20 minutes to come out and the food at least another 20.  The kitchen seemed like it was in total chaos.  I also saw the manager berate another waiter in front of us and both seemed visibly distraught over the situation.  Ironically enough, when it came time for us to pay, the waiter who was cut down by his manager helped us out by handling the check. Food:  Typical Cheesecake food.  Quality is good, portions are huge and there's always something for everyone on the menu.  Nothing ever stands out or is particularly memorable about the food, but everyone gets on well with whatever they ordered.  It's a known quantity. I hope for this restaurant's sake that it's planning on moving to the new part of Westfield that's designed to mimic the Grove.  If they signed a long-term lease here and are stuck in this little spot, I don't think I'm ever coming back given the new options that will inevitably open up once the build-out is complete."
Angelica R.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",3,111,38,3.0,8/10/2015,I really don't understand why the cheesecake won't ever do reservations. It's first come first serve. We waited over an hour 45 minutes for our party of 11 to sit. It was my sister in laws birthday and she wasn't too pleased with the service and neither were we. I always get my usual plate the white chicken chili it's one of my favorites and I haven't tried anything besides this. For my next time I will  try to order something else. But the food is always good here no complains.
