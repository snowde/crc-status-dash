Ashley B.,"Castaic, CA",0,49,,5.0,1/17/2016,I really like this Cheesecake Factory. I usually get the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce but I tried the Steak Diane and it was delicious. It may be my new favorite. It's a bit crowded most nights but they are very good at trying to get you seated. I wish the bat area was a little more open but the bartender and busser we had worked great together and were funny. And of course I was very happy when our waitress remembered to bring our cheesecakes to go at the end. And she even remembered that my father said he loved the cherries and gave him more on the side.
Jenna S.,"West Hills, CA",12,4,14,5.0,5/8/2015,Awesome nachos. Happy hour rocks. Where can you get full size nachos for $5.50? Cheesecake Factory happy hour that's where.
Jan B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,36,15,1.0,8/19/2016,"After my not so great, but honest review, Cheesecake Factory left me a message through YELP saying they want to ""speak with me directly"" about my experience and asked me to go to their site which I did. I assumed there would be a phone number to call, but not the case, just a generic form to fill out that required all my personal data including name, phone, email,  home address which I reluctantly gave them thinking they would perhaps call...still have not heard back from them and has been over 4 days now.  So after they bait and switch me, to leave all my data, they still don't care enough to call, discuss or perhaps dig deep and offer a ""comp"" of some sort.  We've been to their establishments in so many cities and states including Nevada, Arizona, of course here in California including Marina, Beverly Center, Woodland Hills, Sherman Oaks, Palm Desert..on and on..oh well, kinda thought they might care, but me thinks not!  Guess we'll just ""delete"" them from our data base and move on..."
Gary W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,21,4,1.0,1/15/2016,"Keep forgetting not to go to Cheesecake Factory, especially this one. Thought I'd pop in for a quick meal at 5pm and even though it was 70% empty I had to wait for 20 minutes and then they seated me in the far corner of the freezing cold outside area.  Gotta set a reminder once a month to tell me to avoid this overpriced pile of crap.  Especially now when there are so many new first-rate restaurants in this area, plus the excellent Roy's and a fine steakhouse just a quick walk across the street."
Valentina G.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",4,12,,1.0,3/8/2017,"Customer service at this Cheesecake Factory is terrible and unacceptable. I called in 2 days ago to order a 10 in strawberry cheesecake and was told ""its our most popular cake, we always have it. Today is wednesday, I walked to the bakery and asked for the 10 inch strawberry cheesecake and I also wanted a white chocolate Happy Birthday saying( thats 3.95$ extra. I was told by Eric that it would be about 15-20  minutes wait because they ran out of dark chocolate for the name. I came back to the store in 20 min and they didn't even start putting the strawberries with glaze on the cheesecake. I complained and the manager came over- never apologized or spoke to me- he is actually a jerk- I have conversed with him before and credited me back the $3.95. IT ACTUALLY TOOK ME 30 MINUTES TO GET A STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE TO GO!!!!!  UNACCEPTABLE- AND WILL NEVER ORDER FROM CHEESECAKE FACTORY AGAIN----MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO WORK ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION!!"
Maggie M.,"Canoga Park, CA",56,19,4,2.0,1/27/2016,"My family and I go here often. The food is always on point, however the 2 stars are due to the customer service at the front. On Sunday I had to wait an additional 15mins after I received the tex that my table was ready. The people in the font were distracted talking about their personal business rather than paying attention to the paying customers."
Jon B.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/6/2016,"Cheesecake Factory offers a very good classic burger and/or kobe burger. I always eat it without the bun. Unfortunately, they have great difficulty cooking it to your desired request. It seems about every third or fourth visit, when I ask for either medium rare or medium, it either comes out almost completely uncoooked or well done. Today, my wife and I took the gamble again and we ordered the kobe burger, asking very pointedly that we would like it medium rare. We also ordered two cokes .My wife is delighted with her medium rare burger. Mine is nuked and well done.  The waitress takes it back and says it will take five or six minutes. Twelve minutes later, she returns with another burger.  My wife has been patiently not trying to finish hers out of courtesy to me as her burger is now getting cold. The manager asks me to check the new burger.  I cut into it and it's basically still breathing; raw as it can be.  He agrees and takes it back.  I tell him this will be the last time.  He returns about seven minutes later as my wife's burger is now cold and unappetizing. Upon his return, I cut open the burger again (the same burger) and it's still blood red. Manager says he's sorry, and he offers me a slice of cheesecake in place of the burger.  Being on a diet, I decline. Now being frustrated and growing a bit angry, I ask for the check.  The waitress returns about ten minutes later.  I am charged for one kobe burger and two drinks at $3.50 each.  They didn't even have the decency to comp the drinks after all that occurred. I paid and left.  I've had enough of this restaurant that is run like and back alley ""factory."""
Yasha A.,"Los Angeles, CA",715,203,10,5.0,9/28/2014,"This place is always delicious, but the best time to come here is during happy hour when their best appetizers better priced. Their avocado egg rolls are by far the best thing the have on the menu. Their bread, at least the brown bread, is always fresh and the servers are very friendly."
Vjustin C.,"Hawthorne, CA",59,126,11,2.0,7/13/2014,"Service here is poor. At the desk, they barely call out your name. Its like a whisper. They dont make an effort to look for the person, they just say it once or twice then take your name off the list. the lady told me it would be about 20 minutes. So at 30 minutes i went to check and she said it was called 10 minutes ago. So we basically had to wait again. That should have been a sign to leave. At the table, our server/s didnt introduce themselves. When i asked they said why? I said so i can address you properly (duh??)  Food is a lot, it was a bit cold. The bread was a little stale. Its definitely a lot, you should bring your appetite. Its good for family. Also cheesecake is amazing. So many to choose from!"
Claudean B.,"PACOIMA, CA",6,27,5,3.0,11/22/2015,2 1/2 hour wait for a table.  Staff was friendly and I appreciated their service.  It was a Saturday night and everything was overwhelming.  Lots of people waiting for some cheesecake and dinner. Food was just so- so.  Definitely not worth the wait.  Not impressed with this location.  I work in Old Pasadena.  I order lunch from the Pasadena Cheesecake Factory .  Like their food better.  But the parking is a little better at the Topanga Mall location.   Maybe this location is better doing the week.  BTW the cheesecake itself was excellent.  Better to just go in order cheesecake to go and get your dinner someplace else.
Andreas I.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,7,,1.0,1/4/2015,"Ordered the steak Diane and shrimp combination plate. The plate came and I immediately was shocked by how ridiculously small the portions were. The steak pieces were literally bite size and not tender. I finished the plate in 2 minutes and was neither full or satisfied. Poor quality steak and shrimp. This is unusually because usually, this place serves big portion plates... Very dissatisfied.  Be more persistent with your portion sizes. If you are gunna serve small plates like that, don't charge $20. There is an appetizer portion on the menu for a reason."
John H.,"Cupertino, CA",0,68,3,2.0,3/19/2016,"I fail to see the draw of this place. The ""no wait"" we got over the phone turned out to be 15 min, and the reality was about 20 min. then they wouldn't give us a seat by a window which was reserved (did I mention they don't take reservations) for people that didn't show up for a half hour.  The Chicken Piccata that I had was OK but I was sick all night from the cheesecake I had for dessert an hour after dinner. As the crowd got louder, management kept turning the background misic up to the point where I couldn't heard my wife and daughter. Please, don't give me any gift cards for the Cheesecake Factory."
Sean M.,"West Hills, CA",449,459,613,4.0,6/30/2011,"Some times it's 5 stars, sometimes it's 3, so overall a 4. Food is good old cheesecake factory, no surprise there. Cheesecakes are AMAZING but it'll take a month of working out burn off... Thus it's best to share 1 piece cheesecake for 4 people. Service is usually top notch. My Favorite Cheesecake Factory is still the one in the galleria though."
Elena S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,19,3,1.0,12/29/2015,"Today i stopped by with my coworkers for lunch.  Everyone paid cash, except me,who's paid by credit card.  Sure enough i forgot to take card out,  called and they dont have it. This is only place i stopped by today.  Called bank to close card. Our server was Felipe.  Im not blaming him,  but card is lost."
Slick M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/11/2016,I really wanna say thank you guys for everything you guys have done for me the food is amazing I Love going to work
Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148,4.0,6/16/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory has been here as long as I can remember. My parents went here when I was in high school -- and that was a long time ago. I've been going here on and off for the better part of the last 10 years or so. It's a really dependable somewhat high-end restaurant -- good food and usually excellent service. I've also been to locations in other California cities. The menu is massive -- pages and pages of items. The adage that a restaurant should have a small menu and do a few things really well is thrown out here. (I've read a lot about Cheesecake Factory through the years including a recent LA Times piece and a Time magazine article. The company is open about their practices, how they choose their menu items, etc. The menu is entirely based on which items sell -- if one doesn't even if the executives like it, it's removed from the menu.) This location is large too. It has a sizable outdoor patio in back that overlooks a deserted small tennis stadium. The bar area is first come, first serve. There's almost always a lot of people waiting for tables in the front foyer. They start you off with a bread basket with both a wheat and French bread. Both are tasty and you have to focus on not eating too much. They'll bring you more. I can't think of a bad meal I've had at any Cheesecake Factory. They're consistently tasty if not always remarkable and memorable. Their drinks are usually delicious.  Their portions are huge. I remember reading that they're designed to take half to go. They now offer a nutritional guide along with your menu. This is helpful because some of the dishes are 2,000+ calories. Their new calorie friendly menu is called Skinnylicious and offers a lot of appetizers, salads and entrees. Some of the items are already on the main menu. Their cheesecake selection, naturally, is huge. Slices are big and rich. Getting one to go after your meal so you can have a few bites at home and put it in the fridge is a good idea. Parking is in the structure in back or valet. They validate. I've heard they train their servers for two weeks before they set them loose in restaurants. Service always seems to be their best attribute over food or atmosphere. I wish other businesses knew how to train their employees like this chain. I've been to celebration events in their reserved spare room. That room seats a lot of people. Whether a romantic meal, a family brunch/lunch/dinner or a celebration, can't go wrong at the ol' Cheesecake Factory."
Daniel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,104,23,1.0,6/9/2015,"I came here for the happy hour with some family one afternoon last week and we sat at a table in the bar area.  We had a waitress I think her name was Shermerca or Shermaca.  Anyways, usually I get great service when ever I go to any Cheesecake Factory location.   But, I think because it a new location here because the servers aren't top notch and our waitress was a perfect example of that.   Examples of horrible service were:  -My water I ordered it with lemon and she brings me ice water. -when she did bring the water to me she spilled water on me -she took forever to bring the food  I was very disappointed with my service here and I will not be returning to this location until management hires some better servers."
Linda N.,"Reseda, CA",99,5,95,2.0,12/17/2015,"Went here yesterday for Happy Hours. Horrible experience. Went in, sat down, and no one greeted or even came to our table for a good 10 minutes. Tried to wave down a waitress but they were all so busy ""doing their jobs"". We sat there like losers being ignored. No water, menus or anything. Finally got a waitress attention, she claimed to not be our server but offered to get us water and menus. She never returned and just ignored us from then on. Got another waitress attention and we were finally helped. Had a hard time waving her down to order food too,etc. Waited more than 40 minutes for our food. What's funny is that the table next to us order after us and get their food before us. I noticed that and asked them to check on our food or else it would have never arrived. Never have I been treated like this at any restaurant. I was so upset and embarrassed that I wanted to leave. We are paying for our food and the service, it's not like we came there to beg for food. Horrible horrible service and experience. I've been here multiple times for both happy hours and for dinners. With the amount of money that I spent and the service I received, I'm a very disappointed customer."
Christine F.,"Northridge, CA",0,13,1,2.0,5/31/2015,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan, but this is going to be a bad review. This was my first time at the new location in the mall. We waited 45 minutes for a table - no problem, it's a Friday night so that's normal. Once we were seated the problems began. The waiter was friendly and polite, but he forgot to bring our drinks. I had to flag him down to remind him. He ran off and drinks arrived about 10 minutes later. Then, he offered us bread which he also forgot to bring. I had to ask again. It took about 20 minutes just to get bread! The food also took forever and my husband's steak was not cooked the way he asked for it but he was so hungry he just ate it. No way were we going to send anything back because we would never see it again. It doesn't end there. They left out one of my husband's side dishes saying they would bring it separately. As you probably guessed by now, another very long wait ensued.  I had to flag down a different waitress because our waiter was too busy talking too long with a group at another table. She said our waiter would bring it. By this time, my husband had finished his meal and got his potatoes separately at the end.  They obviously were extremely busy and understaffed, which is a management problem. I order a lot of food, drinks and I tip well but I expect good service and I didn't get it. What really annoyed me was that our server kept standing at another group's table chatting for way too long while we (and likely others) were being neglected. The servers need to learn how to manage overly chatty customers when they're in a time crunch. The ambience is also worth mentioning. The restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated but there is no escaping the cramped feeling at this location. The old location was far more open and roomy. We were in a booth that felt like those rollercoaster seats. The only thing missing was the belt. We were long time customers at the previous location but I don't think we will be back to this new location."
Joey N.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",50,111,26,1.0,6/11/2014,"You guys should have never left your original location on Canoga. I don't know if it's the oxygen in woodland hills that made your service so horrible or you guys just suck at making your wonderful dishes so horrible at this mall location. For the last 3 times I've been to the new place, you guys have failed in every aspect of a restaurant... I'm never eating here ever again!"
