Beaut S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",4,16,6,4.0,1/29/2016,Love their Louisiana Chicken pasta the most!! Have their dessert at the end is the sweet dream.
Kristine M.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",286,225,376,2.0,5/6/2014,"Hmm I'm not sure exactly how to rate/review this but here goes.  This was my first time at this location. I hadn't even known they had moved from Canoga, where, we had never encountered a problem. This, however, was possible my worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory ever and I frequent CF often, all across the country. We came for lunch around 12;30 on a Thursday. The wait was about 20 minutes, understandable. We were then seated all the way in the back, fine. Fine until we sat and sat and sat for a minimum of 15 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order let alone our food order. We both knew what we wanted before we sat down ('member frequent often). The waiter, who couldn't smile if his life depended on it, took our order and at least another 10 minutes passed before we got our drinks. They are in desperate need of an extra food/drink runner. My lunch companion then notified our waiter that there was gum under the table that was now stuck on her silk pants. His response ""what do you want me to do about it ? "", Oh, worst response ever! She asked for the manager who didn't come. The waiter finally returned and proceeded to scrap the gum off the table and give her a napkin for her pants.  The food took another 20 or so minutes. The food tasted good, as usual. Well, everything except the bread they bring, that was hard :( This was turning into the longest lunch ever and with no drink refills (until the check)!  My friend told the waiter the manager still had not stopped by. When he finally arrived he apologized and handed her a dry cleaners card. HA. Usually CF are on top of it, doesn't matter if you're busy, CF are always busy. Disappointing visit."

Cindy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,15,4,3.0,12/6/2015,"Service is decent. If you feel like eating at a place that has pretty nice ambience with large portion sized mediocre food, then this is the spot for you."
Carlita B.,"Canoga Park, CA",4,12,,4.0,1/4/2016,This is my favorite restaurant and has been since I was a child. Not too thrilled about the re-location to Topanga Mall. The space is much more crowded and small which makes for a longer wait.
Linda T.,"Moorpark, CA",20,25,3,5.0,8/28/2015,Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory!?!? Yummy warm bread and a huge menu to choose from! I will take one of everything!! And don't get me started on cheesecake!!!! Sooooo good!!!! :)
Asefeh N.,"Encino, CA",39,8,6,5.0,12/26/2013,Great food ! Try the bang bang chicken and shrimp over pasta . The new location is great ! Loved it ! Never leave disappointed.
Lisa Marie M.,"Vancouver, Canada",1511,502,4163,3.0,9/11/2012,"For as huge of a menu they have, I had a hard time finding  something that appealed. I had a peach Bellini that was just OK. The skinny sangria was actually pretty good my GF had a diet coke. I like that they show the calorie count on things - it helped me avoid the cheesecake ! From the Low Cal menu I had the crab cake appetizers that were ok - nothing spectacular. I also ordered the chicken taco salad that was huge and tasty but lacked chicken. My friend had the low carb mediteranian chicken wraps which she said were quite good. The service was decent, the parking is in a garage that was confusing to find, but at least they validated."
Minnie T.,"West Hills, CA",6,1,,2.0,8/16/2016,"My disappointed and annoyed experience at this Cheesecake Factory. We ordered two Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp to go. Which I was really looking forward to enjoying my food when we got home. Well that was a disappointment by itself. When we arrived home, I went  straight for the food. First let's start off with the presentation it look like they just threw it together rushing. This was the  lightest sauce  I've ever seen on the shrimp. Which was supposed to be blackened. Then unbeknownst to me they change the mango salsa to a pineapple salsa. Which was nasty. We didn't receive our Plantain. It was an epic fail !!! So I decided to give them a call to let them know how disappointed I was. I first asked, have there been any changes to the menu. The lady stated "" no not that I know of "". Ok when working in a restaurant, aren't you supposed to know about any changes when it comes to the menu. So I then asked to the Manager, which took forever. At leased she knew that there was a change in the salsa. End results getting gift card, but will not use it at that location. If I actually received them. Lol"
Dandri  B.,"Sacramento, CA",116,13,73,4.0,7/12/2015,"One of my favorite restaurant chains. If you been to one you've been to them all. Great service, food comes out hot, very clean, and extremely organized. If you like The Cheesecake Factory this one is not a late down."
Erin D.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,9,6,2.0,1/20/2016,"Not thrilled, the menu is so big that no one dish is perfect. The cheesecake was gross & the original plain cake was close to 8$ after taxes.. I can go to trader joes and pay 8$ for a much better tasting whole cheesecake. I've been here several times hoping one visit would be worth going back for but hasn't happened yet."
Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,4.0,8/22/2014,"My mom and I stopped in here for happy hour after checking out this mall for the first time. Our waitress was Laura and she was SO nice. It was refreshing to have such a happy, helpful, kind waitress! The happy hour food was pretty good, not my favorite of what The Cheesecake Factory has to offer, but great happy hour prices nonetheless. Our waitress was the best part - she was so helpful, telling us more about the area since we had never been there before. Also, the hard lemonade during happy hour is delicious! Fun, friendly place."
Anonymous A.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",1006,58,29,5.0,4/14/2014,"Props to cheesecake factory for creating the same fancy and luxurious experience in a busy and crowded shopping mall. It's tucked away in the quiet upper corner of the mall, and maintains a romantic and intimate booth experience.  I went there for the pizza and salad lunch special, and got an amazing meal for an amazing price!  This is one of the nicest and most affordable lunch places in the mall!"
Denise T.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,39,2,1.0,5/14/2014,"First of all, ask your guests if they're okay with the tacky mall seating. I don't want to eat my dinner and see people walking out of Sears.  Secondly, if you ask us if we mind a table with a chair out for the 5th person and we say yes, we do mind. DONT GIVE US A TABLE WITH A CHAIR OUT.  Thirdly, if one persons food comes out almost 15 minutes after everyone else's, you should be a little more apologetic than what I saw.  Seriously? This place needs to get it together. I seriously was so disappointed with my dining experience tonight and I felt the management and server did absolutely nothing to accommodate us to three different f*ck ups."
Nima S.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,70,12,1.0,4/17/2014,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!  I can't believe a restaurant of this caliber provides such crappy service.  I was literally denied mustard and olive oil.  Without being finished our lame ass waitress came and took away the olive oil.  She didn't even ask.  I was with friends that I hadn't seen in a while and it looked like this place only cares about making money.  The waitress was pushing deserts on us.  I was there to eat, not be hassled by a pushy saleswoman. I don't know why I gave this stingy server a tip.  I should've reported her to the manager. If you want to be over charged for bland food and semi professional service where you might go hungry come here. Parking is hard to find."
Aida E.,"Palmdale, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/30/2016,My experience was not good first time by recomendacion and I order my food not cook how I requested turning back  and when they bring in again it was a hair in my food and on top of that the manager come and reap the check in my face and said you don't own anything have a good day very disrespect like I come to ask for a free food I was very disappointed the way the manager handle the situation.
Marquez M.,"Palmdale, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/9/2016,"Great food!!! Service was okay, but very friendly staff. What really upset me was the dog allowed in the restaurant!! I do not have a problem with service dogs , but this one did not have a vest and scared the crisp out of one my daughters. I don't understand why the fog was allowed in the restaurant, but I know for a fact that I will not return to this location. It was a great experience until I saw that dog leaving the restaurant."
Mari E.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",5,28,30,4.0,6/6/2014,"I think with the new place they haven't figured out the front desk. Really very disorganized! I was told 20 min wait time, I know it's always give or take a few mins. I was paged after 24 mins, but after I came to the counter I still waited an additional 10 mins standing. Almost ruined my whole experience.  At our table James H. came buy was super friendly and came over with our drinks. He really made our dinnner enjoyable.  James H would get a 5 star!! The food was also tasty. I would recommend coming to this location. Hopefully they can figure out the front."
joe j.,"Tarzana, CA",0,10,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Went to cheesecake factory last night with friends.  They sat us at 8:10, (way in the back where by the mall stores.)  Waiter finally came by brought water after 8:30. finally ordered, received 2 out of 3 dishes for the table.  My meal looked as though it was sitting in the window for while as pasta was dry and crispy on the top.  10 minutes later, received the third meal, tacos, hardly any sauce on them had to ask for extra, which also took a long time to get.  Had to send my meal back, ordered something else, finally after 20 minutes I told the waiter to forget it.  Manager brought the meal anyway 5 minutes later.  Manager then argued that it only took 14 minutes, (we timed it).  By the time we were done it was 10:00.  Service was horrible and slow, manager was less than helpful. Hard to find it to go back again."
Steven O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,712,1,2.0,5/31/2016,My wife and I came here because we received gift cards to this place.  This is the 3rd time I've ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory and probably my last.  I've ordered something different every time I've tried this place and the food is always mediocre at best.  I'm not sure what they do well but so far I haven't had it...and the likelihood that I'll ever stumble across it is super low considering their menu is ridiculously long.  Much better dining options than this place in the vicinity...save your money.
