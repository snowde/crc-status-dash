Krystal W.,"Granada Hills, CA",143,2,,1.0,12/13/2017,I'm here now eating really over it and don't want to be here. I guess I look young but I'm 26 years old and they are really giving me a hard time just to order a drink. I sat down and wanted to order happy hour at the main dining but got up to get my drink but the bar and they came over to stop me and said I cannot buy a drink if I'm sitting else where. Okay I'm sorry didn't know I was being that inconsiderate. The manager Justin is very quick to end the conversation not giving me good hospitality only reason why I'm here because my little brother wanted to eat here so bad and shop at the Topanga mall but this will be the last time I come here. And to think I'm a server myself this is the service they give. My server was Sam
Nanci W.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,13,7,1.0,8/24/2017,"This was the worst night. First of all the manager on duty was rude and disrespectful. There were 12 people in our party. The table was to small so we called over the manager and said we need another table. She got bent out of shape rolled her eyes and said ""WELL"" guess I will have to get you a table from out side. True unless you want us to sit on the floor. Took for ever to get our food . The waitress tried but she was the only one in our section. By the time the food came it was cold.  I have been going to the Cheese Cake factory for years, and this will be my last time. I was contacted by Cheese Cake factory to go on there website and they would call me. Update no call no email. Guess they just want you to think they care"
Angie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",171,24,3,5.0,1/2/2018,"Stacey is the best server! She kept our water filled, checked on us frequently and she is so friendly and helpful. The chicken piccata and Renee's special were delicious!"
J P.,"Calabasas, CA",8,196,218,5.0,5/1/2017,"This location always gets it right! The wait staff, the food and drinks, the deserts!!! The restaurant is always clean and bright. It dose get very busy during peak hours but it's well worth the wait. Call ahead and place your order then pick it up and pay at curbside!!! Life long customer I highly recommend the Chinese Chicken Salad. Enjoy!"
Ambrose N.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,4,1,1.0,10/7/2017,Very disappointed! At first I was like it is understandable but then it kept getting worse!. The service was really slow and it took more than half an hour to get our food out . We asked for more wheat bread and the host bought it out for us with his BARE hands . Who knows what he touched before that!! Very unsanitary! I am very disappointed and displeased ! Used to go all the time but I'm starting to rethink about it !
David K.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,200,7,1.0,3/21/2017,"Had a rude waiter once, and the food is generally bad. It was really awful on one occasion, I would have complained, but I was with friends.  Cakes are way too rich and sugary. Pretty much every entree on the menu is a worse version of something that can be got at some other nearby place that specializes in whatever that may be, and for less money. A slightly more upscale Chili's. Not a compliment. At least Chili's is cheap!"
Brianna T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,9,,2.0,8/9/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is usually one of my favorite places to dine and is the first place my family votes on for dinner; however, my parents just moved to this area and this location is now axed from our list.  We had a party of 7 on Sunday 8/6 and these are my complaints:  1. The table we were seated at was not cleaned well, if it at all. There was 4 forks under the table I stepped on, and shredded cheese on the table and the menu. There is so many employees working here that I could hardly get back to my seat after my bathroom visit.... but they don't have one to ensure tables are clean?  2. The bathroom. There was literally s____t on the seat of the toilet. Like all over it! 3. They brought my sister the wrong food. Once they did bring her correct dinner (30 minutes later) we were all finished.  4. They didn't even offer to comp her meal or discount anything on the menu for their mistake. Like, cmon. 30 minutes! Your mistake! DO SOMETHING."
Pas I.,"Inglewood, CA",104,39,43,4.0,8/16/2017,It's all about the cheesecake baby.  Red Velvet Cheesecake. Oreo Cheesecake . 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake. Carmel Turtle Cheesecake. Snicker Cheesecake. Key Lime Cheesecake. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. Carrot Cake Cheesecake.  The food? Meh.
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,3.0,6/20/2017,"Good experience. Had a quick lunch with the family here but the experience isn't what it used to be. The servers were working frantically and it just made it a bit uncomfortable. Lunch here seems to be high traffic and very loud. The food was good and the server was great too, just felt the overall experience wasn't the usual Cheesecake feel."
Laura Z.,"Arleta, CA",502,277,718,4.0,12/17/2016,First time at this location. It was a very lovely experience.  SERVICE- 4 STARS  Our waitress was super nice. She was very accommodating and very quick with our drinks and requests.  LOCATION-4 STARS It's in the mall and sort of outside of that makes sense. You can come eat and then walk off all the calories after.  AMBIANCE- 5 STARS  I  came during the week so it was fairly quiet and slow so I absolutely loved it.  FOOD- 4 STARS  You can never really go wrong at The Cheesecake Factory. The prices are low and the plates are huge!!!! I mean HUGE! Here's what we tried at this location.  EGGPLANT PARMESAN- 4 STARS: it comes with 4 eggplant patties deep fried with tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese melted on it. So filling and go good. I was only able to eat 1.5 patties
Brian S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,583,137,4.0,2/12/2017,There are things to love about The Cheesecake Factory and things to hate about it. Consistently good food and drinks and large portions is to be loved. Service lately has been good. All of our needs were taken care of. Interestingly no offer of water... but we didn't ask so all's well.  Cheesecake prices quite high but it's always yummy. The wait... No reservations... Tiny waiting area...
Aryo S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",418,231,776,5.0,11/29/2016,"---Atmosphere, Service, Parking---- The Cheesecake Factory here now occupies the space where CPK once was; that's now located inside the mall somewhere. With the same look and feel of other locations elsewhere, it's a great setting. Something to make note is that the location has two patios here, one is situated outside, and another patio is inside the mall setting. The restaurant is located at the entrance of the mall where there is also a valet area structured between Neiman Marcus and the old Sears building.  I've found service to be generally pretty solid with a couple misses here and there. Expect it to be fairly busy at all times.  Located at the Westfield Topanga Mall parking is all around you, good luck! --Food, Drinks & Prices--- I'm sure you know what they provide here and at the many other locations; the menu is vast with all sorts of things. Many appetizers, small plates, pasta dishes, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads, tacos, chicken and steak dishes, seafood, and all other sorts of entrees, ranging and hitting many flavors of different cuisines. Portions are large and same with the calories in everything (don't look!).  Love the fresh bread and butter they serve first. I've pretty much loved everything I've had at the Factory over the years, can't go wrong with anything really.  Here's a few things I've tried: -Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado lovers unite! Tons of it obviously with a couple other ingredients mixed in served with a tamarind dipping sauce.  -Tex-Mex Eggrolls - Crispy rolls filled w/spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese. Served with avocado cream and a pica de gallo.  -Buffalo Bites - Lots of breading on this thing but for those who love buffalo sauce these are filled with chicken, cheese and wing sauce.  -Crab Cakes - Three of them I believe and pretty tasty.  -Meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread - Great meatballs and sauce, served with great bread for dipping -Chicken Scampi Pasta - All the great flavors of a scampi, delicious.  -Steak Diane - Medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Great! -Pumpkin Cheesecake - If you like pumpkin pie you'll adore this just the same.  All sorts of drinks and a full bar is available. Something to note is that The Factory has it's own line of wine, I believe beer as well (I may be wrong on that).  Prices are in the $5-20ish range."
Tasha T.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",2,5,1,1.0,8/23/2017,"Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed in my visit last night. Myself and my family were celebrating my husband's new coaching job and decided to have dinner at your restaurant.  Although I was pleased with the timely manner in which the team was able to seat us, the waitress was a but preoccupied and passed us a few times before bread was presented to the table or a drink order was taken.  Due to the fact that I too work in customer service, I was able to give her the benifit of the doubt understanding she was busy.  Once my order was placed and received, I was highly disappointed in the Mac and cheese that I'd ordered as a side dish. It was extremely watery and lacked in flavor. When expressed to the waitress, she said ok and took the side away.  Not once did she offer to replace it or compensate me for it in any way.  My suggestion to you if this issue should accure in the future is to make sure your customers receive all the food they pay for.   As I may not continue to frequent your restaurant in the future."
Tigran P.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,12,4.0,7/16/2017,"Good variety of selections. Burgers never disappoint, Americano burger and Miso Salmon today."
Bonnie G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",132,776,676,5.0,1/15/2017,There is literally something for everyone here . I had the beet & goat cheese arugula salad & was soooo bad bad bad i ordered cream cheese wontons & lemon meringue cheesecake. No take out container necessary.  My friend had the lettuce wraps and actually three of us could have shared that dish. Her daughter had the chicken tenders & it was the biggest pile of chicken tenders i've ever seen. both needed take out boxes  . had about 10 minute wait at noon and Service was good for a Sunday afternoon but it's really loud when the restaurant is full . I recommend a booth to be able to talk at the table without yelling .
Payam Ali K.,"Canoga Park, CA",216,234,398,3.0,6/3/2016,"Why a 3/5 . Simple . This may be one of the easier reviews I have written . Cheesecake Factory is delicious everything from there small bites to entrees to there incredibly delicious cheesecakes However , this specific one always seems to rub me off the wrong way. This specific time I ordered take out and they said 20 min , got there in 30 , waited 15 min walked in and my food is just sitting there .  The service here on a good day is a 2/5 but the only thing I can say is that the service is not Up to par . Everything else hits the spot and is done well ."
Jason B.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",56,296,439,3.0,1/23/2017,"3.5 stars... Let's be honest, the sandwiches and pastas we eat here are just a ploy to get the cheesecakes for dessert... Started out with the Mexican egg rolls... Tex-mex filling wrapped in a crispy wrapper served with avocado dressing...my only complaint was they were a bit greasy. My wife and I split the dip sandwich and BBQ chicken salad. Both were tasty and as advertised. The wait was a bit excessive and I think it was the waitstaff as I had to send back cold fries for fresher reinforcements. Now to the main event... My wife played it safe and ordered her consistent favorite fresh banana, as always refreshing and flavorful. It was a bit icy leading us to believe these might be frozen cheesecakes?!? I opted for Chris's outrageous. Coconut, brownie, cheesecake, frosting, cake...where does it end one might ask...my stomach is always the reply.  Ambiance is desert sheik temple, wait staff was average, and prices were in line with expectation. We always come back... this is one chain that makes the list, bravo!"
Starlynn B.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/16/2017,"Just got a chicken and avocado club sandwich at the Cheesecake Factory at Topanga mall...and soo disappointed.  First off the menu doesn't say it has lettuce and tomato on it. I usually don't mind that but restaurant tomatoes are just not good these days and this place slices them as thick as a deck of cards!  Not good. The sandwich was thrown together and I could tell was just not put together with any care what-so-ever, I could not pick it up without it falling apart and had to eat it with utensils, not like a sandwich. Also the sweet potato fries were as cold as if they were cooked yesterday."
Istara Z.,"Woodland Hills, CA",351,124,234,5.0,10/6/2017,"Come here a lot with my husband for ok date night and am never disappointed. The service is always great, the place is always clean and customer service is awesome. Love the staff here and am always pleased with our service. Definitely recommend this place"
Sarah U.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",37,105,127,5.0,12/31/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory. My Miss America dream would not be for world peace, it would be for a Cheesecake Factory in slo so I didn't have to drive 3 hours to eat here.  The menu is massive, I've never been bored with it! And I haven't ordered anything I didn't like yet! Yummy martinis too"
