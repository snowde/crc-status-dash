M T.,"Waddell, AZ",2,8,54,2.0,3/6/2016,"Breakfast potatoes tasted metallic and the pancakes were undercooked, you could see the powder."
Michael S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",11,4,,1.0,3/20/2014,"Pretty disappointing dining experience all around tonight. Bad ambiance - don't let them seat you in the mall ""patio"" between the escalator and entrance to Sears. Its exactly as charming and comfortable as you would imagine eating a sit down dinner between a mall escalator and Sears entrance would be! Slow and mediocre service. - lots of waiting and I never did get an answer to a question about the beer selection... Consequently didn't get to order said beer.  Slow and mediocre food. - My sons fries didn't show up until he was done eating and the potatoes with my omelet were fried...And over fried at that! (I know, I know... Who has omelet and beer for dinner?!?) The manager (I assume?) had to repeatedly address a ridiculous wait for food one table over, but didn't bother to check on us, or any other table nearby (...that I saw at least) Last - you would think that a restaurant with this name would ask you if you want dessert - especially with a three year old sitting at the table. Didn't happen."
Charlotte S.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,31,2,3.0,9/30/2015,"Food is excellent and you can't help but eat too much cause your entree is so good and you can't skip cheesecake. But, as high end restaurants go, this one is ALWAYS too crowded and too loud. The service staff try their best, but getting seated is an ordeal and you'll notice a slower pace for ordering and getting your check. It's a shame this place has too many customers to handle, because they try and they have yummy food."
Larry M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,49,,4.0,9/30/2015,"Always happy with all my orders. Some servers are better than others (just like in any job I suppose, what can you do). I like cheesecake, but wish dessert menu added mochi ice cream. I really like the pager-text service they have when there is a wait (I usually take a stroll in the mall and even an hour wait flys by)."
Erin H.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",8,71,119,3.0,8/13/2014,Food is great but service is just ok. $7 for a slice of cheesecake to go and you can't remember the utensils or napkins? Epic fail Cheesecake Factory.
Howard L.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",607,78,5,3.0,9/25/2014,"They moved! I did not know this. So I went to the Canoga location, they have been there for over 20 years. It was always a good crowd there. They moved to the Westfield Mall, next to Sears. Now they get the mall crowd. Our waiter wasn't to happy about that either. Which he let us know. I loved this place, not this one, the one on Canoga. This one is smaller with more tables.  I ordered the calamari, which was still good. I also had a Caesar Chicken salad, not bad either. The food is still good. I guess my problem is I don't like eating at a mall. Where you are in a fishbowl for someone returning their iPhone."
Nate T.,"TARZANA, CA",216,7,,4.0,6/22/2016,"The bread is AMAZING! And the avocado egg rolls are must try! This place is perfect for birthday dinners or family dinners. The atmosphere could be fancy or even on the more casual side. The service is always great and the waiters and waitresses are always kind and patient. If you want a restaurant with great food and fairly affordable prices, The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect choice!"
Vanessa M.,"TARZANA, CA",128,327,41,4.0,7/11/2012,"I've been to this location two or three times, yesterday being one of them. CF always has excellent selection and quality. It's a great choice if you want to have a nice dine-in experience. However,  I'm giving it 4/5 stars due to its location. It's part of a corporate building center so it's not as attractive as it could or should be. The ""entrance"" is a bit confusing- there's a roundabout that's vallet only, and in order to go to its designated parking you have to find the entrance to the parking structure behind it, and it's not free. So, if I do come here, I make a point to park at the new LA Fitness lot across the street and walk there. Excellent service, though!"
jennifer w.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,15,1,5.0,11/19/2015,"I love this restaurant. I find the staff to be amazing, knowledgeable, and above and beyond on service. The food never disappoints. I often customize meals to be healthier and they have never failed at accommodating any request made. The servers are very knowledgable about the dishes and their Ingredients. There is a reason there is always a line out the door no matter the day or time. I will always be a very loyal customer."
Vee G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,12,57,3.0,11/18/2015,My go to Cheesecake Factory but I don't like the policy that only 6people and up can reserve a table.  I think it is totally unfair.
Mary H.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",229,22,36,5.0,3/8/2016,I came in the other night for dinner. Steffani was my waitress. She was the kindest most efficient waitress I've had on such a busy night. Louisiana pasta no mushrooms. Most pleasant night I've had in a while. Thank you waitress!!
Leah F.,"Simi Valley, CA",1,9,,1.0,11/7/2015,"This is the worst service I have had at Cheesecake. Very diasppointing because they always have a great service. Our drinks took about 20 minutes, the bread took even longer and my fiance and moms food came out before mine and I had soup and an appetizer. The waitress was so slow, didnt come by enough to check on us. Just a bad experience overall."
Rika K.,"West Hills, CA",0,34,2,2.0,10/3/2015,"Food quality is consistent as usual as all big chain restaurants are but what's lacking here is efficiency. It wasn't even that crowded today but the staff was terribly inefficient. We were told of a wait time of 15minute  for our small party of 3 and got called in at the 20minute mark- not bad at all! However, they called in 5 parties all in at once and we were left standing off awkwardly to the side in the crowded waiting area while leaving customers were trying to squeeze out towards the exit and servers were rushing in to deliver food. What's worse is that the hosts weren't even ready to seat any of the parties that they called.. And they just kept calling more parties in....And they took in parties that came in later first.... We had to go up to them TWICE to see what was going on, and to our demise, we realized that they had lost our ticket(our place in line) so they had forgotten about us and had to find us another table. But they still kept seating parties that were the same size as us that came later.. Just wow.  So in summary, we ended up waiting another 30minutes after we were called in for our nonexistent table. With a restaurant that did not look understaffed... This place was a terrible joke."
Cheryl P.,"Dallas, TX",211,429,574,5.0,6/25/2012,"It's always busy here so expect some wait.  But the complimentary bread and butter is worth to eat while waiting for your appetizer, entree and dessert. Everything I've tried has always been good here. Be prepared to take some time in choosing your food as the menu is super extensive! It can be a bit pricy for some but the portions are huge! Hosts/hostesses and waiters/waitresses are always accommodating and friendly. Parking is in structure so don't forget to bring your ticket for validation. You must try the ultimate red velvet cheesecake!"
Lyn L.,"Tarzana, CA",0,28,,1.0,12/9/2016,"Just terrible . . . what a disappointment. What has happened to Cheesecake Factory. Used to be so reliable. for dine-in and food to go. Haven't been in six months or so and WOW! Ordered 4 dishes and some desserts and one was more disappointing than the next. Bistro Shrimp Pasta was awful . . . Not the crisp shrimp batter . . . but a partly cooked flour tasting batter . . . miniscule amount of mushroom. Shrimp with Angel Hair - five VERY SMALL dried out shrimp on top of angel hair. Some tomato and garlic had been thrown on top of the pasta. Not tossed at all. Had to re-do it at home to make the pasta edible. Tossed the shrimp (That bad!) Chicken Romano - pieces of chicken again overcooked to the point of dry leather . . . tossed those, too. The Thai salmon was OK - over cooked but edible. As for the desserts - Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake has changed - very heavy on very sweet gooey layer - Linda's cake also has lost its balance. We have had a few poor experiences in the past months . . . this will likely take a long time family staple completely off the list for a while."
Nellie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",349,101,202,4.0,3/19/2012,"Seriously, who hasn't been to the cheesecake factory....at least 10 times in their lifetime.  Ok maybe I'm exaggerating, but not among the people I know who live in the area.  I feel like this next one is the default place for people to go to when they want a nice restaurant with good food, that requires no research at all..you just go.  Especially because it is great for seating a lot of people and for celebrating birthdays. Not to mention, when people are craving different cuisines, this is the place to go because they have over 200 menu items to choose from!  There's something for everyone.  Best of all, their portions are known for being generous and ideal for sharing or taking it to-go. But now for the real low-down.  The other reviews are right in that in ALL the years that I've been going here...ummm...since 1997, I have NEVER ONCE experienced a hitch in my dining experience. Not with the food, the service, anything.  Plus they've got something for everyone. So in that regard...its GOOD. HOWEVER, I'm so over it!  For like the past 8 years!  Every time someone suggests we go here i'm like whyyyy!?!?  Why not try something new and different?? Most of my friends are too chicken to drive a little further out to experience new restaurants, so they just stick to what they know.  I've seriously tried like almost everything on their menu. So be adventurous peopleeee!!! If  you've never been, then go! But don't be chicken to venture out and try something different!!"
S S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,3/23/2015,"This establishment is all over the place meaning some days it is a hit other days you can't believe they are in business. I think most of the managers here are new and in training so service is not great and they don't seem to get the point.  One way to fix this is to read reviews at Yelp, come on cheesecake,  people are providing feedback for free so take the time to read the comments and fix these issues.   Went last night,  food was bleek and service complemented mediocrity, manager was a no show and server was busy closing out her station and could care less about the service. They didn't bother asking of I wanted something in return, server couldn't communicate effectively,  amazing thing is that they were not even busy.  Cheesecake don't get too comfortable with 1.4% increase in 4th quarter revenue, if the service and food continues to be mediocre, you will be in the negative. This is the worst cheesecake I have ever been to."
Katya P.,"Lawrence, AR",218,9,5,3.0,8/24/2015,The mushroom fettuccini is the bomb. It's slightly melting sauce is one of the most scrumptious on the menu.
Alex A.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,88,,1.0,4/16/2014,"Our experience here was abysmal! When we got to the restaurant my spouse went to the restroom and waited ten minutes for someone to get soap to refill the dispenser.  Afterwards we sat down we waited nearly 25 minutes for drinks, and then after ordering our food two of the three dishes came out.  The last dish took another 25 minutes to come out at the point when the food was cold.  The waiter was nice and stated that the last dish would be brought out by the manager, yet a busier was sent out instead.   After speaking to the manager, the issue was not any better.  He was very condescending about our input on the experience and asked questions that were not relevant to the conversation.  He was very unprofessional and we left unsatisfied.  If service is a large part of what you're looking for, this is not the place!! Sadly I cannot even comment on the food as we did not even have a chance to eat."
Victoria M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",11,48,40,5.0,3/14/2014,"Stopped in for lunch! Customer Service was Great! Bartenders are really cool, Entertaining and friendly BTW the new version of The Blueberry Mojito was Yummy  Thanks Howard for being attentive"
