Anthony S.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",51,7,,1.0,4/12/2014,"Poor service/bad management:  Arrived at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner on 11 April.  Host took our name promptly and gave us a 40 min wait time (not bad for a Friday night).  After 50 min we receive a text telling us our table is ready.  We check in with the host and he tells us to wait a moment.  We move to the side awaiting a table.  10 minutes pass by and we've now witnessed 6 other groups get their seat.  I go to the group of employees and I ask who here has the time to take my party of two to a table.  They ask the name and take us over to a corner table towards the back of the restaurant facing Sears and Forever 21.  We sat on out door furniture as crowds poured off the escalator in front of us.  If that is the environment we were looking for we could have gone to the food court So I decide to make the best of it and roll with the rest of the evening.  Server comes over.  He was a nice enough guy and did not exceed nor fall below expectations. We place our order.  I choose the grande burrito.  No special instructions just the grand burrito.  Food comes over in a timely manner.  Take two bites and decide to cut it open since it seems like it's missing something.  To my surprise they forgot to put, what I consider the main ingredient, the meat (chicken) in the burrito.   I call the server over who offers to get me a new burrito.  I tell him at this point I'd rather just call it quits on the Cheesecake Factory.  He removes my plate and I wait while the gf enjoys her meal.   The manager comes over and says, ""sorry about your burrito."" I respond, ""not a big deal.""  And then he walks away.  I spent several years in the retail industry as a manager and the entertainment industry and wow does he lack what it takes to run a business.  I highly doubt I'd be back.  I'd rather spend 15-25 dollars a plate at a much better run organization."
Robert G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",207,138,290,4.0,6/17/2014,"The food at the Cheesecake Factory is always good ! But the wait and service could be a lot better, now since they are at the mall, it's even worse. Don't get me wrong, I still love the food !  Food 5 stars, Service and Wait 3 stars......."
Carrie S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",143,58,89,5.0,7/16/2015,"I had to review this restaurant chain after being a patron since the 1970's. It's about time! I was at their Topanga Mall location and saw that on page 8 they added superfood salads. I decided to try something other than my usual BBQ ranch chicken salad and went for a vegan cobb salad. I have to say it was fantastic! Unfortunately I didn't get a picture because I drove into it and ruined the beautiful display. I would definitely order that salad again. It had garbanzo beans, quinoa, avocado, lettuce, radicchio, cherry tomatoes, beats and a variety of other things... and was topped with a tangy vinaigrette. Although my stomach was exploding halfway through the salad - because I was so stuffed - I continued to eat because it was so tasty. I asked the waiter if it was a new item ( because I had never seen it before), and he told me that their particular location was the model for them to try these new salads. I hope they include them at their other locations."
Taylor A.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",1,6,,5.0,4/11/2015,Brett is hands down one of the best severs I have ever encountered and one of the nicest  people I've ever met. I took my mother there for her birthday and he made our experience there very pleasant. Will be back thanks to him. Give that man a raise! He deserves it.
Fred P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",98,21,1,1.0,5/1/2015,"So bad. First they sat us and put the menus that were dirty on our plates for the bread and butter, not cool. Then my carbonara came out cold. And then after everything I got food poisoning. I was a fan, but this was not pleasant for me. I'm sorry."
Ray N.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,130,32,2.0,7/11/2015,"Hey hostess, yeah you the rude one! What's your problem?! If you hate your job then look for another one!"
Frances W.,"Walnut, CA",244,133,66,5.0,7/11/2015,"What an exceptional Cheesecake Factory. I frequent this chain a lot but it was my first time here a couple days ago. I had two toddlers in tow and just wanted to get dinner with a friend. Right off the bat, as soon as we sat down, the servers understood right away what kids are like. They came by and took our order within 5 minutes, brought by bread and banana slices for my kids within 10 minutes, and we're swift and super nice the entire time! I loved it. Most servers don't understand how impatient kids get so this was a real gem. The food, delicious as always. Seven daughters moscato is my favorite wine here. Thank you for a stellar dinner!"
Suzie B.,"Glendale, CA",45,75,59,5.0,4/22/2015,Because their food is excellent. You can't possibly go wrong with anything you order. Quality food. And good service.
Christina K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",329,181,,1.0,7/4/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory in the Topanga Plaza Mall has the worst customer service. We waited so long to get our beverages, our meals came out before our drinks. The people at the table next to us complained to the manager about their meals being incorrect, and the people across from us just got up and left. I would not recommend coming here. The restaurant is not busy, yet the service is still slow and awful. The food is what you would expect from the Cheesecake Factory, but even in the end- it took so long to get our To go boxes, drink refills, and bill. Of course we complained to the manager too, just like everyone else-  I Would not recommend this place."
Adam G.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,4,3,2.0,2/5/2014,"Normally, I have exemplary experiences at the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not really sure why this particular visit was different, but here goes. We arrived and were told that the wait for a party of two would be around 45 minutes.  That was accurate.  Patience was rewarded by a long wait at the host stand-- though when the host seated us, she was friendly, full of smiles, and attentive.  Still a chance for remediation. Having been in the restaurant for nearly an hour already, standing and waiting for a table, we were primed for a drink.  The server arrived about 10 minutes after we were seated and asked what we'd like.  We ordered the drinks and an appetizer, and after another ten minutes they arrived. Water took another 10, give or take five minutes. This was shaping up to be a ""hurry up and wait"" experience.  Initially, I thought the server was in a fairly netural mood. We were given a generous TWENTY MINUTES to make our way through the three corn dogs and the drinks we ordered.  A busser came by after about 10 to remove the quickly-devoured appetizer, and the server helpfully stopped by to ask how they were-- but only that.  When she did return to take our meal order a while later, the tired drinks were almost finished and we were still every bit as ravenous as when we walked in the door.  The server herself looked more harassed then when we had arrived. The meals arrived after another decade, and I asked for a refill.  This refill came quite promptly, though my sister made the observation that her pasta appeared to have been sitting for a while due to the more solidified quality of her marinara sauce.  My meal of chicken marsala seemed fine to me.  Being hungry, we gave little thought to it, and began our meal-- nearing the two hour mark.   By the time we had finished eating, we had been at the restaurant for about two hours and were about ready to move on and continue our evening. The finished plates sat for awhile until the busser removed mine.  The server returned a short while later to ask if my sister wanted a box, which was promptly delivered.   The bill took ages. We sat.  And we waited.  And we waited more.  The server appeared- short, and seeming to be undergoing some sort of internal struggle- and left us to determine who owed what.  By the time the server reappeared to take the cards, we were beyond ready to go home, having missed the movie we were hoping to make.  Uncharacteristically, she reappeared within two minutes, and we were free to go. Truly unfortunate, really. All-told, we were at Cheesecake Factory for almost three hours.  Every other time I've been there-- and I mean EVERY-- the servers have been quick, courteous, timely, polite, and helpful... As befits a restaurant of its caliber.  I'm disappointed, and I can't help feeling that they're overwhelmed in some way- despite being at least as busy in their former location on Canoga.  I understand that servers are human and that they're every bit as capable of having a bad day as the rest of us.  However, the mood and the timeliness of the server reflects on the business which employs them, and my sister and I were as polite as we always are to people who interact with our food behind closed doors. I would recommend a field that doesn't involve customer liaison if unable to bear these things in mind."
Alice A.,"Granada Hills, CA",539,143,31,5.0,1/17/2012,"Wow! I am totally hooked on Cheesecake Factory! I came here during the weekend with half of my family for dinner.  We had all sorts of goodies from the avocado rolls to the strawberry cheesecake! Every dish that came to the table was simply fantastic! I ordered my favorite dish chicken n biscuits mmm delish!! The strawberry lemonade is soo tasty they even add salt on the rim of the glass. Our waiter for the night was cool and was on top of his game very attentive and made sure all of our requests were taken care of! Even the hostess that took us to our table was super chill :)  It was a super cool night we got seated outside it was nice tented, with the heaters on and the vibe with all the other folks around was good :)  If you park in the structure located behind the building make sure to take your ticket with you so it can get validated!! Would keep coming back to this location!"
Nanjee H.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,5,2,4.0,9/28/2014,"Nice outdoor patio. Free parking. Valet parking available. Connected to the mall. I  highly recommend the pan seared salmon. It comes with mushrooms spinach capers sauteed in garlic lemon sauce with Angel hair pasta. So yum, thank me later. If you want a delicious appetizer,  then order avocado egg rolls. Our server was slow, it took her about 15 min to come take our order. Maybe she was so busy so don't let that scare u.. enjoy the food"
Roxana M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,3,2,1.0,8/23/2015,I've came here a couple times and both weren't really good experiences had the Mac burger and my fries were rock hard second time had the Alfredo and pasta was way undercooked like who is cooking back there?
Mike C.,"San Diego, CA",863,1381,6483,3.0,8/15/2010,"Ahhhh...this place looks gooey and romantic. Oh wait...I came here Han style....solo that is. So it wasn't really romantic. I mean why make your lighting dark, have nice candles on the tables, serve a variety of wines and have your servers spiffed up when it is SUPER-loud everywhere!!! It's like going to Donovan's on crack!!! Not to bash Donovan's. But what is the angle here? You tell me Mr Factory. So that is my bizarre impression of this branch. Food - Couldn't really narrow it down from the hundreds of items on the menu, so I just went with the Cali cheesesteak and fries. I mean really...do you need to have a hundred or so food specials in a restaurant? Doesn't that take away from the quality and personalized attention? Just my thoughts here. Cheesesteak was bland, not seasoned. They just added onions, and green bell peppers to help enhance it, but a little salt and pepper would have been nice. Cherry cheesecake a la mode - Yum, at least there is some quality here. However, it was too rich and I couldn't finish it, but still pretty good. I totally forgot the cherries came straight from the can. Parking - Just park across the street where the old Circuit City used to be so you don't have to worry about valet service. It's good for you anyway to walk off that 1000 calorie cheesecake."
Gexcel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,13,,1.0,3/9/2015,I wad very dissapointed by my service here today. The food was good and everything seemed ok until we left the restaurant. I asked the hubby how much did he pay and realized we were over charged. A meal was added to our order. I went back to resolve the issue and both manager and waiter was non apologetic nor did they seem to care. I know that people make mistakes but this one seems fishy and when you make a mistake apologize and humble yourself. They said they reversed the charge but never gave me a receipt for the back charge because the manager says they don't do that. So after they make a mistake I am just suppose to say ok and leave. I left because there was no point in arguing.  I am just wondering if that meal was added to our bill by mistake then where is the meal? How come it never showed up to our table especially when other servers bring the food to your table??? There is something wrong here???  Last week a friend was telling me that his credit card number was stolen at cheesecake factory and normally I don't check my bill but now I will be doing it so diligently.especially after this experience and my friends experience. CheeseCake Factory read my yelp on CPK when they messed up on my order.. They went beyond expectation to keep my business.  The one star was for the food. It did live up to expectation. I will not be coming back to this location.
Chris C.,"Gilbert, AZ",568,41,,3.0,7/11/2015,Food was good but over cooked. Service was very friendly but slow. The overall restaurant was very clean and being in a mall it was allot of fun with the Terrace seating well decorated. I would go again just wouldn't order a burger.
Leo K.,"Valencia, CA",94,15,2,4.0,6/12/2015,"My love affair with the Harvest Chicken salad continues. I usually call in my order and take it to go, and Marcy R. in the bakery is always helpful and courteous.  When Marcy is behind the counter, it is a great thing!!"
Denise V.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",43,21,46,5.0,5/6/2014,We were seated immediately. The service was quick.  Food was out in no time. Our server was very attentive.  This is a great place to go to after doing some shopping. Lunch prices before 5pm
Tay M.,"Canoga Park, CA",12,50,14,3.0,7/4/2015,I love the cheesecake factory but today's service was horrible and the manager diregarded our needs I'll stick to another location from here on out
