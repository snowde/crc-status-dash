Melissa Heather K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,63,,1.0,9/5/2014,"I was waiting on something in the Topanga/Promenade Mall, and got hungry, so I went upstairs to the Cheesecake Factory. I had not been to the Cheesecake Factory is probably 15 or 20 years. The Chinese Chicken Salad was over loaded with rice noodles and the salad was drenched in the dressing so bad. The only pleasant part of my meal was the glasses of wine. Un believable- I will never go back in there."
Parsa M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",45,39,25,4.0,6/6/2015,A little packed most of the time bu it definitely worth the wait.  Nice waiters.  Nicely located at the mall and parking is plentiful.
Krystyne C.,"Winnetka, CA",179,7,7,2.0,11/27/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory - though this location is not one I would prefer to go to nor recommend.  When we went it in, the wait seemed pretty long. I asked the young man how long the wait would be & he said 5-10 minutes. We thought, ""sure, why not!"" & stuck around. 15 minutes had passed & we asked him how long the wait was & he said it would take another 5 minutes. Now, we aren't impatient or anything, but I mean, if you're going to estimate time during prime-time dinner hours, at least estimate it reasonably. He also had the audacity to say that only 5 minutes had passed. His manager even went up to him to tell him to inform customers that it would take 15-20 minutes to seat them, though he continued to say 5-10 minutes. Whatevs, not a big deal..but then. We we were seated outside - not outside outside, but outside ... as in the mall. I'm sorry, but we chose to eat at a restaurant & not the food court for a reason. Plus, our waiter was such a sassy frass. The food was great, or just the same as any other Cheesecake factory. I prefer the old location next to the Hilton Hotel, a real restaurant ambiance rather than food court experience, a person who can estimate waiting time correctly & a non-sassy frass waiter; but hey, maybe he just rubbed off on me."
Daniel L.,"Houston, TX",4999,1312,2725,3.0,11/14/2011,"Very standard Factory experiences. This one is right next to the Hilton. Small parking lot or go behind in the big parking garage in the rear. Get some cheesecake, leave the belt at home, enjoy. Not necessarily in that order but 'ya know - the entrees are marginal quality, but the cheesecake is amazeballs."
Valentina M.,"Northridge, CA",5,4,,2.0,2/10/2015,"I'm pretty disappointed with my recent experience here. I came in a large party and not only were we told we'd have to wait an approximate 2 hours to be seated, by the time we were actually seated, the surrounding area around us was fairly empty. With all those empty seats one would think that we could've been seated earlier. Our server was also not very welcoming and the whole vibe really felt as though our large party was not welcome. I've been coming here for a while now and have had little issue compared to the one I experienced the other night. It just seemed to lag the entire night with asking us for drinks and even taking our food orders. There were no bread refills and minimal drink refills. The whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth concerning this establishment. If I ever come back here, it will be with a small party and I will never bring a party larger than 4 here again.  What I learned from my experience here: large parties are not welcome! Too bad."
Todd N.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,583,496,4.0,1/5/2012,"I've been a life-long patron of this Cheesecake Factory because I've grown up in the SFV, and it's generally a great place to have a kind of formal place yet casual. I always tell myself i'm gonna try something new every time I come here but I end up just getting the Jambalya!  I can say that I've tried all their appetizers though.  My favorite is the Spinach Artichoke Dip.  This appetizer goes great with the complimentary bread (one's whole grain and the other french bread).  The portions are huge and can easily be shared between two people, if not, it makes a great lunch or dinner the next day.   Next, yes I have to say is the dessert! Don't bother with all their other stuff like lava cakes or apple pies because everything's all about, just guess.. THE CHEESECAKE!!! My all time favorite is between Tiramisu and Vanilla Bean -- these are just to die for.  I've had their other ones from the red velvet to caramel chocolate one but for me i'd rather get my usual.  All the cheesecake is delicious and mouthwatering, enough said."
Joel N.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",323,25,4,4.0,5/31/2015,Under new Management much better! Got my double big cheeseburger protein style and it was great! This ones back in the saddle again mr. Beef ups it!
dolores w.,"Hidden Hills, CA",0,30,8,5.0,1/23/2015,Best fried calamari.  This place gets busy so plan on waiting a bit but the food is worth it.
Mishari A.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,291,70,3.0,4/16/2014,I don't remember exactly my experience on that day but my friend wanted to eat his lunch here so I stayed  I've tried this place everywhere but I can't like it ! nothing special for me ....
Josh J.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,23,,5.0,6/28/2015,"Great place to receive a huge filling of food. Parking is simple, since it is literally a few feet away from the Westfield Topanga parking lot. This is the perfect place to bring a date, since you can buy one item on the menu and split it between you and your partner. No complaints."
Po C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,2.0,8/1/2015,"Probably one of the worst cheesecake factory restaurants in so cal. If u want good service, go somewhere else. Took the server over 15 mins to take our orders. She then disappeared the rest of the nite after the busser brought us the food. The next time we saw her was when she brought the check to the table. Avocado egg roll was soggy. Angel hair pasta was below their normal standards.  Jambalaya pasta was better.  Snickerbar cheesecake was what saved them from a one star rating. Won't be going bk anytime soon."
Dianne L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",20,5,,4.0,12/13/2015,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints!!!!  The menu is huge and there is definitely something for everyone. I was there recently and had the Asian salad for lunch. It's nice that they offer a lunch size portion , although it still seemed like two could share. The bread is fresh and it is never a problem to ask for more. The service is friendly and efficient   I always enjoy my meal and consider it a great value."
Bobby B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",247,290,92,1.0,10/20/2013,Worst experience at the new location..requested outside seating they sat us in the sun with not enough umbrellas. We asked for more umbrellas nothing could be done. We then asked to move inside after placing our order. We were told to follow a host to our new seats. She directed us to the front hostess bar and asked how she could help us?! We explained we were told to follow her. After confusion we were seated. Our drinks were not transferred until a manager came over and a waiter. Our food that was placed prior took 40 min to get to us. By then we were walking out. The new location is chaotic and unorganized.  Definitely not going back. Plenty of other restaurants in the area...
Alan P.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,82,,4.0,10/18/2015,"Pros: wonderful service, excellent food, attentive waiters, large portions, excellent steaks, yummy, cold beer on tap!! Cons: it's in a snobby, fake, roach infested mall (and I don't mean the roaches with 8 legs, I mean the ones with 2), mall valet is right in front of the restaurant, so you have long lines for the restaurant and the mall mixing up together, and watch out for the valet drivers, they will drive your car over 100mph in the parking lot!!"
Jodie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,45,2,4.0,6/25/2015,Things were very good but for the first time something odd happened. Our meals were brought out one at a time and mine was last...a sandwich and salad with no cooking. What's up with that? Food was good though.
Nicole N.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",8,35,,5.0,10/2/2013,"So... incase you didn't know they moved to the Topanga Promenade Mall.  No Big deal though, still can fit the same amount of people!   Anyways... Came here with the family and couldn't have landed on a nice server, ADAM!  He was great, was friendly and made suggestions when we had questions.   He was always filling our glasses before they were empty, brought us extra plates when he anticipated our need to share food.  Overall GREAT experience.  Definitely coming here again! Oh yah the food was great too!"
Eric R.,"Encino, CA",351,296,27,1.0,11/30/2015,I ordered the Louisiana pasta with NO mushrooms because I'm ALLERGIC. While I'm eating my dinner I see a BIG FAT MUSHROOM! The waitress was quick with apologies and took it into the kitchen. That's not a mistake that should happen at Cheesecake Factory! Also 2 different foods came to our table by mistake that were for neighboring tables. Again not a mistake that should be happening at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I wouldn't want my food or drink at another table before it made its way to my table. What if someone slipped something in it. I complained about all of this to the manager and although she was apologetic it didn't fix the problem that should never had happened there in the first place. I was under the impression that there is an extensive training that goes on there. The busboys bring out the food instead of the servers and they don't know who ordered what which is one big mistake. The other is that they don't take allergies seriously. Offering me free cheezcake which I declined is not the solution to the problem!
Esthie K.,"San Fernando, CA",158,26,113,4.0,2/1/2014,"I love cheesecake factory. I usually don't really like chain restaurants, but I love the ambiance and energy of this restaurant. I also am a big fan of their happy hour. I think it's from 3-6 pm. and the drinks are cheap! like $4 beer.  I also love their rye bread with butter before our meals come. I try not to eat too much so I don't get full before our meal comes. But I really like the way we can all share the meals together. I ordered the lunch special- Fettucine Alfredo with Sun Dried Tomatoes. It was really rich and decadent. And their small plates appetizers of the flatbreads are really good."
Ryan S.,"Chatsworth, CA",7,125,18,3.0,3/25/2014,"Back in the day I loved CCF.  Consistently a 4 star -  I still enjoy it , but don't love the new location.  (previous place on Canoga was better and bigger) I do come here from time to time to pickup a slice of cheesecake to go. This location I would rate 3 .  (most locations a 4)"
Samira B.,"Tarzana, CA",10,22,3,3.0,11/23/2014,"So I'm a HUGE fan of Cheesecake Factory, have been since my early teens.  However, ever since it moved to a new location in Woodland Hills I fell like it's changed. Past few times I have gone there I've always had to wait forever for someone to get our drink orders or even just to check on us and all.  This last time that we all went, our server was fantastic. Great energy made the best of the situation.   However the kitchen not once but twice screwed up my order! How hard is it to not put mushrooms in my pasta!? I mean I'm allergic you know that's why I said no mushrooms! We heard our waiter yell at them and when they brought out the second time more or less I had lost my appetite and boxed my food to take home.  Our waiter said that the manager was going to come by and make sure that we were ok and to apologize for the kitchen screw up.  Well no manager ever came by and they didn't even offer us a dessert nothing.  Well we ordered our dessert and paid our bill and went on our way.  I came to eat my food at home so when I reheated it I took a bite and my pasta tasted like it still had mushrooms in it!!! So I looked through and sure be it there was mushrooms in it!! I started getting rashes and hives for hours. I was so mad!! Called cheesecake and spoke to a manager told him what happened. Informed him that I was going to write a review as well because they should be more careful.   He was kind and polite he apologized for what I had to go through and as a kind gesture he sent me a $25 gift card for next time.  I really wish he could have given me the name of the manager that was working the night before.   I love cheesecake factory so much that I will give this location one last try.  If they fail me again Sherman Oaks will become my favorite location."
