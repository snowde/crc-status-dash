D-anne X.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,6,4,2.0,12/29/2013,"This particular Cheesecake has standard quality food. However, every time I dine here I receive filthy silverware. It is completely unacceptable. It ruins the experience for me. If they change their dishwasher, I would give this restaurant three stars for a standard dining experience."
Chewbacca J.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",4,57,4,5.0,12/17/2013,"We just went to the new Cheesecake Factory for lunch and I must say, I was impressed.   They recently moved from their location on Canoga to the Topanga Mall.  The place is brand new, so it looks really nice!   The food, excellent.  Always!  I don't think I've ever had anything that I did not like.  Today in particular, I had the Cajun Chicken Pasta, and it was amazing.  I almost licked the plate clean! The service was also fantastic.  Today, our server, Josh, was about as good as it gets.  He checked on us regularly, always had a smile on his face, and my ice tea never even got close to the bottom of the glass (and I drink a lot of ice tea).  On a side not, they have the best passion/tropical ice tea anywhere. Prices are reasonable.  Plates range from $10 to $20 per person.  Our lunch was about $30 for the two of us (thanks boss for picking up the tab). Would I go back?  Definitely.  Would I recommend this place?  Yes.  This place is great for lunch, for parties, for dinner, for dates, for just about any occasion."
Mark W.,"ENCINO, CA",0,17,1,5.0,10/5/2013,"I give the Cheesecake Factory in Woodland Hills a solid 5 Star because it delivers, consistently, exactly what it advertises.  This can't be said of all other CF's that I have eaten (multiple times) in and quality/service/consistency do change across the different locations. Went that last week in September as my youngest daughter (8) picked this place to hold our family dinner for her birthday.  She always gets the Pasta Da Vinci with grilled chicken and the staff, as always, offer up a little song and a free chocolate a cream dessert for the birthday girl. I had the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampy combo - served with mashed potatoe and if you are a garlic lover, the shrimp in the garlic lemon sauce can not be beat. The Tex Mex egg rolls are a ""must have""  and so are the Buffalo Blasts - order extra ranch. There is always plenty of bread and butter, and we have never had any complaints with the wait staff or the wait times.  The place gets busy, if you are not prepared to wait for a table, go out of rush hour, it is simple as that. Also, we like the outside patio in at this location. I read someone who gives the just CF 3 stars because it is an ""Upscale Denny's"" and the that they, the reviewer believes they ""have a better understanding of good food"".   This person is missing the point, in my opinion.  If the CF was being compared to a Michelin starred restaurant (maybe $200 a head without drinks) then, yes, 3 stars would be applicable - but who in their right mind goes to the CF for a fine dining experience?  No one - it is loud, busy, full of kids and people in shorts and flip flops and serves big portions of fattening food - washed down with copious amounts of soda/beer/fruity cocktails. What they server and how they serve it is exactly what their patrons what from that particular dining experience - and that is worth of 5 Stars. Keep it up Cheesecake Factory in Woodland Hills - we will be back soon."
Brian T.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,80,9,4.0,12/16/2013,I don't know what's the deal with Cheesecake Factory but they are always packed and food qualities are very consistent from restaurant to restaurant so kudos to them! This is a pretty new Cheesecake Factory so it's very clean looking and benches look very new. Unlimited breads are always so addicting! They also have the $5 Monday to Friday happy hour and it's a pretty good selection of foods. I'll have to write more about the review but I'm just impress with the location. It's right outside the mall and seems like it will do pretty well.
Alissa D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",7,14,6,5.0,3/7/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory, the wait can be pretty long on the weekends but that's normal. I like this location better since I live closer and its in plain view (the one near the Hilton made me forget it was even there) The parking can be a drag after 5 and you might circle a couple times before you find something. If its ever more than a 20 minute wait i just leave and go somewhere else, but that's with any restaurant I go to (its just a meal I can always go another day).   The food is always good. I love there herb crusted salmon salad (I ask for the salmon hot), miso salmon, clam chowder and jambalaya. The pumpkin cheesecake is my favorite when its in season or just the plain one. There pork chops are okay, I like them at other restaurants more. The service its good and they're always nice."
Barbara M.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,38,,2.0,1/2/2014,"Our beloved Cheesecake Factory recently moved from it's ""forever"" home on Canoga Avenue in Woodland Hills to it's new home at Topanga Mall in Canoga Park.  Although the new venue is more convenient to patrons and has more exposure I'm not sure they did themselves a favor.  The atmosphere is warm and exciting, as was the previous location.  The bar area seems to be the biggest hit.  It's not as large as the Canoga venue and neither is the restaurant.  The noise level is very high but, so was Canoga.  That said, we were there during the holidays and the joint was jumpin. Our experience was less than exciting. We waited over an hour, but that was OK.  The host text us on our cell phone when our table was ready and we were free to go about our day in the mall.  We are absolute peppermint bark junkies and when we read the sign on the entrance door, ""Peppermint Bark Cheesecake Is Back"", we were in for the take.   We are now seated and ordered.  Marco, our waiter was wonderful.  The food was not.  I had Renee's special lunch which is a cup of soup (cold), chicken salad sandwich (full of bones) and a salad, which was the best on the plate.  When we inquired about the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake, Marco, our waiter, laughed and said it had been off the menu over a week.  We were heart fallen. It was the reason we decided to have lunch here and wait over an hour, anticipating the cheesecake.   Jodie, one of the managers, was a prince.  He removed my entree from the bill and apologized for the lack of the peppermint cheesecake and gave us a complimentary cheesecake which was, of course, wonderful.  The service, even though they were ""slammed"" was better than expected.  We applaud the managers and wait staff for their attentiveness.  The food, however, may take some time."
Carla A.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",667,118,132,3.0,2/6/2014,"I like how they have cute little outdoor seating at their new location. They're now at the Topanga Mall. BUT, its just that... LITTLE. There's virtually no room and if you're there on a sunny day, people like to take the umbrellas your using and give them to someone else without notice. It's happened twice to me unfortunately. The parking is a lot more difficult too since they've moved to the mall. I believe they do still offer valet, but I didn't see anyone at the time I pulled up. I'll try this location again and see how that goes."
Ian C.,"Studio City, CA",0,2,7,5.0,3/14/2016,"i like Cheesecake Factory, foods great and if it isnt up to par they'll replace it or take it off your bill. no worries"
Ada L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1955,596,998,3.0,8/16/2011,"I used to love going to The Cheesecake Factory when I lived in NJ, but with all the great restaurants out here I'm not as excited about it anymore. But I had a gift card so I decided to go to this particular restaurant one day. Another reason I don't like going to Cheesecake Factory as much I used to is because on our table sat the booklet with all the nutritional information. I always knew it was high-calorie stuff, but seeing the actual numbers really depresses me. At the same time, I'm glad I can know the nutritional values because that led me to make a ""smarter"" choice. I ordered the Simply Grilled Salmon Lunch Special and my bf got the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak. We opted to sit out on dessert after looking at the nutritional values. Both the salmon and steak tasted pretty good, although the salmon wasn't nice and flaky enough. I liked the side salad that came with my salmon. Overall, this place wasn't bad. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the food was decent."
Nedim S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,13,,5.0,7/13/2015,Always great service and great atmosphere. Service is fast as always...the waiters are always friendly and quick on the refills. Just be warned it gets crazy busy on the weekends!!
Gina J.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,358,53,4.0,1/4/2014,"Same ol' Cheesecake Factory, just at the mall. Food is good, service is great."
Marmar M.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",36,127,40,3.0,2/23/2015,Really dont love this location given that it's attached to a mall. Always a really long wait and very dim lighting.  I go because I like some of their skinnylicious options.  You could also indulge in their cheesecakes if you're not so health conscious and go for a stroll in the mall afterwards.
Tanya G.,"West Hills, CA",2,28,3,1.0,9/25/2015,Do not sit outside on the patio unless u want roaches on your table and food! The manager came and was extreme rude as well saying how they can't control the outside! I've been to plenty other restaurants and none of them had roaches crawling on or around the table!
Jason J.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",78,29,3,5.0,10/8/2013,"YES!!! Brand new location. Moved from Canoga Ave to Westfield Topanga Mall. Just a short distance from the old location, but 100% improvement on location and improved parking.  Maintains the high standards that I associate with Cheesecake Factory and the desserts aren't bad either!  Lol."
Jeff G.,"Culver City, CA",19,48,73,5.0,8/20/2013,"Can't beat their salmon lunch special. Best salmon for miles and at this price nothing compares. And of course, the cheesecake is top notch. Staff is also very friendly. I heard rumor that this location is moving to the mall."
Sandy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,170,,3.0,2/18/2015,"It's a chain restaurant in an upscale shopping mall. Had to send the silverware back twice, didn't look too clean. Shared the Ceasar salad and chicken Marsala with a coworker. Salad was fine, chicken Marsala dish was a bit bland, although the portions are very generous. Snicker doodle cheesecake was well worth the calories. I'm thinking appetizers (avocado egg rolls are very yummy), and dessert. They don't take reservations, so plan accordingly."
Pamela B.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",5,34,,5.0,4/9/2015,"I went here for dinner  with coworkers. Our waiter , Stephanie , was terrific . The food was delicious and service was fast . Two thumbs up !"
Sherry M.,"Pasadena, CA",32,117,10,4.0,12/27/2013,"I really loved the old location next to the Hilton, and the fact that this Cheesecake is now at the mall means two things, 1) parking is even more of a headache 2) the wait is much longer, and the restaurant is smaller and more crowded.  Aside from that, the new location is beautiful, very modern, very classy, very new. Our server was Steven and he was fantastic, extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He suggested a few items for us, and even hung around to chat with us for a little, he was extremely welcoming. My friend and I shared the spinach and artichoke dip and the bbq chicken salad, and against his better judgement my friend ordered the 'mac and cheese glamburger' which he surprisingly enjoyed.  Everything was nice except for some not very friendly hostesses at the front, I think it's seriously important to have friendly and welcoming greeters, they are the first impression you get of a restaurant, and if I didn't know any better, I would have judged this place poorly based on a few teenage girls attitudes."
Ray P.,"Dover, DE",75,101,107,4.0,6/30/2013,Stayed at the Hilton next door and saw this place outside my window. The wife called ahead and picked it up so I couldn't tell you how it looks inside.  I had the Kobe burger and fries. It was damn good.  She had the spaghetti and she enjoyed it.
David M.,"Westminster, CO",0,5,,5.0,11/23/2014,Love this location. Just don't get seated on the far end adjacent to the mall. Different experience. Nice setting. Love the Club sandwiches here. No HAM as it should be. What kind of club has ham?
