Camila D.,"Vancouver, Canada",91,85,28,4.0,12/11/2013,"We went to this Cheesecake factory for the first time last weekend and we were very happy with our service and food. Our server was always around, our food was delayed so he offered us a complimentary loaded potato soup which was amazing!  We ordered fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer, which next to the cheesecakes are the best thing there in my opinion. For our main course we ordered from the Skinnylicious menu, the soft tacos, which were a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the meal and the flatbread which was very good though small. For dessert we had the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which was AMAZING! Overall I give it 4 stars only because the wait on our food was long, but I loved our service and the food was very good overall. Will be back!"
Marci S.,"Signal Hill, CA",159,60,61,5.0,10/31/2014,love their food.. healthy choices as well as not so healthy.. (i.e the pumpkin pecan cheesecake I just ate).  Atmosphere is romantic w good music playing in the background.
Kristin A.,"Irvine, CA",26,356,159,4.0,11/2/2013,"The short of it: - new location at Westfield Topanga  - service is good - lots of variety - known for their long list of cheesecakes - Favs: Chicken madeira  The long of it: This Cheesecake Factory is now at the old CPK location. They closed their other location down the street which was a good move since they will get lots of mall customers and the parking is easier here. Came here on a Saturday at noon and we were seated promptly. Our server was attentive and the food came out quickly. I usually get the chicken madeira but decided to pick one of the lunch specials (they are smaller and cheaper than the regular version). I had the chicken piccata, which was very tasty. I really like the seating options at this location, there's outdoor seating, indoor seating and what I like to call indoor ""outdoor"" seating which is essentially seating that is outside the main restaurant and out in the mall area. Nice if you don't want to be inside but don't want to bother with the outdoor weather."
Tracy S.,"Calabasas, CA",122,22,4,5.0,12/31/2013,"I cannot say enough great things about this place! The food is delicious (of course) and everyone I interacted with was super friendly and attentive... I had a wonderful dining experience. I showed up after a long day of shopping to grab a quick bite by myself (don't judge). The place was really busy but I was seated right away, shown to my table on the patio by a friendly gentleman, and was greeted by my server almost immediately. One of the servers noticed the table was a little wobbly so she came over with a rolled up napkin to place under the legs making it more stable. Thanks! The patio was a little chilly but somebody brought an extra heater out - problem solved.  I ordered the fried mac and cheese (so amazing, I get it almost every time). Unfortunately it was cold on the inside, almost as if it had come out of the fridge and wasn't cooked all the way through. I wouldn't have minded saving it for later but fried mac and cheese isn't really something you can reheat at home (and I was already satisfied by the flatbread I had orderd - also amazing), so I asked my server to kindly take it back. I was surprised that the manager came over to personally apologize for the cold food. He was so friendly and offered - no, insisted - to not only take care of the macaroni, but to send me home with a piece of cheesecake. They really went out of their way to fix a mistake and make my day! By the way, if you haven't had the tuxedo cheesecake yet then you're missing out. Even if you don't like cheesecake, you will devour this delicious piece of dessert. Thank you, management and staff, for a lovely experience - despite the cold food :) I will definitely be returning soon!"
Robert D.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,43,,2.0,2/24/2013,"The waiter, macaroni and cheese balls, chicken madeira, and green ice tea get the stars, all were excellent, even on  a busy night the waiter still passed the ice tea test, cup wasn't empty for more than a couple seconds.  BUT........ We were told 1/2 hour wait and waited an hour, I don't mind waiting, I do mind inaccurate estimates,unless of course they tell me a half hour and its only 15 min.  I witnessed the manager reprimanding an employee about a $10 shortage, in front of a room full of customers, I guess the guy doesn't know how loud his voice is. (Because its been tested, my hearing is pretty bad)  When we were finally seated, we had to wait, blocking a busy aisle, for them to finish cleaning the table.  The kids and I sat with the last guys chunks of bread at our feet, but I guess it was fine as long as you didn't look down."
Tahura B.,"Los Angeles, CA",402,121,,5.0,2/27/2013,"This place is just absolutely fabulous! Love the service every time I go there and I go there a lot for birthday occasions and all! Great food and atmosphere! Waiting for a table is a bit of a drag but everything else makes up for it.  I find it a bit ironic that I rarely order cheesecake at the cheesecake factory. Probably because by the end of my meals, I am just stuffed!  For Appetizers, I HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Samosas! So freaking delicious! Trust!"
Mr. C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,34,3,1.0,3/19/2015,"Weak food at best. Ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was horrible. Grease soaked bread and hardly any chicken salad.  Showed the manager and he didn't seem to see my complaint. Basically half the sandwich had NO chicken. He first said its pre-mixed, then he said it's weighed out. I had to slowly explain to him that it's a half sandwich and not a full. My friend ordered the same on different bread and the results were the same. Could of had a better one at Starbucks. Sad, but true. It's not the same as the ol days. I won't go back again. Standards are not what they once were."
Chela M.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,59,6,2.0,11/22/2013,"Went in and ordered calamari, avocado egg rolls, stuffed mushrooms, and spinach & cheese dip. The spinach dip was great and the portion was enough for at least 6 people as an appetizer.  Calamari and the tarter sauce was also good. I would've liked a but more crispy but was still good.  Now, the stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls were definitely not worth it. I have been to other locations as well as tried different chains version and this Topanga location failed. The avocado rolls were soggy and the avocado was quickly turning brown. Definitely much better at claim jumpers. The stuffed mushrooms were okay at best but bjs has a better version."
Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",832,655,374,3.0,7/19/2015,"I'm not a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory in general. I think their menu options are overpriced and filled with empty calories. I came here with friends to grab dinner. I'd say the highlight of the dinner was the bread they bring to the table. That bread is so delicious, especially smeared with butter. I had ordered some chicken quesadilla dish which I found to be overly greasy. My pineapple mule was served in a tall glass instead of the traditional copper mug with tin lining. It was also overly sweet and seemed watered down. The service was good, our waiter was attentive but he was pushing the desserts way too hard. I don't know if I've ever had their cheesecake to be honest because I grew up in a very health-conscious family and since I suffer from my own health problems, I rarely indulge, but you gotta admit that their cheesecake flavors are impressive. Parking is plentiful but since this is a mall, you might run out of options that are closer to the location."
Mariza G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,2,5.0,10/8/2015,I was there today and by far the best experience ever at any Cheesecake Factory thanks to a waitress who took control of our table which was not even her table. Sat down waited for a long time without our waitress coming to acknowledge us. A waitress by the name of Maria asked if we had been assisted we told her no and she was on it. Even though we were not her table she took care of us. Maria is a great asset to this restaurant.
Kristen B.,"WINNETKA, CA",7,24,6,1.0,2/8/2015,"Came here to celebrate a birthday with coworkers we called ahead to set a time to arrive and was told 8pm for our party of 15. On arrival we spoke to the manager on duty who then informs us that our party wouldn't be seated until 10:30 pm a half our before they close? So we all agreed to wait in the hopes that we would be seated earlier mind you most of our party showed up 20 minutes early. While waiting for a table the restaurant was readily able to seat multiple parties of 7 and 6 and we found it very embarrassing that patrons of this place made comments like ""OMG they are still waiting? "" it's concerning that management felt it was appropriate to make a large party that showed up on time wait more than an hour to be seated, none the less we will think twice before planning another visit to the Cheesecake Factory."
Jessica L.,"Palmdale, CA",3,46,15,5.0,12/8/2014,"This was our first time at this location.  The service was outstanding and the food just topping the service.  They have such a wide variety to choose from that you're going to find a new favorite dish. I would suggest the Jumbalaya. It has just the right amount of spice. Very delicious!  We ordered the peppermint bark cheesecake to go. Definitely a must if you like peppermint. Will definitely be going back again. Also a plus, they have valet parking."
Sara M.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,161,87,4.0,10/15/2013,New location at Topanga mall. The outdoor patio doesn't look nearly as big as the old location. They also have seating out in the mall area. Parking is definitely better. I think everyone will find that is location is convenient.
Everett R.,"Los Angeles, CA",397,10,1,4.0,2/16/2015,"Good service. Recommended spot . ordered the chicken fettuccine and came out good just needed a little more chicken in it , the wait to be seated was not that long either . satisfied customer."
Reza S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",44,210,3,5.0,6/27/2013,Great place with good huge salads if you want to be on diet and also great service but  this branch is better than Grove and Marina del Ray  since this is local for more local people and those  traps more tourist one time deal only So I guess everything is better than those here in  woodland hills
Andrew S.,"Huntington Park, CA",2,12,9,3.0,11/11/2013,"New location is nice I just wish they can make there waiting area a bit bigger when the crowd gets big ppl are pretty much shoulder to shoulder, I'm not a big fan on the whole we will text you when your table is ready I heard some ppl complaing about it maybe going back to the pagers works best, I can't say nothing bad about there food, there food is always good my girlfriend and I both had the ""Factory Famous Meatloaf"" it was my first time trying it and will be getting it again (I usally get pasta), our server was great, I just didn't like how some ppl would leave the waiting area to go find there own table and self seat them selfs and the servers will catch them in the act but I guess since they go there a lot its ok smh, I guess that's why waits are so long I'm going to give this place 3 stars not because of the food but for the service I think this location needs to get it togethere."
Ilya B.,"Canoga Park, CA",33,30,48,5.0,11/11/2013,"I've visited my first CKF a few years ago and now I follow it religiously, like in-n-out. It's THE BEST restaurant in terms of value and quality. I wish more restaurants would follow the CKF example, the world would have been a much tastier place :) ilu CKF"
Joy R.,"Simi Valley, CA",104,180,169,4.0,7/10/2013,"I love their Skinnylicious menu items!! My favorite is the Beet, goat cheese and candied pecans with arugula, and shrimp spring rolls!"
Sara Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",164,41,,5.0,1/22/2016,Ernetta is the best! I came here with my mom and sister to have a birthday lunch and she was an absolute  pleasure. I love this place and she just made our experience!
Pam A.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,50,,3.0,7/28/2014,"I ave been to cheesecake factories many many times.  I think their prices are ok and portions are big but I think their menu is outdated and the quality of the food is not as good as it used to be.  The service is ok and the servers are nice though.  Its really crowded on saturday nights and I wouldn't dream of going since the wait would be too long. All in all, the experience is ok. Nothing to write home about. The decor is nice but sometimes I feel like I am just a number. Too corporate.  At the desk, they barely call out your name. It would be nice if they extended a more personal service.Also, in the day and age that everyone is starting to offer healthy food, they should change their menu accordingly."
