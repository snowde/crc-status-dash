Chris K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",5,25,46,5.0,12/21/2012,"I love cheesecake factory!! They are always on point and never fuck up! I was there last night and eery thing was bomb!! Waiters are always SUPER nice, esp at the Woodland hills location.  I love the tuns of fun burger and their bbq chicken salad!! Thank you Cheesecake Factory Chris K."
Frankie M.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,155,,4.0,12/23/2014,Great atmosphere. Not too long of a wait. Waiter was great and very helpful. Food and drinks were good and of course the cheesecake was incredible. I don't recommend sitting in the outside annex. It's like you're in the mall.
Laarnii D.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/16/2016,"Bad customer service tonight. Just plainly disappointed that I got cream of chicken soup instead of the clam chowder that I ordered on the phone. The guys ask me what size of clam chowder I asked for a bowl. I got home and my husband was asking why theres no clams in the clam chowder. I called this location to inform and spoke to the manager steven and he said they dont have clam chowder today and that they have cream of chicken. I said I ordered clam chowder and whoever took the order did not say there is no clam chowder today. Steven repetead to me that they dont have clam chowder today! Wow what a manager. He did not offer any resolution right away for this mistake and he asked what do I want. I told him my kids are now eating and I cannot leave so maybe he can just put a clam chowder credit for me and Ill get it anytime. He said no I cant do it any other day only today because he is not there next Friday. Wow again! I am just very disappointed with the way this manager handles this very easy situation. He asked me what I want instead of offering a resolution, I dont really want to ask for anything else besides what I ordered and plus I dont want to go back. TodAy is a long day of swim competition and at 7pm this is our lunch (I ordered Hook Burgers for the kids), so really this manager's work ethic is very unprofessional.  If he said Im sorry for the misunderstanding let me credit you back the soup charge I would have been ok. But he kept on saying what do I want instead, I finally said just give me a salad (which I just ate salad last 2 nights thats why today I opted for soup). What an inconvenience!!!Now I have to go back to the store and get my salad instead of me resting already with my kids from a long day of activity.  I like the food no doubt but manager's ability to handle customer's is way below standards for a restaurant like cheesecake factory."
Bryan T.,"Chatsworth, CA",65,56,83,5.0,12/13/2012,"Before Yelp, my girl and I would go to chessecake factory every monthly anniversary. I should have taken the girl here during our first day. However, I was only 19-years-old. Not one dish in cheesecake factory will disappoint. Waiter/waitress makes frequent visits to ensure that the eating experience is well worth the time, trip, and money. Prices range from $10-20 but the dishes are large! One dish can feed two people. The menu labels the calories, which is great for people who are dieting. Their cheesecake is a bit pricey but well worth the price. My favorite would be the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. The environment is crowded but elegant. I will always come back to this place. My monthly tradition will continue until I die."
Love B.,"Chatsworth, CA",377,109,105,3.0,7/5/2013,"It takes a certain kind of a person to be a hostess and the gentleman they had as a hostess was horrible to say the least. I don't understand a brand as strong as Cheesecake to not pay attention to details such as this since it's the first experience a customer will have with the restaurants. However, it was made up by our waiter, Matty. I highly suggest you request him the next time you're there.  There's something different about the service you get from people from NY. Hope the management team sees this and recognizes his efforts. He made an effort to check on us a number of times and all three of us left very impressed and pleased with him.  I usually order their Chicken Madera or Piccata which you can't go wrong with.  I took Matty's recommendation of Pasta Da Vinci and it was simply amazing.  If it wasn't for Matty, this place would've gotten a 2 star from me today."
Pamlyn C.,"Pacoima, CA",3,105,,3.0,1/11/2015,"I went for the breakfast, which they only serve on Sundays.  I ordered the brunch combo, which consists of 2 bacon strips, eggs, 2 pancakes.  You can substitute pancakes with a waffle, but they charge $1. Everything was good, but I didn't like the syrup.  Next time I will just ask for regular maple syrup.   I went around 11:30am and it was only a 5 minute wait.  Waiter service was slow. I know our waiter was trying to do the best that he could, but with so many customers it was very difficult.  It took us 5 minutes to recieve our check and over 10 minutes to get the change.  Next time I will bring smaller bills- get the check- pay- leave it on the table and leave!"
Sam H.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,17,,3.0,8/7/2014,"Got the chicken Madeira, was not impress at all. The mashed potato was lumpy and salty and the chicken lacked flavor. Could have cooked up a better meal at home. The only reason I am giving them a three is because the service was friendly and prompt."
Andrew M.,"Berkeley, CA",16,90,,4.0,11/24/2012,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, if you've been to one you've been to all of them. The amazing thing is the consistency. Literally hundreds of dishes on the menu, granted a lot of them use the same ingredients, but it's surprising that one kitchen can turn all of this out so efficiently and consistently.  Also amazing? Not only that the kitchen can turn out hundreds of different dishes a night, but that most of them can actually be good. In a way The Cheesecake Factory is kind of the Styx or Abba of the culinary world. Nobody wants to pay them much respect but everyone still secretly likes them. Where else can you go for this kind of cheesy opulence and still get a consistently well cooked piece of salmon? Its the culinary version of a casino in Vegas, proud of how shallow it is, admitting that it's not really trying for any kind of authenticity in anything it does, but cranking out a polished simulacrum of the culture that it's trying to ape. Could I ever confuse the Venetian in Vegas for the canals of Venice? Never in a million years, but it has its own thing going on and that has value in its own right. Huge portions, larger than any human should be allowed to eat are served with flagrant disregard for calorie counts or actual nutritive value. Due to Los Angeles law, a separate sheet with calorie counts is brought out with your menu, but if you're coming here you really shouldn't even think about counting calories. Really, even if you do care about calories, you shouldn't look at this sheet, because it's just going to cause guilt and shame afterwards. Yes, your entree is going to be between 2100 and 3100 calories, so skip the appetizer. Really, I'd be shocked if you can have a couple of drinks, an entree and a dessert here and get out for under 4k calories.  The Skinnilicious menu doesn't have anything you'd actually want to eat on it so don't even look at it.  Really, The Cheesecake Factory straddles that line of ""I'm totally only enjoying this ironically"" and ""I'm actually totally enjoying this"" so well that it's best not to analyze it, and besides, does it actually matter? Either way you're having a good time. Most of the cheesecakes are too sweet though."
Princess R.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",145,28,,3.0,11/12/2014,Too busy. Waiters take forever. I haven't been back. Been about a year now. 3 stars only because the food is still good!
Queen B R.,"Tarzana, CA",223,13,,5.0,3/24/2014,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory. My boyfriend and I come here often. This time, however was the best it has been in awhile!  Their new system of sending a text to my phone to let me know our table is ready is quite efficient, mainly because this location is attached to a mall. We able to peruse some stores while we waited, instead of standing around in their lobby (which is quite small) or trying to shark a table in the bar.  We were seated right at our quoted time of forty minutes, not bad for a Friday night. The host who took my name was also the one to seat us and it's always nice when they are smiley and engaging. Props to that young man.  Our experience only got better when our waitress came over. She was nice, cool, and great at her job. As a server myself, I could tell she had her own perfect style of serving. I really hope I remember her name right....Darlene? My bad, I did have a couple glasses of wine. She was tall and brunette with her hair in a neat little bun. When we go back I will try to request her.  We split the Crispy Chicken Costoletta (my favorite) and a couple appetizers. I love their cheese wedges and my boyfriend inhaled the samosas.  We sadly never have room for dessert. This was quite a satisfying experience and we both left grossly full. :)"
Ana C.,"Agoura Hills, CA",10,2,,3.0,12/20/2012,Be aware that now they charge for soda water $2.95!!!! As if you would drink a soda. Pay attention when you got the bill.  Restaurant overall is noisy. Last time i wen with friends ordered from skinny menu.  Lettuce wraps asian style ... please DO NOT waste your money and order something else.  The wrap was literally ONE saggy leaf with so much sauce my hands were dripping 'till my elbows SOOOO MESSY!!!!
Anna J.,"Chatsworth, CA",571,523,1137,3.0,10/27/2012,"Can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory! Beware of large portions! We always eat a cheesecake to share there and always bring some home for later. I always get the Avocado Eggrolls to start with. I must say, they have down sized on the portions on this. I now have to fight my family for it! The 2nd one is the Calamari which is ok. But my favorite main dish here is the Luau Salad. My 2nd favorite is the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp! Our favorite cheesecake is the Banana & the Snickers cheesecake! I recently tried the Pumpkin Cheesecake and it was up there for me!  At this location, restaurant is clean but staff can be snooty & fake!"
Zoey P.,"Lakewood, CO",123,10,,5.0,1/1/2015,"Delicious dinner I had the pleasure of enjoying with a friend! Friendly service, short wait and orgasmic cheesecake!"
Liz S.,"Burbank, CA",8,13,,5.0,1/23/2016,This is my favorite restaurant! I loved their food! My favorite meal is the jambalaya. I love the spiciness. They have amazing service and they work fast to please their customers! Love Love Love!!
Kelly K.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,5,,2.0,2/3/2015,"If you're looking for a mediocre chain restaurant with nothing to experience, then look no further. Wish I had more positive things to say about this place. Pretty lame food, even WORSE choices"
Bjae B.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,14,31,1.0,7/11/2014,"This location has not gotten it together..took an hour to get my food(which was not that complicated) & the waiter was kinda rude & was not really around.. If u get a waiter  that looks like MC Search,then u might have to search for your food..it will b a while. Luckily the manager was amazing but still #worstcheesecakefactoryever"
Ali T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",296,192,86,4.0,4/24/2014,this is relatively new location that moved here from canoga this location is pretty small compared to other cheesecake factories but they seem to manage they always have line so be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes they dont have those vibrating things anymore (Big +) they take your number and they text you when they're ready for you one of the requirements of staff seems to be that you have to be Hot to get hired because there's a lot of eye candy waitresses in here food unfortunately is sometimes hit and miss but most of the times its pretty good steak dian - awesome (if they dont over cook it) 4/5 Americana Cheeseburger - very tasty 5/5 Kobe burger - very juicy 5/5 avacado eggrolls - To Die For 10/5 (yes its that good0 tex mix eggroll - pretty good 4/5 ahi tuna - not bad 3/5 crusted chicken romano - really nice  (sometimes a bit over souced) 4/5 filet minion - Amazing (just a bit small) 5/5 Tuxido cheese cake - my Fav 10/5 carmal pecan cheese cake - very tasty but very sweet after 2-3 bits u cant continue 3/5 white chocolate cheese cake - not too bad 3.5/5
Phillip Paul B.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,15,1,4.0,3/27/2015,"Ordered the Orange Chicken. The veggies were crisp and delicious, the chicken crispy tender and tangy but the rice was slightly dry. Our waitress was efficient and cordial and the white chocolate blueberry cheesecake as tremendous."
Rich K.,"WEST HILLS, CA",73,8,1,1.0,2/1/2016,"I was disappointed with my first experience at Cheesecake Factory today. First off the place was annoyingly jam packed. It wasn't that good people, t felt like a ride at Disneyland, wait in a line to check in then when your name is called via text message wait in another line to be seated. Basically hurry up and wait. Then I ask for a up of water for my son and as he is drinking it notices the cup is dirty with some ort of food stuck in the inside of his cup. Gross, I bring it to the attention of the waitress who apologizes and beings another water. I expressed my concern to her that it was my first time at this restaurant and now I am unsettled regarding the rest of my order. To her credit she told the manager who also came over to my table and apologized, but here is the kicker...He didn't offer me even a 10% discount, piece of free cheesecake...nothing. It seemed very disengenous and matter of fact. Heck when McDonalds messes up they give you a free hash brown or fries. I've had an order go wrong at Olive Garden once and they offered me a free desert. Well this cup incident was gross. Needless to say no tip left and won't be returning where my business is not appreciated enough to make good on a failure."
Avedis M.,"Glendale, CA",66,6,2,1.0,1/7/2016,"Came to Cheesecake Factory with my sister for a late night dinner. We were helped by a young gentlemen I believe name was Peter or Patrick. He was a very nice guy. He always checked in with us and took our orders. Our fried macaroni balls were brought out first then Here is where things got REALLY BAD. A lady walked to our table with the Chinese chicken salad and my Renees sandwich then she turned around and went to the register while carrying the food and checked something on the computer. She then brought the food to our table and first mistake was the Renees sandwich. I had order with a side of soup and they brought it with salad instead. Then we asked for an extra plate so she went to grab a plate for us she came back as she was handing it to us she said ""oh this plate is dirty let me grab another one instead"". I appreciate that she paid attention and went to get a clean plate, but even then the plate shouldn't be dirty or at least check before you bring it out. Then the worst happened. As we were eating my sister spit her food out to discover a chewed gum in her salad. She was chewing someone else's GUM that was in our salad. I felt sick to my stomach. We had barely eaten anything from our order. Manager came apologized and said we wouldn't have to pay. But that was honestly not the point. That is just plain DISGUSTING! I will NEVER EVER go to this place again. I might never even go to Cheesecake Factory ever again. A hair in the food I understand but gum?! That's sickening!"
