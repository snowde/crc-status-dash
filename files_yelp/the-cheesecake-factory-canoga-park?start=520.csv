Lacy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,125,5,5.0,9/2/2012,"I've actually never had a bad time at this particular cheesecake factory. The location is great; parking is never a hassle..and it's a fun place to just kind'a people watch and chill out. I went with a friend for happy hour - the last time I went was for happy hour as well - both times I sat in the bar area - at the tall-tables. I love the bread they bring. Sometimes I just go in with a friend and have wine and bread! and the servers don't seem upset about it.  We actually sat next to a funny guy who kept talking to us - we didn't care..but the wait-staff was all like ""oh my gosh! do you want us to get him to stop talking to you?!?!"" it was cute how concerned they were..but he wasn't really bothering us.  but it's nice to know that they're lookin' out for ya! I've never had a problem with any bitchy waitresses or waiters here..Although - sometimes during a not-so-busy hour, they seem preoccupied with side-work and could maybe be a little neglectful. but if you're just sitting there sipping on wine - it's not a big deal. - and i'm not a particularly needy guest at a restaurant - most of the time. I'll deff. go back; probably at happy hour again. =]"
Anne A.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,1618,3340,3.0,11/3/2012,"Dependable usually for service and food, but after last Sunday, service was really off. I've been eating at Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years, and this is the second time I received horrible service.  Once in San Francisco and now here in Woodland Hills. I was told on slower nights the service at Cheesecake Factory is bad. So, the tip is going during typically busy times of the day and receive the excellent service you can expect at Cheesecake Factory. This is probably the last time I would choose to eat at this location. I now prefer the Sherman Oaks location over this one as I have had consistently great service. I usually go to Cheesecake Factory for a dependable menu that can please any palate. So big groups are great  to bring at the Cheesecake. Our server hardly paid any attention to us and didn't refill our drinks. He didn't  remember when we stated it was our nephews 7th birthday dinner. We had to remind him that he wanted to blow out a candle on his cheesecake. He also messed up on our order -- forgot our order of crabcakes and gave us a double order of the ahi appetizer and even charged us for it for his screw up. They should fire the server here that we had last Sunday as he is giving this location a bad reputation if he continues to work here."
Abbalabbadoo C.,"Murrieta, CA",41,41,25,4.0,5/27/2013,The calamari and carbonara are yummmmm meatloaf was delish and service was great!
Kimberly B.,"Alhambra, CA",682,554,2647,3.0,9/12/2010,"My husband and I met up with another couple here to dine and have a few cocktails.  We waited for a little over half an hour to be seated meanwhile we grab a table at the bar and have an appetizer..  What I really didn't get was, we were given a buzzer to let us know our table was ready, but it never buzz and at the same time I see a waiter going around calling names of the guest to let them know their table is ready.  They are making their job twice as hard. The food was descent, the dessert red velvet cheesecake was fantastic.  Overall we had a real nice time.   I usally like to do take out too because the wait is too long, the food becomes average,and the server will be sloppy."
Lisa C.,"San Fernando, CA",0,5,1,3.0,2/15/2014,"Well... We Love the Cheesecake Factory, but since they moved, I felt during my meal, I was eating MALL food. Yuck! I've never really experienced a bad meal but this left me feeling sick.  Ambiance was good, staff friendly,but took forever to get our food. Ordered the chicken nachos & we sent them back bcuz the chicken was cold. They did it over & it was still cold. They explained it really wasn't a fresh item on the menu. We won't ever get those again. Plus we waited,and waiting with a 2 yr old is not easy. Also ordered a scoop of ice cream for her & by the time it came to our table it was melted. Not impressed, especially for our 1st time visit! We might of had more luck eating at giggles n hugs at the other end of the mall."
Chad Z.,"West Hills, CA",0,115,7,5.0,7/22/2014,Great food as always! Staff was very friendly and attentive. This is the new location and it looks great inside as most CCFs do. Definitely recommend!
Amby B.,"Porter Ranch, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/27/2015,Extremely poor service. Waitress looked totally disinterested...food takes ages to arrive. Would not recommend.
Maxx N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,3,5.0,2/4/2015,"Stopped by for a quick bite and some bevi with my wife and daughter. Justin D. provided skillful and knowledgable service and manager Vic made our experience the best with his friendliness and hospitality.  Big fans of Cheesecake, especially these people and this location. Thanks Justin and Vic!"
Dimitry V.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,1,,1.0,12/20/2015,Horrible Service!!! 12 minutes on hold for a take out order. I hope managers are reading this!!!
Kristine S.,"North Hills, CA",45,22,16,1.0,9/20/2014,almost an hour wait to be seated  and almost an hour wait for the food...good LORD we are starving!!!
Yunster Y.,"Northridge, CA",48,84,,3.0,5/29/2013,"Very standard in my opinion. OK in everything, not really extraordinary in anything. But they always have good locations. I always get the Cajun jambalaya. Thought about trying other dishes, but they all seem to be a fufu version of an authentic dish that I've had at some other mom-pop restaurant. In general, I only go because other people in the group wants to go."
Victoria R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,,1.0,11/5/2014,"LOVE THE FOOD! Service is pretty good also. BUT, who was the person that decided to move the The Cheesecake Factory from Canoga Blvd to Topanga Canyon Boulevard? This new place is smaller, waiting is on average 30-45 min, due to high demand   Cheesecake Factory needed to open a larger place not smaller! The front desk doesn't know left from right. You are waiting where waitress are walking with food, drinks. Just a horrible experience until you sits down. So now we go less and if we do decide to go, we go to the one far away from my home"
Alina T.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,29,4,1.0,6/7/2014,"I eat only in Cheesecake Factory, this is the closest location to my house, been there several time service was OK, the last couple of time was horrible!! I understand it's been Friday and everyone is busy, but they need to pay attention what's on customers plate!!! I got chicken Brest with hairs!!! She just took my plate no manager came to apologize only after we call the manager (since they try to charge us on something that I didn't even touch), it was nasty experience and I'm defiantly won't go there again! Waitress cares only about their TIP so they will serve a bigger table batter. Didn't like it, I'm disappointed   and never will eat this location again!"
Marby P.,"Port Hueneme, CA",1,15,,1.0,11/26/2014,Honestly deserves 0 stars took 45 minutes to get our food and my friend had to ask for his water twice the server seemed too not know anything about working in a restaurant and to top it off 15 after we got our food the server kept asking if we were done and if we wanted a box  . I suggest the thousand oaks one
Ram D.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,7,2,4.0,10/21/2015,"Appetizer were great , service is good , love the macadamia nut cheese cake"
Sydney R.,"Los Angeles, CA",204,5,,2.0,1/1/2016,This restaurant is poorly ran. I asked for a booth and was told the wait would be 45 minutes I asked for a booth. When my table was ready they ended up seating my party at a half table half booth. It was not what I asked for so I told the host I waited patiently for a booth. She said okay no problem. So they started walking us to the back corner right in front of the restroom. At this point I started to get angry. I walked up to the main host again and asked for a proper non- smelling booth. From that point I had to wait another 35 MINUTES for a booth. I was so hungry there was no point in leaving. When they finally sat us. The server took 10-15 minutes to get to us and took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. You would think the manager would realize what was happening and come and apologize. The only thing that held me back was my boyfriend and the great food (when we finally got it). Horrible customer service. Don't know if I will be back.
Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,3.0,8/1/2014,"Just A-OK. Rarely go to Cheesecake Factory, food is decent, cheesecakes are delicious but everything is overly priced. Decided to come here with a friend for National Cheesecake Day. Had to take advantage of slices being half off.  Food: My friend went with the Kobe burger and I got the lunch portion factory meatloaf. Food came out in decent time, didn't feel long but I think the table that came in after us got their food before us, maybe they ordered first? The burger looked delicious, the patty looked juicy, really juicy and it soaked to the bun, not a fan of that though. Stole some fries from my friend, a little bland but was crunchy. It was my first time getting the meatloaf and it was delicious. It was the lunch portion but there was still a good amount of food. The meatloaf was very flavorful and had a little crunchy outside and a juicy inside. The mash potatoes was alright, nothing too special but the gravy gave it good flavoring, the veggies were delicious though, good contrast to the meatloaf. It was good and filing even without finishing everything, had to save room for cheesecake.  Decided to split a cheesecake because we were pretty full. Plenty of choices and couldn't decide, ended up going with the red velvet one. Took a while to come out. Also had a little confusion, server thought we got it to-go when we wanted it there. But got it fixed quickly. Huge slice, thought it was going to be small with the deal they were having, couldn't finish it between the two of us. Always didn't like the cheesecake here since it's way too sweet but the red velvet one was not too sweet. Also to add onto the overly priced items, the strawberry lemonade was about $5 for something that tasted like Minute Maid from a carton. With that price you can get a beer at most places and it would have probably tasted better. Service: Was really crowded, expected being it was around lunch time and it being Cheesecake day. I like that instead of a pager they ask for your phone number and will text you when it's your table is ready. Table took about half an hour like they said it was going to take. What sucked was that they sat us ""outside"" as in not in the restaurant but in the sectioned off area inside the mall. It's weird to be having a meal with people shopping walking buy. At least there were pretty big fake bushes to act as a wall. Server was a little slow with things, didn't check up that often especially when we needed a drink refill."
Melissa R.,"Ventura County, CA",0,13,,5.0,12/30/2015,"We put in a last minute Christmas Eve order, and even though Cheesecake Factory requires 24 hours for even a small catering order, they took our order.  They couldn't have been nicer, and everyone loved the chicken piccata, which came on top of noodles, along with two kinds of wonderful long thin loaves of bread, and very nice black plastic serving utensils.  It was perfect, and made the dinner stress-free!  Thank you."
Roxanne R.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",38,12,2,1.0,10/12/2014,Horrible Service. .. the waiter didnt remeber our oder! She came back to us and she ask what did we order and we told her. Later much later our order came and it was wrong. They mention they would fix it and we waited over an hour! Hostess are rude. Well one particular is she tense to roll her eyes at people so childish!
Michelle R.,"New York, NY",199,724,99,3.0,6/22/2012,"Came here for a client dinner, and it ended up being a better experience than I had anticipated from the service to the food, etc.  I had their buffalo blasts, which came with a great hot sauce/bleu cheese on the side, avocado egg rolls, and crab wontons for appetizers.  The only app I actually enjoyed was the buffalo blasts since they were a cool take on buffalo wings/chicken tenders.  For my entree, I had salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes, which was reaaally good.  Overall, it was a good meal but with so many other choices in the area, I'm not sure if I'd come back of my own volition."
