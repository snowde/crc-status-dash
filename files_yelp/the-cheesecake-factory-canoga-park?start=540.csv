Christian R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/17/2015,"I was unsatisfied with the service. They had my people and I waiting for over an hour when they had already told us that our table was ready. Also after that hour of waiting, they had us wait on another 40 mins to bring our food. Horrible location to come to."
Forevermemorable F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,496,1497,4.0,8/2/2012,"Great pasta!  The kids loved the chicken stripes.  I think there cheesecake is waaaaaaay over priced!  I mean $7.95 for ""one"" slice of cheesecake...really!?  What a joke!  They don't even sell for that much in the stores.  If a cheesecake has 10 slices at $8 a pop, that is $80 for a whole cake...does anyone see anything wrong with that?  I would say, stay away from the overpriced cheesecake, because no cheesecake in the world is worth $7.95 a slice!"
TJ C.,"San Fernando, CA",2,8,,1.0,5/31/2014,Bunch of liars! We called and asked to see how long the wait was and they told us there's no wait. We get there in 15 mins but now there's a 45 min wait!
Jeff K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,9,1,4.0,12/23/2014,Great spot nice resteraunt awesome food and service too many different items to order and deserts and over 50 different types of cheese cake
Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,16,5.0,10/1/2015,i have been eating at the cheesecake factory for 10 years and never had a bad experience. the line got even longer when they moved to this new location but i will wait.
G B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,24,3,4.0,8/5/2014,"Obviously the food and dessert are amazing, and the brown bread is to die for!  The staff are very friendly.  I just don't like the new location.... something about seeing Forever 21 while I eat there is food court like to me.   For that, 4 stars.  Dolce De leeche cheesecake!!!!"
Wayne A.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,10,,4.0,4/13/2013,"If I want to go someplace and eat decadently, there's no place like The Cheese Cake Factory. You don't come here if you're on a diet (even if they do claim to have a ""skinny menu""). You come here because there's a menu the size of a small town's phone book with dishes that are measured in the thousands of calories. And really, that's not a bad thing, if done in moderation. When I was a kid, my father would yell if we went to a sit-down restaurant and I ordered a burger. The Cheesecake Factory has gotten me over this phobia because the burgers are so damn good. More importantly, they'll cook the burgers to order and this includes rare. Most sit-down burger places weenie out when you ask for a rare burger, but this place will serve it nice, pink and mooing. They'll even accommodate your need for meat, nothing but meat and just meat by serving it without the buns.  Of course, there's the cheesecake. Chances are, you'll want the cheesecake, but you'll never get to it because the meals are just so damn rich. My solution: eat the cheesecake first. You might get some weird looks when your cheesecake is followed by a burger or pasta, but hell, at least you know you came and ate the cheesecake."
Steve T.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/1/2013,"Recently visited the topanga mall location, but I do miss the previous location as I celebrated my college graduation there, along with many of my families birthdays. This place is great for a group and they always seem to get our complicated orders right on the first time. There are no reservations from when I last checked, so the wait varies depending on the day. Hosts do their best to seat you as fast as possible, and there is a bar and lounge option as well. The cheesecakes and desserts on display can also keep you occupied during the wait time. I'd give 4.5 STARS if I could, because the only thing they need to improve is the birthday dessert that they give you. I got a cup of whipped cream and chocolate syrup with a candle in it. The place has the word ""cheesecake"" in it, I was only disappointed in that."
Big B.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,8,,5.0,12/27/2013,"You know I keep waiting for the Cheescake Factory to start sucking and cutting cost and then eventually the quality of food will suffer but...this place is consistent and never fails.  I just love them so much and if you haven't tried already, please give the Bufallo Chicken Blast a try...they may be disguised as something else but I know that's what the Gand Lux used to call them. Bravo Cheesecake!!!"
Cynthia A.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",17,64,4,3.0,3/1/2014,"The food is great but the new location is very small compared the old location. I feel like the place lost it's appeal. The place is super crowded even during the week, not the same vibe. The good thing is at least the food still taste the same but for me it's not worth the hassle of waiting half am hour for a table where it's over crowded and loud"
Robert S.,"Calabasas, CA",132,42,5,1.0,3/27/2014,"I love the food, but the service needs help bad. Ever since they moved to the new location. It's been very inconsistent. Plus the 1 hour wait doesn't help. Hope management steps up ASAP."
Holly T.,"Atlanta, GA",0,27,7,1.0,5/4/2014,"Terrible customer service! Long wait time for to go order, then the waiter argued with me about how many pancakes come in a order (mind you this is part of my Sunday routine) ordered pancakes and the waiter said they ran out syrup when i asked for more. my suspicion is he just didn't want to go get it!  Talked to the manager Dave and he reassured me they did have syrup but He could care less! The only thing I ordered was a side of pancakes! thank you cheesecake factory for sending me home with pancakes and no syrup!!!"
Jenny D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,37,48,4.0,8/7/2014,"Our server was Ken. I believe that was his name. He was a very nice gentleman with longer length gel back dark hair. We ordered the calamari, kids corn dog, kids chicken tenders, crab cakes, filet mignon, spaghetti with marinara, and an order of spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Everything was great but our server forgot to place the order in for the chipotle chicken pasta and remembered it when we were already done eating and full. He notified the kitchen ASAP and brought our food out in just a matter of minutes. He was very apologetic and made sure we knew how sorry he was. And as a way of saying sorry, he offered a complimentary slice of cheesecake for us to make up for his mistake. He was so sweet. But only 4 stars because it took forever to get our bill. We were there for 2 and a half hours. But ken was awesome!!!!"
Dillon E.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",35,7,1,1.0,8/6/2014,Last night was our anniversary dinner and not only did our server fail to bring our meal to us. When we finally watched the couple sitting next to us who came in and ordered after we did they got their plate at least 15 minutes before some guy in a chefs outfit brought our meal to us. Server was nowhere to be found and nobody else bothered to check in. Not only was the plate already room temperature when the chef brought it to us we had to continuously ask for bread when our mystery server decided to check in to our table. Needless to say we will not be returning. I do not recommend this location to anyone looking to get decent service!
Edan B.,"Newport Beach, CA",3,12,,5.0,9/1/2014,"There is a time that I look and say to my self ""hey didn't I eat hear yesterday I am tired of this place, or didn't I eat there. I am tired of going to these restaurant over and over eating the same thing.""  But let me tell you no way that a person can say that about cheese cake factory. There food's are so good there hamburgers are so jucy and tender, there boneless buffalo wings are so rich in taste dam don't get me started on there cheese cake's. WOW boy there cheese cake are so good it is so moist that it melts in your mouth dam so good. let me tell you something the most important thing they have. They have not just the food that you won't get tired of or the cake's that melt in your mouth. THEY have great service. The waiter and waitresses always bring so much fun to the customer and they are so fast quick and so nice that I have joy giving them a large tip. I LOVE U CHEESE CAKE FACTORY."
Ki F.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",103,131,225,5.0,9/25/2013,"One of the best in USA !! I don't know if someone cannot like there food , nice place , yes it's busy b it's very good !!! Don't miss  this Resternt  , it's always clean , like it !!!"
Samantha T.,"Boise, ID",124,640,125,4.0,4/22/2012,"I only do Cheesecake for take-out. This one has a valet fee and is usually packed to the gill so it's just easier to order ahead, swoop in and pick up and be in and out in no more than 15 minutes. Plus who doesn't love cheesecake to go?"
Veronica K.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,124,15,5.0,12/29/2012,"Huge selectu in of different foods for breakfast lunch and dinner. Place runs very smooth and efficiently. Staff are alway running to keep up. Doing a great job. Try the tamales, its great. One last piece of advise, don't order too much food because the food portions are huge.  Cheescake factor is also convenient for takeout and office parties."
Imuei D.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,49,,1.0,3/15/2014,"I've had it with this place! I came here the other night to pick up a cheesecake (gotta satisfy those late-night craving pangs) and had to wait nearly half an hour just for the girl to ""grab the cheesecake real quick"". You would've thought she was freaking making the cheesecake from scratch with how long I had to wait... but not even! She and all the other workers behind the cheesecake counter were standing there chatting with each other having a jolly ol' time while I stood waiting, giving them my best stink-eye. Finally, a manager came out and saw me glaring and asked me if everything was alright. He wishes! I told him the situation and in return got a slice of cheesecake of my choice on the house, but that's the least they could've done. Never going to this Cheesecake Factory again. I love Cheesecake Factory (especially this one's old location), but after all the horrible service I've received here, I will gladly take my business to a different location."
Gaziwo A.,"West Covina, CA",0,66,1,2.0,9/26/2015,"Just had the sheila chicken and avocado salad, its not as good as before. Cant see much avocado in it!! Most of all, the chicken is chewy and hard to eat .....hard to swallow down the throat!! Hopefully it will be better next time!"
