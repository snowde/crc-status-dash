Nadine A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,8,5,5.0,12/7/2014,I've been coming to Chesecake Factory for many years now and I've always had a nice experience but the last time I was there I had the BEST service ever! Our waiter CODY had a great attitude from the very start. He gave us some amazing food suggestions and he kept us smiling with his small chat while he constantly checked on us to see if we needed anything. Cody was very attentive and continuously refilled our drinks and bread throughout our meal. He's definitely an asset to your restaurant. Thank you Chesecake Factory for your amazing food and Cody for your fantastic suggestions and service :-)
Mary K.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,13,,4.0,9/26/2014,"Go during off-peak time, and you'll get what is to be expected from Cheesecake. Solid food, consistent with every visit. Decent service. Reasonable ambience considering it's a restaurant inside the mall. Only thing seriously lacking is parking adjacent to the restaurant. What's up with that?! Should have considered this when moving location of restaurant."
Selena D.,"Valencia, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/7/2015,"Today my family and I attended this location for a nice dinner. At the front desk, we told the lady our name and we were told that it would take 25 minutes to be seated. We ended up waiting for almost and hour. When we notified the front desk of our concerns, we were told that it would only take about six minutes. Well, guess what! It took nearly another half hour until we complained to the manager. We brought to the attention of the manager our dilemma. He tried to get us out together at our own table, but he ended up not helping. When we finally got seated, our server came to the table and we had explained the situation to her. She then told us another story of when the front desk had seated two parties together who did not even know each other. Other than our server, the rest of our experience was not acceptable."
Cynthia B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",32,4,2,2.0,1/4/2014,"We've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years.  It's like family.  Not the most exciting, wild, cutting edge spot...but the food is great, bar is amazing, and the atmosphere is wonderful for kids.  Usually, even though they are busy, the service is good.  The waiters and waitresses are juggling, easily twenty things at once, and do it with panache.  HOWEVER...my family went to this spot on Thursday night.  I ordered the Petite Filet, medium rare.  Sadly, it came back cooked very inconsistently.  It was an odd little cut--part medium well, part medium, part medium rare.  I asked the waiter to send it back.  Waiter was great.  No problem.  THEN the manager, a middle-aged gentleman came over.  The condescension was dripping...""Ma'am this IS our medium rare...""  He went on to say that if I wanted it rare that was another thing.  When I pointed out that it was cooked differently throughout, he, honestly, pulled out his cell phone and turned on the flashlight and  slowly scanned the meat, again, basically questioning whether I was correct or not.  So I showed him...again.  He finally agreed, but with a not great attitude.  When I pointed out that this was not the best customer service in the world, he offered, among other things, for me to eat it and not charge me.  A bit like saying, I know you don't like it, we're going to throw it away after we take it from this table, but HEY...we'll give it to you for FREE!   The truth is, I was a waitress for years and if I did anything like that to a customer I'd have, very possibly been fired.  Flashlight to disprove a customer?  Even if I was wrong...and a jerk...which I wasn't (and which I sadly dealt with many times over the years)...I would still with great diplomacy take it back to the kitchen.   The bright spot was the manager who was over this guy.  She was lovely and said that she would speak to him. She offered to take something off of our bill, give us free dessert etc...We appreciated her offer so much.  But, sometimes I want folks to know that if someone is complaining, it's not just because they want a reduction in the bill.  It's because they want the owners/managers to know that something is wrong...  I want them to know...Because if it were my business, I'd want to know.  I suppose I still give them a two (instead of a three for the very cool female manager) because the guy really shouldn't be there.  He made our dining experience quite awful, and I can't imagine that we are the only people he impacts negatively."
Mathew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,2.0,9/19/2015,"just left the cheesecake factory. Very disappointed. Service was slow and the waitress kept getting our drink order wrong. We wrote this off to being there in the middle of shift change. No big deal. Our appetizer of Ahi carpacchio came and it was excellent but unfortunately that was the highlight of our dining experience. we ordered a combo of steak Diane and some chicken dish. The steak was tough and tasteless and the chicken was bland. we also got an order of bellagio chicken which was mediocre at best. we decided to box up the dinners and take them home and we ordered a slice of white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and a slice of blackout cake, along with a couple cups of coffee. While the cheesecake. was pretty good, the cake was very dry and we never did get our coffee. All in all it was a poor dining experience."
Samantha P.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,36,,5.0,7/14/2015,"I love this location! We sat in the bar area and were greeted by our server Justin D. within seconds! We ordered the delicious avocado egg rolls to start with! Then we got our largely portioned food super quick! Our waiter was so on top of everything from drinks, to boxing our food, to just being soooo personable! The ambiance, service, and food was fabulous def coming back soon!:)"
Vic A.,"Reseda, CA",5,31,2,1.0,3/6/2014,"Be aware of the rude manly chick working at the bar. She must be from the Bronx or something. She's short with a ponytail possibly Hispanic. Instead of asking what I would like after I finally got her attention, she literally has the balls to say ""What do you need?"" I tell you what I need, I need you to go work at the LA Fitness across the street not behind the bar at Cheesecake Factory."
Frankie C.,"Joshua Tree, CA",171,208,30,4.0,3/25/2014,Food is always tasty and the service is surprisingly great every time.
Michael N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/8/2014,"Went on a Sunday night. It was somewhat busy, but we did not mind waiting. They had us give our phone number and when our table would be ready, they would send a text -- which was a nice feature but poorly executed (read on for details). During this time we explored the connected mall, staying in shops that were close by. Once we got our text, we came right back within 2-3 minutes. I do not know if our table was given away in this 2-3 minutes, but after getting back they had us wait there for another 12 minutes which was extremely discouraging. Others also seemed to have the same fate of being called back and waiting on the side until the table was really ready since 4 others were called before us after we got back (they were there before us on the side), so I do not think it was just us. Food was fair at best, however I have always had great tasting meals at other Cheesecake Factory locations. So by comparison, it was poor for their standards. I had made a note to my date that the thrown together pasta she made previously was much better than the one she ordered. Service was fine, water was always filled. We did have a little over 10 minutes between the first time the waitress came to take our order and us saying, ""just another minute"", but I will not hold that against her since it was busy. Overall, I give a 1 star since I expected a good dinner out and the food really disappointed us and that is what I care about most with the review. In addition, the text saying our table was ready even though it was no where near being ready started our dining experience off poorly. I can say with confidence I have no plans to ever go back to this location."
Ben B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",48,42,7,3.0,5/17/2014,They have good food but it is pricey. The service is decent. I like their Chicken Madera dish.
Sherri Johnson J.,"Woodland Hills, CA",99,19,6,4.0,9/1/2014,Lilly is a great server! She was very polite and conscious. The food was great but the lemon cheesecake was amazing!
Miel D.,"Pacoima, CA",1,21,3,5.0,7/27/2015,"Hi this review is not about the food because Cheesecake Factory always makes me happy...ALWAYS. This review is about Scott at the Topanga location. Scott has true work ethic and I NEVER say that well hardly ever. Scott was amazing not pushy and knew the menu well, he checked up on our party at the right time."
Henan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,406,1169,5.0,8/16/2010,"Best cheesecake factory I've been to thus far :) From the outside its pretty inconspicuous but the decor inside is pretty much what you expect from a Cheesecake factory. The layout was very spacious though so i give it top marks. The food was amazing...i had the Shrimp Franchese that came with snow peas, tomatoes and shrimp tossed in butter, capers and angel hair pasta. My party also feasted on the Shrimp Platter that was served with cole slaw and fries.  The Chinese Chicken salad sandwich seemed to be as filling"
Steve S.,"Calabasas, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/12/2014,They told us that the wait was five minutes to ten minutes it was a thirty minute wait and then we asked them how much longer they said under ten minutes and after ten minutes we went back and they told us  five more They have good food but it will be a really long wait
Jenifer H.,"Chatsworth, CA",2,8,,4.0,4/2/2012,"I came here for a late supper on a Saturday night with some friends.  To be more precise, we got there at 10:00 pm and was seated in about 20 minutes.  I wanted to sit out on the terrace since it was a nice night and wasn't too chilly.  Didn't happen, we had an okay semi booth and chairs seating.  This place was very confusing.  I mean it was like a maze in here.  When I had to use the ladies' room, one of the waitress had to physically escort me to this really odd place in the restaurant for the restroom.   Anyways, the place was crowded and loud, as expected for a Saturday night.  The food was good, not great, but good.  we ordered calamari, deep fried macaroni cheeseball, and some buffalo wings looking thing for appetizers after scarfing down a few bread basket that they normally provide complementary lol.  My main dish was a pasta dish (I forgot the exact name) but it was pretty good.    I like the dark ambiance of Cheesecake Factory as usual.  This was a nice Cheesecake factory.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the waitress didn't even offer us anything to drink as we sat down.  My friends and I had to hail her down because we were getting thirsty as we were looking over the menu.  This particular Cheesecake Factory seems really big for some reason, but next time I'm coming here, I want to try eating out in the terrace.  Also, their alcoholic drinks were so-so.  I wouldn't mind if they made their drinks a bit stronger, but then maybe I just have a high tolerance for booze : )"
Kat K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,4,3.0,8/23/2015,We went here last night and we didn't have very good dinner. They weren't busy but the customer service was bad. Food took so long to come out & my plate was little salty. I don't know if we still want to try this place again next time.
Bahar S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",36,94,61,2.0,3/4/2015,"Terrible service! What a shame... This place has gone downhill! So sad bc cheesecake is my husband's favorite restaurant. The 2 stars are because the food was decent.  My girlfriends and I went to dinner tonight and from the moment we sat down the server was awkward and had attitude.  She rushed us through the entire time as if there was a line out the door.. There was no wait tonight which says it all. When she took our order she asked me if the sides that come with my salmon are fine. I asked ""oh well do I have other options""? Then she tells me the vegetable options other than broccoli so I pick asparagus. Then when we get the bill she charged me extra for the swap while she never mentioned there would be a charge. Her shift ends before we ordered tea and she doesn't even come and let us know she's leaving and we get a different server (which was not much more personable either ). I had ordered a cheesecake  togo with the first girl which she never brought nor happened to mention to our new server. I mean the list goes on and on. We called the manager over and shared all of our concerns and all he did was say ""oh she's typically a very good server, I will talk to her"".  I definitely do not want to go to this cheesecake location anymore. If my husband insists we will have to go to a different location."
GG M.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,684,140,2.0,11/17/2012,"Havent been here in a year, changed menu and have tons of items. This night wasnt memorable for the right reasons. Besides our server who was nice (chad, chaz, not sure he was a young black man) food not that good. Salads=not crisp very soggy or have that spoling edges look. Thai lettuce wraps=chicken on them great, but again lettuce was limp and nappy. Popcorn shrimp=ordered for son felt so bad was terrrible. Worse than supermarket freezer aisles. Wifes turkey salad was a joke and gross. Shit inhaling friend ate bang bang chicken with rice looked nastee Used to love this place maybe just wasnt my night and chose wrong items."
Kate D.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,4,,4.0,9/23/2015,"Always great food and service. Not the greatest location, but overall a good choice for dinner in the area."
Ashley D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",605,118,100,4.0,4/8/2014,Great service and amazing food. I honestly love the whole texting to call your party thing. It's genius! I also love the ambiance and architecture of this Cheesecake Factory. It's nice having to walk to this location other then having to go across the street when it was on victory. Definitely coming here again!
