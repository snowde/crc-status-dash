Yelena K.,"Nashville, TN",166,275,167,4.0,12/6/2011,"What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? Ummm.... spiked milkshakes?  Yes, please. Giant portions?  I'll take 'em. Genuine, friendly service?  Right on. I sometimes wish the service was SLOWER so I wouldn't feel weird about just hanging out and sipping on my drink for a little longer.  We're always seated quickly and everything goes off without a hitch.  I've seen them be very accommodating to large groups, people in wheelchairs, people with young kids, etc.  Everything's always delicious.  It's The Cheesecake Factory and, let's face it, it's kind of magical... even if the ladies at the next table are talking about fertility treatments."
Debbie M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",99,329,95,5.0,11/9/2013,Went the other day for lunch and we had the most phenomenal waiter in the bar area. I think his name was TJ or something like that. He was awesome! And the food was off the hook delicious! Yum yum yum!
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,148,2,4.0,5/25/2013,"I usually have a good experience going to this cheesecake. There does seem to always be a wait of about 30-45 minutes. The service is usually great and the food comes out good and on time. The strawberry lemonade is great. There is a great variety of food. The chicken piccata is great and so is the steak. Obviously, a variety of cheesecakes for dessert.  Overall, good experiences here, good food, and good service."
Shannon D.,"Simi Valley, CA",15,48,6,1.0,8/26/2011,"I'll start by saying, that I used to be a regular at the TO location, prior to moving to Woodland Hills. The past two times I have been in to this location, I have been under impressed. The first time, our server was incredibly busy; therefore, she was unable to provide us with good service. My friends and I understand that this happens, as we are all servers ourselves. When our baked potato soup arrived it was cold, so we had to send three bowls back, to get hot fresh ones. By the time we left, we thought we had received bad service, but she was polite and very sweet, and we knew she overwhelmed so we let it slide. Last night, on the other hand, was a complete joke. I went for happy hour with two friends. We sat at a cocktail table, and received horrrible service. Our server had a total of three tables, including us, so I know she wasn't that busy. She took forever to take our order! At one point o ordered a second drink, and it took ten minutes to get to the table! My sister and boyfriend came late to join us, she saw them, and never offered them drinks or anything. There was also a point where there was only one out of five of us that had any beverage left in their glass. When our food came, after waiting a couple minutes, I had to get up and ask the hostess for silverware. It was truly awful. I was so bent out of shape, I could hardly enjoy the time with my friends. The food was what we expected, aside from the burnt chips that accompanied our guacamole. The gauc was tasty, as were the buffalo blasts, and potstickers. The happy hour pricing is def worth checking out. Only $5 for a variety of different apps, all of which are huge.  As much as I love Cheesecake Factory, not sure that I'll return to this location. I'd rather drive 15 minutes to Thousand Oaks, where I know I will receive good service and an enjoyable experience. Edit: Third bad experience in a row. Three of my friends and I waited ten minutes, and were never greeted. My friend went up to the host stand and asked if we could be moved to the patio, where we sat another ten minutes without being greeted. My friend went and spoke to the manager, who took our drink order. It took us another ten minutes to get our bar drinks. So a total of 30 minutes for us to get drinks and place our order. OUTRAGEOUS. The manager said sorry for waiting, and that was all. Didn't offer a complimentary appetizer or dessert or anything."
Razmik M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,3,,1.0,8/4/2014,this is a super busy restaurant with very unprofessional personals I was there with my wife had a waiter who was handling 2 tables and had no time to fulfil our needs price is not the issue here its how they attend to the customers after I ordered my food there were no sauces to use with the food and and no one paid attention to what the needs were.  Sad but its my first time leaving a negative feedback. Short and sweet I do not recommend this place at all.
Cher B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/7/2014,"The food was delish, the service was great. We really enjoyed ourselves. Nothing to complain about at all.I had the grilled artichoke with lemon aioli, a Caesar Salad, and a combo dinner of Herb Salmon and Steak Diane, and my friend had a burger with a salad. Everything was good. No wait for the table, we day on the patio cause out was so nice outside. Lovely evening !!!"
Sabrina G.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",79,92,10,4.0,9/13/2011,"I usually dont review chain's because usually most people have been there but I like The Cheesecake Factory. I go often.  They have a very large menu and you can usually order anything you are craving. Pasta; salad; sandwich;steak; whatever you want they will most likely have.  I love their bread. Its amazing. And actually, try it with their balsamic dressing and Parmesan cheese. Mmmmm!!!"
Andrew P.,"San Marcos, CA",124,448,15,3.0,4/7/2012,"I've been to a few different locations, and this one is decent.  Parking sucks pretty badly here though.  The food was good, a bit bland, but decent enough.  However, it's quite expensive and I'm not really sure it's worth the money.  I had a piece of cheesecake, and my guess is that it had been sitting awhile as it was quite dry... bummer.  The menu is huge, but they really do have something here for every craving which is nice... however, I am curious as to how this may negatively be effecting the quality of the food.  Our server was very friendly and had some pretty good recommendations.  In all, I wasn't blown away, but I'd give them another shot."
Chrias C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",187,30,,4.0,4/21/2014,First time at this location. In comparison to the location at the Americana service was not the greatest. But food was good
Skyeler K.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,44,17,4.0,3/14/2014,"I don't usually like the corporate restaurants but I LOVE this Cheesecake Factory. Friendly staff, fresh food, great ambiance especially the outside patio. Very impressed with this location!"
Jim G.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",502,587,69,4.0,9/27/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has really maintained their consistency over the years.  This used to be my fancy dining option about 15 years ago, now it is just a solid option for good drinks, tasty appetizers, huge entrees, and of course cheesecake!  We last went and ate at the bar. Unfortunately on Fridays there is only a happy hour until 6, and it is only on food - not so happy!  We ended up getting a couple of drinks, the Thai pasta and the springs rolls. Both were good and our bartender Brent was great. Valet parking is $3.75."
Polly B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",3,34,,5.0,6/7/2014,"The wait time was 5-10 minutes on a Saturday!  Our attentive waiter Greg was great!! Excellent service. I ordered chicken enchiladas with a side Caesar salad-- delicious!!  My friend ordered grilled salmon with asparagus (and mashed potatoes, if you wish) The friendly and personable manager David, stopped by our table to see how everything was going. Excellent lunch. You will love the skinnylicous menu!!"
Anthony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,8/16/2014,Like the place and the new location. Food is good anthe service is good. The waiters are nice and helpful. Cheescake is great. Will go back.
Danielle L.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",8,2,7,5.0,10/6/2013,Lexy is the best server at cheesecake! She recommended the best drinks to get. (JW lemonade.... AMAZING!) and understood our annoying love for the brown bread!! She is the best!
Tina E.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,41,15,1.0,4/2/2014,"Unbelievable!!!! Never have I been so disgusted by a manager! Disrespectful, rude,  and unable to run a restaurant!   If your employee gives an inaccurate information to a customer as a manager you should be able to do anything to accommodate your guest.   Called in to make a reservation for a party of 15 the ""new"" staff member hold me to call back and speak to a mngr.   I called back and he said no and disconnected the call.   When I arrived the mngrs said that we have to wait for 2 1/2 hours.    Thank G-D CPK  was around the corner and was able to accommodate my party."
Doron K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",626,152,28,5.0,10/20/2013,Always a fan of Cheesecake Factory and the new one is no exception. Great layout and nice new location. Ill be coming here a lot!
G G.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,13,,2.0,11/19/2014,"Popular, medium-priced  spot with a very lengthy menu.  That's not an entirely good thing.  From the restaurant's perspective, it means some serious guesswork about getting inventory out & served, and getting bucks in the register instead of food in the dumpster.   From the diner's perspective, it means, to some unknown extent, a roll of the dice with regard to the condition of the food.  I rolled the dice on Sunday evening and came up a big loser.  My historically cast iron stomach scarcely contained it until I got home.  Twelve hours and a great deal of grief later, with the stuff finally out of my system, I recovered.  Don't think I'd care to gamble here again.  Say what you want about the fast food joints, but their meat, etc turns over much faster & I've never wanted to die waiting for it to exit my GI tract."
Fidel Danilo F.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/9/2015,"The Reservation Counter manned by a guy today (Aug.9,2015 at 3.30pm) sucks. My wife was told that there is a 15 minutes wait to be seated. We waited and noticed that those who arrived seated ahead of us. My wife went to talk with this reservation guy 3x (that was after waiting past 15 minutes already) who pointed us to wait in the corner next to the counter. However, other customers who came in and reserved later than us were seated. We left the restaurant and went to CPK where we were immediately seated and served. I am not gonna go back to that Cheesecake Factory no more."
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,2,1.0,5/17/2015,This is a horrible location. At first they told me it was going to be a 45 min wait and it ended up being an 1:15 min wait. The waiters didn't care about their customers and didn't even come see if we were okay or if we needed a refill on drinks. Very in satisfied. Needs more improvement and more employees.
Natalie A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,20,2,5.0,5/14/2014,"This is a great restaurant, me and my family and all my friends go for dinner at lease once a week. service is great, if they make a mistake on your food they change it right away no questions asked. their Avocado rolls and salmon dishes are wonderful. I am glad such restaurant exist."
