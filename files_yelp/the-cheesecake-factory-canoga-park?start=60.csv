Adrienne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,76,161,3.0,1/9/2017,"Yelp 100 Challenge: 2/100 ""I don't 'do' chain restaurants or fast food"" says the date who's body clearly didn't come from fruits and vegetables, nor butter and champagne. Although, such a comment was made at the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove many centuries ago, one may never forget. The Cheesecake Factory is where you go to bring yourself back down to size. With the many LA restaurants, dinners at Mr. Chow, driving around MILK only to scurry in and out before the parking people  show up, it is a consistent and tasty place amid all of the madness. The menu is very much book like, they quite literally, have it all! Asian cuisine, some breakfast items served all day, and about a million different cheesecake flavors. This location is almost always crowded and we waited nearly an hour for one of the smaller tables. No complaints there, it's busy most times even on weekdays. I had the veggie burger which Cheesecake describes as ""A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Mushrooms, Black Beans and Onion"". The burger is huge, piping hot and the fries were well seasoned. Not bad for a meatless Monday! The orange chicken an lemon ricotta pancakes are worth a mention her as well. I would return during breakfast hours, they open pretty early at 10am on weekends. Sometimes the bakery staff can be less than savory which is a bit of a complaint, but nothing to go into detail about. I will return if I'm feeling fancy, but not LA fancy because it's definitely one of the better chain restaurants."
Eve W.,"West Hills, CA",4,30,10,5.0,10/23/2017,This location has come a long way. The service is almost always excellent and the food very tasty. Large portions and a really great location in the Topanga mall. We love coming here.
Klzlad D.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",3,71,335,4.0,7/30/2017,First time for breakfast here it was ok but I'll stick to dinner better. We sat in the patio and service was a little slow but the server was nice.
Kristie K.,"Chatsworth, CA",1,48,28,4.0,10/22/2017,"2nd time this month we had happy hour here ... The chicken sliders are the best, you get 4 which is more then enough to share if your not that hungry and are looking to drink and share a piece of cheesecake ... We usually sit at the bar so we can get our drinks quicker and faster  service ... We got there at 5:45 on Friday night and the bartender was accommodating at taking our order before 6 pm as that is when happy hour is over but she never asked us how our food was or if we needed a refill ... The mojito's on the happy hour menu are pretty good, but if you are looking for something a little stronger I highly recommend the strawberry martini as it is just that good ... It is not on the happy hour menu but you won't be disappointed ... Overall we had a good night and drinks out with a friend is always a plus"
Bobby C.,"Canoga Park, CA",403,129,392,4.0,12/19/2016,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already said before? I love the environment, atmosphere, and of course THE CHEESECAKE! I'm a basic man who knows what he wants and rarely steers away from it. I usually like to start with the dark honey oat bread. I feel like they never make enough of it because the waiter and waitress' are always so stingy with it and keep bringing out a white bread or their out of the honey oat bread. I could eat that bread for days.  On to the appetizers, while I'm sure they have all types of amazing appetizers, the best one is the avocado egg rolls. Literally, i can go to this place and just get 3 orders of these things. Dare I say one of gods gift to earth? Lol. Now for entree's they have some AMAZING options. Usually my go to's are the Chicken Fettuccini alfredo, BBQ Chicken salad and last but not least the Santa Fe Salad. I'm sure there are so many more that I would like but never gave them a chance. This place is great for a date and they have valet parking.  Finally, their cheesecake, while it is still pretty good, it is not the best I've tried. Pretty good stuff but for being called ""The Cheese Cake Factory"" I think you can do better than you currently are. I've tried over 7 of their cheesecakes and have yet to be blown away by one. Still, it's good stuff and a good restaurant. Enjoy!!!"
Aneiscia E.,"Santa Maria, CA",138,39,76,5.0,6/3/2017,"Steffani V., our waitress was one of the best waitresses we've ever had! The food was finger licking good too! 5* experience."
Jonathan H.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,3,3.0,10/28/2017,"Good food but bad service. I went to the bathroom and came back to find my food was gone and my Table had been given away. On the top of that my bread plate was wet and my silverware had water spots on it. Overall, it was an irritating experience."
Marisa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,95,27,1.0,5/7/2017,"I have been ordering the French country salad at various Cheesecake Factories for over a decade now and I've never had problems with this entree until I came to this location, which I've been to twice and I have been very disappointed both times. At all the other Cheesecake Factories, the salad comes with good portions of asparagus, goat cheese, beets, pecans, and mixed greens. At this location, it comes with 5 cups of mixed greens, one spear of asparagus cut into four pieces, a tablespoon of pecans, a tablespoon of beets, and a teaspoon of goat cheese. The portion of the pecans was okay but there was not enough goat cheese, beets, or asparagus and there was way too much mixed greens. The waiter and manager were not apologetic. I will never go to this Cheesecake Factory again."
Edd P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,33,3.0,7/24/2017,"Hmm will the service is great, our server was very nice and does his job like he loves it. Not many restaurants have that kind of employees. But my food was not really that great, I order the shepherd pie. It really not a shepherds pie since it not made out of beef, but it's whatever I order it anyways because I love them both. But it turn out it was not even bake, the ground beef was in lumps and kind of dry soaked in gravy. The carrots were under cook and so was the peas. Over all the dish was not that great. But really should work on making a good dish and change the name to cottage since it's beef!"
Kayla M.,"Palmdale, CA",0,12,,5.0,12/18/2017,"Best experience I've had at any location I've been to (and I've been to a lot). The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to dine at, this location exceeded all expectations! I had the pleasure of having Alex as my waiter. He was very attentive and had great communication skills. He made great recommendations as well. I'll definitely be back soon!"
Jose P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,61,4,5.0,10/21/2017,"Wait time was 40 min! Its not their fault its a Saturday night around 7:30pm. Expect long wait times at peak hours. Plus its wifeys' favorite restaurant and her birthday is tomorrow. This restaurant is a bit pricey but worth every penny. Food is fantastic, and you get big portions. Ambiance is intimate eventhough the place is packed. Stop by for lunch or dinner you will not be dissapointed, dont forget the cheesecake."
Kathy H.,"Culver City, CA",1241,348,1294,4.0,3/21/2016,"I hate to admit it but I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. Yeah, their food is typical but I do enjoy their portion sizes and how huge their textbook menus are. I'm currently on a diet so it's nice that they have a Skinnylicious menu - all items are under 590 calories and once again their portions are huge! My usual is the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo with brown rice (sooooo delicious) but since that's a whopping 1600 calories I opted for the skinnylicious Mexican Tortilla Salad which was only 570 calories. It was packed with so much flavor and since it was a big portion I took half of it home. I have to add that Cheesecake needs to add more vegan options to their menu. My friend is currently fasting and has to go vegan and it was nearly impossible to find anything without modifying all the ingredients. Our server Jason was a champ though! He made sure to accommodate my friend and came back to our table countless times to give us modifications. Hands down best server there! By the way, my favorite cheesecake is the strawberry cheesecake. Soooo yummy and has less calories than any of the other chocolate ones. I bought my boyfriend the Oreo cheesecake and it was way too decadent."
Jeffrey S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1399,115,128,5.0,9/29/2016,"This experience above all was heightened by our waiter Cody. His sense of humor and menu knowledge goes beyond the call of duty. I've been dining at this location for over 10 years and I can honestly say nobody has captured the spirit of CF like he does.  He made sure to touch back at our table within a minute of our food being served and even made sure everything was to our liking. He treated my date and I like royalty. Unfortunately the Tex Mex egg rolls were a bit too filled with diced onions. He saw to it that we were not billed for that item. This man deserves a raise, I left him 45% tip.  Thanks Cody, will be back in your section soon."
Alon S.,"Calabasas, CA",56,73,,2.0,3/25/2017,"This place is mediocrity at its finest. If you are into cuisine, ingenuity in dishes, and seek restaurant experiences to impress then consider elsewhere.  The place is a good family restaurant to go to, lively environment and just a good all around restaurant to eat at with people who don't converse on fine dining with their peers. Every meal here is like eating a premium microwaveable meal or a dish out of a cookbook you'd respect. That's why. 2 stars. Meh. I've experienced better. Ordering a salad is 1,900 Calories. Does anybody got any logic here????????!!!!!!! THe service was good but I received dishes with thick levels of grime."
Melody A.,"San Francisco, CA",88,301,817,5.0,11/18/2016,I love the food portion and taste especially when I'm hungry hehe. Polite nice servers I like here
Elizabeth R.,"San Fernando, CA",89,33,77,5.0,6/19/2017,I haven't been in the area lately but made sure to stop into my one of favorite restaurants in the valley! The staff greeted me right away and was very friendly as always. The air conditioning was perfect for this hot so-cal weather and my iced tea lemonade was refreshing with my salad on this particularly hot afternoon. I don't even have to go on about the food but I love everything on the menu from appetizers to the dinners. If I am treating myself I get steak and if I want to share I get a pasta. So many choices and such a nice environment. Avoid near holidays if you're looking for a quick experience because let's be realistic about eating at a restaurant at a mall during the busiest shopping month of the year. Summer is perfect time to come here while shopping with friends or family.
Lea F.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",101,76,31,4.0,10/5/2017,Excellent service and food here. The food is always made to perfection and you have almost anything you can think of. Food and service is 5 stars but the wait can be much. I suggest grabbing a seat at the self seating area and grabbing a drink while waiting for your table. Must order is the avocado roll. This is the greatest invention!!
Rachael K.,"Riverside, CA",184,40,25,4.0,8/23/2017,"I like coming here because the selection is great not only for 'regular food' but also because they have great gluten free options, which works for us, because my sister has a gluten allergy-and it is hard to find good food for everyone! Service is usually really friendly and good. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes-which isn't bad in this area. Parking can be a problem though."
Laurel R.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",383,2,,5.0,10/23/2017,"The great thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they somehow manage to replicate their brand, excellent customer service, and delicious food at every location across the US. This franchise at the Westfield Topanga Mall is no exception."
Oguz H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,4,5.0,2/13/2017,If i need to get with someone in somewhere together my place is Cheescake Factory.  They serve many options and cool atmosphere. I like all dips and all Cheescakes here.
