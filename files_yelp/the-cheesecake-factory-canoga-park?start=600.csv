Scott H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,7/23/2015,"Giving this a 5 star rating because of the way they handled a situation. The poor waiter accidentally dropped 2 full glasses of strawberry lemonade on the table and into my lap. He was so apologetic and concerned he went over board trying to make up for his accident. The assistant manager and manager came over and tried to help. The whole team took what could have been a terrible experience and made me feel like they really cared. It's easy to do good when everything goes right, what really matters is how you perform when things go wrong. They did an excellent job and I commend them for it."
Setareh G.,"Calabasas, CA",91,14,2,1.0,6/8/2015,"So I'm one of the Cheesecake Factory fans all the time for all the occasions but our last visit to the Topanga one really disappointed me for several reasons. First of all we were 4 people celebrating my brother and my friend's Birthday, when sat down waiting for our servers my cousin noticed that the small plate in front of him is dirty and when he lifted the plate underneath the plate was super dirty, like cheesecake piece. Yuck! Secondly, we ordered our food and by a huge MISFORTUNE I found a hair in my mash potato. Yuck! My brother ordered Shrimp scampi plus steak. They brought the wrong food( a Salmon)  for him and afterwards our server apologized she changed his food but with only the steak on the plate and she said the shrimp is coming up! And she brought the shrimp almost when my brother finished his steak! Anyway, the manger came over by our table and apologized for the hair in my food, however they still set us a bill, minus my food! Our experience was horrible and I'm not sure if I ever come back to this place."
Anton N.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",22,128,92,5.0,2/3/2014,"My girlfriend and I came here at about 11:10 am. The staff was very friendly and visited our table every 10 mins. Since its not that busy we got our food within minutes as well. I ordered the fettucini alfredo pasta with parmesan chicken. It was the best pasta by far! Since it was launch the prices were extremely cheap, the total for the check came out to $28. The seatings are nice and cozy!"
Rob S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",10,54,1,4.0,2/9/2014,"Wonderful server and hostess, a party of four at lunch time. The waitress was super diligent, yet when we were talking she was gone. The food was prepared well, listen for what it is a chain restaurant in a mall overall it was pretty good."
Stef S.,"New York, NY",123,724,4,4.0,12/5/2009,"I like cheesecake factory. Good food and good service. I love the whole wheat/rye (?) dinner rolls they bring out. Unfortunately, as a health nut, I sometimes find the food too rich (salty!! greasy!!) and the drinks and cheesecakes too sweet (mmm strawberry lemonade is perfect if you cut it in half and add water to it). But I do love being able to read the nutritional values now.  My favorites? Boston House salad (appetizer size is plenty) Chicken Madeira Crusted Chicken Romano Louisiana styled pasta Farfalle with peas  Personally, the cheesecakes for which they are famous aren't good. I prefer new york style.... a bit cheesier and denser. Theirs are just too sweet and overwhelming, and I can only have two bites. Although... I do like the new Stefanie's red velvet cheesecake. Nice balance of moist cake and cheesecake."
Mar L.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,66,100,3.0,7/3/2011,This place would have gotten a two-star rating if not for the quick save by a very attentive waiter. Came here with a party of 3 on a Saturday evening around 9:30PM. Waited for about 15 minutes for a table. The hostess called us and led us to our table - which sits only 2??? Isn't she paying attention? We pointed out her error that there were 3 of us. We were found a table that seats all of us but I asked if it was possible if we could have a booth instead. There were several open booth but instead she said that we would have to go back to the front desk and ask the lady if we could switch table. Huh??? Luckily a waiter passing by intervened and said that yes they could seat us in a booth (which was just right across our table). He was our waiter for the rest of the evening and he made our dining experience much more pleasant. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs without being overbearing. I had the porkchop with spinach & mash potatoes. My gf had her alfredo chicken fettucine and her daughter had the miso salmon. All were cooked to our liking. A pleasant dinner experience all thanks to that waiter.
Stacy W.,"Canoga Park, CA",10,82,8,4.0,10/24/2013,The avocado egg rolls are delicious! Try and you'll want them every time you go!
Patty G.,"WINNETKA, CA",86,233,28,5.0,1/30/2014,Oh how I miss the canoga location so much more!!! But I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. Avacado egg rolls and the calamari are so good!! And I find myself always ordering a peach Bellini and some pasta do Vinci!! And has anyone tried the s'mores cheesecake yet?!? It is sooooo delicious!!!
Cassie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,44,166,4.0,1/29/2014,Love the new place. Service is great. Food is awesome! Parking is difficult.  Valet is $7 a bit pricy if you ask me. Expect to have to park far away.
Jamie B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",77,101,45,4.0,12/24/2013,"Went about a week ago. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it took about 40min for me to get a seat at the bar and I arrived at about 445p and the whole bar area is not open seating. But once I got seated it was fantastic which I expect no less from The CheeseCake Factory. I never get bad service or bad food from here. my entree is normally the Cajun Pasta with shrimp and chicken. Always delicious! This is a newer location which I wasn't aware of since I went to the old location and sat there for a minute looking stupid not realizing they had moved. I'm new to California so I go by my trusty Google Map app which didn't give me the new location at that time. but oh well, once I DID find it, I was happy as a lark! lol. :))"
Gina K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",628,59,18,5.0,1/25/2014,This place is always on point with the food and drinks. I was so lucky to live next door to them when they were on canoga. I love the happy hour deals. Love it!
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,4.0,2/12/2014,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory: great food, great service and long wait times on a weekend night. Still, it's worth the wait. Been come here for a few decades and never had a poor experience, never got my order wrong and never had bad service. Everything is done right here."
Tiffany M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,37,2,3.0,4/6/2014,"To start this location is too small. You are sitting with the people next to you and the serves have to squeeze and shuffle in between tables to get to you.  As for the check in. You get a text when your table is ready. But don't be fooled you will wait another 15 mins at least, before being seated. Their logic? People may be walking around the mall and they give a heads up to come back to the restaurant. Los toros sends a text too much you are seated immediately as it should be done.  I think we need more hosts and servers because waiting to be seated for and 15 mins to even get a drink order in is a little over the top"
Sam L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",801,758,1668,2.0,12/5/2011,"Eh... every time I've been here... I've hated it. hahaha. In all honesty, maybe this place is good for ""cheesecake""... but since I hate cheesecake... there really is no reason for me to come here... unless I'm dragged along. I've been told that makes me ""not a woman""... but I don't know. I just really dislike cheesecake.  The few times I've been here... the service was extremely slow...and they always managed to mess up on someone's order.... so not fun. It's terrible to have to wait an extra 15 minutes for them to recook/remake your food.. while everyone else is enjoying theirs. I've heard the steak here is good... but I'm not a steak eater... so I wouldn't know. Everything that I always have... ehhh.. I'm less than impressed. If you sit at the back of the restaurant, there is a courtyard (probably for the neighboring buildings) with a tennis court (I think) that somehow intrigues me. hahaha. I have no idea why... but I'll always be staring out the window at this sunken-in concrete space."
Amanda Y.,"Woodland Hills, CA",182,7,,4.0,4/4/2014,"Always a good stand by.  I remember going to the Warner Center location years ago.  It always was great.  So happy to see the new location in the Topanga Plaza.  I had family in from out of town and looking for something in between Chili's and Mastro's.  Cheesecake factory satisfied.  Will continue to come back.  Thanks to Albert, our waiter,  we loved your Robert De Niro impressions!"
Enrique G.,"Los Angeles, CA",241,500,322,4.0,12/4/2011,"Whoa! Why so much hate for this place? We have been going to this location for years and have celebrated almost every occasion, from business meetings to birthdays, the service has always been spectacular. Yeah I know what you are thinking, this is the Cheesecake factory, the place where all the kids come. But one thing that is unique from the other locations is its great customer service. The wait staff has always been very attentive of our requests and the orders are prompt.  I admit the food isn't one of the best, who would want to pay $10 burger when they could go down the street for half the price. But does that place have the best lemonade in town or various types of cheesecakes. Never have I been disappointed on the choice of cheesecake. You can easily find parking in the back, just remember to validate it inside. I cannot say this is the best food in the world but it is allot better than whats around the area. Great service, delicious desserts, and savory lemonade drinks, come here."
p d.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",91,54,,2.0,1/14/2014,First ordered the salmon rolls ... So greasy my napkin looked like a jiffy lube rag. Spagetti meat Sauce pasta too aldante and sooo salty
Inge I.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",11,40,56,1.0,8/1/2013,Worst exp ever  started with valet we parked by the other business guy came up to us an told us to move our car or to valet it. We walked in the host ignored me for about 5 min there was no one else there and I was standing right in front of him did not apologize or any thing walked us to out table and the table was not ready no plates or any thin except for the customers befor us bill we finally got some plates and silver ware and the waiter introduced him self very nice but sweaty very sweaty  he was rushing to take our order I told him to give me a min so he gave me 15 min  I noticed that my silver ware was dirty with cheese cake or something on it made the waiter know he simply smiled and that's it we ordered our food and we got it after 30 min food was cold bland and my penne was hard like it haven't been cooked right while I was eating there was a fly buzzing around me soo gross I told the waiter he told me it came from out side !! Well duh !!! We paid for our food that was 72 bucks totally not worth it we went to the cake counter to get some cheese cake Again I was being ignored this time for ten min and there was 3 employees not doing a damn thing I ordered and waited some more finally they gave me my slices walked out looked in my bag there was only one slice I paid for two went back to let the retard at the counter know she didn't say sorry she said oh I forgot here is ur other slice ... Btw the slices I got was not worth 7.50 they are so small not worth the money .. Over all this place needs to invest into some  employee training grooming and appearance .. Not worth the money I spent  lack of service rude unprofessional and over priced worst exp I had so far !!
Narek Z.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",19,32,,5.0,2/25/2014,This is why I love this place. The food is great and the prices are more than reasonable. The environment is perfect if you want to go out with friends and enjoy a night at a restaurant. My friends and I love to go here because of the great environment and great food. I recommend either the herb crusted salmon or the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp (not a fan of chicken at all). And for an appetizer you cant go wrong with guac and chips.
Grady G.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,127,53,4.0,2/19/2014,"Chicken, Biscuits and gravy. Really surprised how good it was. One very large biscuit served with two chicken breasts and mashed potatoes and gravy with veggies."
