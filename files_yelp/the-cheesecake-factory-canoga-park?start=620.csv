Raymond B.,"Calabasas, CA",15,42,4,5.0,12/29/2011,"Simply a great place to go for everything Great food, good drinks, and excellent service. Save your time and don't worry about the negative reviews, they must of been drunk when they wrote."
Shireen M.,"Calabasas, CA",75,13,1,1.0,3/16/2015,"I had just about the worst experience when I went to cheese cake tonight... I have my awful waitress liliya. I'm not a very mean person , I understand when people have a lot of tables ... But this time was AWFUL. She brought out bread and my friend and I had to wait , what seemed like forever for our drink order. When she brought our drinks another co worker thought it was ok to talk to her so they could just stand in front of us... With our drinks in our hands waiting un comfortably for our drinks... We finally get our food and my friend asked a runner for ketchup (he never brought it... Again that's ok I get it) but when we flagged down the waitress to ask for some ketchup she didn't bring it out until my friend finished her burger (which wasn't touched the first time she asked for it)... She kept forgetting to bring our refills and would take so many cups at once .. Against her sweat ridden clothes... I asked for my food to be boxed .. After she brought the check FINALLY ..She brings back a box ... No bag. And I saw her box some one else's food. My friend and I felt so ignored. If she can't handle her tables ... Have people help. It just was a very un pleasant dinner.. Just awful."
Rebecca B.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2,19,,3.0,3/16/2014,I've never been a fan of cheesecakes enormous portions and extremely heavy dishes but sometimes I have no better choice and come here with my family. I don't know why they moved to the mall! And I don't particularly care to sit in the mall next to the SEARS entrance while I'm eating dinner! Apparently this is the only spot they can accommodate people with strollers. Regardless. Bad idea moving to the mall!

Antho L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2528,1028,4472,2.0,1/11/2009,"What is going on with Cheesecake Factory these days?    I used to like eating here because of the variety of dishes they served along with the nice large sized portions.  The quality has deteriorated since a few years ago. Today, I came here for lunch and to watch the Giants play the Eagles in the bar area after church service. My buddy and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad to split.  Now I used to order this plate all the time and it used to be HUGE!  They used to serve a large  mound of salad that I could never finish in one setting even sharing it.  Now, that's all changed.  We specifically ordered the dinner size and not the lunch size but what we got seemed something closer to a lunch size as it seemed unusually small. They also used to add these thicker cuts of tortilla strips but have changed it to these tortilla chip strings which tasted stale on our salad.  There was also very little chicken in the salad like there used to be. The bread we were served was stale and the butter was also so hard that it was difficult to spread over the bread. Also, our waiter was constantly going over to talk to a female diner at the next table.  We even had to flag him down for the check even after he had taken away our dirty dishes and asked us if we wanted dessert to which we declined.  He then brought back our change with the coinage part missing.  That was pretty presumptuous to not give us our full change back.  It was only 39 cents, but who does that? If they're trying to increase their bottom line, they FAIL!  Although, it could just be this particular location has a problem and skimps on salads since it's happened 3 times now.   Come on Cheesecake, get your act together!  Don't think I'll go out of the way to return back here."
Michal O.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/29/2014,Always consistent with great quality of food and generous portions.  Great service. Who can ask for anything more?
Joel S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,154,7,1.0,8/27/2014,"1 star for this visit.  Which by the looks of recent reviews is about on track with a lot of others.  We went in around 5ish and it wasn't busy AT ALL. We were sweated right away and ordered a salad as an appetizer.  Boy it took forever to come out.  At least 15-20 minutes, and to make it worse, it didn't come until 2 minutes before the entree, which defeated the purpose of ordering it. As for the entree, I ordered a steak, medium well. It came well done. We didn't see our waiter in any reasonable amount of time to even give me a chance to let him know it wasn't cooked properly, so I chose to eat it instead of having to wait even longer for a new order to come out.  We actually didn't see our waiter again after he first brought us the food, until we were done eating. That's when he chose to come by and see ""how everything was"". My drink glass sat empty for half my meal and he never did offer a refill. This is the second time in 3 visits I've experienced this type of service at a local Cheesecake Factory. Food cooked wrong, long wait to get food, poor waiter service. This was sub par food and even worse service.  Dunno if I've just had a string of bad luck at Cheesecake Factory, or if the quality of employees has diminished.  Either way, I leave disappointed, again.  Doubt I'll be returning to this location again."
Ben S.,"Flagstaff, AZ",72,111,91,3.0,12/19/2011,"Big portions, decent value for money.  Rather loud. Be aware they don't validate the valet parking. Great cheesecake, friendly service, the chop salad was delicious, the Ahi salad was surprisingly spicey - they roll it in Wasabi.  You might not want to look at the nutritional info before you order. 1880 calories for Chicken Piccata? Wow."
Kash K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",9,100,6,3.0,9/29/2013,Upscale Denny's with a large menu and nicer ambiance. Been here about 15 times but not at all in the last 2 years but I guess because I have a better understanding of good food. This place is OK and sometimes good but overall like a 6 or 7 out of 10.
Genaro C.,"Winnetka, CA",0,29,1,5.0,3/23/2015,great food good service we went yesterday for dinner . and ordered the sausage goat chz flat bread. . grilled steak farfalle w/ chicken and the corn sacatash everthing was delicious dulce de leche carmel was good we definitely  will come back
Mark G.,"Simi Valley, CA",6,8,1,1.0,3/23/2014,"Service was terribly inattentive. We were seated outside of the restaurant in the mall area. There was nobody to refill beverages or check on us. We waited an inordinate amount of time for simple salads and sandwiches. Our order came out all wrong and the hot items were cold. We had to ask for a manager several times before one came to discuss our concerns. The manager was not equipped to accommodate the situation and our hour and a half fiasco was an extreme waste of time and money. Will not return! Since the location has moved from Warner Center, it has gone way down hill."
Samantha Q.,"Winnetka, CA",197,149,4,4.0,12/30/2010,New Year's Eve'ish lunch provided by work. A very nice gesture to ring in the new year.  I'm not sure what I got by looking at it. I recognized the staples like the delectable mashed potato's. Made with red skinned potatoes that were very nice and flavorful. There was also a large and fluffy biscuit that was nice and light. The only thing I couldn't name was the actual main course. It was like someone gutted a chicken pot pie. VIOLENTLY gutted a chicken pit pie. I'm not saying it was bad at all but the presentation left much to be desired.  The one thing that I would have loved to try was one of their many cheesecakes. It's crazy that I've eaten here an number of times and yet I've still never had any cheesecake... It's ironic.
David V.,"Huntington Park, CA",104,20,4,4.0,2/15/2011,"Last night I went to the Cheesecake Factory with my GF for valentines day. She was craving :P anyways first off let me talk about the service. I want to say it was good, but not great. When we first got there, and I got my pager to be called, they told me it would be about a 20 minute wait. to my surprise the pager went off in about 2 minutes, as we were looking for a place to sit at the bar. I figured something mustve opened up quick. I went to the front desk, and they took my pager, and then started calling out someones name, that wasnt mine. Luckily the manager was there and hashed it all out. He apologized, and gave us a new pager, and said that theyd try to get is in faster. Good customer service on his part. We sat at the bar, and bought a couple of drinks, and I have to say the Pomegranate Mojito is REALLY great, although if your a fan of the original Mojito, you might not like this one, because its much sweeter then any regular mojito.  We got to our table in about 20 minutes...so much for being seated faster, but at least it wasnt longer than that, and thankfully the pager snafu, didnt cause them to forget about us alltogether. We got to our table and were given our menus be the hostess, however, we werent tended to, until about 5 minutes later (i believe it was 5 but it felt a bit longer actually), by a waitress. She said ""hi im so and so, ill be helping so and so."" Unfortunately, no one else had tended to us prior to her, showing up, so I was a bit taken aback when she said shed be helping another person which i assumed we should have known about...and all i could say was... ""oook? thanks."" I also noticed most of the tables had bread as a starter. When the waitress first came up to us, she did not offer us any, until the second time she came back. That was also the time at which she took our order. I believe the amount of time between her first visit when she introduced herself and her second, was roughly 10 minutes. Thankfully, though, she was very knowledgable about the dishes, and offered her opinion, and we were also served very quickly. At the end of the night, she offered to box up our leftovers, and graciously asked us if we required validation for the parking. Not knowing, that validation was necessary or available here at their establishment, her suggestion was a nice surprise, in our favor of course, since we did not have to pay for parking :) All in all service was very good, but could be better, thats why i give them 4 stars and not 5. Drinks are top notch, and food is great."
Jessica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,211,82,3.0,8/22/2011,"I don't know what it is about this location, but the food is never all that nom nom nom. My noodles always tend to be on the mushier side and it's always a bit more bland than what I'm anticipating. Chicken pasta with sun dried tomatoes: 2 parts I expect: creamy sauce with hunks of sun dried tomatoes, juicy chicken and tons of cheese and garlicy nom nom nomness, with forkfuls of delicious al dente pasta that just absorbs all of that deliciousness!!! What I get: not enough sauce and mushy pasta. Bistro Shrimp Pasta: the sauce had just a tad too much lemon for me. I've had lemon cream sauces before and normally I LOVE THEM, but this one not so much. The tomatoes and spinach (I think) added a nice brightness to the dish in contrast with the heavy sauce. I didn't like the shrimp that much because it wasn't crispy enough for me. The shrimp was fried, but it came out rather mushy looking. The sauce made it mushy obviously, but if its made fresh it should still retain a bit of crunchy at the beginning.  *** I also wish that I had room for cheesecake in the end. :( but I always get too full. sigh."
Rebecca D.,"Chatsworth, CA",3,7,,5.0,9/9/2014,"Love this place! The cheesecake is amazing of course and the chicken enchiladas are to die for! My waiter eric, was also a sweetheart."
Aaron O.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,11,9,4.0,1/4/2014,"I came here for lunch and I was surprised that there was not a hour long line like in the evenings , I had the skinny burger with asparagus it was very good  and it wasn't to small or too large , the waiter was very nice and accommodating . My husband had the fresh veggie salad with grilled salmon which he absolutely loved off the skinny menue also , this time was very different than the last experience we had where the host and server were rude so with that being said I'm glad I had a better experience and enjoyed my food ."
Nick D.,"NORTH HILLS, CA",2,20,7,5.0,11/12/2013,Always a pleasure to eat at the factory. Fresh food and nice service. I always order for pick up from this location because my school is around the corner. There togo service is always on point would recommend them any day.
Jackie L.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",2,20,,5.0,11/7/2013,"The new Cheesecake Factory at Westfield Topanga mall is by far one of the best!! They have a nice decor inside and out, it is  conveniently located near all the shops in the mall  so you can walk around while waiting for a table, great food great service"
Ashley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,31,2,4.0,8/9/2011,"I have been here several times, usually when it's not busy. The service is always great. Ask for the singing waiter -- I believe his name is Jordan? The food is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. The night bartender makes great drinks; the daytime bartender makes weaker drinks, but still good. I much prefer this location over the Sherman Oaks one. Plus, even during prime hours, it is not nearly as crowded."
Yessi G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,5,2,5.0,2/11/2013,EVERYTHING was delicious! Asian pear martini was strong AND good! the crab artichoke dip tasted like In-N-Out spread... I recommend the Hibachi steak!!
