Sara T.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/18/2015,Highly recommend the chicken bellagio! The chicken is grilled to perfection and I can't get enough of the peach icetea! I just keep coming back
Chanden M.,"Cupertino, CA",114,38,23,4.0,8/2/2011,"I ate here on my last day from a week long business trip.  I loved that it was right next to my hotel the Hilton (remember, I said that I loved that it was next to it and not that I loved the hotel... but that's for a different review). I walked in at the prime lunch hour (around 12:15ish) and was seated within 2 minutes but I guess it helps that I was dining solo.   I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad - oh yum!!  The staff was attentive and pleasant.  The lunch portion was still very large and I couldn't finish it even though I wanted to."
Debra M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,5,2,1.0,3/4/2014,One  brought our dad for dinner for his birthday . Waited 50 min to get our food . I waited 10 min for my beer . Our waitress never came by to see if we needed a refill . I finally complained to the manager . He gave us 15.00 discount on our bill . But the server (Whitney ) was horrible .  First time here & it sucked !!!!!
Ben F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",379,239,137,4.0,7/26/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is very good. Huge selection of foods, and cheese cakes! Great for family dinners, dates, or whatever. Good service, great place, although I do not go often."
Mel G.,"Tucson, AZ",131,1891,,3.0,6/25/2011,"I'm usually a pretty big Cheesecake Factory fan, but I think this location gets 3 stars for the so-so service.  I also love the Cheesecake Factory bellinis, and somehow mine had a little buggy in it. :-/  Otherwise, the spaghetti carbonara was good, and the outside patio is nice in great weather."
Jouie J.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",12,66,15,5.0,1/22/2013,"I've been to numerous Cheesecake Factory and they never disappoint whether it is during lunch, dinner, or special events.  I've been to the ones in Las Vegas, NV, Pasadena, CA, and Woodland Hills, CA.  I just love my Lemon Chicken Piccata and personally they make the best one from other places I've experienced.  The service is always great.  The wait is always worth it in my opinion.  So I'm giving them my 5 star rating because even after 15+ years that I've been going here or there; it's always been excellent."
Chantel A.,"Van Nuys, CA",54,14,7,4.0,2/26/2014,"The second location in Woodland Hills, unlike before when you are at the mall you have drive again to go to Canoga Branch now it's very convenient for people who wants their cheesecake fix after shopping... Very classy and neat, servers are very friendly, there's a valet parking too.. Nothing will go wrong for me. I gave it 4 stars!"
John M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,57,,1.0,3/30/2015,"Still the same.  Now they are ripping people off for $10 for Valet Parking & everyone who doesn't has to walk a considerable distance to get there & wait.  Can't figure out the ""draw"" for overpriced food with mediocre service.  Still Not a ""fan"" & probably will never be!!"
Ryan L.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,11,,4.0,3/29/2015,"We stopped by on a busy Saturday night, and there was a line.  We opted for a small table for two in the bar to avoid the wait.  Despite an initial table mix-up......which we were totally at fault for, Jenna made us feel very welcomes and provided us with outstanding service during our entire visit.  Jenna was very knowledgable about the menu and provided us with wonderful recommendations....I loved the tamale ap., the hibachi steak, and the banana cream cheesecake.  All recommendations from Jenna.  She was spot on!!!  I would gladly wait in line for the opportunity to sit in Jenna's section."
Nick L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/5/2013,"This is not a restaurant. It's something else, something much worse. I've had two of the worst experiences I've ever had not just as a restaurant-goer but as a consumer at this place. One: While waiting for our table, we went to the bar section and ordered wine - but it never came, even though we reminded the bar waiter twice. When we were called to our table, the bar waiter actually demanded that we pay our tab! For wine we never got! Then the hostess tried to seat us at a table that another couple was waiting for and the other couple actually pushed us out of the way, sat down and then told us to get away from them while I tried to explain to the hostess that she needed to call the manager. When we went back to the reception area, I explained to a manager there about the indignities we had just suffered. I kept waiting for her to say: ""Sir, OK, let us get you seated and you'll enjoy a dinner on the house tonight."" But nothing. So I let a few years pass before I returned.  Two: When I did, the crowd was so thick and loud in the waiting area we couldn't hear what the host was telling us about the wait times so we left immediately.  Not to mention the completely unsatisfactory parking arrangement: either valet with long wait times for car pick up or go to the garage and walk five minutes from your car to the front of the restaurant, then negotiate the robot pay station on the way back to your car. It's a shame because it used be a completely civilized eating-out experience with great salads, pizzas and cheesecake, now it's just a mess. And I see they're bringing another to the neighborhood! That's not good news: The infection is spreading."
John R.,"Encino, CA",0,11,3,1.0,3/28/2015,"Wow asked for water 3 times in a matter of 15 minutes, and no one came back or brought our water. Got up and left, worst service i've ever experience in the USA."
Cookie W.,"Austin, TX",0,14,,2.0,3/18/2011,"I got there for lunch shortly after they opened.  The eager hostess almost tripped me and said sorry lady, You want a table?  I did just get off a plane from Texas and check into the Hilton but I was sure I was still in America!  As she walked me to my table, she called me lady again and asked me how my day was going...at least she was trying - but someone needs to teach her that referring to a customer as ""lady"" is not polite in most of the US. The food was average - and I am a fan of the Cheesecake factory.  The cheesecake was horrible.  It was old, cold and fresh whipped cream was put on top of day old whipped cream.   My recommendation...don't ever order dessert at lunch time...you will get left over from the night before! Very disappointed.  High point...my waitress Karla was wonderful."
Yuriy S.,"ENCINO, CA",0,9,1,2.0,2/12/2014,"I love cheesecake factory but this one is slow, although there weren't that many people, so I was really surprised. Love their uniforms only if they are clean. It should be checked everyday by management for a simple fact that it makes the rest of us think how clean is this place. Waited for food almost 37 minutes. Unbelievable. Service was very unfriendly. Not happy with this place at all. Sad to say it but I will not let these guys ruin it for other locations."
Ashley G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",2,20,2,5.0,1/8/2015,I come here quite often and never a bad experience. always super yummy. definitely give their chicken Marsala a try! their lunch specials are also really good deals and definitely really good portion sizes. will continue to keep coming back as much as I possibly can!
victor t.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,28,2,4.0,1/1/2014,Had lunch here today after shopping no wait great service good ambiance will return again ..
David R.,"Pearblossom, CA",61,166,249,3.0,6/12/2013,"God, I haven't been here in ages. It's still a casual and classy place to chill. I like this location especially with the tennis court outside and the nice breezy areas to walk around. I went for happy hour so I got off a little easier, but this place can get pricey quickly. It's a good place to impress for a business lunch or a date, but not so much for a quick cheap meal. TCF has a huge menu that has something for everyone and, of course, ridiculously decadent desserts."
Ervin S.,"Castro Valley, CA",105,92,76,3.0,8/2/2013,Used to be better. Food is now definitely not as good as I remember it. Still a place to have a nice meal. Way to busy...
Laura D.,"Northridge, CA",30,47,1,1.0,9/18/2010,"First off, when my boyfriend and I arrived here on a Friday evening, it was too noisy to even enjoy our meal. We opted on take-out since we like to hear each other speak while we share dinner together lol.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala and Gabe had the salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. He complained his fillet was too ""fishy tasting"" for salmon - probably because it was not fresh. He also said his asparagus tips were overcooked and therefore mushy. He even said his potatoes were not thoroughly cooked.  As for the Chicken Marsala - the chicken was rubbery, the sauce tasted like straight up soy sauce, and the bow  tie pasta it was served on was undercooked.  Please read my other reviews and you will note I hardly ever mention cuisine. I only do so if it is bad or a rip off. We felt cheated after this meal...$50 and the best part was the appetizer bread! Cheesecake Factory may have been nice in it's hay day, but it is overpriced for food comparable to that of Chili's.  Oh and parking SUCKS. My boyfriend drives a Dodge 2500 and it was too large to fit in the parking structure so we had to park across the street and down the block. Save your money and go into the city. You'll pay about the same and won't be disappointed like we were."
Michael W.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",13,17,,1.0,12/21/2013,"Two weeks ago we ate at the new Cheesecake Factory at Topanga Plaza.  It was our third disappointing experience there, and this was the worst.  My wife has allergies, and despite telling them specifically about her allergies, they endangered her life by bringing food with the allergens that we had explicitly told them about.  I am a physician, and trust me, we told the waiter.  The service was horrible as well, both slow and ignored.  The noodles in another meal were undercooked.  We couldn't even get our waiter's attention to get what we needed. A meal that should have taken an hour, took two hours.  They comp'd us two desserts, but charged us for everything else.  I posted a complaint on FB, they asked me to send it to customer service , which I did.  That was two weeks ago, and they haven't responded.  The company is headed in the wrong direction."
Janet G.,"Sylmar, CA",2,13,,3.0,10/23/2013,Food and service were good. They serve quite a lot on your plate for the $20+ it costs to eat there. I haven't tried the desserts but overall I was a satisfied customer.
