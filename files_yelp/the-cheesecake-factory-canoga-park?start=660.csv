Jennifer B.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",104,26,6,4.0,7/17/2013,"You really can't go wrong with this place. Lots of yummy selections and of course the cheesecake menu is to die for. I had the Thai lettuce wraps today, one of my favs. I always look forward to having their passion ice tea as well. The best tasting of most restaurants I've been to. Valet parking is super easy and close to the hostess stand and that's something important to me now, because I'm 7.5 months pregnant!"
Vher O.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",23,23,7,5.0,12/5/2013,"Ohhhh this place is heaven for me, from appetizers to desserts and most specially their drinks! Haha. I love this place and im a big fan of their chocolate mousse cake and red velvet cake! Their cake is my stress reliever sometimes, i know its pricey but i dont have a choice but to get a cake from them.. Their very friendly to all the customers!"
Alexis R.,"TARZANA, CA",0,12,,5.0,1/27/2014,I have to say I was a bit hesitant to come here at first because I was so used to the old one in canoga. But their service is great and food better than ever. I love cheesecake!! Great place to go with family or friends and the menu has so many options
Amanda H.,"West Hills, CA",89,201,47,4.0,6/8/2013,"Why do I love coming here, let me count the ways. It could be the three dollar valet. Maybe it's the wonderful cheesecake display. Maybe it's the host/hostess who seem like they belong at a trendy Hollywood restaurant. Or the guy who seated you who had the perfect Zac Efron hair circa High School Musical 2. This is not sarcasm I really do love this place. The waitstaff is always super happy and glad to see you and happy to be working there. The one unnerving thing about the cheesecake factory is the variety of food you have to choose from. Sometimes you need at least a good 15 minutes to find the perfect meal.  Every item, including appetizers, are built for sharing. Remember sharing is caring!  There are so many different items you can order that never fails: factory burrito, Meatloaf, sliders, Chinese chicken salad or a pizza. Don't forget to order cheesecake! I love this place!!!! You cannot fail with the choice of this restaurant as your source from lunch or dinner."
Glenn C.,"Cincinnati, OH",887,887,858,4.0,4/12/2011,Great food!  Always hard to make a decision. I like being able to walk over from the Hilton.  Cheesecake is awesome!
Iza P.,"Atlanta, GA",198,271,398,3.0,5/11/2009,"Saturday night.  Family couldn't decide...so we went to Cheesecake Factory. Sure it was busy....that was to be expected, but first of all, don't buzz us to get seated to only have us to wait 5 more minutes to get seated.   The purpose of the buzz is to let us know that our table is ready, not that we should prepare to be seated. The waitress was really nice, but I guess due to the how busy it was, we were placed in this extra room that perhaps they don't  normally open up, and if they do, it's cause they are packed or it's for private parties.  I really thought I was sitting in some  kind of cafeteria and that we were definitely away from the actual restautant scene. Despite that though, my Shrimp Scampi (my usual for Cheesecake Factory) was good and I even liked how they didn't pile on too much pasta...as I neer really finish it.  Even before the entries, I thought their selection of ""snacks & mini plates"" was excellent. Because we were starving, we had the stuffed mushrooms, crisphy artichoke hearts, and corn fritters to start.  For an average of $5 per mini plate, these dishes were the perfect portion for 4 people and a great price.  Sure beats your usual overpriced appetizers. Because they are definitely a chain, this particular location was ok.  Wouldn't say I'm a fan, because I think I prefer the one in Cambridge Mass the best....however, I have not been there for a while."
Savannah S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,8,,1.0,4/3/2014,"I just got done having lunch there today and while the service was good. They served me raw chicken in my Asian chopped salad. I am beyond grossed out and upset. They took care of the salad on our bill but feel they should've comped the whole meal, it ruined all of it for me. I'm praying I don't get sick. I really hope I don't get sick, not to mention I had a toddler with me that wanted to grab my food. Luckily she didn't get any of my salad. I mean really? Check your meat before sending it out. It's easy and besides it's cut into pieces so how can that be missed. You don't deserve more than one star on this occasion. Yuck yuck!"
Kim A.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",63,21,1,3.0,12/14/2014,"Food & service was amazing! However, I witnessed a manager whose name is Jody curse at & belittle his staff.  What a jerk! No one deserves to be treated like that. Especially in the middle of a crowded dining room."
Fawn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,232,72,4.0,5/21/2013,"what I like about cheesecake factory is that it's pretty consistent no matter what location you go to. Awesome house bread. Order the spicy chicken chipotle pasta or chicken madeira and top it off with a tiramisu cheesecake, linda's fudge cake, or tuxedo cheesecake :-)"
Zan O.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",364,838,204,2.0,9/16/2010,Not worth the value at all.  I believe the place is sold maybe on its beautiful ambiance or decor again. Very expensive for average food.  Definitely a place to take a date and not focus on the food.
Sylvia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,14,7,5.0,6/11/2013,"I went tonight for my daughters graduation from Canoga *woot woot* We need a pretty lager party and sat on the patio Kate was our server. Kate was amazing, very attentive and welcoming. It was quite busy tonght but Kate was able to keep a great smile on her face. She was working very hard and I truely appertciate the sever we were given. I love dinning in with my family and well definatly be requesting her everytime we come in from now on."
nicole r.,"Granada Hills, CA",124,101,16,3.0,3/10/2011,"Walking in we were greeted, and escorted through a seamingly semi-empty restraunt where the hostess tried to seat my father and I at table/booth the size of fish tank. While surrounded by dozens of empty tables. When asked to be seated somewhere else the hostess awkwardly looked around and said ""uuuuuuuuuh, sure okay"".... Sat us a more comfortable table and walked away.  Our waitress came by a couple minutes later to take our drink order, which she did and then quickly walked away. Our drinks took a while to come and when she put them down it was if she was about to run away again, while both me and my dad had questions/were ready to order. I had to ask for a dish recommendation because  trying to read the entire 20 something page menu is dizzying.  She told me to get the lemon herb chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots. Okay.  So again she scurries away we sat for about 20 minutes or so before the food came or before anyone came to check on us at all for that matter. :( And once the food did arrive we were again not visited until we had to ask for the check.  Suffice the O.K. service the food is always good. Not OMNOMNOMNOMNOM SO DELICIOUS GUNNA DIE OF DELICIOUS OVERDOSE!!!!!!! but good, stick to your ribs (and your gut) food. I like that the portions are gigantic, not because I feel like it justifies paying 20$ for a 10$ meal but because for 20$ you get to eat for 3 days!!!! Or you can share plates with friends, which I like the most. Yum.  Being inside of this cheesecake factory makes me feel like I'm on  a bad date-business meeting. I feel like the insides are all outdated and weird looking. There are murals all over the place that would appeal to middle-aged cat ladies. Just weird. It was not comforting and relaxing.  Basically, if the food weren't consistently tasty and the free bread wasn't as warm and delicious, this place would most definitely have only 2 stars. :("
Janelle F.,"West Hills, CA",3,3,,3.0,11/17/2014,"This location is super busy and populated, not a fan ... Service took way to long as well"
Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121,5.0,3/23/2011,My favorite place in the entire world. Wow. Everything is delicious. Generous portions. I have eaten here for more then a dozen years and every experience has been great. Always my request for my birthday dinner.
Sharon L.,"Calabasas, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/1/2014,"Have eaten here several times.  Tonight however will be the last!  Was in the bar for happy hour. Put some of my corn tamale in my mouth, bit down, and spit out a white plastic tab, the kind you use to close a bread bag! So disgusted!  Luckily I didn't swallow it and choke on it!  The reaction of Joe, the manager, was so unsatisfactory!  Told me he'd take off my tamale, and I told him I wouldn't pay for any of my appetizers and drinks - a total of $25.00!  I was very annoyed! After telling me not to be belligerent if that would make me happy fine, but we had to pay for our drinks!  Told him he could call security because we were leaving and I wasn't paying for those either!  We did tip the bartender $10.00 - it wasn't her fault."
Ana S.,"Pickering, Canada",1,27,,4.0,9/14/2013,"I was staying at the Hilton a few steps away so it was extra convenient for me. I went twice in the 5 days I stayed in the hotel. First day was Sunday at around 2pm no wait time. Had on ok server. Ordered the fish taco & it was just ok. It had 4 tacos, rice & beans so too full to have a slice of cheesecake.  Second time was at 7:30 on a Tuesday night again a 5 minute wait only for a table for 4. Great server named Brad suggested the Mai tais for drinks & they were delish! I ordered the fried zucchini & pretzel chicken from the appetizer menu to make sure I had space for a slice of red velvet cheesecake. Fried zucchini was also delicious but the pretzel chicken was a bit over cooked. The red velvet cheesecake was as delicious as everyone says! Washrooms do need cleaning!! No toilet paper in 3 out of 4 stalls & took a while for hostess to bring some when asked. Bring your own toilet paper!!!"
Ray M.,"WEST HILLS, CA",1,11,1,5.0,11/17/2013,"Recently me & my family went to the cheesecake factory on Canoga Park for my wifes' birthday. As we love their special bread &oil mixed vinegar we keep asking to refill , the waitress bring it several times with a smile on his face. We had  two meals, Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Tostado Chicken Salad that they make it the best & portion was large enough for 3 of us. Try the Vinaigrette dressing. It is simply amazing and you can put it on anything."
Brandon K.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",197,17,3,5.0,5/1/2013,"My girlfriend took me here to celebrate my acceptance letter into nursing school. We were helped by an extremely polite and attentive waiter named Reggie. The food was amazing, I ordered the Kobe beef burger and my girlfriend ordered the 4 cheese pasta. The ultimate margarita wasn't watered down, Thank god!! this is usually such an issue when I go out."
Andrew N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,11,,3.0,12/19/2013,"The food was as good as any other Cheesecake factory visit. The only thing I'm upset about is their change of location. I loved the old spot on Canoga Ave because of the amazing atmosphere it gave off. I'm aware they probably want to be more central due to the upcoming outdoor mall expansion that Westfield is bringing on, but I still much prefer the old location! Sitting inside this new one places you  essentially in the gaze of shoppers in the mall and it kills the mood some times."
