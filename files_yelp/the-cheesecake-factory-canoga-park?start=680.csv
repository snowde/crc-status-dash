Ryan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,14,2,1.0,12/21/2014,"Word of advice to servers, if you are a smoker, please be aware that when you return from your smoke break to serve your tables, smelling like smoke is not what your customers want to experience. Disgusting!!! Oh yeah, also if the food is burned, the food runners should not take it to the table that way.  Use common sense!!!"
a t.,"Northridge, CA",0,9,2,2.0,11/29/2013,"Super SLOW, and terrible customer service. No acknowledgment. Food is great!! Very consistent food same as all the Cheesecake Factory sites. This location has bad service and is very slow. Management does not care either."
Tara B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,79,9,4.0,3/5/2013,Ended up here after BJs was too busy! Super busy but still got great service! Food was yummy n so were the drinks!!
Toni M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,3,,5.0,11/19/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory happens to be one of my top favorites. No matter the occasion it never fails. To me, The Cheesecake Factory is the place to be! Ive been to a few different locations and never was I impressed with my visit the way I was while at the Canoga Park location. Customer service was great. Food was great. All in all there were no complaints. Beautiful relaxing area."
Elfreda D.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,,5.0,8/19/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The parking is convenient and the Cheesecake Factory Validates. I have tried so many things on the menu and I love it all. My favorite is the Bistro Shrimp pasta, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and the Avocado Egg Roles. One thing that I can say about this restaurant is that the quality of the food is always excellent. The Cheesecake Factory does not skimp on ingredients or portions.  I always know what to expect when I go.  The service is always good. A lot of the time there is a wait, but the time goes by pretty quickly."
Mahnoosh D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,15,,5.0,8/17/2013,This is a wonderful family restaurant that I've been going to for many years. Two things you must try: 1) chicken Madeira 2) strawberry lemonade.
Gaby S.,"Canoga Park, CA",770,126,128,5.0,12/3/2012,had breakfast with my mother and had chillaquilles and carnitas platter with eggs. This was the best plate ever!!! Orange juice was fresh. Service was 10 Star
Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",126,57,25,1.0,3/29/2010,"Run.  Retreated from the patio to the bar in an effort to escape the families-with-screaming-kids ambiance and hello horrible service.  H O R R I B L E. How and why since we were nearly the only table, I have no clue... Food wasn't anything worth eating again."
Expedito N.,"Van Nuys, CA",8,15,,1.0,5/6/2014,"i went there for lunch. normally i dont clean my plates and i saw my friend cleaning his plate with his table napkin and lo and behold it was dirty. i did the same and it was also dusty. if we didnt wipe the plate with the table napkin you would assume it is cleaned because it look cleaned. i ask for the manager in charge and he is probably over 50 years old and the first thing he said was being defensive. rather than apologize, he was making excuses. when he sensed i was mad then he offered  me dessert. i told the manager i am not interested in his dessert and i want him to make sure plates are served clean to all customers. this place needs to be worked upon."
Michael T.,"Agoura Hills, CA",2,41,,2.0,11/26/2014,"Brr. Which was colder, the restaurant or the manager? Dined for the first - and possibly the last - time at the new Cheesecake Factory in the Topanga Mall. I was very surprised at how large the restaurant was, especially since we were seated at the faaaar end of the restaurant. While the food was ok, the real disappointment was the air conditioning. The temperature was uncomfortably cold. We complained to our server, who said that there was nothing that could be done; all of the tables in the back part of the restaurant are always cold. At the end of our meal, we asked to speak with the manager. We told him about the cold air and he was very defensive, bordering on rude. He basically said that there was nothing that CF could - or would - do to remedy the situation. TheAccording to the manager, the fact that the restaurant is open to the mall apparently makes it impossible to maintain a comfortable environment. His attitude was, you don't like it, don't come back! Great idea."
Jimmy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",182,223,1,1.0,5/22/2014,This is the second time I came to this location after their move. I must say I am not a fan at all as their wait times are outrageous.  Who wants to wait 2hrs to sit down? They didnt plan well when they moved and its gone downhill. Try CPK inside the mall its much better.
Laura R.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",16,322,24,5.0,9/9/2012,"I love Cheesecake factor! My favorite meal here is the chicken piccata! Also, their Kobe beef burger is outstanding. I am not a real big sweet eater, but I always get a peice of cheesecake to go! I haven't found one that I don't like."
Ragenvald G.,"Dublin, CA",12,83,48,4.0,9/10/2012,Mango key lime cheesecake. Nom nom nom. Food aside this particular location has some of the best most personable staff of any cheesecake factory I have been to. I am referring to the staff in the bar area as that is the area I tend to eat in most often.
Grace M.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,6,,1.0,8/9/2014,"I had pretty high expectations for this place (since everyone raves about it) and I  was verryyyyyyyy disappointed!! The food, excuse my language, SUCKS!! $60 gone down the toilet! The food may look good but it has no flavor at all! So bland and tasteless that I could have made a better plate of mashed potatoes myself! Ugh don't give in to the hype. This place is lousy. Better to take your money somewhere else."
Roberta O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,3.0,9/5/2014,"Pretty good food, but not so good service.  As you could imagine, the place is packed, but it seems that they are low on employees to serve tables..etc. we got a burnt steak when we asked for medium and it took forever to rectify our dinner plans after they burned our food.  ok place..just needs more workers."
Fanny V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/14/2014,Really good customer service and yummiest food ever! This is by far the best Cheesecake Factory!!!
Jeff L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",40,235,,4.0,2/23/2012,"Went there on a Tuesday night with 7 guests. The waiter Daniel was fantastic and the food was good. I had the Thai Lettuce Wraps, (yep it's diet time) which were good except such a small portion of chicken. My son ordered the sirloin steak it was actually kind of hard to chew but we didn't complain and he finished it. Other dishes were the Chicken Romano (excellent) Santa Fe Salad (excellent), Steak Diane (excellent) and a kids meal. For dessert the Hershey's Cheesecake and the Caramel Apple all got rave reviews. Thoroughly enjoyed it and the service was top notch. The birthday girl got a little sundae and the cheesecake plate had Happy Birthday written on it. Will be back as often as I can."
Alex M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/23/2014,"We had family in town and ate there a few weeks ago. The service was horrible, the place was extremely noisy, and we had tow wait almost 90 minutes to be seated, despite being told we would have to wait 30-45 minutes when we arrived and checked in. The food was also not what we are used to. The old location was doing a much better job at keeping wait periods to a minimum and providing great service to patrons. We have since switched to the Sherman Oaks location which usually offers less wait and much better service."
Mindi C.,"Porter Ranch, CA",4,11,,1.0,8/23/2014,"so awful we left before ordering. Rude staff, filthy flatware and sitting smack in the mall right outside of Sears.  We had eaten at the prior location several times and loved it - this location is horrible.  There was actually green food fleck and a grain of rice stuck to the flatware at our table.  Crumbs all underneath and some on the table.  Waiter was rude and ""dealt"" drink napkins at us across the table with an attitude.  My first tip should've been when I called to ask about the location and if it was busy and the reception was rude and curt. Won't be back, might try the Sherman Oaks location. Stay away from this one."
Ronald R.,"West Covina, CA",326,175,551,5.0,6/18/2012,"You honestly can't go wrong with cheesecake factory. Everything is delicious! I love the fried mac and cheese balls, so damn good! But main reason I'm writing a review and giving five stars is for the customer service. I went on Father's day and I had already expected to wait a good hour or so but we were seated within five. Our waiter who I wish I can remember his name, was excellent. So nice and friendly. I had a headache and asked without really expecting him to have aspirin and he got it for, was so nice and he went out of his way."
