Geena S.,"West Hills, CA",4,56,5,3.0,9/22/2010,"Chain restaurant. Been there for who knows how long.  The white and brown bread which is complementary when you are seated are very good, in particular though, THE BROWN BREAD! Especially when warm! Mmm mm mmmm!  The iced mango drink! 10/10! Definitely try it! Cool and refreshing! Probably made from mango syrup during the winter/fall season but when in season, it is OH SO GOOD!  Dishes, really, I've never had a bad dish at Cheesecake Factory. Everything is pretty good, and the waiters are very helpful in helping you choose and customize dishes according to your preference! They're justtttt good though, wouldn't necessarily come back for the entrees than the desserts.  As far as DESSERTS go! Oh gosh, the new red velvet cheesecake is by far the best cheesecake I've ever tasted! So moist and decadent, actually is on the same level as Sprinkles cupcakes for me! Also, Dulce De Leche cheesecake is divineeee!  I don't really see why people have a problem with this place unless you don't want to go to a restaurant which is sort considered the ""norm"". It's good all around..."
Kelly B.,"Macungie, PA",9,341,7,4.0,9/4/2012,"A chain restaurant. It doesn't really matter where you go, I have yet to find a bad one. Service and food are great (especially the fresh bread prior to the meal). The menu is extensive and they have a bar. The decor is nice and they are always quite clean. There's a parking garage near the hotel behind this particular one. The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet."
Diogenes G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,55,,1.0,8/1/2014,"Sorry, but this place stinks.  First of all its in a mall but you have to enter from the parking lot.  There is no entrance from the interior of the mall.  Great on a 105 degree day.  Second, its claustrophobic.  The tables are very, very small and booth like not allowing for a view of the restaurant itself.  Its like being shoved into a phone booth, (many of you don't know what that is).  Third, the food stinks.  I ordered two different salads on two separate occasions and they both tasted the same.  Chinese chicken salad and spanish something salad.  Both bland.  If you go in as a single the first thing they want to do is put you in the bar.  I told them, ""not the bar please"" and she looked at me like I was robbing the place.       Fourth, its way over priced.  One salad and a soda, plus tip came to almost $25.  Really ?   I want a salad for lunch, I don't want to invest in the chain.     Fifth, the music is too loud.  I asked if they could turn it down so I didn't have to shout to the person I was with.  The waitress said yes but it was never turned down.  I gave up.      Go someplace else and get your money's worth."
Tereza K.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",52,58,22,5.0,1/23/2012,"Why the low star assignement?  Service is always good, food is always good.  I love my neighborhood Cheesecake Factory!"
Steph G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",185,93,28,4.0,8/22/2012,"I didn't used to be a fan of CCF (I know, I should be stoned!), but it's won me over recently. I recently fell in love with their miso salmon lunch special, but really, $1 upcharge to sub 2 1/2 pieces of asparagus for snow peas? Come on, now! That's crazy, it already comes with the herb-crusted salmon (which is gross). Their strawberry martinis are great. Made with fresh strawberries, smooth, and you can get a nice lunch hour buzz from just having one.. takes the edge off of afternoon meetings pretty nicely. :)"
Stephanie C.,"Naples, Italy",32,34,21,5.0,9/22/2011,"I came here with my boyfriend last week for our 1 yr anniversary :) I hadn't been here in a while but the food and service is a good as I remember! I had steak and fries, I ordered my steak med rare and it  was cooked (or should I say uncooked!) to perfection! It also came with 2 huge onion rings that were to die for! My boyfriend ordered the Jamaican chicken and shrimp, sooo good! The rice and beans it came with weren't as good as I'm used to (nothing like moms!) but the plantains were incredible! Overall, it was a nice experiencea! Service was great and our food and drinks arrived surprisingly fast. We ordered our chesecake to go and came home to some delicious and very generous slices! Yum!"
Chel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,21,2,4.0,10/18/2010,So this time we decided to both have completely different items from our typical and we thought it might help to tell you all about it.... He ordered a Mojito and I ordered a Strawberry Margarita...My drink was great but his was to die for...Next time I am definitely having one myself... Also this time he had the Shepherd's Pie and I had the Chicken Marsala...He loved his but honestly mine was not as good as the Chicken Madeira I typically have because I am not into pasta and the sauce was too thin for my tastes... The overall vote is still 4 stars: Mojito -Yes! Strawberry Margarita -Yes! Shepherd's Pie - Yes! Chicken Marsala - Fair!
Mike W.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,66,7,3.0,6/23/2012,"Had a bit of a surreal experience at the Woodland Hills location recently... the fiancee and I hadn't been in a quite a while and figured a visit was due.  Initially we had one waiter who managed to mangle an order for their signature Asian Pear Martini (do you want it blended? Huh?).  20 minutes later our initial incompetent waiter was swapped out for a girl who I swear was staring in my eyes like she was trying to steal my soul.  She came by every 5 minutes to see if we were ready to order after our appetizers were delivered.  I understand turning tables, but for fucks sake!  The manager came by later to apologize about the mangled Asian Pears and comp'ed those from out bill which was a nice touch.  The food was great as usual, but the service experience was bizarre to say the least.  We'll return and hope the moons are aligned better next time."
Phil L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",37,41,3,3.0,5/11/2010,"Pretty much average in most ways. It's a chain restaurant, so I don't expect it to be awesome, but it is decent and there are worse options. Some dishes are quite tasty, even if they'll have you in cardiac arrest after eating them. The Chicken Madiera is one of their popular dishes that I enjoy, although I never understand why they make the mashed potatoes chunky. Does anyone like chunky mashed potatoes? My wife enjoys the shrimp scampi. We don't go often enough to deviate from our ""safe"" dishes, except the last time I went when I had a mad craving for Hawaiian Pizza. Big mistake. Undercooked, cold and soggy. How the heck do you mess up Hawaiian Pizza? Anyway, that'll be the last time I stray from my tried and true dish. Cheesecakes are good if you have a sweet tooth. I prefer mine slightly toned down on the sugar, but my wife and brother really enjoy them so I'd assume most people would like them just the way they are. Like most chain restaurants, service is all over the map. Wait time for dinner is usually pretty ridiculous - like 45-60 minutes. Garage parking in the back is pretty easy and it's free if you get validation. For some reason, the floors are really, really slippery so be careful and maybe think about wearing shoes with tread."
girlie g.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,32,2,1.0,5/10/2015,"Let me make it clear, the food here is always consistently good, however my review is about the inconsistency in policies and service. I came into this location and was told by the reception that the entire bar area was a ""seat yourself"" section. Okay cool, we sit down and immediately a waitress throws us out saying we could not seat ourselves on the low tables in the bar area...okkkaaaay...so we wait no problem I guess it's only bar top or high top tables that are this way...then when I returned I tried to put my name in for those tables in the bar area (so I could take advantage of their happy hour) and AGAIN the reception tells me it's a seat yourself section. I said ""no I fell for that the last time and was kicked out"" and then she walked me over there and sat me insisting it was a seat yourself section and sure enough we got served no problem, cool. Cut to today when I came in and asked the reception if the bar area was available for seat yourself and they said  ""yes it's always seat yourself"". Great! So we head over and sit down, within seconds a rude male waiter comes over and throws us out and shamed us to boot. I said ""sir the reception informed us it was okay and the last time I came it was the policy, has it changed once again?"" And he snipped at me and said "" these tables have never been seat yourself you will have to wait for a reservation if you ever want to sit in this section that's our policy"" and then took off. wow I'm sorry I don't work here and therefor rely on the information i get from the staff on where I can sit and when I can sit and it's always conflicting and inconsistent. Not to mention the waiter did not have to be so rude about it.  I wasn't trying to cheat the line or whatever I was told I could sit here and actually have before. The whole ordeal is upsetting I really think they need to be clear about their policies and make sure all of there staff are on the same page. It makes the customer uncomfortable and there is no need to shame a misinformed customer either!"
Kenneth R.,"Reseda, CA",1,16,,3.0,2/11/2011,"I gotta admit, I'm not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory. The only thing that brings them up from a 2 to a 3 is their hamburgers (Which are worth a 4-5 rating). I've honestly been to the Factory about 10 times in the past 15 years. The first time I actually enjoyed the food I ordered a cheeseburger. It was GREAT.  After that I gave it a couple more tries - I ordered the shepherd's pie which was okay... maybe good, but not really notable. Then the last time I was there I got a cheeseburger with pork belly... again DELICIOUS.  The burgers are by far the best thing on the menu... if they were a bit cheaper and parking and everything was a bit more convenient I would rate this place a 4... but I can't... I do, however, recommend you get a burger if you go. Best thing on the menu."
Evelyn T.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1118,915,518,4.0,7/2/2007,"I'm surprised at the negative reviews for this Cheesecake Factory location. We were in poor spirits when we came to this Cheesecake Factory, but they were definitely uplifted. We tried: Mojito and Green Apple Martini - both excellent - while we waited for our table. It didn't take long to be seated. My Shepherd's Pie was too salty for my taste, but that's probably the way it's supposed to be. Boyfriend liked the meatloaf and sang praises of the Mojito. The bartender certainly knew what he was doing. We had no problems with the service. It was quite good. Of course, we had leftovers for the next day. The cheesecake is so yummy. The parking is with the LA Fitness lot. Remember to validate your ticket."
Jim E.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/18/2015,"Tonight I was having just an OK dinner with my wife. We sat in a TINY booth right by the kitchen that the host insisted we sat in. We ask her if there was any way that we could be seated some where a little more spacious, and not so noisy. She responded ""sure"" seeming kind of annoyed and hurried she walked away and did not return, only to see her hanging out around the host podium a few minutes later. Our waitress was extremely friendly although our food did take quite a while.. for just two salads?? The bbq ranch chicken salad was lacking in onion rings, although I had requested more. A nice young lady offered me more while stating that they were working on a fresh batch at the moment.. does that mean that my onion rings were old?? gross.. anyway I had replaced them with the generous side that she had brought me. As we were leaving I had saw a manager scolding a staff member in front of guests.. unaware of why she was getting whipped into shape, I believed it was a little over the top especially in such a public area. I almost felt bad for her! I do not think I will be returning to this location for a little while. Hosts could use some work.. management too for that matter!"
Jarrod M.,"San Diego, CA",18,43,3,3.0,3/11/2012,"While I really like Cheesecake, I have definitely had better experiences. This particular location is very popular and being located in a corporate area like Warner Center, a lot of professionals frequent this restaurant. Parking is not as convenient as it would be if this were a stand alone location, but that's not really the restaurant's fault. The lobby is enormous, as is the rest of this location. As is the Cheesecake custom, they have the desserts staring at you from behind the brightly lit display cases just as you come in. Getting to your table can be a trek, due to the shear size of this place. They certainly pack the tables close together, which, unless you get a booth, makes you feel as if you are sharing a meal with other diners next to you. I have always found the tables themselves far too small for all the stuff they try to cram on there- silverware, glasses, bread basket, bread plates, etc.  This particular trip was not the greatest due to our lack of a server for the first 10 or so minutes after we sat down. When our server finally did arrive, though, he was pleasant and attentive enough. Our food took a while also, which I can understand due to how busy it was. The food itself is always good and portion sizes are more than adequate. When we were ready for our bill, we had to wait again to see our server for a while. I normally try not to rate too harshly on one element alone, but this time, I just didn't enjoy it as much because of the extremely slow service. It won't keep me from returning, however."
Joseph S.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",1,100,,2.0,8/9/2014,I don't understand the appeal of these chain restaurants that are presented as an elevated dining experience. Not a big fan of the cheesecake. Would rather spend my money and calories elsewhere.
Britni C.,"Canoga Park, CA",4,40,,3.0,4/6/2012,"Cheesecake factory is good but honestly I dont think Id go here unless I had a gift card (which is why we went the last 2 times). We get the nachos there which are okay, nothing special and kinda greasy. For an entree I got a veggie burger which wasgood, im only rating 3 starts because of the high price! I went with a friend last time and it was $55. We got nachos, 2 lemonades, and 2 burgers...$55??? seems a bit high to me for what we got."
Oliver T.,"Lomita, CA",9,9,1,3.0,9/27/2012,"Service was good, but they forgot to bring out our appetizer so we had to cancel it when our entrees came out... food was okay, but nothing to write too much about. Overall, an okay experience, but should've spent our money somewhere else."
Natasha K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,24,,1.0,8/13/2013,"Usually in the past when I have come here it has been pretty good but this last time that I came here with my family it was absolutely ridiculous. First off we came on a saturday night around 4:30 there was about a 10 minute to be seated on the patio, once we got sat it took about 10 mins to get a server to come over and greet us and this server was walking back and forth with her one table that she had ( I should  mention I work in a restaurant and I know the rules of seating and know when servers aren't busy) she came over and wasn't welcoming or anything just asked what we wanted to drink and when we asked if we could order an appetizer through her she gave attitude and said someone else will take care of that ummmm ok? So another 10 MINUTES later we finally got our waters (yes it apparently takes that long to get 3 glasses of water when you have 1 table) and then took about another 10-15 minutes for another server to come by and take our order. The food here is good but because of the crappy service I will never return here again and its a shame because I only live about 5 minutes away but I rather drive the extra 20-30 minutes to get great service and friendly and polite people then deal with servers who roll their eyes and give attitude, absolutely horrible horrible servers."
Ellie P.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/8/2013,"i have been going to the Cheesecake Factory in few different locations. Although this one, in Woodland Hills, USED TO BE GOOD WITH SERVICE AND ALL, THINGS HAVE CHANGED.  when our beeper went off indicating our table for which we waited  45 minutes, was ready,  i was in the bathroom with the baby so i sent my 12 year old to take it and that i would find them in the patio. when i go out there, she is standing there with no beeper, i ask what happened and she said they asked her where her party was and when she said they were coming out of the bathroom, they had her wait and took another family. i understand they are busy, but to not allow 3 minutes to get out of the bathroom, WE HAD TO WAIT ANOTHER 15 MINUTES.  I WAS THERE WITH A TODDLER AND A TWELVE YEAR OLD, WHILE EVERYONE AROUND US GOT WATER RIGHT AWAY ALONG WITH THEIR DRINK OF CHOICE, WE HAD NO WATER FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THE BREAD, COOLING AND BUTTER, MELTING, WHILE  WE AWAIT WATER. THE WAITER'S EXCUSE, ""some families don't want us to bring their babies water"". Hello, ask me!!!!!! and what about me and my 12 year old????? we cannot eat pork and our CHEESE ONLY PIZZA  showed up with pepperoni on it (ALONG WITH THE PRECIOUS WATER) and mind you i had placed the order AS WE SAT DOWN and if you have a toddler, you know why: there is only so much coloring and snacking they can do before they are done and their food has to cool down completely. i take off the pepperonis because i know at this point, waiting for a correction would mean a hungry grumpy baby. we have take two slices off and my waiter comes and i just ask, this was supposed to be cheese remember. He says, ""oh it's probably at the window and i might have taken the wrong one"" he grabs it and leaves. 15 or 20 minutes later, i catch him, Mauricio, that cheese pizza??? ""oh, they are preparing you a new one. HELL NO!!!! FIRST OF ALL, HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THAT ONE AND GOTTEN THE EXTRA  KNOWING THERE WERE KIDS THERE, SECONDLY, WHY DIDN'T YOU COMMUNICATE THAT WITH ME. I HADN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO SIP FROM A DRINK WITH ALL THE UPSET THAT MY TODDLER WAS FEELING THAT HIS FOOD WAS FINALLY GONE.  the mangager comes to say that they were sorry...blahhh blaaaahhh but by the time the food came i had to box it to go because baby had been in the seat so long already and had filled up on bread . when the waiter came with the bill, he tried to say sorry but continued by addign that i had never ASKED FOR WATER.  DONE!!!!!!!! with this place. DONNNNNNEEEE!!!!!"
Gun-cha S.,"West Hills, CA",9,64,39,2.0,9/7/2011,"I had order the hold cheese cake here, bad experience will have get a cake here every again.
