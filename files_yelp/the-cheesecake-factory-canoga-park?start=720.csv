Jay A.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",17,16,1,3.0,7/25/2011,"Food is good, but it really does depends on the time you come to eat.  If it is busy, good luck getting service in a timely manner.  Other than that, I cannot complain."
Christyl J.,"WEST HILLS, CA",60,38,16,5.0,6/10/2012,"I've been going here for a long time, but the most recent was probably my best time.  I went with a friend for a weekend lunch.  The place was packed, but the wait wasn't long, about 5 minutes which was pretty good.  The server was on the ball, very helpful and nice.  The food, which I got their AMAZING Chicken Piccata, was perfect, and this dish is a personal favorite so to say it was perfect is saying a lot.  At one point I had to go to the restroom and another server was kind enough to walk me as I had hurt my hip and was limping a bit and opened the door for me!  The lunch prices were very good as well, especially for the amount of food.  The bread was fresh and wonderful as usual.  The only issue i had was the noise level as it echoes a bit when outside on the patio.  Other than that a wonderful time and can't wait to go back."
Jenn Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,24,,4.0,3/25/2010,"I always come here with my mom, because she loves their chicken tostada salad.  She'd probably give it a five. As for me, the only reason why I give it a 4 not a 3 is because of its decent portions.  Quantity vs. quality. Their honey bread that they serve before they ask for your order is delicious.  Their pastas are pretty good, but are pretty heavy. I tried deviating from the normal pasta option that I usually get and ordered the chicken madeira.  It's one of their signature dishes.  It's chicken breast slightly glazed in cheese that comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus dipped in a teriyaki-like sauce.    You have to order their banana creme cheesecake.  It's pretty light in terms of flavoring, as it is not too sweet nor too bland.  It tastes soo good. As another mentioned before, this restaurant service either a hit or miss.  Usually their service is friendly and good, but one Saturday night their service was horrible.  They forgot our order and made us wait 40 minutes more than the usual. 3.5 rounded up"
Ed K.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",6,49,2,5.0,3/17/2012,"I used to eat at cheesecake factories almost daily few years ago. I have tried all dishes and many of deserts. now after couple of years I came back to this location and its still the same great cheesecake factory as it always used to be. food is great, it is a bit loud, but thats how it always is. if youre looking for quite restaurant this is not it. their coctails are fantastic, food delicious and deserts are phenomenal! and they do validate the parking for 2 hours. (someone in one review said they did not validate, but they do) great place to go and hang out in the evening, watch a basketball games, have a dinner maybe a drink and chill with your spouse with some class ;-)"
Joelle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,55,,4.0,8/11/2009,"I know it's a chain, and I know the wait is sometimes unbearable, and I know their portions are made for some giant of a human, and therefore I'm supposed to despise this place - but I hate to admit it, I'm a huge fan.  The Woodland Hills location seems to be the best of the cheescake factory's in terms of service and wait-time. I honestly have never had to wait longer than 20 mins - big groups and small parties alike. Plus, all the servers really seem to be on top of their game, and I've never had a complaint.  Another reason I love the cheesecake factory - does it get any better in terms of variety? I mean seriously, anything you want to order is on the menu. It can be a bit overwhelming at times, but even the pickiest of eaters can find something here. My surefire bet: The BBQ Chicken salad. It's never led me astray. And, it's so big it's like getting 2 meals in one.  So, I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory haters - I know I'm supposed to despise your big corporation ways, but you're just so delicious and accommodating :)"
Angelina M.,"Glendale, CA",27,35,,3.0,1/26/2012,"I dine here last night with a friend. The service was OK - our waiter seemed a little confused. Instead of red wine, I got white wine, instead of brown rice - white rice (even though we specified brown)... And at the end of the meal he asked us if we wanted to box the left-overs, we said ""yes"", he disappear for 15 min, then came out again and asked the same question. Perhaps he was overwhelmed, because it was a busy night. Food: Avocado rolls - 5 stars! Beets and goad cheese salad would benefit from more beets, there were just a few small cubes... Ahi tuna (I ordered it as a main course, not appetizer) was supposed to be accompanied with wasabi sauce, so I expected it to be a little spicy and flavorful. However, the fish was bland and the amount of sauce, sprinkled around it was so miniscule, that it wasn't enough to add flavor to the dish. My recommendation is - add more sauce or marinade the fish in something that has a taste.  Overall experience - good, but needs improvement."
Nick D.,"Simi Valley, CA",92,30,1,3.0,6/25/2009,"I want what I want when I want it, but...  If a hot piece of ass doesn't want what I want then I compromise.  (I'm a gentleman.  Ha ha...)  The Cheesecake Factory is a practically perfect compromise, with an eclectic menu few find disagreeable. Not 1 but 2 hot pieces of ass and I dined at the restaurant.  And no, not together, but if this keeps up then I could call myself popular.  Ha ha... My 1st hot piece of ass outing...  I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos, remembering that I'd ordered tacos heres on an occasion and I liked them, I liked them a lot.  The tacos and black beans were half way decent but the rice was delicious.  For dessert...  It's The Cheesecake Factory and I'd never tried one of their cheesecakes.  So...  I tried a cheesecake left off of their web site's online menu.  It wasn't rich, it was stinking rick and almost inedible after I'd eaten half of the cake, but I liked the first half of the cake. My 2nd hot piece of ass outing...  I craved a wrap but no dice.  Even on the expansive menu there was no wrap.  I decided on the Blackened Chicken Sandwich.  It was very flavorful, but...  The bottom piece of bread was wet with...  I don't know with what but if it weren't for my hot piece of ass friend I'd have asked for another sandwich.  Lucky server, who was only mediocre.  For dessert...  I tried the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake and it was a good ending for my meal. The Cheesecake Factory is what it is and will never be what it isn't.  It isn't food that makes my mouth water and want more.  It's good food that usually won't disappoint me.  It's ""a-ok""."
Joe J.,"Calabasas, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/27/2014,Horrible Service. Very disrespectful staff! Super slow. They always have an excuse.
Christy S.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,16,,2.0,4/25/2014,"Ever since they moved to Topanga Mall, the staff is rude and not accomidating. I feel more like I'm bothering them by coming then helping them keep their jobs. The food is great! BUt hire people with some customer service skills please!"
Dreamz12 G.,"Marina del Rey, CA",3,106,,3.0,4/19/2014,Service was not good.Food was ok.took forever to arrive.
Sara R.,"Woodland Hills, CA",4,92,9,3.0,8/6/2013,The bread basket is good. I like the dark one better. I usually order a salad which always seems to be pretty tasty. I got their Alfredo pasta once which was way too creamy for me. I hate that Cheesecake Factory (not just this one) uses animal gelatin in some of their cheesecakes. That really disgusts me. My sister is a vegetarian and boycotted the chain altogether. The last time I came the server barely spoke English but he was very nice. Also not their fault but there was construction going on and trees were being cut down. It was very loud and unpleasant outside. Not their fault though. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake it was GOOD. I would give this four stars but had to knock one down for the beef gelatin seriously disgusts me. Almost half of their cheesecakes contain gelatin.
Florence L.,"Culver City, CA",519,515,209,4.0,6/3/2011,"Martini and cheesecake! Loving it! The bartender was awesome, but he's leaving to a different restaurant. He made a killer sour apple martini. The coconut something something cheesecake was so good... will have to get back to you peeps on that. Lol. I don't come here for their food which is just ok, I come for drinks and dessert =)"
Siddeeqah B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",13,16,,4.0,9/3/2010,"I like the cheesecake factory.  Edible food, everything shockingly taste great, and the drinks are great."
Therese S.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/8/2013,"Really bad lunch. Food was not good, we could not eat the chicken. No flavor.  Really bad service. Good soup. Will not be back! OMG! I can't believe they charged us. & we paid for food we complained about & did not eat. I would love to open a restaurant & not worry about customer complaints & charge customers even if they could not eat the food!!!! What a joke!!!!! Bad bad bad!! Oh & the manager never stopped by our table after we complained. The waitress told us she spoke to the manager & they would make sure they were following the recipe. Who cares!!!! I won't  be back. The chicken had no taste because it was frozen to long or what ever. It was bad."
Jenn C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",509,659,640,3.0,6/1/2011,"santa fe chicken salad is the only thing i order.  huge portions, free bread thats still warm, friendly service, and cheesecake so good that it melts in your mouth? you can't really go wrong.  I've been coming to this location since I was a little girl and it brings back great memories of my childhood and all the time I came here with my family. The only thing that sucks is that LA Fitness next door makes me feel guilty and makes me want to sign up for a membership hahaha"
Omega C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,32,,4.0,3/7/2014,As you all know cheesecake factory is known for their vast selection great customer service and consistent food. And they did not disappoint once again. My wife and I recently dined out and I have to Louisiana chicken pasta. Andrew who works in the bakery was wonderful... After asking several questions about the menu  I noticed something on the tv screens that they have that display there menu choices and asked he about pasta davinc and what I eventually ordered.. He quickly answered and said that the Louisiana Posto was a must-have... So I ordered that - and it was amazing. Andrew was great and so was my meal
Harriet K.,"Granada Hills, CA",119,73,,4.0,11/5/2013,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory many times over the years  and at different locations. Last night, I was treated to dinner at the new location which moved in Woodland HIlls. I had herb-crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious and the food was so tasty and moist. It melted in my mouth :) The presentation on the table was really visually appealing. The food was arranged like a crab. I kid you not! The bread served on the side was plentiful. We had an appetizer of calamari. Our waiter was very professional and attentive coming back periodically to check if the food was to our liking and if he could bring over anything else we may need."
B B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,2.0,1/2/2014,"Fruit flies, dirty silverware and plates, music blaring way too loud. Not pleasant for hanging out. Food is usual Cheesecake fate, you know what you're getting."
James L.,"Redwood City, CA",129,492,370,2.0,6/2/2008,"When you come here you'll ask yourself: ""Am I in a hotel, a restaurant, or the back end of a parking garage?""  It's hard to tell, because it's some freak bastard child of all three!  Out back where the outdoor seating is located, there's even a tennis court sunk into the ground with bleacher seats, though no one is ever seen playing.  The location is such a confusing, disorienting Frankenstein mishmash for a restaurant that you can't help but feel that it's just as likely to see Roger Federer on that court as it is to see four old ladies wanting to play a spot of light doubles. As for the food, it's Cheesecake Factory, so you know the drill: Pricey eats but HUGE portions, so at least you have a second meal to take home once you're stuffed.  Slightly above average food that you probably won't regret, but it's not food you miss either.  And a menu that's trying real hard to be all things to all people: Burgers! Jerk shrimp! Poached salmon and mashed potatoes! Egg rollz! Desperation! I suppose this is as good an opportunity as any to say: Justine Henin, we miss you greatly!"
