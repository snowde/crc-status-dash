Bo M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,40,,4.0,11/1/2011,"I like the wait staff and the food at this location much more than at their Sherman Oaks location.  The staff here are genuinely outgoing and friendly, as well as helpful with menu choices.  We went for a dinner out and had a really good time. The food was good and the chocolate cake for dessert-oh yeah!  The parking deck is all the way in the back of the complex and is  annoying.  I would suggest going valet if you are on a date or with a group of people, the walk all the way to the parking deck is lame, and expensive- $11.00 for Canoga Park area?  They should reimburse you for parking, but they don't."
John T.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2198,334,2454,2.0,12/12/2008,"When me, my girlfriend and her daughter went to eat there one afternoon on a Sunday it was not that busy so we decided to stay and have something to eat, we were not even greeted when we walked in, we get a new waiter that is new to the staff and she takes our order and everything, and then she tells us she is going on break and hands us off to another server, so 30 minutes goes by and the manager comes up to us and tells us that our order was never put in the computer and that they have to go and find the waiter so they could get our order from her, and then he tells us that it would only be ""a few minutes until our food comes out"" so 30 minutes goes by again and still no food so i tell the manager we are gonna leave because we have to go finish doing our errands, and then the food shows up while I am talking to the manager, so he  hands me $50 in gift cards and told me that we don't have to pay for our food and that the gift cards are compliments of the restaurant. I know new people need training and all but come on how can u forget to put an order in the computer before u go to break?"
Gela W.,"Atlanta, GA",144,304,64,3.0,1/4/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is just that...the neighborhood staple with a lot of hype and average food; a plus is their large portions.  Had the Chicken , wow, what a great entree.  Relatively low fat, breaded with a pile of mashed potatoes and a few stalks of asparagus.  Service, average.  Ambiance...gorgeous.  Easy to access.  The sweet corn cakes as an appetizer were pretty good too...hadn't tried them before and the sauce served with the cakes brought a savory balance to the appetizer.   The Key Lime Cheesecake that I brought home with me had a foul smell to it which prompted me to immediately toss it, couldn't be sick for the holidays.  Other than that, expect a decent experience...the CF experience."
Joshua G.,"SYLMAR, CA",0,12,,5.0,12/25/2013,"Wow!!! This place has the best food all around, hands down. Good customer service, friendly staff, easy parking , no charge , I'll be back again tomorrow for supper time."
Steve V.,"Woodland Hills, CA",151,221,38,4.0,2/9/2011,"Got home late yesterday from the Xbiz Seminars in Hollywood. No way I was cooking, and neither of us could decide what to eat... Ah yes the Cheesecake Factory...  They have a HUGE menu, and something for everyone. Even Stevie Wonder could find something he liked on that menu...  ;)    Anywho... I had some of their new items... Ahi Carpaccio... EXCELLENT. Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll for my wife, pretty good. We shared the Weight Management Pear and Endive Salad... excellent, and the new Crab and Artichoke dip. It was all on the money."
Lena P.,"WEST HILLS, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/30/2013,"We've been coming to Cheesecake Factory on Canoga for many years.  Always had great food and service.  When they moved to Topanga Mall, we were happy to try it.  We were very disappointed.  We were told there was a 45 min wait, which is normal, but after waiting for an hour, I decided to approach the front desk and was told to wait 1/2 hour more.  When I said we would leave, we were promptly seated.  The table we got was for 4 people, although there were 5 of us.  Once again, I had to complain to get another table.  Once we placed our appetizers and drinks order, we began to wait and wait.  Finally, our waitress informed us that popcorn shrimp that we ordered was not offered anymore, although it was still on the menu.  At that point, I had enough and asked to see the manager.  I hope management reads this and the service improves at Cheesecake Factory!"
Stephen P.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2013,"Ticket number 0690. Server was Jade. Horrible experience and they ruined my Christmas Eve Dinner. Waited almost 45 minutes for the appetizers to come out. Took another 45 minutes for our entrees to come out. When it did, it had obvious been sitting out for a long time, as my steak was cold, and my girlfriend's food was also cold.  During this 45 minute wait, the server did not even come out once to check on our water or to let us know that the food was coming out late. I asked for the steak to be removed from the bill and returned. The manager was so kind to come out to see if I wanted anything else, but I was already frustrated and did not want to wait longer. My girlfriend did not touch her food, which they did not even remove, but asked if we wanted a box. This really ruined my New Years Eve Dinner, and I even still tipped 20%.  Will not go to this location again."
Anosha S.,"San Jose, CA",20,209,12,2.0,3/17/2010,"Chains like this can be a hit or miss. The other night it was a huge miss. Waiter started out in a rush. Was at our table like twice before we got a chance to look at the menu. Asked for four-cheese pasta without chicken and we got 3 pieces of chicken thrown in there, but hadn't realized until after we were almost through. And when we told the waiter he looked at us like, 'so what'...looking down at the fact that the plate was almost done. But we ate it anyways because I was sharing with a friend and didn't notice until the end. Plus, he never came by to see how our food was. bla"
Rey T.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/29/2011,This is the best place on earth. I got in engage here. They did all the set up. It was an amazing service
Adam W.,"San Francisco, CA",307,118,8,1.0,8/24/2007,"20 minutes for take-out? I like Shepard's Pie, but not that much. I got things to do, yo. Move on if they give you a long TAT for lunch. There are little cafes around that will take care of you in a fraction of the time."
jonie m.,"Venice, CA",13,6,1,1.0,6/18/2012,"My fiance and I decided for Fathers day we would have dinner at the location in Woodland Hills. First off, the service was Horrible. We ordered a bottle of champagne , which was brought to us and the bottle was sat directly on the table, not in a champage bucket. My first champagne glass was dirty so I requested another one which still was dirty. All of our eating utencils where not wrapped in a napkin but sat directly on the table which were also dirty.  I finally decided to speak with a manager. His response to me for  why the dishes and glasses were dirty was that , "" Our dish water has to be changed every two hours or else all of the dishes will be washed with dirty water. Sometimes our employees dont change the water so this is why your dishes were dirty."" Why would you tell a customer that?  He did not apologize but he did say , "" Thankyou for letting me know because that may be what our other customers think."" I went back to my table and canceled my food. Why would I eat at a place who washed their dishes with dirty water?  Another manager came over and asked me what happend. I explained to him very politely what occurred and with a very bad attitude he walked off, no apology. This is not the type of service I would expect from the cheesecake factory. I frequent the location in Marina del Rey all the time and was never treated that horribly. For a first time visit to the Woodland Hills location I can say that I will never ever eat at ANY cheescake factory again. The least they couldve done was give me an apology not treat me like the person who washed THEIR dishes in dirty water."
Mona S.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,119,30,4.0,2/9/2010,"I remember when I thought this place was the King of all restaurants. It's huge, the menu is huge, and the dishes are huge. And there's every kind of cheesecake possible.  After delving into more ""fine-dining"" options over the years, I still think this place deserves a good 4 stars for its wide variety of foods and the tasty portions. They have added a ""small bites"" section to their menu. If you're indecisive like me, grab a few of these.. they're only $4-5 each. Plus, their a lot skimpier on the calories than the main dishes."
Giselle A.,"Seattle, WA",13,76,,5.0,9/21/2008,"I absolutely love this place! I can't believe all the bad rep people are giving it.  Yes, it's expensive.  Yes, there's a long wait and the parking is kind of confusing.  They validate parking though or you can make it easier and pay valet.  I've never had a bad waitress or  bad food.  Although their menu is expensive they still serve a lot! I can't ever finish my food.  The place is pretty big, and the decor is nice.  I've gone to this place for over 5 years.  I've gone as a couple and with a big group of friends.  I sincerely can't ever remember having bad service or a bad time."
Coreen L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",10,13,2,5.0,8/18/2011,"This place is always good,...never have any problems with service, the food is always hot and fresh, and the drinks are great! Love to come here with friends cause everyone can get something different cause the menu is so big! My fav is the corn cake, mojitos, and the vanilla bean cheesecake!"
Louis B.,"West Hills, CA",31,46,2,2.0,8/15/2013,"Another disappointing experience.  This location can best be described as erratic - sometimes decent, but most times not.  Our server was dirty - he had food all over his shirt. He did not know the menu. The shrimp bacon club (not served on ciabatta bread as per our server) was cold, soggy, SPARSE and disgusting. Manager brought out additional ingredients and new bread for our ""build your own club sandwich"". Our bleu cheese burger was lacking the bleu cheese - barely more than a thimble full. My factory burger was fine, but once again, we had to eat in shifts. Considering that this store is so close to the corporate offices, one would think it would be more closely watched, or perhaps is this indicative of what is happening in the chain? We hope that things are turned around when the new Woodland Hills location opens (with all new staff hopefully) because we are getting fed up and frustrated with The Cheesecake Factory."
LM M.,"Vallejo, CA",30,153,159,1.0,3/19/2008,"PROFANITIES! I came here four times, and got service once. The other three times the waiter(s) were non-existent and were helping those who were seated after us. Imagine my rage."
Kevin V.,"Ferndale, CA",1,32,5,1.0,8/30/2014,"How to start... We arrived at 11:30pm and were sat promptly as there was no one their other than us and about 3 other tables. Fast forward 15 minutes and still no attention shown and not even a mere drink order has been taken yet. I'm becoming extremely confused as I see all these waiters (a team of about 8) all standing congregated at the register looking lost. I finally get a waitress who asks us for a drink order when I let her know we wanted to order everything as I was already fearing I would not see her again/ Extremely rarely. She took our order and another 20 min go by and we STILL do NOT have drinks yet(don't even get me started on the bread) which never came until the meal after telling the manager about my horrid experience. His excuse is that ""they do NOT serve bread UNLESS asked for prior? ALSO... We had the pleasure of using the DIRTIEST FILTHY SILVERWARE AND plates I have ever seen. They were super greasy and had food particles all over them YUCKY!!! I have been to Cheesecake Factory a minimum of 100 times and have not once been told that once. As for the excuse/perfect reasoning for the drink tardee/ absence was that one person in our party got a coffee in which they had to make is the reason. BUT... This is malarchy because I personally was a Barista at the coffee bean before and know exactly how long it should take to make a simple espresso. About 15 whole seconds for the shot to pour and to tamp/ prep the shot of espresso and to add sugar maybe another 15 seconds ? 15 minutes is NO EXCUSE and the manager was EXTREMELY unhelpful and was FULL of excuses trying to scape goat his way out of any fault that was rightfully his. The main coarse and appetizers came out at the same time therefore my avocado eggrolls were cold as ice and undercooked.. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AVOID THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION! Or at least at 10pm and later. Ewwww with the service/ manager and full on experience and lack of professionalism I know Cheesecake Factory to be. The manager needs to be addressed and changed immediately and DEMOTED down to bathroom attendant as his professionalism matches my bowel movement"
Apryl V.,"Woodland Hills, CA",29,69,65,4.0,8/6/2010,"While I realize this is a chain, it really is consistent with service and food. Caroline is a great server and I will ask for her in the future. She was very sweet and very accommodating.  The food is great and the bar is always special. I love the avocado egg rolls, the salads and you can not go wrong with the fish specials. Never had a bad meal here and the menu is so versatile it tends to be a bit overwhelming which is a good thing. They have a lot of choices for vegetarians and luckily the cheesecake lives up to the name...just can't be beat."
Derek C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",77,31,,4.0,10/12/2010,"Cheesecake factory is great if you order the right thing! I happen to order the wrong thing last night - the Green Chile cheeseburger. The artichoke dip was delicious, the kids loved their shrimp scampi and the lentil soup was amazing! Since we live sooooo close to this place, we're trying to pace ourselves and not get over cheesed out :)"
Natalie G.,"San Anselmo, CA",68,236,6,4.0,3/7/2007,"Dear United Nations of Cheesecakes....what am I to do with you?  So hit and miss I can hardly stand it but I still have a soft spot for you... Why? Because of your: BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad The Navajo Chicken Sandwich The Oscar  and Avocado Eggrolls... Oh hell let's face it your Chinese Chicken Salad 'aint too shabby either..  Your Cheesecake is pretty good - sometimes you kinda over do it and it makes me say ""is it really still Cheesecake if..."". If I don't feel like making a 20 lb bad boy of my own..you are right down the street (even though I have a feeling if I knew exactly what was in your cheesecake I would probably never eat it again..). Your drinks so caloric sweet magic that there is no need for your probably poisonous cheesecake. I hate eating at your establishment cos let's face it you are noisy, crowded, and I have to wait forever to get a table. Your take out has taken upwards of 40 minutes after you assured it to be ready and several times you have forgotten to supply all the proper components and sometimes even a whole meal.  3.5 stars"
