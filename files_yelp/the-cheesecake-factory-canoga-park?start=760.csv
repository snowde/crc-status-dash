Faye A.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,1,2,4.0,7/4/2011,Thier bread is soooo good- the brown bread..i ordered a fettuccini alfredo- not good..fresh strawberry cheesecake - excellent;)
David J.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",67,16,2,5.0,7/1/2013,"Even though the AC wasn't working and it was a HOT Sunday night, we were treated to some great tasting food. But the best part was the service given to my family by a pretty blonde waitress by the name of JADE. A bigger table way behind us over whelmed our original server, Joshua, as we had some issues.  My mom, who is 88, wanted some ice for her Chardonnay, the 2 Stella Artois orders were getting warmed (we sat outside as the AC was not working that day) and we needed to change the beer into ice cold glasses, and my wife needed another Zinfandel.  Needless to say we needed some service, but could not get the attention of Joshua.  Another server, Jade, who was taking care of her own tables rescued us, even though she had as many customers to attend to.  Instead of getting somebody else or Joshua to come to out aid, she took the challenge and came to our help straight away. She is not a diamond in the rough that you'll have to give her time to blossom.  No, she is a Jewel in their crown and please try to have her as your server. She is not only high energy, professional, but also made you feel that your concerns are her concerns.  Now that is what I call not only great service, but she should be an example for every waiter in Los Angeles to be like her."
Kenesha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,11,1,4.0,6/26/2011,I went to the cheesecake factory for the first time yesterday for my 22nd birthday. I had a very good time along with my friends. The food was excellent and it makes excellent leftovers also. The place had a really nice atmosphere and my waiter was the sweetest(well the first one Jason). I wouldn't mind going again!!
crystal lee j.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,21,1,2.0,3/28/2011,"Dined with a party 4.  .  The meal started off ok, we all placed our orders and then food came in a surprisingly timely manner....not in usual Cheesecake fashion.  My friend ordered grilled salmon which came out completely raw.   When we asked for it to be cooked longer the server snatched it off the taple without another word.  Then a female manager came by and said""sorry your food was not cooked to your liking, can we get you another salmon or shall we just cook it more?""  We asked for the salmon to be cooked more and after the table was finished with their meals the recooked salmon came out still raw.  So bottom line, we went with a party of 4 and only 3 dined.  To make matters works the server refilled out water  and spilled all over the table and all over my friend.  Then she said ""oops, my pouring skills suck today, I will get you a napkin""   Seriously...."
Shannon F.,"San Francisco, CA",72,342,2,4.0,3/7/2007,"I would actually give this location a 3.5 due to the service that has previously been picked at by other reviewers. I never actually eat in the restaurant because I live so close, I may as well just take my giant portion of dinner home to enjoy in the companay of my cats, but the take-out service tends to be just as bad.  I have a hard time keeping track of how many times they have forgotten a part of my order, taken a half hour after I arrive to pick up, and they've already had a half hour to prepare my food, or just plainly forgotten about me. I have gotten plenty of free cheesecake from it, let me tell you, but it's not really worth the hassel.  The food, on the other hand, is typically superb. I always share because the portions must have been designed by a fifteen foot giant. My lady got me a slice of their choclate cheesecake peanutbutter cookie dough extravaganza last night, and I couldn't stop eating it! It's a slice of chocolate cheesecake, sandwiched inbetween a bottom layer of oreo cookie crust and a top layer of chocolate fudge. There are chunks of chocolate and peanuts dispersed throughout the cheesecake itself. Then the whole thing is topped with a GIANT swirl of peanutbutter cookie dough, and sided with a huge serving of whipped cream! WOW. It was so decadent and exactly what I needed. Bless you, Cheesecake Factory, for the creative use of your cheesecakes in an attempt to please everyone. Just get your service act together and we can be friends, okay?"
David S.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,5,,3.0,6/2/2011,I usually like the place although it gets overcrowded at times. Last time I was there I had bad  mushrooms and felt sick all night long. When I complaint to them they apologized and sent me a $30 gift card.
Grace C.,"San Francisco, CA",195,296,98,3.0,6/26/2008,"To be quite honest, I really don't like the Cheesecake Factory. The food is mediocre.  The service is crappy half the time...but at this location, the one in woodland hills, I would say I get crappy service 70% of the time.  I only come here when my friends suggest it...but I would never come here on will.  I liked it when I was younger.  Now I know better. If you must eat here, get the fried mac & cheese, crispy crab wontons, the pasta da vinci, and the bistro shrimp pasta.  oh, and the cheesecake, must not forget the cheesecake.  i've tried about half of them.  all good....but so many calories!!! Cheesecake Factory is not that bad...I just hate the service at this location.  I've had more pleasant experiences at the ones in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Corte Madera, Fresno, and Baltimore, MD.  But this is the one I've been to most often, since it is near my hometown. There's valet parking in front...or a parking garage in the back (don't forget to get your ticket validated).  Huge wait on weekends.  Not really worth the wait.  I would just go on a weekday afternoon when it's not too busy.  But anyway, the Cheesecake Factory is just okay."
Eric C.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/24/2013,always good always clean always delicious and always best drinks in woodland hills!!! avocado egg rolls are the best there! staff is pleasant! free validated parking. located next to some tall buildings makes you feel you're downtown or something! and we went there for happy hour recently so we ate and got drinks for a better price!!! will come back here any day!
Scott P.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/22/2012,"HORRIBLE service!! We sat for a half hour waiting for our waitress to actually ask us what we wanted to order. Not only that, it took her another 15 minutes getting us our check. The food was great and I love their cheesecake. The atmosphere is nice and warming so if you have kids, don't worry this restaurant is good. However, the service was not the best."
Fred M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,29,,5.0,6/12/2013,Awesome service. Excellent quality food. Always a joy to be in this restaurant. Huge portions.
Stuart K.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/18/2011,Pasta was under cooked. Got 1 refill in one hour. Didn't get bread with my meal and was upset it was a big drag.
Raqs P.,"CA, CA",2,56,56,4.0,5/4/2010,"This is a cool place, I LOVE LOVE their 1500 calories per slice Red Velvet Cheesecake...I had the 2 orders of tuna tartar and love it, it was filling in a small personal serve bowl. The service was great!!!"
T S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/27/2014,"I rarely write yelp reviews. I mean I have written one review in 5 years.  So I must be really pissed about this for me to turn on my computer and write this.  I called in a curbside order at 6:15 pm.  The girl put me on hold for about 10 minutes, but I'm going to let that go because I know it is a Sunday and they most likely are busy.  Finally someone comes on the phone.  I put the order under the name ""Tony"".  The girl repeated the name, ""kelly"".  Who the hell is Kelly!  I repeat the name ""Tony"".   My husband goes to pick it up, and gives them the name Tony.  He is Tony.  They can't find it.  He is waiting in his car for a hour and went inside the restaurant two times.  They say they can't find the order.  I call at 7:30 PM to talk to a manager.  The manager can't find the name Tony.  He asks if we ordered at the right Cheesecake factory.  Really?  Finally he gets some sense and look for the order instead of the name and he finds it under ""Kelly"".  Who the hell is Kelly!!  The too names don't even sound alike.  He said he will personally deliver the food to my husband outside.  He did not do that.   Did we get any discount?  NO!!!  Now it is 7:35 PM.  Finally he gets the order.   What's the point of curbside if you are going to be waiting for a hour.  I am so mad.  My husband being the nice guy that he is, didn't complain, but I am pissed and I am very certain that I will not be coming to this location again, nor my business meetings or visitors that come in town.  Because we didn't even get an apology or something, or anything, like it was our fault that the girl wrote down the wrong name. Where the hell did the name ""Kelly"" come from?    I have ordered from this place multiple times and always with the name, ""Tony"".  It is now 8:00 PM and I am still waiting on an order that I ordered at 6:15 PM and I live down the street.  AND I asked for no prosciutto on my Chicken Bellagio and they left it on.  They came to the car and forgot the cheesecake my husband had to wait ten more minutes.  The girl had to go back.  So obviously we are dealing with employees with no listening skills and reading skills.   If they didn't get the name right, at least get the order right."
David O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",127,1282,937,3.0,11/6/2006,"This Cheesecake Factory is embedded discreetly into the facade of a Hilton hotel off of Canoga Park near Erwin.   In fact, unless you're looking for it, you probably won't find it.   Then again, what do I know?  By the time we left this place, a couple of hundred people had ""found"" it and duels were held in front of the restaurant to try and boost your name on the waiting list.   Man I hope that poor Dutch father of 4 doesn't have to work with his hands, because he'll be on disability for quite a while and I don't really think hands grow back.   Ok, sorry... joking, joking.   Let's just say we were fortunate enough to walk in here at 11:15 AM and we sat at a prime location at the bar and watched the second half of the game (Can you believe Dallas missed that field goal?!?!?)  By the time we left at 1 PM, there were about 50 people waiting nervously around the door, hoping that the dining patrons would throw them scraps while they waited. My wife's worked in restaurants: high end Napa Valley joints that get 2 or 3 Michelin stars.  This is to say she sees things in restaurants the rest of us mere mortals have no idea about.   She said that the bar was seriously understaffed and they were doing a great job.   This was in reply to my statement:  ""WTF??!  We've been here 10 minutes... why is the service so lousy?""   She spotted the number of waitresses, was able to determine that one of these waitresses was working both the bar and the restaurant, and said that the GM was even getting involved....  all observations that quite clearly went straight over my head, since I was merely concerned with getting my beer.   All this to say that the service was actually pretty good, considering the shortage of staff.  In other words, the waitresses worked their butts off and did a fabulous job, but they need to hire themselves some more people. Food was good.   We shared an appetizer of buffalo blasts and we also shared a chopped salad.   I then ordered the Grilled Cheese sandwich and my wife had the Kobe burger.   Hmmm.... I actually thought we ordered pretty well.  Yeah well apparently I'd forgotten all about Cheesecake Factory's Supersize Plus (tm) portions.   That food ended up being enough for both brunch (when we were there) *AND* dinner 8 hours later.   The portions are insanely huge!  Note, however, that the food was not nearly as good 8 hours later, so it doesn't hold very well if you take it home. My wife said that once I'd taste the buffalo blasts, I'd be hooked.   Well, I'm not, but I don't think they were that good, and she indeed concurred.  She said that the outside is typically crispy and convenient to dip in either the buffalo sauce, the blue cheese sauce, or both.  The appetizers we got were pretty much on the soggy side.   They tasted yummy and all, but they didn't blow me away or anything. The chopped salad was huge, but I wasn't impressed.   I, for one, am of the opinion that chopped salad needs a creamy style dressing like ranch or blue cheese.  The dressing here was this italian vinaigrette... I dunno, it didn't really do it for me. The grilled cheese sandwich was also huge.   I mean I thought a grilled cheese was a safe bet.  Basically you picture wonder bread, or any loaf of bread for that matter... let's say you get a mental picture of the bread aisle.  A slice of bread is a slice of bread is a slice of bread.   Well, no, not so much apparently....  The toast used for my grilled cheese sandwich must have the same trainer as Barry Bonds, because that was just the biggest slice of toast this side of the Mississippi.   Anyway, it was good. Drinks... ok.   I got a Stella on tap, so you really can't mess that up.  I had a Bloody Mary to start things off, and that was only so-so. Would I come back?  Yeah definitely. It's a good solid place to get some lunch or dinner when you're not feeling all too adventurous or if you have a big group of people that all want to eat different things!"
Aiisha E.,"Box Canyon, CA",32,11,,5.0,1/28/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory period, but this location has great staff that remembers my name and is especially friendly.  I'm currently crazy about the Cajun Burger and the White Chicken Chili, but to be honest, I haven't had a bad thing at Cheesecake yet!"
Ryan R.,"Northridge, CA",36,10,23,5.0,4/20/2009,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory.  What started as a small cheesecake operation in the 1970's has grown into a full restaurant and bar with a huge menu of fantastic food with great interior design.  Each location has a character of it's own.  Some locations are ""Cafe's"" which are a bit smaller.  Brentwood has low ceilings and low lighting which feels more like a fine dining establishment, with a great patio with fountain.  Others like Woodland Hills have large dining areas with huge vaulted ceilings.  No two are alike. I worked as a waiter for The Cheesecake Factory for a couple years in the late 90's.  This experience sparked my interest in the culinary arts.  All the waiters have to know the menu production protocols quite well.    Another interesting bit of information is that The Cheesecake Factory management structure is a ""reverse pyramid"". Instead of the waiters being peons at the bottom of the internal food chain, with the management at the top - the waiters are at the very top of the pyramid - the most valued employees in the company.  The management is there below you - whose function it is  to support you in any way they can.  I loved this.  I have a deep respect for the way The Cheesecake Factory does things and treats their employees.   They value their employees more than any company I have ever worked for. Almost everything on this huge menu is bound to impress.  Very high quality ingredients, huge portions, and great tasting recipes - which are highly guarded by the way.  You must try the avocado egg-rolls which are outright shockingly good.  If you don't love these things, there is something wrong with you!  Avocado, sun-dried tomatoes & cilantro rolled in a wanton wrapper, fried, cut on the bias and served with a deliciously sweet tamarind dipping sauce.  Yummo!  Other good apps to try after you've done the avocado rolls are the Sweet Corn Cake Tamales and the Tex Mex Egg-rolls.  The Santa Fe Salad is amazing and is a must try too.  The BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad comes in a close second.  I have yet to be disappointed with any entree on the menu.   The Chicken Madeira is a solid choice if you can't decide.  Everyone likes it!  The mashed potatoes are the best you will ever have - made from new potatoes, heavy cream, butter and salt.  Heavenly.  One of may favs is the California Cheesesteak Sandwich, served with a side of marinara for dipping.   For steak lovers, I recommend the Filet cooked rare to medium rare with shoe string fries.  Ask to top the steak with a dollop of steak butter (the coulotte steak butter or the cajun butter). It used to come standard with cajun butter, yet they don't do this anymore. They still have the butter as they use it in other recipes.  The butter really makes it something special.  If you like a garlic kick, go cajun - otherwise get the coulotte butter.  If you're going to eat a steak, here or anywhere for that matter, it must be finished with butter, trust me,   It's a culinary tradition dating way back.   This place is not the place to go to cut calories.  It's a special place to go to treat yourself now and then.  Sunday brunch offers additional menu items.  It's fun to eat on the patio Sunday mornings.   Cheesecake here is the best you'll find, and the selection is gargantuan.  It's also fun to dine here just for dessert.  A girlfriend of mine used to insist on picking up a slice of cheesecake to go on our way home after being out for the evening.  The very best cheesecake on the menu is the Godiva cheesecake.  Get it!  Eat it!  Put it in your belly and the bellies of your loved ones!  Trust me!   This place rules.  If you are unhappy, tell them and they will take good care of you.  They highly value you as a guest.   Great food, great drinks and a great dining environment. I just feel good when I'm at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Yo Y.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/21/2011,"The food is great & the waitress is nice. I am ok with this place almost everything except the host. My bf & I got there early before 6 on a Friday night to avoid busy traffic. We are first led to a 24"" x 24"" table against the wall while I spot more than a couple bigger tables are available. I asked if we can change to outside dining area because I saw a lot of four-seat table are empty. Because we really don't like hitting the elbow against the wall while we are eating.  We then were told we have to go back to the front and wait again. After we waited for a bit, we were led to outside four-seat table at the corner, one of the seats & partial table are covered by a plant. We then asked to changed again. After we finished the dinner and about to leave, there are still 4-5 four-seat tables are empty. I really don't get the point of saving bigger table while they don't have a lot of customers. I don't think we will go back there again even though it's walking distance from our home."
Daphne P.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",181,39,7,2.0,5/10/2009,"Ok, this place seems to have gone downhill. Cheesecake factory has always been the place we go when we can't think of any place to go. The huge menu can usually accommodate all tastes in my family. I ordered my usual skirt steak and it was just ok. It actually was kind of cold. Everything just seemed ok this time. I don't want ok."
Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,564,13,4.0,4/14/2010,This is the first Cheesecake Factory I ever ate at and I have been a fan for over 20 years.  I have never had a bad meal.  The servings are huge.  I only wish they too reservations.
J K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/21/2014,"My family has stopped going here because of the new location in the topanga mall! This use to be our weekly family restaurant, but now it is a small and tacky mall restaurant with no space inside, terrible parking, poor staff with bad attitudes, and Sears shoppers walking past you constantly if seated in the ""inside-mall-walkway-seating right at the entrance of Sears. This use to be a nice and special place to go, but it is now equal/lesser to the food court... The staff always has an attitude while you are sitting squished next to strangers and can't carry a conversation with your friends. Not to mention the overly loud music always playing and fire alarms that constantly go off due to ""mall security breeches"". This place should have never left it's nicer, bigger, all-around-better location that is only a mile away! I will not be coming back to this location but will more than gladly return to the other if they reopen it."
