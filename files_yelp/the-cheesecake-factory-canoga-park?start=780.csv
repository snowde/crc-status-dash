W E M.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,76,23,5.0,9/20/2009,"I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake factory and when we came to this particular one, I was so disappointed when we were seated and having waited for 30 minutes, we looked at the table behind us who came in 20 minutes after us be served with bread and drinks! I immediately went to the manager and he made all things right! We even received a free margarita and 7 inch cheesecake! Top-notch service after the shananigans they put us through."
Joeleen J.,"Granada Hills, CA",30,80,63,5.0,12/29/2009,"The breakfast monte cristo is AMAZING.  I don't care what it costs.  It is soooo worth every calorie,"
Ward S.,"Montgomery, AL",54,241,1923,3.0,2/4/2010,"A business associate took me to lunch at this location in November 2009 when I was in Los Angeles.  The atmosphere and service are much better than the food.  The food wasn't bad, but I've had a lot better for a lot cheaper price at other chain establishments like O'Charley's.  (Olive Garden is a chain restaurant that has much better Italian food than the Cheesecake Factory.)  We sat outside on the back patio area next to one of the heat lamps and it made for a pleasant lunch.  On the plus side, the portions are enormous and as a result, I carried about half of it back to my hotel at LAX to have for dinner that night."
Steven B.,"Los Angeles, CA",138,124,1,5.0,12/21/2011,"consistent.  service maybe a little intrusive and they seem to have a lot of trainee's but there are also many servers that have been there a long time.  the bar is a great place to eat, and the bartenders are always good.  they made a mistake on my order, once, and pulled the charge from the bill and brought cheesecake.  expensive place, but almost invariably a good experience."
Sean M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",7,157,,4.0,5/26/2007,I have been to six different locations and all I have to say is.... Consistent. I live right down the street from the Woodland Hills one yet I hardly ever venture over there. Food and service is consistently just good and this is by far the best restaurant on Canoga Ave(not a great  prize mind you) I overall like this place
Alisha N.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/3/2012,"I decided to wait a couple of days before writing this review, however, Monday, October 1st is the last and final time I ever go to The Cheesecake Factory in Woodland Hills. The hosts were rude, the service was terrible, and to make matters worse, when I received my food, I found a live roach. I received no apology from the manager or any of the staff. They did comp my food as well as my boyfriends, but we still had to pay for our drinks."
keith f.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",1,30,,4.0,11/2/2011,"Yeah, it's usually packed, a bit understaffed for the crowds, but so many things here are SOOOO good (Miso Salmon!!!!!!!!!!) it's worth the hassle, fairly high prices and incredible calorie counts."
Paris N.,"Woodland Hills, CA",4,69,3,1.0,1/6/2011,"If you order a burger, make sure you ask for it raw. It will always always always be overcooked. This has happened a few times. It's supposedly ""Kobe"" beef but they keep burning the hell out of the meat.  This place has turned into crap the past few years. Go somewhere else."
Vic N.,"Canoga Park, CA",12,18,,4.0,3/22/2010,"Good food, but i like the one at Americana in Glendale better."
Don W.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,11,5,1.0,2/20/2011,"NEVER AGAIN! For a restaurant with the word ""cake"" in its name you'd expect to be served a decent slice of chocolate blackout, but I'm sorry to report otherwise. My wife and I stopped in to pick up some dessert to go on the way home from the movies, and we had specifically requested to NOT be served one of the oxidized slices from the display case. I have many years of restaurant experience as a server, so I know the difference, and I would never serve a customer something that I wouldn't serve to my own mother, but apparently the staff at the Cheesecake Factory are either orphans or just don't care, because one side of the $7 slice of cake was oxidized to the hardness of shoe leather. Thanks, Cheesecake Factory, for clearly demonstrating your inability to serve quality food even when customers hold your hand to try and help you tell the difference. You've lost a customer for life. NEVER AGAIN!"
Elyse G.,"Hidden Hills, CA",174,31,2,5.0,2/10/2012,What can you say about fired mac and cheese on a bed of Marina besides 1600 calories for 4 but worth it
Amber B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,48,7,1.0,9/29/2009,"No stars would have been more accurate. The service was TERRIBLE. My experience was something short of a nightmare. My date and I were treated like 2nd Class Citizens that crashed a party. After being seated we sat for 15 minutes if not longer without anyone coming to our table. Only after I approached someone about the lack of service did they send a waiter out. Even after  all of  that it still took another 10 minutes to get water and some bread. So many random inconsiderate, indirect discriminatory things happened that night that we ended up leaving.  And can you believe even after waiting and being treated like illiterate patrons they still got my order wrong, and guess what!? The manager took my order. His name was Austin, a very condescending, patronizing prick. It was unfortunate because I was looking forward to some Buffalo Blast. Never again...Never again!"
Stacy L.,"Chatsworth, CA",92,17,,5.0,1/24/2012,My fav place!!! The food is tasty and u get free sourdough bread and some other bread that tastes like chocolate!! The cheesecakes are delicious too!!!! I love everything about this place!!!
Jerry D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",34,3,,4.0,12/5/2009,"Always tasty food. If anything, their portions are too large. Service is usually top notch. Love their Crispy Chicken Costelleta and Factory Meatloaf. Lots of other good dishes, but too many to mention. Give it a tumble. You won't be sorry."
Glen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,,4.0,8/28/2008,"When we were being led to our seats I could feel something in the air.  I wasn't sure what it was but it was kind of nice.   I liked it but I couldn't put my finger on it.   Then after the waitress came over and took our order I knew what the atmosphere was.   This place is stuck up...lol  You can feel it.   Even the patrons, at least, that evening.  I liked it.  It's funny how a snotty stuck up crowd check you out and the clothes you wear.   Anyhow, the waitress warmed up.   The food was good and the stuck up atmosphere is better than none.   :)"
H T.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,14,,4.0,7/19/2009,"Been here a lot.  One main concern is the wait, especially on the weekends.  The food is great, never had an issue.  I've has almost everything on the menu from salads, to tacos, burgers, pasta, etc...  The prices are comfortable, I wouldn't call it a bargain by any means but then again it's not fast food why you're there.  The service has been great most of the time.  There has been occasions where it was tough getting the attention of the waiter/waitress for refills or more bread but overall nothing to offset a good experience.  My one other concern is the parking.  It's either valet or you have to park a fair distance away in the parking structure behind tennis courts.  Again, nothing to deter me from eating there on constant."
Kay P.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,36,,3.0,9/25/2011,"The food here is typically mediocre, except for the salads and cheesecake. But the service is always good and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere."
Karen Y.,"Boston, MA",130,556,1,3.0,3/24/2007,"i thought about not writing a review for this place, i think everyone else has said it all, food is good, service sucks.  but i do have a tip for everyone who has had awful service at this place: get online and complain to corporate.  i have done this twice because of this woodland hills location, and twice they have sent me a complimentary $25 gift card.  consider it compensation for the time lost when say on hold for 20 minutes placing your takeout order or say when someone finally stops their conversation with a coworker and tell you that they can't help you because it's not their job to sell gift cards even though they work behind the counter... corporate obviously doesn't care to do anything to increase the quality of service here, so you might as well get paid to eat there."
Monica G.,"Westwood, CA",18,168,1,3.0,1/29/2007,"Larger and slightly more elegant-looking than most other ones I've been to. Convenient valet parking in the front, and park it yourself option in the rear because the Hilton hotel is there. Food is typical of any other Cheesecake Factory..nothing out of the ordinary; great portions though..you really get what you pay for. There is a rather large bar here though. I noticed it's a pretty cool hangout spot for white-collar workers in the valley."
Andy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",270,397,97,4.0,5/12/2008,"This is a restaurant I usally order to go because its not worth the wait. They have slow service, the host/hostess are overwhelmed, and the place is crowded. I usally get the navajo sandwich and an order of buffall wings with a slice of cheescake. The steaks and burgers are pretty good but no consistency on the way they are cooked. I always stay away from the chicken because Ive had it served under cooked. Parking is no problem if you use the valet service if not you have to park in the garage in the back."
