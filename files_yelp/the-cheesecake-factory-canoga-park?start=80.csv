Vanessa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,2,2,2.0,10/1/2017,"The food was great last night but i told my server that it was my sons bday, then she switched shifts so i even told the new server that it was his bday, then the first server came back towards the end of the meal to bring the bill, everybody around us was being sung to but they completely skipped us even after telling them twice. My son came home very sad."
Shee K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",31,9,,1.0,12/3/2017,"I used to love coming here, but lately the quality has gone down hill. First off all the pastas seem to be drenched in oil, it's honestly gross. But what I'm most upset about is I order their desserts fairly often (to go) and I've been noticing the slices have been getting more slender, but tonight's portion was just RIDICULOUS ! I ordered a ""tower truffle cake"" and was beyond disappointed! I understand if you have to make cuts here and there, but I feel like I got gypped ! It was literally half of a half slice, for $10.95..absolutely not worth it. If you're going to serve child portions then you should charge something more reasonable, I mean really. This place has become too much like a chain and has lost that cheesecake touch it once had."
Michelle T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",5,21,2,4.0,8/27/2017,"Great customer service! Way better than the other Cheesecake Factory at Santa Monica. I came in and was seated about 5 minutes after during busy hours. I got the chicken scampi and it was delicious, but a little bland. I also ordered an original cheesecake and it was amazing! Their cheesecakes are delicious! Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the whole thing because of my previous meal that made me stuffed."

Catherine V.,"West Hills, CA",1,61,72,5.0,6/28/2017,"This location is great! Right by the mall, between Westfield and The Village. Amazing service, decor and of course food!! Would recommend this place to anyone who wants an excellent meal or a decent slice of cheesecake :)"
Fatima S.,"Canoga Park, CA",31,11,1,4.0,10/4/2017,Ordered Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Linda's Chocolate Fudge Cake. Quick delivery but the fries were cold.
Emy R.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,53,44,5.0,9/22/2017,Excellent place to go on a date or just bring your family in and have a wonderful delicious meal. Every time i come here i try something new. I love their extensive menu and drinks. And of course their famous cheese cakes .
Helayne G.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/7/2017,"I'm waiting over 40 minutes for curb side pickup. Four calls to find out that the kitchen is behind. Extremely frustrating. If they can't support a service properly, they shouldn't offer it. Very disappointing. Hopefully the order will be right when it gets here."
Daniel P.,"Encino, CA",1,2,,1.0,12/6/2017,I ordered a shepherds pie to go and it was extremely dry. Actually there was no sauce at all. The meat was really dry. I was extremely disappointed.
Will C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",12,73,10,1.0,9/3/2017,"The guy at the front desk totally ignored us when we were standing right in front of him.  He kept calling people behind me up to the desk to take their names.  This happened three times!  I finally said, why are you ignoring me?  He said, because you didn't say anything.  Like it is my job to tell him when he is ready to deal with me.  I'm standing at the front of the line, dude!  Wtf is wrong with that greeter?  We left.  No apology, shitty service, bad attitude.  Get your act together."
Zayin M.,"Northeast Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,4.0,4/4/2017,"Corporate food and robot attitude to the max, but if you're ok with that, then the various locations may be to your liking.  Personally, I can't stand their cheesecake, but I think they have the best burger n' fries in LA (I don't eat fries; I always substitute their killer mashed potatoes).  Interestingly, they also used to have the best veggie burger I've ever tasted - made with mostly fresh beets, veggies and beans (not 90% soy protein).  But they took it off the menu, and replaced it with the ubiquitous low-quality soy protein kind. They've recently raised their prices again, so I won't be eating dinner at any CF anymore - just the before 5pm lunch specials from now on.   And I never tire of their cobb salad.  I didn't like cobb salad at all, till I first had theirs.  In the 30 years I've been a customer, I've had terrible experiences and great experiences (the one in Sherman Oaks is the most inconsistent; the one in the Marina is the most reliable; the one in Beverly Hills is inbetween) - but overall, I never hesitate to eat at CF.  If we can't think of a place to go, we'll often just end up at a CF.   But why do they call it Cheesecake Factory? - the cheesecake is truly mediocre (I know everyone thinks its great - but millions of people think McDonald's is edible food, too).  Anyway, the high staff turnover tells you something (and not something good, of course), but I'm still solid on giving the whole chain 4 stars all the way (sorry, 5 is out of the question, as that would suggest that the food has been prepared/cooked by human hands)."
Abraham A.,"Tujunga, CA",4,80,9,5.0,9/9/2017,"The best Cheesecake Factory location, always great food, love how unlike Glendale they have a option to text you when ur table is ready. Generally service here is great too"
Lily L.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,116,186,3.0,8/25/2016,"It's the cheesecake factory what else can I say? Depending on when you get here there's usually at least a short wait or a really long wait if you get here at dinner time on most days but especially Thursday Friday and Saturday. I like this location better then where it was previously on Canoga and victory. The service here is OK. Since it's pretty busy here most of the time, it can be hard to get the attention of a waiter or waitress sometimes.  It's nice that they bring bread to the table, my favorite being the brown bread it's usually warm. My second favorite thing about this place is their skinnylicious menu. Believe it or not this is a good place to come if you want to eat healthy. Although I'm sure the sodium count on even their light meals is pretty high. I came here a lot when I was dieting for my wedding and their salads really helped me stick to my diet.  Overall this is a good place to come to with the family and they have a large variety of cheesecakes as well, my favorite being the dulce de leche. Lastly they have outdoor seating pretty much in the mall. It's a nice place to sit if you're lucky enough to come at an off time and be able to get a seat there. The food is just OK but I will continue coming here with family for holidays and birthdays and for their skinnylicious menu offerings."
Asia C.,"Rocky Hill, CT",175,3,,3.0,9/29/2017,Went last night and our server was acting like he was annoyed he had to even talk to us. He walked away three times before even letting me finish resulting in me just not being able to order something because he didn't come back until like 20 min later... I love Cheesecake Factory but my experience last night (besides the food of course) sucked! He didn't even put the sauce in when he packaged my avocado egg rolls to go (he walked away so fast that I couldn't even ask him). Hopefully he was just having a bad day but I can't lie I'm so upset I don't have that sauce right now lol
Apple J.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,64,93,3.0,8/17/2016,"I'm a very fair reviewer, unless staff shows a very rude and unprofessional manners. First of all, I LOVE their cheesecake...I can eat it all day long if it wasn't for the calories... I always order a delivery from this Cheesecake Factory location, and after this last delivery, I don't think I'll order again. First of all, we all know that the Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS provides complimentary bread (so delicious!) Anyway...since I only ordered 2 slices of cheesecake (my first time ordering just the dessert because I've had sushi dinner), the delivery person said that they couldn't provide another slice of ""complimentary"" bread (see the photo I added for what I received). I explicitly asked for the wheat brown bread...but they couldn't provide me that according to the delivery person (I received white bread) because one of the staff said my order was ONLY two slices of cheesecake... That is very impolite ... I paid about $18 just for those two slices of cheesecake that include a ""service fee"" So I called Cheesecake Factory and one of the staff transferred me to Veronica who didn't sound so nice on the phone...maybe it was a long day, I understand. Veronica claims that what the delivery person stated wasn't true.. Hmm ok ... How can she know it wasn't true? Now I wonder who handled my order...sounds very defensive to me. Honestly, no matter how good or bad the food is, as long as the service is great and friendly, that's what keeps me from coming back... Food can always be perfected..."
Jessy I.,"Woodland Hills, CA",167,163,49,3.0,8/25/2016,"I was going to write a long post to basically say we got terrible service, but I decided to sum it by saying we got terrible service. It was disappointing, may try a different location next time. The food was good though! To sum it all up: food-good, service-meh."
Odette M.,"Topanga, CA",43,40,29,4.0,5/20/2017,My favorite place!!!! I don't understand why the reviews aren't better. Beautiful restaurant. Great variety. Can't go wrong with a choice from the menu. Wonderful pies!!! Love the Godiva cheesecake (must love chocolate). Service can be better but I have never had a bad experience.
Shani O.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,19,61,3.0,12/4/2016,"Love this location, I never wait for a table more than 5-10 minutes. Also, the waiters are nice... Some of the food comes cold today, that's the reason for the 3 stars.."
Benay K.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",1064,414,612,4.0,7/10/2016,"I am surprised that the Canoga Blvd location's reviews were transfer to the new location at the mall- THIS visit/location was 100% better than the last. Our server was very friendly, attentive and fast. Our drinks were filled promptly, orders taken quickly, food was fresh and yummy. Parking is horrible though. Just a mess. I do like that after your meal, you have a nice air conditioned mall to walk it off. Much better experience all the way around"
Susan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",532,55,31,4.0,2/22/2017,"My go to place for holidays or special occasions. Always a favourite, will come back for more."
