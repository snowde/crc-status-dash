Mortimer M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,53,,3.0,8/28/2008,"I liked my experience here at this Cheesecake Factory. Kind of crowded. Parking is confusing. Food was good, not great. Service was good. Too expensive for my taste."
Sue L.,"Simi Valley, CA",268,479,25,3.0,5/22/2010,three to four stars. service wasnt the best. had a hard time getting the waiter. took him awhile to finally get us our bill.  i had the tostada salad. wasnt bad. wasnt the greatest either. it was absolutely huge. it can easily feed two to three people. the tostada shell was definitely overcooked. it was a tan color. the dark bread is outstanding. the cheesecake was great. i am a dulce de leche /caramel fan. i had the dulce de leche cheesecake. they overdid it with the whip cream. otherwise really nice. everyone else at the table  enjoyed their meal.
Daniel H.,"Canoga Park, CA",202,57,42,1.0,3/26/2008,"We often come to Cheesecake Factory, just not this location. This has to be the worst Cheesecake Factory in every way possible.. Slow non existing service, with terrible food. So my mother and sisters started off with a couple drinks at the bar. Once our table was ready they said they would send the bar tab to our table. After them having sent our tab to the table my mom was holding it and the waiter had the nerve just to snatch it out of her hand and say, ""what are you doing with that?""  my mother replied, ""it's our bar tab"" the waiter replied with a, ""yeah.. sure it is."" he then grabbed it and just ran off. After waiting 45 min for the food to arrive, we tried to enjoy the dry meal. When the regular bill came we were informed that the waiter had lost our credit card. So after having to complain about it, they finally said they would look for it in every bill. After waiting another 35 min they finally found and the the waiter had the nerve not to hand the credit card back, but THROW it to my mother. I've never seen such shitty service in my entire life, i would have rather eaten at home with some macaroni and cheese then spend a dollar at that Cheesecake Factory! Never going back again. We even sent an email about the service there, and we have yet to hear anything about it."
Teena S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",145,236,83,4.0,6/15/2009,"for someone who lives in an area that has such limited food options, this is always a failproof spot.  im convinced that these huge franchise restaurants cant mess up thei food since its all pre seasoned, pre made sauces and things - the food remains the same and never differs, i will base this review on the service cus that could always be a hit or miss.  it was sunday night close to 8 o clock and the restaurant was still full of patrons but there was no wait. we got seated outside as requested and enjoyed a rather nice meal without the loud music or constand hustle and bustle. the waitress was really accomodating and very attentive even though she seemed like she was catering to a full section. again - cheesecake factory is always a fail proof spot if you want to dish out large sums of money are large amounts of decent food~"
Zachary D.,"Marina, CA",0,101,,5.0,7/7/2012,"this is truly a full on restaurant. i have been going to this cheesecake factory for over fifteen years. i love how casual and how classy this place can be. during lunch or an early dinner its pretty casual place. but once that sun starts to set, here come the expensive cars and the louis vuitton handbags. everything here is amazing, the restaurant itself is beautiful, though i have always thought it was kind of dark inside. i just love this place, and you cant leave without getting something from the bakery, their namesake is pretty damn good. the restaurant is really one of a kind, from the kind staff, to the clean restaurant, to the perfect food, and the prime location. where can it go wrong? this place really is a restaurant gem."
Beth F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,1/18/2010,"horrible service. I asked our server if they validated parking in the garage, and she said no. I walk out after a 2 hour event paying $12 for parking. I later find out that yes, indeed, they do validate parking. I was there for a group event. To give us a quiet space, we requested the banquet room. To do that, we had to select a fixed menu at $25 per person. That is all well and good...I usually expect to pay $25 at the Cheesecake Factory. However the entrees were HALF the regular size, and the cheesecake was only offered in two flavors (both gross..chocolate and key lime...blech), and when the slices arrived, they were a THIRD of the size of the usual slices of cheesecake. The agreement also was to include ""unlimited coffee, tea and sodas"", however my diet coke and water got refilled ZERO times, and our waitress seemed uptight when I requested coffee along with my excuse of a dessert. Probably because they Cheesecake Factory management felt it was OK to only provide ONE server for 25 people. The poor girl was rushing around so bad...then I excused myself to go to the ladies room and saw a cluster of 4 servers (not bussers or hostesses) standing around and gossiping as our poor girl was running around like crazy. And the manager just watched all of this!! I will NOT be returning to this Cheesecake Factory. HORRIBLE ripoff for groups, HORRIBLE customer service, and I am out $12 on parking that their employee was too incompetent to answer my parking question."
Roman T.,"Irvine, CA",478,342,1484,3.0,5/13/2007,"Don't get me wrong, I love eating at Cheesecake Factory. Their Cajun Rib Eye is really good and I love their fried calamari. This location however has horrible service. On Mothers Day, after the flowers and the presents, my sister and I had planned a dinner in bed for our mom. I was planning to order a bunch of stuff from this place, have my sister pick it up and have my mom just stay in bed all day while we get everything for her. Is it really hard to understand that I want 4 Cajun style rib eye's with 3 mashed potatoes and 1 with steamed veggies, 2 medium and 2 well done. I guess it was a busy day over there, because before I even finished placing my order the girl on the phone said ""Ok"" and hung up on me. After I called back because she didn't let me finish ordering the sides, she gave me attitude that she heard me before and that there was no need to call back, and hanged up on me again. Now if I got my food the way I ordered, I wouldn't really care that much. When my sister gets home I check the food and noticed that I got 4 RARE steaks, with fries. Even after I called and confirmed my order a second time, to get it wrong is just ridiculous. My mom doesn't like her steak to be rare, so I had fry the steak myself to make it well done. 3 stars sounds like too much for this place, but I've been here before and the food was good just the service was lacking like other reviews have stated. Even if you order out, their service is horrible. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for ruining the perfect Mothers Day, and pissing me off. You're lucky I love your cheesecake, or it would have been one star."
