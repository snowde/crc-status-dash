Dianna Z.,"San Diego, CA",132,110,142,5.0,1/10/2018,"This place has way too many options!! Haha. It's a good problem to have. I always love the food here. The tamale corn cakes app is my favorite. For dinner I got the BBQ burger. It was delicious! Everyone at my table enjoyed their meal.  Once when I was young, I swore I would try every flavor of cheesecake they sell. I haven't done it yet but I got a few more under my belt during this trip. I order the raspberry lemon cake. My husband got the cookie dough cake. I liked his better than mine!  The reason this review gets 5 stars is the service. The place was packed and we got really lucky and were able to grab a bar table without needing to wait 30 minutes. Our waiter, Hunter, was awesome! He was very attentive and always came back to check on us when our food or drinks were taking a little longer than normal. He was super friendly and helpful. Thanks Hunter!"
Aisha M.,"Oceanside, CA",175,12,29,5.0,1/6/2018,"Not sure why this place is getting so low of a rating, I always had a good experience every time I came here. I feel like most complaints are on wait time which I never had a problem with so . The service is fast and the workers are always polite and attentive.  This is my third time going here and I liked all of their food. The Fettuccini Alfredo is my favorite and still hasn't disappointed me."
Gaby Q.,"San Diego, CA",1,23,28,2.0,1/6/2018,"I don't understand why this company doesn't do reservations. I just think they should allow them for big groups like 30, which is what we had for dinner last night. I am giving them two stars, one for the food and the other for our server. I checked in around 5:30pm and the wait was 2-3 hours for our group size. Okay cool, we waited. Once it hit 8pm, I walked in and waited for about 20 mins to get an update from the manager because apparently she was the only one that could give me an update for my group size.  Once it hit 8:30, she said it would be another 50 minutes...keeping in mind that my entire party of 30 was there since 7pm. We ended up getting sat around 9-9:15pm and there excuse was that they had a section saved for us but another group of people decided to get up from their booth and sit right in the middle of our ""saved"" section. Well if the section was saved why couldn't they have kindly asked them to move and explain the situation?!  In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for large parties whatsoever. Food was good but if you're thinking of having a nice dinner with your friends and family and it's going to be more than like 5...you're better off going somewhere where they will reserve you a table and have everything organized to make sure your guests have a wonderful dinner and not wait 2-3 hours with them not giving you any updates at all. I love  their cheesecake and the food this place offers but definitely not coming back unless it's for a date night (which wait time was an hour for 2 people last night)"
Nette B.,"San Diego, CA",1628,1009,1992,3.0,1/3/2018,"Hello North County Restaurants!  I'm Nette B. and I dined at your restaurant.   Nice addition to Carlsbad Mall.  Came here with family because they had a gift card.  We were a table of 8 and the wait was about 45 minutes.  We tried to call ahead and make reservations but they do not accept any.  Luckily, we were told the buzzer works up to Jc Penny's so I took my nieces and nephews to the playground. We actually walked back to Cheesecake Factory after 35 minutes just in case.   We had a really nice server.  I believe her name was Madison.  She was nice. :)   Food:  I ordered the small plate; chicken lettuce wraps asian style, ahi tartare.  My food was not amazing but it was good.   My family members were not that pleased with their food.  My brother ordered shrimp scampi and the noodles were dry.  My sister ordered a pizza and the bottom of the pizza were all black and burnt that they didn't even eat all of their food.  :(  I did however bring it to the attention of our server and the manager so that they can let the kitchen know.   With all that being said, I don't think I'd return here again."
Justin G.,"San Diego, CA",14,60,23,1.0,12/29/2017,"Worst experience at a Cheesecake ever. I usually enjoy this restaurant chain, but this one is a location to avoid. Our 45 minute wait turned into 90 minutes. The food took an extremely long time to hit our table, and the appetizers came alongside the main course even after we requested to have them separately. My hibachi steak didn't come with the asparagus, my friend's burger came with all of the sauces on it when he requested it only have mayo, and my fiance's salad lacked grapes. All three of our dishes were messed up and we received no compensation. We were also there to celebrate a special occasion, and the server didn't even bother asking. Cheesecake is good, but make sure you avoid this one!"
Emma J.,"Carlsbad, CA",731,369,1109,5.0,11/11/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory & so happy we now have one in Carlsbad. Our group was luckily treated to a complimentary dinner before they officially opened doors to the public, and everything was just perfect. One of the best things about Cheesecake Factory is the consistency between locations, and Carlsbad is already keeping up. Every dish came out looking and tasting delicious. Service is extremely friendly. Staff goes above & beyond to take care of guests, and we were even gifted complimentary slices of cheesecakes to-go - does it get better than that?! The city of Carlsbad shuts down pretty early, but fortunately Cheesecake Factory stays open til 11pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends. I'm also looking forward to trying their weekend brunch."
David l.,"Encinitas, CA",117,81,153,5.0,11/14/2017,How can you ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.. traditional look.. great food.  Fast and friendly service. Cheers.  You did a great job on your opening day. They did a great job staying try to the brand. You can't ever go wrong here.   Cheers Cheesecake!  - DL
Colleen G.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",1,15,9,4.0,1/7/2018,"Well me and my friend came here for lunch. We planned on eating inside cause it was cold, but it was freezing inside! So we are outside by the heaters. The music sucks here. We tooled for ever to makeup our minds they kept checking on us, and were very nice. We finally decided on salads. I got the almond herb crusted salad, and very got the vegan cob salad! It's to die for they are both great!"
Gina G.,"Oceanside, CA",148,97,624,4.0,11/27/2017,Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorites for great variety of both main menu items and flavors of cheesecake! I was so excited for this location to open in my backyard. I love that they have outdoor patio seating and seating that opens towards the mall. We sat at the seating that faces the mall walkway and enjoyed the openness and casual atmosphere. Our server was very prompt and knowledgeable of the menu items. I had a delicious almond crusted salmon salad and I would order it again! My parents and husband had pasta and all were impressed. They also have a brunch menu on Saturday and Sundays that starts at 10am. The portions are large and the complimentary bread is a nice touch. I'm glad this location opened and we will be back soon!
Shae H.,"Oceanside, CA",0,67,34,3.0,11/28/2017,"Was so excited to finally dine here!  Took the whole family after watching Justice League for a late lunch/early dinner.  Because the place was new, I expected that the service will be slow, but it was ok, not too slow.  Pace was reasonable for the weekend crowd.  The issues were: 1) we weren't informed that they were out of white rice (ordered with miso and grilled salmon), instead they gave us brown rice with the miso salmon and mashed potato with the grilled salmon.  After letting our server know that we ordered white rice, we were told the kitchen was out of it and they replaced the mashed potato with brown rice and 2) their computation of suggested tip is based on the total amount, not the subtotal befor taxes, so just be aware.   Fortunately, food has the same consistent quality so we'll be back soon.  Hopefully by then kinks in the service will be fixed."
Jasmyn H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",56,15,32,4.0,12/11/2017,Can I just have 1 of everything on the menu and just you fork full of every cheesecake! I have never had an item that was mean to my pallet. Every dish is full of flavor and I love the Skinny menu options. I got so full on drinks and bread that I only ordered sides but even those were worth the trip. The staff were happy and polite even though some people were highly irritated over the wait. We had good conversation but we did notice that the place was packed for a Monday night.  It is a new and clean place that will be a family favorite.
Aurora R.,"Carlsbad, CA",115,3,,1.0,1/10/2018,"We have never been to a Cheesecake Factory and had such a terrible experience. Going into our third hour --one waiting for a table, one waiting for food--we are highly disappointed. We came to celebrate our teenagers birthday and were told we would have only a 30min wait for party of 8. After an uncomfortable 2hrs of keeping a 7yr old calm, we finally received our orders mixed up and over cooked. The side orders were incorrect, the plates were incorrectly labeled so they were given to the wrong people, and the steak--one of which was a $30 filet mignon--that was ordered medium rare, was broight out well-done. Not a great birthday dinner! Now it's 9:30pm, we are still waiting for the check, and we have hungry, unsatisfied kids to get home on a school night. Highly NOT recommended!"
Michelle S.,"Vista, CA",202,10,345,2.0,12/18/2017,"My fiance and I were out Christmas shopping at the mall last night (12/17) and were excited to try this newly opened Cheesecake Factory at the end of our trip. Unfortunately it was NOT a good experience.  First of all, I understand that this restaurant just opened and that CF restaurants usually have a long wait time in general but at least provide waiting customers somewhere to sit while they wait! There was no room at the bar and only two tiny benches for people to sit and wait at which were taken. We awkwardly stood around for 45 minutes along with several other parties in the way of the wait staff and passerbys. Being elbowed and asked to move out of the way several times is not a great start to a dining out experience :/. When our buzzer finally went off we were starving and irritated but excited to finally be seated! It was a cold night and we told the host we wanted to be seated inside and would gladly wait for a seat inside to open up. We were lead past an open seat for 2 inside and out to the seating area inside the mall near the escalator. It was freezing out there! The mall's sliding door to the outdoors was left open and it was like dining in a refrigerator! I wanted to complain and ask to be seated inside like we had asked for in the beginning but feared another epic wait time so we stuck it out.  Our waitress was friendly when she finally made it to our table 20 minutes later. Luckily our bread, food and water didn't take quite as long to come out as we were worried it would. The fare was good quality with decent portions but we were so cold we couldn't wait to finish it and leave! Make sure when you ask not to be seated outdoors to also say you don't want to be seated out in the mall seating area. It's just as cold and uncomfortable if not worse because there are no heating lamps.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go which took a long while to get! The waitress kept coming back to apologize and told us the dessert counter was behind due to a large order. Once we finally got our cheesecake we paid and ran to the warmth of our car.  I don't think we will be back anytime soon. It ended up being a 2.5 hour uncomfortable experience."
Mike v.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/5/2018,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory usually but this location in Carlsbad still has a lot of kinks to work out on how they operate. I've come in here a few times now and every time there has been some type of issue with our order and I've also noticed other people complaining about similar things. What really put that last visit over the top was how rude and unprofessional the female manager was the other night to my mother. My mom had ordered a pretty standard dish for dinner and when we all received our food, my mom had not. After a few more minutes she kindly asked the manager if her food was coming since she had been waiting around 40 min already. This lady, in the most condescending tone I've ever seen, tells my mom ""ACTUALLY, you've been waiting 34 minutes on the dot, and we'll do our best to get it right out to you"". I almost wanted to laugh at how horrible she handled this situation and how absolutely terrible her customer service was. As a manager that's like your number 1 priority to make sure floor is running smoothly and take care of any customers who might have issues like this. How they have that lady in staff as a manager is beyond me, and especially for place that messes up so often I can't imagine how many other people she is demeaning. I hope they figure out their kitchen and staff issues soon because until then I will stay away from this location.  2 stars because the cheesecake still good."
PatDan C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,3,5.0,11/15/2017,"Went there on opening day just to be part of the hype without expecting too much, I'm not a big fan of food chains, but let me just say I absolutely loved it... everything my husband and I ordered was absolutely delicious!!!!!! I'm a fan of this place now for sure....! that being said...the service and atmospehere were amazing! Can't wait to go back again...."
Rachel S.,"Brisbane, Australia",305,192,253,3.0,12/18/2017,"I was more than hesitant to dine here after reading the bad reviews, but a family member had planned a Christmas Dinner here and I was a little curious to see if the reviews matched my experience.  Arriving at 4pm on a Sunday it was packed inside. We were told the wait would be 20-30 minutes which it was. Waiting really shouldn't be an issue, there is plenty of seating outside the front doors and around the patio area to wait.  We had a super friendly server and we were all really pleased with her attitude. Warm bread is offered to start, with olive oil and vinegar which was great!  The four of us ordered avocado eggs rolls as an appetiser, they were tasty but they were more room temperature than anything which was a bummer.  It did take a little while for our main meals to come out, mine took the longest- I ordered the sausage and shrimp pasta.  Again, my pasta wasn't hot at all which was as a surprise since I waited so long for it to come out. The others in our party ordered salads and spring rolls, no body raved about their food but it was definitely edible.  After stuffing our faces with the warm bread and eggs rolls, none of us ate much of our main meals but our server happily boxed up our leftovers for us. Having a great server definitely helped the dining experience as it was just very average overall. I assume that when Yardhouse opens up, Cheesecake Factory will have a much smaller crowd and will get into the groove of things by then."
Ann F.,"San Marcos, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/9/2018,"Usually cheescake is always delicious food and big portions which makes up for the price, however at this New location the food tastes horrible. I have been there twice now and the food doesn't taste like a normal cheescake factory would and the portions are less than normal.  However, the service is good and they all are very nice which is why I gave them 3 stars."
Karley G.,"Carlsbad, CA",83,32,,2.0,12/29/2017,"Yesterday was horrendous. If it weren't for our server, the entire experience would have been a wash. We decided on Cheesecake Factory after finding the wait at Yardhouse would be 45 minutes. We were seated rather quickly... And then not tended to for at least 15 minutes. My guess is the hostess seated us and didn't alert the server. I get it, this location just opened and there are still kinks to be worked out.  After placing our orders, we waited an hour to get our food. An hour. Our poor server did her best to keep the bread coming and the drinks full but she can only be responsible for so much of the overall experience. We noticed a manager was coming around to the different tables around us, hopefully with an explanation or an apology for whatever was holding the kitchen up... We'll never know as she skipped us.  Not only did we wait and wait for our food, parts of our meals were forgotten and when mentioned to the expo, never brought out. Unfortunately we had a movie to catch (we thought an hour and a half would be more than enough time to have dinner) so we just didn't have more time to waste. In hindsight, maybe we should have waited that 45 minutes for Yardhouse?"
Kim M.,"Oceanside, CA",92,20,6,2.0,12/21/2017,"Parking was horrid.  The mall really needs to add a parking structure with so many restaurants so close together. We were told the wait for a table for 5 would be 20 minutes.  It was 30.  Then we were called to be seated and waited, and waited.  None of the 3 hostesses at the desk said a word us.  Then I noticed only one host was seating guests, the other three were just lining them up.  Another 10 minutes later we were seated. Our server was nice, but the service was VERY slow.  I appreciate when I notice management helping serve and clear, but the manager here seemed to prefer walking up and down the aisles with a sour look on her face.  Certainly not welcoming. Although the food at Cheesecake Factory is always good, the service here leaves much to be desired.  I won't be rushing back.  Hopefully it's just growing pains since they've only been open a few weeks."
Rachel B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5,22,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Came to this location for the first time and it was okay. Our wait was reasonable, but our waiter wasn't on top of it. He kept going back and forth and forgot our silverware, while my husband and I waited for him to come back, we used our bread to dip into the butter. He also only brought my ice tea out and we waited more than 5 mins to bring out my kids drink and hubbys. When we got our food which seemed like an hour, he didn't come by when we were eating to see if we need refills or if the food was okay. In my opinion, he only came out when something was brought to the table; appetizer, our 1 round of drinks, food and the check. That was pretty much about it. The only thing that was good about coming here was the food."
Kenzie G.,"Escondido, CA",0,6,14,2.0,1/5/2018,"I usually love this restaurant and this location, but I am SO extremely disappointed with my last visit. I am not one to write reviews, but I could not believe the poor service I received after my visit.  First, 116 dollars was billed to my account even though the check I signed at the restaurant was for 19 dollars, 27 after an 8 dollar tip. I was absolutely shocked at this egregious mistake and overcharge.  Second, I called the restaurant four different times at different times of the day to discuss this issue and four times I was not put through to a manager. The first two times were at 10 AM and 12 PM respectively. Both of those times, I was told a manager was unavailable.  The third time I called, I was put on hold for FIFTEEN MINUTES and no manager came to the phone. I ended up hanging up and calling again, only to be put on hold for another TWENTY MINUTES.  Finally, after the fifth phone call, I was connected with a manager. I explained the situation to him, and he pulled up my bill. He said that on his end the correct amount was reflected, and when I asked why on my end it said 116 he was not able to give me an answer. All he told me to do was call my bank because it must be their problem. He did absolutely nothing to try to ease the situation or help my frustration. I am even more frustrated now, after the phone call, than I was before.  Just extremely disappointed and frustrated."
Leah R.,"Seaside, CA",0,5,1,2.0,1/4/2018,"This place is a mess.  Went in on a Thursday night, it was pretty busy and they were on a wait but my friend and I went in to have a drink and order some take out. We got there around 7-7:30 and found a seat at the bar fairly quickly. Bartender Johnny was fantastic, greeted us in a timely manner, drinks were expensive but good. We ordered our take out and about 45 minutes later our food came out, but we were told that someone took one of our items to a table so they had to remake it. Okay, shit happens. But we waited an additional 45 minutes for our other item to come out, no manager came over to apologize, give an excuse or anything. It was taken off the bill but only after Johnny was like I'll fix this for you guys, without us asking. Food was decent but it seems like they've hired a bunch of children that have no idea what they're doing, including the managers.  So two stars, because food was decent and Johnny rocks."
Sonia R.,"Carlsbad, CA",56,5,,1.0,12/2/2017,My best advice to you is to give this place a miss for a year or so so they can iron out their issues.  And they have many Staff are nice and friendly enough but they haven't got the system down ... Saturday lunch time 30 min wait for a table (I'll take that grudgingly so ) but over 1.5 hours wait once seated for food????  We only ordered 2 salads and 2 kids meals!!!  2 of them are straight out of the fridge??!!   This trip to Cheesecake Factory made me so mad I won't be going back. Not in a long while.  And... I wrote this review during the 30 (more) minute wait for them to bring desserts to go... yep still stuck here ..
Barry H.,"Carlsbad, CA",38,17,5,2.0,1/6/2018,"The food was good as most Cheesecake Factory's are. That's the only thing good here. I'm fine with waiting to be seated but when the hostess gives an estimate of 25 minutes, I don't expect it to be an hour and 25 minutes as it actually was. When we order our food and the server comes back 10 minutes later saying our food will be right up, I don't expect to have the food arrive 55 minutes later. When we didn't learn our lesson and ordered dessert, the cheesecake was out in 5 minutes but it took (no kidding here) 20 minutes for my sons milkshake to get to our table. The excuse ... oh we're really busy tonight. No, you're not any busier than any other evening. You simply have staff that are not competent at estimating timing with any semblance of accuracy and you're in way over your head."
Alicia R.,"Vista, CA",282,117,168,5.0,12/3/2017,"Awesome first visit!!! Delicious steak medallion dinner and strawberry original cheesecake! Friendly staff, clean restaurant and nice atmosphere! Definitely coming back!"
Lora C.,"San Diego, CA",245,77,45,3.0,12/4/2017,"Two things you should know before I write this review: 1. I love Cheesecake Factory. 2. It was the grand opening.  Overall, the food was what I come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory. I go with my go-to every single time the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It's breaded Parmesan chicken served with bow tie pasta and a spicy Louisiana Sauce. At this location the pasta was like warm, I'm pretty sure it was sitting out for a while because the sauce was extra dry, almost non existent. I came with a party of six and I had a feeling it would take a while so I ordered an appetizer, the Avocado Egg Rolls. Ye appetizer came out fairly quickly and the sauce and the flavor was muy deliciosio. However, it took almost an hour after the appetizer to get our main dishes and for any restaurant that is unacceptable. At most Cheesecake Factories they give the obligatory, ""Be careful, the plate is hot."" Not so with this place, which again leads me to believe that our food was sitting sad and lonely, waiting for someone to bring our food to the table. Service was great, our waitress was awesome and I really felt bad for her. She was doing her best, I just think they need to rethink the ratio of tables per server. So kudos to our waitress she was a gem! Another note is the traffic in the restaurant. The walkways were so congested by staff and patrons. So quick recap: 1. Our server was a gem. 2. This place needs to rethink the ratio and walkways.  Hopefully, the problems we experienced with the food and congestion was mainly due to the fact that it was opening weekend. I'll definitely give this place another chance and hopefully I'll have a better experience."
Vicki P.,"Vista, CA",4,11,,5.0,1/6/2018,"Awesome food, amazing menu and our waiter Eric P was kind and helpful as we navigated through the huge menu and cheesecakes!! The salmon and chicken piccata were so good. Never a bad meal!!"
Joe V.,"Oceanside, CA",0,14,,1.0,12/14/2017,"An overpriced, pretentious restaurant that serves mediocre food and expensive drinks.  After paying with me credit card, it took the server and manager 12 minutes to locate my credit card that they misplaced."
Monty E.,"San Diego, CA",0,30,2,2.0,12/28/2017,"Couldn't get seated, host stand was a mess. Stood at the host desk for 3-4 minutes while 3-4 women had their backs turned to us and talked. One was folding menus. No one even turned to say ""hello"" or ""we will be with you in a minute,"" we had to interrupt them to ask about being seated. Once acknowledged we were told there was no wait, they'd seat us right away, and then the hostess just walked away with out saying anything!?! In the meantime, another family behind us was then greeted and for some reason immediately seated by another hostess (they were a party of 3, we were only 2). It was just totally disorganized and rude service (rude in the fact we were blatantly ignored). They weren't busy, it was 1pm on a weekday."
Anna M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,110,,2.0,1/1/2018,The food is good but the low rating is due to their lack of staffing. I was on hold for 25 minutes to place a to go order because they were apparently (very) understaffed for New Year's Day. I finally hung up. They couldn't handle it at all. Management needs to get a grip.
Kimzo A.,"Oceanside, CA",16,40,244,5.0,12/13/2017,My favorite restaurant. The only sucky part is waiting for a table other than that it's a decent place! Love it!
Dale R.,"Oceanside, CA",22,1,,3.0,11/17/2017,"Before I write my review I want to state that I fully understand this is a brand new establishment however, being it is The Cheesecake Factory, we did have a higher expectation.  The food was good, no complaints on the food. The service wasn't nearly up to par. Our first server forgot a drink at our table after being reminded 3 times throughout 30 minutes. We had another server bring it and then a different server was introduced to our table. Our food took WAY too long to arrive after putting in our order. After asking for our check at 9pm we received it at 10:15. We asked twice for it. I even went up to the front and was told I had to wait for our server. We were finally paid for and out the door at 10:25pm. Until they get their act together, I would suggest not going here unless you have no time restrictions. Our total stay was from 6:45- 10:25"
Jacquelyn V.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2018,"First time coming to this location. Don't go there unless you are ok with waiting for double the time they tell you. After telling the manager of what happened, he can care less. So if the manager is giving poor customer service .... you can expect just as much from the rest of their staff."
Terrell H.,"Temecula, CA",2,3,14,1.0,1/1/2018,"After a 40 minute wait and a mistake of available table which turned out to be a error sending my party back to waiting up front only you get seated at a table too small for my party. Service was slow, wait for the food was a bit extensive and the bathroom was out of toilet paper. I don't plan on visiting this location any time soon."
Brianna V.,"Oceanside, CA",135,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,"It was so unorganized, the wait was approximately 55 mins but waited almost two hours to be sat . The hostess had a rude attitude when customers when get inpatient and ask how much more time . Everyone's buzzer things were going off and yet the hostess took a very long time to seat everyone . Never going to this location ever again ."
Goose N.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",1,29,12,5.0,12/12/2017,My bride and I had dinner tonight before Christmas shopping  We had a fabulous time  Our server was Seyanna  She was fabulous  We really liked how the servers cover for each other when the others are busy  The host even did a great job  Got us seated right away  Cheesecake for being new did an amazing job  I hope they continue to strive to be great  The deserve more than 5 Stars
Carla H.,"Vista, CA",13,193,37,1.0,11/22/2017,This place is weak and wack a sad excuse for a restaurant. Honestly they are not ready to be open for business the experience was the worst that i have ever had at any of there locations. Service was terrible and lack luster the server did not know anything!!! On top of is all my food was ice cold. I can't with this location cold bread and food but you want me to pay over $20 a dish yeah ok!!! I'm good
Amy E.,"Oceanside, CA",1,20,,2.0,12/28/2017,"I'm so disappointed to have to write this review because the food is good. However service is very poor. At the lunch hour on a weekday there were 4 people behind the host stand all with their backs turned and only acknowledged us after 5 minutes of being the only ones standing there. Then we were told there would be no wait but the host walked away. Then another turned around to address another party that came in after us, which she promptly seated. We were both two tops. At that point the host that acknowledged us walked back over and tended to another party. No one even looked at us. Again there was no crowd and 4 people behind the stand!  We left and went to Yardhouse. Another all American menu with good food and actually pays attention to guests. Please step up your service game Cheesecake Factory. This was beyond disappointing."
D B.,"Oceanside, CA",2,110,7,5.0,12/9/2017,"My wife and I ate here last night for the first time. Our friends arrived 20 min prior and made a reservation for a party of 4. Once we arrived, we waited 10 min. Keep in mind this was on a Friday at 5pm. We had one girl seat us, but turned it over to a different server named Kara G. She checked on us in a reasonable amount of time and was pleasant.  I read other reviews where they waited an hour for food. We had our food in 20min. Not bad."
Tammy V.,"Oceanside, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Very unorganized with sitting customers. The wait was over one hour  long and when got buzzed, no table was ready. Staff  in the  front  is rude when you ask a question."
