Jack T.,"Oceanside, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/25/2017,Register station have elbows invading your space. The employees hang there arms over the edge as if it's a sofa but they don't care. Told 2 staff to move their elbows which there was a 3rd. And!! The employee smoke breaks are in the front which is ghjhheeeeeeeeettto!!
Chuck H.,"Perrysburg, OH",0,2,,2.0,12/24/2017,"Our friends came in 15min after we put our name in. They were at least 6-7 people behind us. They were seated next to us before we were seated. They were seated, served, and left before we even had our meal on the table. When food was served each meal was served individually with a 3-4 min time gap between 4 people. All 4 meals had a missing food item, sauce, over cooked or undercooked. Horrible experience. Employees and management need more training and not at customers expense! Management comped 1 meal. Wait maybe 1yr before going. They might have their act together by then."
Kaylie D.,"Vista, CA",0,2,3,1.0,1/1/2018,"I will never come back to this location. Holly was very kind and so was our server, but the general manager Mark Gardner was was so awful. He was rude, condescending and did not know his menu. I ordered the chicken picatta, which is my favorite dish, and twice is came out with the wrong pasta. I have had the dish numerous times so I know what angel hair pasta is supposed to look like and the pasta was clearly not angel hair. Mark, the general manager, made me feel so dumb and told me he has worked there for 18 years and that is what their angel hair pasta looks like even though Holly thought that the pasta did not look like angel hair. He even went so far as to bring the pasta before it was cooked to show the difference between the pastas which was plain condescending and a way to rub It in my face tp show that I was wrong. The chefs re made a fresh batch of angel hair pasta and put It to go with my meal because my company had been finished eating for over 30 minutes and I was tired of waiting. This time my pasta was actually angel hair pasta and there was a clear difference. Mark did not even care to come check to see if there was a difference. I showed holly the new pasta and she saw what angel hair is supposed to look like and we agreed It was not what I had been served the prior two times. It's sad that I had to teach the manager what their dish should look like. Mark is the worst manager I have ever encountered.   He made me question my knowledge of the dish and It turns out I was right and he was wrong. Mark should not be a manager he is way too rude and does not even know his own menu even though he has been there for 18 years. For someone who has worked there so long his lack of attention to detail is appalling he should not hold a position of that level."
Carole U.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,14,,1.0,12/5/2017,"Before I go into the nightmare that is The Cheescake Factory Carlsbad, I want to preface it by saying I have been a Cheesecake Factory customer for almost 40 years.  My experience was so bad that tonight I did what I only do under extreme circumstances, both good and bad:  I wrote to Corporate.   To you first-time customers:  Do NOT judge all the Cheesecake Factories based on your experience at this one!  Yes, the food is pricey, but usually you get plenty of it and it's high-quality.  This location, as far as I'm concerned, needs to shut down, and the entire staff should be trained, tested, retested and retested some more.  Only after they pass the standard to which The Cheesecake Factory is held, should they reopen.  That will be the only way this place survives, if their current negative reviews continue. Last night I placed an order through Doordash - a Veggie Burger, the Factory Chopped Salad, a side Green Salad and the Famous Factory Meatloaf.  That was my first mistake and they'll be hearing from me, too.  After about a half hour I received an email from Doordash saying the Veggie Burger was ""unavailable"" and they'd removed it from my order and credited my card.  Ooookay.  I called the restaurant directly to see how to add to my order and was told I had to place it through Doordash.  They also said they'd rush it through and make sure it would be delivered with my original order.  Granted, they fell all over themselves apologizing, and they claimed they'd been having trouble with Doordash being able to connect with them, but I wasn't offered a thing for my inconvenience.  Ten or fifteen minutes later, the restaurant called me directly to tell me now the Meatloaf was ""unavailable.""  At this point, it was past time for my order to have been delivered so I just cancelled the whole thing.  They did admit they'd run out of both items...and they were still going to be open for 4 more hours! Today, I took my elderly mom out for the afternoon.  My mom is 91.  She is recovering from hip surgery.  It's hard for her to sit in a restaurant for a long time so it's easier to order food to-go and take it home so she can enjoy her food in comfort.  We were in the neighborhood so we decided to place a to-go order - the same stuff we'd ordered last night, plus 2 slices of cheesecake, knowing we would be set for at least 2 dinners.  We were told it would take 20-25 minutes for our order, which, looking around the not-so-crowded place, seemed like an awfully long time, but we sat down and waited.  It turned out they were very generous with their estimate.  When we arrived we were the only customers at the bakery counter, which is where you place to-go orders.  All of a sudden, at least a dozen people came in at the same time.  They all placed orders to-go.  Then more people came and placed orders.  A couple of parties came and ate in.  One by one all the people waiting for their orders got them and left.  After 40 minutes I asked how much longer it would take.  2 employees looked at me and asked me if I'd checked in.  Checked in?  What does that mean?  I'd been sitting next to the counter for 40 minutes waiting for my order - and they were the ones who took it!  They asked me again if I had checked in and looked like deer in headlights when I told them my name.  By this time it's been an hour, my mother had gotten up and was shuffling her way to the car, and they tell me the order had been sitting waiting for quite awhile, waiting for me to ""chek in.""  Wait, what???  They'd been calling out names for all the other to-go customers so we were waiting for ours to be called.  One of the employees finally went to get the manager, who, like last night, fell all over herself apologizing, but also made excuses about shift change, breaks, and blah, blah, blah.  They did take off the cost of the cheesecake off my $60 bill, but after 2 bad experiences in less than 24 hours and my poor mom having to sit for over an hour, it wasn't enough, as far as I'm concerned.  And after reading all the other negative reviews of the past 2 days, I know I'm not alone.  It will be a long time before I go back to this one, if ever.  It's too bad - I have 2-$50 gift cards for the place and will either give them away or wait until I find a better location.  In the meantime my 1-star review will stand, at least until I hear back from Corporate."
Johnnie J.,"Vista, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/4/2017,"My wife, son, and I stopped by to try the new restaurant. We sat in the outside dining and it was a little cool so ordered 2 hot teas. When they brought our teas both water containers had cold water, took about 10 minuets before anyone showed up to bring some hot water. Lady at next table ordered hot tea and also got cold water. Table to our left had been waiting 40 minuets for their appetizer and was getting ready to just leave when their meals arrived, don't know if they got their appetizer. We waited almost 2 hours to get our food. Tasted ok but when we got home I had the worst food poisoning I've ever had and my son was up all night with diarrhea. Monday evening and I still feel sick!"
James S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,7,1,2.0,12/2/2017,"Disappointing experience. What should have been a 1 hour meal turned out to be a 2.5 hour nightmare. The food was what you'd expect but the service was beyond reproach. We asked to speak to a manager who came by the table and offered a very poor and awkward excuse about the server with absolutely no satisfaction to their customer. A professional restaurant organization offers to rectify and incentivize the customer by offering to comp something (we weren't even offered a slice of cheesecake for our troubles) or a discount for a future return. Our bill for 5 of us was $180 so you'd think they might want to keep a local who would frequent this new location several times a month. But no, nothing except an awkward excuse about the server. Just not acceptable.  I've been a big fan of CAKE and frequent customer but there is no excuse to have your evening ruined when there are so many other options to choose from. I would not recommend this location as their arrogance is just not worth the hassle."
Katie L.,"Vista, CA",23,29,,2.0,12/10/2017,"We came here for a bite before strolling around the mall for a lazy afternoon. The server was really nice, but the service was very slow. It was just 2 of us as well. Hubby had a sandwich and I had a small salad and soup. It shouldn't have taken over an hour to get those 2 items.  When the food arrived it was luke warm. The server kept saying she is checkijng to see if the food is ready in the kitchen but when it came to the table cold, it's almost as if it was sitting there but maybe the server didn't realize? Who knows. Better luck next time."
Daniella P.,"Vista, CA",48,39,4,1.0,12/12/2017,Omg!!!!! The service here sucks so bad!!!!!! They missed two of our orders we had to wait 49 minutes to get our to go piece of cheesecake we were there for three hours!!! And that was a 2 pm lunch! Not busy at all!!!cray!!
Catie L.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/18/2017,I am shocked at how bad their customer service was. Will not be coming back to this location. Waitress walking past dropped tray of ice tea all over my husband. Manager came to apologize but did nothing else. We ordered a mushroom appetizer and 10 minutes later she came back and said the kitchen did not prep for that so they wouldn't be able to make it. The butter that came with bread had something in it and I asked for a new one and got attitude. It took 50 minutes to get our meal. I asked for the check and it took her 15 minutes to bring the check. The whole thing was a mess. That was 2 hours of my life I can't get back
John H.,"Carlsbad, CA",90,7,,4.0,12/17/2017,"Love the food. Prices are a bit high for what you get, serving sizes are big, had leftovers. Expect a long wait, they do not take reservations but you can check in and go shopping in the mall. We waited a hour and a half on a Saturday night."
Taylor B.,"Fallbrook, CA",40,30,,2.0,12/12/2017,Beautiful place. Food is mediocre and so is service. Couldn't even catch the attention of anyone when I needed a small plate for my buffalo wings (which calls for a plate). The wings were amazing but my pasta was so salty and the truffle honey chicken was terrible!
Fernanda R.,"Vista, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2017,"Worst birthday experience every ! first of all the wait. Then we ordered, they switched servers the first server forgot to put in one of my friends food. We finished eating, but her food was no where to be found. When the serve came to see if we were fine she asked where her food was he asked what did you order? Really an hour later an you cant figure it out? We ended up getting it to go. My sister had told them it was my birthday they told us they didn't do anything for birthdays unless we ordered cheesecake. Well we had ordered 3.  And they still didn't do anything but put it in a to go box with my friends to go food. Great first time dinning in this location. They need to hire experienced servers not amateurs that don't know what they are doing."
Jamie C.,"Vista, CA",0,29,,5.0,11/30/2017,"Came here  for first time during lunch time. 1ish. Lovely atmosphere(good.fpr date night):) . The food was delicious and yummy chessccake. The food took a while but they were Pretty busy. Good, friendly service. I'll go again and see How It is.:)"
Yanira D.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/3/2017,This is a new location so we didn't go with super high expectations especially after reading some of the reviews but we love Cheesecake Factory and wanted some late dinner  so we headed anyways party of four with a toddler  they estimated about a 40 min wait at 9 pm little long but ok  it ended up being little less than 30 cool got seated and our server seyanna  came in right away to grab our drinks from their one sure food took a little longer than usual to get to our table  then again like I said we didn't set our expectations to high but my 5 stars mainly go to our server even though the food was taking a little while she  kept coming around making sure we had drinks or wanted more bread she was extremely friendly when the food did come out everything was great  honestly we had a better experience than in any other cheesecake minus food taking a tad bit longer to. Come out so I would say if possible give this place a little break their new and you can tell their trying will be coming back soon
Alina S.,"Vista, CA",0,4,2,2.0,12/11/2017,"I went here with my mom for her bday last week and the food was great...however the service was horrible. They hired a ton of unprofessional and unexperienced people. You would expect Cheesecake Factory to be a higher standard. Never coming back here again, I'll just go to the escondido location instead!"
L C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/9/2017,"Food as always good. Busboy Bryce Langston was very attentive and took care of bringing our missing bread and butter, half way done w our meal. The food service person must hv been busy."
Catherine E.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,41,13,3.0,11/18/2017,"The food was good, and our server was nice. But he completely ignored the fact that it took forever to get our main dishes served. Then it took a long time to get our slice of cheesecake. Then it took over 20 minutes to get our credit card back and the bill to sign. We spent 2.5 hours here. If it didn't take so long I'd give this place 4 stars."
Anthony N.,"Anaheim, CA",212,9,,1.0,12/12/2017,I ordered 2 slices of cheese cake and it took 40 mins to deliver from the cheesecake bar. How does it take so long to take 2 precut slices of cheesecake  and put them into a to go box. When I left I got to work only to realize I had received the wrong item. If I'm paying 10 dollars a slice with tip (that they didn't deserve) you expect decent service and the correct food. I won't return to this location.
Aaron G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,13,1,1.0,12/26/2017,"I was expecting to enjoy a nice lunch as I have at other Cheesecake Factories around the country; Unfortunately, that was not the case. The service was not good at all; the waiter made a feeble attempt to seem attentive and friendly but was otherwise preoccupied with joking around and making fun of patrons with his fellow servers.  Then, came the orders... one of the orders had specific dietary restrictions due to allergies, none were followed and when we identified the problem, the server acted like we were wrong for having restrictions and continually rolled his eyes b fire sending the dish back for the correct order. Additionally, another order was ordered mild and wow, was it spicy; Yet again, it was our fault they messed the order up.  It was my daughters birthday as well and we requested a simple birthday ice cream cup with a song, they delivered it to the wrong table and sang for a couple who informed them it wasn't theirs.  The serving staff said ""we happy unbirthday to you"" and mumbles ""you ungrateful **bleep**!""  What professionalism.  My daughter got a cup after another member of our table reminded the server. The coup de grâce was when the server told me they would comp the messed up meal but then informs me that it was billed again because someone has to pay for it and he doesn't want it to come out of his pay.  SERIOUSLY! I have to cover your mistake, no accountability at all! This is what this location has to offer... subpar service, food that is a gamble because you never know if you'll get what you order and if you have dietary restrictions, watch out because you're a big inconvenience to this establishment since the manager blatantly supports his incompetent staff.  I do not recommend this place to anyone... better to eat at Panera or Islands on the other side of the mall"
D C.,"San Diego, CA",3,79,1,2.0,12/3/2017,"Large Catering ordered for pick up at 5 ..got to restaurant - no food order not placed. Finally got food at 6 . One of the managers was very rude about it all . Tim another manager worked his butt off to make it right. He would be the only reason why I would ever return - appreciated his follow through .  Only reason why this isn't 1 star . Food was really sub par. Pot stickers horribly salty, chicken picatta was mostly pasta - very little chicken. Avocado egg rolls - just soggy - had to throw it away. Evelyn's pasta - pasta not cooked... 25 guests sadly not impressed. I understand they just opened and one can attribute the poor food to a very rushed order but just a bad experience all around. Used to love the Cheesecake Factory..."
