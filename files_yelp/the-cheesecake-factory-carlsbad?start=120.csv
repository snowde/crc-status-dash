Lisa L.,"Vista, CA",18,33,43,2.0,11/18/2017,"Went here tonight (Saturday), knowing they just opened.  It was busy, but waited less than 20 minuets for an outside table.  It was a little chilly-they did have some heaters, but not near our table in the center of the patio.  We were seated at about 5 pm-still kind of early.  Our waitress took our drink orders, but kept forgetting things.  We ordered appetizers and dinner right away.  Appetizers took about 1/2 an hour to arrive.  Dinner was about another 1/2 hour behind that.  The waitress had 3 outside tables, but kept disappearing.  My daughter ordered a well done burger, but it was raw.  We had it taken off the bill because we didn't want to wait another hour for a new one.  We were going to take some cheesecake home, but it was 6:30 by the time the waitress came back and we were afraid it would take her a half hour to get it and by then we were cold and just wanted to go home.   The rest of the food was mediocre.  With the long wait and bad wait service -I say they have a lot of kinks to work out!"
Alexis M.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/4/2017,Always have good experiences but not this location... was freezing. You'd think they would have some type of warmers with people sitting inside the mall. The mall sliding doors never closed I just wanted to take my food to go by the time I got it... plus they were out of sooo many things I just kept getting told no. Food was good though.
katie s.,"Oceanside, CA",3,21,59,5.0,11/16/2017,"great food.  excellent service.  the culture of the staff there makes for happy employees.  the menu is a bit overwhelming, but i went with a large party & everyone got something different & everyone's choices were delicious.  we also got their famous cheesecakes....  mmmmmmmm.  worth it to just have dessert because the cheesecakes are huge!"
Tanner Y.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,4,1.0,12/27/2017,"I am SHOCKED. In fact, shocked is an understatement. I came in with a large party of just over 20 people, so of course I expected the whole thing to take a really long time, but it was worse than I thought possible. After waiting an hour for some tables (because of a reservation mistake) we sat down. One waiter took drink orders of one row of the party, and 10 minutes later a different waiter came to take the drink orders of of the other row of the party. The two people at the end of the tables didn't get their waters until 30 minutes after the rest of the table, after asking 3 times. Then, they sent the appetizer order in literally 3 times and brought out like 20 plates of food and we only touched about 10, leaving 10 plates completely wasted. The entrees came out quick and everyone was done eating in about an hour. AND THEN... wait for it... IT TOOK THEM 2 AND A HALF HOURS, that's right HOURS, TO BRING CHECKS OUT. They brought out 2 checks right away, then a couple more after 45 minutes, then the rest except for 2 another 45 minutes later. Every single check they brought out was wrong. Mixed up orders after they triple checked what items were on what tab. Then after the 2 1/2 hours those final people finally got their checks, Myself being one of them. BUT the only reason we even got our check was because we went up to the register and it turned out they hadn't even started processing our check yet. Thank God we demanded they process it or who knows how much longer we would have had to wait. Plus they had been in possession of our debit card for about an hour. We were the only people in the restaurant because they had closed while we were waiting for our checks that, might I remind you, took 2 1/2 hours to come out after the hour or so from when everyone was done eating. No apologies from the manager, no nothing. They didn't even bother giving us an  explanation or an excuse, they were silent. Hardly any employee presence. Please spare yourself the stress and frustration and visit the Escondido location or anywhere else but this Cheesecake Factory. The poor girl who's birthday it was had to wait for everyone's check to come out before she would leave, what a 21st birthday, she will spend the rest of her life remembering her 21st birthday as a day of neglect and disrespect from this place. No apology from the company will make up for that."
Sook S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/15/2017,"First time going with friends and family the entire staff was so nice, food was amazing and yes the cheesecake is just everything so many to choose from.  CJ great and informative. Cassandra manager so courteous. Linda and Tim were great too."
Monique S.,"Oceanside, CA",71,2,,2.0,12/24/2017,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory but I definitely won't be back to this one for a few years now until they can get their business together. It was my birthday and I had a party of 25. I expected a good wait time which they quoted me 2 hours after I had stood at the counter for 20 minutes waiting to be quoted by a manager. We checked with the restaurant periodically as our quoted wait max time approached however we kept being told they were waiting for 1 more table. 3 HOURS later, we were finally seated and ordered drinks and apps. The apps came out Farley quickly but had to wait another 25 minutes for  glasses of water and other beverages. When we got our drinks we placed our food orders with our 2 waiters. And had to wait now another hour for our food. Due to the poor communication between the waiters, food came out wrong, not at all what we asked for, and COLD! We were irritated but didn't want to have to wait again for them to remake it so we sucked it up. After our meals we of course wanted cheesecake. Some orders were taken right away and others had to wait yet another 20 minutes for anyone to come back to our table. 15 minutes from then we got our dessert. You can't mess up cheesecake so that was the only positive meal of our visit. As we finished up we requested checks and explained how we were splitting them. It took another hour for them to get our checks together and even then they were double charging people, adding things from other bills to the wrong persons tabs. Again, poor communication and lack of attention. After having to stand at the register bugging them for our cards and change back so we could leave, we finally got everything and practically ran outta there. A nice dinner turned into a chaotic 6 hour visit."
Gibson B.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,2,5.0,11/12/2017,"How cool is it to have a Cheesecake Factory in Carlsbad? We have been fans since the 1980s and we were regulars in the Marina Del Rey and West Palm Beach locations, but having one here now is awesome this is by far one of the nicest restaurants in the city. If you are arguing over who wants what to eat, this is the place. The menu is an encyclopedia of edible wonders. We were treated to Gold Tickets for the training opening and we were completely delighted. The consistency is always there at CHeesecake but they were jumping through hoops to see that we had a perfect day, as well as those around us. The place was buzzing with energy. Our server Eric was training and what he lacked in beer knowledge he more than made up for with being just as nice as a person could be. He had a pro from another location named Jeremy who clearly knew what the program was and was proud to offer it up. Even the folks from other locations were amped. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (my all time fav). The serving was so big I ate half the night we came home for dinner and the other half of the left overs in the middle of the night last night. LOt's of fresh shrimp and tender chicken with tri-colored buttery pasta, holy smokes I can't wait till Tuesday and their grand opening. MY wife had an Asian Chicken Salad (another Cheesecake classic) my daughter had the Orange Chicken, truly one of the best I have ever had. The chicken is first cooked to perfection in a light batter but the real deal with this dish is it is fresh orange. You can taste the zest. Nothing fake, all real and simple the very very best. We had lettuce wraps for starters. Many perfect butter leafs with sprouts, carrots, perfectly grilled chicken sa-tay and other fun stuff to wrap in them and some delicious sauces peanut, chili and chimichurri .  Dessert was of course cheesecake and as always it lived up to it's reputation for being some of the very finest in the world. Yummy Key LIme Mango and also a 30th Anniversary Chocolate we finished neither between three of us, but we sure did that night.  Phillip from  the Cerritos location was like a conductor seeing that all ran efficiently and covering all the new waiters. Looking around we could see many happy customers eating dishes I can't wait to get my hands on. The place is run by a sharp friendly guy Mark the General Manager. Another Marina Del Rey transplant who managed to keep an incredibly busy place on track all the while comfortably saying hi and greeting guests as if it were his private party in his home. All of his associates are just so positive and love their jobs. Tim his Assistant Manager made us feel quite to home as well. Everyone did.  What a treat it is to have The Cheesecake Factory in our community and we will surely be regulars."
Patti W.,"Oceanside, CA",20,2,,3.0,11/25/2017,"I understand that this is a new restaurant but this is a major chain and they need to get additional kitchen help or train the chef to speed up food preparation. It took forever to get our meals. My first visit was for lunch on a weekday. They were out of a potato cheese appetizer we ordered. My next visit they were out of white rice for my chicken entree. That was at 3:00 on a Saturday. Doesn't anyone else plan to order a dish with rice on a Saturday night? There's a grocery store across the street. My third visit I decided to avoid the long delay to get my food and ordered to go. They put me on hold to transfer me to the bar. Of course I was disconnected. They said to pick up in 15 minutes but after my previous experiences, I waited 25 before picking up. It still wasn't ready. On the upside, the food was good and our waiters were polite. I just don't like to wait an excessive amount of time for everything from ordering, food delivery, the bill and the return of a credit card. Leave yourself plenty of time if you dine here."
