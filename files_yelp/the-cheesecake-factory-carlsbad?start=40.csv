Sandra G.,"Fresno, CA",72,35,81,5.0,12/5/2017,"The food here was incredible, I ordered crispy chicken costalleta and my husband ordered coconut Thai chicken and loved it !! We ordered butter pasta at for my daughter and of course, like every three-year old she just took a few bites and left the rest.  Our waitress Seyanna  was awesome, we highly recommended you request her when you come to cheesecake."
Ben A.,"La Jolla, CA",0,5,18,5.0,11/20/2017,"We had a great time here. This place is new and very refreshing. The appetizer and food was great. We order appetizer first and by the time we finished the food came out I can see why some people complain about the food preparation time , they cook everything fresh so it take time to get them ready , just remember this is not fast food place."
R N.,"Long Beach, CA",36,19,7,3.0,12/5/2017,This place is still working out some kinks. Service was soooooooo slow........... Calamari was a little soggy and all the breading came off.  We also had the wings - not bad but not worth the cost.   Tried the Chicken Bellagio and that is definitely enough food for 2. Glad that there is a Cheesecake Factory closer  to us now but Yard House opens up soon and they might give this place a run for their money!  Yard house always has amazing food but again this place opens up in a few weeks so we'll see.  Back to this review... it took 20 mins to get our appetizer and we prob should have complained about the soggy calamari but there were like 50 servers running around but no one stopped to help us or check in on us.  A little frustrating but hopefully service is a little better and faster as everyone figures out what they should be doing.
Jadyn S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,"Me and 3 friends came in to celebrate my brothers birthday. Upon placing our order (8:00pm) we sat around and talked per usual. Food finally comes in (9:20) we don't complain and start eating. No problem with the food. However the FEMALE MANAGER . Came up to us and told my brother ""STOP Leaning in MY chairs "" she then started to tell us we will receive no discount and began LITERALLY laughing at our request of some sort of compensation for the error, which we would've been fine without if she didn't start laughing , and my brother was beginning to look worried and sad. Keep in mind we came here for his birthday. The COLD food was decent , and the FEMALE manager kept laughing and pointing at us with other workers. She is extremely unprofessional , impolite and a terrible manager. Will never be back here unfortunately this place is so close  to home. Our combined bill was over hundreds of dollars. Not a problem but after finally walking out at (11:00pm) the same FEMALE manager was still laughing about It and mocking us completely. TERRIBLE SERVICE Every employee refused to give us the female managers name. She's definitely a terrible manager"
Arsie S.,"Long Beach, CA",14,1,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Currently live in the east coast, anytime I've gone to Cheesecake Factory our there they were faster than most places i ever been to about seating people. They got things done deal fast. Customer service was excellent, never had any workers give attitude when people were getting frustrated or upset. But this one here definitely don't know the meaning of customer service or anything. They give attitude when they told us it would be a 2 and half hour wait for 20 ppl reservation so we waited the time they told us and then we got back to see if our table is ready and they are still saying it would be another hour. So be aware that you don't have a big party bc you won't get in anytime soon. Fuck this place !"
Valentino K.,"Bernal Heights, San Francisco, CA",179,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Debra Debra Debra (server)‍ Took over an hour to get our food and by the time it comes out all the plates are lukewarm and they brought out the wrong order for my mom. We all start eating our plates but my poor mom is waiting for someone to correct her food. Debra comes back with no apology/ no urgency to fix the problem (doesn't even say if my moms order is being redone or not) then a Manager comes by and apologizes and says my moms food is cooking and a second manager comes by later and says she'll re-make all the plates for us  so that it's warm (very nice of the managers, thank you!). This takes another hour for all our food to come out hot with my moms correct order! By this time we're all pretty done so we take a couple of bites and ask Debra for boxes (another 30 mins). A manager comes and offers us some cheesecake on the house (thank you again) and Debra takes our order not tooo long after and we joke it'll take another 30 mins..... it took another 30 mins. We take a couple of bites and ask for the check and some boxes (15-20 mins) when she dropped off our check and disappeared again we flagged down a different server and asked her to run the card because we wanted to leave and weren't gonna take our chances of waiting another 30mins. We were there for over 3 hours.  Both Managers and the rest of the staff were great and we really appreciate you taking care of us and being so sincere. As for Debra, she was nice and tried to be upbeat throughout the whole incident but it was rude to not apologize until the very end for messing up the order and being extremely slow with service especially because we were there for 3 HOURS. Debra definitely needs some additional training/ a good talk about how to do her job."
Caroline K.,"Carlsbad, CA",15,13,2,4.0,12/28/2017,"As many other yelpers have expressed, the reviews for this location are far less than any other location. To avoid the crazy waits I placed a togo order. I spoke with the hostess Kaylor (Taylor?) and she guided me through the menu as my family member has major allergies. She was extremely knowledgeable on what they could and could not order and expressed great concern and kindness which was refreshing. After placing my order I came to pick up my food. The food itself was o-kay nothing to brag about but nothing really to complain about. I would consider coming back to this location just for the customer service as long as we don't have to wait a long time."
Jav Gonzalez J.,"Vista, CA",83,26,2,2.0,1/8/2018,"I was So Excited when i found out they were opening a new location close to my House. The First time was an Ok Experience, but the second time, oh my goodness! First of all, we waited 20-35 minutes to be seated ( 2 guests) we ordered 2 glasses of wine and an appetizer, the appetizer took almost 30 minutes to arrive to our table, and we thought oh well maybe they're really busy ...anyways, after we finished the appetizer we decided to order right away just because of the time the appetizer took to come out, sure thing, 20 minutes passed, 30 minutes passed, and we started seeing other tables getting their appetizers and dinners but US. so we're like what happened ( did our waitress forgot to send our order before she went to break) but then the breaker wasn't really checking on us, at one point my friend yelled his name and asking, where was our food? he replied "" I don't know, let me check "" so he came back and told us that the kitchen was still working on it, at this point 45 minutes already has passed, Manager comes by and apologizes for the long wait, and he blamed the kitchen. Note: by now our wine Glasses  were empty, neither the waiter or the manager noticed it. we didn't even had water :-( so our food came ( the Shepherd's Pie )  there were not Peas, Zucchini , the Delicious Mushroom Gravy was missing, the Ground meat was very dried. in other words: The Dish was Very very dried ( They Rushed it) . and i know this dish very well from preview visits, Very Disappointed  :-(  Cuz i always expect to have a great time at the CheeseCakeFactory."
Ladona A.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/9/2018,"Took my granddaughter and her family there last night for her birthday.  My grandson ordered a burger...sorry we are out of burgers.  How about a turkey burger.  No, no turkey burgers.  My granddaughter ordered a pasta dish from their specialty menu.  Sorry we are out of that.  I'm not sure who they sold it to since the place was almost empty and we were there at 6pm.  I'm not impressed with them at all!"
Jacqueline C.,"Carlsbad, CA",204,22,19,4.0,12/30/2017,"Good food, great drinks. Festive during the holidays. Fun, exciting, kid friendly, wish it was a little bigger!  They need a little more organization with staff or need more staff. We will be back."
Zack B.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/16/2017,"A really awful experience with my girlfriend and I. I am a previous employee and we were treated poorly and disrespectfully. My girlfriend and I waited over an hour to eat. We sat down and after having an earful from a rude hostess, the manager walked up to where we were sitting. KASSANDRA was loud, rude and had my girlfriend embarrassed. Other tables were glaring at Kassandra in awe. We walked out, and my girlfriend was extremely upset with the way we were treated. We will definitely not going back! Also made a yelp just for this review, that's never happened before!"
Natalie M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,20,3,1.0,12/3/2017,"If I could give 0 stars I would.  I just finished eating at this restaurant.  I am a loyal customer to the Cheesecake Factory, so when one opened closer to my house I jumped at the chance to go. The line was long, but it is a new restaurant. We waited a while but there were many other people who came after us who were seated before us. When seated I asked what bottle of champagne would be suitable for my father and I and the waited so ""he didn't know."" About 10-20 minutes after we sat down a couple sat next to us. We ordered an appetizer and waited more than 30 minutes for 4 dumplings. We waited for over an hour for our food. The couple next to us ordered and shortly after their food arrived, they ordered one of the same dishes we ordered. The waiter came up and said the food ""was being worked on."" Our food finally came an hour after we ordered it. Me and my mother's food came first and the waiter told my father ""your food will be out in 5 minutes, uh maybe."" I always get the pasta carbonara so I know how it is usually cooked. The dish I received was about 1/4 as big as it usually is and the chicken was extremely dry. My father's portion was extremely small as well. The couple who was sitting next to us, who ordered the same dish, had a bigger portion. I asked the waiter if they had changed the portion sizes, he said no. He brought his manager out and the manager said that they probably gave me the lunch size and that he would only make me pay for the lunch size. I asked the manager why the couple who came after us and ordered the same things as us received their food faster and he said he would look into and get back. We waited for him, he never came back. I wanted cheesecake but feared what mishap would occur if I asked this restaurant to serve me anything besides disrespect. We paid and left disappointed, disgusted, and hungry. I would have rather just lit a $100 bill on fire and I would have been more satisfied than eating here. What a waste! That meal was not worth the time or the money. I know this is a new location but the service shouldn't have been this bad! I will not be coming back. Your locations in Las Vegas and LA are amazing! This location is beyond poor."
Meagan H.,"Vista, CA",126,57,22,1.0,12/5/2017,So this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory! It all started about a week ago when I attempted to call the restaurant SEVEN times before someone stopped hanging up on me and  picked it up. Finally when I got a hold of someone they weren't even apologetic about hanging up on me. I was trying to see if I could schedule reservation for a work party of 15 people and the person rudely told me that they don't do reservations but that I could call ahead two hours before we wanted to come in to make sure that we got on the waitlist. Well Sunday comes around and one of our coworkers go to the cheesecake factory 2 1/2 hours before we intended to be there. Myself and the rest of the employees showed up at 7 o'clock like we were told to we are immediately told that we probably won't get to seats until 730 8 o'clock. Our buzzer doesn't go off until 820 and the hostess didn't even have our menus ready so we stood there for another five minutes waiting for her to get everything ready we then follow the hostess out to the heated patio where it is completely dead but we were supposedly waiting for one table to clear up so that they can make us a spot but I'm not exaggerating there was probably over 15 tables available. We then sit down where were supposed to they don't even create a table big enough for everybody the sat us two people short. We are then greeted by the waiter literally the first thing he tells us that the kitchen is backed up and that we may not be eating for a while. We attempt to order our drinks they are out of an espresso so one of the girls can't get her drink. We then give our orders for dinner they're out of two of the dishes that our table ordered we didn't get our dinner so almost 945 at night without order dessert they're out of one of the cheesecakes that one of the girls ordered we were compensated in anyway for any of the mistakes or inconvenience that they created. We then tried to pay with a gift card that was provided by our company to have a company dinner it wouldn't work which necessarily isn't their fault. They even screwed up how they brought out the cheesecakes somewhere meant to go Sam were meant to be at the table they then over brought us cheesecake and then when they realized it they took them away. It's really quite unfortunate that it was such a terrible experience because this is such a better location to where I live I absolutely love cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants but I don't think I will ever go to this restaurant again
Teri G.,"Vista, CA",0,4,1,5.0,12/26/2017,"I love the menu something for everyone.  I waited a  Month before I visited the new location.  I figured that would be smart as sometimes new restaurants need a bit of time to find their grove.  I was glad I waited everything was perfect. We went during the week to avoid the crowds.  The service was spot on, our server Ashley G was amazing very friendly and knowledgeable of menu items. We had a great meal, great service and outstanding dessert hazelnut crunch cheesecake is to die for. The whip cream alone taste like heaven.  I would recommend to family or friends."
Vanessa C.,"Oceanside, CA",14,11,,1.0,11/30/2017,"They don't take reservations...even though the site says they do. Since it's newly opened there will probably be a wait no matter what night you go, that I understand. What I don't understand is having staff and managers that all seem to have no idea what they are doing. We waited 50 minutes (checked in 3 times to make sure we hadn't been forgotten) for first available table, let them know we were ok with outside. During that 50minute wait we watched the patio go completely in seated, 7 total empty tables (more by the time we were seated). When I mentioned it to the hostess she let me know that their system for updating which tables were available wasn't working. She also let me know she couldn't leave the front so she had no idea which tables were open. I mentioned that the manager that had been up front earlier had just been outside and why had she not let them know and gotten some people seated, a shrug was all I got in response. We were then seated inside, which was still pretty packed, and a server got our drinks (wrong the first time, but fixed quickly). We were them notified that the gal that got our drinks was sick and had to go home...probably not the best thing to tell to the people she just served consumables to. Dinner service was slow, don't think that was the waiters fault...like I said...the section we were in was pretty slammed (while the patio was still pretty empty). Food was fine, my husband asked for no tomatoes in his pasta, that didn't happen. He didn't want to send it back at that point because we weren't sure how long that would take, instead he just picked them out. All in all just horribly miss managed and seemingly understaffed. If you have 3 hours to spare and aren't very hungry to start out with (because it will be a while till you actually are eating anything) then maybe give it a try, otherwise maybe stick with the Escondido location...it's farther but at this point you'd probably still be fed sooner! **the response from Cheesecake Factory below is the standard one you are going to receive from them...I don't need to go the extra mile to go through your website to address my ""concerns"". I'm not concerned, I'm upset that we wasted our time and money. Clearly ""addressing"" these things (which from most of the other reviews are common complaints across the board) with your team is not working!**"
June S.,"Henderson, NV",0,5,8,1.0,12/1/2017,"Stepping into the Cheesecake Factory in Carlsbad is like entering an alternative reality experience of a bumbling mass of stupidity and inefficiency.  I have frequented the chain in Henderson NV - where the food and service and take out have always been wonderful.   CF Carlsbad is the polar opposite & was not ready to open. It was crowded and as you entered you had to give the hostess your name in exchange for a buzzer.  The hostesses hang around inside a circular booth area.  So do all the people who have already gotten their buzzers because they have no place to sit.  The hostess says, ""come over here, I need your name"". But there is no way to walk over to her because of all the people waiting and leaning on her counter.  Finally, we receive a buzzer.  We opt to wait outside.  We notice the outdoor patio area is full of available tables.  We went back inside and asked the hostess if we couldn't be seated outside.  She replied that twe have to wait because hey have to ""stagger the chef"" &  every ten minutes they seat people.   Then our buzzer rings.  Along with three other buzzers.  There are now four sets of people whose buzzers all rang at the same time.  And inside this circular booth - there are two hostess and a seater girl standing around. Now they are too confused as what to do, because all four buzzers went off at once, so the lead girl gathers & collates stacks of menus.  She hands 4 pieces of paper to the seater girl.  The other hostess says, "" Move over here, get in line!"". We were sort of shocked at the commands.  Then the seater girl doesn't know what to do - so the menu hostess shoved a couple menus at her and the girl says "" Who are you? What's your name?"" Then she reads & picks up one of the four pieces of paper and takes us outside to a really nice patio area where the heat lamps ( we went for dinner) are physically touching this two seater table and places us in the table adjacent to the one that is uninhabitable because of the heat. Our table is wobbly, the legs were never adjusted to stabilize it. We ask the waiter to change tables.  He points to the next table with the heat lamp and asks us if we want to sit there.  We told him we couldn't because the lamp is on the chair.  He says, ""Oh. Yeah. Yes.  It is"".  He offers another table and tests it first and notices that one wobbles too.  We asked to be seated inside.  He says he has to ask the hostess if it is ok.  We wait for him to come back eventually, and he then escorts us inside. Our new waiter, Gus, was a delight and on the ball.  Drinks and hot bread came right away.  We order an appetizer salad and dinner.  Gus comes over and tells us it is his dinner time - he now gets to leave & have a break so he can eat, and he introduces us to his filler waitress, Justine. She's terrific, friendly, and experienced. The people next to us who came in after us get served. Hot appetizers.  Justine comes over again and asks us if we wanted our salads first.  We said yes, and since it was an appetizer salad we assumed it would come out before the meal.  She asked if we asked Gus to bring it out first.  I replied that I didn't think I had to  - she said she would check on the salads. She did stop by a few times to tell us it wasn't ready yet and she was sorry. Its about an hour into the ordeal.  In the meantime, while we are waiting, there are waiters and waitresses waltzing around the restaurant carrying peoples' dinner orders, trying to find where to bring them, asking the different tables if they ordered this and that.  The staff had no idea whose table ordered what food.  When I told one of the girls that the food she brought over was not my order, she asked me,"" Why did they tell me to bring it here then?"". Finally, I get my salad and dinner from another waiter .  My husband does not get his food.  We wait. Then yet another waiter comes by and asks if my husband ordered Salmon and a Salad and he says,""Yes. "" The table is so small, and the plates so big ( no room for the salad plate and the very large dinner plate) that the waiter is struggling because he has no place on which to put everything down. Justine to the rescue clears the bread basket & bread plates off the table.  And the food was ice cold.  It must have travelled all around the restaurant or have been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be picked up.  We decide to leave.  We tell the hostess why.  She says she is sorry and Justine comes over and says we should talk to the manager.  By this time my husband is outside and I await the manager. He tells me he is very experienced. He has worked at CF as a manager for a long time.  He is sorry.  He would like us to come back and give CF another chance. That's not going to happen in the near future. It was an experience like no other...There are no systems in place for anything - They are all winging it!"
Maria L.,"Oceanside, CA",41,6,1,2.0,12/8/2017,Ordering cheesecake is a big ordeal. It takes over 30 min to get your cake. Don't do it. I don't care how good it is. I'm not returning.
Katrina P.,"Oceanside, CA",59,11,3,1.0,12/10/2017,"Soooo we just left there, got there at 10:10 left at 11:30....i get it youre new, but really? It took 35 minutes for our food, with an anxious 7 yesr old.....food came out, plates had hand prints ALL OVER them. It was pretty nasty..now ive worked food, i get the line can be crazy, but plates should be cleaned and handled by one hand coming out.  I complained, they replated my food, which was cold...cold huevos rancheros. Mmmm. My sisters blueberries were shriveled. Literally raisins....it was uh...interesting. Come on guys, this is unacceptable...the manager comped my meal, thats it. Im still starving cuz i couldnt stomach the eggs. Also....please dont add avocado to a replated meal, when it isnt in tje description, people do have allergies. Im one."
Mr Y.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/3/2017,"Just finished eating here. Got the ""southern"" style chicken biscuits and gravy. Not southern. Not good. Barely even chicken. Gravy that was the same consistency and taste to sewage water. Mash potatoes were even bad..How do you mess those up?  I'm not a particular picky person. I rarely complain, and never leave yelp reviews. But this place is a rip off. The dish was worse than a Marie calendars frozen pot pie but 5 times more expensive. $50 for 2 dishes and a soda. A soda was $3.5....wtf. Soda hasn't gone up in price anywhere in years as demand has fallen. What the hell does this place think it is, a concert venue? Don't waste your time or money. As there are plenty of other places around that are much better. The waiter was chill thou. That's the only good thing to add. But I'd rather have terrible service and great food if that was a choice."
Carol C.,"San Diego, CA",0,64,,1.0,11/27/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is normally my favorite restaurant so I was excited when this location opened a mile away from my BFs house .  I can not stress enough that this was THE absolute WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Started with a $12 mai tai that was literally ALL ice .  I sipped about 2 oz of drink , MAX ,and the rest of the glass was just jammed with ice .  Ridiculous .  I should have sent it back but our waitress was too busy talking (f o r e v e r)  to a table of guys to even bother asking us if everything was ok . I also had to ask for bread like five times . And water.  I ordered a BBQ ranch chicken salad , which is normally huge at every other CF I have been to , all over the country .  Here , it was it only tiny with NO dressing , it had NO CHICKEN in it . Huh ????   I had already flagged down a bus boy to ask for salad dressing (waited 20 min for that ) before I noticed there was no chicken & by that time my BF and I were so disgusted& tired of waiting for EVERYTHING we just wanted to leave ,not wait another half hour for missing chicken.  BF got a (lousy) burger & cold fries .   On the way out we passed a newly opened Islands restaurant and wished we went there instead. It will be a long time before I return to this location . Hopefully they step up their game in the meantime . I get they have only been open for a couple weeks but when you go in to a huge chain like this you expect consistent food and (expensive ) drinks and this location fell WAY short . The bartenders , waitresses & cooks need to be MUCH better trained or this location will not survive .   It was a complete waste of time and money and both my BF and I actually left hungry ."
