Bill O.,"Moorpark, CA",3,94,143,4.0,12/16/2017,"I'm surprised to see all of the negative reviews for this place, I've never had a bad meal at any Cheesecake Factory. We didn't eat our main meal here, just stopped in for some cheesecake and they do that the best, so I can only speak to that."
Carl J.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",81,10,116,1.0,12/4/2017,I agree with all these other 1 star reviews. I Got food poisoning nuff said. Maybe after a year for them to get their shit together I'll give it another try until then No Thanks!
Stephanie D.,"Oceanside, CA",74,2,,1.0,1/7/2018,"my family and i decided to try out the new cheesecake factory in carlsbad, ca... we have the worst experience. to start , we waited 20 mins for our buzzer to go off, just to wait (standing up) 30 more after it went off to be seated. then we sat down, our waitress was really nice , soft spoken so couldn't hear her the first few times she spoke, but still nice. we ordered our dinner and waited. we waited for about 1 hour until we got our food. until then they kept pumping us with bread apologizing. when getting our food, it was absolutely terrible i ate maybe 2 bites. after eating, the waitress kept asking if i wanted a box to which i replied, ""no thank you it was not very good."" she apologized and then brought us our $100 check. i wanted to y'all to a manager but we had been at this restaraunt for almost 3 hours at this point so my husband wanted to leave. so here i am writing about how terrible our experience was. Absolutely gross and the service with a wreck."
Ulysses S.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/22/2017,"Went with friends and their machines to make mochas was ""broken"" already when the restaurant recently just opened. To top that off, one friend ordered a simple side of Mac and cheese, only to find that it wasn't cooked thoroughly and there was still MILK like substance at the bottom! Server was excellent and helped in every way, but wish I could say the same good things about the experience!"
Nichole S.,"San Clemente, CA",1,7,2,2.0,1/2/2018,"We ordered for pick up Monday evening around 5pm and it took me 20 minutes waiting on hold to finally place the order, which was painful as the girl seemed very unfamiliar with the menu. I ordered an appetizer salad that was supposed to include vegetables and croutons along with my meal and it came with two slices of cucumber and two pieces of tomato on top of a huge pile of lettuce. The chicken Romano was very good but the cheesecake was extremely disappointing. The girl put the containers in the bag on their sides and i could tell my Oreo slice was not made well to begin with. The layers were not even. IF we try this location again it will absolutely not be for take out."
Roxy E.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",1,17,4,1.0,12/16/2017,"Was just there at the bakery. Took about 30 minutes until I left the line. Unbelievably slow register people. One was just on the register doing something instead of helping the guy in front of me. The longest I have ever had to wait for a refrigerated cheesecake.  I did not stick around to wait that long for them to take my money. I can take it elsewhere. What a bad start for this business. If you can't handle your bakery,  good luck with your restaurant. Negative stars if I could!!"
Maria S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,12,2,1.0,11/17/2017,"I wish I could give zero stars. This is by far the worst service we have ever received anywhere. We ordered curbside pick up with 2 dinners and 2 pieces of what they're named for: cheesecake. My husband gets home with the food and no cheesecake. He calls the restaurant and tells the girl what happened. She says she'll have to talk to a manager and puts him on hold. After waiting 10 mins, he hangs up and calls back. This time it's a guy, husband tells problem and adds that he was already on hold for 10 mins. Guy says he has to talk to a manager, puts him on hold. After 8 mins, hubby hangs up and calls back. Gets another guy who asks if he's calling about the cheesecake, hubby says yes. Guy says we'll have it ready in a few minutes. Hubby explains we live over 20 mins away, he's not coming back. Guy says he has to talk to manager and, you guessed it, never comes back. Hubby calls again, gets another girl who says we can come and pick up the cheesecake. Hubby says no. Girl doesn't know how to credit us the money. Takes our phone number and says she'll call back. That was 20 mins ago. We have no money and no cheesecake. By now my husband is so angry he's no longer hungry and the food is cold anyway. I realize this place just opened. However, they are part of a huge chain, and as such they should have had their shit together before they ever opened their doors. We will never give them our money again."
Sanjiv M.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/6/2017,"Clearly this location has not worked out it's opening kinks/issues. I would have given them 0 stars, but alas, you have to assign at least 1 star to write a review. The service was marginal at best. We ordered the Parmesan Garlic Cheese Bread appetizer to start.  After a bit of waiting, we were told that they ran out of that. How do you run out of bread at 2:30 in the afternoon?!? My wife is vegetarian and we ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta, with the chicken on the side. The pasta arrived with pieces of chicken mixed in with the pasta.  Do yourself a favor and drive the extra distance and visit the locations in Escondido or San Diego. There is a reason their Yelp rating is so bad. At the rate rate this location is getting bad reviews, they'll be closed soon."
Lani K.,"Vista, CA",0,3,5,3.0,12/20/2017,"Food and service was good. My sister and I took my dad out for his birthday. Since we went at 3pm on a Wednesday it did not take long for us to be seated and get our food. We started out with the avocado egg rolls which were tasty. My dad enjoyed his Thai lettuce wraps, and I enjoyed my vegan cobb salad, but my sister's Evelyn's pasta was very plain and just ok. Definitely something we could have made better at home for 1/4 of the price. We told the waiter that it was my dad's birthday and ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go...but they didn't do anything special for him for his birthday. No free dessert or happy birthday or anything. That kinda bummed me out because my sister and I put in a huge effort to make this day very special for our dad, but there was no effort on the Cheesecake Factory's part. But my dad is a good sport and he didn't seem to care all that much. Overall, our experience was average."
Francesca M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/5/2017,"This is probably one of the worst customer service places I've gone too. First our appetizer didn't come out until the dinner came out and the lady said because we thought we'd want it together. She hadn't bother to ask. Then the checks took over 45 minutes to get rung out. The worst part is I asked for a refill of water & had to Ask again because she forgot, the whole meal I didn't get a refill & I ran out before we even started eating. Honestly, I prefer to drive to the Escondido one. The most terrible experience I've ever had in a restaurant."
FoodyNews 1.,"Temecula, CA",24,89,32,2.0,11/15/2017,"CHECK YOUR BILL,  their computer prices are HIGHER than menu prices. wonder how many thousands$$$ they make off this?    drink prices are also very very high  $14  martini's....$11 for a  basic small 8-10oz margarita cheap teq?   our bill for 3 of us was $143 one lunch salad, one lunch salmon and a dinner,  two apps and drinks.  yikes with no ocean view?.....BUT now the GOOD,  happy hour is pretty good instead of $12.50 its under $7 for food, drinks bout $6-7 ish.    food recipes are super GREAT.   for the first day opening they really had it all under control, in fact I was amased.  outside tables are very cool but they need fairy lights strewn along the outside to create more separation from  walkers! ha ha  also hey open up happy hour outside too now THAT would ROCK.     but check your bills"
Rich D.,"Vista, CA",1,8,,2.0,12/18/2017,"Decided to go here celebrate a birthday for my brother in law (his choice). Waited over an hour in the middle of the afternoon for a table on a Sunday afternoon. Having been to many other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, I was not surprised by the wait so we put our name down and walked the mall for a while.  After an hour, it turns out it wasn't worth the wait. The service was not good and our server made several mistakes which only made the whole experience even worse. My wife ordered the Renee's special (which she's had like 100 times) and asks for chicken salad on a baguette only to get turkey on a Brioche roll TWICE before actually getting the right sandwich. Of course, by this point everyone else is done and are now sitting and waiting for my wife to eat. No manager ever came by.  So maybe it's just the fact that the place is still new but I would think the managers would get that and be all over the mistakes to make sure you come back. Well, guess what. Won't be back. Heading over to Escondido where they actually care about you."
J L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,296,1,1.0,11/18/2017,The worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been too. I have never experienced such chaos in a restaurant. Not only did our order come out wrong but each of our dishes came out 10-15 minutes apart from each other. The couple next to us was pissed off as well because of the bad service they were receiving as well.
Victor M.,"Mansfield, CT",8,2,5,1.0,11/15/2017,"Even though we were sat quickly, the food was SUPER salty and uneatable. They took about an hour to get us our food and the appetizer never came. We were not even offered cheese for our pasta. The bread came right before our food after we asked for it. The waiter totally forgot about us. Manager was apologetic at the end and tried to compensate (which I really appreciate from him), but my standards for this restaurant are very low now. I do not recommend eating/drinking here, at least not for a while."
Todd W.,"San Diego, CA",3,248,4,2.0,12/6/2017,"First time to a Cheesecake Factory, I was pretty exited. We got our table after a 30 min wait. The wait was just fine you get a buzzer that works in the mall so we just walked around. Once seated we waited, and waited. We ordered drinks waited some more. All the steps of service were very slow. I ordered the mushroom burger but substantiated a veggie patty and fries. The patty was quite good I think it had quinoa and lentils in it. The fries were awful, tasted old. For desert I had to get some cheesecake! I ordered Adams favorite, I think its called that. It was peanut butter caramel and fudge. I was just too much for me. Like eating frosting."
Angela J.,"Vista, CA",6,8,2,2.0,12/2/2017,"So disappointed in you Cheesecake Factory! I love the one in San Diego and never had an issue. I was so excited about having one so close to home. I have just finished my second meal at your restaurant since you opened and it was a sad experience.  Let me be clear that the food is great and the wait staff are nice. The disconnect is the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get drinks, bread, food, the check, etc. last time, two people in our party of 7 never got their meal until we were ready to leave and we had to ask them to box it because we had to go. We ended up feeding them from all of our plates. The salad didn't come before the meal and we had to cancel our dessert because it didn't ever come until she brought the check. Through all that, we decided to give you another chance and it was the same wait issues. 15 minutes for drinks, 10 more to get our food ordered, felt like forever to actually get our food, missing sauce and she said they were making more for me, never got that at all.  Get it together people! I will not be back until I hear from enough people that the waiting has been eliminated and this location is up to par with the others I have been to."
Cheri B.,"Oceanside, CA",32,4,3,4.0,12/17/2017,"Recently met up with some friends here.  Service was great, food was great with ample proportions.  Our server was fantastic, gave our party separate checks without hesitation.  Dined outside which was fantastic.  Wish the happy hour area was bigger.  I will definitely be eating here again."
Ashley W.,"Oceanside, CA",17,8,,2.0,12/2/2017,"I was so excited that they opened a Cheesecake Factory at the Carlsbad mall. I went to lunch with my family, and although everyone is really nice, it took way too long for our food to come. When it did, my poached eggs were overdone & I was missing part of the item description (I got the eggs Benedict with bacon & grilled tomato) as they didn't add the grilled tomatoes. My husband's food didn't come at all, as apparently the server forgot to put it in, so it took another eternity for his meal to be prepared. Hope they get their act together soon!"
Andrew E.,"Carlsbad, CA",8,27,13,1.0,11/18/2017,"Not pleased. I ordered delivery from DoorDash. Order was wrong. DoorDash blamed the restaurant. Food was just , ok. Nothing special. Expensive for how bland. I literally threw it out on arrival. Gross. DoorDash customer service hung up on me when I wanted a resolution. DoorDash made the experience even worse. Restaurant is high grade cafeteria food"
Jeanine M.,"Oceanside, CA",11,35,42,4.0,11/18/2017,"They opened a few days ago. If you  are reading this anytime in November or possibly December of 2017. Be prepared to wait. One of the things that has to be worked through is flow in a new restaurant. Be prepared for long waits. Now that is out of the way. The food when you get it, is divine. I went for happy hour and I spent the whole time waiting for my food. The cocktails were awesome. The bar area inside is great right now because you can watch all the people that are just waiting to get seated.The restaurant has plenty of seating outside, where you can wait. The inside, near the bar is loud, it's the bar. I ordered off the happy hour menu. I ordered a cosmo, so good I ordered 2. My party also ordered the happy hour burger, warm crab and artichoke dip, buffalo ravioli  and avocado egg rolls. The food was delicious.We also ordered a celebration cake. The prettiest tastiest cake ever. Our server was great and she didn't pressure us to leave. So be patient, leave enough time for food it did take like 30 to 40 minutes to get food and 1 1/2 hours to get bread."
