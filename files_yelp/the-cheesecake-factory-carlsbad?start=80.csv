Reika M.,"Oceanside, CA",2,5,,1.0,11/18/2017,"I completely understand that they are just newly open.  BUT waiting 20 min with no service and finally asking someone to take our drink order to get any kind of service is ridiculous.  Finally someone takeS our order, our food came completely WRONG. both food! not one dish is wrong BUT BOTH! HOW!? Anyway, while waiting for our order to be corrected staff kept trying to deliver items to our table we didn't order!!! At the end of our meal, we also added to slices of cheese cake to go from our server, 15min goes by the same server comes back and says "" I know we'd like some deserts would you like me to bring the menu"" ... WHAT!?!? WE JUST ORDERED FROM U 15 MIN AGO..... Keep in mind still being patient and not irrate ... The manager comes to our table and SAYS "" you asked to speak with a manager"" nope we didn't!? Didn't even ask what was wrong, how can I help you , I understand stand my staff made a whole bunch mistakes let me make sure it's corrected ....NONE OF THAT!  She didn't get the details from her staff before even coming to our table ... It seems like EVERYONE NEEDS PROPER TRAINING with Customer Service. We spent almost 100 just on food that is basic!"
Maddi O.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",196,6,,5.0,12/30/2017,Very happy with the food and service. One plate was 3 mins late and the manager was more than nice to apologize and make everything better. Great customer service and would definitely recommend.
Pancho O.,"Oceanside, CA",29,20,2,1.0,11/22/2017,"No pros, but the cons are abundant...  1st... there is no where to sit while you wait. The bar is to full you have to stand and wait to sit down and get a drink, otherwise your other choice is to wait outside in the cold on the metal benches.  2nd... sat at the table for 1 hour before we were notified that the chef did not correctly make the sauce for my my bang bang thai curry. So it had to be remade and was given the choice to feed the others in the party or we wait for my food to be finished. We chose to wait for my food for another 30 minutes while they got the sauce right. Why did it take so long to notify me that we were waiting for my food to get cooked. 1.5 hours before we got food. 3rd... My friends fettuccine was less than al dente. The noodles were almost crunchy. Way undercoo ked! 4th... seated at the window booth of the mall entrance is not a great place to sit. All the passersby looking in at you while you eat. Had 1 guy flip me off. Definately not preferred seating.   The waiter Jorge was exceptional. None of the issues we experienced were due to his service.  Hopefully they work the kinks out of a new established restraunt."
James W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,67,84,3.0,11/26/2017,"If you are not in a hurry, Cheesecake Factory has a diverse menu and large portions. This location is brand new (Nov 2017) and already very busy. It's a great addition to the Carlsbad Mall & much closer than North County Fair. The food is tasty but can take awhile on the weekends. The ambiance is somewhat noisy & TVs showing sports are available in the bar, viewable from the front of the restaurant."
Christina M.,"Vista, CA",247,9,,2.0,11/17/2017,"I was so excited to have this location open near us in Carlsbad.  Got to the restaraunt about 11:30 am.  Waitress took forever to take our drink order, then our food order was another wait.  Finally placed the order for food an hour after we dat there. It took about an hour after ordering to get our food.  Very disappointed in the service.  They had ten servers around and still had slow service.  The table next to us were sat after us and had there food within 30 minutes.  What a joke.  Get it together."
John D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,21,1,2.0,12/4/2017,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Carlsbad for lunch and were quite surprised. They were so slooooooooowww. We had no drinks and no appetizers and were still there 1 hour and 50 minutes. We barely saw our waiter, so I thought that was the problem, he had more important things to do. The neighboring table had a waiter that checked in often and they experienced slow too. I also do not like the fact that they allowed dogs inside. I am certainly a fan of ""Man's Best Friend"", but cleanliness in a restaurant should be paramount. This is a new restaurant and maybe they will work out the kinks eventually. The food was excellent."
Mallory F.,"Oceanside, CA",117,14,12,4.0,12/11/2017,"Went for early Sunday dinner. Wait time to be seated, about 30 minutes. Wait time for meal to arrive after that, about 45 min. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. These long waits may not improve. Food and service were good. Please give more care to your bathrooms, they were a bit neglected. FYI there is a line and a wait time to order cheesecake from the to go area. We didn't realize we would have to wait 15-20 minutes for them to bag up these slices...because they go in a queue with dining dessert and online pick up food. Will come here again for a special occasion, as it is pricey."
Jessee M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/30/2017,"I really wanted this to be good as my past experiences with the Cheesecake Factory have been great. However, unfortunately it was quite awful. We did a take out order for Saturday lunch at my work. I ordered the chicken bellagio and my co-worker a different pasta dish. He picked up the food (fortunately the curb side was available) and brought it back. Starving, I opened the box to dive in and much to my surprise I was greeted by what looked like a pubic HAIR!! To be fair, most likely it was hair from a mans beard. Nonetheless, it is NOT what one wishes to be attached to his/her chicken breast! I called to voice my frustration and the woman answering The phone asked if I would hold so she could go to an area that was more quiet. I waited on hold for over five minutes. When she came back on the phone she asked if I wanted them to make a new one. Hell no! Mind you, I can't leave work now to return to the store anyway. I told her I'd be back after 5 for my money. No offer of a gift card or some other compensation. Simply a refund if my money. Of which, I just received after waiting 30 minuets inside the store for them to figure out how to refund cash. First impressions are everything. Thanks Cheesecake Factory. You've sealed the deal for me. I will not be returning."
Cheryl R.,"San Diego, CA",0,31,10,1.0,11/30/2017,"Let's just say my girlfriends and I waited and waited for our food for over an hour and our server named Ryan forgot to put in our order. They apologized and gave us a Cheesecake slice. Our server was nice but we were out celebrating a birthday and this really ruined our night out. We are moms and we were really looking forward to our dinner night out. Sadly, we won't be going back to this location."
Marie R.,"Vista, CA",0,17,19,5.0,11/30/2017,"Stopped by the new location with my mom on a Monday night and received great service from our server, Daniel. One of the most attentive waiters we've ever came across. I enjoyed the atmosphere as well at this new location. The only thing that could be improved is the bread being warmed up a bit more. Also, not enough seating for waiting area. I would suggest removing the big plant at the entrance and adding another bench. Other than that, the food was great! We ordered the special salmon."
Kiri O.,"Oceanside, CA",87,49,37,5.0,11/14/2017,"So A friend and I ended up here on opening day. We didn't realize that it was going to be opening day. With that being said we got seated very quickly, our server was quick about greeting us, let us know what the specials where, was very attentive but not too attentive, our food came out in a timely manner and was very yummy. I was very surprised play it it been opening day and it looking busy how much of a great experience we had. Great job!"
Lisa M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/26/2017,"We are huge cheesecake factory fans, and have driven to OC, Escondido and San Diego for years to enjoy the usually predictably great experience. We've given this location a few chances. First two visits service was extremely slow and uncoordinated. 3+ hours for lunch on first visit. Second visit our meals came at all different times. After being there for almost 2 hours we had to pack one of the kids meals to go because he'd run out of time to eat before catching a movie, and another child never got her food. Christmas eve-our kids warned us against going but we didn't listen. As a result, 4 of the 6 people in the family spent Christmas eve night and Christmas day with gastroenteritis, most likely from contaminated food from our dinner at CF."
David F.,"Encinitas, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/31/2017,We usually go to the cheesecake restaurant at fashion valley. Came to this one this evening. Service was ok. Had to ask for refills n took forever for her to get back to us. Server was very pleasant but the volume from that whaling music was very irritating. Sat outside so at least it wasn't reverberating all over. I believe you should be able to talk in a normal voice when you pay for your food    I realize it is new year eve but don't drown me with your country music tunes.
Jacob J.,"Oceanside, CA",24,1,,5.0,12/7/2017,"Not sure where to start, but here I go. Party of 2, Wait was long to be seated but that's to be expected, their NEW! their still working out the kincks. We finally did get seated near the bar and our server was April. She came right away   and introduced herself and had a very friendly smile. Ask us what we wanted to drink, and continued to tell us the fish special and the soup. She went straight away and came back super fast! She was quick to take our order and was great about repeating the order ( thank goodness because she miss heard how I wanted my burger cooked) but I'm not going to dock points because she double checked and that's something I appreciated.we ordered americana burger, old fashion burger and a couple of appetizers we did however wait a longggg time for the food to arrive.  BUT this is where it could have gone bad to crazy stupid mad bad! Our server  kept us posted, kept our drinks filled, bread filled and she was extremely intintive to us and her other tables.  She didn't let the stress get to her. She always had a smile on her face when we saw her. When our food did come it was good. Red flags started when I found cabbage on the burger? She came to see how our food was, we asked  her if its suppose to like that, she wasn't sure, so she excused her self to ask. She again came back quickly and explained it a blend of cabbage and lettuce. we are our food and soon we were finished and she brought the menu for dessert. Her explaining some of the cheesecakes sounds delicious! Her favorite she said was , the celebration for her kids. Bottom line is we waited  a very long time but our food was good for a new restaurant and the service was spectacular ,all because of April just taking the time to get to know us a little bit and keeping us updated so we weren't sitting there furious and waiting. You can tell she genuinely cares and puts all her effort. so if your in the area be prepared to wait a bit and ask for April! Prepare yourself for a warm welcome and good food!!!"
Esau A.,"Vista, CA",0,31,1,5.0,12/29/2017,"This was a Friday night, it was packed but we still got in right away. Every waiter/host/employee was so nice and courteous especially our waiter ""Jordan"" he was nice, helpful, friendly, fast, knowledgeable and overall pleasant. And the quality of food is very good."
Wendy B.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,7,1,1.0,12/22/2017,"It's 4:15 and I haven't eaten all day. Why, you say? Because I've been busy Christmas shopping. I did, however, stop to eat with my husband at the new Cheesecake Factory. After waiting for our server for 30 minutes (someone helped him out and took our order,) and still not seeing our food, we asked to see the manager. Meanwhile, we finally get our food and the chicken isn't cooked all the way through on the salad. Another 10 minutes pass, and we again ask to speak to the manager. She comes out and agrees that the chicken isn't cooked and asks if she can compensate us with a free piece of cheesecake. No, thanks!"
Hanh R.,"San Diego, CA",1,20,1,2.0,12/20/2017,"Great food as always HOWEVER wait staff needs more training. For the food, our party ordered lemon roasted chicken, dynamite shrimp and miso salmon. We got our plates in 15-20 min: lemon roasted chicken, fish and chips? and lemon herb salmon? Upon receiving these plates we questioned the waitress if these are what we ordered and she said yes. So we start to eat. 5 min later a different food server comes with the dynamite shrimp and miso salmon, which looked alot more like what we ordered. Maybe the waitress is new and is not familiar with the menu items?? Cocktails were also wrong had to send back. They did not even offer an apology for all their mistakes. Cheesecake took about 10 min to come. By the time the dessert came we were tired and ready to leave. If it's a cold night, do not sit in outdoor seating in mall area...feels like sitting in a freezer since the restaurant is so close to the mall entrance. You're better off sitting outside with the heat lamps."
Danny V.,"Oceanside, CA",37,29,33,1.0,11/22/2017,"I honestly don't even know how I should start this. My first time at the Cheesecake Factory which I was told was going to be a magical occasion with huge slices of Cheesecake everywhere for the eye to see and the food was in abundance and delicious at that. Yet in the great words of a comedian that makes me laugh ridiculously hard ""oh Nae Nae"" it was anything but. First off the option of the waiting locations are horrendous either inside in a very crowded area which left you asses to elbows or if you were there in the evening in a very cold location outside with very heavy cold metal chairs that have no padding so it was even colder. Finally as we were seated we immediately put in our order in hopes of warming up with some delicious food but that was not the case we waited an hour before the manager approached us and told us there was an issue with the sauce on one of the dishes as the reason we waited so long. Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't you have came out here and told us about this early on instead of allowing us to Stew in our anger about the time it takes to bring out some simple dishes like Curry chicken and pasta. When the curry did come out it was not as advertised it was not spicy at all to top it off my pasta was beyond undercooked hell it was still sticking to itself and standing straight up on its own that's not what fettuccine does. The chicken was fine as a matter of fact I think we all eat off of her plate. I returned mine to the kitchen  only being eating a quarter of the way as I tryed to muscle it down thinking it supposed to be this way but just couldn't handle the idea of continuing with my stomach getting more upset with every bite. Finally the option of dessert was upon us I'm not going to lie I was very excited it's what I heard about every time, the whole reason I came to this establishment. The crunch hazelnut cheesecake was good and that's all say on that. The Saving Grace at the Cheesecake Factory was the gentleman that was attending us he was being very prompt after the initial mishap and continued to check on us in hopes of making things better we appreciate him we left him a very nice tip and a message telling him he was great because he was. We summed up the experience to the company being new and still working out the Kinks although it doesn't change the fact that we had a bad experience it will not deter us from coming back in the future to see if they can make good on the stories I've been told about the Cheesecake Factory being a wonderful place. Last but not least my stomach hurts bad."
Annais P.,"Oceanside, CA",104,1,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Ive been to many other Cheesecake Factory restaurants before and this has been the first time I've been disappointed. My husband and I were there around 3pm on a week day so it wasn't very busy, yet after being seated we had to wait almost 20 minutes just for a server to come introduce himself and ask what drinks we'd like. We didn't get any drinks or bread for another 10min at least. The server wasn't attentive and took a while to refill drinks and usually didn't notice if we needed any (we had to ask to refill). The food was brought in good time and tasted good, but the sauce for both our pasta dishes was runny not thick and creamy.. it was almost a soup. We love this restaurant but we won't be coming back to this location."
Debbie s.,"Vista, CA",13,32,3,5.0,12/22/2017,"Service is great, they are busy but service  still great. Our server Nicolette is attentive and funny.  Food is really great, lunch portions are huge!  Great addition to the area. I just want to add that everything was super fresh and everything was really good they were prepared !   when we got there a bunch of people were waiting for them to open, they opened and they had waitstaff stacked up waiting to seat  people, great job!!"""
