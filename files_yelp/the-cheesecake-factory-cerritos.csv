Alexis D.,"Long Beach, CA",119,19,62,3.0,12/19/2017,"I have been here a handful of times with friends or family. The experience has been vastly different each time. This time we were there for a family members birthday, there was 5 of us.     Over all the food tasted DELICIOUS and was fresh, however the service was lacking.  We got in at 3pm and did not leave until 5:30pm.  It took about 40 minutes to get our food, and there were very long periods of our server being out of sight. Other than that, I'd say it was an okay experience."
Justin M.,"Yucca Valley, CA",170,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Came in for my grandfathers birthday, had a good amount of us and waited almost 2 hours to get seated. This put aside I understand there's no fault on the restaurant being that it's all based off of foot traffic and wait times can always fluctuate.  Finally seated.. entrees roll out of the kitchen and first off the salmon was extremely oily, we also ordered a hamachi steak, which was cold. On top of that we also ordered the cashew chicken and it was drenched in sauce and not only that but the sauce was overcooked/recooked (dark & chunks) there was so much sauce that you couldn't even separate the rice from the chicken it was literally a soup consistency. There were a few other dishes that were also ordered but to save the eyes I'll spare the words. Overall there needs to be some enormous efforts on quality control on the line and maybe some provisions on protocol for entrees leaving the expo.  Asides from entrees, also ran into a huge issue with splitting the bill. It was a party of 10 and we were informed that it was not possible to split it 5 ways which is ridiculous. It literally takes 10 seconds on any POS system to split and itemize separate checks.  The server was a sweetheart and apologetic through all of this I must add.  Definitely not coming back in, this location seems to have many issues on the management spectrum.. all done."
Michael L.,"Buena Park, CA",21,93,58,1.0,1/7/2018,"Unless it's for cheesecake takeout, I will probably never eat at this place again. You wait for ever, when the entire patio area is open and then once you get seated surrounded by open tables, you get the one that hasn't even been cleaned off yet. The hostess doesn't care, she just walks off. I hand the bill from the previous party that at at our table to a passing waitress and clean the table off. Our waiter comes and first thing he asks for is the bill of the previous party and I tell him I handed it off to a waitress. He looks upset and sternly asked me which one and at that point I let him have it for everthing I had mentioned before. So we order our drinks and because I hate waiting to get a refill, I ask him to bring me two drinks at once. He forgets a drink of someone else at my party but brings my second one. When the food comes, I specifically ask for ranch with my food and guess what, no ranch. At this point I just call it a wash and ask for my bill. I read over it and I get charged for two separate drinks when the one I had was free refills. Oh well, cheap price to pay to learn to never go through that agian."
Nokkie T.,"Cerritos, CA",192,35,13,1.0,12/30/2017,12/30/2017  The whole front desk at 1pm was disappointing. I forgot the hostess name but management needs to give her some new customer service training.  No wonder this place is 2.5 stars. The only thing good about my visit was my server. Forgot his name but he got glasses on and a beard. He deserves a lead position for sure.  Would i come back here again? Mos def but just for getting cheesecake to go
Derek W.,"Lakewood, CA",372,167,1291,2.0,12/17/2017,"I came in a group of about 24 on a Thursday afternoon at 1 PM. We were assigned to a long table at the near end of the outdoor patio, so there was no need to go indoors. A cheesecake lover myself, I was looking forward to munching on the delicacy at its namesake factory on the west side of Los Cerritos Center. After my meal there, I learned a pretty big lesson: Just because you are a big fan of cheesecake does NOT mean that you are also a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. Having never made the trek over to a Cheesecake Factory in my life, I was more than looking forward to having one of my favorite desserts there. After all, how can you go to Cheesecake Factory and not have a bite of cheesecake??? With so many different types of cheesecakes to choose from, there will be one that will certainly lure your eyes and tell you to pick it! For me, the chosen one was Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake. I love caramel. I love peanut butter. I love Butterfingers. I love Reese's. Certainly, this had to be a dessert I would love! Right? Not so fast...I had to get through my Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo first alongside a side of corn succotash before I could finally set my eyes on the APBCFRC (read the previous paragraph to decode the acronym). Despite the fact that our reservation was at 1 PM, we actually didn't get our food until just past 1:30 PM. I reckon we could have circumnavigated the mall during our wait. At least my strawberry lemonade and the starter bread kept me company. The gumbo contains shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic simmered in a spicy Cajun Style Broth with Cream. It also came with a mound of white rice on top. It wasn't terribly bad, but after a few bites, my taste buds sensed an incredible amount of cream in my gumbo! Coupled with the fact that the bowl itself was much larger than I expected, I immediately knew that I was NOT going to finish all that in one sitting as I could sense my mind going crazy screaming, ""CREAM OVERLOAD!!! CREAM OVERLOAD!!!"" The corn succotash contains mostly corn mixed with some other vegetables. Not a bad side overall. Gave me a nice break from having to deal with all that cream in the gumbo, but could have used more flavor in my opinion. A few ordered fries in my group. One of them got fries in a bowl about the size of my gumbo bowl, and another got fries in a cup alongside his turkey burger, to which he said, ""It was alright, but I've had better."" I tried both fries. They weren't bad, but for some reason, they tasted a little different to me. Knowing that the APBCFRC was yet to come, I made no effort to finish the gumbo or even the corn succotash to save room for the cake. Our waitress asked us all if we wanted takeout boxes. I shot my hand up and several others did too. She also brought us some bags to carry our boxes in. We actually had to wait a long time as well for our cheesecake...about 45 minutes after receiving our main course. I was only eating for about half that time, and I spent the other half thinking about how good my cheesecake would taste and how it would make up for the mediocrity of the main course of my meal. Or so I thought... My APBCFRC came, and it was the smallest compared to everyone else's cheesecakes! I took a bite, and I immediately knew why it was the smallest. It was so tightly condensed that I couldn't taste much of what the APBCFRC was supposed to have! I guess too much of a good thing really isn't a good thing after all. The cheesecake I'm used to having is much less dense and flavorful. Unfortunately, the APBCFRC turned out to be a disappointment for my peanut-butterfinger loving taste buds. What should have been an awesome dessert ended up as a total flop. *FACEPALM* The tables weren't particularly large enough for the dishes I ordered, so my claustrophobia kicked in while I was munching on my gumbo & corn succotash. I also almost mistook my takeout box for someone else's! Everyone else seemed to enjoy themselves with the dishes they had, but I guess I must have been left with the bad egg out of the two dozen. Would I consider coming back? If I do, I'm certainly not eating any of the same dishes again. I was anything but impressed. I'd be curious to try their other dishes, but this time around, my expectations for a great dining experience at Cheesecake Factory have plummeted like a Stock Market crash. Ever have one of those times when you were looking forward to the food at a restaurant you've been wanting to try and you enjoy your first bites, but the subsequent bites make you wish you had ordered something else? And when you save the best for last, it turns out it's not really the best? Yeah...that just about summarizes my first ever visit to a factory of cheesecakes."
Linda M.,"Westminster, CA",63,304,190,5.0,11/12/2017,"Love Cheesecake Factory!!! I like how it's close to the movie theater.  My husband and I would catch a 9/9:30/10/10:30AM movie and would dine here afterwards, which is usually around lunch time.  By the time we get to Cheesecake Factory, there would be a handful of more parties waiting before us.  Since it's just the 2 of us, or wait is usually 10 to 15 minutes.  Longest I've waited during prime eating time was 30 minutes.   I usually order a pasta dish along with some appetizers.  Our usual appetizers are the potato tots, fried zucchini and fried mac and cheese.  My usual pasta is the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic.  I get the dinner portion so I can eat the leftovers that night.  My husband usually orders the taco plate, club sandwich plate, or a breakfast burrito.   Everything always taste delicious, full of flavor.  I also love their bread basket.  I always eat all the sourdough and my husband would eat the honey wheat.  The wait for food hasn't been long, I haven't sat there and thought to myself ""wonder what's taking so long?"" Or ""wonder where my food is?""  Food is always good.  Service has always been friendly and attentive.  Will definitely be back for more!!!"
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,1.0,10/14/2017,"This place went from poor to worse the second time around. It can shut down as far as I'm concerned.  Went here on 9/11 for a birthday dinner. It took at least 30 minutes to get seated even though the place was damn-near empty. Strike 1! Our party of 9 was greeted by Alex. With the exception of 1 person, everyone was there and ordered at the same time. All food came roughly 30 minutes later except mine (herb crusted salmon) and another friend's salad of all things. Strike 2!  We asked what the hold up was and was told by manager Sara that the salad was mistakenly taken to another table and had to be remade. Duhh! My salmon? No clue except that it was being taken care of by the kitchen.  When my food finally came, I checked the salmon because I asked for it to be cooked very well done. It was the total opposite -.still jiggly pink and mushy in the middle! Strike 3!  I asked Alex to have the cooks refry it until it was basically dried out. It couldn't be that difficult since I didn't ask for a new plate, right? Lol! In the meantime, other friends began complaining about their food. One's pasta was dry and lacked sauce. One's jambalaya came with pasta but the order specifically asked for rice. Other waitresses helped Alex deliver food to the table, didn't know who ordered what, and the each other under the bus for all of the mistakes. All this went on on while my salmon was still not done. Strike 4!  Finally, the manager, Sara comes over and apologizes for so many mishaps. She assures us our food would be taken care of, tells me my salmon was being cooked to perfection, and offered free soup or appetizer to me and the friend who was missing her salad. No appetizers ever came. Strike 5! We kept hearing people yelling in the kitchen and wondered if it was the cooks. Lol. After a few more f**ked up meals, sending food back, and complaints, the rude ass kitchen manager named Mycella comes to the table with a shitty attitude. She tried to convince my friend to keep his jambalaya which HER cooks made wrong! Nope! Then Mycella had a debate with another friend about whether or not she ordered her meal at the same time as the rest of us because her food was also missing. Strike 6 and an ass beating for Mycella!   By this time, my salmon was STILL nowhere to be found. I asked Sara if it be cancelled or comped. She pitifully tells me she couldn't do anything to assist because her superior wouldn't allow it. Wth?? I've never, EVER heard a manager at a restaurant say he/she could not assist. I asked if the ""superior"" was on site, which he was, then asked to speak with Chris so I could file a formal complaint. Strike 7! Before Chris comes over, my salmon came. For the 3rd time, it was still soft and undercooked. The cooks added extra blackening to the top and rewarmed it, but did NOT cook the salmon well like I asked. By this time, I was pissed, no longer hungry, and all of my people were ready to leave. I politely spoke with Chris and showed him my undercooked salmon. As I expressed my disapoointment with the overall lack of quality food, concern, wait time, the fact that Sara said she couldn't help, Mycella's poor attitude, and that I was going to file a complaint with their corporate department, he looks baffled and tells me he was apologetic and unaware of the problems. How in the hell was that possible for as long as we were in the restaurant and with as many orders we sent back??? Strike 8! After all that, Chris comped my meal and a few others. The jambalaya was cooked correctly, the birthday girl got her cheesecake, and we got the hell out of there!  Kudos to Victor for trying to be helpful.  Whatever the omen was there that night, 3 times will NOT be a charm. I won't be returning here until MANAGEMENT IS FIRED AND a new, competent team is brought in!! And I still probably won't return."
Tammy S.,"Long Beach, CA",7,6,1,2.0,12/24/2017,"Like other reviewers here, I haven't had a bad experience at this location until today. Just got back from dinner with my daughter and I am so upset to write that our dinner was unpleasant.  We were promptly seated when we arrived..didnt even need to wait given the Christmas holiday. One star.  The host sat us down, gave us our menus. We knew what we wanted so we were ready to order. We waited for our waiter...and waited...and waited some more. No one came to greet us for 15-20 mins. The customers next to our table were seated after us had their waiter at their table within seconds.  Eventually the waiter decided to show up, took our drink order then disappears. He reappeared with bread and one drink..my diet coke.  10 mins later he brought out my daughter's lemonade and took down our food order. Okay so our food came out faster than I thought - two stars.  Throughout the entire night, the waiter never checked in on us again. EVER. I had to flagged down another employee to get his attention when we were ready to leave. Further, they ran out of the original cheesecake. Who the EFF runs out on their signature desert for what they are known for?? Yeah I do sound irked because my daughter's birthday is tomorrow and she didnt get her favorite cheesecake. Guess what? We flagged someone else again to get the waiter to bring back my debit card. SMH. NEVER. AGAIN."
Debra C.,"Baldwin Park, CA",121,18,12,2.0,12/23/2017,"I usually don't have any issues with this location..with the exception of tonight. I wanted to grab a slice to cheesecake to take home, so I went in to get one. The cashier had no customer service whatsoever. She was actually kind of rude. I asked for a slice of strawberry cheesecake and immediately told me my total. I handed her the cash & no thank you or any type of acknowledgement. So I stood there waiting for her to get my slice of cheesecake (and keep note it wasn't busy at al) and I looked at her and she literally rolled her eyes and  grunted as if I was bothering her. So I stood there and waited. Then they gave me my cheesecake.  I left home and when I opened up my cheesecake, it was partially smashed. There was nothing on top of it or anything for it to be smashed. So i received it this way. Disappointing.  I'm really disappointed at the customer service at this location. Management needs to retrain their cashier/waitress (whatever she was) on common courtesy. A simple please and thank you would have been enough. I don't appreciate the snobby attitude."
Dione W.,"Cerritos, CA",109,2,1,1.0,12/13/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Cerritos and they told me my bill was counterfeit. I took the bill to 3 gas stations and they said that the bill was good. I went back to the Cheesecake Factory and they went to check the bill and tried to switch it. After confronting them, they apologized and admitted that the bill was good.  This happened after being humiliated twice in front of tons of people, the sabotaging of my dinner meeting and being talked to like a dog!  This location is horrible. Very discriminatory. Three strikes you are out. I will not ever go back!"
Leng C.,"Long Beach, CA",317,50,24,1.0,12/20/2017,"Probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Service is so slow and food always comes out cold. We were seated at the mall patio which was so awkward. We had mall walkers staring at us while we ate. When we sat down, it took about 10 mins for someone to come up to us and ask us for drink orders, by that time we already knew what we wanted. Another few minutes to even get a bread basket. Why not bring it when coming to take our drink order?  Fried Mac and cheese came out cold. The cheese was curdled by the time I stuck my fork in it.  So unfortunate. I'll stick to Huntington Beach"
Ray Ray S.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",1,36,93,5.0,10/11/2017,"You could never go wrong eating here there isn't anything that I've tried that I could say I didn't like.  The staff is always in front of you to make sure you have what you need no complaints at all.   I had the Bacon BBQ Burger med rare and it is amazing and I'm not a burger fan but thought I would give it a shot tonight.  I have had it in the past and this dish hasn't failed me.   Also had the stuffed mushrooms there always a point if your not a garlic fan don't bother if you are then there a must.   Of course everyone is an avocado egg roll fan if your not then ya your missing out as my quote goes ""more for me"""
Alex M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",119,388,1757,3.0,8/5/2017,"Came here for lunch and got seated right when we walked in. The decor reminded me of a Las Vegas buffet. The lights and color I think gave it that feel. The staff and our waitres were very friendly. We really like when the server gives us recomendation and suggestions from the menu. That's always a plus and even more awesome when what they recommend was good.  Appetizer  Eggroll Sampler - A Variety of All of Our Eggrolls with Avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon. This was good and got a different taste of different eggrolls. They were all cooked well and crispy and came with their own dipping sauce.  Meal Pasta Carbonara - Spaghettini with Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. Available with Chicken. The pasta carbonara was ok. The sauce was not as thick as I would have liked it but it had good flavor. The chicken and bacon was cooked well and the peas added a different touch.  Kale Salad with Salmon - My wife enjoyed this salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was a nice size portion.  It was a good experience and if in the area may come in for a bite."
Farmer D.,"Lakewood, CA",1,12,8,5.0,12/24/2017,"First time eating at a cheesecake factory, and it was absolutely delicious! My mom and I came for lunch on christmas eve and were seated promptly, the waitress was very nice and seemed to come check on us at the perfect moments. I ordered the fried fish tacos, my mom ordered the ""Renee's special""(half sandwich, soup and a salad) with the sandwich being chicken salad. Both plates came out about 15 minutes after ordering and were huge portions! The fish was cooked perfectly and the pickled red onions and chipotle crema on them were amazing! My mom got so much food she ended up eating the soup and salad and taking the sandwich home for later. Overall the food was great, the customer service was on point and the restaurant had a very nice atmosphere. Definitely coming back! Gonna try either the shrimp scampi or the bistro shrimp next time."
Mary P.,"Irvine, CA",416,71,242,2.0,1/1/2018,"Cheesecake Factory or Yard House has always been my family's go to restaurants when we can't decide what we want to eat. However the more I've been going to Cheesecake factory, the less I want to come back. I've been to this location several times and there's always a long wait time, which is fine. But the service is just getting slower, and slower. When we went last week we waited 50 min to get seated, and then another HOUR to get our food. So we didn't get to eat until about 2 hours into Cheesecake. Our appetizer came 30 minutes after we ordered and was cold...So it's obviously been sitting out in the kitchen. Our waiter was super nice and friendly which I really appreciated and I know he has no control over the food, but it seems like all the waiters were just scrambling everywhere to keep up with their assigned tables and there were 5 million birthday songs being sung left and right lol. I got my food 15 min. after everyone else as well. I ordered fries as a substitute for mashed potatoes with my steak but they gave me the steak first cause they didn't want to keep me waiting any longer and then brought the fries out after. And my plate looked pretty sad there were like 10 green beans hahaha. We had to ask for steak knives after we got our dishes. Overall it was just meh. I understand it's a super busy restaurant but I'm kind of surprised the service just continues to lag and get slower everytime I come back and doesn't really get better."
Brenda K.,"Buena Park, CA",9,134,16,4.0,12/30/2017,Terrific server who went way out of her way to make our dinner wonderful. Food was good and plentiful. Birthday cheesecake was huge and 2 of us couldn't finish it. Would return here just because of the great service.
Jessica A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,2,1.0,8/17/2017,"Cheese cake factory used to be one of my favorite places, but it seems like the quality of the food is very poor now, I was with my family for dinner Wednesday night, our bread was born hard as a rock, we asked one of the food service employees (Asian) to bring us fresh bread ( we explained why )  She got very made and she gave us the look  Very rude, she never came back with our bread, When got our food, my kids pizza was born, my rice was Krispy, dry and hard, steak medallions were medium well ( requested median rare ) this is for the kitchen manager: ""don't send food to your costumer that you wouldn't serve to your kids and family"""
Amy M.,"Lawndale, CA",0,7,,2.0,1/2/2018,"This is by far the absolute worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. I came here December 28, 2017 to celebrate my mother's birthday. The wait time I was given was extremely inaccurate and the hostess seemed not to care about their inconsistency about the wait time they had provided. Once sat, our server was really friendly. She was overwhelmed though, it seemed like she had way too many tables. We understood though she did try her best. The nachos were good, however, the cheese stake sandwich was bland and the Alfredo pasta I had ordered tasted awful. I've ordered Alfredo pasta from other locations and it's been delicious! However at this location flavor was lacking. In all, I won't come back to this location, I much rather drive to Brea or Huntington Beach. As a corporation I hope you guys come back in and fix this location."
Christine Z.,"Signal Hill, CA",160,17,14,5.0,11/28/2017,Wow I had a great experience here for lunch today! My sister and I went to have her birthday lunch and our server Jillian B was amazing!  Very attentive and always making sure we were ok! Even down to packing our food nicely... !  They always have nice servers here but today's dinning experience was by far the best;)
David V.,"Long Beach, CA",1,15,5,5.0,12/14/2017,"Yum yum yum! I love the food here! And the waitstaff is always so pleasant. The last time I went here, our server Heather, was super nice and very helpful. I couldn't decide on what I wanted, but she ended up recommending something new I hadn't tried before and it was really good. I've yet to have a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory, and the Cerritos location is no exception! I'm also happy that I don't have to drive far anymore with this one being so close to Long Beach. I felt the Huntington Beach location at Bella Terra was just too far and dealing with 405 traffic is never fun.  I know some people complain about slow service but the food needs to be cooked. I don't want microwaved food. I can get that at home or BK. And some of these complaints about the staff seem erroneous. I haven't had any bad interactions with their staff yet. Everyone is super nice and friendly. Thanks for the great night out!"
Rachel B.,"Cypress, CA",404,84,610,5.0,8/3/2017,"Ya know idk why people are so harsh on their reviews. Haven't we all worked in some form of customer service? I think this location is as great as any other! I went with my family on that half of cheesecake day and we were seated way faster than I would have imagined (even with 6 people!). The little buzzer signal reaches pretty far too--it went off while I was in pacsun! The bread (free) came out quick and so did the food, it was very efficient! Granted, if you wanted a lot of waiter interaction, I could see how one would be disappointed, but for a promo night, it was pretty damn good. Food was amazing with dishes hovering around $15 a plate. Cheesecake was the best it's ever been! I haven't written a review in a hot while, but I couldn't let this location sit at such a low rating on Yelp! Outrageous! Just be patient! They're doing their best--keep it up!"
Jonathan R.,"Long Beach, CA",549,515,1485,3.0,2/19/2017,"Have not visited The Cheesecake Factory in quite sometime, but tonight it was convenient to the theater and had time for the 45 minute wait. Service was very good, our server was attentive, friendly and prompt. It was the food that was a little off. Chicken taquitos app from the special menu were good, liked the tomatillo salsa and filling, but they were really greasy. Guacamole salad tasted okay, but the guac looked less than fresh. My son's burger and fries, also good, Cobb salad good but not great, just huge. I had an iced tea that was $3.50- just seems like the price value for the quality  Was a little off, hence the 3 stars."
C D.,"Cypress, CA",0,57,4,3.0,11/4/2017,"Our Server Stephanie W. was #sopretty... I'd like to serve her..... breakfast in bed... yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Seriously though, gorgeous. First time coming to this location. Quite confused why it so busy on a Friday at 13:00, but nevertheless, got seated right away. I really don't understand this restaurant and the amount of options it has on the menu. It has almost everything you can think of, but I went for a burger. Now, I've never been to a place that asked me how I'd like my burger cooked, but when our Server asked, I said rare, she gave a little grin, or was it a smirk, was it a grin of love? or a smirk of TF you eating a rare burger for? Anyway we had a moment, a connection if you will over my love of barely cooked meats. Anyway, the bacon bacon burger is quite tasty. The patty just melted in my mouth and everyone else liked their meals. Potsticker app was quite good and sauce was lovely enough to dip my bread in. There wasn't really anything special about this place. It was busy, but our Server came by and checked up on us frequently, omg, please come back and ask me if I need more water, even though my glass is full, I just want to stare at you in a non creeper way while I shove this bacon into my mouth. CLASSY. Food was good, parking was alright, cost was typical."
Brittany C.,"Signal Hill, CA",251,9,,4.0,1/2/2018,"I'm giving this 4 stars specifically for our server Monique. She was an incredible server and was very attentive. She went out of her way several times for our family. I would have given them 5 stars just on her service as a waitress alone, but the chicken Madeira was too sweet and the alcohol was not cooked out and the replacement farfalle with chicken and garlic was bland (probably cause they were rushing to replace it)."
Mark O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",106,178,850,3.0,1/19/2017,"Disappointing. Ambience is nice just like every other cheesecake factory I've been to. +1 for Cheesecake Factory Time: 5:35pm Entrance and bar was super-crowded but we managed to find a table. Usually I order off the menu but this time we just decided to have appetizers. All three were nearly tasteless with no creativity and too fried. Yuck! -2 for Cheesecake Factory Lessons learned: 1. If you go to the Cheesecake Factory, go for cheesecake. A good choice 2. Order off the main menu 3. Don't have appetizers Sorry Cheesecake Factory. I think you can do better"
Lorena P.,"Upland, CA",0,17,12,1.0,12/28/2017,"This location has horrible ratings! I totally get why now . Just the other night I ordered take out since it was a bit late and I was craving some good pasta.  I was there early to pick up my order and pasta was cold! No silverware! No napkins! I asked for my wings well done and they were pink on the inside. The girl on the phone asked if I wanted bread and butter and of course I said yes. Well guess what hard bread with No butter!  I was so bummed out because I love Cheesecake Factory so much, but I will just blame the location and the staff that worked the later shift! 1 star service...."
Ken L.,"Norwalk, CA",0,6,1,5.0,12/30/2017,"Took the family for a birthday dinner. This is our second time and it was pleasant both times.  Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was great, even through a shift change."
Jasmine J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,89,132,2.0,8/15/2017,"The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake. I attended a birthday dinner here and it wasn't pleasant. The birthday girl had to complain to a manager just to have the entire party sit one big table instead of 2 small ones that weren't connected. Who wants to spend their birthday dinner walking back and forth in between two tables? The food is gross, I should have eaten before the dinner. I didnt think nachos could turn out disgusting but they did. Soggy and nasty. My friend ordered a veggie burger and she only took 1 bite. I tried it and it was the worst veggie burger I've tried. Chris the manager on duty, gave the whole table free Cheesecake, including everyone that ordered several cheesecakes to go. That was very nice of him but didn't make up for the lack luster food. Won't be coming back, unless it's to buy Cheesecake."
Shelby J.,"Lakewood, CA",44,149,485,2.0,12/14/2016,"I'm sad to write that I'm very disappointed with this location because it is most convenient and closest to my home.  I visited this location on a busy Saturday afternoon so it was a little crowded. It seems as though the staff here is a little rude and unprofessional, which was the first strike of my visit. The staff looks like a sketchy bunch as well.  The second strike which was the biggest, was the dirty environment of the restaurant. We were seated at the indoor patio which was a bit noisy, but it was hard to overlook the dirty seats that had food on them as well as a dirty table. The waitress who sat us clearly saw the dirt and was so lazy and unprofessional that she waited until we said something and had the nerve to have an attitude because she had to clean it.  The third strike was the dirty cutlery and utensils. I understand sometimes water spots dry on the silverware, but there shouldn't be FOOD on them. I believe we had to exchange 3 sets of cutlery until we were satisfied and even then I asked for steaming hot water to somewhat sterilize them because I cannot trust their cleanliness.  The food here was good and tasted like any other Cheesecake Factory food. BUT the calamari that I ordered which is usually quite delightful was gross. It was cold and soggy and seemed as though it had been sitting for an hour. We didn't get past the appetizers because of pure disgust.  My whole meal was thrown off by just a dirty environment. I will never visit this location again."
Sean C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,2,1.0,11/16/2017,Great food as always. The location gets a lot of westward sun in the afternoon. Nice ambience. Total lack of of cultural diversity among the staff in comparison to guests
Dayana G.,"Maywood, CA",0,4,2,4.0,11/15/2017,"Omg the food is so good 1st time here and I love it..instantly addicted to the bread If u love ur bread and butter as I,  I know this is the spot...lol yummm"
Brenda S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",87,1,1,5.0,12/28/2017,Love the Thai Lettuce Wraps!! Busy today so sat at the bar. Service was excellent!! Food came out quick compared to table service. We were going to a movie so it was perfect for us. All the staff we encountered were friendly! I definitely will return to this store!
Francine M.,"Paramount, CA",685,163,306,3.0,9/27/2017,"I met up with some family members here on a Friday evening, and even though the food was delicious (as always), the service was just unbelievably slow. I asked a few different people for a kids menu before ended up getting one, my uncle had to wait quite a while for some shredded cheese for his pasta, The food itself took quite a while to get to the table, and the drinks all got pretty low before we were offered refills. Toward the end I ended up going to the separate cheesecake line to order something to go because our server took too long to get back to us. I tried the enchiladas, they were very good, side dishes included (black beans and rice). My dish was the shepherds pie (one of my favorites), and it was delicious just the right amount of everything. My daughter had a cheese pizza which she enjoyed, my uncle had the shrimp and sausage pasta which I also tried, and was very delicious as well. Maybe I've got to come back at a different time to get quicker service and of the stars on my review, but for now the service was bad enough to doc them two stars"
Jemilynne A.,"Anaheim, CA",806,4,5,5.0,10/21/2017,"As always, a great place to eat because of the freshness of ingredients and the free pumpernickel/sourdough bread. I love coming here because of the quality of food and the proximity of the location to malls and movie theater. We ordered the side salad (which looked like a meal for me), the spring roll sampler (awesomeness), shrimp scampi (another one of those you don't want to miss dishes). The servings were more than enough for two hungry people because it can easily feed 3. The pasta was done al dente. Perfecto !!!!  For all those, we spent $45 including the tip.  The only downside is the long wait. The average wait time is 45 minutes. The long wait time is the reason why we wanted to go to this location because you have some time to go around the mall and shop.  Parking was okay given that it was a weekend.  Bottom line, a great family place."
Paolo A.,"Cerritos, CA",16,28,19,1.0,9/24/2017,"I have been here previously a couple of times, but I am compelled to write this review tonight based on the terrible service, disingenuous attitude the staff and management have towards their customers; and the downhill quality of the food. Party of four arrive around 9:35pm; with wait time of 40mins, we got our table earlier than expected. We were seated near the back, close to the outside patio where the mall is. Strike one - Floors excessively slippery, my friend almost tripped on her heels. We were then seated and attended by our Waiter, let's call him Jesus G. He quickly got our drink orders, and our drinks were served quite fast. Strike two -However, it took him around 15-20 minutes to get back to our table to get our orders for the entrees, after i casually blurted out that I was starving and a coworker of his overheard me. And it took him another 10 minutes until I actually asked for the complementary Bread and butter, to which he would NOT have offered until we asked.  Strike four- The bread tasted terrible, it tasted like old stale bread that was heated up in the microwave. Very rubbery, and our butter was served in a dish, opened already. I am accustomed to individualized butter enclosed in silver wrapping, and cold. This butter was warmed and melting all over the place.  My Carbonara with shrimp was good, my friends ordered Chicken Pasta dish and a Jambalaya pasta dish.  Now quick backstory, my friend, let's call her Pang, we both work as nursing consultants and travel around California. We had lunch at a Cheesecake factory in Riverside. It was her first time to try the Jambalaya pasta, and it was quite delicious. Strike 5- To our dismay; the Jambalaya dish came out extremely dark, had green noodles, and tasted like burnt rubber with Creole spices sprinkled on it to mask the burnt flavor. By the time our Cheesecakes have arrived, my friend Pang had barely touched her Jambalaya, and I realized that it was inedible. I would not feed that to my dog.  At that point, I was pretty stuffed, and had to save room for the cheesecakes. I had told our waiter, Jesus G that we would like to speak to the manager regarding the Jambalaya, and I would like a container for my Carbonara ( which had more than 1/2 portion left). To my surprise he took my Plate, and said he could not do anything about the food but the manager could. I thought to myself, oh how nice, he'll put it in a box for me. Last and final strike - After around 15 minutes, he comes back to the table and tells us that he informed the manager, and that she authorized him to tell us that we wouldn't be charged for the Jambalaya. Okay... so I asked him, where my Carbonara was. He looks at me stunned, and said 'I thought you said you were done, so I threw it' At this point, I was already getting to the point where I would start acting like a Bitch, so I politely told him that I would like to speak to the manager. Everyone in the table, ASIDES FROM JESUS G, had heard that I wanted to take home the REST OF MY PASTA. I let the Manager have it! And boy, I told her off! I threw Shade, like major Shade...And i almost felt kind of bad, because she looked like she was about to cry. In her defense, she did refund the Jambalaya and the Carbonara. But that experience in itself was so terrible, that I advise you, reader, to go elsewhere. It killed the mood of our conversation, and instead of having a pleasant dinner, our night was ruined instead.  And no amount of I'm sorry, or How can we make it better can ever compare to wasted time and energy. I feel sorry for restaurants like this who do not understand that customer service and great food is what is needed to keep a business like this running. I give this location two to three years tops, with the way things are being run, even less. Look at Elephant Bar, filed for bankruptcy and closed its locations in my nearby vicinity. I foresee that happening for this chain, if things do not change. Edit: just realized that I skipped strike three, and after three strikes you're out! So fellow yelpers,  I have given these people more than 6 chances okay. My patience and tolerance with dealing with incompetence was unusually long today."
Moo B.,"La Palma, CA",0,17,5,5.0,6/11/2017,"Amazing service, they knew we had to catch a movie! They brought our food out fast and were so polite, one of them who had an amazing moustache even showed us their fidget spinner collection!  Thanks guys, we enjoyed our food and made it in time to watch Wonder Woman !!!"
Risotto T.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",13,6,3,1.0,11/12/2017,"When we arrived and placed our name  on the list with the hostess, yet she called everyone ells but us, when we ask about it, she apologized but continued to seat other people who came after us, we had to ask Criss the manager for a table, when we told him about what had happened,  he seemed put out with us. When we get our food, I ordered pancakes, the one on top but the ones in the bottom looked have eaten. You can never find soap in,the soap dispenser in the ladies bathroom on Sunday mornin in this place."
Informed J.,"Bellflower, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/19/2017,"I was extremely disappointed in the service today. As with many of the previous reviews, the service is extremely slow.  We were seated in the patio area and waited over 10 minutes with no drinks or bread. My husband ended up having to go to the front desk to inquire about our waitress. Finally, about five minutes later, the waitress came to take our drink order without any apology or acknowledgement of the wait time. We told her that we wanted 3 waters with lemon and we also ordered our food since we were unsure when we would see her again. We then waited another 10 minutes before she brought our waters WITHOUT lemon. We reminded her of the lemons and once again, no acknowledgment of the oversight, said she would get us some lemons. Another 5-10 minutes passed and she brought drinks out for the other tables, walked passed us several times with no lemons. By that point, we asked the hostess if we could be seated in another area because we could already tell this dining experience was going to be terrible. She said she was going to get the manager. About 10 minutes later, the manager walked past us and dropped something off at another table. She didn't even acknowledge us and went back inside the restaurant. We waited another 10 minutes thinking she was just busy and she never came. By this point, we told the hostess that we were leaving.  I absolutely refuse to patronize this location ever again. I'd be crazy to pay Cheesecake Factory prices for (insert terrible restaurant) type service!"
Helen D.,"Long Beach, CA",112,53,5,1.0,9/18/2017,"STAY AWAY!! Went there on a Tuesday night, it was COMPLETELY empty but we had to wait 45 mins for table. It looked like management had dismissed a bunch of staff.. our poor waiter had a huge party and all the tables on the patio.  Went to the bathroom and the manager totally body checked me, I actually fell against the wall. She just gave me a dirty look and kept walking."
M M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,52,1.0,9/30/2017,WORST Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to! Watered down ranch dressing. Wasn't as rich as usual. The bread tasted like burnt plastic. The club sandwich was soggy and sloppy. The fries were undercooked. Greek salad was drenched in dressing! Never again.
