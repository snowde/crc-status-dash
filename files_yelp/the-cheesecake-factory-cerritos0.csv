Pam G.,"Cypress, CA",0,3,2,2.0,8/5/2017,"Good food but no matter when i come its crowded and slooooow service we had to flag down our waiter for drink refills, to order, to order cheesecake and this was at 3pm on a sat...just cant do it anymore"
Erik R.,"Norwalk, CA",0,23,,4.0,7/24/2017,Cheesecake Factory is bomb hard to find parking but overall great spot to eat I love coming here if your in the drinking mood make sure to try California whiskey sour you won't go bad with that and meat loaf plate is to die for
Kenyetta A.,"Long Beach, CA",2,20,14,1.0,6/11/2017,I hate this Cheesecake Factory. The wait is ridiculous. It's always an 35mins-an hour to an hour and an half. Food is whatever.
Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729,2.0,3/12/2016,"I know this Cheesecake Factory is new so the servers here probably haven't had enough training or experience but it seems like management needs to 1) tell the host to slow down on seating servers when they're super busy 2) get more servers on the floor 3) give servers less tables.  I came here at 6:40 on a Saturday night with 3 other people and was quoted an hour to an hour and 30 min. Not a problem, they told us they were out of buzzers so we had to come back in 20 min to get one. We walked around the mall (not too far) until our buzzer rang.  We got seated In a booth in the very very far back. 5 minutes go by and no server comes by, finally she arrives and asks us for our drink orders. Another 5 minutes go by and we finally get our drinks, a strawberry lemonade, an IPA and two waters. Another 10 minutes go by before we get any bread and are able to order food. After we get our bread, our server comes by to tell us she will be leaving and a new server would be taking care of us. So, I cut her some slack thinking she probably worked a double shift and was super tired which explains why she was so slow in getting our orders and drinks. But, throughout the entire night I see her walking past our table... Not sure what that's all about. Our new server seemed to be a bit better than she was. However, his attention to detail was lacking. He did not notice our stacked plates on the edge of the table and empty water and lemonade glasses. At least he was nice and gave us recommendations on dessert.  We ordered the... 5/5: Thai lettuce wraps. I think it was around $13.50. THE BEST LETTUCE WRAPS EVER. Seriously. It comes with carrots, pickled cucumber, some noodles, slices of grilled chicken breast, bean sprouts, 3 dipping sauces and lettuce. Our grilled chicken was a little bit burnt but we were too hungry to care.  1/5: crab and artichoke dip. I think it was $11.49. We asked for half tortillas and half bread if possible or a side of tortillas. It came with a side of tortillas and we were charged 2.50 without being warned about the charge before hand. The toasted bread it came with was EXTRA toasty to the point of almost being burnt... So it was not good with the toast. If you order this, skip the bread and sub tortillas chips!!! The dip itself was just ok, nothing special... I would have preferred the spinach dip instead.  4/5: chicken madiera and steak Diane combo ($21.50). It came with mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The chicken had two asparagus on it for decoration. It's a small portion but since we got a big appetizer, it was enough for two people. The chicken was super soft and steak was flavorful but kind of chewy. They only gave us 3 steak cubes.  BF had the gumbo and said it was pretty good. He ended up taking half of it home.  Sister ordered a side of Mac and cheese (6.50) and it was creamy, cheesy and delicious. Noodles were perfect, not too soft or hard.  Sisters BF ordered the fish tacos which came with 4, some rice and a side of black beans. He was only able to finish 2 and got the rest to go.  4/5 white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake I think. I wasn't a big fan of the white chocolate chips in the creamy cheesecake and didn't get too much macadamia nut but the cheesecake is really good!!  Total bill was $133"
Margie D.,"South Pasadena, CA",206,273,30,2.0,3/28/2016,"Sorry Cheesecake Factory. I know you can do so much better. Went with my wife and elderly in-laws for lunch on a Saturday. Of course we knew it would be crowded, so we waited until about 2pm to go. The place was packed, but we waited patiently for our turn to be seated. Our server was nice, but way overloaded with her tables. After she said hello and took drink order, we didn't see her again for a looonnnnng time. We had to ask someone to get her so we could place our order. Two in our party are insulin depedant diabetics who needed to be fed! The server acknowledged us on her way (with her arms fully loaded) to another table. But again, no return. We asked for manager's help. Server came over and apologized, took our order and disappeared. After another 30 minutes passed, all the bread was eaten, we again asked for help getting our food delivered. Food arrived a few minutes ater ice cold. End of story.  If you don't have enough servers to give each guest a good dining experience, then either hire more people or seat fewer guests."
Jose U.,"Long Beach, CA",46,10,10,1.0,7/8/2017,"Such a bad experience at this place tonight,  took my little especial needs brother to celebrate his birthday. When the food finally came out it was super cold, we had to send back every plate, didn't get out food back for about 45 minutes, the manager came to our table to see what was going on, when we told him about the issue he say oh ok,  I'll go check on the food.... Neither the server or the manager apologize for the food being cold.... Shame on the manager for not leading by example and apologizing to the customers for having a experience.... Needless to say I will not be coming back to this location....."
Sonja J.,"Lakewood, CA",39,13,3,4.0,2/15/2017,The service was prompt and waitress was very professional. The Shrimp was a little over cook but over all food was delious..
P M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/4/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory in many cities and have been to this one a handful of times.  Food is great, presentation excellent.  My issue is the ambiance.   Unless I visit on a weekday for lunch, the restaurant is loud, crowded with people waiting/standing.  During my last visit, the amount of foot traffic walking by constantly just killed it.  Numerous employees going to register station, etc.   It honestly just seemed chaotic and hard to relax and enjoy the dining experience.   I feel they build their locations in high rent spaces (malls) and not enough square feet.  Furthermore, they space them so far apart as to draw the traffic to offset the high cost build outs and rents, that it kills the ambiance.   Food is good but I dread the experience that they provide and only go when I have to please others."
Lucia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/17/2017,"Horrible service and drinks, flat beer and mixed drinks were watered down never going back"
Priyanka K.,"Cerritos, CA",202,278,78,3.0,3/25/2016,"By all the terrible reviews on this yelp page I went in with almost no expectations and I guess it worked out for me. I didn't have a horrible experience.  The food was good...came out relatively fast. The Mac and cheese bites appetizer was delicious.  Our server was pretty accommodating except never asked to refill our water even though we very obviously had finished our water early on in the meal. After the third time of trying to strategically place our water cups so the server would see it we justbasked for a refill. Someone came by to refill our water and spilled it everywhere...partly on my French fries. We ignored it.  There's a few kinks they need to work out like not asking someone what they want to drink before the party has even opened their menu but, the food was good. I still prefer the redondo beach location better."
Stocjia B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,10,4,5.0,7/15/2017,"Shannon was an amazing waitress. She made sure our large group of 8 people always had fresh drinks, was very attentive and had an amazing personality! It was my first time at the cheesecake factory and I will return for her bright smile and 5 star service. Please recognize her for her great service, she is an incredible team member that contributes wonderful service to her patrons!"
Evelyn C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,44,14,5.0,2/26/2017,Amazing delicious food with great servers. I've never had a bad experience here. Love the vegetarian/vegan options and the tropical smoothie is to die for!!!
Chanie S.,"West Covina, CA",5,109,291,4.0,10/12/2016,"Pleasant experience. I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and this particular was actually pretty big inside and out.  Loved the large outdoor eating section. We ended up eating inside because my boyfriend preffered inside. Which translates AC over sun.  I ordered the steak diane with salmon combo.  My boyfriend ordered the ribeye steak and everything was perfection. Everything came in a timely manner and our server even offered us extra bread.  I didn't care too much for the seasoning on the salmon but the steak diane was mouthwatering.  It had a hint of sweetness and saltiness with sliced mushrooms.  My boyfriend and I also agreed that his dish was quite tasty as well.  Service was also superb from the entire staff (hosts, service, runners etc).  I'm glad I was able to have a nice experience for my anniversary."
Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,2.0,3/16/2016,"Our Server was amazing and friendly...service was definitely on point. The lack of stars sadly is due to the kitchen. All of our meals were off. The burgers were way over cooked (requested medium and received charred) and sauces were left off the plates. The lettuce wrapped taco were ordered Mexican style but the Asian style is what arrived at the table. I received half of my dish with the rest of the table, and the remaining half showed up after everyone was half way through their meals. My food tasted good, but it was kind of lame to watch everyone else eating and all I had was a side of broccoli to munch on. I think this place just opened, so hopefully with a little practice the kitchen will catch up to the front of the house."
Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",629,573,156,4.0,3/5/2016,"Passion Fruit Mojito contains Captain Morgan, passion fruit, mint, and Cruzan Single Barrel Rum. This cocktail has a refreshing blend of sweet, tropical flavors. The sweet and tangy passion fruit balances well with the caramel flavor and spicy notes of the rum. Rating: 4.5/5 Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip is spinach, artichoke hearts, shallots, garlic, and a mixture of cheeses served bubbly hot with tortilla chips and salsa. This dip is gooey, creamy, cheesy deliciousness. The spinach adds a touch of greenness while the artichoke adds some sweetness. The addition of chopped tomatoes and sour cream add layer of multi-textural bites. Rating: 4.5/5 Pit Beef Dip is a Baltimore classic with char-roasted beef, melted fontina cheese, caramelized onions, au jus, and horseradish sauce on a grilled bun. This sandwich is reminiscent of a French dip. The beef is tender and juicy. The layer of creamy fontina cheese puts this sandwich out of the park. The sandwich just needs a sturdier bun to hold up to all of the beef juices so it doesn't get soggy. Rating: 4.5/5 Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken is fresh, all natural half chicken served with mashed potatoes, carrots, watercress, and topped with a light lemon garlic-herb sauce. The chicken is golden brown on the outside and tender on the inside. The herb flavors bring the chicken flavor forward. Easing back on the lemon would make the chicken just perfect. The carrots are perfectly cooked and sweet. Mashed potatoes are creamy, yet still have some chunks so you know they are made in house. Rating: 4.5/5 Oreo® Dream Extreme Cheesecake is creamy cheesecake layered with Oreo cookies, topped with Oreo cookie mousse, and chocolate icing. It is not nearly as sweet as you would imagine. Instead, it is decadently creamy, and very chocolatey. The texture of this cheesecake with keep your mouth happy from the soft cheesecake, velvety icing, and crunchy cookies. Presentation is also really nice too. Rating: 4/5"
Tina Z.,"Long Beach, CA",2,5,4,5.0,1/27/2017,"Amazing place!!!! I've been to 10different Cheesecake Factory's in different states and this one is definitely one of the best , can't wait to go back"
Caroline K.,"La Palma, CA",451,1315,4681,4.0,3/7/2016,"My review is solely for Happy Hour here, which they do Mon - Fri, I think 4 to 6 p.m.  You need to sit in the bar area to get HH prices, but the deals are great!  We had no issues getting a table around 5:30 p.m. on a week day.  They have a bunch of appetizers that are only $5.50 - and these are full-sized appetizers.  They don't give you a smaller portion during Happy Hour, which is awesome.  We got the corn cakes (came with three large ones), the Burger (which is really big), Nachos, deep fried mushroom and zucchini, and dumplings, which was more than enough for three people.  They also have a few specialty drinks for $5.50, including well drinks.  I got a Lemonade tasting one, and it didn't seem to have much alcohol at all, for $5.50 and my friend got the Long Island Iced Tea.  Our waitress was nice and attentive as well.  We had no issues with service.  One of my new HH spots, though mainly for food!"
Neina N.,"Long Beach, CA",38,17,9,2.0,2/26/2017,"Today my party of 6 were here celebrating my daughters 18th birthday. She's been at work all day and just wanted a nice dinner at a place we usually don't go to. We arrive at 6:11p 1hr 10min wait no prob. When being seated the seater never said a word except ""Your waiter will be right with you."" Usually you're asked if you're celebrating anything or welcome. Then our waiter Kevin (Which he never introduced himself. We found from the Mgr.) asked what drinks we'd like he brought the waters out pretty promptly. Then took our orders and appetizers. Bought the appetizers. We're out of water... No offer to refill. Then the food came out by 2 different ppl that wasn't Kevin. Then my husband tells my sister she see's a hair on her plate. Now we're eating and she's not.  Then he comes back to let my sis know her plate is being remade. Since he still didn't offer to refill our drinks I had to stop him from walking off again (for 20mins like he's been doing for a hr already) to ask him. 8mins later he's back with the refills and brings the birthday girl a strawberry lemonade and says ""Oh they handed made the wrong drink"" and proceeds to sit it on the table. I was mad now. My daughter asked for a refill of LEMONADE not STRAWBERRY LEMONADE. Why did he even bring it to the table?!!! Like she gonna drink it anyway. No bring her the lemonade. That took another 6mins. Because his ass wasn't paying attention. He was SOOOOO unattentive. Then the Mgr. Holly (like Hollywood) comes out apologizing for the hair. & that's when we told her about our waiter and that's when we found out his name. She did comp my sister's food which was a great gesture. And switched our waiter. The replacement was engaging, attentive, funny I mean he had turned it around for me at this point. But THEN.. I got hit in the eye with a tomato from the ppl across from us. They had a special needs child (I hope) that was giving them a hard time with sitting still and not yelling. He broke a glass and in that moment my sister said I don't feel safe sitting here and NOT EVEN 40SECS later (as I get ready to sign the check) a tomato smack dead in my eye!! These guest was allowing their child and so were the workers They're just looking instead of telling someone in charge that they may need to ask a guest to leave that may cause harm to others. I then before leaving found Holly and informed her that I just paid $162 to have a bad experience and that she might want to address the guest that's allowing they're child to throw food across the place. Because that could've been a glass or knife in my eye. She just said sorry. Cheesecake, Thanks for this horrible experience while trying to put a smile on my daughter face for her 18th birthday!   I see why you guys have the lowest ratings out of all the ones in my area. Guess I should've looked here before hand."
Pete T.,"Long Beach, CA",25,27,6,4.0,5/1/2017,"Cheese Cake Factory has always had excellent service at every location.  Our service this evening was excellent as we expect.  Wait staff was quick to refill drinks and bread without us asking.  She was super friendly and just did a great job making sure we were happy.  The Chicken Madeira was great as always, the Tuna Tataki Salad was really light and tasty.  A little Oreo Cheeses Cake to go and we were really satisfied."
Paul S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,2,,2.0,4/15/2017,I always look forward to dine in this place coz i love their Gumbo. But I was busy one day and ordered a To go. And i was shocked.
