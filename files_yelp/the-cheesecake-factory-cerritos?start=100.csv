Rita T.,"Cerritos, CA",25,10,3,1.0,8/31/2017,"We came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. After being seated, no one came with menus or drink offers. 10 minutes later, a server finally came and took our order. We ordered fried mac and cheese as the appetizer, my bf ordered the chicken and waffles, which comes with maple syrup. I ordered the chilaquiles, which comes with sour cream. The server brought out our waters and I asked for straws and lemon. We never got them. I had to ask again. And he handed the straws to another server and had her give them to us. So I asked her for lemons, and she got them to us right away. Our food came out, again, brought out by someone else, and the man told us the appetizer had to be ""remade because of some kitchen issues"". Apparently, the kitchen had a lot of issues, and they weren't the only ones. The chicken and waffles didn't come out with the syrup, and the chilaquiles didn't have sour cream. Our original server NEVER came to check up on us. I had to as another server, again, for syrup and sour cream. Our server saw me ask someone else for help, so he mosied on over and asked how everything came out. I told him everything didn't come out. And asked him, to be sure, if the chicken came with syrup, and if the chilaquiles came with sour cream. He was like, ""uh...I think so"". Seriously? Then he looks at us and LITERALLY asked, ""so do you guys still want the syrup and sour cream?""  DUDE. Why are you working as a server in a restaurant?  We told him yeah. And asked about our appetizer. He said he'll ""check up on it."" Of course, someone else brought out the syrup and sour cream. Our food was cold by now. And someone else brought out our mac and cheese. How exciting. Never even refilled our waters. Quite possible THE WORST dining experience we've ever had."
Ducky C.,"Downey, CA",931,72,43,4.0,4/24/2017,"I saw bad reviews but it wasn't that bad. Consistent with service, but you definitely do have to ask more than the having the time to help you. Food came in all out at once."
Troy K.,"Buena Park, CA",4,31,31,5.0,12/7/2017,I don't normally give out 5 Stars unless the person goes over and beyond what I feel they should do. Our waitress did do exactly that she explain to us what every meal was what was in the food.sheshe asked us every single time she came by the table if there was anything else that we needed. we didn't run out of anything because our waitress was that good. I will be going back to this particular cheesecake factory.
Sylvia R.,"South Gate, CA",22,42,58,5.0,6/5/2017,"Much better experience. We waited for about 15 minutes, as promised. The server was on top of our orders. He demonstrated knowledge about the stuff in the menu and was never rude. The inside of the restaurant and restroom was clean. The food was scrumptious and very well prepared."
Eleiana F.,"Long Beach, CA",2,22,18,4.0,7/16/2017,"The last time I was here my boyfriend and I had the shrimp and chicken pasta jambalaya. It was ok, it needed a bit more flavor. But I must admit the cheesecakes are delicious."
Jenn K.,"Cerritos, CA",78,246,66,5.0,9/15/2017,"From the Happy Hour to the seasonal cheesecakes!! This place is great for any occasion, I enjoy coming here for dinner although it does get busy quickly and unfortunately THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS!! sorry guys!! But i will tell you the food is completely worth the wait!! the service here tends to be slow but the portion sizes and the quality of food outweighs the slow service. I always order from the speciality menu which has my favorite dish the Chicken Madeira. Imagine bitting into the most juiciest pieces of chicken covered in melted cheese with mushroom Madeira sauce that just coats your mouth with so many incredible flavors of comfort food that will make you sleepy yet happy. The dish is paired with whipped potatoes and crunchy asparagus. This dish and all dishes at Cheesecake can feed about 2 people so its great to get 2 different dishes and share the dishes with friends or family or someone special. Pair the meal with a nice refreshing beverage and end the most fulfilling meal with a dense dessert. Oh dont forget about the endless bread!!"
Letty L.,"Bakersfield, CA",29,12,11,5.0,7/12/2017,Absolutely terrific! Service is great & the food ahhh so delicious! You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory!
Rachel I.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",8,88,49,1.0,5/5/2017,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME !!!! It was not long of a wait so my husband and I decided to stay for dinner. We got seated pretty quickly. Our server came and took our drinks and appetizer. After we got our drinks it took 30mins for her to come back and take are order, and at this time we still haven't gotten our crab bites appetizer!! We waited alittle longer and still nothing !!! People who sat and ordered the same time we did, had gotten there appetizers and was getting there food as we waited and had enough we got up and wanted to leave!!! The manager just said she'll comp our crab bites that we're no where to be found, but we were tried of waiting so we left !!  I'm more upset cause I'm 9 months pregnant and my husband works a lot so when we have date night it's rare and we don't have much time left that we can go out as much. So to me this was all such a bummer and such bad service and such a waste of time !!!"
Patricia C.,"La Mirada, CA",63,357,369,4.0,9/2/2016,"My friend and I decided to come to Cheesecake Factory for their happy hour before we shopped at Cerritos Mall. We ordered cream cheese wontons, the kale and sausage flatbread, and the shrimp summer (spring) rolls. Everything was delicious and the total came out to about $20 which is a good deal, considering how much food we got!  I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory and I'm happy that they still have their weekday happy hour menu."
Alice K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",121,29,68,1.0,9/23/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is a definite pass for dinner. Compared to other locations, the quality is just not there.  We ordered: Cajun chicken and shrimp jambalaya, BBQ chicken pizza, chicken bellagio, and the chicken carbonara.  The Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta is normally a fave, but the pasta was extremely overcooked that it looked like one soggy mess. I had to return it bc it was inedible, but the second go around wasn't any better. It was kind of disappointing (the pasta was cooked fine, but then there was little sauce and little protein which was awkward bc the first time was fine).  The BBQ chicken pizza had no cheese on it. Everything else was just okay. We have noticed that this location offers smaller portions of the same dish too."
Special B.,"Bellflower, CA",112,11,3,3.0,10/10/2017,"I didn't want to go to this location based off the reviews, but it was the closest one so I went anyway. This was my first time going to a Cheesecake Factory and I agree with pretty much every one else about the service being horrible. The set up was a little confusing when I first walked in, and it didn't help that there was no one there to immediately greet me and tell me where to go. Not at all what you expect in a restaurant like this. However, the food was delicious. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. Cooked & seasoned perfectly. I would go again just for the food."
Kim C.,"Lakewood, CA",1,14,12,5.0,3/16/2017,"This review is based on multiple trips to this particular location.  I am surprised at the low rating this location has. I've been here many many times and each time I had a pretty good experience. The wait time is and will always be awhile if you are going during prime time. All my servers are always kind and attentive. Being a highschool student, restaurants like Cheesecake Factory usually give less attentive and overall service but that was not the case for me. Drinks and bread is always served in a timely matter from the time we are seated. During busier days food will always take longer but not so long that you will be left filling yourself with bread.  Food is always delicious and well made. My favorite is the Alfredo and a mound of grated cheese over top. The only problems I have had was that on busier days they sometimes forget to ask you if you want grated cheese on top and since they need to focus on other customers they take awhile to hand you the check.  Overall great experience."
Ben L.,"Long Beach, CA",855,313,3464,3.0,2/10/2016,"I was excited to try this new location because I have been a fan of Cheesecake Factory in the past. I of course checked yelp first to see how it's been doing, and was surprised to see a two and a half star rating. Many of the reviews are based on poor service and wait times. I was hoping that at least the food would be good. We got lucky because the rest of our party was already there, so we didn't have to wait. We sat right down at our table. One of the people in my party had trouble receiving olives for his martini, while another person never got the appetizer she ordered (although the latter was not really the fault of the server; the dish she tried to order apparently did not exist?). (Skip this paragraph if you don't want to read about kids.) My kids rely on apple juice at restaurants. One of my sons doesn't handle milk very well. We ordered apple juice for the kids (as usual), but the server informed us that apple juice does not come with kids meals. We chose to get milk instead, because we don't want our kids drinking soda. Anyway, after the server left we took a closer look at the kids menu, and apple juice is clearly listed as one of the options. My son had already guzzled a ton of milk, so I was worried that he would throw it up if he also drank apple juice. The server apologized for his mistake and brought out the apple juices in addition to the milk, at no extra charge. In the end, this situation just left a sour taste in my mouth. I still gave three stars instead of two because the food was actually quite good. The strawberry lemonade was refreshing and excellent. The egg roll sampler was quite delicious. They were crispy and tasty. The calamari was fresh, crisp, and delectable. My steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo was good. The sauce that came with the steak was flavorful, and complimented the steak well. I requested medium rare but received medium, but I ate it anyway. The shrimp were seasoned right and not too heavy. The mashed potatoes and veggies were good as well. The vanilla bean cheesecake was rich, indulgent, potent, and packed with vanilla flavor. After dining here, the two and a half star rating totally makes sense to me. Many people are being rubbed the wrong way by poor service. I can't speak from experience about the wait times, as I did not have to wait, but I have heard many yelpers complain about the lack of a reservation system. We went on a Thursday night and the place was jam packed. If you're going on the weekend, good luck."
Maria E.,"Long Beach, CA",17,21,35,4.0,5/17/2017,Really good dessert. Food was good too. We  normally get the tiramisu cheesecake. $53 for the whole tiramisu cheesecake. Good for special events.
Erica P.,"Downey, CA",0,17,,5.0,12/5/2017,Great service and food but be prepared to make the wait if you go during to the busy times. Parking is pretty bad but that's just how it is everywhere. The cheesecakes are worth the wait
Ying L.,"Seal Beach, CA",39,237,226,2.0,8/4/2016,"We went there on Sunday around 5pm for dinner and waited until 6pm to get a table. We sat at the patio and we noticed the ground was filled with food.  The hostess said she will have someone to clean it but no one did.  We told the waitress and she was very nice and cleaned it up.  It took 30 mins for our food to come out.  We ordered the kid's meal chicken strips with fries, steak Diane and the shrimp pasta.  Only the kids' meal was hot.  The other 2 dishes where just lightly warm.   I don't like eating cold food especially I am paying $20 for an entree."
Jay K.,"Downey, CA",0,35,12,3.0,4/2/2017,"Wait is so LONG, staff are rude! but food is amazing.. but its not worth the wait, I go to other location now since this one is shitty"
Shanel W.,"Long Beach, CA",1,22,41,5.0,8/7/2016,"I was hesitant at first due to the poor reviews. However i have been waiting to go to this new location and I have to say they must have read their review because my experience was 5 stars!  Yes there was a wait time of about 40 minutes for 2 but come on. This location is at a mall and on a Sunday afternoon. From my lemon drop martini to my miso salmon to my take home ultimate red velvet cheesecake I have to say this was the best Cheesecake experience out of any other location.  Don't let the poor reviews fool you, review for yourself!!!! :)"
Mac M.,"Long Beach, CA",38,9,2,1.0,3/16/2017,First time eating and ordering anything from Cheesecake Factory. Beet and Cheese salad it sucked ass. Never again! Where were the beets and cheese? Waited 30 min for shit!
Rodney S.,"Cerritos, CA",4926,799,5559,4.0,1/25/2016,"Say cheesecake! My first & only visit to The Cheesecake Factory was almost a decade & a half ago at the Redondo Beach location.  A nice al fresco dinner overlooking the marina made for a  romantic evening.  Fast forward to today, and my mall, the Los Cerritos Center, now has the honor of having the latest brand spanking new location, located in the former wing of the old Nordstrom's location next to Forever 21. Entering through the mall entrance, an art deco theme greeted the bustling lunch crowd of this latest local eatery.   Diners are welcomed with complimentary bread (wheat & sourdough) & butter. After browsing the small plates, snacks & appetizers, I decided upon the eggroll sampler- A plate of all Cheesecake Factory's eggrolls, the eggroll sampler consisted of avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban & Firecracker Salmon, including accompanying sauces.   Tex Mex - spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions & melted cheese Crispy Cuban - slow roasted pork, ham, melted Swiss, pickles & mustard Firecracker Salmon - My second favorite, with spiced salmon rolled in spinach Avocado - My absolute favorite, with avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion & cilantro.  The thick chunks of avocado provided unctuous creaminess with each bite.  I also preferred the tamarind-cashew dipping sauce, using it the most of all four. Service was good.  My attendant made a mistake with my change, but was quick & apologetic.  Seating seems ample with booths.  On the mall side, there is an ""al fresco"" area to enjoy the cool, crisp mall air.  Good to people to watch & for people to watch you.  Harkins Theatre is soon to open next door, making dinner & a movie a snap. Parking is at the Los Cerritos Center.  The dedicated entrance for The Cheesecake Factory is next to Forever 21, located on the 605 freeway side of the mall.  The mall entrance is the old Nordstrom wing, in the middle of the Pacsun & Forever 21 entrances. The Cheesecake Factory now rolls out their sinfully delectable cheesecakes, along with their varied menu, in a more convenient location for me.  It's nice to have another local eatery to choose from, in the ever expanding Cerritos food scene.  I enjoyed my eggroll sampler & I look forward to exploring the rest of the menu, cheesecake notwithstanding. Highly recommend! NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM"
