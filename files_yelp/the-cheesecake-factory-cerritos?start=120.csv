Jesse G.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,11,2,1.0,5/7/2017,Sad to share two and a half hour wait. Granddaughter is crying because she was hungry... Did the CheeseCake factory front desk care ? I turned in my beeper thanks for your service on a non holiday busy weekend eve !!!! Reason the server in that area was not available so my guess there's no plan or back up to accommodate the customer....
JP G.,"Riverside, CA",197,49,5,1.0,7/27/2017,Went in for my friends birthday and was told a 2hr wait...we were ok with that but an hour later we were told a 2hr wait again. The manager (Chris) was rude and told the party to stop asking about wait. When you keep adding hrs on top of hours there is a reason to check on how much longer. Would never recommend this place to anyone for any reason. Worst customer service I ever been witness to
Rayshawn W.,"Paramount, CA",820,560,2232,3.0,1/16/2016,"Back to the CheeseCake factory yet again but a different location. As I stated in a past review, my issue with this place is despite the number of times I've visited (multiple locations)...I've yet to find a dish besides appetizers and cheesecakes that I liked nor can recommend to others when asked. Due to this, I decided to keep it simple with a sandwich and it was actually decent.  This marks the first time I've come across a dish here that I liked and would order again. This came in the form of the grilled chicken and avocado club. The chicken was moist and flavorful. There was also a nice portion of avocado on the sandwich. This was nowhere near as hefty as other plates here. If there's anything The Cheesecake Factory does right, it's serve large portions but my sandwich was enjoyable and that's what counts more to me. Since I have family that really loves this place and I mean really really loves this place (cough cough, my brother & mom) I know another visit is inevitable. At least now, I won't be looking through the menu helplessly while the waiter has already taken everyone else's order and is waiting on me to make a decision LOL. I now have a selection to fall back on if all else fails. Dinner 1/12/2016"
Bree J.,"Fullerton, CA",10,15,7,5.0,6/4/2017,"Great food, atmosphere, and Cheesecake. Our waiter was attentive and nice. I'd recommend this location to a friend."
Herman A.,"Cerritos, CA",40,7,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Stay away from this Cheesecake Factory, my wife and I wanted to have a late lunch at this restaurant in Cerritos as we checked in we waited for approximately 10 min to get seated and it was empty. Once we were seated we waited for service for another 10 min no water no waiter so we decided to leave. Will never go there again......"
Klarissa A.,"Buena Park, CA",0,3,,3.0,9/12/2017,Love coming & dining here. The cheesecake is obviously delicious.especially when it comes to there pumpkin. The server that helped us was so cheerful and brought our food out right away. Will definitely be coming back again.
Angelina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,6,11,4.0,10/3/2017,"I went during the dinner rush. By the way, there is no call ahead seating. However, despite the 20-25 minute wait for 2 people, the food came out at a decent amount of time. The buffalo bites is new & a must try. Gillian, our waitress, was a delight & very accommodating.  She was attentive & easy to locate when I needed something. The only thing I did not care for was the dim lighting, which only got darker within two hours. Overall: bc of our waitress,  we had a great evening."
Sam S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",40,13,,1.0,8/12/2017,Don't get me wrong we love The Cheesecake Factory but last time we were at the Cerritos location we had the worst service from our waitress Regina not sure what her last name was but we never got refills someone else had to get us a refill after we had to ask a random person walking by and pretty much the only time she was at our table was when she took our order. This experience was horrible and the worst service we've  had at any place ever! It made us not want to go back to any Cheesecake Factory. I would steer clear of this location and make the drive down to another. Think if we did go back we'll just drive down to the one in Huntington Beach where we haven't had a bad experience yet.
Amber M.,"Anaheim, CA",501,123,461,4.0,1/6/2017,"I love this Cheesecake Factory location. It's located in the Cerritos Mall. It gets very crowded but it's worth the wait. I ordered avocado  egg rolls, chicken taco lettuce wraps. My cousin ordered tortilla soup and crab cake bites. She also ordered lemon  meringue Cheesecake. Avocado egg rolls were absolutely splendid! I didn't care for the lettuce wrap tacos. They were flavorless! My cousin liked everything she ordered. That lemon meringue cheesecake was divine. Overall, if you don't mind fighting for a parking space and a 15 to 35 minute wait, come for the food. You won't be sorry."
Autumn W.,"Long Beach, CA",10,5,2,5.0,9/29/2017,Love this Cheesecake Factory!  Kudos to the manager Sara and our server Brittany for making our dinner great this evening!   Key lime cheesecake was awesome!
Erica F.,"Rosemead, CA",118,4,1,5.0,8/18/2017,Came in here today on a date with my daughter and we had such a great experience however when we got up from the table we left our leftovers behind. We walked the mall for a bit and realized we did not have our food. We return to the restaurant and spoke to the senior manager Chris. Informed him of what happen and he was more than happy to replace our meals. That's what you call great customer service. For sure will return due to his generosity.
Rowena A.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,90,94,2.0,3/31/2017,"I came to sit and eat dinner as I've had a very long, hectic week.  I place my order with the waiter.  He brings my food in a timely manner; however, I didn't have a fork.  So I had to wait for him to come which he didn't.  I called him over, asked for the utensil.  He said okay and walked away.  I sat for well over 10 minutes before he brought me the requested utensil.  He comes back apologizing.  I understand people forget but I'm sitting here like ""how am I supposed to eat this salad?"" It just seems as if every time I come here solo, the waiters/waitresses seem to forget I'm here."
Flora Daisy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,17,169,4.0,6/14/2017,Love their balconies  it feels nice in a sunny day to chill with family or great friends  and their menu Yummy
Leana E.,"Cerritos, CA",158,147,397,1.0,7/4/2016,"Came here on my lunch break, big mistake. Everytime I come here, they forget to serve us. No waters, no bread, no service. Just menus. I didn't come here just to look at a menu. Drake, why do you love to go here??????"
Bella B.,"Cerritos, CA",214,230,1042,4.0,12/14/2015,"Yay, there's finally, and I mean FINALLY a Cheesecake Factory in the Cerritos vicinity. We came here a week or so after it opened. The service was slow but decent. I ordered garlic spaghettini and two kids meals the corn dog meal was awful. Neither of my kids would eat it so I returned it and the server kindly took it off our bill. I felt bad, so we ordered an extra slice of Cheesecake to go.  I thought the garlic spaghettini was quite good here. My kids loved it and so did I. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked with plenty of mushrooms and asparagus on top. We had the red velvet cheesecake for dessert. That was quite scrumptious as well.  We're going back soon with a huge party of kids and adults. I wonder if my review will change! Dun dun dun..."
Heather S.,"Cerritos, CA",15,26,10,2.0,1/18/2017,"Two stars only because the cheesecake is good.  Came here on Thursday evening when it wasn't busy, got seated within two minutes max. The family was a little late, so I ordered a water and strawberry lemonade. The strawberry lemonade came....and the water came ten minutes later after I asked again. The waitress was extremely slow. She was attentive when my mom's pasta came out a lot saltier than expected, but it took forever to remake. She seemed a little frazzled, maybe a bad day? But nonetheless, she wasn't a very good waitress. We waited twenty minutes to get the cheesecakes for desserts, one for here and one to go. The one to go was smushed in the bag, but I didn't complain because it probably would come twenty minutes later.  The price was a bit steep for what we were getting.  I usually like going to the Cheesecake Factory, but probably will not come to this location again."
Sandra L.,"Lakewood, CA",874,112,1057,3.0,12/11/2015,"Let me start off by saying Samantha was wonderful! She is extremely friendly and professional. We enjoyed her service.  It was 4 of us that dined at this location inside the mall around 6:00pm yesterday.  We ordered the American Cheeseburger, Mac n Cheese Cheeseburger, Chicken Belagio, and Stuffed Chicken Tortillas.  I was disappointed with the burger meals, nothing special for the cost (approx $13.50 each burger meal). The pasta dish was dry, but you can taste the flavor.  The best thing we tried that night was probably the white chocolate chip with caramel slice of cheesecake."
Laura G.,"Bell, CA",177,217,459,4.0,8/20/2017,"I have only tried cheesecake at this location in Cerritos. I love the food here, the good taste never goes away. The service is always on point. I've had Victor serve me twice and his service is great. I also tried the Nutella Hazelnut cheesecake and OMG.. it is amazing! I love coming here and will come back."
Janai G.,"Long Beach, CA",2,28,4,1.0,7/8/2017,"If I could give it no stars I would. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. We usually eat at the HB location but tonight we visited Cerritos. I don't even know where to start.  Our food took FOREVER to come out. That's fine. I get it. Maybe the kitchen got slammed. BUT OUR FOOD WAS COLD!!  The cheese was congealed, and orange chicken looked like it was left over from yesterday.  Not only did our server not apologize but THE MANAGER didn't either!!!  And it took an extra long time for my husband to get his food the second time around and it still wasn't how it ush is every other time he gets it.  I just can't even wrap my brain around that. We ended up Being there for over 2 1/2 hours....definitely NOT by choice. Had to cancel our plans that we had planned for after dinner bc it was too late. And really....seeing the kitchen staff and servers smoking right outside one of the wide exits is   So $108 later we had a crap meal. Below mediocre service and a waste of an evening. Lame. I will be calling the corporate office on Monday."
Kathlyn D.,"Lakewood, CA",163,119,711,2.0,11/28/2015,"Went here on a Sunday around 5pm... Bad idea. Went up to the hostess to write my name down for 3. She said the current wait time was 2 hours. We told her patio or inside seating was okay, I thought it would be quicker that way. We ended up waiting.  So it's been 1 hour and something minutes, I go up and ask the hostess how long we have left. She tells us ""for a party of 4, you still have 45 minutes left"" We told her in the beginning we were a party of 3... I don't know if her adding 1 more person made our wait time longer but whatever I just corrected her and said I had a party of 3 and then told her if she can just make it a party of 2 (my dad left, and couldn't wait 2 hours).  After we told her we were a party of 2, 5 minutes later our beeper buzzes. Thank god.  Once we got seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come and introduce herself. She asked what we wanted to drink. Our drinks came our really quick, she even gave us bread. What took so long is for her to finally ask what we wanted to order. So for like 30 minutes we were just drinking our drinks and eating bread. Long story short this place takes forever! Went in at 5pm came out at 8pm. A majority of that time we were just waiting! I'm glad I didn't get any attitudes from any of the workers just like the past reviewers got, which is why I gave them 2 stars. The wait time is just terrible. We were so full from eating bread that we hardly even touched our food. We ate for like 10 minutes and asked if they could wrap up our food for to go.  So sad about this place. It's the closest Cheesecake Factory to me. Hopefully they improve, will probably come and check it out again in like 3 months or so. Hopefully that is enough to time to get them all trained.  Also tried their cheesecake and soooo sweet. I recommend sharing. P.s. They don't put napkin or anything under their silverware. I hope they clean their tables well.."
