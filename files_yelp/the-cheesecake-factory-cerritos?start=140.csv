Timmy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",503,1624,2998,3.0,11/18/2015,"I arrived here for an early lunch right after they opened. From 11-12, the time I was here, the place was not crowded at all - plenty of empty tables. Located on the back side of Los Cerritos Center next to Forever 21, this place is huge with a large outdoor patio plus several tables along the side of the restaurant inside the mall. I ordered a tropical iced tea to drink and the Carolina BBQ Pork Sandwich with a green salad.  The service here was excellent (until the end; more on that later) - very attentive with a smile. The kitchen, however, was painfully slow. It took a long time for my food to come out (close to 30 minutes) considering the place wasn't busy. Luckily my waitress brought me some delicious warm bread to keep me from being overly antsy. The green salad was dullsville - only greens with one slice of tomato. The pork sandwich was good. To quote the menu, it consisted of ""Tender Pulled Pork, Crispy Bacon, and Slow Roasted Applewood Smoked Bacon Topped with Creamy Cole Slaw on a Grilled Bun with Pickles and B.B.Q. Sauce."" I have to admit that it tasted as good as the description sounds although it doesn't come close to rivaling pulled pork you'd get at a legit BBQ place.  Since this was Cheesecake Factory of course I needed to get some cheesecake even though I'm not much of a cheesecake person. I ordered a seasonal flavor - pumpkin pecan. She screwed up and brought me a regular pumpkin but I didn't notice until I'd taken a bite. I could have sent it back but I liked the pumpkin enough not to bother. It did have FAR too much whipped cream though.  Although I had a decent meal here I won't be back anytime soon due to prices on everything being too high and because cheesecake isn't my favorite thing in the world."
Gerri M.,"Downey, CA",214,75,66,4.0,2/4/2017,I love Cheesecake Factory and have been to this location on numerous occasions. The only pet peeve I have to say about this location is that the wait tends to be long on Friday nights and Sunday days. If you visit this location on off times then the edit is not too bad.  What can I say. Food here is ALWAYS delicious.
Julie B.,"Cerritos, CA",402,384,1873,1.0,11/15/2015,"I had the bright idea to order takeout from this newly opened CF location at the Cerritos Mall. I was tired after work and saw online that this CF had curbside takeout so I decided to call in an order for dinner for myself and my son. Called, placed my order and the woman assisting me told me I could pull in to one of their dedicated curbside takeout spots or pull into a side alley if all the spots were taken and someone would come right out with my food. Arrived right when they told me my order would be ready and called to let them know all the curbside spots were taken and I was driving around trying to figure out where to park since the alley I was told about was nowhere to be found. The woman on the phone ""umm'd"" and ""ahh'd"" and seemed flustered. She didn't know what to tell me and then said ""we're really busy"". Yeah, not something I want or need to hear as I'm circling and circling. She puts me on hold and while I'm on hold a curbside spot opens up and I park. When I'm connected again, I explained again that I'm here to pick up my order and where I'm parked. I tell her specifically that I've brought exact change so they can bring my food right out.  I wait another 10 mins and someone comes out but he didn't bring my food. I ask him why he didn't bring the food since I have exact change and I had told the woman over the phone that I did and he said no one notified him. So after I pay he had to go all the way back to get my food. I wait another almost 10 mins and finally get my food. When I get home and finally tuck into the chicken salad sammy with my son, I notice immediately there are no almonds in the salad (the chix salad is supposed to have almonds). So to add to the bad pickup experience, my sandwich wasn't even prepared correctly. Womp, womp. I get that this is a brand new location, but unless they work on their communication and make sure only those customers picking up are really utilizing their curbside parking spots (I looked at all the cars in the curbside spots and none of them had people inside waiting for their takeout), I won't ever be ordering takeout from this CF again. For something marketed as a convenience, my curbside takeout was anything but."
John B.,"Whittier, CA",55,120,35,2.0,1/14/2017,"UPDATE: So, per the below message from CF to email them via their website, I sent them a complete letter of everything that happened, including dates and times, and never heard back; it's been approximately two weeks, nothing. Pity. Going forward, and based our last experience, I advise anyone that goes to this restaurant and needs any kind of ACA accommodation to either speak with the manager right away, visit a different location, or look elsewhere. Anecdotally, my wife and I went to the Brea Mall location for years, and never once were I or anyone else in our party treated like this by the hosting staff. Caveat emptor. -- 1/14/2017 -- -- The wait staff and manager were very kind and accommodating. The food, as always, is delicious. However, their hosts and hostesses at the front of the restaurant are poorly, if not completely untrained with regard to ADA compliance and disability accommodation. If you have a disability, I would recommend simply asking for a manager up-front until their front line people are properly trained.  My party and I arrived at around 2:30pm on Friday afternoon. Two of us requires a place to sit for ADA-related reasons. The host did nothing to accommodate. We decided to sit in the bar area because there were empty seats available. A customer even offered my friend and I a seat bc it was obvious she and I were unable to stand stationary in the lobby.  Once my wife had finished parking the car, she came in to sit with us in the bar area. No sooner did the hostess tell us we had to leave. Â We asked why, this was the bar area? The tables were not even bussed yet. We were told that the tables in the bar area are part of normal seating accommodation. We then asked for a place to sit while we wait for our main table, so she put a chair (1) outside--yes, really. Feelings of ostracism beginning to set in.  Once the hostess came back to tell us we could go sit outside in our one (1) chair , we explained that sitting outside would actually be more problematic because it required us to walk back outside before walking back in again, and getting up and sitting down and walking back/forth are painful.  The hostess then decides to put one (1) chair inside, in the main lobby, right by the front door where all the incoming and outgoing traffic was pushing and shoving its way by.  At this point, it was clear they did not want us here. I was ready to leave, so was my wife. Our pager went off and our table came up only to wait in one giant line for them to seat us. People coming in were even confused, asking repeatedly ""is this the line to sign in? No this is the line for getting a table."" People with walkers in front of us, being told to stand and wait in a long ""bread line"" while being shoved and/or gridlocked by wait staff and outgoing customers was just awful. It was pure chaos.  Finally, the waitstaff decided to sit us all the way in the very back of the restaurant, right next to the exit. I'm not kidding. All the way to the very back of the restaurant, right next to the exit.  We requested a manager immediately after being seated. Once the manager came out, he listen to our concerns, and explained that he would address this issue with the front staff. Apologies and understanding were offered, the rest of our visit was fine. Our waitress was excellent."
Richard H.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,33,7,5.0,9/8/2017,"Been here 20+ times, always a wait, always noisy....because it is VERY popular. Get over it people. If you want a quiet , empty restaurant try somewhere else. If the GM gives your entire party free cheese cake to resolve a seating issue ...remember, ( popular = crowded) take it, say thank you, slamming them on yelp is bush league. Waitresses are always nice, Cobb salad is the best out there and the cheese cake is fantastic. I will continue to go, wait patiently for our table for 20-30 min and have to talk over the noise and enjoy every thing about it."
Dora T.,"Alhambra, CA",50,48,57,2.0,1/11/2017,"My first time to this location I was very disappointed with the service.  During my dining experience, our waitress was MISSING most of the time. Service was very slow, and it wasn't even a busy Tuesday lunch. We literally had to ask another waitress for forks to eat because when the food arrived at our table there was no utensils! Do you really expect us to eat with our bare hands?! And then I asked for my coffee refill and she did not bother to come refill my coffee until after the check arrived!  This location ruin my whole Cheesecake Factory experience. I will never return to this location ever again."
Jenny D.,"Lakewood, CA",210,23,25,1.0,1/12/2017,"Came here tonight expecting a delicious dinner but got otherwise. Let's start off with our waitress, Crystalyn. First off, when she first introduced herself to us, she didn't say her name. I found out her name from her helper Shannnon! (We met Shannon when we were finished eating. Wish we met her from the beginning) Second, she forgot to give us straws and napkins. Third, she checked up on us once. Just once! As I was looking around, the waiter for the table next to me continuously checked on them, more then 5 times! (Yes I was counting) I even asked him for the straws because my waitress was no where to be found! This was a Thursday night & it wasn't busy at all. Lastly, the food was completely bland.  Wouldn't come back here any time soon because I'd never want a waitress like Crystalyn."
SophtheWeim H.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,30,5,5.0,4/10/2017,"Another great Cheesecake location, same interior set up as expected with other locations. Â Take out parking spots are available for take away orders. Â Staff is fast, friendly and professional here. Â  While waiting for my take out order I noticed an employee at the take out counter touching dirty handles then grabbing slices of cheesecake for placement in to go containers. Â Keep in mind that when packaging Cheesecake to go, the employee grabs the slice(s) with a gloved hand. Â Even though the employee was wearing gloves (like they normally do) employees should be trained that just because your wearing gloves doesn't mean you can touch dirty surfaces and food interchangeably, once the dirty surface is touched then new gloves need to be put on.  Once I alerted the cashier about my concern she immediately told the employee who then changed her gloves out. Â  I noticed a similar practice in the Chipotle food chain just before they had those major issues exposed through the media. Â It is critical for the chains to accurately train staff preventing illness. Besides the hiccup the food here is really good. Â Ordered the popular Orange Chicken and Chicken Romano and it was fresh. Â Take away staff that delivers items to your car is exceptional."
Seth R.,"Sylmar, CA",16,7,,1.0,12/27/2016,OMG!! Can they get the food right??? Â We ordered three of the same dish and had to return one twice and another three times. WTF??  MANAGER O manager where forth art thou manager? And please give them enough authorization to actually make things right for the customer! It'll be a looooooong time before I pass through these doors.
Stephanie B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/22/2017,"My family and I came in for a birthday with a party of 10 and were treated badly from the second we arrived. The staff did not give us an accurate wait time and originally told us 50 minutes which turned into over 2 hrs. They lied and said there was another large party they were waiting on to leave so they could seat us but it turns out the so-called party/table didn't exist. Once we were seated, the service was horrible and slow. The waiter complained about every request we made and acted as though we were a burden. We aren't sure if it was a race thing or if we were discriminated on because we were a large party but we will never be dining here again."
Yazmin P.,"South Gate, CA",37,11,3,2.0,5/18/2017,"Two stars only because of the promptness, we were sat waaaay quicker than our wait time. Our server was decent, but the food was just not worth the hype. $20 for a plate of flavor-less fettucini alfredo drowned in sauce??? No thanks."
Juliana N.,"Anaheim, CA",144,84,256,2.0,2/28/2017,This is one of the busiest ones we didn't eat here because it was a 3.5 hour wait. They don't allow reservations like all of them....But if it's gonna be that busy where it's like the day after Thanksgiving at the mall then why even try with a (for me normal size) group of 10. Pointless.
Genie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",273,209,877,4.0,8/28/2016,"Came in at 2pm on a Saturday thinking that it would be less crowded, but nope, it was still a 45-minute wait for 2. Luckily, we aren't picky with where we sit so we opted for 2 stools at the bar. Bartender was a great server as well as a bartender! Food was decent, tasted just like any other Cheesecake Factory. It was national cheesecake day/weekend so it was 1/2 off cheesecake slices, yay!"
Mike L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",33,48,12,1.0,8/23/2017,"Left. After waiting forever for service. They ignored us. Short handed I understand. But could have acknowledged us and said, ""I'll be right with you. "" now I have to eat at the food court."
Daniel Q.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/31/2017,"Out of all the CF in OC I find the Cerritos location the best. Great place to have a quiet dinner after a long day. Food was great as usual, only 4 stars because of the wait time. Servers are friendly, and silverware is clean."
Casey T.,"La Palma, CA",829,33,61,4.0,6/15/2016,"I don't really see why people review this place as bad... Well maybe things have changed but here's my opinion haha I think it's nice to come here with family or group of friends (at most 4) or with your significant other. The wait time is roughly 10-15 min since the place is packed and the food takes around 30-40 min to prepare. They are so huge in portions though, so be prepared to be filled up! The environment is nice and the waiters I had were really friendly. I also think it's important to know what you are ordering because there's a lot of food on the menu without any pictures ! IT'S ALSO EXPENSIVE!!"
Jovana A.,"South Gate, CA",0,3,5,1.0,9/10/2017,waiter hannah never brought my refill after telling her twice and the food was very bad extremly greasy pasta last time i come here again!!
Sergin Z.,"Torrance, CA",8,52,17,1.0,1/29/2017,"Thank you to the unconcerned cashier, who does not care their customers. It was a bad experience that I tried to buy a slice of cheesecake on my way to home, I was so tired. She did not care about I was waiting in front of her like maybe more than 5 minutes that she was doing nothing, even she was not busy. Never again, I love their cheesecake but I will never buy from them again"
Charles V.,"Long Beach, CA",155,176,553,2.0,11/8/2015,"Since this place just opened recently, the wait was longer than expected, they put 5 people in a table for 4 with an extra chair on the side, i saw a group of four on the larger booths. found a tooth pick in one of the orders. It was so busy that some staffs are confused what's happening. I'll let them slide off and hopefully they'll become better.  Everything worked out towards the end. My review will change in a couple of weeks once everything settles down."
Christopher M.,"La Habra, CA",0,22,,5.0,11/18/2017,"Just wanted to take the time to tell you guys how awesome my date night was. Our drinks were amazing and food was awesome. Our server named Devan was amazing!! I highly recommend management take the time to noice how awesome he was. Devan, was funny accommodating and super fast with his service. Honestly best cheesecake experience I've had in a long time and Devan was definitely apart of that. Keep hiring people like Devan because his service was great."
