Suzanne Michelle R.,"New York, NY",349,50,52,3.0,6/16/2016,"Came Wednesday for lunch at 12. Didn't get seated until 1:20. Lots of people waiting. Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but know that it will be a hit or miss for you as far as wait time.  Server was Tony. Tatted hipster looking guy, really personable, and knew menu well.  If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, know that the portions are enormous and the menu is LOOOOOOOOOOONG, which explains why you're not going to get the ""best"" tasting fettuccine Alfredo you've ever had; they're about volume here and you're paying for selection and portion size. Let's just say you won't be a regular unless you are a social eater/drinker and like to spend money on early 2000's ""fine dining"" experiences.  If you have been to Cheesecake Factory before, food is the same, boring or comfort food depending on how you look at it.  As for me, Its all comfort food and I love the early 2000's hahahahahahah . But my shrimp was seriously undercooked and I ate 2 pieces before I realized it. Brought it to Tony's attention, and the manager came and offered to give me new shrimp, I said it's ok I just wanted to bring it to someone's attention, but she insisted and then offered to make a whole new plate for me to bring home.  In a nutshell:  Wait time: BAD Service: great Food: decent (safe? Ehhh ) Price: okaaaaaay."

Anthony Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,83,832,2.0,5/20/2016,"Food is the same like every location but this is what I didn't like  1- silverware is too dirty , looks like they have the dishwasher on the wrong setting  2- one the waiters is way too tatted up (tattoos) corporate should make him wear a long sleeve , his fingers have tattoos , I'm old school and if I'm paying $20 for a plate, $11 for a salad and $14 for drink I expect cleaner look"
princess d.,"Buena Park, CA",40,2,,1.0,10/13/2017,We have been waiting here for 3 hrs and all we Get is a run around  oh how long is the wait!!! Why cant they have a maximum allowable time of 2hrs!!  Cheesecake Factory you totally suck!! Get better management.
Asia Bee B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",157,76,3,4.0,8/23/2017,"We love dining here before seeing a movie. Very fast service, normally a short wait if any, and good quality food."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,11/12/2016,"Enormous menu, way too many options, you get bored with the menu, way too much reading and way too overwhelming. Service was rushed, they are way too busy to offer great service. Prices are a bit high for the quality that you get, don't expect great meats, best to stick to the basic dishes. You can tell the food is mass produced and while it is a bit better than some of your run of the mill chain restaurants, it's not a place I would chose to return to."
Shelley A.,"Long Beach, CA",8,8,4,3.0,7/9/2017,I loooove Cheesecake Factory but this location is  unorganized and small.  The only way to eat here and have a good experience is to come during an off time (during the weekday before or after the meal time rush). I made a reservation for 8 people for my friends birthday and we still waited for almost 2 hours. By the time we finally paid our bill and left we had spent almost 5 hours there. Plus...I don't even think anyone even ordered dessert! I have been to this location a few other times and enjoyed the experience BUT it was before the dinner rush during the weekday. The quality of the food is the same at the other locations but honestly...it might be worth it to drive a few more miles to another nearby location IF you're going during a busy meal time.
G G.,"Long Beach, CA",33,582,4380,4.0,5/19/2016,"The dutch apple cheesecake and bbq chicken ranch salad are definitely on my list of go to items. I think most everything I ever ordered was great. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is another fav. This location, formerly where South Street Deli and other shops used to stand, is PACKED!!! It is beautiful inside but too crowded for my taste. The staff was helpful and take out was a painless transaction.  My tip: Get it TOGO."
Karen J.,"Indio, CA",0,35,,1.0,11/13/2017,this location just sucks food always is cold takes 20 minutes to get a drink empty tables but they say they dont have any help i will never go back they need a better mgt team there
Ivy J.,"Irvine, CA",106,12,20,1.0,6/14/2017,"No stars for this location the service was bad and they are really slow I understand that it was busy due to graduation but it took them over an hour and a half to get our food. So three of my cousins didn't get too eat because they were taking too long and it was getting later and later. We received out food after 10:30 and they were closing. I ask to speak with a manager and he came out but didn't say sorry for the delay and didn't offer a discount on our bill. I ask him who is his district manager and he said he doesn't know anything about it. So who do you have meetings with, who do you report too ? With that being said I will call corporate office today and complain."
Jennifer C.,"Long Beach, CA",106,247,87,4.0,11/22/2016,"It's been so long since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory so from what I remembered I wasn't expecting much. I was even less interested when we sat down and I looked at their gigantic menu, I thought for sure it was going to be a disappointment, but to my surprise it was actually fantastic!  I ordered the shrimp platter which I thought was a safe basic easy choice and it did not disappoint. Both of my kids loved their dinners, spaghetti and meatballs, and chicken breast with veggies & mashed potatoes. Their tropical ice tea was yummy and they kept the refills going.  We took a piece of cheesecake home which my daughter scarfed down before anyone else could taste it.  We've since been there another 2 times and again the food was yummy. The service however is hit and miss. Just so you know."
Marci E.,"Cypress, CA",108,7,1,1.0,5/4/2017,"if i could give 0 stars i would. tried calling and making a reservation for a large party on a thursday 2 weeks in advance. they said the only  time available for a reservation is between 11am and 12 noon.  whats the point? during lunch hours. a year ago, my daughter had went to put her name on the list for dinner on a friday at 7pm, they told her it would be a 4-5 hour wait ... so your telling me we can wait till midnight and then we can me seated for dinner, when the facility closes at 11pm??? are you out of your mind. !!! do not go there and eat ... i mean you can if you want to chance ever eating dinner at a decent hour. Dear guest services , thank you for your response . However, I was never asked what time I would like to arrive . In my opinion , when trying to make reservations for a large party ..I understand it is hard to accommodate parties of 10 or more at that time, but that would only make those large parties wait longer opposed to smaller parties .  Why even take reservations from 11am to 12 noon... that is when you first open. I really don't think that is a good time to only have reservations . The restaurant just opened , now unless you plan on having people lined up out the door at 11 am, it's kind of pointless. Just like it's kind of pointless to offer a 4-5 hour wait at 7pm when the business closes at 11pm... do you see my frustration. 2 years in a row all my daughter has asked was to go to Cheesecake Factory and each time we have been disappointed."
Angela R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/26/2017,As always love this place.... I had the egg roll sampler... WOW best thing I've had in long time but when I go there I ways get the jambalaya pasta
R. A.,"Downey, CA",5,59,10,1.0,6/8/2017,"STAY AWAY!!!  Completely understaffed!  You wait and wait and wait before you ever even get a seat, then you wait for menu's, and then the real wait begins after you order!   STAFF IS RUDE AND NEEDS RE-TRAINING!"
Venice D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,9,42,1.0,6/21/2017,"Worst CF ever. Came here after my daughter's Nursing Pinning Ceremony. Big regret! They were so slow. Our food took a long time to come. Our server was slow getting to go boxes and our check. The food was just okay. Almost ruined our night, but we didn't let it be."
Suh S.,"Carson, CA",361,22,2,1.0,6/4/2017,"Worst service I've ever had consistently hands down. I ordered an order through postmastes at 7 pm. Receive my order at 8:26 pm without my garlic noodles. I call and ask for a manager. Peter answers. Has no clue about if they even have garlic noodles on the menu. He's going back and forth with some other person there throwing out named after I told him my postmates delivery persons name. He can't find it. He's asking some other server and they're blurting out every persons name that's ordered within the last hour (very professional). Finally he told me he's looking at all the open orders and don't see my name. Buddy, I told you my orders delivered already... After all that he says they don't have garlic noodles. I've ordered garlic noodles from here for the last 2 years. Never coming back here again."
Susan R.,"Bellflower, CA",37,71,28,5.0,6/20/2016,"Had lunch here today at 11am. No wait and our server was friendly. She was attentive but not overly rushing or crowding us at all. I've been in here before where they are at your table so many times you feel rushed. However, I can understand when there is a huge wait outside. I had the cobb salad and it was yummy. Someone else in our party ordered the Chicken Caesar salad. Salad was good but the chicken was a bit dry, overgrilled maybe? Air conditioning felt lovely on a 113 degree day in Cerritos, CA. Server was awesome, food tasted good. I highly recommend the Cerritos Cheesecake Factory."
Tiffany Noelle M.,"Cypress, CA",183,63,56,3.0,7/26/2017,"So I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories and this one is alright. They don't make their food as good as the other places and sometimes you can get a waitress that doesn't take care of you because you look ""young"" or look like ""a bad tipper"" but what can you do? This place can get awfully packed but at least they give you buzzers and can stroll around the mall while you wait."
Patricia Qui-Que G.,"Long Beach, CA",24,1,2,5.0,4/1/2017,This was my second time being at the cheesecake factory in 25 years. I went to the one at Cerritos mall. I had the gumbo. Lawd!!!!!! It was delighted.
Kyle Q.,"Cerritos, CA",12,1,,1.0,8/11/2017,"Poorly managed, dirty, also patrons of this cheesecake are rude and obnoxious. Would much rather spend the extra time traveling to Huntington Beach or redondo."
