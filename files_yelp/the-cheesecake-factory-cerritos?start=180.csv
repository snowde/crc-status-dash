Peggy A.,"Lakewood, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/22/2017,Had lunch here and was totally pleased. Parking was easy. We were seated immediately. Service was friendly and efficient. Food was delicious and was served promptly. We will definitely be back!
Adi T.,"Bell Gardens, CA",129,24,53,5.0,1/22/2017,The food is definitely 5 Stars!! It is always busy but the customer service is always great. Been here a couple of times and never disappointed me. (:
D J.,"Orange County, CA",0,76,2,1.0,8/10/2017,"This review is just for our last visit . . . All prior visits at this location, at least a dozen, rate a 4+! So where to start . . . Great service from the bar, able to serve me from a crowded bar even though no seats available! Bartender 4 stars!  Now this is where it goes sideways. Able to get a bar table, but it was not cleaned yet. I was able to get the attention of a busperson, but that took a few minutes. The rest of my party then joined me, but still waiting for the table to be fully cleaned. We were expecting more to join us, so when the 2 tables next to us left, we took those tables also. I asked a server for some menus and take some drink orders, but replied ""I am really, really busy and be with you soon."" Yes, it was busy, but we had been sitting there for 10 or so minutes and we were never acknowledged. (I believe Cheesecake Factory has 4 table stations and we sat at 3 of them).  We then watched you go to a manager and speak with him at length and this is where it gets strange. The manager approaches and asked about the size of our party and wanted to know if we wanted a dining room table. We told him that we had our name in (13 in our party) and we were here to celebrate a retirement and we're quoted 4 Hours!! Really, 4 Hours!! At 7 pm on a Sunday. Then, the hilarity begins. He accused us of eating off the plates that were on the table and drinking from the remaining drinks!!  WAIT - WHAT,,, Eating and Drinking from an unbussed table? That's when a member of our party told him we were very insulted that he would even suggest such behavior! I told him I purchased a bottle of wine at the bar as well as other drinks and these were not ""other people's"" drinks. He then suggested we take our drinks outside and wait for our table there.  WAIT- WHAT,,, Take our drinks outside? Did you really suggest that? Do YOU know the terms of your Liquor License? I don't think that is a viable solution? Plus, we were in the bar area which was a comfortable place to drink and wait. At that point, the manager back peddled and decided to get us a pager and a one hour quote! During this back and forth exchange, which lasted 10 more minutes, the 3 tables finally got cleaned and menus brought over. We also asked for a different server and decided to dine in the bar area.  Our new server stepped up and DELIVERED the Service I've come to know and get from CF. Drink, food and requests were taken promptly. Everything arrived smoothly. She checked back at all the right moments, with the manager making ONE half hearted follow up. Entrees and desserts all delicious!  I really don't want to give a 1 star rating for this visit, especially since I do dine at this and other CF locations, but what was to be a Great Evening, was spoiled by a BIG SERVICE misstep and insult."
Josie G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,2,1.0,10/3/2017,"THIS PLACE SUCKS !  We got here at 7pm on a Thursday night waited 2 hrs to get seated.

Tarjani C.,"Artesia, CA",0,4,13,5.0,12/19/2016,I have been here multiple time and Always like to come and have food with any mood with anyone. avocado egg rolls had first time here today
Yolanda G.,"Compton, CA",7,8,,3.0,7/21/2017,"Had lunch with my husband before the movie, had the fish and chips dinner. The pieces of fish where so small we thought they were nuggets the waitress contacted the manger he tried to explain to me who comes all the time that, that was the right amount of fish for the dinner. Maybe the lunch portion but not the dinner portion. It's time to stop paying all this money and this restaurants that are all about the money not the customer. Thanks but no thanks Cheesecake Factory Cerritos. All go back to redondo beach."
Devin L.,"Downey, CA",42,6,6,1.0,11/12/2016,"Horribly managed. Staff is so slow, taking to many steps to complete task. We got seated requested water and waited forever! Got the bread with out butter, which then came from a different server. Brought us the wrong cake and left me with half of my order I originally request in the to go box."
Maryam M.,"Bellflower, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2017,"I will never eat here again! My family is visiting from Montana and we decided to bring them to what used to be one of our favorite restaurants. The place was not busy and we were seated quickly, but the customer service was terrible. We waited for a waiter to show up and no one came. When we asked a nearby waitress if she would help us, she responded with such an attitude and acted as if she could not and did not want to help us. The manager was trying to find someone to help us, and still no one came. All of the waitresses responded with attitude and did not want to help us. I felt so discriminated against and uncomfortable. I will never eat here again."
Mahya J.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,328,328,4.0,5/28/2016,"This place is great!  The wait was 45 minutes , but our server was great.  I don't know his name but he was wearing an awesome wolf tie.  I got the beer battered French fries and southern fired catfish.  I enjoyed both my dishes, but the catfish itself could've a bit more seasoning. However, it's not a big issue.  My mom enjoyed her house salad, but she didn't enjoy her pasta from her shrimp scampi. She liked the shrimp though.  I got a tiramisu cheesecake to go and it was amazing."
Fanny R.,"Bell Gardens, CA",12,11,4,1.0,9/19/2017,"I am so disappoint with the service I received here I didn't expect to have a bad experience because it's THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! We waited about 30mins to get a table and then our server seemed as if she didn't want to work, she had an attitude and made us feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable. Sorry but servers should actually make customers feel welcomed and appreciated, because without customers you don't have a job. It took like another 20-25mins for our food to get to the table and that was a loonnnggg wait. Once we recieved our food the sauce from the chicken madiera tasted burnt as if they overcooked or burn the butter and didn't bother to make a new sauce...and the Chicken also had a foul taste, its frustrating because my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary, so you know we came to have a great night but the bad service killed the night. And let me tell you it isn't cheap, I literally wasted my money for nothing. The service has always been on point in my usual location inside The Grove but this location did not work for us, its ALL BAD! Very disappointing :("
David W.,"San Clemente, CA",1,6,,1.0,8/14/2017,"I really wanted to enjoy Cheesecake Factory and its a beautiful restaurant but with the glitz came none of the glamour. Calamari secerly overcooked, Steak brown and i wanted medium rare. i requested a booth and ended up in a tabke squished next to rude teenagers. sorry Cheesecake for $120 + tip ticket. not worth it. stay away!"
Darlene L.,"Carson, CA",47,5,2,1.0,2/17/2017,"We had the worse service ever. We came here for a nice girl out dinner and we waited for 2 hours to find out our order was never submitted! They still come to find out what we order to make sure the charge us everything!! Are you kidding me! Shouldn't you're waiter know. This is the second time this happens and I would never come back here again. No apology, no remorse just came and threw the bill for the drinks we order at our table!! Horrible stay away!!"
Sal R.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,30,42,1.0,7/14/2017,"Was looking for some good food and a friendly atmosphere but didn't get it here. Was greeted by a hostess  at 11:33 on 7/14/17 who was uninthuzed and acted like she did not want to wait on us. Ten minutes to be seated in a place with many open tables. Outside patio had open seating but didn't want to sit outside. The rude, have a nice day wasn't called for niether. I've eaten at fast food places and gotten friendlier service and happier people. My wife picked up on her rude attitude and wanted to leave immediately. Ashame as we were looking forward to eating at this location for the first time. Every other cheesecake factory we have been to the experience has been great but again not here!!!!!!"
Quanitaye T.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,14,2,1.0,4/29/2017,This place always seems to fail to deliver proper customer service.  Please check your cups before drinking. My cup was covered in oil as if they didn't wash it at all. This place needs a corporate take over.
Dante L.,"Bellflower, CA",16,3,,4.0,3/4/2017,"Had the nicest host at 9:40 pm. I also had the nicest waitress named Monique. Great dining experience over all.  We'll definitely come back again.  Next time, the Cheesecake is getting! Hard!"
Cindy A.,"South Gate, CA",61,42,205,3.0,3/4/2017,"Came here for a late lunch, the food could use more flavor, including the drinks... staff was very attentive... it does get packed here as expected the cheese cake was excellent.. I just don't understand why it's always so dim inside. Menu is expansive too much to choose from. This location at Los Cerritos Mall has you driving in circles for a parking space, not fun...."
L F.,"Victorville, CA",0,19,3,2.0,8/8/2017,"This is the location in the mall, I'm giving two stars because the service was great, however the food was awful. This restaurant has a huge menu so ordering can be confusing.... our food was not great, the kids alfredo was as pictured super watery . The veggi burger is not a burger and was just unflavored brown rice falling apart and really gross texture."
Nathalie R.,"Paramount, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/20/2016,"First timer last night. Went to have a birthday dinner with my bf. It was very busy. I believe we waited about half an hour to get seated, when we were told it would be about 30-40 minutes. Which was great because we were thinking it was gonna be longer, given how packed it was. Service was not bad at all. Our waiter was good. Came by a couple times to ask if we needed anything. That was a plus because it wasn't annoying at all. My bf got the Hibachi steak, medium rare. It was paired with mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. Very freakin delish. Everything from the marinade on the steak to the texture of it, to the tempura asparagus, was perf. The mashed potatoes were good as well. I got the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. Omg it was perfect! I was in heaven. You can really taste that garlic, but not to the point where it's too much. I usually do not finish all my food if its a big portion, but damn I couldn't stop. Topped it off with a couple of waiters singing happy birthday to me. Overall, our taste buds were not disappointed at all. Can't wait to go back!"
Joe L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",335,145,196,3.0,11/11/2015,"I was here last night and my rating is based on being somewhat considerate that it is a new location. Because of its opening a week or so ago, half of the staff don't know what they are doing so expect longer wait times. It is located on the back-side of the Cerritos mall (facing the 605 freeway) next to Forever21. Food... The food tastes just the way I remember Cheesecake Factory to taste.. mediocre as I ordered the same thing I typically get. One thing I did notice was that the Jumbalaya that we had, had different colored pasta (not a big deal still tasted the same) Tip: Wait a month or 2 before coming here"
John Kevin G.,"Long Beach, CA",106,45,59,4.0,11/8/2015,"This is a new installment to the Cerritos. Sorry to say that Claws is still unopened.  The architecture is very presentable and  wide. My only concern for the patio are is how are they going to avoid the rain because there's no sign of covers for the patio For our appetizer, my family ordered a zucchini, avocado fries and the complimentary bread and butter. Our appetizer came out great and delicious with the dipping sauces.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and substituted for sweet potato fries. Our server first was a bit slow yet I was being considerate being that it's still in its opening weeks. The fries came out a little salty and the sandwich tasted great. My brother ordered the catfish plate and man, it was soft and fresh.  For dessert, we ordered a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake. It was my first time trying their cheesecake and I did not expect it to be a huge slice. You can for sure taste the vanilla bean.  Shout out to our server for sticking through he night! I'll be coming back."
