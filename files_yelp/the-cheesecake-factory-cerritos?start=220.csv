Lorraine W.,"Lakewood, CA",68,3,,2.0,9/27/2017,The food is still good but get ready to wait 30-45 minutes before you get it. Then after the waiter brings your meal you'll sit around waiting for them to come back.  Not good service.  Been here several times and it's always the same story.  The only reason I bothered to stop by here is because I was already at the mall.  Never again!!!

Jozie L.,"Buena Park, CA",569,301,334,5.0,8/13/2016,"We've been trying to eat at this new location since they opened earlier this year. They're either too crowded or we haven't had time. But it was worth the wait. The service was exemplary. Jessica W. checked on us regularly without being obtrusive. She brought me ice water when I couldn't decide on a drink. She brought my sumptuous dish of clam chowder before the entree. I detest when soup is delivered with the meal. (They only prepare one soup per day. I really wanted tomato bisque, but Friday is clam chowder day and it was really good.) She delivered our take-home cheesecake bag just as we were completing the check transaction. We never had to wait for her or track her down. The restaurant was  getting pretty busy by the end of our meal, but Jessica kept her eye on us.  Just as I finished the chowder our entrees arrived. Hubs chose Shrimp Scampi. Delectable jumbo shrimp dusted with panko, then lightly fried flanked the plate of creamy sauce of butter, heavy cream and diced tomato. The prawns looked juicy and plump. On the far side of his plate, a nest of noodles crowned a handful of sautéed spinach leaves. This has become his favorite dish from TCF. I selected a lunch special of Grilled Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli tips. Very simple. Beautifully cooked. Asked for a bit of ranch dressing on the side to dress up the broccoli. Really enhanced the flavor of the steamed veggie. While we ate a waiter passed, headed for another table, with two plates of Southern Fried Chicken. Looked delicious. On the way out I talked with the ladies who ordered the ""highly recommended"" chicken.  They reported that they specifically come to TCF just for the chicken. I'll try that next time. Hubs never met a slice of cheesecake he didn't like. This time he took home a slice of Strawberry Cheesecake, which he inhaled almost as soon as we got home. A delightful meal. So many choices on the menu that we're looking forward to trying."
Jess W.,"Long Beach, CA",123,85,1,5.0,10/8/2016,"This place has a great staff, excellent service!  We were very satisfied with everything. The miso salmon is my favorite dish here.  I always come for the cheesecake.  I personally like the Lemon Meringue.  They torch the Marshmallow fluff so it has a nice charred marshmallow flavor.  I Also like the Godiva and Smores cheesecake as well.  This is a great place to come for a nice cocktail and appetizer before seeing a movie next door!"
jennifer y.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,28,45,5.0,10/23/2016,First time at this location! Got here late on a Sunday night an hour before closing to grab a light bite. I actually prefer here to the one at the grove. Its very clean since its a newer establishment and service was on point!! Shout out to Bernice for making our last Minute dinner experience fantastic.  The appetizer was complimentary thanks to the fantastic manager because there was a mixup but i didnt mind it to began with since bernice was so awesome!!  Will be back :)
Adriana S.,"Compton, CA",13,132,335,2.0,5/1/2016,"The wait at this location is extremely long,  I will definitely go to a different location next time. The food was ok, the waiter was very nice and polite. However,  for the wait the food was not worth it."
Maria M.,"South Gate, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/16/2017,We had no problems whatsoever  we will definitely be coming back ! Ps food & service was on point plus what i like about this place you can go and catch a movie after
Nicole F.,"Maywood, CA",15,51,1,5.0,6/23/2017,"This is aa fantastic restaurant to dine in. Our waiter Felipe, he made our night. He was so funny, courteous, and he provided us with exceptional customer service. We will definately come back to dine here. Not only because of the delicious food, but also because of our amazing service."
Myrrh H.,"Long Beach, CA",46,3,,1.0,2/16/2017,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! I recently ordered a Large Strawberry Cheesecake to pick up for an office birthday.  The original plan was to pick up at 12 noon and have it around 2:00 pm which would give it plenty of time to thaw.  However, the plans changed on the day of pick up.  I phoned around 10 am to tell them to take out earlier as I would pick up by 12:30 pm and we would be having the cheesecake at 1:00 pm.  I was assured they would do this and it would be no problem. So I get there at 12:25 pm to pick up the cheesecake.  The girl finds my ticket and I pay her with a credit card.  After that the girl at the counter looked lost trying to find my order.  She walked around looking confused for a bit and checked a few boxes but never really said anything to me.  She then opened a few fridge doors and again looked lost.  I asked her what was going on and where was my cheesecake?  She never really answered me, but left the counter again.  She spoke with a few employees but again still looked lost.  10 minutes has passed.  I finally had to yell loudly to get her attention and asked her what the problem was?  She told me she couldn't find our cheesecake and she was still looking.  I told her I had called to change the time for them to pull it out and would that change the location she was looking?  Once again, she looked lost and confused.  After 5 more minutes I told her to get a manager.  We had a party driving in for the birthday celebration at 1:00 pm and they could only stay for a short time.  So, I told her I had to get going as people were waiting for me to bring the cheesecake. It took awhile to get the manager.  He comes by and tells me don't worry we will take care of this?  But, again doesn't really explain what that means?  Once again I ask him, do you have my cheesecake or not?  Finally after 20 some minutes they say we have it.  However, they had not ""finished"" it.  They still had to put the strawberries on top, and the whipped cream border.  Really?  So the girl finishing the cheesecake could not have been slower.  It's now 1:00 and I still have no cheesecake and I'm about to blow.  My phone was blowing up with text messages asking where I was.... At 1:05 pm I finally get a ""finished"" cheesecake in a box, in a bag.  I told the gal I was not paying for it as this was ridiculous how long I had to wait.  She tells me, yes, we will take care of it.  So, I asked her for a credit receipt.  So, once again she is lost.  I told her to go get the manager, get me a credit receipt and bring it back to me.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  And FINALLY she brings me a credit receipt. I get back to the office and everyone is waiting.  The party who came by at 1:00 were already gone.  We sing happy birthday and go to cut the cheesecake.  It was so soft we couldn't get a decent slice out of it.  What a mess.  We will NEVER order another pickup order from here again."
Steff M.,"Cerritos, CA",5,127,123,5.0,9/1/2016,"The food is good, the drinks are amazing and I really like the decor of this location is very warm and modern and the space is plentiful. Every server I've encountered was very attentive,  and helpful. Even when busy they all provided good service time in between interaction was only cling because it's budy, not because they are ignoring customer's. I also appreciate the diversity of the staff, very reflective of today. I have no issues with tattos, because I judge waiters /waitresses by the caliber in which they do their jobs not tattos.  Alot of the negative reviews are slightly bogus. Cerritos is a food desert when it comes to nice, comfortable options, compound the fact that it's at a mall no one should be surprised that it's always busy. Give poor review because the silverware were dirty, or food nasty, or the server was actually rude. Not on they bate to busy, if you live in Cerritos you would know the lack of acceptable sit down food establishments has to do with it. If you want quicker service go to a Fast food joint."
Mar G.,"Carson, CA",3,4,,4.0,10/2/2016,"Food- so much flavor! We ordered avocado toast, lettuce chicken wraps and shrimp pasta. The disappointment came with the dessert. My fault for ordering a brownie sundae. Horrible. Order a cheesecake.  Service - waiter left on his break without letting us know and came back 30 minutes later like if nothing happened. We had great service in between, but it would have been common courtesy to let us know he was going on break."
Eva Z.,"Spring Valley, CA",187,10,2,5.0,8/13/2016,"Just left the cheesecake and on my way home to San Diego. It was my boyfriend and I dining. The time we waited on today's busy Saturday night was only about 15min, which I was really surprised about. There was a crapload of people so I didn't expect to get seated so quickly. Curtis did a perfect job. Got refills, greeted us and asked for our drinks in less than 2 minutes of getting seated, didn't even need to jot down our order, nailed it and was quick. I let him know I would prefer a different drink because mine was too sweet, no problem at all then got me what I preferred instead. The manager stopped by the table and he was very courteous and professional.  If I'm ever in the area, I would be more than happy to come in to this location and have a nice dinner.  Make sure to ask for Curtis, he knows what he is doing and is quick and courteous."
Stephanie I.,"Whittier, CA",95,10,6,2.0,5/30/2017,Haven't eaten here but after reading so many bad reviews you should really step it up and do some proper training. Thank you to all the yelpers that left an honest review. I hate to waste money and time on an unpleasant experience
Natalie M.,"Cerritos, CA",210,38,157,4.0,11/4/2016,"Wait is always long, but walking around the mall while you wait is an option. Food never disappoints and if it does, they'll remake it for you without any hassle. The service can be slow at times, but they're always really busy so that's to be expected."
Monica S.,"Lakewood, CA",0,15,2,1.0,5/27/2017,"1 Checked in for dinner on a Thursday at 630pm, we had a party of 8.  We were told it would be a four hour wait, Really...They should have just told us they could not accommodate."
Gema J.,"Las Vegas, NV",124,3,5,1.0,4/7/2017,Had such a bad experience with our waiter yesterday 4/6/17 our waiter Amanda F. Snatched my boyfriends drink and was raising her voice at us because we wanted to return his cold fries. We talked to a manager and her name is Marisella or marisol I forgot but all she said was that she'll let the boss know about what she did. Idk if it's because me and my boyfriend look young but that is no way to treat anyone.
Jeff C.,"Long Beach, CA",1,36,61,5.0,2/12/2017,Salvador was great. Very attentive. Very pleasant. Food was very good. Cane for my sons 22nd bday. Appreciate the staff here.
Kristi H.,"Cerritos, CA",39,23,2,1.0,4/4/2017,"I'm trying so hard to like this location, but they just can't get it together. Once I found a hair in my food and today they served me a salty ribeye steak. Our server was beyond dumb, and it took forever to put food. So for dinner tonight I had French fries and spinach ."
Isabel M.,"Irvine, CA",42,1,,1.0,3/28/2017,"The service is horrible! I once went in a big party and they told us it would be an 1hr and half wait and we ended up waiting 3 hrs!! Then I went again and we waited forever for our food and we took cheesecakes to go and they forgot one of our slices, will never go to this location again"
Roland M.,"Downey, CA",60,36,281,1.0,1/25/2016,Its about an hour wait but it is expected if you come to the Cheesecake Factory.. Ive been to Redondo beach and Brea and this place is worst! They wont offer you bread unless you ask for it.. Also we asked for another bread to a waitress and never came back!  So our food finally came and they never ask us if we wanted to add some parmesan cheese on our food! I am giving this place a one star because of a poor service!    I would rather go to the one in Redondo next time. Ambience is awesome since its next to the beach and they have a great customer service..
