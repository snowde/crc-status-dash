Anthony E.,"Lakewood, CA",308,73,64,4.0,2/25/2017,"First time at the new one in Cerritos but glad they opened it because the next closest one in in Huntington Beach.  Same good quality food and deserts. Busy location for Cerritos, plan ahead and make a reservation!"
Lisbeth V.,"Belmont Shore, CA",39,3,,1.0,5/14/2017,Waited 20 mins for our drinks. It's been 48mins and still no food/ apps. Horrible service
Danny G.,"Chino, CA",3,21,3,1.0,5/14/2017,"It's unfortunate that the ratings were correct on this one. We love The Cheesecake Factory. We usually go to the one in Anaheim or the Grove and always have a great meal and service. Our first visit at this location will be our last. After waiting an hour to be seated we had to wait another 15 minutes to get water. The food was prepared wrong, and they forgot the salads. Very poor service."
Faith A.,"Lakewood, CA",145,9,5,1.0,5/13/2017,"ALWAYS terrible service, 40+ minutes for our food. Our waitress only came to our table twice in the span of an hour and a half. I get it's Mother's Day weekend but prepare your staff and prepare for the rush guysss."
Jae K.,"Carson, CA",12,11,,5.0,5/12/2017,"This review is for the pick up option!--that being said, yooooo the steak was delicious. Compliments to the chef, he/she got my steak to my liking. My wife and I was complimented with a gift card from her brother and the phone order was a breeze. We got there at exactly 20minute like they intended and it was good to go. Finding a parking spot at the mall was easy because they had their own little pick up spot where you can park for 10 minutes to pick up the order. I had the rib eye steak and my wife had another dish, i'm not going to review her food because she has own yelp for that, but i can tell you, they were both good. I will have to dine in next time to see what the low rating is about. As for pick up, it was great."
Irma Patricia B.,"Long Beach, CA",131,260,149,4.0,1/30/2016,"I was debating on wether or not I should write a review or not but I decided to share my experience to help others. I try and be fair and accurate in describing my experience and the stars I feel are appropriate.  I was excited to see Cheesecake Factory opening a few months back, I think it was November? However, I read reviews and was a little confused and thought maybe I better avoid, service and long wait time were the common complaint so I decided to hold off because I knew since it was a new restaurant, they must be super busy. So, I recently had a birthday,  although I celebrated with family recently, my son wanted to take me out to dinner and we chose Cheesecake Factory. His only day off is Saturday so we arrived peak hour, 6 pm dinner and as expected, it was jam packed. The line to check in was super long and I can tell people were irritated but I also saw happy people. Our estimated wait time was over an hour no biggie, we walked around the mall a little and people watched outside. There is plenty of tables outside to wait and I noticed the outdoor patio was really nice and I think I saw heaters(it was chilly). We finally got seated just at the right time the hostess said we would. The place is beautiful, elegant and overall vibe was good, we had a nice table too! Our server checked in on us within minutes and was extremely cordial considering having to deal with a large crowd. I believe our drinks and delicious breadsticks were ready within 8 minutes. I had the luau salad, there is no way to describe how amazing and gorgeous this salad was..all I can say is you have to try it if you are into eating healthy. It comes with macadamia nuts, pineapple, chicken and lots of greens, delicious! My son had steak and shrimp which was equally amazing.. Food arrived promptly and was prepared just right, I have no complaints. Will I come back? Yes and I do recommend, there is a wait so if you are impatient, this isn't your kind of place. I gave 4 stars which I believe are appropriate..thanks!"
Natalie C.,"Norwalk, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/4/2017,"Wish i could give 0 stars... This place is ridiculously unorganized.  Came on a Saturday night and expected a long wait obviously. 1hr 45min wait....No thanks. My group decided to order to go and they said around 35 mins. We hung out inside the mall while we waited for our food. Gave them 40 mins and we parked in curbside. Called the number, asked if we had to go inside to pick up our food or wait outside and she said yes to come inside. Waited 15 mins inside in their unorganized line. Made it to the front, girl said our food is ready but the curbside attendant had our check and we had to go back to our car so she can deliever the food.. WTF?? Why did they say to come inside then.. she said our server will be right out, so we walked back out to my car, waited 10 mins, called the curbside # again, apparently a manager answered and we told her what was going on. She said she would have someone go out immediately with our food... another 10mins goes by and finally see a server come out with a small bag that no way could hold the food we ordered.. she told us our food was sitting in the front for us and we should've picked it up when we were inside.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? She made it seem like it was our fault for not grabbing our food even though the to go cashier said spefically to go back out to our car and someone would come with our food and check... she explained she had our cheesecakes but since the food was up at the front for so long it might be cold. She asked if we wanted to take it or wait another 15 mins and they could remake it. UHM NO! It was over an hour since I ordered my to go food and I didn't want to waste anymore time. I told her just to charge me for the cheesecake and forget the food bc why would I want to pay for cold nachos and Mac and cheese. She went back in to charge me for the cheesecakes and came out with my food. She apologized and said they had a communication problem with the cashier up front. She gave me our original food order that was sitting up front for us and said it was no charge. They still charged us for the cheesecakes though. Total time 1hr and 25mins!  And yes our food was cold...  Tried to eat it and it was soggy and unappetizing. I understand it's busy but this place is a mess. I work in food services and the way this process went is unacceptable. The food was not worth it.  Never coming back."
Cynthia M.,"Downey, CA",0,15,,1.0,6/20/2017,This place takes way tooooo long ! We were a party of 6 and it took almost 25 minutes to even get our drinks. Almost an hour into waiting and finally the food got here .  All of the food was great up until my sister found a piece of hair in her son's food. The manager didn't even comp us or apologize . Will definitely go to blank angus next time or OlIvE garden
Ivan R.,"Oakley, CA",0,5,1,1.0,3/27/2017,"This place is trash. Put in a phone order and as I got there the manager was yelling at one of the employees to call me to tell me my order was ready and that half an hour had already passed by. The food was cold, and tasted like wet blankets, and the people working there literally stared at me with smiles for 5 minutes like f*cking weirdos and then finally decided to ask me if I needed any assistance. Super garbage, I hope this place burns down."
Courtney M.,"Norwalk, CA",130,75,3,1.0,8/18/2016,"O m g does this Cerritos location SUCK. Worst customer service associates ever! I mean, who hires these losers? We waited 2 hours to be seated. As a matter of fact, We seated ourselves! The table we were waiting for was clean for like 30 minutes and no one came to get us or buzz our remote!  And why does Yelp make me give 1 star!?!?"
Amanda E.,"Irvine, CA",861,185,704,3.0,1/15/2016,"Awe I really wanted to give this location a chance, hoping my experience would be decent but after being to several Cheesecake restaurants this one was not my favorite. Yes, it's a new location, but customer service was not up to par. We came on a Thursday evening, and there wasn't a large crowd. Wait time - 1 hour?! Really! After getting our table, and looking through the massive book of a menu, I finally ordered just a simple chicken pasta.  Now waiting for food seemed like an eternity. We ended up scarfing down the complimentary bread from hunger. And our server was no where to be found. I even asked for refill on water and they didn't seem to acknowledge my request. I will say that the quantity of food was a plus; aside from the dessert which is downsized so the price isn't worth it. The ambiance of the restaurant is my favorite; I feel like I'm in a Tim Burton, Alice and Wonderland movie hehe."
Pedro G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",507,24,8,5.0,2/20/2017,"Delicious!  Finally Cheesecake in Cerritos love it!! I am a frequent Cheesecake factory customer, I have been coming here since it opened and for many more years to come!"
Luis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",331,1,,1.0,5/19/2017,This place is not worthy...waiting time is ridiculous.  I really dont care for this place at all. I rather go to another location but this place.
Jade M.,"Cypress, CA",162,36,30,1.0,3/12/2017,"Has 2.5 stars for a reason. I'm so hungry:( I wish my appetizer would come out, or at least fill me up with bread. Alas, nothing. I shall die h...my appetizer came out! Yay. Anyway, slow, but I guess they are busy for a Sunday night right before closing."
Paul C.,"Cerritos, CA",42,364,503,2.0,12/31/2015,"When I heard about Cheesecake Factory finally coming to Cerritos, I said it's about damn time. But what I got tonight was a not so stellar experience that makes me not want to eat here again. This place was definitely not built for a massive crowd especially tonight with too many people out to eat. My family and I thought we would come here early and get dinner for my mom's bday and be on our way. We ended up staying here for nearly 2 and a half hours from the long line just to get your name down all the way to getting our food out. I was a bit unhappy about where we got seated. We were a party of 4 and got seated out in the little patio area inside the mall. Sure it was nice and bright compared to the dim light setting inside but it was a little awkward for me to eat out in the open mall where all the shoppers were. Eddie was our server for the night. Things started off alright but after getting our drink orders down, it took over 10 minutes to get our drinks out as well as the bread. Almost thought he forgot about us since we weren't seated inside. I ordered the chicken madeira and steak diane combo but the description on the steak diane failed to mention that they added shiitake mushrooms which I absolutely despise. Also one of the asparagus that I got for the chicken madeira was not properly cooked as I had the most difficult time chewing on it and could not bite a piece of it off. Very disappointed with that. Here's what really didn't go well with me. The table settings. Who in their damn mind decided that it's ok to put silverware on a table without a napkin resting in between? Why does the napkin have to be on the little plate? My plate was a little dirty btw as I noticed some crumbs already on it. The table setting sucks and needs to be changed. Restrooms here are questionable too. Why do the doors need to weigh 1000 pounds? And no paper towels either. Ugh. Do they really think air dryers are the better choice? And the dim setting inside is another thing. I nearly slipped because their floors were covered in grease and oil from their food hitting the floor and making it hard to tell. Food and service were both mediocre and I wouldn't come back here especially since it took so much of my time. I would only return for their cheesecakes only to go. In conclusion time it took from start to finish Line for getting your name down - 10 minutes Waiting for a table for a party of 4 - 1 hour 5 minutes Getting water/bread - 10+ minutes Getting entrees - 50 minutes Getting check - 7 minutes"
Daisy D.,"Bellflower, CA",265,13,10,4.0,5/11/2017,"I went around 4:30 today and got seated quickly (there was 5 of us) the food was great . The waiter miguel was nice and very quick too , always checking up making sure we weren't running low on drinks or anything . Everything about today was perfect I'm giving a negative one star just because of a previous time I went and they wouldn't reserve for 11 people . I'm guessing they have a policy that they only reserve on slow times or slow days ? But wtf is the point of that ? Lol. They need to really figure out their reservation policy cus when I went there were two people taking up tables that would fit 7 plus people .  Anyway. ... I didn't feel like it was too expensive either so yay"
K C.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",5,19,,1.0,3/28/2017,"Do not opt for curbside pick up at this location as the marked stalls for Cheesecake are used by other patrons, causing you to drive round and round for twenty to thirty minutes for a parking spot. It is quicker to illegally park on the curb and get your food and dodge security than it is to wait for a marked stall used by non-patrons of this disorganized mall and location."
Melissa C.,"Long Beach, CA",112,168,99,1.0,3/16/2017,"So I went to eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Cerritos. I was brought to a table and left sitting there for a while. I was eating by myself so maybe that's why they forgot about me. A manager walked over and asked if I had been helped yet, I said no and he apologized and he asked if I wanted anything to drink. I said yes and told him I was hungry and ready to order so he took my order. I also told him the utensils were dirty and once had lettuce stuck to it, he apologized and had someone bring me new utensils. A little later the server came and asked me what I wanted to order, I told her that I had already ordered with the manager and she asked why and I told her why. They finally  brought out my drink and the best whole wheat bread ever. I told the server I would be right back and when I came back my drink and bread were gone :/ so they apologized and we started all over. After my meal, I was ready to leave and had to wait till finally they remembered me and I was given a box. The server asked if I was ready to leave and I told her I was but she insisted that I get dessert, i said no, and kept asking and I said no over and over. But finally after her questioning me about what I would want I asked to see the menu and she said they had all kinds of things and asked if maybe I wanted an ice cream. She said she could make me a little one with chocolate so I said sure. The bill came, that ice cream was $5! Ridiculous! It was small and not worth more than a buck. It almost felt like  she was forced to make me get dessert to increase her tip or something. She said it would be small but clearly they priced it like a large."
Lynnette A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/9/2017,Hey Cheesecake Factory when making coffee to go for customers you may want to keep the coffee grounds out of it! I swallowed enough coffee grounds that it got stuck in my throat and had to drink something else to get them to go down. Worse cup of coffee ever!!! Called in an order for pick up and the person who answered wasn't very nice either. Very bad experience all together!
Anthony L.,"Long Beach, CA",15,17,,1.0,2/15/2017,"I have been at this particular restaurant before for dinners but this review is ONLY based on something I recently found out.. I went there on Valentines Day to buy a cheesecake for the family. I purchase the cheesecake at cashier and she tells me that the cheesecake is frozen and I'll have to keep it out of fridge for couple hours to defrost, now I wanna know why am I paying $33 for a 7inch cheesecake, excuse me a FROZEN 7 inch cheesecake?!! I could've and should've just went to Costco and gotten an unfrozen cheesecake that is almost half the price and probably 3 times its size... I will probably never go back to any cheesecake factory now and I read desert menu nothing states that their cheesecakes are frozen and for how long they are frozen for"
