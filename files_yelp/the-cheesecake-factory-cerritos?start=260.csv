Manny T.,"Long Beach, CA",2,58,75,1.0,1/1/2016,"This is los Cerritos location , waiting for table..wtf. the seating looks uhg  Feels uhg. Not comming back. the service is bad. Super slow. the staff looks like they gave up. Just like other yelpers say. But we wanted to see what the hype was about. The wait was not fun. No entertainment to keep your mind off waiting. The food is bad. 30 bucks for filet minion with poor presentation. Just a little dish and theres the meat. They burned dry our ribeye. Even if a custumer requests well, that dosent mean to the point of dry. Why would a cook serve something in that condition?  And a side of worse than waxier than mc donalds fries came late, they forgot. The grease filled onion rings dripped all over. Jambaleya pasta very boring. Food is very boring here. Booring. Really?? Waxie McDonald's fries in this resturaunt? ? And 2 translucent oil filled onion rings on top."
Crystal M.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",196,90,106,3.0,1/13/2016,"I received a Cheesecake Factory gift card over the holidays so I decided to visit this one on a Saturday at 3pm. Even at such an odd hour it was packed and our wait for a table for 2 was about 40 minutes. We were seated at the heated outside patio, which was actually really nice and warm (it was in the high 50s/low 60s that day). It was much brighter and quieter than sitting inside. Overall experience: service was terrific, food was meh. Our server was all smiles, checked in with us often, and was quick to cater to our requests. The food on the other hand was just ok. Both of the dishes we got were extremely salty. We ordered the margherita pizza and the Renee's special (chicken-almond salad sandwich with baked potato soup and salad). While the soup and salad were okay, a single bite into my sandwich was all I could handle. It was so salty that I needed to take a huge gulp of water. The same went for the margherita pizza, salty. We also ordered the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer, which was actually pretty good and the highlight of our meal.  While the avocado eggrolls and service was great, I don't think it's enough to keep me coming back on a regular basis unless they make their entrees less salty."
Jonathan G.,"Corona, CA",3,8,1,1.0,3/4/2017,Horrible service !!!!! 2 1/2 hrs wait and they said 45mins ......then they tell me us everytime we check after 45 mins that it's just 5 more mins !!!! Really people ! Then I go to speak to management and Marcella ( if that's even her real name ) says what ! ? Now my fault I never told you that another manager did so what am I suppose to do? .....unreal never have I seen or been treated like this with a party of nine gonna spend atleast 600 if not more in your establishment  ...someone in upper management needs to fix this ......would love to speak to someone about that on this matter still in shock
Kevin H.,"Long Beach, CA",76,260,193,4.0,3/29/2017,"I thought this place was good! I didn't have any problems.. Food was cooked well! The wait time was also good about 10 minutes. I had the fried shrimp platter and date had the rib eye steak medium.. The table where we sat at was small though, if you ordered 3-4 plates there is no way you will get everything on the table and be able to eat clean without bumping something over with drinks! We asked to be moved to a bigger table which wasn't a problem.. Place was clean and bathroom was clean so pretty good spot to enjoy! They also have a great outside patio area over looking the mall area and movie theater!"
Brett S.,"Lakewood, CA",68,118,42,1.0,12/31/2015,"I gave an additional star because the wait was much less than expected and what they quoted. First off, this place is a madhouse! There was a 10 minute wait in line just to put our names in. We were quoted 30, walked around and were seated within 20. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the service and it appears they are under-staffed for the demand. My appetizer came out after my main course and while I no longer wanted it just had them box it up. I got the herb crusted salmon with a Guinness and the salmon was pretty good but slightly charred and chewy. Server only came back once to check on us in the 40 minutes we were waiting and ended up grabbing our own menu for dessert to check it out. Pretty disappointed with this one. I'll give it a few months and give them another shot. Update: I changed my mind from my prior review and decided they are only worthy of 1 star. Our service was awful. Only had our server come up twice and even had to wait 5 more minutes for him to return after dropping off our check even though we had it ready when he came by the first time. Horrible experience!"
Missy L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/18/2017,Came in close to 4pm and wait time took about 10 minutes which was perfect. Our server however seemed very rushed and very unhappy. Before my boyfriend could order his drink he was interrupted by the server who said he needed to bring us bread and then brought him the wrong drink. When he came to refill drinks I had barely drank my water and he overfilled so it spilled on the floor. During all this he would also interrupt a conversation by just speaking immediately when he came to the table while seemingly annoyed. Overall the food was amazing just the experience with the server was not what we desired.
Laura C.,"Norwalk, CA",33,254,271,4.0,3/12/2016,"Came here on a Wednesday night with hubby. This place was busy. We sat on the bar area because we were hungry, we didn't want to wait, and there was a table available. Out waitress was super busy but was really nice. She seemed to have been waiting on many tables  Food was good a little on the expensive side but good portions. I would come again."
Rob W.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,19,30,2.0,9/18/2016,Well got seated in patio. Very nice. However been seared for 15 minutes. No server YOU SUCK. More details shortly other young lady NOT our server 23 minutes in. She was very nice. BUT
Xavier P.,"Compton, CA",42,3,1,1.0,1/6/2017,"I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory. My favorite slice is the Godiva cheesecake. However, I was walking around the Cerritos mall and I happened to see an employee in the restroom.  He was easy to identify because he was wearing a hat and polo from there. The guy was also wearing an apron so I can assume he was still working. He walked out of a stall still wearing gloves. He barely ran his hands under the faucet before walking out. No soap and no thought at drying his hands, much less the need to remove his gloves at any time. I hope he doesn't handle food in any way but he does work in a restaurant. Unfortunately, I tried to reach out to a manager but I was kept on hold until the system hung up on me. Sadly, I will not be eating here."
Samantha L.,"Long Beach, CA",121,85,117,3.0,12/15/2015,"Contrary to a lot of the not so good reviews, my first visit at this location was actually good! I came here on Monday early evening, so we just made it right before the dinner rush. We were greeted kindly by one of the many hostesses, and were seated almost immediately.  But it took probably a good 15 mins for our server to come to our table to greet us and ask for our drink orders. That's probably the only thing that kinda irked me. But it allowed us a lot of time to look over their encyclopedia of a menu to make our choice of entree. I can't remember how long it took for our bread and water to get to our table. He told us they were making a new batch of bread which I was stoked about because fresh bread.. Yummy!! I was disappointed that it wasn't like hot, hardly warm so I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh. Oh whale.  We waited for probably 20 mins for our food to finally arrive. I wasn't disappointed, the food was good like all the other locations I've been to. You definitely get a bang for your buck bc massive ass portions man.  Overall, I had a good experience! I was expecting to have a horrible experience bc it's still fairly new and I've read other reviews that the staff is not fully trained and what not. But I have no real complaints besides waiting longer than I'd want. The staff was nice and attentive. I can't remember our servers name but he was nice and checked up on us from time to time!"
Evelyn N.,"Alpharetta, GA",249,60,131,5.0,11/12/2015,"I've been to lots of cheesecake factory's so I was really excited when I found out that there was one opening up just down the street because Cerritos desperately needed some new restaurants!  I came here with my mom for my birthday. I can't remember our servers name but she was great! So so so adorable. I hope we get her next time we stop by.  The rest of the staff was friendly, very attentive, the wait time on a busy Thursday night was about 10 minutes- if that!"
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",670,118,795,3.0,1/9/2016,"I was so happy to hear that a Cheesecake Factory was opening up at the mall. That whole area down 183rd street has developed so much over the past few months and it's so wonderful to see the changes. Based on my recent experience at this location, the service was not good. Our server forgot about us many times. We did not got bread until our food came out and he never asked if we would like refills on our drinks. Also, we needed to remind him that we ordered a cheesecake for dessert.  Aside from service, the ambiance was fantastic. We sat outside in the heated patio and it was perfect. I love the fountain that is in the middle as well. I ended up loving it outside also for the fact that it's quieter than sitting inside."
Shirley L.,"Merit-Carson, CA",22,17,34,1.0,9/19/2016,"Another bad idea, not checking Yelp before heading here. The service SUCKS!!! Our server took our order 10 Minutes after we got seated. We gave our order right away, since it took her that long to help us. Then she came back with one drink and we ordered 4. Then 15 minutes later our appetizer came with the remaining of the drinks. Our entrees arrived, we requested for more bread at least to eat with the Pasta, we're told to ask the server.  Ah duh? Our server is missing!!! Hello??? When we started eating thinking oh perhaps they informed our server about the bread we requested....NOT!!!! Our server have 4, tables to assist. We're on the 4th table. She checked on table one, then two, and then the third one. I keep on giving her an eye contact perhaps she will come our way to at least check on us...none! Totally ignored! Finally, my niece got up and ask for the manager and complained about our server. Manager apologize and replaced our server immediately.  The 2nd server is more helpful and apologetic, I was like I wished we had her earlier! Made an excuse for her co-worker that they're supposed to only server up to four tables and her co-worker was working on 6. Yeah right! Girlfriend! I have eyes, I can see and actually watching her how many tables she's working on! The food was alright, I ordered a Garlic Pasta that I cannot even taste the garlic! I guess the best food that was served was the wheat bread!  That's all folks! CF in Old Town Pasadena doesn't disappoint me. I knew it, I should've just had the Pumpkin Cheesecake!"
Robert M.,"Norwalk, CA",1,47,32,3.0,5/31/2017,Not the best service but the food was okay. I wish they can serve better and come to your table more often to see how your doing
Irene P.,"South Gate, CA",26,2,,5.0,5/12/2017,Fabio (manager) is by far  very attentive and made us feel welcomed. He's the reason we will defenetly come back.....
Steven C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/21/2017,"So even after seeing the wonderful 2.5 stars on here, we still decided to try this as most of us had been wanting to eat here since it opened. After waiting over an hour for a table we finally got to order our food. Of all 7 of us, the meal I ordered was not even available however our waitress did not even inform me. The manager came over to tell me and did nothing to try and help after I told him I'm not going to order anything, thumbs up on the wonderful customer service. He also mentioned that she didn't know, however when she came back and I said something she told us that she did not want to tell me. Once the rest of their food came, most of them were hot however they all said it taste like it had been sitting there for a while which we would not even be surprised. At he end of the meal when we tried to order dessert, Of course what I wanted was not available. To top that off, all the cheesecakes we got to go were on there sides, thanks waitress, we love our Cheesecake all messed up. This place is a joke and most likely won't last unless they get their stuff together. Be warned before you go. Definitely our last time."
Kat R.,"Bellflower, CA",53,31,53,5.0,6/21/2016,"I loved this place. It was awesome.. Good was great , service was great. Perfect!! But seriously the Avocado toast is no joke it was amazing!!! I'm sad because I don't have some right now!! Lol it's the best!!!"
Irene R.,"Seal Beach, CA",1,26,,2.0,8/21/2017,"I have never been to this location but I thought how bad could it be... I expected this restaurant to be one with a bit of class but Instead it was more like a buffet type of feel. It's unorganized and people are everywhere. Yes I did go on a Sunday but my experience is incomprehensible.   I was told my wait time would be 25 min. But I think it was shorter. I got up from my seat to stand in another line just to be seated. A gentleman and his wife and child were in front of me. Somehow, 15-20 later I realized something was wrong ... people behind us were being seated way before us. I asked the young girl at the desk and she appeared to look into it. Another 7-10 min later ... I had to bring it up again but to another host. Somehow both the gentlemen and my name got lost and forgotten. I don't understand how no one asked us any questions on why we were standing there all that time. It took me to figure out that one out.  So we are seated. It took about 20min for someone to appear out of the whole chaos to ask if we wanted drinks.  The food was ok. But when I go to a restaurant I don't want to be felt like I'm in a cattle call. I don't want to be forgotten and have to speak up for my fellow patrons just to be noticed. There were plenty of hosts around who saw us and failed to ask us if we needed help. I probably won't be returning unless the other Yelp reviews start to take a turn because most reviews also speak of the poor customer service."
Stitch G.,"Long Beach, CA",2,29,1,1.0,1/13/2017,"We went for lunch today.  They failed at the caliber of service expected from The Cheesecake Factory.  First, our ""server"" Jesus wasn't good with follow through.  Drink refills sat unfilled.  We had to wave him down to get anything.  Didn't really check with us.   Then it turns out Carlos was our real server.  Jesus needs to go back to being a food runner.   Not a caliber server.  No personality.   Carlos handled the final end of our meal.   He was good. EXCEPT I got the wrong to go Cheesecake to go.  I forgot to look in the bag but I was truly disappointed when I had the wrong one.  Not even sure what type I have.  So that was wasted money.   No one thanked us for our visit.  Never saw a manager on duty.   We are diehard Cheesecake Factory lovers but don't care to go back to Cerritos.  I'd rather drive to Bella Terra than leave with a sour taste in my mouth from The Cerritos location.   Off to rant to all my friends on social media.  They always ask me about the best service of restaurants."
Cynthia A.,"Bellflower, CA",39,29,32,5.0,11/4/2015,I had the endive salad stuffed mushroom and cheese burger it was all DELICIOUS I love the location and I'm so happy they opned one in cerritos  Servers hostess and waiters were great although they didn't bring my bread and butter out on time it was all good love it here  Outdoor seating is the best Wow the waiter brought our bill he said the cheesecake was on them because the burger wasn't cooked the way we ordred it  Wow he was so nice we didn't even noticed our burger wasn't cooked the way we ordered it  THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT WAS VERY NICE ERIC  BTW HE WAS OUR waiter he was so nice polite and smiled a lot
