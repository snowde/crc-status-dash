Je Don D.,"Carson, CA",47,201,262,1.0,6/11/2016,"This place has changed dramatically. Portions are smaller, prices are to high for the quality of food. I orderd the chicken fetuccini pasta and the sauce was so liquidy it looked like soup. My mom took her food to go and said it was so much oil settling in the bottom of the container she threw it away. Ive lost my love for this place"
Tallara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,12,12,5.0,7/16/2016,"I love this Cheesecake Factory! It's one of the best, I don't understand all the bad reviews, I guess some people ALWAYS have something to complain about and have probably never worked a hard day of hospitality in their lives. I always have great servers and excellent service to follow.  The free sourdough bread is amazing and the leftovers from the insanely huge meal is even better the next day! Saddest part about coming here is that I never have enough room for the cheesecake at the end of my meal."
Izuku M.,"Westminster, CA",0,6,,5.0,9/7/2017,"Imagine you are at Disneyland imagine you are having the time of your life riding space mountain or the wildest ride in the wilderness. Imagine you can take pictures with Mickey Mouse and not the I don't know why kids never wonder why Mickey Mouse is so huge in person Mickey Mouse but the real animated true to size kicks butt as King Mickey slashing a keyblade in Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that Mickey Mouse. By this point you might be saying to yourself well Izuku Midoriya aside from the fact that King Mickey's favorite cake is most likely Cheesecake that doesn't sound like Cheesecake Factory at all and...well... you are right they are not alike at all, but it is still one of my fiancé's and I's favorite restaurants whenever we are at Cerritos mall. The wait for a table on a weekend can be really long, but a lot like space mountain it's worth the wait. Just wait until I tell you about their Louisiana chicken pasta. It is by far the best thing on the menu. Imagine your favorite shows Rick and Morty, Dragon Ball Super, My Hero Academia whatever, but like imagine those shows were food this is what those shows would taste like. If Goku was pasta this would be his final form. If Rick portal gunned himself into a new universe made of good pasta this would be that universe. So do yourself a favor drop whatever you're doing and go get this pasta and I don't care what you're doing. Slacking off at work reading Yelp reviews? Leave in the middle of your job and run out to your car. Cooking a meal to impress your future inlaws that you are going to meet for the first time? Leave the stove on and run to your car. Holding a baby? Drop the baby. Trust me it's good. Do it! Are you doing it yet?! ...anyway no rush whenever you get around to it. As far as the serves goes it's decent, but don't always trust the waiters if they say a dish is good there is still a 50% chance it could be terrible and the last time we were there we asked for more bread and they forgot so there is that, but seriously that Louisiana chicken pasta though."
Gabby D.,"Long Beach, CA",1,55,2,2.0,1/1/2017,"Okay, I have been here a couple times last year in the past and my experiences has been great! However, tonight wasn't so.  Our server was good in the beginning but a couple time we have to look for him or try to get his attention. As a guest, I understand you have a couple of people to attend to, but if I need you, I should not see you chatting it up with your employees.  What pissed me off was when I was leaving and walking towards my car, I saw a couple of guys smoking and they was not smoking cigarettes is all that as I can say, but as I went to go back towards the front of the restaurant, I see the same guys running back into the restaurant with their aprons on as if they cooks or the cleaning crew. This definitely was not a good representation."
Chong Y.,"Buena Park, CA",340,322,99,4.0,6/6/2016,"Food is good, wait time wasn't too bad, and the wait staff was very friendly. Can't really complain."
Matthew N.,"Santa Maria, CA",5,86,15,1.0,8/26/2017,"8/20/17 4:10pm  Facts: 40 minute wait Hostess didn't ask how many were in our party. We approached the podium with a total of 3 people  40 minutes later they seat us at 4:50pm  There are 10 in our party  We are directed back to the podium and wait for a manager  Manager comes over and doesn't ask us about the situation nor does he apologize. He states it will be 2 hours  I stated that we just waited 40 minutes He said it went from a party of 3 to 10  My response and thoughts:  I stated to the manager and the hostess who took our name, she didn't ask us about the size of our party. Is that our fault that she put us down as a party of 3?  He said no  I asked him for the corporate number and for his name...1 (818) 377-8000, Peter  Not once did I receive an apology. I immediately called the corporate number but there was no answer. I asked Peter if this was a real number and he said ""yes, but the office is closed on the weekend""  Luckily, the bar had seating open up that was large enough to accommodate us. Peter had his team set the table up and managed to seat our party in a reasonable amount of time.  My main problem with everything is how the situation was handled. I understand that the restaurants might have been busy, but the manager did not even stop and take a moment to investigate the issue. He did not bother to find out where the problem started such as the party size being inaccurately recorded by the hostess. Peter simply stated that it would take 2 hours. That would make our total wait time be over 2 hours and 40 minutes from the time we arrived at the hostess podium, 4:10pm. Please put yourselves in our shoes and take a moment to analyze the problem from the customer's point of view. It seemed clear that our situation was a nuisance and the restaurant did not want to deal with it. The easiest solution for the manager was to jump to the conclusion that the wait would be an additional 2 hours and if we didn't like that answer, then he seemed sure to allow us to leave without feeling any remorse Peter did end up finding us a table, but I personally feel that it was because I was immediately prepared to report this situation to the corporation. Peter did check on us after the server took our drink order. However, no apology which shows me a lack of compassion. I feel that he wanted to avoid a formal customer complaint. I hope he properly trains his hostess who served as our initial contact for this visit. In short, the Cheesecake Factory team acted like nothing happened.   On the bright side, our server was nice and our food was good.  We will not be coming back. We didn't order cheesecake. We had dinner for a birthday and brought our own cake."
William K.,"Los Angeles, CA",250,43,31,3.0,7/29/2016,"This cheesecake factory is a great place to come for celebrations or to just have dinner with someone special.  The ambiance is great and the service has always been good as well.   The food is objectively decent but it is so expensive!  I paid about $20 for a pasta with chicken (before tax and tip).  Food aside, the best part of this place is the cheesecake.  I highly recommend the red velvet and I kid you not I've had it twice in one week before.   This place would be higher stars in my book but I'm giving it three stars because of the high price for the decent food quality.  Parking is ample as it is located in the Cerritos Mall."
Gretchen B.,"Long Beach, CA",4,25,49,3.0,12/31/2015,"Visited yesterday around 5pm and I thought I would wait awhile to get seated. Surprisingly, I was wrong! There was plenty of seats in the ""atrium"" area which is the outdoor seating inside the mall.  +1 star for seating me within 5 minutes. Our table was clean and napkins were nicely placed on top of the plates. However, our seats had crumbs of food on it. Also, it's disgusting having our utensils placed directly on the table tops. The last customers could have sneezed or coughed on the tables. Plus, they don't disinfect the tables after each customer (I saw the waiters briefly wipe the tables down with dry clothes). Make sure to wipe down the seats and disinfect too! -2 stars Food came out promptly and it was perfectly seasoned. They grated fresh parmesan cheese on my pasta which elevated the flavor of the sauce. I would definitely come here again and maybe get dessert too!!  +2 stars People have to understand this is a new location. So, it's obviously going to be extremely busy and chaotic. Go during their down time and you'll have a better experience (hopefully)."
Jennifer M.,"Anaheim, CA",16,3,4,5.0,3/29/2017,My favorite  place for cocktails Amazing bartender Chris He has skills Very personable with a personality and super fast and on task at all times Great food Especially the shrimp scampi and Cajon chicken bites  and blood orange martini
Linda Y.,"Riverside, CA",20,8,,1.0,3/27/2017,"We went on Saturday as a family of 30-32.  Put the reservation to be seated at 4:30PM.  We had to beg, every 30 min to find out what was going on. 7:42, we were seated.  Invested too much time in waiting to leave (HA!)  Once part of the party was seated, had to wait again for the other half to be seated.  Another 32 minutes.  Everyone seated, 30 min later order,   One hour and 8 minutes later the first half of the food comes out....Then 13 min later the second half of the food come out...   4 meals were missing!  Terrible, terrible situation.  If you can not handle a party you should just ""bad timing, but we can not accommodate a large party at this time.  But to have us wait.....Shame on You!!!  Will never, never, ever go to Cheesecake again....and for a change...I mean that one!!!"
Lim C.,"Long Beach, CA",3,22,45,2.0,7/29/2017,The waitress we had was very busy in the beginning so another waitress stepped in and took our orders. She was rude and she seemed like she didn't want to be there at all. She didn't even smile at us she kept saying that our waitress is a newbie and she's trying to help but she was so aggravated. When our original waitress did come by to check on us we can hear her talking smack about the customers that just left to another employee. The food overall was alright just very rude customer service.
Cristina C.,"Carson, CA",63,2,,1.0,4/14/2017,"I ordered a Blood orange martini it tasted and smelled like onions. The worst drink ever. I also order the Jambalaya which I have had before, everything was chard and it was a tasteless pasta meal. Everything is over priced and everything was unpleasing to taste. I have been to the Chessecake factory many times , but this time it was the worst experience ever. Manager did not make it any better trying to argue that things were done correctly when in fact they were not."
Renea A.,"Long Beach, CA",325,21,41,4.0,6/27/2016,Ate here yesterday at the new Cerrito's location for the first time and it's just like the rest of the cheesecake factory is pretty good. it wasn't bad at all the server was fair he came at the times we needed him must so I'm guessing all the other negative reviews that are saying about this place or just maybe on the days that they weren't having a good day meaning the reviewers not the cheesecake factory because they were amazing
Tesh R.,"Ontario, CA",80,133,75,4.0,8/1/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants!! Love the food selection. Our server was okay (not the best and definitely not the worst). As for the wait time, yeah, I'll skip that because we all know its never less than 20 minutes during peek time. Lol. We went into the mall and before we could finish looking around, the buzzer was going off . Yes, it works in the mall!!!"
Marcia A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/11/2017,"I had dinner here yesterday with my family and we had great time, great food and good ambiance good service will definitely comeback here! My dad says we should have dinner every weekends!"
Alex G.,"Whittier, CA",27,54,43,4.0,5/30/2016,"Celebrating my 1st wedding anniversary at the Factory. We had good service, food was so filling and sitting with my love of my life for 23 years made for a great date. We had the nacho and OMG is was great but made us too full to eat the rest of our meal. Our server was very informative and sweet, and loved to give us recommendations. We saved a small shoelace for room for the Hersheys cheesecake and it was so delish. Like the addition to the Cerritos mall too."
George L.,"Cerritos, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/7/2016,"I came here after seeing the worst reviews but wanted to try out the place. I was blown away literally with how fast we, a part of two got the seating!  I then ordered a Tai Salmon that wasn't cooked all the way to the bottom.  When I asked the waitress to just heat it up, she offered me a NEW plate!  I felt overwhelmed with the quality of service and generosity.  This is not the end of it.!  The manager came by in few minutes offering an apology and how he can fix the problem! We all know how busy this restaurant or any other restaurants are nowadays.  I must say this place is NOT the same place that I read the reviews about. I give 100% recommendation for anyone to visit. Great service and management we the consumers deserve in dinning!"
Brandon C.,"Buena Park, CA",191,175,120,4.0,7/29/2016,"My girlfriend and I really enjoy coming here for two main reasons.. The Thai Lettuce Wraps and of course.. the dessert. The wait isn't too bad depending on what time you come. The parking can be bad however.  Considering this is a mall and there is a new movie theater right next door, this doesn't really come as a surprise.   Inside, it is pretty small, but nicely laid out.  There's a cool patio area outside and inside the mall for those interested.   For the food. You must consider starting off with the Thai Lettuce Wraps for $13.  It is really worth it, at least to us.  The marinated chicken, cilantro, carrot slices, sliced cucumber, noodles, and the three awesome sauces.. you cannot go much wrong here.   For the main dish, we split the shrimp and steak combo.. It is slightly small, but perfect for sharing if you ask me (considering the wraps and then dessert afterwards). Last but not least, the Hershey's Smore Cheesecake was fabulous.  I've tried the red velvet there too and both are amazing.   The only bad  part was the service.. They forgot to give us plates for our lettuce wraps (it's actually the second time this happend, which now reminds me.. this whole evening was deja vu.. The following three events took place on BOTH nights we came here.. several months apart. 1) They tried to seat us at the bar, we refused. 2) We got seated in the exact same spot. 3) They forgot to bring us plates for our Thai Lettuce Wraps. Oh well, the wraps and dessert made up for it. :)"
Lenie L.,"Lakewood, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/30/2016,We are regulars here! Our server Loreina (sp?) is awesome! Very knowledgeable and attentive to us! Great good and atmosphere!
Erin P.,"Alhambra, CA",0,20,5,2.0,4/5/2017,"This location has been my go-to place to relax and enjoy with my friends.  This time, my Chicken Bellagio was good as usual, so I ordered the $19.95 ""Bang-Bank Chicken & Shrimp"" to go.  This dish was a total failure.  It only had a few small pieces of chicken surrounding a big lump of white rice.  I could not find a single piece of shrimp.  Also, I did not get the brown rice I specifically asked for.  And everyone said the sauce was too sweet.  What a disaster!  I gave 2 stars just because the service was good and the Chicken Bellagio was tasty.  I'd rather buy two of Yoshinoya's chicken bowls.  So disappointed!"
