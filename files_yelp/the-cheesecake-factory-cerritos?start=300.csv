Chloe E.,"Compton, CA",136,12,37,1.0,7/27/2017,"I must say this was one of the worst visits ever. U would think by saying this comment that a waiter threw a tray at me or the hostess cursed me out but this was neither. I always have a great experience at CCF and that's y it's me and my families favorite restaurant. I can't imagine any bad experience ever coming from this place. Yesterday, early evening, me, my mother, and my 4 children came in for dinner. I noticed the restaurant was pretty slow and not that many tables were occupied. My mom is disabled and in a wheelchair and I needed 1 high chair. We were told that there was a 20 min wait which confused me because the place was empty and where they usually seat us was empty also but I didn't sweat the small inconvenience. I am a new vegan so I asked the hostess if there were any dairy free desserts. She sharply replied I wouldn't know you have to go ask the people over there, referring to the dessert counter. Again, I felt whatever, I'm not going to sweat the small stuff. We waited and was seated, guess where?! I wondered why we had to wait in the first place but it's cool. We are all in good spirits and I'm extremely interested in what was available for me for vegan choices. The waitress was great. I forgot her name but she was very attentive, warm, informative and had a great smile. My children ordered from the kids menu and my older son ordered the classic cheeseburger. My mom ordered her favorite catfish but wanted no mashed potatoes because she suffers from renal failure and can't have it. She subbed for a salad. My children also ordered the sliders from the kids meal and I got Evelyn Favorite Pasta which was AMAZING. Here is where it got extremely irritating. There was a shift change and our new waiter took over. At first he seemed ok but that changed once our food was delivered which took the longest I have ever waited here. My order was ok, my older son's order was ok, but my children were brought 2 classic burgers instead of the kid sliders. My mom was brought her food with what looked like double the mash potatoes and a pinch of corn. I alerted the waiter that delivered the food that it was wrong. Our actual waiter seemed upset at that even though he didn't take the order and it wasn't his fault. it was a miscommunication that we weren't even mad about. Things happen.. Anyhow, my mom told him her order was wrong and what needed to be fixed and he walked away looking angry. I watched his response and demeanor every time he walked away and it was a very negative attitude which got me upset as if we was inconveniencing him. The one thing that got me super upset is when my son asked for a refill on his Apple juice. He told us that they didn't refill Apple juice and that I would have to pay the price over... no big deal, the waitress before refilled it and don't mention that so I didn't know it wasn't refillable. He offered my son another beverage and mentioned lemonade and my son accepted. This time when he walked away, he frowned and said something under his breath to which everyone at the table saw. At that point I walked out and told my mother I'll be back.. I needed some fresh air. I came back to my mom talking to the waiter about the additional charge for the beverage he offered my son and I just said forget it. I'll pay it. $2 dollars is nothing, I just wanted to go. I was upset. This really was the worst experience I have had at ur restaurants. I want to note something. I understand that people are not gonna like everyone that walks in the door. God knows me and my family weren't disrespectful or loud or irritating. Corrections needed to be made for the mistake that was done and that's all we wanted. And we wanted that with a positive attitude. I want u to know that we pay attention. Your customers pay attention to body language and attitudes and watch you walk away and watch you walk to the tables.. I don't know anyone that never is looking for their waiter in a restaurant. I also understand that things can get hectic and you are not always in the best of mood but the industry that your employees decided to work in is dealing with the public WHICH MEANS u give the best possible experience to that customer that supports your paycheck. I am self employed. I own a very successful salon in Bellflower and I treat my clients like gold.. There are times I'm physically tired or upset and don't want to work but I make sure my clients never feel that from me. Please, take a second to remind your employees who they r there for. I know some people are hard to deal with but we were nothing but polite in this situation and was treated like we were bothering our waiter. The high point is the food. Amazing food for the price point but the highlight in ANY service job is the customer service. That's key over everything. I feel I wasted $80 because of the service. I usually tip 20% and more because i know how much tips are appreciated in this field but with that service I couldn't do it."
Patty R.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",22,3,7,1.0,2/5/2017,"Food is great, but the service is horrible! After waiting for 20 minutes someone finally took our order for food and drinks. It took overall about an hour for all of our food to come out just to have the server rush us out. I had my meal for maybe about 5 minutes when he was already asking if we needed a box.  Wasted no time bringing the check and practically waited for it right by us. Other tables were complaining about service too. Management really needs to step it up, most of the servers were just talking in the corners while tables just waited."
J P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,2,1.0,3/12/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants. Because of their extensive menu.. However the Cerritos Location is horrendous, they have more misses than hits.   Went out yesterday evening, with my sister and some friends who also love the Cheesecake Factory. If you are going to charge high prices you need to back it up with quality food.  Luckily for you most  people settle for substandard food. Last night was probably the worst example of cooking, that I have ever experienced.   It is time to rethink your cooking staff and make some changes. Kevin the waiter was a nice guy, but never bothered to refill our water glasses. The bread and butter was great as usual... The appetizers were a dismal failure.   The crab cake bites were mushy and tasteless, the fried zucchini sticks were were not cooked, , the kale salad was not up to it's usual standard... the firecracker  salmon bites came out burnt and over cooked, although they did get replaced after our request. Everything that was ordered was below our expectations and tasteless. Everyone has a off night but this was ridiculous. The Kobe burger that was ordered was the only thing ordered last night that was good. My Farfalle Chicken Pasta W/ Garlic had great potential but the sauce was too sweet, I just couldn't eat it, which was sent back and replaced with the order of Bang Bang Chicken. When my plate arrived it was chicken and shrimp which I let pass,  it had a huge serving of rice in the middle of the plate surrounded and drowned by this sickening sweet sauce that made me gag, When I tried to eat it., there was not heat at all.  When the other 3 at my table tasted the sauce we all agreed that it was a disaster. I have had Bang Bang Chicken at Thai restaurants and it is not suppose to be that sweet. The Jambalaya Chicken Pasta was spicy but that was the only flavor profile that it had. The Chicken Cashew was also overly sweet and didn't have any flavor. Overall it was extremely disappointing... After looking forward all week to coming to Cheesecake Factory.  On top of spending  $160 or more. I don't have a problem spending money on great tasting food, because when the food is good that brings value to how much you are spending, When the food is substandard you feel sucker punched. We could have went somewhere else and had a better meal for the money. After a while it becomes meaningless when Management say they are ""sorry you didn't have a great experience"" because at the end of the day they still have your money in their pockets."

Bridgett F.,"Fullerton, CA",3,13,2,1.0,12/26/2016,Bad management we waited 3 hours to be seated. You might be thinking why we just didn't leave. Well my brother got there at 6 and management said 1.30 but come back for buzzer at 7 he said ok. Went back and gave him the buzzer and said it would be about 1 hour and he said ok cuz we weren't there yet we got there 730 and waited another hour...they don't know what they are doing there
Theresa Q.,"Long Beach, CA",59,94,,2.0,4/29/2016,"I called to make a reservation for Mothers Day.  The female employee who picked up the phone said she only had a few spots left.  After waiting 8 minutes on the phone, I hung up and called back, thinking I was forgotten.  A different female voice picked up the phone.  She said ""We don't do NO reservations on Mothers Day.""  I was shocked at the formation of her sentence.  So I asked her to please repeat that.  I got the exact same sentence repeated.  That came across as poor customer service skills and very unprofessional.  ""Wow,"" I thought. ""What has happened to the nice, cheery, upbeat voices I've gotten at other locations in the past.""  Then I told her I was put on hold by another girl who told me she had a few spots left before she put me on hold for 8 minutes.  She repeated the exact same sentence a third time.   ""We don't do no..."" I am surprised management has an employee answering the phone who doesn't know that they do not take reservations on 5/8, and tells me they have spots left when they don't exist and puts me on hold to find out the time of the remaining spots, then never comes back on the phone.  And, disappointed they have another employee, who did not learn proper grammar in school, answer the phone making a first impression on every customer she talks to.  Maybe it's my management background where I would never tolerate this with my employees.  Rather I'd place employees in positions where they would fit best. The fact that there are SO MANY POOR REVIEWS on Yelp about this location, makes me curious why District and Regional management is not on top of this PROBLEM.  It sure is making this company look bad!  I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  Because of this I also sent a complaint to Cheesecake Factory headquarters.   My experience and ALL these low reviews need to be addressed. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  So now, I will take the $150 we were going to spend with our large party elsewhere.  Sad."
J K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",100,15,6,5.0,12/15/2016,We had a large take-out order today and accidentally forgot the most important bag- the one containing all of our cheesecake slices! Co-worker returned to the restaurant to retrieve the bag and the manager took the 4 slices off our bill. Exceptional customer service. We order take-out for our company often and are happy guests every time. Thank you!
Joy N.,"Gardena, CA",104,59,171,4.0,7/8/2016,"This is my 3rd visit at this new location and it's been pleasant. We always get seated right away as soon as we walk in. Our food took a little while to come though, but the quality is pretty consistent with the other locations. Convenient and close to home."
Bryan M.,"Downey, CA",88,11,3,1.0,12/13/2016,Bread and butter is just about the only good thing here. Service is non existent. Meals arrive late. Missing orders. Check takes over 30 minutes to get. Not a good experience for a birthday dinner celebration.
Walter T.,"Bellflower, CA",9,230,164,4.0,1/23/2016,"This was my first experience here and it was very good. We went to celebrate my coworker birthday on a Thursday for lunch and everything was good. The place is brand new, so everything was spotless. We were seated right away (8 of us) and we all ordered something different. Our server (Jesus) brought all orders correctly and fast and all of them were hot (sounds crazy, but sometimes when you have big parties some of the dishes are room temperature because they were waiting for the other dishes). Jesus kept refilling our glasses (even mine that was water) and brought hot bread all the time. I will be back.  My only complaint is that the prices are a little high for me, even the lunch specials."
Jj D.,"Norwalk, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/6/2017,Stay away from chicken potstickers !!! Salty over cooked barely any chicken and over priced.  Food took forever to come out of kitchen. The only positive aspects of this place are the hardworking servers and hosts.
Kenia J.,"Norwalk, CA",0,12,9,3.0,12/2/2016,"The service was ok friendly but way too slow. The food was nasty the pasta was under cooked,  tasted like dough, the chicken had no flavor & lastly their  was too much ice on the drinks."
Peter S.,"Cypress, CA",2,7,,1.0,9/5/2016,"If I could give a lower score I would. Service was terrible. We sat in the Bar on a high top. Alex our server was inattentive and slow on the uptake. Was served nearly 1/2 hour after we ordered. Food was served cold. Alex's answer, I wish I was back there cooking? Really? Order burger and fish taco. Burger was delivered stone cold! cheese was not even Melted. Roll, gluten free was stale  Fish taco the same way! It was basically inedible. The CF location at Bella Terra is much better, more attentive service and much better cooking staff taking care of the customers."
Ashley V.,"Signal Hill, CA",28,43,15,1.0,11/22/2016,"Food was average.Defently not worth a 45 min wait.The fries that came out were hot.Are $20.00 plates sucked the food wasn't even hot.Now to top it off my 1yr old son,husband & I have food poisining.The Servers were very nice..BUT WE will not be coming back!!!"
Andrea C.,"Beltsville, MD",10,48,,4.0,6/28/2016,To the other person that reviewed about the heavily tattooed waitrer-seriously? Stay home with your narrow minded mentality.  Now on to the review: very nice place and friendly service.  Customer service was great.  We were there last weekend.  The food was good and well cooked. The cheesecake we had was the new York style.  We had 2 mint mojito.
Thomas T.,"Fullerton, CA",310,289,411,4.0,12/29/2015,Went to this new Cheesecake for dinner tonight with a group of 6 friends. Our experience was a good one. Not the best but not bad either. We got seated on the patio since it was so busy. No biggie. A little chilly out there but what do you expect. The heat lamps worked very well.  As far as food goes we had no complaints. Everything was made perfect except the pasta on one of our dishes was a tad undercooked. But it was still good.  Our waitress was Nicole. She was very attentive and courteous. Service was on point except for a busser who went away to get water refills for us but never came back. Some of the other bussers also lag. We had hella plates and bowls on our table waiting to get taken away but instead of doing that they were setting up other tables. So I just bussed our own table and put our dirty plates and dishes on the clean table next to us. The busser just looked at me like why I was doing that. So I put more dishes on the clean table haha. He should have came over and bussed our table.  But Nicole was great.
Jasmine M.,"Bellflower, CA",143,3,1,5.0,8/10/2016,Thank you Jacqueline for making my friends 20th birthday a special one! You definitely went above and beyond for us and her. Great waitress ! Thank you for buying our friend a cheesecake
Kevin C.,"Long Beach, CA",24,7,19,1.0,5/1/2016,We went to eat there and they told us they had a 40-minute wait. I saw 16 open tables that I counted on my way back out the door. So much for eating there.
Sam P.,"Norwalk, CA",0,6,4,4.0,3/17/2016,This was a great Thai chicken lettuce wraps And the cucumber lemonade is also just as good
Van M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,26,2,2.0,9/15/2016,"Compared to the Huntington Beach Cheesecake Factory, the one in Cerritos mall is a disappointment. They do not compare to the HB restaurant. Service is horrible at Cerritos. We had an issue with a food item we ordered for lunch and what should have taken only 10 or less minutes to fix, it took 30 minutes (after a promise by 3 staff people including the manager, that it would be taken care of immediately. Not so. The manager never even returned to see how we were doing. She was horrible). I've gone there numerous times for take out (cheesecake slice), and majority of the time, they're super slow. It's like they don't care about their customers. Very sad. If you want great service --- go to the Huntington Beach CCF. They are on the ball there and care about their customers."
