Jesse P.,"Norwalk, CA",26,39,33,4.0,1/16/2017,"On the day my wife mother and myself went to have an early dinner it was extremely crowded, the front desk appeared to be overwhelmed and this seemed to trickle down to the servers. I do understand that this is a risk you take when you go to have dinner out at any place you go. Our server seemed annoyed, but then again it could have been attributed to her being overwhelmed with tables to cover. Would I go back here again? Perhaps. What is a concern I have that can be addressed? How about adding a feature that allows people to make reservations online? Reservations may help. *Update-management reached out to me through this comment on yelp and assured me that would be an isolated incident. That goes along way in showing the value of the customer. Thank you!!"
Joshua L.,"Artesia, CA",275,19,40,5.0,5/31/2016,Great food and the server's recommendation was perfect! The only downside was the 30 minute wait but there's a mall full of stores to check out!
Canan G.,"Torrance, CA",1,6,,1.0,2/17/2017,Worst Cheesecake Factory service ever. I am a huge fan and loyal customer of The Cheesecake Factory but I don't like the server's attitude. I'll try another location but this one is out of my list.
Daniel R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/11/2017,"I seem to have come during a group employee training? Our waitress was somewhat ditzy but she did her job. We ordered avocado eggrols and they never came, and to my dismay they no longer carry the Kahlua cheesecake."
Christian A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,8,5.0,2/14/2017,Took my wife here for her birthday and best food and best customer service.. they sing happy birthday to my wife with the couple of servers.. it was an amazing night and we will surely recommend this place and we will come back again since we just live in lakewood.. Thanks!
Jaret T.,"Cerritos, CA",16,5,1,5.0,1/24/2017,"So I waited a while to post up this review. I live at this Cheesecake Factory. I mean since they open everything about this place has been amazing! The food taste great, the service is on point, & the Cheesecake of course Bomb! Anyways Cerritos Cheesecake feels so clean & cozy. I love having date nights here with my wife. The ""Long Island"" Wow! Or maybe just cruise by & have lunch with my kid. The managers come around & check up on you which is very professional. By the way (Marisela) the manager, she's excellent! I don't have anything negative to say about this restaurant. I love eating here. Oh how can I forget, the outside patio is so cool! Guys just go check out this place trust me..."
Bryant N.,"Cerritos, CA",330,130,136,5.0,11/29/2015,"Even though cheesecake factory is too commercial, food still is amazing, today i got the dinner combo chicken madeira and steak diane! I normally get the hibachi steak with wasabi mash potatoes but I ended up trying steak diane which was worth the try. The chicken madeira was amazing, the server mention it being one of there best sellers!!!"
Sakura C.,"Anaheim, CA",25,32,13,5.0,6/27/2016,"I enjoyed the food here and the service they provided at this Cheesecake Factory location. First we ordered the appetizer spinach dip and avocado egg rolls-yummy! Avocado egg rolls are a must try. We ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp & my husband ordered the steak. My fettuccine Alfredo came out perfect but he said steak was ok. Other than that, there is always something to try with the whole family. The Cheese cakes here is the star of this restaurant so make sure you pick a couple up while your here."
Tom C.,"Rome, Italy",0,132,334,3.0,1/22/2017,"Came here for a work lunch.  Average food, average service but the cheesecake was the highlight."
LeLe Q.,"Cerritos, CA",1,10,5,5.0,6/5/2016,"It's beautiful inside and on the patio. The staff  was excellent and genuinely  friendly. Arrived under dressed, because we were just looking for a late night snack, but nobody cares or noticed. Got seated fast, served right away.  We were loud and laughing and felt free to enjoy each other without judgement. .. a thing I always appreciate.  Almost felt like we were alone.  Best thing: loaded baled potato soup which tasted like a bacon n potato bisque. The creamy baked potato  OMG so bomb.  The patio is huge and goregous. Nice space for a private party. Worst: the filet mignot had a burnt sear which tasted bitter and no flavoring. Didn't like that at all but the hubby dis so...guess it's just me being picky.  Will go again and review again."
Monica C.,"Whittier, CA",124,8,5,5.0,2/9/2017,Our server Jennifer Sam was the best she made our night incredible such a great attitud definitely coming back to this place her service was amazing
Will Z.,"Lakewood, CA",1,5,5,2.0,7/20/2016,"Arrived at 4.30 with a party of 10, was told it would be 25 minutes to be seated. After waiting 25 minutes asked what was the problem was he said the server hadn't arrived yet maybe a few more minutes  at 5:15 we said we were done waiting,just seat us inside. At 6.15 are food started  arriving. 8 of 10 said the food was over salted and not that good the other two enjoyed theirs(medallions and shrimp platter) service was good though. Cheesecake was good."
William I.,"Downey, CA",78,44,5,1.0,2/5/2017,Been an hour. No food. My 4 year old starving. At least we have bread and water.  This use to be a great place to eat.
Simon B.,"Carson, CA",4,7,2,1.0,3/27/2016,This venue is Sub-Par to the usual Cheescake Factory. Extremely long wait for anything.  Not worth the wait.   If your hungry make sure to bring a sandwich cause you won't be eating anytime soon.
Jay L.,"Lakewood, CA",74,147,257,4.0,11/23/2015,"The food is always going to be amazing. Me and my boyfriend have come here a total of 4x in one month. 1st time: was around 10:30pm We got seated right away, we got very lucky. Our server was a guy in which I wish I remembered his name because he was the best! Very professional and asked him recomendation for the cheesecake so I ordered it, and it has become MY FAVORITE DESERT! Everything we ordered was on point except the Clam Chowder which could be improved! 2nd/3rd time, came around 9 and got lucky again by getting seated right away, we only came for desserts. Our server was a young man he was a little slow. 4th time: came with my bf and his family, it was supposed to be 40-an hour wait, it ended up more. I asked the asian girl up front about this and she gave me an attitude. That reason knocked out a star for me. Because the service has been superb for me. We were seated and our server... She was gone majority of the time. Food took a very long time..  Service tends to be bad at a very bust time of the night. After 10:30 it gets better. But it's a hit or miss. Chicken Bellagio was very good, if you love chicken. I mean wow! All the burgers are on point!"
Darlene Marie L.,"Lakewood, CA",67,38,96,4.0,6/24/2016,"My husband and I do love Cheesecake Factory. Their menu holds a wide variety of selections as well as their cheesecake options.  I always end up ordering one of a few of my favorites (crispy chicken costolleta, buffalo blasts, or Thai lettuce wraps) my husband loves their crab cakes and orders them every time we come. We came at 10:00 on a Thursday evening and were seated right away. Luckily they close at 11 so it's great for a late night eats. The service was good and the food was good as usual. I know this location does get quite busy during dinner and on the weekends- especially as it's a bit smaller than other cheesecake factories. Although this is a ""chain"" reastaurant and I do prefer unique private owned joints, cheecake factory is definitely one of our go to's. Not to mention their red velvet cheesecake is AMAZING!!"
Steven M.,"Lakewood, CA",358,800,40,3.0,3/28/2016,"Personally, I like the old menu!  The only thing on the new menu I LOOOOVE is the avocado egg rolls!  I can eat a dozen of them and that would be my meal!  Otherwise this place is just an expensive comfort food joint.  Service is pretty good, atmosphere is good, food is ok...not anything wonderful or amazing here IMHO.  The factory has gone down in quality of food if you ask me...still edible but you decide if you love it or not.  I think you can eat at Black Bear diner for the same food but a bit cheaper"
Elaine E.,"Long Beach, CA",75,2,,1.0,2/23/2017,"Don't come to this Cheesecake Factory.  Food poisoning from the salmon, avocado toast served with stale bread another time. And today, tamale cakes I just had to dig foil out of my tooth after the second bite. Go to Huntington Beach, Marina del Rey, Santa Monica. Not Cerritos!!! And I  have loved the Cheesecake factory for 30 years. Not this one and they have only been open one year."
Alexandra B.,"Artesia, CA",0,7,2,5.0,1/11/2017,Came here last night. Usually it's beyond packed and the wait is crazy. We were sat in about 15 minutes and our server Nicole was at our table seconds after we sat down. She made suggestions and made sure we never had to ask for anything. She was extremely attentive and friendly. By far the best experience we've had here.
joe k.,"Lakewood, CA",0,39,81,2.0,2/23/2017,"where to begin. for starters, they brought some bread that seemed a few days old, just heated in the microwave. the butter was rock solid from the fridge. for appetizers we got some crab cakes. two small cakes for something like 14 dollars. pretty pricey.  we tried the garlic noodles which was very bland and the noodles tasted soggy.  i'm giving an extra star because i tried the burger and they cooked it the way i ordered, medium. the fries were super soggy and stringy like it'd been sitting out for a day, but we walked in 30 minutes after they opened, so how does that happen? i'd not come back here, but i had to, i'd get the burger and nothing else."
