Male P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/25/2016,"I bought their cheesecake for a potluck, tasted bland, very heavy.  $50 thrown away.  What a waste, their signature item and they screw it up."
Kim C.,"Lakewood, CA",2,26,1,5.0,10/8/2016,"After reading all of the negative reviews, after already deciding on a birthday dinner for my mother-in-law, I was a bit leery about sticking with our choice. We arrived around 5:55pm and was told we would have a our a 30 minute wait. Looking around at the crowd I thought that was never going to happen. The Cheesecake Factory sits right next to the new Harkins movie theater, so it is a very popular place to eat. At the thirty minute mark I made my way in to ask how much longer it would be, I made it to the desk just as my buzzer went off, so I went out and retrieved the rest of our party. We had only been seated for about 30 seconds, when our server, David, asked us for our drink choices. Two black iced teas and one water. Hard to mess up, but the teas came out sweetened. When he came back to get our order I told him he could have the tea back, because it didn't taste  like black to me. He apologized and asked if he could try again. (He admitted he might have poured the tropical instead of black). The next tea out was black, freshly brewed, strong and just as I like it! I ordered the Almond Crusted Super Green Salad, Mom ordered the Super Green Antioxidant salad with grilled chicken added, and my boyfriend ordered the tomato basil salad w/chicken. Our wait for food was about 20 minutes, but considering how busy the place is, it wasn't a bad wait at all. David came by several times to add water and tea to our glasses, never letting any of our drinks get low. Our food came out just right. My salmon was cooked to perfection, which is hard to do with such a small (4-6oz) piece. The salad underneath was cold and very good. Mom's chicken was warm and juicy, atop a salad she said was very good. My boyfriend's pasta & chicken were cooked just right. A little too salty for him, but he is very sensitive to salt, so I'm not going to bring down my star rating. It was mom's 71st birthday so they brought out a small ice cream Sunday and sang to her. We ordered a Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake, an Original for the table and one to go. I shouldn't have ordered the one to go, because we did bring home half of each piece. The pumpkin cheesecake tasted just like a pumpkin chiffon pie, and the sour cream topping on the original added a layer of goodness!  Forget the negative reviews you'll read here. It's a busy place, because it's a popular place. If you want to get in and get out, go somewhere else. Their staff was all friendly, attentive and the food was great. Actually, the food was much better than I expected, as it is a chain restaurant and sometimes the quality isn't as high as local hot spots.  I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory at the Cerritos Mall, to all of my friends and family who come to visit."
Meka W.,"Long Beach, CA",53,20,,1.0,7/20/2017,"I will not be going there again. The utensils were filthy, the bread was stale and the food took forever to come. Food not good like it use to be."
Michelle R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,37,,1.0,7/31/2017,"This place is the worsth of them all! Over priced restaurant that has a lot of inconvenience to offer. The Management is extremely poor considering they can not contain the traffic. Its bad enough that the wait time is atrocious then, as you get seated that is another half of your day consumed waiting for a server. And finally, another 45 minutes if u get lucky to wait for the food to be served. Overall, if you want to dine here be prepared that the only agenda you have for the entire day will be allocated for this reataurant. The food is not even fantastic. The salad that I ordered was supposed to be endive and when it finally arrived the salad was filled by pieces of vegies that came from the end part of it which you can imagine the hard tail part.  By the time we started eating I was mostly upset already due to the extreme wait period. I do not recommend this place if you are a busy person and up and running on  a busy day. Either way, Iam not going back there at all. There are far more better places and bake shops around the area."
Elisha R.,"Paramount, CA",51,207,1047,4.0,3/4/2016,"I really like this location and im glad they came over this way so i dont have to go all the way to Redondo Beach. This is our 3rd time coming since they opened about 5 months ago. The staff, drinks and food are great. Today is Friday we came around 4:15 the beginning of happy hour, it was getting crowded but there wasnt a wait yet. We opted to sit at the bar since we had just had a late lunch across the street and just wanted drinks & dessert. The bartender Reuben H. was wonderful. For drinks we had a bellini, mai tai and long island ice tea, for dessert we shared a strawberry shortcake and apple struesel cheesecake, everything tasted great. The only bad thing was the young lady behind the bar the entire time bothering the guys while they were working. I dont know if she was supposed to be back there helping or something but she was playing the entire time. We will definately be back"
Glenda R.,"Norwalk, CA",162,49,163,5.0,6/6/2016,Alex was my server today and no questions asked when I asked him to replace the zucchini and avocado with all portabello fries. Great! The Bistro shrimp was great too lots of shrimp. Yum!
Marc R.,"Bellflower, CA",173,12,4,5.0,1/12/2017,The Hibachi steak I order was on point and Tony at the bar was on top of his game he was a great bartender and waiter to us I'm going to dine here more often just because of the great service tonight
mai t.,"Fullerton, CA",6,22,14,1.0,5/10/2016,"I wish I could give a zero. This is not my first time here but I had no choice but come back here coz of my mother who picked this place for lunch. I am literally writing this review as I am seated in our booth here at the restaurant.  First off, they offered us a pub table to sit. I am 6 months pregnant who looks like about to give birth coz I am big and they did not even consider that I have to climb a high chair. We then got moved to the patio where the heater is on. So again we waited to be seated inside. Lots of empty tables but not moving fast enough. Our server was I would say a late 30s chunky Asian guy, I just got seated and we were already asked what we want to order. The way he handed me my menu was like passing a paper backwards (i was seated on his right) not directly facing you or laying it on the  table in front of you. I felt so rush, I lost my appetite. After the inconvenience of getting a parking, waiting for our table, I ended up not eating anything. I just had my mother eat and I was dying to get out of here. Every so often, the wall next to me vibrates loud too. Never coming back here."
Christina A.,"Henderson, NV",1,29,3,5.0,5/24/2017,it's always a pleasure to come here. i don't understand why there aren't better reviews.
Joy T.,"Long Beach, CA",140,1,,1.0,4/28/2016,"Very poorly run Cheesecake Factory. We waited for 2 hours to be seated (at 3:30 on a Sunday) and the manager was incredibly rude and even pushed us out of the way to talk to another server. Waited another hour for our food, they got several orders wrong, and another hour for cheesecake. The server was nice but overloaded with tables.  They should have made the restaurant much bigger and they need to start taking reservations. Their customer service was horrible. I will stick to other Cheesecake Factories in the area."
Victoria D.,"Cypress, CA",74,31,13,1.0,5/10/2016,"Absolutely terrible. I ordered the Baja chicken tacos for takeout. Usually in the past I have enjoyed this dish, but unfortunately I will never order this again. The tacos had no meat and was full of chipotle sauce. The chicken was not tender and the presentation was sloppy. I paid 15 bucks for the meal and was thoroughly disappointed. For the amount of money I paid, I would of expected way more meat and guacamole. I ended up paying 15 dollars for sauce and tortillas. Don't waste your money or time."
Krystalyn Laura R.,"Long Beach, CA",588,8,16,3.0,11/22/2015,"My boyfriend and I came for a lunch date around 3 PM on a Sunday. Since it's Thanksgiving break, we assumed the mall would be busy since everyone is trying to do their Black Friday pre-sale shopping. It was pretty exciting to finally have a Cheesecake Factory nearby, though.  We came in and the wait time was 50 minutes. Fortunately, the range of the beeper let us walk around the mall in the meantime so the wait wasn't so bad. We sat down and didn't wait long for our server. We asked for extra time to look at the menu, so she got us water. It took four servers to get straws for our water.  We ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert. The alfredo sauce was okay, and the chicken was bland. The strawberry cheesecake was really good, and I totally recommend it.  Overall, the service was slow and it could use some improvement. The food was decent. The atmosphere was loud as expected."
Curtis W.,"Long Beach, CA",210,6,,1.0,7/8/2017,"I didn't even get to eat. When I first arrived, they told me 15-20 minutes. I asked how far I could go from the restaurant because I wanted to walk around the mall a little bit. When I got back, I asked the server at the front if I walked to far out of range and how much longer was the wait. She, with a nasty attitude said, ""We told you about 25 minutes and its only been 18 minutes."" After 45 minutes of her looking at me with a nasty dogging stare, and at least 15 tables be sat, I had to leave. I even asked another guest what number was on his buzzer and it was 20 numbers behind mines."
Frankie J.,"Long Beach, CA",187,37,9,1.0,2/29/2016,"Well, what can be expected of a chain restaurant nowadays (unless you're In-N-Out Burger).  Aside from that I've never thought Cheesecake Factory was anything special and tonight proves my dislike for the chain. First offense: Cleanliness. This is where they really fell short.  The plates were dirty and had pieces of food stuck to them, the same went for the silverware and beverage glasses.  Just seemed unsanitary; also our table felt sticky like they hadn't cleaned it and had some residue that we could feel when placing our fingers over the center of said table. Second offense:  Service. I don't remember the server's name but he had a bit of an attitude; granted, he may have had a crummy night I get it we're allowed to have feelings but be professional in your work.  He even brushed my side of the table, dropped my silverware and walked off.  He didn't acknowledge or apologize for doing that. This is the first and last time I will ever be dining at this establishment.  Save your money and go elsewhere, hell, go to Costco and get some of their cheesecake there if you want but that's just me. Happy Eating - FJ"
Chelsi D.,"Cerritos, CA",438,23,11,2.0,4/30/2016,"WARNING!  If you're planning to place a to-go order, expect at LEAST a 40min wait!  I called in to place an order to go since I was on the run. After speaking to a staff member to place my order I was informed that my salad would take about 15-20min. No big deal since that's how long to go orders would take. When I get there right at the 15min mark I was told it wasn't ready yet. I didn't mind since I knew I was still within in the time frame, and just paid for my bill ahead of time. Ended up waiting a total of 45min for a salad. A salad! Plus I called in ahead of time.  If you plan to get something quick, then save your time and don't call here."
Stacey P.,"Long Beach, CA",95,54,14,2.0,5/14/2016,"I ordered the Catfish.  It was terrible.  It was greasy   It taste like it was prepared in old grease and it was overcooked. Worst of all the bathroom was dirty.  There was graffiti on the toilet.  I probably should have told a staff member bit I was rushing out to use the restroom somewhere else. Also this post serves as second chance to express my opinion  However, the server was nice and the Cheesecake was great."
Lyle O.,"Gardena, CA",33,177,147,5.0,4/3/2016,"Celebrated a 7yr anniversary Saturday night, really busy, but service was quick and efficient.  We were seated in less than 20 minutes and the ambience was loud and hustling.  It seemed everyone was enjoying themselves so can't figure out the terrible reviews, must be unpleasant individuals who wrote them.  Our waitress Jennifer was very hospitable and very informative.  She consistently came around and checked on our table of four, water always filled and overall great service.  Typhoon Punch was delicious, the Venice Duck IPA was an excellent choice.  I don't think you can beat the Banana cream cheesecake but the Mango keylime cheesecake came close.  The meat loaf is a winner along with the chicken costelleto (spelling may be wrong).  Overall dining experience 5 stars.  Jennifer was excellent!"
Diana S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",73,248,57,1.0,10/2/2016,This place need better management! I always go to cheesecake and food is always great but their customer service is horrible. Literally called 5 minutes before I walked in for a party of 8 and they said over the phone no wait I showed up and she said almost a 2 hour wait and the place was NOT packed! It was actually empty and had amply room to seat us. Then the lovely manager said we can go eat somewhere else if we like and started naming off all the other restaurants in the mall! What kind of service is this cheesecake????? HOW DAMN RUDE
Sarah M.,"Buena Park, CA",0,5,12,5.0,12/10/2015,"First off, let me tell you that I'm soooooo excited that Cerritos opened a CheeseCake Factory at their mall!! This is my favorite restaurant and I hated driving all the way to Bella Tera. Well, today the occasion was my grandmother's 93rd birthday. So, my mom and I decided to come here and try it out. It was WONDERFUL!! Matthew was our waiter and he was AMAZING!! He was personable, very attentive, caring, and helpful!! I will definitely be coming back!! Thank you Matthew!!"
Tony V.,"Downey, CA",0,16,2,1.0,7/24/2017,"Terrible service! Very poor, rude, and unprofessional customer service. Not to mention the microwavable food!"
