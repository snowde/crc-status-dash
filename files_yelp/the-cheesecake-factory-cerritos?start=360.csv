Joseph E.,"Cerritos, CA",27,4,,1.0,4/28/2016,"Worst service.  Had to take half the party home because they refused to seat us.  If it weren't for a little girls birthday wish, I would have drug the whole party to another location. Poor planning with half the restraunt empty leaving a party of 15 waiting 90 minutes in addition to prior arrangements.  The excuse was that other big party won't leave for the last 2 1/2 hours.  The manager refused to come talk to us.  Go ahead if you're on a date and not an inconvenience to them.  Anything big and important deserves better."
Michael C.,"Buena Park, CA",0,17,,2.0,6/4/2017,"I've been to this location 3 times already.  2/3 have been miserable experiences, consisting of mind numbingly slow service, forgetful wait staff, incorrect orders.  Both times they took our orders, and 10 minutes later came back to tell us that they were out of the item.  The staff isn't rude or anything and the food is not horrible, so I can't leave a 1 star review."
M A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,14,10,5.0,9/13/2016,"That's not Fair. I don't know why this restaurant is only 2.5 stars!!!! Their food is awesome and their service is so attentive. We ordered 2 luna salads, shrimp platter and chicken jambalaya and all was fantastic. Thank you."
Sara J.,"Westminster, CA",124,24,2,1.0,3/18/2016,"Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory. But the Cerritos mall location is a total bust. I was so excited when they first opened because it was so close to where I live. But honestly, now, I'd rather drive 25 minutes on the freeway to go to the hb location or brea.  My first bad experience was 2 weeks after their grand opening. I didn't write a review back then because I figured the service was suffering due to the restaurant being so new. But we just went back and it's still horrible. It's the same ol- nice but slow and clueless servers who forget everything, even if they write it down. And it wasn't even that busy! I just had enough of the Cerritos location"
Sandy P.,"Lakewood, CA",51,19,10,2.0,3/10/2016,Bad service... Long wait times for food.. Wrong order brought to us. This was the worse cheese factory experience we've had. I recommended cheesecake factory to my group since we always default to bjs and it was a complete failure. We usually don't send our food back but they totally messed up our order. The manager then recited to us his commercialized apology that Im sure is what he spends most of his day doing.  ** Trust these bad reviews!! Go to another location!! Don't be fooled if they seat you fast.. You'll be waiting a long time inside for your food!! ** To the managers.. Read these reviews!! U guys are embarrassing the brand and the city of Cerritos!!
Madeline C.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,5.0,11/29/2016,"Great place, went there around 9pm. Got a table fast and the service was great. Food was delicious. Is at the Mall so I guess it can be crowded sometimes but I think is a great place. So glad now I have one close by. I'm definitely coming back."
Paul G.,"Los Alamitos, CA",95,49,136,3.0,3/25/2016,"Desert Resort style patio experience. There is a complete drink selection with awesome starters and finishers. This is the place for a meet up or quick ""take the edge off"" before a long night on the town."
Henry L.,"Cerritos, CA",191,69,,5.0,9/21/2016,"I am happy to report that after a pretty tumultuous start, this cheesecake factory has finally started living up to its brand. The food was perfect and the waitstaff is on point. I like that there is a lot of parking and that you can go see a movie or shop in the mall right after!"
Rosa M.,"Downey, CA",15,14,40,2.0,3/5/2016,Took way too long to get my food. My chicken chili was very salty so I retuned it. We tried Chicken Alfredo and was not good at all. Don't recommend this place.
Kiran S.,"Cypress, CA",1,6,3,1.0,3/5/2016,Wait time 2 hrs and u need to wait 1 hr after u order food. I don't know may be only one chef in kitchen because it's economy.if u see u r bill u feel like most expensive restaurant. Better to avoid but if u r core cheesecake  factory fan i can't help with my review.
Randolph L.,"Bellflower, CA",10,11,,3.0,11/23/2016,"The food was good, however, compared to the one in Irvine it feels like the food is lacking something. I've ate at several cheesecake factories before and had an excellent meal and a fantastic time, but the overall quality is just okay at this location."
Matthew T.,"Santa Ana, CA",155,6,,1.0,9/30/2016,"My party of 18 waited for over 3hrs tonight to be seated because they refused to take a reservation. Eventually, we went across the street to BJs where they seated us all in 5 minutes. Our 4 kids were starving after having waited for so long. By this time it was after 10pm!!! Want to give NO stars. I have been to othe Cheesecakes and I understand long waits, but 3hrs is unacceptable. Especially when they quoted us an hour and a half."
Carolina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,149,230,5.0,2/10/2016,"No matter how many times I come to The Cheesecake Factory , I never get tired of it! There Menu selection has so many options and The food portions they serve can easily be for two people! Great Service, Very Clean and Delicious Food"
Sherryl M.,"North Hills, CA",220,12,1,5.0,11/4/2016,It's always good here. Chicken farfalle is usually what I get and never a let down. Good bread and of course cheesecake
Gloria B.,"Paramount, CA",4,2,1,1.0,6/8/2017,"I've come to this location a couple of times but tonight I was highly disappointed. Came in with a party of 10 after a graduation and we just wanted to sit together or close to each other and they had us split on complete different ends of the restaurant. Asked to be moved closer and the actual manager was kind of rude to say sorry I can't do anything about it. Finally a host said we could sit up front together and it was another big deal just to move a table slightly over. Waited for meals and drinks for an eternity. To make this dinner story short last min the manger comes over to talk about under age drinking about the graduate who happens to be 23. That manager didn't offer any apologies and was just being so rude. Our meal was already finished, seemed like he was just looking for reasons to nit pick. I work in customer service and I always try to remain calm but arnt you suppose to make your customer happy? We weren't asking for any discounts or free items, all we wanted was good service and it ended up being a nightmare."
William R.,"Buena Park, CA",0,26,1,2.0,2/25/2016,"Hostess told us (party of 2) it would be a 15 to 20 min wait.  We waited nearly 40 min.  Food was taking FOREVER to come out.  We did not complain, but the manager came out anywaus and apologized for the wait.  He told us the mash potatos were ""not up to standards"" and it was the reason for the delay.  He said the mash potatos were not available.  I substituted something else. Finally, the food came out.  They put mashed potatos on my plate.  It was disgusting....very salty, mealy, and very loose.  Didn't the manager just tell me the potatos were bad?  The kitchen obviously knew, hence the long delay. The waitress was completely aloof and offered no apology. The bill came and the waitress had the same attitude, but said they ""adjusted the price"" of my meal........BY $1.  WOW! This was my 2nd bad experience at this location."
Jeannie T.,"Vista, CA",22,13,1,1.0,11/11/2016,"How is it that you know you're busy, you have the nerve to quote a 1 hour wait time, but won't take a name over the phone, nor will you take a reservation? What would compel me to ever want to go to your chain restaurant when there are better, individually owned restaurants closer to home with much better food and service?? Hmmm..."
Elle V.,"Cerritos, CA",0,38,3,3.0,6/23/2017,"Been here a few times during lunch on a weekday. Service was good since it wasn't crowded. The food is very pricey. Overall, food is good but not worth the price. I would come for the cheesecake though. Even though it's not cheap at $9 a slice, it's very good. Faves are red velvet, raspberry lemon, mango."
Linda S.,"Lakewood, CA",56,172,18,3.0,4/7/2016,"I was torn between giving them 2 or 3 stars.  The food was fine (nothing spectacular), but the service was really slow.  We probably waited about 10-15 minutes to place our order and then another 30-45 minutes before our food came out.  We waited another 15-20 minutes to get our check after we had finished eating.  This is a new location - and a Saturday night - so I'm sure they're working out the issues.   I ordered a salad and it had lots of veggies.  I thought it was going to have avocado on it, but instead it had two small globs of guacamole.  This was fine, but sliced avocado would have been better.  I got the Godiva cheese cake, but in hindsight wished I would have gotten the original or vanilla, as this was chocolate overload.  It had 3 different layers: chocolate flourless cake, chocoloate mouse and chocolate cheesecake. Shared it with another person, but we had to leave some behind...it was just too rich. Warning:  their portions are monstrous.  Most dishes, and desserts, should be shared."
Mark M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/6/2016,"Manager I originally spoke to told me to give them another shot, they're improving. So I did. Fool me once shame on you...twice shame on me.  Ordered a slice of Tiramisu Cheesecake to go. I get there and I am told they're unfortunately out of Tiramisu cheesecake, and please check the case and pick something else.  I go to the case and think I'm being punked... there's 3/4 of a cheesecake that looks like Tiramisu cheesecake. And right in front of it is a sign that says, ""Tiramisu cheesecake.""   I go back to the cashier, tell her there's a cheesecake that looks like Tiramisu, and is labeled Tiramisu. She Doesn't believe me, and looks and sees it herself. She then informs me that it ""isn't in the computer, so I can't sell it."" They informed me that the cheesecake was still frozen, and that was why it wasn't in the computer yet.  Instantly I wondered where the missing 4 slices of that 3/4 of a cheesecake went, if they too weren't in the computer.   I had no backup choice so I told her I'd take the frozen piece anyway. And the wheels of how to buy a piece of cheesecake that was in front of me, close enough to touch began to turn.  So I waited for a manager. And waited. They came up with a solution. Someone would enter just slice into the computer and then we would instantly buy it, so the rest of the frozen cheesecake didn't accidentally get sold. This process apparently is very difficult to do. In fact I got to the point where I could no longer wait for the slice to be entered into the computer. So I came up with a great solution: Sell me anything, any other slice, and just PUT a piece of the Tiramisu cheesecake in the box.  High level stuff here you know, swapping one piece of Cheesecake on an order slip for another piece. While I waited I saw another upset customer ask to speak to a manager. The manager never appeared, and after 15 minutes my swapped piece of frozen Tiramisu was ready. Not sure if the manager ever came by; I'm not entirely sure this place has *any* management actually.  To complete the act I was warned that since the cheesecake was frozen it would take a half hour to 45 minutes to thaw. I got home in 5 minutes and discovered, SHOCKINGLY, the cheesecake was not frozen at all.  ETA: I get it, this place sells cheesecake, they don't build rockets. But they really suck at selling cheesecake, thank god they don't build rockets."
