Jorge D.,"Huntington Park, CA",40,3,,1.0,12/16/2016,Was told the wait was 10 minutes....later to inquire after 30 minutes and then after an hour. The girl at the check in desk and were told we were never actually added to the list. The manager saw the whole thing and did not acknowledge what was happening.
Patty A.,"Anaheim, CA",1,11,1,5.0,5/6/2016,I love this place! Great food & friendly service; I'll be back ;) Ps; the sunset margaritas are great!
Julie P.,"Cerritos, CA",187,204,138,2.0,12/28/2015,"Since a lot of the bad reviews are about the wait time, I've decided to do a live update on my dining experience here.  12:32 - My mom got to the restaurant and requested a table for 3. Hostess said it would take 15-20 minutes  12:36 - Arrived at the restaurant with my sister. 12:48 - Got seated. 12:50 - Our waiter, Eddy, brought us our drinks and bread.  12:54 - My mom ordered the pizza/salad lunch special ($12.95), my sister ordered the lunch Luau salad ($10.95), and I ordered the lunch barbecue ranch chicken salad.  12:57 - Asked Eddy for more of the wheat bread 1:04 - Eddy totally forgot about our bread, so I ask him again. 1:10 - I'm pretty sure Eddy forgot again. Trying to track him down to ask him again for the damn bread, but he's nowhere to be found. Eddy.. Where are you? 1:14 - It has now been 10 minutes since I last asked him. Ah, I finally see him... with the bread. Only took 17 minutes but thanks.  1:20 - 26 minutes after we put in our order, we receive our food. 2.5 stars seems fitting, but I don't have the option. I would lean more towards a 2 star experience than 3 though. I don't know if the bread situation was the kitchen's fault or our waiter's, but either way, it shouldn't take that long for bread to come out. My salad was just okay. The corn and beans were undercooked (which could be a personal preference thing), and my chicken was extremely dry. Very very dry. At the end of the meal, my mom had half her mini pizza leftover, so we asked for a togo box and also one for the bread. Eddy brings us a giant pizza box. Mind you, the leftover pizza is maybe 6x3 and he brings us like a 14x14 box. We ask him for a smaller box and he only brings one when we asked him to also bring us a box for the bread. Overall my experience wasn't a pleasant one. I hope this location can pull it together."
Erin M.,"Signal Hill, CA",21,88,40,5.0,2/14/2016,Had Valentine's dinner here. It was a mad house!! But the servers and greeters handled it so well. The wait was exactly what they said it would be.  Kudos to the blonde Latina woman in the front checking everyone in! She did so good with the hundreds of people.  Our waiter was Scott. He did a phenomenal job making sure we had everything we needed & was very prompt and friendly.  Only con was my salad was small strips rather than big leafs but that's just preference. All the ppl writing bad reviews I think you have to consider this place just opened & is trying to get into the swing of things.  Keep up the good work!! Of course we will be back.
Margarita J.,"Norwalk, CA",89,154,756,1.0,2/21/2016,I hate that I had such a bad experience here and honestly it wasn't just one thing it was everything this place is new and I expected the best I love cheese cake factory the wait was horrible and the waiting area wait! What waiting area it's enough space for couple people but when there busy there's no space you feel uncomfortable even sitting there once we got seated it took so long for any one to great us and order drinks we didn't even get the complementary bread we had to ask for it we then to top it off the bread was not fresh we still ate it cause the kids were hungry we asked for more and requested the squaw bread and they said they didn't have any made but they were waiting on the fresh one so we said okay that fresh bread never made it as far as the food we ordered it was good and the waiter was okay it's the little things that go far with me but that's my opinion
Mary M.,"Bellflower, CA",1,30,2,5.0,11/19/2016,"Busy Saturday night, got here a little late and the wait was a little less than an hour. Appetizers were delish. Dinner was was great, hubby had the Rib-Eye and I had the Pasta Carbonara. And of course dessert was fabulous. Our server was the best, very efficient and friendly, thanks Sal for the great service."
Raina O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,12,2,1.0,10/15/2016,I don't even know where to start. We ordered our food from door dash and had it delivered. 1. Our side was missing from our burger... and the burger that was suppose to be well done was pink all the way through. 2. I found 4 hairs in my food. I'm so disappointed. You don't want to spend this much money on your food and have it be such bad quality
Alex V.,"Whittier, CA",1,55,,1.0,12/10/2016,Just checked in to see if reviews have gotten better for this location...Sadly they have not. still a 2.5 average! This location really needs new management seems that could give a Damn about customer service.
Chi P.,"Orange County, CA",65,213,1106,1.0,9/24/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory in at least 15 cities and I always order the same dish- chicken garlic farfalle pasta. I have never had this experience at any other CF. The pasta came out sitting in a puddle of buttery white sauce. There was no garlic to be found. It looked unappetizing and was like eating pasta drenched in oil with no flavor. I mentioned to the waiter and he took it back. He came out a few minutes later and told me that he had notified the manager who went and tasted the sauce and discovered that the ""chef"" forgot to add garlic and garlic powder and the sauce was ""all wrong"". The waiter went on to say that they have had ongoing issues with the kitchen staff. I have no idea why he told me this because it didn't make the situation any better. The rest of the meal was just as bad. The drinks were worse. To top it all off there's actually a wait for this horrible restaurant. They offered us free dessert but the pasta ruined my appetite. We left and I have no intention of ever coming back. This is one of those times when zero star should be an option."
Aiden J.,"Cerritos, CA",8,32,115,4.0,4/29/2016,"As you guys all know that they were already famous and very commercial restaurant. I visited with my wife at 3:40 ish pm. Fortunately, it was not jam-packed time for having meal, just normal crowded. A hostess seated us to a table right away  because there wasn't a line. Then, we were having some minutes for looking up what we order. These are what we ordered.. Avocado Eggrolls, Lunch special Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta, Factory burger for meal, and Margarita & Blood Orange Mojito for Drinks. For mealtime, we were there for an hour. I forgot name of the server who charged our area, he was nice and hospitable. The most important thing is taste. Avocado Eggrolls for appetizer came with Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. If one who does not like the taste of cilantro, take it out and also the sause has in it. I and my wife satisfied with the dishes except the Factory burger because they use baguette for the bun so that it was little hard to have a bite. I'd personally love chipotle style, so I usually have had the type of food. The pasta I had was pretty good. We got penny noodle for the pasta, but you can change another pasta shape noodles  as you are odering. Ah! they heated the pasta dish in order to keep it warm while you are eating. Lastly, the two drinks are not much different from other bars or restaurants, just fine though.  Total is amount of $66.38.  One tip for enjoy your time without any interupts and noisy, avoide lunch and dinner time. I hope you guys having great day with nice dishes there!"
Mario B.,"Whittier, CA",31,14,39,4.0,4/11/2016,This is my second time here in a row the food is amazing we're going to be trying out some pasta with chicken and sure it's going to be excellent
Grace K.,"La Palma, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/24/2016,Chris is a good manager who handled the situation well. Wish I could give more stars just for him but this is about the restaurant in its entirety.
Amy P.,"Long Beach, CA",28,25,29,1.0,12/18/2015,We specifically told the girl checking us in that we have a birthday girl AND I DO NOT WANT TO have to tell the waitress as that would ruin the surprise. She said no problem and typed in my daughters name.  Dinner was served. Pretty disappointing.  And lo and behold No Birthday acknowledgement. we won't be back....
Judy G.,"Lakewood, CA",8,10,4,2.0,1/1/2016,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory...however this one seems subpar compared to the other chains. The bang-bang chicken which is one of my favorites seemed to be only one bang and not much better than something I've had at a thai restaurant. Also the service is TERRIBLE. I expected the 45 minute wait at 3pm on New Years Eve, but what I did not expect was the 1 hour long wait to get the check to leave. That's right, we did not see our waitress for over an hour, we had to flag a different waitress to get the check (we also alerted the host and asked him to get our waitress, but that didn't work either) and waited 20 minutes more to get our cheesecakes to go.  I know this place opened up fairly recently, but the service staff really needs to get their act together if they want to uphold Cheesecake Factory's standards! I'd rather go to the Irvine one at this point!"
Peter P.,"Compton, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/6/2016,"I absolutely did not like the service here one bit. I had lunch with my good friend from work on a beautiful sunny California day and was treated with a cloudiness of rudeness and neglect. We walked in and asked for a patio seat, got seated. Waited for 15 minutes and then got up to order with the bartender who was courteous given the situation we were in. Once the bartender told the waiter, she said nobody had her section as if to believe nobody was waiting on patio tables even though the two tables next to us were being served with 5 star service. Seeing someone next to you getting served exceptionally and you being ignored really takes you for a toll. Why should anyone go into an establishment like cheesecake factory and except to be treated like a ghost or unwelcome? That is uncalled for and unprofessional. When we asked for our check after everyone around us had been served extra bread and even offered dessert, I flagged down the waitress and asked for the check without dessert offered and asked for the manager. Once the manager arrived we vented about the horrible service and told her about the monstrosity that just occurred. She said she ""apologized"" and will ""take the feedback into consideration"". Not surprisingly, we weren't even given a single gesture of apologies. Please do NOT go here I would give them a .1 star if I could. Service is HORRIBLE. Never again. The food was passable which is why I gave them one star. Other than that never would I recommend such a travesty of a well established and infamous restaurant chain.  -Peter"
K V.,"Long Beach, CA",3,7,11,5.0,10/22/2016,Manager and hostess have great customer service and accommodate our large party last min without reservation.
Aaliyah V.,"Whittier, CA",0,11,5,1.0,4/23/2017,"I am pretty understanding when it comes to restaurants because sh*t can be stressful but this lady should have worked as a McDonald's cashier because that's the service we got. In fact worse because they usually say hi!  We had a dirty table and booth.... Our waitress did not even introduce herself the first words she said were ""want bread while you wait"" I said yes please she had no response to my ""have a good night"" comment or hi how are you so rude!!! I have never wished I hadn't tipped until I left this cheesecake  She also let our appetizer plates stack up at the end of the table with the bread plates and so on & did not pick anything up or ask if she can take them, we had the tiny 2 person booth which should NOT (because lack of room) have a bunch of dirty dishes stacking up The wait was also too long for the service we got, 45 min  The man we handed our buzzer too was rude as well  Only good thing is food came at a decent time"
Laura K.,"San Diego, CA",143,47,15,3.0,12/31/2015,"We showed up and the line was massive.  Everyone ahead of us were being quoted 1 hr to 1 and 45 minutes, but due to our small party by the time we reached the front desk,  the wait was only 30 mins. We decided to walk the mall quickly and came back after about 15 minutes. When we arrived our pager was surprisingly alerting our table was ready. Our server was friendly, but rushed. We will be back.  I would suggest to be prepared to arrive early due to the growing popularity and possible wait times. Update: unfortunately I had to remove 1 star rating since after the review was posted, server never asked once to refill our drinks and it took an additional 20 mins just to get the check. I love this restaurant still, but lesson learned to only go if you are in absolute no hurry to leave quickly."
Monica F.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,188,131,5.0,8/9/2016,"Of course it's going to  be  packed full of people during the weekend. This location is still new. I'm not being sarcastic. I've visited the other locations. This one I decided to try since it's adjacent to my fav. Mall. We went on a Sunday evening. 2 adults the wait was 30 min. We bypass the wait by just dining at the bar. Bartender was nice and ordered our meals in a snap. Ambience was very lively. We watched some Olympics on tv. My fav.  Dish: herb crusted salmon was perfect! Perfectly cooked and the mash potatoes were great. My husband ordered the Thai salmon he wasn't a fan. The green sauce that was placed over the white rice tasted wierd. Maybe a hint of wasabi? Anyways, the dish wasn't for him. Can't wait to stop by for brunch & try their brunch menu. Until next time."
Mende H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,12/8/2015,"We decided to try here for dinner believing that they had been open enough time to get the kinks out. We were wrong. The hostess staff were extremely rude, and we had to be re-seated three times. My husband ordered fettuccine Alfredo, which had no flavor what so ever. We had to ask for Parmesan cheese, which helped flavor it a little. His meal came out 5 minutes before mine! I ordered the chicken tortilla soup. It had no chicken in it, and the corn inside was still frozen. They ran out of bread for the restaurant, and it took forever to get refills on our iced tea. We will never return!"
