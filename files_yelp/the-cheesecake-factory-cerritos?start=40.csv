Esther Y.,"Buena Park, CA",99,381,1111,3.0,4/24/2017,"I sat outside for dinner and it was too dark, I could barely see what I was eating. My server wasn't too attentive, but she was nice at least. I got the... 1. Barbecue ranch chicken salad ($14.95): this is my go to salad at cheesecake. I think it's one of the best salad dishes they have. It has avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber, and romaine all tossed with BBQ ranch dressing. Topped with lots of crispy fried onion strings for crunch.  2. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta ($16.95): it was surprisingly smaller than the other plates cheesecake serves. This has honey glazed chicken, asparagus, red and yellow peppers, peas, garlic and onion in a spicy chipotle Parmesan cream sauce. I didn't like how creamy it was, and it was way too salty.  3. Fried calamari ($11.95): just some average calamari. Fried light and crisp. Served with garlic dip and Cocktail sauce."
Jimmy S.,"Cerritos, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/6/2018,They don't take phone reservation on the weekends  so basically you have to go there and wait 1.5 hours. I don't understand what is so special about this place that ppl are willing to wait that long. Please go somewhere else as this place is over hyped.
Rachael F.,"Marina del Rey, CA",4,65,40,3.0,5/28/2017,"Mediocre.  I've not eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in over 10 years besides running by to get a Cheesecake to go. I would also add a piece of chocolate cake costs $9.25! (Redondo Beach location) Seriously? When did this happen? I thought this was the type of place that was somewhat affordable.  Moving on, I'm not going to complain about the wait bc this place is known to be busy. Good for them. We arrived early bc they don't take reservations on the weekends. No problem, 45 minute wait, we walked the mall. Don't come here and not expect a wait. It's been like this for over 20 plus years.  6 of us ate here and ordered drinks too. The alcoholic beverages were super weak. The first vodka and 7 up was flat (no carbonation) and sent back.  I ordered the fresh vegetable salad...the radicchio ratio to lettuce made this a bitter salad. Will not order this again.  My BF ordered the buffalo blast and it was huge portion. He enjoyed it but it was basically fried chicken. He ran out of dipping sauce and needed more which was a challenge.  We also ordered the shrimp scampi which was good and the veggie burger which was dry and came without condiments. We waited 20 min for the server to come back to get the condiments. Basically a mediocre place that's kind of pricey these days. The only saving grace is its huge menu and proximity to the theater. Also, bc there is always a wait you can walk around the mall to waste time.  No more than average."
R S.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,70,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Had a reservation for a table for 9 at 11am. Our whole party arrived by 10:55. We were told we could not be seated until the server for our section arrived to work. We wait. It's now after 11am, and lots of other people are walking in and being seated. We are told again that we cannot be seated because our server has not arrived to work yet. How the heck is that OUR problem? The customers have nothing to do with your employee tardiness and should not be made to wait for such a nonsensical reason. The service has been terrible at this location since it opened and today was the last straw."
Angelique J.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,95,158,4.0,5/20/2017,"It was my first time trying their Buffalo Blast, and it was so delicious I had to order one to-go. I went with my boyfriend and his family and the over all experience was not all that bad. We didn't have to wait that long and the service was good. For dessert, I thought I'd mix it up and not order cheesecake like I always do, I tried their tower truffle cake and it was so creamy and not at all overwhelming to eat. I plan on going back with my boyfriend soon!"
Cheryl C.,"Long Beach, CA",19,9,36,3.0,12/10/2017,This was my first time at the Cerritos location. I'm giving this Cheesecake Factory three stars only because my drink was good (Whiskey Lemon Thyme Martini) and the service was great. I always order the 1/2 Chicken Madeira 1/2 Shrimp Scampi whenever I go to the Cheesecake Factory. The sauce was too sweet and the cheese was barely there. The mashed potatoes had some potatoes that were not done.
Benny M.,"La Palma, CA",0,19,4,1.0,12/2/2017,I hate the fact that my wife likes the food here and we have to put up with the long wait and crappy service.. to make it even worse they try and pack this place with seating so close to each other your literally rubbing elbows with the person next to you.
Muhammad K.,"Brea, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/16/2017,This was my worst service experience ever!! If you want better service DO NOT GO to this location! Manager Name: Sarah not a big help either useless!
David C.,"Lakewood, CA",37,20,1,2.0,12/8/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for my anniversary and the service was horrible, the food was not good either. It's sad to see a restaurant not live up to its reputation. My wife and I used to frequent the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena and what a difference. I now see why this place has such low reviews. Fortunately this place banks on its reputation with other restaurants. I don't think we will be going to this place again!"
Gurpreet M.,"San Jose, CA",52,8,9,5.0,9/3/2017,"Typically, I come here for my personal favorites: Avocado Eggrolls and the Crusted Chicken Romano!  My girlfriend and I came by for a late lunch around 3PM and ordered the Avocado Eggrolls, Tomato Basil Pasta, and Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. Thought I'd try something slightly different from the chicken romano, but had trouble deviating away from it because I really enjoy the breaded chicken served by the Cheesecake Factory! We are unable to recall our server's name, but would like to thank her for the great service! Towards the end our meal, the server mentioned that our bill would be completely covered by CF because of any inconveniences related to the long wait time. However, we did not experience any such issues and will definitely swing by again! Again, we would like to thank our server for the great service!"
Yuri K.,"Torrance, CA",1585,352,4663,3.0,9/7/2016,"~~~Happy Birthday, Irene!!~~~ ~~~3.75 star rating from 3.0~~~ The birthday girl chose this restaurant to celebrate her ""21st"" birthday. It took me a while to find a parking spot shared by other establishments at Cerritos Mall. When I got there, two of my friends mentioned the crappy attitude our waitress was giving them, especially towards the birthday girl. The only reason I could think of for such attitude was because we were a party of 10, most of us arrived late. It was very difficult to find parking here. I had to idle my car, while waiting and hoping someone would walk towards their car from the mall near me.  Service seemed slow in the beginning. After our food arrived, we all took pictures of our dishes. We noticed a complete change in service afterwards. The waitress and staff members were more attentive to our needs. They came around often to check up on us, refilled our drinks, took our dessert order, brought the birthday girl her treat and sang the happy birthday song with us.  We ordered a few appetizers (avocado egg rolls, battered fried shrimps, spring rolls), a couple of superfood salads, several pasta dishes (jambalaya, chicken/mushroom, herb-crusted chicken), salmon, pork chop, and Cuban sandwich. Of course, we ordered an assortment of sliced cheesecakes. We didn't have any complaints with what we ordered. In fact, I enjoyed my salad here, I made a trip to their Redondo Beach location couple weeks later.  If you ever decide to come out to this location, remember to bust out your phone or camera and take those foodie pics for great service! Good luck in finding parking! I'll continue to make my way over to their Redondo Beach location whenever I'm craving one of their superfood salads or cheesecake."
Josephine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,425,1832,4.0,9/10/2016,"I came here for evening dinner on Thursday night with family and it was easy to find the place. We didn't wait to long for a table. Our waiter, Felipe C. was friendly and good on refills. All of us were hungry so we snacked on complementary bread. The food came arrived just in time and I gobbled up on chicken Bellagio pasta and refills on passion fruit  ice tea.  Parking was hard to find so park at dicks sporting good area."
Laurena C.,"Cypress, CA",15,49,7,5.0,12/8/2017,"We like to come to dinner here before seeing a movie at Harkins right next door! great location, although parking sucks! the food is good and the servers have always been nice."
Hiba M.,"Long Beach, CA",3,22,7,2.0,9/16/2017,"Service here is sloooooowwwww! I waited 15 mins to be seated and then another 15 min for my server to show up, despite that fact that i told them i was ready to order the min. I sat down! Its not even a weekend.. My table looked clean, but staring at it for 15 mins (while waiting for my server), i saw all the little tiny pieces of left over food that wasnt wiped. 3+ months later .. i found this incomplete review in my drafts) all i can remember now is that the food sucked too!    This place is soooooo OVERRATED!"
Martin V.,"Norwalk, CA",108,25,6,1.0,12/2/2017,Probably one of the worst experiences in a restaurant. First they tell us the wait is 2 hours okay no problem we had a birthday and that's where she wanted to eat. So we wait check in at 1 hr still nothing we wait we see other customers that came before get called in we go and complain we wait another hour time for us to go in right.. NOPE we still waited another 30 min before they sat us. After that we order a cheesecake in the front we were starving we sit and the rude manager comes and tells us why didn't we pay In the front we get into it then he leaves. After all that the food tasted horrible no flavor I'm sure the manager told the kitchen to hurry the food worst experience ever lack of customer service specially in a restaurant.. beware go to the one in Anaheim worth the drive..
Mariah R.,"Chino, CA",14,22,,5.0,10/3/2017,"I came in here a few weeks ago with my friend for lunch and although this place is very busy I have to say that the service was SUPERB and TOP NOTCH. My server Anthony A. (very tall and super sweet) was not only knowledgeable about the menu but it was clear that he wanted to make our experience great from the beginning. I hadn't eaten at Cheesecake Factory in years and he recommended various seafood pastas. He would check on us and always made sure that our iced teas were filled to the brim.  Servers like Anthony A. are what makes me want to go out to eat in the first place. I really hope this server gets some recognition from this review, Cheesecake Factory has a very solid employee and I will forever request him when I come here to eat!"
Ursula P.,"Long Beach, CA",150,5,1,1.0,11/15/2017,"I was there at lunch for 2. The host (some white chick w/ tattoos and horrible eyebrows) told us to stand by the side and that our table would be ready in 5 mins. As we did, customers were coming in and they were getting seated FIRST with the same party of 2. After she seated them, I told her that we were here first. She looked at a receipt and tried to play it off and told us ""oh yeah, I'm going to seat you now"" I was already annoyed by her face and terrible customer service. Usually hosts are friendly and welcoming, this ONE host was a shit show and completely incompetent.  Been to this location 3 times and within those 3 times, it has been a terrible experience.  Other than that, our waiter (Jacklyn) was friendly. She apologized about how the food was taking long and she offered a complimentary soup. Thank you to her for making the experience a bit tolerable."
Dwight E.,"North Hollywood, Universal City, CA",45,2,,4.0,1/4/2018,My 1st time going to the Cheesecake Factory and the food was amazing and the service was great!
Judee B.,"Long Beach, CA",57,3,6,1.0,4/2/2017,"We enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately tonight's food was a bitter disappointment, literally. The boyfriend and I both ordered pasta dishes. And both had burnt sausage, pepperoni, and bacon in our pasta. It was like the cook scraped the bottom of the pan and put it in with our sauce. We complained to our waiter (Victor) and the manager and they both were very understanding and apologetic about the food."
Ana A.,"Bellflower, CA",0,10,2,5.0,8/5/2017,"Every cheesecake location I have gone to have a really long wait especially for larger parties. I don't understand why people here get upset because the wait is long, it's cheesecake people! If you come plan on waiting for a while if you go on a busy day. If you go on a light day you get seated super fast.  We've visited this location many times since it's opened and we love it! Everyone is always very courteous and helpful. I always see all the employees trying their best and moving quickly. I've never had any bad experiences here and I love it!  For those people who don't like the wait maybe opt out for a different kind of restaurant but around my home town any restaurant will make you wait around an hour or two. So it being cheesecake yeah I'll wait :)  Great job to the cerritos location! I believe you guys are doing your best!"
