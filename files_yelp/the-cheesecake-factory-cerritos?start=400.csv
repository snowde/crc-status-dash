Ashley R.,"South Gate, CA",1,57,28,1.0,12/29/2015,First time coming here in general and never again. Came in around 1:30 pm on a Tuesday it was packed we waited finally to get seated and another long wait the place is nice however the service and food are horrible. My fiance ordered the grill steak medium rare and came burnt also ordered a side of asparagus which came all mushy .. my son had the roadside sliders with fruit all his fruit tasted like chopped onion!!! Never coming back has to be the worst experience ever.
Sarah P.,"Bellflower, CA",3,34,,1.0,12/30/2015,"if I could give this one a 0, I would!! my second bad review. FIRST time to this cerritos one. WORST restaurant experience probably ever. don't plan to come back. I don't even know why they're so busy and packed when they're service is so poor. why??? reasons below:  1. for a mon night it was super packed. there was a HUGE line JUST to put your name in.  2. for a party of 4 (including myself), we waited for over an hour to be seated  3. we even had to wait a few minutes when our buzzer went off before we could even get seated! (aren't you supposed to be seated right away once it goes off?!)  4. we waited for at LEAST 10 minutes before i had to flag a server down to tell them NO server had greeted us to ask what we would like to drink (like ALL normal eateries do).  5. not to mention the waiter who finally came to us was already helping the table to the right of us, left of us AND in front of us.  6. our waters came with no straws. so I had to ask a different waiter (once again) to bring us straws.  7. our bread finally came another 20 min or so later AFTER we got seated. 8. there was a couple to the left of us who came in AFTER we got seated. they got their bread and water BEFORE we did earlier. they ALSO got their food AFTER we had already ordered. so two plates of food were served before ANY of us 4 got our plates. (rather ridiculous)  9. I got so full from the bread, I only ate half my meal when it FINALLY came out! (another 20-30 min wait for just our food)  10. another waiter came by to take over and was hardly attentive to us. she came maybe once to ask if we were ok. (she was so fake and insincere)  11. she boxed our food and never brought it back till I had to flag (yet again!) ANOTHER waiter down to ask for it 12. the waiter even asked if we had room for dessert. we reply no. then she says: ""how do you come to Cheesecake Factory and NOT get cheesecake?!"" my response: ""well if our food didn't take so long and I wasn't so full from the bread because of the wait, I probably would've had room for some.""  13. for having at least 50+ waiters on the floor, you would THINK they would be a bit more attentive  so there ya go. 13 reasons tonight why I'm never coming back. although this IS the closest cf to me, I would gladly drive farther to the brea or grove one for better service, better food, and a better atmosphere."
Jason R.,"Lakewood, CA",35,3,2,1.0,11/16/2015,"I have come to this Cheesecake Factory 4 times now. Each time I'm seated, I waited an average of 12 minutes just to find out who our server was.  It's really hard to keep your cool when you see multiple servers passing by your table and you can't even get a cup of water.  Get it together Cerritos Cheesecake Factory!"
Tiffany H.,"Lakewood, CA",1,8,2,3.0,2/21/2016,"Hour wait time but more than 4 booths open on back patio where mall is and more than 3 booths open on front patio where you park! They have booths that seat 10 with 2 people seared!!!  I reason to have anyone waiting this long! Figured we would try to eat on site since the last time I ordered from here my scampi was made incorrectly, spicy sauce that wasn't even good. Don't know if I even want to wait to se if the food will be good. I will start going back to HB, Anaheim, Brea, and Redondo! Okay so we sat in spot that had so many open booths, thanks to my husband that kept asking why the wait was long when seas are open.  I'm adding a star ONLY because our server, Melissa, was amazing. I noticed her busing her own tables, which surprised me since she took our order, brought our drinks, and checked on our table consistently.  All of our burgers were good along with the three cheese pasta.  They really need to do better at seating their customers. Walk around, look at party numbers and seat people accordingly. Don't leave stations open when you have servers available."
Laura O.,"Whittier, CA",54,283,134,3.0,3/9/2016,"Just another typical super over priced restaurant. I came here on a Friday, night, and a party of two! (Yes, even that was original) The wait was around one hour and the place has chairs set up outside for people to wait. You can choose to sit in the bar, outside patio or inside the restaurant. Once called, you go back to the hostess desk and wait for your waiter. We were seated in the patio next to a small waterfall fountain. If you want bread you have to ask to receive it. The bread was too hard and not enjoyable. We ordered the chicken five cheese pasta and the fried shrimp platter. Both plates were eye popping not for the taste but for the $20 price tag on each... yikes! The food itself was just ok, nothing extraordinary. The cheesecakes we ordered were good. One was the strawberry cheesecake and the other was the dulce de leche cheesecake. So overall expect to bring in Friday's paycheck because the bill will make you think yikes!"
Kristina A.,"Artesia, CA",259,16,11,4.0,12/13/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night around 830. We waited only 10-20 mins to be seated in their outside patio (we asked for 1st available). It had a great ambience and was well heated which was nice since it was a pretty cold night. Our server was really friendly. She took our drink order fairly quick and offered/provided free bread. Cheesecake Factory has a very overwhelming menu which is something I was already aware of. We decided to share an egg roll sampler that included 4 different types of egg rolls/sauces. Then we decided on 2 different pastas (I forget both the names; his was a chipotle kind and mine had chicken and mushrooms) as our entrees. They were delicious and came in generous portions but by the time we had our pasta we were already pretty full off the egg rolls and bread, so we had a lot of leftovers.  Of course we couldn't leave without ordering a cheesecake. We tried the cookie dough one, which definitely had a lot of cookie dough (and a lot of whipped cream) not my favorite but still good. Overall: - great experience with our server and enjoyed some really good food. I would go again sometime in the future."
Steven D.,"Artesia, CA",395,81,45,5.0,9/20/2016,"I was a little hesitant about eating here from all the bad reviews but I was pleasantly surprised by the superior service I received from JAMES. My family and I (Party of 5) visited the establishment on a Monday night and got seated within a few minutes. Our server was on top of his game. He didn't even write any of our food order down but he got everything right even with substitutes and always made sure that we were taken care and drinks were full.  The food was delicious, I was honestly expecting worse but it did not disappoint. My whole party loved the food and it was well cooked. JAMES was awesome and doesn't hurt that he was easy on the eyes. I smell a promotion in his future! Thank you for a great experience!"
Heidi R.,"Signal Hill, CA",2,12,1,5.0,3/28/2017,"Jennifer S. was amazing! My Fiancé and I can get a bit challenging when ordering and she was so patient and had such an amazing personality. We came in at the end of the night and she still was full of enthusiasm-- so refreshing! She had us laughing the entire night!! The food could've came out ice cold and we still would've walked out with huge smiles, thanks again Jennifer you're the BEST!"
Jonathan P.,"Signal Hill, CA",204,22,2,1.0,11/3/2015,"This beautiful location had so much potential to be a great dining experience. It had the standard decor as seen at all other cheesecake factories. Pleasant, modern Tuscan. The first issues started with our waiter who seemed sarcastically rude the entire time.  I won't share any names because maybe he was just having a tough grand opening and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. The bread came to our table cold and quite infrequently.  There was no problem with our drinks but the food felt like it took awhile and the waiter didn't give us any update as to why the food was taking awhile. When the food finally came, it looked great. Unfortunately only half our table was served. The rest of the food didn't come out until 15min later and one of our friends didn't get their food until 10mim after that. Prior to their food coming out came the biggest issue of all. I subbed out the fries that came with the rib eye steak with Mac and cheese. It looked great. 3 bites into the Mac, I bit down on a broken piece of plate. Might have chipped my tooth. They offered to file a report with corporate. Depending on how my mouth feels in the next week, I may come back to speak with Kelly, the manager. She was perfect in her accommodations and hospitality. I was comp'ed for my steak and they gave me a free slice of cheesecake. I appreciated that. But the waiter kept throwing his rude behavior at us, even as we were paying the check. Making this dining experience quite unpleasant. He even mixed up all the take out boxes."
Maysah F.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,140,14,1.0,9/25/2016,"The worst ABSOLUTE worst cheesecake factory I have ever been to. James Fraser has to be the worst General Manager, no wonder the place has so many negative reviews. Our food took 50 minutes to arrive, his waiter lied about the whole situation and he took her side instead of realizing that she messed up our order and put it in 30 minutes after we requested it. Are you guys for real?!!! What a joke this place is. I am reporting you guys to corporate. McDonald's probably has better service than this dumpster and the employees they have running it. You guys are rude, and know nothing about customer service and keeping your customers happy. I can't wait to tell corporate about this. Made us wait an hour to eat and when we complained starting coming up with excuses. You  guys are pathetic!"
Luis C.,"Whittier, CA",84,74,10,3.0,2/22/2016,"We stopped in for Sunday Brunch, which was a huge mistake. We first got in line to put our names down for a table. We were told it would be 30 mins and were asked to come back in 15 mins for a beeper. So I got back in line after 15 mins to get our beeper, that was excruciating. I then was given our beeper and told it would be another 30 mins. The beeper went off after 45 mins and were asked to get in yet another line to be seated, this took another 15 mins. I'm not even counting the 20 mins we drive around to find parking. So if you're into lines and have time to wait for a table, by all means come eat here!! We finally were seated and our server was very attentive and the food is always delicious! Can't go wrong eating here and pretty much anything you order will be good."
Angela M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Long story short our order was not correct. It took forever for our waitress to come around in order to tell her. By then the food was cold. Instead of attending to it right away, she turned around and took someone else's order. I asked that the one item made incorrectly be comped. The manager told us they wouldn't do that, but would make a new plate. We had already waited a long time for the original meal and couldn't wait another hour. Their food is expensive and it should be made as the menu says or fix the problem in a way that is agreeable to the customer."
Reinald R.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",1,6,2,2.0,11/21/2015,"The other reviews are right, the service here is painfully slow. While the food taste and quality is up to par with the other cheesecake factories, it took us 3 hours to get in and out on a Saturday during lunch while the restaurant was not full.  We wanted to get cheesecake at the end of our meal but we didn't want to take the chance of waiting another hour to get it."
Monica C.,"Long Beach, CA",107,32,153,3.0,12/9/2015,"I struggled how to rate this place because there is some bad things and good things. I had called to make reservations a week in advance, the person on the phone said they don't take reservations. I questioned her opinion on the bad reviews on yelp (I can understand and sympathize with them, when a new restaurant opens the cooks, chefs, wait staff are all NEW to everything, I think the public should be more understanding and patient. Honestly, they are lucky I understand bc anybody else would have had a fit what I endured yesterday on my birthday dinner.  My sister and I arrived early before my guests to get a table. We were told that it will be a few minutes, they'll give me an estimated time. Great, I will be at the bar. Mike was suppose to tell me how long it was going to be, (possibly manager) he told me he was new about 4 days. While I sipped my Pinot Grigio that Jenny served me (excellent bar tender, Tony is also fantastic, they work alongside & compliment each other) mike was walking by the bar, I'm thinking there he is, he's going to tell me how long the wait is but he was just walking along the bar to the kitchen. Uh oh, I must of been forgotten. My guests arrived after trying to FiND the restaurant around the big mall, I got lost myself...they were surprised there was no table yet. We arrived about 6:45pm, got seated at 8:20pm or so... An hour passes and nothing, mind you I'm at the bar with my boyfriend and so is my sister with our friend so we didn't mind so much but my grandma and mother were already wanting to leave....They told me the people had boxes to go, and paid but were camping out talking and weren't leaving. He was nice enough to give me a banana bc they were out of bread to give to my elderly grandmother who has diabetes, I was worried for her...So we waited and waited until the thing buzzed.  We were approached right away by Kevin, great server, boxed our food to go and all. I ordered three appetizers: stuffed mushrooms which looked a bit sad and small, ate them bc we were starving, ordered the sweet con tamale cakes, everyone loved them, and asked what appetizer he recommends, avocado egg roll, this one didn't make it to the table, wonder if he wrote down my third choice. They were out of calimari. Nooooo! My bf did ask if we had another appetizer coming, I forgot to inquire about it after conversing, and opening presents and him talking my ear out of his lovely thoughts about things.. We start ordering, I ordered the chicken chipotle pasta, it wasnt as as spicy as I wanted it to be but delicious, different noodles would have satisfied me though instead of a penne, it had a nice crunchy texture w the tortilla strips they embellish it with. The bf ordered the guacamole salad, it was spicy for him. My friend ordered bbq ranch chicken salad, he likes it. It had black beans and avocado, I tried it, it was tasty. My mother had herb crusted salmon, she was pleased but it tasted a bit fishy for me but still good. My sister enjoyed her grilled steak medallions, the mash potato were creamy. My nephew sat quietly while eating his spaghetti and meatballs, I asked if it was good and he nodded yet digging in.  Kevin was attentive at all times, refilling, we didn't have to ask for anything. Bread was suffice for everyone, nice and hot. We tipped 28%. They work hard and have to put up with moody people, luckily we were understanding, well half of us. They brought a cheesecake with a shot of a sundae but had forgot to ask about it on the bill, I was charged for an original cheesecake. We usually order dessert but the big portions filled us up.  Again, we are conversing and my bf knows how to distract me. For 11 people it was $237.67 we tipped $60. It's not the servers fault when there's a wait. Don't take it out on them. It helps that the food is good. The wait is awful but if it's packed it's a good indication something is right."
Jessica M.,"Compton, CA",64,34,38,1.0,12/31/2015,I've been here 3 times now and each time their is an inconsistency in food preparation. But seriously c'mon. By the time I got my soup my pasta was at my table and it was cold. The appetizer never even made it to the table. I only had a cup of hot tea and a slice of bread this visit. By the time our waiter came my bf had finished his meal. So I left without having my dinner. What a disappointment. I expected better service from a place like this. The westminster  location is 1000 times better. At least they know how to follow a recipe and have your food come out within a reasonable time before your main dish is served. Oh and it's taken 15 min to get our bill and another 5min to pay.
Vee R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,6,4.0,5/18/2017,I went on a Saturday there were tons of people I had to wait like two hours to be seated. But the food was so delicious.
Jay T.,"Irvine, CA",132,382,56,1.0,1/23/2016,"Just don't even bother. 6pm on a Sat, the line to just put your name in is insane. The company's insane policy denying reservations is ridiculous"
Crystal D.,"Long Beach, CA",2,15,,5.0,9/18/2016,"We arrived at 10 am for Sunday brunch. No wait since they were just opening. Our server was attentive & friendly. We shared the Crab Hash and Lemon Ricotta pancakes, both were very good. We would definitely recommend."
Asmaa H.,"Oakville, Canada",5,97,20,1.0,9/9/2016,I came here for a quick bite with my spouse yesterday to receive horrendously inattentive and slow service. My meal was returned because I was given a product in it which I was allergic to and advise the waitress of this prior to ordering. We had to pay for both ordered items even though only one was consumed.
Alyson Q.,"Cerritos, CA",258,30,20,3.0,9/1/2016,"This is a pretty average place to eat. Honestly not a huge fan of this chain anyways but decided to give it a chance because my grandparents had a gift card. I got the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle mayo. Honestly the chicken sandwich itself tasted like it was from Chik-fil-a and the mayo wasn't spicy at all. It was still good enough to eat but I didn't appreciate having to pay that much for a sandwich. The cheesecake, however, was AMAZING. I forgot which one I got but it had Nutella and it was soooooo good. Service was pretty meh. Our server was so cool and funny but the people who gave the food were rude. Also the bathroom was messy with trash on the floor and diapers overfilling the trash can. Probably won't come back because it's too expensive for the quality of the food"
