Marla S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,3,1.0,1/15/2016,"I came during dinner time, ordered a delicious omelette with no onions. 30 minutes later, the manager comes out to apologize for the long wait time. She said the night cooks don't know how to make breakfast food. No biggie. Maybe they were trying to figure out how to crack the eggs. Understandable. My omelette came out looking like an overcooked pancake with vegetables thrown inside. Still no biggie. I bite into it....no onions, awesome! But wait.... There's also no cheese.  -_____- A Disgrace to  Omelettes  Everywhere I'll still go back. But maybe just during breakfast time. Their Omelettes are so good!"
Elizabeth N.,"Lakewood, CA",4,29,7,4.0,11/9/2015,"Never been to this restaurant before, so it was a real treat for my 5 year anniversary with the boyfriend. My first impression was that the main entrance was poorly designed and you had to push past a crowed of people waiting to buy a cheesecake to-go just to get to the reception desk. Once you were checked in, there is no where to sit since the seat are back past the crowed of cheesecake buyers and the receptionist asks you to 'step to the side' by the wall and wait while for a waiter to come get you. But to be fair, this place just opened up and most of the staff are rushing around to get everyone seated. Very crowded. Though, we were not given the option of sitting inside since they automatically took us outside. Which isn't outside, but in the hallway of the mall where people walk by from store to store.  :c The only thing that save this experience so far was the friendly staff, good food and great cheesecake. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, so darn good and had a large potion left over for another meal. Doesn't seem to pricey when you get so much food. It was a little slow to get the bill in the end but all in all, I will be coming back. Maybe once the holidays are over."
Ashley L.,"Pico Rivera, CA",22,8,3,2.0,3/13/2017,"I've come here a few times now and I've had pretty good service, but tonight was different. My friend and I ordered drinks and they didn't taste right at all after a few sips. We told our server they weren't right and he took them back. VICTOR was super nice about it. We weren't trying to get anything free(and we didn't) we just wanted the drinks we wanted in the first place. When the manager PETER got involved it went downhill. He came up to our table and said ""So you guys said you're drinks were wrong? Our bartender has been making drinks for 15-20 years and he knows what he's doing. You're going to get the same drinks remade that you had before he didn't mess up.""  I tried to explain to him that I ordered a passion fruit mojito and I was brought a normal one, so it obviously wasn't correct. He didn't listen to me he just told me again that it will be the same. He could've just told us ""I'm sorry that the drinks were wrong we'll bring you the correct drinks right away."" Instead he made me feel stupid and uncomfortable for saying anything and that's not right. Don't give me a lecture saying I'm wrong especially when I'm being polite and not making a scene or anything. I'm very sad about how PETER acted towards us. I hope I never have to deal with him again. VICTOR on the other hand was super sweet and saved the night by making us feel better about the situation. You go VICTOR (:"
Catherine R.,"Downey, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/10/2017,Worst experience I've had at this restaurant and will be the last. The company states it holds a high standard of service yet fail to provide any customer service the first 15 minutes we sat down. No water or server to be found. In conclusion wouldn't come back again. My time is too important to be waiting 15 minutes before I have to get up and ask for any service.
marina s.,"Cerritos, CA",162,29,5,4.0,9/4/2016,It's the Cheesecake Factory. If you've been to one then you've been to all of them. 4 stars simply because there is ALWAYS a wait....even a 9pm on a Thursday.
Char H.,"Norwalk, CA",236,23,2,1.0,7/26/2016,"Mediocre at best. This place has gone downhill. I dined here the other day and spend over 100 dollars. I'm so disappointed. My noodles were soggyX and overlooked. My sauce taste like it had sugar in it. Also my friend ordered the steak Diane, overcooked it. My drinks were good. However I just really don't know how this place got to be so good before yet quality went down."
Juliet S.,"Long Beach, CA",53,141,71,5.0,11/30/2015,"Came here on Sunday for lunch for my grandmas birthday. It was pretty empty so they seated our table of 11 people in 5 minutes.  We had the pleasure of having Myesha as our waitress! Friendly, funny and even repeated our entire order to make sure she got it rite. My entire family loved her because she was practicing her Spanish with grams haha  All of our food came out perfect and yummy! I swear every time we have this big group together someone's order always comes out wrong and it was so nice to have it done properly.  I got the southwest chicken sandwich with a salad and that addicting spicy peanut dressing. Sooo good! I've had lots of their pastas in the past which are also amazing.  In the end they brought out her bday sundae and sang happy birthday.  Overall great experience and next time I come in I'm asking to sit in Myeshas section if she's working."
Erik H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,5.0,12/30/2015,"Let me just say, my family and I came here when this store first opened and had a horrible experience. The wait was long, the service was slow, and the food came out in 40+ minutes.  Needless to say, my family came in again tonight. The wait was over an hour, it was busy for a Tuesday night so that was a bummer but whatever.  This update is for our waiter James. He was extremely knowledgeable about the food, ingredients, and his recommendations were on point. He was honest about what's good and what's better. I never had to ask for a refill nor did my family have to ask, James knew what we needed. That to me was impressive. What stuck out to me most was at the end of the meal when James offered us desert, I said no, as He was walking away my son said he wanted ice cream. When James came back he brought a little ball of ice cream for my son, how did he hear him idk but We will be coming back because of the experience We received tonight from our waiter. Also the food was better then last time."
Evy G.,"Long Beach, CA",49,1,,1.0,1/11/2016,"Horrible service and subpar quality-hands down one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time.... On a busy Sunday evening, I wasn't surprised by the wait (60-90) minutes, but the wait turned into 2 hours PLUS an additional 25 minutes after our pager went off just to be seated. I actually had to speak to a manager just to get us seated at that point. We ordered 2 large Caesar salads as appetizers which arrived AFTER our main courses-we sent those back since our main dishes were already there. Two of our orders were wrong and needed to be remade, one of those dishes didn't arrive until most of us were already done with our meals. When the bill arrived, it included the appetizers that had been sent back and we had been charged twice for the meal that needed to be remade! I've been dining at the Hermosa Beach location for over 20 years and have always been impressed by the amazing quality of their food & exceptional service...you have completely missed that ball Cerritos!"
Tanaya G.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,27,7,5.0,10/29/2015,"I came to the newest Cheesecake Factory for their soft opening, and was met with super hospitable, friendly service and a tour of the restaurant. The staff was training, but did an a great job with our food. They officially open for business on 11/3/15 so come check it out. They're eager to please and the food is on point! Thai lettuce wraps are amazing, as well as the tuna tataki salad... and I've never met a cheesecake I don't like here!"
Sonia Q.,"San Diego, CA",47,53,12,2.0,6/21/2016,"Nice location in Cerritos. Right next to movie theatre but I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and I'm not sure if this was because it was a fairly new location or what but the service could have been a little better. We sat in the bar area open seating, sat down and waited about 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us at all. The place didn't appear to be too busy it was about 9p on Saturday night. Anyways, the drinks took long, we never got the bread until after I asked for it which by the time we did get it we had our entrees already. Food was good as usual but the server just wasn't very attentive. Will probably give it another try some other day but for today I think it could have been better."
Kisha A.,"Signal Hill, CA",0,10,2,1.0,12/20/2015,"The service here is horrible! very slow! Long wait to be seated as well as to get your food! The waitress was slow and didnt check on us not once..This happened 3 times, Won't be returning.. The food was just ok Get it together Cheesecake Factory Cerritos!"
Priya D.,"Cerritos, CA",0,20,,4.0,4/14/2017,Went there a couple of times this week. Love the cheesecakes and the ambiance. Service is great and portion sizes are pretty big. They have lots of options but some items are on the sweeter side than I like. Great happy hour.
Evelyn P.,"Cerritos, CA",33,33,4,2.0,12/8/2015,"We were excited to try the new addition to our mall, we love to eat out. We had a party of 5. The waiting time was quite a bit which was expected for dinner and being fairly new. We waited for about 35-40 minutes at around 6pm.  We got seated on a table for 4 and they added a chair at the end which was kinda uncomfortable since the servers and people kept passing by to get to their tables...we asked if we could get moved to a bigger table bit of course they said they didn't have any available and this was the standard. We were all really hungry so we decided to make the best of it.  We ordered our food and drinks from one server who kept forgetting to bring what we asked for, then he said we got a new server, she was pretty nice. You could tell they were overwhelmed, all servers where all over the place and since we were near the kitchen you could see a lot of servers standing around not actually doing anything..so that was confusing. It made sense why our food took FOREVER to come out. Again the sodas kept getting forgotten to get refilled after asked for. There was a whole restaurant blackout in the beginning of our dinner but luckily the server said our order went in before the blackout.  All in all, the food was good...as expected, no complaint there. The service and waiting time was the problem. At the end we wanted to order dessert but were scared that it would take 20 minutes just to get a piece of cheesecake since this is how long it took to get the check after we asked for it.  We gave our comments to the server who actually went to tell the manager because he came to our table to check before we left. He gave us a complimentary slice of cheesecake. That was nice but two and a half hours later we were our of there. Felt that more than half of the time there we were sitting around waiting for something... I hope management takes training into consideration and getting staff more organized for better service."
Agnes S.,"Artesia, CA",17,1,,2.0,1/30/2016,It took 45 minutes to serve our order and the quality of the food is not even close to the ones served at other locations. Ordered an omelette and it came almost floating in oil. It was like a soggy toast. My wife ordered a sandwich served without garnish and taste was bland. This place need to get their act together else they  will destroy Cheesecake Factory's reputation.
Shareiss S.,"Cerritos, CA",4,22,14,5.0,7/20/2016,"Kudos to Cheesecake Factory and their take on the classic cobb salad! Their version is a vegan cobb salad which includes a spring mix topped with garbanzo beans, cucumbers, green beans, avocado, grilled beets and asparagus,  tomatoes, sunflower seeds and almonds. The salad also includes quinoa,  but I opted out, only because I don't care for the texture or taste of it. The vinaigrette dressing tied it all together very nicely. The salad was awesome and flavorful. All the ingredients were fresh and blended very well. I'm a huge vegetable lover and this salad definitely gets an A+!"
Sophia Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,44,37,1.0,5/23/2016,"This review is solely for the SERVICE since judging by the rest of the reviews, the food here is literally either a minor miss or a major miss. I work in the restaurant business so I always give the benefit of the doubt since you never know what kind of day a server may be having. However, our server looked like he was basically bored and uninterested by how he was constantly pacing back and forth looking around, wandering around, having no hustle in his actions, and speaking no more than 15 words to my friend and I during our 2.5 hour visit. Yes, 2.5 hour visit because we decided to see if our server would ever make any initiative to strike a conversation with us or to see if HE would ask US if we wanted to order any other items besides our 2 entrees. Also, at some point in the night, he actually sat down in the booth directly behind us with two other employees, talking. This place is legitimately wild.  He first came to our table and just asked us what we wanted to order. He didn't push any appetizers or desserts on us, and did not introduce himself for that matter. We think his name was ""James"" since we overheard a busser calling him over. He never spoke to us after asking us what we wanted to order and what drinks we wanted. He dropped off our drinks with NO words, only a ""you're welcome"". Someone else dropped off our food and we saw him checking up on ALL the tables around us, EXCEPT for us. It was such a strange and bizarre experience and I'm assuming he's new. I just don't understand with all the terrible reviews that there is no accountability for the workers or the management.  I was so excited for a Cheesecake Factory to be open in my hometown, but after giving this place 5 chances, I am seriously done. This place is a joke and I'm not sorry to say that since no one else from this establishment is sorry or remorseful for the terrible service and tragic lack of training and emphasis on customer service."
Marina E. B.,"Lakewood, CA",90,10,,5.0,11/18/2015,Cheesecake Factory is by far one of my favorite restaurants and the one in Cerritos was so great! The decorations are beautiful and the silverware was impeccable!  We ordered the Ahi Tartare for starters and shares the Bacon Bacon cheeseburger w extra secret sauce. be sure to order extra sauce if you love savory foods. We also order a slice of pumpkin pie cheesecake and it was absolutely delicious!! Opening a Cheesecake Factory in Cerritos was the best thing to happen in this city in a while! So happy :)  Now go out and enjoy a nice slice of cheesecake!
Tifany M.,"Lakewood, CA",65,14,4,4.0,7/22/2016,We had dinner there last night.  The wait time was only 15 minutes.  We were seated and the waitress quickly took our drink order.  It was not long before she brought our drinks and brought bread out.  She took our order and then the wait began.  It took almost 25 minutes for our food to come out.  They brought my plate but not my husband's.  They said they would check on his.  Within minutes the manager came over.  He noticed that they only brought one plate and said he would check on the other.  Within a minute they brought my husband's plate.  He ordered a pork chop but they did not bring a steak knife.  After eating half of it with a butter knife the waitress came by and got him a knife.  The manager came back and apologized for the food not being brought out and any other problems we have had and told my husband to save room for a slice of cheesecake because it was on him.  We thought it was very nice since we hadn't complained about anything.  We each ordered a slice of cheesecake to go and he comped both of our slices.  :)   Thank you Chris!  We were told that he is new to that location.  Way to go out of your way to make sure the customers are happy instead of waiting for them to complain about something.
