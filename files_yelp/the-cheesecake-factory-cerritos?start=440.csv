Vanessa S.,"South Gate, CA",2,66,19,1.0,1/7/2016,"The wait wasn't too long but wasn't quick either. The service was okay as well. Nothing special to recognize the waiter(s) that helped us. When asked about the menu, they didn't seem to knowledgable on the topic. The food was good; however, the complimentary bread and butter arrived after our meals.  My biggest concern was that as the baristas were cleaning the bar area, they started arguing! It was a man and a woman cussing at each other in front of customers. None of the other employees said anything. I was on my way out but I would have been upset if I had to listen to them while I was eating my meal."
Mina G.,"Long Beach, CA",76,10,1,3.0,9/3/2016,"Love this place we eat there all the time, today wasn't a very good experience got there the spoon on the table was dirty. got our food my daughter's noodles in her spaghetti wasn't cooked all the way. service was amazing little things that need to be fixed."
Kat C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,14,,5.0,4/7/2017,"Amazing food, amazing service. Food is prepared the way you request and again the service is amazing! Can't complain. If you want to grab a bite to eat and then head to the movies or walk around the mall, this restaurant is the place to go! Will definitely come back here again!"
Dino T.,"Cerritos, CA",0,33,41,1.0,2/2/2017,NOPE. I'm done with the Cerritos Cheesecake Factory. Whole atmosphere there ain't great. Will be sticking to the one in Fashion Island.
Zahrah P.,"Chino Hills, CA",320,22,37,2.0,6/19/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory however this location needs a little work. I came solo to have lunch. Place was packed but I managed to grab a seat at the bar. I was not offered bread, the bartender didn't lay out the napkin when he learned I was eating at the bar and my food was not boxed, I had to do it myself. Every other Cheesecake Factory I've visited the service at the bar was the same if I were sitting in the dinning room."
Odeya J.,"Highland, CA",1,45,78,3.0,1/17/2016,"Pros: black pepper chicken , balcony view and cheesecake. Cons: the fact that they have two entrances and  only one hostess locations available for such a busy time. It would make it easier for customers coming from the back to avoid the flow of the waiters and waitresses without us walking through trying to get to the hostess without knocking over someone's food or drinks. Next there was a long line to get to the hostess which was 15 minutes wait when getting to the hostess they took our name and stated another 20 minutes to request for a pager for the hour in half wait. Once getting paged waited another 10 minutes so they can seat us outside  on the heated balcony which was fine minus my heater was broken and we had a baby and toddler with us. So I advised the hostess who said you can wait another 20 mins to be reseated  no I'll stay since we're starving with small kids! So throughout dinner we felt the freezing cold wind . Waitress was helping another table and quickly introduced herself from another  She returned to take drink orders , wasn't anything special about her presence but I'm fine with that until I asked about the chicken samosas since I've never had them here I wanted to make sure they were made traditionally. She simply replied idk how they're made so maybe you shouldn't order them at all  excuse me? You should know the menu even if you don't eat them! The rest of the dinner went decently besides me paying for dinner portions I felt like our plates was plated with lunch special portions  I was still hungry afterwards.  Felt cheated out of my money. Now I order cheesecake to go and again get tiny portions. Normally get a nice size slice this time it was tiny. So idk about this location a lot of misses for me here. It left me really empty"
Vicky P.,"Villa Park, CA",6,39,5,2.0,12/29/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite, so I'm sad to write this review. My friend had been here twice and advised not to go because of the wait time and service. She also advised not to take patio seats because they had a patio in the mall and ruined their experience. PROS: My husband and I went on a Monday with a short wait time and our food came out promptly. CONS: this location is small! My chicken was burnt and my dish had half an inch of grease that touched everything. Everything tasted like grease.  Another thing I noticed was the hostess handing out pagers (skinny/tall girl with a big blue bow) she had pagers touching her mouth as she activated them. My husband argued that at least it wasn't IN her mouth, but on her lips is close enough!  I won't be back :/"
Editha H.,"La Palma, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/11/2015,Good service..  Waitress and manager are very nice.  We only waited for 5 minutes to get a table.  Very cooperative with customer.   Good food!!!!
Snooky C.,"Bakersfield, CA",65,81,185,2.0,11/6/2015,Food is OK our pasta was a little undercooked.. been here since 8:25 pm and ordered and didn't get our food till an hour later. The lighting is too dim I was falling asleep and they brought our food one at a time instead of Taking it all at once.
Carina C.,"Long Beach, CA",543,38,28,5.0,10/25/2016,"Outstanding lunch today with my mom and brothers after seeing a funny movie. I have to say, our incredible server, Yvette, made it special. She was very attentive as personable. Last time we were here this wasn't the case, so this was a treat having someone so good. My guacamole salad was delicious too. I had willpower not to have cheesecake, but my family loved their desserts. Great afternoon thanks to Yvette."
Athena C.,"Long Beach, CA",1,7,,4.0,12/19/2015,I loved this place. :) Wait time wasnt to long. The service was very friendly. Bread hot. We did wait a while for our food..but worth the wait.food was good..only issue was my sons fries were lil cold but I was so pleased with over all everything that I didnt mention it..they have a whole hig variety of menu choices it actually took me a while to decide lol..and of course the cheesecake was delicious. .I highly recommend it even though its a lil pricey :)
Amar P.,"Cerritos, CA",86,13,5,1.0,11/5/2015,"This place just opened the other day. So one would thing it would have their shit together . The location is nice but very small. I was very disappointed by the drink I ordered. Order a regular Mojito, very week. I watched the guy make it and he was training . Service is not that great. The hosts seat our party down and it took 20 minutes for the server to come to our table. He was good but did not really know the menu. I go to Cheesecake Factory often so I know what is good or what not but the staff didn't study the menu dissatisfaction on the service"
Brianna Z.,"Fullerton, CA",141,7,54,5.0,10/1/2016,Just had dinner here and really enjoyed the service. Starting from the hostess to the server! Abel has given the best service by far! He was very sweet and attentive. Definitely coming back and definitely asking for him.
Jose M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",5,21,10,1.0,11/13/2015,"Will definetly be going back to my usual Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. This place has young people working here but no experience.  I rather spend more gas than time to eat! This place takes forever, they told me an hour and it ended up being 2 hours!!!"
Amy A.,"Irvine, CA",0,38,27,5.0,1/31/2016,"I absolutely love this location. Great outdoor seating area as well as indoor. The wait was about 45 mins for a Saturday night, but it's worth it. They have great service and ever better food. You can't skip dessert!"
Gabby V.,"Downey, CA",73,16,52,4.0,11/21/2015,Wait was a bit much but we were able to go shopping while waiting. So it wasn't too bad. Tried the Fried Mac n Cheese balls and they were delicious! We ordered the Jambolaya and Farfalle. It was good but not the best I've had but good.
Renee A.,"Whittier, CA",0,22,,2.0,3/29/2017,"My first time at this location wasn't as bad as my second time here. The first time I was never brought my appetizer! The second I came with a party of 15, well 10 people arrived at 5:30pm and were told they would be seated I arrived and they were told ""We have your table ready but the server is overwhelmed!"" We kept going up and asking and they would say ""We are going to seat you now and they never did"" We got seated 2 hours later in an empty patio area where they could have suggested was open but did not! They kept us and our kids waiting plus me and my husband did not stay to enjoy a meal for his brothers birthday, We (myself,son, and husband) had to leave it was a school night and my husband had to work at 10pm which is the time our family said they left. Even then they told us bad things! I'll never return to this location it's horrible"
Ryan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",356,16,,5.0,8/24/2016,"Typically you get what you pay for at the CF, not here, they consistently go above and beyond to ensure the best possible dining experience.  The manager here, Mark Beaver, does an incredible job maintaining a professional staff that is kind, courteous, and efficient.  All of this while letting their personality shine through.  I have to say, A+ effort, A+ result.  I will continue to come here and I will continue to send my company's business here.  Bravo."
Denise G.,"Bellflower, CA",184,5,2,1.0,3/7/2017,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory but i was here on a Tuesday night, and I had the WORST server ever. Ive never had a bad experience like this. He was rude and just seem like he didn't care about his job. Didn't smile at us or even introduce himself and had snarky comments. He even snatched the menus from us, and when we asked about items on the menu, he answered like we were stupid. I don't know if he was having a bad day, but he was not acting professional AT ALL. Not only was he rude to me and my family but he was rude to his co workers, when we would watch him walk away he would give dirty looks to his co workers and I've even heard him make rude comments to other staff. I asked for his name from a different worker and they told me his name was Devin Francisco. I don't know how he still has this job, but everyone else on staff was friendly except him. But one bad server can really ruin a dinner."
Michelle K.,"San Diego, CA",7,68,6,5.0,5/23/2016,"Our server was Phoebe O. She was literally on top of her customer service. My family and I went there to eat after graduation at CSUF. Knowing it would be extremely busy with everyone going out to eat after commencement, she understood the fact that my dad had to catch a flight at LAX at 4:30 that evening and it was 2PM when we finally got seated. Regardless of the crazy rush, she promised to get us in and out of there in a half hour, and did exactly that! Thank you Phoebe for your excellent service. My family will definitely be back."
