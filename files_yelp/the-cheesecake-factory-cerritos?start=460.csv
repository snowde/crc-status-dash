Chris S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",4,3,,1.0,9/24/2016,"Very bad form! First, you forgot about my party and sat others before mine. second, you failed to serve a person in my party (claiming that another server mistakenly took her dish) thirdly, you brought her her dish and it was the wrong dish. Fourth, you finally brought her the correct dish and tried to get her to swap dishes. Fifth, you never even apologized for anything, you didn't even take anything off our bill (which was damn near $300 including tip) We will NEVER eat at your restaurant again, the entire experience was bad, your management sucks, the ONLY good thing was our server."
Danielle K.,"Fountain Valley, CA",34,112,31,3.0,1/31/2016,"Wowwww SLOW. Thankfully we only waited 30 minutes when we were quoted 45-1 hour. It must be because this is a new location. Our waiter is very nice and has kept me updated on my late soup, but we have been waiting an hour so far & all we've had are drinks, bread, and the appetizer (which was chicken potstickers and THOSE WERE FAB!)  So after the hour my soup-creamy artichoke chicken-came. I would really recommend it so delicious!!  15 min past the hour (so we have been at the table a total of 1 hour 15) the food arrives. Chicken piccata (creamy lemony chicken and pasta! Good portion size!), shepherd's pie, and a flatbread. It was all hot and tasty.  My mom wanted me to mention that they have no prices on their drink menu so when she got the bill she saw her lemon-drop martini, which she said was tasty, was $12, which stunned her. I equate CF with BJs in food/quality/selection, and BJs drinks are $4 cheaper.  Check came promptly, but i usually have the most trouble getting the waiter to come back and take my money...nope he just took it as i was typing.  Bottom line: dinner took too long BUT this is a new location so maybe it will improve. Ill give it time, but CF has never been my favorite place so i don't know when. Service was really great."
Grecia R.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/28/2017,"This was my first time visiting any Cheesecake Factory. Just wanted to take a moment to compliment Ericka, the server we received that evening. You guys were super busy, the restaurant was at capacity, and she was fantastic! I appreciate a server who does a great job, and she handled our table of 4 adults and 4 children with a perfect display of relaxed competence. Appreciated the food suggestions and accommodations. Well done!"
Rocio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,4.0,9/2/2016,Really loved their steak and salad. The mashed potatoes were great but their green beans tasted of propane and were really raw. Other than that it was a good time.
Madelyn T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",8,157,8,5.0,11/17/2015,Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite restaurants!  We were so excited that this opened up here in Cerritos!  We live down the street so that's a plus!  It just opened up about 2 weeks ago.  We went around 6:30 p.m.  It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night.  The girl at the counter was very nice.  We waited about 15 mins and got seated.  Our server was very attentive.  She made sure we were ok.  Our food took a while because there was some issue in the kitchen.  The manager came by to apologize and gave us a complimentary soup and dessert.  Our server came by frequently too.  We had no issues.  I understand they are going through training with the staff but our night was great!
Ann R.,"Cypress, CA",28,8,2,2.0,10/12/2016,"I only came in to buy a couple slices of cheesecake.  There were around three people working behind the counter and no one greeted us. I ordered two slices of cheesecake, and paid about $17.  This seems more expensive than I've paid at other locations. Also, the slices seemed smaller than at other locations. I wonder if anyone else has had the same experience."
Cali L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,96,,1.0,1/5/2017,"Do not eat here, trust me.  This is the worst cheesecake factory I have visited, and that says a lot because I have visited other locations within and outside of CA.  My family likes to order takeout when we are on this side of town.  After several visits, consistent errors have emerged:  poor presentation (looks like a toddler chopped the meat & veggies), employees are extremely slow to pick up phone to place/pickup order, and no matter the menu item ordered, the flavors are mediocre.  I have already emailed the corporate office a couple of times over the span of a few months.  We visited today in hopes of improvement but to no avail.  The only solution is to permanently refrain from eating here."
Williams N.,"Norwalk, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/13/2017,"Management here is terrible third time I've waited outside longer than 30 min. Was put on hold 4 times with a no answer after waiting on hold for about 8 min before i realized they just don't give a shit. Food already sucks now service sucks too don't come here please shut it down or get new management. Waited outside for 28 mins to get my food and asked to speak to manager waited another 5 min outside till I realized the manager doesn't care about his/her job. Please quit if you're not going to help the location for the better, you're getting paid to be lazy. Go back to mcdonalds."
Alejandra T.,"Downey, CA",7,26,20,1.0,11/15/2015,"Just opened last week definitely will wait to visit this location, waited way to long for food waiter never put in order. I did not make a big deal because they are new, but manager needs to step up training! Men's bathroom was out of toilet paper my husband after going back again had to ask an employee if they could stock and clean it. Women's bathroom was also out of toilet paper and seat covers I had heard the people next to me mention it, 40 min had gone by I decided to go and yes! Still not stocked and dirty, one of the bathroom did have toilet paper but was left on top of toilet to lazy to install it on the dispenser!!"
Markenna J.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,3.0,4/11/2017,"My first time here and the setup is really nice the place is big.  It was really busy so we sat on the heated patio which was nice as well and it felt really good out there.  The seats were very comfortable and the table was nice and big. The decor was really nice to me, that was the best part of the dinner for me lol. We ordered our food. Which was hard because the have a lot of food to choose from. There menu seems never ending. I ordered the a shrimp louie which was a salad with shrimp and it had two srips of bacon, two asparagus, one egg five  or six shrimp and a whole lot of salad. It had honey mustard vinaigrette dressing and thousand island dressing. The salad was very tasty and I should have ordered extra shrimp for all of the lettuce there was. I ordered the bistro shrimp pasta and added chicken to it as well. Let me just say it smelled delious but it tasted so blan like they did not season this stuff at all. I put salt and pepper so many times it did nothing. It was still blan. I had to go home and season that shit myself. And I added some other things to it. For the most part I didnt have just a bowl of noodles and a little meat. I had enough noodles and a lot of meat. Chicken and shrimp were super good.  Service was fair we had to wait a while for more salad dressing.  So overall I give the decor a 5 but the food is a forsure 3 and the service was a 4."
Ivan M.,"Norwalk, CA",0,12,2,5.0,1/19/2016,"Our server, Carlos S. was the best this morning. He provided us with everything we needed and described the lunch specials well. I had a Chicken Piccata and my girlfriend had a Pasta Chicken Scampi which were great, but I'm still not a fan of capers. Ha! Overall it was a positive experience and we'll definitely be back! Thanks Carlos!  p.s. Thanks for the cheesecake recommendation for my dad's birthday today and he loved the candle as well!"
David D.,"Downey, CA",0,8,1,2.0,1/2/2016,"We fought our way in to find a 2 hr wait, so we ordered out at the Bakery.  Daisy C took our order, there was a slight mis-interpretation of the size of the ""endive and pear"" salad, but she said it was fixed, she was a bit dishoveled by the restaurants  popularity, we never got our $89 reciept.  She promised us bread and butter......because it is complimentary. 35 min later, we wanted out of there so bad, we didnt notice the bread and butter missing, and we didnt notice the ""endive and pear"" salad was a 1/2 order in a large container.  She showed us the salad container on the bottom of the bag, so we left thinking everything was complete. When we returned home, not only was the salad order small, it didn't have any chicken in it?   I called the manager to complain, was placed on hold for 15 min and hung up. Now we know we are not going back!"
Berber J.,"Seal Beach, CA",29,46,20,4.0,12/1/2015,"Everyone complains about how long the wait is, but I still see that they stayed to eat. If it's such an inconvenience go eat somewhere else. My wife and I dined at this facility a week after it opened the estimated wait was about an hour, know I wanted delicious cheese cake, so We waited. Sure enough 25 minutes later we were seated the waiter brought us our drinks and bread, he took the order and than we waited for maybe 20 minutes to get our food. It was a bit annoying that the dish washer disposal or something was on the other side of  where our table was, every time it came on it was loud. The food was amazing; chicken piccata the best. I was a little heart broken cause not only did I want cheese cake but I also wanted red velvet, they were out of the red. Over all it was great in and out within an hour and a half. Highly recommended"
Jim S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,175,82,5.0,10/29/2015,Beautiful new location in the Los Cerritos Center opening 11-2 at 11am. I am thrilled to have a location so close to home! There is also a brand new Harkins Theater opening up right next door in the near future. This will be a super dinner and a movie location.  Can't wait !
Chongi X.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,25,78,3.0,11/22/2015,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory and this one isn't too bad.  It is still fairly new so obviously the service isn't going to be top notch.  Our server didn't really check in on us after we were served.  Though she did make sure that we were fully comfortable and had room to eat.  Also, she did ensure that our drinks was always filled."
Mike C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",35,15,6,1.0,8/21/2016,Worst service ever... Took over an hour to get food ordered and delivered.  Saw waiter 2x during the hour... Have to find someone to order cheesecake and to leave.
Lijia M.,"Long Beach, CA",1,1,,5.0,4/2/2017,Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. I come here to get some TLC every time deadlines start cracking my back. I usually go to the location in Huntington Beach but decided to try this location since I heard it was fairly new. I'm a Pasta Da Vinci lover so if you go here TRY IT. I usually go to the bar since the high tops are self seating. I was lucky enough to snag a table right away as soon as I saw someone get up. Mind you it's a Friday dinner shift so if you know the restaurant industry you know it's game time. The table still had dirty plates but Frankee the busser was immediately on top of it. While he was cleaning he managed to spark a conversation with us about our day. He was very charismatic and a professional at the same time. Throughout our dinner he was constantly hustling around the bar and always had a positive attitude. Management should definitely reward him. I'm a server myself and he has a lot of potential and attitude for it. Dinner was great as usual never disappointing and our server was also very nice. I would definitely come back here for the service and of course...Pasta Da Vinci.
Karen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/1/2016,Long wait...they kept pushing our ticket to the back and then seated us outside of restaraunt in the mall area. Had to ask for bread..smh. Not a good look!!!
Crystal D.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,2,1.0,1/6/2017,"Save your time and money. Yesterday I experienced a horrible manager, hostess and server service. I went in yesterday with a group of 8 plus 1 child. The host didn't even know how long the wait would be and had to call the manager over, shouldn't they be trained to know how long is a wait. The manger Holly told us it would be about an 1hr and 15 mins of a wait and gave us a buzzer and to come back and see if our table was ready. We came back about 45 mins later and the host said we lost our table because they called us 4 times to let us know our table was ready, no one received a call from them and our buzzer never rang. The manager Holly than came to explain she couldn't do nothing and we had to wait another 45 mins after already waiting for more than an 1hr. How ridiculous is this. We still waited and once we got seated it took our server Mayra at least 15 mins to greet us and get our drink order. A little acknowledgement would've been nice, we understood it was busy but there's a certain limit."
Paul W.,"Bellflower, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/7/2016,The service here is horrible... Never coming back to cheesecake ever again. We had 2 servers so confusing. One was a girl didn't introduce her name just gave us bread and got our drinks. My friend had a hair in her drink and the girl server didn't apologize.. The guy server name Miguel came and helped us with food orders. He was nice and attentive and our day got better until everyone got their food but my pal waited 20 min for his food we were all finished eating by the time his food came... The server packed our left overs for us to go and he said he gave everyone their correct bags. Once we all got home come to realize Miguel didn't give everyone their correct leftovers... Cheesecake needs to do some serious training for all their servers
