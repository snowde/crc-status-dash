Nora S.,"Downey, CA",17,56,49,4.0,1/18/2016,"We went on MLK day and the wait at lunch time was 40 minutes. After our order was taken it took about a half an hour to get our food and we ended up loading up on the warm sourdough bread and butter. Although the food took a while to come out, our server was fantastic. She was constantly checking on us and making sure we were always good. The food was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor. I had the chicken marsala and was pleased that it tasted the way it should - I had ordered this at another cheesecake factory and it lacked flavor. The S'mores cheesecake ended my meal and it was chocolate-y enough to curb my chocolate craving.  Overall it was a delicuous lunch but we were there for a very long time."
Rob G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/5/2015,"Worst experience ever!! First Time being here. First it took 30 mins to get my food right . Then when I finally get it there's  a hair on it! Now I'm pissed of but my girl calm me down . The ""manager"" comes and says he's so sorry and we'll get that fix right away and offers me a  complimentary salad of soup. What!! Fuck no man I need a discount for this crap so I only got 50% off my meal. So I wait 20 more minutes for my meal And taste like crap . The only good part was our waiter was cool and gave me a free cheesecake  hell yeah !! So I know it wasn't his fault so I gave him a tip still .  But never again"
Jacky L.,"Gardena, CA",6,30,37,4.0,7/25/2016,I'm only giving them 4 stars because they took out the BEST cheesecake ever - pineapple upside down cheesecake. Bring it back!!!
Maria L.,"Whittier, CA",35,14,12,5.0,5/28/2016,"Ask to be served by Dustin, he is an awesome waiter with a GREAT personality. He took very good care of us, patiently answered all my food questions since I can be indecisive and made us laugh along the way. His manager Mark came by to check on us, and apologized for my wine glass being chipped and comped part of our meal because of the glass. Bartender was also very accommodating. Best Cheesecake Factory experience I have ever had. Thank you both for making our evening memorable! We will definitely be coming back to this location!"
Rebecca C.,"Irvine, CA",14,16,13,3.0,9/27/2016,Great food as always. Unfortunately the service is extremely slow. So slow that it can get annoying. So slow that you could get hungry all over again. When we walked in there was already a 30 min wait. If only their service was quicker there wouldn't be such a long wait. Sorry to say but I will avoid this location only due to their service.
Jon D.,"Norwalk, CA",8,49,29,2.0,1/15/2017,"OK. So I wanted to give this restaurant a few tries before coming to my conclusion about reviewing it. Today being my third visit and a reluctant one, that being said because my wife really wanted to go. OK let's go. We opted for bar seating to avoid the wait. Service was sluggish from the get go, took awhile to even get drinks no biggie but when this happens and then your presured to order also? I'm not really cool with that. Ordered drinks and my beer comes out after waiting almost 20 minutes and its the wrong beer. Trying to stay positive we order our meals. This being my third visit I can honestly say that this location does not know how to simply fry fried food dishes. Potatoes are greasy with burnt onions and peppers and we're definitely reheated and fried again, unedible. My waffles were OK my poached eggs were to perfection I will say. My wife's dish Monte Christo breakfast sandwhich. Another fried dish, served soggy, and a wet oily mess. 3x same experience this restaurant has has a beautiful decor a decent bar and great deserts but I will not be coming back to eat here ever again. If you come here be ready to go to the restroom shortly after because the greasy gross food will get you!"
Charmie P.,"South Gate, CA",0,51,,1.0,10/12/2016,"Service: Inconsistent 1* Food:     Inconsistent 1* After 4 tries not once has there been a consistent service or meal.  Whatever is going on with the management in this location, would put less popular places out of business overnight. They survive by their name. Nearly every time I go for lunch, I order the Renee Special.  The 3 times I've attempted to order it at this location, they have gotten in wrong, each and every time.  It's quite a simple order, yet, somehow, they bring it to the table completely wrong.  One thing that the cooks don't dress the soups (tortilla soup w/o the tortillas or crema), use the wrong bread/baguette (they don't seem to be able to identify the differences between bread and baguettes let along brioche and sourdough), used the wrong filling for the sandwich (there's only two choices, how hard is this?), send an extremely wet salad w/o dressing, but, the server doesn't even notice?  One time, ok... 3 times delivering what I didn't order is simply poor management all the way around. Evidently, training on the job is not working out well.   The other 2 times the same exact meal was ordered, it had to go back at least once.  And, all things the servers should have caught before they brought the meal to the table. When serving, you check the order with the actual meals you are picking up. Evidently, this is not done at this location, with consistency.   Not one server even noticed what they were bringing.  I know it's a part time job, but, that's no excuse as tips here are excellent.   Then, when desserts served after clearing the table, the waitress never brought spoors, asked us if we wanted refills on water or other drinks nor asked if we wanted coffee.  Just as odd, she would walk up to the table and start to speak interrupting w/o even waiting to be acknowledged. Trying to get her attention was useless, so someone at another table gave us a fork they weren't using. These sorts of things happened with more than one server over the last 4 times. On one visit, a friend had ask for a medium steak and it was pretty much raw. It was sent back 3 times after which the rest of her meal was cold.  We were with 8 other people and 2 of those we were with did not get their meals until after everyone else had finished.  The waitress forgot to pick up their salads which were limp by the time they arrived.  The management did zip to accommodate or adjust.  When they asked to see the manager, he strolled over and very smugly said he was sorry, however, they were quite busy.  Not exactly accommodating.  Each visit has been with different groups of people (2-10) for lunch and each time the manager on duty was inundated with customer complaints.  Only the one time did someone ask for the manager who simply apologized and made no effort to right the situation.    This is not to say that some didn't get a great meal, but, when it's this disjointed, who cares?  These completely unnecessary flubs made for such uncomfortable dining experiences, some won't be back to this location, not after 4 tries, anyway.  Back to Bella Terra or Fashion Island, but skipping Cerritos."
Tamara T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9,35,24,5.0,7/3/2016,Love the Louisiana Chicken and Red Velvet Cheesecake! Worth all the calories (once in a while).
Kristina H.,"Cerritos, CA",56,28,20,3.0,5/5/2016,"The food was good so I can't complain about that, but it took about an hour to seat us on a random Thursday. And even after we were seated, our waiter took forever to take our order, about another 30 minutes. By this time we were starving! The waiter overall was nice so maybe they just had too many tables. Lighting in the restaurant is too dark for my taste but nice if u like basically eating in the dark. If u come here just make sure your schedule is open because of the exceptionally long wait."
Yolin H.,"San Diego, CA",1,28,157,2.0,11/8/2015,"We came to the restaurant on Friday, they were quite busy. And we started to wait from 18:30, and be seated at around 19:45, which was more than one hour for the table. We ordered 4 plates, and they spent almost half an hour to make only 3 dishes!! And the last plate took another 20mins to came out! Obliviously they were too busy and they forgot it! And one of us just started her dinner after three of us had completed out meals. Finally they offered us free cakes for the long time wait. Still they have long way to go! You have to state your request to the server twice to get served, you will surely run out of your patience not only for waiting for table and food, but also for service!! It was 22:15 after we walked out of the restaurant, Almost 4 hours for one meal is ridiculous. Comparing the food and service, I may not be back in a short period."
Michele D.,"Lakewood, CA",19,19,4,2.0,1/15/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory! So writing a horrible review is bad, especially since we just got one in our area. Third time I've been here. First two times, not so bad. Long wait times but ok, they're new. Just left today and the experience was awful. Hubby and I ordered a grande burrito and steak tacos. 40 minutes after not receiving our food we flag down a manager and told him about the long wait time. He heads to the kitchen. Moments later our waitress (who was quite forgetful) comes and says our food is almost ready. We told her there is no way that should this long and she says they've been working on it the whole time. Really? Girl bye. Manager comes with the food without so much as an apology. We start eating our lukewarm meal and no one even bothers to return until it's done. The quality and presentation were horrible for a Cheesecake Factory.  Get it together Cerritos.  PS: I hope you regularly review your management. They're failing this location."
Elsa T.,"Paramount, CA",190,126,50,2.0,4/9/2016,"It's just another Bjs , but more expensive. Had a margarita, not good at all ! Chicken Alfredo was ok .... Sorry just not for me."
S P.,"Buena Park, CA",0,11,,1.0,11/11/2016,"We had the worst service! I've been looking through the reviews and responses from Cheesecake on Yelp. Cheesecake responds by trying to appease customers by saying, ""give us another chance, we will talk to our team members  so it doesn't happen again""...obviously it did and its continuing to happen... There should be an improvement in service if you're asking your customers to ""give another chance."" When the restaurant is rated at 2.5 stars, shouldn't there be a red flag alert saying we need to do something to change these reviews? In no way was today's service anything but horrible. To top it off, one of Cheesecake's review said, ""you should have spoken to a manager."" The problem was the manager.  I've given Cheesecake a lot of our business as well as big family gatherings. I am in such utter disappointment ...almost disgusted that a small monetary expense to make a couple more bucks would take over principality and consumer satisfaction. I've been to many different Cheesecake locations... It has always been a pleasant experience where truly I felt customer satisfaction was at the top priority...well except this Cerritos location. By far the worst.  As a new location wouldn't you want to be exceptional in every way...there are so many competitors out there near this location. Really? It boggles my mind. I completely agree with the overall rating at 2.5 stars maybe less bc I would never want to go back there again. That should tell you guys that your management team is not doing such a good job training your employees and doing what you can to bring customer satisfaction. I heard that cheesecake's motto is customer satisfaction but Holly, the manager ruined that motto over requesting for extra sauce.  She clearly saw that i didn't really touch my food bc the jambalaya pasta tasted so bland with little sauce to cover the noodles...although I requested for extra sauce from the get go. It tasted more bland bc there was so much noodles...it tasted overcooked! The cook probably doesn't know ratios to proportions. When I ordered I already requested for extra sauce but it came out with barely any. My pasta was lacking the rich savory flavors from the pasta. So we requested for extra sauce. It took nearly 35 minutes-40 minutes getting the sauce. When the sauce came out after waiting so long, literally there was so many tomato chunks and no sauce to marinade the pasta noodles so we requested for more. This is when our server comes back saying they were going to charge us for more sauce...granted i was already dissatisfied with the pasta dish. Jambalaya is one of my favorite dishes at Cheesecake... whoever made it, destroyed it and the manager just killed it.  I wasn't even asking for a complimentary meal bc it didn't taste good, I was asking for more sauce so I can fix the meal for its full flavor that I remember having...but holly the manager adamantly said she would need to charge extra. We had ordered over $100.00 worth of food for a table of two adults and 2 young children less than 4 years old who don't eat much but we ordered their own kid's meal. Not to mention, we were ready to order dessert bc our girls saved room for it while I was still waiting but we didn't want to spend another penny there. The amount spent did not equate to dissatisfying customers for extra sauce... Especially for a pasta dish that didn't taste up to par. Overcooked noodles made it worse bc there was barely enough sauce. I call this Poor decision making skills!!! I would never hire someone like that, the cook who probably complained that he or she had to make more sauce and the manager who didn't know how to listen to the customer's concern. I would never want ppl like that to run and manage my business! I would go bankrupt!!!"
Stephanie S.,"Seal Beach, CA",1,21,6,1.0,6/21/2016,I have been to many locations of this fine restaurant and have always been satisfied with everything from food to service. I met family at the Cerritos location and am sad to say I will never go back. Food good as always but I get better service at home. Sad to say I won't be returning to this location and it is a shame considering the reputation this chain has
Dan G.,"Long Beach, CA",1,9,,1.0,3/17/2016,"Won't be coming back to the Cerritos store.  We came for my wife's birthday.  She ordered a steak, my daughter ordered a steak as well. I went with the chicken piccata. My friend went with a cheeseburger & fries. I have no idea, what the deal is with this place. The steaks came out and we waited. A full 5 minutes later my chicken was served. Ok. But the burger took 15 more minutes, then came out without fries of cheese. Really? The most basic thing we ordered seemed too difficult for them to handle.  Don't get me wrong, I've been to many cheesecake factories and have always enjoyed good service.  The manager Gabriel came out and although he started out apologetic, then blamed my fried for ordering his burger well done and promised another one would be brought out ""to-go"" as we requested. Another 15 minutes pass as we wait for the burger and fries.  Now here is where it gets topped off. Gabriel brings out a bag and hands it to my wife very apologetic like. Both me and my buddy think she was given a consolation cheesecake or something like that cause it was her birthday. I ask what it was and she said, it's the burger and fries. WTF? Really. You can't even deal with the guy who's order you screwed up? Cheesecake Factory, I'm still a fan. I just won't be coming back to the Cerritos store anymore so long as you continue to employ immature management."
Cristal A.,"Bellflower, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2016,"Food- Eh...  Staff- Needs Improvement. Lots of improvement. The very moment me and my family walked into the restaurant it was a very bad vibe. The staff acts as if it is miserable to work there. IT WAS A SLOW DAY! Not welcoming at all. Our waitress didn't even introduce himself. If possible, I would give this place no stars."
Genesis F.,"Long Beach, CA",141,70,128,2.0,7/8/2016,"So the service was pretty bad to say the least. Our server didn't bring an extra plate even the my friends were sharing their meal and had expressed that as they ordered; I didn't like the wag the fruit looked for the kids meal so I asked if we could get fries instead and she acted as though it was my fault by giving attiude like I ordered wrong; when the food was brought for my friends she didn't even offer parmesan cheese although they get offered cheese every time they order this dish. And she rarely checked back to see how everything was going.  This is my second time going to this location and I can only say I go because of the name, not because of the service."
Jennifer S.,"Lakewood, CA",90,15,5,5.0,6/12/2016,"Came in for lunch on a busy Sunday. I'm a vegan and often have a hard time finding something that has flavor. But I must say, their Vegan Cobb was outstanding!  The dressing is so flavorful and the salad is full of beautiful vegetables. They have many choices for vegans, and for the first time in a while, I didn't feel hungry when I left a restaurant. Our ticket time was long and I was a little irritated, but our server came over and owned her mistake. She said she goofed and I thought that was so mature. I'm a former General Manager (before having children) and I think that took guts. So often, we tend to blame the kitchen because it's easy to do. And I'd also like to give positive attention to our food runner. She noticed our ticket time and alerted the GM who then ran our food. Great food and service. We will be back!"
Zareen B.,"Buena Park, CA",8,20,44,3.0,1/8/2016,"I've dined here once and it wasn't pleasant. The entrance is small and cramped and usually very crowded after sunset. You have to push your way around to see the hostess. Wait times are at least 30 minutes for 2 people and there's no place to sit. Cheesecake factory has poor lighting and this location is no exception.  Our server, Britney, was great, but going from ""waiting to be seated"" to ""seated"" ruined our night. It was too long a wait; on a Wednesday night, too.  The take-away experience wasn't that efficient, either. We called in an order, and then added an extra slice when we arrived. Took at least 10 minutes to get it together, and someone who ordered in person after us, got theirs at the same time we did. That was a different night and we ended up having to share he foyer with the dine-in guests and I barely had room to move around.  The thing that this Cheesecake Factory has going for it is that it's the closest one in this area. And it's close to the mall. At least I don't have to drive to Brea or Huntington Beach anymore for cheesecake. Also, the salted caramel cheesecake is to die for! Love it."
FoodTravelCa ..,"Lakewood, CA",0,27,5,1.0,3/16/2017,So I've dined here a few times because my children has taken me here for dinner and it's nearby where they live I'm not a fan of them because mostly all their location their food always comes out cold and Raw and it last night and it took over 2 hours to get a plate of spaghetti and eggplant I walked out hungry I have to clean my own table I got no refills the manager had an attitude I told her off and walked out and guess what she didn't even care you know what's a shame these Cheesecake Factories they're not cheap restaurants they're million-dollar restaurant people work hard and their life to accomplish and they hired these managers the majority of them that don't care and is not on top of the food what a waste the only thing I would ever go back for is the bar area for their drinks not a fan I think Cerritos is the worst location I've been to for anywhere $20 - $30 I think even more for there steak dinners is not worth it I can take my money anywhere else and get better
