Rick L.,"Staten Island, NY",58,17,14,1.0,6/7/2016,"this place has the worst manager! she does not know how to accomodate her customers regardless of the size of the party, too bad she lost a good business--- she ruined my moms bday!!!!"
Jeimmy O.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,3,4.0,6/1/2016,"Great food and our waiter was off the hook, very friendly and funny! Definitely would recommend to others. I had the veggie burger it was very delicious better than I expected actually I was between that one or the vegan Cobb salad because I wanted to try something more healthy but my other two gal pals had these yummy chicken dishes. Let's not talk about their whole grain bread, I would have just eaten that it was warm, crunchy and amazing! One of the best locations I've been to thus far!"
JMahrie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,8,1.0,1/23/2017,"I tried to call to order to go. I wanted to know if I can pay with a gift card over the phone, and the gentleman that answered totally cut me off without letting me finish. So I waited awhile on hold when I decided to hang up and call again. I ended with the same gentleman who answered my previous call. I started the conversation with my question about the gift card. He said I couldn't. Which was fine, but do not cut off a customer in the mid sentence! I'll be taking my order to the Cheesecake Factory in Anaheim! They have better service than this new location."
Linda A.,"Wilmington, CA",23,17,5,2.0,6/1/2016,We had dinner at the cerritos location for the first time and last time. We usually go to redondo...i have for years only order the spicey cashew chix..it was so terrible i couldnt even eat it...we talked to the manager from his own lips he basically said they changed the recipe a little to cut corners and save time.. i had been it the resturant business for 15 years knowing customer service the server to took 11 mins to even get our drinks to the table..didnt even bring.. waters to the table and never asked if we wanted dessert..never really smiled at all. Terrible service as well... we took something home.. and the cost was $95.00 the manager didnt even bother to comp dessert he gave me extra rice . To add to my over sauced dish.. i guess we will not be goin back there..
David V.,"Wildomar, CA",11,40,5,5.0,5/18/2016,"Almost didn't try the new spot out with all the negative reviews. But glad we did. We had no issues. A short wait for a table, very polite and attentive waiter. Food was cooked and delivered as ordered. Price was expected prior to going. Thanks."
T F.,"Eastvale, CA",0,51,4,3.0,7/23/2016,"I just want to give five stars to the manager Chris!!!! Came in this past Thursday with my sister, had some issues with the server and Chris listen and was attentive to us as we told him the issue, little did we know that there was a plumbing problem in the kitchen as we were talking with him; he did not rush us and acted like he had all the time in the world. Chris, thank you for giving exceptional customer service!!!!!"
Thomas W.,"Artesia, CA",0,29,,2.0,2/8/2017,"Bad service, overpriced cakes and what's worse is they discontinued good flavor ones and replaced it with kiddie flavors."
Irene S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,13,1.0,8/10/2016,Went around 4pm it was half empty... But no one was there to seat me. I waited 30mins to be seated... Then it took my waiter 15mins to get me water.... After i finally got my food my waiter disappeared and another waiter came to help me get the check. Just ridiculous. Never going back!!! Just eat somewhere else!
Joanna S.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/26/2016,"So, yesterday night my girls and i decided to have dinner and we decided to come to cheesecake factory. Cheesecake Factory, is one of my favorite restaurants and have always experience top notch service while visiting the one at the The grove, Marina Del Rey, Americana on brand and even Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas. I expected the one in Cerritos to be the same and twice as better just because it's new. However, this time around i walked out so unhappy and unsatified with how poor the service was and how the manager handled the situation.  We checked in at around 7:35pm, host said the waiting time was an 1hr, which was totally fine. We did not wait an hour, instead we got seated much quicker and waited for 25 minutes.  Host sat us down at our table and the first thing i notice was that there was only one small plate, one napkin and one set of utensils. I went ahead and told the host and she said she would bring some. The host never came back, so we waited 8 minutes until our waiter came by. After we order our drinks and appetizer, i addressed if she could bring plates and utensils and  napkins. Appetizers came out and we still did not have utensils, plates, napkins and bread.   Waiter, brought another waiter and said she was going on her break and he would take care of us. We were ready to order our food and once again i asked if he could bring us plates, utensils and napkins for the THIRD TIME! We received our food and we STILL did not have  plates, napkins and utensils. At this point, our food was cold and we were waiting for our waiter to come by. I'm sure he was busy, so i went ahead and asked another waiter for the FIFTH TIME , if he could bring plates, utensils, and napkins, he said said sure. However, he never came back. I decided to address my issue to the manager, i explained the situaion and all he said was, ""I'm sorry, let me get plates and utensils"". He bought out the utensils, but forgot to bring small plates. I told him, ""are we suppose to eat our food with our hands"", and he said, ""well, we can have a food eating contest"". At this point i was really upset and It really grind my gear on how unprofessional he was whether he was joking around. In all honesty i expected him to say,"" i apologize for this situation, this will be on us"", just for courtesy, but all he said was, ""i'm sorry"". I don't expect my food to be free, but when a situation like this happens and i have to ask 5 TIMES for something that should have been on the table BEFORE we got seated, i would expect that manager to be like"" this will be a complimentary dinner"", or something in between those lines.  THE WORST service and the WORST approach taking by a manager!!!"
Laura O.,"Culver City, CA",4,11,3,5.0,8/26/2016,"Steak Diane (medium rare) with herb crusted salmon, mashed potatoes and asparagus.....pure heaven! I purposely tried to eat this slow to savor every single bite! My girl got the chicken & shrimp gumbo, she loved it as well. Oh, I almost forgot, we ordered the Ahi Carpaccio, it looked like a piece of artwork, and tasted delicious! Would definitely order everything again!!"
Mike I.,"Paramount, CA",0,2,4,1.0,2/22/2016,"Let me start off by saying the place looks amazing, but sadly it ends there for me. The wait time to get our food took forever and to make it worst, the food they brought out left much to be desired. The quantity of the food they brought for what they were charging was a joke!!! It looked like it was another customers leftover. Believe me, it's not like I was expecting a lot, but it was horrible. The taste of it was definitely not worth the price they charged. This was actually my first time here and will probably be my last. I had some high expectations due to some positive feedbacks from others, but maybe they were wrong. Not a fan of this place and I will not be coming back here."
Amber C.,"Gardena, CA",0,8,3,2.0,1/9/2017,Staff was ok but our food was cold!!!! Asked if it could be reheated and it came back on a hot plate but again COLD! Wont be going back to this location. Ruined my birthday dinner
Isabel R.,"Downey, CA",0,6,1,5.0,8/1/2016,"the food is really tasty. Our waitress the first time and the last time was Phoebe, she is very nice and always on point with every thing."
Frannie B.,"Long Beach, CA",11,85,158,3.0,11/22/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory so I'm not gonna be to hard with this review. I was so excited to hear they had just opened a week before my birthday. On the day of, my family took me here to celebrate my special day. This location is huge and very beautiful. I was extremely excited to get the party started. We entered the restaurant and my heart dropped. OMG! people were packed everywhere! Didn't expect to see so many people due to the patio area being almost empty. My sister checked in and the hostess said it would be a 55 to 90 minute wait. Ugh! She asked if we wanted indoors or out and we said which ever comes first. So as we're waiting we decide to take a walk in the mall. If it wasn't for the mall, I think we would have left.  What I can say. The service was excellent!. All of the employee's went out of their way to make sure you were satisfied. This is where it goes down hill. Our waitress asked if we wanted bread? Doesn't everyone? She came back informed us that they ran out of bread and will bring us some once in comes out of the oven. Hmm? Not starting off so well. We ordered appetizers with our meals and they brought them to the table one a time. I thought that was odd. As we started to eat, the waitress came back and told us that they had ran out of salmon but had enough for a lunch size plate, if we were okay with that? Great! What's next. Minutes later our plates started to arrive before we were even finish with the appetizers, as we're pushing plates all over the table just to make room. Really? Now I'm starting to get annoyed! Lets get your timing down people! By the time we got to the main dishes, they were all cold. There's nothing worse then a lukewarm/cold meal. I refused to eat mine but instead of making a big deal, I had the waitress to pack it up for me to go. As I'm looking across the table while my sister is eating, I notice her boyfriend still waiting on his lunch size dinner. OMG!! They forgot! The waitress came over again and apologized. She said she didn't like what the salmon had looked like, so she had them to make him another dinner. So all of a sudden, you have more salmon? Come on guy's! It was one thing after the other. Before we left the waiters came over to sing me happy birthday. Happy I wasn't but I will go back because I know they just need time to get it together!"
Cielo B.,"Long Beach, CA",1,21,,3.0,12/8/2015,"I went with a party of 7 here yesterday to celebrate a Birthday at around 7:00PM.  Wait was bearable.   Cons: We ordered three different appetizers and they had ran out of all 3, the waiter ended up having to bring a list of all the items that were not available.  Only 1 person successfully ordered an appetizer.  My brother ordered the Cajun Jambalaya, it came out a few minutes after all the other entrees. So while everyone else was eating, he wasn't.  When it finally came out, the pasta was under cooked to the point of inedible. It had to be remade and this time was ordered to go as everyone was done eating.  They do not provide a complimentary slice of cheesecake for Birthdays.  Pros Despite all the setbacks our waiter was Amazing!! Funny, cute, polite, attentive, clumsy... Hence the 3 stars."
E M.,"Cypress, CA",0,14,,1.0,7/11/2016,Worst service ever. Yes we were seated promptly but that is about it. Wait staff should be reconsidered. I've always enjoyed going to Cheesecake Factory but this location doesn't meet the standard for the name.  Wow thought I'd give it a second try. BIG GIANT mistake. Hostess said wait is 30-40 minutes. 50 minutes later I checked in with the hostess and she said she couldn't tell me how long the wait would be because they are doing the best they can. Whoa right from the start service was already poor and I haven't even been seated yet.  This location is THE worst EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!  They should get no stars.
Mariana F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/6/2017,"We were a party of 9, came in 30 min prior our desired dinner time, checked in at 6:45pm, host gave us a pager and advised us to come back, check in and follow up with our initial wait time (1hr & 15min). We came back 45 mins later just to make sure we wouldn't miss our spot. When we followed up, they told us our pager had been paged and that they called us four times. My pager didn't go off, & I had ONE missed call. Which when I called back, no one picked up. Hostest and Manager told us our table was no longer available. Unbelievable after an hour and wait!!! Manager notified us if we wanted to stay, we had to wait an additional 45mins! Manager; Holly. Was very unhelpful and she didn't have the courtesy to offer us anything to accommodate us.  45mins later we got seated. Waitress did not show up, not even to acknowledge us, maybe after 15mins. I get it it can be busy, but it's common courtesy to stop by our table. Not to mention 30 mins to get complimentary bread and still No drinks. Waitress was also rude, and was overwhelmed with another table, and giving our table attitude, and mumbling while walking away. So unprofessional and lack of customer satisfaction. We got our food and 10 mins after they offered us boxes as if we were done!! We spent over four hours for poor service and Holly didn't even come to check up on us after her staff had made a mistake. Not to mention another 30mins to pay our check. We left that place at 1030. This use to be one of my favorite places to dine in, but after this experience I won't be coming back."
LaLa M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/9/2016,"This was not worth it for what they charge. Maybe cheesecake good but food not really. Was expecting better. Weird entrance if you are coming from mall entrance, too much traffic. My daughter was served dry pasta, asked for extra sauce and they never brought it, had to ask again. Greasy floors when going thru traffic."
Colleen G.,"Lakewood, CA",0,7,3,2.0,8/19/2016,"Food was very good.  Margarita cost $10.25 and served in a very glass.  Margarita taste was syrupy and thick, with no salt. VERY noisy, worse than a sports bar on a Super Bowl weekend. Lots of teenage girls celebrating birthdays. Very sweet hostess and servers."
