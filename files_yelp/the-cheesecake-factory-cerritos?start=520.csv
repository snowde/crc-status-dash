Eddy A.,"Long Beach, CA",51,16,4,2.0,4/9/2016,"I'm sure the food here is about the same quality level as any Cheesecake Factory. This review is strictly about the staff and how unfriendly and unwelcoming they are. I came here to buy a cheesecake for a birthday and the lady helping me out was a complete jerk and even asked me to hurry up when making my decision , and when I asked if so and so are any good she responded with ""I don't know"" and rolled her eyes. I know it wasn't work stress as they had just opened, such a shame how someone like that could be hired at a place like this."
Belinda A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/17/2016,"Waited to be seated for over 30 minutes on a Tuesday night, the waiter did get our order after 15 minutes and told us that bread is on the way. Our food was finally served at 9pm and we signed in at 7:15pm. I ordered pasta shrimp- it was dry and the shrimp is over cooked. Overall experience was disappointing and quite embarrassed to my family who came to visit us. We opted out for dessert, we don't want to wait another hour for it."
Simon Q.,"Anaheim, CA",513,31,9,3.0,6/10/2016,It's a nice place but the servers are slow getting to your table on a timely matter. The food is great though.
Sheila R.,"Torrance, CA",2,5,,2.0,5/22/2016,"If you're looking to use their curbside service, be prepared to go into the restaurant to pick up your food. My husband waited 25 minutes after calling the curbside number and no one ever came. He decided to go in to the restaurant after seeing another customer leaving their car to go inside and needless to say our food was on the back counter getting cold. Once he got home, I called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. I waited on hold for 15 min and no manager came to the phone, so I finally hung up. If they do not have enough staff to run a curbside service, then they shouldn't offer it. The only reason I'm rating this location 2 stars is because the food is decent. They're service, however, needs A LOT of improvement."
Hector P.,"Downey, CA",8,25,6,5.0,6/18/2016,"Never had any major issues when dining at any of the Cheesecakes and this one didn't disappoint again. I ordered my food without mushrooms and when I received it had them in my order. Although I didn't make a big deal out of it and even told our server (Arthur) that I wasn't allergic and didn't want to waste food, he still went and advised the manager who in turn apologized and provided my meal for free. As always, all the dishes tasted great and the service was excellent! Definitely will continue to be a loyal patron."
Pilis M.,"Cypress, CA",25,7,13,5.0,12/14/2015,We had an amazing dinner and our server Brooke was a very nice and very attentive! The food was delicious and the drinks were the bomb!! I really enjoy everything!!
Karina R.,"Huntington Park, CA",54,5,2,1.0,3/20/2016,"I went last night and the place was a mad house. but stuck it out be Cuz one of my cousins had been wanting to come for weeks. we expected to wait, but wow it was ridiculous. arrival time  730 we had to wait in line to check in... a first for me. ok... that's fine. is sat it's busy. let's make the best of it. asked the host to estimate a return time. and hour and twenty. we were asked to return in 20 for a buzzer. Wait 20. got our buzzer and decided to walk the mall. we were afraid we would walk too far off. we we came back at her estimated time. 750. 830. we are seated. ok let's have some drinks. service was slow asked for water. she never brought it out. bread never refilled. I'm really annoyed now. where the hell is the server to ask her where is our food.  940 finally track manager down. we asked for him to help. she walks by and chimes in. Oh wow there u are now.  3 serves bring our meals out. we ask for boxes to go instantly. the look at each other. place the food down and walk away. never came back with boxes. track down another waiter to get boxes.  we left at 10.  we didn't even eat our food there.  worst cheesecake factory I have ever been to"
Yves J S.,"Sacramento, CA",96,280,42,1.0,3/16/2016,"Lets see.... entree arrives before appetizer, and kids meals which were supposed to be a priority arrived last. I've been to many Cheese Cake factories, and nothing seems right here. The corn cake was smothered with enough sauce to consider it a soup, my medium rare steak is more rare than than a white elephant sighting, and the salmon came out colder than the asparagus it was on. ...and I'm sorry, but if a waitor doesn't know where to put the food, may be he should consider taking away the extra cold baskets of bread, or the excess bread plates."
Dollar B.,"Lakewood, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/14/2016,"Horrible experience, the worse cheesecake factory ever. The dishes was dirty at the table. I ordered two well done burgers that came out rare. We had to tell them what we ordered, because they kept forgetting certain items to bring to the table. Will not be coming back!"
Joshua H.,"Cerritos, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/18/2016,"Went in and noticed the mens restroom was a disaster. I informed the hostesses at the desk and waited to be seated. I never saw her tell anyone. I saw half a dozen people go in and then walk straight out because it was unusable. 20 minutes the restroom still a mess and later my buzzer rings to be seated. I ask for a manager. Some dude name Chris comes up. I ask him if his hostesses notified him or anyone that the bathroom is a mess. He said no. I said it sounds like he has two problems, handed him the buzzer and walked out. I belive he and the hostess a blonde Asian girl just laughed about it as I walked out but whatever. I don't need to eat there and neither do you right? Btw other locations much better go there instead."
Samantha M.,"Long Beach, CA",3,6,5,5.0,6/19/2016,Came for Father's Day tonight with my parents and had the most amazing experience! James was our server and was one of the most attentive servers we all have ever experienced! Food was amazing as always and drinks were amazing as well! Couldn't of ask for more! :)
Brian L.,"Cerritos, CA",21,8,,2.0,4/15/2016,"If you like sitting around wondering where the rest of your parties order is and when your server may come back, then this is the place for you.  There were two servers helping us and neither one seemed to care less about our experience.  Communication and transparency goes a long way with a customer like me, but sitting around and feeling neglected while your order(we had 7 in our party) comes out one to two plates at a time over twenty minutes sucks.  I can put up with a lot and I'm very low maintenance but, I won't tolerate paying money at an establishment while feeling like I'm annoying or barely being tolerated by a server. I will NEVER be back."
Melanie L.,"Frisco, TX",49,24,18,2.0,4/14/2016,"There is much to be desired from the service element at the Cheesecake Factory. One might think it is just a new restaurant working out the bugs but after 3 visits you would think its all leveled out. Nope. It's unfortunate that we have been hampered with poor food quality and/or poor service. This is exclusive to this location at this time. Lack of attentiveness has been an issue on each of our visits- the team work serving element is just not working here. We have had to ask out server(s) on several instances about ordered food and drinks. Unfortunate, that this continues to be the result of a restaurant that had been so anticipated. Much to be desired from this organization. Keep trying CCF we might come back."
Ompong J.,"Artesia, CA",0,8,,4.0,6/15/2016,Very good!  Always a treat to dine here with my fam!  My favorite one is the one at the grove but this one is closer!  Great food and service.
Karen J.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,25,8,1.0,3/20/2016,"Waited 6 months for the hype to die down. Should have listened to the reviews and stayed away. In short, it was a 2 hour experience from hell.  We got sat a little after 6pm and then it was all downhill:  1) Sat 10 min before I had to call anyone to ask for who our server was.  2) 10 min later, they brought out bread but we had no silverware or plates to eat off of? One of the girls said ""I'll get you guys some plates as soon as we see some clean ones."" Forreal?  3) They forgot my lemonade.  4) Waited over 30 min!! for appetizer and one of them didn't even come.  5) Then they brought out the kids' food and my husband's food and they told me they messed up on my order and needed to remake it.  6) So it's 720 and I still don't have my food and waiter comes to tell me that kitchen doesn't know where my order was. I mean W T H. Seriously?  7) I talk to the manager myself and she offers to fix the bill and throws in free cheesecake and coffee. She only takes out my entree and comps the two other items that we didn't even receive but supposedly kitchen made it for our table so it had to be itemized. Really, that's fixing the bill?  Yeah thanks but you guys are horrible. Never again."
Joan Y.,"San Francisco, CA",184,31,41,1.0,5/8/2016,"Didn't want to go through the crazy packed crowds for Mother's Day, we so ordered to go, but that was a bad idea too. Got to the the line and asked where I go to pick up for the phone orders.. She and I could clearly see that our order was already ready on the counter but she asked me to wait in line for the people that were ordering to go. Of course I waited patiently for 10-15 minutes. After getting to the counter I asked if you have to wait in line for phone orders because I had seen a gentlemen who just got there pay and leave right away, to which she said phone orders actually get priority! So when the MANAGER rang me up I asked him again and he said no you have to wait in line but IT DEPENDS - what exactly does that mean?! At such a restaurant you should have a set regulation. My food is cold and this brought down our mood for this holiday"
Susan M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,2,5.0,6/28/2016,Had the Best experience at this location. Our server Jacob was the BEST... I give him a  stars if I could. Loved that Jacob knows his stuff I asked for opinion plenty of times on our dishes and desert and let me tell you I was pleased every single time...
jeannie y.,"Buena Park, CA",3,35,,4.0,11/19/2016,"The wait here is always long, so we avoid peak dining hours. We've never waited more than 15 minutes. The servers are attentive, food quality is good-standard Cheesecake Factory. It's located in Cerritos mall, which is a plus-dine and shop at one location."
Princess L.,"Long Beach, CA",1,14,109,2.0,7/17/2016,"I wish the manager was our server because he was the best thing from our night. Our server never came around and our food took 45 minutes or longer, I stopped looking at my watch. The manager had to come over and apologize and took our burgers off the bill. Lesson learned... just not coming back."
Moani L.,"Long Beach, CA",16,26,49,3.0,4/25/2016,"ok...soo have heard about the service was not so good here...and so far they are right, our 2 waters, 1 cold tea & decafe coffee just went to the ppl across from us that just sat down. And guess what? they took our drinks and they all looked at each other Oh my gawd!! to be continued---"
