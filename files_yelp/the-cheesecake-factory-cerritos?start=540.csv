Tee L.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",246,17,26,2.0,5/19/2016,New kid on the block. Nice decor and background music is leveled enough for you to enjoy both the sounds and your company.  Staff seemed friendly and their bathrooms are super clean.  I ordered the Renee's lunch Special and was full just enjoying the soup and baby green salad. Took the turkey sandwich Togo for later treat.
Chelsea S.,"Bellflower, CA",0,5,33,5.0,4/1/2016,This is my 3rd time coming here lol and I haven't had any problems with the food or service really. I'm a very picky and critical person. The food is good the waiters are attentive . One thing I don't like is how the silverware is laid out. Lol
Elena O.,"Norwalk, CA",5,10,48,2.0,5/6/2016,Came on the opening night of the Harkins Theater. BAD IDEA. Service was terribly slow. It took about 20 minutes to flag down our waiter for the check. My pasta was meh.
Yajaira B.,"Downey, CA",11,19,,2.0,3/24/2016,"I came with my mom for first time on Tuesday March 22 around 4pm. We have wait months for the hype to go down and visit the restaurant without waiting an hour to sit down. When we got there; the hostess told us to wait 10 minutes to be seated. Two minutes later a group of 6 came and they got seated it right away. We told the hostess how come they got seated right away and we didn't it. Anyways she apologize and we got seated. Once seated the waiter took awhile to show up. She showed up and we already had decided our entrees. One thing I don't like at all is that the menu does not invite you to try the food. It's all letters and not provocative. Anyhow, I chose the tostada chicken breast salad and my mom ordered the Cuban sandwich. I received my entree way too early and my mom received hers 10 minutes later. When I saw my tostada salad it was a complete disappointment. It was barely any chicken on it. It seemed that they put a lot of lettuce and tomatoes to make it look big but in reality it has not even 1 chicken breast on it. I thought that for 10.50 it was expensive and the flavor was nothin out of this world. Personally chilis has a better tostada salad for 8.95 that contains more chicken. Finally, my Mom sandwich was alright. It didn't taste anything different and it was pricey as well. I always want it To come to this restaurant because It seems busy and I thought the food was delicious but personally is not only the food that are bad; is also the service. I don't think I will give it a try again. I rather go to BJs or chilis than Cheesecake Factory."
Alison G.,"Fort Riley, KS",24,8,2,4.0,5/24/2016,"It's after 12 on a Tuesday. Was seated fairly quickly. Server came quickly and welcome my family and I since it was our first time. Drink orders came fairly quickly as well as the soup. Ordered the steak medallions, cooked to the way I ordered it. Family members ordered soup of the day and a chicken salad sandwich. Soup was delicious but chicken salad sandwich was bigger than expected, so that got boxed. Overall, everything was good and delicious."
Siva U.,"Cerritos, CA",5,7,3,1.0,3/6/2016,"We choose this restaurant because it is closer to my apartment. Unfortunately it is crowded, long wait times and really bad serving. Service is extremely awful. You can watch a movie by the time ur food comes. They don't even follow up abt how u re doing. From my experience I say THUMBS DOWN for this place."
Hu J.,"Cerritos, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/30/2016,"No. Just no. Compared to other cheesecake factories I've visited, this place is the worst. The customer service is ok, just that the food is nasty."
Leah H.,"Long Beach, CA",11,19,19,3.0,6/7/2016,"Impersonal service. Like a Gardners mow, blow and go. Chicken salad sandwhich bland salty, watery. Salad that came with it very bitter inedible barely any dressing. No questions asked about the meal. However the oreo cheesecake was delicious. Next time will come for takeout cheesecake."
JoAnn K.,"Lakewood, CA",6,34,6,1.0,3/27/2016,"This is for the Cheesecake Factory Bakery at the front of the restaurant. I went to the restaurant on Friday March 18 to order a cheesecake to be picked up Saturday after we ate lunch. I ordered a large cheesecake - 1/2 banana cream and 1/2 lemon meringue.  The employee asked me if I would like to add a chocolate plaque they could put Happy Birthday on, I ordered a dark chocolate one for $3 and change - I don't remember the exact amount. I told the girl we were coming in to eat lunch around 1:30 and I would pick up the cheesecake after we ate. After eating I went to the counter to pick up the cheesecake - I watched the girl pick up the box, it was sitting out on the counter. I asked about that - why it wasn't in the fridge? She assured me it was fine. Then she brought out the chocolate plaque - a WHITE chocolate plaque with Happy Birthday on it. I told her I ordered DARK chocolate plaque and showed her the receipt. She just looked at me - I knew she was waiting for me to say ""oh that's okay."" But it wasn't okay - no one likes white chocolate. But my teenage grandson who was behind me said just take it so we can go. No apology - no we'll refund your $3 and change. I am 10 minutes from this restaurant - when I opened the cheesecake box at home the meringue was completely melted off of the cheesecake - it had melted down the side and was in a glob on the cardboard. This is why they shouldn't have taken it out of the fridge before we picked it up.  The White chocolate plaque - it went in the trash after the party, seems no one likes white chocolate - which isn't really chocolate at all, but that's another story. I did send a message to Cheesecake Factory's Headquarters - but haven't heard anything back from them."
Mari H.,"Norwalk, CA",2,15,,3.0,9/6/2016,So I really love the Cheesecake Factory but I'm not sure I will be coming back to this one.  First I want to say that our waitress was really nice.  Our waters & our appetizer came out pretty quick & I thought that was great!  But the dinner on the other hand took forever!  By the time we got our food I was already full off the bread.  We also had a baby with us so we asked for a high chair when they first sat us.  I'm guessing they don't have enough high chairs to accommodate their guest because we had to wait until someone was done using theirs.  By that time there was no way the baby wanted to go in the chair since he got a taste of sitting & playing in the booth. So that didn't go too well on our part.  I do think that even though this place seems very crowded with staff....it seems like they are under staff?  If that makes any sense?  This was the second time that my family has been here and both times the food just takes way to long to come to our table.
mira k.,"Anaheim, CA",263,60,16,2.0,3/7/2016,"For convenience this location is great.  Ive been here probably 10 times since its opening.  Cheesecake factory has semi above average fare if prepared correctly and served by a polite staff but this location still hasnt grasped the concept.  The meals and service are still hit or miss even the management seems to lack in customer service, with one exception the runner for to go car service. Dont know her name but she knows mine and her service is excellent.  Out of the 10 or so times I've been here my food was prepared incorrectly half of those and I order the same thing every time.  How hard is it to prepare steak diane medium (3 little fillets)  and shrimp scampi."
Maria P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,3,3.0,3/24/2016,The food is good and the place is nice but I've been here four times and every single time I come we wait so long for our food to come out that the manager comes to our table and apologizes for the wait. Maybe one or two times is understandable but all 4 times? They really need to work on the speed of their kitchen staff.
Adriana O.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,1,2.0,2/16/2016,"BEYOND SLOW is my word for this place.  I have been wanting to try this place in years I remember back in the days nothing was even like today. Prices for chessecakes are wow 24.95 for a 7inch cake? Really its so tiny! I recommend you just go get really GOOD CAKE/CHESSECAKE at portos bakery around the same price.  The prices for the food is crazy. I do not reccomend anyone to get the CHICKEN CARBONARA $20.00 no flavor, no taste , SERIOUSLY boil some pasta with just water and salt, n there you go same taste, NOTHING.  The wait there wow also! Was told it would be around 15 mins , they gave us a vibrating machine that notified us when ready, well 15 mins turned into 30-40 mins, on a Tuesday!! This place is just crazy, they ring you when there ready when there not, we got notified with the ringer & went up and they told us to wait along other parties who were also waititng there its like a whole other crowd of people waiting to be seated. Well that took another 5-10 mins of just standing and waiting to get our table! One guest even went up to the greeter and said that this is crazy and she has been waiting way to long and other parties were getting seated and she was just standing there you can tell she was mad. Okay... So we got our table got seated and everything we thought OK WERE SEATED THIS SHOULD BE PRETTY QUICK, BUT NOOOOOOO! We got sat around 7:45 no joke and ended up leaving until 10:00 , our waiter was really really nice but MANNN SOOO SO SLOWW LIKE REAllY SLOW! We got seated n didnt come to us until like 10 mins to get us started with our drinks, we ordered and we all got TROPICAL ICE TEAS, NO LIE THOSE WERE VERY GOOD HIGHLY RECCOMEND , thats what one of my stars go for!!! Lol.....  Okay so then we got our drinks and they offer you some bread , waited another 10 mins to get bread & our bread came before our drinks! Then we waited another 5 mins for our drinks after that, mannnn im not even playing it wasss very very slow, we ordered our apetizer and that took some time aswell but was delieverd by another waiter, then we needed refills on drinks and our waiter was no where to be found or nothing  , after that she poped out of no wherre and FINALLY AFTER 40 MINS NO JOKE!!!! She took our order! At this point we were just bored and anxious , we kept seeing other parties coming in the door after us and leaving within 1 hour , getting there apetizers meals & drinks in Seconds !!!! Idk but man we got a burrito from 1-10 a 7 , Pasta carbonara 1-10 = a 0 !!!!!! Kids pasta was okay, chicken pos-sticker apetizer was way way to salty!!!!! I dont remember what the thing my dad got but that was good it was chicken in white sauce & brocoli with mash. That was okay. But man i will never recommend this place too anyone , my experience was beyond SLOWWW SLOW... I mean im sorry but not sorry  but thumbs down for this place , its a no for me to go back...... Just slow, not to mention we came here to celebrate my moms birthday & she did not like it, she got the carbonara & let us all taste it, it tasted LIKE NOTHING !!!!!!! But thats it, hopefully this doesnt happen to anyone & if it does im sorry i feel it too."
Iris B.,"Cerritos, CA",174,3,,1.0,12/22/2016,"Very disappointed of the customer service by the hostess and manager, I will never recommend nor visit this place"
Melissa R.,"El Monte, CA",96,6,1,1.0,2/26/2016,Worst service ever.  Arrived for dinner not  late restaurant wasn't crowed.  We ordered our food and drinks waited...waited and waited some more then we noticed other customers that came in after us where getting served.  Total wait time was about 45mins.  Asked waiter to just get me our check so we can pay for our drinks not looking for hand out.  Waiter advised he will get his manager.  Ugggh waited another 5-10mins I was done.  Manager finally came out  gave us mumble jumble excuse.   I work hard for my money and to have an experience like this at this kinda upscaley restaurant is a total turn off!
Esteban M.,"Houston, TX",0,3,1,5.0,6/20/2016,"Best experience ever! The waitress that served us was amazing, she was constantly checking up on us and making sure that our orders came out perfect! She was very good with refills and was very charming and funny. I honestly think that eating here is one of the best decisions you could make. Overall, the food is great and the staff are the best!"
C and c C.,"Bellflower, CA",7,103,70,2.0,2/18/2016,The reviews had me wondering how this place was still in business.  On a Tuesday eve we thought it would be decent service since it wasn't packed.  Wrong!!  Here's the timeline : - 45 minute to be seated - 18 minute for a server to appear and take the drink orders - 10 minutes for server to take our dinner orders    although he brought our drinks  - 10 minutes for 3 pieces of bread to appear ( we were a party of 4)  and ready to leave cuz we were starving  - 20 minutes for 2 meals to be brought out  - 9 minutes for the other 2 meals The food was good and I can't blame the servers as they had to work a larger area on their own.  Whomever is in charge should really look at getting this fixed as the wait time was way too long for an average number of patrons. I've been to other restaurants with wall to wall people and service is much more efficient.  4 stars are for the food and 2 were deducted because of the loooong wait. Hopefully the issues get fixed
Justin O.,"Corona, CA",14,16,35,1.0,3/21/2016,"Just waited 15 minuets to order and it taken another 15 just to get the 3 slices of cheesecake we orderd togo.. Lines, lines, and more lines.."
Amanda R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/22/2016,"The food here is awesome.  I've not had a meal I didn't enjoy.  This place (cerritos mall) is always busy;  and that's why the hostess doesn't care.  What happened you ask?? We put our name on list,  received the pager,  was informed it would be 30 minutes,  waited 30, asked how much longer,  that's when. ... the non-caring biT@h said""it's for ...."" . That's not the name. Then did something on the screen,  said it would be another 15. I'm sure she forgot. It would have been professional and the right thing to do and admit the mistake."
Dianne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,2,,1.0,3/23/2016,This was the worst service I've ever received at any restaurant. I've given this location 3 chances and they just get worse each time. Heather was our server and she was extremely rude. Everything about the experience was terrible.
