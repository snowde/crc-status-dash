Malu L.,"Cerritos, CA",12,10,7,2.0,4/16/2016,Wait is long and service is slow. Waitress took her sweet time in serving. With the price you pay I don't think it's worth it.
Lauren T.,"Cerritos, CA",0,2,1,5.0,5/1/2016,"We came here for my mom's birthday and we have to really thank server Javier and manager Kelly! We ordered 3 steaks and after they all came out overcooked, they went out of their way to apologize and make it up to us! They insisted we let them cook us some new steaks the way we originally wanted and they came out so much better. Thank you so much for caring about great customer service!! :)"
Stacey A.,"Whittier, CA",37,2,,2.0,11/11/2015,With a new resturant I expect craziness.  But this was way too much !  Stop telling people the wait is 30 minutes.. update your check-in system.  Hopefully the service and food is better than the check-in and the manager that didn't really seem to care.
Dorothy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/26/2016,Food is beyond amazing!!!! Try the Chicken Madeira! Their popular dish! You won't regret it
Celia A.,"Long Beach, CA",27,21,13,2.0,3/31/2016,"Disappointed! I was exited to try this location because it's fairly close to my home. However I was extremely disappointed with just about everything. The first time I went it was a Friday night and I was starving. My husband and I checked in and was told with was a two hour wait sooooo we left. On a second occasion we decided to play it smart and went for lunch during the week so no wait. My husband wanted to get the Caroline, which is a pulled pork and Cole slaw burger type sandwich but was told they didn't have that????? I mean then what's the point of the menu. Anyway the waiter suggested he get a bbq  pulled chicken sandwich, and he agreed. I ordered the steak Diane and chicken.  So, then the plates arrive late and at different times. I got mine first so I waited for my husbands plate. I didn't want to be rude and eat without him. When his plate arrived it wasn't what we ordered. It was a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was not pulled. We called for the waiter and told him about the mistake. What they did to fix it???? They brought us a side of bbq. It was so infuriating that we laughed and ate. So never again with this location. I rather drive the extra miles to the one at redondo beach!!!"
Julia Z.,"Cypress, CA",466,561,1199,1.0,12/20/2015,"I've been to a lot of cheesecake fac locations. This one is so disappointing! We were there like around 7pm and they already ran out of the brown bread which is my favorite thing i recommended to my husband (bc it's his first time). Then I ordered avocado roll which is also a popular, which is overfried at the end of several pieces which we had to discard the wrap. And my asian salad.. you kidding me.. the vegetable is overly bitter. I understand some veggie is bitter, but the portion made it just un-edible.  My big big disappointment is the lack of the brown bread... which is my main reason going there :( Sometimes even if I order to-go at the Grove one, they gave that with the entree I ordered which made I love Cheesecake fac so much. There're just not enough words to express my disappointment that I spent like 70 bucks but can't get my favorite. And the dishes simply not to the cheesecake fac standard, now I have to convince my hubby to give it another try at some other location to win over his other picks of restaurants. Yikes. Service is ok, but the waitress didn't introduce herself which is un-common in such restaraunt.  but her service is ok, except for telling us they ran out of the bread."
Jen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,770,58,1.0,12/27/2015,"We came here on a Thursday night for a late dinner. We knew that they just opened a few weeks ago and that they would still be working on getting all the kinks out but we didn't think it would be this badly.  Let me first start off by saying my ONE star is for the restaurant and the managerial team not based on my waiter or service.  My waiter was excellent, I mean he handled himself well and I felt bad for the poor guy that the system was going down and he was overwhelmingly busy. His name was James from what I can recall and he did everything the best he could. I guess after we ordered the computer system crashed and the kitchen was trying to track down orders? He gave us a free salad while we waited and he didn't have to do that.  Also the restaurant was out of butter for the bread? Really? Um how do you run out of butter?  We finally got our order after sitting and waiting for about 1 hour and 15minutes. And we were missing a part of our order but we didn't care at that point to track it down we just wanted to eat and go home.  Would I come back? Not for a while. I think the managers need to step it up, hire more staff, train them well and be more efficient?"
Leo And Barbara N.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",62,55,135,2.0,12/23/2015,"We've been to Cheesecake Factory's in Denver, Houston, San Antonio, and Louisville and have ALWAYS had excellent food and service. At this location, the service wasn't so bad but the quality of the prepared food was ""HORRIBLE"". We ordered an Old Fashioned Hamburger with no cheese but of course it comes to the table with 2 slices of cheese. They take it back to the kitchen and in less than 5 minutes brought another burger that was so raw it was bleeding red. So they take it back one more time but it was obvious that they threw it into the microwave which cooked the burger but left the bread soggy and wet. For what you pay for, I highly recommend going to Lazy Dog at the other end of the mall if you want a quality meal for a much reasonable price."
Carlos M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/3/2016,"Just walked out . Picked this location for my birthday lunch because i wanted to start my day off right and was extremely disappointed. We put our name in and waiting for 15 min with no one waiting , empty tables in thr patio and dining room and couldnt get a seat."
Soky C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,9,2,1.0,1/24/2016,"2nd time here. Didn't actually get to sit and eat on this second visit because apparently their policy for parties of 8 or more must be approved by a manager. The host couldn't even add my party to the wait list without a manager. What kind of craziness is this? What are you going to do, see if you want my business or not? Thought it was pretty ridiculous."
Leslie O.,"Huntington Park, CA",20,22,13,1.0,4/18/2016,"I always wanted to come to the chesse cake factory, but i was not satisfied with costumer service."
John Paul P.,"Norwalk, CA",20,43,13,2.0,3/3/2016,"I hate to do this since I like the cheesecake factory, but my experience here has been a let down. Much smaller than the other locations I've been to. I ordered the usual, Louisiana chicken pasta. The sauce was watered down. Our waitress didn't check up on us during our meal, we had to flag her down, which is no good. I understand this is a new location, but hopefully they can turn it around. At this point, I would rather drive to a further cheesecake franchise."
Troy B.,"Los Alamitos, CA",127,6,,5.0,2/2/2016,"Go here all the time, always get the same thing, always tip good. Heathers bomb. #keylimemango"
Gwen S.,"Lakewood, CA",0,17,42,5.0,3/30/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my fav restaurants and was very surprised at the service I received the evening my family and I went there.  I must say the customer service I am used to receiving at the Cheesecake Factory was re-confirmed when I received not one but two phone calls from the manager Steve at the Cerritos location. He called to discuss the service and food order we received the evening we were there. One thing I rate very, very high is ""excellent"" customer service. He didn't try and make excuses he listened, apologized and most importantly offered us another opportunity to experience their extensive menu and good customer service. Thank you Steve."
Chris M.,"Lakewood, CA",211,11,2,2.0,11/15/2015,"My friends and I came to have a later dinner on Saturday 11/14/15 around 10pm. I am definitely disappointed in the training and customer service aspect of this new location.  First and foremost, I had a bad impression on this location from the moment I walked up to the host to put our name down. There were two young girls at the counter, neither of them looking up to acknowledge their surroundings. As I reached the counter, I had to get the hostess attention to put our name down. Along with that, the other girl turns around and interrupts and begins to rant and talk about how rude customers are. I will quote ""customers are so F***ing rude."" Off the bat, I already knew that I was not going to enjoy this dinner. Any worker should absolutely not put down or talk about another customer in work place, especially in front of another customer. A host can be seen as the face and first impression of a restaurant. The good thing is that we were seated within 5 mins having that it was late at night and slow.  Secondly, I would say our service was mediocre. It was not too bad, but definitely could be way better. I think it primarily goes around the training aspect and evaluating if the server is qualified and ready to be put out there. I could tell that our server lacked the training and experience. In the very beginning she could not remember our drink orders and had to come back to us to reconfirm even though I did see her write it down, also I had requested only wheat bread but she had to come back for that as well thinking that we only wanted sourdough. The only good thing that I experienced was the food itself, it came out in a timely matter and was delicious. Our server did check up on us every so often; however it was a quick ""everything ok?"" while passing by. It did not seem very genuine and time caring. At the end of the meal, we wanted to pay with two cards; however we asked to put only a certain amount on one card and the rest on my card. The server claimed that they can only do half/half with the cards, which even I know is wrong. I always go to your Bella terra and Brea locations and done it before. So I insisted to the server that I am pretty sure you guys can do that and she said she will try. It is ridiculous that a server does not even know the basics. At the end she was able to charge us under our requests. Lastly, a server should not grab the signed check with tip until a party leaves as for this is what she did.  Though I was very excited about a cheesecake factory opening up at a closer location to me, I am utterly disappointed. I honestly would rather go to your further locations. I think that the all the workers need a proper retraining and the management team needs to be able to identify or reevaluate ones capabilities and qualifications. Your employees are the face of your restaurant and are the ones servicing the customers directly. I do understand that they have not even been open for a month yet, but that is no excuse in my opinion. You should not open a restaurant if the team is not ready. Im not sure if they did this, but it would be a good idea to bring in experienced workers from a different location into a new restaurant for a smoother opening and better first impression to the customers. So in order to have a good business and a good reputation, it is important that the team knows the meaning of service and simply how to execute them"
Diana B.,"Long Beach, CA",2,16,9,2.0,3/4/2016,"What a disappointment.   I love cheesecake factory but this location needs help!  The appetizer took ove 35 minutes to get to us and when it did it was cold! Then our dinner gets to us over 50 minutes after we arrived and it was cold too!!!! Our server didn't  even get our drinks right and we didn't send them back because she never came back to ask if everything was ok....never going back to that location,  ill stick to the Redondo Beach location.  Corporate really needs to help this place out."
Maria M.,"Cerritos, CA",1,12,,1.0,5/1/2016,"We were so excited to try the new Cheesecake Factory in our city and were met with a huge disappointment. I went in to ask for a table for eight. They took my name and I asked what the wait would be. The young lady stated she couldn't give me a time and that a manager would have to ""speak to me."" Why? I waited 15 minutes for the manager, just to be told my wait time! What?  Everyone coming in was told it would be 30 minutes, but we'd have to wait 3hrs! So my party lost 15-20 minutes, just to be told our wait time from a somewhat rude manager. Never again. There are at least 100 great restaurants in our city; try one of those!"
Chris J.,"Pacoima, CA",0,30,2,1.0,3/4/2016,"Dear Military/Veterans and those who support us, FYI...Cheesecake Factory does not offer any discounts to Military/Veterans. Typically I ask restaurants and they say yes as they realize the sacrifice Military/Veterans have made for this country (life, blood sweat, tears, etc.), so it is a sure win-win for the Military/Veterans and restaurant (i.e. repeat business). However our waiter asked the manager and he gave us a cold ""No!"" In the future I will be taking my $$$ to a Military/Veteran friendly restaurant.  :-("
Ramiro O.,"Norwalk, CA",12,4,1,1.0,11/29/2015,Worse Cheesecake Factory ever very disorganized! The people that work here don't know if they're going or coming !!! Too bad because is a nice location ! Bad service
Darleen P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,2.0,11/21/2016,"I came here on Friday night to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend and with this experience, I will never go to this location ever again. Anyway, waited about 15-20 min to get seated, that's a fair time to wait. We ordered the loaded potato tots as our appetizer and those are bomb af. Anyway, after we finished we ordered our entrees. I ordered the grilled porkchop and my BF ordered the steak diane. About 2 min later, another server comes to our table with 2 plates (a steak Diane and a chicken entree). We let him know that wasn't what ordered..so about 1 min later he comes back with another server and she asks me ""I could have sworn you ordered the chicken.."" I was like ummm NO, I ordered the pork. So they still drop off the steak diane to my BF cause it was the same dish. Anyway, ANOTHER min later, our actual server comes by and apologizes for the confusion but still takes the entree away and I understand there is confusion because the prior table that was sitting there walked out. So we are waiting, and we finally got our entrees. My porkchop entree was mediocre, I still ate half of it. The applesauce was a little strange being that it had some citrus fruit in it but it was OK, still edible. The steak diane is decent as well. I still had half of my porkchop left and my BF had a couple of steak pieces left with a ton of mashed potatoes left. I stopped eating because I wanted to make room for cheesecake. We were in conversation at the time our server came and grabbed our unfinished entrees. I assumed he was going to box them and give them back to us so he then asks us if we want dessert. I order the red velvet cheesecake and BF orders the godiva cheesecake. Our server then brought our cheesecake plus the check. Mine was excellent. Anyway, still can't finish the cheesecake cause the slice was massive so I get the servers attention and MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BOXES... So he obliges and give us boxes for our cheesecakes... BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR UNFINISHED ENTREES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY SHORTLY BEFORE THAT!? Well, we NEVER GOT THEM back... We then left because I'm not one to want to cause a scene but I did leave upset and extremely disappointed. The reason for the 2 stars I left was because I really did love the loaded potato tots and the red velvet cheesecake. Anyway, management, please have your servers ask their customers if they are still working on their entree or if they would like a box especially if they still have half of their dish left on the plate!!!"
