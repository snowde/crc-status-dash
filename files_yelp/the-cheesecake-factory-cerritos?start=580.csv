Anissa S.,"Lynwood, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,"Decided to give the new Cerritos location a try. Worst restaurant experience ever!!! A fiasco! Everyone here seems so confused! 45 minute wait to be seated. Add another 20-25 minutes for our waitress to appear. 15 more for bread. 10 on top of that for our drinks. We finally get to order, then I was told that what I ordered off of the menu was not available? After 2 hours of wasted time, my soup arrives to the table COLD!!!! I could not take it anymore and asked to speak to the manager. Frank (the manager?) arrives and was immediately defensive. ""So what's the problem?"" he says.  Really Frank? I am the customer! Whatever happened to hello, how can I help you?  The problem is that your staff is inadequate, my food is cold and your attitude is stank! ""Anything else?"" he says as if I did something to him. No that will be it! Thank you for ruining my birthday! Yes, it was my birthday! No apology, no concern that you have customers waiting in line to complain to you about their poor experience in YOUR restaurant. Frank just did not give a s**t and for that The Cheescake Factory will never see another dime of my money! For every unsatisfied customer, at least another 10 will be told about their bad experience. So here you go!!!!"
Elle V.,"Ontario, CA",161,98,37,1.0,12/13/2015,"Let me first start of by saying I am a HUGE Cheesecake Factory fan. I've been in multiple locations in LA as well as in Vegas and the east coast - I'm a FAN. I was so excited when this one opened near my parents. Today happened to be my second time here. First off, the staff has been great for the most part. Always happy, smiling, willing to assist, etc.  On our first time here, I felt so bad, but our waitress looked like she was about to cry. She was incredibly distracted, had to look at your mouth intensely to understand, idk what it was but I was genuinely concerned for her well being. She mentioned she wasn't used to being a Sunday waitress but she just seemed...off. She wasn't sure about the menu and things like that. Our waitress this second time was great, but I do notice that they disappear a lot for long periods of time and only check on you once and disappear again. I noticed the table next to us were getting antsy trying to pay their bill and get out of here.  The food wait though was and IS ridiculous. I thought maybe it was just that one time but here I am, sitting at the table, having spent more than 2 hrs. Just waiting on food. Not to mention that on this visit, my order came out wrong not once but TWICE. Even getting a slice of cheesecake is an additional 20 mins. Our waitress gave me a complimentary soup which was nice. The coffee we ordered was in a To-go cup although we didn't ask for it to be. Our drinks remained unchecked so they were watered down through half the meal and you couldn't even be bothered to ask for fear it would take another 15 mins and you'd have choked by then. Another table just returned one of their plates. The Tuscan chicken was drowning in the balsamic vinaigrette that made the whole plate just sour. It was as if the entree became a soup. Oh and their bread is either hard as a rock or super fresh; on our first visit I had to ask our waitress to replace our batch because it was burnt and overcooked - you might break your tooth! You could hear and see the kitchen staff scrambling and yelling, someone was trying to encourage a faster pace... It's not that they are understaffed for sure but it's as if no one knows what they are doing, there's no sense of organization, no leadership... I've never been a waitress but I can guarantee you I would do a lot better and would hate to get the wrath of customers due to an incompetent kitchen. I'm incredibly incredibly disappointed and don't think I'll be back at this location. I have never had such a horrible experience at a Cheesecake Factory or a restaurant. (p.s. Finally had a bite of my left overs - which was my Chicken Marsala and mushrooms that took over an hr. to get to me and was missing the mushrooms so I never got to really try it since I stuffed my hungry belly with the hard bread and soup down - the chicken is HORRID. Like wth! There's fat on its pieces and feels and tastes rubbery... this is so sad... Does Chef Ramsey need to pop in for a visit?!)"
Conrado B.,"Paramount, CA",5,8,3,1.0,2/29/2016,"The Worse Cheesecake Factory, No! The worse Restaurant I have ever attended. WARNING!!!  Stay away!!!  The Manager is a complete idiot!  He needs to get fired ASAP if they want to be in business for a longer time. Very rude!  Just a complete Moron!!!  5 hour wait when we saw at least 10-15 tables available for immediate use.  Very poor ""management skills"" if he even had any. Thin White dude in his mid 30s. He needs to go!!!!  Everyone I know is boycotting this place!!!!  Until he is gone."
Tiffany B.,"Torrance, CA",30,37,318,1.0,11/11/2015,"Writing this review as I stand near the hostess area checking on my wait time once again. I was told over an hour ago that it would be a 30 min. wait for two. The service is lackluster to say the least and I haven't even been seated. I'll dine this time, but I will never return. This is simply ridiculous."
Yesennia A.,"San Diego, CA",117,5,,5.0,5/19/2016,"Received amazing service from our server Benedict!!!!!!  Impressed with the attentiveness to our party, even though it seemed to be a very busy night."
Leydy F.,"Bell, CA",53,58,11,2.0,3/8/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory always been one of my favorite restaurants, so when I realized they've opened one closer to me I was happy. But, what disappointed! Not at the service, customer service was ok... but I went for coffee and desert with my friend and the coffee was disgusting. No flavor of coffee whatsoever. Tasted like tap water with some chemical. What a waste of my money. Then as I was eating my slice of cheesecake, the fork had dried lettuce on the back of it. Totally not coming back. We were seated at the patio, which was nice. But otherwise nothing special about this place."
Cheyenne P.,"Los Alamitos, CA",143,112,108,2.0,1/28/2016,"Came here on a Friday night for my friend's birthday dinner, of course they don't take reservations so we had to sit and wait for 40 minutes. We were seated all the way in the back where the mall and restaurant are connected.. Knew right then and there we weren't going to have proper service. Our first waitress was great, then the girl at another table took care of us because our first waitress was off work. We were seriously there for 2+ hours, mainly sitting waiting around for majority of the time. Refills lagged and were basically nonexistent and of course the bill was expensive. Not the best."
Kristina B.,"Long Beach, CA",88,5,5,2.0,2/5/2016,"Very slow service. My appetizer came out with the entrées. My veggies were burnt. I'm sure it's because this place is fairly new, but still"
Kate L.,"Cerritos, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/24/2016,Food was great but customer service SUCKS. Not only was the wait long but my server barely came to check on us and forgot a couple of orders.
Alma P.,"Biloxi, MS",124,56,19,1.0,1/9/2016,"I recently visited your Cheesecake Factory twice this week (jan 7 & 8th) my experiences were night and day.  We had a pleasent experience dining in, there was a situation that was easily rectified by a manager (male white, heavy set, about 5'11"") grey hair. He notified us that our food was made the wrong way and he rectified the situation by informing us that our food would be out shortly and that if there was anything he could do let him know. It was fine, we waited a while longer and they finally brought out our food, mind you not at the same time. I had to request for my husbands food after they handed me my food. They brought it out minutes later, it wasn't how he ordered it but it was fine because he could just add the mayo. Needless to say customer service was up to par for a busy night on January 7th, 2016.  However I went back the next day to order two low carb cheesecakes to go at the dessert counter and when I ot home to eat they they were frozen! I was highly upset and called to speak to a manager. I spoke to G**** and he asked if he could replace them. I said yes and he said he would give me an extra cheese cake for the inconvenience. I went back the next day and spoke to G******, he wanted the frozen cheese cakes back. I was shocked because I'd Thrown them away and knowing they would be replaced the next day. I told him that I would not be going back a third time just to go dig in my trash to find him two dirty cheesecakes. He said he wouldgive me one but I said no, I want both because I paid for both and they were the same thing two frozen low carb cheese cakes, I'd  understand if they were different but they were not. We went back and forth for about 5 minutes, until he said hold on ill see what I can do. He walked away and for 2 minutes and came back to notify me that he'd This was a horrible experience! I just really wanted a delicous low carb cheese cake and it turned out to be a nightmare. It was as if he thought I was dishonest and would not give me my money or cheese cakes back until I give him the originals back. That's rediculous! I am at the point where I am very upset and don't even want to eat my cheesecakes anymore. I do not want to go back, I'd prefer to have my money refunded and Mail the cheesecakes back in a bag. This was too much of a fight to try to enjoy cheesecake it wasn't worth it.  Overall this place is too much of a hype, the food is great but the service is for the price is not up to par."
Bonnie S.,"Garden Grove, CA",14,54,7,2.0,3/20/2016,So ordered a turkey burger with cheese and dry please.  Also French fries.  So first attempt the burger comes loaded.

Ria P.,"Artesia, CA",2,39,5,1.0,12/27/2015,"Worst Cheesecake Factory ever! When we first arrived they said an hour for a party of 5, after an hour passed we followed up on our reservation and they said an hour more. There are more than enough open tables to seat everyone but not enough servers. This place is poorly managed and the hostess tried to continuously ignore us when we would continue to ask for the wait time.  I would rather drive the extra 15 minutes to Anaheim's location and receive better service. This location is not worth the trouble. HORRIBLE !!!"
Pamela J.,"Long Beach, CA",2,25,1,1.0,12/23/2015,"omg is there a no star option??? close this place and re-open when the staff is properly trained, the food is edible, and the items on the menu are available! no turkey if any kind!  no buffalo wings!  no proecco!  40 mins. for sparkling water!  20 mins.  for two beers!  lettuce wraps cold, horrible, and returned!  water refills?  when?   the only thing our party of six did not wait for was a seat which we should have declined! this meal was so absolutely awful i could not wait to post this until tomorrow!   if you are at the mall eat anywhere else!!!  if you come to the mall eat before you arrive!"
Heather M.,"Norwalk, CA",17,5,3,3.0,12/31/2015,My friend and I were so excited to see the Cheesecake Factory was finally coming to Cerritos! Last night we decided to finally go and dine there. First off yes the mall was crowded which led us to believe the wait would be a little longer. However for a party of two we waited 50 minutes to be seated. Ridiculous. Seeing that we had to go up and ask them when we were up and low and behold magically we were next..(funny how that works out. I think we were skipped or forgotten) but still we give credit due to them being busy. We go to get seated and we are seated out on the atrium and they try to seat us at a tiny table with NO room to be comfortable at all seeing that the wall is halfway through the table area which limits your seating. We kindly ask to be moved. And the hosted totally does.  Once situated at the new table I look down and I'm kinda disturbed that the utensils are just placed directly on the table and not on a clean napkin.   So let's get down to the nitty gritty. And the truth of it all. Our waiter Marcos was absolutely and I mean absolutely amazing. Not only was he honest about him trying foods he was very attentive to us. He made us feel as though we were his only table. Even though he had many! I have food allergies and he was very quick to answer my questions and when he didn't know he ran to the kitchen to find out and was back very quickly! You can tell he loved and took pride in his job. At the end of our meal he asked us for our honest feedback. And we told him. The mushrooms were not as good as other cheesecake factories and the samosas were way over fired. The Parmesan garlic bread was alright. The avocado egg rolls were fantastic till I pulled a whole spring of rosemary out of my mouth. The salad was good and the mushroom soup was lovely.  So overall we gave him honest feed back and I'm passing it on to you all. It wasn't enough to cry to a manager about. We understand it's a new kitchen new staff and busy. I took my entree home and let me tell you. Do not order the fettuccine Alfredo unless you love oil and noodles. I had to throw it out.  So anyways if your ok with mediocre food but want super above the top service. Then I suggest that you ask for Marcos to wait on you and have patience with the kitchen. They will get better. I hope Cheesecake Factory will get in the swing of things and make the food as perfect as the service.  If I could do two start ratings I would give 5 for Marcos and his excellent service. However with food. It would be closer to a 1-2 So with that. I will give three stars because Marcos really made our dining experience awesome.
Stephannie V.,"Westchase, Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2016,"This place has really bad customer service and abnormal wait times for a party of 10! 3 1/2 hour wait is just too long, then when we finally order they were out of chicken and biscuits and pork chops! I don't recommend this place if you have a party of 10 or more."
Justin A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",42,163,12,2.0,12/14/2015,Came here since it is closer than the other locations. Between the loud construction noise of the theatre being built next door and not having several menu items this Cheesecake Factory falls short of all others and doesn't quite taste as good as the other locations I've been to
Lauren F.,"Artesia, CA",0,9,,2.0,2/5/2016,"The service here is so incredibly slow! I've been here 4 times already because I live nearby, and every time, the customer service is subpar. :( I would prefer to go out of my way to the one in brea or anaheim."
Joyce O.,"Carson, CA",1,4,,1.0,1/30/2016,Worst place ever!!! Wait time is inaccurate ! Wait time given is 45mins and it took an 1 hour and 45 mins!!! Don't brother to waste your time coming here! Totally waste of time !!!!!!!!
Raeann R.,"Tustin, CA",2,23,8,5.0,1/9/2016,"Other Then the long 1 1/2 hour it was very well worth it. Our server was Miguel he was great! very attentive he gave us great service with our refills, condiments and whatever we needed."
Vida May K.,"Long Beach, CA",225,3,,5.0,11/15/2015,"My family and I decided to have lunch here at the new Cheesecake Factory, and we had a great first visit! At first I was hesitant on coming here during a Sunday afternoon considering that it had just opened, but my experience here proved my initial opinions wrong. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated almost immediately. I guess it really depends on the time of day you come here and who is serving you. Our waitress Heather was very pleasant and constantly updated us on the status of our food. Although it was starting to get busy, our food came out in a timely fashion, so bonus points for that. Overall, the food and service were awesome, and because this location is so much closer to me, I'd definitely come back!"
