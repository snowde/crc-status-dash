Johnny J.,"Long Beach, CA",4,33,3,2.0,9/4/2017,"I FEEL SO LET DOWN BY ""THE BIG BANG THEORY""!!! My wife and I went here first time last night and it will be our last as well.  It is a big place and with that size comes large volumes of noise pollution and the restaurant has compounded the problem not only with its general design but specifically with the seating as we had to endure for our entire meal the 'first date conversation' at the table across from us. They weren't speaking loudly but because of the layout we could hear every word.  While they have an extensive menu what I ordered was not good. I had the fried catfish and the crust was bizarre, something akin to a hush puppy texture including what seemed to be onions.  Being from Louisiana that is not how you batter catfish.  Our waitress had to beg the kitchen to plate my green beans separately as they are more concerned about the 'plate aesthetic' than this customer desire not to have wet food contact what should have been crispy fish.  Very disappointing experience and I blame Sheldon for luring us to the place. He may be smart but he has no taste in food."
Vanessa L.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,2,2,2.0,12/1/2017,"I love this place but I was kind of surprised when I went to dinner last night.. I ordered chicken pot stickers and they weren't so good so I didn't finish the plate and asked to kindly exchange them for something else. So they did BUT when the bill came they weren't kind enough to exchange the price, instead I was charged for both of my appetizers."
Rene C.,"Long Beach, CA",118,130,289,4.0,2/20/2017,"The review is just for the cheesecake. My friend ordered the Banana Cheesecake while I ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was pretty good. I liked it! It was creamy too. I felt like it was a little on the heavy side so I didn't finish the cheesecake. I took it to go.  For the price, it was okay. It was about $8 for a slice of cheesecake. Hmmm... idk, it all depends on how much you like cheesecake. I'm okay with it but I don't eat much cheesecake."
Claudia G.,"Long Beach, CA",7,109,42,4.0,8/27/2017,"We had a lunch sandwich combo and a pasta dish. Everything was delicious. My clam chowder soup was to die for. For dessert we had key lime and Nutella cheesecake, they were both delicious. We had a great experience at this location except for the fact that our waiter took forever to come every single time we wanted a refill, were done with the food, or wanted the check."
Dee E.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,4,2,5.0,7/28/2017,Humberto is a great server. I will return looking for his great hospitality and the food was yummy too.
Liliana L.,"South Gate, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/11/2017,Let me start off with this is the WORST OF THE WORST after waiting 1 hour and being told the wait was only 25 minutes the food was terrible the waiters were so rude and to top off the manger needs customer service skills he was so rude and said after us waiting 45 minutes we can leave if we wanted to how can someone as a manger even say that!! He said there was nothing he can do and to top it off he smelled like weed so much that's so unprofessional i will never ever EVER EVER EVER come here again and i will make sure to share with all my friends and family to NEVER come here.
Rihana A.,"Compton, CA",40,68,69,1.0,9/4/2017,"I have tried this particular Cheesecake Factory 3 times because I want it to get better each time because I am a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. However, each time I come to this site I am more disappointed than the last. First my wheat bread was burnt after requesting a second batch it was the same. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Jambalaya(this is a staple) hmmmm I have never been so disappointed, the chicken and vegetables were burnt. Well because I am not a complainer and I was really trying I asked for more sauce, maybe the onions and the chicken were just browned and I need a little sauce. Nope I tasted burnt throughout every bite. I did send it back and did not pay. I TRIED!"
Monica K.,"Downey, CA",31,57,426,2.0,10/19/2017,"Geez, the service here is soooooo bad. I was excited to eat here because of the variety of cheesecakes and the fact that I could watch my Dodgers game. I started with my waitress being Britney and she was very nice, but immediately she handed us over to Kevin because she was leaving. Kevin was no where to be found. I did eventually get my food, but he wasn't the one to bring it. Almost a half hour went by (no, I'm not being sarcastic) so I took my drink to the bar to ask for it to be refilled and the bartender looked and acted so annoyed. If you're annoyed, imagine how I feel? I'm literally leaving my table and food to get myself my own drink. Kevin finally comes around since I'm sure word spread to him that I had left to catch my own drink. My friend asks for more water, he never came back. Right away at least and when he did, no water. He forgot I'm assuming. Since Kevin was no where to be found once again, we flagged down a different server (he was Asian, don't know his name) and my friend asked him what was in the carrot cake and he did go ask which was nice, but the second he came back we informed him that my friend is allergic to pineapple that's why we were asking and I kid you not, he rolls his eyes and goes, ""You could have just asked me that."" My friend apologizes and literally as she's ordering a different cheesecake, he walks away. It was so ridiculous we couldn't help but laugh because I almost thought we were being pranked. We finally see Kevin and inform him about the incident and all he had to say was how the server must have been busy and that we should know how it gets working with people. Although I get he was trying to be funny, it wasn't appropriate seeing as I'm considered ""people."" Long story short, service was just bad and unprofessional. Busy or not, it was unacceptable. As for my food, I got the huevos rancheros and I pretty much left most of it. My tortillas were so hard, I couldn't even cut through them. I was bummed out, but maybe it was just the item I got that wasn't good. I do like that they serve breakfast all day. I got the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake which was tasty."
Sonia S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,6,1,2.0,11/26/2017,"We go especially for the Adams peanut butter cup cheesecake, which is usually phenomenal except today when we went to the Cerritos location it really was below their standard. Maybe this location is not as good as the others."
Joe B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",5,3,,1.0,8/3/2017,Worst manager worst service... said 20 mins... 1 hour later I'm asking to be seated... Now my son who's 1 is acting up because hes getting fussy... I'm supposed to enjoy my time out? This place is terrible
Cesar G.,"Whittier, CA",24,77,31,3.0,8/24/2017,"Had a gift card so I figured I'd give this place a shot. Very nice restaurant with a small bar as well. Starter bread was a treat and very good. I ordered the cashew chicken on white rice. When I was brought my dish it was very nicely plated and looked appetizing. However, the menu described it as a spicy dish and was disappointed to taste that it was not spicy at all. Lastly, the dish was piping hot but it had a dull taste the way a frozen dinner would have. Â Due to high price and location in a mall, I will probably not be back."
Surbhi A.,"Buena Park, CA",17,89,322,4.0,1/1/2017,At first I was a bit hesitant since this location is relatively new compared to the others and had heard it didn't live upto par with the other locations. However when I went with friends this time. It was super delish and just as yummy as the first time I went.  Can I start off with that this is the first restaurant that I legit had to wait an hour for before getting seated. But it was worth it!! The food was so so delicious.  I'm going to start off with the complimentary bread n butter they serve. Haha. That stole our hearts n stomachs!! It's was so so so tasty. The butter was pure n melting into our mouths. Just perfection. A perfectly yummy complimentary item. I'm usually a fan of the white bread but at cheesecake I love their wheat bread. So soft and delish. Yummah!! Next up. Their menu is just like a little Children's book. A lot I options. I might say expensive but y'all know that going in. My friend and I shared and I'm so glad we did. Becuz the bread fills u up and I had left overs even with my half share.  I got the Louisiana chicken pasta with my friend. The sauce is perfection. The chicken is perfectly breaded and worked on top the pasta. The taste is something that u don't get tired of! I loved it. So so yummy. And all my friends tried and loved it too. Just yummmmyyy!! A must recommend if ur looking for a semi spicy sauce kick.  My other friend got a brunch item. N she said it's the best breakfast sandwich she's had. She loved it as well.  My other friend got the farafelle chicken pasta. (Don't remember full name) on the servers suggestion. She liked it but she said the sauce was too sweet n I agreed after trying. I don't like my pastas sweet.i like em with sauciness or spicy. So she wasn't as impressed with that dish.  Then we ended the night with a Reece's chocolate cake cheesecake. And that thing is pure sugar!! It's really yummy for a few bites but u must share that. I shared it with another friend but U really should share with like 4-5 ppl. A few bites is enuff. It's really tasty but really sugary. So just watch out for that.  Overall. Amazing experience. Lovely food. Great service. It's def worth coming at least a couple times a year. Loved it!!!
Scott S.,"Central LA, West Hollywood, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2017,Terrible service the hostess really needs some costumer service skills. it's a reflection from the top imo
Krysten A.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,308,284,2.0,6/18/2017,"This is the worst CF I have ever been to. The staff is friendly, but this place is soooo unorganized, which makes the service so freaking slow. I've been to CF countless times and many locations. If you go on a weekend, you're going to wait...PERIOD. I know that, everyone who has ever been knows that. But I've never waited 45 minutes for my food after I have ordered at ANY of the locations! I've never had to ask for a straw for my drink 4-5 times at any of the locations. Even before we sat down, it was seven of us in our group. We were told for a party our size, it would be an hour wait. Okay, it's only 1pm, but it's Cheesecake Factory and it is Father's Day weekend. Understandable. But we still had errands to run that day so we were willing to split our group into two. We're all paying for our own food, so it wasn't mandatory for us all to sit together. We asked for two tables and the hostess acted as if we were asking for CF to pay for all of our food! She had to get her manager and see if it was okay. They gave us some bull about how this has disrupted things in the past. What?! Yeah, if we were all paying as one party, but we made it clear that we seven ADULTS would each be paying separately. Mind you, another party came in two minutes after us and was seated for their party of eight at the same time we got our two outside tables.  We were finally seated only to wait, and wait, and wait, for out food. My cousin's order was wrong and we finally had to just leave so we could finish our shopping, and then return to pick up her food. The manager who took over when we returned to pick up my cousin's, now to go, order, had fortunately rectified the situation. But one thing is clear, I will never set food back there again!  I even left without getting Cheesecake. I always get me a to go slice when going to CF! I was THAT OVER IT!"
Leslie L.,"Artesia, CA",456,109,385,5.0,12/6/2016,"I'm really at awe and disbelief that this Cheesecake Factory has a sad 2.5 stars. I have been here multiple times and always leave happy, full and sometimes a little tipsy.  On my recent visit here I ordered they house Cabernet Sauvignon and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta with chicken. Evelyn's is so appetizing that I have even tried recreating it in my own kitchen. Their house cab is great and full-bodied. The bread that comes before my entrÃ©e always comes out warm with a few cubes of butter. I always have to stop myself so I don't ruin my appetite before my entrÃ©e.  Service is great, but there is always a long wait on weekends. Luckily, they have comfy benches and chairs inside and outside while you wait. I always have good company with me, so I don't mind the wait at all and it flies by. I will definitely be back to this Cheesecake and I hope that their Yelp review starts looking better as well."
K B.,"Compton, CA",12,63,98,2.0,6/15/2017,"Made a mistake and came here on a Sunday evening (5pm). This is the first centrally located, freeway friendly, Cheesecake Factory in this area. The location is great. It's at Los Cerritos Center near where the old Nordstrom used to be. The decor is typical Cheesecake and is nice. The servers are nice BUT the service is SLOW. As I write this I have been waiting an hour for my food. Just the food. Say nothing of the over hour wait for a table for 4. We are starving. And waiting. Â And starving. And by the way can my server please take these menus now. I'm tired of bread. We drank all of our beverages. Food please. I literally could have gone to the grocery store and bought food and cooked it faster myself. I'm 2 mos. pregnant and this hunger is a mother.  Soooo...guess what. They didn't put our order in. After walking around and tracking down any server I could find they send the manager over who informs me my order was never placed in the kitchen. Â This after I was repeatedly told it would be out soon. Â I cried at that point. You read that right. I cried. All of my anger, frustration and hunger dissipated into tears. What does a pregnant lady have to do to get some food??? So the nice manager comped our food and we only paid for drinks. But it's been over a year since this happened (pregnant lady forgot to finish this once the tears started) and I still haven't gone back. Too crowded and I just can't justify going back after that."
Frances R.,"Lakewood, CA",0,20,2,2.0,7/16/2017,"My daughter brought home two slices of cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.  My daughter and her boyfriend were sick all night throwing up from the cheesecake. We can't be the only ones who got sick yesterday (July 15, 2017) from spoiled, contaminated cheesecake."
Mel Z.,"High Rolls, NM",0,4,,4.0,1/8/2018,"Not giving 5 stars because the sweet waitstaff were showing their frustration at the crowd (there was a line just to put your name in!), and I say this after having worked in food service, so I know busy and I know tired. I also know that when you make the customer feel bad for asking for something (the little reservation buzzy thingy), that's bad business and not good service. Now that that is out of way: HOLY WOW. The food. AMAZING. The setting: sublime. I felt like it shouldn't be called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" but rather, the ""Divine Food Castle!"" The Cerritos, California location is so beautiful, I just about died. It's just as dreamy as it could possibly be. My hat is off to the designers. It's like an art deco dream in there. And the food! OMG. My food was lovely, my partner's food was fantastic. Our server, while blind in one eye, did a wonderful job of making us feel welcome, understood and cared for. He was such a delightful young man. It was a total dining experience and I will be back. I think this is my new favorite place!"
Jttt Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,112,13,5.0,9/22/2017,"I never knew that CF has a Skinnylicious menu that's very delicious. We ordered edamame, roasted artichoke, Tuscan chicken, and the vegetable salad with salmon. We asked for all dressing on the side and the vegetables were fresh and the protein was delicious. We definitely didn't order the cheesecake today but would have if they had one with 0 fat."
Geri C.,"Cypress, CA",11,318,2092,4.0,7/25/2017,"We came here for dinner after watching a movie at the Harkins theater practically next door. It's perfectly convenient. On this Tuesday evening it's not crowded. We chose to sit at the covered patio outside because it's high ceilinged, airy and spacious. The corner table was quite comfortable and roomy for our large party. The quality of food and service were as expected and familiar to regular Cheesecake Factory customers: tasty, reasonably priced and good portions food and friendly wait staff. The bottle of Ruffino Chianti was quite good. Others ordered from a good selection of draft beers including Firestone 805, Sam Adams Seasonal, Venice Duck Dogtown. Of course we ordered cheesecake for desserts. We had a good time and will visit this new addition to the Mall again."
