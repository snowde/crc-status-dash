Rhonda R.,"Covina, CA",3,1,1,1.0,4/17/2016,"The servers were nice, but my appetizers came with my meal. I had to ask for a refill on my beverage, and they forgot my brother in-laws meal entirely. That's why I prefer to go to Pasadena."
Angela M.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,26,,4.0,1/28/2016,I am surprised at the low ratings because I just had dinner with my boyfriend here and we had a great time.  I had Chicken Costeletta and my bf got Steak Diane.  The food was fantastic and our waitress is very attentive.  My only complaint is the portion is humongous but this is typical of Cheesecake Factory (which I already know from previous experience).  The atmosphere is not as fun as the CF's in Marina Del Rey or Redondo Beach but it has good vibe.  I really like the place and I came here for the food and because it is convenient (inside Cerritos mall).
K N.,"Long Beach, CA",25,157,,2.0,12/27/2015,"I ate here on the 17th for our Christmas work lunch.  I had their most popular chicken dish and it was delicious.  The mashed potatoes are heavily season with black pepper which I don't like even worse there was a piece of plastic in my mashed potatoes.  It made me think the potatoes are bagged and then cut open when needed, I got a strip of plastic.  I didn't say anything bcz I didn't want to ruin the meal for my co workers and they all seemed to enjoy their food."
M R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,1,4.0,10/16/2016,Food was delicious. Wait time reasonable. Waiters kind and attentive. Down side: restrooms were disgusting and unsanitary.
Carlos A.,"Bellflower, CA",6,1,8,1.0,6/19/2016,"I wish I can give this place half a star. First we waited over 40 minutes to get seated when we were told it would be less than 30 On top of that add another 20 before we received our entrees. Our pastas had no flavor at all. Two of which were supposed to be a basil base sauce. Tasted like the pasta had just been pulled out of boiling water and a little butter was added to it. No basil no garlic no flavor. We were told they had ran out of the sauce and that they will make more for us. Another 10 minutes went by before we got our sauce. By then the food was already cold The nice waitress offered us to get us something else but we wanted that pasta. Because we've had it before and it's a really good dish.  We asked to speak to the manager but the manager never came to our table. Instead, the manager sent our nice waitress back 15 minutes later to tell us they would give us complementary desserts. We agreed but another 10 minutes went by and no dessert so we just said scree it and left. Great attentive service by the waitress. Horrible service on the part of whoever was the manager that night, who didn't even bother to check up on us when we were told she was going to speak with us. And horrible tasteless food.  Won't ever be coming back to this location"
Alen O.,"Cerritos, CA",13,20,1,1.0,11/27/2015,Whoever designed the entrance/waiting area should be fired. Like all cheesecake factories this one has good food but your immediately frustrated the moment you walk in. The waits are ridiculous and the restaurant feels so cramped... Too bad.
Dre C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/12/2016,"Poor service...took 1 hour for food and drinks. I spoke to the manager and she again apologized, but it took another 30mins. Man what happened to good service anymore..."
Nina B.,"Long Beach, CA",289,140,4,1.0,11/8/2015,"Went in at 5pm today to reserve a table for 8 to dine at 7pm and was told to come back in an hour since they could not reserve the table for 8. However was told wait time was an hour. We still requested to  have our name put down for 8, but the host continued to refuse. Came back at 6pm and was told the wait time is 4 hours for a party of 8. Management and the same host was there. Even though my husband and I had a complaint, they would not budge. We will never come back to this dump!"
Rick M.,"Whittier, CA",0,7,2,1.0,10/11/2016,"Dinner here tonight was the worse, what makes it extra bad was that I was the one that encouraged my fiance to come here for dinner.  We get in the restaurant and I was happy to see that it wasn't busy at all. (Maybe that should have been a warning?) We sit down and order our drinks through our server DEVAN. Then order an appetizer and our entrees together. One of the drinks was taking a little too long so I called the server over and changed the beverage order. He apologized because he forgot to put it in. Then we get our entrees and while they looked very good there were no Forks in sight. I had to wave down a busser and ask for a fork, when I did he gave me the entire silverware platter to pick out whatever I needed. Is this standard service? We waited a few minutes for the appetizer to come out, I noticed our server was just joking around with 4 other coworkers and was completely oblivious to us trying to get his attention. Once he comes over I ask about the fried macaroni balls and he walks away right away and comes back a minute later and says ""they forgot to put the order in for you"". Umm.. whose ""they"" he was the server that was supposed to put it in correct. He tells us that we'll get it for free if we still want it or he can cancel the order. I personally didn't care if they were free or not, my fiance was craving them so I wanted her to have them. Finally they come out 10 minutes later and of course they are burnt and not edible. I didn't want to complain because at that point the dinner seemed like a lost cause. So I go back to eating my spicy cashew chicken and in the middle of me putting a fork full of food in my mouth our server DEVAN comes over and asks me if he can box the food for me. I give him a look like ""dude are you serious?"" He notices my look and says ""if your still working on it its fine"". I just handed him the plate n asked for the check. He asked to box the macaroni balls and I told him they ""no its ok they were burnt"", he made a sigh placed down the check book and that was that. I will never come back to this location. With as many employees on staff as I saw and as few guests that I saw there is no excuse to not be delivering exceptional service. Management at this establishment is terrible as well, should have came to our table to apologize for the inconvenience instead of allowing the kid DEVAN to continuously deliver terrible service."
Mark L.,"Lakewood, CA",89,11,,1.0,9/19/2016,"I've been to cheesecake factory once in my life and this will be my last.  We came for our uncles birthday.  It was a party of 7.  Not a large group.  They told us it would be 10 minutes to get seated.  We saw multiple other people being seated and they said they didn't have the space yet but a party of 8 was seated and they showed up after us.  About 40 minutes later we were finally seated.  Once seated we put our drink orders in.  My wife ordered a blended margarita.  When she finally got it, it had melted.  When she mentioned to the waitress that it was watery she said she could ""reblend"" it.  I am not sure what that means.  Now that we have been at the restaurant for over an hour and just got drinks we put our food order in.  I ordered chicken Alfredo and it wasn't good.  It took over a half hour to get it and it only had 5 small prices of chicken and it had no flavor.  My wife and uncle ordered steak and had to wait for a steak knife so while waiting 10 minutes they used there butter knives.  After I told the waitress I didn't want the plate she gave me menu while the rest of our party ate.  By the time she came back to get my order everyone was almost done eating.  Sad to say I live nearby and I will not be coming back.  Don't come with high expectations if you come here.  Hopefully management can do something to improve the experience here."
Kimberly C.,"Bellflower, CA",11,3,,1.0,3/19/2016,"I was just here and HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I checked in and they girl said it would be about an hour wait! Well the hour was up and still my table wasnt ready. I went to the girl in the front and she said the wait was about 1 hr to an hour and a half, so i had to wait another 30 min. I was so upset. I just left! I doubt I will return to this location!"
Thylyn H.,"Lakewood, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/18/2016,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about regarding this location. We ate here on a Sunday afternoon and the service was outstanding. Sarah was excellent, kind, considerate, and alert even though we had a very large party. I also observed other guest receiving great service. One couple was ready with their check, but their server had just stepped into the kitchen area. Immediately another server caught it and politely offered to deliver it for her. A++++++"
Mariana L.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",74,22,11,2.0,12/11/2015,"I have gone to this location..twice only. I'm giving the benefit of the doubt because it's a brand new location and they're still learning. Everyone is new. So I understand that things won't be perfect. On our first visit they were still training people. They forgot to give us utensils when our food came. They didn't refill drinks and well the bread came so late. On our second visit they said the wait time was going to be ""an hour and 45 minutes"" I was like ""I'm sorry did you just say an hour and 45 minutes?"" She said yes. I thought I misheard her. Lol anyway the wait was an hour. I hope they get better :) I don't mind waiting but just please bring me utensils lol I'm giving the benefit of the doubt there is still plenty of room for growth."
S B.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,110,95,5.0,3/4/2016,A very nice restaurant! I always love the cheesecake and the food is great! Great service too.
Mani M.,"Paramount, CA",4,20,14,1.0,11/13/2015,"Our waitress was nice but my GOD are they slow as molasses , Friday the 13th and the power went out lmao, food was mediocre at best because it was only hot on the top. We got seated around 10:15 , got our food around 10:50 we're still waiting on our bill... oh the power came back on!!!!.... oh wait it went off again... oh wait, its back on... its now 11:48 and I'm pissed now. Please get it together FAST. Lol the staff isn't fully focused yet. I just took a star away cuz this is RIDICULOUS!!!!"
Kate L.,"Cypress, CA",13,10,,1.0,11/10/2015,"I don't really give bad reviews but I was so disappointed I had to write one. Dinner was bad, service was bad, even their drinks sucked. My husband's drink was so bad he thought it was a wrong order. Asked for a replacement and turns out it was the right one, bartending FAIL. I would rather drive to the one in HB. This location totally traumatized me."
Ronald C.,"Compton, CA",51,44,1,5.0,2/15/2016,Went on Valentine's day and had a wonderful meal. Our server Shannon was busy yet veryattentive to our needs. It was worth the wait.
Tony G.,"Inglewood, CA",8,7,,2.0,11/23/2015,The food was great but the service was terrrible. Hostess had us wait 10 minutes next to the table while they sought for some one to clear it. Waitress had to do it herself. Restaurant  recently opened and it seems as if they are working out the kinks.
Deanna F.,"Buena Park, CA",3,20,,1.0,11/18/2015,"If I could give less than one star, I would! We came for a birthday and I have never been more disappointed! Not only was management exceptionally RUDE, but half of our party ended up with food poisoning that night! My nieces sweet 16 was ruined. I've reached out to corporate as well, and just no response..clearly this franchise doesn't care about customers or their experience at their restaurants. Will NEVER be back."
Lilyanne G.,"South Gate, CA",5,35,10,4.0,2/28/2016,"I've been here a couple times since its recent opening and this place is always full! It's the only location within this area so I understand. Although busy, so far service has still been good. The outdoor patio is a nice cozy place to have a nice meal/drinks. I've sat at the bar the other times (to skip the wait)."
