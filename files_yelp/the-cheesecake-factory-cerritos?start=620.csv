Allison V.,"Long Beach, CA",2,7,10,1.0,11/8/2015,"This place is terrible. Waited 40 mins for the food to come out cold. After they took my food back to remake it.. unfortunately my Steak Diane came out to be Rare, when I wanted Medium Rare. Like, thanks for wasting my time and energy. Even my girlfriend finished her food before I could even have anything to eat. Man, I don't care if you guys just opened, you guys should be prepared for a dinner rush. Your food should be consistent and BOMB. Get your shit together please. Also, a complimentary cheesecake shouldn't be the only factor at making a customer happy. Unlike others, you cant buy my loyalty through a free dessert. Sorry. Not Sorry. ALSO, Their should be communication between the manager and the customer, when a customer isn't satisfied. Obviously customers want to know what went wrong and as to why their food took too long, cooked incorrectly, cold, etc."
Jessica M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,14,,4.0,12/16/2015,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory, I have been to this specific location a couple times. Loved the food. But I have a couple issues. They need to manage the waiting a lot better.  Sometimes it seems they forget about certain parties, because both times I have gone, i was with a party of three, both times they seated people who came in AFTER us, and they either were couples or small parties, and there was obviously tables able to filled. Its like they skipped us. I think they should use what other restaurants do and do call ahead seating,  especially for such a big time restaurant. Waiting is crazy there. My other issue is the food. First time, wasn't bad food was amazing. Second time, the bread took a while to come out, then the waitress didn't check on us as often (though it was busy for a Tuesday and she had bigger tables to manage so i will let it slide.) Next my mom's plate came first, hot and declicious, my plate and my dad's took longer to come out, all of our dishes should have come at similar times not ten minutes apart.  And ontop of that, my dad's food eneded up being cold, he got the steak tacos. The tacos, the beans and rice were all like they had been sitting out for a while. We told the waitress and she got him a new plate. He got a small ceasar salad as a sorry basically. He got his new plate, but the rice was still meh, everything else was hot and good. My dad couldn't even eat his meal because we had to wait so long for the foos he got full off the bread (they need a new bread choice) and salad. Everyone else's dishes were good.  I feel like they should of have comped our meal or something more than some small salad. Other than those things, this place is still good, and has amazing cheesecake."
Melissa R.,"Artesia, CA",289,61,8,1.0,12/20/2015,"For two decades, I've always ordered the bistro shrimp pasta. Today 12/20/15, I decided to order the combo chicken madeira and steak diane. The steak diane states that it has a mushroom sauce. And then below it the hibachi steak explicitly states it has shiitake mushrooms. I'm allergic to shiitake mushrooms. Having waited some time, I took two bites of my steak diane. As I looked at my medallions, I noticed the mushrooms were a mix of button, but mainly shiitake! I'm now sitting here waiting for my new order as I slowly itch with pain. I even ran to the bathroom to check if I was getting a rash, but there is no where in the restaurant that has bright enough lighting to check. My mother has offered me her meatloaf five times now. The restaurant's menu must be changed! Will be calling corporate."
He M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,1,3.0,2/24/2016,"On a weekday for lunch, there weren't many customers at the restaurant, but yet our orders were messed up! We did not order a lemonade for our little baby and one was brought to us and I told the waiter it was not ours and he took it back. They forgot the other half of our order (salad) with our pizza. The Parmesan eggplant was quite salty. The avocado eggrolls were good with the green sauce, but very tangy (vinegar) without it. The stuffed mushrooms were decent (left me wondering how many calories or sticks of butter the put in them because my lips were glossy!) The outside seating were nice and enjoyable. We saw many employees come in to work and still they got our orders wrong. We won't be here during busy hours. Most likely to-go if anything."
Zakiya C.,"Compton, CA",1,16,8,3.0,2/23/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but this one is sub-par. Really busy, servers don't really know what they are doing. Dynamite shrimp was mushy and when they re-made it they were over-cooked."
R C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",21,128,231,1.0,12/18/2015,"Ordered food to go here last night and it was terrible.  The pasta had no sauce & the salad was the smallest I've ever seen.  Literally a $1 salad st Wendy's is bigger!  I've been to this new location one other time & understand they are working out the kinks, but this quality was terrible.  Called to tell them about my order mishap and spoke w/Gabriel the manager.  His response, there's nothing they can do. This  location is a joke compared to other locations. I would think they would be in better shape as far as food and service go by now... Not sure I'll return."
Julia F.,"Artesia, CA",13,12,37,1.0,11/11/2015,I had such a horrid experience we waited 15-20 min for drinks!!! The waiter didn't even bring water!!! The I ended up getting entree before the appetizers then we simply didn't get the appetizers. The I had to flag down q buss boy for a plates!! It was just a horrid experience!!
Celest V.,"Norwalk, CA",63,64,22,1.0,12/27/2015,"Horrible service , we had to request a different waiter. They run out of everything. The food is taste less and overpriced. The best thing to do is order cheesecake to go. The line is definitely not worth the wait, you will only be disappointed with the food and Service you get. This place Needs to get it together."
Israel G.,"Long Beach, CA",61,10,1,1.0,2/21/2016,"I didn't believe all the bad reviews this place has gotten... It's bad! If you're hungry, go elsewhere.  I want to say the kitchen is at fault, but our waitress was really bad.  Hardly checked on us and it took her 15 minutes to get her to charge our card... Manager really needs to get this place rolling.  Food wise, we all know Cheesecake Factory is delicious..."
Alex V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/21/2016,Worse customer service ever  some waitress with short hair named jessica messed up on my order and when i asked for a box they took my food and boxed it them selves which is okay but the fact that when i came home and only found 6 fries in my box really pisses me off. Please fire jessica the girl with the short hair she is lazy and tries to act nice just for tips smfh. And i even tiped this miley cyrus looking person $16.14 like wth please fire this woman she is just gonna make your buisness worse than it is
Arcy A.,"Montclair, CA",14,8,,1.0,7/9/2016,"Well if anyone is working their butt of here it's the manager with all the complimentary free deserts. I thought my experience was unique because our server just disappeared! She apparently got sick and had to leave. What was unusual was that all her other tables were getting attended except mine. Anyway, food was nothing special, the avocado rolls were good. SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CPK INSTEAD."
Tonbara Y.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,2,1.0,11/10/2015,"I took my best friend out for her birthday and was excited to try out the new restaurant. When we got here to an 8pm dinner on on a Tuesday we were told it was a 35 minute wait. Within 15 minutes we checked in and they asked us if we had a pager. They didn't give us one so we had to wait an additional 15 minutes. When it came to the order, the food was cold, it took an hour to arrive and to add insult to injury, the birthday girl was told that what she ordered ran out 30 minutes after the order and did not inform us until everyone else's food came. Overall, the service was poor and I was severely disappointed."
Tommy L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/25/2016,"So I went on yelp and saw all the terrible reviews for this place and decided to write my own review. I've never been here before in my life. But ewww bad customer service, ewww long lines, ewww didn't refill my water cup, ewww food was bland. Listen to these people and go eat somewhere else fool!"
Scott Z.,"Cypress, CA",31,16,3,3.0,4/17/2016,"The food and service was great.  However, one of my gift cards did not work. This restaurant was located at the Cerritos mall so after lunch my wife and kids looked around at some of the stores, but I took a seat and called Cheesecake Factory gift card number and found out the card that she swiped was actual swiped twice that is why my server thought one of the cards did not work.  Luckily, I checked the other cards and one of them still had $25 on the card.  I went back into the restaurant to get my $25 cash for the card.  Getting my $ took about 15 minutes, that is because the server had to go back and forth to me and the manager.  The server messed up, but this is something the manager should of handled directly with me. He never came out to speak with me.  I would have given 5 stars, but the manager failed."
Vic M.,"Cerritos, CA",4,23,6,1.0,1/18/2016,They don't accept reservations for dinner. Not a good thing if you have a real big group.
Gwen H.,"Lakewood, CA",125,11,6,3.0,2/15/2016,"First time eating here ( I have been to at least 10 CF's all across the country).  We were so excited that they opened right around the corner.  Came on President's Day at 3:30 and it was busy but not as crazy as Cheesecake's can get.  We sat at a high top in the bar, it took 15 minutes just to be greeted.  Our bread came with no utensils then I had to ask for napkins and we waited 5 minutes for those.  The ladies room was a mess and the restaurant overall did not seem as clean as it should be from the floors to fingerprints on windows and areas that should shine.  The staff seemed to not know what was going on, I saw owners going to wrong tables more than once.  I was not impressed with this dining experience at all."
Michelle G.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/22/2015,"After a long hour wait we finally got seated to our table then ordered right away.The waiter served a complimentary bread and butter basket which wasn't very satisfying.The prices are pretty great.The portions are huge. I ordered the four cheese penne pasta,as a lunch size.It came in a very big bowl.And it wasn't very good.I ordered a delicious salad and just put the pasta aside.We took a slice of red velvet cheesecake.It was very satisfying!At the end the only food items I would recommend would be the red velvet cheesecake and the ceaser salad."
Jim C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/29/2016,I should have trusted the other reviews. Terrible service. We had to ask several times just to get our water. Waitress had terrible attitude when she finally remembered to bring water. I have had enjoyable experience at other cheesecake factory locations but this place is not the same.
Lilly C.,"Norwalk, CA",253,82,47,5.0,11/8/2015,"Kristin at the bar was super friendly! She made the first visit feel very welcoming! I made it a point to share the experience with her was great because it does depend on who you get! Food was on point,cheesecake made the night end with a sweet taste! All her suggestions were good,and I love sitting at the bar. No wait,overall good experience!"
Eric B.,"Long Beach, CA",2,2,,1.0,12/29/2015,Super mad that people can't listen. I ordered a Cobb salad at the restaurant for to go and said no cheese. Something so simple. I took the salad home and ate it a couple of hours later. I noticed a weird taste and Yep they kept the cheese on it and it was already mixed when I opened it. I'm allergic to cheese and so of course I'm mad. I called the restaurant and they said they couldn't do anything about it bc I was there around 4pm and I called at 7pm. UMMM that's bc I didn't eat it till 7pm.
