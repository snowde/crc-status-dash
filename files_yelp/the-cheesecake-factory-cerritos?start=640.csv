Najah C.,"Long Beach, CA",132,50,94,3.0,2/4/2016,"It's hard to rate 3 stars only because I really love the Cheesecake Factory, but this place is new and haven't worked out the kinks yet. I've been here 6 times now and bread is hard to come by! Don't know what the issue is with that but if you can get some it may not be fresh. The service just depends on who you get I guess because I've had exceptional service and that one terribly inattentive service where you can't even get your drinks refilled. I had issues with my food coming out cold and management inadequately correcting the issue. All in all I will try this place again for lunch when it's not so busy because it's the closes one to me."
Mark C.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,68,2,4.0,11/10/2015,"I've been here 2 times so far. Recently stopped in for a drink in the bar.  Small bar, but good service from the bar tender. Food here is good, service has been good thus far. Very crowded because there are not very many places like this in Cerritos. Will be returning for sure."
J J.,"Artesia, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Ive been here 3 times.... 2 times there was a hair in my food the third time there was a metal from one of the ""pans"" or something from what the manager said. So here I am trying this location one more time against my better judgement. I called on Thursday regarding reservations. They don't take reservations, but said on a Saturday for a large party the wait would be about 1 1/2 hours. I show up and they tell me 4 hours. They won't give me a pager, but told me to come back in an hours then she might be able to give me a pager at that time. Makes no sense to me. How can you give other parties pagers after me and tell them 35 min wait but you can't give me one and make a table for a party of 12? I feel like they would rather turn large parties away then to make reservations or to try to have good customer service and accommodate us. This location is way too small for where it's at and definitely needs to work on a lot of things. I will not be coming back again."
Melina G.,"Bellflower, CA",31,31,14,5.0,11/5/2015,"So this place is new and i understand that the employees are still learning the menu, as a past waitress I get it. Anywho, the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake here is super good! And the staff is super friendly. Will go again soon. (:"
Heidi C.,"Downey, CA",12,16,28,1.0,10/9/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. This location has failed me numerous times. The taste you have become accustomed to is not found at this location.  Flavors are not consistent bringing me to believe they're not using the recipes we all love. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for my daughter and I (our favorite appetizer) very disappointed with the taste of poultry seasoning in the stuffing an ingredient I've never tasted in the stuffed mushrooms before. I ordered to go on another occasion my favorite entree Steak Diane I got home and started to eat it, the steak tasted rancid. I put it away and had my husband try it the next day and he threw it out saying there was something definitely wrong with it. I wanted him to taste it thinking maybe it was my taste but apparently not. The cheesecake is also always changing flavor even though it's the same name on the menu. I will return to the Huntington Beach location even though the drive sucks, if I'm going to spend $125 for dinner I want to be able to eat what I pay for."
L. S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,2,4.0,9/15/2016,"I've been here a few times for lunch and overtime we've had such friendly waiters! The place is clean, food arrived in good time, and the wait time has never been long. Happy to have a cheesecake not too far from home. Love this place for lunch :)"
Myshia C.,"Carson, CA",1,29,18,1.0,2/21/2016,"Ok this is another time ive been here and this is horrible. We waited 1 hr and then   My waitress was loreina was a mess and very unattentive. We couldn't even get our refills on drinks, food was cold and i had to send it back 3 times before  i finally said just take it off my bill. When we spoke to the manager the best excuse for the bad service and bad food was ""Sunday is our worst day"" Really that how professional they are? My reply should have been the same Sunday is my worst day so i don't have money to waste on bad service. 85.00 later the best we got was a free slice of cheesecake and then had to wait for that. Never will i go back to this one. Ever!!!! Other tables had the same problems and after speaking to other patrons they said the same. Never again. If i could give no stars then i would have."
Angie O.,"Long Beach, CA",1,14,,2.0,11/6/2015,I had Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and ceasar salad. Salad was great like other locations. But my Alfredo sauce had me nauseous the whole night. I know it was that. Service was ok. I'll change my rating when I go again. It'll be in a couple months most likely.    Best part the servers placed my plates correctly and neat.
Erin B.,"Seal Beach, CA",2,140,1,3.0,7/29/2016,"The food has been good both times we've been. The service has been friendly although sloooooooow. The thing that bothers me most is that it doesn't look or feel clean. Sticky table both times. Dirty silverware. Dirty seats and floors. The floor last night had so much crap on it (old food, a spoon) that I didn't want to sit down. The girl who seated us pretended not to notice even after I pointed it out. Others have commented on the dirty silverware too, so it's not just me. Hopefully the kitchen is cleaner? Will probably just come for cheesecake takeout in the future."
Kimyetta J.,"Las Vegas, NV",91,11,7,1.0,12/19/2015,"Came here for my cousins birthday, it was a huge disappointment. We called in the early afternoon and was told to arrive 1 hour before our chosen time, however when we arrived at 7pm  we were told it would be 11pm before we could be seated. Basically said we were lying about calling because anyone answering the phone would have said they don't put you on a list until you arrive. Birthday ruined general manager James was uncaring nonchalant and did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation."
T C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/8/2016,I was very unimpressed with the service... this place needs new management they fell way short of expectations in my opinion. I'm so use to better service when coming to cheese cake factory this place is like a circus with a bunch of lost monkeys running around lost! my first and last time coming to this location i will not be coming back.
Brandi M.,"Gardena, CA",66,8,6,2.0,12/5/2015,Service was terrible my daughter's birthday we waited 35 minutes and no one ever came out to sing happy birthday and the manager was on attentive when I made my complaint I will be calling the corporate office and I would never visit this location ever
Debbie J.,"Cerritos, CA",41,135,247,2.0,11/8/2015,"Since they are new, I don't want to be mean on the review.  Maybe I will give them 5 stars after they get their routines straighten out.  We waited almost an hour for our table.  I specifically asked for indoor since the wait for both patio and indoor is the same.  Finally the buzzer was buzzing.  Gave the buzzer to the front desk and still had to wait five minutes for the hostess to seat us.  Then, she leads us to the outdoor patio, which is fine because it is not as noisy as it is inside.  But, we were seated directly at the sun.  We had to ask someone to move the umbrella to block the sun.  It's difficult to enjoy the food with hot sun shining on your back.  I knew it was going to take long so when the server finally came to ask for our drink order, I went ahead and placed the food order.  Don't know why it took so long to get our water.  I had the chicken piccata and that is my usual dish, so I knew it didn't taste right. The taste was really bland. The sour dough bread was tough.  I will definitely come back in a few months and give them another try.  The location is perfect since it is inside the mall."
Ryan A.,"Buena Park, CA",126,4,5,1.0,2/15/2016,"Horrible management. My family and I were kicked off a table because one of the staff misinformed us that it was self seating (in the bar area). Young manager came over and properly informed us that it is on a waitlist. Instead of trying to fix the embarrassing situation he simply said sorry. Who trained this guy? Make the customer happy and fix it instead of shrugging it off. Get your staff on the same page because I have come here before and self sat at the exact same table. Staff is friendly but severely undertrained. Past experiences have been below average. Strike 3 Cerritos Cheesecake Factory, you're out."
Leslie D.,"Long Beach, CA",31,7,3,1.0,9/27/2016,"I will never ever go to this Cheesecake Factory ""EVER"" again! I went to them back in February 2016 it was a horrible experience I thought because they were kind of new that there'd get it together.But I was so wrong the service was worse then the first! We get there know one greats us after 10mins of waiting we walk up and ask for a table then we're seated.The waitress sit use down asked what we wanted to drink never offered any butter are bread and we did not see her for another 15mins she comes back we ask for for bread and I got a drink from the bar it was watered down with ice I payed $15 for a watered down drink. When the food finally came the kids got there's first  we wait longer they  we're almost finished when they brought our Luke warm meatloaf dishes they forgot the side of make and cheese me and my daughter took little bites of the food that's how we now the food was barely warm then we ask to see the manager he brings our plates back 15mins later on different plates with the same food but rearranged on new hot burning plates  and garnishes to cove up the little bites on the parts we had sampled the food was a little warmer but need more heat so we ask for the manger again and here come the same man to our table and didn't even introduce himself as the manager when he came with the so called fresh "" replace food"" . So this time he says his names is Chris the manager and we tell him this is the same food that we had and he argued us down that he seen the chief slice fresh meatloaf and that the veggies were made fresh to order but I pointed out the piece of asparagus that I bit previously and he's gonna say I'll give you a slice of Cheesecake that pissed me off more I'll never return to that place again I'll go to one in another area"
Michael F.,"Cerritos, CA",1,65,4,2.0,7/24/2016,"I write this review after having eaten there 3 times, the most recent today. The first time we ate there it was the week of the opening and had a very bad experience with the speed of the servers and time for the food to get out. We figured it was the first week and that they would work out the problems. The second time we gave once again the server had an attitude of some kind, it wasn't until we had to ask for the manager that we were able to have a nice server who took care of us, the food still took awhile but it was great. Today we figured we would go in at 11:00 so it would not take as long to get our food or have a better chance of having better service, WRONG!!! We were seated within 5 minutes, but it took the server 10 minutes to get us a chocolate milk and my oj. Really 10 minutes to have drinks? The server never apologized for the time it took. We once again asked for the manager who was really nice and apologized. We had a new server, but it still took 20 minutes to get our food out (after the manager told us he would ""rush"" our order). It sadly appears this was the last and final time for our local Cheesecake Factory. We really wanted to like this place, the food has ALWAYS been good, but the lack of training of the servers will be its downfall. We hope that HQ does something about this."
Stephanie B.,"Bellflower, CA",18,5,1,5.0,12/13/2015,I love this location! Of all the times I've been there I have had the best service! There was only one time that my service was mediocre and I didn't tip him. He was inattentive and wasn't a very good listener. Overall that was my only complaint. They are a new business in the mall but I'm very happy with it and my food when I go. :)
Christian P.,"Downey, CA",0,5,1,1.0,11/14/2015,"Got here at 2pm, waiting time they said 30 minutes, 1 hour and still waiting, this is ridiculous, BJ's and Olive Gardens is right around the corner.  This place just opened its doors for business, this is not the right way to treat customers. Definitely not coming back here EVER!"
Marissa O.,"Long Beach, CA",10,23,11,1.0,11/24/2015,"It's hurts me to give The Cheesecake Factory a 1 star, but this was by far the WORST experience I have ever received from this chain.  Okay, I get that this restaurant just opened, but honestly was any training given?!  Tons of staff standing around looking lost and confused.  We went for our daughters birthday (her choice) but having to pay $130 for bland food is just heart breaking.  The food had no taste and wasnt even what was described on the menu.  It almost seemed that the cooks just whipped up their own recipe.  I should have just cooked at home! Typically a place will make up for poor food with their awesome service... but this location didn't get that far in training... it's a shame."
Amanda R.,"Downey, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/21/2016,"I came to eat with a friend and I've never had a complaint about cheesecake factory until I came to this location. Our server took our order, dropped off drinks, and never came back to our table. We waited 30 minutes for drink refills and she never came. However, we did see her standing around, talking to her coworkers. We were very unhappy with the service. We finally had to ask the server at the next table for refills. He got them for us and then told us he was going to be taking care of us instead of our original server. He was really nice and restored our faith in the service. After that we were highly satisfied. The next day my friend and I were both throwing up. So I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager just to let him know. I even told him I'm not blaming the food, I just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it happens to other people, maybe it's something they should look into. He rudely told me ""we serve hundreds of people everyday and they never get sick"" I told him ""I'm not complaining, I'm just making you aware of what happened"" and his response was ""okay thank you, bye"" and hung up on me. I didn't expect a manager to be so rude, especially when I was very nice about the whole situation. Needless to say I will not be returning. And I will be calling corporate to let them know how poorly their management treats guests."
