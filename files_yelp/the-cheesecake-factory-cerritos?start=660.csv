Michelle O.,"Cerritos, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/22/2016,i was so excited when i heard they were opening a cheesecake factory in cerritos since I usually had to go to the OC for the next closest one. I was a sadly a little let down. service wasn't the beast and parking is ridiculous.i had no silverware and had to wait a long time until they brought it. it just seems a little disorganized in comparison to the ones ive been too. hopefully its just because they're still new.
Sue B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,34,8,4.0,2/7/2016,"I can happily say that service is now smooth and I am a happy diner. Or at least I can say so for a Thursday lunch seating at noon it is ;) the restaurant wasn't packed but the service, food and cheesecake were all good this time. Our waitress Christyn(or Khrystin)was very attentive and followed up with us many times. I was well pleased. Well done Cheesecake Factory :]"
Erin M.,"Downey, CA",49,11,,1.0,10/3/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would. We waited almost 3 hours for our party of 18, after being told our wait would be 90 minutes.  We finally just called BJ's (our 4 kids couldn't wait anymore) and they (bjs) was able to seat us within 5 minutes."
Sharona K.,"Long Beach, CA",7,5,,1.0,12/11/2015,"Horrible service! The orders were wrong, the food came out cold and it took forever! Complaining to the staff is pointless. An umbrella even fell on our table and we still couldn't get a manager to check on us. There are better places to go!"
Damaris P.,"Long Beach, CA",9,51,63,2.0,12/28/2015,"I was.lookimg forward to trying this location out. I've been to different locations and have enjoyed it. The service here is extremely slow, we waited over 20 minutes just to order food! The food was not anything worth bragging about. We ordered the Buffalo bites and the Chipotle chicken pasta (didn't have a Chipotle taste at all). I might go and try another dish but not anytime soon."
Marisol L.,"Norwalk, CA",0,7,5,2.0,8/7/2016,"Usually we get good service... Today not at all! We were a party of 5 and waited about an hour. That's ok for weekend dining. I ordered water w/lemon, never got the lemon.  We ordered appetizers and never got them. Then when we get our meals, the sever forgot to order mine.  The manager came to apologize and I got a small salad while I waited. I was still patient because I thought maybe he's overwhelmed or something. I was a waitress for many years so I let things go sometimes...... But what made me write this review is when we finally get our bill about 20 minutes after I asked for it, I see the appetizer charge which we never got! I was really upset and asked to speak to the manager. She obviously knew about the server forgetting my dinner because she came to apologize earlier and now this. She left and came back and took out the appetizer fee. Honestly with the manager having to come more then once to the same table, a courtesy discount should of been given to us! I think we will continue to take that extra drive to Anaheim so we don't deal with this kind of service or management!"
Sonia P.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,28,8,1.0,8/7/2016,The avocado egg rolls were terrible.  The avocado was mushed up and citrusy..... It tasted more like a guacamole egg roll.   Overall.... It was too expensive and we didn't feel the quality matched the price.   Very disappointed - would not return.
Diana Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"Despite the bad reviews, my husband and I decided to go here because we had a gift card and it was close to home-- bad idea. The service was terrible. You could tell the waitress must hate her job. Right from the get-go she didn't look like she wanted to be there. She took our drink orders (a mojito and 2 waters). First, it took forever to get our drinks. When she finally does, it's the mojito, bread basket, but no waters. How does that sense? She says she'll be right back but it must have taken at least another 8-10 minutes to get us our WATERS! Throughout the entire evening she was inattentive. I had to ask her every single time if she could refill, once again, my water. When our food came, we didn't even have any silverware on our place and had to wait till she finally decided to show her face (someone else dropped off the food). The food on the other had did not disappoint, but this waitress truly needs to get another job because she just ruined any chance of me going here again. I'd rather take the extra drive and go to the one in Anaheim. I never deal with service like this there."
Big B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,7,5.0,11/13/2015,All I can say is yummy with a capital y chicken stuffed tortilla was so bomb hot and creamy tamale cakes were a lil sweet and nice and soft with a perfect sear good job cheesecake factory
Iman M.,"Long Beach, CA",105,3,,1.0,1/16/2016,"I placed a phone order at 915pm on a Saturday, they said ready for pickup in 20 mins, I arrived at 940pm,  little extra time understanding it's a Saturday night, when I arrived I waited another 20 mins to pay and another 15 mins to receive my food. That is unacceptable. It's called a TO GO ORDER for a reason so you're quickly paying and out ASAP. Get your stuff straight because I'm going to continue going to Huntington Beach as I have for the past several years, but I thought I'd be nice and try this location, but never again.  To top it all of, THE FOOD WAS ENTIRELY COLD. Waste of $30+"
Nik R.,"Long Beach, CA",7,42,29,1.0,7/17/2016,"Let me start off by saying I Love the one in Pasadena . The Cerritos location not so much. This is the spot my daughter picked to For her 19th dinner party. It was like any other day in sunny California-and my expectations were too damn High! The lady in front, didn't catch her name  on her shirt,  She was Asian, cute, and very pleasant and accommodating. Love her personality. So we finally get seated. And we wait ! ----and wait --- and wait !! WTF I'm 5'9 and fat I know damn well I'm not invisible! There are 6 of us how the fuck did not one person stop by us for 14 and half minutes? Finally WE had to stop someone and  ask for a server ! I was hangry ( hungry & angry) at this point . Now, mind you we told the young lady on front that took the seating info it was a birthday and I wanted chocolate cheese cake . Did we EVER see it ? NOPE ! The server forgot to give us bread that came 8 minutes after we sat there cause we had to stop another person. This was getting messy. At one point we asked for a soda .....heaven forbid! Took 7 minutes and we had to ask for the manager . He was really sweet and I have no issue its him. But the service GREAT SCOTT !! They took 11 minutes after we asked for the birthday cheese cake to which time that took 9 minutes to FINALLY arrive ... I didn't know this was a all damn day thing ! Oh and it took 12 minutes to get the bill . Plus my daughter sent back an ice tea and it was still on my bill I had to ask It to be taken off. So sorry never EVER again !"
Leticia A.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",2,13,2,3.0,12/30/2015,"Super awesome place, great service. HOWEVER the chicken scampi i got was extremely plain. Had no flavor i was extremely disappointed. But all in all it was great service"
Fabian B.,"Norwalk, CA",0,5,1,1.0,8/19/2016,Found plastic in my food and they stilled had it on the bill. They did not remove it. I will never come here again
Jeanie J.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/17/2016,Only 1 star just because we love the food staff is absolutely the worst lazy rude and when they got my order wrong the girl tried to say I was lying about not receiving my order I ordered take out went all the home and was missing 1 entree I drove 15 min back to pick it up and she was so rude. I just picked up a different order today and 2 girls in the take out section did not greet me or tell me someone would be right with me and looked at me and ignored me when I asked for a manager they said he was in a meeting the cashier that rang up the order acted like she didn't even want to be there such a horrible experience and I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years this is a new location but absolutely the worst they need to hire brand new staff
Angela W.,"Long Beach, CA",138,33,17,4.0,1/13/2016,Even though my order was incorrect my waiter was very nice & apologetic. The food was good as always & I love the outside patio decor....still one of my favorite restaurants!
Sammie S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,,3.0,3/10/2016,"My family went to celebrate a few family members birthdays in January. I normally love their food but that day was an exception. Perhaps because restaurant is fairly new and new chef etc but my eggplant lasagna was very salty. My brother in law ordered chicken alfredo that did not have any chicken in it.  On the plus side, the assorted eggroll appetizer was delicious and a must-have!  the kids loved it.  Overall... The grading is poor on food taste. Wait time was ridiculous, roughly 45 mins. House was full of people. Pie was delicious though.  Great staff, very friendly and knowledgible."
David E.,"Long Beach, CA",322,4,,2.0,1/26/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory but this by far is the worst. I have been to this location twice and both times was disappointed. Both times I had to ask the waiters for bread before my meal. Our servers had dirty finger nails (gross why would I want your dirty hands touching my food or my silverware). The wait was like an hour but there was plenty of available seating from what I could see. Let's just say I won't be back guess I gotta make a drive if I want a real Cheesecake Factory experience. Oh yeah and when I ordered pasta they didn't even ask if I wanted cheese I had to ask. Wtf
Lyrica W.,"Corona, CA",201,9,5,5.0,1/8/2016,"Jimon was an awesome server food came out quick, and hot! Sat outside it was very warm despite the cold weather love the atmosphere and the building of this location."
Lavonne P.,"Long Beach, CA",2,11,1,4.0,9/4/2016,The wait was awhile to get in but we had a nice meal with a nice waitress (who was busy but took care of us). The outside patio was a little bit too warm for me but I am usually warmer than most anyways. It is a nice place with good food.
Annie G.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,82,,1.0,6/10/2016,"I would like to preface this review by saying we love Newport Beach and Bella Terra.  The new Cerritos CF is GHETTO.  Someone was actually vaping inside the restaurant but the manager and staff did not care.  The food is not the same as other CF.  My husband ordered a sandwich combo and his order arrived on a good looking sourdough roll.  I ordered the same combo except with chicken almond salad and mine arrived on soggy, greasy, low quality wheat bread.  I guess they ran out of the good stuff and had to run to Walmart to get their cheap bread.  The sandwich was not palatable.  When I have ordered the same combo in either Huntington or Newport beach, it was delicious and served on a nice fresh roll.  Our service was just mediocre and not really attentive.  Other restaurants within Cerritos Mall, such as Lazy Dog, serve good, fresh food, but Cerritos Cheesecake Factory is a dump and does not serve the same quality food as other locations.  It's probably due to poor management at this location.  We are not going back ever."
