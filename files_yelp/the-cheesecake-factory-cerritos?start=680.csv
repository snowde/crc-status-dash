Karina G.,"Long Beach, CA",3,42,8,5.0,12/2/2015,"I went with my little family for dinner on a Tuesday night. The wait time was 30 min, not bad in my opinion. If you have been to any Cheesecake Factory you know that there's always a wait time. Expect at least an hour wait. Our waitress, Marylyn I believe was awesome!!! This restaurant just opened so we didn't expect her to know everything which she didn't but she made sure to find out for us. One thing my hubby complains about is that he always has an empty glass. Although Marylyn was busy she kept checking up on us and hubby's glass was always full. The food was delicious as always. I'm so happy that there's one near by."
Shelly I.,"Cypress, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/14/2016,"Stopped in today, there  were 4 of us. I had their Chicken Picotta. Everyone enjoyed their meal, service was outstanding and mine was excellent! Glad you came to Cerritos!"
Kayla W.,"Lakewood, CA",0,14,6,2.0,1/8/2016,So the best part of our visit was the bread. Our server was horrible. She never checked on us. Took so long for our waters and bread. There were three of us and two meals came out. It took 5min for our waiter to realize I had not received my food and then took an additional 5 min to finally get it. Food was like a 3/5. To get our bill and pay took forever also. At this point I would rather drive to the location in Westminster then come back to this one. I know they are new and I love Cheesecake Factory but this was ridiculous.
Marilyn M.,"Lynwood, CA",0,6,4,1.0,1/6/2016,"The worse service I ever had. I have been to other Cheesecake Factory and this is by far the worse, we arrived @7 and we didn't get attended till 9:30 we decided to take out food to go and they took so long to get us our food and our check been here since 11pm. Not cool I had plans after dinner not no more"
JAMES P.,"Lakewood, CA",0,11,,5.0,7/11/2016,"Went to this location with another family (4 adults 4 kids) before a 6:15 movie next door. The place was very crowded. The manager Chris assured us they could get us in and we could enjoy our meal and still be to our movie on time. When the tables didn't clear as quickly as he hoped, he took our order and placed it with the kitchen before we were even seated. He also had our cheesecake chilling and packed to go before we finished eating. We had a fantastic dinner, excellent service and still made it to our movie with time to spare. I'm surprised to see mediocre reviews. The food is amazing and every single employee we encountered was pleasant and professional. I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in years, but can't wait to go back. It's a beautiful restaurant, excellent food and terrific service. 5 stars from us for sure."
Mary Beth P.,"Buena Park, CA",250,35,64,2.0,6/7/2016,"This review is based on the service only. The food at Cheesecake Factory is always consistent. I'm more biased when it comes to service because I'm in the industry, and it's just the little things that count. When you go out to eat, you're spending money on the experience as well as the food. We were served by Aisha, overall a okay server. She didn't really try to make small talk or anything. She was more like a, ""What do you want, here's your food type of server"". No personality, no enthusiasm, just hi and bye kind of server. I was actually there to celebrate my anniversary with my bf so it was a special occasion evening. Ordered the calamari and asked specifically for marinara because it's served with cocktail sauce and a peppercorn ranch type sauce. No marinara, still had to ask for it. When she placed the knife for my bf's meal, she didn't even use a marking tray, and put the knife upside down (I wasn't kidding when I said I'm in the industry!) When it came to main entrees, our entrees didn't even come out at the same time .. my bf received his entree first, so he had to wait until we (our daughter and myself) received ours. Afterwards, when we were obviously done eating, Aisha offered dessert, which we ordered to go, and said she would be back to box up our food. A few moments later, a runner dropped off a few boxes and some plastic bags for us to go .. I know it sounds lame but I do expect more quality service when you're spending  $18 and per plate. Even servers at Olive Garden are professional enough to personally box up food for guests. When you have a team of runners and expos, and your only job is to take care of your tables .. Don't be lazy. Pretty kindergarten service for such a nice restaurant. Will definitely be back but only for the food and cheesecake! I think I'll be better off in the bar!"
Marivel V.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,46,26,4.0,11/15/2015,"This is based on the food itself, the food was good! However just like all the negative reviews on here the kitchen staff need to get it together!! The manager came out to tell us that they had to go buy more produce for our appetizers! I felt bad for the people next to us they kept bringing the wrong food and didn't even get their order correct! They did not seem like happy customers. you would think since they are such an establish restaurant and brand they would train their staff properly. Regardless the food itself was good even if it did take over 40 min."
Ivy L.,"Davis, CA",118,26,4,1.0,1/1/2016,This location is horrible not only did it take 20minutes to put our name down for a table. The hostess was dumb and would seat out of order. We ended up waiting 30minutes and walking out since they were so horrible. I like Cheesecake Factory but this location is horrible.
Reynise F.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/17/2017,"I came to try out This Place for the first time,  it was the worst experience I've ever had..the wait wasn't bad, less then 10mins for 2 , we waited about 20mins for our Drinks, waited even longer for our  food, found it very strange that the people on the side of us ordered their food after us,and got there food before us, after 30 mins finally got our food, we ordered ratatouille which was horrible,sent it back, got my meal ,which was Chicken Parmesan, it was supposed to come with 2 sides.. I got mashed potatoes and sweet bacon creamy corn.. Well I didn't get my corn, until 15mins after I got my meal, by now I  am supper annoyed, finally had to tell the waitress that the service was not good, she felt bad, and called the manager, who came up and said sorry, she said the kitchen was backed up.. And sorry about the ratatouile.. She said that will not be on the menu any longer and walked off. BTW manager was named Holly she was not professional, not manger ready.. Sorry but this place was not organized at all, I seen a lot of people leaving there plates full of food, so maybe ot was the kitchen.. I don't recommend this place to anyone"
Mike B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,17,,2.0,2/16/2016,Stopped in for a late lunch on a Tuesday. Sat at the bar and ordered A water. Bartender mumbled and I couldn't tell what he was saying. finally ordered lunch only to discover there's no Wi-Fi in the restaurant. Ordered the spicy cashew chicken and it was delivered promptly. Tasted exactly as I expected and remembered. the lack of modern amenities like Wi-Fi is ludicrous. Only two small TVs in the bar and they were both on a business channel rather show in sports. Reasonable beer selection but little else to recommend this over any other place. My advice is fine another restaurant that actually has Wi-Fi
J. R.,"Long Beach, CA",5,30,,4.0,7/3/2016,"had a great lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. Two minute wait. I have been to so many Cheesecake Factories around the country, and this one is right up there. Great service. Great food. I got the lettuce wrap tacos Mexican style."
Pech M.,"Long Beach, CA",208,5,2,1.0,7/2/2016,waited 30 minutes on a Saturday night... (that was fine) but waiting 20 minutes to have a server come to out table was unacceptable. keep in mind we were seated smacked dab in the middle. asked to speak to a manager and she came out did her manager duties. but all in all would never come to this cheesecake. Bella Tera would be my first
E K.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,1,1.0,1/17/2016,I ordered a slice of the original cheesecake to go and ate it the next day.  As I was enjoying it I noticed something hard.   As I pulled it out of my mouth it was a plastic from a price tag!   How in the world did it get into the cheesecake? !?!?  OMG!
Michael G.,"Artesia, CA",1,25,4,2.0,12/13/2015,"Food is mediocre AF and that's me being generous. Portions are good if you like a lot of mediocre food. Had mini crab cakes and avocado egg rolls. Server said the crab cakes were enough for 4 people. What we got were 6 nickle size balls of fried mayonnaise on the plate. The avocado egg rolls were okay... greasy af though. The sauce that comes with it is basically cumin and corn syrup. Made us gag but we got a good laugh out of making people at our table try it and seeing them cringe like when a baby tastes lemon for the first time. Chicken was kind of uncooked. On a positive note, the bread is good."
Joseph P.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,18,3,1.0,1/13/2016,"Servers were nice but not knowledgeable of the menu. Burger patty was RAW, fries were stale, bacon was basically like plastic. Manager offered free cheesecake, I declined and said to just take that meal off the bill. No way I'm paying for something I didn't eat. The hostesses seem very disorganized while the managers seem to just stand there and watch this place fail miserably."
Patricia W.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",2,39,2,5.0,11/6/2015,"The best addition to the cerritos mall! Awesome service and great food. Our waitress was super attentive and hospitable. I ordered the tostada salad which I'd recommend to anyone and my friend ordered the Thai lettuce wraps.. To die for! For desert we had the banana cheesecake, I think it's one of the best. I'll definitely be returning."
Karls O.,"Whittier, CA",0,19,,5.0,12/3/2015,"Came here to check out the new location, the wait was a little long but my server Kevin was great with checking up on us and getting our drinks and food out fast (everything was delicious)he made my family feel welcomed and made our visit a pleasant one!! We'll definitely be coming back soon for the great service and the delicious food. Although there are negative reviews I'm sure in time everything will get better. Thank you Kevin!"
Ricardo M.,"Downey, CA",19,5,1,1.0,1/9/2016,"Truly sad that after waiting for it to open and be able to go for dinner, it was a TOTAL FAIL. Worst bland entree I've ever had at any of the locations, two entrees didn't come as ordered, and almost had to return one for a second time! Waitress wasn't a natural to capture mentally NO Parmesan cheese. Asked if she could bring something to hold meanwhile Chicken Bellagio was replaced in which we accepted and asked for a soup...she brought a salad -_-. She sent the manager but we had given up, I really do feel she tried. I didn't listen to something else I requested either way.  I will stick to their happy hour which also seems to be messy situation since the tables are in the bar yet are not first come first serve"
Sean A.,"Bellflower, CA",45,7,,1.0,1/7/2016,So the reason is the same as many of the reviews on here already. The wait time is incredibly horrible when you have a large amount of open seats and waiters and servers that you see on there cellphones or not doing to much. A wait for an hour or almost two like we had makes me not want to come back only reason I stayed was because it was my gf bday
Tom P.,"Paramount, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2016,"This place has the worst chefs. Asked for 2 steaks medium. They came to us very charred with tons of pepper on them. No pink inside at all, and flavor was horrible. Asked them to fix it and yes they were a little better, but the chef again went nuts with the pepper. We threw them away. What a waste of money. Never going back to this location."
