Jackie M.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",1,3,,5.0,11/23/2015,"First time coming to this location and was not disappointed. Pedro our waiter was excellent! He was very attentive, polite and made sure we were happy with our food.  Will definitely be coming back!"
Emily I.,"Bell Gardens, CA",202,11,8,4.0,6/4/2016,"very nice waitresses, and meatloaf lunch plate was great! no wait time at all for going on a friday."
Kevin S.,"Garden Grove, CA",183,7,,5.0,11/16/2015,Went here last week on Thursday and was extremely satisfied with my experience! I really don't get why so many people here are complaining about the wait considering this is a brand new restaurant in a busy area. I was seated and served food at a reasonable time and was greeted by the two most friendliest servers. Wendy and Toni were our servers and got all of my families orders right. They recommend the smores cheese cake which was the best desert I have ever had. Overall my experience here was great and I am definitely coming back again! Great job guys!
Maggie B.,"Whittier, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/30/2016,"My visit last night had to be the worst restaurant experience of my life. I'm still in disbelief how bad it was. I went for a friends birthday and we had a big party (group of 20), we figured it would be a long wait, so a couple of my friends went early to put a name down at 6p. They said it would be two hours, so everyone else showed up around 7:30p. 8p came around and still nothing. The host said it would be 30 more min., so we wait and still nothing. We go ask again and they say 45 min. now. At this point everyone is angry and starving, so we ask why it was taking more than two hours. They said it was because the party in the big table they have for us is still there and they cant kick them out, which i get, but in those two hours why couldnt they set up another section for us. What really gets me angry is why they didnt let us make reservations in the first place. My friend had called the day before and they didnt let her make reservations. I think that is ridiculous, especially for her birthday. We didnt get seated till about 10p. On top of that, two people in our party didnt get their food till we were almost done eating. The manager came and apologized and gave a couple of free pieces of cheesecakes, but what does that do for the rest of the people that waited as well and didnt get anything. A lot of us had work super early the next day, and we didnt get out of there till about 1145p. I really suggest they allow people to make reservations, especially for big parties. Not trying to be rude, but a ""sorry"" isn't going to cut it. How does that make our situation better last night? I will definitely not be coming here again."
David J.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/22/2016,"Love, Asian lettuce tacos are really good!! Wait is a while but in my opinion it is worth it."
Annette A.,"Buena Park, CA",3,11,6,4.0,12/18/2015,"It's Friday night but it's to be expected. An hour wait but awesome service, great food and patio are heated and large.  Our server was so nice, fast and great attitude.  Definitely will be back! Servers name is Curtis!"
Alyssa A.,"Cerritos, CA",339,4,,2.0,11/8/2015,My waiter was great but the big problem was they served me raw chicken. I ordered the chicken costoletta and I didn't immediately notice until I took off the breading on the chicken and the whole thing was basically raw. I was very disgusted.
Lance M.,"Lynwood, CA",279,40,5,1.0,3/6/2016,Never again I had the worst experience at this Cheesecake Factory starting off at the bar the bartender was very unprofessional I had to get his attention and he didn't wipe up the area where I sat. He didn't bring any menus or offered any type of service at all I didn't get his name but he his chubby with a full beard. My waitress was alright I guess she has a bad memory I didn't get the water with lemons I ordered until I got the bill and they ran out of calamari and white rice on top of that I ordered the egg roll sample and they only brought out half the egg rolls and the other half when I finished the ones they brought out. The manager came to the table and apologized about not having white rice and calamari at 6:15pm but never offered a discount or something on the house since they didn't have the appetizer I wanted and the entrée I wanted. This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and I would never come here again. I'd rather go to redondo beach or the marina.
Mark P.,"La Mirada, CA",0,11,,4.0,12/1/2015,"Went today for my bday with my mom. Our server was Woody in the bar. I'm always impressed when I get good service @ The Cheesecake Factory because they have like a 99 page menu but he was on top of it. My drink was full and he was extremely polite.The host was extremely friendly, plenty of self-seating in the bar, extremely friendly staff. Food arrived correctly and on time. Couldn't of asked for anything else. People need to keep in mind this is a new location and many people are new employees to the company, give them some slack."
Rene A.,"Long Beach, CA",1,6,3,4.0,6/3/2016,"Visited TCF for the first time and it was a pleasurable experience. We were seated right away, the food came out in a timely manner, and it was delicious! I really enjoyed that there was a nutrition friendly section of the menu for those trying to watch their calories. Friendly waiter, and overall really great!"
David Y.,"La Palma, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/30/2016,"I am a frequent here and always eat in the bar area.  However after what happen to me on the evening of July 29th. I will never eat here again.  After waiting for a seat or table in the bar area for over 30 min.  A waitresses in the bar area told a guy who had just walked in to go take a table that was coming available.  WTF, I went over and taped the guy on the shoulder and told him I had been waiting over 30 min for this table.  This guy played dumb and ignorant. Saying the waitress told him he could have this table.  When there were several people obviously waiting for one to open up.  So I sat down at the table with him.  However on his behalf he offered to get up.   then out of no we're the waitress comes over and tells him,  sir this is your table why are you getting up.  Then looks over to me and says I am the one that needs to get up.  WTF.  Are you serious I along with several other people have been waiting for a spot to open for over 30 min.!  She says no  there is no line over there its first come first serve and it's his table it doesn't matter if he just walked in or not!  I am thinking to my self, you B....  If she stayed out of it there would have been no Issue.  I told the guy it was wrong what he did asked the waitress to get the manager.   The manager would not even attempt to give me my table back.  I am thinking to my self, Shame on you Cheesecake Factory. How about  putting  a noticeable line near the bar area when it's busy.  To late for me though you lost this customer for life.   Please do something about that waitress, she is going to start a fight in the bar someday."
Ike B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,6,1,1.0,6/22/2016,Good service. Great atmosphere. Bad food. Chicken was not cooked all the way. Took a bite and the flavor was great. Then realized something wasn't right about the texture. Cut chicken open and it was pink.
Adriana C.,"South Gate, CA",18,2,,1.0,1/6/2016,"I was so looking forward to dining in this restaurant for the first time to celebrate my nieces bday. It was a horrible experience! I was told the wait was 45-1hr, it was more like 2hrs. The food was okay, not what I expected. Service was just as bad as the wait. It took 33 minutes to get the bill. 4 1/2 hrs later, yes that's right 4 plus hrs later & I was finally out! Never ever will I dine at this restaurant!"
Diane M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/3/2016,We won't be back.   The Cerritos location is tarnishing The Cheesecake Factory's good name.  Our party of six was promptly seated at 11:30 on Jan 1.  It went downhill from there.  The service was agonizingly slow and the food was mediocre.  My salmon was overcooked and my broccoli was under cooked.  The pulled pork sandwich was more like chunks of fat and gristle.  We watched as other parties around us came and went.   Over 2 hours later we were finally able to leave.  We paid a lot of money for this awful lunch experience.
Dee H.,"Downey, CA",0,5,2,5.0,7/3/2016,"The service by MARILYN P was amazing with a party of 11 for brunch , hands down the best waitress me and my family had ever had , i will definitely make sure i came back again next weekend because of her, this is the kind of service that makes customers come back for more , amazing server and great food , cant ask for anything else ."
Thyra M.,"Buena Park, CA",0,10,2,5.0,11/3/2015,First time at the Los Cerritos mall.  Fabulous get food and service great. Will be back for sure. I am glad there is finally one near by.
Dee K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",24,61,28,1.0,10/31/2016,"OMG!! Worst management/service ever!!! They are like the sloths at the DMV from ""Zootopia""!!!!!!I've never waited soooooo long (1.75HR) for our entree. We were about to leave when they came with the entree.  The wait time was amazing on the plus side on a Sunday around 1 pm. It was only 10-15 minutes which was true.  Got seated promptly then everything stopped!! My napkin had lipstick all over it...disgusting!  Took 15 minutes to take our order... another 15 -20 to get my martini( which I requested a plain vodka martini not dirty.., which came to me dirty) I asked the cocktail server (who was different from our standard server) after waiting FOREVER ""is this dirty?"" For I requested a classic martini... then she got confused n said I don't know? I don't know what's dirty!"" Omg .... then we finally get our -appetizers... additional 10 -15mins later... they forgot my wasabi on the side and tobasco ....  the tobacco never came... the wasabi took another 10 mins.  Then the server brings me a new martini.. it was prepared correctly except they forgot my olives this time!!! Omg!!! It's been 45-1hr and our entrees still did not get served.  Then ANOTHER server comes and says""hi I just wanted to reconfirm.. what did you guys order?"" Then my patient husband started to get annoyed and asked if there was a problem... the waiter replied oh no just wanted to confirm.  We waited 15 minutes had another martini where they forgot my olives AGAIN and got fed up and was about to leave when our entrees finally came!!! Outrageous!!! I looked around and NO one had food!! A party in front of us actually got offended and left because such inadequate service!!! Seriously! I caught her recording the situation! Props to her! She did the right thing!  I never experienced such service/poor management at a restaurant. CheesecaKe as a chain is usually consistent but the Cerritos location is beyond horrible!! Management issues for sure! Oh and they never refilled our glasses."
Antonio P.,"Artesia, CA",0,10,,4.0,6/4/2016,"My wife and I have gone here three times and they finally got it right. The food has always been very good. But service in past was auful. This time it was a whole lot better. Hopefully we won't be disappointed the next time we return.  P.s. some of the staff was walking around like they're not happy doing there   smiles no greetings as you walked by,"
Gianelle C.,"Cerritos, CA",178,5,,1.0,2/15/2016,"If this location is the closest to you and most convenient, I advise to drive the extra miles to a farther Cheesecake Factory. Today was my third time going to this location and each time was just horrible. Came in around 545pm to catch happy hour and I noticed it was very busy so I was doubtful any tables would be open in the bar area. I asked one of the workers if the lower tables were part of happy hour and if it was okay if we sat there considering it was the only table open. She said yes so we sat down and started to look at the menu on the table. Five minutes later, one of the workers told us that it wasn't self seating and that we would have to get up. Two seconds later the manager came and all he can say was sorry. We informed them that the other worker told us it was okay. While we were trying to explain ourselves, the worker ROLLED HIS EYES and walked away. WTF. I mean, instead of embarrassing us in front of everyone and making us get up and leave, learn how to do customer service and make the customers happy. Obviously it was a misunderstanding, so work with the customer instead of just kicking them out and being completely rude. I never experienced anything like this and it just shows how inexperienced and idiotic the workers are here. No wonder they only have two stars on Yelp. Cmon. It's freaken Cheesecake Factory. Get your sh*t together."
Ms J.,"Lakewood, CA",0,13,1,5.0,6/25/2016,My family and I came to the restaurant today since my dad wanted to eat at this place. Our server was David and he was nice. It was very busy but we didn't wait too long. The food was great.
