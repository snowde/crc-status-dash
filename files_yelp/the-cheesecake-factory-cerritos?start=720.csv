George H.,"Carson, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/24/2016,Was delighted that eggplant parmesan was added to the menu.  The dish is great but have noticed that the eggplant slices went from baseball to ping pong ball size.  Very disappointing.
Cheryl V.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,,4.0,11/15/2015,Tried to make reservations but they wouldn't take any for the first 6 months they are open we are told. Arrived at 5pm on a Sunday and were told it would be 55 minutes.  75 min later I go back to be told it will be another 35 min. Poor staffing in that there are open tables but those areas are closed. Once we were finally seated things improved. Our waitress (Maggie M) was awesome bringing our bread and water immediately. The food was good and came out in a timely manner.
Rose O.,"Norwalk, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/15/2015,"I work and live near this location, therefore I was excited to try it out and make it our go to place after work or brunch location. Negative!  It seems to always be crowded, but that's not the bad thing...it's they always seem to be understaff! People are waiting to be seated,  we see open tables, just not servers.  Today Sunday we waited an hour  to be seated, fine. We waited for our server to greet us another 5 minutes with no idea who she or he was...ok....then put in our order,  waited for our drinks a little too long...then our food came to the table at different times, Needless to say our party of 4 sat together, but ate at different times...and we didn't get our order complete at the end. I didn't complain to the manager...should have. We paid and left and not coming back or recommending this place. We rather drive a little further and get better service elsewhere. Too bad, so sad."
Monique C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/30/2016,"If I could give this location a 0 I would. The Cheesecake Factory has been my favorite for years until today. And because I am a creature of habit I've always order the same thing, the garlic noodles with chicken and shrimp and the chicken littles. Today I ordered to because it was raining and my 6 year old daughter was tired. I come to the Cheesecake Factory at least 4x a month. Lashaundri greeted me when I cam to pick up my order and took care of my card transaction. She was pleasant and nice. When I got home the garlic noodles with chicken/shrimp I ordered was a mess. This chicken was pieces of a thigh and leg cut up with bones and skin, rubbery and just an all out mess. I have been ordering this dish for years and NEVER HAVE I EVER HAD THAT TYPE OF CHICKEN IN MY GARLIC PASTA. It usually is chicken breast cut in small pieces. Not today. I called and talked to Lashaundri and she transferred me to the Manager Mark who then told me to come back and he would take care of me. I do not live close to the location so going back was an inconvenience but I did. When I got there Mark says the chicken is always made like that and it specifically says it on the menu that the chicken has bone in it. He then asked where is the shrimp, that he doesn't see it. I then put my fingers in the noodles to show him all of the shrimp. And then he says oh. He completely was insulting my intelligence and embarrassing me in from of customers. I laughed because I Know it's not. I asked he to show me and he said he couldn't find it while looking at the menu. I then asked could I see the menu to show him that it does not. And when I pointed it out to show him he was incorrect he says that the recipe is new , really? I told him I have been ordering the same thing and coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years and never have I ever had bones in my garlic noodle when ordered with chicken and shrimp. He then proceeds to say I will take care of you if you want something else. I ordered the shrimp scampi and then he say great we'll get that right out and was about to walk away. When I told him that the scampi was less than the noodles and I would need my change. He was like let me get you Cheesecake. I said no. And he said let me go put a rush on your order. By this time I'm upset because he was extremely rude and insulting. I asked to speak to him so that I could just get a refund. When he came back he said we don't do refunds only gift cards. I'm trying to take care of you, huh yeah I don't think so. I said please just put my refund back on my card. He said okay you can leave I'll put it back but you can go. Excuse me. Not a kid and don't appreciate how I was told to or how he tried to just put me out and without a refund receipt saying that my card would be reimbursed. I told him I would not leave until that happened and I would NEVER be back there. If that is how your managers treat regular customers that is just said. And trying to lie and argue a customer down about their food in from of other customers was the worst. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE!!!!! I will be sure to make somewhere else a favorite because the way he talked to me and treated me was disgusting and disrespectful. MARK DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE A MANAGER. JUST HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!"
Jasmine M.,"Long Beach, CA",128,43,26,4.0,3/29/2016,"We came here a few weeks after it opened and of course was not surprised by the wait as most of these people are, not sure why you go to a new place and expect not to wait but whatever. Anyways we ordered some spaghetti and linguini I ordered the cajun shrimp my husband when original. We were sat next to what I assumed was the dishwasher because there was a bit of noise directly behind the wall we were sitting next to. I can see that being one of the downfalls if you are trying to get romantic I think the outside would be the way to go next to the fire, It is so pretty out there. Inside it can get noisy considering it is a busy place, so again if you want something a bit quieter try the outside. Our food came out faster then our wait. For a party of 2 we waited about 30 minutes so not to bad. I did see a couple bigger parties getting upset because the wait was longer but I mean come on if you are traveling with like 10 people its going to take a while. I mean, has anyone ever heard of reservations? Try it out. I really enjoyed my linguini the shrimp was my favorite part that cajun spice made the entire meal perfect, it was so much food to that I had enough to take home for my lunch the next day and let my tell you it does taste just as good the next day when you microwave it. We had a nice dinner, our server was new but he did a good job as serving us and the big party across from us equally my drink was never empty and all plates were taken right away. In the end we ordered a cheesecake to share. It was a huge piece but so amazing I would have ordered my own. The whipcream at this place is like a whole nother world it is amazing! We now make a point to frequent this location whenever we want cheesecake. I have recently tried the red velvet cheesecake and it is amazing! I can honestly say this is the best cheesecake I have ever had so they do not skimp out on that part for sure!"
Lorena K.,"Lakewood, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/3/2016,"The food is good, but the service here is an embarrassment. I have been here 4 times, and only once I received average service. The other 3 times, it was absolutely terrible. On our most recent visit last week, things started good, the hostess was very nice who took our order promptly, and food and drinks arrived at a reasonable time. However, it all went downhill from there. The entire duration of our visit, the hostess paid full attention to a single table. It seemed that she knew these people, because she was having 15-20 minute conversations with these guests. Our drinks were never filled, not even a courtesy to come and ask if everything was good. I had to ask other hosts to fill our drinks. She finally noticed that we were finishing up and asked if we wanted dessert. I just ignored her and flagged down a different host. She kind of got the hint that we were not happy and quietly left the check on our table and walked away. Absolutely terrible! I was nice and left a tip just to cover the taxes, because I have worked as a server in the past and didn't want to screw her over. She didn't deserve it at all.  I am not sure who manages this place, but that person has no clue on how to train the employees on customer service.  All the reviews about bad customer service regarding this place are 100% true."
Jackie L.,"La Habra, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/30/2016,"Yesterday I met my son and his wife to celebrate a late Mothers Day meal and we all were excited to go to Cheesecake Factory.  Anne ordered Salmon and liked it, Tom ordered chicken, and I ordered the beef dip.  If I could post a picture I'd show you that more than half the sandwich was FAT and gristle.  I pointed it out to the waitress, and she said, ""sorry"".  Really - we were disappointed she didn't get a manager to see the mess.  Anyway,    if you go there, check out what they put between the bread.   Just saying...."
Yesenia S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,54,5,2.0,2/29/2016,"2 stars are only for the food. I usually go the Marina or Redondo locations, but figured I would try this one since it's closer. Big mistake! Our waitress was friendly, but not attentive. I had a refill only because my brother happened to order a water he did not drink. My first refill didn't happen until I was completely done with my food. Also, when my food arrived, I didn't get a chance to move the utensils or plate out the way, bc the woman shoved everything out of the way to set the plate down. Not cool! Staff seemed friendly, but was not performing up to standards, constantly running around and taking forever. Probably due to the location being super busy, but since it is a sit down restaurant, and not fast food I expected better service. To conclude, table and floor was super sticky! I will definitely drive the extra miles to avoid this location!!!"
Adriana N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/18/2016,Never coming back! I'm not a picky person when it comes down to food especially when it's a salad. I mean how hard is it to make a salad? Well apparently too hard for this place. It was dry and when I asked for chicken on my salad they gave me a slice. A slice they charged almost $5 for! It was the worst salad I've ever had and it was overpriced to add to the whole ordeal. Maybe this place is for someone else but definitely not me.
Robert E.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/16/2016,DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. I had the worst restaurant experience here. The hostess seemed snobby (uh it's the Cheesecake Factory not an exclusive high end restaurant). Manager & staff seem unwilling or unable to accommodate parties of more than 6-8 (we were 10). Waited hours only to be told some of the entrees we chose were no longer available (Makes sense since we waited so long for a table. When we finally sat down it was less then 2hrs before closing). Our check had to be sent back twice because there were items that were suppose to be taken off but weren't. This was my first time at this location & it will definitely be my last! Hideous experience!
Mildred H.,"Compton, CA",0,3,3,1.0,11/6/2015,"What a totally awful experience!!! Poor service, cold food and a rude waitress, Irlanda. She removed our appetizer without even asking if we were done. The only semi-bright spot was the manager Mark. He kept coming over apologizing and trying to make things better but things never really improved. After waiting an hour for a table,  another hour for our appetizers we canceled our meal and headed to the bakery for cheesecake to go.  That took another 30 mins. There were four employees standing around while we waited. I will never come back to this location. I've been to others and love this chain. This new location left a bad taste in my mouth."
Colleen M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",95,1,,1.0,11/10/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory so I'm sad to have to give this one such a poor rating. They just opened so maybe the service and food will get better.  I called in my curb side order at 9pm. Got there at 9:30pm and had to call twice because the first time I was put on hold 5 min.  Finally got a hold of someone and then it took them 15 min to bring me my order. This defeats the purpose of curb side. Then when the lady came out to give me my order she had to go back in to get my cheesecake!  So in totally I had to sit in my car waiting for my order for 30 min!  What's the point of curb side and ordering ahead if you have to wait as long as you would inside the restaurant. And then to top it off, I ordered my usual, the crusted chicken Romano and asked for Alfredo sauce on the side. They gave me my sauce in a little tiny container, the same size they use for the butter. What the heck was I doing to do with that amount of sauce for my whole order?  My pasta was also under cooked. What a horrible experience. I can see many people have experienced the same bad service and bad food. What a disappointment. I wouldn't bother going to this location."
Kyle H.,"Merit-Carson, CA",14,21,1,1.0,9/23/2016,"The absolute worst service we received. Our waiter, he (will be kept anonymous) was either not on his A-Game or just refused to act professional at all. While eating, 3 out of 4 of our drinks where refilled; he what purposely skipped on refilling my friend's glass as it was empty and after that didn't offer any refills to us. He kept addressing me as ""man,"" as if we're friends. I don't expect to be treated that way when I go to a restaurant. We also had a gift certificate (not gift card, an actual paper gift certificate) from the 90s that was never used and said they couldn't honor it because of some ""system change,"" yet they claimed it could be when we asked about it before ordering our food. Toward the end we had waited longer for the check than for our food. Before that he walked by our table three times and glanced at our table before finally asking us if we need boxes for our food. At this point we where all disappointed with our meal and service. My friends jambalaya was dry and lacked any flavor, pasta was undercooked. We also wanted to split our meals in half and was rudely said ""put the second card on right so I can remember..."" I'm like how can you not remember, I had a MasterCard and my friend had an AmEx. How hard is that to remember??? This is by far the worse location we have been to and like the rest of the reviews here sadly, has the worst service."
Debbie J.,"Norwalk, CA",1,14,,2.0,3/10/2016,"I have been to the Cerritos location twice, the most recent was today. I ordered the lunch combination of a half turkey sandwich, mushroom soup and a salad. While the green salad was fine, the dressing was not delivered with the salad and I had to ask for it twice. Then the sandwich which may have had an ounce of turkey on it was served on what looked like a stale hot dog bun which was rather hard. I ate the sandwich without the bun because it was so unpleasant. The soup was delivered without a soup spoon so we had to ask for spoons from two different servers. Meanwhile the soup got cold waiting on the spoons. First the waitress said no one knew where the spoons were, then she brought us teaspoons which didn't work too well. She said soup spoons were being washed and she would bring them ASAP. Then she finally came back with great big serving spoons saying they were better than nothing. It was ridiculous. I have ordered this lunch special at the Brea restaurant and it is presented wonderfully and with all the appropriate utensils.  I have been very disappointed during both visits. I may just reserve my visits when I am in the Brea location and skip the Cerritos location altogether."
Sara E.,"Seal Beach, CA",6,4,,2.0,4/11/2016,"My family and I Love The Cheesecake Factory, this is about our third time coming to this location. I know it's a bit knew but they should not still be having problems. The last time we went the food was not the best, most way over cooked but we ate through it because we were starving and we're tired of waiting. My family and I went again today to celebrate a family members birthday and we were seated near the bar in the half booth / half table which was fine because a family member was in a wheelchair. The problem was, our server was also the bar tender. She was extremely slow at taking out drink order when we first sat down, even coming back to our table throughout our stay. And when she would come to our table she was very rushed and had a bit of an attitude if we weren't moving fast enough for her I could understand if she was slammed with people, but the place was not busy at all. And it took forever for our food to even come out of the kitchen. Having these types of issues makes us not even want to return to this location and it's the closest one to us!"
Jasmin M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/1/2016,"Wait time is long, poor service, food not good, and cheesecake tasted old. Never again"
Tammie W.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/29/2016,Terrible experience at the Cerritos location. Arrived at 3:45 on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed. A line just to get your name on the list. By the time we got our name on list they were out of the pagers that let you know your table is ready. Had to wait 10 minutes for one. We were told 15 minutes to an hour for a table. They suggested we could wait in the waiting area wherel there are seats in the mall right behind the exit doors. So we did. An hour and 20 minutes later we went to the front desk to find out why the hadn't yet called us for our table. They said the pager was not working. And our table was ready 30 minutes ago. They didn't bother to go and get us knowing we were in the waiting area in the mall. Just totally blew us off. Then said we would get the next table. The next table became available and they were going to take another party instead of us . I stepped up and told the person who was going  to take them that we were next. So she took us. By the time we were seated it was 2 hrs later.  I was really expecting some kind of a comp. Nothing was offered.   Very disappointing.
Lala B.,"Compton, CA",47,20,7,1.0,1/10/2016,"I'm sorry but this place was terrible. We had to wait an hour and 15 minutes to be seated. I ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer which was great BUT my main course was awful! My food was cold and the portion size was very skimpy. I ordered green beans which were hard, cold and DISGUSTING. I also ordered a combination of steak diane and shrimp scampi. They gave me three little chunks of steak and three little shrimps. I ended up sending it back and my food was still cold! The chef or whoever plated the food added an extra three little chunks of steak :-/ I believe they attempted to heat up my first plate instead of making a completely new one like I asked because it came out really fast...like within five minutes or so; smh. The manager, however, was kind enough to give me a free cheesecake due to my bad experience but this place still gets a ONE star from me! All in all, I WILL NEVER IN LIFE return here to eat...oh and my family were not very pleased with their meals either smh! I do not recommend this location!"
Keeshunna D.,"Lynwood, CA",123,7,1,1.0,11/17/2015,"Where do I start. So my husband and I went to this Cheesecake Factory 2 days ago for our Anniversary. Upon our arrival we were told the wait would be an hour and a half. They gave us a pager and told us that it would work in the mall,so we left to go shopping. I was completely surprised when the pager went off just 30 minutes later. When we got back to the restaurant and checked in at the front desk, the hostess instructed us to stand to the side and we would be seated. While waiting there, i see multiple tickets being printed out which I presume were names of the people who had checked in. Us included. I was a little put off, because the young lady pulling the ticket felt that it was more important for her to finish her conversation, than to do her job. After which she stated that we would be sitting outside.  I found this odd, since they had plenty of seating in their ""outdoor area"" inside the mall. It was very cold that night, and I would think that they wouldn't sit anyone out there before filling up every other option. But no. There we were, trying to warm ourselves up by the heaters while waiting for the server. The waitress addressed us and took our order relatively fast. My husband wanted a turkey burger, but apparently there are no turkey patties being served at Cheesecake Factory locations due to a shortage. So he requested a grilled chicken breast instead, since that was still on the menu. The appetizer took over 45 minutes to come out, and when it did it was wrong.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla. We received a cheese quesadilla with a bunch of onions and chilis on it. When we were able to flag our waitress down to tell her it was wrong, she offered to bring chicken on the side. We told her no thank you and sent it back.  I'm getting really frustrated at this point. Finally our food arrives 45 minutes after we sent the appetizer back. I ordered Crusted Chicken Romano. At first glance, you could see that the pasta was dry and the chicken pieces were not only tiny, but the batter did not look completely cooked. My husband's chicken patty was half the size of the bread in diameter. I was so hungry at this point that I still tried to eat the food. Upon tasting a spoonful of my pasta, i realized i wouldnt be able to eat the rest. The noodles tasted like they had been partially cooked the day before and placed in the frigde to be warmed up again for my meal. There was only a spoonful of sauce, which was not enough to hide the horrible taste of the noodles or the chicken. I reached over to get a try my husband's food, only to find out his fries did not come out with his sandwich, and the sandwich was cold. By this time we had had it. We asked our waitress to send or food back and call the manager. It took him a while to get out there, but once he did, I was more displeased than ever by his completely aloof dimmeaner. He just apologized for the food and said he would remove it from the bill. This made no since, because there shouldn't be a bill....at that point the only thing we had consumed was water and bread. He didn't try to offer an explanation or free desert, nothing. Just "" I see that you sent your quesadilla back and later your food, we are sorry that you didn't like it"". How about how can we make this up to you? This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory, and judging by the experience of others while we were there and the reviews I just read about this location, we are not the only ones that feel this way. I feel sorry for anyone who go there for their first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. They will never go back....to any location. They won't know how good it can be. We left and went to another restaurant, but I had lost my appetite, and our night was ruined."
Susan B.,"Downey, CA",59,48,23,1.0,11/5/2015,I phoned in an order for pick up with Stephanie. Within a few minutes she called me back and left a message that what I wanted (turkey burger) was not available and to call back and update my order.  I called right back and was in hold for 8 minutes (I have a timer on my work phone). The girl who answered the phone when I called back was said Steohannir was on the other line.  I told her I need to clock out for lunch and asked her if she can pls tell Stephanie my new order. She said she can't take orders. I said that's fine but can she then give my new order to stephanie....she said no. Ugh! Wth! Seriously!?! I've been waiting for a Cheesecake Factory to open up around here and my first encounter sucked!!! My workers have already gone to this location and say it's slow and sucks! Today's experience confirmed that!!! Very disappointed! I guess I'll have to keep on making that drive to Brea .  I hope their management is better than their staff!!!
