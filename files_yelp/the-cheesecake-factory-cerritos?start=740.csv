Angel C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,6,2,1.0,12/9/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. I have a high expectation everytime we dine in especially the costumer service. I never had any problems with the mangers, hostess and servers. But this location got the worst service so far. We decided to go there and celebrate my mom's Birthday since its new addition to the mall that's very close to our place. We waited for 45mins to be seated which is already expected. After the waiting time..we seated and our server greeted us. (I forgot his name) with the tone of like he's not happy or excited that we were there. We order our drinks and when came back. He pass me my water and other drinks of my family. When he's distributing the straws. He just toss it infront of me. Near my glass of water. (How rude huh?) So I gave him a look like im waiting for him to say sorry because for me that was very disrespectfull but i didnt hear anything. So we order our entrees and other servers served us are foods and they're all polite and courteous. When our main server came back to refill our drinks and back at the table he just put the glass at the table not looking what will hit it. there are some utensils in the table where he put the glass. So all the utensils flip all over. I gave him a look again. This time he said sorry with his not so sorry voice. But we just calmed and still nice on him the whole time. I am very disappointend on our experience to this new location. We went to this restaurant to celebrate and be happy and have our quality time with the family but that guy changed our mood in a snap. Hopefully the management do some action regarding their employees. Thanks"
Natasha W.,"Inglewood, CA",0,31,4,1.0,12/29/2015,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. I was excited when I heard that Cerritos now has a Cheesecake Factory.  But... Now I'm truly sorry to have to give this bad review.  THIS LOCATION IS HORRIBLE! !! The service is horrible  ( the staff has not been probably trained on restaurant etiquette) , the food was cold, the eating utensils had to be replaced 3x (because dried food was stuck on them), the women's bathroom was filthy,  and last but not least the manager Jake didn't give a care in the world about this location being mismanaged. I will be contacting the GM asap..."
Caves N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,40,,5.0,3/8/2016,"The wait wasn't too long. Service was good and the food was good and very flavorful also. Had a ultimate margarita and it was potent, I will return again."
Will S.,"Garden Grove, CA",61,1,,1.0,11/13/2015,Well I guess I'll the place try cuz just opened. It was worsted day ever to eat here. The service was Bad and horrible and took 15 minutes to get service. And also missing item from wat I ordered... I'll never come back to this place
Ashley M.,"Lakewood, CA",131,16,16,1.0,12/28/2015,"Decided to try this place out again. It's been about a month since we were here last & don't even waste your time because nothing has changed ! Came on a Monday night for a late dinner. We got seated quickly. Party of 5 ( 4 adults , 1 toddler ) they sat us in the back where all other tables had parties of 2. We asked to be moved to a bigger table and was told that section of the restaurant was closed ...?! Mm mm ... What !?!!!! How !?! After threatening to speak to a manager miraculously they found a larger table for us. I'm actually writing this review now as we're waiting for our food (we got here at 10, it's 10:45pm) we understand its late & aren't even expecting 5 star service but we do expect to get drinks , bread ( they ran out ) & our food in a semi timely manner. My friend ordered chicken & biscuits, server came back and said they ran out. Server suggested filet mignon, my friend said okay. Server came back & said they ran out of that too! Wtf !?!  We're still waiting for our food to come out, but I'm not expecting anything good. Will update review after our meal."
Jimmy K.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,3,13,5.0,3/22/2016,The customer service at cheesecake factory was great our server Erica very knowledgeable and very attentive.the  food was great the atmosphere was pleasant been here since it's open and always there for lunch
Melissa T.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/28/2015,"Service: HORRIBLE, hostess was as impatient as their guests waiting to be served.  Food: I used to LOVE Cheesecake Factory and their delicious food, however this location is an embarrassment and does no justice to their name. I ordered the chicken nachos- got nachos with no chicken served to me. I told the waiter I ordered chicken nachos not regular nachos and he replies ""what do you want me to do? Order chicken?"" And I'm like ""yes, that's what I ordered. Some other server comes to my table 15 minutes later and brings over a dry piece of chicken breast- not chopped and asked where she wants us to ""slide"" it. At this point I was over it. It tasted so bad!  To top off the experience- we sat in the patio section outdoors where the sun was shining. We had an umbrella shielding us from the sun and all of a sudden some waiter moves it out of the was for no apparent reason- I looked at him and he looked back and did nothing.  Fast forward to our bill- keep in mind I ordered chicken nachos. They charged me for chicken nachos and EXTRA CHICKEN 5.95 on the side!! OF COURSE I HAD A B. F! This location sucks so bad and they really need to get it together!  I don't understand why they are overwhelmed- of course the establishment is going to be busy- we all were anticipating it! REEVAUATE YOUR TEAM AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE THIS LOCATION IS AN EMBARRASSMENT!!!!!!!!"
Kathleen V.,"Long Beach, CA",461,65,20,1.0,11/22/2015,"Worst service ever. Came in on a Sunday evening as a party of 4 and were told the wait would be an hour to an hour and 15 mins. We got our quote time at 6:20, came back at 7:35 to check on the wait. We were then told that it would be an additional 30 minutes because it was busy, obviously. Then 5 minutes later we were buzzed and they asked us to step to the right and wait to be seated. We stood there for about 15 mins waiting for someone to seat us as everyone else who got buzzed were sat immediately. I then asked the host what is taking so long and she told me they were cleaning our table up. So another 10 mins goes by and a little upset, I went to a different host who then checked for our name and said she didnt receive our pager. They sat us immediately after seeing that we did give them our pager. Our server Nicole came by to greet us, she was quite friendly and told us if we needed anything to just call for her. She saod she was going to come back shortly with bread and clearly forgot because she never came back. Welll... I didn't see nicole at all til AFTER I finished my meal. She was no where in sight and we had 5 different people help us. I understand this restaurant is new, but I think I'm better off going to the one in bella tierra. Today's experience left a bad taste in my mouth."
Alphonsine B.,"Carson, CA",4,15,5,1.0,2/1/2016,"We went yesterday to celebrate our moms birthday and received horrible service. After being greeted by our server we put in an order of drinks that were brought to the table 5 or so minutes later. No problem, that was pretty quick. My brother and I sent back our strawberry lemonades because we didn't like them, they tasted super sour & had no strawberry syrup in them. Our server acted personally offended by this (& never took it off the bill) The rest of the party requested straws as none were brought out with their drinks. 10 minutes went by and nothing. We finally had to ask a different server to bring us some, which that server did promptly. After our drink order was placed our server told us she would bring bread shortly, and couldn't at the moment because it was still baking. 10 minutes later I get up to go to the restroom and notice many tables that were seated after us with bread on their table. She comes back to take our order, still no bread. While placing the order we ask for one entree with most of the toppings on the side, she acted baffled and asked if we even wanted the sides to be brought out at all. Are you going to take money off the bill if we opt out of those sides? No, so bring us what we pay for. Order is placed, food comes out and still no bread! Finally I have to ask her for it & she annoyingly says ""I'll have to check if it's don't baking yet"". This is after I watched another table being brought bread 10 minutes earlier! The worst part of the night was the fact that they completely forgot about the birthday we were celebrating, two tables got an ice cream sundae & were sang to & my mother was never acknowledged. We reminded our server THREE times that we were here to celebrate for her! Instead of even asking if we were ready for desert, we just got brought the check. Finally my mom got tired & left. Then our server comes over & asks if we still want to do the birthday sundae for her. After we tell her our mom got sick of waiting, all she said was ""oh, sorry"" & walks away. We were really disappointed in the service we received last night. My family and I honestly felt like because we were black our server incorrectly assumed we wouldn't tip well & didn't believe we were worth her time or service. Will not be going back to this location, ever."
Deborah S.,"Bellflower, CA",23,14,4,1.0,3/14/2016,Came here for lunch it was mistake. Food was horrible just a salad too much dressing and lunch meat for chicken on the salad. Manager did not accommodate he convinced us to order something else. This ordeal took tooooo long it was a serious mistake.
Elizabeth B.,"Downey, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2015,"I came to this location around 4pm on a Wednesday. There was a 20 minute wait which I didn't mind at all I work at a restaurant myself so I'm not so picky when it comes to wait times or anything like that. I let them know a head of time if I can be seated inside the restaurant, but ended up seating in the back patio where the mall was, which I didn't mind at all they just need to be more organized. After waiting there 15 minutes no one was coming to get out drinks which shocked me as a waitress at another restaurant because that's a long time to wait for someone to at least say ""I'll be right with you"". The worst part of it was that there was only two tables taken!!! So I noticed the manager come outside and personally walked up to him he told me he would get the waitress and he apologized. 10 minutes past later nobody came and I just walked out disappointed.. It shouldn't take 25 minutes, and yes I was looking at my clock the whole time, to be taken a drink order"
Sarah A.,"Long Beach, CA",12,13,5,2.0,2/18/2016,"We came here for dinner after work, thinking we came early enough we could get home to our families at a decent hour. Since it was a work event, babysitters were hired and plans after were made.  We saw our server 3 times and have been waiting 20 minutes for our cheesecake. Waters were left empty and we've watched the wait line grow. The food was good, but the service was subpar."
Roy P.,"Cerritos, CA",3,4,,2.0,4/1/2016,We've been to multiple cheesecake factory's at multiple locations and for the most part havbeen satisfied. But for whatever reason Cerritos location always seem to mess up on our orders and we're always having to ask for it to be returned and redone. This visit is no exception. Not sure if the chefs can't follow instruction or the waiter/waitress is entering incorrectly. Will consider not coming to Cerritos Cheescake and drive to Newport fashion island instead.
T S.,"Cerritos, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Just tried to go here today for lunch at Noon (they open at 11am) for 4 people. There was no line, tables open (including outside) & was told there's a 45 min wait, so we left. Absolutely ridiculous! Never attempting to come here again!"
Ceaser O.,"Lakewood, CA",0,5,9,1.0,11/30/2015,"Food wasn't all that, fries were good. However even though I told the hostess it was my girlfriend's birthday she wasn't even granted a happy birthday song. We weren't even offer the dessert menu."
Priscilla A.,"Bellflower, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/28/2015,Worst restaurant experience EVER! Waited 2 hrs to be seated when we were originally told 40 minutes. after complaining multiple times about the wait and being told each time that our table was being bussed or we were next to be called. Finally we spoke to the manager who gave a I'm only apologizing cuz I have to apology. Once we got the food it was nasty and flavorless. We were given full size adult cups for a 5 and 1 yr old and told they ran out of child size cups with lids! For a new restaurant they should expect to be busy and be overly prepared considering this is inside a mall but instead the entire time we were given excuse after excuse each time we asked for something. I will NEVER come back to this location which sucks cuz it's the most convenient location but after multiple visits to this restaurant this is my first horrible experience! this place was definitely not given the proper tools to open and be a successful restaurant management really needs to step it up
Juanita A.,"Long Beach, CA",12,3,1,1.0,9/18/2016,"We arrived for my daughter's 21st birthday lunch and were told a 40 minute wait for our party of 10, inside seating requested.  To our surprise we only waited 30 minutes before we were called to our table. ...walking to our ""outside"" table we were halted 1/2 way and asked to stand aside as the table was not ready;  some  miscomminication. A table in the sun did not sit well with me on this 94 degree weather day. When i asked about our preference for inside table i was told by the. Manager that she underestimated the time and people were not leaving as quickly as she anticipated and that it would be another 40 minute wait for an inside tables. Not wanting to further ruin my daughter's birthday lunch we took the outside table.  Well,  our orders taken,  we started to make the best of it and enjoyed our drinks and appetizers. Lunch was served minus my son's bacon burger and the shrimp on his girlfriend's pasta. Server said she would try to find the lost burger and shrimp. After 1/2 way thru lunch,  a new burger was brought for my son. Shortly thereafter,  the main manager arrived with his sincerest apologies which fell short on my ears, my daughter's bday lunch already soured. The offer of several free cheesecakes did not even come close to appeasing me! Never having been here,  i was sadly disappointed  for such a beautiful restaurant.  Unfortunate. My one star rating is only because this would not post otherwise."
Ray G.,"Long Beach, CA",1,27,12,1.0,1/11/2016,"Ok where do I start, first off the wait is ridiculous. The whole staff seems as if they have never had restaurant experience. The whole process from the time you give your parties info to the time you get the check was a disaster. The server would bring out each item then disappear with out finding out of we needed something, and it was something as simple as a fork. When my family and I received our food it was in sessions, not to mention the food was warm to the point of almost being cold. Not to mention we had to wait for the things we asked for before eating our meal so by the time we did eat our food it was pretty much cold. The whole time I just watched the staff run around like chickens with no heads I felt like pulling the manager to the side for a pep talk to get the staff in order. Me and my family spent a total of 3 and a half hours here. An hour and a half waiting to be seated and 2 hours just to eat. The fact of the matter is the Cheesecake Factory has been around for a long time and there aren't many around. I feel like they need to staff the whole place with ppl worthy of serving the food that we all know is fantastic. The staff there are gonna give this place a bad rep at this location. Advise to management: Please send all employees to a workshop on how to work in a restaurant."
Flip C.,"Cerritos, CA",0,13,3,4.0,11/4/2015,"I came here for lunch with my mom, 2nd day officially open and excited because a Cheesecake  Factory Restaurant opened so close to my home.  The Cheesecake maybe my nephew CJ'S favorite restaurant or one of them.  And my family has enjoyed the food for years more so my sister's family who have gone more frequently.  The Cheesecake Factory has a reputation for being a little pricier for a family casual restaurant but they do make up for it with their large portions.  It is very rare that diners dont go home without the doggy bag.  As my mom and me came for lunch we figured less expensive and smaller portions you would expect.  I was correct about the less expensive but was pleasantly suprised at the portions. Our meal did start of with the complimentary bread with butter, the brown loaf especially tasty though it could have been warmed, isn't it supposed to be?  We were offered refills, which we accepted of course.  My mom ordered the Chicken and Mushroom Lettuce Wraps off the Skinnylicious menu, yes listed as an appetizer but my mom being 85 yrs old wanted something light.  I ordered one of their famous pastas, the Louisiana which had Chicken and Farafelle pasta in a spicy cream sauce.  The food was delicious but enjoyment was tempered a little by the fact the food was served warm not really hot.  But the portions were huge, surprised at the size and couldn't finish it all. My mom understandable but me, I'm a big guy.  So of course had a doggy bag or two. Service was very good, I believe our waitress' name was Madeline?  She was very attentive and very cordial.  Also answered our questions about the opening of the restaurant and the operations.  The price for two for lunch no more than Twenty bucks before tax and tip.  My mom and I enjoyed our first experience here enough that we will probably bring the rest of my family here, including my nephew, this coming Sunday for dinner.  Oh the place looked beautiful of course, and all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.  Being new there were a few mis-steps to be expected, but once this place hits it's stride as time goes by may rate a 5 star rather than 4.  This being the Cheesecake factory expect it to be busy, especially at dinner, found out they do take reservations.  Lunch is a good time to go if you can, though busy not crowded and did not have to wait to be seated.  A very enjoyable experience."
Captain S.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,75,29,1.0,3/18/2016,The food is still not good. My dad had to complain about his sirloin steak twice. It's just not a fun place for families. Wait is too long too.
