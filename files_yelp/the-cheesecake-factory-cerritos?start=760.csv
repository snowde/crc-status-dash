Marley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,1,5.0,1/15/2016,First time at this location and we loved it. The service was fabulous and the food was yummy. Thank you for making our 20th anniversary memorable.
Mimi M.,"Encinitas, CA",0,20,17,5.0,7/31/2016,"When we first arrived they notified us that the wait was going to be about an hour. We waited because it was our first time and I'm glad we did! Initially one server took our order and then notified us she was going to break and then introduced us to Shannon. We were served by Shannon the remainder of the night and she was absolutely amazing! Nothing against the first server but you could tell off the bat that Shannon's personality was a lot friendlier. She was very attentive and had such amazing energy. You could tell right away from watching her that she enjoys what she does. Our food was amazing also! My boyfriend had the cheese steak sandwich and I tried the chicken 4 cheese pasta. ALL was cooked to PERFECTION!!! The bread was not soggy do to the juiciness of the meat, which is always a plus! And my pasta was so dang good I'm getting hungry all over again just writing this review! Great food... great service... Definitely going back! Thanks Shannon for making our first time at the Cheesecake Factory so great."
Bob D.,"Bellflower, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/20/2016,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and always left happy. The new cerritos location is not the same story. I have tried them on three seperate times. Once on a weekend and twice on week nights. Each experience was bad. They are over crowded with horrible management of wait times. Food takes forever to arrive and it is missing something for at least one person at the table. Then after dinner you wait another 30 minutes to get your check and then another 15 minutes for them to process payment. I will drive past this Cheesecake Factory from now on to go to a location that knows what they are doing. If you expect prompt and efficient service this place is a sorry disappointment. The food is still good, not always as good as other locations, but the service makes this an embarrassment for the company name."
Melissa G.,"Cerritos, CA",23,31,,4.0,11/7/2015,"We went to this location last since the grand opening on Wednesday. The location is better than most. They were very very busy our wait time was 45 minutes which is the usual at any cheese cake factory. Our waiter was Pedro  he was amazing! He recommended an appetizer and offered to review the menu with us. He was very funny yet professional. Our appetizer was delicious! We had the fried zucchini. The order was taking longer than usual, it was understandable for the amount of people they had waiting. We waited about 45 minutes for our food. By the time it arrived we had lost our appetite. I don't know what issues they were having for not bringing the food orders on time, we were not the only ones waiting another couple next to us were getting very frustrated. I just hope they fix the food wait time because this location is closer to home I would hate to drive to the one in Brea. There were also a lot of waiters by the bar area and they didn't know what they were doing, they kept bumping into each other and asking what tables the drinks go to. It didn't seam very organized. There were 5 girls inside the booth were they take down your name they were so crowded it looked very unprofessional. I am still giving this location a 4 because despite of all that Pedro over shadowed all my frustrations. If it wasn't for Pedro our night would have been ruined he was polite and kept us updated on our food order every 10 minutes and always offered to bring more drinks or bread. I hope this location gets it together and makes it big!!!"
Noemy F.,"South Gate, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/14/2016,"I was excited to try this place because a lot of people I know rave about how good it is. Well to begin I give them one star because the wait was less than what we were told. The waitress that helped us was nice but didn't check up on us. My husband stayed there with no drink for like 10 mins and it took another 10 mins for him to get a refill. The food was not great at all! I tried their fettuccini Alfredo and it had absolutely no flavor! The one I make at home has more flavor and the sauce is store bought. Not worth it for the price. My husband got some type of pasta I can't remember exactly and he was not thrilled about his dish either. So food sucked, the waitress was friendly but not attentive and for what we ended up paying totally not worth it."
Tameka A.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,4,,1.0,1/9/2016,"I had the worst experience from this particular establishment.  I went to have a celebratory birthday dinner for myself, my sister and a friend of ours, let me tell you I wasn't a happy camper by the end of the night. Let's start off with the food... I ordered the chicken bellagio. It was two thin chicken breast fried that tasted as if the chicken been fried in old grease, dry pesto pasta that had absolutely no flavor && lacked simple seasoninh with a bed of arugula salad. The salad was just plain unseasoned arugula. My meal was a total bore and it lacked flavor and character. I won't even mention how I woke up in the middle of the night from a bad case of heartburn from the chicken. The service was horrible. Our waitress Amanda, was rude, lacked the attention to details when it came to our party ordering our meals. She lied on our party, was snappy && became quite disrespectful at one point. To our amazement Amanda, untruthfully complained about our party being loud to the acting manager Mark. Mark came to our table and rudely told us all we had to leave. We expressed how it was several of our birthdays and we would like for the staff to sing to us as they did to several other patrons through out the night, Mark rudely declined && continued to tell us to leave instead of asking us what had happened. The acting manager Mark had a poor resolution to the conflict.. I'm giving this review 1 start, only because the cheesecake is delicious .. Is that how you speak to patrons who had a almost 400$ bill? I would never come here again. The food is definetly not worth the price && the service and staff is terrible. I'm giving this place at least one star and that's only because the cheesecake is delicious. ."
Laura R.,"Whittier, CA",3,31,,5.0,11/23/2015,"So excited that this place opened, so much closer than the other locations. My friend and I came here before work for a quick lunch and they did not disappoint! Pedro, our waiter, was awesome and made sure we were happy, and full! Great food, great service, great time!"
Patrick E.,"Lakewood, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/31/2015,"It's a good thing no one was in a rush?   We weren't,  ... but then neath were they!   Now admittedly,  this was on New Years Eve.  But on a Thursday at 4:30 in the afternoon.  I can give them some slack for the 40min. wait.  But from the time we were seated, to signing the bill?  We had been there for well over 2 1/2 hours!  That's two and a half hours for two pasta dishes, salads, and two slices of cheesecake!   ie: not the place to go for a quick bite at the mall!    The salads were fine.  They were 'green!'   But the Cajon Jumbalaya Pasta tasted like it had come frozen, cooked/reheated in a microwave.  My Partner's dish seem pretty much the same.  And the cheesecake, though alright? ...(It 'is' the Cheese Cake Factory.)  They weren't outstanding!  All-in-all?  For an 'events' restaurant, only having being open for a month? ..That it was NY'sE?  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt?  I'll try them again in a few months, in hopes that Managers and Supervisors see this, and take some sort of corrective action!  At that time,  we'll see if they can make themselves a restaurant to be proud of?  Or the Cerritos Applebee's!"
Rosie C.,"Downey, CA",15,3,,2.0,12/30/2015,The service sucks! We waited for an hour outside to be seated. Then the waiter took about 30 mins to ask what we wanted to order. Then the waiter told my friend they ran out of veggie burgers when it's the most simple thing to make. The waiter was taking care of a lot tables so it was stressful for him to take care of all of us. They NEED to hire more workers to have the restaurant run successfully.
B L.,"Downey, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/28/2015,The service here was Terrible! We were a party of 2 and it took us 3 1/2 hours to get seated and served!! Every time our  waitress walked away we did not see her for at least 20 minutes! The food was delicious but service sucked and no one can help! We asked for a manager and they sent the server to us.....
R D.,"Cerritos, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/25/2016,"So many things are wrong with this Cheesecake Factory.  It used to be a place of the highest expectations.  Food, service, and atmosphere used to be the benchmark for all restaurants to reach.  But what I see at this restaurant is dirtiness, lack of professionalism, and just mediocre service.  When we first were being seated there were french fries that I was stepping on from the previous guests.  Then the hostess put the menu on my napkin which I would be using to wipe my mouth.  (If you don't already know a menu is one of the germiest things to touch in a restaurant.)   As we were sitting there, there was a foul fishy smell coming from I guess the kitchen.  The hostess said she didn't know what it was and was wondering the same, could have been a burnt fish n chips?  Yuck to whatever it was, we asked to be seated somewhere else.  Note to self don't order seafood tonight.  Then as usual the waitress brings bread with plates.  I pick my plate up and it is sticky.  We put in our order, but some of it comes out late.  We don't complain no biggie.  But as we start to look around we notice the servers do their job,  but they aren't the highest standard of waiters like back in the day of all white uniforms.  These guys are just everyday waiters and waitresses. And the problem I have with that is that Cheesecake Factory is a pricey restaurant.   If I'm gonna pay good money I expect high quality food, service, and atmosphere.  My husband said the bathrooms were dirty.  As we left we noticed smudges on the glass, disarray counters, and dirty dirty floors.  As we were leaving the hostess gave us a half hearted thanks for coming in.  As she said this she looked away.  Los Cerritos Center missed the mark with this one.  I don't normally review on Cheesecake factories, but this was so far from the normal standard I had to comment.  My Cheesecake Factory experiences range from KCMO the Plaza, Redondo Beach, Marina Del Rey, The Grove, Newport Fashion Island and Summerlin near Las Vegas.  I had high hopes, but I won't be coming back unless there is a turn around.  I've had better experiences at CPK, and BJ'S here in Cerritos so I will stick to those places."
Diana H.,"Bellflower, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/21/2016,This was our first time at this location we went for lunch we were seated right away the restaurant is very nice inside all the waiters were very nice our order was taking in a timely matter the food was great we  would  recommend this location to anyone
Stephanie L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,80,,2.0,6/26/2016,"We went in the restaurant waiting in a line for ten minutes and we saw people passing by us and was wondering what is going on. Found out the line we waited in was not even a line but a group of people waiting to be seated. So, we went up to put our name in and got the little pager device and finally, they call us. Now, we had wait another 5 minutes because they were looking for a table. Why give us a call to the pager if your not ready? Poor performance on the hosts for not telling people that it was not a line because they should have been paying attention and directing people. Another bad performance for not having everything together when they call us. We end up sitting outside and not inside like we wanted. The reason for two stars is because the food is pretty tasty and our server Sarah was nice. I hope they find a better way to assist customers in the near future and have no excuses!"
Gregg C.,"Wildomar, CA",0,12,5,1.0,1/12/2016,What a dump for a new facility. Seating for five (5) was at a both for four (4). Being uncomfortable with cramped seating; service was extremely slow making it miserable. I could have gone to Carl's Jr. for a better burger for less money.  Not like other cheesecake  factory's like Redondo beach
Christian L.,"Lynwood, CA",98,3,,1.0,12/29/2015,The WORST Customer service I have ever seen in a restaurant!!! The food was uncooked ! I didn't even have my utensils or straw for my drink!! The food took way too long to prepare!  Never going here again !!!!!
Kim P.,"Bellflower, CA",21,5,,2.0,7/16/2016,"Went on a beautiful Friday afternoon, 4pm. No wait to be seated, which was fantastic as we had tickets for a movie at 5:15.  Restaurant was not  full, so we thought, great we will be in and out with no problems. Unfortunately, that would be the last of the expeditious service and attention.  We waited about 10 minutes for our order to be taken. The waitress came by once to let us know our food would be out soon. Soon was a 25 minute wait. Food finally arrived, looked amazing and it was. Unfortunately our service was not. We saw our waitress one other time after our food was delivered. She brought me a refill on my drink, but nothing for my friend who was drinking the exact same thing. She kept saying the pitcher was empty and she couldn't find another one, which made no sense. At that point we were just trying to finish up and get out in time for the movie.  We rushed through our meal with a 12 minute window to catch our movie. That's were we were wrong. Couldn't find our waitress to get the bill. It took a couple of mnutes to flag down anyone to get our waitress. I stopped a young man who was cleaning tables and asked  him if he could get our waitress, he nodded yes, then took a few steps and stopped to check his cell phone and then just looked around, to appease me. The only way I got my bill was by a waitress accidentally delivering a slice of cheesecake to my table, which was how another waitress came over to let her know it was the wrong table . This waitress was very nice and immediately helped me with getting my bill. She stayed so I could wrap up the bill and then out of no where our original waitress showed up. Gave her the bill, paid in cash and when she returned, I counted my change back and guess what it was short and she was no where to be found.  Since we were going to be late to the movie, I was not about to wait for her return, so the  amount she shorted me was added into her tip.  I love the food here, unfortunately, the service at this location needs a lot of work."
Jackie D.,"Cerritos, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/17/2015,"First of all I'm So Happy to have the Cheesecake Factory in Cerritos near my home, very nice inside and I love the patio seating with the heated lamps. I dined in several times the food was very very good but the wait was love on the other hand I also ordered food to go, not once have they gotten it right, I've even returned food to get my money back, and decided I will give them another chance on a to go order, still they could not get it right so please be careful on your to go orders check them before you leave, they don't give the to go orders to much care."
Jennifer M.,"Lakewood, CA",70,7,1,2.0,12/16/2015,I just came from there our sever was nam Oscar L.

D R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,1,5.0,11/24/2015,"This is our first time eating at this particular Cheesecake Factory. My family went out to dinner on Monday, November 23, 2015. We ordered Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, Firecracker Salmon Rolls, 2 orders of Pasta Butter Parmesan. Our server was Brenda M. She took good care of us. She was very attentive to our needs. The Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken was overcooked so she ordered another one for us. She went on her break and when she came back from her break we were still waiting for our Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken. She informed her manager, Mark, who came to our table and spoke to us. Mark took full responsibility of the situation even though he was not directly responsible for cooking it and not delivering it in a timely manner. You don't find too many managers that will own up or take ownership of the problem. We truly appreciate that Mark took ownership of the issue. He also deducted that particular meal out of our bill.  Kudos to you Mark and Brenda M.  Thank you for your outstanding customer service.  We will definitely come back to this particular CF again!"
Jaz W.,"Norwalk, CA",0,10,3,5.0,11/9/2015,"I came around 2 in the afternoon and surprisingly there were no lines. I only came to pick up cheesecake, there were no lines. They were friendly and next time I hope to come and eat there as well."
