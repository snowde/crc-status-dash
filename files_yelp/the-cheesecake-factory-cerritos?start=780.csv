Julie S.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/29/2016,"I came here on a Saturday night with my sister, and expected it to be busy. We waited 30 minutes for a seat, reasonable, but it was when we got to our seats, the service was absolutely terrible. We got some stale, cold bread, which I asked the waiter for some new bread. It took 10 minutes to even get a waiter over so we could order. I ordered a Steak Diane, well done, and Shrimp Scampi. The steak was medium rare, and the shrimp scampi didnt even come with angel hair pasta like I thought. It was only the sauce. I asked for angel hair pasta on the side, but the sauce was overly bitter and I didn't like it overall. We soon asked for the check, and for the foods to be boxed to-go, but that took thirty minutes overall. Our server walked really slowly, which I don't think was appropriate considering that there were lots of people here. 2/5 stars, because my sister actually kinda liked her food, but she complained that the fettucine alfredo was incredibly greasy. I was looking for better service because I actually like Cheesecake Factory. Definitely not coming back here again."
S M.,"North Reading, MA",0,5,,1.0,11/11/2015,"First time at this new Cheesecake Factory location and was very disappointed. We were seated within 15 minutes, outside patio, very nice, heaters kept the area comfortable. It took 15 minutes before a server came to our table, took our drink order and brought us bread. Then another 15 minutes before coming back to take our order. To make a long story short, from the time our order was taken it took over an hour before we received our meals. The food was cold, my pasta was in a big ball and mashed potatoes were cold and hard on the top. Didn't want to send anything back because we had already waited for a long time. Forgot to mention that during the hour and a half our server went off shift. We ate our dinner and then was rushed to make a dessert selection, which we asked to have it to go. It took another 20 minutes for the server to return with our desserts and our check. We paid in cash, which we normally don't like just leaving on the table but after 15 more minutes the server didn't come to the table for payment so we just left. Having been to the Cheesecake Factory's on the East Coast, this location has a lot to improve. The entrance area is too crowded and difficult to get to the check-in desk. The sun shines through the front door,  the Check-in girl couldn't even see, she had to talk to us with a menu in front of her face to deflect the sun. Very Poor design. The Cheesecake is the best! I hope in time this location improves because we love the Cheesecake Factory."
Denise L.,"Cerritos, CA",21,4,,1.0,4/15/2016,"Last night my family (4 adults 3 children) went to Cheesecake Factory about 8:15 pm. We didn't have to wait too long to be seated.  The experience was horrible. Service was horrible! Took forever to even order drinks.  Drinks were finally delivered minus one. Of course, it had to be one of the kids. Dinner FINALLY came! What I didn't like is they brought food out, then more plates 10 minutes later. One of the kids fell asleep, she was tired of waiting. OK, all food served? NOPE, after waiting another 10 min we realize a meal didn't come yet. We flagged down waiter and he of course apologizes. My son tells them never mind, take off our bill. They bring it anyway only to repeat I don't want it now.  We also ordered another cocktail and it never came. It just seems like the servers just don't have it together!! TEAM WORK, guys! Work together as a team to satisfy your customers. Customers that RETURN are what you want! I don't care how good the food is, if there is not good service, customers will not return. This customer won't be returning and by reading other reviews there are others I'm sure that won't be back."
Stacy J.,"Downey, CA",0,4,2,1.0,12/17/2015,"Very rude and unprofessional manager will never eat at this location again... Decided to have my birthday dinner here and since it was a big group of 16 and they didn't take reservations yet, I arrived earlier then the time I had told my guests so they wouldn't wait too long anyhow the manager refused to give me a buzzer (the ones you get to know your table is ready) and he kept telling me to check back in an hour , to see how long the wait would be then , he also said that big parties usually get annoyed and leave and that he would not loose other customers just to accommodate my party ..  I told him why would I leave if I had already told my guests to come here.. Anyhow I was so disappointed with the unprofessionalism we did leave to California pizza kitchen also located at Cerritos mall who were very nice , and professional ..  i won't be coming back to this new location! (I had been here twice prior) ."
Emily D.,"Cerritos, CA",1,3,78,3.0,2/19/2016,"Its my second time going to a Cheesecake Factory. I really thought that this place would be super packed Friday afternoon, but it actually wasn't. When my friends and I first entered the restaurant, we noticed that a whole area of the restaurant was empty so we thought we were really lucky to sit inside, but we were told that only the outdoor seating was available at that time which made absolute no sense to us, and ended  up being escorted outside to a table meant for 6 people, but this little setback didn't bother us that much. We were a party of 3 so we decided to share a pizza. Since two of us were vegetarian, they didn't have much veggie choices(pizza wise) except the cheese pizza so we asked if we can get The Everything Pizza, but make 1/2 of the pizza w/o meat. We waited 30 minutes, eating 2 rounds of free bread only to find that the pizza we asked for was not made to our instructions. The server said that the chef must have been confused. So to make it easier in the chefs mind, the server asked if they can make it all no meat instead of making 1/2 of no meat and we agreed. We finally got another pizza an extra 30 minutes later, and ended up getting the first pizza for free as an apology, which was nice for my 1 friend. What I liked about this place is that they're servers are really friendly and they're more than happy to give you free boxes to take home!"
Alex C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",27,5,,2.0,11/30/2015,"EVERYTHING WAS BAD! Was thrilled when Cheesecake Factory opened a new location near my home and my family and I couldn't wait to go! Big mistake! Showed up a little past noon not thinking it would be too crazy and boy was I wrong. We waited almost 40 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated everything else went wrong. From getting our drink orders wrong, to taking more than 1hr to get our food out to having 2 out of 4 meals come out completely horrible. My poor daughter ordered the chicken tenders and fries and once it arrived they tasted horrible, both the tenders and fries had a strong fish taste. We asked the waited to let her switch her meal to the pizza instead and he kindly agreed but it got there almost 45 minutes later, she had to sit there and watch us all eat. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken and it was drowning in sauce, way too salty and saucy to eat. We never got asked if we wanted our drinks refreshed and once we asked for the bill that also took 25 minutes to get! I went to ask for a manager and spoke to Mike. Mike was very nice and was very sorry for the service and food. We had already been charged and he couldn't adjust our bill but he promised to mail me a gift card so we could come back and he could make up for the bad experience. I look forward to receiving the gcard and returning to give this restaurant a second chance. We love the Cheesecake Factory and this has been our only bad experience with them. I really hope they can fix all of the issues."
Brenda T.,"Lakewood, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/28/2015,"Went here on a Saturday night for dinner around 7pm. Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been.!!! Or server was great and very attentive.  I ordered the Steak Diane, mash potatos were cold as if they had just served straight out of the fridge and my steak was cold as well!!! Our server tried his best and did his part!! Then I over heard our server telling the manager that the people sitting next to us had found a hair in there food!!! How disgusting is that!! The Manger didn't even go to apologize to the family all he said to the server ""Oh just go dump it in the trash and give them a new plate"".... And last going to the restroom was another mistake... toilet paper all over on the floor and toilet gaskets as well.. And only three toilets in the entire restaurant... Oh btw only one stall had a toilet paper roll in there!!! Worst experience ever!!! We should of just driven to are regular Cheesecake Factory we go too BREA!!"
