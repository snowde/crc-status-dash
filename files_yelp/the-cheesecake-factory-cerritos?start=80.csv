Sydnee G.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,22,19,1.0,5/28/2017,"Second time I've been to Cheesecake Factory for a birthday. Second time we've asked them to sing for us/each other and second time NOBODY EVER CAME!  We left without anybody even acknowledging my birthday tonight. We tried to buy some cheesecake after at the to go counter since we didn't want that on our bill because we didn't even want to tip in the first place.  We were turned away and told the counter was closed and there was nothing they could do even after I told them it was my birthday and we asked them to come sing and nobody came. Extremely rude service and I will never be back to this location and I'm tempted to completely not return to the business.  Highly disappointed in the company and servers considering they sang happy birthday and brought dessert to the table next to us when we first arrived. I'm starting to thing it's because I'm 20 and the servers think I'm lying just for free cake. This honestly devastated me, and it was all I was looking forward too all dinner.  Sucks, they lost yet another loyal customer."
Joann C.,"Pasadena, CA",283,214,576,4.0,6/4/2016,"I feel kinda bad for the bad reviews on here about the servers. The guy in the front who seated us was friendly and we had a small convo as he walked us to our table. Our servers name was Syriah? I'm probably spelling it wrong but she was awesome and super friendly/ always came to check up on us.  For the food, we got the fried cheese.. UM YUMMMM. The cheese was good but the marina sauce would have tasted better if it was hot.. It was more on the cold side, not even lukewarm.  Buffalo fritters?: chunks of chicken fried inside a buffalo sauce batter. It was more batter than chicken to be honest. Wouldn't order it again. Too greasy Flatbread: tomato one. It's on the healthier side of flatbread. If you love tomatoes, this ones for you. I got the chicken Parmesan with tomato pasta. Pretty good with a lot of cheese on top cuz I requested it lol"
Elizabeth M.,"Buena Park, CA",1,16,38,3.0,11/4/2017,"This is a review from our experience during my husband's birthday last October.Sorry don't have the time to review the same day we ate there. It was our second time to eat here.We ordered calamari,sliders, kids meal chicken tenders and rib eye steak.The food was excellent.But with our experience here, food is a hit and miss experience.First time we ate here we were so disappointed with the taste of the food.Good thing this time it was great.Service was poor though.Our server didn't even make an effort to check on us oh she did...when she said it's time for her to go home and endorsed us to another server.Our second server also didn't  check on us the whole time we were there.It was not even peak hour when we came.They gave my husband a free birthday sundae but can't they not make it more lively and with happy faces when they sing the happy birthday song? While they were singing it I feel like they just want to get it over or and with."

His children and myself amd on top of arriving fairly early considering dinner hr. rushes we still waited 30 to 45 mins.

And then it was raw still, i ordered the haibachi steak well done this steak had to have been rare because as low dimmed as this place is i could see the red with out much light.... not a good night"
Nay H.,"Perris, CA",0,42,6,5.0,7/28/2017,"Humberto is officially now my favorite waiter.   He took good care of me and my friends.  When we come back for our monthly Girls dinner.  We will ask, request, ok demand......for him."
Amrita S.,"Cerritos, CA",116,23,12,1.0,4/29/2017,"Worst customer service ever! I spent over an hour waiting here just to find out that the pager wasn't working.  Okay, fine I did let that go as it was an honest mistake. But then the lady at the front had the audacity to talk to us rudely by saying that waiting a little longer wouldn't hurt. No apology, nothing. Just unnecessary attitude and blame on us for the situation.  I'm sorry but if you know that you have customers waiting over an hour, you can at least have the decency to provide comforting customer service.  I will never come back due to this experience. Unbelievable that a restaurant with such an exceptional reputation would give you such treatment."
Stephanie H.,"Inglewood, CA",148,122,133,2.0,11/7/2016,My friends and I came here last Friday night around 11pm and we were seated in the bar area. We waited about 15 min for any server to come to our table.  After one of my friends went over to the hostess and asked to speak to the manager a waitress came over shortly after and said there was confusion about who was covering the table.   When she was taking my order she was writing it down but clearly distracted by something and kept looking across the room.  Then to top it off she puts  our orders in and comes back 5 min later to say they were out of buffalo blasts.   Disappointed with my experience at this location.
Ash G.,"Buena Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/16/2017,"I called to make an order, and the girl on the phone said she would transfer me to the bakery so they could make my order; however, I was waiting on the phone for about 10 minutes. Then I called again, and the girl stated she would tell her manager and she transferred me again, but I was waiting for more than 10-15 minutes. The service is extremely slow for me to just order food and the amount of time to make it will be longer. It's really not difficult to take an order down."
David W.,"Artesia, CA",28,9,4,4.0,11/7/2017,"I have reviewed this location before with bad remarks and was very unsatisfied, however the manger contacted me and assured me this was not the normal and to please try again . It was my GF birthday and with our schedules we did not have time to go to the other location that we have always been pleased with in every way . So we visited the Cerritos location once again. At first it was pleasant , easy parking and we were seated promptly at the same booth as we had been seated in our previous visit. The waiter offered us perfect service yet giving us time alone to talk witch we always need. We like to order our food from the pictures on YELP versus the menu but cell phone service and WiFi is hard to receive in the restaurant . Our appetizers, drinks and entrees were prepared and offered at perfect timing, the manager happen to be walking by and asked how everything and we replied with very satisfied responses , however I did not know it was the manager or some random customer walking by till later as I saw her assisting others. I wish I would have known she was the manager at the time. All in all my steak Diane and her Bistro shrimp pasta was worth the trip back  My bad points : The booth we were sat st should be the last booth ever used . There is a machine they use on the back side of the booth that rumbles the whole booth and is quite loud  And there should be stronger WiFi available for those that use Yelp to view the menu  Other then that our time and meal were perfectly utilized"
Mamta M.,"Little Falls, NJ",64,2,,2.0,1/2/2018,I bought a promotional offer that stated when you purchase a $25.00 Gift card you get two slices of cheesecake for free. Nothing was stated that we have to purchase any meals to redeem the free cheesecake. My 8year old handicap daughter was craving cheesecake so I went to redeem the offer and was given a hard time by the employee. She stated that I had purchase a meal before I can claim my free cheesecake. I explained to her that no such information was put on this gift card. And she began to tell me that I can only claim one cheesecake per order per visit. It took her 25 min to get a manger to approve. After having to argue and explain the situation. I am a loyal customer of the Cheesecake Factory because of my 8 yrs old handicapped daughtonly enjoys cheesecake from your restaurant and I felt the service I received was unsatisfactory. After reading the other negative feedbacks it seems to me that you have a standard reply for dissatisfied customers. I am highly disappointed with you run of the mill apology. You just lost a loyal customer.
Michelle C.,"San Diego, CA",101,332,770,3.0,1/4/2017,"We came here on NYE and they closed at midnight. The waitress forgot to put in our order, we waited for about 45 minutes and people that came at the same time or after us have already left the restaurant. We ordered the combo of steak diane and chicken madeira with a side of fries and garlic noodles with chicken. It looks like the waitress had put in our order 30+ minutes after we ordered. The manager offered us cheesecake to make up for the time! They have a new hazelnut cheesecake that is really worth trying! :) The white truffle raspberry cheesecake is also good, but I think it's way too sweet for my taste! The food was good, but the steak and chicken were both less than lukewarm when arrived."
Carol P.,"Cerritos, CA",0,7,2,1.0,11/1/2017,To whom it may concern ;  I order the kids  spaghetti with marinara sauce today. And my son told me that the sauce is spicy . Me and my mother we try to eat it and it is a spicy. And the one who get my order the name is Bailey and the order number is 0211. I spoked with the manager her name is sarah. And she's so nice to change my order. I hope it will not happen again to anybody.
Charles G.,"Artesia, CA",0,9,,4.0,10/31/2017,"I would rate our experience a 5 but the wait time was a bit hard to handle. First time to visit the Cheesecake Factory in Cerritos, CA. Did not know reservations are not accepted on weekends so our party of 20 waited over 2 hours to be seated as the only place to accommodate our group was on the patio.  With a wait of over 2 hours we were a bit grumpy and just wanted to eat and go. However the service made us stay a bit longer than usual. Our server, Andrea was outstanding. As soon as we got seated she had drinks and bread on the tables to settle us down. Her service was beyond expectations as she got our orders as soon as possible and made sure the drinks were always full. Even offered us coffee after the meal. One thing - Cheesecake Factory should offer large groups in waiting a place to veg, offer them munchies or something to keep occupied, especially the younger set."
Georgianna C.,"Orange, CA",69,2,,1.0,8/23/2017,"Experienced horrible service for the first time today.  The waitress we had was Amanda (blonde hair and glasses). My friend, who is very small and petite, doesn't eat a lot and wanted to order fettuccine alfredo from the kids menu. We were very polite about asking and informed her that a previous waiter from this same Cheesecake factory had provided it without any question. Amanda ended up bringing out her manager, Peter (Indian with glasses), who only proceeded to make the situation worse. What really irked me was that he walked away mid-conversation. He's the manager and he couldn't even stand there and hear us out. We were not yelling, just expressing our frustration. As a manager, he lacked people skills. We understood that they were trying to enforce only children ordering from the menu. However, my friend brought her 10 year old sister who also ordered a kids chicken alfredo. We asked if her sister can just order 2 and Peter insisted that she wouldn't be able to finish 2 plates. My friend then proceeded to say that she would eat the second plate. The manager then replied with ""No, only children can eat it."" But its not like the waitress or waiter is gonna stand there and watch who eats what plate. That's like telling a mom she can't eat off of her child's plate because it's only for kids. It's ridiculous. I mean we DID have a child with us, it's not like it was all adults. Not to mention, they didn't do anything to try and accommodate us. We're paying customers, we weren't trying to get anything free or cause a big deal, we literally just wanted to order and have a good night. The least they could have done was offer a free dessert or something for the trouble they were giving us.  To wrap up what happened, the manager settled on giving us a kids chicken alfredo to-go. But it wouldn't be brought out with the rest of the food, just whenever it's done. So my friend was going to settle on watching us eat, while waiting for her food.  Luckily, we received a new waiter (Arthur A.) who accommodated us and handled the situation professionally. Just the fact that he was able to communicate with us instead of giving an attitude or walking away completely diffused the situation. He ended up getting us the kids chicken alfredo and brought it out with the rest of the food. He should have been the manager, due to his customer service skills. Honestly. Highlight: As we were getting seated, before all of this started, the Hostess was talking about how she ALWAYS orders off of the kids menu. When I told her that i've been denied ordering from the kids menu before at other restaurants, she was shocked.  The manager made it clear that they are really trying to enforce only kids eating from that menu, yet some of their workers aren't aware? Shame."
Castillo V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,1,1.0,7/30/2017,"I am an avid yelp searcher, but never write reviews, however my most recent visit to this location warranted a review. My boyfriend and I love Cheesecake Factory and I'd been craving it so despite the fact that they said it was a 40 min wait and we'd been waiting over an hour we were excited to eat.  We were finally seated and the table was still dirty and greasy which wasn't a huge deal but still annoying. They cleaned our table, we ordered our food promptly with no issues, but then our order comes out and my boyfriends order was partially wrong. He had asked for mac and cheese and didn't receive it. He starts eating anyways and cuts into the chicken and the chicken is STILL RAW. So we talk to the manager and he asks to replace it so we order a club sandwich.  They bring the mac and cheese out after he ordered the sandwich. The mac they brought out wasn't cooked. They melted the top layer and the rest of the macaroni was cold, hard and undercooked. So then by the time they brought out a new macaroni and cheese they had already brought out a club sandwich so we no longer needed the Mac and cheese.  On to the bill, after talking to the manager about the raw food, the cold mac & cheese and the delays in bringing it all out (I finished my entire meal before it was all resolved) they charged everything wrong. We were charged twice for the raw chicken plate and then they  ""fixed"" it and took 1 off even though management had apologized and ""fixed"" it to where we wouldn't be charged for the raw chicken. So again we were forced to go through the manager to fix things again.  We had dessert to top it all off . We each ordered a slice of cheesecake and because we are regular customers we know they usually give the cheesecake in the slice shaped containers. Our cheesecake was given to us in regular to go boxes, which wouldn't have been an issue if the cheesecake wasn't thrown in and smashed into the box. At this point the manager has been kind enough to help us out at every turn so we didn't  want to bother him anymore and casually asked the lady at the to go cheesecake counter if they were out of cheesecake boxes and she says no. Then we tell her how our cheesecake looked like it was just thrown into a to go container. Her response wasn't even to our concern she just said well the promotion is dine in only. My boyfriend was very upset and said I don't give a fuck about the promotion after everything that's happened today. The lady begins to make a scene because he cussed. I normally wouldn't condone cussing in such a public place either, but with everything going wrong it's understandable that he would feel the need to say it.  Overall the quality of this place needs to be reevaluated. The food temperature and quality of food and service shouldn't suffer just because it's busy, which the manager did acknowledge but all efforts he gave to fix things were constantly being messed up by the rest of the staff."
Deanne R.,"Cypress, CA",21,88,69,5.0,7/20/2017,Food was  great. Customer service was excellent since we walked in. Our waitress the same very attentive kind and curious. Will definitely be back next time.
Lily T.,"El Monte, CA",724,37,79,4.0,10/23/2016,A typical place to take a date on but still love to eat here.  FOOD:  I've tried several types of pasta. My favorite is the angel hair with white sauce substitute and the chipotle pasta.  One of my favorites would have to be the hibachi steak! Love the wasabi mashed potatoes - creamy and delicious!  CHEESECAKE:  My favorite cheesecakes would be blueberry cheese and the key like cheesecake.  SERVICE:  All the employees are great and attentive.
Richard V.,"Whittier, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/17/2017,"Cerritos is the busiest place on earth, but Sunday brunch at the Cheesecake Factory is the best. Great service, food, and atmosphere. I recommend tying it , especially there lemon Ricotta pancakes!"
Crys C.,"Bell Gardens, CA",146,56,20,5.0,12/4/2017,"Last night we had dinner here,  it was our first time at this location and as expected there was a 30 minute wait but were seated promptly and accordingly. Our server was Jacky, she was friendly and attentive. Our appetizers came out within under 10 minutes, everything was delicious. When our entree's came out, two of them got to the table at the same time, our third plate however was taken to the wrong table. We had to wait about 7-10 minutes for our third plate, Jacky came by and apologized for the mix up it was a different server who had brought out the third plate. I normally would of been upset about the mix up but Jacky was so sweet that it didn't bother me at all, mistakes happen. All of our entree's were delicious, the food was hot but not too hot to eat, everything was cooked to perfection. We also had cheesecake which was amazing as well. Over all it was a very pleasant experience, Thank You Jacky!"
W Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/11/2017,"I think this place should fire all staff and start from scratch! If this was my first visit to CF I would never return. Fortunately I have been to the better locations.  Came here for a friends birthday, had to wait an hour and ten minutes, no problem. After waiting we were buzzed in. Once we got inside they told us to stand to the side and wait on our waiter. The girl who was supposed to put our party info on the white piece of paper to be called was too busy talking and did not do it. THREE PARTIES OF 4+ WENT AHEAD OF US AS WE JUST WATCHED. After stating they were skipping us, someone else apologized on her behalf and took us to our seat.  I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp and chicken, my shrimp was so rubbery and hard, my beans were under cooked, my brown rice was hard and under cooked. the sauce was amazing which is why I gave them 1 star.  Told my waiter to charge my card for 50, my friends card for 55, he stated he had it TWICE. came back with my card charged for $5 more. Unbelievable!  If you go here make sure you are paying attention because they are not!"
