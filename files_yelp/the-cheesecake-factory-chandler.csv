Jeff A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,1,5.0,1/7/2018,"I first discovered the Cheesecake Factory when i was working in the LA area more than 20 years ago. This first visit left such a positive impression, i made it a point to visit this chain in several other cities over the years. I am not a huge fan of dining in chain restaurants, but i have made an exception in this case. The consistency and combination of high quality, freshness of food ingredients, very large menu selection and value for the money has made me a loyal fan.  Since moving to the Phoenix metro area several years ago, i now visit the Chandler location almost exclusively. Although the Superstition Springs (Mesa) location is closer to home, my overall dining experience in Chandler has never been less than perfect. For me, it's been a sure thing! The CKF is the type of place you can enjoy eating a meal alone, with friends or coworkers, with your spouse or significant other, or with family. Any day is a good reason to go. Why wait for a special occasion? Now that they offer curbside ""To Go"" service, you can pull up the menu online, phone in your order, drive over to the restaurant to the takeout parking spaces and call inside to let them know you are there waiting. The waitstaff delivers your food order to your car and accepts cash, debit, credit or CKF gift cards as payment. A perfect dining option for those times you are craving something from their menu but not in the mood to eat out. I have used this curbside service a few times on my way home from work when i didn't feel like cooking dinner. The inside is spacious and nicely decorated. The outside patio has lots of elbow room and is a good option from late fall to early spring here in AZ. The menu is huge. Appetizers and drinks, healthy dining options, a main course meal or just dessert and a coffee beverage are some of the many choices available. The portion sizes are plenty large to share or take home leftovers for another meal. I would have to guesstimate that over dozens of visits during the last several years, i have consumed 10's of thousands of calories. Do i regret that? Honestly, no. Each and every one of those calories has been well worth the enjoyment! So many items to love. Some of my favorites include the Chicken Samosas, Roasted Pear and Bleu Cheese Flatbread, Chinese Chicken Salad, Factory Chopped Salad, Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta, Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken, Chicken Madeira, Peach Mint Julep, and the different Signature Lemonades, Of the cheesecakes my favorites are the Dutch Apple, the Salted Caramel, the White Chocolate Raspberry and the Lemon Meringue. My most favorite menu item is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp! It's a struggle with myself every time  go there to convince myself to order other things on the menu.  i have never had less than perfect food, attentive, friendly and experienced wait staff, and an overall wonderful dining experience. Considering the food portions are quite large and the quality of the food is consistently fresh and delicious, the value is great"
Shalimar E.,"Gilbert, AZ",8,20,341,5.0,1/7/2018,"WOW WOW WOW! The Cheesecake Factory had a smile on my face & had me sayin' ""Oh yeah babe, BAM & Uhh Huh"", until 10pm last night! Hahaha. We had FABULOUS FUN! We got the new Specialty#Chicken Riesling which was an explosion of flavor in every bite! It's chicken with bacon, mushrooms, onions, garlic in a thick white wine Riesling sauce served with buttered Parmesan pasta! The BOMB!#A new fav! The chicken was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it! Everything complimented each other so well! It was a huge portion for only $13.95! I hope they keep this item on the menu because I'll get it again & again!  The Cuban rolls are always a hit!#Full of flavor as usual#the perfect appetizer! The complimentary warm bread & butter is always de-lish! Loved the classic flavorful strawberry lemonade! For dessert I tried the new Celebration cheesecake which has layers of chocolate, strawberry & vanilla cheesecake, regular cake topped with fun-fetti  cream cheese frosting! It was delicious! Loved the Neapolitan theme! Our server Amanda O. Was great! Even though it was a packed house, she was ON IT showing excellent customer service! She was constantly refilling our drinks, she was very attentive to all of our needs, and she was very sweet & friendly! If I could request a server the next time we go, I would request her in a heartbeat! We will definitely be back! The Cheesecake Factory ROCKS! :)"
Bill C.,"Chandler, AZ",169,99,52,3.0,1/4/2018,"I've been here numerous times. It's a fantastic place if you need a good variety menu. They literally have everything as far as type of food goes. I couldn't imagine them not having something for a very picky person. This place is busy, and for good reason I'm sure. Customer service is good about 60% of the time. I think it really depends on who you luck out with. Or perhaps I may have just gotten a new trainee a couple of times. Long story short, we've been admittedly forgotten about at our table on 2 different occasions. I thought this was kind of odd. Took about 1 hour and 45 minutes from sitting down to finishing our food. Clearly this is uncommon and a mistake. Mistakes happen, I get it. This is unfortunately why I can't give this place a higher rating just yet.  Cheesecake is of course wonderful, along with the rest of their menu. I haven't tried any drinks, but they also have a plentiful amount of what to choose from.  Its in a great location, right by the mall. This could also be why its very busy at around Dinner times. Its close to me, so I'm sure I'll be back in the near future to try and get this to a higher rating! :) Food quality 4/5 Customer service 3/5 Restaurant cleanliness 5/5 Value 3/5"
Thea S.,"Memphis, TN",11,50,68,2.0,1/10/2018,Shopping in Chandler AZ and stopped for a salad and martini. I'm upset that they no longer have the fresh kale salad on the menu! Boo!!!!!  That was the best Kale Salad ever! Why Cheesecake Cake Factory? Why!!!!
Jessica H.,"Phoenix, AZ",391,155,408,4.0,12/30/2017,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times since they have been open. Every time the food is so-so, but the service is good. Today, everyone really enjoyed their food: Renee's Special, Factory Burger, Kids Mac & Cheese and Kids Pizza. The service was a little slow to get our drinks and for the food to arrive, but aside from that our server was friendly and checked on us often."
Gaby G.,"Maricopa, AZ",40,54,39,4.0,1/5/2018,"Today was my first visit here and I enjoyed it. The menu has so many choices ranging from fried chicken, asian cuisine and sea food. I got the truffle-honey chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious! I recommend it. They also have a wide variety of cheese cake to pick from (over 20 types). I got the Chris's outrageous cake which is chocolate coconut cheesecake. It was rich and sweet... really hit the spot! The wait time was longer then expected but it was a Friday after noon which is typical. The service was speedy and our waitress was great. The prices are on the high end for the quality of the food but it was a great meal."
Bekah S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",49,141,272,4.0,11/18/2017,"Whenever we come here as a family we all leave happy because as you know there is truly something for everyone here. My top picks: Thai chicken lettuce wraps (this makes it in my top 5 favorites). I love how fresh everything is.  The satay chicken is perfection.  The sauces are incredible.  I could lick the tamarind cashew, wait I DO lick it... The fried zucchini and garlic ranch is delicious. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is so creamy and yummy."
Anne M.,"Chandler, AZ",54,72,137,5.0,1/1/2018,This has always been a fav place of ours. My mom loves this place and my girls grew up with this place. I grew up  eating at cheesecake factory in Brentwood. That's where my grandmother would take me so it's natural for us to love this place!
Kristen S.,"Peoria, AZ",0,8,2,5.0,1/7/2018,"We come to Cheesecake Factory every year for my birthday. This experience, by far, was the most amazing birthday I've ever had at Cheesecake. We had two servers, Justin and Corey. Justin was so helpful and attentive. He was very kind and polite - he gave us more than enough time to decide on entrees! Our other waiter, Corey, did a phenomenal job of helping us with our dessert options (he made a plan with my husband to surprise me! How cute!!!!). His charisma, patience, and welcoming vibe made all the difference in our experience. Not only do I highly recommend this Cheesecake location, but I highly recommend Corey as a server. If I knew he would be my server, I'd come to Cheesecake at least once per week!! We will definitely be back and requesting him to serve us!!  -David and Kristen Casey"
Faith A.,"Gilbert, AZ",56,53,108,3.0,7/6/2017,"What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory?  It's just okay.  The food is good, but I have not craved the food there.  I have not received bad service, but I have not received exceptional service either.  The wait is usually very long and I can talk myself into going some place else rather easily.   If you are in the mall and are hungry, check to see how long the wait is.  If the wait is short, give it a try.  If the wait is long, check Yelp for other options in the area."
Erica K.,"Chandler, AZ",33,86,155,4.0,10/26/2017,First our waitress Tara was amazing she went above and beyond to accommodate my dad. We tried the crab and artichoke dip which was great but the grilled bread that comes with was beyond toasted so it was like eating it on croutons.  The mango pineapple avocado salad was light and filling. The Shepard pie had a rich mushroom gravy but it zucchini in it which was odd.  The lettuce wraps was a fun dinner selection
Brooke P.,"Chandler, AZ",74,49,12,1.0,1/6/2018,I placed a to-go order last night. They said it would be 15 minutes. So I drove straight there because that's about how long it takes to get there. I called once I got there like they asked and they said they would run it out. I sat there for 15 minutes...waiting. Called again. They said they would bring it out. 30 minutes go by. Nothing. Literally nothing. So I just left.  THANKS FOR WASTING AN HOUR OF MY LIFE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. You suck.  Nobody even called later to see if we got our order. How sweet???
Ashley F.,"Phoenix, AZ",123,201,78,3.0,11/20/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is....a restaurant...a more expensive Chili's/Fridays/Applebees? Idk, every time I come here, I wonder to myself why I am not at a mom and pop having a much better food experience. The food is okay, kind of bland and don't even get me started and the bible that is the menu. How is anyone supposed to choose a dish when they're not entirely sure how long it will take to read it? (First World Problem) Anyways, despite the mediocre cheesecake and food, the service is always great and I can expect to take home hella leftovers, no complaints about that. Oh also, the pumpernickel bread is the ish, don't sleep on it."
Todd R.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,164,199,4.0,9/17/2017,Love the cheesecake!!!  Fatboy in the house. Time to eat the cheesecake. Mmmm... I am in heaven
Jason J.,"Lakeside, AZ",5,97,14,3.0,9/7/2017,It's like any other Cheese Cake Factory. Parking isn't a problem since it's at the mall. Wait times can be long.  We like to swing by and grab some cheese cake to go. You can get in and out quickly that way and have a nice desert for home.
Chasity R.,"Chandler, AZ",3,8,1,1.0,11/26/2017,"My boyfriend & I visited this CF last night and are iffy about returning. The wait wasn't bad at all, maybe ten minutes tops. After being seated we were provided the complimentary bread & water. We both opted to trying a mixed drink off the menu: Whiskey Smash & the Ultimate Margarita. The Smash wasn't terrible, had decent flavor but did taste a little watered down after a few sips. The Margarita, however, was terrible- tasted purely of margarita mix & nothing else; pretty much had to force it down- no sense in wasting a $10 drink. We also ordered the Corn Tamale Cakes as an appetizer. These were kinda weird; flavor was more sweet than anything. There are 3 cakes to a plate, I barely finished one and we didn't even touch the third. Our visit thus far was mediocre, but we decided to still order entrees. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken  Gumbo which was no gumbo at all. I grew up eating gumbo & have always known it to have a broth to make it almost like a soup; this was just gloopy and mush. There was absolutely no flavor, the shrimp was overcooked & extremely chewy and the rice was still hard. I took a few bites and couldn't force anymore down. It was gross.  My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair. The description talks about all this lemon, garlic flavor with some marinara sauce. This ""meal"" had absolutely no flavoring. It seemed like they made the pasta, threw a hefty helping of bruschetta tomatoes on top and threw on 5 pieces of overcooked shrimp to it & charged us $17.95. There was no sauce, no lemon/herb flavor. My boyfriend took 2 bites and pushed it to the side. It was terrible.  We immediately asked for our check & our server didn't even ask if everything was alright or if there was anything she could do. Nope, she just dropped our check off and that was that, even after seeing the full plates of food still. An $89 meal that was beyond basic and left us both feeling disappointed, frustrated and hungry."
Jr B.,"Rialto, CA",1,26,4,1.0,12/30/2017,"I waited for an hour to receive horrible service and an incorrect order ,... how do you forget to put the sides on a dish ? I do not understand? And then the rice was stale it was not soft and fluffy the way it is suppose to be made. At that point I was already starving from waiting for so long and couldn't wait any longer because my friends dishes had no issues.On top of everything the manager did not care she said I'll se what's going on with the kitchen ? What does that even mean. How are you not concerned for the pain I just endured because of your staff didnt even have the decency to apologize. I will never return to this location and be sure to tell all my associates friends family etc to go eat at the Scottsdale location it's worth the drive."
Jim V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",384,182,32,3.0,7/19/2017,"Its The Cheescake Factory. The place looks and smells great and you can always expect profesional service. As well as a massive menu and a gorgeous desert window It really is all that and perhaps more. Todays visit was a meet up with and old friend and we did enjoy our lunch in a very nice booth that was excellent for a long leisurly lunch steeped  with great conversation.  Service was attentive and it was on me when she did her check back that I had'nt noticed the kichen forgot the chicken on my salad. By the time I saw her again I made the choice not to send my half eaten salad back for revisions. It should have been made correct, or corrected/ caught by the expo and or my  server. The Chinese Chicken-less salad was stil tasty yet awkward to eat, and I can see why the impressivly massive, yet useless pile of fried white noodles made it next to impossible to see the chicken omission. Cheesecake was offered and drinks to go accepted. It was a safe spot for lunch and Im sure my salad would have been corrected, but not saying anything was just easier."
Ben D.,"Tempe, AZ",3,162,,4.0,7/31/2017,"This was my second time eating here.  I will say I do like it.  The first time was good.  I had Shepard's pie and really liked it.  This trip I had the skinny menu.  I ordered the salmon with veggies.  It was really good.  I liked the carrots that came with the dish.  I was craving something sweet and guess what I was at a cheese cake factory.  I had a cheese cake.  I love Nutella and had the cheese cake with nutella.  The nutella cheese cake was like the feeling of getting a muscle to release when I am doing yoga.  It was awesome and great at the same time.  Remember too.  Food is subjective and just because I like it does not mean you will.  I will try their raspberry cheese cake next time.   This place has a huge menu.  They list the calories too.   Is that good or bad, well that depends on you.  They do offer a skinny menu too.  I like this place and will go back to try another item on their skinny menu.  I was thinking about their steak medallions with mushrooms."
Leslie B.,"Chandler, AZ",50,156,355,4.0,6/25/2017,"Needed to try something new and I'm glad we did. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over 10 years. The restaurant is huge , clean and booths are private . The food is good, not out of this world but good . Service was good. Portions are huge , definitely shareable . We got right in on a Friday evening around 5pm. We were seated and had drink orders taken within a couple of minutes . We ordered nachos and chicken avocado club sandwich with side salad . Everything was fresh and tasty . Next time I need to eat only 1/2 of my meal so I can have a piece of cheesecake ! Or , maybe next time we hit the mall we should pick up a couple slices of cheesecake ."
T B.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,12,12,5.0,11/10/2017,Amazing staff today at the cheesecake factory. The staff came out and sang Happy birthday to our new building a bears. Storm Trooper and Chebaca
Victoria L.,"AZ, AZ",73,67,38,2.0,7/16/2017,"This location is very inconsistent. Something always happens that eliminates the level of experience you would expect from this restaurant. I go there about 4 times a week during lunch out of convenience for the location. The food is either cold, comes out way too late, or comes out incorrectly. Very rare do we get quick service that's hot and good."
Alyse B.,"New York, NY",154,17,13,3.0,8/1/2017,"Came here after work for happy hour, went on my own so sat at the bar. Their happy hour is from 4-6pm mon-fri.  They gave me a regular menu so I had to specifically ask for a happy hour menu which I feel should be given automatically during happy hour along w the regular menu. Orrr at least ask if I'd like the happy hour menu.  For happy hour some Drinks $5.95, some apps $5.95 and small plates range from $5.95-9 give or take.  I got the JW Pink Lemonade. Which is my absolute absolute favorite drink. Soo delicious, perfect blend of sweet and tart. But the calories would make me sway away from it if I have never had it or if I'm watching my caloric intake, but it was a long day so I'm my head i said ""treat yo self"" For food I got the sausage ricotta flatbread. It has sausage, ricotta, herbs, kale, and mozz(I believe). Tastes good, smaller than I hoped but it was good.  Service was alright. They asked if I wanted bread, said yes but they forgot. Prob didn't need the extra calories but I did want it.  Also don't ask them for recommendations. They always say everything ""is good just depends what you like"". Feel like they aren't honest. Just saying that whatever you ask about tastes good. Would like an honest opinions but guess that's their job."
Sylvia N.,"Gilbert, AZ",71,135,102,4.0,4/20/2017,"I used to really dislike Cheesecake Factory, mostly because it's a chain business and there's a lack of personality. The portion sizes are also ridiculously large and food too unhealthy. I avoided this place for years until the last year when someone really wanted to go here, and I forced myself to go. When I showed up, I was pleasantly surprised by their Skinnylicious menu which has options 590 calories or less. It's a sizable and diverse menu. That immediately won me over. Of course the other large portions/unhealthy options are still there, but I can appreciate the increased sensitivity to a nutrition-conscious customer. Flash forward another few months, Cheesecake Factory started including calorie information on their menu. Another added bonus. I know nutrition in America is heading in this direction but nevertheless, I am still impressed. They offer bread as an appetizer that always arrives at the table warm! Menu options are bountiful and food types vary greatly. Everything usually tastes good. Their cheesecake is AMAZING! But, it's extremely sugary and fatty so beware. Specifically for this location, they always seem to have good customer service, one of their redeeming factors. Their wait staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and professional. They're always quick no matter how busy they are. The hostesses are always nice, despite the chaos of large crowds. There is usually a wait varying from 5-90 minutes during busy hours. I went there today and the wait was maybe 5 minutes. When my name was called, I started walking up but saw someone else walk up to the hostess desk and claim herself as Sylvia. This other person may have heard wrong and something completely innocent happened, but when I finally made my way there and told them I was Sylvia, they apologized profusely for what had happened and seated me immediately. It wasn't their fault this happened, but I still appreciated the way the handled it."
Jeni P.,"Chandler, AZ",0,4,2,2.0,10/28/2017,"I'm giving it two stars because of poor service. The food is good, but the poor service really ruined my experience.  My fiancé and I sat at the bar and the bartender took a long time to greet us, then we had to call her back over to order. I ordered my drink, she went and got it, then never even asked my fiancé what he would like. Since she was so rude, I hurried and finished my drink so we could just leave."
Tracy Tram T.,"Gilbert, AZ",340,153,272,1.0,5/6/2017,"Tonight 's dining experience May 6,2017 is such a joke. We waited 40minutes to get the table, and when we finally did, we waited another 50minutes for the food to come out. Needless to say every order coming out at different time. Ahi tartare was too sour, chicken Samosas had lack of favor. Also, the Salmon Entree, meatball and spaghetti, Seared Shrimp with Angel Hair were worse than what I can actually make at home.  The whole bill was $100 with tip, and we left feeling ripped off and unsatisfied!  We will never come back! First time and also last time!"
Christa M.,"El Paso, TX",46,379,672,4.0,9/26/2016,"The wait tonight wasn't bad at all. We arrived around 6:30 pm and were seated within 10 minutes. Our server was friendly and quickly came on over to take our drinks, and bring over the yummy bread basket they start you on with.  Our orders consisted of: Chicken carbonara: Yummy! Just perfect!  Shrimp jambalaya: Good, full of flavor! Kids chicken alfredo: Creamy! My niece loved it! Shrimp with angel hair: This plate is NOT worth $19. Consisted of 4 pieces of shrimp and TONS of diced tomato and pasta. This should be renamed to a diced tomato with angel hair plate. Skip it! All in all the ambience is perfect, the building is beautiful, and of course the cheesecake is YUMMY!"
Lisa M.,"Chandler, AZ",217,5,2,3.0,12/8/2017,The food was really slow getting to us. Our waiter acted deaf and didn't hear requests. My vegetables were way undercooked or just plain cold.
Carter H.,"Chandler, AZ",2,28,34,3.0,10/14/2017,The cheese cake factory was good. Only went for dessert. I liked it but the floor was slippery and didn't have a sign. Also huge overflowed trash can in front of the restaurant.
Nadine D.,"Chandler, AZ",81,100,229,5.0,3/23/2017,Best cheesecakes ever! I still have a few on my list and I would have tried them all. My favorites are the banana cheesecake and the strawberry cheesecake!!
Carly I.,"Chandler, AZ",177,102,47,3.0,8/10/2017,I'm struggling to give them 3 stars. They were not terrible but this location was also not impressive. The service was ok and I was a little disappointed the happy hour ended at 6. This place was convenient but not what I wanted for my Friday afternoon.
Sam S.,"Gilbert, AZ",47,215,90,4.0,2/4/2017,"I've been to this location a few times.  I love the food, ambiance and service.  This visit though, the food took too long to come.  With a 4 year old, this is an issue."
Ed H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,31,10,3.0,12/19/2017,"I have mixed feelings about this place. Parking is almost always difficult and there are not many handicapped spaces. We were seated promptly and our server, Brooks, was great. Two of us were happy with the food, the lunch salmon and the orange chicken. My double bacon burger was excellent. My wife can not eat black pepper. In spite of the huge menu she could not find anything she could eat so she got breakfast food. Even with that, the fried potatoes had black pepper on them, they were supposed to have been made plain. All her favorites are gone so we won't be going back."
William L.,"Chandler, AZ",33,175,48,4.0,5/9/2017,"Ate with the family here recently. We brought along some family friends as well so had a total of 4 children in kid seats and they accommodated us very well. We ended up order the miso salmon, fish and chips, and bbq chicken salad. The waitress was awesome as during our wait she brought out banana and bread plates for all the kids to enjoy (also to keep them quiet I think haha). The fish and chips were delicious, cooked perfectly and crispy. The bbq chicken salad was delicious as well. Our friend commented that the miso salmon was to ""die for,"" I'll take that as a compliment. The portion size was also generous. Overall, I would definitely return to the Cheesecake Factory with my family."
Rain B.,"London, United Kingdom",5,369,93,2.0,7/2/2017,"OMG Calorie content of children meals!! Check out the children meals before ordering, the calorie content is more than an average adult meal!"
Keerthi V.,"Gilbert, AZ",14,59,78,3.0,7/3/2017,"We came here for my brother's birthday. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory here but this was my first time here as a vegan. Our waiter was really nice and helpful. She answered all my questions and went back to the kitchen to ask about my food allergies. I really appreciate everything she did, they just didn't have many options. I was hungry so I wanted avocado toast or a pasta but their bread and pastas have eggs baked in. One of their complimentary breads was eggless so our waiter brought a basket of that for me which was so sweet. I ended up ordering the falafel sandwich without any cheese. I didn't like it very much. The falafel did not taste very good, it was really mushy and tasted kind of sour. We had really good service and my family liked their food, but it wasn't good for vegan options. I don't think I'll be coming here again."
Mary F.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,110,48,3.0,10/1/2016,"Popped in here for dinner and a drink after a long week. I love Cheesecake Factory and all I needed (wanted) in my life was a slice of their cheesecake. Long story short, I didn't get it. Sad day.  The wait was practically nonexistent, though I did have to wait for just a few minutes for the hostess to return, since there was seemingly only one on duty for the beginning of dinner. Not terrible. We sat down and this is where the waiting really happened. It took a little while to get waters, then to get our drinks ordered, and then to order. A lot of time was spent waiting for the waiter to come back and check up on us and to get our bill. I needed to get going for a movie, and I knew that if I had ordered that darn cheesecake, we would have been sitting around even longer. I'll come back here for sure, but I was just less than impressed with my experience this time around."
CheRich R.,"Peoria, AZ",34,76,118,4.0,12/10/2016,We had a certificate for 50$ to go since our last experience was bad in Glendale. We decided to come here and it was way better. The waitress was nice. The lemon drop tasted great. I ordered pork chops with applesauce mac n cheese and asparagus. The pork chop was good but a little tougher than I'd like. The flavor on everything was good. My husband got chipotle chicken sandwich and it was perfectly done with fries. The ambience was romantic and cozy! We enjoyed ourselves I just wish they didn't charge 5$ just to change mash potatoes and greens beans to Mac n asparagus...
Red B.,"Port Augusta West, Australia",5,40,13,4.0,6/7/2017,"Good food with a calorie counter. Portions from huge to ""shareable ""  Lots of variety in their use of spices, sauces & mouthwatering 'bites'. Inside can be a little noisy, but outside is lovely and cool. My one tip ( and hence only 4*'s ) is beware that the food may not be hot enough early in the day. Not helped by cold plates either.  I will always return, but not for an early lunch."
Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1416,1110,17405,4.0,12/14/2016,"Seems like this place is always packed, no matter the date or time. Staff is always friendly and the kitchen is accommodating. My favorite item here is the fried mac and cheese. My favorite cheesecake is the Snickers variety. I also really enjoyed the fudge cake."
