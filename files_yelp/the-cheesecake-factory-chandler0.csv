Chris B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,5.0,11/21/2015,Love their cheesecake it is good for your soul. The atmosphere is good and the food is great as well. Recommend this place to all I see
Courtney H.,"Mesa, AZ",1,28,,5.0,11/11/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory, and I just discovered their amazing happy hour. For around $5.50 you can get a regular sized appetizer in the bar. It's a nice alternative to $20+ meal you would normally pay if you were dining in for dinner. I like the atmosphere. Occasionally my husband will call in car side to go - and the order is perfect every time!"
J P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,390,,1.0,2/20/2014,"For reasons I don't fully understand I tried to eat here tonight.  As usual getting a seat was a chore...whether the place is crowded or not (not in this case). Anyhow I sit down, menus arrive and then some moron walks up to talk with the folks in the table behind me and he's smoking a e-pipe!!!!   Really!!!!????  WTF!!!!! Cheesecake Factory I'm putting this one on you for allowing it to happen.  I'm done with you. If zero was a choice I'd go with that."
Kim T.,"Chandler, AZ",0,10,,1.0,5/11/2015,Dirty and expensive. Watched a busser drop silverware on the floor and just picked it up put it in the napkin as the next place setting!   Made me want to vomit!   What do they do that people can't see?
Mary S.,"Phoenix, AZ",255,628,389,4.0,3/14/2014,"The restaurant was busy on a Thursday night which makes my heart happy. I love to see businesses thriving in AZ.  The service was fantastic. I was only in tonight for dessert and coffee. However,  I have eaten at CF many times and have never had a bad meal. They have great pasta dishes and a yummy Aloha themed salad. Today I had a piece of their Coconut and chocolate flavored cheesecake. It was of course yummy. Thank you Jodi for your wonderful service."
Ashley A.,"Tempe, AZ",165,8,2,5.0,7/20/2015,"My boyfriend and I went in last night for our 3 yr anniversary and we had such a great time. Our server, Desiree, was the absolute best. I love the brown bread there and she ended up bringing us lots of it. The food came out quickly and delicious. And to top it all off at the end when she brought us our cheesecake she decorated the cheesecakes and put candles on them. I'm really happy we went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate our 3 yr, and I'm really happy we got Desiree. ASK FOR HER."
Mya T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",105,352,14,4.0,1/6/2014,"Great location, sucky parking.  Being so close to the mall you have to drive around and find something.  The food was what I have come to expect. They were able to accommodate our party of 10 in a matter of minutes (lunch made that easier, I think).  The staff was attentive and the price was right."
Manny B.,"Gilbert, AZ",22,49,13,1.0,12/4/2013,"We went there for my birthday. The bread was cold and HARD. The butter that came with the bread was not soft (almost seemed like it was just taken out of fridge). So that wasn't a very good start of the meal. The food quality was good (what I expect from Cheesecake factory).  The worst part was when we told that bread was cold/hard and if we can get some fresh bread, they had nothing to offer. They said it was all like that. Really? Love Olive Garden and Carrabbas for their bread and service."
Natasha V.,"Sebastian, FL",26,64,5,4.0,5/12/2015,"The place I will always remember, the place I got engaged! They always have great food! My favorite is their ranch and Caesar dressings! Cheesecakes to die for! And the staff is always great and on top of everything. Only one time I was feeding soup to my 2 year old and there was a paper clip inside his soup that my husband took a bite of. But you know restaurants arn't always perfect, but this place is way better then some. I love the Cheesecake Factory!"
Juan E.,"Fullerton, CA",325,209,5053,5.0,4/2/2015,Mom had just got out of her surgery and was hungry. she hadn't eaten all day. So I had suggested Cheesecake factory. I know she loves to cook for me. But she had just had eye surgery and you have to treat your mom. So we went. We arrived and it must have just been before the dinner rush. We got seated right away. Soon after we saw lots of people coming in. The place was getting full . Mom didn't want a lot. She was saving herself for some pie. she ordered the nachos app. and a salad. the side salad was great but the nachos were over whelming for her. Her eye got really big. she knew she couldn't finish them. As a good son I helped put a nice dent to it. I gat the spicy chicken pasta with asparagus. It was great. I almost didn't want to get a piece of pie. But we were here. And we were an hour away form home. Not chance on taking that home. So we got a piece. Each. Yup she went with the favorite. Fresh strawberries on top of her pie. I went with the Apple strudel. It was amazing like always. Are plates were great proportion. The pie was also great. Our waiter gave us great service. Had mom laughing . Over all they made me look great. Mom was pleased and full. Can't beat that.
Alexandra M.,"Chandler, AZ",208,7,3,3.0,9/3/2015,"The servers are nice , but overall it was expensive and the food wasn't tasting expensive . When our hostess sat us down there was just trash and food everywhere under the booth . It was disgusting . Especially the fact I worked in a restaurant.  It urged me to get a manager out there . I've seen the place get packed but I don't see why this place is so well know for if the food is not very accommodating ."
Paul V.,"Chandler, AZ",72,154,2516,1.0,8/4/2013,"I don't understand this place.  The wait was long (40 minutes); lucky of us, the shopping mall distracted us.  I had the spicy cashew chicken over rice.  It was NOT spicy; the chicken was bland (because it was pre-boiled?); the sauce was pure hoisin from a jar. Did the cook put the entire jar of hoisin sauce in this dish, and not other spice? The sauce and the chicken did not go together at all.  My wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap.  It was OK at best. We ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream. It was way too sweet; spoon for spoon, pure sugar would be less sweet. Only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good. Oh, one more good thing was the complementary bread and butter served ahead of the meal. The service was average.  So, why is this place so crowded that we had to wait 40 minutes for a table? The chance I returned to this restaurant is very slim. Not recommended."
Ashley D.,"Chandler, AZ",32,97,26,4.0,10/19/2013,Great service. Great food. I always get the Santa Fe salad or the bang bang chicken. Yum! The cheesecakes are always a good plus- if I'm not that hungry!
Mike S.,"Maricopa, AZ",19,56,4,5.0,8/4/2015,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory.  Every location I've been, wether in Chicago, Phoenix, Orange County, I've never been disappointed.  Their Salads are always fresh and rich with quality.  My go to dish is the Romano Crusted Chicken.  A rich, buttery sensational taste that is not for the calorie conscious, but that's what it takes to get flavor in any dish.   Lately, I've been enjoying their burgers.  Today I had the Classic burger which was simply one of the better burgers I've ever had.  A side of blue cheese smothered salad and I was in heaven.  Service always depends on the server you get.  Sometimes it is very good and sometimes it's meh! Only once in Chicago I would say I had a bad experience, the rest have been very good. So, if you're not one of those that simply won't step foot in a chain restaurant, I think the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent restaurant."
Neka D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,128,34,3.0,10/19/2014,"I've been here a few times for dinner so this was my first time trying brunch.  The mimosas were good.  I ordered a made to order omelette and my boyfriend ordered the French toast. My omelette was awesome.  My only complaint was the toast that accompanied it was overcooked.  The food took awhile to arrive which was disappointing.  Plus, our waitress wasn't very attentive and couldn't even bother to smile.  I was really surprised because I've visited numerous locations over the years and I've never had a bad waitress until now.  Hence, the three stars.  As we were walking out, no one bothered to say 'have a nice day'.  There were numerous hostesses just standing around.  I definitely won't be visiting this location again."
Ron D.,"Chandler, AZ",0,8,1,3.0,1/10/2016,"The food has been great here but today my wife and I  had a similar reaction after eating the mushroom burger. Don't know why yet. Talked to manager,"
Doris H.,"Mesa, AZ",3,5,,5.0,6/2/2015,"I took my friend  here for the first time. We both had the Cobb Salad and it was so good we also had cheesecake for dessert, we both had the sugar free to take home. My friend wants to go back again."
Kirk M.,"Chandler, AZ",58,26,38,5.0,3/24/2015,"If you want choices then you get them at Cheesecake Factory.   The service is always great but make sure you know what your getting because flavors varry from what you might expect.   For instance,  don't get a burger because it's not their specialty.  Salads and pricier dishes are.  If you not ready to spend $20 a person then you'd be better off going to Chipolte."
Art L.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",4,10,1,3.0,5/12/2015,"This place has a great variety in their menu. A bit too much I think, the service was average our waiter was a bit forgetful. The food was good overall I would recommend this place."
Christine H.,"Chandler, AZ",3,24,1,5.0,3/19/2015,"Ate here tonight and everything was perfect! There was a 20 min wait even for a Wednesday, our server, Desirae (sp?), was amazing and completely on top of everything, food was fantastic with huge proportions and I can't forget the cheesecake that we took togo. Everything was great!!"
