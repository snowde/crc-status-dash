Veronica E.,"Whittier, CA",213,85,83,5.0,3/7/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory. This wasn't my first time here and won't be my last. Everyone is always so nice and the food is always so good. I highly recommend this place for any type of occasions. S'mores cheesecake is one of the best cheesecakes hands down !!
T J.,"Tempe, AZ",2,49,38,1.0,6/24/2017,"This Chandler location has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The General Manager, Ariana, was extremely unhelpful in getting the matter resolved. I had to write to corporate office, which was much more understanding and was the epitome of customer service. For that reason, and from other reviews I have read there, it is THIS location that has bouts of poor customer service. The other locations are fine. Our large events will be held elsewhere."
Jennifer K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",52,3,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has always been my favorite go-to restaurant until tonight and I'm hugely disappointed in the service received. Granted it was busy but we sat at the smallest table so close to other couples they may as well have been sitting in our laps. My fiancé ordered the Orange Chicken without the Orange zest because it tastes nasty with pieces of orange peel garnished all over it...I don't blame him, I agree nobody likes orange peel. So the waitress acknowledges that yes indeed he ordered it without orange zest and sends it back. Out comes the manager to further clarify that he didn't want orange zest. Offers a side salad or soup on the house. Meanwhile I'm more than halfway through my meal which tastes fine ... A little on the dry side but I always get it but at that point I felt bad eating in front of my fiancé so I pause for a bit. A bit turns into 20 minutes he still hasn't gotten his food yet and at this point I want a box for mine. Usually when a customer hasn't eaten there food or touched it after chowing down it... usually constitutes the need for a box. Nope...everyone else around us got boxes. I try to get the waitresses attention but all I got was an eye roll. My fiancé finally gets his meal and it's mediocre, he finishes and the waitress is eager to get us out of there so she grabs the food. Doesn't offer us Cheesecake, or boxes. Peace Cheesecake Factory! You lost a loyal customer."
Omari D.,"Tempe, AZ",76,181,258,2.0,8/30/2015,"I'm not a big fan of the menu that has 1000 things but I know people like it so I will keep my review unbiased. The choices are overwhelming but the one thing I'm not a fan of is you can't 'tweak' you food items. Can't add more garlic remove some key items as a lot of things are pre-packaged, in particular the sauces. About the only thing I could add was salt or pepper. Staff was good and I enjoy the variety of bread, but the wait was a killer.  Would I return, probably of requested by someone but keep to something simple."
Andrew D.,"Chandler, AZ",14,101,58,4.0,5/29/2016,I love the cheese cake factory have been going to this place for years! The last time I went was a bad experience hence why I am giving 4 stars! But that one experience isn't enough for me to stop going here! 95 percent of the time they are accurate and also the food is always prepared as expected !
Lucas S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,2,5.0,1/10/2017,Well everyone knows the Cheesecake Factory the food is rich and makes you smile very wide! This location especially always has a wonderful wait staff that are very quick clean and courteous! Today we had Connor the extremely handsome waiter that really understood our bread needs he had a great smile and was really quick to help us out! Oh and the cheesecake was pretty good too!
Helen N.,"Gilbert, AZ",17,36,24,2.0,2/12/2016,We waited almost 45 mins for food to come out and they brought the wrong order !  Never come back to this place . He waitress should have repeated what we ordered the first place very inexperience staffs !
Georgie M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2925,1212,6397,4.0,1/18/2014,"I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory. I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe. On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link:  So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good.  A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's ""BurGR"". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow.  Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top.  Absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL Enjoy!"
C J D.,"Ahwatukee, AZ",154,189,170,4.0,6/24/2015,"The Cheesecake is of course always great. Very rich, you may want to split a slice.  Ambiance is very decorative with elaborately painted décor. Can be casual or dressy, depending on how you want to roll.  Crab cakes and flat breads are very good. Plenty of meat in your pasta. Overall, I have had nothing bad here. Some of the meals are average, most are good. Big Portions. Great place to split an appetizer, a meal and slice of cheesecake."
Gerard R.,"Chandler, AZ",10,11,2,1.0,8/26/2016,Will never be back.  When you spend $200 for dinner you expect at the very least a semi decent meal/experience.
John T.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",17,155,3,2.0,9/25/2016,"Typical of chain restaurants these days. Only ate here because we had a gift card. We like to try and keep our business local instead of supporting big corporations. Food was mediocre and cold when it came out. The Bang, bang chicken and shrimp didn't have any bang at all. My wife had greasy fish and chips with cold french fries and didn't want finish it. On the positive side, the drinks and service were good and the manager did come by to tell us our food was going to be out in a few. Didn't want to wait again after the cold food was served."
Eddie R.,"Casa Grande, AZ",2,15,1,5.0,11/28/2016,"Went to the cheescake factory this weekend. Service was great and our server was amazing, however the food was not cooked as ordered. Managment was very understanding and rectified the situation right away so that is always a plus. Kudos to them and their staff."
Lauren K.,"Phoenix, AZ",131,37,12,4.0,10/1/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always lit. Their food is really good and although it's pricey, the portion sizes are massive so it's worth it. I also really liked the drink i got, it was a blueberry mojito and it was bomb. Our waiter did take a while to come around to take our order and all of that, but it was pretty busy and most importantly he was really nice :) definitely a great location to go! but, it is a little loud so if you enjoy quiet restaurants i would not choose this one haha"
Luke K.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2/18/2017,Tried to place a to-go order. After being transferred to the bakery with 3 attempts and sitting on the phone for over 20 minutes and still nobody picking up - I'll find another restaurant tonight. Pretty disappointed in the outcome.
Amy N.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,14,44,4.0,1/22/2016,"You could say I'm a regular... I've been coming about once or twice a month for the past 5 years, give or take. My recommendation- go ahead, take the time and read the menu. This place is known for their novel-length selection with literally hundreds of items and unique bites. Consistently mediocre service, great ambiance, and they always have exactly what you're in the mood for from sushi to barbecue. Oh, and cheesecake. Yeah that's pretty much the whole reason I love this place.  Between friends and family, I've seen and tried a huge amount but my go-to is a dinner-sized appetizer with a few substitutions. It's called the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I substitute the noodles with avocado and the chicken with salmon. It's super healthy, the dips are to die for, and lasts me at least two meals. Some of my other favorites, and slightly less healthy options, include the Mac And Cheese burger and Chicken Bellagio (ask for extra sauce). You really can't go wrong with those. My mom swears by the kale quinoa salad and proclaims it's the best kale she's ever had.  Okay as for the cheesecakes, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake is my newest favorite- replacing my previous favorite of Ultimate Red Velvet. It was seasonal this fall (2015) and became a part of the menu due to popular demand. I'm SO glad. I absolutely love cheesecake and have one each time I go. Other favorites include the White Chocolate and Reece's Peanut Butter Cup."
Nancy M.,"Chandler, AZ",22,463,730,5.0,4/4/2015,"You really can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.  Their menu is huge - maybe too big - so there's definitely something for everyone!  This visit was a good one, as expected.  Our server Audrey was great and took good care of us.  If I ever had a complaint with Cheesecake Factory it would be about the ridiculous wait times (because they are so popular) but we were really lucky on this trip and only had a 15 minute wait.  Yahoo!"
Carmelo W.,"Glendale, AZ",196,457,60,4.0,12/3/2015,"Had a wait to deal with, but mostly because we had a large party. We ate pretty well and enjoyed our food and drinks. Of course I loved the cheesecake!"
The Yelp Sheriff ..,"Oakland, CA",1,5,,5.0,4/28/2016,"Came here with my Lobster (Friends reference) and she thought it would be cool to come here for happy hour. I didn't know they had a happy hour and boy was I pleased. Cheap beers, cheap appetizers, and great service. Our server Damon was the best, funny and great with not only us but his other tables that I noticed.  Making this my regular happy hour spot. Especially with those Mac & Cheese balls.  They were BAWWWLINNNN'!! Best service ever and keep it up. From your boy, The Yelp Sheriff!"
Amber M.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,28,6,1.0,5/18/2016,"First off let me start by saying I have been dining at Cheesecake factory for over 12 years in various location my favorite being Marina Del Rey, Ca and the Beverly center in Los Angeles.  I am so disappointed and disgusted with the level of service and the quality of food that I experienced just recently at this location.   1.  We sat outside near the fountain, sounds nice until you sit down to a wobbly table and bird poop all over the chairs.  When we ask for a clean chair we get another one with more bird poop.  We fix the table ourselves. While there we are repeatedly splashed w/water and as the AZ sun starts to go down BLINDED by it.  DO NOT SIT OUTSIDE the planning was unthoughtful to the diner. 2.  After we order pasta carbonara and grilled shrimp salad we wait for over 45 min.  On top of that the waitress was stingy w/bread (c'mon we were hungry) and gave us no communication about our food.  Meanwhile 6 people have sat after us, received their food and 3 left.  We ask and are told it will be out soon, NO Apologioes 3.  Food arrives...My shrimp are cold, my lettuce is wilted  and the pasta has lil sauce (my hubby always orders the same thing and this was mediocre) and is coagulated.   We ask for a manager he reluctantly apologizes and after I say I'm not paying offers to take the food off the bill, which I felt no guilt for because we didn't eat it at all....... Thank God for the lil bread that we did get! I will never go back to this location...... Sadly I will have to dine at a ""real"" Cheesecake factory in LA where they are accustomed to the ""brand"" a bit better"
Dave H.,"Florence, AZ",0,8,,5.0,10/21/2016,"I had skinny turkey and avocado sandwich. Small portion was perfect came with some salad greens. I had ice tea with lemon to drink. The waitress kept my drink full. For dessert I had the mango keylime cheese cake. Highly recommend that flavor. So yummy. We had a very good experience and service was good. All and all everything was above average. Total bill for three dessert, drinks, one skinny sandwich was just over $60. We will come again."
