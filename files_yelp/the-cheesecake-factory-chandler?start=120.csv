Devi M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,32,,3.0,10/21/2016,"We like the CF ambience and taste of the food, but it is often very starchy, high in fat, and salty.  It's convenient when you are out shopping and get hungry!"
SC W.,"Chandler, AZ",16,44,7,1.0,6/2/2016,Major food poisoning at this place.  Had diarrhea for 3 days 2 hours after eating there.  Wife vomited for 2 days.  First bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory.  Won't be going back to this location.  Found out others online have also had food poisoning here.  Health department needs to do some serious regular checking of this location.
S M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,111,6,2.0,3/14/2017,The worst service out of all the Cheesecake restaurants I've visited. Ran out of bread and our food took a very long time to arrive. Wouldn't recommend. Front desk was also unfriendly.
Judie F.,"Casa Grande, AZ",14,2,,1.0,1/17/2017,Overrated. Overpriced. Can't imagine having to wait 2 hours for a table for mediocre food. Word of advice - eat somewhere else first and come here for dessert. Your taste buds and your wallet will thank you.
Syna D.,"Tucson, AZ",14,6,,1.0,9/15/2015,"Called in an order for a cheesecake for a birthday party and was told I could stop by the ""curbside to go"" and they would bring the cake out for me. I told them I would be there at 530 and they said they would have the cake ready for me at that time.  I called right before I arrived and I was told they will send somebody out immediately. 5 minutes later a customer arrives and within a minute, the attendant comes out and serves them. I immediately talk to that attendant and he says they will be right with me. Ten minutes pass and I give them a call again and they said they didn't know I was out there waiting. Fifteen minutes now and another customer pulls up behind me and is served. The waitress had no idea I was there again. When I asked for the manager the manager came out and said there was nothing he would do to compensate me for my time. He said that it is my fault for not letting them know I was outside despite the fact that I called twice and talked to two attendants about having waited for someone to help. I understand that mistakes happen in the service industry but to come out after 15 minutes of waiting and two different customers being served before me and have the manager tell me that I was at fault was not worth an overpriced 60 dollar cheesecake. On top of that, the cheesecake was still frozen an hour and half after I picked it up even though they told me they had left it to thaw two hours before I got there! I will never come here again and I don't recommend anybody else to go here either. Go somewhere local. At least your business will be appreciated."
Mary H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,59,9,3.0,8/20/2016,"Everything started off very good. Greeted quickly by the female bartender working, and drinks and food were served in a timely manner.  We ordered Thai lettuce wraps and fire roasted artichoke, and both were amazing. Couldn't of been happier with our decisions.  What bothered me was not being offered another drink well after I was done with my first and about to take my last bite of dinner, so I wasn't really in the mood to order another one anymore. Next, I looked at my bill and was charged for the more expensive of the two wines when I had asked just for the house wine which would be the cheapest of the two at most places, so I was kind of disappointed that she decided to just give and charge me what she wanted. It was only $2 more and the wine was actually very good, so I didn't mention it since I had finished the wine, if I had ordered another, maybe I would have brought it up.  Female bartender leaves and now left with the male who was working the well the majority of the time we were there. He's very nice and checks to see if we want dessert. I tell him I'm going to look, and decide to just order espressos for my fiancé and myself. Five minutes go by after ordering and I excuse myself to the bathroom. I come back and still no espressos, and he says they are being checked on... Now well over 15 minutes, he says they are being checked on.. Comes back to tell us they aren't ready... 25 minutes go by.... Tells us again they aren't ready but ensures us that they are coming. I'm over the espressos. I ask him to cancel and rering my card without them. I go outside and 5 minutes later my fiancé tells me they are there. I appreciate getting them being taken off but I honestly didn't want them anymore and they were not very hot, and not offered any sugar or spoon for the drinks. It wasn't the bartenders fault but just disappointed in 30 minute espressos... And pretty upset that it took longer to get the espressos than the time it took to order and eat our dinner... My fiancé said the manager came over and apologized for the espresso while I was outside, and had removed them from our bill, but didn't seem to want to make up for taking so long on what should of been a quick after dinner drink.."
Emily N.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,2,1,1.0,6/3/2016,"DON'T eat here if you're vegan.  First off, I ordered the veggie burger without cheese or mayo. My friends ordered pizza and shrimp pasta. By the time their food came out and they were done eating, my food still hadn't come out. I eventually had to just ask for them to bring my food out in a box because it was taking way too long. Additionally, my sister ordered Mac and cheese and it was never brought out. And throughout all this, the waitress never mentioned how long the food was going to take, and never apologized for the poor service.  Then, get this. The waiter asked me if I wanted cheesecake. I kindly told her that I couldn't have dairy products and she told me she would bring me out a chocolate fudge cake. I was a bit confused if this cake was going to be vegan or not, but I let her bring it out anyways because I didn't want to make things complicated. But when she did eventually bring it out, it was covered in whipped cream. I never got much of an apology and no discount on my food, which would have made things a lot better. The whole experience just wasn't very great and I don't reccomend this location."
Sasha G.,"Flagstaff, AZ",0,1,,1.0,8/29/2017,"I called to place an order to-go. The lady who answered placed me on hold and transferred me to bakery. I'm not sure why but maybe that's how they place their phone orders? I was on hold for nearly 15 minutes and when someone finally answered, I began to place my order. However, this other lady tells me I can't place an order to-go because the mall is shutting down for the night. Ok but your business is posted to be open until 11pm and you have your own entrance/exit to your restaurant outside the mall. What does the mall have to do with whether I can place an order over the phone? I'm not from the area but when I'm near a Cheesecake Factory location, I like to treat myself. I have eaten at this CF location before and I've never had an issue but this changes things. I do not appreciate having not been informed immediately that I would not be able to place an order (because the mall is shutting down for the evening) and I do not appreciate being placed on hold for nearly 15 minutes only to be left disappointed. I was so looking forward to the cheesecake too!!!!!!!!"
Grant C.,"Tempe, AZ",39,71,61,5.0,9/3/2016,We went here for a friends birthday  and there was about 25 of us we tried to make reservations they said that they can not make them for Friday nights at 7 pm but the manager said he will do his best to make sure we are seated ASAP. Most of the people got there at 630 and we had a table and everyone seated at 7. We sat on the patio and had one waitress who would some times get help from another waiter. They both went above and beyond to make sure that the whole group was happy.  We all got our drinks at the same time and all got food with in minutes of one another. (Most of the time in big groups someone doesn't get their food for about 15 min after everyone has already got theirs) they had a great staff who knew the menu and had wonderful recommendations. I always like asking he waitress what her favorite drink is and trying it same with the food. She did not disappoint. Between 25 of us there was not one complaint and the birthday girl was extremely happy. All in all it was a great experience I have been to this location many times and have always had good service but it is mostly just a date night or couples date night. Never this big of a group ant they really impressed me.   Sorry this took so long to post we went there on August 26th. Friday at 7 pm.
Salomé H.,"Phoenix, AZ",31,130,126,1.0,5/15/2016,Eh. Came here Saturday 5/14 with my sisters. We got the avocado egg rolls which were delicious. I ordered the shrimp with angel hair. It was kind of pathetic. The shrimp was so dry and overcooked. Like way overcooked. It was also kind of spicy which I don't remember being in the description. The noodles were a little bland. This dish was nothing spectacular. Kind of a disappointment. I didn't want to be a pain so I didn't tell the waitress how bad it was. Next time we want to go out to dinner it won't be here.
Anthony B.,"Mesa, AZ",10,21,,3.0,9/12/2016,I love eating here. The menu has so many options to fulfill what you are in the mood for. Deserts of couse are excellent and should be given the name. Only problem I always seem to encounter is just how slow the service always is. Just never seems to be enough staff to cover the need. Weekends always has a line out the door which unfortunately is common around here. I'd love to eat there more often but I do not wish to spend hours to do it.
Charley E.,"Tempe, AZ",231,4,,3.0,2/24/2016,"I'd like to preface this review as it is my first as a starving food critic.  First off the atmosphere in here is nice but very dim and hard on the eyes.  Ok now the food. I had the Crispy Cuban Egg Rolls. They were delicious, at the Scottsdale chain(previously went and had the sampler).  The ham and Swiss is perfectly melted onto the wrap to make it melt in your mouth. The mustard sauce is the proverbial cherry on top. 4.5 stars.  For dessert I got the chocolate mousse cheesecake. One word, delicious. It is one of the best cakes I've had here. The presentation of it makes it look like a 5 star restaurant, taste included. Biting in, the vanilla mascarpone is the first thing that hits the taste buds. It is creamy and rich yet not overwhelming. Next, getting into the chocolate. The mousse was delicious and not too overwhelming. Overall the flavors blend together to create a perfect dessert. 5 stars.  My only trouble here was the service. If I didn't say when, then why did you stop with the mozzarella?  Overall 3/5."
Yvonne G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",63,406,197,4.0,10/14/2015,"We tried this Cheesecake Factory after having a dismal experience at another Cheesecake factory further north than this one.  A couple's dinner and we ordered the following: Avocado Salad,  Fresh and delicious.  Not overdressed.  Chicken Piccata with pasta and plenty of Parmagiano Reggiano, grated right in front of you.   Delicious and perfectly made. Eggplant Parmagiana with Pesto Pasta,  Really delicious.  Sauce was great.  Pesto pasta was not overly aggressive with garlic.  It was just right.   Kobe Burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms and sweet potato fries. Had this because there were no turkey burgers.  The Kobe Burger was OK but nothing to write home about.  Sweet potato fries were good.   The bread was delicious but we had to ask about 3 times before we got our first service of bread although the place was not packed.  Tasty bread.  Other than that, the service was good as they kept our waters refreshed.   I will admit that I was shocked by how good their pasta dish was.  I normally don't even try italian dishes at non-italian restaurants but the waiter, Jesus, convinced me it was a wonderful dish.   It was refreshing to go to a Cheesecake Factory and have a meal that I don't have to complain about.  I just want good food and good service and I got it at this Cheesecake Factory."
Christina D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",566,91,525,5.0,10/25/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. The best thing about this restaurant is the amount of items on their menu. They literally have something for every body. They have a Skinnylicious menu, which is what I always order from. You can order your appetizers, main course, desert, and drinks from this menu. The cheesecake is to die for and I have a couple favorite. Right now my two favorites are Vanilla Bean and Tuxedo, I'm classic with cheesecake and ice-cream. This location was nice. It's very convenient seeing that it's attached to the mall. I wouldn't come her on a dinner date due to that reason but it's perfect for after your shopping trip. A lot better than the food court! Customer service was good, nothing special but nothing bad either. Overall, I'd recommend this location for a day after shopping."
j b.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,104,90,1.0,10/9/2015,I love cheese cake factory. And I keep going to this location because it's by my house. But for what ever reason they almost always screw up the entries. One time we ordered cheese cake and it was frozen. Yes it's not made fresh and shipped from California.  When I was back in Cali I ate and they got the order right and it was amazing. Tonight the chicken was terrible so over cooked it was like eating turkey jerky. Almost no sauce so we sent it back . Second time it was worse so we ordered something different. Came out great but the mashed potatoes ice cold not warm at all. This is a sign of a major problem in my opinion. Honestly I have eaten here at least two dozen times.  More than half the time the food is not right. Proof is the fact that they have only three stars. Guess I'm not the only one. Just wish they could be as good as the California locations.  I'll report back next time.
Meme G.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,48,22,5.0,2/10/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!!! This particular one in Chandler is great. The food and service is consistently done well. The menu is HUGE. Victor S. was our server this time. He was professional, polite, and attentive. He was very quick in delivering our drinks, bread, and appetizer. The food we ordered came out hot and delicious.   My favorites are the Blazing Buffalo bites, Skinny MOJITO, Almond Crusted Salmon Salad, Chicken Romano, Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake, Lemon Meringue Cheesecake, or Banana Cream Pie Cheesecake.  Thank goodness for Intermittent Fasting!! One cheesecake is my whole days worth of calories!!!"
Karen S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,33,1,5.0,3/18/2016,"It's all in the name!!!! This is The. Best. Cheesecake. Ever! I bring my family here to have a great time and to share a cheesecake! My relatives recently travelled from Illinois and had never been.... Let me tell you, they thoroughly enjoyed it!!  Friendly service, fun atmosphere and for the icing on the cheesecake... It connects to the mall so we can shop off those extra calories!"
Patricia B.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,335,363,3.0,11/26/2013,"Stopped here for early dinner on the way back home from a trip. I had the Jambalaya and hubby had some chicken that comes with a brown sauce, brown rice and black beans.  Everything was OK, just the brown rice was very plain and my pasta was a little tough...  I like their flavored iced tea, and the bread (molasses bread?)"
Valerie M.,"Chandler, AZ",103,412,2551,4.0,8/1/2014,"I was lured in by the National Cheesecake Day deal of half price cheesecake.  How can you go wrong with a deal? Service at the bar was okay but kinda slow because they had to get the salt for my Margarita and that took longer than it should've.  There were vacant seats at the bar and a couple took a pair of seats to my left and the gentleman waited until I got my drink so he wouldn't crowd me.  Another lady swooped in and was rude, bumping and crowding me unapologetically so she could have the vacant seat I opted to not be sitting in while I got my order. I was very glad to get away from that scene. The hostesses got us a table in just over five minutes and seated us promptly.  There was a lot of activity there on this particular day because everyone realized at the last minute that today was the last day for half price cheesecake.   Our waitress was sweet and kinda adorable too with her positive approach, bringing me water without asking, and helping to select menu options for hubby and myself.  I couldn't decide on dinner and asked for her to give me a recommendation.   I went with a salad, I think it was their version of an Asian salad but truly I just can't remember.  I had asked if there was a salad with strawberries and chicken and what she suggested is the one I had, but she got the kitchen to add strawberries so it was more to my liking.  Excellent. And hubbies pasta was served up as he had requested too.  Very nice. French fries that were supposed to be part of my sons meal were overlooked and didn't make it to the table until he was almost done with his sandwich. And the manager actually stopped by to apologize for the French fry oversight too. Here we were enjoying each others company and the food, discussing the day and such -not at all in a fuss about the overlooked FF, so it was a surprise to have him check in on us. It seems the spicy chicken sandwich he ordered was not what he had hoped for because it didn't have enough spice to really qualify as ""spicy"", but otherwise he said it was good. Now the cheesecakes, omg, there are so many options it's difficult to decide. I went with my first impression and got the Mango and Key Lime.  Not being a fan of Key Lime pie I wasn't so thrilled with that part but thought the Mango might make the Key Lime a nice blend.  Eh, not the case.  I felt I was eating a Key Lime with Mango cheesecake. Still good and after a couple bites with some coffee I decided I should have the rest packed up and it was time to go. Prompt seating even through there was a huge crowd. Really good service, but the times I've been here before I guess this is standard and to be expected. Yummy meal that was ordered up with specific instructions and delivered as such."
Art R.,"Tempe, AZ",4,333,1,3.0,2/14/2017,"Typical corporate sterile environment. Limited corporate mega brewery beer offerings-Sorry Four Peaks is not local anymore. Generous portions for sure but service left a lot to be desired. I think the servers were assigned to too many tables and couldn't keep up. Our water and iced tea glasses were left empty for way to long.  Cheesecake of course was good but for the prices they charge it better be,"
