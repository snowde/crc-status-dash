Farmer 2.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,5.0,8/14/2016,"Sunday at 2:00 pm my wife and I split French country salad and steak Diane, which we often do at this location.  The restaurant was busy but the greeting and the service (Rebecca was our server) was friendly and professional.  Bread came promptly as requested (we requested only dark bread).  Bread was fresh. The French country salad tasted excellent as usual. However, it was supposed to contain grilled asparagus, which was missing.  The steak Diane was delicious with an ample serving and prepared exactly as I ordered it, medium.  The mashed potatoes were real and excellent.  For dessert we order Linda's Chocolate Cake.  Excellent!  Server, Rebecca, made sure we had extra plates for sharing the meal.  Overall an excellent experience."
Christopher S.,"Tempe, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/30/2017,"So I ordered take out 3 different times and every single time they screwed it up. 1st time I got there and only 1/2 my order was ready because they forget to make an entree so I waited in the lobby for thirty minutes until it was ready while my other food sat and got cold. 2nd time they completely forgot to pack one of my entrees and made my other entree completely wrong. 3rd time it was my wife's birthday and we got take out with a piece  of cheesecake as well  of course they forgot to pack the cheesecake even though the guy told me it was in there. I called the manager when I got home and you could tell he could care less as he asked me my name four times yet I told him it numerous times when he first got on the phone. ""Great"" listening skills. Obviously he does not care about his job or the service his employees are providing. I would not recommend ordering take out orders here."
Bryan M.,"Arcadia, CA",604,444,1356,5.0,8/4/2014,"Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in a minute... Flew into Arizona Friday and had dinner here. Well more like i had ""appetizers"" here cause i wasn't too hungry because i ate at the airport before i left. I would have rated this place 4 stars had it have not been for our friendly server Hallie. Nothing like a server that knows what they're doing :) She's a keeper!"
Brigette R.,"Fairfax, VA",112,296,4196,2.0,2/12/2013,"Good service but poor food Chicken teriyaki was pink on inside, they baked bananas instead of using plantains. Plain white rice and too much teriyaki sauce. The only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars is because we sat in a nice outdoor area, next to a water fountain under ceiling heaters."
Gavin A.,"Chandler, AZ",3,11,8,5.0,7/24/2016,Let's just start off service is always great I've been coming to this cheesecake factory since it opened back in 2000's it's always friendly staff and hot food The only thing I'm a little disappointed some time bathroom is dirty and no soap I've let the staff know they been on top of it but  I think they should check their bathroom more often that's the only thing I would say bad about my local Cheesecake Factory
Evie H.,"Tempe, AZ",0,3,,5.0,8/6/2016,"I went into the Cheesecake Factory and was very skeptical. I had never been and had no idea if it was going to be worth while or not. I sat down and had dinner with my husband and was pleasantly surprised. I liked the food but the best part about our experience was our server. Monica was not only extremely knowledgeable about the menu but also attentive and funny!!! My husband and I both laughed, ate and had a great time. I would come back here for her if nothing else! We had a blast."
Marilyn R.,"Gilbert, AZ",30,6,,2.0,2/2/2017,"We had a gift card from Christmas and decided to go on a Saturday. The ""small bites"" appetizer, PORTABELLA, AVOCADO, ZUCCHINI FRIES came out and were so delicious. Here is our complaint. What happened to our server after the food came out?  She was not to be found. We wanted our check, a to go container, and had ordered cheesecake to go at the end of our meal. She forgot about our previously ordered cheesecake and when she finally brought it, we had been waiting 20 min at this point. Not everybody that goes out to eat wants to be there for over 2 hours. The waitress had a lame made up excuse that the dessert counter was backed up. What a lie as we could see it from our table and it was dead. She just waited so long to go over to get it. She never refilled our drinks. The actual cheesecake I ate at home, ""chocolate chip cookie dough"" was tasteless and dry. Maybe I should have given 1 star but I do love the Asian chicken salad and my husband enjoyed his filet mignon. Eating out shouldn't be such a pain. The acoustics are also bad. We were near a screaming, crying toddler who was out clearly too late. This gave me a headache.  We left at about 945 pm and now had missed the movie we had planned to see."
Candy M.,"Chandler, AZ",2,37,1,2.0,11/6/2016,5 of us came to CF for my daughter's bday.  I just have to say I'm so not impressed with this restaurant anymore.  Way overpriced for a absolutely tasteless entree...supposed to be a basil chicken dish with basil pasta.  There was NO basil pasta and a couple of pieces of basil in the garnish.  It was tasteless and lifeless. Then they are so cheap that they can't even give a slice of cheesecake for the bday girl...it was literally a half of a scoop of ice cream and two tablespoons of whipped cream.  We'll definitely pick somewhere that appreciates the business more for our next celebration.
Brett B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3414,423,1422,4.0,7/16/2012,"Still impressed by their avocado egg rolls, and the accompanying dipping sauce (cilantro, honey, lime, garlic, etc) was tap dancing all over my taste buds.  I'd love to have my wife replicate that so we can test out what other foods it would accommodate. What I wasn't impressed with was their herb-crusted salmon salad.  Maybe it was the word 'crusted' that got me, but I was assuming the fish was going to be served warm.  Surprise!  It was cold.  I choked down as much as I could, but will be going to Pita Jungle and Keegan's for my salmon salads from now on. And I cant say enough about their pina colada cake cheesecake.  A true taste of the islands, part cake, part cheesecake, all yummy.  The only things missing were the fire dancers and hula girls. They do take reservations... for parties of 20 or more."
Dan W.,"Gilbert, AZ",19,54,71,5.0,7/11/2014,"Love this place. Friday night dinner rush packed and we barely waited twenty minutes for a table. The host staff was a well oiled machine.  Pot stickers as usual for an app and jen order the Ahi Tuna Roll. Be forewarned its fried so the meat is cooked. It's was ok.  Can't not order my chicken Madeira and luckily enough they have a combo with it so I could also try the Steak Diane. I'm temporarily against trying new food items after a bad bad experience at one of my favorite places to eat when I tried something new. Jen ordered a combo too with the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. Diane was a little so bland for me but I ate some and Jen's cat will be in heaven with the rest. The chicken barely hit the table and it was gone. Yummy!  Jen said hers was good. Her salmon was a little overcooked but that she would get it again because the lemon sauce was really really good.  I am full so it's going to be blueberry cheesecake to go. I want to finish by saying our server was awesome. Timing was perfect for delivery on food and drinks, and thus the five stars. Customer service can make or break a business regardless of the product or cost. Regardless of the business you are in, this is a universal truth. Her name was Natalie P."
Tammy C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/21/2017,"The 50 minute wait was more like 75 minutes. Party of 7 we were told they were waiting for another party to leave that had been there 90 minutes before they could seat us. The food was great. I asked the waitress to pack up my leftover shrimp scampi. 20 minutes later she came back to the table and when we asked where my food was she said she threw it out. She went to speak to the manager and came back and said they were making me a 1/2 portion to take. 20 min later she said they had a lot of tickets and it would be 15 min more. That she would let the manager know.  The manager came over and informed me that the first batch of my food was ""messed up,"" and they were making me another half portion. It would take 2 min. 15 min later my food came out.  Thanks to the manager for not offering some kind of compensation for the $20 meal that was thrown out, and for the 55 minute wait to get a 1/2 portion to take home, and for not keeping me updated on how long this process would take."
Rashmi G.,"Chandler, AZ",549,417,906,3.0,5/11/2014,"We've been to this restaurant a few times and have had pretty good experiences. I've come to learn to not be too adventurous with the menu - they have some really good options & some not too great choices so I'm starting to stick to the meals I know I like. As far as drinks go, the Tropical Martini, Georgia Peach, & Prickly Pear Margarita are a few of my favorites. For the main dishes, I really like the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, Pasta DaVinci, and the Santa Fe Salad. I'd say that this is a restaurant that's somewhat overpriced but the quantities but the quantities are really large. I'd prefer it if you could order their main dishes in half sizes at a lowered price. The Godiva cheesecake, Vanilla Bean cheesecake, & Fresh Banana Cream cheesecake are also worth trying. Keep in mind that if you're going in a large group, they don't do reservations so on a weekend night, expect a long wait!"
Cindy T.,"Chandler, AZ",252,160,55,4.0,4/22/2014,"I like the Cheesecake factory.  It is always good for a substantial, good meal.  Is it phenomenal, no?  Is it bad, no. It's good and for the most part, consistent. We came in around 8 pm on a Tuesday night so needless to say, it was pretty quiet.  There were lots of servers standing around so when it came to get my iced tea refreshed, I was surprised I had to track someone down.  The bartender, who was also our server, was engrossed in a convo with a male customer (perhaps she thought he'd be a better tipper? ;) ) so we were invisible to her.  Too bad too, as she seemed promising. One of my staple dishes I get at the Cheesecake Factory is the Tomato Basil pasta.  It is always an ample serving that I can usually get 2 meals out of.  I also love a good old slice of Original Cheesecake.  Keep it simple and you won't be disappointed."
Christopher E.,"Prescott, AZ",48,19,18,5.0,5/21/2016,"From start to finish,  experience was amazing. Ambience was amazing and staff was always nearby and helpful.  Best Cheesecake Factory to date."
Marco D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",226,150,611,3.0,5/4/2015,"I don't go out of my way to visit The Cheesecake Factory, but my mother wanted to have an early dinner here for her 60th birthday.  We had a group of 13 and when I arrived I tried having them organize a table for us, but the manager said that she wouldn't do so until everyone arrived.  Even thought I explained that everyone was on the way she would not sit the 4 of us that were there early.   Upon sitting down, our waiter was very accommodating.  Brought us all waters and took drink orders.  After browsing the extensive menu items I choose a turkey sandwich from the skinny menu.  Food took a while to come out of the kitchen & my niece waited the longest for some kid sliders.  I was literally done with my turkey sandwich before they brought out her sliders.  Not sure what happened in the kitchen to forget about 2 small sliders.  I'm not a fan of the decor of Cheesecake factory or the sitting arrangement made for a large party.  I felt trapped where they sat us.   After dinner was over we all ordered some cheesecake, because why not?  We opted for the brownie sundae and a slice of cookie dough cheesecake.  No complaints in this department.  Both good options for dessert.  All in all I wouldn't eat here again.  The food is OK and the service is OK.  Some people rave about this place, but for the price of the food I know I can have a better dining experience somewhere else."
Tyler M.,"El Cajon, CA",8,8,1,5.0,9/19/2015,"Just left the location in the Chandler Fashion Center mall and I had to write a review. The food looked and tasted great, and the service was good and quick for a weekend lunch.  I ordered a BBQ burger cooked medium rare with fries and my fiancée ordered a Cuban sandwich. Both were bigger than expected and cooked as ordered.  The menu at Cheesecake Factory is huge and there were lots of entrees I wanted to try. I even scoped out other tables to see how their food looked at it was all awesome!"
Richard B.,"Maricopa, AZ",116,101,14,4.0,8/11/2015,"So this place gets a bad rap for being unhealthy. To be fair, they have a menu that could be mistaken for a small book, and it is filled with unhealthy delicious options. My friends all loved their unhealthy food and I looked longingly at them as I ate my salad. And there is our headline. There is an ENTIRE MENU of healthy options, and I mean seriously healthy. Kale is involved, and when Kale shows up, you know healthy is about to throw down. The options included a lot of sandwiches, which didn't work for my carb-averse diet, so I requested the most obnoxious thing on the planet: a lettuce-wrapped sandwich with a side salad. They served it, and it was what health nuts would describe as ""delicious"". I am working my way there, so as of now I can affirm that it was ""food"". Still, I was impressed with their response to the bad rap, and the many options on their healthy ""Skinnylicious"" menu. You can have very green meals here."
JJ Q.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,11,2,1.0,2/20/2016,"Wow--management here needs a run on ""Hell's Kitchen"". We decided to eat here because we had things to do at the mall, and will NEVER return. I've been to the Scottsdale Cheesecake Factory several times, but this was a horrible experience. From meals not coming out simultaneously (how difficult is it to have two meals arrive together?), to orders being wrong, to being told the manager WASN'T interested in helping us with our complaints until we pushed it--just ridiculously bad customer service and a bad dining experience. We were so miffed we didn't even want to stay for the piece of cheesecake that we came in for!"
Christina S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,4.0,12/29/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory and our server Brittany was the best! We had the Cuban rolls which were amazing! If you want good food and great service come to this location.
Britty C.,"Tempe, AZ",1,12,2,1.0,8/20/2016,"I hate that I am writing a horrible review about Cheesecake Factory as it is one of my favorite restaurants. I have worked in the food and beverage industry for about ten years so I like to think I am very reasonable when it comes to my expectations as well as being understanding that things will- and do go wrong daily in this business. My last experience at The Cheesecake Factory was unacceptable. I have never felt the need to write a bad review after a bad experience but I feel compelled to address this particular situation in hopes that it will never happen to myself or any other customer again. My boyfriend and I frequent this restaurant as it is one of our favorite places to dine and while out for my birthday a couple weekends ago a series of unfortunate events occurred making it hard to want to ever come back. From the beginning our server seemed like he was in the weeds and struggling to keep up, I could tell because another server asked if he needed help and he was frantic while talking to us and the tables around. Like I mentioned before I have worked in this industry and have served many years so this particular part didn't bother me as much, but maybe he should have more training or an easier section on a Saturday night for the sake of the customers. Where it starts to get messy is after we ordered. I had ordered the four cheese pasta and my boyfriend had ordered the Filet Mignon. I am not sure if things were sent to the kitchen at different times or if there was a mistake in the kitchen because my pasta had been delivered to the table a minimum of 20 minutes before the steak got to the table. I had completely finished my meal (with some help from my boyfriend since he was starving) and was done before a steak came to the table. While very understanding that things happen in restaurants I am baffled by the fact that nobody communicated with us on what had happened. Our server was blatantly ignoring us, avoiding eye contact and didn't explain anything. The whole time this was happening our drinks were empty, never being filled. Finally he came to the table and when my boyfriend had mentioned it was unacceptable all he said was that he was going to send someone over to talk to us, still no explanation on what had happened. A steak finally arrived at our table and he started eating when another worker approached us and said he had received the wrong steak. Not really a problem because it was switched out fairly quick, but still another mistake made by our server. My boyfriend had finished majority of his steak dinner and was done eating so we flagged our waiter and asked for a check. Still a manager hadn't come over to our table and we were completely done eating. At the time we asked for our check I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. Finally a manager came to the table and said he heard there was a timing issue. While I hate creating a scene and ruin other peoples dining experience I didn't say much other then I had been completely done eating before his  food came out. The manager asked if we were getting dessert and I mentioned I had already placed the order. Still we had no explanation of what happened and the managers visit was very short. We were STILL waiting on our check and I could tell that the communication between the manager and our server was very poor. Our server came back still with no check and asked if we wanted the cheesecake to go or for here. I had ordered the cheesecake to go long before the manager came over so I was confused as to why he came back to ask that and it was clear he still hadn't sent the order through. So on top of waiting a unreasonable amount of time on food we spent an even more amount of time just trying to get our check and cheesecake to go and leave the restaurant. In the future I hope the employees at this location communicate appropriately with each other and the guests to avoid situations like these."
