TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,2.0,6/9/2015,"Where to start...The Cheesecake Factory is like an old stand by with decent food & decent service. I visit this restaurant about 4 times a year. This past visit was probably one of the worst. Ok, maybe it was the worst. I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. $16.95. This is one of my favs but this time the chicken was a bit over cooked. I'm not a fan of dry chicken. The rest of the dish was ok. K ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. $17.95. She had to ask for additional sauce because it came out with very little sauce. At least they didn't charge us for it. The sauce was good. The rice was a bit on the undercooked side. The chicken was fine. C ordered the Buffalo Strips $9.99. $10.99 with fries. This is a great deal. 8 large breaded chicken tenders for $9.99. An extra buck for fries. Heck of a deal. Grandma C ordered the Carolina BBQ sandwich. $12.95. She didn't eat it because it was chunked pork, not pulled. Now the bad stuff; First off, charging $4.50 for a Strawberry lemonade for my son is RIDICULOUS. Second, I think $7.50, $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake is too much. Especially when the whole cheesecake is around $50. And lastly, the Carolina BBQ sandwich is described as being made with pulled pork. It is not. It is made with pork chunks. Not very good for a sandwich. We told the manager we were not pleased with the sandwich but in the middle of our debate on the merits of pulled pork vs pork chunks the fire alarm went off. FOR 10+ MINUTES. (We learned from a server that the key needed to turn off the alarm was taken home by one of the new managers. So the fire dept was on it's way to turn off the alarm) I think a good portion of the guests left after a few minutes because the ear piercing blaring noise of the fire alarm was a bit much to take. We stayed. I was hoping to finish our conversation with the manager but he never returned. We also had hoped that the pork sandwich would be taken off the bill. It wasn't. And we hoped that the Mgr would buy a slice of cheesecake to make up for the sandwich. He didn't. We sat through that blaring alarm for nothing except for an ""I can't believe you stayed"" from our server. You know what? I can't believe we stayed either. I did find it interesting when the server mentioned about the Mgr taking the key home she told us they had 4 new managers. Hmmm. Wonder Y. Management & food; 2 stars."
Rachael A.,"Mesa, AZ",24,43,307,5.0,8/5/2014,"Stellar service! Went in for National Cheesecake Day for 1/2 price cheesecake and they did not disappoint! We went in late to avoid the crowds though it did a little while still to get our cheesecakes since many ppl were still seated, I'm sure getting their desserts. But once they arrived at our table all was forgotten. These cheesecakes have the most delectable flavors. I couldn't care less what their calorie content is. Everything in moderation and this is the perfect place to splurge!  The flavors of every single piece was ABSOLUTELY perfect! I'm not much of a S'mores fan but these flavors blended so well from the sweet light crunchiness of the graham cracker crust to the delicious light airy Hershey's chocolate cheesecake to the rich chocolate ganache topping and toasted housemade marshmallow. Kahlua is my usual choice for cheesecake and was spectacular as usual. My son ordered Hershey's Chocolate Bar and it too was delicious and he even had leftovers for me to enjoy the next day! Love love LOVE!"
Minh L.,"Chandler, AZ",41,63,68,4.0,3/1/2015,"So, this place is pretty good. I like it. The free bread and good service. I ordered the seared salmon salad. It was really good. Fortunately and unfortunately, the portion was sooooooo biiiiiig! I could not enjoy a cheese cake here. Maybe next time. Overall, I like this place and I'd come back."
Sheetal P.,"Mesa, AZ",0,5,,1.0,12/25/2015,"I was very fond of this place until last night! I ordered a cosmo and to my horror I found a really big piece of glass in my drink. How did they handle this? The manager comes along and apologizes for his mistake, informs us that he will return to get some personal information incase something goes wrong and needs medical attention. Never stops by! Thanks to my server for being honest and confirming it was a glass piece. At least she was honest enough. Another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes-there were broken glass pieces on the floor- one of the servers kicks them like he was playing soccer in his own field.  Smiles and walks by! Really?? Were they going to wait for the worst to happen!  How does the management handle both these situations apart from bringing this to their attention? They don't!! Just ignored it!! Had I cut my mouth or my tongue- they would have taken actions? What if I had consumed small glass pieces in my drink? Is the solution to these incidents to ignore them and console us by paying our bill? No. I'm really disappointed with them. And will always think twice before walking in there."
Angela C.,"Chandler, AZ",28,23,3,1.0,2/20/2016,"Don't think I can eat here again.  The floor was so coated with grease that it was slippery.  My silverware was dirty, my salad bowl was dirty and the woman next to me had to send her cheesecake back because her plate was dirty.  Food was ok but I was completely grossed out."
Rick H.,"Sumter, SC",0,51,40,4.0,7/4/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory which is a good thing bc I've been to many from this location to Los Angeles, TX, GA, VA, FL and they are consistently the same.  Portions are ginormous.  Wife got the meatloaf which had 3 slices easily weighing over 1lb so 2 slices went in the doggie bag for...the dogs!   I got the fish tacos which were ehh, if you've had them in SoCal none can compare.  We also got the blueberry cheese cake to go and that was pretty good also.  Why 3 stars?   Nothing wrong with our experience but nothing great.  If you've been to one and want to go back it's a sure bet, it's a chain restaurant with no true authenticity, but a menu the same length of a Harry Potter novel so everyone can be pleased for their meal."
David T.,"Epsom, United Kingdom",0,16,,2.0,6/1/2016,"Not sure if it's just us but the place has an odd smell that my wife can't stand so sat outside.  Food was OK (Scottsdale CF much better) service was good, greeter could have been a bit more friendly - didn't feel very welcome especially when we asked to sit outside"
Jason L. J. V.,"Tempe, AZ",130,1,,2.0,2/20/2016,"While my server was excellent, the hostess was curt and somewhat rude. She also sat us in the half booth section in the center of the restaurant despite it being late with other seats available. This seat was particularly obnoxious as we were right next to the server order station and numerous servers ""hung out"" there to chat with each other and put in orders. Since there is no boundary between the server station and the seat, it's like a group standing over you and looking at you from your left side, squelching any chance at a private conversation with your dining companion. I probably won't come to this location again. I don't remember this same set up at the phoenix location. If it is the same hopefully they at least have a plant or something to break the line of sight from the server station down into the half booth."
Ashlie H.,"Mesa, AZ",704,289,239,2.0,11/23/2015,"Hit and miss at this place decent food, bad service. We were seated in the bar area on a Tuesday evening, the dining room had a lot of available seating, but they sat us at those little tiny tables where you have to basically sit on top of one another and cant have a private conversation. That wasn't any fun. From there our waiter was very busy, running around like a chicken with his head cut off. We had 3 different waiters come and try to help us, it got really confusing and a bit frustrating. After 30 mins we finally got our drinks and our order in. The food was decent, but with all the waiting we ate really quick so we could get out of there and get home. My sister and I agreed it would be easier to just order our cheese cake at the to-go counter instead of ordering it through our waiter. Paid the bill after another 15 minutes of waiting got our cheese cake and got the heck out of there. It shouldn't take you almost 3 hours to eat on a Tuesday night :("
Wendy R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,9,2,1.0,2/20/2016,Horrible experience never again are we dining at this location. Got orders all wrong . Wait time was horrible we didn't mind since we knew this was a popular place . Regardless the wait time service was just horrible . Never again
John B.,"Chandler, AZ",0,14,,1.0,5/1/2016,"I've gone to different locations and always order the Parmesan herb-crusted chicken entree, which has flavor, much unlike the most bland dish that they served me tonight. After placing an order for takeout, another member of my party picked up the food for us. Instead of getting the Parmesan herb-crusted chicken, they gave me their Crusted Chicken Romano, which is a great dish for a child. Because there is virtually no flavor.  But before being stuck with this meal, I was angry enough at having my meal messed up, so I went to the Cheesecake Factory with my dish and tried to exchange it for my actual order and they refused. So I went home to eat the most bland and awful item on their menu.  Thanks for nothing."
Priyanka R.,"Tempe, AZ",114,33,17,1.0,2/16/2015,I ordered ligurian pesto pasta.. The pasta was overly uncooked.. And quantity was less compared to what I had 2 weeks before.. The server said they had changed the pasta.. Did not like the pasta at all.. I had enjoyed it last time though
Zak W.,"Flagstaff, AZ",3,36,9,5.0,6/17/2015,"Have eaten at the chain in California, which is where I'm from. For whatever reason this one was far better. Left feeling full and satisfied with my meal. Food tasted great, my Steak Diane was medium rare and not overcooked (as per my usual experience at the one back home). Good experience overall. Server was very friendly and helpful."
Jessica K.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",101,404,50,3.0,1/26/2014,"I go back and forth with Cheesecake Factory. It's a love/hate relationship. My brother wanted to come here for his birthday, so we came. I usually get the deep fried mac n cheese balls (an app but I get it as an entree), but I saw they had it on a burger so I went with that instead. It was OK, but I would have rather gone to Red Robin. The caesar I got was disgusting. No flavor whatsoever. My  husband got the club which is HUGE and my brother got the three cheese pasta - they both liked their meals.  You have to try the deep fried mac n cheese balls - they are what keep me coming back. The strawberry lemonade is delicious, but SO sweet. In fact I had just the regular lemonade this time and it was super sweet too. Pretty quick service and we were seated in less than 15 minutes even on Friday night. Their Sunday brunch is delicious - lots of yummy options and you won't leave hungry!"
Jr A.,"Tempe, AZ",16,53,4,4.0,5/2/2014,"As soon as you walk in you're greeted with friendly staff. The whole interior is beautiful. You're quickly asked if you want to sit inside or sit out on the patio.  If you're a patio person, come during the evening. The whole ambiance just seems to be romantic, that is if you're out on a date.  As soon as we sat down, our waitress came and introduced herself. It was a little difficult to hear her with all the Music and people there so maybe they should alert their staff members to speak up.  Our order was quickly taken along. If you don't know what type of food you want, come here. They have so many food choices to pick from for instance, Mexican, Italian, American etc. I went ahead with angel hair pasta with shrimp which in fact satisfied my appetite.  After dinner, you're going to be asked if you want dessert. I didn't know what kind of cheese cake to try so I asked our server what new comers normally try and are pleased with. She suggested I try the red velvet cheesecake so I went ahead and ordered that. It was probably one of the best cheesecakes I've had in a while. A little on the sweet side but I scraped majority of the frosting off.  Looking forward to coming back to another Cheesecake Factory, I might even come back to this specific location.  Great environment, friendly staff, and tasteful food.  (I'm giving four stars because our server was really nice until we left. It felt as if she was being nice to us up until we signed for the bill. I had just gotten off work but I don't think I looked like someone who wouldn't tip... Might I add, the rush server basically threw my plate on the table.)"
Kristi B.,"Tempe, AZ",11,44,4,1.0,8/2/2016,"We finally had the chance to go out last night and decided to come to Cheesecake Factory, as it is one of our favorite restaurants.  We decided to go to the bar area to sit because we wanted to get some happy hour drinks and apps along with our dinner.  ALL of the tables were dirty.  The one that we sat at that was set was even dirty.  I used one of the napkins to wipe the table off myself.  The waiter came and took our drink and appetizer order.  He brought us our drinks and then we never saw him again.  I had asked him for a straw which he never brought.  We tried grabbing his attention several times and he just ignored us.  Another person came to bring us our food, and we asked her for a straw and she immediately brought us one.  We were done eating and just decided we wanted to go because the service was so horrible.  No one came to check up on us to see if our food was okay, or if we needed anything.  Other customers were complaining by us as well, which made things even worse.  We happened to snag who we thought was a manager and asked for our check.  We said we had tried getting our servers attention several times, but he wasn't apologetic at all.  About 10 minutes later the waiter finally just laid the check on the table and walked away. Didn't say anything to us.  It just makes me upset when I see servers just sitting in the back areas goofing off with each other and ignoring their customers.  It really ruined our very rare dinner that we had together and we are going to think twice next time we go out to eat.  We have always loved going to cheesecake factory, but after this visit, it seems like things are going downhill for the restaurant and it's very sad.  I wish that I could have tipped the girl who brought our food out because she did more than anyone else in this restaurant did.  Our dining experience shouldn't have taken almost 2 hours, especially with no service or drink refills."
Doreen L.,"Tucson, AZ",23,259,74,5.0,8/19/2013,"I don't know what some people are looking for but ... We were here on a Monday at lunch and the service was top notch, the food was to die for and the decor was out of this world! We shared the skinny Turkey and Avocado sandwich which came with a wonderful mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was fab. This is the second location I've been to. The first time was in Raleigh, NC and great food and service there too! Some people just need to chill and not be so demanding."
Maegan J.,"Chandler, AZ",142,9,5,5.0,4/10/2016,"I always order the same thing every time I Coke here. The mushroom burger. I should really try something new, but why when it's just too good?! I love this place. Very roomy and the serves are great. The best time to come to The Cheesecake Factory is Sunday around 10. The wait isn't long and you are always guaranteed fresh food!"
Kaylee L.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,3.0,10/21/2016,a bowl of strawberries is $8.  eight dollars.  i could pick those outta the ground for free edit: it switched out my caps.  just know my review was in caps
Mitchell B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,11/4/2016,I got orange chicken and found a long hair and the cheese cake was so sugary if I ate it all I would have got diabetes.. No joke
