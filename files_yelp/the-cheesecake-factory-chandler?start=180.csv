Cassandra H.,"Chandler, AZ",2,21,8,5.0,6/15/2015,"I am always pleased with my food, waiter, server, greeters, everything. Cleanliness of a 10/10. It may just be this location but they seriously won't let you down"
Kat S.,"Mesa, AZ",6,3,,1.0,12/7/2014,"I've been here once, and I was expecting this place to wow me. It didn't live up to it's reputation of being so dazzling. I waited about 10 minutes in line and when we finally got seated the waiter took 30 minutes to ask for our order. I ordered a steak (well done) with a side of French fries. That took another 30 minutes to arrive and my steak was very raw. I didn't bother asking anyone to do it again because no one was around and I didn't want to wait any longer. Though the steak was bad the french fries were alright. Funny thing is, they only took about 5 minutes to give us the check.  Service is mediocre. Food is a downer."
Suzen T.,"San Diego, CA",169,66,481,2.0,7/19/2014,"I've been here many times for dinner. Must be just my luck but service is not great.  I came here on Thursday to order a full cake for pick on Saturday. The young lady who helped me Thursday was great! Today tho, I came in and they were giving me trouble on picking up my cake. I had my pickup slip and paid for it in advance. It took them almost an hour to finally ""find"" the cake. They should have had it ready to be picked up in the front fridge. Next time have someone who knows what they're doing when dealing with customers.  Not happy."
Belle C.,"Phoenix, AZ",347,77,728,3.0,8/18/2015,"The stars are for their good service. I came here with the party of about 15 a few nights ago and was thoroughly impressed with how accommodating they were to our needs. They were quick to seat us, bring us waters and provide us with bread while we waited for the entire party to arrive. They checked back frequently for all of us to arrive and was ready and waiting to take our order when we were all present. Also, they had no problem initially separating our checks during ordering so we wouldn't have to worry about splitting the check later on. Which was GREATLY appreciated and made checking out that much easier. Now, everyone knows how overwhelming Cheesecake's book of a menu is. I didn't mind waiting for our late friends because it takes that long to decide what to order. They also have a separate ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" menu that I've never seen before! This is news to me. We are usually pretty healthy eaters but this particular night was a ""cheat"" day for us. We ordered off the regular menu: fried avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom starter and the avocado egg roll appetizer. They were both great. In attempt to be somewhat healthy, I ordered the almond crusted salmon kale salad on the regular menu and this dish is not good at all. I gave it a chance and took a few bites hoping that the salmon flavor would kick in or the dressing would save it but I didn't taste anything. It was very bland. I had to ask the waiter to take it back because I didn't even want to take it home. I hate doing that and wasting food but I had to and he was so nice to take it off our bill. Thank you so much, I really appreciated it. Thank goodness my fiancé ordered the salmon and steak plate because it was enough for both of us to share and the flavor profile of this dish was wonderful. The steak flavor reminded me of adobo and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I had no more room for dessert which was a bummer because I love almost every dessert I've ever tried here. But I did have the privilege of trying my friends lemon cake/strawberry cheesecake and it was SO GOOD. I will need to get it the next time I go in. I also like that Cheesecake Factory is one of the few restaurants who stays open late. I'm not big on chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is always a viable option in my book."
Caitlin H.,"Flagstaff, AZ",60,66,16,1.0,7/16/2015,"Terrible, horrible, no good, very bad service. I ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go at the counter and it took 35 minutes for them to ring up the order so I could leave and be on my merry way. It wasn't like there was a problem with the register, no it was the complete lack of attention from the staff. For 7.50 a slice of cheesecake you would think they would be more attentive! Will not be back. Too expensive and obviously they do not care about a customer."
Mike F.,"Chandler, AZ",12,901,1,2.0,4/15/2013,"It is what it is.  Overpriced, underwhelming food.  The burgers are ok.  The cheesecake is whipped (i.e., not good).   I can't believe I spent $70 here.  It makes me die a little to write that.  Never again."
Kitty Kat D.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,46,3,2.0,5/28/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is my go-to when I've a rough day or just don't feel like cooking. The portions are huge, and the service is *usually* decent. We went last night (Tuesday) after a rough day, neither my husband or I felt like cooking. Figuring this was our best option since it would have something for everyone, we went late hoping we'd miss any crowds. But its a Tuesday night in late May, why on earth where there be a wait? Sure enough, we got there and it was a 5 minute wait. No big deal, even though we waited more like 10-15 minutes...and that is no fun with a hungry 4 year old, when its after 8pm. Probably our mistake as parents thinking we would get a quick meal, and be in and out.  We were seated and it took another 10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. Our waiter did apologize for the wait but it was a very half-assed apology. Either be sincere or don't bother mentioning it. We also ordered our food since we had time to look over the menu. Drinks were slow getting out, another 10 minutes. Food was also slow getting out. We were probably here 40 minutes before we got our food. It was busy, but not that busy.  Our waiter was nice but did not ask me once if I needed a refill on my drink, my glass was clearly empty. He did offer my husband another beer though and promptly brought that out.  The service here just sucked, and its gotten worse every time we've come. I know losing us as customers won't make or break you, but we really are done with this location. If you must go to Cheesecake, opt for the Biltmore location!"
Addison G.,"Tempe, AZ",22,91,4,5.0,8/21/2015,"I have only been to one other Cheesecake Factory. And it was for my senior prom in LA, so it's not too memorable. This was our first time at this location, and we LOVED it!!!! We went for lunch, and were seated straight away. We loved everything from the food to the service! Our waiter, Tom, was awesome! Super cool, chill dude. I love when waiters are just themselves around you, no weird vibes like they're trying to play it cool or be fancy. So ask for Tom! For the food, I have Celiacs, so I had to get GF. But man that was probably the best tasting gluten free meal I think I've ever had at a restaurant! We got the farfalle with roasted garlic, I think? And it was just amazing! You couldn't even tell it was GF! I can't express how AMAZING that was. And Tom even said that most of their pasta dishes (and burgers) can be made gluten free. Uh major bonus! And of course I got the chocolate Godiva cheesecake (cause it's the only GF option). But man it was wonderful! Very rich though, so you gotta love that intense chocolate taste! I just wish it were closer, as I live in North Tempe.  But I will most certainly be coming back!!!"
Michelle M.,"Chandler, AZ",68,21,5,2.0,9/30/2015,"Usually love this place, today just meh... calamari is from a different vendor and nothing special, my fried mac and cheese is burnt and my service is mediocre... makes me sad!"
Traci V.,"Gilbert, AZ",21,7,5,2.0,7/14/2016,"I went here on my lunch break today and ordered a salad to go. The girl at the dessert counter took my order and told me that it would be a 15-20 minute wait, and that I could sit on the bench by the door and she would bring my food out when it was ready.  About 15 minutes later, I noticed her place a bag on the counter. Five minutes later, she put another order up on the counter. Since nobody said anything, I figured they weren't mine. After waiting about 15 more minutes, I went up to the counter and asked if my food was ready yet. She said, ""oh yeah. Here's your salad"". It was the first order that had come out 15 minutes earlier, but nobody mentioned it to me. The food was good, but the service was lacking."
Michele L.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,4,,1.0,1/19/2017,"Horrible experience- when you get seated two tables away facing the kitchen you get to see as meals come out from the kitchen. Watched as my shrimp gf pasta sat under the lights. Waitress came and refilled drinks- food still sat-waitress cleaned up bread/butter from table- meal still sat. Watched other wait staff slide dish to side time and time again. Waitress brings out one of three of our orders and my dish still sat halfway under light. Watched as they finally brought it out- cold shrimp- gf pasta was cold and had sat so long if absorbed all sauce. Called back waitress - she didn't even bother to look surprised- she knew- shame on waitress for even serving. My husbands fish tacos apparently sat next to mine as his came out cold too.  Ordered salad to replace the dish thinking it would be faster- arrived when others were done with their meals. Kitchen staff cant get meals out at same time, Food was lousy, over priced for quality and service was beyond poor. Cant believe my husband even tipped. This was the first time back in about six months as the food was mediocre then- figured we would give it another chance- don't waste your time and money."
Shelby L.,"Flagstaff, AZ",55,146,6,5.0,10/24/2015,I feel like Cheesecake Factory is always a good choice. My boyfriend & I came here after shopping one night.. SUCH A GOOD CHOICE. I got the Jamaican Shrimp & he got the Jambalaya. Both were so delicious. The bread was delish as were the meals & drinks. I only wish you could get refills in meals. So good & recommended. Our server was great & the service great.
Kenny S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,125,4,3.0,11/9/2014,"Just had their mushroom burger last night (11/07/14) and it was outstanding. At 12.50 its not cheap but its large, super tastey and worth every cent. As for the factory in general...... The place can be a literal zoo on fri and sat nights at 6 pm . A mass of humanity . Plan accordingly or prepare for the dinner apocalypse!"
Annette S.,"Laughlin, NV",13,36,38,1.0,5/17/2015,"We went for a birthday celebration. The wait wasn't too long, about 15 minutes on a Sunday night. We ordered 5 different meals, and not one of them was worth the money or the visit. Pasta was hard and dry on one meal, the chicken was almost nonexistent on the salad with chicken, the burger was overdone, the catfish was ok but not very plentiful. The catfish actually looked like fried chicken. The children's pizza was probably the best thing ordered. Service was spotty. I don't know if our server  was overloaded with tables or what.  The complimentary birthday sundae was good. Overall, none of us were impressed with the food or service and don't plan to return."
Kate P.,"Bellingham, WA",3,66,17,2.0,5/13/2016,"Okay, I love the cheesecake factory. This review isn't about that. This is based on my incredibly disappointing dining experience. I ordered the peppered shrimp and plantains and I was really excited because it had plantains and I love plantains. But when it came-- late I may add-- there were no plantains. Finally I flagged down the waiter and asked where the plantains were. He said they were ""backed up"" and he would bring them second. So, I waited. And waited. And waited. Twenty something minutes later, my plantains came. Everyone else had already eaten. My food was then cold.  I know it wasn't my waiter's fault, but my food did not come out as it was supposed to. And when I asked to have it comped, he acted like I was being ridiculous. He made a face at me and all but refused to send a manager over. If you don't love plantains like I do, it might be hard for you to understand, but basically I paid 20$ for shrimp and plantain curry and got only shrimp. To me, it was not unlike ordering nachos and having them come without the cheese. Or ordering a salad and having it come without the dressing. Not acceptable."
Carol K.,"Kihei, HI",66,265,71,4.0,4/27/2012,"The food here is consistently good. We tend to come here annually at Christmastime while shopping at the mall. Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots.  My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner. Yet another chain with multiple locations in the valley."
Michael P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,27,,2.0,10/9/2015,"2 stars only because I enjoyed the cheesecake,  waitress was rude to us. Our food was so bland. Just a huge bowl of noodles no flavor.  I will never come back for dinner I however may consider cheesecake"
Marshall R.,"Chandler, AZ",1,66,37,2.0,6/13/2015,What a disappointing trip to the cheesecake factory I have always been so satisfied with the meals here however on this occasion it was pretty pathetic.  The server seems to not care much about his job and just got done with a busy lunch he had no suggestions for us and could not keep our water full. We never saw the manager walking around to tell them how we felt about this experience.  In the future I will go to the superstition Springs location instead.
Sarah J.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,1,,2.0,10/25/2015,"The food was good as usual, as was the service. I was only able to eat half of my hamburger and most of the small side salad. The tiny bit of salad was placed in a box to take home, but not my hamburger, this was discovered when we got home. For some reason our waiter decided not to box up my burger. After paying as much as we did, I'm pretty upset that they would do this. I don't think we'll be visiting this location anymore."
Hannah B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,9,,5.0,10/15/2015,"I had the greatest server I could have possibly asked for tonight!!! Great food and great service. If you ever get a chance, go in and ask for Caitlyn! We sat there for almost 2 hours and she was very sweet and outgoing. Definitely going back just for her."
