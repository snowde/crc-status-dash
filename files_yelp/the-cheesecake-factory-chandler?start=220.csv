Matt F.,"Murrieta, CA",19,15,1,1.0,3/17/2015,Asked for stuffed chicken tortillas done crispy the server asks well done and I said yes the girl who brought it out said the plate was hot but they were like room temperature and soggy as could be so I got up and left like a gangsta cause I saw waiting and I'm not gonna take a chance on getting it redone.
Cate S.,"Chandler, AZ",10,31,2,3.0,11/15/2014,"Meh! Server was great, but not my scene. Too dark to read the menu, the menu looked like a novel there were so many pages, and everything was overpriced for the quality. It was ok at best, but you can find much better food in the area."
Anna Kaira M.,"Chandler, AZ",117,101,499,5.0,7/8/2013,"Though serving bazillions of unwanted calories, I'm still a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, Chandler. I ALWAYS have good service, good food presentation, and good timing whenever I come here to eat. I've been trying to lose weight so I've been hesitant to eat out, but thank God they have their skinnylicous menu. And it's not just a couple of entrees, it's a full menu from appetizer to full entrees of lesser calories. They have low cal cheesecakes as well. But my all time fave is their Pineapple upside down cheesecake and Linda's Fudge Cake. I have tried numerous entrees here, the Carbonara is a must. The burgers here are huge and flavorful - my fave is the bbq burger, gotta love those onion rings!! Great service, great food, out of this world cheesecakes. Thumbs up!"
Mike C.,"El Paso, TX",9,399,118,4.0,12/28/2013,"I went with a large group of people on a Friday night.  They don't take reservations, so it took us about an hour to be seated.  Service was prompt, but the waitress had so many tables it took about 45 minutes for the food to come after ordering.  Some of us wanted desert, so that took an extra 45 minutes.  The place is packed with lines coming out the door most of the time.  Personally, I think the food is good, but not good enough to wait for.  I also think prices are pretty high.  Two alcoholic beverages, a main course, and a desert is about 50 bucks a person."
Christine P.,"Mesa, AZ",344,448,25,4.0,12/29/2012,"I really love the Cheesecake Factory. I know the menu is huge but that means I never go to the same restaurant twice! My favorite is the grilled eggplant sandwich. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also always a perfect choice. As for dessert...the tiramisu is fabulous. The only reason they are not getting five stars from me is that at this location, I have had crappy service twice. Indifferent servers who really seem to think they have something better they could be doing. The food though, always great. This is probably my favorite chain restaurant. The ice green tea they added to the menu about a year ago is so refreshing on a hot summer day and the best part...free refills! Love the green tea."
Alissa G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",15,41,4,4.0,1/16/2013,"I really enjoy and have always enjoyed the cheesecake factory. They have never gotten it wrong with the vast menu and so many different dishes to choose from.  I really try to only eat here every now and then especially since so many of the menu items are so full of calories and sodium. Have always had great service and friendly, knowledgeable staff."
Jeff W.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,22,,4.0,10/12/2014,"We went Saturday night 10/11/14, at 7:30pm. Hostess estimated our wait at 10-15 mins. After 25, I asked where they were at with calling us and the hostess stated we were 2nd to be called. We waited in view as approximately 6 other parties were seated. At approximately 50 mins after first putting our name in we complained to the male manager (white male 50s) and he immediately sat us. He offered to immediately put in a couple appetizers while we were looking over the menu and got those out ASAP. He brought them out personally saying they had a cook standing by to quickly turn around our orders and those did come out quickly. The food was good as usual, nothing crazy, but still nice. Our waitress was also on top of things. They comped the appetizers. We appreciate the manager writing the wrong and his sincerity."
Alexandria D.,"Chandler, AZ",64,99,38,4.0,1/7/2016,"Well let's start off by saying I love cheesecake, I mean who doesn't!? We come here every hear and there & will remain too, it's a nice restaurant. Tonight was super busy which was weird since it's a Thursday, but great for them! When we were seated we waited close to 10 minutes before our waiter came over (which was fine they have a HUGE menu). When she did I had to wait for my lemonade for another 10, and we also ordered one cocktail and that took about another 10. We got the chicken Caesar as well as the bacon bacon cheeseburger & they were both delicious and came out in enough time and delicious! I did have to wait another 5ish (give or take) for mine after he got his though, which if any has to wait I'm a firm believer in women first. We also ordered two cheesecakes to go which I'm about to eat and so excited! For what we got it was a little bit more than we would've liked, but hey you can't win. Probably go back in another year or so like normal!"
Michele K.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,107,36,4.0,1/13/2015,"Stopped in for dessert, Lemon Raspberry Creme Cheesecake....my tummy loves the Lemon!"
Julie W.,"Tucson, AZ",2,46,4,1.0,11/3/2015,"Let me start by saying that I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times before and, unfortunately, I've noticed a decline in quality over the years.  My most recent experience at the Chandler location hit rock bottom.  I was here with two friends and everything just seemed to go wrong.  No joke, at some point during the meal all three of us had to send our meals back to the kitchen (something that none of us had ever done before).  One friend received her meal about ten minutes before the rest of us (she didn't want to be the only person eating so her meal got cold).  When my other friend got her tacos, they included an ingredient that she specifically asked to be omitted for allergy reasons.  The highlight of the evening was what I found in my chicken Madeira .  What I thought was a burnt mushroom, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a piece of CARDBOARD!  Bizarre, right?!?  On a positive note, the food itself (when we finally got it ~14 minutes later) was tasty and the waitstaff was very apologetic.  For our troubles, we were comped the dinner, but I'm not sure that'll be enough to make me revist the Cheesecake Factory any time soon."
Joe M.,"San Diego, CA",2,45,,2.0,7/16/2015,"Went to this Cheesecake Factory on a date, and the server was very polite, although a little unkempt. I took issue with a crab dish the server recommended, it was so bland, you couldn't taste anything other than the bread shell it was enclosed in. When you added the dip to it, it made it even worse. I mentioned it to the server, who then replaced it with a crab dish which came burned to a crisp. Charcoal black, you couldn't even taste the crab. Then came dessert. I can't eat bread, so I asked the server to recommend a cheesecake which might have a little less of it. He brought a lemon raspberry cheesecake, which looked delicious, but had bread underneath the cheesecake, which again, I cannot digest. There was so little raspberry sauce, they should have just called it lemon cheesecake. I mentioned it to the server, who agreed with me, stating that wasn't the portion it should come with. I asked for more of the sauce, he disappeared, then came back and told me I'd be charged extra for it. I complained to the manager, who then told me I'd get a gift certificate for the amount of the check. Over a month has passed, and guess what, no gift certificate! I called about it to complain, and haven't gotten a call back yet. Although I will return to Cheesecake Factory again, I will never return to this particular one, or recommend it to anyone who asks."
Paul L.,"Chandler, AZ",0,34,59,1.0,11/26/2014,They forgot my daughter's Mac & Cheese. Food was typical: ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Server never really followed up on drink refills and food orders.
Sherry B.,"Tempe, AZ",12,4,,1.0,1/18/2015,"Where to start? Went in after a movie date with my husband. We have been doing Cheesecake Factory for years and never been disappointed until tonight. He order steak Diane, I ordered chicken kaske after an extremely long wait (they were not at all busy) the manager came out to apologies. A longer wait later and the food arrived, COLD, cooked oversee instead of medium and my chicken was DRY.  We did not eat, got a 25.00 bill for our artichoke dip and strawberry martini, left hungry with a piece of free cheesecake..."
Brandon F.,"Milford, CT",0,32,42,3.0,2/22/2015,Excellent cheese cake . Food is a bit overpriced in my opinion. Around 14$ for a salad and other lunch entrees is a bit aggressive . The drinks are good though and hey make a pretty solid Long Island . The avocado egg rolls are pretty good as well.
The Rue D.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",21,89,14,3.0,8/6/2012,"From Under Cheese Factory By The Rue Thursday lunch was the Cheesecake Factory, Ordered an iced tea but not a daquiri, Chicken chipotle pasta was satisfactory, The bread and butter were complimentary. The hostess was hot like they always are, She led us to a table that wasn't very far, When I go golfing I shoot way over par, You cannot pay your tab with an Iraqi Dinar. My friend ordered some asian salad, Crispy and fresh the taste was valid, This review is reading like a rock ballad, There aren't many words that rhymn with salad. I would have given them 4 stars, just one thing, Even the lunch menu thinks you have bling bling, $11.95 for a bowl of pasta like I'm a king, On the weekends you and your wife like to swing.  The service was great, waitress was aware, I look like a hobo, she avoided my stare, I usually go commando, undies I don't wear, This place was good, and the food was fair.  Brownies!!"
John Y.,"Mesa, AZ",67,50,8,2.0,6/26/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory in Chandler is one of those restaurants you want to take your family members such as your visiting aunt and uncle from Korea. It would also be a nice place to take your international friends from China or Mexico. That's because the atmosphere and interior is well designed. When I took my mom here yesterday, she was in awe. ""Wow, this place looks great!"" That's all that the Cheesecake Factory offers. The waiter brought us two empty plates. The dishwasher didn't clean it correctly, so he exchanged it for new ones right away. The food is not great. That's why you shouldn't bring your spouse here for an anniversary or have a first date here. My mom ordered a pasta and we both agreed that it tasted bland.  Finally, we shared a slice of cheesecake and my mom ordered a coffee. The slice of cheesecake was good, but it's not worth the money. The lunch+dessert+coffee+tip was around $34 that day. The place has a great atmosphere, but the food isn't worth anywhere near $34."
levi a.,"Mesa, AZ",3,21,7,5.0,5/18/2014,"Im honestly surprised to see even a single bad review for this restaurant. I was super impressed with the overall operation of this place.  This is my first visit to any cheesecake factory, and it was an excellent experience. I feel i should mention, i was there to have dinner with my wife and daughter, and i had no time restrictions. I wasnt in a hurry. I wasnt looking at the clock. I also wasnt worried about the cost. It seems petty, to me,to worry about dollars and cents when spending time with people you like. So my experience is based solely on what happened, and no outlying factors. We were seated promptly, and greeted by a friendly, nice looking server( i wanna say her name was rachel?, but like i said, i was here for family time) all of the staff appear clean, in clean uniforms, and nice looking. Drink orders, warm bread , blah, blah ,blah. Waitress was super patient when we werent ready to order, she seemed relaxed, and not at all hurried, even though the dining room is ENORMOUS. So we ordered. shrimp with angel hair and asparagus for me, chicken somethin for my wife, and plain burger for my kid. It was all good. Asparagus was perfectly cooked, uniform in color, crisp, but chewable. Pasta was 'al dente', which is exeptionally difficult to acheive in a commercial restaurant.  Now, i honestly couldnt tell you how long the food took, or how long we were there, or what the servers attitude was like, because I WASNT LOOKING for those things. In my opinion, if your in a hurry, or concerned with your funds, maybe a table service restaurant isnt your best choice. In conclussion: As a professional in the restaurant industry myself, i was extremely pleased with my experience here, and i will go so far as to say, ""cheesecake factory is pulling it off""."
Doug T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",724,324,1083,3.0,5/4/2013,"I haven't been to this place in ages so we decided to try this place again. It hasn't changed very much. Still has a huge menu with large portions.  I had the Cajun jambalaya pasta. It was very spicy with really tender chicken over a bed of pasta. I thought it was pretty good. My wife had the pasta over meat sauce which was pretty good but she could only eat half of it. My son had the rib-eye steak and it looked ok but he enjoyed it and my mom had a turkey and guacamole sandwich which was good. The best part of going to this place is the desert and we had the snickers and the red velvet cheesecakes. They were pretty good but not great. The food overall was pretty good.  The service was ok. It seemed like we had to wait a long time for our food and after we were done eating we had to wait a really long time for the server to come and get our desert order.  We got there right at 5pm and didn't have to wait for a table. Otherwise, I don't think the food is worth a really long wait."
Terren O.,"Mesa, AZ",0,2,,5.0,2/5/2015,"My first time here. Its was awesome. The waiter was excellent, very attentive. The food was very good. I would recommend and will be coming back again."
Pri M.,"Chandler, AZ",21,8,,1.0,3/3/2015,my boyfriend and I went here a couple days ago and he got a pasta with chicken. The next day he woke up with food poisoning. We used to go there for every special occasion and never had a problem with anything. Never coming back.
