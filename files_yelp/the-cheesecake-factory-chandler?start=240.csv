Carlene W.,"Mesa, AZ",11,2,,1.0,12/12/2014,"Went to get dessert with six friends. The wait was supposed to be 30 minutes. Waited for 40 then went to find out only to be told I was on the list. Then the hostess claimed to have buzzed us, which never happened. Service sucks. Will not be returning."
Sebastian S.,"Austin, TX",8,4,,1.0,7/5/2014,Worst service I've ever received at a Cheesecake Factory. Our server Morgan was extremely rude and got our orders completely wrong.
Robert C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,16,1,5.0,9/1/2013,Very good service excellent Steak cooked perfect to My liking the asparagus was delicious.  My Son really enjoyed His Hawaiian Pizza abd of course the. Cheesecake was incredible!!!!
Melanie R.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",21,7,3,5.0,8/23/2013,"The only time I come here is for happy hour and it's always amazing! It's from 4-6 and most of the appetizers are $5 or a little more. The bartenders are friendly, very attentive, and great at multitasking."
Allan D.,"Bellevue, WA",0,7,,4.0,1/7/2016,"my wife and I went there on new years day and the service was great. got a seat right away. I had the factory burrito grande and it was fantastic, she had a past dish which  was great too (not exactly sure the name of the dish) we were to full to have any desert..maybe it was because of all the complimentary bread they bring to you before hand.."
Ashley S.,"O'Fallon, MO",46,39,12,3.0,9/9/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. The service was amazing, the manager even came over at one point and told us not to worry our food was on its way (while my boyfriend and I didn't even think it had been a long time.) The food was just okay. We got calamari as an appetizer, it was good, but just a little to chewy. My pasta was bland..and for $16 dollars I've had way better pasta. My boyfriend got a hamburger and he asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it came out well done. While this dinner experience was just meh I've had a lot better food from here..so all hope isn't lost!  Then we both got a piece of cheesecake which was super scrumptious so at least there was that!  If anything we'll probably give this place another try for lunch at some point."
Luke G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,10,,5.0,1/2/2016,Great food and great service! Got the ribeye and banana cream cheesecake for dessert. CCF doing it right. #Cheesecake
Aileen B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2488,894,5857,3.0,2/7/2010,"1/12/10 I try not to visit chain restaurants as much as possible, but when Mom texted that she could meet me somewhere for a bite to eat, it was much easier to tell her to meet me at The Cheesecake Factory at the mall than it was to give her directions to try a local place in downtown Phoenix or elsewhere.  (Believe me, I've tried.) Since we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.   We decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead. Great service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.  Why even bring stale, hardened bread to the table?  It's the reason why I downgraded from the previous four-star rating to a three..."
F M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,10,,5.0,12/11/2015,"I took my husband for his birthday last night, the staff was awesome! I dropped off balloons and flowers before we went and they were very helpful surprising him! They brought it out with the dessert and sang happy birthday.  The personal touch really made it an excellent time!  Thank you so much for the help!"
Marylou D.,"Chandler, AZ",3,45,15,1.0,5/24/2014,"We only went here because we got a gift card to go.. Long wait, very un personal customer service. I asked what was good and server wasn't really thrilled that I was asking questions and just said he's give us some time. Well it took forever for him to come back, we ordered and waited. Strawberry lemonade was way too sweet, also for some odd reason we didn't have a bread basket like the other tables...well we got our meals and they looked like they had been just thrown on the plate. The best thing were the mashed potatoes. Salmon was overpowered by the spices, literally had to scrape them off. Had the white chocolate macadanian nut cheesecake, which was amazing. That was the best thing we had all night, I would probably not go if I was the one paying."
Cindy L.,"Tempe, AZ",32,9,16,3.0,4/24/2013,Too dark to read the menu.  The foods are alright. Everything is very slow.... But the check...  Will not come back again.
Sham K.,"Chandler, AZ",21,42,924,5.0,8/3/2012,"Always have good selection of high quality food, friendly service, & awesome cheesecake.  Best place on earth to eat cheesecake, only problem is deciding which one to have out of 50+ flavors.  They have even gone the extra mile to cater to my vegan friends and if a problem arises they definitely try to make things right. Conveniently at the Chandler Fashion Center. =)"
Dustin F.,"Phoenix, AZ",10,6,18,4.0,8/26/2014,"Good Happy Hour prices...full sized appetizers for less than half the price...$5 and and most are around $12 normally. Plus $5 tall Mojitos. Usually hit the Chandler Mall location on a day of shopping, and have never had a bad meal and service always good"
Susan J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,1.0,11/23/2014,"The waiter was fantastic. ..most of the food was good but my daughter's medium rare steak was more medium well, and when we sent it back, the manager Michelle came out and argued with us. Meanwhile everyone else had finished and she was hungry so she ate the overcooked steak. We hear Michelle is leaving, but I'll call and ask before I come back. This was a party of 6, we spent a lot of money and she was extremely rude."
Vikki D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,12,13,1.0,4/19/2014,"We were waiting 15 min for someone serve us, and then 10 min for ordering food, the coming 20 min for food cooking and came out no napkin no silverware but a rush guy threw the dish on the table then left.  That's my first experience eat at CHEESECAKE FACTORY, but also last time too at least the last time!  Btw, the food is under cook!  Good luck!  Guys."
Rob V.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/19/2014,Very Beautiful restaurant - that's about it. I didn't expect fine dining but this was tasted like overpriced tv dinners.  It used to be ok now it just falls way short of acceptable.
Nicole G.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,114,,2.0,7/30/2014,Absolutely terrible customer service!!! Both over the phone and in person!! I waited on hold twice to place a to go order. The first time I was disconnected after a couple of minutes the second time I gave up and hung up as I was almost to the restaurant anyways!! Walked in the was rudely directed to the bakery. Waited there to place my order. Was given the wrong order and had to ask for it to be corrected which it was. The cheesecake is always good but I will drive further to a different location for better customer service any day!!
D D.,"Phoenix, AZ",115,159,20,2.0,3/20/2012,"I've got to downgrade my original review after today.  We were seated in the bermuda triangle. We waited 15 minutes for a server to show up, apologize profusely then disappeared for another 15 minutes.  That was the theme for this meal. Sorry for the wait, now wait some more.  Glad they finally got a printed kids menu. Kids pizza was extra greasy, came out 25 minutes before my entree salad. For almost $17 I was hard pressed to find any chicken or bacon in my chopped Cobb salad. Zero blue cheese. I would have told the server but he disappeared until it was time to flag him down for our bill, which took him two passes by our table to drop off. Thank goodness I had correct change so I didn't have to endure another 1/2 assed apology/long wait. blah!"
Alex H.,"Sedona, AZ",40,14,,5.0,10/1/2014,"Who doesn't love the cheesecake factory? Can't complain, service was great! Food always taste the same no matter which one you go to."
