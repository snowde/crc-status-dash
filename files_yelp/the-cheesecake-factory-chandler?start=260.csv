Alan H.,"Chandler, AZ",11,119,61,2.0,3/30/2014,Waiter lacked ability to serve properly very disappointed overall left with a second waiter so far not much better
Sum B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,6,,2.0,9/21/2015,"Our last three visits to this CF (August to Sept 6) have been sub-par at best. Staggered order delivery with 15 minute gaps, 55 minute long waits for food, cold items, absent wait staff (reeking of smoke)... It used to be great and we visited more than the typical patron, but it's time to give it a rest until management addresses clear staffing and structure problems at this location."
Joan G.,"Gold Canyon, AZ",69,179,11,4.0,11/20/2013,"I hadn't been to this location in a long time and ended up wondering why  I don't come here more often. Probably the calories but the food was really good! I had the buffalo chicken strips and ordered a side of mashed potatos. Made my own meal! My daughter had the louisianna chicken pasta and it was really good. I love their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecake. They also have the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had and they do sell it to go. I usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and veggies. They do have a new ""skinny"" menu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items! The menu can be a little overwhelming but is well organized once you figure it out!"
Laurel N.,"Chandler, AZ",36,14,,2.0,7/31/2014,"Disappointed that if I order off the ""skinnylicious"" menu, I can't get bread and butter? What? If i ask for it, I know that it's not skinnylicious anymore but that should be my choice..."
Nayib M.,"Chandler, AZ",44,22,,5.0,7/9/2014,"Honestly amazed at their customer service. The food has always impressed me at The Cheesecake Factory and I've been to many. This time was no different, loved it and now they're serving a complete gluten free menu so I can take my gluten sensitive loved ones along with me! It is impossible to give The Cheesecake Factory less than 5 stars!"
Daisy J.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,20,,2.0,4/13/2014,"Cheesecake Factory does some things well but breakfast isn't one of them. Tried an egg dish one more time and yep, they still overcook them, brown and dry.  Way overpriced also, $16 for eggs and coffee...  I'll be back, but not for breakfast."
Gaudio F.,"Chandler, AZ",0,2,,4.0,10/18/2015,Good food. Good service. Good club sandwich. Salads are huge and good. Large portions for the price. Cheescake so so.
Joseph A.,"Gilbert, AZ",11,17,6,2.0,4/3/2012,"I went with my wife on a tuesday night at the restaurant and ordered Steak and Salmon dish. The Salmon was undercooked, so i asked the server to cook it more.  The manager came back with the dish and told me this is your medium well salmon.  I was offended by the way the manager handled the situation where he ruined my evening.  I had been a chef and a manager for couple years and would never say such thing to a guest.  This is an example of how some of the busiest places in town loose business."
L O.,"Lake Oswego, OR",0,17,,2.0,9/3/2015,"Really? Why do restaurants like this even exist, other than because of Americans' abysmal taste in food (which is based on the fact that Americans are subjected to crap like this every day and just don't know any better)?"
Don S.,"Phoenix, AZ",281,328,230,4.0,9/19/2012,"Perhaps it's not cool to like chain restaurants...and, perhaps there's a rationale to that sentiment with which I can't wholeheartedly disagree.... Still, I like this location of The Cheesecake Factory. My family eats here often, and when I join them, I usually leave well-satisfied. The service is great. The food is always delicious. And for the most part, they are very consistent at this location. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal, and I've experimented with many items on the menu. I'll most certainly return."
Brian N.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,43,8,5.0,1/24/2012,"The love the dim lights, the temp was perfect, the server was prompt, laid back just the way I like it. The portions are huge but they have a new skinnylicious menu that I love."
Jos B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,1.0,12/31/2014,"Customer service was not that great. We were taken to 3 different booths because the tables had not neen cleaned yet. Why not just have us wait? After the tour through the restaurant, I ordered the chicken picatta. It was fair at best. My son had the hibachi steak which was very good. And my daughter had chicken alfedo. Then the waitress made an unforgivable error. After she took my daughters left over plate (to pack in a to go box), she first stopped by a dirty table to clear dishes. She walked back into the kitchen with my childs plate of food in one hand and someone's dirty dishes in the other. Total cross contamination!! YUK!! Needless to say...we left the to go box there and it ended up being a waste of money and a disappointment!"
Vy L.,"Chandler, AZ",16,83,135,3.0,5/15/2014,Average American food. Nothing striking good. Thai lettuce is good. Calamari is great. Lunch menu is more reasonable than dinner.
Rodd R.,"Gilbert, AZ",24,57,1,5.0,7/5/2014,"Great food and selection, can't go wrong here.  The food has been good every single time and the service is consistently good."
John M.,"Tempe, AZ",101,31,15,4.0,6/29/2014,"Went during Sunday at lunch. Slight delays in service, but food was great as it always is. Only minor criticism is that they overcooked the chicken breasts on all of our meals so it came off as a little chewy and dry."
Sharon G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",204,276,106,4.0,12/1/2011,"Last night my bestie and I dined at the CCF with a friend from college and his co-worker who were both visiting from out of state. We were seated immediately. Drinks were served within minutes of our arrival. I ordered the avocado egg rolls (delicious!) and the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich was very good, but I had to take 1/2 of it home because I was so full. My bestie ordered a salad and it was huge! Overall this was a pleasant dining experience. I'll be back."
Kristin H.,"Mesa, AZ",26,62,16,1.0,1/16/2014,"I visited this location a couple of weekends ago. I was alone and just wanted to have lunch before I went to see a movie. I was seated in a section that was pretty much empty. I was placed in a corner and no server over to my table for 10 minutes. I even went so far as to make eye contact with a server and wave at her and she just looked away. I got up and went to the hostess station and told them that I wasn't going to wait ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I am a former server, bartender and host and I feel like this is unacceptable for the staff to flat out ignore someone."
Chris O.,"Phoenix, AZ",148,486,266,3.0,6/20/2009,"Dinner prices for lunch. That's what I thought when looking at the menu this afternoon. But, I was meeting with a former coworker and dear friend who had her perfect baby girl almost two months ago and she needed to get out of the house, so it was a date. She was running late so I ordered the ahi tartare, which is served over chopped avocados and soy sauce. This was very good, and helped to curb my appetite until she arrived. I ordered the lunch pizza, which comes with a salad. I try to go for a white pizza because red sauce some times tends to disagree with me. A pretty good pizza. The salad was fine as far as salads go, but the shredded carrots and cucumbers proved to be messy and I ended up with enough salad on my lap to feed a family of rabbits. Seriously, normally I'm not nearly as messy. Heather, our server, was great! She managed to be attentive without hovering, an important yet rare quality that landed her a dandy tip. But all that pales in comparison to my wonderful dining companions, one of whom I'm proud to call a friend and the other who will hopefully be calling me Uncle in the near future."
Courtney X.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,125,33,5.0,8/28/2013,"I really like this Cheesecake Factory compared to some other locations I have been to in California.  I have had excellent experiences both with to-go and dine-in.  Kaitlin is the best to-go specialist!  She always makes sure I have what I ordered and makes sure to go through my order before I leave with it.  Joe is the server I had the last time I dined in the restaurant and he was wonderful.  I recently had to adopt a special diet and Joe really took the time to review what would work best for me.  After being a corporate trainer in the restaurant industry for several years I can honestly say both Kaitlin and Joe are great representatives of why this place is so good.  The food can only take you so far, but having a staff who does a great job and treats the customers well will bring people back for a long time to come."
Ryan U.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,2.0,7/30/2015,"Haven't been here in a while but not as good as I remembered. Also, expect to wait 3x the amount of time that you're told."
