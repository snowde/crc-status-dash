Nesto M.,"Payson, AZ",68,62,,2.0,1/31/2011,"""Oh Ma, a Cheesecake factory gift card! You shouldn't have"" no, seriously. She really shouldn't have. ""Nesto, take Helena out for a nice dinner"" Mom says beaming. At the Cheesecake factory??! But I love her... Cheesecake factory is ok.  For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said... I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her. The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking. I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo.  I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad.  I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic.  It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant.  Other than that I can think of no real reason to frequent here. There are just too too many great restaurants that I want to try in the Phoenix area."
Jim S.,"Maricopa, AZ",20,55,6,5.0,9/21/2013,Jared was my server great job made my experience great I work in the service industry so I know good service from bad this service was awesome recommended a pasta I loved it thanks for everything keep up the good work
David G.,"Las Vegas, NV",78,16,,5.0,11/20/2013,Can't beat Cheesecake Factory. One of my favorites. Jus had the salad and nachos tonight. The salad made it healthy for me. At least that's what I'm going with. The food was great as always.
Jennifer O.,"Phoenix, AZ",367,1822,73,2.0,2/4/2011,"Man... the cheesecake factory. I loved this place when I was like 8 years old and they were only located in california. Now, it is just a strange experience. It's strange because people line up to come here and wait an hour sometimes.... for what? The food is mediocre at best and it's incredibly overpriced. Anyway, my brother had given me a gift card to this restaurant for chrisanuka. So I finally got around to using it last night. I was in class until 8 and needed to go someplace that was open late (and since we had the gift card, this was the place). The first thing I really hate about this restaurant is the menu size. It is totally unnecessary and every time I go here I just sit and stare at the menu for ever before figuring out what I want. And it's not because it is all too good, It is trying to figure what type of food do I want, what isn't going to be incredibly ridiculously unhealthy, and what isn't 15$ because that is just too much to be spending on a mediocre meal in a chain restaurant. I could go to a pretty good local restaurant and pay the same. Also, with such a big menu I wonder how much of it could possibly be fresh... everything on their menu can't be ordered everyday...? I don't know. So last night I finally decided on the Saigon chicken sandwich with a side salad and the BF got the club. Both were fine, at least with the sandwiches the portion size isn't quite so crazy.  Kind of on a side note, our waitress last night was really strange. I think she was putting on an accent and she kept including herself in her questions ie Would we like some pepper on our salad? (um I don't know, would you, creepy waitress lady?) Also, I don't know if the restaurant changed, or what, but she spouted off a 5 minute speech when we got there about the menu (and on page 5 you will find this item, and on page 7, this item).... that was really strange. I have the menu right in front of me.... it is large, so maybe I need direction around it, but generally I can read. So anyway, for two sandwiches, no drinks, we paid 27$. That is insane. But we had the gift card, so it turned out alright.... but seriously... why do people eat here? I do not understand it! What is the appeal!!!?!?!?!?! Ok sorry for the rant."
Robert D.,"Vasastan, Stockholm, Sweden",15,86,15,3.0,1/1/2014,Good place with reasonable prices. Had the BBQ burger which was good and the sweet potato fries were really good as well... Being in the mall this place is definitely a good alternative.
Werner B.,"Denver, CO",4,84,32,2.0,4/4/2015,"The place operates like a machine with formulated dishes brought to your table by android servers.  Went for lunch and ordered the four-cheese pasta and a vegetarian burger with sweet potato fries. Made one request to NOT have pickles anywhere near the burger. The server confirmed the no-pickle request, but surprise, surprise the burger was covered in pickle slices when it was delivered to the table. I CAN'T STAND THE TASTE and SMELL of them. They offered to take the burger back and remove the pickles. I ended up removing them myself, and cutting off part of the burger patty touched by the pickles. Having to reorder the food would have taken another 30 minutes I didn't have time for today. The waitress who took the order never apologized or acknowledged the issue. The sweet potato fries were as good as you expect, few people really know how to do them right anyway. They were undercooked inside and didn't have a hint of crunchiness on the outside. The four-cheese pasta was well received by my lunch mate. Order off the menu as is and you'll get the formulaic food, but don't order anything with a slight modification. It appears the robots in the kitchen or wait staff can't manage a simple request.  I wouldn't be so harsh had this been a one-time experience. It's the third this has happened so perhaps three is indeed enough."
Ceci G.,"Tempe, AZ",113,421,45,3.0,5/18/2011,"Good for cakes!! Food....humm my problem with restaurants here is that as food options, they are always limited. Sandwiches, pizza, soup, salads or pasta. So we tried pasta Da Vinci and Chicken picata. The second one tasted better, the first hummm not that good.  Next time will stop ONLY for cake!"
Matthew C.,"Chandler, AZ",923,106,,5.0,5/28/2011,"With a rich atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and food to die for, this restaurant is truly something special My wife and I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, Stuffed Mushrooms, Chicken Bellagio, and Mahi Mahi Mediterranean.  Every morsel of what we ate was divine. I highly recommend the mushrooms, and trying the Bellagio put my mouth in food Heaven. Tiana C was extremely pleasant waiting on us, and other than maybe prices being a ""smidge"" high, and I do mean just a smidge, there's nothing I would change about Cheesecake Factory"
J A H.,"Chandler, AZ",20,97,13,2.0,11/13/2011,"Pumpkin cheesecake is really good. But the to-go bakery orders get messed up every time i come here. I'm talking, for years. Always someone different. It's like they just don't care.   The last guy was completely apologetic, but not apologetic enough to get a manager to open the locked door after I discovered our strawberries for the strawberry cheesecake (you pay extra for them) were not in our bag. We were in the mall. The mall doors were locked, and we were trying to go back out the door we came in. He made me go outside around to their front door to bring me the strawberries. I'm glad some lady was coming out the mall door and held it for me to go back in, or I'd have had to walk all the way around the mall to my car in the cold w/o my coat or my family, who were way inside and I said I'd be right back. People must like it despite the high prices, because it's usually packed and there's always a wait if we want to eat here. I've just had bad experiences getting the to-go bakery items."
Sarah G.,"Phoenix, AZ",314,263,504,3.0,3/1/2009,"I had gotten a Gift Card for Christmas that I finally decided to use.  I really had mixed feelings about going based on some past experiences and all the kitchen drama that you may or may not have heard of. (google it)  Regardless of that though we had a really good experience this time.  Our waiter Hoki was wonderful, service was A+. I would advise requesting his section if you ever eat here.  Their Passion fruit Ice Tea is delicious and our glasses never emptied and were always refreshed with ice on each refill.  I ordered the Grilled Salmon from the fresh fish selection, it came with Steamed Broccoli and rice. (see pics) It was really good, the Salmon was cooked perfectly. Something I Would definitely order again.  The Mr. Ordered the Boston House Salad (see pics) I shared a few bites and also enjoyed it. His entree was the Four Cheese Pasta which he really liked too, sorry no pic.  For dessert we Shared a slice of the Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake (see pics). WOW! That was sinfully good!  Our service and experience based on today's visit is worthy of 4 stars ( Hoki deserves 5) but an average rating based on all my visits combined I'll go with 3 stars."
Christina M.,"Chandler, AZ",50,2,,1.0,7/20/2014,I wish I could have gave this 0 stars but I can't first thing there was a hair in my food and everyone has only ate a little of there food and had to stop cuz we was disgust my one friend Alex was sick from it them we got the manager and she only was gonna say sry then we was like can u take all this off and she only took the noodles off although we a couldn't eat our food it seems like everytime I come there there's a problem or hair in my food and I think it's because we ask for our food crispy when I ask Chrispy we get a hair when we don't no hair plus very rude customer service NEVER EAT HERE
Bill J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,41,2,2.0,1/24/2014,"well its exactly what you expect from a large chain restaurant, massive portions and below average food quality.  Kids like it and its not a bad vibe.  If you are anywhere near being a foodie don't go here!  Find a locally owned restaurant and enjoy dinning out.  I had the chicken and biscuits, it was presented as a pile of food that looked like a pizza delivery guy drove it around the block a few times before it made it to my table.  need I say more......."
Jennifer G.,"Danville, CA",33,100,45,4.0,8/21/2009,"OK, I really feel that this place rocks...chain or no chain, CF is in another league when it comes to chain restaurants.  I have yet to have a bad experience (or even anything mediocre) at any of the locations.  The overall quality, selection, atmosphere and service are always top notch.  I generally only eat lunch here, dinner on occasion and even at the peak of the lunch hour, I have never experienced slow or lacking service. Today we were really hungry, so we started with Buffalo Blasts for an appetizer, these are amazing (see pics).  They taste like a fabulous combination of fried chicken and hot wings, served with hot sauce, blue cheese (the real deal) and celery sticks.  We both ordered salads, the BBQ Ranch Chicken (topped with onion rIngs) and the Chinese Chicken salad which has always been delicious.  We finished off the meal with a slice of Vanilla Bean cheesecake which is lighter than some of the other kinds, and absolutely delicious.  I could enjoy a big bowl of the whip cream by itself! Overall, I really enjoy this place and always look forward to treating myself to lunch here.  And it doesn't hurt that it's in the mall....lunch AND shopping is never a bad thing :)"
Jay M.,"Phoenix, AZ",199,550,1368,4.0,8/3/2013,This place has a decent sized menu. Lots of desserts! Staff was friendly & we were never waiting on anything too long. Food was good.
Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1180,306,5.0,6/14/2008,"So, Andrea and I decided to head to Cheesecake Factory for my birthday celebration on Friday night.  I've always loved Cheesecake factory for a lot of reasons, and have yet to find a reason to NOT love it here.  They have such a great menu selection, the decor is always nice, and I love how theres tons of space to dine, socialize and hang out. Anyways, I got there first so we could get a seat.  It was busy, but thats not a surprise since it was a Friday night.  The girls at the counter were nice and friendly, and told me the wait was only going to be about 15 minutes.  (not bad!)  They gave me a buzzer and I waited in the lobby area for Andrea. Anyways, I was seating rather quickly, which was nice!  Our server was friendly and cool, and immediately asked what we would like to drink. I got some water, and Andrea got some Iced Tea. We studied the menu for  a minute, and I ended up getting the shepards pie.  I could really have almost any one of thier dinners here, and find that I will like what they serve me regardless.  I love the variety!   Anyways, I was happy becuase I felt like our server was available, and even tho it was busy, she didnt make me feel like that, and that was awesome! Anyways, I still love this place and its just awesome.  Great place to bring anyone! Parents, dates, friends, whatever.   I really don't think you can go wrong here."
Sandy C.,"Chandler, AZ",9,301,120,2.0,7/19/2010,"For the most part, Cheesecake Factory has done pretty well 99% of the time when I come here. Well, this is the 1% time that I think it was actually bad.  We waited 10 minutes before anybody came to greet us at the table.  It then took her 15 minutes to go get water.  It then took 25 minutes for the food to get to us. We ordered salad and noodles, not steak. You rang our bill up. THEN started spewing on about the new desserts on the menu.... uh... hello? Need I say more?!  I apologize for the 10% tip ""Missy"" (our waitress), but you're lucky you got a tip at all. And NO, saying my 8 month old is cute half way through my meal does not make up for the crappy service you just dished out. I will be back here since Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to dine, but this time it was just a total miss!"
Jen T.,"Gulfport, MS",134,273,487,5.0,5/6/2013,"Went on Saturday for lunch, delicious, great service and we tried the stuffed chicken tortillas I think they are called and it was so delicious I kept eating from my sons dinner. I usually get the chopped salad from the sides menu and it is a really good sized salad with chicken and blue cheese.  It is $10.50 but can definitely be your meal and has just enough dressing to be light and you feel good after eating it, not over stuffed as it is easy to do here. The warm sourdough bread is awesome and I am not a bread fan whatsoever.  Our waitress was Brittney, an absolute beautiful young lady and she was very sweet. We love this place and have never had a bad thing to report. Just prepare to wait if you are in a vacation destination such as my hometown of San Diego or Hawaii. Very busy and popular."
Terry H.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,30,,5.0,1/25/2015,"Great service, place is very nice and clean. Food was good and server was attentive. We will go back for sure!"
S R.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,75,13,3.0,11/1/2014,"Tia,  the hostess,  took my name for a party of 2 with nobody ahead of us. My mom politely asked for a booth.  I saw a party of 3, 5, then 6 get seated before us.  Finally one of several the girls seating everyone asked about why my mom and I were not seated.  Tia said she didn't know. The girl proceeded to seat us and apologized.  I told her that I was wondering why so many groups went before us.  Food was great.... We didn't complain, but Tia sure needs customer service skills training."
