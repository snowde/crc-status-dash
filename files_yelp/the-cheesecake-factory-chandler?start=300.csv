Tiffany W.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,49,1,5.0,10/20/2012,"The wine was great, the cheesecake was awesome, the crab cakes were delish! My daughter had the mini corn dogs a great deal and she loved them! Very impressed with the cleanliness of a restaurant located in a busy mall."
Allison O.,"Stanfordville, NY",0,22,,1.0,3/24/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants, so the utter disappointment with our visit there last night really makes me sad. We didn't have to wait to be seated which is really surprising since this place is always packed. The hostess showed us to our table, and as we were sitting down, a waitress very rudely came to the table and told the hostess that someone was already sitting there. The hostess said it was okay to sit there anyway, so my boyfriend and I started looking at the menu. The waitress who said that someone was already sitting there was literally giving us the evil eye. The hostess came back a few minutes later and asked us if we would mind moving to another booth because there were other people who were waiting for that booth first. If that was the only problem we had, I wouldn't be writing this review, but it got worse from there.  Our waitress was very nice and pleasant, and she in no way contributed to our horrible experience. We ordered our food at 6:45pm. I ordered the chicken maderia and my boyfriend ordered the Moroccan chicken. We waited and waited for our food, and at 7:15 a manager came to our table and said that an ""overwhelming amount of people ordered pasta"" and because the Moroccan chicken came with kous kous, our food would be delayed. She said something like 300 people ordered pasta and the kitchen couldn't keep up. I've never heard of this happening before. She said it would be a little longer until we got our food, but it ended up being another half an hour before our food came. I'm sorry, but waiting an hour for 2 meals is not acceptable. My boyfriend said his meal was terrible and was not worth waiting an hour for. Needless to say, we won't be back to this location and probably to the Cheesecake Factory at all."
Navya S.,"Gainesville, FL",105,2,,1.0,7/24/2013,"The service sucks!! This is the third time I had to go to that place because of my office colleagues. I just ordered a pizza 'without' pepperoni and they got the order twice 'with' pepperoni and said sorry we messed up and finally got me an average tasting pizza with salty fried egg plant on top of it. And for all the mess they created, they did not even have the minimum courtesy to offer a waiver on my check! Last two times I have been there, the food was terrible to eat. The dish dripped in oil and french fries were bitter! The feeling of thinking about it while writing this makes me sick! Never going back to this place nor am I recommending it to anybody else. Overall there is only a 30 percent chance that you ll end up with good food if you go to this restaurant."
Cat D.,"New York, NY",69,42,,5.0,5/2/2013,"Love the busy and loud atmosphere, perfect for a weekend retreat. I always go for the chicken little, their veggie and salads are also great. The portions are enormous, you get what you pay for."
Thompson A.,"Payson, AZ",0,26,,2.0,9/11/2013,"2nd chance didn't make it better . They messed up our dinner order and had some  kitchen issue, so we had to wait. Food came Orange ckn and it was overcooked and very,very dry !"
Christina N.,"Mesa, AZ",93,148,612,2.0,8/12/2012,"So, my best friend wanted to treat me to lunch. We went for kind of a late lunch to just hang out and catch up. When we arrived, there was no wait to be seated but we did have to wait about five minutes before being approached by a waiter. We ordered our beverages and when she came back we ordered an appetizer to share (the crab cakes). When the came out, the looked delicious but I cannot say that they tasted the same. I know that the seafood in the desert is not nearly as fresh or delicious as if you are closer to the shore, but I've still had decent seafood here in AZ and this is not it. Then we ordered our entrees but for some reason ended up waiting a very long time for the food to come out. from the time we sat down until the time our food came out, it had been 45 minutes! What?!?! Come on, I mean there is no excuse for that, is there? And when the food did arrive, her sandwich was kind of a mess and my food was kind of bland. Oh well, what do you expect from a chain restaurant the has a novel for a menu because they cannot decide what type of food they should have...so they try to have it all..."
M H.,"Tempe, AZ",0,51,9,2.0,10/18/2014,"Nice atmosphere and friendly server, but blah food. No one in our party reported liking the food. Maybe it was the prices. I don't think that we will return."
Bruce A.,"Flagstaff, AZ",16,188,6,4.0,7/30/2012,"This is a very good Cheesecake Factory. The service was exemplary but Heather was outstanding. Very attentive yet not overbearing. The food was very good. We had Calamari, Endive salad, Ahi Carpaccio. The perfect light dinner. We will be back!"
Char D.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,34,1,1.0,11/22/2015,"This star is just for the food!! Were do I begin as this is now the second time in 2 weeks this restaurant has lackluster performance and pisspoor service overall. Tonight there appeared to be 3 managers that seem to know more about the socore of the football game than the entire bar of customers complaining loud and long for service. We waited 10 minutes and asked several people for a waiter then finally interuped another waiter to get us one. We waited 25 minutes for our food only to not get checked on or asked if we wanted cheese on our pasta. We, listened to one table give up on cheesecake and another beside us in a debate to not tip!! There was an abundance of staff but unorganized and mismanaged period. This particular restaurant seems to lack prompt let alone any type of attention to its customers that pay sizable price to wait for great food at a high level of agravation to get it!!"
B P.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,24,,2.0,11/22/2015,"I rated this two stars rather than one because I cannot deny the fact that the food is delectable, every single time. However, this was my second time at this location & compared to others, it just is not up to par. First off, it took us nearly 10 minutes sitting in the bar to be asked if we even wanted water. No server to be found. Upon asking of a server after being tired of waiting, we got one, who all night long was less than attentive. The only thing he did was take our order. Everything else; drink refills, food being brought out, bread, someone else did. It was as if we had 5 waiters. Our food took nearly 30 minutes. For two pastas. Which I will say, were amazing, I highly recommend the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce, it never disappoints. This location definitely needs some work though. And no, it's not that it is overly busy because it is at the mall, i've seen busier and bigger, some re training may be in order for the wait staff, or a reality check for management, since every table around us had the same problem even with different waiters/waitresses , and some even got tired of waiting for their cheesecake because they were ""out"". Very disappointing for such an expensive upper scale restaurant."
Tegan S.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,42,9,5.0,4/27/2014,"Fast, accommodating service and food was  great. Our server , Rosa, was delightful and eager to make sure our impromptu birthday dinner for my 10 year old went great. The did a great job accommodating food allergies too."
Dani C.,"Gilbert, AZ",209,233,65,4.0,4/29/2010,"Was there for my birthday yesterday, but it's not the first time I had been there. The service was excellent this evening, but I think that was because we got there at 5:30, just before the dinner rush hit. Our meals were brought to us in a very timely manner, and they even accommodated a picky child. I'm not sure why it says it's not good for kids, as the place was full of them and they have a kids menu.   The servings are always way more than you need. I had the Cobb Salad and brought most of it home. Had the calamari as an appetizer and absolutely loved it. And of course I needed a piece of vanilla bean cheesecake, after all it was my birthday. :-)  I definitely recommend going but try to plan a down time or just before or after a normal lunch or dinner rush."
Jennifer G.,"Pinal, AZ",73,208,,4.0,1/5/2012,"I will admit it! I have an unhealthy obsession with the Cheesecake Factory. Yes yes, this is a chain, I know. But honestly, I don't give a flying f*** if its a chain or an independent restaurant owned by some cute little family down the road. As long as the food is delicious and plentiful, the service fast and friendly, the cost is palatable,  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant, I will be a fan of any place. After all, isn't that what writing reviews and being a foodie is about? I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I can't think of a time when I had a non pleasant experience. Yes, there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others, but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service.  If you have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know about their menu. It is literally a book! They pride themselves in having something for everyone so there are tons of items to choose from. Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong:  Appetizers: - Sweet corn tamale cakes - Fried chicken sliders - Avocado Eggrolls - Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot. They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids - Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not, their clam chowder is the best I have ever had Entrees: - Chicken Costelleta - Chicken Chipotle Pasta - BBQ Ranch chicken salad - Salisbury chopped steak - Crispy spicy beef - Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavors Keep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. You could share one entree with another person and get an appetizer and be stuffed yet not spend alot. Now I will admit that there were some things I had at the CC Factory that were not that great. The crabcake burger is too greasy and overpowering, and their mac and cheese balls are nothing impressive. But the good far outweigh the bad and there definitely is something for everyone. Heck, if anything, there is always the cheesecake which they have in every flavor imaginable. Try the dutch apple or carrot, these are my favorites!"
Marty F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",265,314,13,3.0,11/14/2010,"Ive never been a huge fan of Cheesecake except for their amazing cheesecake.  What I have eaten here, Ive been happy with. First off, when you go there and sit down, they give you a catalog style menu that's about 20 pages long mixed in with company advertisements.  Cheesecake Factory has a ton of food.   I love their bread they bring out (of course not the best bread of all restaurants.. that goes to Firebirds).  Make sure to ask for more butter! They give you huge glasses for the drinks so that's a plus.  Ok now onto the food.  I personally love the Cuban sandwhich and for an appetizer you cant go wrong with the artichoke.  Just delicious. I go to CF maybe every four months.  It's not always on top of my list, but i""ll go if others want to. and last but not least... the dessert is top notch and a must (assuming you're not full)."
Karen W.,"Tempe, AZ",858,2081,4108,1.0,12/20/2011,"Every Cheesecake Factory will have the same quality food, but the service will greatly vary.  I placed an order for a cheesecake for someone's birthday at work several days in advance.  I told them my name, my order, and specifically requested that the cake be ready by 11:30 A.M. on the pick up date.  When I came at 11:30 to pick up my cake, they did not have my name on any order, and they did not have any whole cakes defrosted.  The cashier took my order right there and gave me the requested cake, but then proceeded to ask me ""Are you going to eat this cake right now?""  Telling her that our party was at noon, she proceeded to tell me ""You are going to have to wait 1.5 hours for the cake to defrost.""  What??  She did add in a quick ""Sorry"" but in that ""Sorry, but deal with it"" tone.  Due to this location's poor planning and bad customer service, we were unable to have the cake for the lunch party.  Since we were at work, we could not wait 1.5 hours for it to defrost since we only had a small block of time to serve it and eat.  I'm never getting anything from this location again, and if you get anything to go, I'd be wary of ordering any whole cakes from them."
Kirsten P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,34,1,5.0,5/19/2012,"Best chicken Pam around! Oh, and always get cheesecake. Not doing so should be a crime."
Michael C.,"Chandler, AZ",25,70,1,2.0,1/4/2010,"Just finished another meal here courtesy of a gift card. This place is always busy and I've never been able to understand why. If no one ever gave me a gift card here, I would never eat here. The service varies from very good to awful, but the food always never exceeds ""well, it didn't make me sick."" Today's meal failed even that low standard. As an appetizer I ordered some mini-corn dogs. I *love* corn dogs. At the fair, from Weinerschnitzel, from frozen at home, and so on. These little balls of corn meal enriched pancake batter were deep fried to near burnt and yet managed to soak up enough grease to squeeze out nice puddle of oil. I only ate one, but within five minutes I was nauseas.  The California omelet was not much better. Sour cream shouldn't curdle, right? The veggies and cheese were barely cooked. It was more like a salad wrap, where the wrap happened to be egg. If I had wanted a salad with egg, I'd have ordered a Cobb, not an omelet. The banana cheese cake was good according to the spousal unit & I enjoyed my strawberry lemonade. Still have $10 left on the gift card. I think that'll get me a couple of lemonades."
Mike H.,"Chandler, AZ",61,88,4,4.0,2/21/2010,"Its not cheap. Its not health-friendly. Its not ideal for vegetarians. So if you're budget-minded, health-conscious, or a vegetarian...this isn't the place for you. That being said, I love this place.  Sure the waits on Saturday nights suck, but that's how it is any place you might venture into unless its a little known gem.  But for me, the wait is completely worth it.  I eat whatever the heck I wanna eat, no matter how much heavy cream is in the sauce or how much sugar is in the desert or how much fried is in the fried whatever.  And yeah, I pay for it around the midsection but hey. Anyhow, the service has always been good, even close to closing time.   Bad service once in awhile is inevitable, and I'm sure I'll receive it here sooner or later, but so far we've been fortunate.  Whether we have a large party or just a couple of us, our food has come out in a timely manner each visit.  And none of us have had cold dishes. One of my cousins even changed her order after she got the first one and didn't like it...the waitress didn't even skip a beat. So far, I've had mostly pasta/rice dishes.  My favorite dish here at the moment is the something something Gumbo.  Its oddly rich and subtle at the same time, the kind of thing that makes you keep shoveling forkfulls in your mouth just to delight at this combo.  The sauce is creamy but not too heavy with just enough kick.  Like I said its subtle, but at the same time its a great flavor experience. Other dishes I've tried are the New Orleans shrimp something or another, and another cajun type dish.  Both were extremely tasty with HUGE shrimp, pieces of sausage or chicken or whatever was in it.   They DO NOT skimp on the portions.  I've read that some people are actually turned off by this.  I just think that if I'm paying money to eat, I should get as much for that money as possible.  And here, you do.  Last night, we commented on how a dish that costs only $13 could be chocked full of so many big fresh shrimp.  And recently, one of the kids and his dad ordered one of the burgers...this thing was a friggin' MONSTER!  It could eat a human.  And sure it would make any health-conscious person run for the hills, but for the rest of us, this burger would make your eyes get so big your eyeballs might fall out of their sockets.  Let's just say Red Robin's burgers look like White Castles compared to this.  Sadly, this specific burger is no longer on the menu, and to custom do it, they would've charged extra.  So that wasn't cool. And I think that is the only negative point I might have.  Seriously, I love this place.  Its only got 4 stars cause its not somewhere I can just up and say ""let's go!"" because of the prices.  Well......let's rethink that.  See, I HAVE to have cheesecake.  After all, it IS the Cheesecake Factory.  Its their defining thingy.  And cheesecake (plus a beverage) is what really rolls my bill over the line.  But is the cheesecake all that???  Oh my friggin goodness, yes. I cannot speak for all the cheesecakes on the extensive menu, for I simply cannot get past the Banana whatever cheesecake.  This is just the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth.  I won't attempt to describe it, just know that if you like anything to do with bananas, this is for you.  You two were meant to meet.  Destiny. And about that extensive menu...yeah its big.  Soooo many choices.  They've got pastas, rice dishes, platters, burgers, steaks, seafoods, pizzas (the littlest in our fam ordered a pizza and it was 2 times as big as his head)...and then of course all the appetizers, drinks, and deserts.  I don't know why someone would ever complain about a big menu.  That's beyond me. So what else?  Uhm, its a good place for a date...although I must say there seems to be so many complete hotties here at any given time, that some unfortunate glances my inevitably happen....so be warned fellas.  I suggest you wear sunglasses. Uhm, the bathrooms were clean each time I went.  Although this last time there was a big line....with food this rich, that is to be expected.   Atmosphere is enjoyable.  Some people may think its a little uppity, but coming from a guy who wears jeans and a t-shirt most days, I'd have to say its ok.  A lot of the teen crowd and early 20s, but its not an obnoxious atmosphere at all.  Its a family place. So...yeah.  If you can stand to spend about 20 bucks a person, don't care about the calories, and want some really good food and a lot of it, come."
DestinationFamilyVacation M.,"Phoenix, AZ",16,149,127,4.0,9/18/2010,"Jacob rocked!  We sat on the patio, we love the patios in Arizona! Jacob engaged our two children, which is always the sign of a great server and creates great dining memories for the kids!  We started with dessert first and Jacob brought our cheesecakes out super fast. Very attentive and courteous to listen to our kids' drawn out stories. He even had extra bread sent out to us, yummy!   The food is always great at the Factory, but the service Jacob provided made our visit Fantastic!  Thanks Jacob!!"
WeWho E.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,56,2,3.0,9/13/2010,"Amazingly long menu, tons of items but yet the vast majority of it doesn't really interest me.  High quality food, and well prepared but am I every really saying ""oh, I gotta go to the cheesecake factory tonight""?  No, not really. But at the same time I'd never really say no to going to the cheesecake factory, you're going to get a good well prepared meal there.   *serves coke products"
