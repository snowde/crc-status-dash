Candace R.,"San Francisco, CA",135,550,30,4.0,8/1/2010,"At the last minute, I changed my birthday dinner local from Oregano's to TCF. No hate against Oregano's, but I wasn't really that hungry and wanted cheesecake as opposed to a pizookie for dessert.  So we made our way to Chandla and our group of 6 was quickly seated, with no reservations mind you. Our server was very sweet, though it seemed she wasn't so well-versed with the menu quite yet. Most of our group ordered off of the small plates menu. I got the chicken samosas (I had no idea what they were, and neither did our server) with the caribbean cooler to drink. Both of which were delightful. Everyone else seemed pleased with their dishes.  For dessert, they came over and did the birthday thing, and I had the RED VELVET CHEESECAKE WHICH IS SO GOOD OMG. I can't wait to have the other half that is sitting in my fridge as we speak."
David K.,"Tempe, AZ",3,23,,1.0,11/30/2012,"I did not want to go since the last two times I was here they messed up my order. Not something simple like a lost side, but no sauce with jambalaya and no chicken on the salad. But I went anyway since wifey wanted to go. Terrible service. Walked in and no one greeted us. Not any of the half dozen servers, the manager, or the hostess at the front. STRIKE 1. Hostess finally saw us waiting and took our name and said it'd be a few minutes. A party ahead of us got seated by the manager. While heading back to the front, he stops to chat up a girl server. Then walks past me to the bar to chat up the bar tender. STRIKE 2. Meanwhile, the hostess is on her phone checking something. When the manager walks by, she puts it away and reorganizes the menus on her table. When the manager walks past her to the bar, she sees me again and asks me if I am ready to be seated now. Why couldn't I have been seated before? Oh, I know... cause you were too busy texting/facebooking/twitting on your phone. STRIKE 3."
Barb M.,"Tempe, AZ",0,8,1,3.0,6/9/2013,"I like the Cheesecake Factory menu, but the portions, calories, and sodium and fat counts are really too much. I like their happy hour, however."
Teresa M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,18,1,2.0,2/24/2014,"I like to dine at the bar for lunch. Female bartender is very efficient at multitasking but she likes to scream across the bar to take your order while making drinks, even when it's not busy. Today, she faced the register while she took my order. I was literally talking to her back. She tends to need to be reminded a couple of times for things. Someone please tell her to slowdown, face her customers, stop taking orders from other side of bar. She looks like she's hustling but it ends up being bad service."
Big E.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,91,,5.0,3/14/2013,"I don't usually review chains but let me just say something about their tropical iced tea, because that's what I really go there for!  It's the best iced tea anywhere ever. Please don't ever change your iced tea.  Of course the food and cheesecake are good but the iced tea is truly where it's at!!"
Sujith P.,"Tempe, AZ",0,45,,4.0,7/28/2012,"Delicious food, great service, wide variety of options on the menu. Good for vegetarians too. I am a fan of their Veggie burger and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. The complimentary bread is amongst the best too, definitely beats Olive garden, especially the brown one. I've tried only one of their chocolate Cheesecakes and I liked when when I began eating but it was too big for me to enjoy till the end. It would be a good idea to split a slice amongst two people. This restaurant may seem a little pricey but the portions are big and the ambience and service easily make it worth it."
April V.,"Monroeville, PA",12,46,,1.0,1/14/2014,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! My family of 4 waited over an hour for our food and the server NEVER came to let us know why it was taking so long, refill drinks or check on us for anything! My husband finally had to track down a manager and she told us the computer system crashed, still no communication between management and the patrons, staff or anyone, when the food came it was horrible and cold, we were beyond unhappy. Will NEVER go back."
Anupama G.,"Chandler, AZ",28,7,9,5.0,10/30/2012,It's the season for Pumpkin Cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory have the best Pumpkin Cheesecake and  Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. Make sure to order ahead of time for Thanksgiving!!!
Thomas W.,"Chandler, AZ",1,23,7,4.0,1/11/2013,"We love cheesecake factory. Good, consistent service and food. Been to chandler only once, our server was very attentive and helpful with my wife's allergy to dairy. Always a good job Cheesecake Factory! Thanks!"
Kimberly G.,"Seattle, WA",150,238,49,3.0,10/30/2013,"I have mixed feelings on the Cheesecake Factory. I have come to the conclusion that the Cheesecake Factory needs to find out what they want to be. Do you want to be a Mexican restaurant? A steakhouse? An American grill? Clearly this mix match of food and seven menu pages worth of choices has worked for them for a long time but my belief is that you can't do something great if you try to do 100 things at one time. Too many menu items! While variety is nice, the menu is overwhelming and the chef's have way too much room for error. My food has always been just okay here but it is clear to me why. I do love the cheesecake. It is my favorite dessert so that is of course ultimately why I come here. I generally decide to make a meal of it when I do come here and often just wonder why I didn't just go to The Keg across the street. Why have a mediocre steak when you could have an amazing one? For now I think I will just stick to The Cheesecake Factory's namesake. How did a dessert restaurant turn into a free for all of tex mex, steaks, burgers, pasta and seafood, oh my!"
Chuck R.,"San Francisco, CA",509,191,114,3.0,2/3/2009,This is a hard one because their food is so good and in such large portions but everytime I've been there the service is really slow and crappy. Was there for dinner on Monday and whilst there wasn't many people in there we still had to wait about 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 to order the appetizer... with our food btw. But their bread rocks at the beginning of the meal and the chicken marsalla is so awesome as is the goulash and mostly everything else.  The cheesecake is the best i've ever had even though I don't get it everytime... not a huge sweets guy but it is really good. I'd still say go but be patient...
Francesca R.,"Thornliebank, United Kingdom",109,563,64,2.0,10/28/2009,"OK it's official.  I don't like the Cheesecake Factory.  I've tried it a few times, and I'm not a chain snob.  Bring me some Bertucci's and I'm happy.  But here?  No.  Just no.  I don't get it. The food is utterly mediocre (I suppose what does one expect, from a *factory*), and personally I find the portions an affront to good taste.  They are disgusting!  It's like a trough.  Anyone who can eat a whole plate of their food in one sitting needs to get help.  It's also waaaay overpriced.  I guess you're paying for quantity, not quality?  I mean you get enough food to feed yourself for a week. The decor is so confused and charmless.  I feel like I'm on an acid trip when I'm in there--an acid trip that's gone very, very wrong and you've forgotten that life isn't a Lewis Carroll-ian hellscape. One extra star for good service and good cheesecake.  But overall I can definitively say I won't be back to this particularly wretched chain."
Meg Z.,"Holland, MI",143,189,4,3.0,11/7/2009,"Can I complain about the 15+ pages of menu?  Well, I'm going to.  I'm a vegetarian, and picky at that, but the menu confuses and overwhelms me!  Thank goodness this wasn't my first time.  In addition, I can't help but wonder....if a restaurant offers so many items can all the ingredients be fresh and can they do each dish at a high quality?  Although I wanted to try the grande burrito, I wasn't going to risk it.   I stuck with what I know, and that's a greek salad and the white bean hummus.  It was really good and tasted fresh, I'll give 'em that!   Service was pretty good for it being so busy.  The fiance didn't seemed too thrilled with his meal and no one else was raving about anything other than the mashed potatoes.   Oh well.  Definitely an A-OK place."
Gianna R.,"Lake Worth, FL",1388,542,716,4.0,2/26/2011,"You can never go wrong with a cheesecake factory.. The restaurant we were supposed to go to was only having a tasting menu and we got stuck coming here on our date night... The service was good it was packed we sat at a bar table, the waitress was very sweet and the drinks were strong I had my usual the crusted chicken romano and it was just as good as always.. Besides all the fans coming up to us it was a great night....."
SJ M.,"Chandler, AZ",148,5,1,1.0,4/18/2011,After waiting for over an hour (also with 2 little kids )I finally get my $16.00 spicy chicken pasta and the noodles are hard... this isn't what I would expect after waiting so long. At this point I have no desire of waiting for them to bring me a new plate.  They didn't even offer to take it off the bill! There are tons of places to choose in this area I'm  not sure I will ever go back.
Jasmine C.,"Phoenix, AZ",175,853,,3.0,6/28/2009,I went the other night with my husband.  Love the bread that comes before the meal.  I got the vegetarian pasta which is one of the few vegetarian items they have- bummer- it it was just okay.  I wouldn't get it again.
lindsay b.,"Los Angeles, CA",852,259,25,1.0,7/9/2008,"I used to eat here all the time till I realized they use trans fat in everything!!!!!! They use as much if not more than fast food places!! 1,560 calories and 84g of fat for their carrot cake, and 1080 cal, 71g fat, and 100 carbs for a slice of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake.  And those are far from being the only unhealthy items on the menu. Seemingly innocent entrees like salads and sugar free cheesecake can also be calorie-packed diet-wreckers. For example, rumor has it that The Cheesecake Factory's Chinese Chicken Salad clocks in at about 1,600 whopping calories. And the 6 Carb Original Cheesecake has 610 calories and 57g of fat.  Disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!"
Jenn C.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,104,5,4.0,8/21/2011,"I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory takes them to the next level. The atmosphere is festive and upscale. Despite the size of the restaurant, it's actually a really nice place to have a romantic dinner with your sweetie. My fiance and I like to go here to celebrate special events like our anniversary or our birthdays. We don't go here on a regular basis because it's a bit pricey. The food is really delicious, though. The avocado spring rolls are my favorite."
Brooke R.,"Bay Area, CA",530,962,32,2.0,4/27/2008,"I knew what I was getting into when I came here.  Cheesecake Factory food is just not good.  However, this one is a little worse than the others. I won't even talk about the food because chains are chains, the food here is no different from the others. The service here is awful!  I tried something new, didn't like it, ate two bites, and it was promptly taken away by the waitress.  Did she ask if everything was alright?  No.  Did she ask if she could bring out something else?  No.  Did she take it off the bill?  No.  I just assumed that was Cheesecake Factory policy, as I had never experienced only eating a couple bites of a dish here before.  What bothered me was how rude she was about everything and how slow it took her to bring out the dessert menu after we asked for it (even though I've memorized the cheesecake offerings, I still need to look at them to pick one out). For dessert we had the new special cheesecake, pistachio with chocolate waves.  Blah."
Lisa N.,"Chandler, AZ",38,69,6,4.0,7/5/2010,"Cheesecake is never disappointing. We went today for lunch, my boyfriend and I. We decided to split a small appetizer and then split a chicken parm sandwich. I placed the order, and the waitress asked if we wanted salad or fries, I said fries. Then the BF decides he wants to be the boss of the relationship and ordered salad. Ha, he is just so funny. So when the waitress passed back by I said can please have the salad and a side of fries. She said, ""I was gonna bring you some fries anyways"". What a great waitress she was. She was very good at keeping our ice teas full and kept us stocked on ice too. It was once again, Another great experience at Cheesecake Factory. I love this place! A bit pricey if you dont split the orders but its always a good meal! Love it!"
