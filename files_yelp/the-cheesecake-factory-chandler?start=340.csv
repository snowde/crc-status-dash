John H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,1.0,6/15/2010,"Careful eating here - This Cheesecake Factory gave me and my wife food poisoning from Chinese Chicken Salad, undercooked chicken or workers handling lettuce. Either way it has a history of unsanitary violations."
Nikki S.,"Mesa, AZ",2,4,,5.0,10/6/2011,"Loved it!!!! Great Food wonderful service!!!!!!! Perfect Birthday at Cheesecake Factory, appetizers were perfect, dinner and drinks were prefect! Thank you Cheesecake Factory"

B T.,"Chandler, AZ",0,19,,3.0,1/19/2011,"They finally have a kids menu!!!  We used to go to Cheesecake all the time with our kids.  We basically got sick of paying for adult entrees for our kiddos and family dinner out would cost well over $100.  Cheesecake is not a place that my husband and I would choose if we were out alone.  So aside from the occasional lunch salad while shopping or getting cheesecake to-go, we haven't been here in a long time. My #3 son chose Cheesecake for his birthday dinner.  Items ordered included calamari (same at all chains), fried mac and cheese appetizer (delish), Chicken Maderia (sweet, tender chicken), Low-calorie chicken and asparagus (boring, but served it's purpose), 4 cheese pasta with chicken(huge portion, but again same as any chain), buffalo blaster (fried  boneless chicken wing something), kids quesadilla (over priced for tortilla and cheese), farmhouse cheese burger (good, not great). We had 4 cheesecakes...Key lime, red velvet, apple caramel struesel, reeses peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake.  All were FANTASTIC! The cheesecake will always be the 1 thing that keeps us coming back.  I still think everything is overpriced, but at least they are consistent.  Service was good this time.  When we left, they were on a wait, but there were tables open everywhere.  Clearly a staffing issue, but I am sure frustrating to customers."
Sarah S.,"Mesa, AZ",5,43,,3.0,5/17/2007,"If you want a place that has something for everyone this is the place.  The menu is at least 15-20 pages long.  Check online before going so you are not completely overwhelmed. We have been here twice.  The first time we had a horrible experience with service.  We asked to have the manager come to our table and he only spoke to me even though my husband was talking to him.  We were given free cheesecake as a compensation and it was warm.  Needless to say we were not impressed. We tried it again last year and the wait was long again, but at least we got to our table when promised.  Service was better too.  He did mix up drinks and checks though at the end with our party. If you have not been- go once and see what you think.  Most of the prices are $8-$15.  Cheesecake will run you between $5-$8 a slice."
Rebecca E.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,19,,3.0,8/18/2010,"I have eaten at many cheesecake factories, from Biltmore/Phoenix to Kierland to Irving, CA to San Diego and beyond, and. I can honestly say that my experience this last Saturday has completely soured the experience. I know that one lousy waitress shouldn't ruin my entire opinion of a franchise, but ""Tiana"" our waitress as pretty much guaranteed that it will be a LONG time before I return. It took forever to get anything we ordered. After saying we were not interested in dessert, she proceeded to spend 15 minutes telling us about the new items on the menu. She brought out our check without asking if we would like to split the check. We gave her 2 cards told her to put $X on one card and the balance on the other. When she brought it back, she had done the opposite. A few days later when we looked online at our bank accounts, she did not charge me at all and charged my friends card twice. It was just a miserable experience and I hope it doesn't speak for the chain as a whole and the types of people they are choosing to hire to represent their brand."
Cher T.,"Tempe, AZ",310,166,72,5.0,2/8/2008,"The lemonade was AWESOME!! There's sugar on the rim! :)  The food was good, I had the lousiana inspired dish, I can't remember the exact name. For dessert, I had the Strawberry Cheesecake. It was sooo yummy and AWESOMENESS!! :D  The service was good, he kept checking up on us. The only thing we didn't like was the tea. My cousin ordered regular iced tea and got passion-peach tea and it was NOT good!! *blech*  But other than that, it was a great place and I'd definatly go back!"
Maria M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,4,,4.0,11/11/2012,"I love this place!!!  If there's a special occasion and I can pick the place, this is it!!!!!  I love the cheesy buffalo chicken tenders appetizer and the asian chicken wraps!!!  The portions are huge and priced right."
Peter Y.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,4,,4.0,8/13/2010,"Excellent food, but have to wait a little wile.  Food come in big portion that I can only eat half of it."
Stefania S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,11,1,4.0,10/13/2009,Great menu. Very diverse with lots of options. Service is above average. I eat here every day for lunch! We always leave happy.
Imran M.,"Phoenix, AZ",19,128,3,4.0,7/8/2006,"I like Cheesecake Factory. I like the consistency in the food.  You know what to expect and you know its going to be good. Wide variety of food ranging from the usual burgers and pizzas to asian and mexican cusine . The cashew chicken is the bomb though I love the Crispy Chicken sandwich with the Buffalo sauce. The tons of fun burger is another favorite. Dessert is, what else cheesecake and more cheesecake though they have 30 or more different types of cheesecake and other types of dessert too. Wait times can run up to an hour or even more on weekends. But you do have the Chandler Fashion Square next door where you can kill some time. Service is usually excellent and you can be sure you will be well looked after."
Khalid A.,"Tempe, AZ",0,2,,5.0,4/24/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant is a great place to have a quick meal as there is a large collection of meals to suit every customer's tastes. The restaurant claims it serves gluten and sugar free options. One can place an order and then walk around to do some excellent shopping. I had the privilege of sampling Mexican cuisine and did not regret the option. The orders are served unbelievably quickly while still very hot. The restaurant gives revelers sugar free cheesecakes with some strawberries. The floors are meticulously clean, an attestation to the efforts the management puts into cleanliness. The prices are incredibly decent for a restaurant of this quality and fame. Customers are assured of quick and friendly service from the ever-smiling members of staff. The restaurant serves amazingly huge parts and customers can request take out boxes if they feel like doing so. It is a very popular restaurant and so a visitor might have to wait a bit longer on set days. Nevertheless, no one wants to dine at an unpopular place"
Kelly C.,"Mesa, AZ",52,153,27,2.0,2/26/2011,"We met some friends there, there were 4 of us all together.  I ordered a Navajo chicken sandwich.  My daughter ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and my friends ordered an Asian chicken salad and a chicken salad sandwich.  20 minutes later, my friends got their food.  And I wait and i wait, and finally 5 minutes later Megan and I got ours.  So we finally begin to eat.  The food was just okay, didn't really taste like much of anything.  Megan said her cheeseburger was ok.  Megan and I also both got a margarita, and for  $8.00 you get about 6 ounces of drink, and that's frozen margaritas, not on the rocks.  Glasses are TINY and the drink was not anywhere near good.   Certainly not worth $8.00.  Restaurant is so noisy you have to  yell across the table to hear anyone, and at night they dim the lights so low you have to really focus on the menu or you can't read it.    All in all a pretty bad experience.   The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the cheesecake is pretty good.  $8 for a slice, definitely not worth that, but it tastes good.  I won't be going back and if you don't go either, there's no doubt you have made the right choice."
Alie C.,"Santa Clara, CA",576,683,14,3.0,10/6/2010,"I was disappointed in my trip here tonight. We went for my friend's birthday. The place was completely empty when we got there around 9pm, yet we still had to wait for a table which was strange. Our server was cute and friendly but he failed me in a couple other ways. First, I started off with an iced tea and then decided later on in the meal that I wanted to try the strawberry lemonade like my friend did and he charged me for both drinks. I work at a restaurant and I would NEVER do that to a customer, unless it was an alcoholic beverage of course. Second, I ordered the fish tacos (big surprise I know) and was disappointed. He didn't ask me if I wanted the fish grilled or fried (I wanted fried) so when I got them and they had grilled fish i wasn't happy. Plus the cheese in the tacos was so overpowering that I couldn't even taste the fish. I wish I could give this place a better review but those two things kind of ruined the experience for me."
Anthony C.,"Chandler, AZ",1,9,,5.0,6/3/2011,"This is a great Cheesecake Factory, pretty much all of them are  great but this location is particularly nice. The staff is friendly and experienced. I would say I average coming to this restaurant three times a month. If she is working we try to sit in Jessica's section, she always takes care of us! We also do take-out often and the service is equally impressive. Like I said above, this is a great location. HIGHLY recommend!"
Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",124,506,,4.0,8/28/2010,gotta love cheesecake factory! came here for dinner with my roomie and we were not disappointed. got seated right away. service was good although our servers nice attitude seemed a bit forced. i had the tuna tataki salad which was great and the dutch apple streusal cheesecake. the cheesecake was the perfect mix of sweets. mmmm so good.
Casey S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,27,,3.0,2/25/2010,"I kind of have mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory. On one hand, I love the ambience of the restaurant and the waiters are always nice and friendly, it's also my favorite place to get cheese pizza. On the other hand, the portion sizes and the caloric values of their food is kind of ridiculous. I mean, 1500+ calories for a piece of carrot cake? Is it really necessary to make it that fattening? I now try to avoid eating here since their meals are too high in calories and too addictive, like the majority of restaurants are nowadays."
