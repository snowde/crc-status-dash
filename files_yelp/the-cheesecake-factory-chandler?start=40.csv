Jewel I.,"Chandler, AZ",0,3,,3.0,10/23/2017,"I came here for a good family dinner experience, and it was good enough. I sat down, took my order, but it took forever! I honestly couldn't believe that it took 45 minutes to prepare my meal. The food was pretty decent, but the atmosphere was astonishing. I wouldn't really fully recommend this place to anyone, but it isn't bad!"
Pratishruti M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",273,200,1263,3.0,2/29/2016,"This Cheesecake factory is in chandler fashion center on chandler blvd, being in a mall it's always pretty crowded.We went in for an early dinner around 5:30 the place was packed but we got a table pretty quickly (it generally takes more time if you're specific about what section you want to be seated in). We ordered the  ~Typhoon punch (raspberry vodka with pineapple,passion fruit and orange juice) $10.50 ~Lemon drop (citrus and fresh lemonade) $3.95 ~Crispy crab bites (little crab cakes/balls served with a mustard sauce) $7.50 ~Dynamite shrimp (crispy tempura battered shrimp with a spicy sauce) $6.95 The drinks were very refreshing,they have four variations of lemonade and they make them quite well.I was not a fan of the mustard sauce.The portions are small for appetizers.They also serve bread (sourdough/wheat) at the table.Service was slow. Cheers!"
Christina A.,"Mesa, AZ",22,8,,2.0,4/8/2017,"We went to the Chandler location for my daughter's birthday dinner. We were told it would about a 45 minute wait. We waited an hour and 20 minutes. The hostess rolled her eyes when we asked how much longer after an hour. She made it clear we were bothering her. We always loved this chain where we used to live and we were craving some of our favorite dishes. The server was great and the food was the same but, the experience was not very positive. The server did his best to make up for the wait and hostess and we were grateful. Just don't think we will be frequenting this location."
Tandy E.,"Phoenix, AZ",602,70,59,4.0,4/30/2017,"We've been here a lot over the years. The food is always good. The service varies but overall it's good. The waiter we've had the last 2 times was slacking off on the job, got an order wrong and we had to flag down other servers for straws and water. Most of the time, our service is terrific.   Our favorite food includes the wontons, sweet corn tamale cakes, chicken and biscuits, orange chicken, shrimp pasta, shrimp BLT club (off menu), and of course cheesecake."
Mia N O C.,"Chandler, AZ",47,16,1,1.0,5/24/2017,"I've never waited for food for 2 hours.  I walked into CF at 6:30, sat down at 7:15, waited till 7:45 to give my order, and at 9 my food finally came out...one plate at a time, so while we wait for everyone to get their food to eat, we have cold food.  And what about the manager, we complained and he put his tail between his legs to check, but obviously not trained enough to come to us and apologize or offer anything to make the situation better.  UNACCEPTABLE!  Sorry we won't be back!"
Morgan T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",309,174,90,4.0,8/26/2016,"Despite the fact that it's a chain, I loved this place! I sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon and ordered a ""lunch"" salmon at 4pm for $14.95. It came with large asparagus, a heap of mashed potatoes, and a huge filet of salmon. Definitely a $25 meal anywhere else. I'll definitely be back for lunch again here soon. The portions are gigantic and enabled me to have enough leftovers for a second meal. They also have a skinny cocktail list that is a nice touch.  The menu is very conscious of vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free eaters. They have many suggestions for substitutions already printed on the menu."
Missy R.,"Tempe, AZ",564,191,404,3.0,1/9/2017,"This is not my first time here and usually not my first pick of where to dine. (I prefer to support local business). We came here to use a gift card we got for Christmas.  It's always very clean and tidy. We were greeted with a friendly hostess and didn't  have to wait too long.  If you have aged eyes as I do, bring reading glasses and a light! It's dim in this place. I could hardly read the menu without assistance. Lol I ordered a 'slimilicious' veggie salad. It sounded good, however, it had very little flavor. I had to dress it with the light salad dressing, that came on the side, just to add flavor.  It was bland. I've definitely had better. If they had grilled the veggies it would have moved it up a notch. It was boring to my tastebuds.  My friend ordered the nachos and I will say they were pretty good. They were toasted before serving, making them very crispy and yummy.   The restroom was relatively clean and stalls were private and well supplied.  I'm sure I'll return though I do wish they'd come up with a gluten free low fat/sugar cheesecake. Then again......I guess cheesecake should be a deviliscious temptation"
Margo L.,"Tempe, AZ",121,28,1,4.0,9/15/2017,"Kind of surprised to see so many negative reviews. My boyfriend and I frequent this location. Sure it can be busy at times, but our servers have always been friendly and attentive. Food has consistently been good each visit, aside from the last time when my Alfredo sauce on my pasta was a little watery. Was not too stoked on that, but I enjoyed my meal regardless. Bread is always good, and the new celebration cheesecake is a must try to anyone contemplating ordering it. I will say that it is more cake-like, but I'm not a huge fan of really heavy Cheesecake so I personally enjoyed it."
Angel P.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,5.0,3/29/2017,"John Nagy is the best! He knows how to make a crowd speak to each other! If your in town for a night or two stop bye, he will be on the bar side, you are guaranteed to leave with a few laughs and possibly meet new acquaintances.   John is the reason most frequent, with his outstanding service, attention to detail, a smile on his face ready to greet, you can't go wrong if your looking for great conversation and an unexpected pleasant evening.  Stop bye, the food and drinks are a bonus!  ""You are the best John!"""
LuAnn S.,"Spearfish, SD",0,3,1,5.0,5/29/2017,"Stopped here for an ice cold Blue Moon and dinner! We had the small plates, enjoying Asian lettuce tacos and Spring Rolls. They were delicious! We followed with coffee and banana cream cheesecake... hard to choose, but this one was in my top 3 at Cheesecake Factory!!"
Saskia B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",37,96,385,1.0,2/9/2017,"Birthday luncheon for party of 6. We waited 15mins.  We have balloons with *happy birthday* printed on them. Our server asked what we're celebrating, and who's the lucky one. Our server neglected to provide us flatwares. We had to flag her several times to place our orders, refills, and for a complimentary sweet treat for the birthday celebrant. The food was pricey with the portions we were given. The food was also room temperature by the time we received it.  And no complimentary birthday sweet treat.  Never returning to this restaurant again. Ever! Over priced, and lack-luster service."
Tanya S.,"Chandler, AZ",12,1,,1.0,10/3/2017,"Worst service ever. We will never go back and I will tell everyone not to go. Last time we went it was the same thing but figured we'd try again. First, the draft was broken so no draft beers. Then took forever to take our orders. We waited over an hour for part of the food to arrive. The manager comes out and says they are behind in the kitchen, no kidding. They bring 2 of the 5 orders, not even the he kids food. The potatos were cold, not even warm. We finally gave up and left after about 5 minutes and the other 3 plates never came out. Never ever again."
Steven S.,"Mesa, AZ",4,64,166,3.0,2/15/2017,Went here for Valentine's Day. It was way over crowded and the service was mediocre. And to top it off I think the cheesecake slices have shrunk.
Kimberly O.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,23,26,4.0,4/9/2017,"I always have a great time at this Cheesecake Factory. Only thing was the seating this time, I felt the lighting was terrible, like I was in an interrogation room. Our waiter had great recommendations and was polite. The food was good and perfect for Friday date night. I had the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus. It also had a light cream sauce that was lemony that added an extra kick to the dish. I will l keep returning this location for great food and customer service."
Anne R.,"Hercules, CA",5000,829,322,3.0,6/9/2017,"Normally I am a fan of eating here but after this visit I may have to rethink that. We arrived here later in the day, close to closing time. We were seated outside to enjoy the nice AZ night heat which was great. Our server came out and was great all throughout the night! Our food however was not so great. Let me just say that our peach Balinis were the only good thing about the meal. We ordered appetizers which were spicier than usual. So we didn't even finish those. Our food, we ordered a fish plate, the fish was super dry and lacked taste which was disappointing. We only ate about a third of it because it was so bad. We did order a slice of cheesecake for dessert which was on point (as it should be). Overall the experience was not great but I rate it 3 stars for the awesome service and good drinks and cheesecake! But I probably won't be back again due to the lack of flavor in the food."
Wesley E.,"Chandler, AZ",43,5,,1.0,7/30/2017,Pretty pathetic experience.  Definitely not happy with my melted glob of what used to approximate cheesecake.  If you're going to make people wait for a half hour for their cheesecake on a call-in order maybe you could leave it in the cooler.
Elise S.,"Mesa, AZ",80,1,,1.0,7/25/2017,My fiance and I ordered cheesecake factory through door dash. I ordered the Evelyns favorite pasta. When I went in for my second bite I noticed a long black hair in my food. So disgusting. I called cheesecake factory to let them know and they said they couldn't do anything for me because I ordered through door dash. A hair in my food is not a result of door dash. It's a result of improper hygiene in their kitchen. I will not be ordering cheesecake factory again after the experience I had. Terrible customer service.
DavidJames S.,"Gilbert, AZ",56,26,16,5.0,8/19/2017,This is a great place to eat the service is great and pleasant. Always look forward to come here.
Russell F.,"Vail, AZ",3,43,17,3.0,8/14/2017,"Typical CF, the acoustics are bad especially when busy. It's hard to have a conversation. Service was slow, but food was good. New birthday cake cheesecake was awesome!"
Benedetto T.,"Gilbert, AZ",90,31,13,2.0,5/4/2016,"I heard the food was supposed to be really good. But unfortunately the food for the price we paid was not good.  It seemed like the cooks didn't know how to use the spices correctly with the pastas because the Louisiana chicken pasta that I ordered didn't have much flavor to it, but the chicken was good. 3 star pasta The burger was undercooked. My friend said he would take the Whataburger burger over the burger he ordered at the Cheesecake Factory. 2 star burger  The only thing that tasted for what we paid for was the filet mignon. 4 star filet  We also had eggplants which were really good and they came with a side dish of pasta with pesto which was completely tasteless. Probably the worst pasta I have ever tried anywhere. It was almost like eating pasta with water. The manager came over replacing the pasta with a pasta Alfredo which was excellent. 3 star eggplant Our server was very young and very tall, he said he turned 21 just 2 weeks ago. He started off really bad and didn't even smile. Later on it got better. We gave him a hard time ordering which he handled pretty good but kept forgetting somethings and misunderstood some other things. 3 star service. So it's a little bit but it miss with how good your food was. Except for the burger.  I would say let the Cheesecake Factory keep on making cheese cakes and not full restaurant menus. For me the first and last time eating out here.  Also one thing that raised my concern was that my friend saw one of the cooks spit to his side. We couldn't see if he spit on the food or on the floor or he just had a gum in his mouth. Ether way, I don't believe you should ever spit anywhere when you handle the food."
