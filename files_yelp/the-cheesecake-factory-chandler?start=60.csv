Vladmir T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1249,833,1375,3.0,5/5/2016,"Cheesecake Factory Regular, but... We are regulars at many locations... The grande burrito is my go to usually and is actually quite wonderful with the secret sauce.  I would give most locations 4-5 stars but for whatever reason both my visits to this location shared the same experience of drier than normal food with almost non of that wonderful secret sauce.... These places are usually packed as this one was and that is fine. For some reason this location seemed so loud though that both times I left with a headache... I recommend the other locations above this one.... You have read why...."
Laura S.,"Chandler, AZ",87,51,1,2.0,10/28/2017,"I was recently in a rush getting ready for a party, so I ordered a cheesecake here for curbside pickup, thinking I could save some time. I called when I arrived and was greeted right away, but then I waited 15 minutes for them to bring the cheesecake out. When I got home, the cheesecake was still frozen. It tasted fine once it thawed, but I can buy a much better cheesecake from Costco that is twice as big for half the price. $30 for a frozen 7"" cheesecake was definitely not worth it, especially since the convenience factor was eliminated."
Silence D.,"Mesa, AZ",0,73,6,1.0,8/13/2017,"While I can understand a busy night, I can't understand when I spend 100 dollars just on drinks and am waiting 45 minutes for chewy pasta.  Both dishes came out way too long under the lamp, all the pasta was chewy and I was to wait longer to remake it?  No thanks. The one bartender was very nice and courteous, but the other  messed up 2 of my drinks and never noticed.  Over all, a poor experience."
Erica T.,"Mesa, AZ",103,2,1,5.0,3/4/2017,"We had such a great time tonight! Our waiter Will was SO great! Our food and dessert was fabulous! The management team was amazing!

Tiffany M.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"I've been to cheesecake factory many time but tonight's experience was awful. It started out fine long wait for dinner with large party. Amazing server Drew was very upbeat and sweet, kept up with all of our drinks and was able to get all meals right. Once meals were tasted is where things went south. The pasta was awful and tasted like buttery noodles. No seasoning was on them or garlic flavor whatsoever. Some of us had this issue (4) of us out of the large party. We weren't going to complain because we have all worked service and it was not the waiters fault. But once something was said an incompetent old woman came to the table to let us know it was suppose to taste like butter. Which we all have had this dish before we are not children yet she only conversated for a moment never acknowledging that there was something wrong with the dish only trying to convince us that it's suppose to taste awful like that. Save your money people don't eat here. Not worth it at all!"
Heather S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,3,,1.0,8/4/2017,"I don't know why I keep coming back here, I guess I think it will be different the next time. I always get the waiter that doesn't care about being there. This last time we had to ask for bread when all of the tables around us had some. Our food came out and my chicken tacos were cold, I sent them back and the manager came out and apologized. He said he would make sure they came out piping hot. After waiting the entire meal for my new tacos to come out, they brought out the same tacos that had obviously just been put under a heat lamp. They had the same bite I had taken when I sent them back. When I complained again, they took it off the bill and avoided our table for the rest of the night except to take the bill. I wish the health inspector would have been there! I am so disgusted, I will never be back. I wish I could give a zero star rating."
Anthony G.,"Chandler, AZ",179,13,4,2.0,3/25/2017,"Long wait to be seated. Too dark to see, had to ask for the bread. It took 48 minutes to receive the food. They brought Out The Main Dish Without The side. Food was not great. Used to like it, but not worth the time."
Bor B.,"Chandler, AZ",1,17,50,5.0,6/18/2017,"Good place with a huge variety in the menus. Convenient location, friendly stuff. Foods are great. The only not so good is that they almost always are busy so be ready to wait."
Denise D.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,21,14,4.0,5/12/2017,"Recently ate here, great service. I wish I could remember my server. We were there late Tuesday. Our server was female. She gave us a good tip about the salted caramel cheese cake; it was dope. They have the best deserts and drinks."
Paula M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,17,,2.0,6/22/2017,Very disappointed and frustrated with the service and quality of the food.  Our waitress was very inefficient bringing bread and refills took forever.  Our food came out an hour after we ordered it.  One entree at a time and two of the orders were wrong and it took forever to replace them.  My chopped salad wasn't fresh but okay.  The Alfredo fettuccine only had butter without any sauce.  Maybe instead of having such an extensive menu they should concentrate on making good quality food.  Our table never got cleared of dirty dishes. This is the second time having such a terrible dining experience here. I thought the first time we had a bad experience was a fluke but apparently not.  The manager did comp our deserts and the Cheesecake was wonderful but not enough to go back for lunch or dinner again.  With all the exceptional Restaurants in the valley next time I will choose one that has good quality food and service.
Bonnie H.,"Chandler, AZ",0,1,,3.0,7/22/2017,Food is good but the service was BAD! There were five of us and our food came out in three different deliveries instead of one. Four of us were finished with our meal before the 5th person even got his food! I think the worst part was nobody offered to comp his meal or even a dessert. And then we waited 30 minutes for our cheesecake! Wont be going back anytime soon!
Eddie K.,"Chandler, AZ",3,52,48,3.0,9/26/2017,"As the name states, they serve a lot of cheesecake. We showed up for dessert at about 8pm on a Monday night, it was pretty empty and only a few tables. There was a nice glass case with all the different cheesecakes available, so it was nice to be able to see what were ordering before we actually ordered it. We shared a White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. The crust of the cheesecake was a black cookie crust and was very good. The cheesecake came with two large  mountains of whipped cream, probably way too much whipped cream any person should eat in one sitting. Regardless it was a chill atmosphere, and the dessert was good. The whole place has soft music playing but feels very loud and is hard to talk while in there, not sure if it was the 3 other tables of people or just the architectural design of the place producing a lot of echo/feedback. I knocked it down a few stars for the service. Server did not come around often (or at all), had to get her attention before she would come take our order and again to get our check. Our drinks were empty and didn't get refilled. Overall, good cheesecake, bad service. No comment on the food."
A.M. S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,81,91,5.0,6/18/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is always one of our go to places to eat. Always great quality and friendly staff. Love love the Baja Chicken Tacos, Cajun jumbolia, sweet tamale corn cakes, and stuffed chicken tortillas to name a few!"
艺莹,"Tempe, AZ",22,2,5,1.0,4/1/2017,"That chicken and shrimp pasted  taste super bad, I don't know why so many people Oder that paster , super bad:(,  we waited for 40 minutes for the food, and there are many noodles inside and all the stuff no flavor ! No flavor! No flavor!  Never want to eat here !"
K A.,"Chandler, AZ",11,9,3,1.0,8/7/2016,I am still waiting for my gift card with the refunded amount that I still haven't gotten by mail for over 2 weeks. I called the manager the next day and she assured me this would happen and it hasn't. Just more broken promises. I still have my receipt and if sending me a gift card was a lie then I want my money back! You saw the condition of my food. Enough said.
Jacqueline V.,"Phoenix, AZ",77,123,93,5.0,4/25/2017,"We always have a great time here.  Good food,  good service.  We have tried many menu items, never has a bad experience here.  We usually go later at night, but have been there art busy lunch times as well.  Always consistent service."
Enrique H.,"Tempe, AZ",8,10,1,1.0,2/22/2017,Worst customer service ever! If my wife didn't like the cheesecake I would never go. Waited in the cheesecake counter for 10 min with 4 waiters standing at the side before being acknowledged. The. Took another 10 minutes to take my order and box some cheesecake. This place deserves a negative rating!
Michele P.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,8,,1.0,3/15/2017,"We go here a couple times a year and always for my sons birthday,  as this is his favorite place. We were in there Sunday, March 12, 2017. Service was awesome but I was the lucky one who got food poisoning. I have never been so sick in my entire life. I ordered the Avacado Egg Rolls. I order these every time I come here. Tasted fine but the aftermath was horrible. At this time I can honestly say I can't imagine a return."
PrincessCandyEmpire S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4665,101,3192,5.0,12/25/2015,"THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY MY OPINION FROM MY EXPERIENCE: I'm not a huge fan of reviewing store chains, especially restaurant chains.  When I'm writing a review, I want to make sure I am adding something unique, that perhaps someone didn't already know. Since chains are everywhere, everyone has already tried them so chain reviews usually basically come down to rehashing information we all already know or become a report card on what we thought of the service. It's easy to look down on chains or take them for granted because they're probably run by a giant faceless corporation or some big fat cat.  One of the notable exceptions is The Cheesecake Factory.  The Cheesecake Factory started in 1978 from an idea that a son of a baker couple had to showcase his mother's cheesecakes, as well as to add a restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory has a certain je ne sais quoi quality and is impressively successful operating on such a grand scale.  What do I mean? The decor.  The Cheesecake Factory is stunning and huge. There is the main dinning room, the bar and bakery areas. Each could conceivably operate on their own. The high ceilings with all the art work is pretty amazing. The craftsmanship of the bar is gorgeous. The whole restaurant is very well appointed. (see pics) The menu.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is massive. Not just in the quantity of items, but the scope as well.  The menu features: Appetizers/Small Plates/Snacks Salads Pizza  Glamburgers/Sandwiches Pastas Steaks/Chops/Fish/Seafood Eggs/Omelettes There are 2 new sections: ""Super"" Foods & Skinnylicious ""Super"" Foods are nutrient rich special recipes with high sources of antioxidants.  Some of these include: Falafel Salad Super Antioxidant Salad Vegan Cobb Salad Kale & Quinoa Salad Skinnylicious are a collection of fresh & delicious menu options all at 590 calories or less.  Obviously, desserts include cheesecake.  Like ALL the cheesecakes ever invented! Drink menu is extensive & creative.  The Service.  The Cheesecake Factory has a pretty consistent high level of service. Occasionally, there is a surly server, but it is rare.  The Hours: 11am - 12am Extras: Catering Gift Cards Ship A Cheesecake Now think of all of those things I listed and multiply by 5 Phoenix Valley locations.  (Chandler, Mesa, Biltmore, Kierland, & Peoria) To have 5 massive restaurants all in the same city (over 200 locations total) and to be as successful as they are, for as long as they have been, is impressive and rare.  The ability to just stop in to an epic environment with constantly high level & varied products and excellent service is beyond impressive, which unfortunately can be taken for granted.  For more information: I 5/5 highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory!"
