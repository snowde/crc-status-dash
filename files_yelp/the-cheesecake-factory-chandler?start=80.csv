Amber L.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,3,,1.0,1/21/2017,"This was the worst experience I've had in a long time. Came during lunch and it was not yet the lunch rush. Ordered my food that came out wrong.  Had to wait for it to be re-made and when it was it was too greasy to eat.  Once I received my bill, I get charged for a drink that was never ordered.  Overall a bad experience and will not return to this location."
Sean C.,"Chandler, AZ",0,6,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Wow, what a disappointing experience. In fact, the second one in a row at this location. Our food took almost an hour, did not come out all together, and two of the dishes were missing their sides. My fries came out five minutes later than the rest of my meal and my daughter still did not have her mashed potatoes, already finished with the rest of her food. The icing on the cake was the charge for the side of mashed potatoes which were in fact just a substitution for rice. My drink was empty most of the time. I had to bring this to the manager's attention and she was kind enough to take off the charge for the side of mashed potatoes which was not a side and did comp one appetizer."
Taylor H.,"Gilbert, AZ",241,50,62,2.0,7/1/2016,"This location is completely hit or miss. Both food and service are extremely inconsistent compared to other locations.  We have dined here multiple times, one being last night (6/30/2016) about 90 minutes before closing. My husband ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and was served the Chicken Carbonara. He received the correct dish after I finished eating. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles, which were over-fried. The mashed potatoes were reheated so badly that they were glued to the plate. At that point, I didn't even have the energy to complain about my meal since we already had to send my husband's order back since it was incorrect.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and will definitely return to other locations, but this one is comparable to a glorified Chili's. UPDATE 7/29 (over a month later): I have reached out to this location twice regarding this recent visit and haven't gotten a response."
Kimberlee J.,"Chandler, AZ",69,2,,1.0,5/24/2017,"I was in the same group with Mia n O who commented this. ""I've never waited for food for 2 hours.  I walked into CF at 6:30, sat down at 7:15, waited till 7:45 to give my order, and at 9 my food finally came out...one plate at a time, so while we wait for everyone to get their food to eat, we have cold food.  And what about the manager, we complained and he put his tail between his legs to check, but obviously not trained enough to come to us and apologize or offer anything to make the situation better.  UNACCEPTABLE!  Sorry we won't be back!"" I think the worse part though was the lack of caring that your customers were displeased.  I understand things getting busy or overloaded,  but there was no concern after we mentioned something other than by or server who was trying to help and show empathy.  He was the only saving grace."
Chris H.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,59,102,5.0,4/9/2017,"Always a good, reliable and consistent restaurant.  Lots of great options.  We are trying to eat better and we're worried we wouldn't be able to find anything, but they had a huge ""skinny"" menu with lots of great choices.  I had the Tuscan Chicken and it was really good.  We will be back."
Rob L.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,3,,4.0,5/8/2017,"Last month we went to this location for my 18th birthday party. To start off a good night, our waiter was extremely friendly and outgoing. He cracked jokes along with him and did a very good job throughout the night. He appropriately checked up on us and made sure our glasses were never empty. The food was very good as well, and the portions were worth the money! The best part about is was that the waiter asked if I wanted happy birthday sung to me. I wasn't scared out of my wits when a sudden horde of waiters and waitresses sprung up on my family to sing to me. The cheese cake was decorated with a cute birthday message and was large enough for all three of us to share. We had a wonderful experience and would happily go back on our next occasion! (Written by daughter)"
Cindy R.,"Tempe, AZ",2,51,1,2.0,8/1/2016,"I'm a little bummbed, I ate there last night with my fiance. We usually go to the cheesecake factory in scottsdale but this one is closer to our home. This location was really cold, I understand it summer but the ac was blasting! Now I'm not giving this place a 2 star because of that, my food was just not good. I ordered the white chili chicken, it sounded good to me so I wanted to try it. The waitress came with our food (she was really nice and her service was great). My food came out cold and not very good. The chili was mush with a little bit of rice, some beans, and chicken. I would have asked the waitress if I could get my food reheated but I was starving so I ate it anyways.  Not the best experience but we will stick to our normal location."
DM C.,"Chandler, AZ",1,99,5,5.0,3/19/2017,"Fantastic! How can a restaurant have fish tacos, pizza and herb lemon chicken and they all rock??? Definitely a fan. Plan to spend 10-15 mins on the huge menu. So worth it. Btw brunch is amazing here."
Neslyn J.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,4,4,5.0,10/9/2016,Had the miso salmon and love it and husband had the fish and chips and it was delish!!! Our server Ashley was amazing!!!!
Jean P.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,29,,1.0,8/14/2017,"The food is good here but the service is horrible. Went at 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was not busy. The waiter (Albert) got our drink order wrong, delivered the appetizer with the meal and then gave everyone the wrong food. We were a party of 3 so there is really no excuse for not remembering who ordered what item.  The appetizer was very cold and had obviously been sitting for awhile.  Horrible, horrible service."
Leonard U.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,14,,1.0,4/1/2017,Worst place to eat in Arizona. Service is terrible. Salads look like they came from the back of my refrigerator.  This was once a great place but it's gone downhill so far we will never go back.   We ate outside on our last visit. 30 minutes to get water. 45 to order. We're still here 1 hour and 25 minutes and still waiting for cheese cake. The waiters keep turning the heat off and we are FREEZING.  Don't go here.  McDonald's will be much better and far cheaper.  What a DUMP.
James C.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,21,,1.0,12/22/2016,This was one of my daughters favorite restaurants for a long time. Unfortunately the wait times AND Slow service started changing that.  The last time we went it was the slowest service ever and we both got sick from the food.  We now avoid all locations unfortunately because every time we see the place we remember how sick we were AND how poor the service was.  Such a shame because at one time it was great!
Mike S.,"Medford, OR",0,27,,1.0,2/2/2017,"OK... You go to Cheesecake for the broad menu and maybe a slice of cheesecake. The service is typically good, however our experience here was horrible. Each of the special order requests (dressing on the side etc.) were not honored and there was no offer to remedy that. I literally had to put my hands around my mouth (you know... yell style) and almost yell to get our servers attention after she walked past us 3x without checking on us. We had asked for water and hadn't received it after being sat for 10 minutes. I eventually had to walk up to the hostesses to ask them to track our server down. Checked on Yelp after we ate and laughed... 3 out of 5 stars for a Cheesecake Factory? I wonder if this place is under corporate watch for improvement? Very unimpressed, there are many other better options. Steer clear!"
Martin R.,"Phoenix, AZ",45,7,2,1.0,6/19/2016,Ordered the salmon combo with shrimp scampi for 22 dollars. This has got to be the smallest piece of salmon I've ever received
Chelsea W.,"Chandler, AZ",129,67,48,5.0,1/14/2017,So delicious! The menu is huge with many many food options. I got the Bang bang chicken and shrimp and it was full of flavor. For desert I got the red velvet cheesecake and it was seriously one of the best slices of cheesecake I had ever had! Highly recommend that type of cheesecake here! Can't wait to go again and try something else on the menu!
Roxanne W.,"Mesa, AZ",0,12,,5.0,2/12/2017,"Celebrated a birthday with about 18 guests. We had two servers that did not flinch at the size of our party! They were courteous, kind and provided excellent service! I would highly recommend this location for the food, the servers and the amazing service!"
Heather B.,"Mesa, AZ",64,27,,1.0,11/17/2016,"I'm so disappointed in this location. My fiancée and I came here for our anniversary and was told their was a wait. So she took down our name and told me it would be 15 mins. We waited and waited and waited. Almost an hour goes by and the place did not seem that packed to me so I went to the desk and asked a lady up there and she said oh, I forgot about you. She then said let me get you seated. Well, the waitress was not friendly AT ALL and took our order. The food was cold and when I tried to speak to the waitress she didn't care and sat down our bill. We left upset and paid $50 for a cold dinner."
Tara T.,"Mesa, AZ",0,11,1,5.0,2/8/2017,"Been here 50 times since I live down the street and only dissapointed once from the nachos, but that was my fault but everything else is amazzing"
Kevin I.,"Tempe, AZ",2,27,17,4.0,7/2/2017,"I'm not big on the large commercial restaurants but I like to give credit where credit is due. Cheese cake factory is a step above the other box restaurants. The sheer variety of cuisines they offer is a kitchen marvel. The quality to price is fair. Service is usually held to a standard far above the price point. And of course, the cheese cake is to die for."
Kenny U.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,5,,1.0,7/12/2017,I've had Cheesecake Factory numerous times but this is the first at this location. HORRIBLE! I first wallK in and I'm not even greeted. The hostess doesn't even acknowledge me and continues to do what ever she was doing. After what seemed to be a minute (just as I was going to walk out) she finally looks up and doesnt say a word! Mute are we?! I have to initiate the conversation. My server was nice but i think she forgot about me once my food came out but no worries. I dont need the attention. As for the food... UGH! Horrible. Ordered the carbonara with chicken and it was bland! The noodles were soggy and the chicken was boiled and was dry. I probably used a tablespoon of salt just to add flavor. The table next to me had his server take his dish back. He ordered a pasta dish and it had no sauce! It had that look when the noodles sit out of the water for to long look. I'm not knocking Cheesecake Factory... just this location. AVOID IF YOU CAN!
