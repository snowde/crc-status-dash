J G.,"Summerville, SC",98,395,105,4.0,10/22/2017,"Pretty cool spot. The layout is amazing and the staff was polite. The food was fresh and fun. The Hot Chocolate my son got was great, but my pasta meal blew it away. The Stuffed Garlic mushrooms are OK, but still priced well at right below $7.  The Cheesecake we got for the ride home, didn't make it far. As always in Charlotte great diverse Staff and Customers...both important"
Elyse S.,"Indian Land, SC",0,5,,2.0,1/7/2018,"Last night, I had a 3 hour wait. I would never, ever wait three hours to eat anywhere were it not my granddaughter's birthday wish to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday. Upon getting ""beeped"" I approached the front counter where I was confronted with YOUR POLICY that made YOUR HOSTESS RUDE. She informed me that ""policy"" said we could not be seated because all 6 of us were not there. Two were at the bar closing out our check and one was in the mall because as a 73 year old, he needed to sit. YOU do not have anywhere near the seating needed for waiting guests. Are you kidding? Do you really expect everyone to be there immediately upon beeping after three long hours? My lord, I wonder why the fire marshals have not ordered you to clear the doorway of scores of people waiting to be seated. Your food staff had huge difficulty navigating the immense crowd. Think guest safety. When Saturday night crowds are big and it is 10 degrees outside, perhaps you can isolate a better waiting area. Everything about The Cheesecake Factory gets high marks but not your corporate policies or customer accommodation  (therefore the 2 stars as an average for food vs. ""policy""). It is a very selfish attitude that causes customer-staff friction and it is needless. Yes, it spoiled our meals and left a sour taste that even you cheesecake can not remove."
Elise W.,"Charlotte, NC",89,164,26,1.0,11/21/2017,"Literally one of the worst Cheesecake experiences I have ever had in America or abroad. You expect consistency and at least passable quality when going to a chain establishment, but not the case here at this location. Wednesday night last week stopped in for a late dinner (9PM) after a long day. The server was great very attentive, but unfortunately the same couldn't be said about the kitchen. Ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps  and my friend ordered a burger - one hour in an empty restaurant to grill some chicken - and plate it with lettuce. Kind of crazy, no apology from the waiter on the wait.  Food finally came out - there were three chicken pieces on the plate - 3 about the size of two of my fingers side by side. - $14 for that? Sauce was missing from the plate and the lettuce was rotting. I wish I would have stopped to talk to a manager, but after a long day all I wanted was to eat and go home especially after an hour wait in a basically empty restaurant.  I really hope this location gets it together, because this experience has a previously loyal customer questioning future visits."
David H.,"Charlotte, NC",79,254,59,1.0,11/2/2017,"The food was better than expected but the other aspects were far worse. I got a decent parking spot so I was in a good mood for my dinner.  Appetizers came and we were so hungry we tucked into them and in no time they were gone.  More bread. The entree, I don't want you to continue reading.  Wait ten minutes staring at this sentence.  Wait ten more minutes staring at this sentence.  I bet you just kept reading.  I didn't have that option.  With a squad of hungry children flailing about we waited over forty minutes after the apps, and that is even longer than our order time, for our food. It took forever and our waiter avoided us most of that time.  It was excruciating with children flipping over complaining they are starving.  I was feeling the same way.  I made it through part of my meal and then I didn't feel well.  I wanted to pay and leave.  That took far longer and we had some bill errors that had to be fixed.  The entire thing took even longer.  I wasn't feeling well and the moment I got my credit card back I bolted for the door. Get your dessert here and you are fine.  Order an entree at your own risk.  I suggest Maggianos for drinks and food, and the factory for cake."
Tori H.,"Charlotte, NC",502,523,290,2.0,11/18/2017,I love CF but the Thai wraps we got tonight were not good. The chicken was a bit undercooked and mushy. It's disappointing when you have to wait so long to eat here and it's not cheap.  The cheesecake was amazing as usual.
Rebekah K.,"Charlotte, NC",121,81,181,4.0,9/28/2017,"The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory (besides all the Cheesecake) is that their menu is so expansive and there really is something for everyone to eat there. This was only my second time there but every time I have the hardest time picking out what to get because I want to pick more than one!  We started with Buffalo Blasts as an appetizer and they come with 8 giant pieces! I was shocked when I saw the amount! They're basically fried Buffalo chicken dip and man were they good! With all the food that was yet to come, we probably didn't need to get them, but I'm still glad we did.  My boyfriend and I each got a pasta dish which were very generous portions and both were very very good. My only complaint about the entire experience is that I could tell that my pasta was sitting out for a little while, so I guess we were waiting on my boyfriends meal before they could serve it to our table. It was still good and pasta is always a good leftover choice.  Of course we ended the meal with Cheesecake. We decided to split one and got the cookie dough cheesecake. It was so so so good. In the words of my boyfriend ""I'm glad I've had plain cheesecake before this or I would expect all Cheesecake to taste just like this"". It tasted exactly like cookie dough.  I would definitely come here again. It can definitely get pricy as their menu is so large and you just want everything, but maybe more frequent trips would make me feel like I can just pick one thing at a time!"
David B.,"Madison Park, Charlotte, NC",203,32,17,4.0,12/22/2017,I'm always ready for cheesecake! Mushroom burger never disappointed me my gf got four cheese pasta was delicious! John served us and he was very nice and fast! Love this place.
Davette M.,"Charlotte, NC",76,111,185,5.0,10/27/2017,It's always a treat to go and eat here. This past week I was there twice once for lunch and a early dinner. What I truly appreciate about this restaurant is the portion sizes are substantial no matter what time a day you decide to eat there. I've been there for brunch and still had left overs. Dinner was again exceptional!
Andrew A.,"Charlotte, NC",67,43,31,4.0,9/20/2017,"I had always seen The Cheesecake Factory at malls and never had a desire to have a go at it.  Though this passed week I was with family and they had so much good things to say about it, we decided on it for lunch.   The menu had just about everything you could imagine.  The family and I Had a wonderful meal, the food was excellent with  something for everyone.  There was a variety of choices to pick from and the portions were absolutely monstrous. The service was timely, well executed and gave us refills promptly.  We finished the meal with desert and man the cheesecake was outstanding.  If you are in the area and want a meal of what felt like an endless amount of food, you should give it a shot."
Court S.,"Greensboro, NC",104,34,55,3.0,6/10/2017,"For a first timer I must say I was overwhelmed. They had a wide array of choices on the menu. If you don't know exactly what you want you will be searching for awhile. I will say that the bread they served was GREAT and I could not get enough. I ended up ordering the Chicken Riesling. It was good, but it felt like it was missing additional seasoning in the sauce.  They are very generous with serving size, and I was able to take some home. Next time I go I will definitely have to try the cheesecake."
Christy D.,"Goose Creek, SC",1,38,39,5.0,11/26/2017,We are here from out of town and this is our 3rd visit to this restaurant and it is by far our favorite. I wish they had one in Charleston! Service was impeccable and our food was perfect. I definitely recommend the egg roll sampler for an appetizer. My husband was loving it! Our entrees were amazing and his steak cooked perfect. We got our cheese cake to go and ate at our hotel and we enjoyed every bite. I can't wait to go back!!!
Mirisha D.,"Charlotte, NC",0,8,12,1.0,1/2/2018,I will NEVER go back to this place as long as one of their servers still works there...... So rude and disrespectful! I contacted the corporate office to file a complaint. Absolutely NO ONE deserves to be treated the way I did on today.
Shay J.,"Charlotte, NC",134,227,389,4.0,2/3/2017,"Girls Night with my Niece.  The Cheesecake Factory was on her bucket list. Ever since she relocated to North Carolina that's all she's been talking about. I received two tickets to see ""The Space Between Us"" and decided to make the evening a girls night.  We grabbed dinner then had the most amazing cheesecake! We arrived around 5ish and sat near the bar. At first my niece was overwhelmed with the wide selection of cheesecake. She finally settled on the Oreo Cheesecake. I had the original with strawberries on top. Of course it was DELICIOUS!!!!  Our waitress Danielle was very patient and kind.  I've been to this location once before in college. My Mother Loves the food, I'm not a fan. Yes, the cheesecake is good, but the food lacks flavor. Maybe Im ordering the wrong thing. Of course I'm willing to try again for the sake of my niece. Our next adventure will be Brunch. Thank you to Danielle for giving my niece an unforgettable experience! She truly enjoyed every bite!"
Taylor S.,"Charlotte, NC",76,3,,4.0,12/31/2017,"The food and cheesecake are always great here, but the wait for everything is very long. Took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive. And 15 minutes for our waiter to bring the check to us. I also found something in my drink and had to get a new one."
Ken H.,"Matthews, NC",25,58,26,5.0,8/11/2017,"I have been to CF a number of times but I haven't been back in a while and I felt the need to write a review for my most recent visit. I had the pleasure of taking my entire family (wife and 5 children - 14, 10, 10, 7, 5) plus a 6 yo friend of my 7 yo daughter to eat at CF for my 7 year old's birthday dinner. I realize it was 7pm on a Wed night (not a weekend night), but it was still busy. So - it was crazy, to say the least - loud, annoying, yelling, constant battles between the boys, unnecessary comments and touching, eye rolls and sighs...you know the drill. But CF and my server were FANTASTIC and handled it all with serious grace and professionalism.  Look - the food at CF is good. Very good. Yes, the Factory Burrito is flippin huge and enough for an entire village to eat. Yes, their cheesecakes are absurdly large and delish. Yes, their menu is a bit overpriced, especially some of the kids' meals. But it is truly hard to complain due to the quality of the food. But my issues with CF in the past have almost entirely been about service. Not THIS time, however.  I got there early to get a table (b/c they still have that stupid ""no reservation"" rule, ugh). The Hostess was very nice and went out of her way to help, even making sure my name stayed at the top of the list while I waited for my family to arrive (2 cars). We were settled into a large, round booth-thing. ONE SERIOUS ISSUE - the booth's seat fabric was TERRIBLE. It was literally missing in multiple places with stuffing popping out. Unreal. It wasn't uncomfortable or anything, just VERY ugly and not what I expect for Southpark and the prices they charge. Anyway - our server was amazing. She was constantly there, getting constant refills for my camel-like kids, never getting upset about all the yelling and things being spilled. She got our food out ASAP and was always (somehow) happy to help us with the (stupidest) requests from my children (including needing crayons to color - which she somehow found - and paper). I honestly cannot say enough about her and the rest of the staff there. THANK YOU - it was so nice to be treated with such courtesy and respect even when busy in a huge restaurant with ""difficult"" patrons."
Liliana O.,"Matthews, NC",1,4,13,5.0,11/26/2017,Love this place!!!!! I ordered some wings without thinking to ask how they were cooked since I am allergic to shellfish. I realized after I had ordered my grilled fish tacos. The serve spoke to the manager and they took it off my bill. What made me love this place more besides the delicious food was that the manager (forgot his name) brought out my plate personally and stated it was totally shellfish free. I really appreciate the fact that he took the time to bring my plate out and acknowledge my special needs. We joked around and he was very nice and accommodating. He was awesome!  Now on to the food. I love coffee so I know good coffee when I taste it and their caramel macchiato was amazing. The fish tacos were really good and omg the Mac n chz are a must Have! I chose a simple fresh strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  Usually when a place says fresh I don't expect it to be really fresh. But the strawberries taste so fresh and sweet and it all went perfect with the cheesecake. I will definitely be going back very soon!
Jenita M.,"Lumberton, NC",89,412,1402,5.0,7/15/2017,I never order entree/etc at the Cheesecake Factory. Only cheesecakes.  I usually get waited on quickly and don't wait too long for my cheesecakes.  I haven't had a bad cheesecake yet.
Danielle W.,"Charlotte, NC",23,115,285,5.0,8/3/2017,"Visit date 7/30/17- that's the day they had cheesecake 50% off. The lines where crazy,  with 1 hour and 1/2  wait after your order your cheesecake. It was so busy with no standing space. A lot of ppl was waiting outside. I had the celebration cheesecake AND IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD, it's made with cake and cheesecake I WOULD WAIT AGAIN FOR 2 hours!! That's how good this cheesecake was!!"
Raymond S.,"Elliott, SC",0,2,,2.0,11/19/2017,Today was the first bad meal and customer service experience I've experienced at any cheesecake factory. I had my usual dish of cajun jumbalaya pasta and it was obvious my portions were reduced and the care taken to prepare the dish was not evident.  The usual food presentation was gone.  My rasberry lemonade was awful.  They have even decreases the portions for cheesecake as well.  Lastly our waitress was very slow. We will not be eating at this particular  cheesecake factory in the future.
Vince M.,"Charlotte, NC",7,203,422,5.0,2/8/2017,"Famous for its cheesecake and infamous for its two-hour waits, I must admit up front that I had no intention of liking this restaurant. I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different. We arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying. For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert.  As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not. After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good! Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait. Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun. And on top of everything else, it had a 96 sanitary rating. There's no way I can give it anything but five stars! And of course it is a Gotta Try!"
Ebony C.,"Charlotte, NC",92,134,77,2.0,10/22/2017,Horrible service! This was my first and possibly my last time eating at this location. I'll probably stop by and get a slice of cheesecake but that's all.  My waitress kept forgetting about us(my daughter and I). I ordered a burger and added mozzarella cheese. My burger was supposed to come with fries but I never received my fries. My waitress later apologized and offered to boxed them up so I can take them to go. She later returned with the bill and NO fries stating that the cost of the mozzarella cheese ($1.50) was removed from my bill instead. She placed the bill on the table and walked away. About 10 -15 mins went by and I was still waiting to pay my bill. I got impatient and walked to the bar area near the patio to pay. At first the waitress standing there was hesitant to to process my bill but I explained what was going on she processed it and walked away. I could have walked out without paying or without leaving a tip but that's not me.  Next time I will stick to just the cheesecake!
Kristy A.,"Charlotte, NC",245,388,1080,4.0,5/9/2017,"I visited Cheesecake Factory for a friend's birthday party. There was a medium sized group of us, approx. 12. Blue, our waiter, was amazing and very attentive. I ate the Cajun jambalaya over rice. My boyfriend had a kale & quinoa salad that was DELICIOUS! Overall, a great experience. I always order the white chocolate raspberry Cheesecake and it never disappoints."
Bruce A.,"Columbia, SC",0,27,,5.0,12/21/2017,Suggestions: Be ready with your cheese cake order when your waitress takes your drink order as an appetizer.  Food takes a little while so don't skimp on appetizer s. Tex Mex egg-rolls are a great real appetizer They have lots of other entries but I really like their hamburgers.  After the cheese cake and appetizer you don't want to be carrying your food to go.
Taryn R.,"Charlotte, NC",241,394,1866,3.0,11/2/2016,"Considering I wasn't expecting much from America's most unhealthy restaurant, I have to admit, I walked out not totally put-off. So, first, the obvious... Yes, this place is way over priced. And yes, most dishes have an average of 1,000,000 calories. But, I looked a little harder at their novel of a menu and discovered their ""skinnylicious"" offerings. I question how some of these items (fried samosas, I'm looking at you!) are considered skinnylicious, but I'll let that go for now.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. The menu touts it as less than 590 calories. I wonder how many servings come on the plate though... It had 3 chicken breasts, for crying out loud! Anywho, I ate about half the plate and boxed the rest to go. It was tasty, with LOTS of oven roasted cherry tomatoes, capers, asparagus and artichoke. Expensive at $16.95 though! The price you pay for less calories? Go figure.  I landed here on an office outing. While I wouldn't ever choose it myself, I also might not shudder at the thought of going back if the need ever arises again."
Joe R.,"Rock Hill, SC",0,4,,2.0,12/17/2017,Stopped in for some cheesecake to go and found the service I received to be very slow and unorganized.  Especially considering there was no line in front of me when I arrived yet I still had to wait 7 minutes just to place my order.
Joy R.,"Waxhaw, NC",67,121,49,3.0,6/9/2017,"Last night, I called and made reservations for today at 2pm to celebrate our son's end of middle school time. I was told to arrive at 2pm because the table would be given away at 2:10pm. Our party of four arrived at 1:45pm to learn the person who answered the phone did not record our reservation. The hostess was less than helpful and gave us a pager to wait like the other 25 parties there! Dissatisfied, I grabbed a manager who was gracious enough to rectify the situation.  Our waitress was kind and pretty attentive. Our entree selections included shepherd's pie, shrimp scampi without tomatoes that arrived with tomatoes, kids' pizza and a Cuban sandwich. Everything tasted ok. If you do have the shrimp pasta, know that it comes with five shrimp, not many noodles and barely any ""sauce"". Oh and we did have a good appetizer, the buffalo blasts! Known for their cheesecake selections, you can't go wrong. I have a caramel pecan turtle concoction waiting in the fridge for me now. It will make up for the beginning of our experience."
Nakia H.,"Raleigh, NC",0,5,7,4.0,12/17/2017,The food was good. We ate chicken Little's and the skinilicious turkey burger. Our waitress Melissa W. was great.
Angelia L.,"Newton, NC",0,16,6,3.0,7/1/2017,"I've had Cheesecake Factory many times and each time I think the food is average. It's way overpriced for the quality served. Today I got the fish tacos, $15. The presentation looks great but the I could taste everything but the fish. The fish was unfortunately bland. I've had better for a lot cheaper at food trucks. I think everything on the menu is way overpriced and there are just way too many items to choose from.  I think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake.  The service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception. Maybe it's the wax they use but they should reconsider this as it is prone to lead to accidents and injury.  Probably would only come back for dessert but nothing else."
Judith F.,"Fort Mill, SC",37,86,9,1.0,2/5/2017,"This used to be my absolute favorite go to restaurant for the last several years. Anytime we had a special occasion we have always gone to the cheesecake factory. My birthday is January 28 and we went there to eat Sunday the 29th. To give them credit it was an insanely busy day, but that was no excuse for the horrific tasting food that they put in front of me. I ordered the sweet corn tamales and I've never ordered anything else there because those are my absolute favorite things. The plate was scolding hot the food was stone cold it tasted horrible even my guests tasted it and couldn't believe how nasty it was. One of my friends ordered the cheeseburger with bacon on it and macaroni and cheese and ordered it medium-well... it came out about as raw as steak tartare!!!! They brought her burger then eventually they brought her bacon and even later they finally brought her fries. She ordered ranch dressing to go with her fries and it tasted awful. She's just a young girl and she was so embarrassed and thought she had done something wrong because her meals so bad that my insisted they take it off my tab. Her mother ordered the chicken Parmesan with carrots and mashed potatoes. She said it was actually quite good except that the carrots or better and not at all what she expected from the description on the menu.  All in all, we were there for four hours from the time we sit down at our table until the time that we finally were able to leave.  Our meal was handled so poorly by the manager that I decided to find a new favorite place for my birthday. This actually makes me quite sad, but I can always order takeout cheesecake, and I found a copycat recipe for my sweet corn tamales. So if I really want them that bad I'll make them myself. Our waitress was actually quite good, it just wasn't her fault that the food was coming out slowly and was not prepared correctly. She was delightful and really tried hard to keep us from getting out of sorts."
Cory W.,"Charlotte, NC",177,216,269,4.0,8/4/2017,"I stopped in here for the national cheesecake date 1/2 special. I've been to various Cheesecake Factory's all over and this one was no different - delicious cheesecake. Despite be very busy due to the promotion, the line moved quickly and efficiently. I'll definitely return for cheesecake."
Cori B.,"Charlotte, NC",188,395,190,4.0,1/24/2017,"Mmmmmm.... Ok so with the Cheesecake factory, there are some pros and some cons.  Bad news first: Cons: You will wait. Awhile. For a Table. They are always packed. Its a popular destination. The food is OKAY. I mean its called the Cheesecake factory not the Food factory.  Pros: You can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait. Its posted outside. Dim lighting...I love me some romantic mood lighting on dates. My dish of choice is the Louisiana chicken. The chicken is fried to perfection and the pasta is delightful. They serve you bread when you are seated which is warm and delicious. The cheesecake. OMG the cheesecake. I haven't had one I didn't like. They have any kind you can think of. My favorites are the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and the Banana Cream. Ok now my mouth is watering."
Melissa H.,"Indian Trail, NC",1,17,,1.0,11/11/2017,"I have never liked the food at CC Factory but mostly the consistent bad service. Today just solidified it for me. We call ahead day before a large group, no reservations.  We show up and a two hour wait and we can't even sit together.  Forget that. We left for Cantina 1511 and they hooked us up!!"
Greg P.,"Statesville, NC",0,92,60,2.0,12/21/2016,"So, came here for happy hour.   Nothing happy here.  Left in a sad minute.  The only happy hour items on the menu is half price appetizers from 4-6.  Disappointing because I was looking for happy hour drinks.  None.  Been to the same chain and they had happy hour drinks.  What a shame.   I left.  This place needs to turn my frown upside down!  Oh and they have a low sanitation rating."
Megan T.,"Charlotte, NC",29,211,127,4.0,8/15/2016,"What can I say, we love Cheesecake Factory!  We just don't go often because we do have some local favorites or places we can get in and out of quicker.  You just have to go in expecting to wait when you get there for a table and again waiting for the food. They have an extensive menu which I have tried a lot of, but Kevin and I have found the two dishes that we love and get every single time!  When we have a gift card, we usually get each dish, but if we don't, we usually get the combo, as these two dishes also come as a combo.  Great amount for us to share!  We of course love it when we have a gift card so that we can have it for multiple nights!  What are the dishes?  Chicken madeira and steak Dianne!  Both the chicken and steak are awesome.  We love the potatoes too!  If you get the chicken madeira, ask for extra sauce on the side because it is fantastic to pour on the mashed potatoes! We are full by the time we are done, so we always take our cheesecake to go.  Can't go there without getting cheesecake as it is awesome and cheesecake is my favorite!  My favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the apple streusel, which we happened to get both of those this time.  Normally we try out different ones each time, they have some other good ones as well.  I am disappointed that they got rid of my favorite a couple years ago - the oreo cheesecake, but now they have the oreo dream extreme, I've had it once, but just give me an entire oreo cheesecake rather than all the chocolate richness in the cake and other layers! We will be back!  (PS we are now out of giftcards, anyone who wants to give us one we will be happy to take ;-D )"
K K.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,12,,1.0,12/21/2017,"This place is very crowded. Waiting times are terrible. I can do grocery and cook a meal before they assign a table. It has always been a  bad experience every time I have gave it another shot. I will never go back here again. Not worth the aggravation given how many good restaurants are in neighborhood. When I got the table, the seat had food. They did not even have time to clean seat!"
Klp K.,"Vacaville, CA",2,19,,1.0,10/15/2017,"HUGE disappointment. We had an extremely poor experience on Sun 10/15. Our server forgot our bread, did not bring us appetizer plates for our appetizer, then my husband's beef was very undercooked. When reported to the server she replied that ""they won't do anything because there's less than half left"" She, herself realized this was a ridiculous statement as demonstrated when she nervously glanced at the plate which was 95% full and only a couple of bites taken. She had already passed by the table a couple of times, glanced at his plate and never once asked if his meal was ok. I ordered the same entree and also had undercooked meat but less so than my husband, however even though there was also a good portion of my meal remaining she did not ask how mine was and if I was satisfied. She proceeded to ask if we wanted dessert, then brought the dessert before clearing the dinner plates, and without fresh utensils or napkins.  We'd have requested a manager on the spot but we were in with our daughter who is only home for the weekend and we chose to try and enjoy the remainder of the meal with her. Katelyn was our server and her service was awful and she should be coached. I will be contacting a manager tomorrow, Monday.  What a wasted of time and money."
Danace Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1,89,186,5.0,8/6/2017,Was visiting town and my most trusted chain is Cheesecake Factory. The wait for the for was a bit long but it was worth it. The service is phenomenal and the food was amazing.
Lisa H.,"Charlotte, NC",36,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Every so often we get the impulse to go to CCF for dinner because of the variety of menu items that will please all the members of our party. But, after we've waited two hours for a table, wait for bread to come to the table, wait for our entrees, wait for a server to make sure we are ""ok"" with our meals, wait for tea refills, wait for our check to be closed out. One conclusion can be drawn: his place is over rated. Way over rated. The"
Justin B.,"Orlando, FL",117,7,5,4.0,8/6/2017,"My wife and I have never really had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory at SouthPark Mall. Wait staff has always been on point and very attentive. Several times our servers have informed us on options that we were not previously aware of such as paying our bill through the iPhone App, new available Cheesecake options, and even pointing us to the bar for their happy hour specials.  I would give this location a five star rating but there is one issue I have, consistency. The last couple of times we have gone to do the happy hour in the bar area, our apps that were ordered were different in taste each time. My favorite app are the potstickers, but I ordered them three times and all three time they were different. One time they were overdone, next time they were overloaded with the sauce, third time they were near perfect.  Same type of deal has happened with entrees ordered where one time my meatloaf was dry and the next time was slightly undercooked.  My only negative is the consistency of the food sent out. Other than that, this location of Cheesecake Factory is a great one."

Don't understand why we had to give our name and wait to be called before being seated as we were one of the first customers they had and the place was still empty.  It did fill up fast though.  Over all a good experience. Was busy at opening with people waiting to get in. Service seemed a little slow and we had to wait quite some time for our food.  Mostly the only complaint I have.  Though a slice of cheesecake was a bit much at $7.95,  but I guess they have to make their money someway. I would eat here again."
