Morgen L.,"Charlotte, NC",2,82,,4.0,6/29/2016,"I am back to being a Cheesecake Factory customer. I have had several bad experiences at this location, from the customer service to the horrible food. My family decided to try the Cheesecake Factory one more time, since we had a family member that wanted to try it. When we arrived the hostess greeted us and then we were seated with a fantastic waiter named Alex. He was very knowledgeable when it came to the food and recommended a pasta that was just sooooo delicious. He was fun and attentive and really changed our opinion about this location. I will always ask for Alex with the glass and the cool hair."
Andrea S.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,166,23,2.0,5/17/2014,"My two star review went to my server and the cheesecake itself.  I was starving when I got there and was told the wait was 15 minutes. I figured I'd order a cheesecake to go while I waited so I can eat something. My pager went off so when I turned it in, I told the lady I'm waiting for my order. She took the pager and called the next name so I proceeded back in line. A guy calls my name and I tell him the same story so he said he was getting me seated since he can't hold tables and would have my order transferred. He said they were busy. Then he asked if I needed a menu and I said no.( I knew what I wanted. Not the friendliest guy. So as I get seated, there was a five minute wait for a server to ask me what I had so I have her the receipt and she took my drink order. I was starving at that point and saw how busy it was I knew I didn't want to eat there. My cheesecake was finally brought to me after my drink and surprisingly I wasn't asked if I wanted anything. I couldn't wait to leave. I love the Cheesecake Factory but this left a bad taste in my mouth. The server was nice enough to give me a to go cup for my lemonade."
Ashley P.,"Washington, DC",97,293,56,4.0,6/9/2014,"I came here for my birthday lunch, and as I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in for-ever, it was really nice to kick it old school... *Pros* -Outdoor seating. Having spent the entire winter, and well into March in a snowy DC mess, it was great to sit on the outdoor patio at 4:00 in the afternoon with a Root Beer and a cool breeze blowing in my face. -Minimal wait. Maybe no one wanted to sit on said patio, but the waiting area was 50 people deep of couples, families, etc and we only had a 10 minute wait for first available.  -That wide variety of menu items you know and love from CF, including a nice selection of lunch portions (and lunch prices).  -Friendly staff. Something I miss once I moved to the DMV. -Quality ingredients, and tasty food. I ordered the lunch grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes for $13.95. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. Other dishes ordered at the table included a cheeseburger, cobb salad, and chicken wings. All were devoured.  -Food presentation is great. I love the way they serve the dishes to you with thought and care. -Happy Birthday! My cheesecake plate had Happy Birthday written on it, with a pink candle for me to blow out! They also sang Happy Birthday to me. Ahh never gets old even in my late 20's! *Cons* -My broccoli was served cold. I mean ice cold.  -The fountain drinks all tasted flat no matter what you ordered. -When my husband ordered after dinner coffee, and she asked if he wanted a refill she did not tell him refills were not free. Normally, they leave the pot, or bring the pot over and fill 'er up. Nope, he was charged another $3 bucks for black coffee. Party foul! All in all a great birthday lunch with good times and good food."
Renee C.,"Charleston, SC",0,5,,3.0,7/27/2016,"Really bad carry out. Salad not so fresh, quesadilla mediocre. Blah blah blah. Do yourself a favor and do dessert here but dinner someplace else."
Yucel S.,"Lancaster, SC",0,8,,3.0,2/17/2016,"Long, long, wait times, but the food is good. The server I had, Pierre was excellent! The menu prices do seem a bit over priced but let's be honest. The only reason we're going to this place is for the cheesecake :) If they could somehow fix the crazy wait times I would give this place 5 stars. But it's been like that for years now. A great place to go every once in a while."
Avery W.,"Charlotte, NC",139,10,,3.0,8/18/2015,"I give three stars because service started out okay, it took a tad bit longer for the server to greet us. Once greeted she definitely seemed rushed. The food was very good, as usual. Service just was so detached, the bartender who brought our drinks was better then our server. I know it's a job but she should at least fake it for the sake of her tip, we ALWAYS tip well above 20% so she is lucky to of had us and not one of those $5 tippers. Let me add one of our guest never received their meal, it was boxed to-go; the meal was comped but still you don't go out to eat to take it back home and reheat it."
Karen S.,"Lexington, SC",79,225,,4.0,7/6/2014,"Really love this place.  It has been several years since I ate at one (probably while I was still living in Columbus - and that was over six years ago).  Sadly, I live in Columbia, SC, and this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to where I live.  My sister loves it here (well mainly for their cheesecakes), so we decided to make a small road trip up here several days ago. Unlike the name suggests, you can order more than cheesecakes here.  Even though we were originally going to have lunch here, we decided just to stick with cheesecake for dessert. Looking at their menu (briefly might I add and going on when I actually did have dinners here), you can get your typical dinners here (chicken, stekas, pizza) and price wise, it is the about the same as other dinner places you might go to.  The menu does seem overwhelming (as we were only looking for desserts) as this particular location was also running ads for other businesses in the area (not aure if all locations do this as well). Loved the decor as well.  It made you fell like you were eating at a classy place without having to be overly dressed and not paying over the top prices either."
Ron M.,"Charlotte, NC",1,18,1,1.0,12/27/2015,"Had a horrible experience here tonight-12/27 around 7 pm.  My youngest son's food did not arrive until we had almost completed eating our meals.  The waiter, Blue had said they overcooked my son's cheeses teak (without onions or mushrooms ). No visit by the manager and our food took 30 minutes to arrive anyhow!  Food quality is dropping rapidly too;  I ordered the chicken Maderia.  It came with two asparagus. Three weeks ago there were at least eight. We will not return to this location.  Also, the health inspection score is low at 94.5.  Never again!"
Mauricio M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,8,1,4.0,8/12/2014,Good family place. Place seems to be always packed. We had to wait 45 min for a table -normally i would go someplace else- but my daughter really wanted to go there and it was her bday so we ended up staying.  Service was great and food even though took a little longer that usual was pretty good too. I don't know if i would wait another 45 min again but def would go back if there is no waiting time..
Andrew V.,"Waxhaw, NC",2,40,3,5.0,7/3/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. Some may find it odd that I rarely even get cheesecake here. Their food is very high quality. A huge menu which I've had the pleasure of trying out most of their options. A meal can range anywhere from $12 (for a burger) to $30 (for the filet). $20-25 per person is the usual on how much I spend. What makes it so great is the food is worth the price but portions are usually double or even triple size. My favorite appetizer is the fried macaroni and cheese. My favorite entree is the ribeye. And the best entree for the money, is the Cajun Chicken Littles. About 10-12 normal sized, delicious, hand breaded, crispy, chicken tenders, a scoop of awesome mashed potatoes, and some very good corn succotash; just a $15.99 price tag. Highly recommend TCF."
Malaysia R.,"Charlotte, NC",123,2,,4.0,1/12/2016,Love the Cajun jambalaya pasta. They give you ample amounts of food. The cheesecake with fresh strawberries is bomb as well.
Jenna D.,"Cornelius, NC",0,11,3,1.0,1/10/2015,The food was very good but the service was terrible. My waiter made a series of rude jokes to my family and we never once got a refill on our drinks. It took 30 minutes for our cheesecake to come and when I ordered a piece to go he gave me a much tinier piece than the others. Totally not worth the $8 I spent on it.
Bernise G.,"Cottage Grove, MN",3,1,,5.0,3/20/2016,"We had a very bad experience: my husband got his dinner, I ordered shrimp dinner, the waiter said mine would be 5 minutes late, the kitchen overlooked it and was making another; my granddaughter got her beef sandwich, no au jus, no salad and had to wait. Mine came and was almost 10 minutes late. A manager said 3 minutes, bad experience! Did not give a complimentary dinner ."
Skylar B.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,2.0,1/30/2017,waited 50 min at the table for the waiter to come back and tell us he forgot to put in our order. :-(
Dan B.,"Long Beach, CA",46,44,102,1.0,4/6/2014,"Cold Crappy Food, Over and Over... Why do I Torture myself every time. The Manager is W E A K !!! Kyle Davis  - Manager"
La'Toria B.,"Charlotte, NC",85,43,120,3.0,9/27/2014,"Ordered Curbside TOGO for an Oreo cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, key lime cheesecake, and a Snickers bar cheesecake. Yummy!!!! They are open on Saturdays despite what it says here on the app! Curbside quoted me about 25 minutes, However it took longer than 25 minutes for my order to be delivered to my car, almost an hour. Ordered at approximately 8:24pm and finally received my cheesecakes at 9:15pm. The curbside waitress was polite and explained to us that the dessert orders were insane tonight so we understood! Cheesecakes were yummy though! :)"
Kamesha A.,"Columbia, SC",1,17,12,4.0,6/27/2015,Always love the Cheesecake Factory. This particular location ALWAYS has at least a 45-60 min wait. Food is always great.
Belle D.,"Centreville, VA",231,314,121,3.0,2/5/2013,"Place: Located by the mall, literally. The venue here is spacious and large. They have outdoor seating for dining, and outdoor seating for awaiting tables. It's wonderful actually. I am always fascinated with the pastel and sky painting, with a splash of regal columns (you find this at every Cheesecake Factories). Service: Waiters/waitress, on a busy day - they are not at their best. I tend to have my drinks not refilled right away. There is ALWAYS a wait, around 15-45 mins on a busy night. I honestly avoid this place, because of the long wait.  Lunch time is the time to go, at best. Food: There is an eclectic food selections that are diverse. There are pizza, Italian and Asian cuisines, plethora of cheesecakes to choose from, burgers and sandwiches... - I liked their iceberg lettuce salad - their strawberry shortcake dessert is delicious with vanilla ice cream! - raspberry ice tea, always refreshing - shrimp scampi, safe, but good in large portions - chicken Parmesan, always a winner with my hubby Price: pricey. I believe it is worth it, in terms of big portions.. Enough for little ole me to take home as leftovers for work."
Pierre W.,"Charlotte, NC",0,7,,5.0,1/2/2016,"Consistently a winner! For those of you who enjoy Cheesecake Factory, this location will satisfy your needs. The food is ALWAYS good. We've never had bad service there either. If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory, you're missing out! They have a wide variety of lunch/dinner options and of course a ton of cheesecake options. Be prepared to spend a bit of money though. Most dishes cost close to $20. It's well worth it!"
Stephan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",23,13,168,2.0,8/31/2015,One of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. Biscuits were dry and cold also burnt on the bottom. The meatloaf was also burnt like it was recooked and drinks were not satisfactory. In efforts to have orders corrected our waitress copped an attitude because our table wasn't satisfied. We were visiting from Pittsburgh and this would have never been acceptable there or anywhere else. Needless to say we will not be back to this South Park location.
