Wendy F.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",40,5,,4.0,8/27/2017,"Wonderful service yesterday ! Walked in at 11:30 and did not have to wait at all. Service was amazing, food was good. Oreo cheesecake was the BEST ! Great experience overall !"
Melanie E.,"Charlotte, NC",1,8,1,1.0,3/16/2017,"Let me start by saying I work in this mall and have taken my lunch break numerous times here and never had a problem. But today, we took our hour lunch break here during a very slow time of the day and sat in Larry's section. Not only was the server rude and couldn't muster a smile the entire time, but our food took an hour to come out. We tried explaining we were on break and only had an hour, only to get eye rolls in response. The end result was all of our food having to be boxed and taken home to eat after work and we ate bread for lunch. Not a pleasant experience, literally all our server had to do was apologize for the food taking longer and smile. Instead we left with empty stomachs and a bad mood."
Bria M.,"Charlotte, NC",72,1,,1.0,8/26/2017,This stupid chain of restaurants thought that they were so good that they needed to cook every type of cuisine and water their menu down to the point of all the food being tasteless!! Just because you specialize in cheesecake does not mean that your expensive meals need no consideration and consistency. It's too much going on. I had the Chicken Riesling and it was disgusting.It didn't taste like there was a drop of Riesling cooked with it.The pasta tasted like unfiltered dirty water with no salt.The meal was suppose to have bacon and caramelized onions and their was about a teaspoon of each...I ate with 5 other people and they all hated their pasta dishes as well as a dry burger on a hard crusty baguette (who eats a burger on a baguette?) and my grandmothers meal was forgotten and super late after we waited an hour after being seated to eat. Then I was charged for a top shelf drink that the waitress admitted was only worth $7 Gordon Ramsay should be a reviewer of the whole company and get the company shut down.
Julie L.,"Matthews, NC",0,6,,5.0,8/25/2017,"Had a great lunch with my son before he goes off to college.  Kyle was our server and was very attentive.  We started with the calamari which was crisp, hot and delicious.  My son got the salad with seared tuna, and I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps.  I had a special request for a different sauce, and it came just like I ordered it.  We finished off with a piece of salted caramel cheesecake which was amazing.  The GM even visited our table, and he was extremely friendly and professional.  We will definitely return to this location."
Amy A.,"Charlotte, NC",44,12,21,5.0,10/11/2015,"The food is ok at this restaurant, but in my opinion is quite overpriced and not worth the massive lines that are ALWAYS there. But what IS worth the wait? THE CHEESECAKES! You will wait about 20 minutes (expect to add to that on a Saturday night) to order and receive your cheeaecake, but it is soooooooooooo worth the wait. They have at least 30 different varieties to pick from (which makes for a few minutes of intense anxiety when deciding) and I haven't had a bad one yet!  Take my advice, go eat your meal somewhere else and take the money you save and then come here and buy extra slices of this heavenly cheesecake!"
Wen L.,"Atlanta, GA",64,188,141,3.0,10/13/2014,"This chain is always reliable. I don't go often, maybe once a year or two.  It does have good food, good service, and good dessert. I tend to get overwhelmed by the menu though! They have everything from american to mexican to asian. It is a bit crazy if you think about it.  I ordered the lunch everything pizza, which comes with a salad this time. The portion was huge! This one order is certainly two meals in one. It was very good! I know the bowtie pasta dish is good as well.  This was the first time I had the banana pudding cheesecake with fresh banana slices. It was amazing! Not too sweet. In fact it was perfect!"
Suzanne M.,"Matthews, NC",11,17,4,3.0,8/19/2017,Love Cheesecake Factory food but a 2 hour wait on the weekend is too much!
Paul L.,"Spartanburg, SC",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2016,Horrible experience waited 70 min for a table then waited an additional 50 min for a child's spaghetti and meatball dinner and the adult meals sat under a warmer and dried out. Ordered a cheese cake for desert and was told the bakery staff were on a change of shift and waited over 20 minutes for a desert!  I can not recommend this place due to slow poor service.
Ayham J.,"Easley, SC",5,22,39,5.0,7/26/2016,This time everything was super.  I tried the almond salmon salad. It was amazing.  Maybe the Mojito needed more tequila. Steak Diane was very delicious.
Amelia A.,"New York, NY",109,12,24,3.0,9/3/2015,"I ordered a salad off the ""superfood"" menu that proclaimed to have a plethora of nutrious goodness and ended up in a bowl fit for three people comprised mostly of iceberg lettuce. Dissapointing. The service was slow, too.  However, I also got an avacado tartare, don't remember which fish was used. That was adorable and tasty but it had waaaay too much soy sauce that was not on the side and included hella fattening pita chips, a classic American adulteration of something supposed to be so pure, gah. It was tasty, though."
Tim R.,"Raleigh, NC",2,24,1,1.0,11/22/2016,"Really slow and unprofessional service can be overshadowed by exceptional food, but this place has bad food too."
Fleece P.,"Charlotte, NC",125,253,403,5.0,8/4/2015,"Why does the cheesecake factory only have 3stars ? The appetizers alone are always banging and who doesn't like free bread ??? Let's take a moment and notice the menu options are vast , the prices as well but come on there's more than enough food given to keep you satisfied and not too hurt on the $$. If you are a cheese cake fan they have one for every person . I simply can't get enough of the potstickers , the sauce is heavenly . Minus the long waits , it's not a horrible restaurant ... Try the Jamaican black pepper shrimp , or the Kobe burger , maybe in the mood for egg rolls , both the Tex mex and avocado are delicious ."
Christy J.,"North Charleston, SC",0,6,,4.0,3/6/2017,"We got the Baja Chicken Tacos and the Club Sandwich, and both meals were delicious. For dessert, we opted for the Godiva cheesecake and the Snickers cheesecake; again, both of these were winners!  Our waiter, Artuello, was outstanding, and it was a very pleasant evening.  There were 2 minors hiccups that prevented a five-star:   1) We were told it would be a 45-minute wait (we had party of 4), but there was some sort of mix-up, so it was 2 hours before we were seated.   2) To a lesser extent, 1/2 of the stalls in the women's restroom were out of order.  Considering the number of patrons in the restaurant, this was a bit of an inconvenience.  Those 2 things withstanding, it was still a wonderful experience, and I'm very glad we were able to go!"
Melody C.,"Columbia, SC",2,39,5,5.0,11/14/2016,"Dropped in  for a quick lunch, wasn't  surprised with the long lines and 45 minute wait. The strawberry lemonade and entree was well worth the wait. We took   two slices of their cheesecake and my taste buds desired more.  Most definitely will be returning."
Melissa B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",10,29,31,2.0,1/21/2017,"Food very good :) always delicious!  Very disappointed with our waiter... waited forever for a straw... ordered lunch portion of a pasta and upon arrival to the table it's a full portion and then I'm told ""oh it doesn't come in lunch portion"". Extremely disappointed... could have split it with my sister had I known... not a big dig if you are going home soon... but not so much if hours of shopping ahead."
Cathy Z.,"Charlotte, NC",53,31,30,5.0,7/27/2015,Love this place!! Yes you have to wait a while to be seated. But every time we go we put our name on the list and keep an eye out at the bar area since it is first come first serve and end up getting a table there before the buzzer goes off so we turn it in. I have been here so many times for lunch & dinner. Tonight we came for dinner with my husband and step daughter. I always order the same thing barbecue ranch chicken salad is the best!! My husband gets something different all the time and loves everything he gets. My step daughter always gets four cheese pasta and loves it all the time she gets it. Tonight we all shared chocolate moose cheese and it was delish!!  You have to be very patient when you go there. The waiters guys & gals are awesome for the amount of people they have to take care of. Always so positive and friendly.
Jess L.,"Charlotte, NC",269,274,159,3.0,6/10/2015,"So listen... it's not BAD. They're just not consistent. And when I say that, I mean it in every sense of the word. You could get something spectacular one night and order the same dish again the next night and not get the same quality. I went there with the lady and another couple to celebrate achievements on all of our parts. The girls ordered drinks, which they thoroughly enjoyed.  And then the food came out. I ordered...uh... some jamaican jerk thing? With chicken instead of shrimp? Jeez, it's so hard to remember when the menu is that big. I'm sure that there are a bunch of jamaican jerk things with chicken. But this one had beans and a mango pineapple salsa! And plantains!  The chicken was excellent, the slaw was good (but room temp, not cold), the beans were okay (they lacked seasoning), and the yucca was seriously overcooked. I was with my Irish buddy who had never seen plantains before and he asked me if I ordered shit (yes, they were that charred and shriveled. I gotta say, I don't blame him). However, it's really hard to mess up the internal flavor of a plantain, and overall, it was fine. The lady ordered Fish Tacos, and she was not pleased. But I can't blame her, they had soaked the damn thing is so much sauce that the actual tortilla broke when she tried to pick it up because it was too saturated. She said it also lacked any flavor, though I didn't try it. The cheesecake IS consistently wonderful though. I do wish they gave a weeee bit bigger slices, but what can you do.  I do enjoy coming here, I really do, but... it never turns out to be as good as I think it's going to be. Phew. Feels good to get that off my chest."
Jared W.,"1, NC",25,250,719,4.0,5/16/2016,"I have to update and downgrade my review to 4 stars for this Cheesecake Factory. Although the food is always good here, they haven't been quite as consistent at delivering top notch dishes like my first 2-3 visits. My girlfriend and I have noticed that the quality can vary even when ordering the same dish. Neither the food nor service has ever been bad, however, and the desserts are always exceptional!"
Ricky M.,"University City, Charlotte, NC",1,16,,2.0,10/28/2016,"We stopped in here for an early dinner, we got unsweetened tea which was watered down. I got the veggie burger, very bland and it fell apart. And Brett got the BBQ chicken pizza he said that it was good, but a little undercooked. Overall the experience was very mediocre, we skipped the dessert because it looked like it came in frozen. There's nothing special about this place. We won't be back. We make better food at home."
Jacqueline P.,"Charlotte, NC",157,219,103,3.0,11/21/2016,"Generally speaking I'm not a chain restaurant fan. This place is decent though. We came tonight for my moms birthday and I get the appeal for her. She's a midwestern bland food kind of person. Nothing wrong with that, but I am the exact opposite so I only find it ""ehhh"". The menu is insanely large and overwhelming. Seriously, I've never seen a restaurant have so many options and I'm not sure that's a good thing either. The prices are also very high, however one entree is enough food for two people so it evens out... Seriously the portions are ENORMOUS. I finally decided on the Parmesan crusted chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken tasted good but the Parmesan crust was soggy. The green beans were bland and underdone but the mashed were very good. It did take forever to get our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you're in a hurry. I love their pineapple upside down cheesecake however it's seasonal and not available... I haven't had it in years so it may not even be a thing anymore. I opted for the original; not bad but obviously comes in frozen and then thawed for sale. My mom got the key lime cheesecake and I wasn't a fan. I prefer New York style cheesecake and this was really thin. However if you prefer the thinner version you will love it and huge bonus point the whipped cream is homemade and not from a can!! Overall it's an a-okay place for a meal. It absolutely knows it's audience and appeals to them successfully. I get the success, just not a place I will be a regular at."
