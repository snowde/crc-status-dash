Derrick S.,"North Charleston, SC",38,6,2,5.0,1/28/2017,Great place to eat at me and my fiancée had a great time there and the waiter was great at her job. I would recommend going back again soon
Joshua C.,"Charlotte, NC",57,4,,3.0,1/24/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has a pretty nice venue, but it seems to take in so many patrons  that they can't keep up with maintaining the store standards. The floors feel greasy and dirty when I went, and I even felt like I would have slipped if I wasn't careful. You can't reserve tables which sucks for how busy that place gets. Their menu is a little too big, and the drinks are way over priced. But they do have a nice venue and the food is actually pretty good as well. Not to mention the cheesecakes are awesome."
Aastha G.,"Overland Park, KS",15,34,25,2.0,5/29/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory so don't get me wrong as this review is totally about this experience. I have been a regular customer to the Cheesecake Factory in Kansas. However this Charlotte one was my first experience. I didn't mind waiting for 1 hr 15 mins and didn't mind the fading lights. Lights were very dim to read the menu comfortably but I didn't mind as I knew what I wanted to order. I always start with Avocado egg rolls as they are my favorite. However they weren't as crispy as I have had them earlier, it seemed they were sitting on the kitchen counter for around 10 mins after being fried. Which resulted in the lack of crispness.  For the entree I wished to try a new item, the ratatouille toast. The presentation was beautiful and appetizing. The ratatouille was delightful however the toast was burnt and very dry. It was hard to eat but thinking about my prior experience with Cheesecake Factory I gave it a go hoping that the next piece would be better. But I realized it was hopeless cause. This was reported to the manager and he offered to replace it but by then I just lost my appetite. He took it off the bill which was a kind gesture. I wouldn't have mind paying for it as its all about the having a good experience. For desserts it was lemoncello cream torte, which is a masterpiece. Refreshing lemon mascarpone cheese sandwiched between moist vanilla cake topped with streusel."
Amber S.,"Greensboro, NC",0,5,,3.0,2/15/2016,"It pains me to write this review, because ordinarily, going to the Cheesecake Factory is such a treat! (We don't have one in Greensboro, NC). Sure, it's not ""fine dining"", but the food is always good and the portions are so large! With that said, my sister threw me a baby shower at this location on 2/13/16. They don't take reservations per se, but my sister was assured, 3 weeks ahead of time, that they would hold the back room open for our party of 25. My sister called the morning of the shower to make sure everything was still a go. This was around 10:45 am and she was notified that there was already a line of patrons outside the door. We hurried to the restaurant and arrived around 11:30 am and were told that the room and tables we were promised had already been taken!! We decided to stay and wait, as invitations had been mailed out, and it was too late to change locations. Suffice it to say, we did not get seated until after 1 pm. This was difficult for me because I am 9 months pregnant and hadn't eaten because I never anticipated the wait.  I ordered my favorite, Chicken Madeira, which was good as always, but the occasion was really ruined by the long wait."
Hashani S.,"Ventura, CA",492,523,766,3.0,8/1/2015,"We cam here on for happy hour during National Cheesecake Day. Happy hour is M-Sat from 4-6p. Sadly, they do not have any drink specials during happy hour. :( The food though, is amazing! $5.50 for actually small plate sizes, which is a lot. I made the ""mistake"" of ordering 3 apps for the 2 of us, so much food! We ordered the mac and cheese balls, cheese and spinach dip and southwest chicken rolls. Everything was really good though the cheese and spinach dip could have benefited with some seasoning. The mac and cheese balls and the southwest chicken rolls were very hearty, we had to take a lot of food home with us.  What I did not like was how much the Long Island Iced Tea costs (I docked 1.5 stars for this), I blew $10.70 for a watered down drink. It did not feel like that much alcohol was in there. I won't be buying drinks from here again.  The half off THE FIRST SLICE of cheesecake was a great deal, my boyfriend and I each bought a slice. I got the caramel turtle while he got the tiramisu. The caramel turtle was amazing, wasn't too cream cheesy and had the right amount of sweetness. The tiramisu was just meh, I wouldn't get it again.  Don't forget to complete the feedback survey, you get $10 ecredit towards your next purchase. Pretty worth it if used during happy hour (there is no fine print saying you can't)."
Anthony H.,"Charlotte, NC",168,150,433,2.0,2/22/2015,"A menu that is a mile long and a wait time going to an hour and a half with no ability to make a reservation is asinine. When we finally did get to the table to sit, we weren't greeted for about 15 minutes and that was the best part of the evening. After taking our orders, our waitress didn't check on us again until the food was served but but by that time my wife and I had no water just ice cubes sitting lonely in the bottom of our glass. I ordered the Miso Salmon and my wife ordered the Petite Filet. I wasn't pleased at all with the Salmon because it was pink in the middle and my wife didn't really care for the Filet because it wasn't cooked to order. We decided not to have the food sent back because it would've taken forever and two days to get the food back.  The wait staff seemed like they could care less and on many occasions they were simply MIA. They tried to push desert on us but we were ready to go and get desert someplace else. This is not the type of service I expected because I've been to other Cheesecake locations across the states and this was the worst experience. The staff needs more customer focused training and being attentive not blind to the needs of your clients. I based on this experience couldn't recommend you to spend your money here unless you enjoy mediocre service. I don't write my review lightly because I understand that business can get packed and scheduling issues can affect service but if you're in SouthPark, fix that if you expect to stay relevant!"
Becky C.,"Charlotte, NC",26,15,,2.0,3/14/2016,"This is our second visit because while the food was mediocre the first time,  the service was wonderful.  This time it was my daughter's 18th birthday.  We were seated in the back corner looking at nothing,  but okay,  the hostess did not know, but there were plenty of tables in the  restaurant.  Then we had a waitress that majored in condescension.  The food was,  once again,  mediocre and the server was rude.   The two stars are for the Cheesecake which did not disappoint."
Andrew S.,"North Augusta, SC",58,165,121,4.0,2/17/2015,"Came here on Valentine's Day, driving 2 1/2 hours from home and arrived @ 1:30 pm and had to wait in a line out the door just to get my name on the list. They said come back in an hour to get a pager. Came back after shopping in the attached mall and waited in the line out the door again to get my pager, and waited about an hour more before finally getting a table for 2. I don't think I have ever seen a restaurant so busy but they handled it well. Food and service were good. The cheesecake was really good.Ordered some to take home also."
Faith C.,"Charlotte, NC",68,32,1,5.0,12/18/2016,"Went here for me and my boyfriends anniversary and it was so awesome. Our waiter, Joe, was honest with me when I asked him what his favorite cocktails were, and his favorite entree. He recommended the pineapple mojito which was delicious and the shepherds pie, which was probably one of the best meals I've had out to eat ever! Awesome service and food :)"
Toni C.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",27,2,,2.0,12/18/2016,"I don't usually give negative feedback but my husband and I spent two hours and 10 minutes here for lunch today. While the food was delicious, the wait was unreasonable. The wait for a table was about 40 minutes but that was expected considering the crowd. We were seated beside an empty table and placed our order. About half an hour later a family of ten was seated beside us and we still had not received our food. We shared a waitress and she was extremely pleasant, but much more attentive to the larger party. She told us our food was coming right out three times before we got it, I honestly think she had forgotten about us. By the end of our meals, we just barely beat the other family out the door, and that's because we got our cheesecake to go. I hate to say anything bad about such a nice girl and good food, but over two hours for lunch is ridiculous."
Christi K.,"Ballard, Seattle, WA",366,569,430,3.0,3/5/2016,"Ubiquitous. Once you have been one, you've really been to them all. The brown bread is great. The wait is atrocious during peak hours or prom season. The cheesecake is good but at $8 a slice, you can do better elsewhere."
Eloise R.,"Charlotte, NC",0,38,,2.0,11/14/2016,"The cheesecake was obviously 5 stars, this is the Cheesecake Factory you'd expect with that name that they'd get that right at least.  This may be the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. The waits are ridiculous, the traffic from the mall combined with the fact that it's the only Cheesecake Factory makes for exceptionally long waits throughout the day (despite many open tables within my line of vision).  They are ridiculously over priced - especially for the quality of food. I'd say average at best, but nothing that warrants the price tag. The salmon is tasteless (they sell it as fresh lol). Chicken is dry, some pasta noodles were hard still towards the ends. Had a salad that cost me $13ish and was soggy as hell.  Service is hit or miss. Come here for the cheesecake, and that's all."
Barry K.,"Painted Post, NY",135,228,280,4.0,3/9/2015,"Located in the South Park mall this is a busy area.  ONE MAJOR NOTE if you go on a weekend be prepared to wait they estimated 3 to 2 1/2 hours on Saturday night! The inside of this place is huge one of the biggest CKF I have ever been in. They are one of the better chain restaurants with one of the biggest menu's I ever seen.  It is pages upon pages of options.   The food They always start you off with some bread which is decent nothing specially but always fresh and warm which is key.  I ordered Shepards Pie yes you heard me right at CKF.  It is one of the best I have ever had.  It is my favorite comfort food and it is hard to find at most places.  It had great flavor and the portion was generous.  Staff Everyone was very friendly I have never had a bad experience at this place.  My waitress was helpful and attentive.   Verdict I am not a huge ""chain""  guy but CKF is one of the few I would go to if I am in the area.  The food is really good and the selection is second to none."
Nisha N.,"Rock Hill, SC",243,14,,5.0,11/29/2016,The place was crowded... The food was good.... The cheesecake was over the top delicious! The service could have been better... Waiting to long for drink refills. . Overall i will be returning for the cheesecakes.. Finger licking good
Phillip M.,"Charleston, SC",8,56,5,3.0,9/20/2016,"The wait was terrible...waiting to sign in to wait is asinine. The waitress was like a roller coaster....one second she was a good peak and then she was a bad valley. Like always it was a $100+ meal that should have been $25 due to the failure to fill drinks, bring hot food and the length of time that it obviously took to make the cheesecake. Thank heavens that I don't live in Charlotte."
Julia R.,"Charleston, SC",225,458,377,5.0,5/3/2015,"Love this Cheesecake Factory! The food is just right every time i eat there! This time. We had fantastic service at the bar during happy hour. The happy hour food deals are excellent, though there are no drink specials. We enjoyed the artichokes-my fave and the artichoke crab dip. Both were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I wish we had a Cheesecake Factory near me!"
Candyce B.,"Charlotte, NC",320,767,877,3.0,9/28/2013,"Spoiler Alert!!! I didn't have cheesecake! I know! I know!  I used to love Cheesecake Factory. I mean I would find any excuse to go here...but after a while things changed, the food was different and I stopped going. And then my friends came to visit from Virginia and where did they wanna go????  Our good old standby...of course!  And here we go: Drinks:  My favorite for a long time has been their Georgia Peach. Vodka, Peach liquor swirled with raspberries and topped with a mint leaf so it looks like a peach in a glass. Perfect! Always delicious, and most certainly expect to order two! Mmmmmm!  Appetizers: We ordered the wings without the sauce. They were okay. A little dry but we just doused them in blue cheese and ranch. There are plenty of other options so unless you're craving wings try something else. We also ordered the Buffalo Blasts. Now these things are freaking delicious! It's chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce stuffed in a wonton and fried. You can always sign me up for anything with the words ""fried, chicken and cheese"" in the description. They were ahhhhmazing! Crispy on the outside juicy flavorful meat stuffed on the inside (and they are not stingy with the filling) served hot with ranch dressing...like Nike says Just Do It! You can thank me later!  Dinner:  I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. It comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus over a lemon sauce. I'm a huge fan of the lemon sauce (always ask for extra) but last night the salmon just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, portion size was not the issue. But it was just very bland. The potatoes are chunky with pieces of the red skin, not a favorite for me but that's just my personal preference. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and dipped in the lemon sauce....simply divine!  Overall, the meal was just okay. Nowhere near as good as I used to remember but not bad by any means. I'm sure I'll be back...and yes I'll make sure to get a piece of cheesecake."
Rodel T.,"Charlotte, NC",3,14,245,5.0,10/3/2016,Been going to this place for years and still the food is delicious.  I would recommend it to anyone. Always busy though especially Friday nights. I recommend the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp but it's ALL good.
Trish J.,"Charlotte, NC",22,40,25,3.0,3/31/2016,"The wait was long on Wednesday night, we were sitting down looking at empty tables for 10 minutes before we were seated. Total wait time was 20 minutes though. The bread they brought to the table was cold and hard and the butter was in individual packages equally cold. The food was good when we got it. I loved the LUAU SALAD. It was so delicious and plentiful. 14.95 is kinda high for a salad but it was worth it."
Val M.,"Pineville, NC",0,1,,5.0,6/8/2017,"I am going our of my way to leave my very first Yelp review. Thank you Shonya for being such a fantastic server. Very professional, friendly and attentive. We have been here in the past and did not experience the same level of service that she provided. Having a server like her makes us want to return. The food was delicious and fresh, portions were large and we had plenty to take home. We will definitely be back again soon!"
