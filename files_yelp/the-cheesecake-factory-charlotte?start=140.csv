Ana E.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,30,3,2.0,4/3/2017,"So I think make my ""Monday Night"" an easy work week night and get take out from Cheesecake Factory. Boy was that a wrong call especially since this is their slowest night! So I complete and pay for my order by 8:01 and was quoted 20 to 25 mins and waited until 8:42 at which point I asked the same take out cashier who had rang me up what was going on she replies waiting on fries and I said well you told me 20 to 25 she replies back I said 25 to 30 I said no but let's go with that then what's taking an extra 15 by the time that banter is done she had no answer except would you like me to get a manager and I replied yes that and the food you said would be ready within the 30 minutes that's now 45 so I wait for him ( Adrian) I believe was his name and after watching him deal with another customer to whole he gave a free slice of cheesecake because I'm guessing resolving yet another dissatisfied customer I unleash a flurry of choice words on their lack of customer service and kitchen performance because 2 hamburgers and a couple of salads do not take 1 hr worth of prepping because the prep boy that came in at 6am already chopped everything up and it's a matter of putting it all in a box. Meanwhile I have a viewership because I have become irate over the lack of concern as the store manager I believe Brandon to be was just watching with a blank stare and I ask him what's he doing and he states just listening to you didn't want to interrupt so I said you'll have to cause I'm long winded. Had nothing to offer so I had him go chase for his business card so I can call corporate or at least email them with first hand insight to their Monday night standards and hope they can improve on it. See the things that makes me so mad, irate or just blow my lid is unlike most people that complain I wasn't looking for ""free"" anything as I always reject such option. That's a band aid on an open wound. What I want is for you to take the time and go look into the issue and fix it and not give me this blank stare like you are surprised to see a customer so upset over a couple of burgers taking an hr to be made. Are you freaking kidding me! I've seen junior chefs make complete meals in an hr and yours can sling out some burgers in 30 mins. Time for training session or new cooks. They're a dime a dozen I'm guessing since it's not a restaurant where you have the liberty to make your menu as you go. Hope this helps you Brandon with what the issue was and you jump on it and get it taken care of. I know it's not the first time service has been lack luster and that's putting it mildly! And to all the staff just being a spectator on the conversation it makes sense why your operation was lacking and why the customer before me got a free dessert from you!"
Candace A.,"Hyde Park, MA",0,13,5,1.0,4/16/2017,Would give 0 stars if I could. We were seated fast  ... 15-20 minutes went by ... no server... nobody even acknowledged us. We walked out and the server just shrugged. It wasn't busy and I thought it was rude. I  have had good experiences at other locations so this was disappointing.
Harold D.,"Moncks Corner, SC",1,12,2,5.0,5/9/2016,The SteakDiane is awesome! I highly recommend it. The menu is large. It will take me a lot of trips just to put a dent in it.
Margaret W.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,30,12,1.0,9/25/2016,"We came here to celebrate a birthday. The wait time was 10 minutes on a Sunday evening.... arriving at 5:45. It was 20 minutes and parties of a similar size who checked in after were sat first. Our booth was past the bar area and the seats were covered in crumbs. We had no silverware when we were sat but it did come with the bread. Our service was ok...she was nice. Her timing was off but considering waiting tables while pregnant is a challenge....she did ok. Our food arrived fine but we had ordered chicken OTS with the four cheese pasta and it arrived 20 minutes after the entrees and it was bland. I asked for a manager to bring this kitchen issue to his attention, he never showed up. When the server who dropped off our food didn't have the chicken with him, he confirmed we were missing it but it was 20 minutes for it to arrive. We had finished eating by then. We did dessert to-go. Not sure we will return to this location."
Kaitlyn E.,"Birmingham, AL",0,20,1,4.0,10/31/2016,"It's hard to review the Cheesecake Factory because honestly, if you can't find anything on the menu there's no hope. The food is good and the waiters are always very attentive when we go. Best time to go is on a week day during lunch time. Weekends get crowded which is very understandable for anything attached for a mall. But we always call ahead to see what the wait time is before showing up. Don't forget to stop by the cheesecake counter or get the eggroll sampler! It's a chain so my expectations are lower than a 5 star steakhouse."
Timothy F.,"SC, SC",2,23,51,5.0,10/3/2016,"We always enjoy the food and atmosphere at The Cheesecake Factory. We're also happy we now have one in Greenville. The ""Skinnylicious"" menu is just right."
Amber J.,"Natick, MA",0,65,4,2.0,4/28/2017,"Why is this location the lowest quality food out of all the cheesecake factories I've been too? I mean seriously our waiter today had an attitude problem, let out a huge gasp when we returned our stuffed mushrooms because of how pathetic they looked. Flat, barley any stuffing, like he's annoyed of the fact we are returning it? I'm annoyed because I love them and they just always suck at this location. White rice with my dish, so over cooked and mushy. Last time the rice was hard and undercooked. Shepard pie once here was like a soup, we returned it. I was served salmon once that was burned to a crisp, the person serving was like ""yes I'd return that too"" so then don't bring it out!!! This location is just not the same quality you can get at other locations and I've been to about 5 different ones nationwide. This is my favorite restaurant up in MA-the natick location. But here in Charlotte it's very disappointing. Corporate please send some secret diners in to see how bad it is here!"
Kia R.,"Charlotte, NC",46,46,376,5.0,2/7/2015,"1 hour wait today, be patient.  Strawberry Lemonade is always good!  Little crab cakes as app. is a must try.  Hibachi Steak is fantastic and my favorite.  Headed home with fresh strawberry cheesecake.  Small groups are better on the weekends."
Sasha R.,"Charlotte, NC",158,313,2010,4.0,9/25/2013,"If you can't find something you love from Cheesecake's extensive menu, something is wrong with you. The white sangria was strong, sweet and delicious.  Avocado egg rolls are perfect. Crispy exterior and soft flavorful interior. I like it dipped in their homemade ranch better than the sweet dipping sauce the egg rolls come with.  Chili Rellenos were somewhat disappointing. The hot, melty pepper jack cheese inside is awesome, but the pepper has a very green pepper flavor rather than any spiciness. The crunchy fried outside is good but overall this was a miss for me. Not really worth the calories.  The veggie burger was made with beets (along with brown rice, farro and black bean) and was not good at all. It was cold and sweet and bland.  You can't go wrong with any of the desserts. We had the banana cream cheesecake, which is our standby favorite. And I also tried Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, made with layers of brownie, coconut cheesecake, chocolate cake, coconut frosting (similar to the topping for German chocolate cake) and whipped cream. It was good, but I've had better."
Kris G.,"Goose Creek, SC",41,67,4,3.0,9/6/2015,"OK, I went in with really high expectations from everything I've heard about this place. We went on a Friday night around 8 and only had about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated and our waiter seemed very nice at first and told us to take our time and soak in everything. I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious.  I was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all. This was a huge disappointment because like I said I had super high expectations coming in.    Bad Service aside, the Cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! Oh My Goodness, My husband tried the original cheesecake, but I had to go all in. I got the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.  Yes it was a completely fat *ss item, but it was so worth it. I would stay on the elliptical all day to have that once a week.  Overall it was an ok experience.  The food was AMAZING, but the service was very disappointing. :( I will definitely  give it another try and for sure at least get some cheesecake to go."
Gregory A.,"Columbia, SC",13,40,71,5.0,1/29/2016,"The service was excellent. Our waitress Jennifer was very helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is great. The food... Phenomenal. Me and my friend could not finish it all. They need recliners in this place for situations like this! The meatloaf was wonderful. It came with brown gravy which I normally don't like on my meatloaf but this brown gravy wasn't your normal everyday gravy. It was in a class by itself. My friend's food tasted great as well. Yeah I ate some of her food. Don't judge me. Lol. The flavor her dish had was spectacular! I will order that the next time. Now we're full and need to walk it off. Heading into the mall for a little shopping. Until next time my fellow Yelpers... Peace and chicken grease..."
Kartik K.,"Raleigh, NC",15,8,,1.0,11/25/2015,The service was absolutely shoddy. You had to wait for you server and ask for everything twice or thrice.  Basic etiquette was not provided by our sever. This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I have had.  The rest rooms were also not serviced well. My wife and daughter complained that there was no toilet paper in the stalls and other patrons were doing their best to clean the stalls so that they could go
Amanda G.,"Charlotte, NC",66,190,65,4.0,9/25/2015,We waited over an hour to sit but Cheesecake Factory is always amazing. So many choices and the dessert is wonderful. My complaint is that the service can be slow because of the high volume of people coming in!
Marshal C.,"Charlotte, NC",182,142,240,5.0,8/30/2014,"This location is fantastic!  There is tons if great shopping that can be had prior to your cheesecake fulfilling experience.  Some things I would like to mention about the restaurant: -The waitstaff are extremely nice and very helpful.  You will never worry about your cup going dry!  They also get the food to you in a hurry so that it doesn't every get cold, if it isn't supposed to be, waiting to arrive at your table.   -The bathrooms are always clean and fully stocked.   -The bar is an awesome area where the bartender is super nice and can help you pick the perfect cocktail to complement your choice of cheesecake (or food). -The food ranges from pasta to salads to seafood to anything you can think of.  There is no shortage of options when it comes to this menu!!   Lastly, the music they play is always best enjoyed on the outside patio on a nice afternoon with a glass of wine.  The patio is my choice of seating!!   My only critical review would be that the waiter who brought our cheesecakes to our table reeked of cigarette smoke.  Not such a big fan of the stuff and kind of makes me nauseated.  (Not really a feeling I'm going for after stuffing my face with awesome food) Love this place!!"
Corbin M.,"Charlotte, NC",103,3,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Suggested Cheesecake Factory for a birthday dinner meetup with family from out of town.  We've been coming to CF for years, all over the country for several reasons.  One, variety of the menu.  Two, consistency.  Three, convenience.  You don't go to CF for its uniqueness or specialty menu, you go because you know exactly what you (should) be getting . . . This local CF failed at 2 out of 3 tonight.  Convenience: 30-45 minute wait at 5:50 pm on Sunday that was every bit of 45 minutes, yet plenty of open tables in our section.  Understaffed perhaps.  Followed by excessively slow service.  Forgotten items (missed an app and a side), too long to take orders, too long to bus the table, if at all mid service.  Water refills nonexistent.  This is restaurant 101 stuff. Consistency: failed here too.  Steak undercooked and cold (credit where due, at least it wasn't overcooked), menu items I've had elsewhere simply not the same (a cardinal sin of the dreaded chain restaurant), and in one case the dish was served with a significantly different setup than described on the menu.  All prepared with minimal adequacy.  It was edible but nothing remarkable or even good by CF standards. Saw another table leave in frustration after walking up to the service station for a drink refill for the same reasons: slow, incompetent service. I guess what this Cheesecake Factory has going for it is an anchor location in the local high end mall and a captured audience.  They simply do not need to perform at restaurant fundamentals to continue as a business, people will still fill the place up.  Which is a shame, because CFs can be quite good, when they're not failing at basic functions. Do yourselves a favor and walk over to many of the other almost as close options so this store can just end it already and give up the space to someone who will execute as if they care about their customers."
R L.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",579,933,2423,4.0,7/28/2015,"I like Cheesecake Factory not just for the cheesecakes. Good selection of food for lunch or dinner.  I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo and was able to get brown rice with that which is great. The menu has plenty of burgers, sandwiches, steaks, burritos, etc. good selection of salads as well.  The downside to Cheesecake Factory is the wait to get a table. They are usually pretty busy during normal meal times. I was with a large group and was told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes but we only waited about 20 minutes."
Jonathan F.,"Pineville, NC",0,4,,3.0,9/13/2015,"Im a regular takeout guy, & every time i call its   Long time to pickup the phone, understandable  They're busy but it's consistent. Then as of a few months ago they removed the only dish i ordered every time I call!"
Megan R.,"Charlotte, NC",32,34,12,5.0,5/30/2016,"Now I know why they call it ""the Cheesecake Factory"" BEST cheesecake I ever had.  I ordered the sea salt and Carmel. The menu was literally 35 pages long, so it takes awhile to decide.  I went on a busy weekend night but my husband went up to the bar and ordered us Mai Tais and they were really good, we sat outside on a beautiful night with our mai Tais and people watched, the time went by quickly.  I ordered some spicy shrimp dish that was delicious, the bread was good and they had something for everyone. I will return.  Good service and not overly priced."
Devilsh V.,"Charlotte, NC",1,6,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Think wisely about when you go eat. We went at the beginning of lunch, trying to beat the rush. We were promptly seated, which was great. However, that is where the good news ended. Our server lacked attentiveness. I fully understand being busy; but she definitely made a judgment call and decided our table didn't merit as much attention as other tables. Our food was not hot and had no flavor (I ordered a chicken avocado club). I informed the server and she shrugged, complained about the kitchen and then went back to her other tables. At no point did she make any offers regarding our poorly prepared food. However, she gave the table next to is free cheesecake because they had the same issue. Look, I don't need free cheesecake, but I expect you to acknowledge a complaint about my meal. She then failed to ask us if we needed anything else.  Instead, she brought our checks and moved on. Poor service. I tipped her more than I should have (she deserved a penny, but I gave 10%). I live in the Southpark area and will never return there. Also, it took over 2 hours from start to finish. What's worse? I am still hungry because I did not eat my abysmal food."
SABRINA M.,"Charlotte, NC",67,16,18,2.0,8/19/2016,"I don't know what is going on or what has changed with CheeseCake Factory, but the food and service has become subpar. We ordered appetizers and a salad....EVERYTHING was warm....to include the salad and dressing! This used to be one of my favorite places to eat....I'll just stick to the cheesecake from now on."
