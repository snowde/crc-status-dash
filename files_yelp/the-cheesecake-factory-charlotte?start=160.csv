Chanelle T.,"Aiken, SC",12,81,69,5.0,8/4/2015,"Finally went to this location and didn't have a wait... Apparently going on a Monday around 2:00 is perfect! The staff was very friendly, the food super, like usual & the cheesecake amazing! My kids ordered cheese pizza & spaghetti with meatballs off of the children's menu and the spaghetti was outstanding! I almost wished I had order that for myself! Their appetizer salads are humungous and packed with great veggies! The Mac & cheese burger is out of this world too, very creamy & perfect! My daughters birthday was celebrated here and they brought out the cutest little sundae in a small wine glass and sang to her. Will definitely be returning, hopefully soon!"
Randy B.,"Taylors, SC",108,16,6,5.0,11/10/2015,"The ambiance is the best I have ever seen at a restaurant. The burgers are really good. I get them every time. Also, I am diabetic. They make a low-carb cheese cake made with splenda. I can have cheesecake here! That gets it a 5 by itself.  One of our visit we got a really horrible server. We sent an appetizer back because we misunderstood what it was. After that she transferred us to another waitress. By that time we had already been waiting for our food for 45 minutes and by the time we got it, it was all wrong.  So why the positive review? This was an isolated incident. AND the manager comped the entire meal and gave us free deserts. So yeah, they still rock."
Grace M.,"Greenville, SC",12,162,21,3.0,10/29/2014,"It's always pretty busy because it is attached to the mall, but all in all, the service isn't bad, the food is mediocre, and the cheesecake... Well that's obviously the best part. The only bad part is, the selection is overwhelming. If you can even consider that a bad thing?  When I go, I usually stick to a pasta dish or their meatloaf. Which is my favorite thing there. For their appetizers, I recommend the lettuce wraps.  Expect to wait if you don't make a reservation, but if you get there early enough, or at an ""off"" hour, you won't be waiting long. (Their outdoor seating is nice)."
Robby C.,"Roswell, GA",0,4,,1.0,8/13/2017,"We ate here today, unfortunately.  The food took forever and a day to arrive.  When it finally did arrive it obviously had been living under a heat lamp for most of the time we waited.  I'm surprised it didn't have mold on it.  My wife ordered the ham and cheese omelet.  The cheese was cooked to a crisp...it resembled peanut brittle.  She actually sent it back because it was nasty.  The waitress agreed it was overcooked and placed an order for another one.  The second one took so long we just cancelled our order.  In the time we waited I asked for a water more than three times.  When we left one of my kids left a bag under the chair with a toy in it.  We returned a few minutes later and my wife asked a waiter if he had seen the bag.  He said ""we already threw it in the trash and threw the trash in the dumpster.""  Assuming the guy just didn't want to look for it she said ""so you can't get it back?"" He said ""what do you want me to do, go dumpster diving?""  Besides the fact the waiter was a complete jerk I'm shocked they managed to empty the trash 100x faster than they could deliver the food we ordered.  I will not be going back to the Cheesecake Factory!  Unbelievably bad experience."
Jim G.,"Indianapolis, IN",12,27,5,1.0,8/22/2015,"My daughter has had a terrible experience the last two times she's been to the South Park Cheesecake Factory.  The first time the waiter spilled her fried zucchini and argued about getting more.  The second time she was overcharged for her meal.  We usually go several times a month, but with this horrible service we'll find another restaurant.  There are plenty to choose from in the area."
Bella G.,"Stafford, VA",0,1,,1.0,2/20/2017,"First time we went my family and I waited 1 hour and 45 min -  our pager buzzed and we were told to stand in another waiting section, because there was noone available to walk us to our table - so we stood and waited with the other people who were also waiting to be seated for another 15 minutes. Finally, we get seated...placed our drink and food order and no bread came....we are starving by this time...so we ask for bread...waiting, waiting...bread finally arrives then our food.  ALL of our food was COLD...by this time were are getting frustrated...we tell our waiter and his response upsets all of us. His response was ""all I can do is offer to ""reheat"" it""  REALLY!!! You want to put our food in the microwave!!! So my husband asks to speaks with the manager - our food is remade and its pretty good - we even get free cheesecake. So by the end we are all fine and say we will come back and give it another chance.  Well we went on Friday - only had a 30 minute wait this time - we ordered our food and get our bread (without having to ask). Our food arrives FREAKING COLD AGAIN (pissed and annoyed) my daughter and I decide to send ours back- my husband sucks it up (I ordered the flatbread pizza) my daughter gets her meal back (watery) and I got HALF of my flat bread pizza back with burned edges - YUP, you read it right...HALF of my DAMN pizza was missing and they didn't say shit about it - like it was cool! I did not send it back I paid for the damn meal AND still gave the server his tip - BUT MY FAMILY AND I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!!!!!! PISSED!!!!!!"
Sharee W.,"Glen Allen, VA",33,209,600,2.0,10/20/2015,"I'm not sure what was going on, but this was not a good trip to Cheesecake Factory. We went for lunch and chose to sit outside since it was nice. It took forever for our server to come take our order. When he brought out our water, there was a lot of debris floating in it. We sent them back and the same thing was in the second round. At this point, we all just opted to get soft drinks. Our appetizers were sub par as well. I love the avocado eggrolls at CF, but these were kinda brown looking and sad. The spinach and artichoke dip had a funny taste, I didn't even eat it. We all ended up ordering salads. When they came out, all the lettuce looked a little wilted. Like I said, it wasn't anything like my usual experiences at CF. Maybe it was just an off day...."
SK T.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,14,5.0,1/10/2016,Nice and friendly Bartender.  Jeremy was Awesome and he was a cutie-patootie! Was patient for our order... And quick to check and make sure we were doing good and enjoying our experience.
Devin H.,"Fayetteville, NC",94,85,61,4.0,7/5/2015,"I'll make this short and simple. The wait time was not very bad for a pre-4th of July dinner eating. Only had to wait 45 minutes or so. The food is good, just like and Cheesecake Factory that I have been to...Wait, it's Cheesecake Factory, the food is AWESOME! The only reason that I am giving this 4 stars and not five is that we had an annoying waiter and waitress issue at the beginning of our service. There were 4 people that saw us in the first 10 minutes of being there. We ordered drinks with 3 different people and then almost ordered dinner with two people. Finally when we got our waitress she was awesome! I got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, awesome as usual! P.S. I need to try something new next time. I got the chocolate cake, 5 stars for that! It even tasted better the next day!"
Janeka H.,"Pineville, NC",60,108,163,3.0,5/10/2015,"This is just an OK place.  Every time I try something new, its just OK.  I would rather they have a smaller menu and are able to focus on the taste of their food.  Cheese cake factory is always packed.  I understand if you want to come and have dessert.... But dinner?  Not good, not mind blowing.... Just some mediocre food.   The only dish that I actually really like is the fried Mac and cheese appetizer.   And their desserts are good.   But the food is never worth the wait to get a table."
Tyler A.,"Charlotte, NC",19,206,133,1.0,5/27/2014,"Ugh. Being a student at UNCC, I rarely venture to the South Park area. For my 21st birthday all I wanted to do was eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. We went around 3ish so the wait was only about 5minutes.  Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year.  Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference?  Cheesecake was very good though.  I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged. I work at a restaurant and the boyfriend has a chef for a brother so we both are familiar with the service industry and I will never eat at a place with servers bold enough to readjust tips that have a manager that could care less."
Leigh B.,"Irmo, SC",33,29,52,4.0,7/19/2015,"Great food.. Slow service, I mean really slow bordering on bad service. We went at lunch when the restaurant was not crowded .. I had the lunch Asian chicken lettuce tacos. They were fantastic. The twins ordered kid meals. The first was the chicken tender kids meal. One of the best kids meals I have seen. Highly recommended for kids. The second  kids meal was the burger sliders they were just ok. The kids fries are served in a silver bucket which the kids love. We had for dessert the Oreo cheesecake.. Safe choice for anyone. It was more than enough for one adult and 2 school aged kids."
Cletis M.,"Charlotte, NC",8,61,104,4.0,7/3/2016,Excellent choice for lunch or brunch. I never make it to desert! Extensive menu to choose from.
Laura F.,"Charlotte, NC",4,27,1,1.0,6/3/2016,"Been here several times, but tonight was a first for terrible experience. Arrived after 9pm, so there was no crowds or wait time. Order was taken quickly and the drinks/bread also quickly. That's were the good service ends. Ten, fifteen, twenty, then thirty minutes pass with no food, and no explanation or apology. Waiter only seemed concerned with chatting with friends at a nearby table. At the fourty minute mark, I left. He started to speak like he would be bringing the check for the drink then changed his mind. Offered to send a manager to the front to meet me, but after ten minutes of waiting and watch him goof off with other staff members, I left. I wont cross this restaurant off completely, but if they seat you and your waiter has a man bun, ask to change to another server."
Kara K.,"Charlotte, NC",9,10,11,4.0,5/6/2016,"I recommend the shrimp scampi paired with well...anything. This continues to be my very favorite dish after 20 years. My most favorite version is the traditional way it comes with angel hair pasta, but it's also awesome with one of the combination choices, like the herb crusted salmon. And it's hard to go wrong with any of the cheesecake, of course."
Caleb R.,"Hickory, NC",43,12,5,5.0,6/25/2015,"Absolutely love this place! From the staff to the food, you won't forget the experience you have at this place. Food is always fresh. And don't forget to pick up a few slices of cheesecake before you leave"
Alexis B.,"Denver, NC",0,2,14,1.0,3/18/2016,It didn't take long to be seated (wasn't very busy in there at all) but it took over an hour to receive our cold lunch plates. I had no idea it took that long to assemble a turkey sandwich and a salad. The staff was unapologetic as tables sat down after us and received their food before us. I was very disappointed because I had a high opinion of the restaurant. I left feeling like I had just thrown $50 down the drain. It would take a lot of convincing for us to try this restaurant again.
Haywood W.,"Grovetown, GA",154,2,,5.0,5/29/2016,Sunday brunch was perfect! Had the Belgian waffle and chicken delicious. Of course the cheesecake never fails and the server was prompt and knew the job.
Private P.,"Mooresville, NC",0,4,,2.0,2/20/2016,"I called before and they said they don't do reservations. When I got there, the line was almost out the door with 30-40 people in the lobby alone. I'm almost certain that had to be a fire hazard. Told to come back 30-45 minutes to just get the notifier or my spot would be not in the que anymore. Came back and told another hour and forty five minutes. Total elapsed time to be seated, two hours and fifteen minutes. Our waitress came and was below average for that fancy of a restaurant. Rushed us and came back with my fiances drink in and out of the cup. Got snappy when i asked for clarification on the menu.  Maybe they should consider reservations because the two to three hour wait times are asinine and poor world class service. Another tip, hire staff that will provide world class service. As someone who has worked in customer service for 3 years, this was not world class service. I probably wont be returning and be taking my business elsewhere where i feel valued."
Kalani L.,"High Point, NC",14,30,4,5.0,6/11/2015,"Very extensive menu!!! I had about 5 things I was torn between after reading many reviews but went with what my Dad recommended prior to my first visit...MEATLOAF!! Meatloaf was the  !!! Best I have had out in years and you get so much of it!! Don't get enough of the corn that comes with it and is the bomb also. Got the best cheesecake ever also...had a weird name like Christopher ' s out there cake or something. Was like German chocolate cake but cheesecake....it was so good!!  Out of all the wonderful tempting choices, the ones I made I was highly satisfied with. Be prepared to spend some money but it is a fancy (and frigid) restaurant. Wish they had more locations in NC and more than 1 in the citys  they are in."
