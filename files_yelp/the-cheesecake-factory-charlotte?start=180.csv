Peyton B.,"Wilmington, NC",70,74,10,4.0,3/30/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory before and had a terrible experience. I remember my food tasting horrible... But that was probably 3 years ago. Tonight, I decided to give it another try. The food was delicious and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We eat pretty healthy, so at first glance of the menu, we tried to justify how hard we worked out today, haha! But we ended up finding a few healthier options on their new ""skinnylicious"" menu. My one concern was they don't offer a whole wheat pasta. Why?? They offer so much gluten free, but nothing whole wheat. :("
Kieran M.,"Charlotte, NC",70,339,207,5.0,2/12/2014,"My one student wrote her review for YELP! Club about Cheesecake Factory, so this is actually Fiorella's review (6th grade student): My experience at Cheesecake Factory was very delightful. The service was excellent because our server Angelo was kind and patient when we were ordering. The cleanliness was very good considering the amount of time the servers have to clean the table, since there are so many customers. The time we had to wait to be seated was understandable because Cheesecake Factory is always crowded. Overall my experience was very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends."
Jeff T.,"Bluefield, WV",70,4,3,5.0,7/1/2015,I definitely recommend this place it had one of the best steaks I've had in a while and my wife absolutely love her cheesecake and the service was great love this place!

Evelyn E.,"Goose Creek, SC",2,34,20,4.0,1/1/2015,Loved loved this place...i went mainly for cheesecake. Had the original strawberry cheescake. loved every bit of it. Located at fancy big mall in charllote. The wait to get seated takes long but u can waste time browsing through the stores at the mall. They do not take reservations during holidays like today 1st Jan 2015 very busy
Rishav S.,"Charlotte, NC",0,10,1,4.0,6/10/2015,"Even though we have our dinner any where at South Charlotte, when my wife and we discuss about dessert , the first thing which comes to our mind is ""Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake ( hope I spelled that correctly) .  Any sweet tooth friends out there, do not miss this awesome Cheesecake!!"
L W.,"Charlotte, NC",51,11,2,1.0,10/12/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is my absolute fave restaurant but this is the second time I've been at this location and had sub par service. Tonight was the worst! I ordered one plate of food and it took forever to come out.i ordered chicken and biscuits and it was disgusting. My biscuits were so hard and crunchy that I had to send it back. The manager comes out and says ""we still have your food in the window we haven't thrown it away we can make you fresh biscuits and re plate it"" like really :/ I don't want that. I'm just totally upset and as much as I love this restaurant we won't be back at this location."
Yo B.,"Charlotte, NC",1,32,,2.0,10/12/2016,"Overall, this visit was doodie. We were a party of 5 for a bday dinner, not mine, FYI, Our wait was stated to be 20 minutes but it was more like 45. Waitress was great but food and dessert was very disappointing. Tried a few chicken entrees and very average at best that night. Our cocktails tasted like dirty dishwater and I was not alone in that thinking. Big fan of cheesecake and sweets in general. Tried the new nutella cheesecake but should have stuck with the classic. For the wait and the price, it should have been much better."
Sandra A.,"Charlotte, NC",5,40,38,4.0,11/18/2015,Really great service.  The wait wasn't long even though it was crowded.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our table.  The staff was very kind and attentive despite how busy it was.  Ordered steak that was prepared well.  Martinis were perfect.  They have a lot to choose from and the cheesecake was pretty good.
Mike M.,"Fairfax, VA",1311,108,110,4.0,7/17/2013,"I'd first like to preface my review by saying that I prefer to eat at non-chain restaurants too.  But of the chains, I have a special fondness for the Cheesecake Factory. Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it's lunch time.  I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I can't recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. That's why I think it's always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can't decide on cuisine that night.  The service isn't bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you're a regular you probably won't know who's who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I've had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it.  Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake. It's always terrific.  You know what to expect with the cheesecake factory... huge menu, diverse selection, decent service, great cheesecake."
Joanna G.,"Charlotte, NC",1,28,15,5.0,2/11/2016,Hibatchi steak was delicious!!! I had the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake for dessert because how can you resist their cheesecake options. Very good!!!
Omar H.,"Charlotte, NC",21,2,,1.0,3/28/2016,This is the worsen place I ever been waited 30 mins for a table at 9 pm on a Monday night the service was crappy  l. I ordered a grilled chicken Cobb salad chicken was cold and  waited like almost 30 mins for salad. By the time the food came I didn't want it cause the party of 4 I came with to eat was done with there food. I will never come here ever again food is over priced and over rated. Only good thing was my White Russian and the over priced small price of cheese cake. Then the manager didn't even comp our ticket or any thing. Not that I'm cheep out of being a good business to make some one want to come back if your ever in South Park Charlotte don't come here.   This place is terrible waste of money and didn't enjoy crap at least I had a hour drive home and a new Mac Pro to play with
Maggie V.,"Charlotte, NC",105,93,343,1.0,8/4/2015,"Our girls were begging for us to take them for dinner and cheese cake. We decided to try the out. It was a horrible experience. First the waiter was so busy she never even looked at us or give us ant real atention. She was rushing us to give her the drink order and pushing to order our food as soon we sat down. I hate waiters to rush me before I even have a chace to look at the menu. I ordered a Cesar Salad  wirh Chicken when I started eating I found a long black hair tangled the the lettuce. So gross. Then my daughter's meatball and spaghetti pasta came. OMG! Horrible no taste completely cold and the plate all dirty with this disgusting tomato sauce. Sent it back asked for them to write off from check and the only thing they took out was the salad. The supposed Manager came to the table, a very sloppy looking blonde older woman, never gave eye contact or an apology, just told me she would get me another salad. Another salad? Forget it!  One hair was enough. Our family will never be back to eat here again. A $90.00 check was a complete slap on the face. Very disapointed ."
Mike C.,"Fort Mill, SC",56,307,20,3.0,9/4/2013,"I think the Cheesecake Factory is ok.  Nothing magical, but nothing terrible you know?  I went in on Labor Day at 2:00 thinking the crowd would have died down....but guess again it was freakin packed!!! 30 minute wait, which I guess in the grand scheme of Cheesecake Factory wait times wasn't too bad.  The people watching during the wait is always interesting and the massive amounts of food and cheesecake that pass me always make me wonder what kind of money this place makes. The service was great, very attentive and friendly.  One thing I do like is the variety of food offered which is both good and bad, I guess.  We had the avocado eggrolls which are pretty tasty, I don't want to know how many calories were in them but nice chunks of avocado fried in an egg roll wrapper were complimented by a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. I had the mushroom burger which frankly was very good.  It was well put together with very flavorful mushrooms and swiss cheese.  The cover the burger in some kind of wine sauce which was welcomed.  Fries....nasty.  Too much salt ruined them. We skipped on the cheesecake (I know, blasphemy) but I figured I gorged on too many calories as it was and wanted to be able to look myself in the mirror afterwards."
Anise D.,"Charlotte, NC",0,8,9,4.0,5/17/2015,"My best friend loves coming here because of the assortment of Cheesecake available.The quality of service and food remains consistent every time we come. Never disappointed with what I order it always works out. One of my favorite appetizers are the lettuce chicken wraps.   But forget about getting into this place for any special occasions like Valentine 's or Mother's day. Its literally crowds waiting to get in, you would think the restaurant was giving away cheesecake for free. This place stays active considering it's the only location in Charlotte. I just dislike the long wait to be seated but overall it's a restaurant for a good time with friends and a variety of entrees at a reasonable price."
Rachel O.,"Columbia, SC",208,207,924,2.0,11/17/2012,"I don't usually review chains but this was my 1st experience there & I was very disappointed. First off,  the restaurant is very nice looking.  I liked the ambiance from my point of view in the lobby.  When we were seated... not as much.  We were tucked in this little alley off to the side of the bar that led to what I'm sure was a nicer room that looked out into the parking lot.  We couldn't see much from where we were sitting except the waiters running back and forth and the little area where they entered orders on the computer.  But I'm jumping ahead... we got there a few minutes before 7 and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  Some people coming in after us were told up to an hour and a half! I know this because the pager/beeper they give you is only active IN their lobby.  So there were about 50-70 people all standing around this lobby starring at each other and the cheesecake in the case.  Not cool. Finally our beeper went off and then we were told to stand in a certain spot to wait for our name to be called. More waiting.  Then we were taken to our little alley table. The menu is 21 pages long.  And then there is a Skinnylicious menu on top of that. Ridiculous.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  It was fine.  I've had better. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken.  It was OK. Again... I've had better. Boyfriend got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce I didn't taste it but he said it was fine but nothing he would crave again later - and that he liked another pasta dish from another restaurant much better. We each ordered a slice of cheesecake.  I got the Chocolate mouse cheesecake which I thought would be light and fluffy but no.  It was very heavy. It was very expensive in my opinion.  We both got water, we shared an app, each had an entree and a piece of cheesecake and this came to $71 after tip.  For what we got? It was not worth it at all.   2 stars on Yelp means ""Meh. I've experienced better."" That is exactly right in this case.  We will most definitely not be back."
Gary A.,"Clearfield, UT",1,47,,3.0,3/7/2016,"I am usually a Cheesecake Factory fan, but my experience this time was only sub-par.  I arrived at 12:30 pm on Sunday and the wait was over 1 hour.  I realize this isn't the fault of the restaurant, but that time just seemed excessive.  I was actually seated in about 35 minutes.    I ordered the Salmon and Steak Diane combo and asked for the Miso salmon instead of the herb salmon and the server said that would be okay.  They have done it for me in the past and I figured they would do it again.   Well, they brought out my meal with the herb salmon and I was sadly disappointed.  The server seemed a little busy and a bit disheveled.   I tried their special salted caramel cheesecake.   It may be my new favorite one.   The cheesecake is work 5 stars, but the service and food brought it down to 3."
Elizabeth A.,"Charlotte, NC",167,109,235,4.0,4/7/2013,"I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is definitely way above par for your normal chain. The menu is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.  The menu is also HUGE. Part of that monstrosity is advertisements (annoying!) but there really is a ton to choose from. I have weekly (if not daily) day dreams about the Avocado Egg Rolls. Holy moly this appetizer rocks my world! Yes, it's an appetizer, but I actually order it as my entree, whoops. These rolls are chocked full of crazy amounts of flavor and texture. The middle is gooey and savory and the outside is crispy and delicious. And the dipping sauce, some sort of cilantro chutney... SHUT UP! It's amazing. I also really enjoy the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes appetizer. These little babies are sweet and salty at the same time. Very filling. Nice presentation. My favorite appetizer salad is the French Country Salad. Veggie friendly and delish. The only thing I've had here I have NOT enjoyed was Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It's pretty boring and lackluster, I do not recommend. And last but definitely not least, their namesake... the CHEESECAKES. Oh lord. Yes, It's okay to come here just for cheesecake. No one will judge you. I would like to say I've tried them all. Unfortunately I'm in love with the Tiramisu and order it EVERY time. Except for in the fall and winter when The Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake is in season."
Ana O.,"Charlotte, NC",116,328,28,2.0,8/28/2013,"I am sure that this is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory as far as things go.  Maybe I'm not a fan of this location or maybe I'm not a fan of this chain period, but my last few experiences here have left me disappointed. One positive thing I can say is that they have an extensive menu.  In general, you would be hard-pressed not to find something you are in the mood to eat.   However, I've gone in there before and nothing has sounded appetizing - maybe it's just too many selections.  I can say that they have decent (but pricey) salads and I had good fish and chips from there.  I went there with a party and my boss ordered the barbecue salmon, which was WAY too salty for her. This was a day we were out to celebrate a co-worker leaving and had a party of four.  We waited almost 20 minutes to get seated, and then another 20 minutes almost before we could order.  By the time our food had arrived, we had been there over an hour.  This was lunch time, which was frustrating.  Our lunch there lasted over an hour and a half by the time we got dessert. As far as their cheesecake goes, this has been the biggest disappointment.  It used to be you paid $8 and got huge pieces which were big enough for two to share.  However, my piece last time was about half the size it had been before.  It looks like they are trying to scale back on the sizes.  And when I thought about it, I got one of the specialty cheesecakes and so only about a third of it was actual cheesecake, and the rest of it had toppings woven in.  Not on TOP, as you would expect, but cutting into the piece of cheesecake itself.  The cheesecake part was not as good as it should have been for the price. This location is swanky and nice, but every time I've been the service was very slow.  And since getting dessert and a lunch special was over $20 at lunch time, it seems a little too pricey for the quality of food and service you get there.  For me, ""meh"" just kind of describes how I feel about this Cheesecake Factory location."
Ash B.,"Charlotte, NC",71,11,10,4.0,8/4/2014,The past few times I've eaten here the food has been amazing! This includes brunch and lunch. I didn't expect the brunch items to be that great but I was wrong!  A must try is the Baja Chicken Hash or the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!  My new favorite lunch item there is the Miso Salmon!! Can't wait to go back! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of how long it takes to get your appetizer/food.
