Kalisa P.,"Charlotte, NC",1,20,25,5.0,6/3/2014,I've been here like maybe 5 times and I still love this place. They have a wide variety of food. It's a very nice place. The only bad thing is sometimes the wait because this place always has people. Of course it's mostly on like Friday and weekends that the wait is longer but I still love this place. It actually may be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.
V M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,13,,2.0,12/13/2015,"Only go for the desserts! The food is only okay. I've read reviews about the ""ambience"".....what ambience? The initial set of silverware that I'm given is always dirty. Even the ""clean"" silverware looks like it's seen better days along with the plates. The finish is coming off the tables. These things make me wonder about their overall cleanliness. The bathrooms are dimly lit so who knows what they're hiding in there. I hadn't been there in a while for these reasons; however, I popped in today for a quick bite while shopping and nothing has changed. I was given dirty silverware, there was something floating in my water and my food that was served on a really stratched up plate was only okay.  Just grab your dessert to go and use plastic utensils!"
Grier M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,5.0,6/1/2016,I usually only write bad reviews but as you can see by the stars this is not the case. The food overall was good. Not great and not terrible. My salad was excellent but my girlfriend wasn't a fan of her sandwich. We also got two apps and cheesecake afterwards. What I really want to talk about was our service. It was incredible. I think our waitresses name was Lynn (could be wrong). She was very engaging and knowledgable about the long menu. We asked a lot of questions I mean a lot and she answered all of them and was very patient. We eat out way too much and this was the best service we have had in a long time. I'm done. Food was good service was fantastic! We do not eat at the cheese factory and only went because we had a gift card. We would have never gone there but would go again because we had an awesome waitress. If only everyone was loving life like she was!
Jeff H.,"Lidingö, Sweden",73,33,13,1.0,8/2/2015,"This was the worst experience I have had at Cheesecake Factory. I have been several times and LOVED it. This time we got the appetizers after 30 minutes and then only got 2/3 of them and then they served the first dinners with the 3rd appetizer. We had to ask the waitress 3 times for our bottles of water before we got it. The manager came out and apologized for the appetizer coming out so late, and that's fine, of course no problem, that stuff happens. But then the waitress had to be asked three times for the water and we never got out coffee with our cheesecake (which of course was awesome!). I'm shocked at the service and quality. Hope it was just a one off incident or that will be the last time I go. Shame as its my favorite place to go in Charlotte when I come home."
Melanie M.,"Charlotte, NC",21,5,2,5.0,5/5/2015,"Love,love love great place to eat at obviously, because it never fails always crowded.  But other than that the food is spectacular, the staff are friendly and seems to be un bother by the pack house, which indicates they very professional and use to it and able to handle it. Food melts in your mouth my go to place when I just need some good, good food."
Maita B.,"Durham, NC",73,52,1,5.0,6/20/2014,"I have been to numerous places and had different quality service.  My server, Adrianha, at Cheesecake Factory was among the best.  She is very attentive and friendly and was very patient with my table as it took us a while to order since we were catching up. I ordered on the light side and had a Fresh Kale Salad and Lettuce Wraps which were both really good.  Each plate had just the right amount of crunch and tasted fresh.  I highly recommend Cheesecake Factory at SouthPark."
Richard M.,"Gaffney, SC",130,16,3,5.0,9/1/2015,Food was amazing as always. Took cheesecake and leftovers home which were still awesome the next day!!
La'Marcus T.,"Richburg, SC",0,2,,1.0,5/29/2016,Bruh y'all slow as ever my girl food was cold as hell. The service was beyond weak. I ordered my food went out to the mall and came back and my food still wasn't here. My girl noodles looked like a damn mop head. I can't even deal dude. Oh and my friend found a silverback gorilla hair in her food. The nerve of you people. Never again
Chad M.,"Orlando, FL",9,24,8,2.0,3/21/2015,Whoever manages the lines for ordering cheesecake and the cash register needs to be fired.  The food is good but try running the business and managing expectations instead of pissing all your customers off.
Bruce K.,"Knoxville, TN",420,649,1234,3.0,1/20/2012,"Cheesecake. Yes, that's what they're famous for.. And probably the only thing that I will eat here as everything is overpriced and the food is just okay. I came here with a group of friends weeks ago for a get together. I just ordered a drink and my brother ordered a cheesecake and calamari which I shared with. The calamari wasn't bad as it was deep fried like any other restaurant that serves calamari. Cheesecake was wonderful, apple caramel streusel. It was sweet but it wasn't to the point where my mouth was dry (then again I had Long Islands that helped me wash it down.) One of my other friends ordered a burger, and honestly to come here to order a burger isn't really a bright idea. The portions are definitely not worth the amount that you're paying, however this is a ""high class"" restaurant. And be sure to watch out on the floors. They're super greasy/slippery, as soon as you walk out of the main area and to your chairs. It seems as if you're walking on some dried oil or grease, it's kind of nasty to not think that they would not mop the floors every night. Overall, I would give it a 2.5/5 but since Yelp has stars I'll round it and give it a 3, just because that cheesecake was pretty good. But, you won't find me a regular here."
Mac W.,"Charlotte, NC",11,25,3,5.0,5/25/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory, and this visit was no different. About a 20/30 min wait turns into being seated within 10. Sat with Sid as our waiter, and he was spot on. Quick diligent service, and amazing food. Thank you again. Sid should get a raise!!! I'll be back for sure!"
Holly S.,"Wilmington, DE",0,51,53,4.0,5/9/2014,"Went for dinner after my cousin's graduation. We had a party of 16 and they were very accommodating. We had two servers and they were both very good. Everything came out promptly and they kept our tables clean and drinks full. Food was great which I have come to expect from Cheesecake Factory. Everyone enjoyed their food and of course most of us took cheesecake to go. Our one server (Mike?) was a riot, he felt like one of the gang and I'm sure we drove him a little nuts with how big our group was, but he was awesome! Thanks for another great dining experience Cheesecake Factory!"
M T.,"Charlotte, NC",25,50,40,4.0,10/14/2013,"Thai lettuce wrap is  ! It's like your own little build your own lettuce wrap station. Cheesecake wise, the red velvet cheesecake is delicious.. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I do recommend sharing the slice of cheesecake because the slices are good size but a little too sweet to finish it on your own. I think it's a cute place to have a date"
Rob B.,"Charlotte, NC",0,9,,2.0,8/29/2015,"Granted they were busy, but the service was lacking and slow.  My water glass was consistently empty.   Chicken marsala and bow tie pasta:  chicken was good but the pasta was completely dry and blah.   Bang bang chicken and shrimp:  way too much coconut flavor, overly sweet.   Id say my wife and I left about half of our plates un-eaten. Ordered coffee and cheesecake.  Cheesecake was good, coffee didnt show up until after we finished the cheesecake.  Again poor service. All of that for $52.  Not worth it for a big plate of mostly plain dry bow tie pasta and the other mostly rice.  Wont be going back."
Katie N.,"Charlotte, NC",108,12,,2.0,5/30/2015,"Definitely not a good experience - the food was decent, well, our appetizers at least.  The entree was nothing we couldn't have gotten inside the mall at the food court. The waitress was sweet as could be but admittedly kept forgetting us, we had to ask/remind her for everything from bread to silverware to even ordering the entree. We decided to order our cheesecake on our own at the front register thinking it'd be faster....  Twenty minutes later we regretted that choice. Our overall dinner started at 830 and it took us until 11 to walk out the door.. Last trip to this restaurant for us."
Bill W.,"Fort Mill, SC",0,28,3,3.0,8/15/2015,Gene was great as our waitor.  Can't say the same for my Orange Chicken.  The chicken and rice was dry and boring. No spice and hardly any flavor. I have had better at the local Chinese restaurants and Jo Jo China Bistros. Try anything else but this dish.
Darrylyn B.,"Hickory, NC",6,49,23,4.0,12/28/2014,"I enjoy dining at many of The Cheesecake Factory locations. I have tried many different appetizers and entrees and have yet to be disappointed. My alcohol infused drink was quite tasty, my skinnyliciuos chicken tacos were fresh and flavorful, and the Chris Cheesecake was delicious! I will agree with some of the reviewer's that the wait can be long and tiresome on a Saturday night. But you have to consider the amount of patrons and the establishment is not that big. I wouldn't necessarily say it was not worth the wait. And as another poster mentioned ""Applebee's crowd"" that pretentious a-hole should take his business elsewhere. I read of a decent, good and kind hearted man who is known and loved by many to this day who never judged and would not judge people, his initials are J.C. Maybe some of you know him, doubt the pretentious poster does."
Trisha W.,"Belle Chasse, LA",6,35,1,4.0,4/29/2015,"The wait was pretty long, but that was expected as it was Saturday night and we didn't make reservations.  The food was fabulous.  Cheesecake was the best as usual.  I love having enough food leftover for a midnight snack!"
Liliya I.,"University City, San Diego, CA",0,3,2,5.0,6/19/2015,I've never had a bad dish here!  Not to mention the amazing desserts!  I absolutely love their avocado rolls.  The only negative part is that their menu is so extensive that it makes it very difficult to choose.  Love the atmosphere and the food.  A must place to try!
Jorge N.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,1,1.0,12/24/2014,"This place was our late night go-to spot. When I say late night, I mean after 10. Usually good service and good food.  Last night the service was bad. The server was more focused on socializing with her coworkers than providing service.  Our food was cold, the bread was cold. The Sangria I ordered was so watered down it tasted like water with food coloring."
