Faith D.,"Charlotte, NC",165,1120,761,3.0,3/18/2012,"When you are in need of a slice of sweet sugary deliciousness, The Cheesecake Factory has got you covered. It's a staple ""nice restaurant"" sure to please even the pickiest of eaters...their menu is like a novel, granted half of it is full of advertisements.  You can quickly turn to the lunch menu, page 8. The portions are plenty and will run you around $10, give or take. However, their regular beverages will run you a solid $4. A nice perk is that they serve their ""chocolate and vanilla"" bread (that's only how my friend's daughter describes it, not the flavor) anytime of day, whether you eat lunch or dinner. They do not have very many vegetarian options, but they do have a veggie burger filled with brown rice and beets.  This location is prime...after a fun shopping spree at South Park, you can relish the day on their open patio! Service was attentive and friendly and the people working the host desk were all smiles.  I don't go here often, but it's one of my mom's favorites and when nothing but cheesecake will suffice it is my go to place (a slice will cost you approximately $10). Like me and everyone else the day I was here, you'll leave full and happy with a ""to go"" bag in hand with a slice of deliciousness for later."

Torrie J.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",0,2,,5.0,5/3/2015,Love this place always good food!! And a good tip is the high top tables are seat yourself!!
Ben G.,"Charlotte, NC",0,13,,5.0,9/30/2015,Miso Salmon is simply amazzzing!!! Dont have to mention regarding cheescakes! Always busy!!!
Nikki W.,"Charlotte, NC",68,68,26,4.0,8/1/2013,"This review isn't about the Cheesecake Factory themselves but a props to their happy hour. We all know Cheesecake Factory... big portions. An extensive menu. Stark white shirts that I have no clue how every server keeps them bright white all shift. But have you ever been by for happy hour?! Best in Charlotte. Hands down.  Post up at the bar (HH only at the bar) and grab a menu. About a dozen different options, all from the Cheesecake Factory's regular appetizer menu all for $5 each. Chris and I decided to get the tex mex eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They delivered the dishes and damnnn... full-sized plates. And if you've ever been to CCF you know how much food that is - and for $5! I couldn't believe it wasn't smaller HH portions! The buffalo blasts were piled high - 8 to the plate. And is a crispy, fluffy, deep fried pocket. Bite in and it is filed with juicy grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. And as a huge lover of all things spicy, I was in love. I recommend with sour cream. Awesome cooling effect to the buffalo. We ended up eating 3 of the blasts and 4 out of the 6 eggrolls. Packed a to-go box and left highly satisfied.  Only downside, I work in Uptown and the happy hour here goes from 4 to 6pm. To get to South Park after work is always a challenge so if I have my heart set on some buffalo blasts, need to slip out a bit early. And you must sit at the bar. Which consists of 10 seats. Not always the easiest seat in the house to get!"
Victoria W.,"Charlotte, NC",57,767,1164,4.0,3/29/2013,"This place is 4.5 stars for me. I've been coming here for many years ever since they opened. This place is ALWAYS crowded during dinner time, if you come around 6-8 you will probably have to wait unless if you made a reservation, this is particularly true on the weekends. I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you've had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls. The cheesecakes are around $6-8 per piece. Very large size served on a large plate, can be shared among 2-3 people. Drinks are around $7-12, pretty good as well, great mixed drinks."
Jeremy P.,"Marshall, NC",3,55,3,4.0,7/28/2013,"Me and my family visited The Cheesecake Factory for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  First off, we are not from Charlotte and we do not have a Cheesecake factory near our house.  We are Big Bang Theory super fans so when we saw it we knew we had to try it.   If you are like us and have never been or saw one other than on the show, then you will be in for a big surprise too!   Atmosphere:  We arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night.  The wait was minimal even though it was pretty busy.  We requested outside seating since it was a perfect night for it, and were escorted right out.  Tables were nice, and had a small candle on it for a nice little touch.  The building the restaurant is located in is very nice as well.  Very upscale looking and a classy place overall.  Much different vibe and style than was in the show.  ( Hang with me through the BBT show comments, I am sure others are wondering the same as we were. )  8/10 Menu and Price Point:  As most others have mentioned the menu is very very extensive.  You would be really hard pressed to not find something that you like.  Very detailed which I like because I am a picky eater, and nicely laid out considering the size of the menu.  As for price, I got the Penne, My wife got the Chicken and Biscuits (think chicken pot pie), and my daughter just wanted cheese sticks.  We also got 1 piece of the Oreo Dream cheesecake and the total bill was 53.00 and some change.  Not too bad considering the portions are huge and the food was very tasty.  7/10 Service:  When we first walked in the greeter was not super friendly like most places of that caliber but, when we were seated things changed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and super helpful.  He was very attentive despite being pretty busy, and took the time to talk to us and offer suggestions.  He even addressed my daughter who is 10, which most of the time wait staff just look at us for her order.  I liked that and i think she did too.  8/10 Food:  The food was very good.  Like i mentioned above my daughter got an appetizer for her main meal which was the Cheesesticks.  She liked them and even made the comment she wished there was more.  On a couple they were overcooked a little but she didnt complain and just peeled off the coating.  My wife had the Chicken and Biscuits and she really enjoyed it and gives it a 8/10.  She could only eat about half a quarter of it due to the sheer amount she was given.  I got the Penne Pasta, and it was cooked perfect for me.  It was a little short on sauce but really was very tasty.  I did add a little salt, and I asked the waiter for some Parmesan cheese and he brought out a block and grated some fresh for me right at the table.  Im a big guy and I couldn't eat it all due to the portion size.  8/10 for me on the pasta.   I will definitely be back for me on my next visit.   P.S.... Haven't tried the cheesecake yet but its a massive slice."
Joe P.,"Charlotte, NC",88,439,263,3.0,9/7/2013,"I used to think this was the best restaurant in the universe. Thankfully, my dining tastes have come a long way since college. The cheesecake is divine, the entrees decent, but this place in NO WAY is worth a 40-minute wait at 5:30 on a Saturday night. Not to mention, the service sucks and the clientele was, um ... Let's just say Cheesecake Factory is 'fine dining' for the Applebee's crowd."
Scotty S.,"Concord, NC",103,173,360,4.0,1/3/2014,What's not to love about Cheesecake Factory!!! Been there several times (due to my fiance dragging me to South Park for shopping) and every single time the food was awesome. I tend to order their sandwiches as my fiance tends to get their entrees. I've only had one complaint (plain onions instead of the caramelized ones advertised on the menu) but it was minor.  The service is awesome and the wait times have been short for us (under 5 mins). The star of the menu is the dessert selection. Can't go wrong with any of their cheesecake options.  So much to try so we will definitely be returning....often!
Sydney A.,"Charlotte, NC",209,137,148,2.0,9/14/2011,"Overall I don't really mind the cheesecake factory.  I just think that if you're looking for a nice place to eat there are MUCH better options that something attached to the South Park Mall.   The wait is always atrocious and even when you do have reservations it's doubtful that you'll actually get seated on time.  The food is overpriced for the quality you are getting.  The waitstaff is nice but they are busy because the place is enormous. The atmosphere is corny.  I can't think of any other way to describe it. Do yourself a favor and take a look around when you walk in there.  Stop being a stereotypical American and go eat at an independently owned shop.  My bet is you will be much happier, eat about 2,000 less calories, and get out the door for a heck of a lot cheaper! If you really need a piece of cheesecake - get it to go."
Steve B.,"Bamberg, SC",0,32,6,4.0,1/8/2016,"We were going to be in the area and my wife wanted to eat here. Wow, what a beautiful Resturant. We took the advice of another Yelper and ate dinner at another restaurant and stopped by for desert. It was around 2:00, and were seated immediately. As stated in another review the wait staff was indeed ""stuffy"", but that's ok. The Resturant decor is beautiful. We both had a drink,mixed to perfection. I decided to have the Ahi tuna Tatar appetizer, and we split a slice of 30th anniversary pie. The tuna was 1-3/4"" of avocado with 4 pieces of tuna, no bigger then the end of my little finger, on top. But that's ok. The Resturant is beautiful. The pie was the real hit, and was enjoyed to the last crumb. The bill for two drinks, 1 appetizer, and 1 slice of pie $38. When we left the Resturant we both busted out laughing. We couldn't imaging what the bill would have been if we had eaten lunch. By the way a slice of pie is just under $9.00. A whole pie is $$50.00. Again the Resturant decor is beautiful."
Rachel B.,"Charlotte, NC",209,211,92,4.0,1/3/2013,"Best chain ever. Yes, it's a chain and yes there's tons of local eats, but I argue that there is no place where a party of 20 people can get everything they're looking for, no matter what they like, what dietary restrictions they have and what they're in the mood for. The mood lighting at night is great for a romantic dinner that isn't too intimate (no pressure!) or a nightcap and cheesecake (sexy!). The hours are later than most other places in the area, too, so if you're running to grab a bite after a movie or something, the Factory is a great option. I tend to battle between getting the Thai Lettuce Wraps (fresh, quality, delish!) and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, no cucumbers, but almost always get both because I can't stop myself. Sure it's way too much food but these are things that I sometimes DREAM about. And sure there are vietnamese and thai places that carry the lettuce wraps in town but I've tried and every time I'm left yearning for that tamarind cashew sauce.  BRB, drooling. --------------- And, I'm back! So yes, the service is always attentive but the waits can be long, especially at peak dinner hours and all day Saturday & Sunday during mall hours. The bar is fully stocked, bathrooms always clean (and posh!), and the outdoor patio makes for a pretty nice summer lunch spot too. They've got a bar bites menu that's available to keep it light on the pockets, and of course more cheesecakes than should be legal to tempt you into ordering just 1..... ok, 2 slices."
Amber C.,"Charlotte, NC",0,12,1,4.0,2/14/2016,"They have a vast menu, so I've tried a lot of the items. My favorites are Sheila's chicken and avocado salad, miso salmon, and Jamaican black pepper shrimp and chicken. I ordered chicken and biscuits at my last visit and was a little disappointed due to the gravy being filmy and the biscuits being a little to hard for my liking, but that has been my only ""not so great"" visit over the last few years."
Fay B.,"Concord, NC",9,64,,4.0,7/23/2013,"The ""short novel"" that is the menu boasts a huge variety.  If you can't find something you like here, maybe you don't really like anything. I have never had bad service or bad food.  I love their small plates and the cheesecake is OMG!  If I have a friend visiting, I almost always make it by here just because the restaurant is so pretty inside.  Check them out, they're a nice place!"
Amy C.,"Charlotte, NC",71,355,145,3.0,7/15/2013,"I have to say, first, that the customer service that I received at The Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond, definitely.  My server was excellent and after an issue with a dish, the manager who visited my table also went way beyond what most would have bothered with, in particular since it's The Cheesecake Factory and losing one customer would seemingly not be a big deal, since I arrived at 5:15 on a Thursday evening to a packed house.   I haven't been to the Factory in years.  I don't like going to the mall and I don't like waiting an inordinate amount of time to be seated.  I had a craving for cheesecake, so I made a run here after work.  Since it's attached to SouthPark mall, there seems to never be any down time at all.  Even upon my early arrival I had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  No biggie, I was seated within 5 or so minutes and instantly greeted by my server, Bonnie, who was absolutely fantastic.  She had her hands full and the section was completely booked, but she did a fantastic job.  I heard a table near me compliment how well she did, after she returned to thank them for what I assume was an extra-large tip. The food: Fried cheese sticks:  6 triangles.  Thick breading, nice melty cheese.  Marinara that was served with was meh.  Tasted weird, kind of plain, but nothing offensive.   Fried chicken salad:  When they first opened this location, this was my go-to order.  Huge ""normal"" salad with fried chicken on top of it.  In the many years it has been since my last visit, the recipe has changed and I was not a fan of the new way.  The menu said ""mixed greens"" and I forgot that kale is no longer just a garnish.  Too much kale, way too much kale.  But the fried chicken served with it was quite good, as was the corn and pecans with the honey mustard dressing.  I picked through the salad, but it was mostly kale, so I just ate the chicken.  My server noticed and said she would bring me something else, but I told her it was my misunderstanding, no big deal, I ate all of the chicken and a few pieces of lettuce and that was fine.   Turtle cheesecake:  Eh.... it was okay.  Creamy cheesecake with a healthy swirl of whipped cream.  Large dollop of a thick chocolate cream on top, plenty of nuts.  It was fine.   The server let the manager (I believe he said his name was Johann) know about the salad and he came by the table and told me that had been taken off of my bill.   I told him as well that it wasn't necessary as I ate all of the chicken and what I could of the salad.  He again said it was taken care of and if I had any other problems to let him know.  Very nice and totally unexpected.  Excellent customer service. I don't know when I will return, but the great job by my waitress and the manager on duty definitely left a very positive reflection on the place, I just wish the food was as good as the staff."
Cindy A.,"New Orleans, LA",16,80,17,5.0,1/5/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to work near one in Seattle and was somewhat of a regular.  After moving to Louisiana, I have to travel a minimum of five hours to get to one.   On my way to Virginia over the holidays, we drove through Charlotte specifically so that we could go to CF.   This location of CF is by far, the best I have ever been.  We had an awesome booth all the way in the back (read -- away from all the noise).  Our server was friendly and helpful.  The food at this location was great!  Hot, huge portions and there was no skimping when we asked for extra sauce for our dishes (a must if you are a sauce freak like we are). My daughter had her usual farfalle pasta (chicken, mushrooms, peas and some other stuff) and I had the chicken madeira (chicken, mozzarella, madeira sauce, asparagus and smashed taters).  It was all soooooooooooooo delicious!!   We ordered one cheesecake -- the banana -- which is served with freshly sliced bananas.  It's now my second favorite to the lemon with raspberry glaze.   When CF comes to Baton Rouge or New Orleans, my life will be complete.  Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I will be stupendously thrilled. My recommendations --  Thai lettuce wraps (enough for a meal or appetizer to share) and then something from the specialties page, pasta or salad.  Skip the stuff that you can get anywhere any day of the week (burger)."
Caroline G.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2015,"I've been to the cheesecake factory in Seattle and Bellevue several times. I had been to this one for Sunday brunch before, and the food was good. However, this past experience was terrible. The wait was ridiculously unjustified for the quality of food we were served. The coke was without syrup twice in a row, basically watered down coke. I didn't complain the second time, the third time the coke was brought, the glass was so dirty I was disgusted to have drunk out of it. When the food finally arrived it tasted bland and almost as if it had been reheated. The angel hair was stuck together to the point where it needed to be cut into squares. I'm disappointed and don't plan on going back."
Jen G.,"Reno, NV",57,394,342,4.0,5/16/2011,"The wait is always long (unless you get there before noon on Sunday, then not so bad). The servers are usually experienced and very good. The extensive menu has been perfected over the past twenty years (good gawd, I am getting OLD!) and the drinks are usually strong and comparably priced. As much as I loooove good cheesecake (really, I'd eat it off the floor a'la Friends) I rarely get any b/c I'm so stuffed from my Chinese Chicken Salad (or Caesar), the addicting bread & butter and sampling whatever delish dish my hubby ordered. Maple glazed pork tenderloin is excellent (and I do not eat pork.) Spicy Cashew Chicken has been a favorite of mine for years. However, when I do get dessert I will likely order the ADAM's PB CUP FUDGE RIPPLE. Oh sweet jesus..if I were still single, this cheesecake could easily make up for the lack of a man! Cheesecake Factory is great for dates, brunch (HUGE omelets), girl's night out and business meetings. The only reason I did not give this location five stars is b/c (in my opinion) it's hard for any chain to achieve that status but most important, they did not go above/beyond w/a very special request to just this once take a reservation from an out of country visitor. The woman flew all the way from Trinidad, here's her passport and ticket, just got off the plane and the first thing she wants is to eat there; can we NOT make her wait two hours??? I spoke w/the manager a few days ahead of time and he wouldn't make any effort to help. As a long term customer I was very disappointed in his lack of customer service and that has stayed w/me...I haven't been back since. :("
Jaime R.,"Charlotte, NC",2,29,2,3.0,6/21/2014,"There is no denying the food is wonderful here. This review is about service. My girlfriend for lunch here on Saturday afternoon and we set the bar. I have the skinny menu in my hand and order the skinny shrimp summer rolls. If it comes out and I wondered why they were so big. After eating one, I asked the bartender if they were indeed the skinny ones. She said no, they were the regular ones but the only difference was there was more and they are bigger.  She asked me if it was too much food. I told her yes, that was why ordered the skinny ones.  She said oh sorry I didn't hear you say that. I get the bill and they charged for the regular ones. And they weren't going to fix it until I said something. Things like that drive me absolutely insane. I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't want or order. I brought the bartenders attention, his demeanor immediately changed. RUDE."
Khalia B.,"West Hollywood, CA",11,185,18,5.0,6/16/2014,"Today I was a bit disappointed in my experience at the Cheesecake Factory. I couldn't get cheesecake because my trainer took me there to reward me for working so hard. What a scrumptious delight it would have been to get a slice of Snickers or the Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple cheesecake. Hmmm, those so good I want to slap my momma. Instead, I indulged on the Cajun Chicken Jambalaya and the brown bread. The waitress filled up my Sprite three times. ( Too much soda, I know.) We were seated immediately and given exemplary service."
