Jessie N.,"Charlotte, NC",15,3,,2.0,1/21/2015,"I've had better... I went for the Asian Salad on the ""skinny"" menu. It was ok, really large portions, but lacking flavor. Panera does a better asian salad."
S R.,"Pineville, NC",0,52,8,1.0,8/14/2014,"This  CF location has gone down in the last year or so. We have noticed several service issues, especially when dining in the bar area.  At our last outing, our server took almost 10 minutes to come to the table after we sat down to greet us, pass out menus and take drink orders. She was slow to bring drinks, didn't bring a side salad that was requested before the meal. The food was subpar, and they totally botched my order by giving me the wrong dish.  Everyone's food also arrived lukewarm, like it had been sitting for a while. We did address it with the manager who was apologetic and discounted the bill. We were treating an out of town guest who had never been to CF before and were totally embarrassed that we had brought him here. We walked out thinking we should have gone somewhere else in the South Park area. Eating out is becoming more and more of a luxury and it is disappointing when you got out expecting a nice dining experience and  get bad service and bad food. We will not be returning to CF anytime soon and I can no longer recommend it. UPDATED :10/13/14- After making a complaint on the the company website regarding the above visit, we were sent a $25 e Gift  card. We redeemed the card at brunch  about a week a ago and had a good meal and great service. We intentionally sat in the restaurant, not the bar area. I don't know if I would ever have meal service in the bar area again. IMHO the servers are better trained in the restaurant area than those that serve in the bar area."
B N.,"Charlotte, NC",10,30,1,4.0,4/17/2015,"The only reason I am writing this review for a corporate restaurant is because at this location,  I had the best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  From the service to the timing and deliciousness of each and every course, the time spent here was well worth it. Also, at the time we visited, around 4pm on a week day... there wasn't a wait."
Stefanie L.,"Charlotte, NC",68,71,9,2.0,7/19/2013,"Perhaps I expected too much.  It is pretty hyped up.   The food was OK (I got the Shepherd's Pie, Artichoke Dip, and my friend got one of the sandwiches). It was just so busy that we felt like we were being herded like cattle, and the service was pretty disappointing."
Maureen B.,"Charlotte, NC",20,138,13,2.0,6/24/2013,"I want to preface this review by admitting I didn't want to come here and I don't like chain restaurants like this, but someone we were going out to eat with really wanted to go here. The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast. We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why... I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.   We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part. Overall, it was pretty much what I expected from a place like this."
Marshall R.,"Columbia, SC",7,8,2,4.0,2/11/2014,"I've been there twice and it's a good place to go on a nice date. I prefer the places that are more casual or they have their own thing going on, but I won't hold that against The Cheesecake Factory. This place is obviously known for their cheesecake, in case you couldn't figure that out by the name of the restaurant, so I will start by talking about what they do best and move onto the meal from there. All slices of cheesecake are big and rich enough to share. These things are huge and if you're eating one by yourself then you are either a mammoth or your pig. Don't hate! Just embrace the truth! My wife and I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, which had Hulk testicle size chunks of cookie dough inside of the cheesecake. With two big squirts of whipped cream on the top and the tip of the cheesecake to complete the imagery that I'm shooting for. It was simply amazing! When the waitress first stopped by to ask what we would like to drink I asked for water and an Old Fashioned. To which she replied ""How hot would you like that?"" That's when I learned that one of their burgers is called The Old Fashioned. As I write this I now realize that I should have ordered The Old Fashioned to go w/ my Old Fashioned, but let me tell you what I did get before I get too carried away. I got Renee's Special which consisted of a Turkey Sandwich, the Soup of the Day (Clam Chowder) and a House Salad. Very tasty! My only complaint on the food was that the bread, I believe it was Sour Dough was too hard. Not stale or anything, just the crust was hard as a Hulk sized... ...never mind. My Old Fashioned was very tasty and helped me take my mind off of the man taking his three disrespectful daughters out. This good man was taking his daughters out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and all three of them were on their phone and iPads. Hopefully it doesn't take him having a heart attack from the cheesecake he ate for them to realize how disrespectful they were being. I would give 5 Strong stars but I'm going to subtract one for how close the tables were. I didn't even have to lean over to take the food from the person next to me. I wasn't trying to make friend that evening, just enjoy the company w/ my wife."
Todd S.,"Norwalk, CT",222,151,782,5.0,6/8/2013,You can not go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory!!  They have the largest menu of any restaurant I've ever seen.  Great meals and usually quite large.  I love the Thai Lettuce Wraps and the Orange Chicken entree.  Also the Red Velvet Cheesecake is out of this world!!
Justin H.,"Rock Hill, SC",33,20,5,5.0,3/3/2015,Bit pricey- but always delicious. My family and I always enjoy! Be sure to try the herb crusted salmon and fried crab wontons...you won't be disappointed!
Steph S.,"Charlotte, NC",0,4,,2.0,12/30/2015,"This location is absolutely terrible. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday afternoon and we still had to wait about an hour for a table. The food was a complete disappointment.  Our server was the nicest part of the entire experience. Overall, I do not recommend it. I suggest going to maggianos instead."
Ginger M.,"Charlotte, NC",2,103,11,2.0,9/19/2014,"Roll the dice to see if they actually give you what you order.  This place has the worst customer service.  The food is tasty what with all the salt and fat and all.  However, they ALWAYS seem to get something wrong, leave something out, include a hair, etc.  My rule is if the food is expensive (like it is here) I do not give the restaurant much room for error with my order."
Jan J.,"Mooresville, NC",1,9,,2.0,9/18/2014,"How many times has this location served bang bang shrimp with only 6 pieces of shrimp. Forget that they have diverse menu n decent service so we end up there after the mall. Long story short, frozen n chewy shrimp the last few times I have eaten there. Today this happened again. If you can't afford the dish with good quality meat/ shrimp then please take it off your menu rather than serving stale n expired frozen shrimp in your food. Customers have other choices. One or two bad experiences can be excused but not repeatedly. That shows your food quality standards have fallen."
Natalie F.,"Fayetteville, NC",22,25,25,2.0,7/19/2015,"Arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night with a party of 9. Was told it would be an hour wait. The timing was totally off b/c they sat us in 15mins. We should've known then that it was too good to be true. My husband ordered a beverage, but never received it throughout the course of our meal. We ordered our dinner around 10:30pm and it took about 45mins to receive our food. We were told by the waiter that it takes a long time to cook a steak well. Really? First of all, you don't tell your customers an excuse like that. It doesn't take that long to cook a steak well either. Then when the food came out, my entree was cold. So that tells me that most of our food was already done but not brought out. Once we receive our food, we saw the waiter one time, then never again. We waited at least 15mins after we finished eating just to get the check. At this point my party is very irritated and just want to leave. We finally asked 2 other servers for a manager. One server stated that the managers were very busy. I told him that they shouldn't be too busy if a customer is requesting to see them. The manager comes out and asked if everything was ok? We all said no, not at all. As he walks over to me, i hear him mumble under his breath, ""everything hasn't been ok for me tonight either."" Or something to that effect. When I asked him what did he say for clarification, he changed his words and said ""what's wrong?"" Like he really cared. Well after explaining to him about all of our problems and he could see that our table was full of dishes, meaning no one had been by to clear the table, offer dessert or coffee. He apologizes for everything, comps my meal but didn't offer anything else for the rest of my family that traveled out of town and are here for the first time. This was a very bad experience at cheesecake all together, including how the manager handled the situation. Highly disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory."
John H.,"Charlotte, NC",265,1283,685,3.0,12/1/2010,"I can appreciate the Cheesecake Factory every now and then, but I'm on the fence.  The whole chain aspect and shear size of the restaurant makes it very cookie-cutter and forgettable.  Sure the space is pretty grand and offers a nice atmosphere, but the menu is gigantic and it's almost dizzying how they make you wait, rush you in, and then you can't even remember what you ate.... Yes they do make good cheesecake and it's a treat... it's also very filling... most of their portion sizes seem like they are trying to feed 2 or 3 people with each plate. This could have been a fluke because they are always so busy, but last time I came in I just wanted to get a gift card and the hostess was very rude and told me to get them from the cashier [ with a tone that I should have known that in the first place ].  I'll let it roll off for now, but I would hire people that have more patience to be at the front of the house."
Ari G.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,10,3.0,10/5/2015,"We ordered, a relatively small order over the phone to pick up and we were told it would be ready to pick up in 20-25 minutes. We arrived at the restaurant and proceeded to wait 45 minutes before our food was ready. We had to call three times for our food to be brought to curb-side pick up. The food was up to its usual standards, but if you want a quick meal, this is not the place for you."
Sarah W.,"Beaufort, SC",0,20,,4.0,11/20/2014,This place was okay for a Cheesecake Factory and I have been to several.  I had the chicken and biscuits and the chocolate mousse cheesecake. The chicken and biscuits was like a chicken pot pie with a buttermilk biscuit.
Kala P.,"Barren Springs, VA",0,8,,5.0,9/26/2015,Had an amazing time!!!! Wonderful food and the best waiter I have ever had!!! Thank you for making our trip down so great Mr. Blue!!!!!!!
Tracy K.,"Charlotte, NC",11,93,8,2.0,2/10/2012,"There really isn't much to say about a place like The Cheesecake Factory. It's chainey, has huge portions.... This particular location feels too large, like I felt like I was getting lost in my booth b/c the place was so large.  The food was on par with what I have come to expect from this chain, but it was the service that warrants the deduction in stars. Throughout our experience the service was fine- not particularly good, not particularly bad- but that all changed as we were getting ready to leave.  I had asked for a box (b/c the portions are just too large here) and was in the process of placing my leftovers into said box when the waitress came back after running our credit card. As I still had my hand on my plate, picking at the last few fries that did not fit in the box, she swopped in and took the plate from me. Really???? This took a middle of the road experience and turned it sour."
Chad E.,"Charlotte, NC",187,2236,1436,3.0,11/4/2009,"Walking into The Cheesecake Factory (at night) reminds me of a Las Vegas Casino.  Not the downtown casinos that are all closed in and almost claustrophobic, mind you, but the expansive Steve Wynn casinos on the strip.  It's huge.  It borders on gaudy, but in a nice way.  You also can't really tell what time of day it is - probably so you don't mind how long you wait for your server to come back to you (though we did). I'd imagine that during the day, the monstrous windows in the front of the place give it a ton of light, and it would be a completely different feel, but at night, it just gave that vibe.  The noise is pretty incredible too - like the old noise of casinos (they don't have noise any more, sad to say). As to the food - pretty impressive overall.  I just wish that they didn't have 300 items on the menu.  And I didn't count, the server gave that number when I asked for a suggestion since I didn't feel like opening the tome of selections.  I eventually settled on one of the items from the specials list (Caramel Chicken). We also had some crab cake appetizers, a massive double BBQ burger, a chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn shrimp.  The fried food overall was the worst.  The burger was good, but huge.  The crab cakes were surprisingly good.   It was really the service that did them in, but to their credit the manager (or someone doing an imitation of a manger) came out to tell us that the food would be out some time.  Then we had to also wait on the bill, and to pay the bill, and so on... If I had any suggestions, it would be for them to go on ""Kitchen Nightmares"" with Gordon Ramsay.  Not because the place isn't clean - it's immaculate.  But the size of the menu, coupled with the portion size, is insane.  Cut the menu in half (or quarters), and do the same with the portions.  They could even shave something off the price at the same time. That way every person wouldn't be walking out with leftovers and they wouldn't have to spend so much time at every table trying to help diners navigate the menu.  Not to mention, there would be room for dessert.  You know, the cheesecake?"
Demetria M.,"Charlotte, NC",320,627,789,3.0,3/9/2012,"The factory remains the same since my last visit.....long wait times, and average food.  We had a hungry group of 4 looking for a variety of items to choose from and this place definitely has a huge menu....which may be why most of the food is just average.  I usually go with the burrito here as a safe bet but I decided to try the fish tacos with rice and beans and it was just....meh.  I really think the only thing worthy in this place is the cheesecake even though it is overpriced......"
Eric S.,"Washington, DC",8,19,,5.0,6/8/2014,Very good. You pay for it but it's worth it. Good atmosphere. Cheesecake to die for. Good service and they treat everybody great. I def recommend it.
