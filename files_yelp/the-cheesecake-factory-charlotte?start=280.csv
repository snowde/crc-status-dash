Carl V.,"St. Petersburg, FL",198,21,28,4.0,6/17/2010,"The first thing I noticed walking in the door is the grand size of the restaurant. Towering ceilings, walls  filled with large decorations,  colorful glass lights, and intricately painted open spaces was somewhat busy but pleasing to the eye. The herb-encrusted salmon salad was delicious. Of course I had to try the 30 year anniversary cheese cake which was wonderful but very large. Desert sizes seem to be made to share with two or more. The bar looks like a great place for happy hour and hanging out with friends. This is the kind of place you can feel comfortable dressed up or in jeans and a t-shirt. Overall a great place for a date or meeting friends for a drink or a meal."
Mia M.,"Waxhaw, NC",0,18,,5.0,6/26/2015,"Every time when I am at South Park, I need to have a cake fix here with Pinot Grigio. I like Red Velvet cake. Its texture is oh so good!"
Cami H.,"Macon, GA",0,32,6,3.0,6/23/2014,"I  prefer non- chain restaurants and haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in six years, but amazingly the same menu items that I chose then were still on the menu. I got a Caesar salad with fried chicken and hubby got a buffalo burger ! Colleagues got a pasta dish, salmon dish, and chicken dish and all plates were consumed happily. Since we are all away from home we splurged on cheesecake too! TCF is typical and reliable. See you in another six years."
Just N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",19,149,1013,3.0,7/14/2012,"It's The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to several and they've all been good. I don't have anything really bad to say. The food is good, but maybe just a tad on the pricey side for what you get. This particular one was busy when we went, and it was before 5 PM, which I would think would begin the dinner rush, but they seemed to have it handled. Our waiter took a while every time to get back to us when we asked for something, but again, we were there around 5 PM, so I'm sure he was occupied. He wasn't too friendly towards us, but again, I don't know what he's had to deal with that day. He wasn't rude or anything, just not overly friendly. I would come back again because they have such a big selectioni of food, and honeslty I don't think I've ever had the same thing twice yet, so I would like to go back and try their other items."
Dianne A.,"Charlotte, NC",0,5,,3.0,8/16/2015,"Love the food.   Service is another issue.   Work in the area so used to eat there 2-3 times a week.  Since I usually eat with coworker, anywhere from 2,3 or 4:00...at the bar.  Most times service is reasonable, bartender always attentive.  However if 2 females sit at a high top in the bar area....good luck!  If you're a female eating alone....you better BRING your lunch!! Guys and couples ALWAYS get served first...even when they arrive after us! Their orders taken promptly, bread, drinks come right away ..and food is served usually in 15 min.  We are good tippers...and quick to order since we have an hour.   However when it now takes 35-45 minutes to get food, even when bar area is not busy, we don't have time to eat.....Too expensive to have to inhale the food and not enjoy a bite.  This never happens when a male coworker joins us....go figure!!  4 Stars for food/1 Star for Service"
Jaimie C.,"Charlotte, NC",87,4,,4.0,6/26/2015,"The service was great; our server called us 'princess' which was cute. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered from the 'Small Plates' menu,the Greek Salad and Chicken Samosas. I loved the salad and the Samosas were nice and spicy."
L. T.,"Fort Mill, SC",0,50,,2.0,5/17/2014,"Come for the cheesecake and stay for...well, the cheesecake. We ate at The Cheesecake Factory one busy Saturday evening.  The wait was an hour, which was really no biggie because, hey, you've got a huge mall behind TCF to browse through!  I was thinking to myself, ""This place is so crowded it HAS to be good, right?""  WRONG!  From the perpetually pissy server to the horrible main dishes, this was one of the worst experiences we ever had at a restaurant, bar none.  The only thing that WAS good was the thing they are famous for, the cheesecake.  Of course none of us found that out until hours later; the food had made us all so sick we had to take our cheesecakes to go!  Next time I waste my time coming to this place I'll know to grab my cheesecake and RUN!  Run far, run fast!  Mickey D's has the food at this place beat.  The ONLY thing that got stars was the deliciousness of dessert.  The service and food both get a big, fat ZERO!"
Jimmy D.,"Charlotte, NC",190,295,28,3.0,6/8/2011,"Hi Cheesecake Factory I like you but I'm not in love with your crazy wait times, or giant sized portions. Your place looks pretty cool though, I like high ceilings, and I can appreciate the sizable outdoor patio area, but can we get tables that are a bit bigger please? It's really crowded! Adjoined to Southpark Mall is the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory. Every time I go for a shopping spree I see tons of people waiting their turn to get into this place like an exclusive nightclub and people leaving with bags of food. So I finally decided to try it out after a shopping spree one day. The place feels very cavernous walking in with super high ceilings and some paintings to gaze at as you're looking up wondering how much their power bill costs. Well then the waiting game begins, first we checked in to the hostess station and was told there will be about 45 minutes wait which turned out to be about an hour, okay no big deal I thought. Turns out the buzzer thing they gave me was to announce that I could now wait in the shorter line to actually be seated! What a tease! So now we're finally seated and hungry looking at the huge menu. Some bread came out I guess to sate your hunger a bit from waiting an hour+ to get a seat. I ordered a frozen mango smoothie and appetizers took that took a while to come out by this time I'm wishing they gave me some more bread. The spicy ahi tempura roll that came out is huge and delicious but not spicy at all. Then came the main courses which actually came out on time! I had ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and was totally unprepared for the size of this thing. I mean seriously it would have taken 4 meals for me to finish this thing off, it was very delicious though! The sudden influx of food at once left me feeling really bloated though so we opted for taking dessert home and bought a tiramisu cheesecake for later. I've probably rambled on too much at this point so I'll just summarize. Come prepared to be hungry in 1-2 hours and not while you're actually hungry. Prices are a bit high for the type of food but they give you enough food for 3-4 meals. I just don't really understand this place the food is nice but I there are plenty of dining options around this area where you don't have to wait for 2 hours. If they took reservations I'd probably be here more."
L J.,"Boone, NC",0,41,12,2.0,2/29/2016,"First of all, they do not take reservations.  That is a big negative in my book and I almost didn't go as the last time the wait was very long.  They also do not take call-in-advance.  So upon arrival, we were told an hour and a half for a table for two.  The menu is huge and they have lots of options.  The food was okay but nothing special - definitely overpriced for quality.  It was no better and no worse than any other chain joint but significantly higher priced than something like a Sagebrush or Applebys and not better quality.  Five-star prices, three-star quality, one-star service is the best way to describe it.  My date ordered the shrimp and mushroom dish which was served with no mushrooms.  I order the ribeye which was slightly overcooked (ordered medium rare - served medium).  The worst part was definitely service.  Our waiter disappeared for extended periods of time and in fact, never checked on the food which was delivered to the table by someone from the kitchen (I assume), so we never had the chance to explain that the dishes were not exactly correct (I was okay with the steak, but my date specifically wanted the mushrooms in the ""shimp and MUSHROOMS"" dish.  We waited over 30 minutes for the check and another 15 for the cheesecake to-go (which I order before the check).  I will say that the cheesecake was delicious later that night.  I would go back for the cheesecake - probably to-go, but I would definitely not wait for a table when the food is only average at best.  The atmosphere was crowded and chaotic so definitely not a great experience.  I only give two stars because the cheesecake was excellent."
Rory M.,"Fort Mill, SC",22,30,50,5.0,1/1/2014,"These people just do good things with food. The only downside to our trip was the ~45 minute wait, which was to be expected at dinner time on New Year's Eve, I suppose. The Factory doesn't take reservations, so that's how it goes. Our server, Kenneth, was extremely enthusiastic, although he kept referring to my counterpart as ""m'lady,"" which was pretty great and also slightly emasculating. I ordered salad with my burger but got fries; whatever, the fries were great, and there was enough ketchup for both the burger and the fries, which is SUCH a rarity at places without self-serve ketchup. She got pasta, which was also really good, and we shared a Turtle cheesecake. ""I mean, the place is called the Cheesecake Factory. We ought to get some cheesecake."" Everything was marvelous, as expected. Side note, the floor beside our table was really slippery, and we almost fell a few times. Other than that, it was a great way to close out 2013."
Jennifer T.,"Chicago, IL",4,144,6,3.0,3/6/2014,"Your average Cheesecake Factory in a mall. It's super busy but the food is reliably yummy so you keep going back. Service isn't the best but they aren't rude, so it's fine with me. I usually have sandwiches for the Liz Lemon side of me. Try the ranch dressing with your fries, it's so good! We are big fans of the mango key lime cheesecake but I also can't quit my old favorite, cookie dough. It's yummy, just go."
Michele L.,"Greensboro, NC",77,14,1,3.0,6/30/2012,"We both enjoyed our starters, which were the Crispy taquitos and the Avocado eggrolls! YUM!  I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, which was good. The plantains were great! Crispy and spicy on the outside and smooth and creamy inside! My companion had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but he ordered it with brown rice instead. He didn't like it so much. There was too much rice!  Our server lacked enthusiasm and was sub par really.  We got cheesecake to go. I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee and he had the Oreo. Both were creamy and delicious!"
Adam C.,"Emporium, PA",7,118,52,4.0,10/3/2013,"I have heard a lot of good things about The Cheesecake Factory in my travels and on my recent trip to Charlotte I got a chance to visit one. I was immediately wowed by the general style of the place and felt like I should have worn something a little nicer. The staff was friendly and the menu was almost too big. Portions were decent and prices were about what you would expect. I got the Garlic Noodles with chicken and was surprised to find bones in the chunks of chicken they put on. Then came the cheese cake, which was fantastic. I would come here again, no doubt about it."
Grace S.,"Charlotte, NC",156,147,194,3.0,1/24/2012,"I have been here many times, and those times are usually for friends.  This place is good, but I don't really think people should hype it up so much.   The interior is nicely decorated, but it felt very dim when I in to eat.  I'd prefer a little more lighting there for some reason.  I thought that they could have someone make the bathroom a little cleaner though.  When I went in on Sunday, I was seated at a big circle booth.  I thought that was very cool so our group could talk and jabber a lot, but if someone had to use the bathroom, two or three people would have to get up to let someone out of the booth.   Now to the food.  The only good thing really worth it on the appetizer menu would be the sweet corn tomale.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  I tried the other appetizers from friends and thought they just tasted alright.  Nothing too snazzy.  The entrees weren't really something to die for.  The strawberry lemonade though, whew!  ALWAYS order that sweet deliciousness with a free refill.  Even during the winter it makes me think of a nice hot summer day.  I would suggest everyone to come here for the cheesecake though since it is called ""The Cheesecake Factory.""  Sometimes I have stopped by, only for the delightful sweets.   All in all, this place is just A-ok for me."
Hays M.,"Charlotte, NC",1,3,,4.0,4/11/2014,"This place is always a treat. The menu is huge, with a variety of different cuisines. Some of my favorites are the spicy cashew chicken, and hibachi steak. The are both so delicious. Be prepared for a 1-2 hour wait on the weekends."
Scarlett J.,"Charlotte, NC",163,125,18,4.0,12/19/2011,"Our office orders cheesecake from here regularly. My absolute favorite? The wild blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate. OH MY GOSH! So flavorful, and not too sweet! (and pretty to look at too!)  You can pretty much always expect a wait on the weekends... but not to fear, they have a very spacious bar (and pages of drinks to choose from). Plus, you can eat pretty much anything here... from Indian/Thai cuisine to Italian to Americano... there is something for everyone. What is a must try? The Chicken and Biscuits... an enormous platter covered in mashed potatoes, a savory chicken/gravy mix covered in huge biscuits. WOW. Creamy chicken with flaky biscuits, you can't go wrong! Also, the Chicken Picatta is my favorite Italian dish-delightfully lemony with just the right amount of capers and tender chicken... delicious!"
Ryan L.,"Reno, NV",1,91,,5.0,5/27/2014,"Food here was excellent as was the service. We came on a crowded Saturday evening, but were able to be seated fairly quickly. Our server got all the order correct and the food showed up in less than 10 minutes. I was impressed with the flavor and would recommend here for anyone in the area."
Nikki V.,"Frederick, MD",42,220,229,3.0,7/13/2013,"We had a great time at the cheesecake factory. We sat outside an the weather was great. The food was excellent. I had the shrimp and chicken gumboo....hummm humm.  Goood!!! My hubby had the flip flop salmon special. As usual he is not sure of the item but I know it was a special. It was great. The waitress was good, but we ordered drinks and had to ask if they were coming before or after we finished the food....lol  The Mai Tai made it...an it was gr8. We will definitely return as the summer time has a shorter wait time."
Betty B.,"Charlotte, NC",30,89,2,2.0,2/13/2011,"You know, I get it--the cheesecake here is really really good.  But everything about this place is really really bad.   First, I cannot get over the fact that this place tries to pass itself off as fancy (valet parking, for example) when it is a) called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" and b) ATTACHED TO A MALL--arguably two of the least fancy things imaginable.   The inside of this place is basically a glorified cafeteria--just a loud din of noise, which makes it even crazier that people dress up to go here. The food itself (even that which is not cheesecake related) is incredibly caloric and fattening.  I spent most of my life trying to avoid this place, and, I realized today, for good reason--this place is just thoughtless excess at its finest."
Ziana C.,"Gastonia, NC",45,94,,4.0,2/20/2011,"Went for dessert after dinner.  2 hour wait.  Put our  name in, was told to come back in an hour for a pager.  Wandered the mall, returned for pager, waited about 45 min. for a table,   Friendly staff.  We were told that we could order at the to-go counter and eat outside on the patio.  We wanted to experience the restaurant. Loved the atmosphere!  Very relaxing.  Excellent service.  Wonderful dessert and coffee.  Had the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake.  Hubby had Chocolate Mousse Cheese Cake.  Only had a few crumbs left. Had eated dinner at Maggiano's...feel of the resturant was totally different.  Both had 2 hour waits, both were extremely crowded.  BUT Cheesecake Factory had a much more relaxed atmosphere.  Wait staff was not stressing out...calm, joking with each other, etc.  Lovely experience. Wish they took reservations."
