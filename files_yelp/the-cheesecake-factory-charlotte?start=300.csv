Lyndsey O.,"Charlotte, NC",25,113,23,3.0,3/31/2013,"Big portions, good food, and yummy cheesecake! Drinks are overpriced, but what do you expect at southpark mall's tourist trap? The cheesecake factory is in need of a decoration update. It looks like 1997, but a fancy 1997. Anyhow, if you're at the mall and want a decent meal, you can get one here!"
Tim C.,"Fort Mill, SC",15,31,2,5.0,2/4/2014,Always great service generously sized dishes and fast service the best thing here is the chicken so whatever you get with chicken you're good to go I haven't had a complaint here in the many times I've been between the drinks or food but have yet to experience the actual cheesecake
Jaime G.,"Uptown, Charlotte, NC",5,21,5,5.0,2/21/2014,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory. They have a lot of variety on their menu! I love it! It's so diverse. My favorite thing is the Diane steak and the salmon. It's always so tasty and never disappoints. It's such a good place if you want to go with family, friends, a date. Only one in Charlotte!!"
Shea S.,"Greensboro, NC",37,40,36,4.0,11/17/2013,"You can never go wrong at The Factory.  Be forewarned that the menu is quite extensive so you'll spend lots of time looking through the pages. That being said, there is something to be found for everyone. Also, be prepared for a long wait to be seated. On this trip the wait was just under an hour but at times the wait has been closer to 2 hours. But the wait is always worth it.  My6 husband and I tried the buffalo blasts for an appetizer and OMG! Amazing.  They are crispy fried wontons filled with shredded chicken, cheese, and buffalo sauce served with a side of buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. One word:YUM! A must have anytime you're at the factory. The drinks from the bar were great.  I had the Georgia Peach and my husband had an LIT. Both were good sizes and very generous with the alcohol.  For the main course I had the New Orleans Chicken Pasta and it was amazingly delicious. The plate was ginormous so I had way more than half leftover. My husband had the Steak Diane and it was to die for. Perfectly seasoned, juicy,  and cooked to perfection. For dessert i had my normal, Carrot Cake Cheesecake which was not as good as normal (a bit too heavy tonight) but the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake that my husband had was amazing. it tastes just like vanilla bean ice cream.  Our server Will, was awesome and all the wait staff seemed very personable.   I love The Factory and recommend it often. This one did not disappoint."
Sari Catherine W.,"Richburg, SC",80,5,1,2.0,7/22/2014,"We came to Charlotte for the day from out of town, to take our kids to the Discover Place and Cheesecake Factory! We normally wait 15-20 mins, which we are very understanding of. We got seated to wait 10 mins before a sever saw us. Her name was Blair, I believe. She seemed rather annoyed that we had two kids with us, and preoccupied with other things. We waiting 10 mins to just get our drinks. I am a completely understanding person, especially when a server is seated too many tables at once, but she was talking with other servers, joking around, our son had asked her for some extra dressing and she clearly forgot ( but realized when we had pre-bused our table.) Not only did our drinks were not refilled, she did not once check on us to see how our food was until we we're wanting to order dessert. It took an additional 15 mins to get dessert, which we kinda regretted ordering to have to wait that long. Not only did I leave 20% gratuity, because I am in the tipping business and I do unto others. But I never normally complain on service, and I felt like I was a bothersome to her, I have never had issues at any Cheesecake Factory other than today. But I don't think this woman liked kids or liked us because we are ""young parents"" with tattoos that we would even tip. She probably shouldn't be in this business of customer service. Just BEWARE OF BLAIR!"
Jeremy L.,"Plaza Midwood, Charlotte, NC",148,13,,5.0,1/4/2014,"Things did NOT go as planned tonight. But our server, and two managers went above and beyond to ensure our Anniversary dinner ended on a high note. All in all, very pleased."
Holly M.,"Oakboro, NC",0,11,4,4.0,2/9/2015,"If you're dining at the cheesecake factory as a party of one or two, they will often try to stick you in one of their tiny, little tables. You literally sit five inches from the guests beside of you. This may not be a problem for some, but I always make sure to ask for a booth to avoid these tables. This place has a HUGE menu. I don't think you can go wrong with what you choose, though. My favorite dish is the shepherds pie. It's a huge portion and so delicious. I like that, during lunchtime, you can get the half portion. I usually still end up taking some home! If you're not starving, I recommend getting the cuban rolls, which are an appetizer. I enjoy the cuban sandwich, but actually love these even more. They're so crispy and come with a great dipping sauce. Oh, and the cheesecake is a must- duh. Even if you have to take it to-go. I've had so many of their cheesecakes and just can't choose a favorite. You seriously cannot go wrong! Try this place next time you are in the Southpark area!"
Shaggy L.,"New York, NY",5,146,103,4.0,2/1/2011,"I have been to this chain restaurant in other cities in the past and it's my first time after a gap of 3-4 yrs. Quite interesting to see a big change in the service and quantity of food.  I remember the service was poor and the food quantity  was very less for the price at all other locations. May be it's just this location. I went in a group of seven and ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees. Entrees came in big portions. Especially the jambalaya dish was huge. I loved the bourbon street omelette.  Chicken marsala, calamari, chicken dumplings are always my favorite here. I highly recommend angel hair pasta for all the pasta dishes. Bottom line: I  would love to come to this location again if I'm in the Charlotte area."
Tom C.,"Huntersville, NC",155,475,85,3.0,7/10/2011,"The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is somewhat overwhelming in it's size and breadth.  While it's a lot to take in, the menu also offers pretty much something for anyone so, it's a nice destination for a large group who can't agree on a particular genre of food for the night. Definitely enjoy the avocado egg roll appetizer.  Fresh, ripe avocado mixed with some diced tomato, red onion...  They are quite good.  As far as their namesake dish, cheesecake, I'm not that big a fan.  Not much of a dessert fan but I do love a good slice of cheesecake and find the Factory's to be a little to fluffy in texture for my tastes.  I prefer something more dense.  They have a large the selection of flavors however and my wife swears by the ""Dulce de Leche"" version. For a drink, if you're going non-alcoholic, I like their lemonade a lot.  Fresh and tart.  Definitely not Country Time!"
George K.,"Charlotte, NC",1,33,4,3.0,10/24/2010,"I have changed my mind several times as to whether to make it two stars or three... The food is occasionally very good, but most often it is merely serviceable--you'll eat it, you won't be hungry afterwards, but two days later you won't be able to recall what it was you ate. I suspect that has something to do with the extensive ""something for everybody"" menu, which makes me think no single kitchen could prepare all of these dishes with equal skill. Thus, some items might be sort of roughed out in the kitchen by the cooks, while others are done with flourish and panache. It is a ridiculous amount of food presented on the plate, and I would be a more frequent guest there if the food cost 2/3 as much and the portion was proportionately reduced. I likewise won't bother with a 20-40 minute wait--I'll eat in the food court, save myself about $30 for the wife and me (especially with no wine), and stop by on the way out for some cheesecake slices to go. Finally, I prefer eating outside when the weather permits. It isn't a great view (the parking lot) but the noise level is much lower than inside. Modern restaurant designers seem to have a fetish for hard surfaces within the dining area, reflecting kitchen noise and patron conversation into an enormous dull din. Supposedly, this creates a sense of energy in the place; for me, it is more like eating in a construction site. If inside is all that is available, I'm heading back to that food court..."
Christopher S.,"Annapolis, MD",45,394,22,3.0,3/10/2010,"I could not describe this better than Chad in an earlier review. I thought I walked into the Belagio Casino in Vegas. I knew it was going to be expensive when I saw the 40 ft high ceilings. Someone has to pay for all this air.  The noise level is amazing. I could barely hear the bartender when I ordered a drink. As I sat there sipping on a glass of wine I noticed massive portions of food being served. I saw salads that could feed a village in Afghanistan. What is with the massive portions? I ordered an Angus burger that had to be 3/4lb to 1 lb,  loaded with onions and mushrooms. The place is also pricey but then............ It finally hit me. When you go to the Cheesecake factory you order an entree you want to eat at your next two meals. So you really need to focus on which items are a good for reheating  and taste good as leftovers. By spreading the meal over two or three meals makes the high prices seem very reasonable. So this is why people wait 45 minutes to 2 hours to eat at the Cheesecake factory."
Jennifer K.,"Cotswold, Charlotte, NC",50,202,22,4.0,8/14/2012,"Excellent as always. I have always been a huge fan of TCF and have eaten at many locations. There is almost ALWAYS a wait at this location, no matter the time. We arrived around 1230 and told a 20 minute wait, it was around 25. I am in love with the asian lettuce tacos and the pear, blue cheese and pecan flatbread on the skinnylicious menus. Friend had the chopped salad also off the skinnylicious menu... we were both in heaven and had leftovers. The service was good and the food came out quickly... it helps having an idea of what you want before you go because the menu is huge."
Virginia H.,"Harrisburg, NC",256,12,1,4.0,7/24/2010,"I have to go with 4 stars only because I am not a fan of the HUGE portion sizes.  To many people that may be a plus but that is the ONLY downfall.  Beautiful space with good atmosphere especially for a restaurant that is so busy (30 minute wait in mid-afternoon). Definitely try the Ahi Tartare and the Avocado Rolls.  Even my kids loved them.  I had the Factory Chop Salad and it was fantastic and light.  My hubby had Renee's Special, cup of soup, half sandwich, and a gorgeous salad.  He ran 10 miles so he finished the WHOLE thing.   No room for dessert.  Isn't that embarrassing!  Worth the wait, food is always quite good, just remember the portions are ginormous!"
Tyler F.,"Charlotte, NC",26,38,44,3.0,4/22/2013,The food is usually pretty good when I go. Nothing to die for but it's pretty good.
Kate O.,"Charlotte, NC",3,13,,4.0,6/26/2012,"This place is GORGEOUS! I have to say that the decor is like nothing I have ever seen in a restaurant. Very high ceilings and a gorgeous, well stocked bar. Waiters wear all white (shirt, pants, shoes and even the belt is white) and are very friendly/attentive. We had sun dried tomato pasta and a pizza. Finished it off with Red Velvet Cheesecake....big enough to share, and OMG delicious! My only ""gripe"" is that they serve free bread baskets and we never got one, forcing us to order an appetizer because my blood sugar was crashing and I needed food quickly. Fried zuchinni was to die for, and for only $5 it is a very cheap appetizer. Overall, very good and can't wait to go back! PS, the menu is an actual book, so there is something for everyone!"
Courtney H.,"Union, SC",18,5,2,4.0,7/16/2014,"For my birthday my fiance and I decided to check out The Cheesecake Factory and we had a wonderful experience from the time we arrived! I knew from reading other yelpers reviews to expect a wait so I was totally prepared for waiting and to my pleasant surprise our quoted wait time of 15 minutes went by fast while we looked over there enormous menu. The time finally arrived for us to be seated (patio) and our waitress Emily was very friendly and also very knowledgeable of the menu. Upon her suggestion I ordered the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp and Chicken with black beans, rice, and fried plantains. All of which was delicious. My only complaint would be the temperature of my was not very hot. My guy had the rib eye and fries and he devoured Evey bite! I ordered the 30th Anniversary cheesecake to go because my entree was sooo big but that's a good thing. You guys helped make my day that much more special and we will definitely be back!"
Xiao M.,"Manhattan, NY",42,25,,4.0,5/17/2012,"Yes, I know it's a chain, but I do quite enjoy the cheesecake factory.  The menu is huge and there's something that can be enjoyed (or at least tolerated) for everyone.  The Miso Salmon is probably my favorite entree on the menu.  The cheesecake is phenomenal (albeit overpriced).  The best thing I like about this particular cheesecake factory is that it isn't overly crowded.  Going in for dinner at 7 does not require a 1+ long wait (like in Maryland, DC, NoVa areas).  The longest wait I've encountered there was 10 minutes."
Joe D.,"Charlotte, NC",2,6,,3.0,10/15/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those things that, to me, sounds better than it ultimately turns out.  The Cheesecake is good, but the rest of the food is hit or miss. The menu is huge and difficult to comprehend. Portions are on the large side. The restaurant itself is massive, with really high ceilings and decor that reminds me of the classier venues in Vegas. Summary: Definitely edible, but not my favorite place in town for the money."
V B.,"Pineville, NC",0,5,,3.0,8/26/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  HOWEVER, we were celebrating my Mom's birthday and my husband ordered his favorite dish.  Chicken and Biscuits.  This is the only dish he has EVER ordered in Atlanta and here in Charlotte and obviously LOVES IT.  WELL!!!!  They changed the recipe and presentation of the meal.  Before it was served in a lovely deep bowl with delicious chicken, carrots, peas and yummy white sauce between the best biscuits ever.  What did they change it to?  The meal is put on an oblong plate, the chicken and other ingredients are swimming in the gravy which isn't appealing and the kicker, no more biscuits; They now serve muffins.  CHANGE THE MENU PEOPLE TO SAY  Chicken and Muffins.  Our very nice waiter informed us some genius in ""Corporate"", figures, made the change and they have had complaints.  Well here is mine.  Listen to your customers and your wait staff who inform you what customers like and don't.  Otherwise the meal overall was just ok."
Kathy G.,"Fort Mill, SC",10,125,1,1.0,11/26/2013,"I ate lunch here today and was completely disappointed.  I ordered Renee's lunch special.  It included soup, sandwich, and salad.  The soup was tortilla.   It was like some kind of much.  It was barely warm. The taste was awful.  The chicken salad  sandwich had almonds and way too much mayonnaise.    Besides that buttered bread was on the sandwich.  Nothing in the description said the toast would be buttered.  The salad was saturated with the dressing.  Even the unsweetened tea tasted old. My waiter was Mr. positive but didn't wait on me or ask me if everything  was OK.  He was concerned that my tooth picks that held the sandwich together was taken apart.  I told him that I didn't like butter all over my bread.  He said, ""OK, just wanted to be sure that they didn't leave it that way.""   I would expect that he should have asked me if I wanted bread without the butter but he didn't and got away so fast that I couldn't ask him.  He never came back to ask me if I needed tea or anything. The soup was so bad I didn't eat it at all.  I ate the salad or there would be no lunch. When he picked  up my plate, he said, I guess this means that you have no room for cheesecake.  I guess he said that because most of the food was still on my plate. Once again he sped off not given me a chance to tell him that the soup was awful.  Very disappointing."
