M A W.,"Sumter, SC",32,50,134,5.0,6/10/2012,"I thought it was great! Had the red velvet cheese cake and the macaroni cheeseburger which came to a total of $21 which I expected. The staff was extremely friendly. I got my order ""to go"" because it was so crowded."
Jennifer A.,"Charlotte, NC",1,8,,5.0,7/19/2014,Not a chain food fan- but if you can get in to the Cheesecake factory it's always delicious.  Salads are great- plenty of vegetarian and healthy options!!
Sheena M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,,1.0,11/23/2013,"Disappointed! I asked for pumpkin cheesecake with NO whip cream. I get home and whats on my cheesecake..... You guess it, whip cream! I'm not sure what it is about customer service in 2013 but it's awful. Aside from me having to scrape whip cream from a $8 slice of cheesecake, the actual taste was eh. I had to doctor it up a bit with some pecans and carmel from my kitchen. I WILL NOT RETURN!"
Courtney H.,"Boston, MA",56,403,30,2.0,9/6/2009,"I have no idea why people come here.  In fact when my whole party sat down, we all were trying to figure out why we ended up there.  The food just isn't good.  The salads were warm, the spinach dip so greasy, and the bread wasn't very soft.  It's just really not good for food, yet this place still stays in business.  It really isn't just this location either.  The only reason I give this more than 1 star is that I LOVE cheesecake, and I enjoy the extremely decadent chocolate peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake.  However, I found out they are taking that off the menu because it's too rich.  But any place that has that much cheesecake gets an extra star."
jim m.,"Charlotte, NC",3,109,,3.0,8/21/2013,It was great years ago when Charlotte did not have as many places.  There are so many better places to go now.  The food is average.  The service is very good.  The dessert is excellent.  Overall it is a 3
BJ S.,"Charlotte, NC",293,56,1,4.0,1/1/2011,"So a friend and myself stopped by the CF the day after Christmas for some preconsumerism consumption and were greeted by a friendly hostess, who seated us immediately.. It was pretty close to lunch time and they had ample seating for the lunch rush.  I recommend highly the avocado rolls for the appetizer!  OMgosh... Delisious-ness abound!!!  For the main meal I had a veggie sammich, which was great, great great!  Loaded with eggplant and mushrooms and other yum yums.   It was plenty of food for the both of us with sandwiches and the app. for around 40 bucks, so it's moderate in the price scale.  I hear their namesakes desserts are good and do look well, but milk, and creams don't bode well with the ole system, if ya catch my drift! One downer of the meal, was that the strip on my debit card is worn and the waiter had to manually type it, but when he came to the table he told me that it was declined, which was embarrassing, but then handed me the merchant copy to sign??!?!  I dunno what that was all about, but poor choice of words, waiter!"
Tracy N.,"Houston, TX",68,13,14,1.0,11/14/2013,I was really disappointed with my foods and services! We came in at 1:50 pm and waited for 15 mins just to order our drinks!!! And we didn't get our food till 1 hour later....and waited for 40mins for him to stop by so I can request for our check! This is ridiculous!!!!!! If I can give negative stars! I would!!!
Sam P.,"Charlotte, NC",172,342,87,3.0,2/7/2009,"This was our 2nd time to this particular Cheesecake Factory. We returned after receiving a gift card for Christmas. After having just a decent jambalaya on the first visit (a 2-star visit), i went with the cajun Ribeye with mashed potatoes instead of fries. It also came with onion strings and asparagus. It was very good. It was a hefty portion for a hefty $30 price tag. Our server was excellent on this trip. He was friendly and on top of refills.  The other entree we ordered was the chicken marsala and it was just ok. We wouldn't order it again.   The ""6 o'clock sweats"" struck here as well. (See Alessandra's review for details.) The ribeye and the service made this a 3 star review."
Bethany B.,"Arden, NC",0,39,,4.0,7/1/2012,"In general I love the cheesecake factory.  We'd not had a great experience at this one last time, so I wasn't sure about trying it again, but we were please. The service was pretty good and the food was quite good.  I had the endive, pecan and blue cheese salad and my husband had the ahi tuna app...both very nice.  We will return."
Barrett S.,"Charlotte, NC",207,68,12,5.0,4/9/2009,"I was so glad to see this place was in Charlotte when I moved here. I ate at the locations in Chicago and the burbs of Chicago all the time. Downtown wait was 2 hours all the time, but so worth it. I've dined at the Charlotte location now a few times and it has been just like being back home. The fish tacos, Louisiana chicken and I don't even remember all of my other fav's at this great joint!!!! Just go if you haven't been b4"
Amanda B.,"Concord, NC",7,38,4,4.0,7/21/2009,"What can I say, the restaurant is pretty. As soon as you walk in the door, the aesthetics of the place is wonderful. The way the tables are positioned, all of the vegetation, and not to mention the ceiling is amazing. I don't like the little tables though, there really isn't enough room for 2 people and all the dinnerware, it seems crowded. The food? Fantastic! I have eaten here many times and I try to get something different every time I go and I have not been disappointed. The crusted chicken romano is a must, so is the stuffed chicken marsala. For some reason, when I've had a dish with marsala sauce, it seems over powering with the wine, but not at Cheesecake Factory. They get it just right to where you can taste the mushrooms and other flavors with your meal. Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for! They use red potatoes instead of russet or yellow potatoes. The texture is a little lumpy, yet smooth all at the same time.  Let's not forget their cheesecake. That's the reason why you came right? There are 2 pages of cheesecake selections in the menu. All of their cheesecake is wonderful, but make sure you have a glass of water or milk handy because most of their cheesecakes are RICH! They range from your traditional cheesecake with strawberries to a carrot cake cheesecake. If you're a peanut butter fan like myself, fear not, they have about 3 different kind of cheesecake with peanut butter. Let's not forget their carrot cake!! The 1st time I had their carrot cake was at Barnes & Nobles and it was like my mom used to make. Dreamy! As for the wait, be prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on the weekend at least and during the week about 10-15 minutes to get seated. Never have I gone to the restaurant and gotten seated immediately. It's well worth the wait and what better way to wait at the bar? I'm a Long Island kind of girl, but I have had their cranberry and vodka. Their liquor is all top shelf and I always had a well mixed drink, nothing overpowering in 1 liquor.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and very polite. I've had only 1 server that was pretty bad, but that was because we were his last table and we were taking our sweet time. Yes, it's still not an excuse to be rude and try to rush people out, but overall, I haven't had really bad service. Cons:  Long wait to be seated. Noise, sometimes can't hear what your company is saying to you across the table from you. Little tables."
Charlie G.,"Brevard, NC",0,9,,2.0,2/23/2012,Dinner and service was mediocre.  The cheesecake was good.  My advice is eat dinner somewhere and come here for dessert.
Tracy J.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,4.0,3/6/2011,Yum yum yum! My hubby and I went here last night for the first time and we loved the food but it looks like everyone loves the food too! The wait was an hour and forty five minutes! I guess it's hard to complain about such a long wait time when everyone else is in the same boat as you. I'd hate to feel rushed if I was eating my meal. Luckily it's at the mall so I treated myself to a little shopping while we waited!
Hugh H.,"Charlotte, NC",3,46,,4.0,9/8/2010,"Tried this restaurant one time for dinner. We had crab wontons as appetizer and they were really good and had us going and craving. Crispy, not so cheesy and didn't have the fishy taste. Dipped in a sweet and sour sauce with a touch of spice. We had bang bang chicken and shrimp, a Thai-inspired dish on white rice in a light coconut cream with curry and peanut sauce and hints of ginger and lemon grass. Although it seemed that they forgot to put the shrimp. We also had a combination of chicken madeira and dianne steak encrusted with black pepper and roasted mushroom. It was really a delightful experience. Grab a table on the porch if the weather is fine because it can get noisy inside. The brown bread served was soft and chewy and make sure you have it. Will be back to sample other dishes."
Alessandra S.,"Charlotte, NC",73,216,182,2.0,8/6/2008,"I don't know why I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory. Maybe it's the atmosphere, the lighting, the service or the 9 hour wait, but something always keeps me craving it.  The food here, as has been my experience at most other Cheesecake Factory locations, is right around mediocre. I can't quite put my finger on it; it's pretty good, never bad or not fresh, but it almost ALWAYS has me running home right after to take care of some, er, business. I heard once that they don't change their cooking oil very frequently. Whatever it is, it always gets my stomach, and the same holds true for everyone I go with. We actually coined a name for it, you usually get the ""6 o'clock sweats"" - you go to bed okay but then wake up around 5 or 6 am with your stomach turning.  The service at this location was great and we dined outside, which was nice (large seating area out there). Skip the sangria and stick with the martinis or margaritas, or just plain beer or wine."
David P.,"Munster, IN",6,48,,4.0,3/27/2009,"I wish I could have the team who designs the inside of these restaurants design my house.  Between the 'Factory in Chicago and the one in Charlotte, they're probably some of the prettiest places to eat.   The food?  It's good.  I've never had the issues the other reviewers are calling the ""6 o'clock sweats"".  But the food here does seem to have some quality that leaves me feeling completely saturated.  Maybe it's one of those places that makes your eyes fall out of your head when you see the nutritional facts on their food.   Whatever the case, the menu is pretty diverse.  I've eaten about a dozen times split between the two 'Factory restaurants I've visited and only been disappointed once.   Their cheesecake is pretty unique.  I can down a slice of cheesecake in a sitting pretty easily, but the cake from here takes me at least 3 attempts to finish it.  But that's a good thing.  It packs all the flavor (and calories, I'm sure) of 3 slices of your typical cheesecake into one slice.   The service has always been very good, even when it's packed, (which is often.) Their beer list is usually pretty decent.  They usually have the typical summer wheat, a couple lagers, a dark and one or two ""local"" brews, (for Charlotte, that means Yuengling.  Chicago was Goose Island.)  Nothing extravagant, but their beer selection does a good job of matching the light, stylish mood of the restaurant. It's pricey, but I don't come here when I'm searching for a good value.  I come when I'm looking for a reliable menu and a lot of atmosphere.   If you've never been, you really do need to try it.  For the cheesecake if nothing else."
Dan W.,"Belmont, NC",168,47,37,1.0,4/18/2013,"Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory, tried it a few times bc of friends wanting to eat there. And it's all been the same, I am not hard to please whatsoever but I would of rather gone to Dairy Queen to get a meal and dessert. Money doesnt matter to me but quality of a meal does the last experience will be my last one. Went there with a date ordered two appetizers calamari was perfect but the crab bites was horrible. Ordered two alcoholic drinks one of which was a mint mojito never had anyone butchered the drink that much it was awful. After waiting an hour after finishing our appetizers our food still wasn't out yet nor was the server anywhere to be found, it being not busy and also a Monday night we didnt understand why it was taking so long, finally the manager came over and told us that our food was accidentally sent to another table, understandable we was patient and said its ok 10 mins later someone other than the server brought the food over to our table and it was not what we ordered. Not touching the food we waited a while til the server came to check on us told her the issue she took the plates away and returned with our order, I'm guessing my food was sitting under the warmer in the kitchen for a while bc my steak Dianne was over cooked and dry when I ordered it rare, and the salmon was fishy and cold. The only thing that was truly acceptable was the cheese cake I guess if they messed that up they shouldn't be called the cheese cake factory! I will not be returning anytime soon and I won't be recomending it to anyone considering it was 120 bucks for two people and the food was awful like the service!"
Megan B.,"Union, SC",6,125,27,2.0,8/6/2014,"Last weekend while running some errands in Charlotte, my husband, daughter and myself decided that it was time to hit up The Cheesecake Factory. Any other time we have gone, the food is always okay but pricey and we always get two pieces of cheesecake to share. This time around, my husband ordered the meatloaf lunch and when he got it, the meatloaf was dry and he compared it to chow hall food in the military. He said chow hall food was better than that! When the waiter came back like 15 minutes later, I told him that the food as gross. He took it away and never said a word. The manager popped up about 10 minutes later and offered him a menu but told him that everyone's tastes are different and they have never had a complaint about the meatloaf before. My thoughts were, ""it's dry and tough....Who would eat that?"" My husband just ordered a soup and salad lunch combo after he got another menu which was priced at like $15. The salad was horrible and the soup tasted like vegetable water almost. When our waiter came to the table, of course I had to be the one to call out the issues because my husband won't and I didn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't eat. Of course they did nothing about it. They just brought out the cheesecake and made us pay for a meal he did not eat or enjoy. Since I'm heading to Charlotte for my 24th birthday next weekend, I will definitely remember not to go back there and they won't get our business again. We will just mosey on over to Maggiano's for our next big business meeting."
Kathy W.,"Rockville, MD",21,182,11,5.0,5/31/2010,"This is a fantastic dining place for any sized group. The menu is gigantic, the food quality is superb, the atmosphere is fun and fancy, the service is phenomenal, and the location is easy to find: South Park Mall. The interior is spacious, and there's a separate section where you can purchase cheesecakes to-go and other sauces/ingredients and even beanie babies (if I remember correctly)."
Kathy T.,"Trinity, NC",1,1,7,5.0,5/20/2011,I took my two boys here for lunch and and we were completely satisfied with everything we ordered. My two boys ages 12 and 10 were treated like young adults. I can't wait until we can eat there again.
