Junnell S.,"Towson, MD",3,30,,3.0,8/29/2010,"I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, the food is yummy and I enjoy the atmosphere. The first time I came here, I was a little disappointed in the service. It was crowded, but our waitress made it clear that she was flustered. She even got our bill wrong, charging us for items that we didn't order. It was a little frustrating. We decided to chalk it up to the possibility of her being new and inexperienced.  The next time I came here - I had great service, great food and great cocktails. But still only 3 stars. I don't really like when the service fluctuates that much."
Londonbridge X.,"Charlotte, NC",8,103,67,3.0,6/17/2010,"Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu to choose from. Their food is just okay and a little bit pricey, but you do get your money's worth in terms of food portion.  They are usually very busy and there will be at least a 15-60 minute wait to get a table. Service will be kind of slow since the place is extremely huge. They do take reservations on the weekdays, but not on the weekends. It will be first come first serve and they recommend you coming in at least 45 minutes early with half of your group in order to sign in. All in all this is a great place to go for a special occasion, but not really good for a everyday night out dinner."
Jason C.,"Charlotte, NC",0,18,,3.0,8/22/2013,"My wife likes to visit Cheesecake Factory when we are at South Park mall. The service is fast, and the menu is HUGE. The Cheesecake as everyone knows is delicious. I don't really like dessert, but I save room for cheesecake here."
Diane D.,"Matthews, NC",19,80,32,4.0,12/5/2007,"It's been awhile since I've dined here but I thought it was worth mentioning. Very enjoyable. It's attached to Southpark Mall.  The atmosphere is surprisingly warm despite the just-under-montrous size of the restaurant; maybe it's the high ceilings that make it seem so big.  The menu is also big. If it's your first time, make time before you're famished beyond repair to browse the menu. They are gracious about making substitutions. They are smoke-free inside. When I first arrived in town 2 years ago, this was not the case. I'm happy to see places around town popping up with smoke-free air- fun for the whole family! There is also a bar area. They offer curb-side-to-go  - (704) 770-0915. It is crowded at peak hours. The wait staff has ranged from efficient to friendly to comedian (in a good way).  Oh yeah! They have a HUGE selection of cheesecakes! There are plenty of other dessert choices if you don't happen to like cheesecake. Monday - Thursday 11:00 am - 11:00 pm  Friday & Saturday 11:00 am - 12:30 am  Sunday 10:00 am - 11:00 pm"
Gladys R.,"Fort Mill, SC",1,47,4,5.0,3/6/2011,Great place for different kinds of food.  food was so pretty we took pictures :)  Great food and friendly service.  Haven't had room for the cheesecake yet.
Maria A.,"Harrisburg, NC",0,69,,2.0,9/10/2008,"Go for dessert; eat your meal somewhere else! The food is overpriced, and the portions are just crazy large.  I always leave feeling stuffed, but guilty because of the huge bill and the huge amount of food that was either thrown away or in a to-go box (which usually ends up...thrown away).  I can almost never get to dessert.   One good thing is the appetizer menu - I could make a meal out of most stuff on there and not feel quite as stuffed.  The fried mac and cheese is good, and so are the pot stickers. Worth going to say that you've been, but save it for when you've been starving yourself."
Alicia B.,"Ballantyne, Charlotte, NC",3,5,,4.0,10/7/2012,"Went out on a date with my husband.....rare get away from our baby lol. I ordered a baja chicken taco. My husband ordered Thai lettuce wrap. His was delicious!!! My meal lacked flavor and the taco broke as soon as I picked up each one. Very hard to eat. I would not recommend this.....I have rated this so high because they really do have amazing menu items and are very yummy. Pasta, salmon wraps, steak...especially cheesecake. Just wanted to help save most people from a disappointment."
Roger S.,"Sunset Beach, NC",105,205,2,4.0,4/17/2009,"I've found most entrees here to be mediocre, but the avocado egg rolls and Craig's crazy carrot cheesecake are fantastic. You can get your weekly load of fat grams from these 2 items alone but maybe worth it."
Briana L.,"Monroe, NC",0,18,3,1.0,4/19/2014,"I'm not sure if I came in at a bad time... I came in for lunch with my friend and it was certainly busy. When we were seated our waitress was very friendly at first. She was very attentive (which she should be considering how expensive this restaurant is). I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and when it came out it looked delicious. It tasted absolutely HORRIBLE... It was loaded down with garlic and it ended up making me throw-up sick. I called the manager over and he didn't offer to take it off the check or anything. I told him to just bring me a burger to go. The waitress came back out about 30 minutes later with the burger and it wasn't in a to-go box. I had to ask her to bring me a box for it and she had an attitude. I said thank you and was continuously polite throughout my visit and she never said ""you're welcome"" or anything very polite back. Whenever I said ""thank you"" she just turned away. She wasn't horribly rude, but I definitely expect more for such an expensive restaurant. After we left, about 30 minutes later I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. I won' be coming back... This restaurant is not at all what it is talked up to be!!"
Jonathan B.,"Palm Springs, CA",137,46,9,4.0,5/8/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has great food. I had the chicken and biscuits and it was fabulous! Not to mention their wonderful cheesecakes! It has a great atmosphere and the service is rather good, too. On most weekend, the wait for a table at dinner can be long, but since it's in the mall there is much you can do while waiting."
Publius J.,"Baltimore, MD",5,87,1,2.0,9/16/2008,"The appetizers deserve some praise (I like the ""Vietnamese"" summer rolls and the pot stickers).   If you stop there, you'll like it.  Ironic that Maggiano's down the parking lot has a better cheesecake."
Food D.,"Bristol, TN",0,7,,3.0,4/3/2013,"Went right at lunch time on Sat, they said a 15 min. wait, I looked around and thought--no way, too many people, but our kids had never been so we decided to wait it out.  We were called 15 mins exactly.  I had the chicken salad sandwich, I am extremely picky about chicken salad.  It was good, I ate most of it, but it wasn't exceptional, but to make up for that it was a huge portion and they did not skimp on the quantity of white chicken meat.  The fries were just fries, I think I ate 2.  They did mess up our son's order:  soft tacos with only meat and cheese, everything else on the side.  When they arrived with thinly shredded lettuce throughout the tacos, our waiter pretty much suggested we pull them out. You CANNOT pull out shredded lettuce from a taco...  He did take them back but it took a very long time to replace.  The quality of the taco meat was good though, not the normal ground generic beef.  The mixed drinks looked good, but my husband and I just had a draft beer (only 3 or 4 to choose from, but good choices) bc we were getting ready to spend ALL day shopping in the South Park mall.   I don't mind spending money for exceptional food, but I thought this was just a little over priced for the quality and service.  We would probly go back, but mainly bc the kids loved it so much, not for the quality of the food or value."
Joe T.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,10,,2.0,5/25/2008,"Been to other CF locations around the country, but this one never seems to get things quite right. Last few times we ate there, the food was really, really salty. We always get spotty service for some reason, but keep coming back for the dessert. (And even then, I don't think we've done that for months.) There's so many places within a ten minute drive that offer way better value for the money."
Cyndi C.,"Charlotte, NC",19,3,,3.0,1/23/2011,"I went with my sister for lunch on a Saturday.  We got there about 10 minutes after they opened so we didn't have the wait other people have complianed about.  They seated us at a two top bench seat in the bar area. At first this seemed fine but 10  minutes later the hostess started setting up the table next to us (the tables were about 12 inches apart) with 2 highchairs and a booster seat then seated 2 couples with 3 small children. They were not happy being squeezed into a bench seat with the highchairs etc. but even after they complained to the waitress and the hostess, the hostess seemed unable to come up with a solution.  Seems they could have just moved them to a table where they could move the chairs to accomodate the highchairs.  The menu is overwhelming.  I'm always a little suspicious of a menu with so many items.  I feel like more often than not, everything just ends up being okay and nothing is really good.  My sister ended up getting the burrito and I got the bbq chicken salad.  The burrito was the biggest portion of food I've ever seen in a restaurant.  It could have easily fed 4 adults.  I could only eat about 1/3 of the salad and it was the lunch portion.  The food was good, not great.  The service was good.  I would go again but would request a table, not a bench seat."
