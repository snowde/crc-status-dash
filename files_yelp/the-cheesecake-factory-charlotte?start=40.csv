Chloé R.,"New York, NY",12,112,40,1.0,10/8/2017,An eternal wait even if you come at off times. Been waiting like an hour for food after waiting 40 mins to get seated. Also bf's credit card info got stolen here last visit
Robin W.,"Charleston, SC",19,19,151,5.0,7/17/2017,"Where to start!!!! Everything was amazing from the atmosphere to the cheesecakes to drink time at the bar.  Such a splendid place the food was great. I came here for a family reunion and after church Sunday I suggested the cheesecake factory. Everyone in the group was happy about their order;the spaghetti wonderful we started with a whole thing of appetizers the crab cake appetizer great; the bang bang shrimp oh my gosh! Bistro shrimp amazing grilled pork chop with mashed potatoes and asparagus; outstanding, fried shrimp and just everything!!!! Take a look at the pictures"
Samantha A.,"Columbia, SC",16,105,40,5.0,6/11/2016,"We love Cheesecake Factory! We make it a point to stop in here for lunch anytime we are leaving Charlotte to go home to Columbia. Today we had a great experience!  We started with Tuna Tartare, which was beautifully presented and very fresh. We loved it, and it was a nice diversion from some of their ""not so healthy"" appetizers. For lunch, I ordered my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the S.O. ordered teriyaki chicken. Both were excellent! Our server was awesome and we really had a great lunch with several drinks. We don't love corporate places, but this place is an exception to that rule!"
Tamara J.,"Matthews, NC",0,27,25,5.0,7/8/2017,Alex was our waiter and he was awesome! We celebrated our 35th and our daughter's 5th wedding anniversary ... dinner was delicious and of course the cheesecake was the best!!
Riley G.,"Plum Branch, SC",1,5,,5.0,10/22/2017,This place was pretty good I liked the the food the service speed was good the waiter was nice and they had lots of choices of food and cake. I got hot chocolate and I was the best chocolate I had better then the one in the box and I got white chicken chili the rice was good and the chicken was good and was seasoned right.
LA O.,"Morristown, TN",154,269,896,3.0,3/9/2016,"Not worth the wait...so come mid-afternoon or pick another place.  Good food, expansive menu for entrees and of course, pages of dessert choices featuring things other than simply cheesecake.  Bar can have VERY irregular service even when the place is empty.  Outside dining is great--but place your ENTIRE order or you'll be waiting forever if you want dessert."
Lisa G.,"Tampa, FL",66,252,80,3.0,6/6/2017,Now I found my second favorite item on the 100 page menu. The truffle bacon cheese bread. It's delectable and delicious. I really coulda just had that - since it's was like a grilled cheese - an awesome high brow grilled cheese cut into 4 strips! I'm only giving 3 stars cause the pasta a order was ok. Basic. But my shrimp were terribly over cooked. Which I paid extra to add em. Live and learn.
Barbara M.,"New Rochelle, NY",4,14,3,2.0,6/5/2017,"I haven't even gotten my meal and already having a terrible experience. Took 7 minutes for a server to come and greet us, never introduced herself, brought over our drinks. Bread hasn't even come to the table. She's more focused on all her other tables and guess what? They all have bread.. Driver over an hour and a half for this?"
Lori L.,"Charlotte, NC",192,703,2397,3.0,8/22/2016,Had better service recently but I also didn't get a to go order. Came for lunch on a weekend and they weren't that busy. We gave the hostess our name and she told us to move to the side and we will be called very shortly. She made it seem like it wasn't gonna be long. She also didn't give us a buzzer. We ended up waiting a bit before we were called. Our server was friendly and greeted us quickly. I got the egg roll sampler. It was good but definitely not worth $12 for 4 egg rolls cut in half. My sister in law the the chicken and biscuits and she liked it. My husband got the salmon and thought it was ok. We got a few cheesecakes to go and went on our way.
Anthony T.,"Plaza Midwood, Charlotte, NC",0,22,11,3.0,12/5/2017,"If you are already at the mall, you should go to Cow Fish or another restaurant near by, but if you are set on the Cheesecake Factory.. The menu is giant so even the pickiest of your friends will be able to find something. Desserts are always good. The service is always sub-par and you should expect to wait over an hour on weekends just to get a table. We have tried getting takeout during the week and it still took a long time even when no one was there. The three workers at the dessert bar were talking in the back room or texting on their phones. I decreased my review after Cheesecake told me to try going in the morning or later in the evening. Cheesecake should work on hiring more employees or training them better."
DeAnna B.,"Charlotte, NC",91,17,2,2.0,2/26/2017,"Starting with the good! I love love love the cheesecake and the variety in both entrees and desserts. You always get plenty of food for the price which isn't going to break your pockets. The staff is always nice, attentive, and quick. That's where the good ends. In the past I frequented this place like every other weekend but as of last year that is not the case. I hate to say this is no longer my favorite place. Cleanliness has become a issue. Barely wiped tables/ seats and crumbs on the floor are too obvious for me to ignore. The food has become very inconsistent and can sometimes be sent back a couple of times before satisfactory or just giving up on the dish completely.  It can be super busy so reservations would be nice but that isn't a big deal if you don't mind waiting.  Overall its just decent at best now with exceptional cheesecake and good service."
Crystal S.,"Lancaster, SC",7,4,,1.0,8/19/2017,"Poor service. One waiter for a group of 15!!! Ordered dinner 45 prior to getting everyone else order and I still didn't get my food. The server also got the checks mixed up. Charges that were not mine were on my check. He shouldn't have waited on our table without help. Food got cold before I got my ketchup for my fries, so I ended eating them before they got cold. Reservation was at 6, we didn't get our food until 8. We didn't get out of the restaurant until 1030. What a mess of a biethday celebration it was. We made reservations and the service was still poor. Done!"
Maria M.,"Charlotte, NC",86,77,73,5.0,5/17/2017,"A huge thank you to Jamie for accommodating my large party. I love his personality and he is an asset to your establishment. Also my server Courtney was wonderful, PATIENT, and constantly kept our glasses full. The food was as expected (tasteful, large portions and fresh.) Our only problem was a salad containing beets and asparagus arrived without those items. The cooking staff should have informed the patron or the server of the issue. A manager did address it once the mistake was realized and informed us that they were out of beets. As for the other meals, the food was hot and fresh. Well seasoned and the chicken is never dry. Their meatloaf is double the average serving you would receive in other places.  Most people will have enough for a box to go. Good food, good service."
Pauline M.,"Livermore, CA",0,205,799,1.0,2/15/2017,Cleanliness - zero star.  Breadcrumbs on the table and the seat.  Menu was covered with old spilled food and grease.  It was really gross. Food - one star.  Fish and chips with cole slaw.  Fish batter was way under cooked.  I ate one of four pieces and hope I don't get sick.  The cole slaw had no flavor.  The fries were excellent. Service - three stars.  My water glass was promptly refilled except the lemons were not replenished. Will not return to this location.
Emma T.,"Gaston, SC",0,6,3,1.0,6/20/2017,The wait staff was too busy. We didn't get the attention we needed. She was stopped we 3 times before she could get back to our table to get our dessert order.  We drove all the way up from Columbia for my daughter's birthday dinner and was slightly disappointed. The portions were smaller than I remember. The bathrooms were filthy and the display case for the cheesecakes was nasty. I was disappointed. It has been a year since our last visit and the trip was a total waste of drive time and money.
Ed C.,"Charlotte, NC",970,223,989,4.0,7/19/2016,The service was spotty.   We were sat and waited 15 minutes before a hostess was flagged by me.  Then the mgr came and offered apologies and free dessert to each of us.  The food was very good.  The fried catfish was a hit and the tuscan chicken was just in need of a little salt.  The chocolate cakes were delish and the lemon cello
Marc W.,"Boone, NC",3,42,66,5.0,9/9/2017,"Having been to The Cheesecake Factory many times, we anticipated great food and great service. That is exactly what we got tonight. Our server was attentive to our table, including our two children, and she made sure we enjoyed our meal and our experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Having seen other people try several other menu items, we each decided to try new things. We started off with the Fried Macaroni and Cheese and Guacamole & Chips. My wife had the Lettuce Wrap, I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and our guest had the Pasta Di Vinci. We will each have these again one day soon...unless we decide to try something new again. We always enjoy our meals and service at The Cheesecake Factory. (Sorry we did not post pictures this time, we were really hungry)."
Emma Y.,"Charlotte, NC",2,34,28,3.0,4/2/2017,"I ordered calamari,had better in maggianos, ordered stuffed mushrooms..had better at Olive Garden.. There is something about this place that just doesn't give me the ""I want to go back the food was that good"" vibe... Cheesecakes are great,so I guess I could come back for some of those!"
Nirnay S.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,1,,2.0,4/25/2017,Below average food! Ordered buffalo blast and stuffed mushroom. Terrible! The buffalo blast - such a waste of dish and presentation. The mushrooms had cheese that had dried up! Raspberry cheesecake- not great either. The syrup tasted like - cough syrup ! Sorry to say but Very disappointed!
Whitney L.,"Greensboro, NC",2,10,4,1.0,12/11/2016,"We have eaten at many Cheesecake Factory locations. This has been by far the worst. We ordered a to go order, waited 45 minutes, got home to have no toppings on my salad, brown avocado in our egg rolls, brown guacamole in my husbands sand which side and zero toppings on our nachos."
