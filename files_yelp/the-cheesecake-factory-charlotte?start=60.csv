Sapna F.,"Charlotte, NC",110,73,18,3.0,8/11/2016,"So this review was just because of national cheesecake day.  So every year they do half off cheesecakes,  we'll you would think they would be prepared for this day way in advance and make sure they have enough staff to get this process efficiently.  We got there and people had no idea where the kine was or where people were waiting or where to go to get in the restaurant.  Then it took about 20 mins to order.  So we were excited that it wasn't too bad because of all the confusion.  But then we waited and waited and waited...  It took 50 more minutes before we even got our cheesecake.  People who ordered after us were getting there cheesecakes before us and there was no organization to the process at all.  You would think they could have just kept pieces of cheesecake already in the boxes so they could give it to people immediately.   Sorry this review doesn't completely reflect the whole restaraunt because we didn't even eat there so I can not talk about their service at all.  So I don't want this to reflect them Completely...  But I just wanted to let people know not to go on busy days like that!!"
Bianka M.,"Charlotte, NC",282,441,2116,3.0,10/6/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, initially I'm not a big fan because I've been there done that since high school back home in Chicago. However I have a teenager and this place ROCKS to teens so we end up here from time to time unfortunately. When I'm forced to eat here I enjoy the small plates menu items which include the avocado rolls, salmon rolls & mushroom pizza. Our teenager ALWAYS indulge in the Buffalo Blast as an app and chicken tenders with fries as a main course. The hubby alternates between Jamaican Black Bean chicken and the Miso Salmon. I personally LOVE the Miso however this location is off on flavor and the whole Miso experience.  It's pretty weird that Grand Luxe Cafe and Cheesecake Factory are owned by the same company. I prefer Grand Luxe as its much more upscale and the food options are better and much more tasty and presented better. Grand Luxe would've been a perfect fit for SouthPark mall, wishful thinking as I'm a Chicago girl and we have it ALL. The dessert choices include the Lemon cake/cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake and the chocolate cake. Enjoy if you like 1,000's of confusing options and the pain of the mall traffic and long waits without the ability to make reservations."
Audrey P.,"Louisville, KY",0,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,"My family and I came to this location to celebrate my birthday. I thought it would be a fun celebration with good food but the service was absolutely horrendous. Not only did our server disappear, we had to wait for a whole hour before our food was served. For that whole hour we were also ignored and asked for a bucket of ice for our bottle of wine, which came. We then tried to wait to see if she had said anything to the manger but we realized that she hadn't. So we reached out to the manager about everyone around us were served and leaving before we got served. But the manage handed our check off to another server who never brought it back to the table. Finally we decided to head to the hostess stand to find where our check went. So bottom line, it was horrible service and the management/servers/kitchen was extremely unprofessional and we will not be going there ever again."
Suman C.,"Sterling, VA",5,22,8,2.0,7/23/2017,"Good cheesecakes, everything else sucks. Went there for birthday, waited for 45-50 mins another hour for food. When food came got burger with buns hard as rock. Never going to this place again."
John H.,"Quail Hollow, Charlotte, NC",110,158,72,5.0,1/22/2017,"Again this is another chain. You ate in one, you ate in all. If you like the place well you'll like this. If you don't well you won't! It's decent priced and its packed again just like anything in South Park. Main reason I don't even want to go to the area. I'm honestly finding myself eating more and more home."
Jessica L.,"Indian Trail, NC",0,2,,3.0,12/12/2016,"It's disappointing to say that Cheesecake Factory didn't exceed my expectations. I've been an avid Cheesecake Factory fan for years but now I realize why I never compliment the service.  The food is amazing as well as their fantastic cheesecakes. There's a large variety so there really is a little something for everyone. However, I've come to realize that I have the same issues almost every time I come as far as the amount of time I'm waiting on food/service.  Today I happened to want to surprise my family with some cheesecake and tried calling ahead numerous times to put in a to go order and no one picked up the phone. I understood and shrugged thinking that it must be busy. I am a server and working in the food/restaurant industry has given me a very forgiving perspective. Come to find that when I walk in the door, it is completely dead and the hostess is letting the phone ring nonstop without picking it up.  Now this could be the hostess' fault for ignoring her duties and I will always come back for the food--but I urge Cheesecake Factory to put their employees to be the absolute best they can be."
Cameron W.,"Augusta, GA",78,49,200,4.0,4/27/2016,Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chains. I really enjoy the dessert. The service is always very nice. One takeaway is that this establishment is always busy so try to make reservations. The atmospheres inviting and the decor is very stylish.
Jeremy M.,"Pineville, NC",83,17,1,4.0,8/15/2017,"Food and service has been outstanding tonight! Came here for a family members birthday, and the staff came out and sang. Will definitely come back!"
Marianne R.,"Charlotte, NC",16,130,27,3.0,12/16/2016,"I really want to give this a 2, but since the food was good...I have to make it a 3. I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich...and a few minutes later the water told me they are out of the bread it comes on, so I needed to order something else. I asked if I could just have it on a different type of bread and he said no. Apparently, the ingredients are ""pre-measured"" for the type of bread it goes on....WHAT?!?!? Just change the damn type of bread! If a kitchen can not just make the sandwich fit on a different bread, we have problems. So, I ordered the chicken avocado club, and it was decent. Chicken was cooked well, fries and ranch were very good. Husband got the lunch shepherd pie and he said it was good as well. I'd suggest skip it for food (it's a chain...I mean, it is what it is), and just go for cheesecake."
Timothy M.,"Charlotte, NC",62,27,88,4.0,7/8/2016,"We've been coming here for years, and will continue too if they keep up this excellent service. There are times when it's absurdly crowded and waiting for an hour for a table.  I've probably had the Herb Crushed Filet of Salmon over a few dozen times. Consistently good, what can I say.  Avocado Egg Rolls for your app is a sure thing, ask for the ranch to dip with, believe me, it will change your outlook.  Staff most of the time are tentative, occasionally there are times when service is slow, but that's expected with high volume locations.  Most definite recommendation. The menu is overwhelming, and I'll need to try more to get a better understanding overall, but so far everything has enough taste to keep coming back."
Sasha M.,"Charlotte, NC",111,11,32,4.0,2/23/2017,"I went here for my birthday last month and we went on a Tuesday night. There was 15 minute wait so don't expect to be seated immediately. The seating is also limited for those waiting. We got seated at a table that wasn't properly set up with plates and silverware. The lighting in the back is dim which I didn't enjoy. However, the service was excellent. My server helped me make a great choice for dinner. I got the fried cheese to start and the Alfredo with shrimp for dinner. Both were delicious! We got the Oreo cheesecake and it was so good."
Rob W.,"Charlotte, NC",10,100,962,1.0,6/3/2016,"OK so why does it always take a bad experience to bring me to Yelp to post a review! I love adding food pictures (944 of them if you want to know) , but tonight there was no food, so inevitably there are no photos of food.      Why you may ask?        Well, let me explain. It was around 9:45pm or so when we entered the restaurant, there were no lines or waiting, so we (my wife and I) were promptly seated in what I will refer to as man bun hell. After being seated between two groups of folks along the bar seating area, we were just getting a taste of the evenings adventure as it took approx 5-6 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered ONE Chicken Marsala to be split, It was not long after that our bread and water arrived, but that was all.  By now it was around 10pm as this was clearly stated by our guest at the table beside us as it was getting late and they were ready to leave.  It was about 5 minutes later that the table to the  right of us received their meals and they had time to finish their food even after ordering 5 deserts to go.  At last look, it was 10:38, we had run out of time, patience and understanding.  Our server appeared to be distracted by a table we will refer to as ""friends"" since he was at that table for at least ten minutes - socializing. He did bring by an empty plate for us to share our meal should it ever arrive.  We received two refills during this time. At no time was an apology given for the lack of food coming from the kitchen.  The table to the right was cleaned and a new group of four guest were seated.  The hostess stated that they would be taken care of ""she promised""......I stated that ""they should not believe the lies"", as we were obviously not taken care of.  They brought this to their service attention, but our own server arrived and I made it clear that we were leaving.  He suggested that we speak to a manager, however it was too late.  I stopped by the hostess stand but the manager came by. During this time, the server was observed laughing and showing no interest toward any guest. Upon leaving the restaurant I called and was promptly placed on hold for seven minutes. I understand busy nights, but this was just not the case. I will be following up on this review........"
Pamela S.,"Waxhaw, NC",140,234,302,4.0,5/12/2016,"Friendly service and delicious food. The menu can be daunting, but my family has been there enough times that we typically order the same items (Steak Medallions, Chicken Madeira, and Meatloaf). We did try the Chicken Lettuce wraps this time and they were delicious!! (Reminded me of a mini Bahn Mi in a lettuce cup. Yum!)   We used the new Cheesecake Factory app on our iPhones to track our food as we ordered and used it to for payment, too. We didn't have to wait for a check and didn't need to pass around our credit/debit card either. It was pretty cool!"
Nikki S.,"Farmington, CT",48,42,88,4.0,10/29/2016,"Great go to restaurant when you are just not sure what you want or you are dining with finicky folks.  Their menu is so all encompassing you'll have a hard choosing a dish.  Simply cannot go wrong with a salad from Cheesecake Factory, Santa Fe is my go to one and I get it near on every visit."
Kelly P.,"Charlotte, NC",177,16,7,5.0,12/12/2016,I came for some birthday cheesecake here after having a horrible experience at another restaurant.  Our server was VERY nice!  We had a great time.  The cheesecake is delicious and the atmosphere is awesome.
Hania A.,"Charlotte, NC",113,206,789,3.0,5/2/2016,Avocado Egg Rolls are delicious!  We ordered the Chicken with Lemon Couscous & Blackened Shrimp dinners.  Of course had to get the chocolate mousse cheesecake to go...the best!  The Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone.  Only bad thing about this location was cleanliness...our table wasn't very clean when we sit down and overall sanitation could be better.
Jackie D.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",2,36,14,1.0,7/18/2017,"Terrible. Nuff said. Horrible service, horrible food. Shocking because The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite go to spots. Never again in NC! Happy to be back in Phoenix."
Jess N.,"Steele Creek, Charlotte, NC",168,72,123,3.0,5/6/2017,"I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory and for more than just their cheesecake. They food is pretty consistent flavor is usually there and great. My only dislike about this place is the lighting. It can tend to be really dark inside during dinner service. I don't know if it is to set a mood, but having to use your phone to see the menu is never a good look."
Jenny A.,"Madison Park, Charlotte, NC",303,1,,1.0,10/8/2017,Will never come back to this CF. waited for 1.5 hours for our simple curbside pickup order. Horrible service. No one knew what was going on..
Andrew H.,"Columbia, SC",89,222,258,3.0,10/14/2016,So I have been to a few different Cheesecake Factories and they all have one thing in common. Go there for the cheesecake the entrees and appetizers and all the other meals are more than subpar. I feel that it is overpriced especially since the food really is not all that great. But if you're looking for a good dessert then that's where you should go. I would recommend going restaurant hopping and getting your entrée somewhere else and then coming here for dessert.
