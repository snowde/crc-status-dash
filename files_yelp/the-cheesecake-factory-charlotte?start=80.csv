Tatiana S.,"Charlotte, NC",24,120,5,5.0,7/5/2017,I love this place everything on the menu is good I've never had a bad experience I go here often however if you have never been look the menu up online first it can be very overwhelming because it is vast also this place gets crazy busy so try to go during the week or when your not as hungry because even with reservations the wait can be long during busy times I just wish there were more locations here in Charlotte
S L.,"Charlotte, NC",0,16,1,3.0,7/5/2017,"The Cheesecake is to die for!  Of course---very yummy!  The rest of the food was pretty good too.   Hostess, Bartender and Server not so much!  I get that this is a busy restaurant and the Host/Hostess are met everyday probably with giving people long wait times, but being pleasant goes a long way. When you immediately start fidgeting with your computer screen punching in buttons with a stressed frown on your face, thankful our parents who have never been to Cheesecake Factory didn't have to endure this rude greeting.  Next, it's on to the bar for a couple glasses of wine and a virgin daquiri (we told the bartender before we ordered we would make it worth his while :)  -- expected that to get a little friendly response.  No instead an abrupt stomp off to make it.  Comes back we ask for a wine list and bartender seems annoyed we are not ordering food.  Ask about the house chardonnay and he tells me it""s compared to Beringer--blick!  That's a first!  So we get our wine and settle up immediately, we were going to hang out, but we felt very unwelcome here.  Decide to sit outside for the rest of our wait, the seating outside is really nice and it was a nice night.  Finally, the buzzer rings and it's on to dinner.  Waiter is pleasant enough but, seems frazzled and not overly friendly.  Takes our drink orders, brings them back with bread basket.  Takes our order and app order.   App comes out, probably good time to make sure everyone has drinks still... nope.  He disappears then, apparently at this restaurant there are no food runners so, the waiter is also responsible for getting your food out to you too.  Seems like a BIG mistake to me--unless your organized and a good waiter/waitress.   We were a party of 6 and like I said first time our parents had ever been here and we were hoping to treat them to a good evening.  So half of our party got our food right away, the other half waited and waited (typically at most restaurants when food comes out seperate like that it is expected that the rest of the tables food is coming up right?).  We saw our waiter take another order, before he got the rest of our food.  No checkback really, and definitely no drink refills, unless  you count the time I flagged him down.  When our waiter finally came back to the table, ingredients from my salad were missing, had to get waiter to go ask for those items.   Like I said food was good enough and cheesecake was awesome, but for what you pay to eat at this place and the wait, you expect better service!  There are a ton of great restaurants in our area and for us this is not one we will be in a hurry to return to.  Best part, we also get the impression that the people who work there don't really care if you come back!"
Shakira D.,"Charlotte, NC",50,178,133,4.0,8/24/2016,"As many times as I've been here, I can't believe I've never written a review. In a creature of habit, always order the Luisiana chicken pasta without the mushrooms. It was yummy tonight, sometimes the noodles are bit more aldente than I prefer, but tonight they were great. The chicken in the dish was lacking, but nonetheless I enjoyed my meal in in it's entirety. Surprisingly I don't even eat cheesecake but the do make some pretty decent food. Tonight we were seated immediately, and our food didn't take too long to come out. our waitress was in training, and she did just fine. Of course they're conveniently locate @ South Park Mall, entrance right where the valet stand is, check them out if you're in the area."
Jared D.,"Hickory, NC",0,24,,5.0,7/3/2017,The food here is always amazing. The variety is one of the best things about the menu. The only drawback is no reservations and you can end up waiting a long time at peak hours on the weekends. Cheesecake selection is great and will make the end of the meal special.
Mitch K.,"Indian Land, SC",127,932,,4.0,1/23/2016,"OOOOOOOah!  What a great experience.  So many options, unusual options on the menu, servers galore and looking up to the ceiling and across the restaurant you get such wild ambiance.  Kids and adults enjoy the atmosphere and loud children cannot be heard more than two tables away because the Cheesecake Factory hums. Your menu is a spiral-bound book.  Take your time and get lost in the offerings.   Beware the ""skinny"" options.  Yes, they are low calorie and low fat, but to me they are so lacking in flavor and substance that one would have to be on a very strict diet to be subjected to the skinny life.   Otherwise, far from the skinny life are many wonderful salads, sandwiches and entrees.  Iced tea is endless and refills are prompt.  The bread is crusty and warm.  I especially liked their soups with the bread. You will be full when you depart as the portions are generous. Enjoy."
Tina H.,"Asheville, NC",80,129,115,5.0,10/1/2016,"Amazing.  When we arrived they explained the hour wait and said to come back in about 50 minutes because the pagers only work in the restaurant.  We walked around the mall and then came back in time to get to our reserved time.  Everyone loved their food, the service is impeccable and the cheesecake (or other dessert) is divine.  The menu is a touch overwhelming, but there are options for everyone."
Amanda W.,"Charlotte, NC",91,33,15,4.0,5/28/2017,"The burrito and fried cauliflower was sooo  good! My husband sent his Jamican chicken back. It was not to his liking. However, he is Jamaican so he had high hopes lol."
Lori U.,"Concord, NC",7,47,4,5.0,5/28/2017,I'm always overwhelmed by their amazing menu. Loved my skinny Licious meal. Good balance to their amazing cheesecakes. Always a treat to visit!!!!!  I just wish the took reservations for dinner.
Bethany E.,"Concord, NC",0,2,,5.0,6/13/2017,I just had the best experience here. They were able to accommodate my special diet due to a genetic disorder. Eating out was always bland for me because I had to get just veggies etc. But today the people here were able to cook my low protein noodles and add a DELICIOUS marinara sauce. I felt so normal for once. Thank you Cheesecake factory! I will definitely visit again.
Ruth K.,"Charlotte, NC",1,3,,2.0,5/10/2017,"We just had the worst service and the food wasn't that great either. The waiter had an attitude towards my mother, he came to the table maybe 3 times, we split a meal and it took 45 minutes to get to the table and when we commented he said that's what you get for ordering medium well. I never knew that 3 medallions could take 45 minutes as I order medium well all the time. The medallions didn't have much flavor at all. Bummed we spent the money on it."
Kate T.,"Charlotte, NC",267,549,989,2.0,11/24/2015,"Another disappointing visit to Cheesecake Factory. Based on last night's dinner I think I am done with them. We arrived shortly after 6 and were seated in the front area of the restaurant, through the bar. The lighting was ridiculous..SO dark. I couldn't even see the booth or menu and saw other tables using their cell phone light to look at the menu. When did the lighting change? Our waitress was such a disappointment, first forgot the lemon for the water, forgot bread, after two requests, and then brought out of one wrong meal. The wine selection isn't that great and the wine we both ordered was horrible. As for the entrees, again, the crab cakes were blah. My friend got the Chicken Romano and was a pile of spaghetti with breaded chicken, which I found very bland. After attempting to order another drink, not another glass of wine, I never received it. Finally asked for the bill, which reflected that second drink.  The worst part about it, $70 for two drinks and two entrees. Isn't this the Cheesecake Factory? Sorry, I have no issue paying $70 when the food and service reflect the price but Cheesecake Factory isn't that place. I will not return."
James G.,"Charlotte, NC",0,4,,4.0,5/24/2017,Cheesecake factory food is good. Waitress are on point. And the cheese cake is out of this world.love the area it's in southpark.and the family loves it also.
Logan V.,"Lynchburg, VA",93,22,4,4.0,6/19/2016,"Confusion is not inherently bad, for when one thing is mistaken for another, it only means that the two entities share similar qualities. The Cheesecake Factory is a place of much confusion, but the confusion only testifies to its goodness.  The atmosphere and architecture can be confused for an Indian palace. The kind wait staff are indistinguishable from Chick-fil-A employees. The menu can easily be mistaken for a phonebook.  The bathrooms parallel dimly lit, royal throne rooms of old.  The bill has an uncanny resemblance to the U.S. national debt.  The cheesecake, however, is distinctly unique. It cannot be confused with anything else, for it is the object that other great and wonderful things are confused with. It is, indeed, the magnum opus of the dessert world."
Trey H.,"Fletcher, NC",5,3,,5.0,5/7/2017,"Great visit, a brief 10 minute wait on Sunday evening at about 5:30.  Staff was quick to ensure that every need was met.  I had the chicken and shrimp gumbo while my wife had orange chicken.  Both were excellent!! The staff took our sons order right away so he would not have to wait.  Desert goes without saying, it was awesome!!!Great experience, definitely will be a return visit!!!"
Ryan H.,"Charleston, SC",532,620,713,4.0,6/23/2016,"I thought I had already written this but maybe not.  Had around 7 kids and an adult with me and went for lunch.  Well, little did we know we should have reservations for such a party and no way we were getting in.  So we went in the line for a slice of cheesecake each.  Wow, what a selection.  And the line moved pretty well.   I have to say that the value in that cheese cake is pretty strong.  I had one with about 20 ingredients and it was huge.  Everyone really loved theirs.  I look forward to going back."
Kandis A.,"Augusta, GA",510,506,2920,4.0,10/5/2015,"While in town I wanted to treat my mother to a lovely dinner because she had never dined at this franchise before. I had been years earlier with friends of mine and I said that time I had to have my mother try this place as well. I told her she would be in store for a great treat and that's what she got. As we entered this place to put our name the list for a table, the line was out the door and there were many patrons sitting outside in the nice sitting area for there name to be called as well. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table. That was fine since we didn't have anywhere in particular to go this Saturday afternoon.  The 30 minutes came and went fast by us people watching others going in and coming out of the mall. Once we turned in our buzzer it was still a 5 minute wait to get seated still. We finally were placed in a busy, small corner of the restaurant by the hostess. This was cool because it was just 2 of us and enough space for both of us. Our waitress came and introduced herself within minutes of us sitting down. We looked over the menu for awhile. After bringing our drinks the waitress informed us that she was leaving for the day and another waitress would handled us from here on out. This was fine as long as we still got top notch service. The menu was filled with all kinds of things, chicken, pasta, hamburgers, and things like that. I had a very hard trying to choose what I wanted to eat. It was either the Parmesan chicken or the Seafood pasta. I ended up choosing the chicken and my mother chose the 'glamburger'. Both were great choices. My dish came with 3 chicken breasts, green beans, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were out of this world!!!!! They were absolutely amazing. The chicken and green beans were good but I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. My mother enjoyed her hamburger and fries. It was a pretty big burger too. We both had tons to take home.  Then came the dessert!!! How could you go to this restaurant and not order cheesecake?!?!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but I do love a Strawberry cheesecake and that's what I got and my mother ordered the Key Lime cheesecake. Only complaint I have about my cheesecake is the bottom crust. I didn't particularly care of it but the rest was delicious. My mother really enjoyed this little dinner we had!!! I'm so glad that I was able to have her dine here with me for the first time!!! I'm sure this won't be her last because she is now HOOKED!!!! I'm sure she would want me to take care of the tab again also!!!! LOL!!!!"
Danielle P.,"Columbia, SC",266,162,404,2.0,5/30/2016,"Ive eaten at Cheesecake Factory at other locations and had a much better experience, so here we go....We arrive around 12ish on a sunday, which was a horrible time at the South Park mall, dont do it, unless U are jus that bored.  We waited approx 1hr, didnt leave because we knew all the other restaurants would have the same wait time. Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a ""hey how are U"" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said ""no its a Garnish and we cant do that"". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize.  The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child. But I feel U should give 100% at work at all times, if not GO home, plenty of people need a job. Im not always happy at work either but I make sure I dont reflect this in my service to the public. Once a manager or owner of a business has mastered this with there employees U will have happy customers who will wait and return. I went to Olive Garden the next day, and the staff were all 100% my waiter earned the 20% I left him. I never asked for anything, he was very professional and they were busy on Memorial Day!! Now this tops it off, before leaving I saw Miss Whitney show my receipt to the manager, I left no TIP, she made a weird face to him....really do U expect me to leave my hard earned money to someone who was rude to my family???  I wont return, my coins will B spent elsewhere....ENUFFSAID"
T. L.,"Charlotte, NC",1,132,343,4.0,9/25/2016,Went back to try Cheesecake Factory again. I must say our visit this time was very good. Our server Alex was excellent and the food was just as good. Even being a busy Saturday our food did not take long at all after placing our order.
Chelsea R.,"Charlotte, NC",280,28,24,4.0,10/18/2016,"You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory! I love this location because every time I am here I have GREAT service. I had the crab wontons as an appetizer (my favorite) which are always amazing, and the falafel salad. Anyone who knows me knows that I love me some falafel! The falafel was good but there was something about the dressing that I can't put my finger on that I didn't like, but the veggies tasted fresh and was good otherwise! Of course I couldn't leave there without getting myself cheesecake, and tried the pumpkin pie one which was absolutely delectable! Only other critique I have is that the tables are a little too close for comfort, while the others surrounding us were very friendly my friend and I couldn't have a conversation without one of our neighbors chiming in. But overall good experience!"
Vickie K.,"Charlotte, NC",0,3,,2.0,8/30/2017,"Had lunch at CF yesterday.  The food was terrible.  The french fries my son ordered were cold and soggy.  I had soup and salad.  The soup was cold and the salad was over dressed.  The couple next to us had sent their lunches back.  I overheard them state their food was raw.  They were brought new plates 15 minutes later and they didn't eat them.  All in all, not a good experience.  They need to employ a new day chef!"
