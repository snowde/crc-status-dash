Wei C.,"Markham, Canada",352,168,1293,4.0,1/8/2018,"Okay before the Cheese Cake Factory opened its first Canadian location in Yorkdale, most people's experience with the CCF that lived in the GTA was right here in Buffalo New York. Located in the Walden Galleria, the CCF serves a HUGE menu of traditional fare such as burgers, pastas, steaks, etc....and of course their famous cheesecakes.  No chain is as well known in these parts as for their huge selection of cheese cakes. Not only is the menu huge, the portions are also really big.  For big eaters like me its a blessing but for smaller eaters either get a lunch sized portion or just share a dish as you really need to save room for the cheese cakes which are always a delight. Service is very good and the vibe is very casual fine dining. The location here is great as its part of the mall and the line up is pretty non existent compared to the madness that is the Yorkdale location.  By the time you get your pager and finally get your food you could have already driven all the way to Buffalo and finished your dinner!  Haha! Love the CCF!"
Betty Y.,"Markham, Canada",0,7,16,5.0,1/1/2018,"This Cheesecake Factory is a great place to have a meal with friends or family. This location is located within the Walden Galleria mall so you can always shop around while you wait because the waits do range up until an hour sometimes. I came here multiple times and almost always had to wait, though the food was worth it. Many cheesecakes to choose from and large selection of meals as well!  The one thing I would recommend is to call ahead and see how long the wait time is. Also, their fish and chips weren't as great as the other items on the menu. Also...The portion sizes are huge!!"
Lauren S.,"Hamburg, NY",69,91,89,4.0,12/20/2017,"THE MENU IS INSANITY. There. my review is over. Ohh... you want to hear about the restaurant and the food ? Fine. I personally love the restaurant décor. The full bar is amazing, the stained glass is nice and I really enjoy the high ceilings. I don't like how close some of the tables are. We've been here about 5 times... and twice we have had to have conversations with the groups next to us because we are practically ontop of eachother. Now the food... It's either really really good, or really not good. I've had issues with just about all of the pasta dishes. The pasta is almost always over cooked and mushy. I stopped bothering to get pasta. The best appetizer we have ever had is the buffalo chicken eggrolls (SOO GOOD!). The best meal we have ever had was the roast beef au ju or the shrimp and chicken jumbo. Did I mention the menu is insanity ? No really... there is an option for  everyone. Kids menu, vegan menu, chicken, shrimp, beef, pork, salads, etc. The menu is probably about 10 pages, maybe more. Don't even get me started with the cheesecake...omg, every single piece is fantastic. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry. My husbands favorite is the vanilla bean. I have actually gotten him a full vanilla bean cheesecake from here for his birthday and it was just as good as in the restaurant. It's probably my favorite chain restaurant."
Sara P.,"Niagara Falls, NY",18,77,82,3.0,12/17/2017,"If given the choice between a chain and a locally owned and operated restaurant, I never hesitate towards the latter.  That being said, if I have a gift card, or am going out with friends who are picking where we go for the night, the Cheesecake Factory would be one of my top picks. Definitely a great place in terms of environment, the decorations, lighting, the dress of the wait staff and overall look are definitely pleasing.  The niceness of a fancy restaurant with a more casual feel.   They definitely have an extensive menu.  I tend to find the prices a little much in my opinion.  I ordered a chicken cheesesteak and chose the the side salad in place of the fries.  It sandwich was good, but the bread was a little on the hard side for my liking.  I'm sure that some people like the harder, crustier bread of the baguette, but personally I like something a little softer.  The salad was very plain, just lettuce with 2 slices of tomato.  At 13.95, it didn't seem to merit the extra $4 where I've gotten similar food for $10 at other local restaurants.  My husband got the chicken mediera which was really good.  The flavor and combination of mushrooms, cheese, and asparagus on the chicken was very good.  It was $19 which again I felt was a little much, but at least it had some special tastes to set it apart.   We did order a slice of the banana cream cheesecake which was excellent.  The lightness of the banana cream is a great combination for rich cheesecake.  I know cheesecake is fancy and special, but the piece does seem pretty steep at $8 for the smallness of the piece, it seems like they have gotten smaller over the years, but isn't that just the way of the world? Overall the food is good, but with the high prices for nothing extra special my overall rating can't be higher than a 3."
Michelle H.,"Markham, Canada",32,138,339,4.0,10/30/2017,"You gotta eat here when you're in buffalo!! I love the food and obviously their cheesecakes are the best ! I had the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic- the best pasta every. I would go easy on the peas as it is over powering when there's too much. It is a bow tie pasta with chicken, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms over a creamy parmesan sauce. The calamari app is not bad either, however nothing special. In terms of Cheesecake best one I like is the red velvet - super moist and creamy.  Service lacks as there's too much demand, food comes out fairly slow. Please grab a table first before shopping the wait time is usually minimum one hour !!"
Dilanee S.,"Toronto, Canada",92,164,228,4.0,9/24/2017,"So happy that I can finally say ""I went to the Cheesecake Factory."" Literally everyone I know has been here and has been raving about the cheesecake. I visited Buffalo for the weekend, and this place was def. #1 on my list. The service was good, our waitress was attentive and kind. She checked up on us, and made sure that we got our lunch and dessert on time. The food was good; huge portions, and a lot of meat (in the pasta I got), however the dishes can def. have more flavour towards them. I got the cajun jambalaya pasta, and it was such a huge portion filled with meat, which was tasty, but they said it was really spicy.. no, it wasn't spicy at all. The dessert.. was.. AMAZING! We got cheesecake (duh). I got the snickers bar chunks cheesecake and I also tried the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. I fell in love with the snickers bar chunks cheesecake, it was so good! Def. will be back if I'm in Buffalo again!"
Aly W.,"Newfane, NY",71,360,331,4.0,12/12/2017,"The great (but not as good as the calamari) dynamite shrimp I had at P.F. Changs today reminded me of the bad dynamite shrimp I had here a few weeks ago. I don't know if it's the batter or the oil they fry it in, but it has a really unpleasant aftertaste, and I feel like people should be warned.  That said, there's a lot to like about the Cheesecake Factory. Normally I don't review chains because people generally know what to expect, but in the case of this chain, that's stellar service and this location was no exception. Really, I wish I reviewed it that day because our server was excellent and deserves recognition. The too-large menu gets a lot of flack, but they do have some exceptional items, which is all the more reason to avoid the dynamite shrimp you can get just about anywhere. I wish I stuck with my staples like the shrimp scampi or the herb crusted salmon, or tried some of the lighter fare that actually sounded pretty appealing.  I still miss the shoe string fries they used to serve, but their honey mustard is still the same magic elixir I've always loved. We didn't get any cheesecake because it was the day before Thanksgiving, and I always make my special cheesecakes for the holidays.  Theirs are good, but mine are better."
Antoinina M.,"Buffalo, NY",84,33,48,3.0,11/13/2017,"The dinner was pretty tasty, but the service was a tad slow for there being few other people in the restaurant.  Prices are a little higher than I like to see.  Also, I find it very weird that I don't like their cheesecake whatsoever..."
Darryl C.,"Mississauga, Canada",50,65,209,4.0,7/5/2017,"I know it's a chain but I've always enjoyed going to The Cheesecake Factory. The food I've had is tasty and the portions are very generous. If there's something that's to be said about this place, it's that you almost always bring leftovers home.  My favorites are the fried mac and cheese and crab wontons for appetizers, bang bang chicken and shrimp and the cobb salad for mains, and you cannot go wrong with any of their famous cheesecakes for dessert, such as their fresh strawberry and salted caramel cheesecake. There are a few cheesecakes that I loved that are no longer offered such as pistachio white chocolate and the pineapple upside down cheesecake, hopefully they bring them back someday. Another great dessert is their strawberry shortcake, the cake is nice and light, not too sweet and the strawberries are fresh. I've never had a problem with the service, servers are generally friendly and some even try to strike up a conversation once they realize that you're from Canada. That being said I can't wait until the first Canadian location opens up at Yorkdale this fall."
Mario C.,"Bolton, Caledon, Canada",0,2,,5.0,1/6/2018,"My body was not ready for this experience. I had the plate of nachos to start and it was the greatest nachos I have ever tasted. For my main course I had the Hibachi Steak and I was not dissapointed! Everything was rich in flavor and the staff was courteous and kind. Chuck was our waiter, absolutely brilliant. 100/10 Thank you!"
Claire K.,"Tampa, FL",350,342,878,4.0,6/2/2017,"Solid franchise, consistent quality of food.  This occasion/review is for HAPPY HOUR. It's amazing! $5.95 for a huge list of appetizers to choose from and also drinks (Long Islands, Margaritas, Mojitos etc) are 5.95 as well. We selected the Factory Nachos & margaritas & were quite happy with both. In order to partake in said happy hour, you must sit in the bar area at the bar itself or the high tops that are available. Our service was spot on.  Thank you!"
Chantal Y.,"Toronto, Canada",43,84,316,4.0,5/9/2017,I love eating at this Californian chain. They make surprisingly really tasty pasta dishes.  The portions are gigantic for everything compared to Canada   If your ever having a day off just hop across to Buffalo to eat here and do some shopping. Monthly I'll spend a day here purchasing groceries at Wegmans and Walmart to get the cool flavours we don't have in Toronto.
Cari J.,"East Amherst, NY",161,84,43,4.0,12/3/2017,"I love me some locally-owned and operated cuisine, but a dinner at the Cheesecake Factory really hits the spot.  It's a chain, but it's casual yet elegant and sure to delight anyone in your party.  Even the bathrooms are gorgeous.  The menu is huge-- salads, burgers, pasta, flatbreads, chicken, soups....  My personal favorite thing to get is the Chinese Chicken Salad. It's tart and sweet with oranges, nuts, wontons, and a yummy dressing.  Other people in my party recently had salads as well. Because we were starving, we ordered the pot stickers appetizer and the asian lettuce chicken wraps.  Pot stickers were very good and drenched in yummy sauce.  The wraps were AMAZING though... lots of good green with flavorful chicken and a nice sauce to give it some pizzazz. Couldn't get enough.  The other stand-out to my latest visit was the service-- our waiter, Eddie, was funny, attentive, and brought the two birthday girls a special treat without being asked.  Next time, I will be sure to ask for him. Everyone also had a cocktail. As I was nursing a hangover, I just had a strawberry lemonade which was delicious and the glass was even coated in sugar. My girlfriend had a J.W.'s lemonade, which was similar to mine but with alcohol.   The only downside to this wonderful place is the price and the wait time. Can't really complain because they can't be punished for being popular nor making quality food.  My advice is to wait for a special occasion, put your name down with the hostess and pop in to Forever 21 or another store close to the restaurant with your beeper. I know this is ""cheesy"" (get it?), but I love this place!"
Andrea L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",139,242,331,4.0,4/10/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory food never disappoints.. flavors are consistent, portions are huge; great for sharing. I usually stop by here for lunch or dinner after hours of cross-border shopping. We arrived around 2PM on a Saturday and were starving.. had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. When we got seated, I noticed that there were actually a ton of empty tables.. just not enough staff to clean and wait them.. disappointing. I ordered the BBQ chicken ranch salad (lunch portion) and it was massive. The salad comes with chicken, beans, avocado, tomatoes, corn and deep fried onion rings on top.. all pre-tossed in the dressing...so delicious! Amongst 2 people, we attempted to share a slice of the toasted marshmallow smores galore cheesecake but was not able to finish it after our meal. All of their cheesecakes are incredibly rich and sweet..so it is probably best to share with at least 3 people per slice..it can get sickening quite quickly! Overall..service was slow and water was never refilled.. would be the cherry on top if the service was better!"
Celina L.,"Vaughan, Canada",111,155,327,5.0,5/7/2017,"It was super packed on Saturday evening, with a wait time of 40 minutes for a table for two. However, after being seated, service was attentive and lovely. It's always a great experience here and I would highly recommend coming and trying one of the many many different items on their menu. Their skinnylicious menu provides low calorie options, yet still large portions and super tasty! I ordered the Asian chicken salad and Diane's steak. Yum yum yum! Bread is refillable, and you definitely will need to ask for more of that brown honey flax bread! We took Cheesecake to go (get the Salted Caramel!)"
Lizzy G.,"Sperenberg, Am Mellensee, Germany",0,21,4,1.0,11/26/2017,The food here is normally good but today for some reason it just was not. I wasn't to happy because the food was cold the sauce was watery and the first time the dish came out wrong. They didn't even take off the dish and that was very disappointing. They should of taken it off. Very disappointing trip to Cheesecake Factory. I hope they learn from this review and to not be so rude about it.
Arka K.,"Waterfront, Buffalo, NY",40,38,60,4.0,8/24/2017,"If you love cheesecake, this is the place. A bit expensive, but worth it. As a chocolate lover, their Godiva chocolate cheesecake is my favorite."
Debarghya D.,"Buffalo, NY",25,32,54,5.0,8/20/2017,"If you love cheesecake, you have to be here! Though they have a full menu other than cheesecake, we primarily go there for cheesecake. One slice of their cheesecake is so big, you can comfortably share it or keep it for a second serving.  A cheesecake lover as me and friend, this place is another name of the food heaven!!"
Allie A.,"Mississauga, Canada",119,46,81,2.0,2/22/2017,"My heart is so sad to give my visit here a two star review.  Overly salted pasta water made noodles on two dishes impossible to enjoy. An hour and a half wait for one person's entree. No tartar sauce on a fish and chips dish, and the sauce didn't come for an hour, leaving the fish cold. Sides were mixed up and burgers weren't cooked to established preference. Abundance of used dishes on the table for long periods of time. The server and manager sympathized with us as the kitchen staff poorly worked around our table. A few cheesecakes were offered with compliments... the cheesecakes couldn't be screwed up though. They're baked out of house. Keep in mind: my visit was probably a very rare occurrence; furthermore, it was President's Day/Ontario Family Day, so it was also insanely busy.  That said, some of the food was great. Some highlights: Calamari had a super flaky and crispy batter with just the right amount of salty, peppery seasoning.  The nachos, although they had a processed American cheese, were fried in a puffed style. Super delicious.  My chicken piccata, outside of the overly salted angel hair pasta, had a delicious lemon, caper, and mushroom sauce with a perfect balance of taste.  Not too citrusy or salty. The offering of a lunch menu with smaller portions and less expensive pricing was great.  I really do want to give this place another chance. I'm just upset that the bad experience happened to me... on my birthday. Call me a princess. :("
Caitlyn P.,"Buffalo, NY",79,64,177,4.0,2/27/2017,"Celebrated my sisters birthday here last night! Party of 8 and we arrived for dinner at 7:30. This restaurant doesn't take reservations which stinks, so we ended up waiting till about 8 o'clock to be seated on a Sunday night. I was pretty shocked it was so packed. By 830 though; the restaurant had cleared out tremendously.  We had ordered 2 orders of cheese burger sliders to start. Those were good. For dinner I always usually order the turkey club with French fries. They use real turkey breast so it's always a good, quick meal and good left overs.  Everyone ordered something different. There spicy chicken sandwich is very good. My brother ordered a version of chicken parm. It was a huge piece of chicken in the shape of a pizza, so just a big circle of chicken with angel hair pasta over it. It looked funny, but he said it was yummy and ate it. We had people order Parmesan crusted chicken, a salad, burgers.. everyone enjoyed their meals. My dad did order the chicken biscuits and gravy for dinner and specifically told the waitress no mushrooms. The waitress came back and said they made it with mushrooms do you want us to re make it or can you pick the mushrooms out? My dad asked them to re make it. Then she came back again when we all were basically done eating and said that the mushrooms are apart of the gravy, so my dad just didn't even bother ordering something else he just didn't have an entree. It was okay though because we had the sliders before hand and so much food to share with him.  Many people ordered cheese cake which is always delicious. I was too full at that point! Overall I would say the food here is pretty good. They have an absolutely ginormous menu so you will always find something you like.  Cons are it's always packed, wait time is long and the minor incident with my dads meal. Otherwise I have never had an issues here and I always enjoy my meal!"
Louise P.,"Vaughan, Canada",28,129,40,5.0,8/29/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge, the kitchen makes everything to order, the service is great, and there is a multitude of cheesecake at the end, what's not to love?? My friends and I will occasionally take a drive down to Buffalo to check out the offerings at Target and Trader Joe's, but we always have to stop at The Cheesecake Factory for lunch. The service is consistently great, and the food is always fabulous. I can't wait for my next trip!"
Laleh H.,"Markham, Canada",6,113,48,5.0,7/25/2017,"Any shopping trip to the US is not complete without a trip to the Cheesecake Factory! I love that this location is nestled beside Walden Galleria, because it is one of 3 places i love to go shopping when i go across the border. I love the town of Amherst because it offers the best dining & hotel options minus the crazy pricing of being right at the falls. The Cheesecake Factory is a shopping stop tradition! We were seated immediately and we were served by one of the best servers i've had at a restaurant. She offered suggestions and explained portion sizes etc. We discussed allergy concerns immediately and she assured us of what was safe to eat and further explained to us that EVERYTHING on the menu was made/cooked fresh to order"". I remembered this based on our experience at their other brand The Grand Luxe Cafe.  The kids menu had a great variety of items. Our kids chose tenders & fries. We were going to order 2, but our server suggested 1 as the portion was large enough for them to share. Grateful for that! I ordered the Asian chicken salad (minus the almonds). HUGE portion, i couldn't finish it. Fresh ingredients, tasted as good as if i had made it at home myself! I really wish i had taken a photo of it to show how large the salad was, but i couldn't help digging in as soon as it was set in front of me! My hubby ordered one of their fantastic burgers (Kobe Burger). He was so happy that it was cooked perfectly, large portion, seasoned well. We also ordered an appetizer to share (which we took back to our hotel). Lastly we ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake - Red Velvet Cheesecake & Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake. Absolutely delicious! I am really looking forward to the location opening at Yorkdale Mall in Toronto - i hope the standard of service & quality doesn't change! We didn't need to flag our server down even once. She topped up our drinks, cleared the plates and packaged up our cheesecakes to go so they wouldn't get warm in the car while we shopped. Fantastic experience all around. We look forward to going back soon!"
Ryan B.,"Markham, Canada",73,35,215,5.0,7/14/2017,"Shockingly, 2 weeks ago was my first time ever going to the cheese cake factory, and oh my god was it ever delicious. I came all the way from Toronto just to try this famous American chain, believe me, it was worth the 2.5 hour drive. Everything just taste so unhealthy in the most delicious way, I really can't explain it haha.  Thankfully this cheese cake factory has a few selections of Canadian beers, Canadians rejoice. Started off with the buffalo wings, yup you guessed it, they were my favourite by far and the best I've tried;the perfect balance between crispy and soft. My girlfriend got the eggplant parmigiana, served with a pesto spaghettini. The sauce used on the eggplant was incredible, it upsets me that the food was this good because unlike other chain restaurants that lack in flavour ,usually, this one is completely opposite. Anyways back to the dishes. I ordered a serious artery clogger, the mac and cheese burger. The most delicious mac and cheese you can ever imagine, battered and formed into a patty served on top of a medium cooked angus burger, which was heaven might I add, and in between a brioche bun. It was intense, you need to experience it.  The best part of all was the cheese cake. My words won't do justice. just go try any of them, I'm sure they're all equally delicious.  I'll definitely be back one day."
Elaine O.,"Toronto, Canada",13,28,77,4.0,7/13/2017,"This is mainly a review on the cheesecakes I've tried from this place, rather than the actual food. So of course having a sweet tooth I decided to pick up two flavours to try and I got dulce de leche caramel cheesecake and vanilla bean cheesecake. The dulce de leche cheesecake was sweeter with layers of caramel and topped with almonds. The vanilla bean cheesecake was a lighter, less sweet cheesecake compared to the other one I got. However I was pleased with both the flavours I got, and it's definitely a size good enough to share with other people. Hoping to try out more of the different flavours so will for sure come back!"
Rachel L.,"Buffalo, NY",40,112,123,4.0,12/5/2016,"I love that The Cheesecake Factory has options for people who are trying to make healthy choices.  Their ""Skinnylicious Menu"" is really well done.   I usually get the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic Shrimp, which is a light pasta dish.  It is a good dish for me if I am average hungry to not that hungry.  If I am really hungry I have some of the bread basket or add a salad.   I came here with friends a few weeks ago and had just made a similar pasta dish at home so I didn't want to order it.  Instead I ordered the Skinnylicious soft tacos with shrimp.  It came with a somewhat tangy sauce and a side dish of vegtables (marinated cucumber?).  Both dishes were delicious!! I didn't feel at all like I had been deprived and wasn't even tempted to order cheesecake.  I love that about TCF - they try to make the experience and meal special no matter what you order!"
Annna S.,"Toronto, Canada",3,28,48,2.0,6/13/2017,"I used to always come here to have dinner when I cross the border. I usually come here once-twice a year. The last 3 times I came were all bad experiences. Cold steak, poor service and raw chicken salad..  I never thought I would write such a bad review about this place but this very last time made me really want to write this up.  I went with my boyfriend and we got seats within 20 minutes. We sat down and then another server asked us to move to another table because there was a ""party"" coming in.  Pros  The bread is always fresh Cheesecake never disappoints  Chinese chicken salad DRESSING is good Cons  Poor service Fettuccini Alfredo (bland) Chicken from the salad was RAW The chicken from the salad was raw and requested for their ""made-to-order guacamole"". It was not fresh at all and required more lime and salt. When the server came to drop our dish off, she spilled half the chips on the floor.  I can't wait til the Cheesecake Factory opens up in yorkdale in Toronto! Next time I'm in Buffalo, I'll make sure to go to the Italian restaurant across.. or better yet McDonalds.  I will only get cheesecake from now on."
Hania A.,"Buffalo, NY",64,60,760,3.0,5/16/2017,"went for drinks and cheese cake their drinks are very commercial like the cocktails sold in supermarket, not strong, too sweet and taste artificial the cheesecake is always good, this time i tried the hazelnut crunch cheesecake with drizzled Nutella on top, anything with Nutella is amazing and the cheesecake had a soft blonde brownie on the bottom with rich creamy hazelnut layer and crunch in between the service is always good and fast"
Ging S.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",11,91,51,3.0,5/24/2017,"The good old Toronto to Buffalo day trip! However they are opening a Toronto location this coming fall. Wait time can be an issue for some, but at least you get to browse the pretty cheese cakes on display and ponder which one to get. That is if you still have room at the end of your main course.  Got to sample the shrimp angel hair pasta and meatloaf. The flavor (""flavour"" for Canadians) on the main courses are a little muted, but the sides were so much more bolder. Could use a balance. Portions are large and filling. The original cheese cake was fluffy, not hard and dense like traditional cheesecake. Worth a repeat visit just for cheesecakes. Service was super efficient. They ran the place like clockwork."
Sam A.,"Brampton, Canada",49,158,490,4.0,10/12/2016,"I mentioned this in my review of their sister company, The Grand Lux Cafe, but I LOVE cheesecake factory lol. Whenever we go to Buffalo it is our go to lunch/dinner spot. There is always a wait but the most we've had to wait was probably 20-30 minutes.  It's usually less. Almost everything I've ever tried at Cheesecake has been amazing.  The only thing I ever regret getting is the oreo cheesecake.  It is definitely not was you expect it to be and I did not enjoy it at all.    Their red velvet cheesecake is their signature cheesecake and ALWAYS a must whenever I go.  However, this particular trip, I got the pumpkin cheesecake and omg, to die for!  SO GOOD. During this trip for my entree, I ordered from the skinnylicious menu and ordered the grilled steak medallions.  My one friend ordered the orange chicken and my other friend ordered a burger (I forgot which one).  My dish was definitely made to be skinnylicious as it was basically just half of what the regular order would be.  There were 4 steak medallions and a smudge of mash potatoes.  It was actually a little funny, but it was the perfect amount of food for me.  The steak was cooked exactly how I asked and it wasn't chewy. I killed everything in 2 seconds and wasn't hungry after.   My friends on the other hand both had to take half their food home.  The orange chicken was actually pretty good.  I had a few pieces.  The gravy my gf got on the side for her fries was absolute real gravy.  You could taste it and there were chunks of meat in the sauce. Service is meh.  I don't think I've ever had exceptional service nor severely poor service.  This particular visit our server took forever to come back to our table after we were done eating.  It was a mission to get our bills.  However, this doesn't happen all the time."
Sharon R.,"Waterloo, Canada",0,13,25,3.0,5/22/2017,This a great place to indulge after doing credit card damage in Galleria Mall! The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice. Very flavourful without being too spicy. Lots of food!! I also had the chocolate mousse cheesecake! Awesomeness!!
Deb L.,"Court House, Arlington, VA",21,4,4,5.0,12/9/2017,Love this restaurant!! Best deal for your money is at happy hour.. you get to try out alot for your money.  And have a good beverage as well..
Samantha C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",9,123,41,4.0,6/13/2017,"Who doesn't love The Cheesecake Factory?  I've been to this location a number of times and while we find the portions have gotten smaller  and prices have risen, which, understandably so, the prices of everything has gone up, is still a fantastic option for any occasion. The menu is massive and anyone from the foodie to the picky eater will be able to find something that appeals to them.  Some of my favourite items are the chicken Madeira, chicken and biscuits, cajun chicken littles, louisiana chicken pasta, basically any chicken dish from the favourites pages! They also have steak, seafood, salads, burgers, basically everything.  I did notice on my last visit that they seem to have eliminated a lot of the menu, which for me is good as I find the choices to be overwhelming, to have 6 pages of 'favourites' seems a bit ridiculous so i'm glad they're streamlined the menu and focused on the best of the best. It is unfortunate for those whose favourite items have been eliminated however. It seems that they had some items on a special menu which the server described as new 'test' items, some of which would be added to the menu. These items were significantly lower in price which made them enticing to try. I opted for one of these test items called chicken riesling, which was some grilled chicken topped with a riesling sauce, with bacon, mushrooms and onions served with a buttered pasta. The chicken was delicious, the portion was large enough for dinner and then a small lunch the next day, The pasta was a bit bland, I guess the riesling sauce could have also been used for the pasta, but there wasn't quite enough of this sauce. Overall it was delicious still. The portions have become less ridiculous, some members of my family were able to finish their entire meals, which before was an utter impossibility.  The service was great as usual, bread and water refills were offered regularly and our server was friendly and sincere. The restaurant is spacious and beautiful. The cheesecake fridge at the front is filled with delicious options which is great for looking at while waiting for a table. This place seems to be popular among tourists like me who have come across the border for a shopping day, but also seems to be popular among locals. Be prepared to wait at peak times!!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant after a day or a lunch break from shopping at the mall. You'll get good service, big portions of food for your money and i've really never been disappointed with my meal. The only thing is that the prices have risen marginally, likely just to keep up with food prices, and the exchange rate is a bit crazy right now so you're looking at meals costing at least $20-$30 Canadian per person depending on what you eat, which of course is not the restaurant's fault, but it isn't the amazing value that it used to be for us Canadians!"
Nadia J.,"Woodbridge, Vaughan, Canada",0,15,,1.0,11/27/2017,First of all the seats were dirty the table was dirty. The food was so salty we had to send it back and it came back tasting the same. Utensils were dirty. Plates were dirty. At least the server was really nice. Not the service I was expecting when celebrating my 16th birthday. Kinda made my day suck
Jess L.,"Buffalo, NY",6,109,90,4.0,4/22/2017,"For a chain restaurant, the food here is pretty good. The drinks needed some serious work though. Quite a few of us ordered drinks that tasted like only juice/mixer. I had the skinny cosmo and skinny mojito, both were so sweet I couldn't drink them. Tasted like nothing but simple syrup. They were accommodating though and replaced them, I opted for a standard mixed drink and a beer. For food, I got the shrimp scampi which came with asparagus. It was delicious and had a lot of flavor. The rest of the table all ordered the happy hour appetizers. The appetizers here are huge! Not small, half size happy hour sizes, but are big enough for a full meal.  Their nachos are very good and I tried a wonton and that was tasty as well. Overall, I'll definitely go again, especially if looking for some food at happy hour time, but stay away from the specialty from the happy hour sugar-filled drinks."
Thuy P.,"Saint Paul, MN",1,36,99,2.0,8/29/2017,"I was visiting from out of town and stayed at the Buffalo Millennium, which is only a two minute drive to the Walden Galleria and The Cheesecake Factory. Having heard about the Cheesecake Factory prior and how they're infamous for their cheesecake, I was curious as to how the establishment tastes, feels and looks. With most places in the Buffalo area closing around 10 P.M; it left us with fairly limited options when our stomachs finally decided its been 10 hours since lunch and we should probably eat. If I were to describe Cheesecake Factory in a short sentence, I'd say: It's kind of like Olive Garden but with cheesecake. We stopped by a late Saturday night and the place was loud and bustling. Loud chatter, laughter and exhausted looking servers roaming around. The place was huge in size and almost completely packed. We had to wait our turn to be seated and the hostess seemed agitated and really half assed her service. Neither of us were enjoying the vibe and atmosphere, not to mention how loud the few tables next to us were. We came to terms that service will be forgetful and mediocre due to the high volumes of customers, which is understandable. It took a while before the server made their round to take our orders. For appetizers, we got some cheesy bread that accompanied two dipping sauces. Unfortunately, both dipping sauces were cold. It still boggles my mind why the marinara sauce was cold and the other dipping sauce was supposedly a ""parmesan salsa"" but it was nothing but cold grease. The garlic bread was fine however. Warm, soft and cheesy, but a bit too greasy for our liking. Overall, the appetizer was not worth the 10$. We realized we made the mistake of ordering bread as an appetizer, when two small loafs of bread came as a complementary starter. These other loaves of bread were clearly better. They were fresh and warm, but they were paired with butter that came in small packages. So much for being fresh.  As for the main course, we decided upon pasta: Angel Hair with Shrimp and Spicy Chipotle Chicken Penne. Our server came back apologetic for the slow service, and presented us with two very large servings. There was no way one person could finish these plates, especially after so much bread. My friend's plate looked normal, but mine was something else... even while writing this review, I'm still pondering what was used as the pasta's topping. Everything looked fine, but not the crispy chips sprinkled everywhere on this penne. The crispy chips infiltrated the flavor palette and eventually got mushy, making it even more difficult to finish this dish. The penne was cooked fine, the sauce was mediocre, chicken was meh, but the crispy toppings just completely ruined it. After about ten bites, I was absolutely done. My friend had no complaints with the angel hair pasta until they came across a huge chunk that remained attached and uncooked. I'm not sure what went wrong. Maybe it was too busy of a night and mistakes just happened or is this typically how the food is? In Minneapolis, a 60$ meal for two would be enough for some four or five star quality dining.  I left rather disappointed and regretting paying this much for a few bites. However, Steven M. was a great server. He was the saving grace to our dinner disaster. Charismatic, attentive, and very apologetic. We were impressed with his calm mannerism and ability to juggle so many orders, while paying attention to ours. My final thoughts: the place was loud, I could've had pasta from a frozen entree, but service was pleasant thanks to Steven."
Alexa L.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",195,118,173,2.0,8/28/2017,"Oh Cheesecake Factory... I never thought I'd write a negative review for you. I've had the best meals here except tonight was a disappointment. My table ordered three items off the skinnylicious menu ( ceaser  salad , chicken lettuce wraps and Chinese chicken salad). The Chinese chicken salad was not up to its usual standard... Wilted lettuce, maybe 5 RICE sticks etc. Thank god someone at my table volunteered to eat it cause I wouldn't. When we told our waitress it wasn't good she replied with ""oh...that's too bad"". Not impressed. We paid the bill and left. That's too bad cheesecake. We won't be back."
Erin B.,"Buffalo, NY",24,91,41,4.0,2/5/2017,"I'm rarely in Cheektowaga, but I was out with my mom and my son shopping in the area when we decided to use some Cheesecake Factory gift cards that we had.  The parking situation sucks on this side of the mall, unless you pay for valet, so we were just about frozen solid by the time we made it into the building.  (Then my son threw a fit because he decided right then that he wanted the toy he left in the car- sorry, buddy, I'm not going back out into the tundra to get your Matchbox car.)   It was around 2pm on a Saturday, so we had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  We passed the time by drooling over the cheesecakes in the big showcase and admiring the architecture and decor. Once seated, we were served complimentary bread and butter, which was delicious.  I should have asked for the name of the brown bread with the oats on it.  It's divine! Our food came out surprisingly quickly.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad, Mom ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich, and RJ ordered a pepperoni pizza from the kids menu.  I *know* this is going to sound ridiculous to many of you, but I was disgusted by the size of the portions.  These plates are too big.  I am an eater, don't get me wrong, but the portions here are EXCESSIVE.  (Reference my photos.)  I would MUCH rather pay a slightly smaller price for less food on my plate than have a monstrosity of a dish come out and take up the entire table.  My salad was served on an 18-inch-long plate and piled about 6 inches high.  My mom's sandwich was actually three full sandwiches.  The pizza for my 6-year-old could have fed two grown adults.  When Europeans make fun of ""American portions"", this is why.  I don't know why it bothered me so much, but it was all just too much food.  It all looked ridiculous. They should seriously consider making their portions smaller and more manageable and cutting the price down a tad.  It would make it all so much more appealing. The service was good this time.  Other times we've visted, it hasn't been as good (servers with attitude, lack of attentiveness, etc) so they must've had a good team on.  They were pretty busy, and our waitress did apologize for not coming back for some time after checking on our food, which was ok since we were good on drinks and everything anyway.   Our total came to about $35 for two adult entrees, two waters, a kid entree and lemonade.  Is it cheap?  Not really, but the food is good and the service is good, depending on the day.  And if you feel like spending $7 on a slice of cheesecake, I've heard it's delicious."
Samantha B.,"Schiller Park, Buffalo, NY",29,6,,3.0,11/16/2017,I went here for dinner last Thursday with my friends and the restaurant wasn't busy so we figured we would be able to get out in time for the movie but that was not the case. For them being so slow it took a very long time to get the food we ordered and the waitress only came over to deliver our food and get the check.
Lindsay P.,"Buffalo, NY",51,160,110,3.0,1/30/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is ALWAYS crazy. My friend and I chose to sit at the bistro tables by the bar, which are full service and seat yourself. It does mean that service is sometimes a bit slower, but in my opinion it is better than waiting initially! Cheesecake Factory has the largest menu of anywhere I have been. They have everything from salad, to seafood, to sandwiches, to lite fair, to pasta. They always send out bread and butter (as much as you like) to start. Today, I got a BBQ burger and fries. The burger was cooked to my specification. It was large, and came topped with cheese, ranch, lettuce, and a stack of crispy onion rings. The BBQ sauce came on the side, which was nice, because it kept the bread from getting soggy, and allowed me to put on as much or as little as I wanted. We didn't order cheesecake on this trip, but if you have never been, the peanut butter cup cheesecake is amazing... do yourself a favor and bring some home!"
Alexia D.,"Angus, Canada",75,14,36,5.0,3/19/2017,"Well we drove to Buffalo ( 2.5 hours from our home in Canada) to our favourite restaurant in the world. It was amazing as usual. Love the fresh bread and large drinks that are provided. My husband and kids find the Lemonade too sweet. But it's just right for me . We started with the fresh Nachos and Calamari. I had my regular Jamaican shrimp with pineapple salsa and plantains. I substituted the rice for mashed potatoes this time. The rest of he family had the Steak Diane,  shrimp and Salmon No complaints. The food is consistent each time you go. We were stuffed and took cheesecakes and chocolate cake to go. I can't wait to get home and eat that as well. It's certainly worth the drive for delicious tasty food."
