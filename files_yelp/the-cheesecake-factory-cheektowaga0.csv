Sun B.,"Cupertino, CA",0,36,,4.0,7/25/2014,Of course they have a large menu. I always have the avocado rolls as an appetizer. Shared the big burrito and the Louisiana chicken pasta. The burrito was disappointing with the insides overcooked but my friend liked it. The Louisiana chicken was good with good breading and nice taste. Not spicy though.  The others in my group liked their food. I think they had the smokehouse burger and chicken salad.
Rachel Q.,"Buffalo, NY",0,8,,3.0,8/7/2015,"The food was really good. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta and was pleasantly surprised. However the wait time to get seated (there are no reservations or call-aheads) was ridiculous, and the wait to get our food was also lengthy."
Keith A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,165,79,4.0,5/7/2015,"This place is always consistently delicious with the crispy chicken Costaletta. Sat outside, decent service, little pricy as always but some dang good food."
Dan L.,"Markham, Canada",135,239,124,3.0,4/22/2015,usually when i drop by buffalo we'll make a trip to the cheesecake factory. the menu is pretty extravagant and it's always hard to pick what you want to order. this might be a flaw in my opinion as i'm never too impressed with the meals. they'll suffice but it's never amazing. i feel if they cut out a lot of their menu items and focus on some of their best entrees they can make those REALLY good. the cheesecake of course. always delicious. i don't really like sweets or cakes in general. i find these right on the verge of being a little to sweet for me but i still enjoy it cus it's not like i have it everyday. my favourite is the ultimate red velvet. it literally is like velvet. so smooth all the way through. i really want to try the pumpkin ones as i love pumpkin pie. my last trip i also ordered the mango key lime i think. it was quite good however i didn't know there were coconut shavings for the bottom crust. i do not like coconut at all so i had to separate that part in order to enjoy the rest of it. if you do like coconut though. the coconut flavour was definitely there as well as the texture and everything else awful about coconut. side note: american's gonna wonder why i spell favourite and flavour with 'U's
Ed S.,"Bemus Point, NY",9,14,10,1.0,2/3/2015,"Been coming here for years.. Ordered the Cuban on recommendation of the nice waitress.. I'm sure I have had it before. Place is empty, but the sounds of construction workers banging on ibeams on the other side of the wall adds a nice ambiance to my meal. Cuban showed up.. Mayo literally gooped up and dripping off the sides. Meats all askew. Too much garlic in the ceaser salad...  My wife just told me the bathrooms are disgusting!!!  Cheesecake Factory, I still appreciate you..  But I won't be back anytime soon!"
Sascha K.,"Hamilton, Canada",17,116,34,4.0,4/17/2014,This is my 2nd time at the cheesecake factory. I ordered a Turkey burger on a lettuce bun with a salad. I was pleasantly surprised...the burger was moist and better than I expected. I brought a slice of red velvet cheesecake to take home...it's just sooo cheesy lol A little too creamy for me. I know everyone raves about their cheesecakes but I much rather have a nice homemade one
Nicole M.,"Buffalo, NY",4,22,,3.0,6/21/2015,Extensive menu but as I thought it means that most of it isnt that great. Best cheesecake ever. Recommend going for dessert. Always great customer service.
Kaylynn A.,"Buffalo, NY",68,249,3,2.0,3/5/2013,"I came here with my boyfriend last night because we had a gift card. I always hate how close the tables are. We were right next to another couple. At one point, I had texted him something because the place was so loud and I didn't want the other couple to hear my story. Also, they are so close, that when the table next to us was leaving, they were knocking into our table while we were eating. I think if I go back, I will just ask for a booth, even though the wait will be longer.  The food was decent but it took FOREVER to get our dinners. We ordered the mini corn dogs for an appetizer (I'm a sucker for them) and it was about 20 min between when they took our app plates to when our dinner came. And we didn't get anything that took too incredibly long to make. I got the chicken salad sandwich, and Bradley got a chicken sandwich. Also my #1 pet peeve is when I order something, in this case blue cheese on the side, and it doesn't come with the meal. It actually didn't even come at all, because the waitress didn't check on us after she dropped off the meal. All-in-all, it was just an okay visit. It was what I expected it to be."
Schon B.,"Nashville, TN",16,46,9,4.0,6/9/2014,"Service is hit and miss here. I only gave 4 stars on this trip due to mediocre service in the past. Laun was my server today. Thus far he has been very attentive and seems to like what he does. Refills were brought out, food was hot and prepared as ordered. When I visit again, I will ask for him again as he made the experience pretty good."
Joyce L.,"Markham, Canada",81,79,119,5.0,2/23/2014,Love it best cheesecake I've had in my entire life. Service was amazing! I love the atmosphere
Isaac E.,"North York, Canada",153,293,4,4.0,6/27/2012,"I've been to this location a bunch of times on weekend trips to Buffalo. Sometimes I think I just go down to Buffalo in order to just go to the Cheesecake Factory....Sometimes I'm right. I love the Avocado Springrolls and the BBQ Salmon. I also enjoy getting their Grilled Ahi Tuna with Edemame. My only problem that I have when I get there is that I eat WAY too much in order to justify cheesecake for dessert at the end of the meal which is the main reason why I go. The staff tends to consistently be running about and they talk QUICK which can lead to poor service. However, the food in my honest opinion makes up for a lot of this. It's worth the wait and it's worth the drive down from Toronto."
Back B.,"Dovercourt, Toronto, Canada",0,19,46,2.0,9/29/2013,"The only thing good is the cheesecake. Everything else is a sideshow.  I had the chicken pasta. Pasta wasn't al dente. The chicken wasn't juicy. It was tender, but it wasn't juicy with sweet juicy oozing out.  Stick with just the cake and you won't be too disappointed."
Ver A.,"Toronto, Canada",11,49,69,3.0,8/21/2013,"The decor of the restaurant make you fell like your on vacation.   The washrooms need mor stalls and working toilets.  I had the deep fried macaroni and cheese balls which were pretty good.   The miso salmon was really good but was disappointed to only see 5 pieces of snow peas on my plate. I was even going to ask to replace the rice with more veg good thing I didn't otherwise I would've only had 10.  The plate was dirty from the miso sauce on the outside of my plate which grossed me out.   Also, ordered a green tea and the mug was filthy I asked for a new glass and it seemed he just washed it quickly and it was still dirty.   I took the vanilla bean and Reece cheesecake to go the were both heaven."
James T.,"Buffalo, NY",0,4,2,5.0,5/4/2015,I just had dinner here and as always the food and service was outstanding. Over the past two years I have eaten here at least 10 times and I have never been disappointed.
Jenny T.,"Toronto, Canada",224,331,122,5.0,6/11/2011,"If this chain came to Canada, we'd all be as fat as the Americans.  Their menu is huge and each of their dishes can feed an entire family.  They have the type of dishes that make everyone say ""oooh"" or ""ahhh"" when it comes out and they are all photo worthy.  Any American dish you can think of, they will have and more. Wasn't able to try any of their cheesecakes, but they look amazing, and huge and they come in flavours like key lime, coconut, chocolate, etc.  Only warning I have is that the wait for this restaurant was about 1 hour, but luckily they have one of those buzzer things you can carry around with you while you shop in the mall - so if you plan to eat here go and get a spot first!"
Heather V.,"Depew, NY",76,5,,3.0,3/15/2015,"After about 12 visits over 4 years: 1. Wish it would be expanded. Always an 45 minute wait or more on the weekends. 2. Request a booth or it feels like you're dining with the couples to your left and right. No privacy between tables. 3. Some servers are good, some aren't. No surprise there. 4. Went there last night to celebrate my fiancees bday: We were sitting for about 7 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. The table that was sat after us ordered their drinks and appetizer before anyone came to our table. Our server brought us old bread and asked if we wanted anything to drink...we waited another 5 minutes before she came back with our drinks. I ordered the skinnylicious turkey burger. On the menu it says "" Combined with Fresh Mushrooms, Garlic and Spices. Served with Grilled Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo and a Green Salad"" The salad was a good size and pretty good! The burger was a good size. But there was no mushrooms, and no grilled onions on my turkey burger. Our server, wore pigtails and had a very hipitched child like voice..  It was slightly irritating. Lol and waiting for refills and not being offered a dessert menu was a little annoying.  We asked for a dessert menu and waited another 6 minutes for that. We got the lemon meringue cheesecake.. Omg.. It. Was.amazing. overall, decent  food, although made wrong, and server wasnt all too attentive."
Jen Y.,"Buffalo, NY",123,213,402,4.0,4/28/2011,"The portions are huge, my favorite is the da vinci pasta, the sauce is AMAZING. The free bread basket is also delicious-warm, fresh baked with different varieties. The garlic shrimp angel hair pasta is also very good, same as the orange chicken and their salad entrees. I can't speak for sandwich or burger dishes since i've never ordered them before. The menu is very extensive with lots of different options. All the cheesecakes are amazing, and large pieces, great for sharing. The prices are steep, but if you dont order alcoholic beverages, then food alone is worth the price you pay. You can taste the freshness and quality of their ingredients. I would stay away on weekends though, because the mall is packed with shoppers/tourists/families. It would be not only a VERY long wait (they dont take reservations) but also the service wont be as great. I would suggest scoping out the bar area before waiting over an hour for a table. One thing i do really appreciate - their draft beers are always amazingly cold - and served in chilled glasses. I hate it when places serve you beer with just out of the dishwasher warm glasses."
Ryan V.,"Chino, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2015,First I was on hold for 10 minutes before they took my call. Then after picking up the order and getting to the hotel no utensils or napkins.
Dorothy C.,"Vaughan, Canada",23,83,31,4.0,11/26/2014,Pretty much your standard Cheesecake Factory. No complaints.
Amir K.,"Hamburg, Germany",19,24,4,4.0,2/9/2014,"I've had a Filet Mignon. The filet was just a little bit overcooked, the meat was awesome! Really delicious!  Fried were served besides that, unfortunately they had onion rings on top (wasn't mentioned on the menu). I can not recommend the sugarless iced tea. Paying was a bit of a mess in a group of 6. It was not possible to split the bill ourselves.  The waiter was still fun, the cheesecakes impressive and the steak really good."
