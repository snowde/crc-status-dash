Iris L.,"Newport, PA",0,22,26,1.0,8/13/2016,I am not sure what's going on there but it used to be better.  Served five different people not all at the same time.  Like not just minutes later like 10 minutes later.  The orange chicken was great for my son and his friend but our meals were not good.  The only thing good is the desert.  will not go to this Cheesecake Factory again.
Marcella I.,"Saint Catharines, Canada",14,2,,1.0,11/7/2016,"Where do i start... 1) their drinks were watered down 2) ordered 2 drinks at the same time...only got 1 after 20 minutes of waiting...had to ask again for the other one...waited some more 3) salmon was dry 4) asked for a WELL DONE burger.. but it was pink...pretty sure it was raw..not sure if they even cooked it 5) specifically said 3x NO PEAS on the pasta...came back with a plate full of peas on pasta 6)manager approaches to tell us they dont have the appetizer we ordered...10 minutes later returns to say they ALSO ran out of the pasta we ordered... 7)3 out of 6 people ordered pasta..only 1 person got served cheese..when trying to get the cheese womans attention she completly walked away disregarding everyone else on the table 8)nobody cleared our table...instead WE were TOLD to clean it ourselves 9) no bread refills 10) when mentioning our concerns to the manager he said he would ""figure it out"".....and completly disappeard and let his NEW staff deal with the situation 11) had to continously ask for the manager because he disappeared to god knows where 12) had to ring in the bill 9 TIMES before it was printed correctly because they DOUBLE charged the things that was THEIR mistake 13) they printed our bill WITHOUT offering CHEESECAKE 14) went for a birthday that we never actually celebrated because we were too busy complaining and they never sang... 15) THEY CALLED SECURITY AND THE POLICE ...............because all we fucking wanted was cheesecake ............

Sanita M.,"Tampa, FL",125,383,2135,5.0,2/16/2016,"I have been coming here pretty often, and the food and the service has been amazing! Pretty fast, the waiters are always really friendly, and the food arrives fresh and delicious. I usually order tamales (so good, little sweet), or Santa Fe Salad (my favorite salad!), or sweet potato fries (yummy), and a cheesecake. Just once we ordered some sandwich and it was not good at all - too much white bread (they don't have whole wheat bread), too much dressing or mayo, only few veggies inside and I did not like the chicken taste (marinade) either. But I guess I'm not a sandwich person, this was my first time ordering a sandwich in the restaurant. The cheesecakes here are so good! Most of them are way too sweet but still super delicious. My favorites are Toasted Graham Marshmallow (without marshmallows - too sweet), Reese's Peanut Butter, Pumpkin Cheesecake, White Chocolate Macadamia and Red Velvet Cake. RVC is one of my favorites because it is not too sweet. I have tried lemon or key lime cheesecakes and they taste so sweet. Can't eat a cake like that."
Neal R.,"Queens, NY",6,18,4,3.0,1/12/2017,"The portions here are enormous. I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon with was enough for two serving. I flavors are good in the disk however like many of the entrees they are loaded with salt, I left there with dry mouth for the rest of the evening. The draft beer I choose was the local Flying Bision Rusty Chain, which was excellent. I also ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake to go, I was not a fan of that either. maybe next time I will go with the classic.  Not a terrible dinning experience, would probably go back and try a salad or something with less salt."
Keith F.,"Scarborough, Canada",4,49,,5.0,7/20/2016,"It was my first visit to The Cheese Cake Factory. Many people have told me how wonderful the restaurant is. I excepted nice, but blown away with how fantastic the location was. The restaurant was extremely large. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. At the time of my visit The Cheese Cake Factory was busy. There were plenty of staff to assist the customers. My server was remarkable. Friendly and efficient she made meal as experience.  I had the Factory Meatloaf. It was incredible. The serving was more than I could eat (and I can eat).  The meal was so large we took our cheese cakes home. Without going on too much, they were sensational.  I'll definitely come back to this location, even if it's just to pick up some more cheese cake."
Kevin S.,"Buffalo, NY",5,3,,5.0,1/31/2017,Outstanding service great staff waitress knew everything we asked.  Dealt with our sons peanut allergy incredibly.
Amy L.,"Buffalo, NY",88,263,87,4.0,4/9/2015,"my order: buffalo blast (ALWAYS) & the hot spinach & cheese dip (not bad) Pros - very beautiful ambiance, very professional wait staff - attached to the mall so its a quick stop (or nice relaxed dining experience) after shopping - during happy hour, they have $5 appetizers. AHH!! there are $3 & $5 drink specials as well. but the appetizers are HUGE, so yes, i'm absolutely in love with this restaurant (only from 4-6pm though, on monday-fri ;D)  - very DELICIOUS CHEESECAKE (well no duh- what is the restaurant entitled?); if you buy three or more slices, you might as well get an entire cake for the price you're paying  Cons - b/c of the flow of shoppers, there is usually a loooooong line up (be smart: just eat at the bar)  - compared to traditional buffalo fare, the cheesecake factory is a little pricier (with good reason though, of course)"
K T.,"Buffalo, NY",0,11,1,3.0,8/1/2016,The CHEESECAKE IS SUPER DUPER !!! The food Meh. Good service clean bathroom nice atmosphere. I go for CheeseCake & Draft beer every so often.
Bryan D.,"Colden, NY",0,10,3,4.0,1/18/2017,"If you go at the right time of day, it's relatively easy to get a table. Staff is always friendly. The food is good, but a bit overpriced... thus the 4 stars instead of 5.  The actual cheesecake is incredible obviously.  If anything, just get some of that to go."
Keira Sun P.,"Buffalo, NY",13,8,,4.0,6/29/2016,"Love their menu. It has a large variety which makes it a good go to restaurant to meet everybody's cravings.  The food comes in very large, generous portions and the bread and butter is always a hit.  the dessert menu is amazing also. What could possibly go wrong with cheese cake?"
Patricia L.,"Buffalo, NY",0,2,1,1.0,5/6/2017,"The one star is because the food was decent. Not great. But good enough. Being a restaurant professional myself, I know that dining experience is mostly based on service, at least for me. And service was where it fell apart for my visit. Party of 2, my husband and I , were sat at a dirty table. It had been cleared but not wiped. So when the server, Alicia, greeted us we asked her to wipe the table. She returned with a handful of dry bev naps which hardly did the trick on the sticky table. But we let it ride. We ordered wine and water. We asked for straws for our water but she never brought them. So we asked the food runner when he brought our appetizer.  He got straws and also pre-bussed our bread plates. Cool. Another food runner dropped of our entrees. I stacked all our dirty app dishes at the tables edge to make it easier for someone to grab them. Nobody ever did. They sat in our face the whole meal. After our food was delivered, Alicia never checked back to see how things were. I had Baja chicken tacos which were a little bland so I wanted to ask for hot sauce or Tabasco but I never had the chance because she never came to check. She came back only when my husband's plate was empty to see if we wanted dessert. She took our entree plates, boxed up my tacos, but still left the other stack of plates that had been there since appetizers.  We would consider coming back for dessert only, but never again for a full service meal. Alicia's service was definitely not full in any sense of the word."
Andrew B.,"Buffalo, NY",81,13,,2.0,11/16/2016,Marginally edible. Had a turkey burger. Had onion peels in it. Wife's pizza came out late and when it did it was very soggy. A microwave pizza out of a box would have been better. Service was acceptable. Not likely to return.
J B.,"Kauai County, HI",12,523,13,3.0,9/9/2016,Ehhh... I have been dozens Cheesecake Factory in the past and this one didn't match the ones in the past based on my meal was subpar. The Marsala was rubbery and the sauce was over sweet - maybe they switched up the recipe? Oh well - service was still good.
Hazel L.,"Streetsboro, OH",0,4,34,5.0,6/20/2016,"wonderful place for friends talking and eating together! The food are so great that when it's time for dessert, we were all full so we have share one cheesecake! A little expensive but worthy it!"
Melissa B.,"Akron, NY",56,251,541,2.0,1/7/2015,My husband and I stopped in for dinner tonight to use a gift card we got for Christmas. We have eaten here a few times and always had good experiences. Tonight however it was a different story although the service was pretty good I ordered the roasted lemon chicken and I substituted sweet potato french fries instead of the mashed potatoes and the snap peas. When my food came I was a little shocked as there wasn't even enough chicken on the plate for a child and the sweet potato fries were WAY over cooked! I was very disappointed as they are charging $18.95 for this and needless to say I was still hungry when we left. My husband ordered the salmon which came with wasabi mashed potatoes and asparagus.   He advised that the salmon was tasty but the mashed potatoes were cold. For dessert we ordered the special peppermint bark cheesecake to share. There is nothing special about it.  The crust was a brownie crust and the cheesecake just tasted average. If you're definitely going to order cheese cake I would highly recommend going with the vanilla bean its my favorite and has very good flavor.
Bri B.,"Lancaster, NY",0,7,,5.0,6/5/2017,"I don't really like to frequent chain restaurants but I was out with a friend and we wanted to grab a quick bite. We went around 5 pm today and it wasn't that busy. Steven was our server and he was great. I thought he might hate us because we both had received important messages and phone calls to tend to but he just kept checking on us and saying ""don't worry. Take your time."" We apologized and started ordering. I asked him if the grilled artichoke was completely vegan and he said we can make arrangements but honestly I wouldn't get that. He said he loves majority of the menu but he said he wouldn't recommend. So I told him that all I'm looking for is a vegan dish. He listed off a few meals and also showed us the sections in the menu with vegan options. He said he recommends the eggplant parmigiana, without the parmigiana to make it vegan. I went with his recommendation and I was not disappointed. I'm so glad that he was super accommodating and understanding. And throughout the meal he remembered that I was vegan. Impressive because sometimes servers don't even remember the drink you ordered. So refreshing to meet someone who takes pride in their job! Very pleasant experience and I would most definitely return, as long as Steven is working! Great job!"
Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1285,982,738,2.0,11/4/2015,"The only benefit about dining at a chain is that you know what you're going to get; the recipes are the same, menus are the same, the philosophy is the same, etc, etc. With that being said, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the only if not the only chain my family and I frequent mostly because of the amount of options they have and because of their ""healthy"" skinnylicious menu. Ultimately, there's something here for everybody and that's very important for the picky eaters (cough cough, me) in my family. An experience goes sour however, when a well known chain like the Cheesecake Factory doesn't have consistency with their quality and portions which is unfortunately what occurred at this particular location during my time dining here. Came in around 9:45 on a Tuesday night after seeing a movie at the Galleria. The kitchen closed at 11, but we noticed the place was pretty empty so we checked in with the hostess first to make sure they weren't trying to close. She assured us we had over an hour before the kitchen was closing and was very pleasant. I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory in my home town on Long Island about 30 times in my life, no exaggeration. It's the same experience every time, you get waters, you get bread. Here at the Galleria, we were brought waters, but nothing about bread was mentioned. This irked me because the person I went out to dinner with heard me rant and rave about the warm brown bread Cheesecake Factory served and it wasn't given to us......yet. We placed drink orders, asked our waitress a little bit about the wine but she didn't have any feedback. With that being said, she did offer to go to the bartender to have any of our questions answered. Shortly after ordering, two glasses of wine came to the table, cabernet for me, Malbec for the other. My cabernet tasted like straight vinegar, the bottle had gone bad, who knows how long is was opened for. Lucky for me, our server was nearby often, I was able to grab her attention to inform her that the bottle went bad, to which she apologized and happily brought me a glass of Malbec. The switch took a little bit longer than it should have but nevertheless, it was done hassle free and the second glass tasted great. We placed our order, started with the Asian lettuce wraps off the skinnylicious menu. Then, I ordered the Mexican Tortilla salad off the skinnylicious menu and asked for all of the dressing to be on the side. My dinner guest got the farfalle pasta and asked if they could toss a bit of spinach in there. Our waitress informed us there would be an upcharge, which I sort of understood until the dinner came out and I saw the amount of spinach in there. It wasn't until we placed our order that the waitress mentioned the idea of bread. We immediately said yes please and waited.......and waited.....and waited some more. Still, no bread. The asian lettuce wraps were the best part of the meal. Exactly how I remembered them from previous experiences. Entrees came out while we had just started enjoying our appetizer, they were trying to get us in and out. It was only 10:15, we still had 45 minutes, we weren't the people who were going to sit in the restaurant all night long, it would have been nice to be able to enjoy our appetizer for another minute before entrees were dropped. We also got another surprise with our entrees......the bread. Why it took a half hour to come out, I will never know. I don't believe this was our server's fault, she was great throughout the entire experience. I think bread should be brought out without question, like it ALWAYS is at the Cheesecake Factory, but she kept mentioning how the bread was in the oven and it would be out shortly. There really was no excuse for the extended wait, most people like bread before their meal, not mid-meal.  I was extremely disappointed with my Mexican Tortilla Salad. It was half (no exaggeration) half the size that I am used to at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The salad is $16 and the amount of chicken and substance wasn't worth a penny over $7. The dressing did not taste good, there were 2 small pieces of grilled chicken, it was wildly underwhelming. I always pack up this salad to go at the end of my meal but this time, there was nothing to take to go. The check came to $61. This place is not cheap and for the quality, the price is not justified. Let me reiterate that our server was very friendly and attentive, but the expectation of what I thought we would be getting from Cheesecake Factory was less than satisfactory at the Galleria location."
Mark B.,"Akron, NY",38,181,184,4.0,1/4/2016,"The wait here is always a concern for me. Today the bar and high top tables were open, we went with the bar. I had the Ahi Tuna salad. It was just what I needed. Great flavor, and really good Tuna for Buffalo in January. I really enjoyed the dressing, will be ordering again. The bartender was busy but stilll gave us great service."
Penny T.,"Rochester, NY",0,16,16,5.0,8/2/2016,"Half priced cheesecake day. Fabulous app - stuffed tater tots- don't knock 'um until you try them.  They are delicious! I had Chicken Bellagio -also awesome and then of course.  Cheesecake.  Yummmm.  For a busy day everyone was efficient, super pleasant and organized.  Great visit."
Michaela M.,"Buffalo, NY",58,84,252,2.0,11/8/2014,"The food here is absolutely fantasic. I'm not sure why other rewiewers are complaining about the huge portions, I love taking food home for lunch the next day!!!! I always get the fettuccine with chicken and a sun dried tomato sauce. I've never had a better pasta dish! The parmesean garlic bread with dipping oil is awesome. Chicken bellagio is another excellent dish. Salads are incredible. I seriously love everything I've ever had here. Except the cheesecake - Which we were VERY disappointed about. Our Vanilla Bean cheesecake was dry, we didn't even finish it. Possibly an older piece? My partner got the Apple Cheesecake, it was also dry and mostly apple strussel, hardly any cheesecake part. We were unhappy with both.  My most recent visit we spent around $150 for 4 people.... and the food was great but terrible service. Our waitress acted like we were a complete bother to her. Maybe she was having a bad day or something, but it made our experience bad. She never asked if food was ok, never asked if we wanted more drinks, she took our order as if she was stopping quick in passing our table. Her eyes were bloodshot and she wasn't friendly at all. We got 2 appetizers and it took 30-40 minutes to get them. We would've ordered more beers during this time, but she never stopped to ask. I found myself actually jealous of the other tables with friendly attentive servers.  This experience has happened a few times before to us here. Bad luck ? Hopefully it will be better next time, because this place isn't cheap and would be nice to have good service. The food is 5 stars service is 2 at best."
