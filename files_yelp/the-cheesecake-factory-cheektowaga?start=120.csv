Char Y.,"Buffalo, NY",0,25,6,3.0,10/23/2016,"The food is good, a bit overpriced. I love the teriyaki chicken or steak Diane. The lemonade is wonderful and so is the bread. They cheesecake is just ok, but they offer a variety."
Mark M.,"Niagara Falls, NY",136,1018,6165,2.0,10/6/2014,"We came 10 minutes before the waiters were finishing their shift.  Our waiter was a phony.  We could tell he was just acting to be friendly.  We watched as all the waiters gathered by the register to chat about their lives and how they could not wait to go home.  What a joke.   I ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combo and it was super small.  For $20 I expected more.  The mashed potatoes were even cold when I go them, hardly any steak.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake/cheesecake and it was ""okay"".   Of all the cheesecake factories I have been at, this has to be the worst.  It's too open and noisy and the staff just seemed like a bunch of stuck up college kids working there before they get a much higher paying job in the working world.  Their heart is really not into it, and it shows."
Stella M.,"Buffalo, NY",0,24,,2.0,10/29/2016,"First off, the menu is FAR too big. The description of the menu items don't even come close to what it actually looks and tastes like (I think I used the word ""gross"" during one visit...). Ive given this restaurant 3 solid attempts and been sorely disappointed each time. Won't be returning for a 4th visit."
Michael M.,"North Bend, WA",1,42,7,5.0,1/24/2016,"It's in the Walden Galleria, a huge Mall located next to the freeway exit (easy off, easy on).  They were extremely busy. I got lucky to sit at the bar, guess they are popular, and I'm not surprised. The staff is very courteous and attentive. Took less than 10 minutes to get my food (I waited longer in some McDonalds for file of fish). Most importantly, my grilled salmon and sautéed spinach were both DELICIOUS ! Very fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection!  Drool :)  Definitely coming back."
Bob B.,"Niagara Falls, NY",1,24,,2.0,2/25/2017,Got the 4 cheese pasta had absolutely no taste was awful . Marinara sauce should be a thin sauce but this was chunky . The pasta was way under cook . Waitress saw that I didn't like it but didn't say a thing . Just brought us the check my fault should of said something .  Had like three different noodles .. one spaghetti noodle and one bow tie . Made me wonder. Not for me .
Sarah S.,"Clarence Center, NY",58,414,385,5.0,10/30/2015,"F it... I love chains. Hate all you want, I love the consistent nature of them, how it doesn't matter if you go to a Cheesecake Factory in NY or California, they all have the same food. When we drove across America to move to NY we called McDonald's our ""benchmark of standard"". If a stop had a McDonald's, we knew it was a ""real"" town. I digress, this is about the Cheesecake Factory and this is my love letter to them. Dearest Cheesecake Factory, It had been far too long since our last encounter. I missed the soft caress of your velvety texture in your cheesecakes. As I bite down in to pumpkin cheesecake bliss, it's like biting right down in to heaven itself.  You humor my efforts to eat healthy with a ""skinnylicious"" menu so I have less guilt about eating your tasty desserts.  Tonight I started with a glass of riesling (Oh, you know me, you dirty slut. Serving up the Chateau Ste. Michelle just like you know I like) before being brought my first of many bread baskets. I am not a fan of the sour dough bread but I do love that brown one your serve (I'm a little kinky like that). I then moved on to my ""skinnylicious"" salmon and vegetables. After 8 years of living in the PNW I had become a salmon snob and I frown Atlantic salmon but you cooked this so right I didn't even mind it's farmed body.  It had just the right amount of a crispiness.  And you cooked it all the way through! I LOVE that, I hate when my fish comes to me still semi raw.  The vegetables were also yummy... yes, YUMMY. I declare those vegetables were cooked to perfection! I think you might be lying to me calling them ""skinnylicious"" because they tasted like they were drenched in butter but that's okay, I like the way you lie. It gave me permission to get what I really came for, the cheesecake. Holy hell Cheesecake Factory, you make a damn fine cheesecake. I love them all but given it's fall I had to get pumpkin.  Service was decent but it wouldn't even matter if it sucked, I love your food so much. My husband got a carbonara thing he always gets and since he was licking the plate when he was finished I think it's safe to say you also have him under your spell.   I love you Cheesecake Factory! I love you now and I love you forever, I am your fat bitch for life!  Yours 'til my eventual heart attack does me in, xo Sarah"
Kevin D.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",155,417,375,4.0,2/1/2016,"Traveling from scotland I was told ..... You must try Cheesecake Factory ..... Wasn't disappointed .... Great visual interior, large portions and an epic cheesecake that defeated me in a wonderful delisiouly evil way, Go eat and become fat in the tastiest way possible"
Min C.,"Toronto, Canada",268,256,1256,5.0,11/18/2013,"I AM OBSESSED with this place.  I LOVE cheesefactory the most and I probably have an unhealthy relationship with it lol.  okay everyone knows the cheesecake here is HEAVEN! legit the softest and BEST cheesecake you will ever have in your life.  its like a soft cloud in your mouth. there is zero competition. I like the original the best but to each their own. the food here is amazing too and insanely large portions.  I'm canadian but everytime I go to the states my top priority is to find out if there's a factory near where I'm going.  they bring you free bread to start.  the best free bread ever haha.  there's a sourdough one and another brown one that is sweet!  .god. be careful not to fill yourself up before your meal even starts.  my two favs here are the pasta da vinci -Sautéed Chicken, Mushrooms and Onions in a Madeira Wine Sauce Tossed with Penne Pasta and Parmesan.  so AMAZINGLY good  and I think about it all the time. the sauce is to DIE for and mixed with the mushrooms and onions and chicken (never dry), it's just perfection.  My other fav is the steak diane - Angus Beef Steak Covered with Black Peppercorns and Mushroom Wine Sauce. Served with Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Onions. i get this medium rare and once in vegas they overcooked it, but i returned it and they fixed it up right away and then gave me free dessert (WIN).  This steak is actually REALLY good and the sauce that it comes with OMFG.  my mouth is watering even thinking about it.  I find it hard to try new things because i always want to order one of these dishes! they also have a lot of chicken here.  My favs are chicken bellagio, chicken madeira, chicken piccata.  you really can't go wrong at the cheesecake factory. be prepared to choose from the biggest menu of ur life.  hands down my favorite casual restaurant. really it should be called the dream factory"
Joe B.,"Lockport, NY",1,13,1,2.0,7/12/2016,Terrible. Food is okay but the service is absolutely horrendous. Amazing a place like this can stay in business in Buffalo. Must be all the Canadian Visitors.
Rushin S.,"Buffalo, NY",80,5,,4.0,11/21/2015,"We had Hershey's Chocolate Bar, Mango Key Lime, White Chocolate caramel macadamia nut Cheesecakes. All tasted finger-licking good.  Four cheese pasta for vegetarian would be best option to try out. Factory nachos were scrumptious. Pizza also tasted good.  Not to forget fantastic and courteous service from staff !!  Definitely going again !!"
Melissa B.,"Toronto, Canada",0,20,2,3.0,2/22/2016,"We went here for the first time and it was a Sunday evening, it was still super packed and I'm not sure why, the food was just ok  I had the garlic noodles with shrimp, he sauce lacked flavour and the shrimp were incredibly rubbery. My husband had steak Diane which he loved. And we shared the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake which was the highlight of the meal. I'd probably go again but I certainly don't see why it's so busy."
Linda L.,"Brampton, Canada",12,8,1,1.0,9/27/2015,"Walden Galleria used to be the most inviting place to shop and eat to all Canadian's.  Now Buffalo doesn't even care to honour our coupons, I mean it takes us 2 and 1/2 hours to drive there, we obviously planed to have a great shopping and lunch, dinner experience. Well my friend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch, we were greeted with a very sweet hostess, sat in the bar area, and forgotten about. When our waitress did come over we were both dying for water and asked for it. She told us she needed to greet her next table and she would be back. When she came back no water, she asked for a drink order.  I asked for my water, well she thought she would save a trip to the bar and bring our drink order and our water together????  We haven't decided on a drink could you please just get our water first.  And that's how it started.... She ignored us in a way that she would come buy and do all her checks, but just to say she did, but not wait around for our answers, like more dressing please, more ice, whatever we said she was already at another table. When the manager came by Jeramy, tall guy.   I asked him if we could use a coupon that had expired for a piece of cheesecake, and explained to him that we drove all the way from Toronto.  He said No, he doesn't have a code for that in the system.  My friend and I thought I'm sure their is a way to comp the cheesecake.  Needless to say, never again they lost two good shoppers and customers.  They just didn't give a shit."
Anthony S.,"Buffalo, NY",284,4,4,3.0,2/7/2016,"So this is my first review and also a review on a chain restaurant, but it was a solid place. When you walk in its very good sized and there is a host station where you wait to get seated. The young man was quick and friendly. Our server, Stephanie, was pleasant, not horrible enthusiastic or helpful, but pleasant. We started with drinks and a meatball, ricotta, garlic bread app as well as they bring fresh white and wheat bread.  The meatball, ricotta app was fantastic and bodes well for the new menu put in place. Next we ordered I got a BBQ smoke house burger with sweet potato fries, not very empresses with any part of it. My girlfriend ordered Avocado egg rolls which were amazing and well presented and Buffalo Blaster which are like breaded chicken wing dip.. Not so great either.  All in all Atmosphere: A Drinks: A Service: B Food: C  Hope this helps."
Mike H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2144,332,506,4.0,1/4/2015,"It seems to be a staple to come here along with your cross boarder shopping trips to buffalo.  Just recently I was introduced to this place by my gf and wow, was I amazed!  The place looks like a cruise ship inside and there seems to always be a line up.  Luckily the few times I have gone we have avoided the huge line up situation completely.  The service is great and everytime I seem to have a request or need a refill they are always there.  Also the servers come by to fill their delicious bread fairly often.  They don't ever rush you as well which is a nice change from other super busy restaurants. The food is great and the portions are astronomical.  I could not believe the size of my mac and cheese burger and sheppards pie I ordered.  Also their cheesecake slices are huge as well and one slice is more than enough for two people to share.   I will always come back here whenever I am in the Buffalo area as long as they offer delicious mammoth sized meals with top notch service!"
Beynan R.,"Buffalo, NY",8,38,44,4.0,1/28/2016,"One word, delicious! Order the avocado egg roll appetizer and one of their whiskey cocktails to start your meal just to set the tone. The menu is extensive, built to suit your taste. They overdid my medium rare steak so they get four stars instead of five. And of course, the banana cream cheesecake was superb."
Akeem B.,"Buffalo, NY",82,8,,4.0,5/25/2016,Cashew Chicken and rice...mmm.  The chicken savory.  the sauce sweet with a slight salty taste. While being a good place to grab a bite.  It is pricy.  I love the setting.  Sometimes the wait is crazy.  But everything is worth it in the end.
Carrie A.,"Brant, NY",0,7,,4.0,2/9/2017,"We went here for my daughter's birthday.  They wouldn't take a reservation after 6pm but we had a large party and they tried to accommodate us.  They told us the table they wanted to seat us had a large party already sitting there and we would have to wait.  I guess those ladies wanted to have a social night and were camping out over 2 + hours after they finished their meal.  The manager finally sat us over an hour later than expected.  They were very good to us and gave us each an appetizer on the house.  This seemed very reasonable.  The wait staff was very attentive.  Overall, it ended up our night went well once we were sat.  I'm still not crazy about the extensive menu, but the portions are plentiful and the food is good."
Kendra K.,"New York, NY",37,58,523,4.0,2/28/2016,"I feel like you can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. They have so many items on their menu to choose from and everything is fairly good. I came here recently for lunch during the week with my friend. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is our waitress was not that great. I decided to treat myself on my day off so I ordered the Passion Fruit Margarita. It was really good! My friend and I decided to order a bunch of appetizers to share. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs. We could barely fit everything on our table lol. We each ordered a salad to start. My friend got the fresh kale salad which was very good and I ordered a house salad with balsamic dressing. Unfortunately when I got my salad it looked like there were 2 different dressings on it. The balsamic was there but when I tasted it, there was also a ginger dressing and I couldn't finish it. I let the waitress know and she was kind enough to take it off the bill. For the appetizers we ordered the portobello, avocado and zucchini fries, roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, fried macaroni and cheese (our favorite), and Thai lettuce wraps. My favorites were the fried macaroni and cheese but I'd had this before and the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread was delicious. It was my first time eating Thai lettuce wraps. It was ok. A little messy and again I wasn't crazy for the ginger dressing. Our waitress was a little spacey and seemed overwhelmed with his busy the restaurant was at that time. I would definitely come back here soon."
Harrold R.,"Buffalo, NY",88,31,49,4.0,8/11/2015,"Oh Cheesecake...  the only franchise in America which for some reason I keep going too...  I am more of a support your local business kind of guy but the cheesecake, oh the cheesecake.   Menu?  Kind of long but options are never a bad thing unless you're an indecisive individual like me.  That said, portion sizes have gotten smaller and noticed a few favorites have left the menu but it's all about the cheesecake folks =)"
David C.,"Buffalo, NY",143,126,3139,3.0,1/27/2013,"Like most large scale American chains the Cheesecake Factory is designed to please all palettes. With it's huge portions you should come prepared to take home left overs however they have now added a ""Skinnylicious"" menu with items that a low calorie compared to their normal dishes. With the opportunity of having visited various Cheesecake Factories I have had the ability to sample many dishes. Favorites of my friends or myself start with the appetizer of the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I find them light enough to start out a meal as they do not leave you feeling full such as the bread that is put out on the table. Another favorite from the starters are the Buffalo Blasts. The filling is good for anyone that wants the Buffalo wing taste but doesn't want to go through the hassle of the actual wing however at times they can come out greasy as I believe they are deep fried. Some of my favorite main dishes are the BBQ Chicken Pizza, the Navajo; a chicken sandwich served on warm fry-bread and the Cuban Sandwich. For anyone that is looking for a hearty sandwich with both pork and ham it comes in a closed second from other versions I've had at actual Cuban restaurants. If you are looking for a cheesecake that is still rich but not excessively sweet I recommend the Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake. The Buffalo location has not lived up to the reputation or experience that I have discovered at other locations across the country. The staff often looks frumpy or disheveled and service at times is lackluster as they are not tentative to the needs of the patron."
