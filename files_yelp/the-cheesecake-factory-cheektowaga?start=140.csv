Paul H.,"North York, Canada",22,90,40,2.0,7/16/2015,"I used to enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory, but it has really gone downhill over the past year.  For starters, it was quiet, that in itself is rare.  My party of 5 was able to get a spot on the patio at 6:30 PM.  The waitress was nice, but after she took our order, we did not see her for 15 minutes.  Drinks were done and it was hot outside.  Finally got another round, but took another 35 minutes for our dinners to arrive.  When they did (i got the grilled fish tacos) they were not warm at all and the shells were soaked through.  Again, the waitress vanished for a while so we could not even get any hot sauce.  All in all in was not a great experience from a restaurant that used to be pretty good."
Adam M.,"Buffalo, NY",98,263,73,4.0,11/15/2015,Love this place to eat and love the cheesecake options! The brunch is amazing and the shrimp sandwich is def something to eat!
Jimmie H.,"Niagara Falls, NY",82,135,79,4.0,4/21/2015,I have always enjoyed going to the Cheesecake Factory. Especially when I lived in California and downstate New York. Though I don't go as much as I used to it is still one of my favorites. The atmosphere appears to be the same no matter which site you dine at. The food is still great and staff was excellent. We ordered from the lunch menu two pasta dishes. They were supposed to smaller than the norm. But they were of an excellent size. We were so full that day that we didn't even get any cheesecake.
Christine R.,"Scarborough, Canada",170,230,1644,4.0,10/28/2012,"After working up a hearty appetite from an afternoon of shopping in Walden and being a Cheesecake Factory virgin I was long awaiting to check this place out. As a Canadian we don't have this have this chain on our side of the boarder so I knew this would be my lunch time stop. A Sunday afternoon just around 4pm it was a 20 minute wait, by the time our table was ready the wait time had upped to 40-50 minutes. I literally spent the whole 20 minutes drooling in front of the beautiful array of cheesecakes in the display case. The menu is huge its more, there is literally something for everyone with all types of dishes and cuisines. To start we went our waiter's recommendation Fried Mac and Cheese - Crispy Crumb Coated Macaroni and Cheese Balls. Served over a Creamy Marinara Sauce Super crispy batter revealing a creamy interior of white cheddar mac & cheese. Gooey piping hot with a creamy marinara sauce, a sinfully delicious start. For mains the Fiancee went with the Pizza & Salad Lunch Special He got the pepperoni pizza and a Caesar salad. It was supposedly a lunch sized portion however both looked normal if not large in size to us. I went with the White Chicken Chili - A Generous Bowl of Chicken, White Beans, Roasted Green Chiles, Onions and Garlic with a Touch of Cream. Garnished with Steamed Rice and Fresh Salsa I liked that they gave the option of white or brown rice. Being a fan of chili this was the first time I had ever had a white chili and it did not disappoint. The chili was really flavorful and filling with a good amount of heat. Delicious rich and creamier than traditional chili. And then finally we get to Dessert! After my 20 minutes spent staring at the display case and being a PB lover I knew exactly which one I wanted. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake - Chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in our Original Cheesecake with Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel OMG Let me tell you words can't describe how delicious this was! They really do know how to do a cheesecake justice, this cake alone would make me drive from Toronto to Buffalo. Creamy chocolatey peanut buttery oooo man I don't even like cheesecake but I LOVED this cake. And the portion is Hugeeee I wish I had another stomach so I could of finished it. Overall Service was a little hit or miss, Our waiter forgot to bring us bread and we had to keep calling him over to refill our drinks but he was friendly and funny none the less and the place was overwhelmingly busy. However hands down I would definitely return for that Cheesecake alone!"
Greg M.,"Main Street, Buffalo, NY",80,49,259,4.0,4/8/2014,"I  personally have never had a poor experience at any cheesecake factory, but i cant consider this to be 5 stars simply due to the quality of ingredients,the ""factory"" like size, and the par service. However. I will give this cheesecake factory 4 stars though for consistently meeting my expectations even when it is slammed (The Galleria Mall can get quite busy) If you have never been to The Cheesecake Factory, it is quite an interesting place. The lavish (Egyptian like?) columns and large size make it quite the sight, but the aura fades once you go a few times. The Menu is probably one of the most extensive I have ever seen. If you cant find something you like here, you should re-evaluate your eating habits. I highly recommend the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everytime I get this, people sitting around me ask me what it is (probably due to is size and presentation). It is HUGE! The secret is the plum dressing it is served with, i've never had anything quite like it. It can be kind of sweet though so if you are not into that, don't get it. I have been to The Cheesecake Factory many times in my life and will continue to go back. When I am at the mall and am looking for a sit down place with options for everybody. Oh yeah, go if you like cheesecake, but I think that is self explanatory no?"
Diya V.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",0,6,1,4.0,6/3/2015,"Its a must visit place for all.. Went in today and it being a weekday didnt have to wait at all. I was promptly seated by this really courteous and friendly  receptionist. He asked me about my day and la di da. As soon as i was made comfortable in my seat i was looked after by this gracious young lady. She din hurry me with the orders or anything. She helped me courteously to make a choice. Dint have to face, face making or impatience or a fake smile that SOME restaurants treat u with owing to u being from a different country.  The ambience is really good!!!  I ordered a jamaican shrimp in black pepper sauce or so and my companion ordered up a veggie burger. While awaiting our orders we were given a mini bread basket to keep busy. :) The food was tasty, fresh and filling although at first i thought it wouldn't be enough but I'm glad i was wrong. My companion is extremely choosy and mindful about the taste of his vegetarian food(as not many available) and i can tell yiu he really appreciated it so it must be really good!!! I also scanned their menu throughly and found the dishes to hold value for customer money as thats really important to me. And uv got lots of options to order from. Uv got pastas, sandwiches,pre plated meals , mini meals , etc. Uv got gluten free cuisine on request ..  A Whole separate menu card dedicated to ""skinnylicious"" food items( jus ask for it if they dun give u one) . Their menu card shows an appreciation for world cuisine!  A lovely place to go out with anyone for any occasion. I definitely recommend it."
Nicole A.,"East Amherst, NY",0,18,42,3.0,12/27/2015,"This cheesecake factory is probably one of the busiest restaurants in the state of New York.  Their server training has to be extensive and it's a shame that this restaurant that is so busy doesn't have their service together.  First of all, she kept leaving our table and saying she will be right back but it took forever.  Second, our server did not know any of her vodkas or beers. I ordered a coors and she repeated back corona.  She must have been new.  She was sweet but had quite a few errors.  Overall, The food is good for chain food.  Extremely busy place. Manager was apologetic."
Tiffany L.,"Buffalo, NY",58,100,62,5.0,3/6/2016,LOVE the cheesecake! Every time I go I have a mental argument with myself on what kind of cheesecake I want that time. My favorite so far is the Kaluah coffee chocolate cheesecake! I also really enjoyed their crab rangoons! I was actually shocked with how delicious they were!
Chris F.,"Buffalo, NY",26,13,6,1.0,1/23/2015,"Ate a meal for the first time here tonight. Ahi carpaccio was awful. Looks like it comes frozen on wax paper and they peel off a paper thin layer of non ahi grade tuna on the plate. Gross. Whatever. Maybe the lemon garlic shrimp would be better. Think again. The $17 meal came out cold and the pasta was one large congealed glob. When I touched it with my hand and or fork, the entire capellini portion moved all at once as a single unit. Sent it back and did not care to try a replacement or anything else. Kids burger came out SUPER RARE. Didn't know they were in the business of poisoning children. I'm far from a nutritionist, but a kids stomach isn't primed for rare meat.  I told the waitress not to worry about anything, she was great, but the manager came over anyways. He says "" I hear that you didn't like your meal."" I said no it was terrible, cold, and it's just not quality. He says ""well I guess it's not for everyone."" He walks away, comps NOTHING. for 2 adults and a kid to eat it cost $83.00 plus the $15 tip I left. This was after the waitress spilled my water on my iphone. 2 apps, 2 entrees, and a kids meal.   I would never eat here again or recommend this place to anyone who is not ""basic."" Olive Garden tastes better than this place and that's not saying much because that place is gross too.  If you're at the mall and a fan of awful food then have at it."
John V.,"Buffalo, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/13/2016,"Bad customer service, food of suspect quality. The server was nice enough and the food tasted alright, come time to pay I provided my credit card. They had trouble swiping it, so I requested that they type it in (something I have to do on a daily basis at MY job for MY customers - not that big of a deal and something I expect any major chain to be able to do). They seemed incapable of doing that, so I offered to use Apple Pay as an alternative, which they did not accept. They would not allow me to go to an ATM to get them their money that way, and forced my girlfriend to pay with her card. After leaving the restaurant, she began to feel sick, and about halfway through the drive back to our hotel she needed me to stop so she could run to a bathroom. Poor customer service, food that will make you sick. I'd give a zero star review if I could."
Angel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1263,226,397,4.0,12/30/2014,"I always love coming here in conjunction with my buffalo shopping trips! I've come here with my family, my friends, my bf, and everyone has had a positive experience. My most recent visit was during lunch on Boxing Day, and we miraculously had no wait. Ordered simple things, like sandwiches, soups, omelette and pulled pork sandwich. The server was very pleasant, and helpful. The food was good, and portions sizable. My parents tried, and loved, that brown bread in the beginning, as I suspected they would. Overall a hefty, delicious meal for 4 people, at $50! We also purchased giftcards at the bakery first, since you get a ""Slice of Joy"" card, which is good for a free slice of cheesecake from 1/1/2015-3/29/2015. One card per every $25. We used the gift cards to pay for the meal we just had, and now we're hoarding the Slice of Joy cards for our next visit. Awesome deal! Will continue coming back here indefinitely for every Buffalo trip to come!"
Rachael K.,"Ridgefield, NJ",0,33,,4.0,12/14/2016,We made a stop at this place after visiting Canada. I love their shrimp scampi pasta and my friend got their louisiana chicken pasta! Both were great! We devoured their red velvet cheesecake.
Jennifer H.,"Indian Trail, NC",116,19,9,5.0,5/2/2015,Great menu especially the skinny menu! Turkey burger wrapped in lettuce leaf with a side salad for 450 calories!
Lynn B.,"North Tonawanda, NY",6,84,74,3.0,1/3/2016,I heard friends talk about this place. So we went here before going to see a movie. My friend have three cheese pasta dish. To me for price of small portion. He also have a strawberries creme drink. He said its was good.  I have some kind of China's  salad.  Was good. There to much on there menu to choose. They can cut its in half. The prices to pricey. That what most people I talk to expensive. Go there once and check its out but dont go back. I have better cheese cake. Well my first time there and I dont think I will come back. Unless I have a gift cards from here or good coupon where you get your second meal half off.
Jessica L.,"Buffalo, NY",54,4,1,5.0,8/1/2015,"On a crowded Saturday evening we only waited for our table of three for about 25 min. I was already impressed. Then the hostess led us outside, to which I was not impressed. Unfortunately it was a windy and very cloudy evening, sun behind the clouds and rain threatening. As I was contemplating leaving, I watched two managers discussing the impending storm. Dana, the manager, approached our table even before we had a chance to order and asked if we would like to move inside. We immediately agreed and moved to a nice booth inside.  The meal just got better from there, I ordered the chicken Madeira, which was delicious and cooked to perfection.  The waitresses and Manager were all very kind to my daughter and indulged her conversation, even if it was only about how old and tall she is. Unfortunately we had a movie to catch or we would have tried one of their 40 cheesecakes for dessert. We will be back for that, next time.  Overall I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory for an out of the ordinary night out to dinner with the family."
Natasha S.,"Toronto, Canada",37,29,21,5.0,4/28/2014,"Any chance my family and I cross the border, this is always the first place we go! I really wish Toronto had a Cheesecake Factory of their own - then again, i would be there everyday so thankfully they don't! Every time I come here, I always want to try something new but I end up only getting their avacado spring rolls and than pass out in itis heaven (if you don't know what ""itis"" is, it is when you eat past when you feel full and you feel like you're in a food coma and you just want to go to sleep with a smile on your face!)  The service is awesome, the waitresses and waiters are extremely knowledgeable about their menu and are always close by if you need anything. My family always try's something new and they have never been disappointed. Although, I should be eating from their Skinny Menu and my parents should be eating their regular menu items, their Skinny Menu is really delicious! Their food is definitely inexpensive for what you get and almost all of their dishes can be shared amongst two people - maybe it's a Canadian thing but their portions are seriously huge!!  As for their cheesecake, I love simplicity so I always get their plain cheesecake with fresh strawberries..let excuse me while I drool and dream about it!! Seriously, coming here could never be a bad choice!!!"
Monica V.,"Ithaca, NY",54,14,,5.0,5/30/2016,After a long day at the Falls we decided to stop at the Cheesecake Factory. I was very impressed on how friendly everyone was. We were seated outside and had the most attentive waitress. She helped us decide what we were going to eat as she gave a really great description of the entrees we asked about. Our ice tea glasses were never empty. I wish I remembered her name but she helped make this a great dining experience.
Rosalia A.,"Depew, NY",7,35,88,4.0,7/30/2015,"I always like stopping at Cheesecake factory when I'm shopping at the mall. The food is good, I stopped today for a slice of  Reese peanut butter chocolate cheesecake, since its half price today for National cheesecake day, The slice was generous  and it tasted delicious!!"
Naitik G.,"Rochester, NY",138,171,66,4.0,10/15/2015,"I'm not a chain-restaurant kind of a person. People who know me can tell you that. But I gotta give it up for their namesake - the CHEESECAKE. Holy Mother. My favorite - the raspberry cheesecake. Creamy, crunchy and perfectly topped raspberry compote. The food is so-so because honestly it's nothing special than what you'd get at any other American dining chain. We came here for a new hire's lunch. The waiter was nice though and was always on his toes for the table. Seemed like he actually was enjoying waiting the table. He was very accommodating and helpful in letting us choose from the menu.  The falafel salad I ordered was delicious, although a bit heavy on the dressing than I'd like it to be but that didn't ruin the experience at all. It wasn't like the dressing was overpowering the entire dish. Anyways I was surprisingly pleased with my experience here and wouldn't mind coming back for at least a piece of the cake."
Abigail M.,"Oakville, Canada",14,63,5,5.0,8/3/2015,"Yesterday was our first time eating at The Cheesecake Factory, and we were very pleased with it. There was a line, as it was Sunday at lunch time, but we didn't have to wait long, and were placed at a very lovely table. The staff was very helpful with helping us seat the baby we had in our party. My group ordered two appetizers - the crispy fried cheese and the sweet corn fritters. The crispy fried cheese was alright, and I wasn't a huge fan of the corn fritters - too much batter. For our meals, we ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, the BBQ hamburger, the mac and cheese hamburger and the chicken littles. All of them were wonderful. I myself had the pulled pork sandwich, and it was one of best I had ever had. The portions are huge, so we ended up taking much of our meals home, as we wanted to save room for their namesake, cheesecake. One of the couples ordered the pumpkin, and we ordered the pumpkin pecan. The whip cream is not the greatest - it's the fake sort that leaves a film on your tongue - and the cheesecakes was just OK. In the end, my partner and I got two drinks (a pop and an apple cider), an appetizer, two huge meals and a piece of cheesecake for desert, and the total came to $46.00. Not too bad. Oh, and I wouldn't recommend the cold apple cider - it's not apple cider, but more like apple juice with cinnamon in it, and you get a very small glass for $3.50. Overall, I was VERY happy with the experience, our friendly waiter, and the HUGE selection - they seem to practically have anything you could ever want on the menu! I would definitely go here again."
