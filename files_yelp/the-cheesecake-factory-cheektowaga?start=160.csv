Chris L.,"Boston, MA",544,356,153,5.0,5/9/2014,"I love me some Cheesecake Factory and all of its calorie-filled goodness. When I have the opportunity to treat myself, I do; this was no exception. I came here alone for some much needed downtime from work, and the service was impeccable. A smart customer usually allots about 20-30 minutes of wait time, but I was seated almost immediately. My waitress was incredibly pleasant and had patience for my lack of ability to make a food decision. I ended up getting the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo for the first time in my CF relationship. I wasn't disappointed. My meal was delicious and I used every last bit of bread to pick up any lingering sauce and rice. Yes - I'm that guy. If I ever go back to Buffalo, I'll be sure to come here again. Chances are slim that I'll return to the area, but at least I have a new favorite dish, courtesy of this location!"
Sarah M.,"Toronto, Canada",9,16,17,3.0,7/31/2015,"Loved the interior and the portion sizes haha...the food was average however. I wouldn't  recommend ordering appetizers as you really won't  have space for dessert, which is a must!"
Miranda H.,"Buffalo, NY",19,73,57,1.0,11/4/2014,"Nope. When you charge $8 for a piece of plain cheesecake, I expect it to taste better than those $4 whole cheesecakes you can buy at Tops. Learn to make cheesecake. I'm not even going to bother reviewing the rest of my order."
Gregory T.,"Buffalo, NY",0,6,,2.0,11/5/2016,"my wife dragged me to this place because she loves the vegan salad. After waiting about 20 minutes for a table I ordered the fresh spring rolls which were very good and then I went with the fish tacos. That turned out to be a major mistake the tacos themselves were extremely small in fact I've never seen them so small but the biggest problem was that there was hardly any filling in the tacos at all and the fish was about the size of your pinky and that was a large piece. only when the table next to ours receive their fish tacos that I realized how skimpy mine was. so, I brought this to the attention of our waiter who got the manager involved. The manager said that he doesn't understand why we didn't get what we ordered when they portion everything out equally but he said he would take it off the bill. To our surprise we received the bill and it was only a $5 discount off of the total bill I told the waiter and he said he didn't know why the manager did that but it was the manager's decision. So I paid the bill and left a very angry customer I will never ever go back to the Cheesecake Factory."

Ondraea T.,"Buffalo, NY",0,3,,5.0,9/9/2016,LOVE the customer service and high quality cheesecake. The cookie dough flavor is delicious.
Derek L.,"Aurora, Canada",45,383,103,4.0,11/12/2013,"I could eat here every day.  It would take a long time to eat my way through their 965 page menu.  I almost always have the Tuna Tartare, which is always fresh, layered on top of chopped avocado, with wonton crisps and a wasabi soy dressing.  For the main I had a garlic shrimp in angel hair pasta dish that was really nice. They make an iced mint green tea with fresh mint that is wildly refreshing.  It comes unsweetened, so I order a shot glass of hot water so I can melt some sugar to make a syrup that will blend with the cold beverage.  As we all know, adding sugar to a cold drink is a great way to make a drink crunchy. As for desert, feel free to wander over to the glass case filled with namesake cheesecakes.  They have a serious variety, but I'll bet you won't have room for a single slice.  Unless you consider take-out..."
Mark II S.,"Lancaster, NY",15,122,,4.0,12/18/2013,"As chain restaurants go, this is one of the best.  Even anti-chain snobs can be made to admit that they liked something they ate here.  The menu is huge and every dish I have tried is executed flawlessly. My only complaint is the beer/drink prices are way too high.  Sometimes 2 drinks is more than the cost of your dinner."
Haytung M C.,"Toronto, Canada",51,133,107,3.0,11/18/2014,"The US version of Pickle Barrel.  They have a vast menu, something for everybody and huge, giant portions. This location is always busy, always a wait for a table unless you come with a smaller group and are able to grab a table at the bar.  The food itself is good. Honourable mentions are the Chicken & Biscuits, Cobb Salad, and Meatloaf.  Last time I went I had the Burrito, and it was a wet burrito covered in sauce. Wasn't really what I was expecting, it tasted ok and it was huge.  The service here isn't the best either. 3 stars."
Phillip S.,"Markham, Canada",183,629,2446,5.0,11/12/2013,"cheesecake factory is always a pleasure going to. it's unfortunate that they don't have a location north of the border. Chicken Madiera! probably one of their most popular dishes, lightly marinated topped off with cheese, veggies, and a sweet tangy sauce served with mashed potatos!!!! to die for! 5/5 Chicken and Biscuits! ultimate Cheescake factory comfort food! huge house made biscuit served with two well portioned chicken breast covered in their rich gravy sauce, served with their famous mashed potatos....this was a heavy hitter indeed!! and RICH!! i couldn't finish it! 5/5 Dulce Leche cheescake!! pure bliss!! sweet, savory, not enough words can express my love for DULCE LECHE. 5/5"
Jeff S.,"Charlotte, NC",189,1358,2432,3.0,4/29/2012,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory to eat other than cheesecake until last week and at this restaurant. While I think the decor at this place is over the top and a bit childish, the food was actually decent.  I had the chicken tostada salad which is a southwestern style salad and it is HUGEEEEE.  I was wondering If I was going to need 3 stomachs to fit it in.  The salad was delicious but it was missing corn that the menu said it came with. Also, the service, while our waiter was attentive, he wasn't especially efficient.  For example he screwed up on drinks often pepsi instead of tea and regular pepsi instead of diet.   The cheesecake is definitely the best part here but I just had the original cheesecake and it too was flawed a little...it should have been left to set a little more because it was almost like half melted butter when it arrived to the table."
Truth Or Dare T.,"Toronto, Canada",26,436,85,2.0,8/12/2014,"They got the decor nailed but what the hell are all you fans thinking! The portions are huge and so are most Americans, no need to wonder why with a place like this serving up salt and sugar..  They use an incredible amount of salt and sugar in most of the dishes. Making them very addictive. I asked for something plain, I want to experience the cheesecake without a lot of distraction sugary sauces. The waitress suggested the natural strawberry cheesecake.  The strawberries were anything but natural, they were coated with a sugar syrup (maybe that is american natural). The cheesecake was more like a sugar cream or custard, not cheesecake at all. Topped with whipped cream I mean really, did they need to do that.   Loaded with sugar, you can feel it on your teeth, something cheesecakes really shouldn't be.  The sugar makes it addictive and hence popular but definitely not the quality of  cheesecake from Montreal or New York.   Service was excellent.   Really folks, think about the sugar and walk past this place."
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,4.0,3/11/2014,"I'm from out of town (Los Angeles) and have been to this location a dozen times in the last decade. Never once have I had bad service. Never once have they got an order wrong. Never once was our food not perfect. it's one of the few chains in Buffalo where you get what you pay for.  I ate here again tonight and the restaurant showed it's true colors. You can tell a lot about a place by how they treat a customer when they walk in at 10:35 on a Tuesday night, 25 minutes before closing time, and it's been a slow night. Fortunately, they treated me no different than if I walked in at 7. I received top-notch service, wasn't rushed to leave when they closed and my food was hot, tasty and downright perfect.  I tried something new on this visit (I've had most of the menu at one location or another over the years) and went with the Jamaican shrimp. It was excellent. The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce gleamed with flavor. Even the brown rice was good."
Maritza B.,"Buffalo, NY",254,275,402,4.0,4/3/2013,"They have a menu with tons to choose from and I have never been disappointed. They offer sushi, vegetarian items, American fare and lots more. They also serve drinks and desserts.  They have tons of tables so it can feel a bit like you are in a cafeteria because it can get a little noisy with all the customers.  The decor is alright but the giant pillars throw me off. I can't figure out if they are Egyptian or Greek or Disney.  At any rate, the roasted veggie pizza is really good.  Top it with some goat cheese and it's even better. The bloody mary drinks are quite tasty.  The servers are attentive and lgbt friendly.  The burgers are scrumptious as are their pasta dishes.  I will definitely keep coming back. The portions are generous and it's a good value."
Rachel A.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",158,146,598,4.0,12/22/2014,"Any time I'm in the states, you better believe I'm going to a Cheesecake Factory. I came here after watching the football game and it was pretty busy. They said it was a 20 minute wait but it ended up being double the time. The server was really nice and did her best to compensate for the long wait time. i love the brown bread they give. It's always warm and it has a great taste to it. I know they have a book of a menu but i always get the Louisiana chicken pasta. It was a huge portion as always but i needed lunch for the next day. It was good but the chicken was a bit too dry. The sauce was great and really nicely spiced. My friend got the spaghetti and meatballs and he said it was amazing. I'm honestly always too full to get dessert which is a shame. The atmosphere is very Italian. The tables are a bit close together but i guess to accommodate so many people. Will definitely be back."
Dave H.,"Buffalo, NY",81,64,15,5.0,10/16/2015,The menu  is huge alot of choices . This is great  place to go for desert . The  atmosphere  is good it is always  busy  when I gone here so expect  to wait for table  the food is good  I always  get the steak  that is a must try
Steven T.,"Lockport, NY",2,5,1,2.0,9/23/2014,"My wife and I have never been to The Cheesecake Factory, and this evening we were wondering what to eat. She went through our gift cards and found one an awesome sister in law gave us for $40 to The Cheesecake Factory. I love me some cheesecake, who doesn't? And we've both been working a ton (12-18hrs a day for both of us for the last 8 days) and haven't seen each other because I work midnights and she works days. So we decided to treat ourselves and spend a little money even though we are STILL paying off our wedding. (Almost done!) and heck we had a $40 gift card, how much could we spend?  So we took the 45 min journey and much to our great surprise were seated promptly. We couldn't believe it. Every time we go that mall there is always a huge line for that restaurant. We've tried a few times to go but wait times were always an hour plus.  So we excitedly looked over the HUGE menu and our mouths started to salivate over all the delicious options. As soon as I saw they had filet and miller light I was all set with the menu. I took in the beautiful room while I waited for my wife to choose and our waiter to come. When he arrived he went over a few things and said ""Just so you know our credit card machine is down, if you want you can still pay with a card but we prefer cash"". Yeah, I know, I didn't understand it either. But I had some cash and with the gift card it should all be covered. I mentioned that to my wife and the waiter said ""oh, no I'm sorry, we can't take gift cards at all.""  I had the receipt to the gift card taped on it. The receipt showed the purchase price.  I guess I don't know how they would check if we've used it before but I'm sure there is some way. And even if not, can you say that you don't accept credit or gift cards today BEFORE we are seated and sat there for 10minutes? We had people on both sides of us and it was EXTREMELY embarrassing.  Anyways, in closing, the wait is usually VERY long, but we got lucky today, room is beautiful, and the little bit of service we were able to get was average. But a little heads up about not accepting credit cards or gift cards before you seat someone would be appreciated.   And if you're wondering, on our way home we stopped at Chilis. :/. Very anticlimactic for such a long drive in a gas drinking truck."
Iroda A.,"Amherst, NY",21,44,46,4.0,12/17/2015,Cheesecakes are really good but it takes them forever to bring it to you.. Waiting staff could do much better.
Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3669,4868,17339,3.0,7/2/2012,"There's nothing appetizing about a factory, perhaps if it was called the Cheapskate Factory or the Cheapfake Factory, selling bargain imitation goods at knock down prices, it might work out, but as a place for gourmet desserts, it just doesn't work. And it's anything but Cheapskate... it's one of the most overpriced places in the area. If this were the Beefsteak Factory, they would manufacture Tomatoes... really big and unusually expensive ones. But it's not, so they don't. I'm not sure who thought that ""Factory"" was an appetizing word to include in eateries, but it's not. (And yes, Spaghetti Factory, and Spaghetti Warehouse for that matter... I am looking squarely at you). For that matter, Doughnut Plant in NYC should have a re-think. The plant, the factory, the warehouse... not sexy. Not appetizing. Not making me hungry. Holy high prices, Batman. I already don't like chains, but the prices here are beyond insane. $7 for a slice of cheesecake? Exsqueeze me? Are you cereal? Honestly I had no idea. I ate at one of these in Fairfax VA recently, and I thought the food was okay and the milkshake was heavenly (Dulce De Leche Milkshake, no less). But the pricing is just... off the charts insane. I am not a fan. I can't give this chain the maximum possible 3 (or even 4) while they have sky high obnoxious prices like this. Now they don't have the DDL milkshake anymore (replaced it with Oreo, boo), but what they do have is a tropical smoothie with a blend of lots of different juices, and as much as I generally don't like smoothies, I have to say this one was really good, I enjoyed it. However it better be good considering it was a SEVEN DOLLAR DRINK and was really small, not even medium or large. :( I tried their cheesecake, and I find it average to be honest, but even if you like it, $7 a slice? I can get S & S Cheesecake - NYC's best - for $3 a slice, in the Bronx. So it just makes no sense for a national corporate chain that would be making a killing even if they charged $2 a slice, to charge $7. Their food is average too, I've tried 3 or 4 dishes from here (grilled chicken, burger, you name it), it's never particularly amazing but is always amazingly overpriced. The service is really great though. The loveliest girl works here, and she alone is the reason why they get a nice healthy 3/5. She is like, the friendliest and sweetest girl ever. And has a great memory. And I hope her finger feels better. No I didn't do anything to her finger you sick people. 5 star for the drinks 5 star for the service 3 star for the cheesecake 3 star for the food 1 star for the prices I'd give minus 100 stars for the prices if I could"
Jeruen D.,"Berlin, Germany",35,1134,796,2.0,6/15/2012,"I think this restaurant has it wrong. And I don't understand why they still have a fanbase, and is usually packed during dinner time during the weekends.  So I was here with 3 other people, 2 of them not having lunch yet, at around 2 PM. One ordered the Cobb salad, while the other ordered a white tomato pizza. I on the other hand just split a cheesecake.  Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but they just do things I think are wrong, that I am giving them just 2 stars.  First, let me talk about the quantity. Why does the Cobb salad look like it's a salad for 3 people? It's this big mountain of chopped greenery on a plate. And the cheesecake, well, the cake per se tasted good, but it just came with two large mounds of whipped cream. Does the Cheesecake Factory have a goal of fattening every customer?  I'd rather have them serve smaller and cheaper portions. Seriously, why would one want to eat that much Cobb salad? I don't know, but I think that if they reduced portions and removed the unnecessary things (like the whipped cream, for example), then they'd rub me better. I don't mind their cheesecakes, but things are just so gaudy that the substance gets lost in the process."
