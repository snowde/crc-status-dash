Andrew C.,"Buffalo, NY",89,88,233,3.0,5/21/2015,"Well let's start from the beginning. The Cheesecake Factory for me is sorta a last resort not because there food and the service isn't good it's just for some reason the experience doesn't thrill me. I do not get excited when we have to go eat at the cheese cake factory. The cheese cake factory is at the galleria mall so it is convenient if your shopping and want to get a bite to eat but if your not shopping its still actually not a bad place for location to eat. Parking sorta sucks unless you get lucky and someone is pulling out, more likely you will end up parking at the other end of lit which sucks. I love the inside of this place if I had to explain it though Egyptian heaven would be my two words to use which if you think about it and you have been here you will understand what I mean. Only thing is when your eating it's very dark and loud. The service is decent, the only thing I noticed is like 4 different people are servicing you at once which actually was also sorta sucky you don't build any sorta relationship with your waiter or waitress and the waitress (third person who helped service us ) we noticed tried to give our food to the people behind us but eventually they got it right.                                                                              ------Now on to the food I got the shepherds pie and my fiancé got hibachi steak. The shepherds pie was pretty good and actually a pretty decent size and taste wise I give it a 4 my fiancés meal she said it was actually incredible and the steak was cooked perfectly the Veggies were really dry though but over all she said it was a solid 3. So to give the whole experience a four seemed to generous So I'm going to stick with a three because the service and the prices for the food and the fact it's a chain!! I dis like chain restaurants with a passion"
Jill C.,"North York, Canada",124,278,356,2.0,3/11/2014,"The service at the Cheesecake Factory just keeps getting worse and worse! What keeps me coming back is that I do not come here often and sometimes you just want a slice of cheesecake.. The first time I came here, we asked about the beef ribs which they do have on the menu anymore and the waitress responded by saying she does not eat mammals. That was one of the strangest replies I have ever encountered! I have no issues if you do not eat meat, but the way she responded was a little odd, and then when we returned them because they were unedible and the reason they didn't last on the menu she looked like she was going to kill us. If you do not eat meat and have a problem serving it, why work in a restaurant that offers it? Needless to say, she didn't make it as a waitress, at least at the Cheesecake Factory. There is always a wait here, be prepared to wait up to an hour, luckily it is located inside the mall so you can shop a little while waiting for a table. I have no problem waiting, and they do usually seat you at a reasonable wait time.  On our most recent visit we ordered a steak and a pasta, big mistake! The pasta was long made and sitting under the heat lamp waiting for the steak to be cooked. Also they automatically butterfly the steak unless you tell them not too. I do not like my steak butterflied, I think it ruins the steak!  The pasta was all dried up around the outside pieces and cold in the center, the waitress offered to stir it with more sauce, ummm no. How will they make the pasta better ? Obviously we returned it and just ended up sharing the steak, which was our original plan to share the pasta and the steak.  The manager did not bother to come over, we had to ask for him, and he was a DICK! Even our waitress agreed, I think the problem with this place is how the management is run. If you are not a people person, you should not have a job dealing with the public. He just kept saying he wouldn't charge for the pasta over and over, we returned it so why would we pay for something that was unacceptable?    The cheesecake is overpriced anyway, I think it is time to stop giving this place a chance to screw up again!"
Lindsay A.,"Buffalo, NY",374,987,403,4.0,10/15/2012,"I'm one of those people that actually likes Cheesecake Factory.  And on my most recent visit, I was impressed with the new ""skinnylicious"" menu they offer. Since Cheesecake Factory is known for their huge, high calorie menu items, the skinny menu is a nice offering. I ordered the Tuna Tartare and Asian lettuce wraps. Had a glass of the Skinny Sangria too. All were tasty, though the tuna portion was SUPER small. Meh. I'm trying to eat better anyway. I split a piece of the mango key lime cheesecake among a few of us ladies and it was AMAZING. Light and fluffy, very mango-y, with an awesome coconut macaroon crust. Definitely yum.  I've never had a meal here that I didn't like. The menu is HUGE so there is literally something for EVERYONE. For a chain it's perfectly acceptable. I like that Buffalo has finally caught up with the times and has some bigger national chains at the local malls."
Mike B.,"Oakville, Canada",1,8,,4.0,8/4/2015,Its been a while since I have eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. Typically the line ups are so long that my wife and I avoid. This time I was on my own and it was a weekday for lunch. Bonus. No lines. Sat on the patio and quite enjoyed the great service and tasty food. Had the sweet corn tamale cakes ... it's an app but you don't need any more than that for lunch.
Belinda I.,"North York, Canada",84,71,296,1.0,1/29/2014,Everything was fine until they charge me $2.95 for hot water!!!! This is just ridiculous .
Qian C.,"Toronto, Canada",19,63,237,4.0,5/7/2015,Had lunch here recently. The 3 of us ordered 2 lunch portion pastas and a dinner sized pizza. The pastas were huge for lunch (as expected for the Cheesecake Factory). All dishes were tasty. We shared a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake after. SO GOOD!!! OMG...
Mysti R.,"San Diego, CA",75,127,161,3.0,11/7/2014,"This location is clean just like all the other ones I've been too.  However, the food is not as great.  The flavors are not as defined as the other locations.  I think they can work on the flavor profiles for some of their dishes.   Service was great and the bartender was extremely nice."
Rao R.,"Brampton, Canada",12,93,454,3.0,8/4/2013,"Quick breakdown: + Cheesecake amazing + Décor +/- Service and the waitress - Entrees disappointing Full review: We just arrived at the Cheesecake factory. The waitress greets us and says that our table will be ready in twenty minutes. Since my phone will be charged with roaming in another country, this review was written using the notepad app and uploaded on Yelp later. Each new paragraph represents a new update during my experience. We were seated and the waitress quickly took our orders for drinks. After the drinks arrive, the waitress took our orders for apps and main entrees. I ordered the pasta with meat sauce and my friend ordered the pasta da Vinci. The fresh bread came a little bit after we ordered. The bread tasted average and did not impress. There was whole wheat bread and plain white bread. Butter was served as the sauce or spread. The food is taking a long time to arrive. The waitress started to talk to us about a game called Candy Crush after she saw my friend playing the game. She started to help my friend beat a level but fails. (I don't know if this is exactly part of the restaurant experience). Moments after this, our food arrived. The pasta with meat sauce was a disappointment. The noodles were dry and over-salted. My friend said the pasta da Vinci tasted average. The noodles were dry and the sauce was too oily. After eating our mains, we ordered our desserts. I ordered the mango keylime cheesecake and my friend ordered the smores cheesecake.  The mango keylime cheesecake tasted amazing. My friend said the smores cheesecake tasted delicious. Overall, Cheesecake Factory met some of my expectations. The cheese cake was amazing but the main entrees were disappointing for me. The service was okay. For me, the waitress helping my friend beat a level on his phone is poor service. But this is my subjective opinion. My friend thought she was cool (maybe I'm too serious). Also, the décor was amazing. I would recommend this restaurant for everyone looking for great desserts to eat."
Mon Z.,"Toronto, Canada",19,66,60,4.0,6/7/2013,"The food isn't the greatest here. Many seem to like the Chicken Madeira but it is only so-so. The food is probably only worth 2.5 or 3 stars at the most.  I'm giving it 4 stars purely based on their amazing cheesecakes. I've tried almost every single one but my favourite are still the original strawberry and raspberry lime. They are very good and not too sweet.  During my last visit, I had the tiramisu and mango lime and they were also very good. Have it with tea and it won't feel as heavy!  The food portions are also very large and very good value. And fountain pops are free refills!  Be ready to wait in line though. Especially on weekends since this is a popular spot for Canadian shoppers."
Kimberley N.,"Mississauga, Canada",111,364,110,4.0,5/21/2012,"Every time my family and I head to the states we always drop by The Cheesecake Factory. Usually there's always a long wait during the dinner time rush but since we got here for lunch we were seated promptly. The interior of all Cheesecake Factories are huge like a ""factory"", actually not THAT big but it's pretty big for a restaurant. We decided to have lunch out on the patio because of the nice weather. Although it was sunny the patio had lots of shade which was great. We started off with buffalo wings as the appetizer and my sister and I got a strawberry daiquiri. Why not pretend we're in a tropical hot place by having a nice tropical drink? For the main course, my dad and I got the original hamburger, my mom got the grilled salmon, and my sister got the shrimp in angel hair. While we waited our server dropped off a basket of bread which was warm and yummy. The food didn't take long to arrive which was another plus. No one finished their meal besides my mom. My dad and I only finished half of the burger and barely even touched the fries because we were so stuffed. My sister's plate looked like it hasn't even been touched because she was also stuffed. We took everything home and had it for dinner. The total came out to around $80 (including tip) which is pretty decent for a family of 4.  My family would so love it if The Cheesecake Factory opened up in Canada."
Emma I.,"Toronto, Canada",74,15,5,5.0,5/17/2016,"Had dinner here on a weekend trip to Buffalo on a Sunday night. Waited 20 minutes for a table at 7:30 p.m. which wasn't too bad. Beet and goat cheese salad was delicious, so were the crab cakes. Vegan cobb salad was to die for! So fresh and a very generous portion. Server was very friendly and helpful, giving us recommendations. Took a slice of the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecacke to go and it was heavenly. I've had Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake before and it was also incredible. Overall great experience and meal. Can't wait to come back!"
Amol P.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,10,12,1.0,9/8/2013,"Worst restaurant experience ever! 1. First off, we reserved our seats at 8:50pm and there was 40 min waiting time (this place is always crowded). No I am not complaining about the wait. But when the buzzed our beeper for our turn, they made us wait another 10 min, in an already croweded restaurent just to be seated. I mean if you are not really ready, why the hell call your customer.  2. One person directs you to your seat, another one takes your order and another one serves you. I couldn't figure out who exactly was my server since nobody cared to mention that! 3. During our entire dinner, we weren't asked if we liked the food, would like to order anything else or even asked for more water/bevarages. Really!? 4. We requested 4 people, not at all exagerrating, for our check! 5. They also have a bakery and we ordered two cheesecakes to go from there. The cashier had some problems with the payment terminal and took the anger on my card. Cashier swiped my card so hard so many times. I am afraid my card is now damaged. He had to enter the number manually in the machine."
Food E.,"Buffalo, NY",2,55,7,5.0,6/25/2015,"Besides the miscommunication that the waitresses had on who had our table, everything was hot, fresh and delicious!! It was dead because it was during a weekday that we went so we sat right away but I know it's a long wait in evenings and on weekends."
Natasha K.,"Brampton, Canada",34,14,1,5.0,5/14/2016,Love the Louisiana chicken pasta and their brown bread!! Great service and great food always.
Rynier C.,"Lockport, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/14/2016,"Ladies and gentlemen i am a veteran in the restaurant industry with over 35 years experience. Let's start with the Cheesecake Factory Hostess with the leastest.HA She told us (group of 8) our wait would would be between 15-20 minutes, boy was she wrong wait ended up being 50 minutes long. Filled with anticipation and gut wrenching hunger pain. They then had the audacity to seat us in a circular booth and had to bring a chair over to seat is all together. The waiter was cool his name was Justin. He brought us bread and stuff. I might add it was an insufficient amount. You can also supposedly run out of water at the Cheesecake Factory because most of us went with out it for a good 10 minutes. The food was good- when the lime for an order of fish tacos eventually came. One girl in our group had an order of farfalle pasta and there was a god damn penne in the farfalle?? right. To wrap the night up 2 members of my group ordered the same type of cheesecake. THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY only had one slice of this cheesecake. It's in the name how the heck do you run out of it."
Joel L.,"Toronto, Canada",32,205,275,5.0,7/21/2014,"I love going to this place. The only bad is the huge line up but other than that, the service is impeccable and the food is amazing, everytime.  I usually get be Navajo sandwich but unfortunately, they got rid of that.  All their sandwiches are delicious.  The pastas are also good but their spicy dishes are meh.  Buffalo blasts and lettuce wraps are the best appetizers to get. My top choices for dessert are: key lime pie or red velvet cheesecakes."
Jim R.,"Buffalo, NY",1,6,,2.0,5/12/2014,"This was my first visit here, despite being a Buffalo native. My friend from Rochester was in town, and after he raved about the Cheesecake Factory, we decided to go. I ordered the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, which came with carrots and mashed potatoes. The chicken was OK at best, and the mashed potatoes were incredibly salty that I couldn't even finish half of it. The carrots were also not great, although I'm not really a fan of them to begin with, so I'll pass on that. We ordered cheesecake, and I tried the lemon raspberry flavor. That was some of the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted- and the only reason I can give the Cheesecake Factory 2/5 stars. With a name like The Cheesecake Factory, you'd hope that would at least be the somewhat redeeming factor. Thankfully, the dessert can be done right."
Danielle'Charlotte W.,"Tonawanda, NY",19,6,2,1.0,5/15/2016,"The decor is so ugly and outdated. The seating is awful, I had to get out of my seat for other guests to sit down. They put your silverware on the table and don't provide straws unless you ask. Overall just crammed, overpriced, and outdated- only came here because I had a gift card.  Definitely wouldn't come back again."
DJ W.,"Buffalo, NY",565,5,,4.0,9/26/2015,"While you're often waiting quite awhile for a table, especially on a weekend day, it's more than made up for with the amazing food and service. I highly recommend the TexMex eggrolls and their fine salads. And of course... the cheesecake."
Nektaria R.,"Chicago, IL",237,646,723,4.0,12/8/2012,"I'm not a big Cheesecake Factory fan but my coworker from Norway really wanted to visit since it's showcased on the Big Bang Theory. They don't take reservations, but believe me, these guys were amazing to make sure they kept an eye out for us. No promises but they still kept us in mind so when my party showed up, we were immediately seated and had a pretty good experience. The menu has lighted up a great deal. There were several dinner option for under 500 calories that did not skip out on taste. Our server was attentive as was everyone else that came to our table. Everyone was happy with their meals and the bill was divided for us at the end even though we didn't request it from the beginning. That's always a plus in my book. Well who goes to TCF on a diet? You really can't, especially when there's tons of yummy cheesecake to be had. We all ordered a different flavor and then we played pass the plate around the table so we all tasted five different flavors. All were delicious: * OREO® Dream Extreme Cheesecake - Norwegian choice, my 2nd favorite  * Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake™  * Tiramisu Cheesecake  * Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake  * Godiva® Chocolate Cheesecake -my choice and personal favorite * Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake  In any case, for a chain joint, it's a nice option. Check them out."
