Nishita V.,"Mississauga, Canada",27,83,202,4.0,6/5/2013,"I love the selection here. They've got many options for people with dietary restrictions. They even have a separate low-calorie menu!  Be prepared to wait as they stopped taking reservations. We were a party of 2 and told we'd have to wait about 40 mins. We were seated after an hour. A long time when your stomach is growling! A tip: we ordered as soon as we were seated since we had ample time to review the menu and the food arrived in less than 15 mins.  The portions are huge!!! If you want appetizers, I would recommend only ordering one main and sharing it. Or consider ordering a half portion.  Take some dessert to go :)"
J R.,"Getzville, NY",0,31,4,1.0,1/24/2016,"Came here, again. This time tried the Asian lettuce taco's with chicken. Seemed like a good healthy alternative. Each taco had one very small piece of chicken, about the size of a quarter, no more than an ounce. Absolutely ridiculous."
Jody G.,"Buffalo, NY",154,744,201,4.0,8/25/2013,"Yeah...Yeah.... I KNOW it's a chain restaurant.  And, yup...I'm not particularly into chain restaurants..... but it's so darn popular (still, after years of being in the ""Galleria"", people wait and wait with buzzers in hand for a table) that I was quite curious to see what all the hype was about.  So, when I was offered a dinner out for my almost-birthday this seemed like the perfect place to almost-celebrate. We joined the queue, were told that it was a 10-15 minute wait, and received our buzzer.  We headed to the bar to order a pre-meal drink.  Now this place has a MAJOR menu!  Like pages and pages and pages.  There are even a few ads in it (seriously!!) so the reader can take a little break from reading and think about shopping.  We are in a mall after-all.  SO MANY choices!  I was baffled even by the many, many drinks.  I decided to step out of my comfort zone of ordering wine and go with a cocktail.  I chose the ""Factory Peach Bellini"" (Champagne, Peaches and Peach Liqueur all Blended to an Icy Smoothness) which was tasty and refreshing, but a bit too sweet for me.   After about 20 minutes our table was ready.  (Not bad)  The seating process was a bit confusing.... our buzzer was  taken and then we had to wait on another short line to be seated.  But, the people working there seemed to have it all under control.  We were part of a well oiled machine.  All policies and procedures were being followed.  Once seated (long row of bench seats with little space between the tables) I realized how huge and loud this place is.  And, there were a few too many whiny kids (Sorry, mine are now grown and know not to eat pasta with their fingers and throw crayons on the floor ..... so I've become one of ""those"").  The waitress was friendly and efficient though. I once again searched the menu... probably with that ""deer in the headlights"" look on my face.  TOO MANY CHOICES!  Did I want a salad, a sandwich, pasta, chicken, fish, small plates, large plates, pizza, Asian food, Mexican food, Moroccan food (seriously)? Luckily my dining companion (who knows what I like) spied and suggested the ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" (Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown. Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Asparagus). I ordered it and honestly couldn't have been more pleased.  That dish was AMAZING!  Three (!!!) chicken breast halves (I brought two home for another meal) were pounded fresh and cooked perfectly.  And, the accompanying side dishes were cooked just right.  The red skin (on) smashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of lumpiness.... and the asparagus was steamed to a delightful tender crunch.  And the lemon sauce was light, yet flavorful and drizzled on my plate with what appeared to be a loving and competent hand... not too much.... not too little.... just right! My dining companion loved his ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" (Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguine).  I had a forkful and it was fresh, spicy, and delicious.  And (I almost forgot) the bread that was brought to the table (mini loaves of white and honey wheat) were so good that I was tempted to throw the leftovers in my purse (but alas, I controlled myself). For dessert we simply HAD to try some cheesecake (ummm....this is ""The Cheesecake Factory"" after-all).  Again, SO MANY choices!  Over thirty kinds!!! Everything from regular... to cookie dough... to pina colada... to chocolate... to pineapple upside-down... to creme brulee... to Kahlua... to peppermint bark...  Being ""purists"" we opted for one slice of ""Original with Fresh Strawberries"" with two forks.  It was THE BEST cheesecake I've ever had in a restaurant.  Perfect density, wonderful graham cracker crust, huge ripe strawberries, and a garnish of real (!!!) whipped cream... it was just the right size for sharing... and a perfect ending to a (surprisingly) delicious meal."
Michael G.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,66,60,2.0,11/4/2014,This particular location was not up to The Cheesecake Factory standards. I had the bang bang shrimp and chicken it was just ok  my colleague had the shrimp scampi which was good but the pasta overlooked. Avocado egg roll was great ! Should have stayed w appetizers and wine
Sara J.,"Buffalo, NY",0,2,1,4.0,12/29/2014,It was my first visit and I loved it! The wait was only 15 minutes on a Saturday night. The menu has a lot going on. We started with an appetizer which came very quickly. The waitress was so nice and attentive! They didn't seem short staffed and every section had a waiter. The food was delicious. I ordered garlic noodles with chicken and my partner ordered Jamaican blackened chicken and shrimp. I also had a Long Island iced tea and cheesecake to go! My only complaint...the bathrooms were terrible :(
Ben Z.,"Inner Richmond, San Francisco, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/26/2014,Slow service and It was not busy. Waitress asked if we wanted lemons or lime with or sparking water & we said yes to lemon but never gave it to us. The soup was way too salty. The roasted almond chicken salad Sandwhich  had NO almonds. We ordered chicken tacos but they never offered hot sauce... Staff needs some re-training perhaps.
Yvonne T.,"Toronto, Canada",123,599,1794,3.0,10/3/2013,"When I'm in the U.S. I'm always looking to eat at places that I can't normally find in Canada.  If you can endure the wait (we had to wait an hour) then you'll be fine.  We were so hungry that we went to the takeout counter and had a slice of cheesecake until our buzzer went off.   The cheesecake isn't cheap here.  Almost $8 for a slice.  And while it is better than your standard grocery store stuff, I don't see what all the hype is about other than ""you can't get it in Canada.""  Maybe it's the sheer variety of flavours available (everything from original, to mango key lime to chocolate raspberry... and for the dieters, there's even a low-fat option). The place itself is actually quite massive and the menu is quite large as well. Since it was already quite late in the evening, we didn't have a huge dinner.  We were just glad to sit down and get something into our stomachs after a 6-hour day at the outlet mall. We ate: Chicken + Shrimp Gumbo --  Nothing fancy and the shrimps are tiny tiny, but you do get quite a few of them.  Great flavors.  And it's awesome that you can opt for brown rice, though it does zap up the sauce quite quickly. Pulled Pork Sandwich -- Served on a brioche bun.  Very saucy and the pork was extremely tender, but the brioche bun could not stand up to the saucy filling and got quite soggy.  I also found the pulled pork to be wayyyyyyyyy too sweet (and that's saying a lot coming from me).  Mom subbed regular fries with sweet potato fries for an extra $1.  The fries need some work. We also opted for the Buffalo Wings (when in Buffalo....) I don't know if it's just me, but I find the wings in the U.S. to be a lot meatier than the wings in Canada!  This came with the standard celery sticks and blue cheese sauce.  Quite good. So I tried it and it was okay.  Service was quite good (though I find service in the U.S. to generally be better than Canada).  Nothing was particularly bad, but nothing was particularly good.  I actually think I prefer Jack Astor's more."
Yvonne B.,"Depew, NY",45,61,253,1.0,5/11/2014,"I'm here with my husband to celebrate Mother's Day. We were disappointed with the food and the presentation. First We ordered Red Sangria and they were pretty good. Then we ordered Chicken Bellagio and shrimp scampi which were cold and the angel hair pasta were so dry like it was sitting under the heating lamp for a decade. The position was a lot smaller than we usually get. Really disappointed with the food. However, the server was really nice. I don't think I'm coming back here again tho."
Rom P.,"Jamaica, NY",34,45,72,2.0,9/1/2010,"Most Cheesecake Factories are huge, this one is no different. The place looks like a hotel and casino lobby. Don't let the atmosphere fool you though, this place isn't special. The food is overpriced for food that is average at best. Go for what they're known for. That's the cheesecake. They have a long list to satisfy anyone's palette. Did I mention your wait time may be awhile?"
Al M.,"Toronto, Canada",0,44,17,4.0,9/7/2013,"The food and ambiance has not changed. The line up are getting shorter, which is nice. The selection has not changed much, which is alright if your a fan of the cheesecake factory.The size of the portions are the same and the food still taste the same, which is great. Still think is one of the great place to go for food you know and love. Of course the cheesecakes. Still the best and hard to beat.  Will be trying the Cheesecake Factory in Vegas next month."
Nikki A.,"Buffalo, NY",78,80,146,5.0,8/21/2014,Great cocktail menu a lot of creative and different things. Excellent presentation on all drinks. The menu is crazy big but great for groups or people with different tastes in food. Very generous food portions. Be prepared to wait if its an evening during the summer or any weekend night of the year. Save room for dessert
Sarah C.,"Buffalo, NY",3,9,4,4.0,7/12/2014,"The first time my husband and I ate here it was awful. We ordered pasta which was a mistake - it tasted microwaved. HOWEVER, I went there today with a friend and had the chopped salad and fish tacos and they were really great. I would just avoid the pasta dishes."
Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,3.0,6/18/2012,"The Cheesecake factory is our favorite restaurant and we will still drive 3 hours to Buffalo just to eat here.  However as I  mentioned in an earlier review we have enjoy the Cheesecake Factory better in Rochester NY, Pittsburgh, and Iowa.  This location is way OVERCROWDED, and the service has not been as up to par.  Two times ago when we were in the waitress never even brought us bread, last time we had to ask.  With that said we love the Cheesecake factory, it is delicious and w e enjoy everything about it. We just hope they come to Michigan so we can stop going to the Buffalo location."
Dakota P.,"Ottawa, Canada",0,61,21,4.0,8/7/2012,"Even though there was a 40 minute wait for a table on a Monday night at 8PM, my friend insisted that we go try the cheesecake factory. I thought to myself, why not? Boy was I glad.  Their strawberry cheesecake was heaven in my mouth. I admit, it is overpriced (about $8 for a slice), but when you are at a restaurant called the cheesecake factory, it's a given you're gonna try a slice.  For dinner I had the salmon and steak combination which also came with a large helping of mashed potatos. The steak was perfect, it came just the way I asked it to be. However, some might not like that they chop our steak for you, so let them know in advance if you don't like people touching your steak.  Both my friend and I were beyond stuffed.  The service is ok. The waitress we had tried to convice us to order more, but it was a good thing we didn't because we couldn't even finish what we ordered. Our food arrived quite promptly even though the restaurant was crazy packed. Our bread basket came right after we took our orders. Bread was fresh and moist.  Even though we were only just starting our cheesecake, our waitress started taking plates off our tables and gave us our bill. I was a little annoyed by this, but I guess you can't really blame them as they were crazy packed.  I will definately come back again as a treat even if it's just for cheesecake. Whole cheesecakes are available for sale but they require 2 hours to defrost. If you just want to grab a slice of cheesecake to go, there is a takeout counter just for cheesecake."
Jen I.,"Markham, Canada",120,229,27,5.0,6/7/2011,"I can't believe this place has such low reviews...you can't rate a place low because they give you TOO MUCH food...how silly is that? Anyway....this was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory, as last time I came to Buffalo the wait time was 75 minutes to get in. It felt like I was being let in to some exclusive club. It felt massive inside, but at the same time when I was waiting to be seated I felt like I was just in everyone's way.  Their menu is like a novel. It's maybe a little TOO big, it took way too long to decide what I wanted to eat. I settled on the Grilled Chicken & Avocado club. Holy crap...maybe the best sandwich I've ever had? SO much chicken....lots of avocado...I find whenever I order something with Avocado in it that there's barely any so I was pleasantly surprised. The bread was amazing...buttered and grilled like a grilled cheese. It was just so tasty. Anyone complaining about how fattening it is here...you're eating at a place called the ""Cheesecake Factory""...shouldn't that be expected?  For dessert I got the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake was was like heaven on a plate. Red velvet is my FAVORITE and this piece was massive. So big that I had to take half home...not that I was complaining.  I can't wait to go back and try something else. This place lived up to all my expectations."
Jesse B.,"Oshawa, Canada",6,12,8,4.0,7/30/2014,"Fantastic. I hate ordering pasta because of the markup. Ordered pasta and it was amazing. Cheesecake is to die for. Decor is impressive. Expect a wait, do yourself a favour and reserve a table ahead of time."
Michelle Y.,"Toronto, Canada",0,60,,3.0,6/1/2012,"My entree: 2 stars My cheesecake: 5 stars I'm averaging the Cheesecake Factory to 3 stars! After a long day of shopping, it was a long wait for a table at the Cheesecake Factory. We were too lazy to find another restaurant. The food is average at best (I had the meatloaf) but the cheesecakes are fantastic. I would come back only for dessert next time!"
Oreo C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",28,179,24,4.0,9/21/2012,"Cheesecake factory has never really disappointed me or my gf for all the visits i've been there. I don't really understand why there are so many complaints about the size of the portions... yes they are big but why not just get 1 and share? Anyways, I am just reviewing in terms of food quality, price and atmosphere. The quality is pretty decent, nothing super like alan wong's in Honnolulu (but its at least 2 times the price there) but I mean it seems like a decent go to joint.  The cheesecake is definitely a highlight of the place and many of them are decent but I think our favorite is the Banana Creme. Yes there is a lot of whipped cream but you can ask them to not give you so much or just not eat it. Choice is yours. Oh yes and I agree the wait is usually long but what decent place doesn't require a wait?"
Kassie S.,"Buffalo, NY",3,3,1,2.0,4/9/2014,"I would not recommend to anyone unless you are in the mall already and do not want anything but cheesecake. We did curbside to go as I ha a hankering for cheesecake but we hadn't had dinner yet. We got fried cheese crisps, a pizza, and 2 slices of cheesecake. I called Cheesecake Factory to let them know I was there as I was instructed to do when I placed the order, and then waited. And waited. And waited some more. After I arrived at the scheduled time for food pickup, I waited over 15 minutes. So I called again and the lady I spoke with apologized and said I must have been forgotten about but she would send someone out. About 4 minutes later our food was delivered to the car, pizza and cheese crisps cold of course. Obviously the cheesecake was delicious but the service on their curbside to go was tremendously poor."
RJ S.,"Toronto, Canada",37,76,119,2.0,4/25/2011,"Only get the Cheesecake! On my way back from NYC, my friends wanted to stop by and eat dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. At first I was all for going b/c I definitely LOVE their cheesecake so possibly the food might be just as great. The interior of the restaurant is absolutely amazing, with over 50 foot ceilings a beautiful bar area with sports playing on the monitors to a very lovely and comfortable seating area, the bathrooms as well was very clean. As for the food from what my friends told me the portion size is pretty big, which it was. However that's as far as it got. The items that I got was the popcorn shrimp for an app, and the steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. I was not impressed by the actual food, yes there was a lot, but it's all about the taste and lets face it was bland, there was no flavor at all. I usually don't add any sauce to my food but I needed to in order to at least finish my food. The popcorn shrimp was very oily and bland, I did expect oil but not as much as I got to a point where I had to blot the batter with tissue or just take it off completely and eat just the shrimp. The seafood dip that they gave wasn't that great either it didn't have that kick that most places have with their seafood sauce. The mayo dip however was good. As for the main course the steak was cooked to my liking (medium rare) however there was no taste whatsoever where I had to ask them to bring me some steak sauce which I never usually have to use. The only upside was the salmon. It was cooked perfectly very moist and flavorful, but I do think that without the herb crust it might have been hard to finish it. Finally I ended it with red velvet cheesecake, one of my favorite cheesecakes that they had. At least I ended my dinner with something very very good. Average price for apps $7-$12, Main course $15-40, and cheesecake $5-$8 depending on which cheesecake. Items to definitely get Cheesecake! -tiramisu -red velvet -Godiva -Oreo -chocolate tuxedo -chocolate raspberry truffle"
