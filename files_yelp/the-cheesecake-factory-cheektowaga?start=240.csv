Kobie B.,"Erie, PA",18,15,11,5.0,4/5/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory great food, service and the atmosphere is very nice. The Crazy Craig's Carrot Cake is the best."
Anson T.,"Toronto, Canada",44,8,3,4.0,5/24/2015,"The food was great here. It came out very quickly too! The cheesecake was what you would expect from a place called the Cheesecake Factory - amazing. The service was pretty good too. Well, except for the fact that when I asked for cheese, the server grated it on me instead of the food... Literally. That's where I had to take the star away. If it weren't for the fantastic cheesecake ending, I would've been pretty disgruntled."
Jenn B.,"Orchard Park, NY",18,13,1,4.0,8/24/2011,"I am a very health-conscious person. That said, if you too watch what you eat, I do not recommend going here to eat. Their food, while sinfully delicious, comes in HUGE portions that I would easily be able to split with one or even two other people. And not just the main course, either. I've had cheesecake here several times and an Apple cobbler a la mode and both were WAY more than I could ever hope to eat in one sitting, especially following the meal.  Besides that, it's a fun place to go with friends or for a special occasion, and if you're sick of the same old boring desserts their cheesecake flavor list is a mile long so you never have to worry about having to order the same desert twice. Unless, of course, you want to. They're a bit pricy, most of their entrees were probably started around $12, with quite a few of them going significantly higher than that. The thing I loved about their menu was that they have something called ""Small plates and snacks"" and ""pizzettes"". I love trying new things so the little plates and pizzettes are just a small sample of one thing. Two of them make a perfect meal that isn't too big, and they're around $5 each, more or less."
roman d.,"Rego Park, NY",49,135,9,5.0,1/19/2014,"Great place to go. Been here a few times with my wife after doing some shopping at the mall. Very friendly and attentive staff. Also, very clean. Food is always fresh and tasty. Had a great waitress named Mindy. Very bubbly personally and made it a pleasant dining experience. We will be going back."
Diana M.,"Buffalo, NY",75,170,18,1.0,11/25/2013,We were a booth behind a huge pillar and right across from the servers POS machine...........need I say anymore?
Elizabeth C.,"Buffalo, NY",11,130,,3.0,9/18/2013,"Great desserts but that about it. It's so loud you can't carry on a conversation with your dinner companions. Too many items on the menu result in nothing being really great. Have a smaller selection and focus on quality and not quantity. Spend your mom elsewhere for dinner, then have dessert here."
Britany S.,"Brampton, Canada",153,227,699,5.0,12/16/2013,"When I'm usually in buffalo I will pick up a cheesecake to go but this weekend I decided to done in. One of the best decisions I've made in my life. Have you ever ordered something and had low expectations and then it completely knocked you off your feet and left you wanting more day by day? Well that's how I feel about the sweet corn tamales. It's just savoury, crunch and sweet then topped with fresh cilantro and creamy avacados and sour cream and the acidity of the salsa just cuts right through the dish. Absolutely perfection. I'm in love. It's a bittersweet feelings because our relationship is kim distance and we don't have a Cheesecake Factory in Canada. Also the red velvet cheesecake is probably one of the best cheesecakes I've ever ate. So overall I more than satisfied with my meal. An honourable mention goes to my main entree. I had BBQ salmon, mashed potatoes and a corn succotash. Wish tasted pretty good but my appetizer and dessert definitely overshadows it. And the portions sizes at this place are generous so stop by!"
'Rena B.,"Toronto, Canada",1,13,1,5.0,1/9/2014,Mmmmmm I've only had the cheesecakes but I can only imagine what the rest of the menu tastes like. I recommend the banana cheeks cake and the red velvet!
Joel G.,"Ajax, Canada",2,7,3,5.0,1/4/2014,"We always look forward to visiting the Cheese Cake Factory. There is generally a long wait, but as long you expect it, it really isn't a big deal. There are plenty of things to keep you busy while you wait including shopping. If you prefer not to wait, it isn't too hard to find spot at the bar, where you can still get the same dinner options. Arrived during happy hour (4-6 PM) on a Friday. They had drink specials, and a long list of five dollar appetizers. We were pleasantly surprised by the value, and couldn't get over the size of the portions.  Really enjoyed the Avocado Eggrolls and the Buffalo Blasts."
Chris C.,"Black Rock, Buffalo, NY",2,21,2,4.0,12/6/2013,Been here twice. Once for lunch once for dinner. Both times we were served promptly and the food was really good. Fun drink menu and great desserts. Great staff and very friendly. We'll be back.
Ian S.,"Jensen Beach, FL",17,16,,2.0,12/7/2010,"Well at least the cheesecake is tremendous, because the entrees are lackluster.  The wait is always ridiculously long, and the beepers they hand you have a limited radius so you can't wander too far, which leads to 900 people at any given moment slouched outside against the wall.  I think if you're a tourist or one of our neighbors to the north (or west in this case) you'll probably try this place out since it seems to be the staple restaurant at the mall.  I think one of the problems is the menu is so ridiculously large there's no possible way the chefs can possibly prepare all the menu options adequately.     Back to the cheesecake though, since that is their gimmick after all.  The brownie sundae cheesecake is probably the best dessert option I've had at any restaurant anywhere, and it is available for takeout as is any of the other cheesecake options.  Taken as a sitdown restaurant, however, the food was pretty lackluster."
Krystle B.,"Alexandria, VA",13,32,,2.0,9/16/2011,"Just go for the cheesecake, Bad service, bad food, and I know their birthday song by heart after 1 evening. I don't know how someone can jack up an arugula salad, but congrats, soggy and overdressed. Waitress clearly had somewhere better to be. Just stick to cocktails & desert and save yourself the overpriced, flavorless entrees."
Tony H.,"Toronto, Canada",133,188,39,3.0,8/7/2013,"Nice decor and plenty of seating.  The food is standard chain restaurant quality, but the portion size is decently large.  I had the Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo, which was cooked ok, but just wasn't tasty.  My date had the Alfredo pasta, but felt it was way too salty.  We talked to the manager who was genuinely apologetic and order some similar for us on the house.  Service was surprisingly great here.  The cheesecakes are indeed great here.  You can't go wrong with any of them and they can package single slices to go for you."
Edwin B.,"Buffalo, NY",57,98,539,4.0,11/8/2011,"There are so many items on the menu.  I wonder how they organize and run the kitchen.  Gotta get the Oreo Cheesecake! The food is good.  A little above average, but you can go here with anyone and have them find something to eat."
David B.,"San Jose, CA",13,92,31,4.0,7/12/2010,"This review is for the bar area only. At 11:00 PM on a Thursday night (technically closing time), I got a very well-made, GENEROUS Manhattan with a bourbon upgrade for $10.50. That's aces in my book. My only quibble is that I was not asked rocks or up (I prefer up; it came rocks). Decor, lighting, and seating in the bar area are all comfortable. A reliable back-stop when everything else in the area is closing..."
Roma M.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",241,439,157,3.0,6/16/2010,"I don't think those informed about American chain restaurants decide to eat at one with the expectation of receiving something light and healthy. I know I don't. Each meal here can very easily satisfy two people. That would explain the huge number of take out bags you'll see if you drive by any CF in the country.  I would never refuse the option of eating here when I'm in Buffalo on a shopping day trip, even though it can get very busy on weekends and evenings. If they are busy, the waiting list option is convenient, as they hand you the awesome vibrating buzzer and you can go shopping nearby at Sephora, Urban Outfitters or Occitane until you hear the glorious buzzing. They can have acceptable to great service, depending on the server, yet the host is always graceful and cheery, and can point you to the cool, sunny 'patio' when the whether is nice and warm(although, the view of the parking lot is unfortunate). My favourite options are the pizza, pasta, chicken done any which way and grilled portabella on a bun, and I'd steer clear of their seafood dishes and mexican options, because as great as the CF is, their seafood isn't fresh at all (no surprises for a chain restaurant) and they really don't know how to cook beans and rice."
Ryan S.,"Toronto, Canada",7,29,6,1.0,3/12/2010,"I just wanted to add some thoughts on the Cheesecake Factory, mostly because, as a person who has really changed the way he eats, this place scares me.  The reason is that I was here for lunch (believe me, this fact is important) about two years ago.  That would be before I was paying attention to what I was eating.   We went because my wife loves cheesecake and we had been told that it was THE place to go.  We ordered lunch size pastas.  When they arrived, I was exceedingly shocked.  I had never seen a portion of this magnitude in my life!  This is, pretty close, to the exchange with the server that ensued. Me: I think you brought the dinner size instead of the lunch. Server: No, that is the lunch size. Me: You mean there is a bigger size?!? Server: Yes. Me: (I may have forgotten my manners here) And people actually eat it?!?!?! (You'll notice the increase of my shock) Server: All the time. Had we split the 'lunch' size, my wife and I might have finished half of it.  Needless to say, we still do not know what their cheesecake is like.  We both felt so full, we felt ill.  All that, with about 3 pounds of leftovers that took three hungry friends to finish.   And to top it all off, it was all pretty plain.  There was nothing there that gave a really great flavour experience.   Sad, but true...and just a bit amusing in retrospect."
Nathan P.,"Tonawanda, NY",115,68,71,3.0,11/4/2014,"Came here last week on a Tuesday, and i attempted to call ahead as I've been told this place gets quite busy. I was told over the phone that they do not take reservations or have call-ahead wait list. This was not an issue because we were seated immediately when we arrived. Our host and server were extremely friendly. Our server offered to explain the menu to us as it is HUGE, but we declined as we wanted to explore it on our own. Their draft beer selection is very very small (3 beers) so i chose a Blue Light and my girl got a glass of wine. She ordered the Sheila salad and i ordered the Chicken Bellagio. Her salad was huge and had lots of chicken and tasted pretty good. Mine was predominately pasta with 2 small chicken breasts on top. I liked the prosciutto and arugula combo on the top and tasted good when mixed in with the pasta.  Overall I wasn't too impressed with the quality of food for the price I paid. There menu is huge and has an option for everyone, but honestly I think there are much better options in Buffalo for the price. I don't think I'll be back."
Dawn E.,"East Aurora, NY",2,19,13,3.0,2/12/2015,"We came to the CF for my cousins birthday. Its a very appealing restaurant. Except we were seated by a ""station""& I did not like the fact that every time I looked up waiters & waitresses backs were facing me and just chatting away with one another, I felt I had no privacy.  The 25 page menu is a bit much though,  by the time I was on page 5 it was hard to remember what I Read previously, way too many advertisements ...ugh. Mushroom burger, Bbq Chicken & Chicken Marsala was ordered. ""Burger tasted like a burger"" I just thought for 13.00 it would have been given a better review but I guess not. I had the Chicken Marsala, it was ok...just ok. The Bbq Chicken was dry but the Broccoli was so fresh it just melted in your mouth. The desserts were very very tasty!!!  Banana cream cheesecake was absolutely amazing!!!! It was so smooth and creamy, Mmm.. The other order was a 5 layer chocolate cheesecake it could have fed 4 people, (it was a huge piece) The birthday girl had that. Our waitress was Rebecca and she did a AWESOME job she was very outgoing and friendly and made sure we all were well taken care of throughout our dining stay. I do have to say for 4 people to eat.. it was 120.00  kinda pricey for what we ordered and how it tasted, but I guess the dessert and great customer service kind of made up for it. I might go back and try to remember pages 6-25 of the menu and order something else ...Just to give them another chance to WOW me with the food and not just the desserts...But after all it is ""CHEESECAKE FACTORY"" :) Maybe just Coffee and Desserts next time."
Mozart A.,"Whitby, Canada",4,55,4,5.0,5/7/2010,"Whaaaaat? How can this place have less than five stars? Did you all actually eat their food? I went there many, many times and never once I tasted something that I didn't love. OK, maybe that's because they cram as much fat on the food as it could possibly hold, but man, talk about delicious, tasty, awesome MFing fatty food. Popcorn shrimp, crab cakes, Hibach steak, four-cheese pasta, beef ribs... and on the actual cheesecakes... Godiva. Enough said. Come to think of it, it's a good thing that they're not here in Toronto. My arteries could not handle that."
