Chris K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,1.0,5/26/2015,We went here for an afternoon snack and we planned on getting cheesecake also but the experience we had made us decide to go somewhere else.  We decided to sit in the bar area at the high top tables where we normally do.  We noticed instantly that there was only one waitress working the entire bar seating.  After a long wait we decided to order the Four Cheese Pasta before the cheesecake.  The waitress specifically asked us if we wanted the dinner portion or the lunch portion.  We told her the dinner portion which was almost $15 so we expected a large portion (we also knew that they are known for their large portions). However when a runner brought it out the dish was TINY! Because it was a runner we decided not to eat it right away because we assumed the waitress would be checking on us rather quickly.  However she was slowed down by a large group of 8 that was ordering very slowly (not the waitress's fault) so we waited a good 10 minutes after the food came before we could ask the waitress if they gave us the lunch portion instead.  She said she put in the dinner portion but she also said that it did look a little skimpy!! So she took the dish into the back and asked the kitchen staff would told her it was indeed the dinner portion.  SO basically we had a waitress tell us that their portion was tiny and now because we waited the food was cold.  At least because there was only about 15 ziti size noodles in the dish it didn't take us long to finish it.  Because of this horrible experience with the food we decided to skip on the cheesecake and never return to this restaurant.
Kelly T.,"Minneapolis, MN",320,784,9,2.0,8/7/2007,"I lived on take-out  from their location in DC when I was in law school. Huge portions, generally adequate formulaic food.   Should do well in the Buffy--note ""huge portions"" and something for everyone.   I'm not into big messy noisy crowds, so I will stay away."
Jen L.,"Lockport, NY",85,228,22,2.0,2/22/2012,"The food is very average. I mean, in a pinch it works. It's food and they really have something for everyone. The menu is something like 20-pages long. They've got pasta, burgers, sandwiches, some kind of tex-mex items, omelets, salads, etc. Lots of cheesecake which is not the best cheesecake I've ever had. The one REALLY crazycakes thing about this place is the wait time. I know it's the mall but a three-hour wait for a table at dinnertime on Saturday? What? We were smart enough to put in our names and go shop for a bit (only a 90 minute wait when we arrived but it was three hours when we left) but the sad, noisy masses standing about waiting to be seated was painful. Like stepping on my feet and ramming into my back painful. Not going back unless the place is empty."
Danielle K.,"Buffalo, NY",6,10,8,1.0,9/10/2013,"We arrived around 5:30 P.M. and, to our chagrin, it was packed. All the seats we were able to see were full, and there were a few parties in front of us obviously waiting to be seated. Shockingly, we were seated within ten minutes, as we admired how nice the interior of the restaurant was. Though being greeted by a cheerful individual at the front door, there was also a din of pop hits that we had to verbally compete with the entire night. Not particularly enjoyable, but there are few exceptions in the realm of dining establishments where you won't find that. In such a beautiful atmosphere, full of people of all ages, you'd expect the food to be quite impressive. The menu itself was thick enough to be a short novel. Paging through it, you come to the conclusion this is one of those restaurants that, instead of specializing in one or two types of cuisine and doing them very well, they attempt to do it all. Thai (and tons of Asian fusion dishes), Italian, Mexican, classic American, Greek, breakfast, lunch specials, dinner, and of course dessert. Everything from Orange Chicken to Shepherd's Pie, White Bean Hummus to Fettuccini Alfredo, Very overwhelming. Shortly after we received our drinks, we were given a stingy basket of moderately fresh bread, which was never offered to be refilled. After a long debate on what we were going to order, it was decided. My ex-boyfriend ordered the 'Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger' ($11); my mother not being particularly starving ordered a cup of their soup of the day, which turned out to be 'Mexican Chicken Tortilla' ($5) and one of what they consider their Small Plates and Snacks, the 'Wild Mushroom Flatbread' ($6). I, being the large fan of seafood that I am, settled on the 'Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna' ($21). Our waitress disappeared, and so began the half-an-hour wait for our entrees (along with my mother's soup, which she would've liked sooner). As we waited for our own food to arrive, we witnessed plate after plate being served to those (too close for comfort) around us being served giant portions of food--most of which we couldn't identify. A woman sitting across from us was in the process of eating a salad that could've fed three or four people, and she let their waitress take it away when 3/4 of it remained in the bowl. Huge plates of gelatinous slop that we guessed were to be Chicken and Biscuits or something covered in a white gravy seemed to be rather popular--portions that the average human being could never choke down in one sitting unless they'd been starved for an extended period of time, especially as they weren't particularly appetizing looking. My ex-better half's hamburger was the highlight of the evening, and, with me being a pescetarian, saying that is quite disturbing, though in comparison to what we'd previously seen, it was a surprisingly small portion of food. His burger, cooked perfectly medium, was piled high with onion rings, bacon, barbecue sauce, and what he thought was cabbage that was shredded. My mother's soup was more like a rice casserole, with a small amount of broth, which happens to be her favorite aspect of soup. She sent it back, and received a bowl almost identical, though in this bowl there were a large amount of unpeeled carrots that she unhappily pointed out to our waitress, who later comped it from our bill. The Wild Mushroom Flatbread was actually quite good and, if it were bigger, we might even return for it. My tuna was fairly disappointing, though it was also cooked perfectly rare and was a beautiful piece of fish. The 'crust' was soggy and tasteless, with the consistency of a grated sponge. And for something claiming to have wasabi as an ingredient, I expected to experience a tingle in my nose: something spicy! It sat on a bed of inconsistently cooked white rice, which was surrounded by an overcooked shredded sea of carrot, zucchini, and other unidentifiable, tasteless vegetables. The menu claimed that the liquid was miso flavored, but it could've passed for a bland butter sauce. Finally having her remove those plates from our table was no big loss. Seeing as we were at the Cheesecake Factory, it only seemed right to get dessert, though my mother didn't agree. I ordered a cup of coffee and the 'Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake', and my ex-better half ordered the cherry cheesecake. There were no pieces of actual Snickers baked into it, as the menu told us, and the bottom was mysteriously soggy--though somehow it still tasted all right. My ex-boyfriend enjoyed his with no complaints, and their coffee was quite good. Overall, I don't think we'll be returning, because we are more for quality over quantity, and not the other way around. This 'factory' seems as though its main focus is cranking out huge portions of food to convince the customer that they're getting a lot for their money; it just isn't particularly good."
Luiz G.,"Buffalo, NY",4,44,1,1.0,11/25/2011,"After two years I decided to write this review. I went to the restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday  and arrived three hours before because this was the waiting time. But when I told that was my wife's birthday and we had a group of 10 to come, the sit lady told us that even if they called us before the 3 hours would not be a problem if everyone was not there. Then they called us before the 3 hours and only 2 arrived to met us. The manager received us and told that was not possible to hold the table and treated us like liars because we told that we explained that the sit lady was OK. On the end he just turned his back to us and left us talking alone with his back like we were not there. My wife until today does not want to come back there because they almost spoil her birthday."
J Y.,"Toronto, Canada",0,38,,4.0,7/9/2012,"My second time here wasn't as great as the first, but it was still a good experience. I ordered their frozen iced mango drink. I like mango drinks, but this time around there was too much raspberry for my liking. It was still pretty good though. Their Hibachi Steak was delicious! I personally liked this more than the Chicken Madeira I ordered last time. Portions were relatively small, which is fine for me because it's still a filling size for an average sized person.  Unfortunately, service wasn't as good as before. It's probably because our waiter was on break at the time and his area was being covered by two other people, so we had three servers that evening and somewhat inconsistent service. It wasn't too bad, but my first time there was pretty dang amazing, so I was expecting that again. Food is still good though, and portions are large enough for a lot of people to ask for take-out plates.  Oh, and the downside of this place was that we had to wait over an hour to be seated. But since we were inside a mall around the time when people were leaving (though the stores were still open), it wasn't too bad of a wait =)."
Neil T.,"Toronto, Canada",295,149,58,1.0,10/14/2008,"So you want to know why obesity is so prevalent in America? The reason why 66% of people over the age of 20 are overweight? The evidence: The Cheesecake Factory. I went to the Cheesecake Factory, one of the most popular restaurants in America, for the first time yesterday. This is an American institution like apple pie or pre-emptive wars. What is funny about this restaurant is that it does not disclose it's nutritional information anywhere. In fact, there are no Cheesecake Factory locations in New York City because of this reason (the city requires nutritional disclosure for their restaurants). I discovered why... I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado club. This monster contained two thick slices of white bread (generously buttered on the outside of both slices), herb mayo (again, smothered on the inside of both sides), two slices of Swiss cheese, three strips of bacon, a grilled chicken breast, about 1/4 of an avocado (the only fruit to contain fat), and tomato (only healthy thing on there). By my calculation, the sandwich above was over 1,300 calories and 60 g of fat. Add on a massive side of fries (included in the entree) and you can add 500 more calories and 35 g of fat. Want to add dessert? Tack on another 1,150 calories and 74 g of fat for a slice of cheesecake. If you have a soda with your meal, add another 200 calories.  The total damage? 3,150 calories and 169 g of fat in ONE MEAL. For most people, that is a day and half worth of calories and nearly three days of fat in ONE MEAL. This is why I threw up in my mouth a little."
Carla C.,"North York, Canada",14,12,6,5.0,4/5/2010,Ok this place a serious must when visiting our neighbours across the boarder.   I strong recommend to not order any appetizers unless you want to feel sick to your stomach!  The portions are huuuuuge - remember where you are! yeah everything is supersized! I've tried a couple of dishes from pasta to chicken tenders but I always have a weakness for their hamburgers! omg to die for.  Home made style and pretty huge - I suggest getting a salad rather than fries becuase you are not going to eat them! And of course there's the name sake to this place - the cheesecakes! omg! about 50 flavors and the portions are a meal in themselves but oh so worth it! We usually end off a day of shopping with this last pit stop!
Christopher B.,"East Amherst, NY",76,51,,2.0,3/4/2009,"There's a first time for everything, as they say... and last night was CB's first time dining at the popular Cheesecake Factory.  Wish I could write a better review, but overall my visit was marred by flubs and mediocracy. We did not have to wait long for a table.. maybe 5 minutes, but it was about 7-7:30pm on a tuesday night.  The restaurant was well decorated, but waaay too dark (i could've used a flashlight on the way to the men's room).  The dining room was near full-capacity and we were seated within INCHES of the next table.  In fact, we were seated inbetween two other parties.  I don't enjoy dining so close to strangers, so this didn't help.  The music being played was ODD, to say the least.  A mix of bossa nova and Michael McDonald-like easy listening.  Note to the Cc Fctry: STICK TO A GENRE AND GO WITH IT! As for the menu... extensive.. almost too extensive.  I felt like the menu needed CHAPTERS.  Nevertheless, the meals were quite large... when we eventually got them.  There were extensive delays in the kitchen, numerous ""updates"" from the waitress and even one from the manager... offering us a free slice of cheesecake for the long wait.   The food was average / nothing special.  The cheesecake was VERY rich, and VERY good.  If i was ever to return, I would bring a flashlight/lantern and come only for dessert."
Jeffrey B.,"Tonawanda, NY",0,8,,4.0,7/28/2012,A little pricey but the food was really good. Def going back service was excellent.
Adriano A.,"Toronto, Canada",7,36,9,2.0,12/14/2009,"Usually when I pick a restaurant, I want them to be good at one thing. Pizza places should be great at pizza, delis great with sliced meat sandwiches and cheesecake factories great with cheesecake. This isn't necessarily a problem as The Cheesecake Factory does make excellent cheesecake, but that's pretty much where it ends.  The problem is, by the time you get to the cheesecake, the experience is sullied by the dinner before it. The portions are gigantic. It might be my comparitively small, Canadian appetite, but I rarely finish my main dish.  They definitely choose quantity over quality, as the gigantic meals don't really have much that's special about them. I've had the steak sandwich and the meatloaf, and though they were both edible, they weren't worth the price they asked for.  The wait staff is kind and courteous; the odd time you actually see them. They're usually too busy with the volume of tables they're left responsible for, communicating primarily through walkie-talkies. The prices are reasonable considering the amount of food that you get, but these are American-sized portions, so you definitely get your money's worth.  The best part of the night is the namesake of the restaurant - the cheesecake. It doesn't disappoint. There are plenty of choices and I've never heard of anyone who was disappointed with the cheesecake. Probably the best you'll find in a chain-restaurant, but by the time it's time for cheesecake, you're too stuffed with mediocre food to appreciate it. (Tip: If you're planning on walking around the mall, get a number from the wait staff first as some wait-times can be up to two hours long.)"
Debbi P.,"Brentwood, CA",33,136,5,3.0,11/24/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory has a great range of food for everyone, but their specialty definitely lies in their cheesecakes (and their cocktails :-) I had a dish that was definitely much better at another location of theirs, and their service was a little on the slow side.  Overall, typical Cheesecake Factory, but if you've never been - then get dessert to go! The calories are worth it!"
Es P.,"Burnaby, Canada",0,78,17,2.0,7/3/2011,"Quantity over quality.  Cheesecakes, meh.  Had better for a lot less.  This place is a change from the American formula:  a lot of stuff for next to nothing.  This place has good portions but ain't cheap.  Food isn't that great and not worth the line up."
Tee W.,"Kew Gardens, NY",111,64,2664,2.0,11/21/2011,"This particular location isn't the greatest when it comes to service.  I go to The Cheesecake Factory a lot and ALWAYS order the same thing, the same way.  I order the miso-glazed salmon with extra glaze on the side.  I was told I was going to be charged an extra $0.75 for the extra glaze because it's expensive.  What?!  Yeah, okay...  I travel for work and I've been to plenty of Cheesecake Factory locations and this is the ONLY one that said anything of that sort.  Weird.  The restaurant wasn't even busy and the food took a while to come out, too.  Next time, I'll go to a different location with better service and FREE glaze instead."
Susan Y.,"Lancaster, NY",20,182,3,4.0,11/1/2009,"My first experience here was not positive but ended with the Manager calling and apologizing for small portions and frozen french fries. Last night my partner and I went there before Halloween festivities.  He had the Chicken foscoccia sandwaich.  An impressive sandwich beautifully presented with plenty to take home.   My choice was a four cheese pasta, quite nice.  We had about a 15 minute wait and a server who was going to be leaving at the end of her shift made sure that we both had everything we needed before leaving for the day. We'll be back occasionally to be spoiled with good food and service."
Mark R.,"Toronto, Canada",2,14,13,4.0,8/10/2011,"Had a great burger and so did my wife.  Large serving, very tasty.  Very friendly server.  Ended up going  back again for lunch the next day."
Steve S.,"Toronto, Canada",2,17,,5.0,12/25/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory and as a Canadian was extra happy to see this one open in Buffalo. These restaurants are usually packed because there cheesecakes (and food overall) are by far the best ( buttery, not in flavour but in texture) that I have tried and I've tried all kinds of expensive cheesecake that have all been subpar compared to these. Their menu is huge and offers a wide range of options. I constantly find myself shaking my head at some of the negative reviews.. Because when you finally decide to go you'll see that they're wrong.Their cheesecakes are phenomenal and I know many people (American, Canadian, Brazilian) who love this restaurant. Their portions are very big, many times a good share for 2 people.. Everything I've tried at this restaurant has been great from fish to steak Diane to chicken etc. try the red velvet cake or Kahlua cheesecake .. Amazing and for those chocolate lovers be careful to not order 1 slice of Godiva cheesecake for yourself as it is extremely rich, better for sharing between 2 people."
WILLIAM S.,"East Otto, NY",0,9,,1.0,4/1/2011,"Highly overrated, staff doesn't have a clue how to treat customers.  I ordered Goulash and got Beef Stroganoff, a child's portion to boot. My complaint was answered with an "" I'm sorry, that's what we call Goulash"".  However my wife got a salad that would have fed the Buffalo Fire Department., We took most of it home and ate it with several more meals.  We'll never return, I can make an entire Stock Pot full of Goulash for what they charged for my child's portion of Stroganoff."
Maryanne D.,"Brampton, Canada",0,20,13,5.0,10/22/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! Yeah people complain about the wait time, but that's because it's good and people actually wanna eat here... I found that this one was not the best in terms of ambiance because it is fairly crowded, but I could care less because the food was awesome! I went with 4 others and every entre was sooooo good! The prices are fair $15-20 and the quantity is good. All their cheesecakes are really good! This time I got the pineapple upside down cake and ohhh it was gooooood! It was so different from the normal cheesecakes and the portion was big. I'll be there again sooon"
Da W.,"Somerville, MA",7,43,,1.0,7/26/2010,"My sister's boyfriend found half of a STAPLE in his appetizer, after waiting an hour for a table.   'nough said."
