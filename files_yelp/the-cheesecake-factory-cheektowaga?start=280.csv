Derrick C.,"Sacramento, CA",97,1246,126,3.0,3/27/2011,"One of the nicest Cheesecake Factories I've been to (reminded me more of a Grand Lux Cafe).  We had a little difficulty seating our large party but after a little pushing, we were able to add a table on the end despite the obvious disgust of the manager and patrons that were moved.  If it was going to be that big of a deal, we could've dealt w/ it otherwise instead of having it seem like such an inconvenience.  I would never have a problem w/ moving my seat for a larger party but I guess not everyone is me.  Our server on the other hand was extremely nice and deserves honorable mention despite her rude boss.  Food was good as always - huge portions for reasonable lunchtime prices.  I found it strange that the Mushroom burger only came w/ the patty + 4-5 slices of Shiitake while other burgers came w/ lettuce & tomato.  Our server hooked it up and though the mushrooms didn't seem like it would have any impact, they were really flavorful and the burger came out delicious."
Laura S.,"Amherst, NY",221,183,12,2.0,2/24/2009,"I survived the Cheesecake Factory at Walden Galleria Mall. I went with great trepidation (yes, I am dramatic but know what I like) before attending a play latst Friday evening. Service was efficient. The table to was too small to hold a mug of tea, bread basket and two salads. But I made do. The salad was fine, though it was stingy with the promised ingredients that made it $8.95: candied walnuts, beets (there were three diced-sized chunks), goat cheese and asparagus. The friend mac & cheese appetizer could have had more cheese flavor but the coating and light accompaniment of sauce were fine. I probably won't go again anytime soon but I no longer fear Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake, eaten the next day, was more like cake. Good stuff."

Grace H.,"Long Island City, NY",38,139,62,2.0,7/6/2008,"My brother and his friends have raved about this chain restaurant with excellent food and even better cheesecake.  Having high expectation as a first time customer I thought it wold be really good!  I was feeling like pasta for dinner and decided upon the jambalaya chicken and shrimp pasta dish.   Yikes!  It was oily!  I guess I didn't pick the best thing on the menu but I wasn't impressed with dinner.   The best part was the hot bread at the start of the meal.  Tasty, sweet and soft -perfect bread!"
Jin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,20,,3.0,7/10/2012,"Been to other cheesecake factories in New Jersey but since I live in Buffalo this it the only one up here, must say the cheesecake individual portions are a lot smaller than other cheesecake factories I have been to. Which is why I am giving it 3 stars because of the small cheesecake slices."
Chantal M.,"Scarborough, Canada",27,139,71,4.0,3/12/2010,"As I'm from Canada I can't make it to the cheesecake factory frequently but everytime I'm in the states I make it a point to visit. So far I've been there twice with no flaws. The first time I went there it was a weekday on lunch, me and my friend had no problem getting a table. I ordered the boston salad which was fabulous, at the end of it I was highly considering the waiter how they make they're dressing, it was creamy, garlicky and downright delicious. The only hitch of the entire meal was the iced tea (you get an option of sweetened or unsweetened), it was bitter but appears to be a U.S. thing, I've found this problem in other states as well. The second time I visited, it was verrrryyy busy. The first night we got there we tried to get a table on a friday night and it was an hour wait, we opted to eat at the hotel instead. However the next day we decided to try again for lunch. There was still a wait for a table so we opted to eat at the bar instead. The bartender was lovely and attended to our needs frequently without being asked. We got crab rolls for an appetizer, they were so great, the tarter sauce like dip was so yummy. I ordered the bacon, mushroom and swiss burger, with a side of salad. The burger was ginormous but so flavourful, the spread they put on was some sort of garlic spread and should be bottled as should their balsamic dressing. I wanted to lick the dressing out of the little gravy bowl it came in. Overall a great experience both times, go now!"
