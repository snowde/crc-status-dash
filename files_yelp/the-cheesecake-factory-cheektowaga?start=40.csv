Nabila I.,"Toronto, Canada",36,249,236,4.0,8/23/2016,"I've been in Buffalo a few times, but this was the first time I had ever been inside the much talked about Cheesecake Factory. I had no idea that they served actual food -- anything beyond cheesecake and dessert. I mean, the name is a bit misleading, no? But it's a full on restaurant inside! And it's busy! Honestly, you can't fault them for that. They serve amazing food. The service is pretty good. Sometimes they get overwhelmed by the number of customers they are serving, but in general it was pretty spot on. The food itself is incredible. You would think that a place known for a particular dish would serve you so-so food, right? WRONG! INCREDIBLE FOOD I TELL YOU! When we arrived, they were still serving lunch specials/portions. So I ordered the lunch portion of a Thai glazed salmon on a bed of brown rice. It was amazingggg. Everyone really enjoyed their various dinners and we all found them to be super filling. Most of us took lunch portions. As such, we got our cheesecakes to go! I ordered a slice of Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. I didn't eat it until coming home. It was delightful but definitely rich. I would only want it in small doses. I find the cheesecake menu a bit overwhelming, because they all sound a bit too rich. But this one was everything I wanted in a cheesecake with chocolate! Honestly, I'm looking forward to returning to Buffalo so that I can enjoy more of the food here."
Casey G.,"Buffalo, NY",1,5,,5.0,11/9/2017,"I come for every birthday or anniversary or just whenever I feel like having something really rich and delicious. The complimentary bread = amazing. All of their pasta dishes (my personal favorite being the 5-cheese) are so good! And all the cheesecakes are so rich. Definitely recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough, it's my favorite!  Until next time, see you soon Cheesecake Factory :p"
Summer S.,"Cheektowaga, NY",55,84,59,3.0,8/8/2017,"This restaurant is okay, it's not even my first pick in the mall. Nothing is made in house and it's always so busy even though there's nothing special about the food or the service. I do like their Parmesan crusted chicken and their Buffalo chicken strips, but I wouldn't recommend"
Ahad Q.,"Mississauga, Canada",64,146,37,3.0,11/20/2016,"I visited this place on my day escapade to Buffalo despite our falling Canadian Dollar. Needless to say, a lot of hype surrounds this place and my expectations were quite high.  As some reviewers have said, their food is lack lustre and sadly I didn't take any of that advice since I ordered an appetizer (Nachos with chicken) and boy was I disappointed!  The food was actually quite cold and flavourless and since my guest and I were too hungry, we sat there quietly and ate it.  As we were not really getting a good vibe from the food, we just ended up ordering some Cheesecake. I ordered the Anniversary Cheesecake and my friend ordered the Cookie Dough Cheesecake. If I were to be blunt, I would say that I wasn't THAT impressed at all, in fact I would say I have had better frozen Cheesecakes. Although this could be attributed to the fact that I ordered one of the ""non-popular"" Cheesecakes.   Needless to say, if you ever find yourself in Buffalo I'd still give this place a try for ""bragging rights"" and nothing more."
Bus J.,"Hamburg, NY",0,75,68,3.0,10/9/2017,It's ok.  It's over priced. And u wait forever.  I do have to say I like there black been burger. Tho. And there. Salads are very good.
Rony B.,"Vaughan, Canada",13,25,2,3.0,5/25/2017,"visited the place on the weekend and it was BUSY, the waiting time to be seated was about an hour even though I was said its 20 minutes wait.  The food is ok, dont eat too much leave some room for the main course of the place, the Cheesecake, its BIG so consider to share."
Phil F.,"Vaughan, Canada",56,93,188,3.0,7/31/2016,"How can we not visit the factory when in Buffalo!? The wait was surprisingly short. 15 minutes tops.  Wait staff was pleasant and helpful. We called her ""cool beans"" since she used that lingo with us.  We started with mushroom, avocado and zucchini fries. Great appetizer! Highly recommend. Not greasy. Tasty. Avocado does break apart easily so strap on a pair and use your hands! We then shared a chicken avocado club. It literally was exactly that. Bread (no taste and overly buttered), chicken (dry and tasteless) and avocado (fresh and plentiful).  Side of fries were good. No complaints at all.  We should have opted for cheesecake.  No we're regretting it. But we need to live our lives with no ragrets! What did we do!??!! Worth the wait and the experience. Clean, decent and different.  MUST TRY CHEESECAKE NEXT TIME. THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD AND FRESH. WHY DIDNT WE TRY A SLICE!!!???"
Victor C.,"Mississauga, Canada",0,20,4,4.0,12/3/2017,Came down around 9:30pm and figured the group of us wound grab a bite to eat.  To our amazement it was super busy with a 40 minute wait. Well we were not going to wait but I did grab a takeout order of mango lime key cheesecake.  The cheesecake was delicious with souch flavour.  The only complaint was that too.much sugar was used to make this cheesecake.
Alyssa W.,"Lake View, NY",0,5,3,4.0,2/17/2017,"I went here last night with my boyfriend and I had a very enjoyable experience. This is, obviously, a higher end place as far as prices go but I'd say WELL worth it. My mixed drink was awesome but 10.50.  The bill was $96. But I feel we got a lot. We got the Buffalo Bites appetizer which was HEAVENLY. two mixed drinks. Four beers. Pasta carbonara with chicken and chicken enchiladas. The staff was really busy which was understandable but they were extremely polite and sweet! I would DEFINITELY recommend this place! Love it and will be back."
Melinda A.,"Buffalo, NY",68,44,17,3.0,3/4/2017,"Food is what you would expect from a chain restaurant. To be honest I often question why I end up ordering a meal and not just get a cheesecake and coffee, but every time I end up ordering the Renee's Special: Half a Turkey Sandwich, Bowl of Soup, and Small Salad (I usually substitute this for a Caesar Salad for a $1.00 up charge). The turkey sandwich is good, nothing special, I truly think you could make your own at hope with a Kings Hawaiian roll, with turkey, tomato, and mayo on it. The bowl of soup is usually my favorite part of the meal, it always seems to be hot and fresh. The Caesar Salad like the Turkey Sandwich is good, but nothing to rave about.  But dessert is where The Cheesecake Factory shines, all of the cheesecakes are amazing but my personal favorites are the Red Velvet and the Tiramisu. And the good news if you fill up on a meal, or don't want wait a long wait for a table just for dessert, they have a take-out dessert counter with all their cheesecakes on display available for order. My advice would be if you just want the cheesecake, skip the meal and get a piece to go."
Aurora L.,"Buffalo, NY",52,95,191,3.0,3/5/2017,"How unfortunate my experience was today. I've been to The Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count on each hand, and I've never had a truly horrible experience, until today. Coming in on a Sunday, midday, I was excepting it to be busy, however only 5 minutes for two people! That's amazing. When getting a table, we were placed in that awkward bar section where the tables are right on top of each other; so close you can hear your neighbors conversation. We noticed the table next to us was becoming into a big table for a group, and this turned out to be a family of 6, where the mother kept yelling at everyone. Her mother and father ate all the appetizer while she stepped out, they wouldn't try something different so they had to get the boring option. Her daughter kept talking to her like she was the mother, and taking care of her toddler son, who kept banging things against the table, in which who she would raise her voice to.  It didn't end there with our bad experience. You cannot do anything about other parties, so we kindly kept to ourselves and enjoyed each other's company. Well, our waitress was one the worst ever. We must have waited 15 minutes to order, every time we needed a refill she was no where to be found, and not to mention every time we had a request, such as the straws she never brought to the table, or some extra ketchup, it was as if you were asking her to find a needle in a hay stack. The food was very good though; my bacon-bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriends mac and cheese burger were both cooked to perfection. We were so aggravated with our server, we took our Cheesecake to go, and it was even better at home then in house. Of course I'll come back, however if you're having a bad day, don't take it out in your clientele."
Sheryl L.,"Buffalo, NY",0,11,3,1.0,11/25/2017,"I was very disappointed, I placed a curbside to go order with specific instructions yet they completely screwed up my order, it took me 3 phone calls and 25 min to place order then try to Parkin a very busy day then pay far too much to have order screwed up plus cold and way over cooked! I called to complain yet Mgr Jason didn't care so I'm done with Cheesecake Factory I'll take my business elsewhere! I'll spend my hard earned money where it's appreciated!"
Bethel P.,"Markham, Canada",230,15,22,4.0,1/7/2017,"I always make the trip out here from Toronto to have some cheesecake and to shop at Walden.  As usual there was a 20+ min wait for a seat, as they do not take reservations. Mind you we were there on a Friday night during peak dinner hours.  Server was polite and mentioned the soup of the day to us.  My gf had the herb crusted salmon and I had the chicken Madeira + herb crusted salmon. The Factory combos (steak/shrimp/salmon/chicken) are my favourite. We also had the veggie fries as an appetizer.  Veggie fries - breaded and deep fried avocado/mushrooms/beans?/sweet potatoes. TBH kind of weird but i was attempting to be healthy. These items weren't meant to be fried so the centres were soggy. They came with 2 sauces, one garlic and the other chipotle. The sauces were delicious and made the veggie fries bearable. 2.5/5 Herb crusted salmon - gf said hers was dry and didn't finish the whole thing, while I found mine perfectly done. And it went very well with the lemon sauce that it came with. 3.5/5 Chicken Madeira - breaded chicken with cheese and mushrooms. Sauce went with the chicken very well and it was not dry at all. It also came with a potato mash that was just the right consistency and seasoned right. 3.5/5 CHEESECAKE: This is why we come anyways right? Banana cream - my favourite here and what I get every time. If you don't want something too heavy and chocolatey, this is for you. This was paired with slice bananas and whipped cream. The cheesecake had the perfect amount of banana flavour while not overpowering the cheese taste. The crust was so good as well, not sure what it was. 4.5/5 Tiramisu cheesecake - my bite had a strong coffee taste, almost to the point of bitterness, but my gf enjoyed it. 4/5"
Maria B.,"Toronto, Canada",6,4,,2.0,11/23/2017,"My friend & i decided to go here 2 days after it opened. We arrived at 12 noon & there was a long line-up just to get a pager. After 30 minutes of lining up, we were given a pager & was told to wait for 60-90 minutes. After an hour, our pager buzzed. We were excited to go in only to find out that our pager was defective & shouldn't have buzzed yet. Then we were told again to wait for another hour. WHAT????. We were told at first to wait for 60-90 minutes and after 60 minutes you're telling us that the pager is deffective & wait for another 60 minutes??? In the first place, why would you give out a DEFECTIVE pager??? Although we were so hungry, we still decided to wait. But telling us that the pager is defective after waiting for an hour  is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE.  Your customer service is NOT IMPRESSIVE!!!"
Rita J.,"Buffalo, NY",48,167,437,3.0,3/14/2017,"If I'm going to eat a chain, I'll take this place. It's perfect for my non foodie friends who don't like to venture ""downtown"" There is something for everyone on the menu. If you cant find something then you must not eat!  So...try a cocktail, they have a lot of those too! I like the skinny menu, good choices. This last visit tp start I had the a cup of cream of chicken soup  with artichokes, mushroom and roasted red pepper it was super good! For an shared appetizer-Thai lettuce wraps, my entree was the southwest chicken sandwich it was tasty but I could only eat not even a quarter of it. The portions are huge. This trip I had a cocktail and found that they make a great blood orange matini. Not sure how but I always manage to leave without having any cheesecake! Weird. I mean I'm at the actual factory of cheesecake!"
Angilee T.,"Rochester, NY",0,56,7,1.0,8/28/2017,"We ate here Saturday 8/26/17. My husband and I have never been here, and were celebrating our Anniversary. We got seated, and numerous servers that were working in our area we were seated in (including ours) just kept walking by without acknowledging us. We sat there for over 20 minutes, menus closed at the end of the table no hello nothing. My husband got up and asked a server if they knew who was waiting on us? The kid said oh let me find out, finally here she comes mind you she had walked by us numerous times with no I will be right with you, can I get you something to drink? NOTHING.... Now at this point, were pissed and starving, she didn't even apologize food was good but service sucked. And her personality sucked. Never again, and nor would I recommend it to anyone in the area either."
Stephanie F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",85,8,5,4.0,9/10/2017,Their cheesecake is absolutely delicious (obviously).  The menu has lots and lots of choices and I was happy to see a larger than normal healthy options menu.
E K.,"Toronto, Canada",8,202,723,5.0,8/16/2016,Came here for lunch the other day Pros Fast service  Professional  Great food Well priced  Patio Cons None that I can think of
Oleg S.,"East Amherst, NY",16,35,15,5.0,1/26/2017,"I really liked it here. When I first walked in I was amazed at how beautiful the actual place was. It is also pretty big. The only thing sometimes it is busy and you have to wait to be seated. We got crab cakes for the appetizer and it was very good. Then we got chicken Marsala, pasta, salmon, and pizza. (For my whole family) and everything was very good. Then of corse we got cheesecake! I recommend the salted caramel one it is delicious! So I definitely recommend this place cause it's full out fancy and delicious."
Dan G.,"Toronto, Canada",62,79,767,4.0,1/5/2016,"This is an average between 3 stars and 5 stars. I have experienced excellent service and excellent food as well as mediocre service and A-OK food. As this restaurant is really big, I guess it really depends on how lucky you are.  The food here is generally good. I visited with a friend a coupe of weeks ago and they even created a dish for him from scratch as he has some dietary restrictions.  The service, this is a different story and unfortunately impacts even the quality of the food. Like in any big place, not always the nicest servers, or the fastest... All in all I will return here and hope to be lucky. I will also avoid Friday evening and instead I would try lunch, they have a quite varied lunch menu."
