Edwin R.,"Jamestown, NY",105,165,345,3.0,1/14/2017,It's hard to go wrong with Cheesecake Factory but then again... it's hard to go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Nothing special or out of the ordinary here. The same food and the same overpriced cheesecakes. The wait time is usually horrid on the weekend.
Jaden K.,"Mississauga, Canada",30,53,130,5.0,10/30/2016,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory. The food is always delicious and the service is great. I had the chicken and biscuits which was delicious. My mom had the Cajun chicken tenders which were also great and my dad had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with fried Plantain, beans and rice. I highly recommend you ask your server for brown bread only it is so delicious! The white bread they serve with it is just average. Normally when we go we get the bigger portions and eat it mid day. We drive from Mississauga and don't normally eat dinner on our day trips so we just eat the food left over from lunch. When we leave we are normally so stuffed that we can't eat any cheesecake so getting a box to go is key!"
Randi J.,"Albion, NY",5,23,21,4.0,6/24/2017,"We have been here many, many times. I felt compelled to review today because our service was PHENOMENAL. When we came in with 2 toddlers the hostess staff was so friendly and even spoke to the kids. Our server, Garrett, was the best server we have had anywhere in a LONG time. He was personable, helpful, understanding! I apologized for the mess the kiddos made and he responded ""no worries, that's what I am here for"" (and sounded genuine). I didn't give 5 stars because I didn't love my meal. We had the shrimp summer rolls appetizer and that was amazing. I had the Mexican tortilla salad. It looked great and was a lot of food. The dressing was bitter for me. My kids had pizza and pasta and loved it and my husband had he seated tuna tataki salad and loved that."
Deborah L.,"Buffalo, NY",0,22,,2.0,11/15/2017,"Server was polite. Nachos took 20 minutes and was room temperature. Our salads came out 3 minutes later, even though we requested them to come out later. Menu not as good as in previous years. The beet salad has changed...doesn't have the farro, just arugula and a few nuts and too much vinegar for the dressing. The manager was very accommodating and took our complaints seriously."
A V.,"Toronto, Canada",38,203,656,3.0,2/20/2017,"Rating based on food bc I didn't dine in since it was about an hour wait for a table for two, and there were 71 people ahead of us =T so yeah! Ordering at the service counter was our best bet.  The only discrepancies I experienced were 3 - first they forgot to give us our drink, second they forgot to give us our 6-inch cake, and lastly the supervisor threw out my reciept when I gave it to him to verify my order which I actually needed. When I told him he did seem faulty, however no apology was issued.  I understand the chaos from the popularity that surrounds this vicinity, but I don't think it's an excuse to fuck up a paying customer's order.  Being it my first time here I did expect some hiccups during prime time, so I'm willing to give this place another chance when it's less saturated.  As for the food, I ordered a dulce de leche cheesecake, which was as soft as a cloud and pleasantly sweet. It's definitely a thick mixture so prepare yourself with a tall glass of water. You will need something to help the thickness of the cream go down. I also believe they include way too much whipped cream. I took 90% of it off =s"
Edward J.,"Toronto, Canada",50,235,2575,4.0,12/12/2015,"A new menu with many more varieties. There was plenty before. Now it's vastly improved. Best thing is, it includes my favourites!  Go early to avoid the line up. Don't worry about bring home dessert to Canada. Just declare that you're bringing a certain value of cheesecake and they'll either level some tax or just wave you through."
Jamie E.,"Burt, NY",541,176,1057,4.0,8/15/2015,"Ugh. Drool. Their food is kind of expensive, but my god. The cheesecake. Even if you just come for dessert. Time well spent. I always get the fried zucchini, too. It's the best and it's only like $5. The cheesecake is generally at least $7.95 a piece, but it's seriously so worth it.  The patio is great when it's nice out. If you're inside, make sure you ask for a booth unless you enjoy sitting on top of a strangers lap in a speed-dating style table set up. The service is generally quick and they are pretty friendly. Plus it's in the mall, so you can go see Magic Mike XXL for the 5th time in a week when you're done! X's and O's! J"
Kristie S.,"Canandaigua, NY",108,67,59,3.0,5/25/2017,"Our visit began on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We arrived around 1215 and waited 20 minutes for a table. The waitress was quite slow to respond to the table. Our food took a while to come out but the oddest thing was about 5 different servers were bringing food to our table and the two tables next to us that our waitress was responsible for. The one server tried giving us the wrong food. We had to wait a few minutes for all our dishes. Wish they would come out at the same time! However, food was delicious and portions were huge. I had the Skinnylicious Asian chicken salad which was huge but exhausting eating to much lettuce soaked in dressing, plus the big bites of cilantro were unwelcome. My stepfather enjoyed the lunch meatloaf and couldn't finish. My brother also took home half of his spicy chicken lunch pasta. My mother (whose birthday we were celebrating) loved the Kobe burger. The sweet potato fries were okay and our brown bread was burnt. I asked the waitress if they did anything for birthdays and was hesitant to say they did ice cream sundaes. My brother had to ask for the cheesecake menu. They did bring out some ice cream and sang which was fun. My mom took the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake home. I had a bite later on. It was a tad melty but nothing I would die to eat again. Not sure why their calorie-laden cheesecakes are so great? Nothing special, nothing awful. That's what you get at chain restaurants I guess. Mom was happy for his first visit ever so I can be happy too."
Stefanie E.,"Buffalo, NY",32,101,170,4.0,5/16/2017,"It's a cheesecake factory, I knew what we were getting into. Little bit crowded, little bit uncomfortable, little bit expensive, but that's okay! We stopped in for celebratory drinks and dinner, whoever made my blood orange margarita certainly put plenty of booze in it! Would love to try something else to see if it was just that recipe or if that's the style across the board. I was craving fish tacos on the way in and of course that's what I ordered; definitely exactly what I was craving! Their options are a little pricey but they do give you generous portions, the boyfriend and I both needed to go boxes! Of course the cheesecake is always phenomenal, never disappoints! Our waitress was lovely and attentive. Overall, I'll be coming back when I can afford to!"
Jerika A.,"New Brunswick, NJ",6,4,,5.0,2/23/2017,SO DELICIOUS! Aaron was awesome. Super attentive! The food came out on time and all so yummmy.
Skylar M.,"East Aurora, NY",54,214,174,4.0,7/31/2016,There's just something about the Cheesecake Factory. Always get the lunch size salads unless you like left overs. The avocado egg rolls are my favorite thing on this earth. Expect to wait as it's always packed at the Galleria. Love the BBQ chicken salad as well as the chopped.  What I absolutely hate is sitting in the rows where it's like you're eating dinner with strangers. Literally. It's one step away from community style seating.  You can always grab your own table at the high top bar tables and skip the wait if one is open.
Jen E.,"Buffalo, NY",37,109,137,4.0,1/27/2017,"Huge menu, good food, nice and fun decor, but damn they always have a line, so I hardly ever go here. Their nachos reminded me of the ones I got on an all inclusive vacation, which is a good thing! Yum!"
Tajinder P.,"Vaughan, Canada",49,96,65,4.0,9/19/2016,It was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory. When me and my cousins were in Buffalo we decided to stop by. As we got there we just wanted to get dessert. We got Red Velvet Cheesecake and Original Strawberry Cheesecake. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was very tasty but the portion of the cake was way too much for one person. For next time I would get one and split it with me and my cousin. But the original Strawberry Cheesecake was delicious. Best cheesecake spot in town!!
Jahaira B.,"Scarborough, Canada",51,277,1707,3.0,10/5/2015,This restaurant is huge and gaudy looking.  It looks like  I am in Vegas  when I'm in here.  It's located at  the Walden Galleria. For takeouts they have a separate counter. There can be a bit of a line of about 5 or 6 people or sometimes more. Call in ahead and order if you can. Got the avocado rolls as take away. Didnt find them tasty. BJ's avocado rolls are better.
Susan S.,"New York, NY",489,106,337,3.0,5/13/2015,"The appearance of the restaurant is awesome. It's definitely unique and I feel like you can still casually dine in here without having to dress up too much.  The menu is extremely lengthy. There are a lot of options, but honestly if you're here, you have to try out one of their cakes!!! My favorite is the mango key lime cheesecake. I swear I come back for that every time.  The only dishes I've tried from here are the fish tacos, avocado spring roll, and shepherd's pie. The food is mediocre. It's not anything special, but the avocado spring rolls are pretty good if you're thinking of ordering some appetizers! I like how they give you some bread to fill up your stomach while you're waiting for the food to arrive but honestly, I wouldn't come here with the intention to get food because I don't think their food is anything special and the service is SUPER SLOW, so you'll end up waiting quite awhile for your entrées but you have to get dessert from here!!!!"
Dottie A.,"Tonawanda, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/25/2017,"I have visited many Cheesecake Factory locations in many states and have visited this Cheekowaga location many times. Today's visit was the worst experience I've ever had.  I met a friend for dinner and was seated after a short wait. We were seated in the bar area in a corner booth..  We waited 12 minutes before our server even acknowledged us. When he did acknowledged us he said I'll be back to get your drink order.. 8 minutes later he took our drink order.  He brought our drinks with no straws.  6 minutes later he came to take our order..We asked for straws, he left and 5 min later the straws arrived.  He took our order.. We asked for bread.. The bread came but no butter.. We also didn't have any napkins... We waited 25 minutes for our food.. The manager came over to tell us it would be a few min. The food came, our server never asked us if we wanted drink refills.. We finally flagged him down to bring us our check, 10 min later we brought the check.  WRONG check!!  Ugh we flagged him down AGAIN.. He asked if there was anything else he can do .. We said how about a desert to share for all the aggravation, he said my manager can't do that.. I used the ladies room before we left.. It was filthy..the floors were wet, toilet paper all over the floor, two stalls were out of toilet paper.. I mentioned to the girl at the front desk that the ladies room needed attention, As I walked away I heard her snicker.. What happen to this place???  There are way too many restaurants in this area that would appreciate our business.  We will not go back"
Suzanne M.,"Barrie, Canada",0,76,,5.0,5/15/2017,"Visited The Cheesecake Factory on May 13 with my 2 daughters. We decided to try to beat the dinner rush so checked in and got our buzzer about 4:10.  Hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait  and it was. We just hung out on the benches in the hall and people watched. We were seated in a booth at the back of the restaurant. Service was immediate and impeccable. We ordered drinks and decided to just have some appetizers to share. We had the mushroom caps, zucchini sticks,avocado egg rolls and quesadilla. All arrived piping hot and all together.  No complaints about the food at all. We ordered 2 slices of cheesecake to go, hard to decide what kind to get with so many choices! We settled on S'mores and Peanut Butter Cup. They were yummy and super sweet. The entire bill with tip was $65. I felt that was good value. The Cheesecake Factory is just a fun place to eat !"
Francis C.,"Buffalo, NY",38,185,116,4.0,9/7/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those massive chains that can be found all over the US, and I mean that in a good way.  Their menu is time tested and all of their dishes are delicious.  The staff is always attentive and work to ensure that your order is complete and accurate.   While the dishes may be a tad pricy, the portions are very generous.  I usually am only able to eat half of my meal and bring the other half home. Definitely a safe choice if you can't decide on a specific place to eat."
Linda D.,"Buffalo, NY",23,5,,5.0,4/27/2017,"Love this place. Always get Steak Diane, I am never disappointed.  Burgers are awesome too. Excellent service too."
Gale B.,"Boardman, OH",3,18,8,5.0,4/22/2017,Came here for desert one night after dinner. I had the red velvet cheesecake and my boyfriend had the fudge and peanut butter cheesecake- both pieces of cheesecake were enormous and delicious. Service was friendly and quick. Overall great experience. Will be back next time I am in the area.
