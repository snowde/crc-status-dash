S S.,"Buffalo, NY",0,3,,4.0,4/16/2017,"Food was very tasty, especially the cheesecake. Lived up to the hype. 4 out of 5. Service was pretty good.  Trainee was still learning. His superiors were attentive and polite, but slow because busy. 3 out of 5. Wait was super long, over an hour, with minimal seating.  1 out of 5. Ambiance was pleasant. 4 out of 5. I will definitely return, perhaps for a special occasion.  Definitely can't indulge like that very regularly."
Nidhi S.,"Buffalo, NY",53,118,294,3.0,9/2/2015,This is amazing place for cakes and pastries..  Food: Okay Ambience: is great.  Price: Expensive
Zhenni L.,"Buffalo, NY",71,67,88,5.0,1/25/2016,"Absolutely love everything about this place. From the service to their food! The atmosphere is perfect for a celebration. Our waiter didn't rush us and was extremely friendly from beginning to end. We started out with drinks, which were presented beautifully. The drinks were the perfect mix. Not too alcoholic to the point where it feels like we're taking shots. Loved it ! Our entrees were delicious. I had the steak diane. Everyone has to try it ! Came with medallions, perfectly whipped mashed potatoes, and a rich mushroom wine sauce. I had a sample of all my friends' foods, which were nothing less than I imagined. Superb !  Had their cheesecake for dessert but that doesn't need explaining. It's self explanatory. They're best known for the cheesecakes."
Kyle L.,"Thornhill, Thornhill, Canada",0,6,9,5.0,3/14/2017,Always drop by this restaurant for lunch when traveling to US. The pasta and crispy crab bites are always my favorite.
Melody G.,"McMinnville, TN",1,1,,4.0,9/7/2016,"Pros: the food here is absolutely amazing. My favorite is the avocado egg rolls. I love the variety of cheesecake to choose from. Our server was tentative.  Cons: the girl that was helping take names upon arrival was rude. The system for seating guests, especially those that have to wait, definitely needs improvement in method and attitude!"
Brandi B.,"Frederick, MD",35,115,80,5.0,10/24/2016,"We had a fairly large party, and got there around 12:30 on a Sunday. We were seated almost immediately. This location is very clean. Our server was quick and very friendly, she didn't even bat an eye when my kids kept changing their drink order.  The food is simply delicious.  The fried Mac-n-Cheese balls are amazing. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my favorite! Definitely recommend stopped here for a bite to eat when in the area."
Jennifer K.,"Markham, Canada",114,5884,49859,2.0,11/14/2014,"This might be the last time I set foot in this Cheesecake Factory or even another location. Came by for a late dinner and the restaurant was empty. I was just glad that I did not have to wait. I still don't understand why I have to wait to eat here or other CF ever?! We shared: Boston Salad ($8.95) and Pasta Carbonara ($16.95) both prepared and put together without any ""cooking"" techniques. Maybe I should not expect someone that really knows how to cook to work in a CF?  My salad was a disaster as it was full of blue cheese. Pasta though prepared al dente but the sauce was so watery and it was more like a soup?! But at least the Pumpkin Cheesecake ($7.95) was smooth and delicious! The only saving grace for my dinner experience. Bye Cheesecake Factory! At least I outgrown this tourist trap!"
Stephanie C.,"Buffalo, NY",54,49,78,5.0,8/20/2016,"I love this location. They are smack-dab in the center of many other gourmet restaurants at this Galleria mall, but you honestly pick this restaurant for the unique & healthier menu choices. As a lover of avocado and vegan dishes, their menu has so many variants that I can frequent the take-out option and never feel as though the flavors are too similar. Their curbside pick-up option when ordering to-go is one of the only reasons why I will drive here multiple times in a week. It is so fast, convenient, and does not make the service any less than stellar. Every time I call over the phone I get exceptional attention to detail from each employee. After calling again to alert them you have arrived, you pull up to the restaurant-front to get your meal, & you are greeted within minutes. It is the best alternative to grabbing something for dinner at any other chain that may leave you with only greasy, meaty options. Thank you, Cheesecake Factory, for not only focusing on your incredible namesake of dessert options, but also healthier, lighter dinners for other patrons."
Jessica B.,"Chicago, IL",108,5,1,2.0,3/3/2017,"Service was very slow, took forever for our food to come out. When our food finally arrived the meatballs in my boyfriends spaghetti were raw inside. The second time the food came out they were still barely cooked all the way."
Mia B.,"Champaign, IL",44,72,186,4.0,10/12/2015,"One of the best happy hours in the businesses.  The dronks are great!  The food is plentiful and atmosphere is romantic. My favs on the menu is  down the maccaroni and cheese balls!  Large, juicy, cheesy, and crispy. Oh so good.  It is literally my staple every time i come and for the fact that i have tried to make it multiple times at home and failed miserably :( Next the buffalo blast....How do do you make something so crispy on the outside and moist on the inside??  However they do it, again AMAZING! We decided to order something new and the crab bites, they were also AMAZING! I absolutely love cheese cakes happy hour and i forgot to mention the fact that everything(including drinks) are under 6.50!"
Alisha C.,"Buffalo, NY",109,327,849,3.0,11/26/2015,"I tried this place out a few times. I have to say, I was not impressed with the 1st visit. I'll start by saying that I DID like the ambiance. As the daylight changes outside, so does the lighting inside of the Cheesecake Factory. Very neat. I did not like the seating arrangement there. They were sort of directly connected to the customers next to us which made it ""too close for comfort"" Unless you have a booth or individual table, that's the seating that you will be given. Now to the food....I asked the waitress what she recommended and I was pointed to the Jambalaya pasta dish. She said it was a customer favorite. So I ordered it and was less than impressed. I did give this place a 2nd chance and tried just a turkey club sandwich, and again, not too impressed. When in the area, this would not be my 1st choice by a long shot!"
Kunjané L.,"Buffalo, NY",27,61,242,4.0,2/18/2016,"We didn't have to wait long at all, the waitress was very pleasant and the food and drinks were wonderful!"
C T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,14,,3.0,9/8/2016,I've been going to this place for many years and for some strange reason my children do not like the taste of the cheesecake anymore . I noticed the change in the Taste of the red velvet and the low carb cheesecake . We will come back again one more time
Evan O.,"Buffalo, NY",19,56,64,2.0,6/15/2016,"I got the hibachi steak that was served with smashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. I ordered my steak medium rare and that's what I got and it was tasty. I wasn't however impressed with the sides. The asparagus was doughy instead of the light batter that usually is associated w tempura, and the potatoes weren't as creamy as I remembered. I order the zucchini fries as a app, I just wish they were crispier. Our service was good and our server was attentive."
Markeita B.,"Buffalo, NY",13,144,84,5.0,7/29/2015,"Today was national cheesecake day so my husband and I went to the ONLY place I would ever eat a slice of cheesecake from.....The Cheesecake Factory (duh) they have a new flavor so you know I had to try it, plus its becoming my new favorite flavor Salted Carmel! !!!! OMG....doesn't it sound like it tastes good? ?? Well it was, honestly it didn't seem overly sweet it was just perfect. And my husband of course played it safe as always red velvet.  The only thing I hate about national cheesecake day is they make you eat in, but its ok to just go out for desert sometime."
Nicole T.,"Markham, Canada",76,132,68,3.0,6/28/2015,"Visited Walden Galleria for a shopping trip and stopped into the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. My friend had a burger with mushroom & swiss, and I had the shrimp & sausage pasta. The food was very mediocre. Nothing too amazing.. at least it wasn't expensive (about $12-13 each).  Now, the cheesecake.. we got 2 slices of cheesecake to try- Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. The cheesecakes are SO GOOD!! The Oreo one is very very heavy, and when you eat it you really feel like you are indulging. Thick layers of chocolate in every bite. The Banana Cream is a nice contrast to go with it since it is so light and fluffy. Personally, I like the banana cream one more. If I were to come back, I'd pass on the meal and just get a slice of cheesecake to go."
Linda L.,"Toronto, Canada",590,280,893,4.0,8/19/2015,"Came to try this place out because a friend of mine said a character from the Big Bang Theory worked here. We tried 4 cheesecakes here: Original, Godiva, Mango and Keylime, and Strawberry. Each piece of cheesecake is pretty thick, enough to sarisfy your craving for sweets."
Bob G.,"Lakeview, Canada",14,5,,5.0,2/13/2017,"Amazing prices. Amazing food, HUGE portions. I don't even like cheesecake but LOVE there's!"
Gale M.,"Tonawanda, NY",26,14,26,4.0,4/29/2016,"Well, I truly didn't want to love this place...it's a chain, it's commercial, but I had the Kobe Burger and fell in love! Honestly, the best burger I've had in a while. I ordered it Medium and it came cooked to perfection, covered in onions and mushrooms... I couldn't carry on a conversation, it was so good. My companion had a chicken salad sandwich and salad; he thought it was just ok. Normally I would have asked for a taste but I could not put my burger down. Just thinking about it now, I will have to go back... It's becoming an obsession! We, of course, had cheesecake and coffee for dessert...he had the original and I had salted Carmel...There is nothing as complete as cheesecake and coffee. What am I going to do? It could become a problem just working though that list of cheesecakes..."
Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867,4.0,6/20/2014,"Being from Toronto this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to town.  The thing about the Cheesecake Factory is if you've been to one, you've pretty much been to all of them because they have a standard and reputation they have to live up to. I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and I've been to the Buffalo location at least 4 times I think.  I've been to others such as Marina Del Rey, Pasadena, LA - The Grove, Aventura, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Jacksonville, Tyson's Corner off the top of my head and the one thing they have is that their standard across the board when it comes to the quality of their food. If you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory I think you need to believe the hype.  Their menu is a book.  Mind you half the pages are adds the thing is pretty much a 20+ page listing of craziness.  They do chicken something close to a dozen ways or more because it's so easy to lose count. Recently my favorite dish has been the hibachi steak.  It's basically a sweet soy medallion type steak pieces with onions and tempura asparagus with mash potatoes that have a hint of wasabi butter. My favorite cheese cake is the key lime pie cheesecake... they have so many rich cheesecakes to choose from you're bound to find one you will like.   Upon entry of the restaurant you can marvel at the deserts at the take out area where you can get up close and have a peek at what they look like.  You can order whole ones if they have them for take home as well. Basically the servings are huge, everything is large so mind the bread that comes early and if you're going to dare get an appetizer, share it because you're most likely going to be full with your main course and not have enough room for desert.  Remember you can always doggie bag your food so save room! There are so many items that are good that I remember having and some are no longer on the vast menu.  Another great item that comes to mind is the bang bang chicken... As far as chains go this is one of the better ones and they absolutely should come to Toronto and Canada in general.  Of course it would most likely be more expensive in Canada but many things are... I know most Cheesecake Factories do not take reservations on weekends but I think they do for particular holidays.  You're best to ask your local restaurant."
