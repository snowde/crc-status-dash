Ray D.,"Audubon, NJ",6,13,13,4.0,12/3/2017,"I was here last night on a Saturday in December during holiday shopping season. As expected, there was a long wait, but we were seated before the estimated wait time. The hostess and server were very friendly. The food came out much quicker than anticipated given the hectic conditions. The menu is a little crazy considering the types of food they offer. I don't know what you'd consider their ""specialty"". I got the Spicy Cashew Chicken and it was tasty, so that's all that matters!"
Prashasti A.,"Philadelphia, PA",152,95,107,1.0,1/7/2018,"Yikes! My family comes to the Cheesecake Factory frequently but each visit has slowly decreased our appetite for the restaurant. The menu changes frequently, each time cutting more and more vegetarian options.  We went for a late lunch and alas, there was a wait. We expected as much.  After being seated, our server came out with water for the table but no straws. I had to actually ask for straws? (Question mark for the incredulous tone of the statement) We were waiting on two more people, so I had asked for the appetizers to be brought out when everyone had arrived but he replied that we would have to wait until everyone was here to order them or we could order them now and he would bring it out when it was ready. I don't think our request was too complicated but still, unfulfilled. After the rest of the group arrived, we ordered out meals.  Because the menu had changed since our last visit, my parents asked for the vegetarian dishes (my mom's favorite falafel salad was cut), and he said they had 3 vegetarian dishes. Now, I don't claim to know the entire menu at the CF but I know for a fact that they have more than 3 vegetarian meals. What's up with that? She decided to order the tomato basil pasta, the vegetarian version. Also, please note that this was an entire conversation, and not a simple Q & A. Our server knows very well that my parents do not eat meat. After some time, he brings the food to the table and doesn't even notice the empty waters. Once again, we had to ask for more water???  Lo and behold, the tomato basil pasta my mother ordered has chicken in it. We flag him down and ask is this chicken? He says yes. He then proceeds to ask if it's ok that the kitchen remove the chicken and bring the same food back. Personally, I was offended that this even happened in the first place. But then he has the audacity to ask if she wants the same meal, minus the chicken? WTF? It would be one thing if she had asked for the tomato basil pasta without chicken but after the conversation where they asked him for a vegetarian menu and whatnot, it was absolutely unacceptable, and he did not even seem apologetic. Honestly, it feels like he was trying to spite us or something because nothing made sense. I know for a fact that this was the Final visit to the Cheesecake factory."
Matthew B.,"Monmouth Junction, South Brunswick Township, NJ",1,5,11,5.0,11/19/2017,"Great place to catch up with old friends and split lots of different types of food.  It is avrry busy restaurant so it may be best not to go during prime time.  But you have the ability to walk around Barnes and Nobles and the signal still reaches.  First off, the service was great.  They were kind and considerate.  The server recommended their favorites and they were all great suggestions.  They were capable of answering questions about their extensive menu. Many of the pastas are great choices, but read the description to make sure you enjoy what it contains.  I would recommend the cauliflower apitizer, it will surprise you in both bold taste and melt in your mouth texture.  I would not recommend the cheeseburgers for those who do not like greesy burgers.  The cheesecake is fine, but can be overwhelmingly sweet.  Recommended to share a slice. The pricing is a little high, but to be expected for the location and food portions."
Allison K.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",0,8,11,5.0,1/1/2018,Great exterior. As well as restaurant. Service could be better with the food coming out waiting times. But The Cheesecake Factory is one of my go too's. Awesome food place. I love their Strawberry Lemonade as well.
Dwayne F.,"Jamesburg, NJ",8,151,411,4.0,12/19/2017,"Just stopped by for some dessert and slices of cheesecake to take home.  Its nice to have this location on the way home from Philly.   I love the place, its one of my favorite restaurants."
TiQueen L.,"North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA",35,1,1,4.0,1/6/2018,"Always a little wait when going to this location, but nothing major. One of my favorite restaurants. Food is always awesome! My go to is the chicken Little's or buffalo blast as an appetizer. The Tex mex egg rolls are also good as an appetizer. Overall, I never have any complaints with The Cheesecake Factory !"
Stormy W.,"Evesham Township, NJ",18,9,1,3.0,1/6/2018,"It took forty five minutes to get our food, my daughter's tacos were cold, and my husband's fries were cold. The lemonade apparently was very good though. My baked potato soup was just average. The waitress was good."
Bob H.,"Byberry, Philadelphia, PA",50,446,527,4.0,6/17/2017,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory. It's one of the few chains I will eat at. We were here this past Thursday for an early dinner. I like this location. The server was extremely pleasant and helpful. We started with the crab cakes and the mozzarella wedges. The crab cakes were delicious and packed with crab meat, I actually bit into a shell. The mozzarella was just as good. Very fresh and not your typical fried junk. For entrees we went with the chipotle chicken sandwich and the turkey burger. Often turkey burgers are dry, not this one. The burger was amazing! Moist and flavorful, I did seek a bit of spice. The chicken sandwich was also very good but it was very very large and heavy. The chicken was a bit on the greasy side but hey it's fried chicken. The buns on both were perfectly toasted. We opted for salad instead of fries. The citrus dressing is to die for!  We will be back! 4 stars.."
Mal S.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,28,16,4.0,6/26/2017,"4 stars for the apps and service. 1 star for the ""Sheppard's pie"". It's not even a pie. Sheppard is supposed to be the sheep not ground beef. It's just beef stew and mashed potatoes on top. It was greasy and the flavor was not good. I just ate the mash potato cause I love mash potatoes but the meat was not the correct meat. Why are they advertising shepherds pie if you're gonna get this trash. It ruined my meal and I left very disappointed.  Don't get this trash food. Cheesecake Factory has very delicious food and the service is excellent so I'm not bashing the company on why it's bad, I'm just ranting on this dish."
Mary T.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,8,5,2.0,9/26/2017,"I really went back and forth with myself over writing this review, but I feel obligated to forewarn other guests. My friend and I stopped here for a late dinner after work on Sunday, and it wasn't as busy as it usually is when I go. We had a wait of barely 5 minutes, and were sat in a little corner.  I totally understand that servers work for tips, and sometimes it's hard not to judge people based on appearance, but this is probably the first time that I've felt that what I was wearing significantly effected the quality of my service. Mistake number one, was wearing jeans and a T-shirt. I felt like we were stashed in a corner to not take away from the overall vibe of little dates and dinner gatherings that were going on around us.  Our server brought us out two waters and greeted us, ran down dinner and drink specials and asked if we'd like to put in an appetizer or get anything else to drink. In retrospect, this was where we made mistake number two. My friend decided to just go with water, no alcohol to bump up the tab, and told him she was gong to have an appetizer as her entree. We asked for a few more minutes, as I hadn't decided on a dinner yet. This was the turning point of our visit.  The soda that I ordered took about 20 minutes to come out, when he then asked if we'd like bread while we wait. The bread took another 10-ish minutes, and the meal came almost immediately afterwards. No inquiry about a refill on any drinks, and we didn't personally have his attention after the food was dropped for about another 45 minutes. However, he was gushing over the table seated immediately next to us, who appeared to be on a date. They ordered alcohol, appetizers, meals and were dressed very nicely. He stopped two or three times to have full 3-5 minute conversations with them, while totally ignoring us. No three bite check in, no refills, nothing. He was consistently present and attentive to his other tables, just not us.  Maybe he thought we were a couple and didn't like that? Maybe the casual, young adult in jeans and a messy bun appearance causes unintentional judgement because we look like we don't tip well? Maybe our not ordering $100 worth of food made him feel as though we were a waste of time? In reality, we were saving room for the $50 in cheesecake that we wound up ordering at the take away counter, because two hours for a quick meal was too long to be there already, and if we didn't ask for the check when we did, who knows when we would have seen him again. We didn't drive 30 minutes to this establishment to be treated worse than a minimum wage fast food worker would have treated us. On top of everything else the bathroom was a disaster. Do better, Cheesecake Factory. This was such a disappointment. We won't be back."
Russ H.,"Philadelphia, PA",158,49,40,4.0,6/20/2017,"Who writes a review about a chain restaurant? Me that who. Graduation season is upon us so the wait was a little long but hey how can you be mad.  I skipped the app and ordered the Crispy Chicken and Shrimp in a sweet and sour sauce. It had mushrooms,scallions, snow peas and cilantro. Other than too much breading on the chicken the dish was very  good. They offer a sautéed option for those that don't want fried. Recommend"
Robert O.,"Millville, NJ",53,577,284,3.0,9/10/2017,"There's nothing wrong with this place, but I am not a Cheesecake Factory fan. My daughter and I had dined in one in Baltimore a couple years back.  We were totally unimpressed.  My wife has wanted to go, but after our review, she's been a bit gun-shy.  We visited here when we realized we were kind of trapped in the area for some time and were hungry.   The menu in this place is entirely too large.  There is no reason to have so many selections.  This tells me they want to cater to everyone, but excel at none.  And that pretty much sums this place up. This was a better experience than the Baltimore store, but the food is very generic and nothing I would ever say, ""Hey, you have to have this dish.""  You can visit and find something that isn't horrible and overpay for it.  Other than that, I'll pass from now on."
Shaun E.,"Philadelphia, PA",129,113,46,3.0,8/20/2017,"Why am I reviewing this place? Because I need to pump up my reviews. Why are you reading this? Either your sitting in Cheesecake Factory and waiting for your waitress or you're really interested in someone's opinion who you really don't care about. Either way thanks for reading! Stopped by on Saturday around 10:30pm. There was no wait. We got sat immediately. There was a big woman sitting by herself on her phone. To the left of us and a couple making out at the bar. A no name boxing match was on. I will reveal who won the fight (4 time welterweight champion vs some guy, spoiler alert someone got knocked out round 3).  We got drinks. I got a smashing whiskey something. It was delicious. My wife got a blue moon. Drinks came out very quickly. We skipped appetizers and went right in for the kill. Unfortunately even with no crowd the wait time for our food was 30+ minutes. Do not go here if you are in a rush.  I got the steak Diane and chicken medeina which is apparently their favorite dish as a combo. My wife got the chicken parm pizza lol. The calories weren't listed because in sure listing a 3500 calorie bomb should be illegal. Mine was good. Steak was perfectly cooked and the chicken was moist. I like the cheese on top. When the mashed potatoes with the skin were to die for. The waitress never asked if we wanted a second drink. Oh well her loss! When we finished I couldn't find my waitress. We waited another 20 minutes before she emerged. I asked for a check and a box for the remaining 2/3 of the chicken parm pizza (which was essentially a huge patty of chicken covered in pizza sauce with some noods on top).  She asked if we wanted dessert and oh yeah we're at the Cheesecake Factory! I ordered the classic with the cherry preserves with some ice cream. It came out with two dollops of whipped cream! I totally forgot! Too much cream. I'm lactose intolerant. I would regret this choice.  Bill came out to $68. Not bad. If we didn't order drinks we'd have been okay. At least we shared dessert! Still working off those calories. The waitress took another 10 minutes to come over after we finished dessert. She immediately got the check then walked away (should've waited the 3 seconds for me to give her my cc) 20 minutes go by and I finally see her chatting up another waiter. I literally need to waive the check bill in the air to flag her down before she realizes I'm ready.  We leave by 12:10am. Could've been done in 30 minutes but I could never find the waitress. That is why they get a 3 star rating rather than 5. Other times they have been way quicker. The boxer won by knockout in the first 3 rounds. He essentially won before our food came out! Also when we left the big lady was still texting with her empty plates in front of her! Must've been one intense text sesh."
Ritesh M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,17,46,4.0,12/10/2017,"One of the better restaurant chains in the United States of A. Expansive menu, elegant decor and consistency in taste, quality and experience. Highly recommend their appetizers, cheesecakes and specialty dishes - chicken Madeira, bang bang chicken and shrimp, chipotle chicken pasta amongst a few."
Mark D.,"Vineland, NJ",0,29,7,4.0,11/5/2017,"After standing for over 1 hour for a table and people that came in after us were able to sit, we finally got a table. The air was blow straight down on us on one side.  As for the meal we got wings, nachos,  and burgers which were all good. Cheesecake was very good also. Just wont be back for the long wait."
Joan A.,"Clementon, NJ",3,22,4,5.0,10/9/2017,Delicious food of course great service I had spaghetti nothing like the one I make.Good drinks  Must try the original cheese cake they have  A little pricey but well worth it
Asif A.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,22,42,5.0,10/14/2017,"A Saturday dinner with family, surprise seating times by 25 min . Service by nice server she bring drinks and fresh breads with butter very fast.  Ahi Tuna with Wasabi butter sauce taste amazing , 100% love it . My family ordered different food. They also like it and we have no more room for Cheesecake. Maybe next time come here only for cheesecake. Nice place for dinner."
A D.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",2,22,11,4.0,7/14/2017,"I come here a lot. Also have been since I was little. Love all their pastas.(They always make my day.) Their cheesecake is MINDBLOWING!!! Their little 'Happy Birthday' song is nice too. I personally thought the service was ok. It depends on what and time you go though. Same as with the way the place looks.  Overall I always enjoy myself here. So, I'all be back soon!"
Julio C.,"Juniata, Philadelphia, PA",106,73,130,5.0,11/26/2017,"excellent execution for all three entrees ordered ! the bacon cheeseburger, the chicken and shrimp gumbo and the huevos rancheros !!!!!!cant go wromg with anything on their menu! the gumbo sautee was perfectly cooked moist tender pieces of chicken and shrimp they too were moist and cooked perfectly."
Austin L.,"Philadelphia, PA",138,55,123,5.0,6/10/2017,"PARKING: Free parking lot outside!! Came here with 11 other friends(not including me) for a surprise birthday dinner after coming from skyzone... so yes expect this review to be more about if me and my friends were filled up! We had balloons which were '18' that we wanted to put on the birthday girl's seat and the employees were very nice about it. We were a big group so I was a little hesitant if one waiter will be able to handle all of us. Starting off with the beverages... I got the Iced Mango Drink($6.50) THIS DRINK IS A MUST HAVE... 10STARS FOR THIS DRINK!! The waiter then proceeded to get the rest of my friends their drinks and their UNLIMITED free bread with butter. Not sure the exact names of the bread but some are white and some are brown. The BROWN ones are the best in my opinion!! Always a fight to see who get the brown one. The wait time was 20-30minutes but it was expected as we were a large group but the unlimited bread complemented the wait time with jokes and story telling between my friends.  The food all came out at the same time which was good because no one wants their food to get cold while waiting for their friend to get their meal. For the main dish I got the Shrimp Bistro($18.50) with shredded cheese on top. AMAZING.... usually people look for the shrimp taste but I rather eat the pasta without the shrimp. The pasta was soooooo creamy and delightful. This has to be the BEST pasta I have every tasted in my entire life. After we finished, the employees sang happy birthday to the birthday girl and handed a Cheesecake to her.  The food did fill me and my friends up... I had to take the left over pasta home. Another plus about this place was the waiter split the check between 12people... they have some amazing employees at The Cheesecake Factory. HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone and highly recommend the Iced Mango drink and Shrimp Bistro to everyone!! I will be back to this place with friends and family members next time!"
Frank B.,"Fairfax, VA",0,4,,3.0,9/14/2017,"It was a busy Saturday night so I understand that things will be busy and chaotic.  After an expected 30 minute wait for a table, I ordered the classic bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Being a busy night, it took almost an hour for the food to arrive...but I again understand.  The problem was, my chicken and shrimp arrived SANS chicken!  It was pretty obvious too since the plate consisted of a mound of rice with a few shrimp and sauce.  It was clearly half the normal portion. After letting the waitress know, she was very friendly and offered to correct the issue.  Apparently though, my order went to the very back of the line again since it took about another 45 minutes before I received my corrected order.  By the time I got my food, the rest of my party was finished eating and ready to go.  So let's hope the food tastes okay reheated since my dinner out involved picking scraps of food from the rest of my party.   The manager did come by to say ""Sorry about how long it's taking.  The kitchen is very busy tonight"".  While I don't expect the manager to give free food because mistakes do happen...but ANYTHING, even an appetizer or more bread would have been nice...rather than begging for leftovers from my companions.  The scraps of food I had were tasty though and our waitress was very friendly.   Manager definitely could have handled the situation better considering after around two hours waiting, I never did get to eat what I ordered. Update:  While my experience with this location was lackluster...I have to say that Cheesecake Factory corporate did an excellent job.  The Guest Relations Department with corporate read my review and contacted me right away.  They apologized and asked for additional details to allow them to investigate the problem to prevent such occurrences from happening to others.  The fact that they actually read online reviews and address potential issues is impressive."
Patty V.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",8,105,130,4.0,6/17/2016,"We always enjoy our visits to the Cheesecake Factory, but I will admit we have to be in a certain frame of mind for it.  It's a very busy, loud, noisy, crowded place and frankly, the noise and chaos grate on our nerves and gives us indigestion.  As others have mentioned, if you go at prime meal times, there is almost always a wait.  This restaurant is steadily busy ALL the time, even on off hours, although on off hours you might not have a long wait.  They don't take reservations, either, which is a pain. On the plus side, the food is very tasty, portions are generous and service is usually friendly and attentive.  I love all the varieties of cheesecakes offered, and the cheesecake is pretty good - maybe a little on the dense/dry side for my taste, but still good.  I think the most appealing thing about their cheesecake is that huge number of varieties available.  One of my favorite desserts they serve is not a cheesecake at all - it is the strawberry shortcake (see my photo).  It's a biscuit shortcake piled high with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream and it's the bomb.  Be aware - this dessert HUGE and can easily feed 3 people. I also love the Fried Mac & Cheese and Avocado Egg Roll Appetizers.  For entrees, my favorite is the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. All in all, I give this restaurant thumbs up!"
Priscilla P.,"Morristown, NJ",55,158,96,1.0,7/14/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory location I have ever been to.  I used to love this chain and felt that they had reliably good food.  At the Cherry Hill location, the food was just inedible, restaurant itself was unsanitary, and the bad service did not help either.  My cousin and I came for lunch on Thursday 7/13 at around 3pm.  The restaurant was nowhere near full and it appeared that most tables were available.  We were told by the hostess that it would be a 20 minute wait if we want to have a table with service (??there is an option for table without service??), otherwise we could go sit at the bar.  We browsed around at nearby shops and waited the 20 minutes... When we got buzzed for a table, we were seated in the far corner of the restaurant (awkward spot where there were A LOT OF FLIES!!! EW) and on our way to the table, there were so many empty tables that had not been cleared/cleaned (this could be what is attracting flies? and causing a wait at an off hour?).  I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta... and it was so terrible... it was pasta floating in so much oil that I caught myself SLURPING the three bites that I took!  I ended up just eating the chicken cutlet part of it.  My cousin got an everything pizza... and it looked and tasted like a frozen pizza that was not microwaved all the way! The cheese looked like individual shredded pieces that did not melt... and I heard loud crunching as she bit into the crust (which was not ""crispy"" but more from being stale).  Our waitress was so hard to get a hold of and with all the flies, we were just anxious to get out of there.  She never made eye contact or asked how our food was, just dropped off the check and walked away quickly.  I will not be returning to this location and certainly do NOT recommend."
Jonathan G.,"Wynnewood, PA",119,67,39,4.0,1/15/2017,Came for brunch. The food was pretty good. Surprisingly no wait even though it's Saturday. It's pretty much what I would expect from Cheesecake Factory. Food pretty good and excellent service with somewhat cheesy ambiance (no pun intended.$
Carolina P.,"Northbrook, IL",63,17,15,4.0,8/15/2017,"Went for lunch for a family members birthday and it was absolutely delicious! Their skinny menu is fabulous and their low cal steak medallions- with edamame instead of mashed potatoes- was off the charts, only downside was the wait for a table and wait for food"
Joseph V.,"Hightstown, NJ",0,5,,2.0,8/7/2017,"Good food keeps me coming back.  Albeit service has been spotty. Last two visits we didn't receive the right order. This most recent visit, as an example, our server's response to the situation was ""I work with idiots"" no apologies at all. Just took my dish to the back and added the missing ingredient while repeating "" I work with idiots "". Extremely unpleasant. More customer service trading needed !"
Tanya B.,"Philadelphia, PA",1712,113,1847,4.0,2/26/2017,The Cheesecake Factory has a lot of different cheesecake. When you coming in to the Restaurant your eyes go straight to the Cheesecake. Their Happy  Hour is a nice place to unwind after a long day after work. The menu has a lot to chose   from. The outside seating is a breath of fresh air.
Bryan D.,"Merchantville, NJ",0,4,,2.0,2/6/2017,"Went here on Super Bowl Sunday to talk about the Bachelor, and despite the restaurant being empty we were sat shoulder to shoulder with other guests. Chicken teriyaki was whatever, avocado egg roll was decent, my date had gumbo after ordering salmon and having them coming back saying they were out (who does that?) and even though she's gorgeous she didn't look to happy with it. Bartender was super nice, but for the price of 4 shots of Don Julio you could just buy a bottle at your local liquor selling establishment.   Ps-one of the couples next to use was using sign language and boy having that out of the corner of your eye is distracting. Move those tables apart Cheesecake Factory!!!"
Jason T.,"Upper Darby, PA",0,22,1,2.0,3/11/2017,This review has 2 stars because the waitress was super friendly. Now for the bad: 1) Bone in chicken parm pizza special.  2) the entree I got wasn't good or really what I asked for 3) everything was extremely slow
Justin C.,"Evesham Township, NJ",32,189,251,5.0,8/5/2016,"This hit the spot today. Great way to end the day on a high note with a late lunch at Cheesecake Factory. Its as good as i remember it since last time I was here. Went light today so ordered a Sante Fe salad. Nice fresh ingredients, black beans, vorn, and tortilla. I was loving all the fixings in this salad. I really enjoyed this meal!!!!"
Jadiey C.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",58,65,419,4.0,9/8/2016,"Whose not a fan of The Cheesecake Factory?? This has always been a place I visit at the end of my day, trying to always avoid the crowd. I luv their mojito's and they have a pretty large selection of vegetarian food. Not, just the typical vegetarian meals, but something that took some thought to create. On this visit, my daughter and I came in an hour before closing. I started with my usual pineapple mojito but ended up with two by the end of the night. I decided it was to late to eat a large meal, so I stuck with the small plate menu. I was craving a Greek salad, and it truly can't be appreciated unless you add extra feta cheese, YUM!! I also enjoyed a variety of fried sticks, that included zucchini, avocado and port mushrooms. All fried to perfection with two dipping sauces, I was in veggie heaven. Overall, this was a very healthy and inexpensive meal. The customer service was great and we opted to sit outside, since the AC was blasting. I luv getting those little moments alone with my daughter, she's the best company. I'm a regular here, so I'll always be back!!"
Mariella S.,"Camden County, NJ",445,284,4654,3.0,10/10/2015,"The portions are huge not as large as the wait though. I find the menu overwhelming. The bread basket that comes out with a variety of breads is nice especially with the butter. Being the menu is so large I make up my mind and then change it 3 or 4 times before the servers makes it back. The cocktails are not anything special. The cheesecake options are always promising. I love cheesecake so it's pretty hard to mess that up in my opinion. I don't find myself craving the food that often and mostly it's due to the wait the food is not worth waiting 1.5 to be seated. I usually go with the ceasar salad which is HUGE and well dressed. Their margaritas leave much to be desired flavor wise but are pretty strong.  Also, I tried arranging a dinner with a large group and they do not take reservations so I decided to wait the 2 hours they asked me to wait in order to put together a table large enough for us all but then they changed their minds once I arrived and we had to go elsewhere. They should take reservations for larger groups (like most  other restaurants) but is evident they didn't want our money then therefore I take my money elsewhere on other nights."
Tom P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,55,8,1.0,8/2/2017,"Was planning on taking my party of nine to have a casual birthday dinner.  I attempted to call early in the week to get a reservation since the party was large, however, they stated they didn't take reservations.  hmmmm... so went there in-person the day of and was told it was over a 1.5 hour wait.  Seriously?!?! So you don't take reservations, and if you come in person you have to wait that long.  One-star for not having weekend reservations set up.  Just because you KNOW that you have enough business to not have to deal with reservations doesn't mean you degrade the customer experience in such a manner.  Instead we went across the street to get AYCE sushi instead and had an amazing dinner."
Kha T.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",21,3,,4.0,8/29/2017,"Always a pleasure to eat at The Cheesecake Factory, no matter where at. Service and food is always great."
J G.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,26,,2.0,10/28/2017,Had dinner on a Saturday night.  The wait for the table was endless. Don't understand the appeal.  Finally sat at tiny table for 2.  The noise level was unreal.  Had to practically shout at the waiter to be heard.  Forget trying to converse with my date.  Then they lowered the lights. I could barely see what I was eating.  The food was actually good but no plans to go back there.
Allie A.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",84,1850,486,4.0,5/2/2016,"3.5 but I'm being generous. This place is a zoo.  It was my first time ever in a Cheesecake Factory, so I didn't know what to expect.  It was a Sunday and our big family had a lovely gift card we wanted to use, so we tried to be smart and make reservations in advance and come in for an early dinner, but THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS ON THE WEEKENDS. ""Expect an hour long wait time,"" they said.  So we waited just over an hour (luckily, part of our family arrived early to ""take one for the team"" and get on the list and the little buzzy thing) while we came with my 86 year old mother a bit later so she wasn't too inconvenienced.  The food itself was fine. We ordered 10 different dishes and no one complained. My coconut shrimp curry thing was pretty good. What was over the top, though, was the service. Our waiter was bouncy and energetic and really happy. Nice to see that on a busy night, he seemed unfazed by all.  Good job, mister."
Tricia G.,"Turnersville, NJ",164,509,1040,4.0,8/23/2015,I finally had cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory and I was very happy with it - I had the Godiva and it was both rich and light if that makes sense. My lovely 'friend' had the salted caramel and that was really delicious too!   Their menu is so extensive that you could get overwhelmed but in the best way!  Id go back to try a few others for sure!
Eric T.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,2,1,4.0,2/6/2017,The good place to go for any occasion the service was good the food was and of course the cheesecake there is good the burrito I had was good I would definitely go again
Marz S.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,123,399,4.0,6/25/2016,"Food was as expected. It was not bad. Fish tacos were good, my shrimp with angel hair pasta with marinara sauce was good... A little bit on the spicy side but still good. I ordered he dinner portion even though there was a lunch portion available for $3 less. I ordered the dinner portion cuz the waitress said most people can't finish it and they take home the left overs. I did not have any left overs. Either my appetite has increased or the portion wasn't anything humongous.  The hibachi steak was sweet and yummy and the pasta with white sauce was good as well."
Vince S.,"Trenton, NJ",302,589,902,3.0,8/23/2015,"I am not ashamed to admit that before today I was a 40+ year old Cheesecake Factory virgin. I had nothing against the business, but no real desire to lose my chasteness. Now that I am no longer pure, I can honestly say that I can see the appeal this place has on people from all walks of life.  First of all, the decor in this location is quite interesting. We both remarked that it had something like a Disney and or resort-ish effect. For some reason you just feel good, and at ease too. Second, the sheer quantity of choices should be able to appease even the pickiest of the picky. I can't comment on the quality, we were here for dessert only. And last but not least, their namesake option does not disappoint. My friend chose Godiva chocolate, and I opted for salted caramel. What I'm leaving out is that it took us ten minutes to narrow our selection down since the choices are vast. We enjoyed both slices. The tastes were fresh and intense, with lovely plating. Almost as lovely as my desserting companion, but not quite. To sum up, I would recommend CF to families with younguns, or those looking for casual fare with an ending that is sure to be happy. I think people from other cultures visiting the U.S. might also enjoy the experience of dining or at least desserting here. 3.75 sweet cheesy Yelps."
