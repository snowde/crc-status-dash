Mark H.,"Wynnewood, PA",45,141,,3.0,5/14/2012,"What can I say, that you wouldn't already know about Cheesecake Factory? This one located near much shopping in Cherry Hill is a good example of a normal Cheesecake Factory.  It's got the gigantic menu.  Everything comes in large portions for a relatively low price.  There is a good drink menu and everything tastes pretty good. Service here has always been pretty good and as long as you don't come at a big rush time you can usually get seated pretty quickly.  Up to this point, I'd easily give this location 4 stars. The only problem is the floors are so greasy.  This isn't an isolated problem.  It seems like this is a recurring problem at many Cheesecake Factory locations.  Perhaps their kitchen ventilation installations aren't enough for all locations?  Maybe the staff at locations don't have the proper equipment from corporate to properly maintain the floors?  Either way it's a serious annoyance and speaks poorly of the overall cleanliness of the chain as a whole."
Tim P.,"West Deptford, NJ",685,356,643,4.0,6/16/2011,"I had eaten here several times since having to have a waiter removed from serving us back in January for being nothing short of an asshole and obnoxious... As I told the manager at the time, I'd continue to come and not let that one experience ruin what has always been a good place to have a meal with good service.. My wife and I stopped in last night planning to have dinner. But after having the crispy calimari, crab balls, a salad, and mint green tea, there was no way that  we could eat a meal.. So we chose to have dessert... We chose to share their dutch caramel apple cheesecake, which was out of this world good... And we ordered cheesecake for the kids to have when they get out of school today... The service was great, and we had a good time around very friendly people dining there...  The best thing about this place is their hours... Open til 11 Mon-Thurs. And til midnight on weekends..."
Jacie B.,"Riverton, NJ",4,12,4,3.0,12/24/2013,Usually great but 2 hours to get seated is too long for a sunday night
Ateeb K.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",6,67,51,5.0,2/24/2012,"Only have experience with their seafood menu. Everyone we have ordered, we have had a pleasant experience. Restaurant is always packed for a reason.  Their portions are large and more than filling. have tried all their seafood dishes and very happy with all of them.  Every waiter/ress has been nice as well.  their order by phone and park service is a good option to explore when restaurant is extra busy"
LeLe E.,"Princeton, NJ",267,144,644,4.0,5/11/2011,"So although it's a chain the food is very tasty. The portion size is humongous but tasty. I went on a friendly date/celebration of the spring semester being over. Pros: Great ambiance, the location (surrounded by stores in a well lit beautiful shopping center), the wheat bread, the selection is huge (a little overwhelming), it's a really pretty restaurant. Cons: small bathroom (i went to wash my hands and almost was taken out by a swinging door), the view I had of the game (celtics vs heat - okay so i wasn't at the bar...but i was mad b/c i couldn't see the game!), the way they cut the strawberry on my drink (b/c when i went to sip it, the berry fell off and rolled onto the floor) i got the carrot cheese cake and my friend got the apple cheese cake. Both very yummi but it's a lot of food. I'd go here again (: went here again on 5/21 pretty good, i had a cheeseburger, i wasn't super impressed but the ribs my buddy had were delicious so it all worked out."
Sylvette F.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",0,28,15,3.0,8/22/2013,"We love this place!!  Having said that the quality is slowly diminishing this past year.  They have, on several occasions, run out of items on the menu.  The portions have slimmed down and this particular location seems to have a fruit fly and fly issue which brings to light a sanitation concern!  Sorry however for the price quantity and quality are expected not recommended!"
Ryan W.,"Seattle, WA",49,169,1,4.0,6/24/2011,"If I could eat here more often, I would. But I'm not one to wait in line to eat my dinner, nor do I like eating meals that are a couple days worth of calories regularly but I do like delicious food and good service which is usually consistent at the Cheesecake Factory. If you're going on a weekend night, be prepared to wait as a line does form for dinners. I, just about always, get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. I don't think there is anything better on the menu and if there was, I wouldn't know. I usually don't even look at their very extensive menu simply because I like this dish so much, and I usually have leftovers. It's rare that I don't clean my plate but I find it extremely difficult to do so at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Sharon B.,"Glenside, PA",271,36,48,4.0,9/17/2011,"The food was good and there was a huge selection. Too big, it was hard to make a decision. The service was prompt and it was really nice. My only complaint was the long wait and they don't take reservations. My brother went over before us and checked In so we wouldn't have to wait as long,since we were taking out my father. But they were able to accommodate his needs easily and the wheelchair was Not a problem or in the way at all which is really nice and easy. Just Because of that I know we will go back again. Next time I'll go early and run into DSW since it's right there!"
jay l.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",281,99,44,4.0,11/13/2011,"No matter who's visiting (from my tea party uncle to my lesbian cousin) this is a great standby place in Cherry Hill to take folks who want to go ""out to eat.""  Prepare yourself for the menu, it's exhausting, and concentrate on apps and dessert.  I hear the cheesecake is ""the bomb"" but IMHO, you can't go wrong with their Lemon Cake which I got both time I've dined here.    Maybe it's the soft bigotry of low expectations, because I never thought I'd give this place 4 stars.  But the food and service are too solid to give anything less."
Sharon C.,"Evesham Township, NJ",1,9,1,2.0,3/2/2014,"The food is pretty good, but the wait is always so stupid that the 7 times out of 10 that I've gone here, I ended up leaving because the food isn't that damn good that I would wait 2-3 hours!!!  So the food gets 4 stars, but the wait gets zero stars!"
Joseph C.,"Baltimore, MD",93,282,47,3.0,9/3/2013,"We were shopping in Jersey and hungry for lunch, so we decided to chain it up.  The menu here is absurdly large.  Everything seems good in theory, but its all just a little boring and unnecessarily greasy.  I felt bloated and slimy when I left.  No thank you."
Jill T.,"Sewell, NJ",31,36,2,4.0,5/19/2014,"Shared Mother's Day weekend lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  We were seated immediately, and greeted by our waitress within a few minutes.  Service was prompt, apps & lunch items came out at a good pace.  Long island iced tea and mojito were well prepared and tasty.  We shared the guacamole as an app, it was delicious.  Also ordered cashew chicken salad, a pasta dish, shrimp summer rolls, chicken lettuce wrap tacos....all were excellent!   The only negative is that the ladies restroom was a complete mess, overflowing trash, no toilet paper to be found in any of the stalls."
Michelle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3600,1785,1533,3.0,10/7/2008,"I'm tempted to give four stars, because I've never had a bad experience (besides the standard wait time for a table, of course), but something is holding me back... most likely, the extra weight I put on after my meal on Saturday evening. Picture this: three relatively health-conscious girls out to dinner.  Nobody was trying to get all South Beach or anything, but it was clear that we wanted healthy meals so we could splurge a little on dessert.  Two orders of wasabi tuna and an order of miso salmon seemed like a safe enough bet. Not so much.  My friends' wasabi tuna entrees were really delish, but the wasabi crust had a fried consistency to it-- good for sure, but totally not necessary.  My salmon dish had an absolute river of thick creamy sauce going around the plate.  Luckily, the salmon itself was on dry land, located on top of an island of rice.   I just don't understand why the people behind the menu at Cheesecake Factory think that healthy food has to be bombarded with fat before people will order it.  The salmon was fantastic with just the miso glaze-- and the tuna didn't need such a thick, greasy crust.     Oh, the CF does have healthier selections on the menu.  You'll know what they are because they are listed with the words ""Weight Management"" before each item.  What genius came up with this idea?!  Can I take his or her place on the marketing team when he or she gets fired?"
Meredith J.,"Baltimore, MD",173,284,22,3.0,8/6/2011,"Food was excellent, but the service was terrible. Ate the Salisbury Steak. The portion was large and filling. Very tasty. The mashed potatoes were excellent. Everything was warm and very good, although my mom thought that it could have used some more gravy. Ate the tuxedo cheesecake and lemon raspberry for dessert. The lemon raspberry was very good, but the coffee wasn't very good. However, the service was poor. We felt rushed and unwanted the entire time. The waitress took the bread away quickly and took my mom's food away when she wasn't even finished eating. It wasn't like there were hordes of people waiting to get in to eat, so I'm unsure why we were treated the way we were. Thought it was funny, though, when the waitress overheard me talk about her tip and then started to treat us a bit better."
Al S.,"Mountain View, CA",143,77,17,2.0,8/27/2013,"Fairly disappointed. The only reason we stopped here is because it was the only place hungry and we were starved. The menu has TOO many choices. How can they keep all that food fresh? The services was good and the server was very friendly, but the food was just blah. Don't know why the Cheescake Factory is gets such rave reviews."
Shelby D.,"Sewell, NJ",29,39,4,3.0,9/25/2013,"I really, really want to like it here but it's just eh. I mean everything is like a good microwave meal. Now the cheesecake....slammin! But food...not so great.  Atmosphere is cool, building and bar are nice."
Stephanie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",94,53,9,2.0,4/25/2013,"Never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory chains but this one in particular. Parking is impossible. The bar is tiny. The calories you can consume in one meal here is outrageous. From the high calorie drinks to high calorie salads to 800 calorie pieces of cheesecake! Just know that when you go here your going to gain a roll. The menu is huge, pages long. That is how you know that everything is frozen and nothing is fresh. But that's a chain for ya. Only plus side of this place is the options of cheesecakes there is about 30 different kinds. There are so many better options in walking distance from here so don't waste your time."
Holly S.,"Sicklerville, NJ",33,23,56,4.0,12/11/2013,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on December 10th around 6:30 after a fairly overhyped yet mild snowstorm. I went with my husband and two teenagers menboys.  We chose this time we could get in without a wait.  We ordered off the whole menu.  We had beer, soft drinks, appetizers, small plates and dessert. The teenagers had the fried macaroni and cheese balls.  My husband and I shared the chopped salad.  The kids had burgers and fries for their meals, I had a chile relleno and polenta fries as a small plate combination and my husband ordered a shrimp and pasta dish. Everyone enjoyed their dishes.  We ordered the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake and the Oreo Cheesecake and shared it.  Also one of my sons ordered the milkshake.  I deducted a star for service because I felt that our server took forever bringing us back the dessert menu and then we waited a long time again for him to take our dessert order.  Considering that it was a pretty slow night for the Cheesecake Factory, I felt that the desserts could have been emphasized a bit more.  I will return to this restaurant again.  The food was good, overall a bit pricey.  Dinner with appetizers and desserts for the four of us cost $173 (inclusive of an exactly 18% tip)."
Krystle B.,"New Orleans, LA",100,196,62,3.0,9/25/2012,"Somewhere along the line, The Cheesecake Factory (at least this location) has drastically fallen off.  I actually don't even really like the food here anymore and only come with friends.  Everything about it - other than the cheesecake - is just ""meh"". But the most important part, the cheesecake is always amazing."
Dan S.,"Collingswood, NJ",98,14,,2.0,8/7/2010,"Just as fake, soulless, and depressing as any of its competitors. Arrived at 9:30pm on a Friday and was seated within 15 minutes. Not bad. We waited at the bar and ordered mixed drinks that were well made, but the bartender couldn't look less happy. Kind of sad.  After being seated, our server bum rushed our conversation while looking off into the middle distance. She was beat, I get it, but please try to smile. I asked her name again because I like a little personal interaction and she looked at me like I had two heads. My three companions also noticed the look.  The food was like if Chilis turned up their game. Still soulless and fake, but with enough flavor to make things passable.  Long story short, I'd rather hit the Tortilla Press around the corner if I had a choice. Foodies don't eat here, just easily impressed, fooled flakes who don't go any deeper than the surface."
