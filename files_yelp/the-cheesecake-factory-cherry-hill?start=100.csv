Ellen G.,"Collingswood, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2/4/2017,"This isn't really a restaurant, it's a feeding trough. The tables are about 2 inches apart and the waiters just shovel the food as they pass. Our waiter never put in our appetizer so when they brought our dinners and we told them, they took our entrees back and just put them under hot lights. Our appetizer was greasy (firecracker salmon). My carbonara when they brought it after sitting under lights for so long was congealed and rubbery. I would have ordered another drink but the waiter never came back or asked. Twice he put our food down in front of the people sitting at the next table and then realized his mistake. Very crowded, noisy, no attention to detail, no customer service. I left feeling very unrelaxed, rushed and annoyed. Not how I want to spend an evening out. I will never be back."
Joseph A.,"Evesham Township, NJ",0,11,,4.0,1/31/2017,"Great food and atmosphere. The menu is a bit confusing, there is just so much to choose from. The wait to be seated is usually a bit long since it is a local hot spot, but the food makes up for it."
Elizabeth F.,"Lake Bluff, IL",1,22,20,1.0,5/30/2016,"We came here at my foreign guests' request, and it was a great reminder of why I hate Cheesecake Factory. It's all hype and the products are never very good. Case in point- our drinks were entirely flawed and the waitress didn't even apologize (the tea was missing the teabag... By the time they brought it the water had gotten cold. The cream had started to turn, and sodas were flat. Total fail). In general, it annoys me that they don't respond to customer requests-- CF policy prevents customizing orders, and if you ask for a meat salad without the meat you still have to pay the full price, despite the fact that they offer few vegetarian salads. Coming here makes me hate consumerism and the American market system. Ugh."
Yongzhe T.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,3,3,3.0,1/8/2017,Anybody has stomach problem after Friday 01/06/17. The whole family was sick over weekend. The service is good. The food is so so.
Chris H.,"Lumberton, NJ",1,31,9,3.0,5/13/2016,"I took my wife here for her birthday. It was 8PM on a Friday, I did expect it to be a little busy. I tried making reservations the day before but they don't take reservations. We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table. It took the waitress a while to get our drink order. When she came back with our drinks she took our appetizer order and asked for our dinner order. It then took an eternity to get our appetizers. We had the appetizers and the dinner came immediately before we finished. I was aggrevated at this point but to be fair the food was very good. I had the chicken Marsala and my wife had the chicken colleto (a lemon sauce) which she enjoyed very much. We both had cheesecake for dessert. I had the chocolate chip cookie dough and my wife had the Oreo. They were both excellent. The atmosphere was very nice and we enjoyed the surroundings. The waitress was friendly but either over worked or unorganized. My biggest complaints were the lack of reservations, the wait for our drinks and appetizers and the fact that dinner was brought too soon after the appetizers. I do recommend this place but would avoid Friday nights."
Alyssa R.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",48,155,118,3.0,6/29/2015,"Place is all hype, mediocre food. They have to much of a menu they need to focus on just a few areas of their menu to make them fantastic. Pricey, loud and we all have been that guy waiting an hour outside for a 3 star overpriced meal. I do really love the patio Seating though and the wait time to eat outside is usually small If there is one at all."
Becky M.,"West Chester, PA",0,17,3,3.0,6/25/2017,"I really can't believe I'm giving this place 3 stars. We went on a Saturday night, party of 2. Was told the wait would be 20 minutes but only ended up being 10. Sweet! We were then seated and sat and waited for 15 minutes until someone came over to our table. Turns out we just so happened to be seated at a ""change of shift"" time. Um, what? I've never even heard of that at a restaurant in all my years on this earth. Anyway, by the time our waitress realized we were waiting, we were ready to order our food. She didn't even ask what we wanted to drink. After finally getting our drinks, our complimentary bread came to the table. The honey wheat was good, but the Italian bread was soooo hard and crusty I couldn't even chew it. Completely inedible. I'm all for crusty, hearty bread but this was insane. Fast forward to appetizer.. delicious! We got the crab wontons, they were fresh and hot and tasty. Now, on to my main dish. Sigh. I ordered the fish tacos and the plate was at-best lukewarm when it got to the table. The ingredients in the tacos were weird. It almost had a sour/bitter taste and the ingredients were piled into the taco so high that it was difficult to pick up and eat. The black beans were salty and the rice that was served with it was so weird. I can't even explain the flavor, all I know is it didn't go with the dish. Should I also mention the tables? They have so many tables crammed in there, when the girls next to us got up to leave their bodies were actually touching our table because there simply was not enough room to get by. We could hear their conversations and I'm sure they could hear ours. I was probably sitting 12 inches away from our neighbors. So much for an intimate dining experience. I've always loved Cheesecake Factory for many years, I'm totally disappointed in my experience this past weekend. Won't be back for quite a while."
Orlando M.,"Vineland, NJ",155,65,118,4.0,2/22/2016,I've eaten here a number of times and have been satisfied with each visit. For starters the Buffalo Blasts are really good. Really thin and crunchy fried chicken bites that come with dipping sauces. Really good If your into your wings. Chicken Romano was my last entree and was on the heavier side but was really good. The Oreo cheesecake was a chocolate lovers dream. And the cocktails at this place are exceptional as well. It can be a little pricey but I think that you can work around the pricing by learning the menu. Like to think this is one of the better chains around. So for a chain it's a 4. Reason being even with it being really good I've never caught myself urging to come back and I wouldn't plan my day around going. So it's a 4.
Hollei J.,"Pennsauken Township, NJ",618,330,152,5.0,5/31/2015,"Besides it being super congested, and them having seating issues... The food is consistently good. They serve up my FAVORITE extra dirty martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives. YUM! And we can't forget about my all time favorite dessert. Key lime cheesecake. Hands down the best thing on the menu. You'll never be disappointed eating here."
Nando F.,"San Diego, CA",882,539,1722,5.0,4/16/2012,"Yea 5 stars for a chain location...  I brought my wife here Sunday night for an early anniversary dinner(seeing on Tuesday i am at an interview) We have eaten at their other location in King Of Prussia and i must say seeing this is the second time.. no complaints.. We had outside seating seeing the weather was Gorgeous and the wait time was 1 min, compaired to 15-20 min for inside dining. Which is common for this place, also its not as cold as it was inside.. felt like a cold box once you walked in. My wife as much as i LOVE her she is always cold.. it could be 85 outside and she can still complain about it being cold.. Don't know its her Latino blood.. but thats besides. The outside was perfect, light breeze, beautiful scenerie.. a look of the stores and how it was lit up by the lights and florals outside. (Not saying inside was bad, that too looked comfortable, easy on the eyes) Our service was great, our waitress was friendly recommended some specials there were doing. They also have a newer menu out its their 500 calorie or less menu(for those of you who want to enjoy the great food, but not to worry about gaining weight)I saw the menu, i looked over it , i must say i was impressed, the meals they had on there.. you wouldn't think they were 500 cal, or less. OK now lets get into the goods...  We started off with some drinks, wifey got the Pina Colada, i got the Pomegrante Mojito.. (very very good) , our appitzers we both went salads, my wife got the veggi salad,(this is one big salad) and myself a Boston salad.. Lets say Boston won this battle of the salads, very tasty, had bacon on it so you know its a winner hands down, shredded and little chunks of  blue cheese and ranch dressing.. I reccommend that salad if you guys like salads..  For our main course, which i gotta say the portions are incredible.. more like HUGE. My wife and i both went with steaks but she had the shrimp scampi with a fillet cut medium, with wasabi mash, and veggies. Looked great , cooked to her likings. Myself i went with the Hibachi steak, medium with tempura asparagas, also wasabi mash, shitake mushrooms in a sweet, but not overbearing sauce.. gotta say they knocked it out of the park with this... Phenominal.  Our waitress did a great job, made sure if we liked evrything, or any problems.. it did get a little cold outside(for my wife) i enjoyed it... but i did ask if she could turn on the heater they have, she did, without any hesitation or surroundings people. I think the wives/gf's around us were also grateful of this..  We didn't get any cheesecake  because we were full , but i know she brought home 2 slices, dulce de leche, and a vannilla bean.. do you think i will get a taste.. ERRRRR wrong lol . But we did walk around after the meal to look at the stores .. i recommend that after this feast you will embark"
Suzanne S.,"Philadelphia, PA",161,239,42,3.0,2/6/2015,"I've been on a Cheesecake Factory kick for the last two weeks and I can't seem to figure out why. Usually, I find their main dishes to be mediocre, but lately, I've craved their appetizers , drinks and cheesecake, so I guess I just answered my own question. For two weeks in a row, I have shared an app and a salad with the parties I was with and gotten a slice of cheesecake to-go. I ordered the skinnylicious chopped vegetable salad two weeks in a row, and it doesn't disappoint.  One week, my group ordered the factory nachos, which I found mediocre, and the other week, the tex mex egg rolls, which were a hit. One person ordered the four cheese pasta which was absolutely amazing, and another, the black pepper shrimp, which was okay. Their passion fruit martini  and Asian pear martinis are always a hit, and although they are pricey, they are pretty strong, so it is a good deal. As far as cheesecake goes, I have taken a bite of their tiramisu cheesecake (not too great) and their banana cheesecake (delicious) in the past two weeks and have had the red velvet cheesecake (my favorite) in the past."
Angie K.,"Maple Shade Township, NJ",13,3,1,1.0,12/19/2015,"I love cheesecake factory, but today is my anniversary and I could not go out to a restaurant because my daughter is very ill. We decided to order cheesecake factory when i called I was on hold forever and then the person specifically asked if I wanted bread and butter I told her yes. We got our food and mine looked like food slopped together no presentation and I am assuming the sauces just mixed together looked like soup and my mashed potatoes were not mashed but potato chunks and my steak was so done I could hardly get my knife threw. I guess to get good food you have to eat in the restaurant! Don't order take out they don't take pride in what they put in container. I got the combination dinner chicken meridea and steak Diane, 21$$ meal and it was ice cold..."
Shannon M.,"Moorestown, NJ",1,18,1,5.0,6/24/2016,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. Every time I come here, I always have EXCELLENT customer server. Although the food is pricey, you get what you pay for, and the portions are HUGE! the red velvet cheesecake is to literally die for!"
Brian K.,"Vincentown, NJ",0,18,,5.0,1/2/2015,"Yeah it's a chain, and yeah maybe it takes 4 hours to get a table, but the CSF is top class.  The menu is no lie 40 pages long so you can get a steak or a pizza or a burger or probably something you didnt even know existed. The cocktails are great and the cheesecake is awesome, if it wasn't I think they would have a different name. This isn't actually a factory, keep in mind, and it does have a classy casual atmosphere with some great decor and lighting."
Jo L.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,278,1009,4.0,12/23/2013,"About a 40 minutes wait on a Saturday night I guess isn't too bad. They were also giving out samples for their holiday Peppermint Cheesecake. Fooood time! For starters: ' Buffalo wings ' Crispy Crab Bites ' Stuffed Mushrooms The Stuffed Mushrooms had a Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce which was good to dip with the complimentary bread that they gave you. *Side story: About that bread, I love it! The brown one. We even got another basket with just the brown ones. And when we were almost done, we asked for some more so our waiter went and got us a whole fresh roll! I was so excited! Thank you!! So for the main course, we had: ' Cajun Jambalaya ' Shrimp with Angel Hair ' Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic & some kind of chicken salad with blue cheese. Jamabalaya = ""Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce."" I wouldn't say it was VERY spicy but it was a little. I felt like the angel hair was a bit bland so we mix the jamabalaya & the angel hair pasta and you get a nice new little pasta dish with more taste. For dessert: ' Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake ' Mango Key Lime Cheesecake ' Pumpkin Cheesecake The Mango Key Lime was pretty good. I didn't try the rest but everyone seemed to enjoy it. We'll be back. I'll be back for the bread but I'm sure everyone else will be back for the food & cheesecake."
Steve J.,"Burlington Township, NJ",233,169,65,4.0,10/5/2013,"What a place. It Takes a bit to figure out what to eat since the menu is a small novel! The spicy Dynamite shrimp is off the hook. For Dinner I had the spicy cashew chicken which was fantastic. Make sure you save room for dessert...they have cheesecake!!!!! Red velvet cheesecake, Hershey cheesecake, carrot cheesecake....and if you font want cheesecake they have fresh strawberries and chocolate. Yummy! Great place."
Dom F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,48,2,4.0,4/6/2016,"Every time I have come here, the food has been great, the servers were awesome and friendly and I have never had any complaints or problems."
Brian H.,"Camden, NJ",179,32,92,5.0,11/10/2014,"So... The Cheesecake Factory.... for one, this place has a pretty good size menu with a very extensive list of food varieties and drinks. Oh you can not forget the cheese cake lol. The atmosphere was very nice, and our waitress was very professional. I think I would recommend coming here for lunch versus dinner as this place gets pretty packed in the evening hours. I would definitely recommend at least one visit to this place to scratch it off of the bucketlist!"
Matt G.,"Philadelphia, PA",10,9,,1.0,7/30/2016,"This was quite possibly the worst dining experience of my life. For starters, the plates on the table were filthy. I ordered a plate of nachos. Granted, there were a couple modifications to them. However, messing up an order twice is completely unacceptable. The second attempt, the cheese was so burnt that they wouldn't have been edible even if the order was correct. Then, the manager tries to tell me that the item I ordered can't be prepared that way when, in fact, someone in my party has ordered the item that I ordered the exact same way on numerous occasions. I preemptively rejected a third attempt due to the fact that I had lost my appetite during this fiasco. Any other restaurant would have, at least, credited a portion of the check due to their poor execution. I feel I was lucky to get credited for the botched part of my order. Needless to say, I won't be coming back anytime soon. Especially when it was someone in our party's birthday."
Elizabeth C.,"Merchantville, NJ",115,122,176,4.0,2/23/2016,"This place never disappoints. If you have never been here it's a must. The only thing that is a bit of a hassle is the wait time. They only take reservations during the weekdays, weekend is first come first serve and that means anywhere from 45-hour and a half wait. We waited hour and a half. Their menu is the size of a library book they offer probably a good 200 items I have been here a handful of times and still always get the same appetizer user after trying a few. Thai lettuce wraps. Huge portion deliscious always. This time I got a bacon date pizza and my wife got the pasta carbonara. I would call this place more of a gourmet diner. Kids are still present its super loud the menu is extensive they offer brunch on the weekends but the food quality does not lack at all. I give four stars bc of the wait times, not food quality although this time I went I did have to send an appetizer back because it had a hair on it but honestly let's face it that happens everywhere. We all have hair and can't cover it up 100% of the time so I don't get mad about it. Just sent back and server was great about the whole thing. Service is always top notch here even though their extremely busy."
