Ben B.,"Bala Cynwyd, PA",108,55,45,3.0,10/17/2015,I've been here 2 times now and I'm not entirely impressed. The food is average but the cost is unreasonably high. The service is poor and you are left waiting a while for anything you ask for. The place itself is kept well and presentable. I could see going here every once in a blue moon but it's not really a place to go all of the time. The menu is a book with many options so it's a good group eating type of place.
Sean M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",1,53,2,4.0,12/24/2015,"Very good dinner. The family and I went. I do feel it is too expensive. $15.95 for spaghetti and 3 meatballs is crazy. Franky, our server, was excellent."
Bruce F.,"VINCENTOWN, NJ",0,29,3,2.0,5/7/2016,"Unbelievably crowded. $7 beer on tap, $10 suavigion blanc. Mediocre food at best. Stay away from this over priced and awful chain restaurant. Baked potatoes soup was like paste. Hibachi steak was swimming in teriyaki making it inedible. Burgers were just OK. Kids liked the cheesecake. Bad, bad,bad. Go visit something owned by a hard working chef."
Kevin M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",7,15,4,5.0,1/15/2016,"Menu is very expansive, which is good & bad. Lots of choices, but also a lot to navigate. The wait can be long on top of parking being difficult, but I don't mind parking far anyways. Service was decent and food was very fresh. Although it feels rushed towards the end of their visit, the whole part of dining is the cheesecake selection. I don't eat cheesecake very often, but they set the standard for the stuff!"
haapy s.,"Upper Darby, PA",2,14,2,4.0,5/25/2015,"So another day with Cheesecake Factory in cheery hill ,Tim is our server he did good , still missing location on kop ,,,,but not bad ,,like it everything food was good ,Sevice was but as Restaurent  Owner I expect Restaurent should more comfortable place I will come back again and give more shot"
Michelle B.,"Haddonfield, NJ",1276,250,1220,4.0,7/6/2013,"I find the appetizers I ordered are filling. The crispy wontons & spicy crispy chicken taquitos... But, ohhhh the cheesecake..... This place is a sin just walking through the door but who cares with all their delicious food and dessert. But if you feel too guilty they have a Skinny Girl menu......."
John P.,"Oaklyn, NJ",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2016,"I want to start with the wait. I came here with Jesus Christ and he is no longer with me. I've changed my clothes easily over a million times. I've seen the menu change from berries and leaves to decadent cheesecakes, not that I would know how those taste.."
Deborah M.,"Clayton, NJ",10,31,,3.0,10/23/2016,the food was good but the noise level in this place was terrible plus the food was way overpriced. every time we went there we had to wait for a table which was stupid when you see tables around. i suggest you wear ear plugs cause this place is loud.
Megan M.,"Philadelphia, PA",368,242,352,3.0,10/1/2014,"Middle of the road chain restaurant. The Cherry Hill location is very aesthetically pleasing, and the food is above average. I especially like the white chili chicken and the fennel salad. The menu is ridiculously overwhelming, however. Be prepared to spend some time pouring over the 20+ page menu. Drinks are overpriced and nothing special. Bread basket is good, especially the brown bread. A good option before/after shopping at the CH mall or in the plaza.. if you don't mind chain restaurants."
Linda C.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",30,20,140,4.0,9/11/2014,"Love it here! Haven't had a bad experience yet and hopefully it stays that way. You can't go wrong ordering the Louisiana Chicken or Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. Super tasty! The days that I want to eat light, I'd order the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad with the dressing on the side. Portions are always huge and delish! For cheesecake, I've only tried the Red Velvet and Oreo. Both arw superb! Service is always very good and friendly as well."
Nick S.,"Jacksonville, NC",0,2,,2.0,2/19/2017,"Exremely dissatisfied with our visit to your location. When we arrived we were told a manager would get a hold of us for our party of nine. This was after we called ahead to find out if call ahead seating was available. The hostess was extremely rude to my girlfriends sister and told us they don't do that here and HUNG UP on her. On our arrival we were told to wait 30 minutes to speak to a manager an hour later he came out and told us it would be an hour. 2 hours later we were still waiting for a table, when we went in for an update again extremely rude and told we would we get seated when they were ready for us and we were being impatient. No concern for your customers at all. Is your philosophy that you don't care and you have many other customers for a income base? My girlfriends nephews birthday was supposed to be a special event, but instead we were treated like trash. I've worked in the food service industry before I know how bad one review goes. I wouldn't normally post anything, but I think you need to take a look at how your employees and management treat your clientele at this particular location"
Dante C.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,2,,2.0,2/3/2016,"Me and a friend came for the first time in a while. They have parking at this location so it was more convenient than the downtown Philly location. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and our waitress was good. The food was okay-my take home dish had a long piece of hair in it. I didnt discover it until the next day. The drinks are not what you go for, it has to be the food. The drinks are sweet-you can barely taste alcohol."
Lena J H.,"Mantua, NJ",91,82,645,3.0,7/2/2013,"I've been here a half dozen times and find this to be a decent restaurant.  They have great ranch dressing, I must say. It has a hint if garlic, yum. Their alcoholic drinks are made well. Their dessert is good, but eight dollars for a small piece if cake is outrageous! Not worth it, when it costs that much to make an entire cake. Their food is hit or miss. My friend got fish tacos once and then shrimp scampi, and didn't like either. I tasted a friend's French fries, and they were over salted. That's annoying coming from fine dining. My sweet corn tamale cakes were too sweet and lacked a good contrast in textures - the cakes should be crisp with a crunchy exterior, but they were super mushy. I've found their pasta and salad dishes to be the only consistently yummy dishes. The pumpernickel with oats served right away and warm are a favorite as well.  They also don't put the prices on the menu for the alcoholic drinks...not a fan of not knowing what you're getting for the price. If you're going here, I say stick to the classics. They don't pull off trendy, unique dishes very well at all. Cocktails tend to be very sweet as well, so watch out if you don't have a sweet tooth."
Kam W.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",76,62,19,5.0,4/2/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory how i love you so, everything about you from the decor to the food makes me wish i could stay here forever. This place is spotless at all times not a spill or a napkin out of place. The bathroom doesn't smell and its clean. Clearly, people must agree considering the fact that its almost always packed dinner time. which is completely understandable. Some people would walk out and find another place if they said 25-30 minute wait but no one leaves because the food is well worth the wait.  The menu has food from every continent and every culture. Even the bread and butter is delicious. The food comes out not only smelling good and tasting delicious but looking like a piece of art. The decor alone will make you forget your in a restaurant because you'll be too busy admiring the architecture and the artwork along the ceiling and the walls.  The waitresses/ waiters manage to always look clean with their white shirts always crisp and never dingy. The silverware isn't just ""clean"" it's shining and the knives are never dull. The bar is fully stocked with a huge flatscreen to compliment it. What's not to love about The Cheesecake Factory?"
Ali C.,"Philadelphia, PA",28,113,163,4.0,12/30/2014,My fiancé and I ate at cheesecake for lunch today after shopping at the mall. I ordered Renee's special (chicken salad sandwich and chicken tortilla soup...and a side salad). I almost always order this because it's 1.delicious 2.a lot of good 2. Great price. I usually get the sour dough bread instead of the bread the chicken salad comes on.  I ended up taking half of it home and I'm sure it will taste just as good tomorrow. Victoria was our waitress at the high top by the bar. She was very friendly and great waitress.
Jennifer T.,"Philadelphia, PA",159,257,141,4.0,9/13/2015,"Sometimes chain restaurants can get a bad reputation because they lack inventiveness or because some people think the food lacks the same caliber as some non chain places.  With Cheesecake Factory though, I feel like people are drawn to the ""tried and true"" menu...and I, for one, look forward to their always dependable and always consistent cheesecakes. All of the cheesecakes. And surprisingly, Cheesecake Factory also hase some of the best salads. I especially love their Cobb salad and their Santa Fe salad. Be warned if you've never been though because their salads are huge! Imagine the biggest plate of salad you've ever seen...and then double it! Yep, that's about right.  Actually all of their food portions are pretty huge. This is why foreigners have bad impressions of Americans...it's because of these gluttonous food portions LOL. Don't fret--just take the rest home and pig out the next day. Their complimentary bread basket is also something I look forward to...and dread...since I could scarf down the entire mini loaf of honey at bread if someone didn't hold me down. So the overall take away from this is go hungry and go prepared to eat ginormous amounts of delicious food. Oh, also, the super long wait for a table will help to make you more hungry...be prepared."
Cara S.,"Andorra, Philadelphia, PA",31,40,16,5.0,3/13/2015,You can never go wrong here. Have been so many times and always leave happy! The banana cream cheesecake is to die for! I cannot leave this place without getting a slice.
Serge D.,"BURLNGTN CITY, NJ",5,3,5,1.0,8/3/2014,Terrible for brunch... Uncooked pancakes and French toast. The cook can't make a proper omelet. Extremely disappointed!!!
Courtney J.,"Clementon, NJ",0,4,1,4.0,6/25/2016,I loved the fried Mac and cheese balls the cheese vanilla bean cheesecake is taste like a vanilla milkshake very good
Lance C.,"Lindenwold, NJ",154,10,,4.0,2/23/2016,"Almost everything that I have had from here has been from good to great. The only dish that let me down was the Orange Chicken. It was very dry and tasted like the boxed fried chicken bites from TGI Fridays that you get in the grocery store. Chicken parm sandwich is AMAZING. Most of their Mexican food is really good and as expected, much better than places like Don Pablo's or On The Border. The cheesecake is obviously this places specialty and they don't disappoint. They have at least 30 different types ranging from the basic to the extreme. My favorite is the Banana cheesecake. Simple yet good. This place is a regular stop for my gf and I. OH! And they do breakfast on Sunday's. The French toast is probably the most amazing thing I've had in a long time."
