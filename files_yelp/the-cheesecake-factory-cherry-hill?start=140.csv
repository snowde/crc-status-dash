Mae I.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,12,11,1.0,7/19/2015,"If you want to see a wide range of inspect species, come here. Flies everywhere, gnats over your bread, smashed relatives of both underneath your table. Gross. Our table was wet when we were seated and the utensils that we were to eat off were laying right on it. Appetizing! While I love the food at Cheesecake, you're better off ordering take out and eating on your dashboard in the car. Bugs are a no no, especially if I'm dining in. Try placing your silverware in the folded napkins versus the nasty tables wiped by dirty ass rags. Kitchen 101, surfaces carry the most germs! Never felt this dirty leaving a CF.  Super disappointed. Guess I'll have to wait for the ones out of state."
Holly S.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,45,1,2.0,11/12/2015,"Poor service and no compensation for an incorrect order.  It was impossible to track down a server.  We began with one server and were assigned to another after our order was placed because of a shift change.  Neither were friendly or attentive.  When our food came out, one of our orders was incorrect.  When we finally got the server's attention, we informed him of the mistake.  All he said was ""sorry about that"" and walked away.  There was no offer to replace this order or to take it off the bill.  Very disappointing experience."
John B.,"Haddonfield, NJ",21,42,9,5.0,11/1/2015,"Visited on a Friday evening just before 5pm. No waiting, seated right away. Our waiter was monotone and very mechanical, like he's said the same thing 10,000 times before. Our drinks were delivered very quickly. My 2 companions and I all ordered the meatloaf without hesitation, that's why we came here! The food was delivered quickly and was filling and delicious. One of my companions complained that the succotash was missing lima beans. Personally, I hate lima beans, so I had no such issue. Overall the meal was very good, and we were promptly seated and served...therefore 5 stars! We will be returning!"
Dan H.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",100,110,318,5.0,3/27/2013,"Despite our disappointment with the removal of certain items (more on that) the Cheesecake Factory does not disappoint when it comes to consistency or portions. We met some friends for brunch on Saturday and were seated right away (we got there when it opened - 11am..ideal) and ordered some drinks.  The cafe mocha, a rich chocolate and coffee blend, is one of my favorite coffee-style drinks.  We were planning to start off with our all-time favorite CF appetizer, the chicken croquettes, but were saddened to learn that they had been removed from the menu.  (deep breath) but we had to move on.  It's actually a good thing that we didn't since we filled up on bread and still couldn't finish our entrees. I ordered the breakfast fiesta burrito; loaded with cheese, potatoes, scrambled eggs, chorizo sausage, peppers and onions, stuffed inside a giant tortilla shell and served on top of a very spicy and delicious tomatillo sauce.  They also present it with a side dish of black beans, but I barely touched the mundane additives; I'd ask for the burrito without them next time.. or substitute some fruit.  Either way, the burrito was amazing and I almost finished it, but remembed to save room for dessert. My wife was feeling more lunch'ish and went with the chicken littles (an oxymoron if I've ever seen one).  Her plate came loaded with fresh (easy to tell it's not factory compressed) chicken tenders, mashed potatoes and a corn/zucchini succotash.  The chicken was delicious, especially with the bbq sauce. Our companions chose the same style of entress, one got a hamburger and the other a breakfast sandwich.  Both reported them as tasty. Dessert brought the next round of disappointment.  Maybe they moved it, but they used to have an awesome chocolate cake, layered with chocolate and coconut.  By far, one fo the best non-cheesecake desserts in their repertoire.  It, along with the chicken croquettes, will always be remembered. Nonetheless, we'll definitely be back!"
Yeni M.,"Bensalem, PA",0,1,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"had a horrible experience at this location .... Came in wanted to sit outside and got seated in an area without shade asked the woman who sat us to sit under an umbrella she for whatever reason did not comprehend but got someone to clear off a different table...And in the whole time we were there, no waiter or waitress came over to us but made sure to attend to the couple who came in after us .... We definitely felt discriminated against"
Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708,4.0,5/30/2012,"My friend and I stopped by here to grab a bite before the pre-screening for Snow White and the Huntsman at AMC Lowes nearby. We did not have to wait for a table/booth, and he had already been seated and served bread by the time I arrived. Within moments of my arrival, we were informed that the original server was finished her shift and another waitress was taking over. No problems there. Plus our order was taken in a timely manner (a cobb salad and a side salad). My cobb salad was amazing, from presentation to taste, and was like literally the best salad I've ever had (even though I ordered it without the avacado and tomato. The only thing I'd say is they never give you enough salad dressing (I ordered some mixed in as well as 2 on the side) Our server was really on point with refills and dressing/bread refills though. Definitely worth stopping if you're nearby!"
Matt C.,"Willingboro, NJ",43,236,100,3.0,5/22/2012,"Note that if you're going here for CHEESECAKE, it gets 12 stars. The Red Velvet Cheesecake should be illegal its so good. With that said, the 3 stars is for overall. First things first; I have never been here and NOT had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get a table. It is CONSTANTLY packed. When you finally do get a table, settle in, because the menu is TWELVE PAGES LONG. Yes. The food menu....for a restaurant....is 12 pages long. Its like a phone book of food choices. It is an obnoxious amount of choices.  When you make it past your 2 billion choices and settle on something, I hope youre hungry. My little brother got a starter salad, AND GOT THE HALF PORTION, and I think they brought it in a wheelbarrow. Do people seriously eat this much?! (although by looking at the usual bloated, obese Cheesecake Factory clientele, it would appear so.)  As for myself, I ordered the americana burger, medium, which came overcooked, yet still juicy.  The food is good and the dessert is transcendent. The decor is nice, but spacing between tables is kinda tight. Prices are pretty standard for going out to eat; $10-12 for a burger, and $9-12 for mixed drinks. (Full bar is a plus.) Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a very safe bet. You're almost guaranteed to find SOMETHING on their War and Peace sized menu to enjoy, and it will most likely be tasty at worst. If you can SOMEHOW save room for dessert, you will end your meal on a high note."
Leonora D.,"Sparks, NV",0,13,,5.0,7/28/2016,"Great salads - the lau salad with chicken is my favorite.  You must try their lettuce wraps.  Staff is  very friendly- my server was Gina, I must say she did an amazing job.  I will go back"
Karmen S.,"Blue Point, NY",0,3,,4.0,7/4/2016,"Typical food, nice atmosphere. I enjoyed eating a meal without vegetable oil as they used coconut and seasame for my dish."
Bet O.,"Willingboro, NJ",24,20,7,1.0,8/10/2015,"This staff here sucks . The male hostess doesn't even look up to great you . He just ask how many in your party ?No hello ,no good evening ,no whatever . I asked if I could be sat without my entire party not being present and he just ignored my question and asked ""how many in your party"" ? Very cold and robotic . Than I stepped aside as told and two people who came after me were seated before me because the first hostess did not communicate with the other hostess . While standing there I moved over so that they could see I was waiting and I was skipped AGAIN . I told the hostess I was next and a rude customer said "" I'm next she just stepped in "" um noooo I didn't cut in front of anyone so when I told the hostess that the customer got loud and rude and I had to explain what had happened and none of the hostesses apologized for the miscommunication nor defended ME for THEIR mistake . So I got cursed out for the robot up front and when i told him he just said you're table is next in his scripted voice . Ughhh I was immediately turned off . I only stayed because I had friends meeting me there from out of town . This was my second time here at this location . First time experience was for happy hour which btw isn't so bad .  On top of it all it was my friends bday and I asked the waitress to sing happy birthday but of course she forgot ;( . She apologized at the end when she gave me the bill and asked if I still wanted her to do it but at that point I was over it and over the Cheesecake Factory ."
Kathryn C.,"Woodstown, NJ",87,61,118,3.0,4/13/2014,"My daughter, mother, and I visited this location after a morning of Prom dress shopping at Jan's and the Cherry Hill Mall. We arrived around 1130, just before they started seating for lunch. We only had to wait about 3 minutes for the wait staff to wrap up their shift meeting and were quickly sat a very spacious booth. Our waitress was great and patient as their menu is a small novel! We ordered to much food but it was all delicious... Especially the. Sweet potato fries and nachos. We didn't eat much of our main courses because we wanted to save room for dessert... Opting to box those up for dinner later! Desert was good, my main complaint is on behalf of my mom who cannot eat walnuts. What is with all the walnuts???? I mean, even the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake has walnuts!! So if you have a but allergy just be aware your cheesecake options will be very very limited. All in all, good food, little pricey but a good experience. Need more cheesecake options MINUS walnuts."
Christian S.,"Evesham Township, NJ",221,382,353,3.0,10/13/2012,"I have eaten here a number of times for dinner or lunch. This review however is not about the dinner items. On this trip two weeks ago, I was here to sample the breakfast brunch for the first time. My wife ordered her usual breakfast favorite, bagel & lox platter. Besides the fact the bagel came nearly five minutes after her platter arrived, she enjoyed her breakfast. I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Now I love my pancakes cooked a little extra but these pancakes were just a little too overcooked. They were edible; but burned.   Service was decent, just felt like it was early and everyone wasn't quite awake yet. Never got a second cup of coffee."
Dana S.,"Ranger, GA",25,70,58,4.0,6/17/2015,Just what you would expect from the Cheesecake Factory great food and good service l! Had the new skinnylishous chicken salad and it was good. Saved some calories for white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake! It was better than good it was great! We sat on the patio and it was nice. It made it a little nicer because we could here each other talk.
Tiffany C.,"Philadelphia, PA",67,68,95,2.0,8/3/2015,"I will start by saying that the Cheesecake Factory is one of my most favorite restaurants. First time eating here at this location and I will probably never go back. It was very disappointing and a big let down. From all the entrées ordered, 2 out 4 were okay. The other 2 were nearly inedible. The chicken was burnt, dry and so difficult to chew. Chicken on another platter was served over pasta but on the bone. So gross. The pasta was bland and overcooked. Our server was friendly but very inattentive. We ordered immediately after sitting because we were in somewhat of a hurry. Still took over 20 minutes for our food. Another 20 minutes to get takeout containers, and another 20 to get and pay the check. The dessert of course was still amazing."
Porsha F.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",8,10,15,5.0,7/31/2015,One of my favorite spots to eat even tho it can be a bit noisy and crowded. Got their around 1pm and waited 30 mins to be seated. Got the buffalo Blasts for my appetizer and Louisiana Chicken Pasta for entree. It was soo good! Also got the strawberry lemonade to drink excellent !!
Gregory L.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",2,39,6,2.0,6/20/2015,Took an hour for our food to come out. The waitress said they ran out of burger meat after we were waiting for 45 min. They rushed the burger and it tasted cheap. Not worth $14 for this burger. The drinks are also very expensive. The waitress should have comped something or gave us a free slice of cheese cake. Bad customer service and I will most be coming back
John M.,"Southampton, PA",1,34,1,4.0,8/9/2015,Hello...dined here today at at 3pm.. I had the steak Diane which was delicious. My wife had the same and my son had the herb crusted chicken...everything was great and I couldn't have had a better experience. I've ate here many times and they never drop the ball. I will definitely be returning. I don't live near the restaurant but it's definitely worth the drive.
Tessa C.,"Dunn, NC",93,26,1,5.0,7/27/2015,I've never been disappointed. Their chicken Madeira is absolutely amazing. I always get the low carb cheesecake and it tastes as if it's full of yummy carbs!
Christian S.,"Mantua, NJ",238,14,2,5.0,5/24/2015,"Me and my girlfriend try to come here at least once a month. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone/everyone. I would highly recommend the fried macaroni and cheese balls, burgers, and pasta dinners."
Jay W.,"Westville, NJ",173,789,47,3.0,3/21/2012,"The menu is huge, with a lot of fusion between cuisines.  Its good to have a lot of choices, but it also means that there isn't really anything that they do particularly well.  I have gotten the black pepper shrimp, which is spicy enough.  The Vietnamese spring rolls are pretty good, but over priced.  The Cheesecake Factory definitely has better food than Friday's, Applebees, Chili's and the like.   Everyone always talks about the potion size at the cheesecake factory, and they are huge.  I'd recommend taking half of your food home for the next meal.   The service at the cheesecake factory can be pretty slow, it seems common for appetizers to arrive a minute before entrees, and even drinks tend to take a while.  This cheesecake factory is always busy, and you'll likely have to wait for a table. Very loud when dining."
