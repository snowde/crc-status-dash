Elli S.,"Broomall, PA",0,15,,5.0,8/27/2015,"Never had a bad experience here, or at any other location. My fiancé and I stop in plenty of times, to eat in or take out! I love the chicken piccata, so lemony and good! I get that almost every time we eat there. Service is good, very friendly staff. Sometimes I am guilty of skipping their amazing cheesecakes (only because I'm so full from my meal)  but when I do I get the Godiva cheesecake, which is amazing and super rich in flavor! I also like the tiramisu! I'm sure the others are good also!"
Nick I.,"Alexandria, VA",2,4,1,4.0,8/23/2015,This was a good place to sit down with the family and chit chat while eating. The food was very delicious and priced well. The building was a little understaffed for the number of people eating there. Not a bad Cheese Cake Factory.
Derek D.,"Evesham Township, NJ",181,6,2,3.0,3/23/2016,"Food and service was good, still find it ridiculous they don't take reservations after 5:30. It would be nice to come here and not wait over a hour for a table for once"
Chris D.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,13,1,5.0,6/1/2015,Excellent food and excellent service! This Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Every time we get a great waiter/waitress! Buffalo chicken blasts are my favorite appetizer ever! Also the brown bread is awesome and I have no ideas what it is.
Joe S.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,145,131,4.0,12/28/2013,"I would say as a first timer here it was very good. I was only a little confused as to the theme of this place because I was able to get everything from Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls to hot white chicken chili, and I mean hot. Though aside from that I can see why there is a line out the door because this place is very good and their cheesecake is as well. I recommend coming here for a nice family outing."
Brian S.,"Darby, PA",0,7,4,4.0,6/3/2014,"Tuesday night 25 min wait :( but well worth it!   They were out of a ton of items which I thought odd... Ordered cat fish... Out went with my second choice steak very, very good!  Got cheesecake to go my wife ate hers there she said it was excellent!  Atmosphere was a bit loud had a hard time hearing across the booth. Our server Emily H was excellent!! So 4 out of because they were out of chicken and catfish but great food great service"
Kimberly G.,"Newtown, PA",740,385,8,4.0,10/28/2013,"I love their skinnylicious menu!! My mom and I both ordered off it.All selections from the menu are 500 calories or less. I got the salmon and she got the Tuscan chicken. Both were super yummy!!  My only reservation about the salmon was they cooked it with the brown part on and it was a bit fishy. The BBQ burger also comes highly recommended. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She was almost too attentive. I drank half my drink and she'd just replace it. She didn't bother asking if I wanted another drink, she assumed ït was ok. I just wish she'd at least ask."
Amina W.,"Philadelphia, PA",37,97,5,4.0,4/10/2013,"This place is one of my favorites, but I can usually only stand to go for lunch since the wait time for dinner is almost always RIDIC.  Momma W. and I tend to make this our favsies mom-daughter date spot, and this Saturday was no exception. I love their new ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which gives lighter versions of menu favorites.  Most of the time I don't even realize it's been lightened up, since it's still so tasty.  There are also some great lunch specials that won't overwhelm your GI tract too. One thing I was impressed with was our server, (I believe his name was Jeremy?), who was not only crazy friendly, but looking out for us as well.  My mom had ordered a sandwich off of the skinny menu, with a bowl of soup as well... and he informed us that it would be cheaper (and the same exact thing) if she were to order the lunch special of soup and sandwich.  What a guy!  Most servers, I feel, would have just let her go with the more expensive option since a bigger bill = bigger tip.  Two thumbs up! I love, love, love the factory chopped salad (although disclaimer: the skinny version doesn't have bacon.  fail).  I've also had the chicken and avocado sandwich (phenomenal), and the chicken salad sammie (rockin).  I love the pumpernickel bread they bring out to munch on, and I also love that since Momma W. and I both ordered from the skinny menu, he asked if we wanted the bread.  OBV we want it... but it was nice that he was being conscious of our choices. The cheesecake speaks for itself... but full disclosure: I can't bring myself to order it on the regular.  My waistline just can't afford it."
Blonde K.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",37,29,11,4.0,3/27/2015,Food is always great. Service is always good. It gets very busy so I just avoid the prime times. Of course the cheesecake is yummy!
Thuy H.,"Philadelphia, PA",150,384,227,3.0,5/21/2013,"Came here on a weekend and was shocked on how fast we were sat. Normally, I'd be waiting at least half hour to over an hour, so definitely A+ to that. I had my baby with me so they were also very kind enough to give us a nice size booth so the car seat would fit in with us. Service was excellent! Everything we ordered came out at a decent time. For apps, we ordered mini crab bites and these chicken wonton things. Skip the crab bites if u plan on getting them! Extremely overpriced and they were so tiny. The chicken wonton things (forgot the names) was delicious though. It had a somewhat curry taste to it. For main meals, I ordered fish tacos and my husband ordered this spicy pasta with shrimp. They both weren't that great. I ordered my fish tacos tempura style, but when it came out, it was this heavy fried dough. Tempura is supposed to be light. They should not ask if I want it tempura or grilled. It should be wiuld u like it fried or grilled. If I knew it wasn't tempura battered, I would have gone for grilled. The tacos weren't horrible but could have been better if I actually got what I wanted. My husband's pasta was good, but he didn't like it much. He didn't think it had enough spice to it. He said he remembered it differentially. Upon leaving, we decided to order a whole cheesecake. They didn't have it ready and was completely frozen. I was a bit upset bc I couldn't eat it right when I got home, but once defrosted, it was quite delicious!! Go for the banana cream. Mmmmmm"
Kelly H.,"Stratford, NJ",23,72,44,4.0,10/29/2013,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Amazing portion sizes (you definitely get the bang for your buck), extensive menu, and delicious cheesecakes for eat-in or to-go. For $10, they even let me take home a big container of this cilantro sauce there that I am in love with. It comes with lettuce wraps, which are also amazing, by the way. Service here has always been good to me.  I just don't trust the fresh fish here. My boyfriend got the ahi tuna that they had as a special once and had warned me of its mushy consistency and bland taste. The ahi tuna tataki salad caught my eye though so against my better judgement I went against his word and got it. And low and behold, a mushy mess of tuna. And a very bad tummy ache later in the night. I firmly believe you should stick to ordering what the restaurant is good at, i.e. don't get seafood if its not a a seafood place. Just stick to the safe food at a place of this quality (easy pastas, chicken, burgers, veggie salads) and you won't be disappointed."
Jack L.,"Penn Center, Philadelphia, PA",32,7,,5.0,7/30/2014,"The beeper works all the way inside Barnes & Noble. That in itself is worth 5 stars. Oh, the 15-20 minute wait was actually only 7 minutes! (which cut into book shopping time...)"
Evan F.,"Philadelphia, PA",133,84,17,5.0,3/4/2013,"I'm a HUGE fan of The Cheesecake Factory! I've been to the Cherry Hill location twice now--and to the Buffalo, NY and Pittsburgh, PA locations numerous times--and have never left disappointed! A couple of my favorites are the Spicy Jambalaya and Bacon Blue Cheese Burger. Even the salads are amazing here! My only advice is to steer away from the specialty drinks menu-- unless you're willing to pay $7-8 per drink. Definitely check this place out! Oh, and save room for the cheesecake. You can't go wrong with a slice of the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake!"
Kathleen L.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,28,12,1.0,4/21/2013,"THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! My boyfriend and I just left the Cheesecake Factory and it was by far the worst dining experience ever. We were seated and only had knives for utensils. Then we ordered appetizers and drinks. Our drink order was right the first time and then after that the server, Nicholas M brought out the wrong drinks - not difficult, we both ordered a diet coke.  Our table was never fully cleared after our appetizers were finished. Then for the really ""great"" part of the night, our meal. After waiting for over 45 minutes (the restaurant was not nearly as crowded as I have seen it before) our food arrives. My boyfriends was right, mine on the other hand was not. I ordered the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. My ONLY request was to have penne pasta instead of fettuccine. Surprisingly enough, they gave me fettuccine.  As my boyfriend finished his meal, mine finally came, this time only about 35 minutes later. Neither time did our actual server bring us our food. I ate about three bites of my food and was so angry that I wanted to leave. I even wanted to have dessert but was so annoyed at how poorly our service was that I opted out.  But wait, it still gets better. Our bill came to $54.84, which another waiter brought us the check, maybe our original waiter saw the sheer look of disgust on my face and didn't want to hand it to us. I wish I could say the mess-ups were over but they continue. Our original waiter hands us the receipt back with our 15 cent change, clearly he couldn't do math since our bill was $54.84, making it 16 cents change. Not that I give a crap about a penny, but at least after completely ruining our evening you could hand us the right change.  Needless to say, this was the worst experience ever. And I will never be returning here again."
Jordan S.,"Philadelphia, PA",169,203,,3.0,9/26/2012,"Why do people review this place? Do any Cheesecake Factory Restaurants differ?  Long wait...longer wait on service. Have your credit card armed and ready for when the bill comes so there is no additional lag. Otherwise, GREAT, consistent, high-quality food that can be expected from Cheesecake Factory. Chicken Romano and Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake. If you have not figured out this wisdom yet, please graduate to this order soon."
Loni A.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",3,83,27,2.0,7/22/2013,"Went with my husband for lunch on a Saturday. There was a 20 minute wait (which turned out to be more like 40 minutes) and the place was packed! Decor was nice, service was pretty good. Food was eh...I've had much better at much less expensive places. Hubby got a bacon burger & calamari for an appetizer. I got a couple small plates; chicken potstickers and crab bites. Got oreo and carrot cheesecake. All just ok. Nothing to write home about. We had 2 drinks and our total BEFORE tip was $93! For lunch! Way too expensive for the quality of food.  One more thing. The seating is like a long bench on one side and chairs lined up on the other. You are sitting VERY close to your neighbor so if you're looking for privacy, don't go here!! You will, however, be able to hear every single word of their conversations.  Totally underwhelmed and won't be returning."
Steph T.,"Riverside, NJ",0,7,,3.0,2/23/2015,"This place is always packed, no matter what time or day of the week you go there. The menu is huge which is a good and a bad thing. There's something for everyone, but trying to decide what to order is hard when the menu is so extensive. I did have a bad experience once, and was a little peeved that the manager didn't even come out to speak with us. We ordered chicken wings, and they were not fully cooked, and raw near the bone. The waitress just took the food back and took it off the wings off the bill. Maybe I've been spoiled at other places I've been to, but I expected the manager to come out and apologize."
Amber R.,"Browns Mills, NJ",6,4,,4.0,2/19/2015,"Came here last weekend for lunch. It was a Sunday and it took about 10 minutes just to find parking. The wait given was about a half hour which was accurate. I spent that time browsing all the cheese cakes in the case. Yum! Once seated, service was fast and the server was nice. I ordered the tomato basil pasta- always delicious. I also ordered an app of tempura shrimp. It said it was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't spicy at all- which was fine with me, but could upset someone else since it is advertised that way. the other person with me had the lunch portion of orange chicken which was done perfectly- portion was way more than any lunch portion should be- perfect for leftovers. I also ordered a slice of regular cheesecake with cherries to go. Always worth it. Overall, good experience, just hate the wait and parking situation."
Jen M.,"Deptford, NJ",121,89,10,2.0,7/2/2014,The food is good. They give big portions but WTF!!! The service Sucks.  Ain't nobody got time fo' dat.
Gabriel D.,"Longmont, CO",33,159,25,1.0,6/9/2014,The restaurant is expensive for the kind of food they serve. I ordered a pasta with chicken (Louisiana style) and an iced tea and ended up paying 25$ with a tip. This was my first time here and i feel like they completely robbed me.
