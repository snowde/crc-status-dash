Anand T.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",24,52,21,5.0,5/12/2013,what can I say about this place it has  arguably the best dessert around and that is CHEESECAKE!!! I love everything about this place the food is fantastic my recommendation is the Chicken Bellagio it has two chicken breast that is coated on top of a big portion of Arugula Salad. They have a wide array of cheesecake but the one that I always get is the snickers cheesecake my opinion it's the best one but like i said they have a wide array but from the one's that I've tried the snickers won me over. the food is fantastic like the chicken bellagio and the bang bang shrimp and chicken but def come for the cheesecake you will not be sorry.
Jacquie B.,"Toms River, NJ",35,11,2,1.0,3/11/2014,"So disappointed in my visit yesterday.  I've been to the one in Freehold many times, this was my 2nd time to Cherry Hill.  Ordered my favorite dish that I've had at least 5 or 6 times over the years at Freehold - the Wasabi Crusted Tuna.  It's one of the higher prices meals at $22, but so worth it.... But NOT yesterday.  My mother was with me & we both ordered the tuna.  Server was pleasant & attentive, very nice.  Wasn't a long wait to be seated or to get our meals.  It was early - just before 5pm (body clocks at 4pm with daylight savings) - so it was not busy yet.  Meals came & the tuna (which should come rare - as described in menu & how it's always been when I've gotten it before) was cooked well done - I'm talking the look of canned tuna well done!  It happens, our server sees, apologizes & brings both dinners back.  Manager comes over apologizes & says he will assure our meal comes out correct.  Not too long a wait & our waitress is back - the tuna now has BARELY touched the grill & is completely raw & cold - not cool/room temp, like I've ALWAYS had it before, where it has a nice sear on both sides, but red in the CENTER - nope!  Red Raw all around the edges.  I could not cut through it with my dinner knife raw! In the past I've worked at fine dining restaurants, and I know the kitchen can get pissy when food is sent back.  Like it's a personal insult.  I really felt like the Raw Tuna was an FU to us - ""these bitches want rare?  I'll give 'em rare!""   No, what I wanted was it how it is suppose to be prepared!  How I've had it so many times before!  Someone should really get ahold of their staff with attitudes!  Allow me to enlighten the average restaurant patron on something... MOST patrons will take this out on their server - who has NO control over the asshats with egos in the kitchen!  Those very asshats get an hourly wage - they get paid no matter if you like your food or not.  But your server, who bears the brunt of your frustration due to receiving two plates of ill prepared food, gets yelled at, gets the complaints...and usually in the end - gets a crappy tip!  You know they only make $2 -$3 per hour, heck 20 years ago, when I waitresses, I made $2.25 per hour.  They depend on tips! But those asshats in the kitchen get minimum wage at least, most get more!  It's WRONG!!! The waitress apologized again, took the food.  I was over it!  Tried not to take it out on her, I ordered a dinner salad.  Great ""dinner"" at Cheesecake Factory"" - NOT!  Manager came back, apologized, offered to have asshats in kitchen make it a 3RD TIME.  No Thanks!  Spit comes with a 3rd dish, or a swipe on the floor before it hits the grill - I worked in restaurants... I've seen it happen!  I tried to explain this concept to the manager about retaliative kitchen staff(I didn't call them asshats to him), but he replied, ""well, I don't know what kind of restaurants you worked in before, but it's not our policy"". Yeah, NO KIDDING!  It's nobodies policy!  It's the asshat in the kitchen of your upscale CHAIN RESTAURANT, who thinks his mistake is my problem to choke down.  It's his inflated ego, thinking he's actually a ""chef"" who knows how to create new & flavorful, delicious gourmet meals...when in reality, he is a connect the dots ""cook"" - take meat A & add premade sauce B, cook for x minutes with C cooking method - dump on plate!  That's why it's always been good when I had it in the past!  Follow 3 or 4 steps - comes out exactly as it should!  My guess is someone didn't pay attention to the ""x minutes"" the first time - but PURPOSELY under cooked the second time... To show me!  I just wanted it done how it was suppose to be done!   So my mom ate 1/2 her raw fish, saying - I like sushi, and I've never had it before...so I don't know the difference.  Well, I like sushi too...but I didn't order sushi. The waitress got tipped on a dinner & a salad (but they didn't charge me for my salad), even though she technically did the work of waiting on us twice & brought us 4 dinners... So you see, she lost out - her pay was docked....but the ASSHAT in the kitchen will cash his full paycheck on Friday!  It's just wrong!!!!"
Linda F.,"Collingswood, NJ",5,23,2,5.0,7/8/2012,I have never had a bad meal here at this location (or any other). Whoever has been with me has always been very pleased with their meals as well.  $$$ Value for the portions (always enough for lunch next day) is well spent.  Drinks are expensive but top notch quality (I guess you do get what you pay for sometimes!)  Service is always excellent.  Of course the cheesecake is to die for.  The tasty bread is just a bonus.  My favorite at the moment are the Tai Chicken Lettuce Wraps that I order as my meal.  Bathrooms are always clean.  My only complaint would be they charge $3 for a cup of coffee and charge for refills. I do not order coffee when I go.
Yun K.,"Toa Baja, Puerto Rico",1,5,1,4.0,9/8/2013,"Good variety of wine and spirits. They know how to blend drinks really good. Great food quality, specially good price appetizers."
Nik K.,"Newark, NJ",0,49,13,2.0,9/13/2015,"Visited cheese cake factory in Cherry Hill because we had a $100 gift card. I remember when there used to be only one cheese cake factory in the area, and that was in King of Prussia. I used to love visiting this chain. However, the quality has gone down significantly. During our most recent visit we ordered the firecracker salmon appetizer, which was pretty tasty, so we were excited to get our entrees. I ordered the jambalaya with white rice (instead of pasta). My boyfriend ordered a special pesto tilapia which came with mashed potatoes, tomatoes, in a pesto sauce. He liked his entree. Mine was below mediocre. My entree arrived and looked like chicken, tomatoes, shrimp, with peppers, and onions on a bed of rice. There was absolutely no spice at all. If I had a stomach virus, I could have eaten this entree with no problem. It was bland, unseasoned, and just a big plate of nothingness. I asked our waitress for extra sauce. I was told it would take a few minutes. A gentleman arrived 10 minutes later with a bowl of hot liquid with more tomatoes. Great, is what I thought until I poured the alleged sauce over the jambalaya. I tasted the entree again and was met with the same disappointment. More blandness with even more tomatoes. I finally asked for a to-go container so I could take the entree home and fix it myself. I sat while my boyfriend finished his food. The waitress returned with a to-go box and never even asked if we liked our entrees. I'm pretty sure she didn't really care to hear what we had to say. She was more interested in offering desert. Needless to say, we spent $97 out of the $100 gift card and don't care to return to this place again."
Sok P.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,11,26,1.0,4/17/2014,"Arrived at 830, 10 minute wait, that wasn't bad. Placed order at 850. Now it's 930. That's ridiculously long, server told me my fish and chips order ""was not to his or her liking, so it had to be remade"" not too happy after the long wait. Servers not attentive."
Nicole G.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,2,3.0,9/27/2013,"The food here never disappoints. However, my 3-stars is for poor service. The waiter seemed overwhelmed. My husband and me had to constantly remind her to bring our drinks, napkins, utensils, etc.  She kept forgetting to bring things that we had asked for. As one example; I requested extra sauce for my side order of calamari but of course she forgot to bring it. This happened about five different times. I understand the place was packed (t was a Saturday evening and our wait time was 40 minutes). However, that is never an excuse to be incompetent. I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's really the only chain restaurant that I like to go to but I prefer the one located in the King of Prussia Mall. They are always crowded but their SERVICE is always GREAT!!"
Shellie W.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,24,4,4.0,8/27/2014,"Always delicious and food coma inducing, just like it should be! Went with a party of 9 for my birthday and they told us that they don't take reservations after 5, so a table large enough to accommodate us may not be available. Pretty weird to me! However we did get a table, had a great server, and a great time. Best part is, I have enough leftovers to enjoy it AGAIN!"
Scott K.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",1,2,1,1.0,10/6/2014,"Absolutely inconsistent and disgusting.  I ordered orange chicken which I've gotten before at a different location.  This order was nothing like I received in Atlanta.  Half of the pieces had sauce on them, burnt at the edges, crunchy and stale.  Worse representative of orange chicken I've ever witnessed. Save your money."
S J.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",15,17,112,3.0,7/27/2014,Had a great time tonight !  Good company . I was seated within 10 minutes of arriving. The waitress Emily was new but was very helpful.
Laura C.,"Bangor, ME",0,2,,2.0,9/12/2014,"Food was awesome and was immediately seated.  The service however, sucked. The service was so bad that we asked for our check and to take our food to go shortly thereafter being served.  We wanted dessert but didn't wanted to be waited on the said sucky server so we just went to the to go counter and took our dessert home. Won't be back."
Sovanny B.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,44,,2.0,5/3/2014,Pretty bad service. The one in Willow Grove does a better job (although not that great either). The food is nothing special.
Nicole G.,"Berkeley Township, NJ",4,17,1,3.0,6/2/2014,"First time ever eating at a Cheesecake Factory. It was good! My daughter and I each had a Little Caesar Salad (not on the menu, our server Quentin told us about it!) and we shared the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip and the Buffalo Blasts. Portions were very good, especially the ""little"" salad, it wasn't little at all! Quentin was very attentive and friendly. Large menu to choose from, a bit overwhelming. Unfortunately our food was so filling we didn't have room for cheesecake! Maybe next time!"
Rizwan A.,"Philadelphia, PA",82,199,32,5.0,8/24/2011,"That's right- I gave the cheesecake factory 5 stars. It is exactly as the description for 5 stars says- as good as it gets. This is my idea of a perfect restaurant. Affordable, GREAT food, great ingredients, great desserts, tons of booths, so many different kinds of food, great for any occasion, great service, and tons of locations.  First of all- I have never been to a place where out of 500 entrees, every entree has been delicious. Not only that, but whether you get American, Chinese, Mexican, Thai, etc etc, it is actually made really well and rivals any restaurant of similar ethnic food. The Guacamole here is some of the best I've ever had. If you think that's a joke, go try it for yourself. If you still don't believe me then you just don't know guac. The nachos are also great. The avacado egg rolls, the southwest egg rolls, and calamari are pretty great too. Some people are all about the bread- I don't see how it's so amazing but I do like it anyway. Another thing I love- consistency. I can order the same entree any any cheesecake factory all across America (and I have) and it tastes just as good anywhere. Same thing goes for the cheesecakes and the entire menu. The portions are huge, I usually end up taking food home.  Some of my favorites (including everything above): 1. Baja tacos 2. Green Chile Cheeseburger 3. Chicken and Biscuits 4. Thai Style Chicken Pasta 5. Key Lime Cheesecake Everything here is awesome. Hands down- my favorite restaurant."
Nessa S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,10,4.0,3/28/2013,"Went for my Lucky 30th B-day food was great! Would definitly return & kids really enjoyed it as well......dessert , mayb nxt time.  Big portions"
Anna F.,"Charleston, WV",1,5,,5.0,8/17/2014,"I was so surprised that the Cheesecake Factory has the best veggie salad I've ever had and a fabulous veggie burger!  So if you are a vegetarian, you can eat here and leave full.  A burger is still a burger but it's meat free!"
Karen F.,"Media, PA",2808,3911,7,3.0,8/28/2009,"The food was surprisingly really GOOD for a chain and the decor was nice enough.  Service was good as well - but the noise level?  Deafening and the place was loaded with kids - mine included. The veggie salad is great - and it's enormous - 2 of us shared it easily with leftovers. And for $7 a slice - the ginormous piece of Red Velvet Cheesecake (sooooo good) was enough for 3. This was (shockingly) my first EVER visit here - and I really liked it.  Not a healthy place, as Michelle C. says - but tasty grub for sure and not too pricey.  (Save for the cheesecake.)"
Mini P.,"Society Hill, Philadelphia, PA",61,42,84,5.0,11/5/2013,"Yes its a chain restaurant but by far, one of the best chain restaurants out there! I have only been to the location in Cherry Hill. The wait time is always ridiculously long and everytime  we ridiculously wait! The restaurant itself is huge! It has some pretty interesting decor to look at as well. Huge romanesque pillars with touches of egyptian architecture really make this place look exotic but it has a more casual, warm and inviting feel. The menu is vast! I never know what to get which can sometimes be good and bad! I like the creativity and thought behind all of the menu options. They have everything from mexican to italian choices with all american dishes as well! Pretty much whatever you have a hankering for, I am sure you will find it at TCF. Besides all of their yummy choices, they are more known for their cheescakes! Every cheescake combination you can think of, I am sure they have it! Im a simple gal so I always go for the plain cheescake topped with strawberries and whipped cream which is always oh so good! When I am feeling a little naughty, I go with the red velvet cheescake! Ultimate yum! Everything is well priced and the portions are HUGE so you might want to share with someone. Service has always been above and beyond! Even though the wait time is long, once you are seated everything comes out promptly! I really love this place! If you must chain, link into this place!"
Alyssa T.,"Kensington, Philadelphia, PA",0,3,1,5.0,3/3/2013,"I am never disappointed when I come here. I've gotten the filet mignon, which was butterflied and it was DELICIOUS.  They serve you a roll of some kind of brown bread (honey wheat, I want to say) and white bread, the brown bread is SOOOO good. Every time I go, I get the crab bites (tiny crab cakes) as an appetizer, it comes with a delicious dipping sauce. If you go, try a sour apple martini. They are TO DIE FOR."
David K.,"Maple Shade Township, NJ",1,43,,4.0,6/7/2015,"There's lots of times we'd go but just don't because of the mobs of people.  When we go we sit outside.  Even picking up can be arduous.  Bottom line is they can afford to deliver and should do so.  I'd otherwise give it five stars for food and drink variety and quality and service.  Favorites are the Oriental Chicken Salad, or Ricotta Pancakes for brunch."
