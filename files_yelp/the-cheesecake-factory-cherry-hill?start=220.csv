Candace S.,"Washington, DC",54,7,19,5.0,8/23/2013,Service was excellent our server was Cali she was awesome. There was no wait food came fast we had the Cajun chicken littles with a side of mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese and the crispy crab cake littles with a side Caesar salad. For dessert we had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake...DELISH!!
Meg F.,"Collingswood, NJ",38,168,4,2.0,2/22/2013,"Went here for lunch with seven coworkers. Everyone seemed to be content with their meal, but I wasn't completely happy with my Santa Fe skinnylicious salad. Six hours later and I am still super thirsty due to my super salty salad. Meh. I am really not a fan of chain restaurants..."
Kathleen M.,"Woodbury, NJ",0,6,,2.0,10/1/2010,This place is too much like a cafeteria to me.  Nothing like being rushed to order your food (menu is huge and confusing - so many types of food/brunch/dinner items...almost like a diner).  Order an appetizer and entree and having them delivered almost within 10 minutes of each other.   Too noisy...place is popular and many families dine here so if you have kids it's ok.  But if you are out on a date and looking for a quiet dinner for 2 then look elsewhere.  Their cheesecakes are awesome....but the over rating is fair....would return but not on the top of my list.
EricaLynn J.,"Elkins Park, PA",387,793,34,4.0,5/20/2008,"I think sometimes people forget what defines a chain restaurant as a chain!  A chain restaurant, even the most high-end ones, needs to maintain its identity no matter where it may be located.  The food needs to pretty much taste the same on your plate as a person's plate across the country.  That being said, The Cheesecake Factory in Cherry Hill is one of the great ones, that stands out from its other identically-dressed sisters.  Why? Because of the x-factors:  the service is usually top-notch, the parking lot is ample, and since any seasoned Cheesecake Factory diner knows that there will always be a wait, no matter what day it is (unless you go for lunch on an off-hour...seriously, try that) it helps that there is a budding shopping center growing around it, that keeps opening up new stores at a rapid pace!   If you're not familiar with the menu, here's the real deal:  you can basically eat any cuisine there.  So if you are in the mood for anything, and you feel like plunking down some money for a somewhat costly meal, head on over, put your name on the list, grab a menu, and find your match.  You wanted Asian? There's a salad and entree that will be good for that.  You wanted Italian?  There's an entire page of that.  Thai?  Go right ahead and turn that page... there it is.  Once you've browsed the menu, go outside and shop!  Or look at some of the interesting people you'll soon be dining with.  This *is* South Jersey, you know.   By the time your name is called, you'll have a fantastic meal planned out and, adding to the mystery of the long wait, your service will be pretty darn quick!"
Choji S.,"Voorhees, NJ",0,32,,4.0,3/17/2013,"I stick to 2 dishes here, fried fish tacos and the crispy chicken littles. Dessert is the chocolate cheesecake and a cappuccino. Delicious. Service is always friendly and atmosphere is clean and chill. I recommend the spot."
Jerry W.,"Philadelphia, PA",160,98,27,3.0,6/23/2012,"First thing I have to say, super-expensive. Ordered a nacho platter, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes. The nacho platter was pretty much nachos and cheese whiz. Meatloaf was fatty. Mashed potatoes were more boiled potatoes than they were mashed. When the waiter saw I didn't really touch my food, he offered me to eat something else. I went with the chicken fingers, which I didn't see on the menu but he said they have some items they don't list. I got them, they weren't bad, similar to Church's chicken, but much more expensive. They didn't charge me for the food I didn't eat. Cheesecake is amazing. Get the cheesecake and that's about it."
Carina C.,"Jersey City, NJ",48,84,29,1.0,11/15/2010,"I will admit, I loved this place when there were only 2 in the area (King of Prussia and Menlo Park). I got a bit excited when I heard they had one in Cherry Hill. Portions are large (always taking some home) Wait is FOREVER (we found that standing by the bar area is first come first serve) Ah the discoveries, the 4 cheese pasta, the bar... Soon, everyone wanted to come here for EVERY occasion. The haze began to clear...my taste buds started to scream at me. ... This food is not even that good! I cannot even vouch for one meal.  I refuse to come here now. Ok, I really like that black bread. That might be the best part of that place now, but not worth coming back to."
Brent M.,"MULLICA HILL, NJ",6,37,,4.0,12/18/2012,Each entree enough to feed a small village.
Marc D.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,116,6,2.0,3/17/2012,"The food is overpriced for the quality.  And, nothing appeals to me on the menu, especially since they removed the delicious(but wayyy overpriced) ribs off the menu."
Caitlin C.,"PA, PA",242,395,721,5.0,2/14/2007,"Go to the KOP location - I think it may be closer. No matter when you come here there is always a 2 hour wait - even on Wednesdays! The reason? Their menu covers every cuisine under the sun and they seem to have every type of chef back their perfecting their own dishes.  No matter who you are you will find something here: pastas, hamburgers, comfort food, wraps and fish. My favorite is the Navajo sandwich (warm pita with mayo, chicken and fresh avocado) or the Da Vinci pasta. You should never leave without at least getting a slice of their famous cheesecake. In my opinion, the White Chocolate Raspberry is the best."
Greg P.,"Haddonfield, NJ",1,45,,3.0,2/14/2014,"A good place for Lunch with Business Associates or Friends but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated if you don't get there early as the place is always crowded. Food is very good, albeit a bit on the mid-level pricey side. Also watch out for those calories and carbos! Yes their food tastes good but it comes at a price, your waistline if you make it a habit of eating here. Service can be a bit slow but they deliver good food while you're waiting. Enjoy the room and relax talk with friends while you're waiting for your food. Parking in the adjacent lots is a nightmare. Suggest you drive around the back of the shopping ctr, behind Barnes & Noble, where there's a big and often half-empty lot used by the employees. There is a well-lit access tunnel linking the two. Also the parking garage is a good alternate. Overall a good place to eat, but watch those calories and be sure to park at the alternate locations I've noted."
Jenn W.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",621,602,86,4.0,2/22/2010,"This chain has been around for many years, must be doing something right, Nationwide, & been to many locations .Haven't let me down yet in service or food.Drinks are great!! Went to one San Diego, Los Angles, Florida, Near Ft .Lauderdale, &  Baltimore. Huge menu..but again not too bad for chain restaurant. Go again, but sometimes the lines are long, get pager, wait up to 1 hour.."
Jeff P.,"Atlantic City, NJ",17,34,16,3.0,9/5/2009,"I've read alot about the wait here but I personally haven't experienced it. This could be because I have only been here at lunchtime. I've been here a number of times and had either the Factory Burger, pretty good, or the Santa Fe Salad. The ""lunch"" version of the Santa Fe Salad is mountainous and I cannot imagine how bug the dinner version is. I like it because it has lots of stuff in addition to the lettuce - black beans, corn, chunks of chicken - to make it actually feel like I've had a real meal. Yes, it's noisy, but for the most part pretty good. The service is friendly and attentive."
Donald L.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",37,6,,5.0,1/8/2013,"A year ago, on the occasion of our 20th wedding anniversary, my wife and I had a great dinner at The Cheesecake Factory in Cherry Hill. One year later, on our 21st anniversary, we went back. A tradition has begun! Here are my thoughts from our most recent romantic visit. We dumped the kids at the home of some excellent friends, and arrived at the restaurant about 2PM on a Sunday afternoon. Incidentally, though kids are welcome at the Cheesecake Factory, I think it would be hard to enjoy myself there with our 4 kids in tow. Our kids are pretty well behaved, but even still, I'd worry about them disturbing other restaurant guests, and that would keep me from relaxing and enjoying myself. Also, it's a bit expensive to take kids there. Honestly, my kids would be just as happy at the golden arches... We were told our wait would be 20 minutes. Turned out to be only 8. Not bad. That's just enough time to peer into the cheesecake cooler and decide what to have for dessert. (More on that later....) The atmosphere is loud, but that actually works to your advantage inasmuch as the noise level allows your conversation to be private. Surrounding conversations are simply part of the room noise, and that's important since tables are spaced pretty close together. Some reviews I've read complain about the 19-page menu and the insane number of food choices. I personally love lots of choices. Heck, this is America, and freedom of choice is what we love, like one of those inalienable rights! I chose the Sausage and Broccolini Pasta. That was a real winner. Perfect pasta, fresh veggies, good flavor. The dinner portion was a lot of food, but I could handle it! My wife chose the Hibachi steak, accompanied by mash potatoes with wasabi butter and tempura asparagus. I sampled her steak, which was good. But I don't get the idea of deep-fried asparagus. Whatever. Our server was very pleasant and did a fine job. Knowing that we loved that brown bread they serve, I think she included some extra bread in our doggy-bag.  And then, of course, there's the cheesecake. My wife went for the Tuxedo Cheesecake, which she loved, but I took a simpler approach: the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  My wife commented, (but without a trace of criticism) that my selection seemed a bit ""boring."" Maybe so. I admit to being much less adventuresome.  But for me, I needed purity of flavor at that point. And vanilla is never wrong. Remember that. I was quite satisfied. Based on a fantastic experience of great food and a new yearly anniversary tradition with the love of my life, The Cheesecake Factory is nothing but happiness for me."
Theresa M.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",5,54,22,5.0,4/17/2012,"Hadn't been here in a while and wishing id never stopped going. Dinner was awsome. bread was good, I had one of my fav's steak diane and shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. The pesto sauce was awsome. Steak was yummy, tender and perfectly cooked. I dont know why its hard for other restaurants to cook a Medium steak the right way. Got the Ritz martini and it was awsome! i love champagne and they put just the right amount. We didn't get away cheap but it was well worth it. 2 entrees, 2 alcohol drinks, 2 pieces of cheesecake and a soda $78.00. Id pay it again anyday. My bf loved it. It was his first time. We went around 5:00 and didn't have to wait at all for a seat. It wasn't too packed but it was a Monday night. Also, the waitor Brian was really nice and attentive. Ive never had a bad experience here, yet."
Kathy M.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",6,29,,4.0,6/27/2010,"I have visited this place several times and enjoy it.  The menu is extensive (21 pages plus specials).  The food is not stellar (and I would not expect it to be from a chain restaurant), but it is pretty good and there is plenty of it.  A person with a medium appetite or less with probably have enough for 2 meals.  I find their shrimp roll appetizer to be especially good. As for the other stuff.  The building itself is beautiful and has indoor and outdoor dining (although the view is a parking lot).  Some of the tables tend to be very close together, especially the tables that accommodate 2 diners.  The restaurant is also very noisy and there tends to be a wait (sometimes a ridiculously long wait) at busy times so I avoid prime times like Saturday nights.  Oh, and the cheesecake is good too."
Robin S.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",3,216,,4.0,6/3/2012,"I've been to A LOT of Cheesecake Factory restaurants in the area and this one is by far my favorite.  Service has always been good and I guess this place is good on staffing because I never get the impression that my server is handling 10 tables at once and super stressed out. (Either that or they are very good at keeping all of their tables under control.) I hate the tables where you are a foot away from the couple next to you but I know that's a corporate decision as every C.F. is like that. Never had to wait too, too long here for a table. 20, 25 minutes tops."
Tomia S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,9,1,2.0,7/7/2015,"I'm a regular at CCF, but I usually frequent the one in Willow Grove. This was only my second time to the one in Cherry Hill. We went here for a special occasion and we were seated immediately; surprisingly,  it wasn't overly packed and/or busy. I did not like our server, Desiree, at all. She had a very flat affect, standoffish attitude, and seemed to pre judge us maybe because we looked young (possibly). I'm not sure, but I'll leave it at that. She walked past our table so many times before introducing herself as our server. We waited patiently and I even went to the bathroom and she still hadn't stopped at the table. She is the worst server at CCF I've had in the past 5 years. Desiree finally asked us about drink orders after about 8 minutes and it took forever for us to receive bread. Desiree may require additional training with serving and cultural diversity. We ordered the Fries Mac and Cheese balls which were scrumptious! For entrees we ordered the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp & Chicken (my absolute fav). I rated the visit a 3 only because the food was very tasty. Now that I think of it, Desiree never even asked how everything tasted or if everything was ok. Sadly, I have to change my rating to a 2. She had absolutely below subpar service. I usually order my Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake and eat a little while I'm there and take the rest to go, but I didn't want to increase her tip by anymore because she SUCKED. So I purchased cheesecake at the counter. I usually tip minimum of 20% because I was a former server... The only reason she got over a 15% tip is because I don't believe in not leaving a tip... Maybe I should've abandoned my morals this one time. I will not be frequenting CCF in Cherry Hill anytime in the near future."
Fatty D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,280,,3.0,8/7/2011,"I like this chain. It is what it is, not gourmet not fast food and doesn't pretend to be. Hamburger was juicy and cooked as ordered. Fettuccine Alfredo was good. (just as good as many Italian places I have eaten at) Service was quick and friendly. Value was decent. What do people expect?"
Louise J.,"Skåne län, Sweden",0,14,,4.0,4/27/2014,"Love their pasta carbonara!! My dad tried steak (unfortunately I can't remember which one, but it was delicious..). I have always had good experiences here. It is very loud in there though, but it is a big restaurant and lots of people fit there. The staff is always very friendly!"
