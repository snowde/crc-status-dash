Deborah R.,"Riverton, NJ",1,132,,5.0,7/11/2012,"Arrived here at 12:30 for lunch  with my mother. We were seated immediately. We were greeted by our waitress in about  three minutes. (Nice.) We were immediately offered bread, but we declined. We ordered iced teas with extra lemon and splenda which came out quickly as ordered. Refreshing iced tea! Brewed in house I believe. We both ordered from the ""Skinnylicous"" Menu. We had the Chicken Salad sandwiches, which were on very nice bread. It comes mixed with a little mayo, celery and sliced almonds. It's also served with a fresh, green salad, which was also good. We had the honey citrus dressing. A very enjoyable lunch. Extra points for the ""Skinnylicious"" Menu, which offers meals under 590 calories, and several cocktails for under 150 calories. Of course, they still offer their regular, plentiful menu as well."
Vlad K.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",71,206,70,1.0,8/11/2009,"I heard about Cheesecake Factory alot. Finally once they opened a location near us we went to check it out. The wait was too long, the place was too crowded and really overpriced... and food itself was barely okay... even the cheesecakes, which you'd think would be good, were average at best... Don't waist your time..."
Mayra B.,"Burlington, NJ",1,6,,2.0,9/18/2012,"I was a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and I hadn't been there for a while. We went last night to celebrate my friend's birthday and it was so disappointing! The avocado rolls were horrendous, lots of avocado and no flavor. I ordered Baja chicken tacos and there was very little chicken in them; rice was horrible, like it had been sitting out for a day or two. Portions are smaller, even for their cheesecakes, and prices have gone up. Service was average. With so many other new options around, I probably wouldn't go back."
C M.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,5,3,4.0,2/12/2012,"My favorite restaurant, fried Mac n cheese for appetizer, factory meat loaf for entre, and for dessert any cheesecake well do, you can't go wrong."
Jill F.,"Sicklerville, NJ",62,20,,3.0,5/28/2009,"I've been hearing about the Cheesecake Factory for YEARS, and just recently went for the first time the other night.  I know it's just a chain, but I have to say, I was pretty impressed.   First of all, I always heard about the terribly long wait from other people, but when we got there, it was pretty crowded, but not too bad at all.  They told us the wait was about 15 minutes, and the actual wait time wound up being about 7.  We were only a party of two, so we had to sit in an akward section, very close to the people next to us on either side.  I know they must just try to jam as many people as possible in there, but it was to the point where if I got a little too Italian waving my hands around while talking, I would have slapped the guy next to me in the face.  It was also incredibly loud, to the point where I couldn't hear my boyfriend across the table, or our waiter. The food, though, was very good.  Their portions are HUGE and I could barely finish half of the burger I ordered.  And the cheesecake is out of this world, as it should be, given the name of the place.   So why three stars?  Well, minus one for the close proximity to other guests and the loudness.  But you also have to take into account the price - The two of us got an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert for $75.  It was yummy, but for that kind of cash, you could probably go somewhere a bit fancier, quieter, and non-chain restaurantish and leave a little happier.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and intend to go back....  But only once, maybe twice a year.  And only after being paid a bonus or stumbling upon extra money."
Sally V.,"Philadelphia, PA",74,32,4,5.0,3/24/2011,Yummy...large portions of food....i can never finish....but...they have good malibu bay breeze
Rich R.,"Moorestown, NJ",0,223,11,3.0,10/23/2011,"Very busy place, food was excellent but they give you too much food unless you want to take it home and eat the same thing twice. Server appeared rushed, drink prices were not listed on the menu for a good reason; an glass of ""exotic"" Yuengling was $6.50. Highest I've paid anywhere. Microbrews were probably a lot more."
Lynda Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",177,462,510,4.0,7/29/2011,"I'm not a lover or hater of chain restaurants. I'm sorta middle of the road with them. One of the better ones is defiantly The Cheesecake Factory. I usually order the same thing when I go, but my friends order different things all the time. Not once have I or any of my friends ever been disappointed by this particular location. I order the Chicken Romano which is a GIANT piece of breaded chicken with spaghetti and some kind of blush gravy. The chicken is kind of on the bland side, but that pasta more than makes up for it. If you order it, just ask for a little side dish of the gravy and put it right on that chicken! It has an amazingly good flavor that I'm addicted to. The little bread they give you with the oats on top is super yummy and the cheesecake (if you have room after those huge portions) are no joke! They're damn delicious. I usually take half my meal and half of my cheesecake home for lunch the next day. Service is always fast and friendly and the prices are right where they should be. Overall, I love this place."
Andrea T.,"Philadelphia, PA",281,573,63,4.0,3/15/2009,Hello people wake the hell up it's a chain with cheesecake. Stop making it out to be a bistro or something it's not! I had a pleasant brunch there with my mother this morning. Little secret. They open right at 10 on sunday for brunch and we had no wait. Try to get there between 10-1030 and there is no wait which is generally NOT the case. They have a brunch menu along with the rest of the menu. My mother had a great belgian waffle and I had fish taco's. As usual the portions are huge. I had the strawberry shortcake which is delightful. Their vanilla ice cream is divine.  It's cherry hill for godsakes people.
patricia c.,"Philadelphia, PA",120,21,3,4.0,2/1/2011,"My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. I guess they don't take reservations on the weekend. We waited for at least an hour and a half. The place was packed. The wait, for us, was deff worth it. We tried their spinach dip, I had the Bang bang Chicken & shrimp, and the upside down pineapple cheesecake. The entree was a huge portion, it lasted me about three more servings after I took it home. Very good food. Wait, not so good."
Angela N.,"Toms River, NJ",15,26,,4.0,9/20/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is always a good stand-by place.  The portions are ridiculously huge, and I've never had a bad dish.  This location gets pretty crowded, so go in early."
Kev S.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,5,,1.0,1/28/2011,"nope. I'll admit I high expectations coming into this chain the other night with my girlfriend for dinner service. terrible. huge menu. too expansive. it felt like i was ordering food from a diner or something. they should keep it simple so they could focus on a few good dishes. any chef or cook for that matter should be able to make some sort of good food which was the next huge issue! my order of chicken carbonara was very bland. the chicken was rough and overcooked and the portion was huge and unimpressive. my girlfriend ordered some sort of cajun chicken over penne which just to be completely honest had absolutely no flavor to it. when i hear cajun my mind jumps to big flavors, smoky and robust! there was nothing but heat. and a lot of heat. enough to kill any sort of palette you could hope to use to enjoy any meal! no substance no redeeming value completely inedible im sure there was some sort of idea in the kitchen that this dish would be sub par when almost immediately after serving the food the waitress came to ask how the dish was cooked. after about three bites we left. i would have expected much better for the price in this place. i would have expected at least something i could eat. would never go back"
Caryn Liz F.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",18,7,,1.0,9/29/2012,"The rudest staff of any Cheesecake Factory we have ever been to. Today was our last visit to this location. When we came in we asked for a warmer table as we had forgotten our sweaters and it was FREEZING inside. The hostess rolled her eyes and said it will get warmer later. I said, maybe but it's really rather cold now. She rolled her eyes AGAIN so we decided it was too 'chilly' for us, excused ourselves and as we were turning to leave she SLAMMED the menus on the counter. We would have stayed to eat if she hasn't kept rolling her eyes at us... We were just wondering where the warmest spot was. It really is one of those places where they keep it way too cold. I understand the staff gets hot when they work, but since when does the comfort of waiters come above the paying customers. And there's no reason to roll your eyes at someone hoping for a heater or a spot near the kitchen where it might be a bit warmer. Unbelievable."
Cliff C.,"Philadelphia, PA",134,85,36,5.0,4/22/2009,"I am not hating Chains , because they give employment to the average joes like me who cannot afford to set up shop and be my own boss. I have eaten here 4 times in a span of 3 weeks and what did I get  food that keeps you coming back and a free slice of cheesecake(try the cookie dough cheesecake) Their chicken fingers(my son had to share it with me) is huge and the sauce great. Their Chicken specialties with Pasta and the Castoletta was superb, you will have no room for it expect the take out box. The burgers here are great too. The hustle and bustle says its got to be good and the only down side is the wait but hey its worth it."
David J.,"Bensalem, PA",0,9,,1.0,11/18/2013,"I've had better food at less expensive restaurants. My gumbo had over-cooked shrimp and under cooked rice. The slice of cheesecake that I payed 8 bucks for was nothing special. The seating is horrible!!! There is a long bench against a wall with chairs on the opposite side with very small tables in between. Other guests might as well sit on your lap the seating is so tight! You will hear every detail of their conversation. The staff are dressed in all white, showing  the stains from grease and  food.  I will not be visiting a cheesecake factory again."
Gina P.,"S HARRISN TWP, NJ",0,2,,5.0,7/9/2013,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for my 21st birthday with my parents. The staff was very friendly, and our waitress Sue was great. The food was delicious; I had the garlic noodles, and the asparagus in it was wonderful. The food came out fast, and the drinks were good. When Sue carded me, she noticed that today was my birthday and they sang happy birthday to me without my parents having to ask. The food was great, but the customer service was excellent!"
Ashley H.,"Browns Mills, NJ",25,13,,4.0,10/13/2013,"Great food, horrible wait times. We have gone here many many many times and have walked away because the wait is over an hour. I can't wait that long with three children, not to mention its over priced unless you go for lunch. Will I go again of course but wish they would take reservations."
Meghan C.,"Mt Pleasant, SC",327,526,8,1.0,11/15/2010,"We went here because an in-law gave us a gift card and we were broke that week.  I should have just returned the gift card.  The food is inedible and apparently meant to count for 3 or 4 meals calorically.  I typically avoid chains but since everyone seems obsessed with this place, I went in with an open mind.  This was honestly really, really gross."
Jesse I.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",2,8,13,2.0,4/29/2008,"At first glance one may think that the Cheesecake Factory is something more than just another chain restaurant. The interior and exterior is beautiful, from the giant pillars to the hot waitresses--beautiful.  But in all seriousness, when it comes to food the Cheesecake Factory is your average chain restaurant. The food is plated in a lousy fashion most of the time. I mean, with the beautiful atmosphere, I would expect the food to at least look better on the plate rather than just being plopped onto it and given a rushed garnish. The food is very inconsistent, which goes along with being an average chain restaurant. The last time I went I ordered the pasta chicken dish and the pasta was not fully cooked. The menu definitely offers a ton of things, which is good if you are going out with a crowd that cannot decide on what type of food they want. I had a particular problem with one item on the menu--the Kobe beef burger. This is very misleading since it's only called Kobe beef because it's from one of the tough parts of the Kobe beef cows. Real Japanese Kobe beef is illegal to import into the States. Wagu Kobe is domestic, and the good parts of this beef go for around $15 per ounce on restaurant menus. The Cheesecake Factory has average food. The service is good, and it should be since to become a server one must undergo a rigourous written test. The food might be heavenly to a student on a tight budget or with an average palate, but it's below par to a person who really appreciates food."
Moe W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,71,,2.0,7/26/2012,"Very, very rushed service.  We had to ask the server to slow down!"
