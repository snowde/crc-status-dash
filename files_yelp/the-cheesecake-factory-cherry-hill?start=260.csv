Jing G.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,276,,2.0,11/12/2008,"As another person put it, the food here really is what you can expect from a chain restaurant. I went here for a birthday party (not mines, thank goodness) with about 8 other people.  We shared a couple of appetizers, including a spring roll type with avocado in it.  Not bad, considering deep fried things hardly ever go wrong.   Got a couple of drinks, basically got what every other chain restaurant makes, premixed mixers tasting really artificial with just a little bit of alcohol. On to the entrees, I got a seafood pasta dish which was okay until I found a chunk of beef in it.  I don't eat beef, or any other red meat or chicken, at that.  And dishes should never be cross-contaminated like that.  I flagged down a waitress, and she wasn't sorry about it.  She took it and later some manager type person came and asked me to tell him what was wrong.  He said things like this ""should not happen"" - well right! they shouldn't! but he wasn't exactly sorry either. They obviously comped my dish, but for the rest of everyone else's stuff, consisting of either deep friend appetizers or pasta ala oil, the charge came to be much more than it was worth.   The only halfway redeeming quality of this restaurant is obviously the cheesecakes.  Which are pretty good and packed well to-go, since we didn't want to spend anymore time there."
John P.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",2,120,,5.0,9/7/2011,"I tend not to go to chain restaurants, but this is the exception. The service is excellent. The waiters are very informed of every item on the menu. The prices are very reasonable. The quality of the food is excellent, have not had a subpar meal there yet. There are lines to get in sometimes, just try to avoid the peak hours. Definetly worth a visit."
Genaro O.,"Evesham Township, NJ",2,8,1,3.0,2/11/2011,"Blue Cheese BLT burger did not have enough bacon and too much blue cheese. The Caesar salad was eh. And, the server waited until we had our mouths stuffed with food to always make an impromptu appearance to ask us how our food was. A little space please. Maybe, come back when I can actually offer a response. My wife loves this place which is why I always keep going back."
Duncan I.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,,3.0,4/15/2011,"This place is fine for what it is. It's a chain, there are always going to be quality control issues and you're trying to please a huge range of diners so I was overall fine with the experience. We managed to slip through the long line and grab a bar table which turned out to be a great move, saving us at least an hour. We also decided to go tapas and order a series of appetizers and small plates which was also a good move. Overall, fine."
Jake P.,"PA, PA",31,376,4,3.0,3/9/2007,"From Chicago, to Philly, to Pittsburgh, the Cheesecake Factory is consistent with great service, but the whole display doesn't really move me. I've been to the KOP location, not this one... and it's eh. The menus here are like middle-age scripture, and they literally have EVERYTHING. Save for dessert, nothing's worth writing home about. I always stay in the Asian-fusion, and it's just... bleh. If you want a nice $40 a person dinner, there's countless places with more personality, better food, and close-enough desserts. When I want truly knockout Cheesecake, I go where Diddy goes, Junior's in downtown Brooklyn. Chea!"
Michelle R.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,33,1,4.0,7/6/2013,"Mmmm...chicken costoletta and the yummy cheesecake...what's not to like? In my world, the more cheesecaker, the better! Great place to go after hitting the mall or the movies.  Never a super long wait for seating either!"
Jacki G.,"Philadelphia, PA",49,215,14,4.0,7/15/2010,"Amazing restaurant!!!! The menu is the longest one I've ever seen, so you'll definitely find something you like. The portions are mammoth, and will easily feed you for two days. The wait tends to be pretty long (gotta love the American desire for gluttony!), so get there early. All in all, a great place for date night or to take the family. The only downfall is that they do not accept reservations."
Adri S.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,33,,4.0,9/1/2010,"It's great if you go at off-peak hours.  Food is good and dessert is better.  It's not worth the wait if you go at a crowded time though, since it is slow inside for waiting on your food or even a drink as well."
Joanne T.,"Woodbury, NJ",157,452,236,3.0,10/2/2011,when you can't make up your mind for lunch or dinner. come here. they have a huge menu. they also have a new heath conscious menu. i favor the tiramisu cheesecake. this place does get really busy during prime dinner time. nice dining area outdoors during warm weather. last time i came here was on a sunday night and had the tuna salad for dinner. it was pretty good. but more memorable was the adult milkshake that had salted caramel peanut butter.  oh man it was sinful.
Drayton S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,,2.0,2/21/2010,If your looking for large portion that lack flavor and taste with an inflated price this is the place to go. I've given this place numerous times to redeem itself and i have left disappointed and with brutalized pockets. Its has a nice inner and outer decor and a upbeat environment but the food is definitely lacking from appetizer to entrees...i would suggest coming here for dessert or for some drinks besides that keep it moving! 2 stars for Cheesecake Factory!
Megan R.,"Cinnaminson, NJ",1,6,,4.0,2/9/2010,"I went on a Monday night and there was no wait. The food was great and not overly expensive.. however the drinks were a little too pricy. I got a strawberry martini which 12 dollars for a 4 oz drink. Im a bartender and know that fruity martinis are basically all mixer and a standard 1.5 oz vodka measure, so 12 dollars seems exorbitant. I wish I could give 3.5 stars."
Arpan A.,"Little Rock, AR",9,10,,4.0,5/13/2009,"Normally I don't rate chains high, but this place is not only good for the food.  The waitstaff was crazy friendly.  Before we even got our main course, I was getting close to being full.  I loved the fried mac n cheese ( not my typical choice but it was recommended ).  My main course I didn't like because I went with something I normally don't get. I did however like food the other people ordered.  Also that whole wheat bread has some sort of addictiveness flavor... beware its really good.  I know your wondering why I gave it 4 stars when I didn't like the main course?  because I liked the other main courses and I didn't even have to complain... it was comp'd and I was given 4 gift cards.  Can we say good service?"
Tucker C.,"Bucks, PA",0,9,,5.0,11/4/2009,"I have never been disappointed by a meal at Cheesecake Factory. This is the only chain restaurant I can say that about.   The Thai Peanut Chicken is excellent, I really enjoy the Beef Ribs and of course the Cheesecake is not to be missed. But if you can get there for Sunday Brunch the best thing on the menu is the Crab Hash - hash browned potatoes with crab meat and hollandaise sauce. It can't be beat."
eliza b.,"Haddonfield, NJ",232,406,67,3.0,6/4/2007,"okay, so i've been hearing alot about this place, blah blah blah. we went there at like 3pm and still encountered a wait, of course.  i'd like to talk about something strange.... immediately upon entering, something struck me.... there was no food smell! at all! no bakery smells, no aroma of things gently frying, no general cooking odors at all! this is probably one of the weirdest facets of any dining experience i've ever had. regardless, my ""luau"" salad was delicious and actually pretty authentically hawaiian. everyone liked their meals. the service was a little bit wacky and the menu is ridiculous (17 pages long and lots of furniture and real estate advertising). it was a little expensive for not being super nice, and the atmosphere was bizarre. but i'd probably hit it up again for that salad."
tj m.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",4,2,,3.0,10/10/2006,"I was very pleased with my experience at this resturaunt. I'll start by saying the food was excellent; amazing selection, great flavors, and portions slightly larger than what could be held in an army barracks kitchen. (some may not like large portions, however i am always happy to bring home leftovers.) Although my overall experience was a thumbs-up there is a reason for my tri-starred rating, i felt cramped in the resturaunt. Our seating arrangement found us sitting at a table nearly flush with the adjacent (packed with a seemingly overzealous MD crowd discussing work rather intrudingly). I would assume however that every experience will not have a downfall such as my last visit and therefore i will recommend this resturaunt for anyone looking for a moderately priced delicious meal."
Kitty K.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,23,,3.0,7/14/2011,"Not the best.  Y'know, sometimes it's better than other times.  Been here quite a few times since it is conveniently located and they do have a big selection of food.  The salads are pretty decent.  I do like the guacamole, but that is also hit or miss.  It's nice to sit outside, but inside is scary because there always seems to be a lot of commotion...like if you want to use the restroom, you need to have experience traveling through a maze or something and be careful not to bump into any wait staff...it's not their fault, it's just so busy all the time...which is a bit of a surprise because the food is okay, but not outstanding.  They even changed their fries to ""coated fries"" which I am not a fan of.  They have good drinks... decent sized beer.  Good lemonade and other soft drinks.  I wouldn't say that I am not a fan, but when I go, my expectations are always so-so.  Hope you go on a good day."
Michael R.,"Medford, NJ",65,125,41,4.0,9/19/2007,"The food is pretty good here.  If you want to eat here get their early.  It gets very busy for dinner.  If you want , put your name on the list and check out Brio a new Italian restaurant  across the parking lot and see how long the wait is.  The cheesecake has very eclectic food.  For appetizers check out the Roadside Sliders (Mini Burgers) and the Lettuce Wraps.  For dinner try the Bang Bang Chicken or The Jamaican chicken and shrimp.  Finish it off with a piece of cheesecake."
Russ C.,"PA, PA",41,270,20,4.0,3/9/2007,"Like Caitlin said, there is ALWAYS a wait at CF.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food... the meatloaf sandwich is amazing, and obviously the cheesecakes are noteworthy.  While the KOP location is convenient, I recommend putting you're name on the waiting list before you shop.  Your table should be ready by the time you have checked out every square inch of the mall."
Andrew W.,"Ellicott City, MD",5,89,2,3.0,12/4/2007,Average Cheesecake Factory. Went on a Tuesday night and it wasnt busy at all which was nice. Standard menu and nice atmosphere.
Erin P.,"New Hope, PA",17,152,,2.0,1/8/2009,"everything but the actual cheesecake is highly overrated. it's way crowded, the waits are ridiculous, it's loud - it's a typical chain restaurant on sterroids. the only time i would ever go here is if i ordered a cake ahead of time and went to pick it up... but even then i'd probably have to wait about a half hour."
