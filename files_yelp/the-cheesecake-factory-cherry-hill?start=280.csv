Pamela W.,"Newfield, NJ",67,23,,3.0,8/16/2007,"I went here with a group of people that had been before and they were raving about it.  Because it is located in Haddonfield, where there are people packed into the city like sardines, there was a 30 min. wait.  The service was decent.  The food was amazing.  I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, which was penne with eggplant, pine nuts, artichokes, and a few other vegetables.  I was told the cheesecake was to die for but I thought it was just ok.  I didn't even finish my slice (which cost $7).  I ordered the Cherry Cheesecake because all the others sounded like too much sweetness.  I expected there to be a generous serving of cherries on top but there was only a little drizzle (a huge disappointment!)  I would probably go there again for the food if it was a special occassion.  The experience wasn't worth the cost.  Total for me: including tip was $25.  That was for water, penne pasta, and one piece of cheesecake."

I don't know how they run their HR deparment, but the staff is consistently pretty attentive and friendly, from Jersey to California."
