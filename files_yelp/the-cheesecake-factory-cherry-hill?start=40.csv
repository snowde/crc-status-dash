Kelly W.,"Pitman, NJ",0,7,2,1.0,7/25/2017,"We are not difficult to please, and this is not our first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. In fact, this is my first negative review EVER on Yelp. However, it's hard to describe how disappointing today's lunch visit was in this Cherry Hill Location. We were seated quickly, as the restaurant was not too crowded. Our waiter, Eric, was friendly when he took our drink order, and gave us plenty of time to study the menu. I did not realize that was probably because time apparently didn't matter to him. We made a simple order--Asian lettuce wrap apps, a macaroni and cheese burger (medium well), and a soup and salad.  Eric left, and two other couples came in and were seated near us. We sat and waited for our appetizer, and time started ticking away. The appetizer took FOREVER to come out, and Eric apologized for the wait. We were fine with that. Then, it came time to wait for the meal. We waited and waited, and watched the other two couples receive their meals. They had burgers and salads too. Their burgers had so much meat that they looked like they did not fit on the bun. Their salads had lots of fresh looking veggies, and their burger came with an abundance of fries on the plate. Eric walked by several times, but never with any food for us. He apologized again for the wait, and left and came back, but still did not have our food.  We had been in the restaurant an hour at this point. Eric walked by again, and I said, ""any luck yet?"" He said, ""Yes, soon."" I said, ""I don't understand, those two couples came in and ordered long after we did, and are almost through with their food. We only ordered soup and salad and a burger. I don't understand the delay.""  Eric left, and the next time we saw him he had our food. I look at my husband's burger. It was half the size of the bun, and look like it was cooked to the point of being a hockey puck. There were no fries on the plate, and Eric said the fries will be right out. Eric lay down my stupid salad as well, the soup looks fabulous but the salad was nothing but greens tossed in a light dressing. I was surprised that there was not even a cucumber or tomato or a shredded piece of carrot in sight.  My husband and I just looked at each other stunned, and started eating. He could barely chew his char-burnt burger that was supposed to be medium well. Several minutes later a table runner brought out a small cup of cold french fries.   My husband and I were quiet the rest of the meal, and did not see Eric again for a while. No asking how the food was, no offers for refills, nothing. He finally showed up, and spoke just one word, ""desserts?"" My husband and I responded simultaneously with a somber ""no"". Eric quietly gave us our check in and we paid and left. To add insult to injury, The cloth table napkins had shed white lint all over my black sport, my husband's shirt, and his shorts."
Bobby B.,"Absecon, NJ",0,1,1,4.0,8/4/2017,"Went for my daughters 18th Birthday dinner, appetizers were great, recommend the fried chicken sliders. Dinner portions were large, and the menu ranged from Italian to Mexican a little something from whatever you would be in the mood for. As expected the cheesecake selection was plentiful, our family ordered four separate types, celebration was our favorite. Waitress was young and a little distracted by friends of hers at another table that is only negative and that wasn't too bad, would definite go back again"
Des R.,"Philadelphia, PA",110,136,412,3.0,5/15/2016,"I haven't been much of a Cheesecake Factory fan, but I went for brunch & I may be changing my mind. I had the California Omelette & Brûlée French toast which was delicious. The french toast was nicely toasted on the outside with a soft melt-on-your-tongue center. I also tasted the Crab Hash which was very tasty. The crab meat was perfectly flavored & paired very well with the poached eggs & potatoes. I can now add the Cheesecake Factory to my list of places that serve a good brunch ;-)"
Sean C.,"Absecon, NJ",24,12,,2.0,4/25/2017,"What happened to this place?!?! I used to love it there. My friend and I went to eat there on 4/25. We were greeted ( or not) by a host I believe. We asked for a table for two. First she said we were standing in the wrong place. She was clearly frustrated. She proceeded to give us a poor attitude. Finally I became irritated and asked if there was an inconvenience? We came in at 9:55pm so I wasn't sure if they were trying to close. She told me they closed at 11. I told her she seemed unhappy that we asked to sit and she responded by saying she didn't feel like being there. Wow... that left me speechless. When we sat down to eat, I'll admit the food was still great. The waitress was nice at first but then became a little snippy when it came to boxing our food. I felt like we weren't wanted there. I would usually chalk it up to a one time thing but i visited there 3 weeks ago and noticed the customer service was declining then.       Personally, I love a friendly atmosphere. I love to tip. But I couldn't bring myself to leave more than the average tip (15%) and I rarely ever do that. In the future, I'll probably love you guys from afar and just buy cheesecake. The people who take the orders for the Cheesecake are at least friendly. Especially this lady who works Tuesday night with short hair."
Lise L.,"Haddonfield, NJ",9,65,8,3.0,8/22/2016,"It's always a hit and miss with this location. While I love going here and just sitting at the Hi Tops and ordering apps and drinks with friends, I find they usually screw up every other time. It's mainly the kitchen, you either get a chef who can cook or you get a chef who just doesn't get it. We never try to customize our food orders because the menu is so extensive that you can find something that fits your palette without a problem. Yesterday after a business meeting we decided to visit CF before heading home. I ordered my usual Basil, Tomato and Cheese flat bread and opted to try 2 new things: the cucumber mint lemonade (amazing!) and the parmesan cheesey garlic bread (fail! There was no cheese at all on there). Sent the garlic bread back and just asked for an order of fries.  Just a note about their French toast for brunch. Just say no! Or go to Grand Lux across the street. Their French toast is horrible. I needed a steak knife to cut it! Not cool! They don't use proper bread for french toast it's more like a hard shell sourdough.  For every good meal I have at CF there is always one where their kitchen screws something up. They need new chefs. Consistency is key."
Kathy S.,"Pennsauken Township, NJ",0,18,6,2.0,12/3/2017,"I just got home from a big family brunch at the Cheesecake Factory. It was probably my last visit. There was a ridiculously long wait for the food. I did enjoy my pancakes, which were served with only a tiny cup of syrup. My tomato juice was sour. Others needed more coffee, and were complaining about not having enough syrup. There was a long wait for the server to come back, then another long wait for coffee, syrup, and to have my sour tomato juice replaced with supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice. I stopped eating for quite some time, because I had nothing to wash down dry pancakes. The orange juice at least wasn't spoiled, but I have a hard time believing it's fresh squeezed, when my supermarket brand orange juice that comes in half gallon cartons tastes much better. I understand that people are busy, but the service was so horrible that meal should have been comped. No one even apologized for the endless waits for anything, or offered any reasons."
Taylor K.,"Delanco, NJ",0,10,7,5.0,12/11/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants for sure, I've been over a dozen times and haven't been disappointed once. Consistency is key for me because I often take clients out to eat and I know this is one place where I don't ever have to worry about the service. I love the food and of course the cheesecake. My favorite entree is the bang bang chicken and shrimp and my girlfriend always begs to stop and pick up a piece of their ""dulce de leche"" cheesecake. They're pumpkin cheesecake is also to die for, although it's seasonal. If you like buffalo, you have to try the buffalo blasters appetizer, it's amazing."
Bryan W.,"Temple Hills, MD",6,20,5,5.0,5/9/2017,"Like my cousin Drizzy Drake(not really) says""Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake/You know I love to go there,"" no fighting but it is always reliable for a great food. To be honest, they under salt everything which i understand is common practice amongst chains(i might have made that up) so i will let it slide and i feel guilty complaining about salt levels on more than one review. Maybe im the problem? lmao anyways food was awesome schmashed it all and murdered the salted caramel cheesecake...easily the best cheesecake in history...ask Junior and Jesus i bet they agree"
Regina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,7/6/2017,"I love this place! We went on a afternoon and our server Frankie was awesome! It was a real great experience except for half way true there was a couple coming in sitting down next to us who seemed to be working there cuz a lot of servers stopped by to chat and it's fine, I know this happens but it became annoying after a while cuz they where kind of loud and it became busy around that table!"
L M.,"Cinnaminson, NJ",1,29,9,5.0,7/5/2017,"Freddie was hands down the BEST server I've had this year. Customer service overall is in the toliet, but I actually had to give Freddies' manager an earful of positive praise! Fantastic service, Freddie, you made me day."
Sintia S.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",0,5,1,5.0,10/1/2017,I had a pleasant experience at the Cheesecake Factory today. Our waitress was very kind. I had the Jamaican spicy shrimp dish.
Amira A.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,"I love cheesesteak factory but every time I come to this location it's just a**. Walk in immediately greeted by a rude hostess, he was rude and cranky and then we waited 20 minutes for a waitress to even show up at our table!! We had to ask"
Stacie S.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",5,99,,4.0,4/25/2017,"Went on Good Friday to celebrate my daughter's and cousin's birthdays.  Service was good, drinks (both alcohol and non) were tasty.  Food was good except my cousin's pasta, which was very dried out.  I encouraged her to send it back, but she was starving and did not want to wait for a new plate to arrive.  The rest of the meal was good and our waitress was very attentive."
Jessica K.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,60,1,2.0,5/12/2017,"Ugh hate to leave another review but service has gone down. Went to eat and didn't sit at the bar this time. Say a high top . Waitress didn't come over for over 15 minutes to take our drink order. Food took over 35 minutes and all we ordered was an app and a sandwich! Took even longer to drop the check and scan it, and was just generally only there when we didn't need her, not there when we needed her. Also, I stood at the host stand for ten minutes before someone acknowledged me and finally just sat myself at a high top. Maybe only takeout from this location for now on."
Rose M B.,"Philadelphia, PA",17,22,79,5.0,3/3/2016,I mean no need for a long review. Every single time I am here IT IS JUST AMAZING The atmosphere is great! The food is always fresh EVEN A TOGO.. Its such a clean atmosphere...  The food I MEAN UGHHHHHH ... Its just great..
Kimmi V.,"West Deptford, NJ",72,46,19,4.0,2/10/2017,The mac and cheese bites are amazing. Love their burgers. Cookie dough cheesecake is great!
Kiran M.,"Edison, NJ",0,12,4,5.0,9/3/2017,"Best place for a relaxed dining experience with a wide variety of options...The flatbreads and salads are delicious and the cakes of course, are absolutely the best!"
Camay C.,"Philadelphia, PA",213,290,751,4.0,11/13/2015,"So, at lunchtime around 130pm, the parking lot is packed. No way time really though. Our waiter,  Eric was decent. Friendly and not overly attentive. I was disappointed that they didn't have Rolling Rock beer though. The waitstaff here are helpful to one another and working in retail, I'm big on customer service and even how the employees treat one another.. While Eric was waiting other tables, another server noticed my empty salad bowl and asked if she could take it.   Onto the food.. I ordered a Caesar salad and a lunch portion  of a rigatoni dish with shrimp and sausage. One thing I HATE about a predressed salad is almost no dressing or too much dressing. This salad nailed it spot on.. Just enough without being watery or soggy.  However, this dressing tasted more like mayonnaise with pepper. Wasn't a big fan but a little table salt and freshly cracked pepper saved my soul. Up next was my lunch portion of rigatoni with shrimp and sausage. Pretty tasty. Overall, I enjoyed the food and ambience but it's not a restaurant I'd wait in line for an hour to get a table. I'll try some dessert next time."
Najmah J.,"Sicklerville, Sicklerville, NJ",72,9,,3.0,1/31/2017,"Good food with nice huge portions.  I think they have a little something for everyone on their menu. It's a large variety. Service is usually good too!  My only complaint would be the last time I visited, I froze.   I ordered Steak Diane  and Shrimp scampi combo. The steak and gravy was perfect, my shrimp were over cooked and mushy. Also had the crab dip appetizer. It was tasty but spicy. I for one can not do spicy food. They should note it on the menu or have the server explain it. I saw no clues in the ingredients. I'd visit again still."
Brit B.,"Sewell, NJ",3,47,4,3.0,8/1/2017,"Don't live too close so only go out here on a Sunday when I am going to food shop at wegmans. This place is always a mad house and always packed! We wanted to sit outside so the guy said he could seat us right away , while stepping to the side of the counter the hostess was so confused he walked outside twice until 10mins later finally seating us. Was a nice day so didn't mind sitting in the sun, but the table was black and hott couldn't even put our hands on it so I decided to move it sideways out the sun myself. I ended up gettin a pizza n salad n my boyfriend got a turkey club and salad. Normally your salad would come out first , but here it came out with our meals and I wasn't too happy about that. The Caesar salad was so good. The pizza not so much it was fought and flimsy and I complained and the waiter just shoved my pizza back in the oven, like u couldn't offer to make a new one ? Very weird. We didn't know it was Cheesecake day so Cheesecake was half off so we ordered the birthday celebration and it was amazing and I'm not a Cheesecake fan. This review is based on their pizza and service because services took forever. I would go back for another salad that's about all !"
