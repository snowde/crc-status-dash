Aggie H.,"New York, NY",67,123,162,3.0,3/12/2017,"I was so surprised my friend and I had to wait 20 minutes for a seat on a Thursday night! You can definitely tell this is a hot spot for people in the area. I wouldn't call this fine dining by any means but the environment for this chain is quite nice with their high ceilings and dim lighting. I ordered some salad while my friend ordered the chicken madeira. I haven't visited a Cheesecake Factory since freshman year of college but the portion sizes are big just like I remembered. The salad's ingredients weren't particularly fresh but I guess I didn't expect much coming here. My main beef with this place is that my phone was dying and I asked the hostess in the front if I could charge my phone up there. ""Sorry, we don't have outlets for the public"". Ummmm....excuse me??????? I've never been turned down like this at any restaurant. Either way, I'd probably come back since, like McDonald's, since the price is fair for the food quality, which is predictable. But I'll just need to remember my portable battery next time."
Gabby L.,"Silver Spring, MD",58,1,5,5.0,8/27/2016,"Absolutely LOVE this place, always my to go place for a nice night out with family!! Zack was great! The Herb Crusted Salmon is awesome! The Pasta Da Vinci as well!!"
Amanda F.,"Philadelphia, PA",51,64,13,4.0,7/5/2016,"i think it's safe to say that Cheesecake factories are busy and a wait is expected when you come in.  With that being said, our last visit was actually a pleasant surprise.  Our party of 5 came in for sunday brunch and *gasp* no wait.  All of the food was good, i cant remember what everyone ordered but my meal was the GREEN CHILAQUILES WITH CARNITAS AND EGGS.  It was delish and pretty big- honestly a two person meal.  My husband ordered the chorizo and avocado omelet and it was really good and on the bigger side too.  Our niece ordered the kids mac and cheese and it was tasty!  If you decide to visit i definitely recommend the sunday brunch and the cucumber mint lemonade."
Amy R.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,6,3,5.0,3/14/2017,"The service was great & our food was amazing ! My only disappointment was the ""freshly baked bread"" which was kind of hard and definitely didn't taste fresh. Other than that, everything was great. I'd definitely go again!"
Jeremy K.,"Tempe, AZ",161,14,4,4.0,12/4/2016,"Don't ask me how, don't ask me why, but when hitting The Cake it's essential to get Mexican food, believe me. Hopefully they don't have to do an overhaul of the kitchen staff this upcoming year. Good service is a hit or miss, server forgot our guac and chips last meal. Sad."
Karlee M.,"New Brunswick, NJ",1,17,,1.0,1/21/2017,"Pretty sure they gave me an uncooked veggie burger last night, or it was just flat it disgusting. Avocado egg rolls had brown avocados in them. And I stood out the counter for pick up and the girl took a few people before me although I was there first. Completely disappointed."
Dean Z.,"Haddonfield, NJ",17,4,,4.0,2/21/2017,Great food. A lot to choose from a large menu. We made it a regular place to eat on Sunday morning brunch after church. It's slower and you don't have to wait in their long lines. Highly recommend!!!!!
Melissa F.,"Clementon, NJ",0,7,,3.0,8/1/2017,"I am very disappointed in the service of this restaurant recently. It seems like every time I am there, it is just so hectic you can't even hear what anyone is saying. The waiters and waitresses look so overwhelmed it is like a circus. I went this past weekend and there was an hour wait so we decided to sit outside..... it slowly started raining and the staff looked around and didn't know what to do. After waiting another 25 minutes we got a table (a booth would have been another hour) and the experience seemed rushed."
Bill U.,"Richardson, TX",150,316,264,4.0,5/24/2016,Good food and drinks. Had the wrong dish delivered to me and before I could mention it the server was there and corrected my order. Staff was great and service better.
Austin H.,"Erlton-Ellisburg, Cherry Hill, NJ",153,1,,5.0,7/29/2017,"Our service at this Cheesecake Factory was beyond exceptionable. Matthew M is one of the best servers I have ever had. He was so kind and helpful, not to mention how personable he was. The food was delicious, as expected, but the really delicacy at this establishment is Matthew M. Be sure to request him to be your waiter, as it will make your meal 10x better."
N C.,"Marlton, NJ",5,103,5,3.0,2/23/2016,"Unless you want to keep your group or date waiting around for a table, this isn't a good spot for special occasions nor dates. And yet that's what virtually Everyone comes here for. Seems logical, i know. The decor is nice as usual, but it's getting a bit dated/run-down from all the hordes of patrons. The service is spotty; sometimes you get an energetic smiley server, and sometimes you get an aloof one eager to finish their shift. Once the obscene portions of the food are overlooked, the food is actually pretty good. I am a big fan of non-boring flavors-- bitter, sour, pungent, umami, etc. So that narrows the chain's encyclopedia-sized menu down a bit. I recommend any of the cajun, thai, and comfort-style meat dishes for these types of flavors. Some lemon-based Italian dishes too. I say the comfort dishes (shepherds pie, chicken madeira, chicken & biscuits, etc) due to the umami flavor caused by the jus mixed with the starch.. The Mexican-style dishes are mostly Tex-Mex which are not interesting. Arguably, only a few cheesecakes are really worth getting: purist related. Original, orig. + strawberries, oreo, vanilla bean, white chocolate rasp, & red velvet. That's pretty much it. Nothing too complicated, nothing chocolate-centric--if you wanted to cover up the cheesecake flavor, just get sponge cake.  So that's my .02...a good place aside from the evening wait times"
Wen M.,"Riverdale, NY",7,83,84,5.0,11/13/2016,"5 star Megan... she came to save the day... our family sat for nearly 20 mins waiting for a server to wait on us, nothing. Finally we flagged Megan down and she sincerely apologized for our wait and explained to us that this was not her area of dining but was more than glad to take our order. She is very attentive and sweet... I had read other reviews and was quite unsure how this experience would turn out from our usual CS Factory near our home. Kudos to the management for hiring such a wonderful young woman.. Megan really takes pride in her work! And as I stated before she truly saved the day!! Btw Dinner was DELICIOUS!! Megan recommended a tasty delicious meal for our daughter whom is quite the picky eater..."
Erika D.,"Maple Shade Township, NJ",66,79,99,3.0,8/15/2016,"Brought my boyfriend here for this birthday, tagging along my friend and her boyfriend. The 1st time I was here, there was a very cute server, and he was our server. (I was still single then, so it's okay) I didn't know if I was drooling over the food or over his cuteness"
Kathleen M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",14,2,,1.0,6/14/2017,We ate there around 9pm and were seated right away since we were only a party of 2. Time served was an okay wait. Food served soup was hot. The salad I ordered was my issue. I found a fly in my salad. I called the waitress to the table and she offered to replace the item. The manager visited our table and offered to replace the salad. At that point of the meal I couldn't get the thought of the dead fly out of my mind. The issue was when the bill was brought to our table I was charged for the salad. After I complained again it was removed.
Nancy O.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,7,,1.0,1/6/2017,"First, the wait is too long. The service wasn't great. Food wasn't all that. Tried it once never returning."
Julie Z.,"Collingswood, NJ",14,61,57,4.0,3/28/2016,"Oh cheesecake factory, you are like my standard go to little black dress when I'm not really sure what I want to wear, that I can just pull out of my closet in a pinch and still look fab! I've been to the cherry hill cheesecake factory multiple times.  Now- for any of you who know anything about the cheesecake factory, you can expect a wait when you go during prime times. Off hours the wait time is not bad at all, particularly for late night bites.  Drinks can be a little expensive ( draft beers run ~$8)/ but cocktails are fresh and usually pretty good. The menu is HUGE. You can get jut about whatever type of continental food you would like to order. I feel like I am never disappointed. The staff is courteous and friendly. Your meal always starts with delicious fresh bread (pumpernickel and white). And then of course the dessert, I usually don't even like cheesecake but give in and order while I'm here.  A great standard go-to in south jersey when you are really not sure where to go."
Rob G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,26,,3.0,9/22/2017,"We just moved to Cherry Hill and were asking around for a good place to get dinner one night and someone suggested we check out the cheesecake factory. Being from New York we are very familiar with the cheesecake factory as a Times Square establishment and were kind of surprised to find that it is the literal local gathering place for all people all of ages combined in our neighborhood. I personally just don't get it. It's a it's a chain restaurant and feels very dime a dozeny inside. People actually dress up to go here, which confuses me as it would be like dressing up to go to a TGI Fridays. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The cocktails were weak. The service was decent (our waitress was wearing at least 23 pieces of visible flare lol for the office space fans out there!) If you want to eat mediocre chain food head on over to the Cheesecake Factory, or Fridays, or Outback...is there really a difference? Okay, outback has the blooming onion which is bangin."
Angela A.,"Trenton, NJ",80,2,,2.0,7/3/2017,"We visit Cheesecake Factory often, but never this location, and after our experience will not be visiting again. The one by our house in west Windsor delivers exceptional service and along with great food makes for a very good experience. This location however, was the worst service I've ever experienced. 10 minutes to get greeted, no bread brought to the table, and no offer of dessert. It's Cheesecake Factory and we were not offered Cheesecake. I believe our servers name was Ariel. Very impersonal and unprofessional. The food was good as always but because of the service we will not be visiting this location again."
Amanda M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",373,375,35,3.0,4/16/2015,"What is it about this place that draws ENORMOUS crowds everywhere?  No matter the location, I've never walked into a Cheesecake Factory and been seated without a wait. My recent visit to the one in Cherry Hill was no exception.  Thinking we were ""early"" for dinner on Saturday evening, we were told to expect a 50 minute wait by a very efficient hostess.  Thankfully it didn't take quite that long (more like 25 minutes) before we were seated.  Busy restaurants means tight tables, no matter how big the interior may seem. We were nestled next to two couples on either side, which wasn't too big a deal, although it's always awkward to hear every word of other people's conversation.  I'm always overwhelmed by the mish-mosh of offerings at CF (which seems to match the decidedly un-themed, lavish decor).  This time, I decided to stick to appetizers, allowing me to try a few different things.  We split the fried mac and cheese balls and the crabby bites, which were both delicious.  I then ordered veggie fries (fried avocado, zucchini, and portobellos), which were unfortunately very disappointing.  I've had awesome avocado fries before, but the breading seemed all wrong on these.  Luckily I'd also ordered the pear and blue cheese flatbread, which was excellent - the arugula on top had a lemon-y drizzle that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Despite being stuffed, we couldn't leave without cheesecake, so we ordered it to go. I don't think you can go wrong here, as they're all delicious, but my Adam's peanut butter/caramel/brownie concoction was perfect, and actually lasted two days. Perhaps next time I'll skip the wait and just order cheesecake to go!"
Marissa D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,,5.0,12/23/2016,Ate here tonight with my family. We're not big fans of restaurant chains but this one was solid.. It was packed because of the holiday shoppers but the staff handled everything extremely well. Our server was exceptional and the food was awesome! Overall great experience.
