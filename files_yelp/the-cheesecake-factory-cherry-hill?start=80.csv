Scott P.,"West Berlin, NJ",2,25,52,5.0,6/17/2016,"_×Went for apps and drinks on a friday afternoon. Buffalo blasts are always a go to for me but tried the crab wontons and they were amazingly good. My girl had the flying gorilla (basically a banana chocolate adult milkshake)...everything was awesome, service included...sit outside if ya can. PS get there early...no reservations so weekend wait times can be long."
Becky M.,"Heidelberg, Germany",0,5,,1.0,5/18/2017,"Always love coming to Cheesecake Factory. Was there tonight 5/18 after a graduation ceremony. Our party must have had a new waitress, she didn't even come acknowledge our table for 10 mins then forgot plates with the bread. Her name was Jessica C. She clearly had no knowledge of the menu. She screwed up my dinner order and while everyone else ate, I waited for my food 20 more minutes due to her ERROR. At least she offered a soup which I declined since it was 92 degrees outside? Who eats soup when it's that hot? By the time my meal finally came out of the kitchen, everyone else was finished the meal. At that point I took it to go. I don't think it's too hard to not mix up Crusted Chicken Romano or parmesan herb crusted chicken. Disappointed in service tonight on what should have been a special night! I really wish we had a different experience like the normal 5 star service we are accustomed to. Already called corporate for this experience since no one can bother to even acknowledge me."
Ben S.,"Philadelphia, PA",35,2,,4.0,6/11/2016,The food was great We enjoyed the avocado eggroll and the pasta was very good as well The service was ok but the waitress wasn t patient at all
Sabrina C.,"Carroll Park, PA",0,55,,1.0,8/20/2016,"We ordered two pasta dishes tonight. Garlic Noodles & Evelyns Pasta LONG SILIVER HAIR  in Garlic Noodles and Evelyns pasta tasted burnt. Manager came over and couldn't make eye contact with us, sounded like a drunk! Our waiter was on point, he could give the manager a few tips! How disappointing, better to go somewhere else, this place is going down hill fast!"
Jen D.,"Somers Point, NJ",0,10,,2.0,5/8/2017,Food was horrible- I had broken pieces of plate in my food and almost broke a tooth.  The staff was nice the atmosphere was not to my taste very loud.  I had never been to this eatery and had I known this was the environment I would have gone elsewhere.  If you enjoy processed food and crowds by all means have a ball!
Alyssa K.,"Marlton, NJ",123,272,53,5.0,2/5/2016,"Always a good option when dining with multiple people who have different tastes! Over 100 menu options that are extremely varied, and I mean, who can pass up a cheesecake. The drinks aren't all that strong, but they are yummy. Probably wouldn't come here for the bar scene, but definitely would suggest for apps and dinner!"
Nick V.,"Marlton, NJ",13,75,23,5.0,2/24/2016,"Great chain!!!! I can't believe I'm giving it 5 stars but it totally deserves it! The wait was insanely long (60-90 mins), but what else would you expect on a holiday weekend Saturday night. We got a great waitress and a bunch of awesome appetizers and great entrees. I got the Mac and cheese burger and it was TO DIE FOR. Please try it - you won't regret it. Okay, yes you will because you'll be so full... but don't think of that! Their cheesecake of course was amazing as well."
Ashton M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,,5.0,4/16/2017,The food here is excellent. A bit of a wait but totally worth it. The staff is very friendly and the cheesecakes are so good esp the red velvet
Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",276,928,650,3.0,11/6/2014,"I've been the cheesesteak factory before in the king of prussia mall, PA as well as in tyson's corner ,VA..... this location just isn't as good.  The tuna tartare was the best thing. It's under the Apps.  For my entree I got the chicken carbonara, pretty good. For some reason I just think the other locations have better cooks or something. The service was good here but the taste of the food was a bit off."
Alex D.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",1,7,,4.0,10/26/2016,Always a long wait but great food and service. A little loud but with a couple drinks and good friends it will be a solid time. Foods expensive but the portions equate to 2 meals.
Jake S.,"National Park, NJ",0,6,,4.0,9/23/2016,"Visited this cheesecake factory location for the god only knows how many times, and i was impressed but feel misguided. You see with a lot of these more elegant yet casual restaurants you really have to be wowed to come back within reasonable time period. I once again got the shrimp scampi which has yet to let me down once, but this time it lacked that something that told me to come back. Service was good, food came quickly and it was hot. I love this place but maybe ill take my business elsewhere."
R.A. R.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,72,1,2.0,4/15/2017,"The food is decent but not a clean place, old glasses and dishes sit around, poor customer service, overworked and overwhelmed employees."
Daniel M.,"Philadelphia, PA",43,97,269,5.0,11/16/2014,"My girlfriend and I walked in. Their were a lot of people waiting to be seated, but for a Saturday evening I can understand. We walked up to the hostess and she told us about a 40 minute wait.  I was surprised but about 40 minutes later we were seated and during our wait we were smart and looked at the menu and already knew what we wanted. Our waiter Jason was very nice and knowledgeable with the menu. We both ordered burgers and I ordered a drink, we shared a Caesar salad and it was very good. Before we left we bought a slice of cheesecake to go, overall good experience here just wish the prices were a bit lower.  The menu has a lot of items on it so if you have time look through it prior to being seated."
Cindy W.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",610,311,108,4.0,8/30/2014,"Great restaurant w extensive menu, friendly service, beautiful decor, and priced well for generous portions."
Maria P.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",0,8,,4.0,2/26/2017,"The food is always excellent here, and I have had many great servers the many times I have visited. Specifically Alex (female) and Desiree. The only issue I have had is twice now I have had a very poor server. I think his name is Eric - I hope this is the right name. We were in Saturday afternoon. Only saw him once. The table next to us was complaining about him also. All four tables in his section seemed to be looking around for him most of the time. We waited 15 minutes after our plates were clean to see him and ask for check. Finally we saw him and asked, waited another 10 minutes and he was nowhere to be found. The restaurant was not crowded and we did not have to wait for a table. We saw the server for the table next to us over 10 times but never ours. We ended up just leaving a gift card on the table as we never saw our bill. The woman who brought our food and cracked the pepper on my soup deserved a larger tip. The rating is due to consistently good food and service at this location but I felt it was necessary to voice my complaints on this server if a manager perhaps reads this. I quote the woman at the table next to me ""He is a horrible server."" Soup and salad combo was absolutely delicious!"
Ed T.,"Bear, DE",0,22,2,5.0,7/14/2016,Went with A chargrilled coulette steak they were offering for a decent rate. It was better than any filet mignon I ever had. Ate every last bite. Good service. Nice atmosphere. Will cost you aorund a hundred bucks for a family of 4 if you include price of drinks. They do NOT have a kids menu. We ordered a plate and had them split it for our kids since the portions are too big for each of our kids.
Meg T.,"Philadelphia, PA",233,70,53,4.0,10/30/2014,"Love this place. Such a great chain all around. Clean, very friendly and attentive staff and quick service. I am aware that this is a chain and sometimes I feel it goes against my nature to review chains and support chains because I feel it necessary to support your local businesspeople! But either way, I came here once with my boyfriend after shopping at Wegmans and it was delightful.  Granted it was at like 3 or 4pm on a weekday so it wasnt busy but the service was excellent, fast and friendly.  The food was amazing.  The fried mac and cheese was out of this world and I just got the quesadillas because I was in the mood for them.  They were delicious as well.  The fact that you have a million different options on that menu is alone a treat.  I would recommend this place for birthdays with family members or large parties like that because everyone can get something they like because the menu is THAT extensive.  For a chain- Cheesecake factory takes the cake (oooooh, get it?!?!?!?)"
Sarah S.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,339,4,4.0,10/16/2014,"I pretty much always like my visit to cheesecake.  If it weren't for the long wait, I would prob like to go more often.  Fortunately, when we went on a Thursday night at 6:30pm at this location, we were able to get seated right away.  Definitely a plus.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich.  Good as usual.  The chicken may have been a little bit on the dry side but I enjoyed it anyway."
Ann G.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,162,105,4.0,5/22/2015,"Service was excellent, great team work led by Ryan.  Ryan was on top of things . Did not miss a beat. The requests were delivered without waiting and wondering when they will serve. They fill our drinks without asking. Same with Ben, refill the bread with lots of butter. Food was ok. Chowder needs to be thicken a little bit. Overall the good was ok. Thanks Ryan and ben"
Mandy L.,"Atlantic City, NJ",3,31,401,5.0,8/9/2015,Super yummy. Definitely a place to try out. Got the salmon with herb and it was delicious. The atmosphere is really nice. Their free bread is yummy also.
