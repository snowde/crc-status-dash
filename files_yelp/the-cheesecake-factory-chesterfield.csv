Erica M.,"Bloomington, IL",78,168,190,5.0,8/26/2017,"I always enjoy my meal at The Cheesecake Factory and this trip was no exception. Meals always start off with their white and brown bread at the table. I consistently eat too much before every meal here. For my main dish I had the grilled cheese and bacon sticks. I believe this is a seasonal dish but I hope they add it to the regular menu because it was delicious. As always, I end my time here with a dessert. On this occasion I got the Funfetti Cake. It was a nice change from the super rich Cheesecake I normally order. This dessert had many layers with combos of different types of cake between. I really enjoyed it. The service was also good here."
Allison Z.,"Saint Louis, MO",8,78,47,1.0,12/14/2017,"We have visited this place about couple times before. It was always on the verge of being barely 3, and frankly not worth my time to write review about. Today though, it is. Entered the restaurant at 515, the place on Thursday night was half empty, but we still had to wait to be seated. Anyways, we waited about a few minutes before we were led to our seat. The main character, our waitress, came. She started with asking what we want, asked for milk, coke and ice tea. I looked at the table and said are we getting the bread? She gave me a look for a second, the look of asking ""how dare you want bread"", then actually asked you want bread??? I mean why the f would you even ask? Has your management changed so much that now I can't just expect you to bring it over but have to beg for it? We waited about 5 minutes on our drink, which wasn't bad thus far. We asked for a few more minutes on the menu, which really ended being another 10 minutes before we can order. That makes it 530pm. I didn't believe we ordered anything outrageously difficult to cook, but having their kitchen to produce the food seems a challenge (2 appetizers, 2 meals, and a slice of cake). Again, the restaurant was still half empty. 25 mins passed away, we did not get a fucking thing, let alone our much needed refill. The miss waitress might as well be napping else where. The table on our right who came in right after us was about to be done with their food (they had a different server), the table on our left who came in few minutes later was also losing patient on this whole ridiculousness. The lady finally stood up and summoned a different waitress who could summon our dear waitress to kindly refill our drink, and maybe do her due diligent on checking on the food. We got our appetizers. I went mad. I had a baby with who was losing the cool. Husband took baby back so we can feed her some other real food right before she pass out with empty stomach, and I was about to have a happy talk to their manager at 615. It was her lucky day - miss waitress came with the food and a check, and of course forgot my cheesecake. I did not have the patient to stay their for one more second. I madly put down precisely how much I owe this restaurant, and left this fucking place. I have no intention to return, ever. This wouldn't necessarily be the most unpleasant dining experience in my life, after all, they produce religiously ""Cheesecake Factory"" quality food. I make way better cheesecake and the only reason I would buy theirs is no one in the household could eat more than one slice. Forget about Cheesecake Factory, and their sad, arrogant, likely underpaid waiters, unless your life is filled with hours of hunger that you don't mind sitting there and chewing ice out of empty glasses."
Jason B.,"Chesterfield, MO",228,27,1,1.0,11/5/2017,"Rarely would I give a major chain restaurant such a bad review. Especially when their food is pretty good, and their cheesecakes are to die for. But tonight we had an exceptionally unpleasant time at the Cheesecake Factory in Chesterfield, MO.  We walked in and immediately thought that something was wrong, as the lighting was VERY dim, more so than usual (This is probably our third time dining there). It was to the point we could barely make out each other's faces and if it weren't for a single spot light aimed at the center of the table, we would not be able to read the menus. We complained, and were brought two battery operated candles which did not produce any usable light whatsoever. When we asked to speak to the manager we were informed that he gets lots of complaints about it, but it's corporate's direction to keep the lights that dim. It created an unpleasant experience for my wife and I, and creates a hazardous workplace for the wait staff.  As a photographer, I certainly understand the importance of lighting, and using it to set a mood, but this was just dark, dangerous and unpleasant. In addition to us, I notice many other patrons using their cellphone lights to read the menus. Come on, Cheesecake Factory, Take a hint and turn on the lights. Even if just enough for your patrons to read the menus and enjoy the company of their group."
Patt C.,"Chesterfield, MO",244,944,,2.0,8/17/2017,"This place never bowls me over. I've been to two. Don't need to go again. Stanwyck wanted to go, so we went. She got Thai lettuce wraps and a MASSIVE piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake (took half home). I got the Skinnylicious Hamburger without bun-- came with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and mayonnaise; and served with a green salad. Stanwyck loved her lettuce wraps -- they are her go-to at The Cheesecake Factory. My burger was the driest, most taste-free burger I've ever had in my life. None of the accoutrements were going to help this poor hockey puck. The salad was A-OK. Service was A-OK."
Picha M.,"Saint Louis, MO",142,270,110,4.0,1/23/2017,"I don't know what the negative hype is about with the Cheesecake Factory.  I know its a chain and there is no wow factor.  However each time I have dined here it has been satisfying.  The kids are entertained.  The decor is upscale almost stage-like.   Okay okay it isn't cheap but the menu is HUGE!  There really is something for everyone here, vegetarians and gluten free alike.  The wait is always long.  Tonight the service was great.  We were waited on by Kevin and he was courteous and did his job by acting interested not bored.   Do yourself a favor and order the asian lettuce wraps!  EXCELLENT!  The veggies were crisp and it came with 3 different sauces. All of my 4 kiddos were fighting for the scraps if that tells you anything.   I also ordered the garlic noodles.  Overall they were very good.  Not as much garlic flavor as I wanted but still pretty good.    Of course finish the meal with cheesecake!  I'm more of an ice cream fan but there are a zillion flavors you are bound to find something you'll like.  This meal I let the kids pick and we ordered Key Lime and the Hershey's chocolate cake.  Overall good.  Again for me a little too sweet.  I wish I had ordered a glass of milk.  But you know what the kids loved it and were happy.  I can't complain."
Lynn A.,"Saint Louis, MO",177,220,364,3.0,12/15/2016,"Food: 4 Stars Service: 3 Stars If you're itching to go out somewhere to eat but aren't sure where to go, The Cheesecake Factory is generally a safe bet as they have something for everyone. Seating is usually immediate unless you plan on dining during peak hours. In those cases, you can expect to wait anywhere between 45 minutes to an hour. Just be prepared... As of late, the problem I've had was mainly with service. After being seated, it usually takes 10-20 minutes for a server to come around with water and bread and another 10-15 to take our order. Waiting for the check? There have been times where we have waited 20 minutes to pay. If they can work on being more timely with their service, the restaurant could fare better. The food is what you would expect from a huge chain. A little bit of everything with huge portions. I love their pastas... It's really the only thing I come in for."
Tulina S.,"Chesterfield, MO",16,81,279,4.0,8/11/2016,"This is one of my favorite places.It hits the spot consistently over the years.Never reviewed it though! My recent visit was lunch with ladies and at 12.30 pm we had a 20 min wait. Started with chicken lettuce wraps which comes with 3 sauces-peanut sauce being my fav.The chicken was moist and amazing.My entree,Garlic noodles was very satisfying.The lunch portion was huge that I had leftovers for another meal.Other dishes our group ordered were the Chicken Romano(average in taste),Pasta Da Vinci(good),Evelyns fav veg pasta(very salty so please avoid) and a chicken teriyaki.The chicken was lip smacking good and came with rice,grilled plantains and pineapple-best dish of the day! We finished off with salted caramel cheesecake. Today, our server (Charles?)was excellent,very attentive and prompt."
Casey J.,"Ballwin, MO",45,29,39,3.0,10/3/2016,"My daughter likes to come here with her American Girl doll because they have little seats for them that hook on to the table. I dislike that the Cheesecake Factories around here are located in malls. I feel like if I go out to dinner somewhere that I can cost over 20 a person, then I don't want to sit next to people in shorts and tank tops.  We came in right at 6pm on a weekday, so probably steady, but not busy. I didn't like that the hostess was drinking from a cup behind the desk while asking me how many in my party and if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  Waitress was friendly, food came out quickly. My daughter had pepperoni pizza and I got the avocado eggrolls. I love the dipping sauce they had with them.  We ordered pumpkin cheesecake to go and it was delicious the next day. I enjoy coming here for dessert, but the casualness and high price point keep Cheesecake Factory out of my list of regular places to eat."
Jay S.,"Grover, MO",2,18,9,4.0,5/9/2017,"Our waitress Anna was on it! She had her arms full of a drink tray, gave us time to continue looking at our menu, and STILL remembered the kids menu on her way back."
Andrew L.,"Saint Louis, MO",124,47,21,5.0,8/23/2017,"My experience at TCF is always really good. Choosing something from the menu might be the hardest thing ever, literally pages on pages. In my opinion, the Miso Salmon is one of the greatest dishes on the menu, that or the Bistro Shrimp pasta, or even the Chipotle Chicken pasta. If you've never been to TCF, when they ask if you want bread, yes take the bread! The wheat bread is so so good. Tip, don't devour your whole meal, save some room for cheesecake. My favorite is either the Dulce De Leche or the pumpkin pie (seasonal). Now the staff, TCF staff is always friendly and attentive. If something is wrong with your order, the manager will personally swing by your table right away and make things right. My girlfriend though she had found a fingernail towards the end of her meal (bistro shrimp pasta), waiter told his manager, manager came right away and said he'll replace the whole meal & won't charge either (in conclusion the nail turned out to be a shell, but it's hard to tell when it's so dimly lit in there lol)."
Scott O.,"Saint Louis, MO",49,4,,2.0,6/18/2017,"This place is worse than Chilis or some other low-grade chain. Took 20 minutes to get bread and when the drinks came out, there was ketchup on one of the glasses and some green crap on the side of one of the other waters. Honestly, place needs more people working and new management. Everybody was complaining around us and nobody could get any service. Food came out in different order. This is why I don't go to massive chains....but I just did."
Caroline B.,"Saint Louis, MO",265,82,,5.0,1/25/2017,"Best Cheesecake Factory location that I've been to! This place is always delicious. Menu is gigantic and food is addicting. Almost always a wait for dinner, though!"
Christy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",4671,1278,11725,4.0,6/28/2015,"I can't deny I love the Cheesecake and Linda's Fudge chased by a hot cup of coffee.   The French Country salad is donned in goat cheese, beets, and delicious pecans tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette.   Try it, you won't be disappointed."
Julie L.,"Saint Louis, MO",135,651,2,4.0,11/22/2016,"Who doesn't love cheesecake to celebrate a birthday? Got here early for a table for my birthday and before a movie at the theater next door.  There was a wait but I also didn't realize that they now do call-aheads, which now I do for the future.  Got seated at a 2 seater table squeezed in among other tables.  Makes for a very crowded situation. Food selection is huge.  If you can't find something on their menu to satisfy your hunger then I'm not sure where you'll be able to go.  They offer everything you can think of...but remember save room for dessert!  Their cheesecake selections are amazing and big enough to share with your dining date."
Sara W.,"Maryville, IL",51,130,308,5.0,11/29/2016,"Hubby and I were in the area and I wanted cheesecake, so we decided to eat a late lunch here.  We were seated quickly...probably due to the odd time.  Server was friendly and took good care of us.  It did take a very long time to get our food and I was so hungry by the time it showed up I forgot to take a picture!  Oh well...it was delicious!  I had the steak Diane.  I was too full to eat cheesecake so I got it to go. By the time I got home I was ready to dig in and OMG nobody makes better cheesecake!  I always get the 30th anniversary and it is soooo good! Even though it took forever to get our food, I'm giving 5 stars for that darn cheesecake that I could eat every day!  Probably a good thing I don't live that close!"
Caprice F.,"Saint Louis, MO",114,425,1309,4.0,5/30/2016,"As with all cheesecake factories,  this location gives elegant atmosphere, decent food,  large portions, decent service,  and plenty of options.  The key lime cheesecake and godiva are delicious. I love the crusted chicken romano.  My friends got the jambalaya (which was said to be good) and an omelet (which was said to be ok but needed seasoning).  The omelet comes with an English muffin and potstoes by the way,  which isn't listed in the menu."
Michael K.,"Wentzville, MO",0,7,,1.0,3/9/2017,"I took my wife here for our 10th wedding anniversary. We have loved Cheesecake Factory in every other location we've visited. For some reason, this place does not belong in the franchise. The salad was old; it had obviously been prepared hours earlier as the avocado was dark brown and the chicken was the same temperature as the refrigerated lettuce. The ""warm"" bread was missing the ""warm"" part. It was cold and probably should have been tossed. The fried cheese triangles were Luke warm. I won't take my wife to cheese cake factory ever again. Oh and the wait staff were extraordinarily unfriendly. Such a bizarre experience. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
Jessi W.,"Wentzville, MO",1,88,85,2.0,1/23/2017,Awful.  I ordered the chicken and and biscuits meal and it had green beans instead of carrots. They did not ask me if that was ok or even let me know it would be that way. My boyfriend had hair in his food and when we told them to replace it we found out they gave him the wrong item. They charged $4 to exchange an item on the southern catfish sides. The catfish was greasy and bland. No flavor. The table we sat at had dried stuck on food all over. It's so dark they expect you not to notice the filth I guess. The cheesecake we got to go. It was good but everything else was a fail. Especially at those prices!
Joanna W.,"Potosi, MO",8,30,5,2.0,1/8/2017,"I've visited this location a several times, twice within the last month, and it's the same every time. The first visit, I found it a little gross that they leave silverware on the table. No napkin, anyone can walk by and touch them. There's this awful odor when you walk in that smells like spoiled milk. It smells like this every time I visit.  The cheesecake counter is ridiculously inefficient. The line was backed up almost to the door on my visit 3 weeks ago. There were two women working the counter. The first took my order while the second grabbed the slices I ordered. Instead of the second woman bagging them and handing them to me, she just sits them by the first taking the orders. The first woman ended up taking several more orders before bagging and giving me mine which had been ready for several minutes. Had the second woman been bagging and handing out orders, everyone would have been out in less than half the time.  The last time we were there, they forgot the raspberry sauce that my husband enjoys so much that's supposed to be on his cheesecake. The cheesecake is pretty boss but that's about all they have going for them."
Aabell B.,"Saint Louis, MO",192,74,279,4.0,7/29/2016,"Ok Ok ok ... I can't deny my love for Cheesecake Factory... There I said it! Mock me if you want! The food is always consistent but on the other hand the service could be spotty.  My coworker and I arrived here for lunch and this place was PACKED I mean like wall to wall pack.  It was ridicules. We were told a 45min wait and 12 noon... Crazy! Luckily we snagged a table in the bar area and only had to wait 15 min.  Our server was overwhelmed but she was still prompt and pleasant.  The menu here can be a bit overwhelming if you're short on time. I particularly like their SkinnyLicious menu. My favorite is the grill salmon and brown rice, Asian chicken Lettuce wrap, grilled artichoke, and the basil mozzarella flat bread.  Oh and every salad they offer I've had them all! Today I opted for the Kale and quinoa salad! It's honestly one of my favorite things on the menu it's light enough for lunch at the same time hearty making it filling. The lemon vinegar is the star of this dish. It pairs nicely with the add on shrimp and with a touch of sweetness from the hidden grapes that breaks up the tartness from all that Citrus. Of course I'll be back...."
Zen D.,"Ballwin, Saint Louis, MO",211,512,983,2.0,6/10/2016,"Blech.  I keep making this mistake of coming here and eating the food.  So first lets be honest, you can't have 2,000 menu items and not have a bunch of frozen microwaved trash.  It's too big, too loud, poor service, terrible food.  The 2 stars is for the cheesecake.  I mean let's just take the hint here.  It is named the ""Cheesecake Factory"" not restaurant.  It is a factory that churns out good cheesecakes.  Stick to that and you're safe.  If you want to wander into the endless labyrinth they call a menu.  Good luck, and God be with you."
Mary B.,"Wentzville, MO",0,6,,2.0,7/29/2017,"Disappointed in today's visit. 2 of us ordered Salmon which came out burned. I ordered salad with dressing on the side and it came out with dressing on it. We should have had them all re-made but didn't want to wait. Maybe they have new people in the kitchen who don't know what they are doing? However, I can't help but wonder if there is something else going on since the mall itself is struggling. (Except the Cheesecake Factory always seems busy.) The waiter also did not offer to box our leftovers which the wait staff has ALWAYS practically insisted on doing in the past. My leftover salad which I usually enjoy was not very good due to being soggy from sitting in dressing for hours."
Allie K.,"Ballwin, MO",77,3,,1.0,9/7/2017,"Dude. Bad service. Cold food. We waited twenty minutes for her every time we needed something... No joke from the appetizer bread to actual food (which again - was cold) to the Parmesan cheese to the extra napkins. It was just annoying.. We saw her talking at the server station, so us BOTH being waitresses, we get it! Maybe she's new? Maybe she has a sick kid at home? Who knows. But I walked by to go to the bathroom and just overheard her like talking about which dress to wear to something and what colors would work and I just felt a little ignored and put on the back burner. I seem to continuously be reaffirmed on my opinion of cheesecake factory. Lazy, annoying."
Marissa K.,"Ballwin, MO",2,11,,1.0,11/23/2016,"Think it's safe to say the place is losing its touch.  I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away, but that was the only positive experience we had.  Between waiting 20 min for our first drink order (while damn near breaking my tooth biting into your ""warm bread"") to an additional  30 more min waiting for our appetizer salad, (which I'll admit, the wrong order came and was suppose to ""quickly"" come back, however the ""quickly"" took even more time only after I asked the manager what was going on---he conveniently brought it out to me personally since it was ""just about to come to my table"").  Next came the main course.  Sensing my disappointment, the waiter asked how everything was.  Before I could respond, my 6 year old son tells him, ""It tastes like plastic!""  It had obviously been sitting out waiting to be served, same goes with my daughter's spaghetti.  The freshest thing that came out were the French fries my other son ordered.   Better training for your employees to be more efficient and better timing when serving meals would be a suggestion.  When the plate is hotter than the middle part of your main course and the food dries out from sitting underneath warmers for a long period of time, that is a problem.  While the manager was gracious enough to offer a refund (which I refused since I didn't want to come off looking like I was trying to get a free meal) we won't be coming back."
Kevin R.,"Nashville, IL",0,1,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Really bad service today at lunch.walked in after one in the afternoon,host and hostess took ten minutes to seat me,flirting with each other,on their cell phones. Waitress refused to clean my table,stating the food particles would not come off????? I told her not to bring white bread,she did. She gave me tea with no ice, refills with no ice."
Elizabeth K.,"Saint Charles, MO",142,1,,1.0,7/21/2017,"I would not waste your money or your time.  Decided to buy my team lunch today from one of their favorite restaurants so I placed an order for carry out was put on hold for over 10 minutes, then hung up on so I called back and the lady was very rude on the phone who took the order. When we picked up our food the lady just shoved the bags at me and there was so many people around you couldn't even move, by the time I got back toThe store across the store the food was cold and disgusting. Half of our food was not correct. We didn't get any of the condiments we asked for. One girl asked for french fries with cheese and was given fried cheese and the manager said that she was given fried cheese because if she was given what she ordered it would of been soggy. We took our food back up there to return it and get a refund and the manager refused to refund our money and said that part of the food was eaten and that's actually how it was packed. The manager was extremely rude and was rushing around like he didn't want to be bothered. He almost wasn't even going to replace the food that we had that was messed up because he acted like it was such an inconvenience that we brought it back up. This place is overpriced and disgusting even McDonald's doesn't act that! Our company will never return to this establishment and we will never recommend it to any of our clients in that area. I literally took the food and spit it into the trash what a waste."
Linda W.,"Saint Peters, MO",1,4,,2.0,11/30/2016,"Three of us dined at Cheesescake Factory, and all three entrees were below par in preparation and flavor, especially for the price we paid. We will not be returning thereto eat."
Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1004,1629,3.0,9/28/2015,"I was at Pedal the Cause yesterday at Chesterfield Amphitheatre and after sitting there and cheering for 2 hours we needed brunch! We decided that Cheesecake Factory was closest and best option.  The party of four ordered Eggs Benedict, Farmhouse Omelet,  Chinese Chicken Salad, and White Chicken Chili. We were all starving and all happy with our orders.  We passed on the cheesecake this time.  I'm not one to rush to chain restaurants but it hit the spot! The menu is so huge and everyone can always find something."
Toni L.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,24,1,1.0,5/12/2017,"What has happened???? I used to love this place! Our service was awful but the food was worse.  My daughter got orange chicken with no sauce and it smelled something awful.... not like orange chicken.  It was frozen tempura chicken deep fried, not fresh at all for $18.  And my chicken fettuccine was... I think an attempt at poached chicken (probably frozen or microwaved) with a canned or pouch sauce for $18. Everything was VERY bland and barely edible. I will NEVER go back!!!!  Please everyone save yourself the bad service and barely tolerable food go somewhere else!!!   We should have had pbjj at home and saved the $ 83 dollars it cost us. NEVER again!!! We ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake to go. Well my WHITE CHOCOLATE raspberry piece had absolutely no white chocolate on it.  Seriously PBJs at home!!"
Greg S.,"Valley Park, MO",0,16,,4.0,3/27/2017,"Good food for a chain restaurant , large portion sizes of course,  priced about right for portion sizes. I  recommend the skinnylicious menu. Wide selection of items especially the deserts. I recommend sitting in the bar area as this chain is very popular.  Service can be a little slow at tines due to larger crowds."
Bonnie L.,"Saint Louis, MO",77,248,1345,3.0,10/26/2014,"Stopped in for an early Saturday dinner. There seemed to be some waiting but able to grab a bar table with no wait!  Service was friendly and helpful.  Had the French Country salad and I highly recommend.  It had:  Mixed Greens, Grilled Asparagus, Fresh Beets, Goat Cheese, Candied Pecans and Vinaigrette.  I passed on the cheese but even then it was delicious. Maybe croutons would've made it excellent but there was plenty of greens. Very fresh and clean. The beets were very sweet and the asparagus were crisp and tasty.  Got the loaded baked potato tots:  Crispy Potato Tots Filled with Cheese, Bacon and Green Onion. Served with Sour Cream. They were good but probably not something I would get again. Not a lot of flavor.  I passed on desserts (already had too much food for the day) but they all looked so good and will return for something.  Grabbing a spot at the bar or bar table was great to avoid the wait. They had college football on, but not Mizzou.  Took home part of the salad and tater tots. They didn't box any sour cream so that was a bummer. Oh well. Still a good meal with no wait."
Anvita S.,"Manhattan, NY",264,202,307,4.0,11/28/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is just fantastic anywhere I go. We went in a big group of 10 and had a great time for dinner last night. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps, dynamite shrimp and spinach artichoke dip for the appetizer and they were all amazing. The sauce on the wraps makes it taste very authentic. The shrimp dipping sauce is super addictive. For the main course we got chicken Madeira (kind of like a chicken Marsala which was nice), bistro shrimp pasta (favorite!), smokehouse BBQ burger (delicious onion rings on top) and avocado egg rolls (bit on the salty side). We also got the crab cakes as an entree but there were 6 very small pieces so it's really only a good appetizer for one.  For the drinks, the virgin pina colada was amazing - perfect balance of pineapple and coconut. So good we had to order 2. We also got the pineapple mojito which was strong but very well mixed. Loved it."
Jeff C.,"Red Bud, IL",0,1,,1.0,5/14/2017,Not the best experience.  Mother's Day disappointment.  Wait was not bad but understandable.  Place was dirty with misc stuff on the floor such as forks and napkins.  Food was average at best.  Prices not a good value.  Since when is a slice of cheesecake $8.00 anyway?  Party of 5 spent $116.00 with tip.  Not going back.  Sorry.
Savannah M.,"Boone Township, MO",0,8,3,1.0,4/22/2017,"It took way too long to get seated. I understand they're busy, but I also understand they're shit at seating. I was told it would take 50 minutes to be seated. When asking about seats the hostess was rude. Ended up taking about 2 hours to get seated. Very disappointed. Might re-yelp because our waiter did not write down our orders."
Lisa T.,"Irvine, CA",120,1,,1.0,8/13/2016,"I was excited to go to the Cheesecake Factory for my Birthday until I waited 3 hours to be seated. I waited 10 min longer than my entire table for my food. I was charged for my Birthday desert. I left my box with my cheesecake that I had to pay $8 for on the table, went back to get it & no one helped me find it. They said ""you can go look for it"" and it wasn't there but they did nothing but keep chatting to one another. Sorry but I am VERY disappointed"
Jennifer S.,"Ballwin, MO",3,6,10,5.0,6/16/2016,"I came just for cheesecake.  True to the name, they have many varieties.  I had difficulty choosing, there were so many delicious sounding ones!!! I had the white chocolate raspberry.  It was absolutely divine!!! The decor was very nice, as was the server."
Krish J.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,1,,1.0,12/6/2016,Worst restaurant . Highly racial though food was ok. The server with name amber m  for no reason picked up the Ame**can  race and initiated confrontation when we were explaining the bill split differences.      They shud have made entry possible for selected race but they want money from all races but reluctant to serve others .
Jen L.,"Bella Vista, AR",8,110,51,2.0,12/24/2015,I love the Cheesecake Factory the last one we were at in California was amazing but this one is slacking on some aspects.  Please tend to your bathrooms. There were two stalls out of toilet paper that's frustrating for everyone.  The atmosphere is dark but people can still feel when a table is dirty. Clean up spills right away. I almost fell on my bottom because of a wet spot on the floor. Check your silverware is clean with no dried on food before you lay it down  Half of my miso salmon was burnt.... You have no idea how frustrating this was to my because this is one of my favorite dishes ever....   Overall this was a bad experience but we're not going to right off you yet. I understand you get busy but some things you just cannot slack on.  Our waitress was sweet and attentive
Jason B.,"Ballwin, Saint Louis, MO",19,101,269,4.0,2/19/2015,"I like coming here because the foods good, you get a lot of it and the waitresses are so nice.    My only complaint is the lighting.  I don't mind some mood lighting but when I have to pick up the menu to read it's pretty dark.  I saw a waitress using a flashlight to check to see if there tables were clean.   Had the meatloaf. It was topped with a brown gravy and mushrooms.  It came with mashed potatoes with brown gravy and mushrooms and a corn succotash.   The meatloaf was ok. Nothing special.  I like my moms meatloaf better because it's made with ketchup.   I could do without the corn succotash.  It has no favor.  Just corn with a bunch of different vegetables.  Next time if that comes with my meal I will ask if I can get something different for a side."
D S.,"O'Fallon, MO",0,7,,1.0,1/3/2017,I don't usually go to the Cheesecake Factory because of the expense and the distance from my home. I probably go once a year.  Last year I went and my entree which was like a chimichanga was supposed to be served warm but it was more cold. Not very appetizing. We went today I ordered a chopped salad without blue cheese.  They made it with blue cheese anyway. It was blended in so I didn't notice til after a few bites. The waitress offered to have the kitchen make me one to take home but I wasn't going straight home. She should have offered to take it off bill or give me free cheesecake. The cheesecake was great as usual but not happy with meal.
