Carol S.,"Fenton, MO",0,16,,2.0,1/21/2015,"My second or third time, food is ok, but the crammed together tables leave much to be desired if you want to enjoy lunch with someone. The neighbors hear every word, look at your order when it comes, try to chat, etc. Too noisy and claustrophobic for my taste. I had the Renee which is a salad (extra for Ceasar), chicken salad sandwich, corn soup, diet coke.The corn soup was very yellow and not very tasty. I expected flavors other than just thickened corn. I get that is is ""corn"" soup, but it had no visual appeal.  My guest had a salad and a sandwich which I assume she enjoyed. But really, $3.95 for a lemonade? You are in a chain and not a very hospitable one at that. Even after waiting 25 minutes, our buzzer went off and we awkwardly stood there for probably 5 minutes. Call me up when you are actually ready to seat me."
Kenny M.,"Lake Ozark, MO",4,10,,5.0,8/30/2013,"The menu has a variety of things to choose from with the food almost always being good. There's even a skinny menu for those trying to stay skinny. They have a new s'mores cheesecake that is really good, but I think it's a good idea to split it with someone because there cheesecakes always fill me up"
P M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,50,,1.0,12/26/2014,Very very cold food. Had to send my Tex Mex Eggrolls back because they were cold. In the meantime my companion finished his meal so I got to sit and watch him eat all night. Good times - stay away
Joey J.,"Malibu, CA",64,158,48,5.0,8/23/2013,"A massive corporate galactic palace of over-portioned decadence, with a Skinnylicious menu for the strong of will. The quality tends be consistent and reliable, the service friendly and prompt."
Jeff G.,"Ballwin, MO",1,14,,5.0,2/9/2014,Hands down the best casual restaurant for the money in St. Louis.
Ling B.,"Columbia, MO",0,15,,3.0,12/30/2014,"Food is great but service is so so.  Rarely you see any smile from any server.  From host to waitress to bus person, no smile.  It's like they are doing us a great favor by serving us."
M M.,"Near North Riverfront, Saint Louis, MO",0,6,,3.0,12/18/2011,We were 5 People and had to wait over 1 hour. ANd then we get a table for 4 Persons! Food was really good and a lot.  Waitress was rude and it was very loud there.
Gina O.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,8,1,5.0,11/16/2013,"Ask for George! He's incredible and will go out of his way to make sure you feel taken care of. Also get the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate cheesecake. No guarantees, but it may change your life."
Valencia G.,"Irvine, CA",8,3,1,5.0,9/2/2013,"I just wanted to take the time to write this review thanking the general manager Michael.  We came during a busy afternoon to eat lunch. We had wanted bar seating but all appeared to be taken when we arrived. Michael appeared promptly out of no where and informed us that he had a bar table that was open, simply because he heard us asking the hostess.  Not only did he escort us to the table, but he also cleaned it for us which he did not have to do.  I was very impressed with his customer service and trying to accommodate the patrons. I'm sure as one of the general managers there, he many other responsibilities as well. It is hard these days to find people who go above and beyond in their job, but Michael is one of them. Our waitress Linda was just as courteous and professional. She served us promptly and  checked on us regularly to make sure we were doing ok. The food as usual was great for TCF.  We were visiting from out of town, so thank you Michael and Linda for making our eating experience at this TCF a great one. Valencia and Mark"
John D.,"Chicago, IL",86,275,6,5.0,7/28/2010,"Never a bad case of food here. I always enjoy their food and I naturally get very full really fast, so I am excited when I get to take it home to eat later! I recommend just getting the deep fried mac n' cheese balls, even as an appetizer they can fill you up. As far as their liquor goes I only have craved a beverage of poisonous nature only once since I turned 21. I got a pomegranate mojito and it was decent. I can't really keep in a regular one so adding fruity flavouring (even though it was probably syrup) was a nice touch. I can't believe I drank the whooooole thing! lol"
Peter P.,"Edwardsville, IL",39,40,3,4.0,1/7/2013,"This is a chain.  I am picky.  I was predisposed to hate this place, and I did not.  In fact, our food was delicious.  As much as I wanted to cluck my tongue and denigrate this commercial juggernaut, I found very little to complain about.  Huevos Rancheros?  Delish!"
Linda B.,"Saint Louis, MO",3,28,,2.0,4/7/2010,"The cheesecake is a 4 star but the food is a 1 star.  Their menu has too many selections - makes it hard to choose.  Their prices are high even if there are large portions.  I've eaten there twice and both times ended up having stomach issues.  When I think of the Cheesecake Factory I always feel heaviness in my stomach.   I love the decor and the atmosphere.  Our server was very attentive and polite, but the food just doesnt' fit my taste and the prices are high for a casual dining experience."
Karl W.,"Wentzville, MO",1,16,2,5.0,6/5/2011,"Everytime here i have a wonderful experience.  The food is always great, the service is great, and the menu is extensive-probably one of the largest menus I have seen at any restaurant.  Plus the ambiance is very comfortable.  Tonight I had the famous factory meatloaf; it was great.  My personal favorite though is still the Shepherd's pie."
Jacqueline C.,"Saint Louis, MO",219,313,349,4.0,12/23/2010,"Every time I visit CF I always say the same thing.....why is the menu so darn big!!!???? I love the options, but holy moly!! It's a bit confusing.  Either way my most recent visit included the soup of the day a cream of chicken with artichokes, yum! and the Farm house salad with goat cheese and beets. It was a refreshing light lunch. I think I might actually like this location better than the Galleria, it was less wait time and the restaurant appeared more clean."
Andrew K.,"St Peters, MO",16,18,2,4.0,4/25/2011,"Well I have loved the Cheesecake factory for years. My most recent visit was Saturday. I find that their food is good quality and they have a huge selection for picky eaters. I am not a picky but my date was and we both found something good. This time I chose the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad just because I love tuna that is pretty much raw but seared just a little bit. I was not disappointed, everything was very fresh and flavorful. I don't even need to speak of the quality of the cheesecake, it is always good here.  I suggest making reservations as the wait on weekend nights is usually pretty long at this location. Checked out the movie Water For Elephants afterward, pretty good."
Joan D.,"Chesterfield, MO",1,7,,1.0,12/13/2011,"This place has a BAD case of ""Not MY JOB"".  I went in for a to-go order and placed said order at 14:23.  Was told 15 minutes, recieved cold food at 14: 52, obviously sat on counter for quite a while.  While waiting, hostess kept disappearing for to eat lunch while guests comig in couldn't figure out if they needed to seat themselves or not.  One group of three walked out because line/wait for an empty restaraunt was too long.  Servers standing around apparently can't seat people.  Only after a woman came from the back to check on a wet bench was I asked if I needed help.  Explained that I had been waiting twice as long as indicated.  She disappeared to the kitchen and after watching her pack up my items came out and said ""Sorry for the wait"".  -- Me too.   Poor service when plenty of servers were there, not one smile from hostess or staff, this place is way to expensive to treat the customers as such an inconvenience.  Will I be back?  No- too many restaraunts actually want to serve and welcome you.  My one consolation is my dining group (137 members) will no doubt spend a good deal of time discussing this and many will take my suggestion to STAY AWAY!"
Lauren L.,"South Richmond Hill, NY",234,386,3,1.0,8/31/2009,"I love dessert. Let me rephrase that. I LOVE L-O-V-E dessert.  I love cheesecake. Factories are good too. They produce stuff we need.  The concept is fine. But I hate this place. The food is gross. It really is. There is WAY too much stuff on the menu, the portions are gargantuan, it's overpriced for the crap that it is, it's just not even worth it. And as was mentioned previously, the calorie counts are ridiculous. Just absurd. Like if you were feeling extrodonarily hoggish at a meal there, you could eat your week's worth of fat by just an entree and a piece of cheesecake. Think fast food is the worst thing you can eat? Think again. I'm not some skinny bitch or a health nut or a doctor, I'm just using common sense. And to top it off, their cheesecake isn't very good. There is much better cheesecake to be had in St. Louis."
Shawn M.,"Lake Saint Louis, MO",27,96,5,5.0,9/5/2012,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. The menu is overwhelming, but I've never had anything bad. With a menu that huge, you aren't going to experience some utopian dish, but I can't imagine being too disappointed. The prices are steep, but the portion sizes are massive, so you're basically paying for 2 meals if you don't finish it and take it home. The cheesecake is delicious as you'd expect and the hardest part is trying to decide which kind to try."
Aaron S.,"Macomb, IL",1,15,1,5.0,7/9/2012,"Always a safe and delicious choice. Food is consistently good and the wait staff is always attentive. It is always busy and loud, however. Expect a wait. I'm not a fan of cheesecake in general but I love their black-out cake. Also, the raspberry lemonade is always a good choice."
Steve M.,"Grover, MO",12,44,3,4.0,1/4/2010,"TCF has been around for a while and I have never found a reason for going.  I mean  go to the mall, I get hungry, and it's attached to the mall but for some damn reason I just never went.  Well this past holiday season I was looking for a place to have a meal that was to be paid for by someone else that was located in or around the mall.. TFC, this is your lucky day.   I have to admit that I have a love hate relationship that goes along with mall attached eateries because  you really don't know what you are going to get but I have to say, the food at TFC was good all around.  The service however was excellent and while it could have just been our server, she was awesome and that really does go a long way towards your dining experience.    On the food side though, the burger I had was pretty damn awesome, it was freaking huge and cooked exactly as ordered.  My only complaint was it was a little under seasoned and the grilled onions I ordered were too big and under cooked so they were little chewy. I also found an onion skin attached to one of them but these issues aside it was a damn tasty burger and as good as just about any I have had in a while and I love me some god damn burgers! The wife also ordered some sort of sandwich but I was too blinded by the meaty goodness of my meal to really remember WTF it was but I do recall her liking it.  Overall I enjoyed the hell out of my meal and will definitely be back, I may only go for the burger, but I will return."
