Meghan G.,"Southwest Garden, Saint Louis, MO",0,7,,4.0,5/27/2014,Really delicious food with tons of options! Love coming here for lunch. Our server is always really nice and helpful as well as the hostess and managers.
Mike R.,"O'Fallon, MO",3,70,34,4.0,3/9/2012,"They have something for everybody plus great cheesecake.  Price is a little high, but you get great decor, service, and most of all great food.  If you have not tried it, then you should."
Nancy S.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,2,,4.0,4/4/2015,"We picked up a carry out order from this Cheesecake Factory location, as we have several times before. Unfortunately, the order was messed up. We ordered our guacamole without cilantro, and it was just loaded with cilantro, and therefore not at all enjoyable for us. In addition, we ordered a meal size ceasar salad but the person who took my order over the phone keyed in an appetizer size. However, when I called to let the manager know of the problems, hoping to get some type of compensation for a future visit, he readily offered to refund our credit card for the amount of the entire meal. I was both shocked and pleased by this gesture, and the manager was so concerned that we were satisfied with his handling of the situation. I wish all managers in stores and restaurants were so willing to accept responsibility for mistakes. They do happen. We love the Cheesecake Factory and are happy to go back despite this one unhappy experience."
C M.,"O'Fallon, MO",2,97,,4.0,11/2/2013,"Have visited this restaurant many times. Yes the menu is huge but great choices. Every thing is good but we do tend to split the entree or get something off the small bite menu. We don't get cheesecake every time but have enjoyed it every time. It does get noisy in there, some of that seems to come from the staff clattering dishes to just loud groups.  Lots of choices in the area but this is still tops."
Michael E.,"Ridgefield, CT",18,143,14,2.0,1/22/2009,"I do not ""get"" the Cheesecake Factory concept. I mean, why do 80% of their dishes have to be a zillion calories? Are they trying to make their customers look like they come from Wisconsin? Just one slice of TCF carrot cake is over 1500 calories with 84 grams of fat no less. They don't limit the exorbitant level of fat to desserts, a regular meal is enough calories from fat for a week. Their ""Weight Management Salads"" are 600 calories each.  Should be called ""Manage to get Fatter"" salads (Chinese Chicken salad is 1600).  The ""low carb"" cheesecake does have only 6 carbs, but with a penalty - 57 grams of fat (30 saturated).   Biggest gripe?  TCF won't divulge any of their lack of nutritional information.  I think people who order a green salad with chicken have the right to know that they have to run 6 miles to burn it off. I guess I should know better from a place with ""cheesecake"" in their name. If you really want to load up on fatty, carbed out, high caloric, overly sweet dishes, this is the place. If you are also included in the ""ladies that lunch"" set (quite crowded with them during the lunch hour) the factory is for you.  With all that being said, I do like the bar area. Decent drinks, not overly priced, and good service. Nice place to go before seeing a movie at the mall."
Michael J.,"Eureka, MO",19,1,2,4.0,7/19/2011,"Our second time here in the past few months and the food was terrific but the service seems to be lacking.  If you like Chinese food, try the cashew chicken. It was the best I have had in a long time."
Mark O.,"Saint Charles, MO",1,47,2,5.0,7/3/2008,"Consistently excellent, loved by everyone I've joined (kids, teens, adults & seniors).  An encyclopedic menu caters to about every palate, but my favorites are: drink -- lemon drop martini (not very macho, but tasty so who cares? at least it ain't pink!) appetizer -- avocado spring rolls & sweet tamale corn cakes dinner -- eggplant sangwich -- mmmmmm dessert -- do they serve dessert? oh yeah, anything chocolate + cheesecake = happiness."
Greg K.,"Chesterfield, Saint Louis, MO",0,3,,4.0,7/27/2013,Red velvet cheesecake.  I don't need it but i love it. The Cheesecake Factory is very consistently good. The music is a bit too loud and some of the seating is a little cozy with the neighbors but all in all decent chain.
p m.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,53,3,1.0,1/27/2012,"Made reservations 1 1/2 weeks ago.  Told the reservations person we would be celebrating two big events.  Asked for and was promised a particular well situated table in a certain room.  When we arrived they didn't have our reservation!   We were eventually seated but the waitress for that section ignored us for 15 minutes.  In the meantime another party who came later was seated at ""our"" original table.  Do not trust this restaurant!"
Julia P.,"Saint Louis, MO",37,146,3,2.0,4/6/2010,"I love me some cheesecake! And I love restaurants with diverse menus. The Cheesecake Factory goes overboard on the diversity. Their 20 page menu (no joke) has literally everything, which makes it nearly impossible to choose. Despite the vast array of food, I've never eaten anything here that made me swoon. Usually I waddle away (because their portions are huge and I have control issues) feeling underwhelmed and poor. The Cheesecake Factory is SO expensive for the quality of the food! I really think the money goes towards the crazy decor. It's like Atlantis meets Atlantic City in Italy. Make sense? Exactly.  On this particular trip, I had the Cajun Jumbalya Pasta, which was okay. The waitress raved about it like it was sex on a plate. Not so much. It was fine, but not worth $17. Not in any way, shape, or form. Mom got the Memphis burger and loved it, but felt nasty later that night. The drinks are overpriced too, go figure. The service was good, and for once I did not wait to be seated. I had the pineapple upside down cheesecake, which was really great and almost made me give 3 stars. Almost."
A S.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,4,,2.0,10/18/2012,I have been to this cheesecake factory location at least 3 times and my experience has always been poor. Restaurant is always packed (especially on weekends)hence service is slow. The menu has lots of variety. I have tried different things from the menu and food is mediocre at best. Drinks also are watered down with tons of ice.
Jesda G.,"Chesterfield, MO",4,38,2,4.0,10/17/2009,"Had a couple appetizers and dishes come out cold, which leads me to believe they freeze some of their food. Service is excellent, however, and the manager was quick to apologize and eliminate the charge. Cheesecakes emphasize variety over quality, but they're open late so its a good place to get a drink and some dessert before going to bed. Prices are higher but portions are very generous."
Tracy W.,"High Ridge, MO",19,37,141,5.0,2/27/2009,This has the best food and the best choices of deserts.  So many different items to choose from.  The decor is amazing.  I will warn you though there is usually a wait for a table.  the price is very resonable though.  So many cheese cakes to choose from for desert.
Munsok S.,"Saint Louis, MO",13,15,,4.0,7/19/2011,"the menu is huge, but the flavor matches!  i am a regular and a fan..."
Andrea B.,"Omaha, NE",4,23,,2.0,2/20/2011,It's cheesecake factory. What else is there to say? Food is fine but it's definitely a much better dining experience than to try to order curbside take out. There's nowhere to park if doing the traditional walk-in-and-get-your-food takeout if you try this on a weekend. We ordered online for a traditional take-out but with nowhere to park I pulled into the curbside and called to let them know I was there. I was immediately placed on hold for 8 minutes. Hung up. Called back and before I could be placed on hold again let them know I wanted to change to curbside. After waiting another 10 minutes ( so far it was 15 min past the time my order was to be ready) I called one last time and was told they were waiting on the grilled salmon. After paying about $60+ for two entrees I got home to find minuscule portion sizes and cold food. Bad experience... and with all the hassle we probably won't go back. The employees all seemed a bit flustered which added to the annoyance.
Maggie W.,"Saint Louis, MO",15,160,153,4.0,8/30/2008,"I would have to agree that the avocado spring rolls are amazing.  But while their menu is vast, I think they need to pare it down a bit for the sake of quality.  Last time I ordered an orange chicken dish, which wasn't that good.  The Asian and Mexican dishes do not even compare to the quality at Asian and Mexican restaurants.  I say if you've got it on the menu, it shouldn't simply be offered as an option; it should be amazing.  I'd have to say, though, that their burgers are quite good (it's hard to go wrong here, though), and their chicken madeira is always yummy (it's their most popular dish, too).  I'm not big on cheesecake but I hear there's is delicious.  I also dig the appetizer bread they serve."
