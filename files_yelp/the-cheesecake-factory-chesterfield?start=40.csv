Roxie J.,"Wentzville, MO",8,38,11,2.0,11/15/2016,"Came here on a busy Saturday at 6pm so yes we expected to wait, however we were told 1 hour and 30 minutes for a party of 4+ a toddler. We waited 2 hours and told them perhaps we have a broken buzzer. The first time one person from our party asked she was told about 15 minutes you guys will be next. Well 25 minutes later we returned and were told there were several people who were cashed out and they are just waiting for them to get up. The hostess then said, the next person to get up- that table will be yours. (My frustration came from her saying that, don't say it- if it's not true. So after seeing multiple parties walk out the door we were still there waiting for Another 10 minutes. Finally my husband goes to speak with the manager and he says he same 15 minute line and he told him that is what we're just told. We saw 2-3 parties buzzer go off and was shown to their seat. Finally we were called. I'm not reviewing this based on wait time, I'm giving them 2 stars for the lack of communication while totally overlooking us. I also ordered my fav Hershey's cheesecake and the slice I was brought look as if someone had stuck their fork in it. I wanted to exchange it but being that some things on our order were already wrong and we were there for over three hours, I didn't bother. Overall, I expected better from The Cheesecake Factory in Chesterfield, still enjoyed the family outing."
Amy M.,"St. Charles, MO",64,45,6,5.0,4/7/2016,"Everything on the menu is incredible !! Each selection I've made over the years has satisfied and impressed me.   I highly recommend the Tuscan Chicken - it is hands down my go to!!  When you walk into this beautiful ambiance, make sure to ask for Mary as your server.  She will not disappoint !! Thank you MARY!!"
Antonio M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1017,180,1195,5.0,9/12/2014,"I love this place! The atmosphere, the service, location, the food, the variety offered on the menu, etc. I've been to this location multiple times and love this place, I've never had a bad experience here. We always request the same server as well, his name is Mobin. Not only does he provide an extremely friendly and quick service but he makes sure everything is excellent.  The food is always served in a timely manner, fresh, and cooked to order. They have so many options on the menu, all served to perfection. They have pizzas, Chinese, pizza, burgers, wings, fish, pasta, etc. I've tried a few different items and all are great. I really enjoyed their margarita pizza with extra basil. I've also had their burger, it was juicy and delicious. Their ranch is amazing, it has a garlicky taste to, so good! Also I recommend their calamari, fish and chips, and also clam chowder soup. All are EXCELLENT!"
Ashley C.,"Saint Robert, MO",77,3,,5.0,9/22/2016,"My first time was such a great experience. I had the Chicken Madeira, it came with a side of mash potatoes that left me inlove! I added a side of Mac n' cheese that was so creamy and rich. I just wanna know where the people who leave bad reviews go to eat? Because I haven't found any other place cheaper with the quality of this food. It's pricey but you get some real good food!"
Vazz Z.,"Saint Louis, MO",3,37,18,1.0,8/17/2015,"I went back here again for dinner after a late night movie screening on Saturday night. We were very hungry so we wanted a quick dinner. The restaurant has really gone downhill. When we walked inside, we were hit with a very pungent, foul smell! We asked for seating outside in the patio because we couldn't stand the smell.  The water I got was dirty, and the bread were warm but they didn't taste fresh--like they came straight out of a bag and heated in the microwave. I ordered the Diane steak, and it was too wet with too much gravy. However, the mashed potatoes WERE excellent. The food is HORRIBLE! Don't come here if you want a good dining experience (either with a partner, family and/or friends).  This restaurant used to be really good when it first opened a few years ago, but it has declined BIG TIME. The only worthwhile thing about this place are the cheesecakes, which you can take out and eat at home."
Nicki M.,"O'Fallon, MO",35,18,3,1.0,10/17/2016,"Have eaten here a couple of times, and although the prices are steep, the food tasted good.  We had planned on having a family dinner at the Chesterfield location on a Sunday.  We had a group of nine; however, one person in our group is 88, and we wanted to make sure we could get a table so she didn't have to wait long.  I called the restaurant around 11 a.m. and asked if there was any way we could get a table reserved for 9 around 5:30.  I knew they didn't take reservations, but thought given our situation, maybe they would accommodate us somehow.  I was told, no, they wouldn't hold a table and to call before leaving home and they would work on getting a table together for us so the wait wouldn't be long.  So I called just before leaving home and the rude person that answered the phone said she didn't know who I spoke to earlier, but that they would not do that, they would only hold tables for six or less; however, she said they weren't busy, so we should be able to get a table.  Well, if you weren't busy then how hard is it to hold a table for us in a half hour?  I politely asked to speak to a manager as this young girl on the phone obviously didn't care that we had an elderly person with us.  She put me on hold and then came back and said, okay, we'll do it, in a not so nice tone, not even letting me speak to a manager.  Frustrated that we are willing to come to your restaurant with nine people, our bill with drinks would undoubtedly have been between $200 and $300, yet they didn't seem happy at all to accommodate us.  This mall is going downhill fast, stores and restaurants are closing, you would have thought they would have been happy to help us.  After hanging up, I promptly called the Brick House, and they were more than willing to help us out...in a half an hour!  Thank you Brick House!  Will not go back to Cheesecake Factory.  When your prices are high and food is good, not great, customer service should be key..."
Brian R.,"Saint Louis, MO",84,245,773,4.0,6/15/2016,"The menu is huge, so it's a great place to take picky eaters. The miso salmon is my favorite dish, but everything is very good here. The portions are large, so you won't leave hungry. As the name implies, cheesecake is the star, especially when done a la mode. My favorites are the cookie dough, Chris's outrageous, and Reese's."
Anne V.,"Springfield, MO",0,2,1,1.0,8/23/2015,I ordered the shrimp scampi for takeout since I stayed at a hotel close to the restaurant. This was the most bland shrimp scampi I've ever had and it wasn't even warm. I arrived for pickup before it was ready so it wasn't sitting around. Do yourself a favor and eat anywhere but here.
Jennifer R.,"Cottleville, MO",22,22,46,1.0,8/13/2015,"This has always been a favorite restaurant. But seriously... Two times in the last 3 week my boyfriend and I have gone in and ordered a chocolate shake. No ice cream. What?!?  Are you kidding? How does that happen. The first time we were told they were out of Shake ice cream but they could use the ice cream in the bakery. Uh. Ok. Why are you telling me this? You couldn't have just made the shake???  Tonight. A special occasion. My boyfriend wanted a chocolate shake. No ice cream.  We were told again they could use this other ice cream. After we complained. If that's an option, why didn't you just do it? I'm not going to have you make it now and spit in it.  The best part was that the lady manager got snippy with US. LAST chance, Cheesecake. It's simple supply and demand. Inventory Intro 101. Too bad."
Steve K.,"Chillicothe, IL",0,15,3,1.0,4/2/2016,3nd time here in a year both times horrible. Food not good at all again . Service bad again . It is a shame St. Louis  has very few big name restraints and this one is a disgrace
Jeremy O.,"Mountain View, CA",1,15,,1.0,10/3/2015,Was here a few weeks ago and just forgot to do a review.  This place deserves minus stars but I can't do that.  I do not know how I am the only person other than one other who seems to notice the horrible awful stench smell outside of this place.  The food used to be good years ago.  The food is okay.  But that smell outside should not be ignored.  Needless to say later I shit and it smelled like the same sewage I smelled at what I now call the Sewage Factory.  Do not go here unless you need to clean out your system and want to smell shit.
Bia R.,"Arnold, MO",8,2,,4.0,4/11/2016,"I saw a few 1 star reviews so I had reservations of going... I'm glad we went. Our server was nice, made sure our drinks were full and not over the top (fake) friendly. Our food came out in a timely manner and was good. The best was the cheese cake though! I think next time we will just go and order cheesecake. Both of our entrees were around 18-19.00. My husband got the Jamaican blackened shrimp and I got the herb crusted salmon. Both were delicious. Next time it's just cheesecake though. yum!"
John H.,"Arnold, MO",32,15,5,2.0,4/15/2016,Spaghetti came out with dried ends and was lukewarm at best.  Maybe had 2 tablespoons of sauce.  Meatballs were great!  Server was great.  Outdoor seating was cold and heaters were inadequate.
Vijay R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,2,1,1.0,10/20/2015,"Very very Bad service , mediocre food , huge portions. Been here thrice before I finally thought this place is so bad I need to let other yelpers know . Food is average .it's the service which is really lacking . Waitress took 20 min to take our order and another 30 mins to bring our food and my meal was cold !!! I wouldn't go back here if it was not for the location near the mall and amc movie theatre which I frequent often."
Rick N.,"Saint Clair, MO",16,17,,2.0,8/6/2015,"Went in for early dinner and it was very different than the usual.  Slow, slow service.  No napkins on table and few and far apart refills on drinks.  The food was fair but the long wait and poor service ruined our dinner."
Cem B.,"Rock Falls, IL",6,28,4,4.0,2/23/2015,"Ok, so we took a chance going here despite the poor reviews. I feel obligated to write a review simply to help the low rating. We (family of 5) had a good experience with the service and food. We were greeted by friendly hostesses, and our server, Mary, was very kind & accommodating.  Only complaints were the area we were seated in was too dark, and my wife's chicken burrito grande should've been called the rice burrito grande, as they were skimpy on the chicken, but too generous on the filler rice.  I also can sympathize with the other reviews that commented on the steep prices. The entrees were a little high, but our 2 Mojitos at $21.00 left us feeling like maybe we should order a cheaper drink just to take the edge off the sting of being taken on the alcohol. Total bill with 20% tip was $140.00! :-O All in all, we would welcome another visit when in the area again."
Troy K.,"Chesterfield, MO",66,88,97,3.0,1/21/2014,"This restaurant has an amazing location. Right outside the chesterfield mall! What else do you need! I do really like the ambience and even good part are the hours.  The servers are simply average, I guess because they keep busy. Often they have been late in my order and once swapped it with someone else. However, the location steals it all!"
Pat W.,"St. Peters, MO",21,75,,3.0,8/6/2016,Service was as good as can be expected on a busy Saturday.  The server was friendly and attentive.  The almond chicken salad sandwich was good but had too much pepper.  The potato soup was great but the greens salad was bitter.  I would give them another shot.  Don't sit outside unless you want to fight sweat bees.
Carlos K.,"Sacramento, CA",330,331,212,2.0,7/19/2012,"The place you go to when you need food in a pinch and you're only St. Louis for the night and you're totally oblivious to the other choices in the area. Tracey W, the Yelper in St. Louis who is my current crush, tells me that Chik Fil A is the best choice for pigging out in Chesterfield.  I love Chik Fil A.  It's the way fast food chicken should be.  Good. Cheesecake Factory was chosen because it was familiar and I THOUGHT that I could get something that was good enough to satisfy me after my trip from the Left Coast.  It was also chosen because Macaroni Grill and PF Chang's are well...fucking disgusting.   I should have used Xanax (hidden meaning.  I don't pop pills, but I DO pop bottles) to satisfy my needs and the hotel restaurant to kill my hunger because that 'Kobe' burger was disappointing.  The fries were something that the Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald could make with more success.   I get it though.  The cheesecake lures you in like flies to shit.   Heed my advice.  If you find yourself in St. Louis under the same circumstances as me, go to Chik Fil A. Quick tip:  Eat a banh mi at one of the local Viet places.  It's cheaper and you'll make the world a better place and feel like Andrew Zimmern at the same time.  Win.  Win."
Karen T.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,10,,5.0,1/29/2016,"Stopped in for a quick bite after shopping.  Happy Hour sounded perfect.  The food was great....but the server - Melissa- she was amazing!  It is rare to get such great service in the bar area.  Had to write the review just to applaud her. While I was comfortable, I like it cold, employees should not be allowed to enter or exit through the bar door exit.  It is drafty enough in the bar area with the main door opening and closing....but add in that side door and it is bad."
