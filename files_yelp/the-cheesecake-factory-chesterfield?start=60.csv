Cindy J.,"Saint Louis, MO",17,7,2,4.0,8/12/2016,"Awesome food and good service. The Thai lettuce wraps are the best! I came in on a busy weekend so I knew the service would be a tad slower than usual. The pasta da Vinci is really good and has a unique taste. The only reason I took off a star was because the waitress never gave me my extra bread I requested but she was extremely nice, just under a lot of pressure. Other than that, I highly recommend!"
Derek S.,"San Jose, CA",4629,2041,7554,3.0,7/27/2010,"My friend wanted to come here for her birthday so we tried to make a reservation... The hostess informed us that they only accept 30-minute call-ahead service.  We called ahead 30 minute prior to our desired dining hour and still had to wait a full hour before we were seated... Our waitress Hannah was friendly.  The avocado eggrolls were tasty and came cut up in 6 pieces. It wasn't too oily. The hand-battered onion rings were a little too oily and the batter tasty nasty after the onion rings became cold... The Everything Pizza was fresh and tasty. It wasn't too oily and didn't contain too much msg either. The Miso Salmon was fresh, perfectly cooked, and moist. The presentation was pretty good as was the huge portion size! ...don't forget to ask for a birthday sundae if someone in your party has a special birthday when dining here! :D"
Melanie S.,"Wentzville, MO",2,4,4,4.0,12/14/2015,"My second time here.. Took my husband  here ordered burger, he had Kobe burger and I had factory burger.  I couldn't really finish the burger because I ordered side Cesar salad which was huge!  We ordered chocolate mousse for dessert to go!   A bit pricy but it's what you expect.  I'd go back."
Faith R.,"Imperial, MO",69,82,77,5.0,10/16/2015,"Brought my daughter here for dinner. We had Steak Tacos which were spicy and delicious. Just the right amount of avocado, vegetables, meat, and sauces. They were paired with rice and beans. The Macaroni and Cheese Burger paired a tasty beef patty with a perfectly sized, fried, ball of mac and cheese. This combination was an odd pair but we were so glad we tried it. We then had the Salted Caramel and the Banana Cream Cheesecakes. Salted Caramel was a caramel cheesecake with an amazing salted caramel topping and sat inside a blondie cookie crust. The banana had fresh slices of banana!! Both were creamy and extremely tasty. We were way too full when we left but we enjoyed every morsel. The service was terrific and the restaurant is clean and very trendy. The menu was like 20 pages long. Everything from salad to tacos to pasta to amazing appetizers. You will find something you like here. Great experience!!"
Mark C.,"Saint Louis, MO",31,19,,1.0,4/25/2015,Terrible wait. The call ahead is a lie so don't be fooled. I called ahead and was told when we got here it would be less than 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I was told it would be twenty minutes. When you ad in the call ahead it is over an hour. Total system failure.
Kate C.,"Fenton, MO",7,29,1,4.0,5/26/2015,"I finally went to see what the fuss was about. Some of it I really enjoyed, but all-in-all it was only okay. First and foremost, it was so DARK in there. I could barely see my friend across the table, and I'm not exaggerating. My dinner was good, not great. About the same as any chain restaurant it seemed. But yeah, ok, the dessert was phenomenal."
Stephanie M.,"Sullivan, MO",3,1,,2.0,6/25/2015,"I love Cheese Cake Factory, but this was hands down the worst service I've had at any restaurant. We were just going in for a quick meal and cheesecake. After a 25 minute wait for our waiter to come take our order for drinks, we decided it would be faster to order appetizers instead of a meal. After an hour long wait, it's needless to say that we were pretty disappointed. The only redeeming quality was the cheesecake that we took to go."
Joshua H.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,18,,4.0,6/22/2015,"My hamburger was pretty good. My side of fries tasted good too. However, the thing that I liked the most is what this place is known for. Their cheesecake is amazing! It is absolutely a must to try their lemon meringue cheesecake, if you decide to go there. If you're gluten-free, this is a good place to go. They have many options for gluten-free diners and can make accommodations."
Doc H.,"Edwardsville, IL",0,17,20,3.0,6/21/2014,"Went here on a Friday night. About a 20 minute wait. Great location and decor. Awesome looking bar. Probably the largest/longest menu I have ever seen, but sometimes that scares me. They can't possibly do a good job on all of these dishes, but ours were good. Steak Diane, pasta, burger...... All very tasty. Great martinis but way overpriced. Cheesecake desert to go.  This place has a unique niche in the restaurant arena. They must be successful because they had a big crowd. Great location helps them. Not the best value."
O W.,"Saint Louis, MO",54,213,117,3.0,8/28/2014,Portions way too large...food is just ok.  The worst part is it's always very loud and the older people can't hear!   Not me...my parents and others.   Plus if you look at the menu closely...there is very little really healthy foods...low calories but not healthy! I only go with a group when it's their choice!
Jaymeh H.,"Leslie, MO",0,8,,3.0,11/24/2015,"Food was okay, the money maker is their cheesecake.  Service it's fantastic and very flexible."
Tim M.,"St Charles, MO",1,22,8,1.0,2/13/2015,"Burnt chips, dry chicken, poor service.  What else needs to be said? To top it off, when the waitress boxed our food up to go, only half of our order was boxed. The rest was tossed. Needless to say, we didn't order cheesecake and we won't be back."
Jeff S.,"Wildwood, MO",141,124,25,4.0,3/7/2015,This is a great place for us to meet the kids when they want to hang out at the mall for awhile with their friends.  We can stop in for a drink and eventually meet up with them and their friends to grab dinner.  The menu is extensive enough that everyone can find something they like and the portions are large enough that you can expect to take home part of it for lunch the next day.  I love their fish tacos.  One of my favorite places to get them.  I'd also echo the comments on the lighting.  We typically need to use the flashlights on our iPhones to see the menus.  I'm glad to see it's just not me!
Scott B.,"Ballwin, MO",0,3,,1.0,5/21/2016,We eat at this restaurant frequently. Usually a good experience. Today service was very poor.  One meal under cooked . Severs inattentive and snarky.  Walking out person at next table commented similar experience.
Ritesh M.,"Culver City, CA",21,13,7,4.0,7/26/2015,Saturday night - long wait.. But great food.. Pasta w/marina sauce and added veggies - was a hit.. Tried the Asian lettuce wrap n yummy.. Drinks are great.. Great place to eat out with family n friends..
Paul L.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,5,,2.0,5/13/2016,"Went for Mothers Day.  Ordered the Pit Beef French Dip.  Very disappointed by the thick fat-filled pieces of beef.  Literally had to discard two different bites into a towel.  Left second half of sandwich on the plate.  Had to pull two pieces of hair from mouth after eating a piece of the delicious wheat bread.  Did not say anything to staff because I didn't want to be looked at as someone trying to get a free meal.  Three drinks, three entrees, a kids entree, and apple juice, $105 plus $20 tip.  Daughter and ex love this place, but last time I will be taking them here."
Steven Y.,"Maryland Heights, Saint Louis, MO",14,155,52,5.0,1/25/2015,"I've never had anything I don't like at the Cheesecake Factory and I almost always try something new when I'm here. What can be said other than I love the food, portions are so big it's ridiculous and their cheesecakes are creative and delicious!"
Roman G.,"Irvine, CA",4,174,29,3.0,6/9/2015,Got in late to Chesterfield so I only had about 30 minutes before they were closing. Service was ok but what you expect from a restaurant getting ready to close. Food was good and bartender was efficient.
Alex N.,"Eolia, MO",0,47,31,3.0,2/12/2015,"The cheesecake is really good and there are a lot of choices. The entrees are hit and miss; the burgers and steaks are usually good. Portions are big and there is a very, very large selection. This location is popular and gets really crowded on weekends. The downside is the prices. A family can expect to spend well over $100, especially since everyone will order cheesecake. It's a good place for special occasions and has a cool atmosphere."
Sarah E.,"St Peters, Saint Louis, MO",3,34,10,5.0,1/31/2015,"The service was THE BEST I have ever had. The food was perfection and the prices weren't the bad. My boyfriend and I each had a smoothie and a cheesecake slice, an entrée and we had 2 appetizers, I think our total was $60 before tip and we tipped $20 because of how fantastic our waiter was. He was the most courteous waitstaff I have ever had serve me and it is greatly appreciated. Definitely come here for good service, good food and a good atmosphere. The restaurant itself was amazing and the bathrooms were very clean. Would always recommend this restaurant!"
