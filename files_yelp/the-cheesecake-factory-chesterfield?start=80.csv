Ayesha A.,"Ballwin, MO",0,2,1,2.0,8/5/2015,"Every time someone in my family suggests to go to Cheesecake Factory I ask my self why I don't go here more? But then I remember why I don't!! The handful of times I've been here the food has always been either cold or the wrong order. I don't know what it is, maybe it's because it's later in the evenings when I go or something I don't know! Service is okay, but sometimes a little rude. The only thing worth going for is the cheese cake! The Turtle cheesecake is delicious."
Greg K.,"Winchester, KY",14,63,42,2.0,5/6/2015,It's the Cheesecake Factory. They distract you with the tall ceilings and strange decorating and the cheesecake display at the front when you walk in. There were little gnats flying around and the bathrooms were dirty.  The food is ok. Nothing special. Just the typical huge portions. No wonder America is obese. I only went here because a co worker I'm traveling with wanted to go.
Ryan S.,"St. Louis, MO",36,107,6,5.0,3/4/2015,Valentine's day. No reservations but call a head seating saved us a lot on our wait time. The service & food were GREAT! May I suggest Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake if you like German Chocolate cake.
Tabitha T.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,59,15,5.0,9/30/2014,"This was not my first time in the cheesecake factory, I had been to one before in NY and the food was very subpar so I had no desire to return. But came to St. Louis for work and had to grab lunch that was near the hotel and this was the only place. I had the shrimp scampi over pasta it was soooooooo amazing as I cleaned the plate. I also had the vanilla sundae that came in a huge portion with my own chocolate gravy boat. Had the one in NY taste like this I would go more often."
Robert S.,"Chesterfield, Saint Louis, MO",0,40,,4.0,2/18/2016,This location is attached to the Chesterfield mall.  They have nice outdoor seating and typical Cheesecake Factory ambiance.  Service is generally above average and food is prepared well with the typical CF large portions.  Generally quite good at a moderate price point.
Sarah C.,"Quincy, IL",10,18,2,1.0,6/13/2014,"I went here tonight with my mom and best friend.  We got a pager and sat down. We waited an hour to be seated (after we had called ahead and after they told us the pager wasn't working bc they were trying to page us). The waitress was super sweet and helpful at first when we told her that we had a movie to catch.  She grabbed our order quickly, but we waited 40 minutes before she came back.  We got our food to go and ended up not even eating it because it was sitting in the car while we watched our movie.  SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED.  Spending $45 on a dinner I didn't eat."
David W.,"Saint Louis, MO",279,249,146,3.0,8/11/2013,"Was aiite, we ordered some beers and appetizers, during happy hour just to relax. Got the nachos and sliders, nothing special, and happy hour prices were moderate. They do have specials on non-domestic beer, such as blue moon on tap though during their happy hours so that is a plus."
Jason T.,"Vancouver, WA",105,128,2,3.0,10/3/2013,"Cheesecak Factory is good, consistant and meets my expectations.  This location is no different.  While their menu is expansive, it's lengthy and full of ""suggestions"" on what I need to eat.  It's really like looking at a small book. Over all it was clean, the service was OK and food was OK.  I mostly come here while traveling just because I know it's going to be consistant.  Not stellar, not great...  Just consistant."
M R.,"Saint Charles, MO",0,12,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Poor customer service over the phone by 2 of the hostess including the manager. Obviously lack of training every person I spoke with over the phone said something different. Once I got there with my family I was told the mgr was coming to speak with us and again I was misinformed, it took the mgr 1hr and 45mins to even come in talk to us after we asked how much longer we would have to wait for service. OVERALL I will not return to this location."
Paula W.,"Tampa, FL",5,34,10,4.0,12/24/2014,Food and service were great however we called and were told it wasn't  busy. We arrived witching 15 minutes and were told it was a 15-20 wait. After 30 minutes were were told it was another 15-20 minutes. The manager was unapologetic. The only saving grace is that it was Xmas Eve.
Rebecca D.,"Chicago, IL",1,6,2,1.0,7/25/2014,"DO NOT, under any circumstances, come here with a big group (meaning more than four) especially for a special occasion because it will more or less be ruined by the incompetent hostesses and management. We had a party of eight meeting there for my birthday dinner on a Thursday night. Eight is a lot of people but we called ahead (when I got passed off to three different people before finally giving our request). However, after we arrived, checked in,  and received our pager, we were told that there would STILL be a 15-20 minute wait. Of course we waited and watched dozens of other people seated before us. We ended up waiting about 40 minutes. The manager blamed our wait on the people that were taking too long with their meal. At this nonsense I wondered why they allowed call-ahead seating at all if they are going to completely ignore it once you're there and have no backup plan or alternative seating ready. The manager apologized but did not offer us anything to make up for it. I am thoroughly disgusted and offended by our experience there. I will not likely return, which is a shame because there entrees and cheesecake are really amazing,  albeit not amazing enough to make up for their ridiculously awful staff."
Kat V.,"Chatsworth, CA",188,988,32,3.0,3/11/2014,"I dreaded the moment my dad said that he wanted to come here for dinner on a Friday night given my previous horrid experience at the Galleria location.  I called ahead for call ahead seating & told them that we would be there in about 45 minutes.  After getting there, we were told that we needed to wait an additional 30 minutes.  :(  Ok, really not bad given that we went on a one of the busiest nights for any restaurant.  We were given a pager & told that it only works within 30 feet of the doors.  We walked out thinking that we could walk around the mall.  Bad bad bad idea.  I, then, decided to wait at the restaurant while my parents walked around.  They called my name, & I didn't know it.  The pager didn't even buzz or light up at all.  I couldn't hear my name being called due to the loud noise inside the place.  There must must be a better way to do this!  On to the food,  the bread was not warm when we got it.  :(  The menu is done a lot better than my previous experiences.  There is a ""Skinnylicious"" menu for people who are calorie counting & denotes which dishes are prepared with butter or cream.  A plus in my book since I can't have both.  My pasta dish with chicken was okay.  The peach smoothie was just as I remembered (delish).  The waiter was quite helpful & answered my questions about the food.  Parking was absolutely horrid, which is typical for any Friday night at the mall."
Virginia G.,"Saint Charles, MO",0,4,,1.0,6/19/2015,"After a 20 minute wait, they seated my eight-year-old son and I at a corner table that opened to the whole bar when there were plenty of other options. I couldn't face him because of the design of the table. We sat facing a tipsy toddling customer. I asked to be reseated. I asked to speak to a manager. He said they were understaffed, but he didn't fix the problem. After waiting another ten minutes, my son asked to go to the food court. We left."
Simone N.,"Saint Louis, MO",144,231,176,3.0,6/12/2012,"I am not sure if people on here watch Hell's Kitchen but I am pretty sure Gordon Ramsey would take one good look at the menu and say  ""Bloody hell people is this a cookbook index!!!!!!!!!!????????????"" On another note, they do have really good Red Velvet Cheesecake. The food is not disappointing even though you are overwhelmed by the large variety of foods they serve. This place would not be my first pick for dinner or lunch. Maybe a dessert because of the cheesecakes. The portions are also extremely big. Two people can easily eat a one person meal here."
Shanti N.,"Chicago, IL",126,765,125,3.0,9/26/2011,"When we came here on Sunday for brunch/lunch it was not too crowded, but the pace appeared to be picking up around 12:45-1:00 pm. Luckily, we were seated by then and had placed our orders, so the waiting time was not too onerous. The crying kids were located on the other side of the restaurant which also made for an overall more pleasant dining experience.  For being at the Chesterfield Mall, this location is spacious. The decor took me some time to figure out--a mix of Egyptian, French, and Italian--very ornate. I took it for what it was, and proceeded to enjoy my dining experience. My aunt and mom started out with bloody marys. The menu was huge and had a lot of options. Next time, I will scope out my ordering strategy in advance and look at the menu online. The house soup was credible (cheddar and broccoli) but I wish the bread had been provided with my entree. If my aunt and mom's breakfast orders had not been accompanied by toast, I could easily see a fight breaking out over the breadbasket.  For dessert my mom and aunt went with the cheescake--oreo for my mom and key lime/mango for my aunt. I ordered a dessert that used up my whipped cream allotment for the year. The cake portion was moist and the mascarpone was a good touch. I probably will not frequent this location, if only because the portions are a bit gut busting, but if selective amnesia hits or I am craving a cheesecake fix before or after a show at the AMC theatre, I might be back."
Kayla W.,"Graniteville, SC",0,8,,4.0,6/19/2013,"I love the HUGE selection of menu items! Every time its something new and you don't feel like you're just trying something else, so you're not getting the same thing. Stay clear of the hamburgers, not too much flavor and they always over cook. I have no complaints about the other 1,000,000,000,000 dishes ;)~ Now the cheesecake, I wouldn't say its the best cheesecake I've ever had...but they live up to their name."
Randy H.,"Jefferson City, MO",2,88,7,3.0,12/23/2011,"I do like the food but I gave it 3 stars because this place over-sizes the portions that contributes to the fattening of America. Now, as I get off my pedestal, I have yet to find a cheesecake they make that I won't eat. Just cut everything in half or in thirds and treat yourself to several meals for the price of one."
Tuan L.,"O'Fallon, MO",43,146,184,4.0,8/31/2012,I love cheesecake factory! Just got some delicious deserts and drinks. Highly recommend the strawberry shortcake! Its HUGE. Pricey but delicious!
Jason T.,"O'Fallon, MO",13,45,25,4.0,7/14/2012,"I'm always up for the Cheesecake Factory! Now, I think there are WAY too many items on the menu, but the items are delicious!  I'm a huge fan of the flatbread pizza!  We usually get 2 flatbreads to share so we can partake in the real reason we go.... the cheesecake!!  There are so many different ways to have your cheesecake and eat it too, but I usually go for Vanilla Bean.  Absolutely delicious! We rarely have any wait staff issues, and they are fairly attentive."
Michael H.,"Ballwin, MO",2,10,1,4.0,11/26/2011,"We've been to this CcF location at least a dozen times... this is a review of our last visit for my daughter's 13th birthday... (for desserts only)... we'd never done a birthday related visit here before. Used their ""Call Ahead Seating"" option to get our name on the list as we headed from our dinner location (15mins away at 7:45pm)... nice option though we still had to wait another 15+ mins after arrival for seating... somehow, we always get stuck in the bar area at this location.... rarely get a booth/table anywhere else in the place... our server was Heather, she was awesome!... very friendly and helpful with the kids. Caution: the coffee drinks (latte, espresso, cappuccino, etc.) SUCK.... I ordered a 3-shot latte (normally they only have 2) that tasted like they took regular strong coffee and mixed it with milk/foam... very weak.. Heather brought out another ""shot"" for me but this didn't really improve it... my sister got a cappuccino that she rated similarly.  So, a Starbucks or Kaldi's they are not for this beverage!... don't know why it's so hard for a chain restaurant of this size with such elaborate decor, menu, etc. to handle something as simple as a coffee drink... Thankfully, the one thing they never suck at is the cheesecake!!.. at our table we ordered: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake, Low Carb Cheesecake w/Strawberries, Pumpkin Cheesecake and Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake... all were awesome!!... Birthday note: CcF doesn't do ""waitstaff singing"" or anything really special for birthdays... they will only ""decorate"" the plate of the dessert ordered by the b-day boy/girl... this consists of writing ""Happy Birthday"" in choco-syrup with some sprinkles.... and Heather lit a candle and stuck it in the cheesecake... So, come for the always great food (especially desserts), typically good-to-great waitstaff and the interesting decor... but don't come for the coffee beverages, really special birthday treatment or for any short waiting during the evening hours..."
