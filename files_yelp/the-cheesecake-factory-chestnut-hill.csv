Bob L.,"Boston, MA",69,80,587,4.0,8/8/2017,If you've ever been to a cheesecake factory then you'll know precisely what to expect. Service was pleasant though not anything special (they were prompt in refilling our drinks which I always appreciate). The menu is huge (normal for cheesecake factory) and is also littered with ads which doesn't really bother me.   Overall if you like cheesecake after your meal this is the place to go since they have me huge selection! Ironically the only real complain is there listing of the calories in each dish since the meals can be ridiculously high in them (ignorance is bliss!).  Ample parking here!
Sameer S.,"Cambridge, MA",22,15,23,4.0,12/9/2017,Pretty good place and good is awesome. It's inside the Chestnut Hill Mall next to Bloomingdales.
Natasha J.,"Brockton, MA",3,38,113,3.0,3/14/2017,"Hmmmm Strangely eerie feeling,waited for 45 minutes for a table had a reservation at another restaurant but my boyfriend really wanted to go here.  Our waiter was nice but a little awkward and overall the feeling was uncomfortable the food was good I ordered the beef skirt with mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had a specially made pizza with chicken and red peppers the food was delicious  overall drinks were fine I had the red lha the Chardonnay  a martini but you check it out look at the pictures and see what I mean it was just weird  I would go to Braintree over newton nanytime no ghosts see what  I have tried to edit this review to fix where I had the Chardonnay and he had the martini and I can't even go back and fix it now you tell me somebody doesn't want me to write this review . either way again the food was good the place was weird it's an old place in Obviously has a lot of history and something doesn't want to be told I don't know ‍"
Julia L.,"Boston, MA",70,5,23,5.0,11/14/2017,"Great place to grab lunch or dinner after shopping. Many options, plenty if tables, rarely a long wait. Love the skinny menu options.  Plenty of options for kids. They also have outdoor sitting which is nice in warmer weather. The only complain about todays lunch - don't bring kids meals while they are extremely hot. Its very difficult for a parent to try to make a small child wait while the plate is right in front of them.. its unpleasant experience for a child.. keep it on the kitchen for 5-10 min if kids plate is untouchable with bare hands."
Paul S.,"Newton, MA",923,257,247,1.0,12/4/2016,"Took my Son & Wife here for my sons Birthday. Not very happy with this place. Thought the portion to price ratio was off. Our portions were just average. I expected more from a higher end restaurant like this.  Our table wait wasn't bad. But our wait person was awful. Our drink order taken the wait person came back & accidentally split a drink on my Wife. I know accidents happen but the drink spilt all over her new coat. Not Happy! We didn't order any appetizers so we just ordered out meals. They came out in roughly 35 minutes. thought it was a bit long.  Our food tasted Great, but like I said our portions weren't that impressive. Could have gone to Panera Bread or the Olive Garden and could have had much larger portions for less money. But my son wanted to come here for his Birthday. Our wait staff person never came to check on us. When we were ready to leave we had to flag down a wait staff person to wrap up our left over food. The Person took our food. I ask for a slice of Cheesecake to go. The wait person said they would be right back. We waited roughly 20 more minutes. We flagged another person down they said I will be right back. The person came back only to tell us our Leftover food had been thrown away... Plus no Cheesecake either.. We paid in Disgust & Left $80 spent & it was a Bust.  Also we realized that after we left we were never given our Dinner salads that was supposed to have come with our meals & no bread was brought to our table. Needless to say I won't be going back to this place."
David K.,"Framingham, MA",58,125,83,4.0,1/28/2017,"It's hard to complain when the ambience is nice the service is good the food is excellent and the prices are reasonable. Went for lunch, seems to be a bit less hectic then. I would love a few more healthy options, but it's a cheesecake factory! I'm glad they are still in business, and I wish them well."
Kimberly A.,"Boston, MA",322,374,,5.0,3/27/2017,The service here is friendlier than any Cheesecake Factory location that I've ever been to. There was absolutely no wait to be seated unlike the Braintree location which is in a bigger and busier mall and there is usually at least a short wait there. I wasn't in the mood for much so I ordered the nachos. They came out perfect and I really enjoyed them. My server brought out a bread basket for me to munch on while I waited for my food to come out and the bread was very delicious and freshly baked. I'll definitely hit this place up again on my future trips to the shops at Chestnut Hill.
HelloStitchy W.,"Boston, MA",0,22,35,4.0,3/25/2017,"The drinks were good! We had passion fruit mojito and lemon drop. They were both on a sweet side. Avocado eggroll was okay. Oh and we didn't get bread so we were little disappointed. Entree were amazing though! We had Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. Chicken was well prepared and for steak diane, some parts were over cooked but over all it was delicious. The server was attentive but I felt like he was rushing us to finish."
Jon G.,"Branford, CT",6,54,,5.0,9/2/2017,THIS IS JUST REALLY HARD FOR ME TO EVEN SOMETIMES PUT INTO WORDS HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PLACE! The staff are extremely friendly and it's definitely worth checking out sometime especially if you live within walking distance of this place in one of the Chestnut Hill Apartment Complexes! So I'm not a cheesecake person myself but the Linda's Fudge Cake MY WORD IS SO DELICIOUS! You have to try this whether or not it's the first time you've been to this place! Honestly at least the times that I've been here it's never been too crowded!
Angela S.,"Boston, MA",119,117,173,3.0,11/5/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always one of my favorite spots to go because their menu is endless and their food is pretty consistent, however my experience this time wasn't as great.  Came here on a Sunday night with a group of 7 people. The hostess said there will be a 45 minute wait, but we only waited for 15-20 minutes (so that was a plus)! We got seated in a booth, couldn't fit 7 people so the hostess had to put an additional chair in the middle.  The reason I gave three stars is because I felt really rushed. Once the food came, I think halfway, she already offered us boxes. I can't even remember if she ever offered us to see the desert menu. I thought that was unprofessional and rude! I can't even enjoy a night out without being rushed! Shame!  The food here is good, like I said, pretty consistent. Some of my faves that I think are worth trying are:  Shrimp scampi  Louisiana chicken pasta  Cobb salad  Renee's special  Burger"
Judith T.,"Boston, MA",1,40,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Called not once, not twice but three times to place an order for pickup. I was supposedly transferred to the cashier each time but each time after waiting for 5 minutes there was no response. I don't mind waiting and it wouldn't have been a big deal if they'd at least acknowledged that I was waiting. Needless to say we ordered from another restaurant. Not sure if we will be ordering from here again."
Eli s.,"Brookline, MA",0,87,,2.0,5/2/2017,"Food was as expected. It tasted, you know, pretty good. Flavors were definitely there. Portion sizes were shockingly large. For example, my mother got a main dish that she shared with three other people at the table. We then brought it home and had a dinner for two the following night. That means two things.  1) what quality meat are they using if the can afford to make close to 6 portions out of one $13 dish? 2) cheesecake factory is unhealthy Cheesecake slices range from ~1000-1600 calories per slice. That is also unhealthy. Now, if you add an appetizer and a drink to your meal.. forget super size me.. you wouldn't last a whole month. Cheesecake factory. Get your act together. Make your portions healthier (smaller). The skinny menu is a good start but your core menu has to be healthier."
Darya D.,"Waltham, MA",53,88,336,2.0,6/10/2017,"Overpriced food of really bad quality. Dishes named ""skinny luscious"" are fried and served with mayo! Lol You have to wait to get a table and then wait for not very tasty food. Not worth it. I tried salmon spinach rolls - they were old and over cooked. Salmon tasted like canned. Bad experience."
Yev B.,"Waltham, MA",18,44,4,1.0,8/19/2017,"Ordered a medium burger. Had to send it back twice for being over- and then under-cooked. CF is a great franchise for casual dining, but people at this restaurant need cooking classes."
Lizzie S.,"Boston, MA",0,17,5,1.0,8/2/2016,"I ordered a salad for lunch, one that I like to order at other Cheesecake Factory locations, expecting it to be really good. Instead, I was served a pile of lettuce with a few tiny shriveled up pieces of asparagus that looked like they had gone bad and I could not taste any dressing. I at least wanted to ask for more dressing or other edible/fresher toppings, but our waitress was nowhere to be seen - she didn't serve us our food and didn't ask if everything was ok. It was not busy in the restaurant whatsoever, so I can't explain why our table was neglected.  My fiancé had ordered the lunch pizza and it tasted like a bad frozen pizza. We were both disappointed to say the least and wished we had eaten somewhere else. Our waitress eventually appeared with the bill (over $30), but she put it on our table so quickly and left. We didn't even have a chance to tell her about our experience.  ***If I had seen the yelp posts (a few posts down) about someone finding glass in their food and seeing mice running all over the floors, I definitely would not have eaten here in the first place.***"
Chiraag B.,"Boston, MA",74,60,68,4.0,8/30/2016,"Stopped by at this cheesecake on the spur kind of moment - plenty of parking outside the mall so always convenient. We didn't have a wait and service was also pretty quick. We ordered 3 apps for two of us - spinach and cheese dip, chicken pot stickers and Tex Mex Egg rolls. As always HUGE portions so we couldn't finish everyone. The chicken pot stickers were wonderful - nice tangy taste to them. The other two apps were ok - nothing to write home about - we were in and out within 30-45 minutes. Definitely one of my better cheese cake experiences!"
Dee T.,"Watertown, MA",4,67,21,3.0,6/6/2016,"Out of the other locations in Mass. that I've been to, it is better service and semi-less wait time.   Unfortunately, they do not do reservations or call ahead seating.  So when you walk in there with a party of 6 or more, expect an eye roll and sass from the people at the host stand"
Gabrielle M.,"Boston, MA",77,1,,5.0,3/31/2017,"I usually go to the cheesecake location in Braintree but we came to the chestnut hill location tonight. I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night. We only had a 15 minute wait for the 2 of us. We were seated promptly and brought drinks and bread. The food was amazing, we ordered the fettuccini alfredo with chicken and the mac n cheese burger. For dessert we ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which was fabulous. Our waiter, John was incredibly friendly and gave us great service. Excellent food, excellent services, and reasonable price. We will definitely be returning!!"
Alessia Z.,"Waltham, MA",170,18,,5.0,3/16/2017,Original cheese cake is unbelievable. Mac and Cheese balls are super good and filling:)
Steve K.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",56,525,1726,4.0,4/12/2016,"Here visiting the area, and sought out reliable TCF. Ordered a burger platter, Falafel Salad, and chicken tacos. All tasty. House gin martini was well-made. Attentive service too. Décor seemed unusually dark. One surprising no-no:  the bill had the usual three suggested tip amounts up to 20%...but the tip calculation was based on meal + taxes. Come on. Deliberate ""mistake"" or management is mathematically challenged? Either way, disappointed that The Cheesecake Factory management would allow this to happen."
H. Erik N.,"Boston, MA",0,7,1,2.0,7/13/2017,"Filthy table, indifferent service, and average food. Coupled with a pretty steep price tag, one can do better elsewhere."
Vivian C.,"Boston, MA",126,1439,14550,5.0,8/11/2014,"This five star rating is for the newest addition to their cheesecake line up - the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. For the longest time, to me, dessert at the Cheesecake Factory meant their luscious and light banana cream cheesecake.  But now, finally, there's a serious contender for my precious tummy real estate and dessert calorie count - the smooth and sweet lemon meringue cheesecake... yum! There are worse things to be troubled with than which terrific slice of cheesecake to order! *** 10/2014 visit *** Come here for their terrific honey wheat bread, which is particularly good when served warm, and some delicious cheese cake.  If you need something else, consider the Hibachi Steak $19.95 ~ Certified Angus Hanger Steak with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus.  Sure the meat portion was rather light on my plate, but what meat there was was cooked medium rare as requested, tender, and so tasty with the sweet marinade. The chicken was tender and tasty in the Chicken Madeira $17.95 ~ Our most popular chicken dish! Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes.   Although it seemed the smallest plate at the table, which was also graced by the pretty layered Luau Salad ~ Grilled Chicken Breast Layered with Mixed Greens, Cucumbers, Green Onions, Red and Yellow Peppers, Green Beans, Carrots, Mango and Crisp Wontons with Macadamia Nuts and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Vinaigrette.  The Famous Factory Meatloaf, Served with Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Grilled Onions and Corn Succotash was pretty good, though higher accolades went to the variation at Rox Cafe. Entrees rate a 4 here. Annoyingly, they don't seat you till the whole party is there. *** 10/2015 *** The warm crab and artichoke dip app $11.95 was pretty good.  The eggplant parmesan rounds surprisingly arrived alternated with breaded and fried mushroom caps.  The Hibachi Steak $19.95 was still quite good and well worth ordering. For lunch a number of their menu items are available at a luncheon portion for a price that topped out at $14.50 for the salmon vs $18.95/$19.95 .  But consider your appetite.  The DC who ordered the dinner portion of the Luau Salad was the sole member of our party to finish their meal (not inclusive of the one who ordered the mac & cheese burger $13.50). For birthdays, if the birthday boy/girl selects a dessert, they'll decorate the plate.  If no dessert is selected, they'll bring out a scoop of ice cream with whipped cream and embarrass him/her with the staff singing a birthday song. *** 10/2016 *** HUGE Apple Crisp dessert!  Generous for 2."
Martha G.,"Boston, MA",101,16,8,5.0,6/2/2016,"Out of all the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to in Massachusetts and California, the best service came from Donna G at this location. Best dining experience! She was so attentive and nice. She even gave us strawberry lemonade refills to go, had no idea this was an option.  The food was delicious as always. The California chicken club sandwich and Louisiana chicken pasta are always great options. Personally, I don't like cheesecake so if you like cake, Linda's Chocolate Fudge cake is a must, it's perfectly  moist.  If you ever come across Donna G as your waitress, you're in good hands!"
Bea T.,"West Roxbury, MA",114,218,680,2.0,3/23/2016,"The food  is good and standard CF style but the service was terrible. It was my birthday  and although it was a busy night, Ive had better experiences in other CF. My carrot cake was dry and our server said she was too busy to take our photo she was running around like a mad person. She didn't  have anyone try to help and follow  up with us...pathetic. I'm  a 25 to 30 percent  tipper for good service especially on my  birthday ...oh well....."
Tina B.,"Needham Heights, MA",0,6,2,3.0,6/21/2017,"The night started off fine with a drink at the bar while waiting for an outside table. Also if our waitress  wasn't such a delight this would be one star review. We ordered a salad , and two ribeye steaks , our food did take a little longer than usual to arrive but we were enjoying our conversation so we didn't mind too much. A ""manager"" came over to apologize that they have run out of ribeye steak -seems odd to say that now it's been 45 mins and the kitchen is just making our food now? Hard to believe. No worries my friend wasn't upset she ordered the filet , rare. The manager or whoever she was comes back to tells us she wants to bring the other steak out and salad so food doesn't overcook, okay fine. Our waitress comes by and sees we're missing a ribeye and wasn't told of the kitchen mistake. Very disappointing that the lines of communication at this place are in total disarray. The real reason no ribeye, it went to the wrong table. How frustrating. And what's with the lie? Put on another ribeye. Maybe they did run out. Oh! During said chaos we gave our compliments to the male manager on duty about our waitress, she tells us he told her we said she was weird! Totally wasn't what we said! I think there's issues with staff and management at this place. Not sure we will be back."
Elle S.,"Stoneham, MA",0,16,,4.0,12/18/2016,"First time at the Chestnut Hill location. Haven't been in years as the wait for a table is usually somewhere close to an hour at the Burlington location.  The wait here was 10 minutes and service was excellent. No mix ups. And the food was great! The Hazelnut cheesecake was ""to die for""!! Highly recommend this location!!"
Emily R.,"Natick, MA",5,6,,1.0,8/30/2016,"Disgusting ... We asked for the tables in the terrace , the one open in the mall courtyard and noticed immediately the floor under our table was very dirty , we changed table and the floor was dirty as well and there was a little mouse trap. Maybe if you clean the floor mice are less likely to come."
Jessica B.,"Allston, MA",0,6,,2.0,8/15/2016,"I honestly don't understand why so many people like this place.  This is my second time here, and it's still the same.  The food is salty, looks old, and is usually overcooked (they keep the lights dim for a reason!). My ""sauce"" had a layer of film over it, so you know it's been left out somewhere.  The only thing that made this experience half decent was my waiter.  I believe his name was Alex (?), but he was extremely caring and attentive, and seemed to actually be concerned about us getting decent food.  I'm not coming back here, ever, but at least my waiter was decent this time around.  First time it seemed like the girl could care less."
Norm C.,"Newton Centre, MA",0,15,2,1.0,5/21/2017,"Typical cheesecake ""factory"" menu.  Ordered the usual items but was terribly disappointed by the portion.  Service was also very factory like, but nothing genuine.  We ordered appetizers but no inquiry as to if we wanted everything all at once or slowly.  My entire dinner service consisted of 1 entree per guest & 1 drink per guest.  I was so thirsty that I might have considered drinking the toilet water.  As we were leaving; I think I saw ""please don't come back"" in my rear view mirror."
Tracey F.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",0,12,,3.0,9/5/2016,"Pretty reliable food. Service friendly. Too much garlic in most dishes. Decor needs refreshing. Very outdated and kitsch. Needs to join 21st century. Would be great if open for breakfast as no other options in the area. Also, an alternative of vegetable noodles instead of pasta for a low carb option would be fantastic. The burger protein style is really good. ."
Kimberly S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,4,2.0,5/25/2017,Ordered sliders...the buns were greasy and seems to have been microwaved!!!  Upset my stomach.  Spinach dip is good (even though microwaved too!) but the tortilla chips were kinda stale???  Not going back.
Maria R.,"Hyde Park, MA",9,9,,4.0,5/21/2017,If had the orange chicken with white rice . It is my favorite place .we go often to this place
Laurel C.,"Hartford, CT",0,4,,1.0,9/3/2017,"We've been here many times and had minimal problems with this place. But this time, when we came for Sunday brunch, we were completely taken aback by the rude and indecent service. The receptionist at the front (who we found out was named Emma) led us to a seat at the bar area, and not just the bar area. It was the darkest, most concealed part. Not to mention we had two kids and we found it very inappropriate that out of all the seats available at this time of day she led us to such an indecent seat. When we voiced our complaint to her and told her we wanted to sit at the terrace, she led us to, again, the very edge of the area and the darkest place possible. At that point we were fed up, and made a specific request to sit at a table at the center of the terrace, and the look she gave us was extremely rude. We asked to speak to a manager, and her explanation of what happened was completely ridiculous. She made an excuse of ""Here in Massachusetts it's alright for anyone to b seated at the bar."" We've been living here for over seven years and my father is an attorney and knew what's he said was complete bs. Then she tried to explain why we were placed at the very edge of the terrace. ""Every area is sectioned off to each server, so we wanted another server to be able to serve our costumers."" That one was also pretty ridiculous. Of all the times we've been here, nothing like this bad ever happened. We even considered leaving the restaurant altogether since we were so done with this place. But we decided to stay, and the plight continues. We asked for bread to start with, and it never came. Probably never coming back here."
Joe C.,"Norwood, MA",0,28,,5.0,5/12/2017,"I have eaten many times at the Cheesecake Factory in different parts of the country. Today was my first time at this location. It did not disappoint.  Despite one party member arriving after the others who finished their food before the the other arrived, our friendly waitress Kaitlin told us to take our time even though the lunch crowd was large.  As always, the menu was extensive and all dishes contained fresh ingredients.  Quality, consistency and great service."
Brendan O.,"Arlington, MA",1,82,,5.0,12/7/2015,The appetizers are the best of any chain restaurant. Perfect meals for the desserts that come after. I will order the chicken pot stickers or fried calamari 10 times. Don't skip trying anything here because you think other restaurants serve the same. Every chicken dish egg rolls Mexican style dishes. If you want 5 star wait staff and bartenders you'll get it here with great food Great locations are Chestnut Hill Back Bay Burlington Providence Awesome
Doug S.,"Idaho Falls, ID",0,77,122,3.0,9/24/2016,Nothing spectacular. Reasonable prices (except beer) and large selection. Had fish and chips and it was good. Made out of cod. Don't like chain restaurants as a rule but was outvoted by rest of my party.
Sam S.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,1.0,12/3/2016,"So disappointed at the service at Cheesecake Factory. They gave away my dad's meal and then offered more bread or salad while we had to wait another 10 minutes for his meal. All the mean while, our meals were sitting under the heat lamp. Even though it's been sitting under the heat lamp, my meal had congealed over!! So pissed off with them right now!!!"
Lyndsey C.,"Sterling, VA",231,982,173,3.0,1/2/2015,"As i have written before, i am not a chain person... and I am sick of concierge at various hotels recommending the damn cheesecake factory in places we travel to, but my mother in law loves it so it is always easy to take her here when we are at malls, etc.   This is a nice enough cheesecake factory, like all the rest, but i did love the outside (in the mall, not actually outside) seating area.  Also, we have a server named Donna who was literally the nicest person i have ever met and she was so pleasant and knowledgeable and attentive that it made our lunch very nice. We would go back if at this mall and needed a bite.  THe food is always the same, lots of choices, freshly made, and huge portions... not something i seek out, but a good choice, especially at this mall."
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566,5.0,4/24/2015,"APRIL 2015: SO MUCH Better than: A. Old annoying Atrium location B. Providence Place meanies! Check out Providence Place Cheesecake for definition of BAD EXPERIENCE.  (Plus: If you're at the Mall @ Chestnut Hill and want to eat at a restaurant..... (sorry to disappoint, yet) THIS IS YOUR ONLY OPTION! AUGUST 2015: This isn't your only option.... anymore. Pepe's Pizza is coming soon, Tokyo Japanese Steakhouse is open, and Morano Gelato has arrived. Yet, this is still in my opinion the BEST of the restaurant at ""The Shops @ Chestnut Hill"" (By the way, YES, the name was changed from the Mall @ Chestnut Hill to The Shops @ Chestnut Hill..... interesting). Food is great as usual. Waiter was kind, also, as usual. Just a great restaurant. Braintree & Providence RI Cheesecake Factories should learn from here!"
Tao G.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",0,1,1,1.0,5/13/2016,"A piece of glass find in my meatball pasta! How could a piece of glass mixed in pasta? Of Course  it cut my mouth a little. It's my first bite and I didn't pay that pasta but I still paid the rest of my bill. They gave me a piece of cheese cake as compensation. Actually, I didn't want any compensation and a slice of cake worth nothing. I just very upset how could a piece of glass mixed in my food? What if I swallowed it. My throat? Stomach? Couldn't imagine."
