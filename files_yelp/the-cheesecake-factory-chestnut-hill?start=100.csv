Alana J.,"West Roxbury, MA",0,2,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Overall I had a HORRIBLE experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory from beginning to end. I will never return. When we arrived we were told that there was going to be a 15-20 minute wait, and we ended up waiting for 40 minutes. When we were finally seated it then took about 10 minutes for our waitress to even come and take our drink order. When she took our drink order it took about another 15 minutes for her to then bring them to us. By the time she returned we were ready to order both our appetizers and entrées. Our food took about 30 minutes to come out, and when it did it was lukewarm, and very dry. Our waitress barely came over to our table to check in with us, and when she did she would forget things that we had asked her for. After the horrible meal we ordered dessert, since that's what The Cheesecake Factory is mostly known for. After ordering it then took another 20 minutes to receive our already made desserts. This may have been some of the worst service and food I have had at any Cheesecake Factory. We walked in at 2:10 and didn't finish eating until 4:45 due to the horrible service. I wish I had decided to go to Besito next door. I had a wonderful experience there the last time I went, and the food was amazing. AVOID THIS LOCATION OF THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!"
Miel L.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",0,24,,1.0,7/27/2014,"We came here for dinner, and I would not visit this place again. We ordered tomato and basil pizza, chicken enchiladas, and a classic hamburger. The pizza and the enchilada were all too salty for us, and and the hamburger was just ok. Nothing special about the dishes, and we couldn't finish them all, and we just left the leftovers."
Garrett S.,"Boston, MA",0,8,,5.0,6/22/2012,"5 stars for the amazing customer service by Tanya! My friend and his brother arrived at 5 for an early dinner.  When we arrived we were quickly seated.  I started with a Mojito without the simple syrup.  It was actually quite good and muddled to perfection.  Yum! Next was my meal, I ordered the Chicken Piccata, i decided to go without the pasta and opted for a side of asparagus instead.  It was flavorful and a great size in the lunch portion, leaving room for a delicious Limoncello Cream Torte. This was recommended to me by Tanya and it was amazing.  It wasn't to heavy or too sweet and the citrus flavor was perfect. What really made this experience stand out was Tanya she was very attentive and was very friendly. 5 Stars."
Bessie M.,"Boston, MA",9,71,7,4.0,12/5/2011,My boyfriend and I went here on Saturday night for dinner. The place seemed slow for a Saturday night and especially because I expected a lot of people to be out shopping for Christmas.  Anyway we got there and were seated within 5 mins at a table that was kind of close to another table.  It was quite uncomfortable so our hostess suggested a booth which was much better. Our waitress was nice except a little pushy....she would tell us to take our time but she was always coming to the table what seemed like all the time. Our food was okay I got pasta mariana was not what I expected and it was a little dry and my boyfriend got the Lousiana pasta which was excellent. For dessert we got a chocolate rasberry cheesecake and we got a red velvet cheesecake (my favorite and it was AMAZING...I think I might order that as my birthday cake next year) All and all it was a good experience!
Becca M.,"Boston, MA",13,22,4,2.0,5/4/2014,"Last minute get together with my brother and tonight I just did not feel the ""welcome"" from beginning to end. Got here at 9PM and the host gave us an option to sit where ever so we ended up sitting at a high top table and was served by Shane. He seemed pretty rushy and observing what tables he had I could understand he had a big party full of guys and a couple high tops (including us) and a few booth tables. He took our drink orders- I had the peach smoothie and my brother had the tropical smoothie. DELICIOUS! He brought out bread, but it was missing the sour dough white bread and I didnt really like the wheat brown ones and was pretty disappointed and noticed the next table that came in had both. Another server had brought our drinks over since it was sitting at the bar counter for about 5 minutes. Our server then ran over while our drinks were being placed down and the way he asked what we were going to order I felt rushed. He didn't ask us if we had questions or needed a few more minutes, more like ""What have you guys decided on for food?"" Uhhh ok.  My brother already ate so he just ordered loaded potato tots and I ordered the chicken alfredo. When the food finally arrived, once again the same lady ran our food and I'm just confused as to why is she catering to us? Might as well have her serve us then? His big table was pretty much done and I see him attending to his other tables and to our right there's some staff that is either on break or just ended their shifts and I see him chit chatting. Dont get me wrong, I understand y'all had a long days work and barely had a break, but work is work and its rude to ""neglect"" your guests. What I am the most upset about was when he came over to check up on us and I asked our server if he could pack the rest to go, his response was ""Sure, but did you want me to bring a box for you to pack it yourself?"" Wow. Speechless. As a server myself that IS horrible hospitality. First of all, what did you really do throughout our whole entire visit? 2 second table visits for the max 5-6 times, did not run any of our food/drink, busy attending ""more important guests"" (pretty much 3+ more guests because their table equals more tip?), and chit chatting. Just because its only 2 people with almost $40 worth of food, you don't think we are worth your time? That's how we felt the entire time here tonight. Tipped him 15%, but I felt he didn't even deserve that percentage due to poor service and it annoys me how servers automatically assume whatever the check total will be they think they will get a minimum of 20% gratuity off it. Shane was nice, but his service needs some improvements and not just asking to take our orders and checking up here and there. I shouldn't have to pack the rest of my food when I go out to enjoy my day off from doing that to my own guests! I don't work there- you do."
Jeff O.,"Peachtree City, GA",34,15,12,5.0,10/9/2011,"This place is awesome.  Great Atmosphere, food and people. LOVE LOVE IT.  Had breakfast burrito this morning and it was delicious."
T D.,"Groton, MA",0,18,,5.0,1/31/2014,"Stopped for dinner Tuesday early evening .  Greeted and seated right away .  Our waitress Danielle F was great.  Very attentive , took out orders right away , drinks came out fast with some freshly baked bread . I had the california cheesesteak. Excellent , had to take half home as portion was very generous . My wife had the Chicken and avacado club . She said it was delicious , only tough thing about it is that it was so big , she had to eat it with a knife and fork . We shared a piece of the blueberry truffle cheesecake , very good as was the coffee . We will be back !!!!"
Amanda K.,"Natick, MA",0,9,4,4.0,1/14/2014,Beautiful restaurant! Had their salmon it was delicious.  Our server was great: attentive but did not hover.  I like taking my time so I was happy with the service. Wished I had saved some space for their dulce de leche cheesecake!
Janina T.,"Boston, MA",21,108,1,3.0,4/19/2011,"I've generally had decent experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory. This past Sunday was a tad bit unpleasant. Our waiter seemed friendly enough to start with. After we got our drinks and bread, however, it took SO. FREAKING. LONG for him to come back and take our food orders. I would say it took him a good 10-15 minutes to come back. On top of that, it took maybe 20 minutes to bring my food out which consisted of two appetizers; one was edamame. I didn't know that they planted the pods out back and waited for them to grow, because at the rate they were going, they might as well have. On the whole, I always enjoy going to Cheesecake Factory--their chicken caesar salad hits the spot every time. This time however, every time our waiter would leave, he would take years to come back, even to process our check which, in my opinion, is usually the fastest process since they're ready and willing to take your money and have you out the door.  I give them a 3 out of 5 stars since the service this time was pretty terrible but usually, I never have issues with the service or the food."
C M.,"Newton, MA",9,64,,1.0,1/27/2013,"In the most simplistic terms. Cheesecake Factory's food is bad. Bad for your health, bad for your wallet, and it doesn't taste good. Cheesecake Factory's food tastes like garbage, it sucks."
Jo Y.,"Brighton, MA",0,2,,1.0,6/11/2014,"Plan to celebrate my kid's birthday and know that it is Father's Day, so I call ahead to reserve a table. I was told no, they don't do reservation. I asked if no reservation because of Father's Day. They said no, they don't do it. What kind of business or service is it! So only ONE star to the service. No knowledge about food."
Jen B.,"Tewksbury, MA",72,44,3,3.0,1/11/2011,"Pros - huge menu, large portions, excellent service Cons - Typically long wait time I have been to The Factory both in the Burlington location and this location. I have to say I prefer this locations service and ambiance. I had the Carbonara pasta the lunch portion which was plenty and my friend had the mini pizza and the beet salad. Everything was delicious and filling. We had a slight mishap with a salt shaker that was not filled properly and the top came off spilling salt onto my friends pizza. This was quickly rectified by the wait staff by bringing her another pizza. Also I have to say that the Manager also came over to make sure everything was ok. All in all a great experience. If anything could be improved upon it is the way they do the seating. If you have a buzzer and it goes off this should automatically mean that you are going to be seated right away. This should NOT mean that you will be put in another line to wait to be seated. This has happened to me on numerous occasions at the Burlington Location."
Kevin F.,"Belmont, MA",6,3,,2.0,4/26/2014,"Food was fine. I got a chicken quesadilla.  Great. I ate two of four pieces and left a bunch of salsa, sourcream and more than half my guacamole on the plate. I then made what turned out to be a big mistake by letting waiter box the meal. I figured it was pretty obvious that when I get something boxed to go, I'd like everything I paid for in that box.  If its on the plate, it goes in the box. Low and behold I get home and I have two triangles of quesadilla, yet nothing to dress it with. I don't keep guac in my fridge sorry. Nor do I have fresh pico de gallo laying around. Usually have sour cream, but naturally, I don't now. When somebody asks you to box their meal, put everything in that freakin box. That seems obvious to me but maybe my expectations are out of whack, I don't know. I do know that I'm home and hungry and disappointed at how miserably plain my quesadilla is about to taste. Rant over."
Jerry L.,"Newton, MA",7,12,,4.0,7/12/2014,"Great restaurant. Portions are huge, so while it may be a little pricey, you definitely can take your food to go and eat it the next day. They don't take reservations, so you may need to wait a while on weekend nights. appetizers are great too, and the bread they bring it is phenomenal. I've ordered drinks from their bar too which were made very well (strong). Service is usually pretty fast and always very professional."
jeff s.,"Brookline, MA",3,67,,1.0,11/26/2012,"i used to think the CCF was a quality spot,   good service, great food ...... no more.  After the last three times, I will not be going back.  Each time, the servers are slow and seem completely overwhelmed, even though I go at slower times.  Once seated, the slowdown begins,   10 minutes or more to see a server.  then you order,   slow slow,slow  Last time, the food came out about 30 mins later, and some of the orders about 15 minutes after that, and some, were never even put in to the kitchen,   The food is ok, once it comes, nothing great. so the service really makes it not worth the visit. Oh well,   no more CCF"
Kasey K.,"Boston, MA",15,36,7,5.0,7/18/2014,"Best chicken picatta EVER. Nice, clean, relaxing atmosphere... Server was super nice. Will be going back ASAP!"
Annette A.,"Brighton, MA",391,376,269,3.0,1/13/2008,"It seems that all the complaints here tend to relate to the wait or their personal tastes.  Yes, the wait is long, but what can you expect with high demand? It's not like they drag their feet. At least they're accurate. Thirty minutes means thirty minutes. And for personal tastes, well, they really don't make a food bad. (For example, these are the same people who would rate a Blonde Hair Dye as terrible because it turned their black hair into an orange. Haha, I've been reviewing too much lately...) I've enjoyed many of their entrees. The meatloaf is a bit funky, but then again who makes better meatloaf than a mother? The cheesecake is great, and I am not the biggest fan of cheesecake. My personal favorite is the Pineapple Upside-Down cake, it tastes more like party cake than a cheesecake. The drinks are AMAZING, and damn fast. The bar is a fun area to be, and most of the bartenders are pretty cute. ;) I think the environment is great. Relaxing when you don't want the chaos of a TGIF bar. The Egyptian decor is charming. Perhaps it's a bit faux-high-class, but I think most people can figure it out."
E W.,"Newton Centre, MA",6,1,,1.0,10/12/2014,"We had the worst restaurant experience last night. I am still mad after ""sleeping-on-it"".  We took my daughters and a friend to dinner last night.  We got to the restaurant at 6:30, sat at our table at 7:30.  We ordered two burgers, a pasta, a salad, and a steak dish.  While we were waiting for our food, the waiter dropped off 5 pairs of chopsticks for us, which got us all confused since we don't see any of our food will require chopsticks.  That to us, was racism (as we are an Asian American family) disguised as service. I am really mad that my kids had to encounter this. After complaining to the manager, he immediately took the blame and offered us a small gift card to apologize.  He said some other table in our area asked for chopsticks, but we can't find anyone around us who would have used chopsticks for their meals. When the waiter came back, he took the chopsticks away without saying anything. We got our food at 8:30 and my medium steak was so burnt and dry that I can't help but think it was revenge. When the waiter came back and asked how everything is, before I could get a word out, he said 'That's great"" and left.  So, should I go back to this restaurant again?  If I don't, the waiter probably had gotten his wish and he doesn't have to serve 'us' again."
Rachael M.,"Dallas, TX",238,447,109,3.0,12/30/2009,"*sigh* Did I really come to Boston to eat at a chain restaurant?  Apparently so.  In my defense, I was eating with some locals who love the place, so that has to count for something, right?  That's what I'll tell myself anyway... This Cheesecake Factory is pretty standard in most aspects: there is usually a bit of a wait, you get decent service, fairly comfy booth seating, and a wide variety of dishes from which to choose.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table on a Saturday evening (around 6ish), so it could have been much worse.  Upon being seated, I noticed how large this restaurant is - definitely bigger than any other CF I've visited before.  Our waitress was sweet and helpful, though a little slow on the refills.  I'm sure she was swamped with many other tables, so it wasn't a big deal.   For dinner, the people of my group ordered all kinds of meals, all of which were massive in size.  I tried out the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which always looked yummy, but I never had an occasion to order them.  I definitely was not going to starve with this plate - even the lettuce was oversized!  But it was oh so tasty.  The chicken was cooked nicely and had a good flavor to it, though a tiny bit tough.  I loved the variety of dipping sauces, especially the peanut sauce which I'm a sucker for usually.  I enjoyed the fresh veggies even if the bean sprouts did keep getting stuck in my teeth.  Attractive, I know ;)   After all of that, I was stuffed full, but who goes to CF without at least looking at the dessert menu?  Kudos to the waitress for pushing the menus on us... She clearly knows how to make a sale.  I decided to take home a slice of the Pineapple Upsidedown Cheesecake for a late dessert, which totally hit the spot.  It has to be one of my favorites that I've tried thusfar *nom* Overall, this CF wasn't too shabby for a quick meal.  It was in a good (re: convenient) location & our time there went smoothly.  I certainly wouldn't be opposed to visiting this location again sometime."
Kam A.,"Tustin, CA",29,121,13,3.0,7/11/2010,"Like any other Cheesecake Factory you'll find. Long menu, lots of cheesecake. The layout is strange, it looks like the restaurant would be really small, but there are other booths around random corners, don't get lost! Outdoor seating is available."
