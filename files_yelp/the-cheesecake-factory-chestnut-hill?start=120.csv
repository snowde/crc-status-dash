Robin G.,"Newton Center, MA",0,44,,3.0,5/25/2014,"I happen to be a big fan of the cheesecake factory.  I love the food, the menu, the ambiance.  I decided since it was a holiday week to take my kids out with my friends at 8 PM....Well, it took them an hour to seat us...Just as they did, our waitstaff switched....The food was just ok...I ordered the avocado  rolls..I love them!  However, my friend ordered the salmon with asparagus, which was very thick....not very appealing."
Joe S.,"Marlborough, MA",0,165,,5.0,6/9/2015,food is always great at any location but service can be hit or miss... this place is a hit
Sameer N.,"New York, NY",60,127,2,2.0,1/7/2009,"This place should be called Cheeseball Factory.  The food isn't spectacular but it's edible.  You'd go here on a business meeting or you could get a couple of wacky cocktails.  Other than that though, I'd stick to the cheesecake which is pretty giant in proportion. I'm a total snob and a jerk so when I see people in here living their weird domestic lives and getting psyched on eating at a chain restaurant I feel sad inside and then make sarcastic remarks to try to hide how awkward it makes me feel."
Peter W.,"Boston, MA",35,304,156,4.0,10/28/2009,"I am a big eater so I like the large portions, especially the comfort foods such as salisbury chopped steak, meat loaf, or shepards pie. I also like that the martini's are large and come nice and cold.  And to top it off, cheesecake is my favorite dessert. Today I finally notice their small plate section and tried out the stuffed olives, garlic rolls, stuffed dates, and pizzette of wild mushrooms.  All of them were great!  We had plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow."
Rachel A.,"Seattle, WA",251,362,13,2.0,4/30/2009,"Sometimes, when your cousins are doing the driving (and the paying), you let them do the choosing, too. CF was not my choice, but it was not the worst thing ever. Three apps were a light dinner for four of us, and the cousins and the grandmother were all pretty pleased. Their artichoke was the worst artichoke I've ever had, probably because they actually have to cook it from a fresh vegetable and not from a frozen bag. Also, there was an ant on our table. Poor ant, having to eat leftover crumbs of bad artichoke. But, props for being open late on a weeknight in the suburbs! Good for you, CF. Now get me a delicious artichoke and not one that sucks."
Galina R.,"Brookline, MA",53,33,4,5.0,8/25/2008,A really great place to dine if you into generous portions and consistent good quality.  This particular Cheesecake Factory lets you sit outside in the summer and you can shop in the Atrium Mall in case the wait is long and while you are waiting to get seated. Can't go wrong with these items from the menu: Appetizers: THAI LETTUCE WRAPS AVOCADO EGGROLLS Salads: SANTA FE SALAD BARBEQUE RANCH CHICKEN SALAD  Cheesecake: FRESH STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE
Lilah L.,"Brookline, MA",0,16,,4.0,7/20/2008,"I think the food here is great!  I got an artichoke appetizer  here the other day and it was like $9 for 3 whole artichokes!  (aren't artichokes considered a delicacy or something?) Although my main dish wasn't all that tasty (i ordered a veggie pasta that didn't really have much sauce), I blame it partly on myself since Im absolutely terrible at ordering and never read the fine print (now that's me just making excuses up for why I never read the dish's descriptions close enough).  So yes, I ordered a pasta with no meat...and yes it could've been  better and i doubt any vegetarian would've enjoyed it more...BUT yes there is a but the cheesecake freakin ROCKS.  and by rocks i mean ROCKS.  it rocks so much I'm savoring every bite and have been picking away at it for 3 days nows.  Even though it's probably rotting right now, it's goodness just perfectly masks the mold...yyyummmm"
Allison R.,"Somerville, MA",239,689,173,2.0,7/13/2008,":( This used to be my favorite Cheesecake Factory, but it has slipped in the rankings to below *gasp!* the Cambridgeside location. I still love the location in the Atrium Mall, where you can window shop Anthropologie and Restoration Hardware with your buzzer thing. Buuuttt, the food has been less than consistent, so I must remain steadfast at 2 stars. I was served hard, crusty bread at a recent late-afternoon lunch, and my grilled shrimp and bacon club tasted like a three- day old leftover sandwich.  I headed there for a dinner as well and the hostess was too busy talking to a waiter to greet us for a solid minute. Sigh.  Cheesecake Chestnut Hill, why do you make it so hard for me to love you?"
Melissa A.,"Watertown, MA",13,21,,3.0,5/20/2008,"I really, really, reeeeealllly wanted to give this one four stars, but there's just one problem that always gets to me every time I go: their menus are so...sticky.  For real, like, I found bits of macaroni around page 25 one time.  But the menu itself is pretty extensive, and I've never hated anything I've eaten there, and the wait staff is fine...hence the three.   Oh, not that this matters to everyone, but their bathrooms are pretty.  Though, I always feel a little weird that they have full doors, so I can't look down and see anyone's feet.  Nothing says getting to know someone but knocking on their bathroom stall.  Hey, there. If you go at an odd hour -- and this has been my own experience, say 4pm or 8pm -- you should have no problem being seated right away.  It does suck that they don't take reservations, but they seem to do just fine with the clientele.  And there's the double-edged sword effect: I suppose that, if they did take reservations, my lazy self wouldn't get in at all during peak times.   Some appetizers that I really enjoy are the fried macaroni and cheese, taquitos and sweet corn tamale cakes.  The Big-Bang chicken & shrimp is a delicious dinner option with a spicy kick to it.  And of course, you can't go wrong with any of the cheesecake options (key lime pie and the chocolate tuxedo creme varieties get my top votes).   Oh, and they've got a valet service if you care to use it.  I typically just make like I'm parking at the mall and enter the restaurant from the inside."
A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",845,1249,8,3.0,12/20/2009,"Love the Cheesecake Factory - huge portions, reliably good food and it has sentimental value for me & the bf.  That said, the waiters at this one are a little weird sometimes.   One time we had a waitress who literally yelled at my boyfriend for taking a (really important) phone call in the middle of the meal and told him to stop being rude and pay attention to me.   Nice sentiment, but sometimes it is necessary to take a call and your girlfriend understands....  After the phone call was finished, she asked him what it was about.   Um....what?  Who does that?  What if someone had died?   We just laughed it off obviously, but how awkward would that have been if we had been on a first date or meeting for business? Another time I had put my coat on the bench beside me, because they don't have coat racks, and the hostess (kinda rudely) asked me to move it and then looked at me like I was absolutely PSYCHO when I asked her if they had a coat rack I could put it on.    (Answer: they don't, which is sort of weird in and of itself). Also one time a crazy French lady kept trying to come into my stall in the bathroom even though I was telling her over and over again that someone was in there, and then when I came out she said she was sorry and that she doesn't speak very good English.   But presumably she could still hear the VOICE shouting from within the STALL, no??   Do people share bathroom stalls in France?  Anyway that's not the restaurants fault, but it seems I keep having weird experiences at this CF location.   So yeah....good food, good atmosphere, free, convenient parking at the Atrium, but some of the staff and customers are a little weird."
Robyn L.,"Belmont, MA",112,256,18,3.0,4/18/2006,"I have love/hate feelings for the Factory.   Yes, they have some reliably yummy dishes (Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, burrito, cheese steak, etc.) and I could eat baskets upon baskets of their bread... especially when they bring it out of the kitchen freshly baked and still warm... so good.  But there are just TOO many options in the novel-sized menu! I can't handle it all in the five minutes that passes from the time they drop the menu to the time they ask if I'm ready to order -- only to come back two minutes later and ask again.   If they actually left their patrons alone for the amount of time it would take even a Factory-skilled-menu reader to digest that ENTIRE selection, they would never be able to turn over tables! Then again, that may explain why they usually can't.  You need to go in with a battle plan: Do you want a sandwich? Pasta? Chicken? Mexican? Thai? Italian? Apps? Drinks? Dessert? If you don't have it at least narrowed down to a fries-and-burgers night vs. a chicken-marsala night, you'll be under the gun.  Another plus: The Factory Peach Bellini... it's not a strong drink, but tasty.  Another negative: The fact that they require your entire party to be present to be seated. They're just screwing themselves and everyone else waiting for tables by doing that."
Sarah C.,"Keene, NH",8,86,7,4.0,1/7/2009,"A lot of people hate on The Cheesecake Factory, but I love this place! The location at The Atrium Mall is usually busy, but I have never had to wait more than ten minutes to get seated.  Also, the free parking in the Atrium garage is great. I have never had a bad meal at Cheesecake, everything I have ever ordered there I have really enjoyed...the chicken piccata, thai lettuce wraps, buffalo wings, and spicy chicken chipolte pasta are my favorites."
Andrew B.,"Portland, OR",7,176,19,4.0,12/18/2006,So good. Too bad the mall it's in kinda sucks (for guys at least). I've been  here twice now and been impressed both times. It is kinda pricey tho but it's worth it I'd say. And the cheesecake... they have like 25 different kinds and they're so good and filling. I want to try to find the one in Providence next time I'm down there. At least that mall has an Apple store I can kill time in.  Cheesecake factory gets a 4.5 / 5.
Micaela L.,"New York, NY",46,530,2,3.0,5/7/2006,"Ideally, I would give the Cheesecake Factory 2.5 stars.  I think it's pretty overrated -- there's rarely a time when you won't have to wait an absurd amount of time for a table.  The menu is too extensive, the portions are too big, and the food is decent, but overpriced.  The good thing about the extensive menu is that it really does include something for everyone.   Positives: the servers are generally diligent and helpful, and the desserts are delicious.  The Cheesecake Factory is known for its vast variety of cheesecakes, but the other dessert options are just as good -- the fudge cake is my personal favorite."
Shari J.,"Canton, MA",16,241,7,4.0,9/21/2008,"5 minute wait at 7:30pm-ish on a Friday night, yeaaa! Nom-goodies--warm wheat bread, mmmm Really nice red wines Good food and lots of leftovers ...couldn't be much better service at Cheesecake  not so hot: spinach dip--waaay too salty, aaah!"
Mary C.,"Boston, MA",6,50,,1.0,5/23/2012,"The food at all the Cheesecake factories taste the same, so I will not rate the food. What I am rating here is the terrible and horrible service. From start to finish everything is slow. My sister called in to make reservations for 13, Saturday night at 7:00PM. The manager there Stacy, made an exception for us so we had ""reservations"". I checked in at the front desk and told them i had reservations....for 7:00PM. I was told it'll be a 30-45 minute wait. But wait...don't we have reservations why would we have to wait? Apparently no one at the front desk knew Stacy had made this exception. And finally when Stacy did realize we were there and checked in....we've been waiting for a good 20 minutes already. 7:20...7:30...7:45..8:00....we did not get seated until an hour after our FAKE RESERVATIONS! This is unacceptable. A table of about our size gets there at 7:45 and they get seated before we do. Terrible! Either take reservations or don't! Because my family would've happily went elsewhere and made REAL RESERVATIONS so we didn't have to wait an hour to eat. I've had bad experiences at this specific location before and normally they offer complimentary slices of cheesecake to make up for it, but we didn't get didly. It was my grandmother's birthday atleast send out a special slice for her! nope nada. Don't come here unless you have time to chill at the cheesecake factory. Plan to spend an hour waiting to sit to down and then another 30 minutes for your food, and then another 30 minutes just trying to flag your waitress down for the bill."
T L.,"Boston, MA",4,39,2,2.0,10/27/2006,"For some odd reason, i end up eating here alot, maybe cause its one step up from your regular chain restaurants like crapplebees and chilis; i dont love the place but they have a large diverse menu and decent tasting food; plus its good for large groups, cause everyone is picky but can find what they want here; wait is usually long pretty much eaten a majority on the menu, my more popular choices are meatloaf sandwitch, apple porkchops, pizza's arent bad, they have a good orange chicken ; asian dishes there are decent remarks from my more recent trip Not one of favorite restaurants but respectable and on the same level as a macroni grill or other chains...this experience was bad.... waited like 1.5 hrs to get a table and .5 to get the food...ridicoulous wait but for some reason we didnt feel like going anywhere else... ambiance was alright , bathroom get an alright rating...the water handles where small but urinals were clean and smelt nice bread was warm and we had 2 servings of it...i had a crabcake sandwitch with mashed potatoes...large portions but nothing great...average taste and mashed potatoes were not hot hot...waitress has a ghetto booty  overall 5 out of 10"
Rachel C.,"Newton, MA",2,51,86,3.0,8/24/2010,This cheesecake factory was just okay! I think the food is not as good as other locations!
Albert D.,"New Haven, CT",120,157,,3.0,5/8/2008,"Just like any other, if you've been to any other cheesecake factory. I went at 930pm, so it wasn't crowded or anything, but I'm sure there will be lines to get in line to get a table. The food is okay. It's definitely one of those places where if you have a bunch of friends who are picky about what they eat, this place has something for everyone.  But you know what they say about jack-of-all-trades not being an expert at anything..."
Keith C.,"Cambridge, MA",19,25,2,4.0,1/6/2008,"I was intending to review their location at the South Shore Mall in Braintree, but since it wasn't listed there and was too lazy to create a new listing, I decided to post it here (where I've also eaten).  Here goes. For someone who tends to be skeptical about food quality at a restaurant chain, this place has impressed me with a consistently good meal at three different locations.  This last time (Braintree), I was told it would be about a 35-minute wait, which was accurate to the minute as I waited at the mall's bookstore. They have a very extensive menu, as evidenced by the fact that the server came by three times before I finally decided upon the California Cheesesteak.  Despite the restaurant being packed, the food came promptly (right after we finished eating the bread).  The meal looked so good that the people around us asked what it was, and although they didn't order it themselves the taste definitely lived up to the expectation: Fresh, not greasy, and just the right combination of steak, cheese, onions and peppers. This tends to be the status quo from the other times I've visited (I think the cheesecake speaks for itself), so I'd definitely recommend going here, just try to pick a time where everyone else doesn't have the same idea."
