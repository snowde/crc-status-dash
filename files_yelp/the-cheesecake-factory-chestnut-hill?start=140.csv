Paul B.,"BOSTON CLG, MA",0,9,,1.0,7/9/2014,"if you are gluten free, or suffer from celiac, stay away from cheescake factory.  had fries last week and pasta this week with terrible results.  either they got the order wrong (they claim this is not the case) or there is contamination in the kitchen. either way, if you want to have digestive issues go here, if you want to enjoy your dinner go to one of the other places nearby."
Stephen L.,"Quincy, MA",58,19,,1.0,9/3/2012,"Came here this past Sunday for Brunch this past Sunday (09-02-12). I have to say, service was pretty bad. We were seated promptly and things just went down hill from there. We placed our orders for drinks and food. Our food didn't come out in time, which we didn't mind at first, until we realized that the party that came 15 minutes after got served their drinks, bread, and food before us. Our server seemed careless, forgetful, or she just didn't care much. We politely reminded her about the bread on 4 separate occasions, but it didn't come out until after our entrees were served. Meal was okay, not great or memorable, I've had better at different locations. I wasn't irritated until I politely made a suggestion to the manager that his servers need to memorize things a little better. His reply was a simple ""okay"" and just walked away. No wonder why the rest of his staff seemed careless, because the manager didn't care. Perhaps the reason is because they know the location is closing down, but it doesn't excuse the service we received, I expected better service from an established restaurant such as this. Disappointed and won't be returning."
mandi m.,"Boston, MA",3,46,,4.0,6/22/2007,"I am usually not a fan of chain restaurants however the food, desserts, and drinks are just so tasty.  You could go there a hundred times and not try everything on the enormous menu that matches the enormous portions.  Avocado eggrolls are a must try along with of course the cakes.   Now the negatives: I haven't figured out the secret as to why this place is ALWAYS crowded and you ALWAYS have to wait no matter what time/day you go in EVERY Cheesecake I've ever been to in several states now.  Wait for literally hours or take your chance hovering over people seated in the bar area, staring, willing them to finish up so you can pounce on their table before someone else.   The huge portions.  I did say that was good but when you reheat them the next day you see the pool of butter/oil leaching from the dish.  Better tasted and not seen - bad reminder of your indulgence.  This usually keeps me away just long enough for the craving to overpower the memory. Overall a good get together place - something for everyone."
Phil W.,"Somerville, MA",10,44,,3.0,8/29/2007,"I think it's cruel that the Cheesecake Factory serves so much cheesecake and yet requires their servers to wear white jeans.  Black is slimming, white jeans... not so much. Oh yeah and the food's fine and all that."
Joseph L.,"Suffolk, MA",1,7,,1.0,9/3/2010,"It's not easy to give such a low rating to a seemingly fancy restaurant like Cheesecake Factory - but I am telling you that this particular one I went to is not quite the great place to eat as people may have imagined. I went there with a group of friends, and their food is ... ""okay-ish"", definitely disproportionate with its price level and sophistication of its decorations. Maybe they have great cheesecake, but other food items are not to be praised"
Bernadette S.,"Chicago, IL",11,151,22,4.0,3/30/2008,"I went to this restaurant last night as part of a mystery shop, so my review in summary: The atmosphere is bustling, energetic, fun, as are all Cheesecake Factories.  They keep the place clean and well maintained, though one restroom stall didn't work and there was a missing purse hook. We ordered the thai lettuce wraps and the goat cheese and veggie pizza. The lettuce wraps came with three dipping sauces, vermicelli, bean sprouts, shredded carrots, sliced cucumber and delicious grilled chicken.  This is a messy appetizer but a total home run in terms of flavor. The veggie pizza was missing its olives, and didn't have enough goat cheese, but was delicious, despite this.  It was buttery and the veggies had great flavor.  I love the crust and it was cooked perfectly.  A nice dish. We sat at the bar and the service was solid, nothing spectacular, but we were taken care of, and enjoyed this visit."
Maggie S.,"Waban, MA",1,82,,5.0,1/8/2013,We are regulars at the bar. I really like the salads here. Nice and easy atmosphere. The Bartenders are so Awesome here.
Gabby D.,"New York, NY",222,303,131,4.0,4/18/2007,"Holy goodness this place was great!! I even used it as an example for my fractions lesson to my second graders today. Can't stop talking about it! So right, we took the shuttle bus on over from MIT.  Seemed like the nerdy-cool thing to do.  Scooted in and we were seated right away.  Place is huge! Caught a glimpse of all the cheese cakes on my way to our table.  So many choices! So many choices! Sat down, too Boston-food-overload to actually order a beverage other than water.  Our waitress was very nice and patient.  While stuyding the pages upon pages menu I happened to catch a glance of what appeared to be a soccer game on over at the bar (shiny-thing syndrome...easily distracted).  But, like the true soccer obsessed testosterone shooting through a girl's veins person that I am, I quickly excused myself for a closer look.  Manchester United...ROMA! Holla! Mmm Cristiano Ronaldo.  Oh right, Cheesecake Factory...back to the table.  So we ended up splitting everything.  The Cajun pasta dish which was IMMENSE!! SO LARGE! But quite delicious. As well as one of those tropical salads (also ridiculously large) which came with fried wonton like things on top...mango...was an art form like dish thing.  Wait wait waaaaaait. Wait a minute! Let me back up.  Um. Appetizers! We went with the avocado spring rolls and the fried macaroni and cheese.  W.O.W. I can't...I can't even begin to tell you.  THE best fried macaroni and cheese I've ever had (and I know mac n' cheese).  Oh my, oh my.  The avocado spring rolls were also a surprising delight.  Quite delicious.   Alrighty, so now the big finish.  Cheese cake.  Which. One. To. Choose?  I narrowed it down to the carrot cake cheesecake...the oreo...the regular....the kahlua...and I believe a few others.  But after the sensory overload of our meal...and the week, I went with ""the regular."" Which was faaaar from ordinary.  Oh yes! It's gooooood! Which reminds me....I still have a few bites left in my refrigerator.....hmmmm!"
Brandon V.,"Waltham, MA",59,140,1,4.0,12/10/2007,"I tried their curbside pickup service last night for the first time.  The food was ready within 25 minutes of ordering on the phone.  The guy who brought out the food, Brandon, was very friendly and helped us figure it out for the first time.   The only question I would pose is: How much, if any, do you tip them for coming out to give you your food? The food itself was great as usual.  Nothing too fancy, but good for the price.  The skirt steak arrived warm and tender, and the mashed potatoes were very flavorful.   Usually I worry that something like curbside take-out, especially for steak and the like, would end up tough and cold by the time it gets to the house, but that was not the case last night.  Everyone else in my dinner party had similar opinions."
Lauren R.,"Princeton, NJ",0,19,,4.0,9/18/2012,"Love the Cheesecake Factory.  I've gotten all sorts of different dishes here, every sort of cuisine, and it's all been good.  Their cheesecase, ironically, is my least favorite part about the place, because I'm not a fan of the cheesecake consistency.  But I still really enjoy the restaurant."
Adam B.,"Brookline, MA",21,81,,1.0,8/27/2008,"I dunno what it is with me, maybe I'm as big of an asshole as I claim to be, I hope not.  However, when I order orange chicken I don't expect to bite into a piece of metal.  I don't know what it was exactly other then a piece of metal maybe a rivet?  When I told the manager he said he could comp my dish and give me a new one.  I was like are you kidding me man I don't think I'm going to risk it.  In the end we had to pay for our entire meal which is complete BS.  I should have sued!!!!! Another place I give -1000000 Stars. This place is so mediocre metal aside why do people go here, wake up!"
Travis D.,"Boston, MA",75,124,10,4.0,6/20/2009,"Chicken and biscuits to the FACE. This places chicken and biscuits are Grrrrrrrrrrreat. If you've never had them then swing by and get them here. I mean pretty much anything you get at a cheese cake factory is going to be awesome but thats just a dinner you cant get at to many places and they are doing it right. I almost always leave with leftovers too because the portions are for a small army. Besides the food the wait staff is great too always had a friendly knowledgeable person willing to throw in some insight and make the meal better. The desserts.... obviously amazing. There is a chocolate cake there that a slice of it is about the size of a small child, chocolate overload. It also doesn't hurt that because of its location within the mall there is always a great array of hotties in or around the restaurant and the waitress staff isn't to shabby either. Go find out for yourself."
John R.,"Amherst, MA",90,246,38,2.0,6/14/2009,"My wife and her sister have gone to this place a few times and of course, I ended up going at one point. The always raged at how big the salads and portions are but frankly bad food doesn't taste any better just because there's a lot of it. The only food item I've eaten there that was any good was a salad (I forget the name of it) that had roasted beets, walnuts and goat cheese in it. I should have stopped at that but it was the last item I've had there that was even semi impressive. And, once again the high corporate think tanks seem to feel that cramming folks into tables for two, side by side is efficient. Well, that might be the case but I really don't want to hear conversations with strangers that are sitting 2 feet from me. Side by side tables are a joke. There is nothing ""French"" or cute about it. If you are into chain restaurants (You should ask yourself WHY? if you are) than this might be up your alley, though a cramped alley it may be."
Ralph F.,"Newton, MA",0,27,,2.0,11/27/2011,"I haven't gotten take out from Cheesecake in while--tonight I remembered why.  I got the Baha Chicken Tacos.  They've obviously changed the recipe--the chicken pieces were rubbery and now covered in some kind of bitter brown sauce.  Instead of fresh salsa, sour cream and guacamole I got---absolutely nothing.  Even the tacos were thinner and fell apart easily in the oily sauce.  The tacos were accompanied by the saltiest beans and rice I've ever tasted.  Really--it tasted like someone upended a salt shaker into my side dish!  For the price, it's just not worth it!"
ChianWen T.,"Boston, MA",3,194,15,3.0,8/18/2008,"Eating a slice of tiramisu cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory is one of the most paradisial experiences one can have here on Earth.  It's right up with reaching out to touch Noam Chomsky's elbow in Hutchins Hall at the University of Michigan.  Yeah, that good. +5 stars for the tiramisu alone. They didn't stop with a good thing though, they had to drag it out.   Although you can always expect to get some, well get a lot, at the Factory.  It's almost guaranteed that the gettin' is not any good.  So you are left with the decision:  get a lot  you don't really enjoy at the Factory or get a little you really enjoy elsewhere, for the same money.   I am down with the school of Romantics, I want it  (my food) good and intense, and the duration is of no importance.    - 2 stars for wasting resources in abundance by making such crappy food."
Debbie M.,"Allston, MA",4,15,,1.0,5/1/2011,"So we went to the Cheesecake Factory again for a friend's birthday.There were 19 of us so we decided to split the check. The food was good but our waiter didn't know how to split up the check and we waited 45 minutes while he tried to do it, over and over again. Finally we settled up and our party was short $5. I told them that after waiting almost an hour to be rung up we were wondering if we could just call it even, and they FOUGHT us on it .  I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO GO THERE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE!"
Mary H.,"Boston, MA",7,7,,3.0,7/5/2011,"the good thing about cheesecake factory is their huuge menu, large portions and excellent service i think the only downside was a typically long wait because the restaurant is so busy! everytime i go there is a long wait for a table. I have been to the cheesecake factory in the cambridge galleria, natick collection , atrium mall and prudential mall. all locations lived up to the restaurants great reviews"
The Phantom G.,"Portsmouth, NH",14,28,,4.0,11/14/2006,"Good food. I cant believe I didnt even try the cheesecake!  Its OK though, the icing goes right to my thighs anyways."
Elizabeth K.,"Frisco, TX",4,37,,4.0,12/14/2008,"love the Cheesecake factory.  The one in Natick is probably my favorite due to the size (very spacious).   The Ahi tempura rolls are top notch.  As are the Avocado egg rolls.  Their cobb salad is one of the best out there and the lunch portion is large enough to feed two.  Their portions are just enormous.  Wasnt so crazy about their chicken club, the chicken was too thick but everything else I  have had here is great.  The decor is realy pretty I think, very Californian, I disagree with one of the previous people saying it was cheesy, its not very New England but not cheesy. It is a breath of fresh air compared to all the family style dining around MA. They have great drinks and of course desserts.  The tiramisu is great."
Steve N.,"Haverhill, MA",105,335,12,2.0,6/22/2007,"blah. too crowed, too disney, too much mediocre food. although the bartending at a couple of these things is pretty good."
