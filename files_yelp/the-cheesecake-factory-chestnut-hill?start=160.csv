Hope L.,"Brighton, MA",0,7,,1.0,3/1/2011,"My friend and I were super excited to go to Cheesecake for dinner, since we have had great experiences at the one by the Prudential in Boston. When we got there, we waited for 5 minutes at the host stand, before being given the ""1 minute"" finger. The restaurant was empty..but we were seated at an awkward 4 person table in the middle of the room. When my friend asked to switch to a booth, she was told everything was ""reserved"". Sidenote: All the booths were empty for the duration of our meal. Our waiter took 5 minutes to come over to us. And another 10 to take our order. Salads reeked of fish and were DROWNING in dressing. We ordered Sweet Potato Fries- Mcd's style with too much salt. Also, the ""fried mac and cheese appetizer""... I thought I was at Cheesecake Factory, not Sonic. We were thinking about dessert, since we were just SO disappointed with our meal and didn't want to leave on a bad note. But after waiting for him to bring the dessert menus for another 20 minutes, we decided we needed to get out of there. We got a cheesecake at the bakery counter- Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Oh, and no mention of the fact it was full of pecans. The music was WAY too loud, the crying baby ruined the appetizer, and our waiter was just creepy with a retainer.  Almost makes the 12 dollar parking at the Prudential location worth it."
Sarah J.,"Pasadena, MD",20,38,1,2.0,9/20/2010,"While the food at cheesecake factory is always delightful, this particular cheescake factory had something else....BAD SERVICE. If this is the one I think it is (in the prudential center) they have the worst hostesses (sp?) out of any place I've seen!  First of all, there's probably about 10  of them and none of them can do their job right apparently.  When they call out names of parties, they call them once and sometimes too low to hear! Such was the case when my family went, I thought I heard our name being called. I went up to ask if it was our name...they couldn't look to see what the last name was called, they just said we had to wait a few more minutes.  It literally took almost an hour wait when they told us 20 minutes.  This happened a few more times and even one of the many hostesses said we were the next up.  We weren't.  So we were about to march out of there when we were FINALLY called.  Service was better after that but WOW, those hostesses need to learn how to do their job."
Shiva M.,"CHESTNUT HILL, MA",1,15,,1.0,7/31/2012,"I grew up in Chestnut Hill and have been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times. Overall it's been ok from what I remember ten years ago. The last time I went there was a couple of years ago with my sis and it was quite a baffling experience. We were seated quickly and given menus. However, although we saw a waiter attend to all the customers immediately around us, he never once came to my table. My sis and I waited 45 minutes for service, watched the people around us being attended to, while we were blatantly ignored. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I will say that the only difference between us and all the patrons around us were that we were the only visible minorities. Anyway, I spoke briefly with the manager about what the rules of his establishment were in terms of who could be served and who could not be. He gave some insincere apology about what happened to us and offered to send gift certificates for us to return. It was pretty clear that he couldn't care less about our experience and in fact we never saw those gift certificates. My advice: If you're black, Latino, Indian, Asian, or any other minority, don't bother with this place. You'll get much better treatment just about anywhere else."
Shelly A.,"Boston, MA",21,74,14,4.0,3/11/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory has just started having Happy Hour from 4-7. The menu items range from $4 - $6 and include some great choices. I go for the avacado spring rolls and the chopped salad. With prices like this, you end up making up for it in drinks -- these places know what they're doing. ;^)"
Julie R.,"Boston, MA",483,626,111,4.0,1/8/2007,Always a long wait to get in but I love the Chicken Farfalle. Its so good!!
Ann D.,"Middlesex, MA",0,15,,4.0,7/4/2010,"How can you not like a restaurant that serves cheesecake?  The portions are huge and the service great!  Again, how can you not love cheesecake at the end of a meal?"
Pam O.,"Waltham, MA",0,19,,2.0,4/28/2009,"We went last night for dinner. The place was empty, and we were seated immediately. And we sat for a good 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. A waiter asked if we'd been helped, and when we said no, he said someone would be right with us. About 10 minutes later, we got a waitress. She kept talking to us like we were little kids (my mom's in her late 40's, and I'm 27-not exactly kids). We ordered, sipped on our drinks (mint green iced tea-yum!), and they were empty in no time. And they stayed empty. The waitress never came back to check on us. When they brought our food, she finally asked if we wanted more drinks. The 2nd was really watered down. The food was good, but not real flavorful. My chicken romano was huge (I had enough left over for lunch today), but my mom's shrimp scampi was smaller, and more expensive. We didnt order cheesecake (we really didnt want to raise the bill before calculating her tip), but we looked at the case on the way out. The waitress kept glaring at us. The cheesecake server was making coffee or something and kept ignoring us. We'd decided to get a piece to split later, but she never came over to help us. We left without cheesecake. It was sad."
Bella and Aleksey R.,"Framingham, MA",6,132,3,5.0,2/8/2008,"The food is great - lots of flavor, huge portions.  Prices are moderate, but well worth it for the quality of food you get.  Dishes are creative, a good variety of cuisines.  Decor is lovely.  Great places to get together with friends.  One down side at just about any location I've been to - long waits (30-45 minutes).  Get used to the buzzer, it is your friend when you go to this chain.   Btw, even though it's a chain, I would consider it to be on a step above the regular chain restaurant (I tend not to like those too much, although I will still eat there).  We are usually too full for the actual cheesecake, and I would say I'm not even a cheesecake fan.  It is good though, tons of varieties of course, and very sweet and filling.  Lots of people take half a slice to eat, and the other half to go, because it is so large."
P A.,"Cambridge, MA",0,7,,5.0,1/8/2008,"Tried a new desert called Factory mud pie -- fantastic chocolate cake, scoops of vanilla and coffee ice cream, whipped cream (theirs is the best - but I asked for just a little), a cherry, and a side serving of incredible chocolate sauce. Ridiculously delicious. I'm going back for it as my valentine's chocolate treat. I enjoy this location best of the many locations I've tried. Just fun and almost always a great experience.  Feels like a party."
Joe S.,"Wellesley, MA",0,60,2,2.0,12/16/2007,Tried brunch at Cheesecake Factory. Very disappointed. Waitress messed up the order. The restaurant was a mess. The brunch menu seemed like a real afterthought.
melissa c.,"Sudbury, MA",0,59,,3.0,1/18/2009,"huge menu, great selections of foods and portions. no matter what you're craving they have it.  good for all meals and the prices are very reasonable.  i love the bread they serve with the meals and haven't ordered anything that i havent liked. it's a regular place for us and we always leave full with doggie bags.  the wait can be tough so be sure to get there when your a little hungry but not starving. you might pass out from the wait but if you plan correctly it's totally worth it.  get some cheesecake to go! it's amazing."
