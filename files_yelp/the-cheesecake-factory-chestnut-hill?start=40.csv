Mia M.,"Newton, MA",42,13,7,5.0,2/3/2016,Crazy yummy food for everyone. Personal favorites: avocado egg rolls for an appetizer and pasta carbonara.  *drool*
Hillary M.,"Boston, MA",65,243,2,4.0,9/9/2015,"I'm happy to report that the wait wasn't long at all and the food and service were both as great as I've come to expect from the CCF. The waiter was cheerful and very accommodating and the layout was perfect to maximize table space but still let you have a private convo with your dinner guest. It was a little weird to be in the MALL during a dinner out, especially when Uniqlo's giant display TVs are still showing wonkus visuals the whole time you're eating. I suspect this is only an issue at certain tables. I have no idea why, but I've encountered some seriously disgusting stuff in CCF bathrooms. This place lost one star because when I reported the grossness in the bathroom to the hostess she said ""oh, you mean that thing in the handicap bathroom? We're working on it"" and DUDE, you should've gotten that taken care of ASAP. Blech."
Sam S.,"Waltham, MA",0,22,,5.0,1/5/2017,Another great location is Boston! I love going to this location and the one in Burlington. My experience of going to the Cheesecake Factory has always amazed with the excellent customer service and undoubtedly the best---tasty food in town!!!
April K.,"Newton, MA",170,339,122,4.0,6/28/2014,"Sure, it's a chain restaurant, but it's still really good. They have a million things on their menu so it's easy to accommodate everyone. Food is good and portions are huge. We got the spinach artichoke dip and it was incredible. Prices are really reasonable and the decor is nice.  The only thing that was lacking was the service. Although our waiter was super nice, he seemed to skip all the details. He brought us our drinks without straws, and he forgot the cream and sugar for my coffee. He also took a very long time to come around to acknowledge us. I don't mean to sound petty, but these are little things that we shouldn't have to ask for."
Ellen E.,"Holyoke, MA",36,32,23,3.0,1/3/2016,"This was my first time here. Our company was treating us so my co-worker and I decided to splurge and get steaks. I had steak Diane and she had hibachi steak, $19.99 each, both came with mashed potatoes. For dessert we ordered cheesecake, I had the chocolate tuxedo cream cheese cake and she had the chocolate chip cookie dough cream cheese cake. Our waitress was friendly and gave us complimentary bread and butter to start with."
Michelle C.,"Douglas, MA",91,138,41,4.0,3/31/2015,"Nothing wrong with CCF if you go during the week or any other off-peak dining times.. Nothing worth waiting any real length of time for. Consistent, way too big portions.. but if you can sneak in before dinner time you can get a lunch sized portion of most of their more popular dishes. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta I had today at $12.95 is a good deal. I still had half of it to take home. At $17.95 for the dinner size it's a rip off. You'll get a pound of penne vs the 1/2 pound you get before 5PM. And it will need salt regardless of the time you have it. Service is always decent, moody hosts and servers here & there but that happens everywhere. The clientele in this particular location can be a bit ridiculous so I do consider that...  Get your cheesecake to go or else you'll end up in a food coma."
Mike R.,"Westwood, MA",0,4,,3.0,5/7/2016,The wait was long but expected . The service was week at best Z she was over her head from the start . The real killer was my sons food came after everyone else was served and stated getting food . The manger came to the table and offer a free slice of cheesecake ? Will never return to this outlet .
Patti S.,"Watertown, MA",27,3,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Had the worst experience with a hosts ever. They were the most incompetent group. I have no idea what was going on but they kept telling us we were next to be seat and then proceed to seat 3 other group. They even to our pager, we had no idea where we were on the list. The female seemed  to have no idea what she was doing. She was completely useless...I can't stress this enough! One of the so called hostess was so arrogant and rude. While giving my husband and snarky remark about our wait the female hostess chuckled. I would like to know who gave these people there job! Last time we go there."
David T.,"Revere, MA",0,18,2,1.0,11/20/2015,"Nothing is worse than sitting in a restaurant and seeing multiple mice racing across the floor. Actually, what might be worse is the restaurant manager we spoke to telling us she knows about the mouse problem and they ""are working with the mall to find a solution to it."" Seriously? The manager, who was very apologetic and friendly, said that the mice were coming in through a mall door but assured us that the kitchen was mouse-free and and extremely clean. Even one of the waiters told us he wouldn't eat in the area where we were sitting at because of the mouse problem. The restaurant should be closed down until you fix this problem. Disgusting."
Cindy C.,"Quincy, MA",7,37,39,1.0,11/28/2015,"I can't give a complete review because I didn't even have the opportunity to eat here. I called at 6:30 for a reservation for a group of 18 and the hostess hung up on me the first time. My friend called a second time and she said ""I can't estimate that for you,"" and abruptly hung up. Customer service: F."
Cynthia N.,"Atlanta, GA",480,366,227,2.0,7/17/2013,"I should have known something was wrong when the restaurant was nearly empty.  I have NEVER gone to a Cheesecake Factory and not had at least a 10 minute wait for dinner.   Our initial server was okay.....in the beginning. He did not write down any of our orders (there were 3), so he came back a minute later and confirmed everything.  He brought us our drinks, water, bread, and was never heard from again. Other waiters brought us more water, more bread, our food, and a manager after we requested to speak with one.  All these waiters would not have been a problem if we hadn't had to ask for all these things.  Water is a basic.  And the restaurant was empty; he only had three tables. What gives? This is the first time I've had a negative service experience at a Cheesecake Factory.  That's always been one of their things; great service to the point of being corny and annoying.  Our server was replaced with another one who was just as bad and acted like we were going to stone him.   The food was fine and came out as ordered and it was a ton as usual per Cheesecake standards.  One of my coworkers ordered the chocolate cake, which I LOVED, and I had a bite and it's still delicious.  For this, CF gets two stars instead of one, but I wouldn't visit this restaurant again."
Lianne S.,"Somerville, MA",7,7,,4.0,7/22/2015,"Absolutely loved the food. Although the menu is so big and the restaurant really crowded, the food tasted fresh and was quickly served. We shared the avocado eggrolls, really good! Then I had the Chicken Madeira, which was also great. Think I order the same next time. My boyfriend enjoyed his turkey burger. As dessert we ofcourse ordered some cheesecake (cookie dough and 30th anniversary) and took it with us. Min: we had to wait for our turn and the waitress didn't ask us if we wanted another drink or some water. I also like if  they clean the table after the main course when it's dirty. I also don't like the interior, it's really dark in there and all the different elements make it messy"
John M.,"Reading, MA",1,16,1,2.0,12/1/2015,"Overall the service was good but the food was mediocre at best.   The Spicy chicken cashew was overcooked, the coffee tasted like it was a week old and the whipped cream clearly had something in it to make it look better, but NOT taste better..."
Ayushmati D.,"Somerville, MA",55,10,,5.0,2/13/2016,We loved eating. The chicken dim sums were so awesome. Also loved the strawberry cheesecake
Rayya K.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",0,11,2,3.0,2/23/2016,I usually love that place but last time i was there i ordered a coffee and when i took out a pack of sugar it was full of holes- as if a mouse had been around it. They claimed they had no mice and refused to open a new pack of sugar for me. Instead they simply didnt charge me for my coffee. I wanted to drink it but i wanted my sugar and they did not want to open a new sugar box so no coffee for me
Can D.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/19/2016,"I had the Skinnylicious Grilled Salmon. It tasted fine, but about an hour afterwards I experienced very bad diarrhea. It has been plaguing me all day. Not sure about their food safety standards because I feel terrible."
J B.,"Boston, MA",11,64,40,1.0,9/13/2014,"What can I say. This is a chain people. It varies location by location. Since we are in this area a lot I can say with certainty that though this new place is better than that old place at the chestnut hill atrium mall, the SERVICE IS AMONG THE WORST, for the area.  Consistently we go in here and we leave disappointed! Now with other options in the area we will reconsider this location."
East Coast C.,"Boston, MA",4,40,,2.0,11/19/2015,"This review is not about the quality of the food, but the service. This location is highly disorganized. When you order takeout, which I do frequently, they ALWAYS omit something from your order: napkins, silverware, bread, sauces that go with your order, tomatoes, the list is endless, It is so difficult to have to open and check EVERY order. My last visit there was vital missing food items in every order! Frustrating since we always tip on takeout. This happens at the bar as well."
Shirley Y.,"Boston, MA",31,51,114,3.0,9/29/2014,"I'm usually here a couple times a month. The menu is endless and you can pretty much try something different each time you come - that goes for appetizers, entrees, and cheesecake. They have other desserts too, but I don't see why you would come to the cheesecake factory for something other than cheesecake. The only major problem is their waiters need some extra training. They can be a little slower than expected sometimes, but I experienced one of the bigger mistakes last night - he forgot my onion rings that were part of my entree and when I asked about it, he didnt even apologize. That's probably the only thing that me from all the times I've been. Otherwise, its a comfortable and delicious meal for the most part."
Almas D.,"Brookline, MA",55,3,18,1.0,7/22/2015,"Horrible service, manager Alex was even ruder than waiter. The waiter (old women ) spilled water on the child, and the manager Alex was very arrogant and rude even offered nothing"
