Katherine D.,"Stoneham, MA",37,20,16,2.0,7/11/2015,"Okay, from the start I felt uncomfortable. I use a wheelchair now and then. And the host looked at me oddly. I thought maybe it was me so I let it go. Then the waiter came and asked if we wanted bread. We said yes, normally they bring the 3 peices of bread. Maybe this place was different then she brought 2 pieces of bread for 2 people so I was like oh I guess they give the amount of bread to match how many people. But then they sat a guy with kids on the opposite side and didn't ask if they wanted bread just placed it and brought 3 peices of bread. I felt so uncomfortable. The only reason that I gave them 2 stars was because the feruchini Alfredo with chicken was good but wouldn't come here again. Maybe they don't see many Hispanic people. Not okay."
Caleb W.,"Boston, MA",0,6,,2.0,11/14/2015,"Rock hard tomatos, terrible presentation, but expensive.  Weird decoration, poor lighting, and loud.   Our server was nice."
Jenn M.,"Auburndale, MA",0,77,2,5.0,10/22/2015,"So, I'm confused by the reviews and ratings for this Cheesecake Factory. We live in the area and are there quite often! The servers and staff have always been wonderful to us! I am often there with 3 kids which if anything would merit rude behavior, but none has ever been expressed! The food is always good ( sometime son busy nights it takes a bit) but overall I have never had any issues with this location! We love it here and have many reasons to return!"
Jas L.,"ALLSTON, MA",1,189,8,3.0,4/17/2015,"The server was hilarious! sarcastic, funny, chill, and gave us space. carbonara had an overly salty flavor that basically took over the entire dish. It was surprisingly bland other than this one note. The sliders were ok, but the meat was really just way too salty and fatty, and didnt seem high quality.  MY ONE complaint, is that he manager was pushy, rude, and tried to take over the waitresses responsibilities and make her look like she wasn't doing her job. It was so bad that i put in a complaint. I can't handle men thinking they can be totally rude and domineering over female staff, or any staff for that matter! it ruined the entire night to have that cloud of superiority on the dinner table.  SO, overall, eh, it is the CCF, but i like the one in Boston far more than i like this one."
Patrick P.,"Toronto, Canada",0,6,,2.0,4/12/2015,Waited 40 min for table. Ordered Nachos off the menu and they were on the bland side. We were anxiously awaiting the artichoke dip but ended up with a burnt artichoke and dipping sauce. Waitress was great but definitely not worth the wait and outing.
Lulis G.,"Newton Centre, MA",0,6,,1.0,2/20/2015,"I called the Cheesecake Factory - Chestnut Hill asking for the wait on a table of 10. The host was really rude and he said that there was going to be a 2 hours wait. I said it was fine and told him we were about to walk in. He was even ruder and said ""If you walk in now it will be a 3 hour wait"". 5 minutes after I spoke to him, someone from my party walked in. A hostess was really nice and told her the wait was 45 min. I asked for the host name and he said ""Mario"", but It was the host working around 8pm on Wednesday 02/18/2015. He was very unprofessional and rude. We almost gave up on going because of him. We felt like he didn't want us to come in. We did anyways because we were already in the area. I have been going this restaurant for years and never had this problem. I hope the manager addresses this issue. I will be writing another review for the waiter (TOD) because he was the best!"
Steve M.,"Hopedale, MA",1,20,,5.0,5/4/2016,Ask for Shane!  We just finished a delightful early Wednesday night dinner at this mall location thanks to a terrific server named SHANE.
Liz J.,"Rochester, NY",0,6,1,1.0,5/2/2016,Horrible. Decor and atmosphere was what you'd expect from the Cheesecake Factory but staff was subpar. Wouldn't recommend or return.
Antoinette N.,"Boston, MA",0,14,4,5.0,5/1/2016,"Ate here last night with my cousin. The food was good I guess (can't smell or taste right now, so I can only assume), but the service was FANTASTIC. Our waitress (I'm sorry, but I forgot her name) was attentive, jovial, energetic, and keep bringing us that delicious bread (yeah, you know the one). We gave her a huge tip, because she deserved it. I would be back just to sit at her table again."
Sandeep S.,"Raleigh, NC",12,31,32,4.0,12/7/2013,"Amazing restaurant, amazing menu, amazing food, amazing service! One of the best services I have ever experienced. Credit goes to Jordan, our server. He made the whole experience memorable. Will definitely be back. Long waiting time. But then it was a Friday evening, so expected."
Julia L.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",40,3,,5.0,5/15/2016,"This spot has surprisingly become a favorite of mine to visit even though it's so busy. My family had a rough day yesterday and decided to head over for dinner, we couldn't make a reservation on the weekend but it was no problem waiting awhile. The cheesecake area was so kind and the associates there offered us help during our wait. There is always so many things I can try off the menu and I love trying something new each time. I could tell the tables around us were enjoying themselves as well. The people who worked on 5-14-16, good work!"
Patricia D.,"West Roxbury, MA",1,14,,5.0,4/7/2016,"My family and I dined here on a Wednesday night for dinner. We were expecting a wait, but when we showed up around 5:45 there was no wait at all. We were promptly escorted to a table. The food was delicious. Out of the four of us, three had burgers. They stated that the burgers were delicious, the bacon bacon burger, macaroni and cheese burger and the Americano. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. It wasn't what I was expecting but delicious none the less. Nice sauce, not too overpowering with garlic. It could of used more vegetables but no complaints. The chicken was so tender it fell off the bone. No complaints at all. As we were leaving at 7:30, it was starting to become busy."
Deedee O.,"Newton Centre, MA",0,5,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Yikes. Not sure what to say-- used to be great at the Atrium. The one at the Mall at Chestnut Hill is pretty poor. The service is surprisingly bad, ruining the meal. We don't go here to eat anymore. When we crave cheesecake, we just order a slice and pick it up. But, we don't even do that on the phone anymore, because even the phone service is lame. What has happened to our beloved Cheesecake Factory?!!!"
Y T.,"Middlesex, MA",0,46,,2.0,7/5/2015,"Not their best. We ordered two dishes here for lunch today:  The fish and chips and the California Cheesesteak.  The fish and chips were just ok.  You would get better version at a random pub.  As for the California Cheesesteak, that was pretty bad.  The bread was way over toasted.  The steak was cut too thick and cooked far beyond well-done.  It was unpleasant to eat.   I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and have never had a bad meal until now.  They need to work on their execution."
David P.,"Worcester, MA",312,6,,2.0,2/9/2016,"The experience we had was a mixed to negative one. The food was good, good for a chain restaurant that is. Our experience in the ""good"" department was short-lived because our waiter, a tender slim flamboyant white male didn't have a clue as to what he was doing. Understanding that this ""factory"" was fairly busy, he did not once come over to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything, no exaggeration, NOT EVEN ONCE! He was inattentive and didn't provide any of what we needed. We watched as all other tables around us got bread and butter as we watched in admiration what those carbs would have tasted like...devastating. After waiting about 20 extra minutes to even ask for the bill, we waited another 15 for it to actually arrive. He asked, ""did we save room for the best part?"" If he was referring to the best part being us walking out the front door as quickly as possible? Then yes, I had an empty stomach for that. Embarrassing as his name was also David...he gave love a bad name."
Neil G.,"Boston, MA",64,273,318,3.0,1/1/2015,"Chain restraunt but this location was on the better side of nice.  The food are what we expected, but the portions were way too big.  Next time we order for one and split the dish.  The bar was showing the Pats game and there was lots of good seats to watch the game and recover from christmas shopping madness.  The waitress was really good."
Melissa K.,"Needham, MA",5,25,2,1.0,7/25/2014,Worst experience last weekend. We went in Saturday for lunch and there was no wait. Some how all of the orders were messed up. The manager came over 30 mins later to apology but that was it. At any other restaurant you would get something free or something
Kathy D.,"Randolph, MA",157,758,180,4.0,1/26/2011,"Went in here on a Sunday last weekend.  The restuarant was very busy.  There was a 15 minute way for two.  It was a very quick wait for a table. It's amazing how fast this place is.  they DO NOT fool around.  We were seated in within 5 minutes had drinks!   We had mushroom and buffalo chicken eggroll appetizers that were piping hot and delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Also, it literally came out in less than 10 minutes!  I have no idea who fast they can whip this out to the table! We ordered our entree's and they, too, were at our table within 10 minutes!  I had Chicken littles and they were delicious.  I would have given this a definite 5 star rating but the chicken batter on my chicken littles really needed some spices it was very bland..but, still very delicious!  I just added some salt and pepper...and it did the trick.   I have to hand it to the Cheesecake Factory...they were amazing and handled the crowd unbelievable!  Our waitress was also quick, efficient and very sweet!   I also heard the manager in the kitchen yell: ""Let's move the pace!"" to the cooks... HA HA!  So they are not fooling around here.."
Rick S.,"Newtonville, MA",1,77,,2.0,8/25/2014,I have to say that I do not see the fawning praise people give the food at The Cheesecake Factory.  My wife and I went here for brunch and found the food mediocre and the service below average.  Our orders were taken promptly and things went down hill rapidly from there. My eggs were moderately warm.  They probably would have been served hot if the server/bus person hadn't walked around the restaurant for 3 to 5 minutes trying to find our table.  Someone couldn't give them a table number??? The next big issue was that I received my toast both dry as dirt and burnt as did my wife.  I had to ask twice for butter which resulted in us getting 3 slices of butter.  I did not realize The Cheesecake Factory was so hard up that they couldn't butter toast and tried to prevent customers from doing so.  Our waitress reappeared at check time but was sorely missed when we needed her!  Overall this is a way too pricy for such mediocre food and poor service.  You can do much better!
Alyssa W.,"Brookline, MA",35,254,215,2.0,3/18/2013,"never been a hardcore cheesecake factory fan, not for dining in anyways. I usually opt for the cheesecake take-out.  I've never had a problem with the food or the service, it's just not my go to place. Salads are usually shared with someone and then we also split an entree. Portions are big, so save room for dessert.  My latest venture here, left me unimpressed. Our waitress wasnt that great. She couldnt describe the soup of the day off the top of her head and had to go into the kitchen to take a look at it...not usually a good sign.  I think this place is a love it or hate it kinda place. Also, this location, the whole mall is now vacant, leaving just Cheesecake factory...it's so lonely inside this mall."
