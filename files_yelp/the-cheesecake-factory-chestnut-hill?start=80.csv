Jae L.,"Needham Heights, MA",0,2,,1.0,2/5/2016,Poor service.  Not a single word of apology after messing up our sitting. Waited for 25 minutes with their beeper. I check and they tell me my name is not on their list although I have the beeper they gave me.
William G.,"Roswell, GA",73,56,,4.0,11/24/2012,"OK, so I'm in Boston with a group.  They start trying to decide on dinner, and various chains are being thrown about.  Finally, I step in.  ""Guys"", I say, ""shouldn't we at least try to sample some local flavor?""  Go me, right!  All agree, and we start eyeballing the famous and ancient Union Oyster House on our smart phones.  Hooray. So what happened?  Well, we arrived at the hotel, and there's a Cheesecake Factory right across the street.  Now my companions, being lower on the cultural food chain than esteemed yelpers such as ourselves, went gaga, and begged me to reconsider my chain complaint.  And, shamefacedly, I immediately did, when I realized my per diem for dinner would cover both the Jambalaya and a piece of cheesecake.  Don't worry, I flogged myself later for giving in. So now you know that this place is one of my guilty pleasures.  I mean, you can't offer me Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, or on this visit, Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, and expect me to resist.  This was my first time with the Turtle, and whoa was it freaking delicious.  I am sure it's one of the worst things for you to eat, but hey, without stuff like this what's the point of living? This particular location was nice.  It's on the lower level of the mall, and they were able to seat us immediately on a Wednesday night.  We had great service for our party of 8, and everyone was very happy with what they ordered.  Especially those of us who indulged in the cheesecake.  Down here in Georgia, these places are always madhouses, so it was nice to be able to walk into one and look at the cakes without being jostled by a bunch of people.  For the record, I may have just been insanely hungry, but the jambalaya pasta came out better here than I have ever had it before.  Simply wonderful!"
Ilya E.,"Somerville, MA",85,66,13,1.0,7/31/2012,"Let's see, we came here for Sunday brunch....my main complaint is that I was stupid enough to eat and drink here for 3 hours before ending up at Yard House at Legacy Place in dedham (a SUBSTANTIALLY superior dining/brunch experience). I ordered sliders for food, and was constantly pressured to order more food, even though their sliders are essentially 3 overcooked (despite asking for PINK center) mini burgers with no toppings and bun that came out of a plastic bag a few minutes ago. While I was waiting for Burger King delivery from their kitchen, I was treated to ambivalent service from our waitress who pressured us for more food, but kept forgetting our drinks. I also had 2 bloody mary's which tasted 'skunky' (not sure how you do that) but I suspect their tomato juice went bad and overall it was a terrible experience. The fact that it was sunny out and I was in good company saved the experience, but despite the fact that we were the only people there, Cheesecake Factory managed to screw up something so basic as Sunday Brunch in suburbia. The only redeeming quality about this place is that you can observe suburban russian jewish girls here, discussing #firstworldproblems and talking about their plans to marry a financial analyst that went to brandeis and their plans to go get drunk in Boston."
Lauren L.,"Fall River, MA",48,176,12,4.0,2/15/2013,"Well, I'd never been to Cheesecake Factory before, but my boyfriend thought this would be a great Valentine's Day dinner location. Yeah, him and about half of outlying Boston, apparently. We got there around 730 and were told it would be roughly a half-hour wait to be seated. Taking the initiative, and because I was excessively thirsty, we made our way to the bar and self-seated immediately at a four-seater high-top with a view of the Minnesota/Wisconsin game. It took a while for a server to find us, but that's more than excusable on a holiday. Our server, Rachel, was a gem. Funny, informative and very attentive, she was always in the periphery if we needed her. We started with a chocolate martini - not on the menu, but they'll make it for you - and a Long Island iced tea, plus waters and the quintesential bread basket.  Head's up to the bread baker, and I know they have one because I saw a guy walking around with a giant platter of breads, but that is the hardest, least palatable Italian loaf I have tasted that wasn't on the clearance rack at Stop and Shop. The multi-grain was fantastic, though, and we devoured it before our apps. Word to the wise, this is an amazing date location. We shared a Boston Cobb salad, which was well garnished and portioned appropriately to share. We then had the Hibachi steak, and OH GOD, can you say perfect medium rare? The best temperature for a skirt steak, which I know it was, but hey, cooked with that marinade the cut was great. The wasabi mash, tempura asparagus and roasted mushrooms were perfect. Delectable. Amazing and fantastic, and we have half of it in the fridge because there was just so much. We got two slices of cheesecake to go, thanks to Rachel's suggestions. Coffee and the end of the basketball game were compliments of the manager, whose name I never got. A very pleasant, smiling lady, and I appreciated her attentiveness. This business is in the Atrium Mall, and while the rest of the structure is vacant, I hope they stick around. First visit but not the last! Only would have been better if my boyfriend proposed, but we'll give these things time."
Manfred S.,"Medford, MA",85,630,150,2.0,3/22/2011,"The food, just like every Cheesecake Factory, is not bad. We had a collection of appetizers rather than main courses. Tuna avocado salad was tiny, but good and fresh. Salmon firecrackers were a little overcooked, but good. Mini carb cakes where very cheesy - yes cheesy - where is the crab meat? Calamari were okay, albeit unremarkable. Red velvet cheesecake was to die for. Their tab water is filtered and drinkable.  Knock though - club soda was unbearably loaded with chlorine. I sent it back and got a new one. I told waiter David that it is not fit for human consumption and asked for more regular water instead. I still was charged $3 for the soda. Rather than arguing, I deducted $3 from the tip which made it uncharacteristically low.  Don't drink anything out of their soda fountain!!! Don't give the sodas to your kids."
Jamie S.,"Hollywood, FL",105,75,102,2.0,2/15/2013,"Great food and drinks, if the waitress listens to what you order.  It seems like victoria( the waitress) had her mind in something else the whole night.  I ordered a Malibu and pineapple, and my friend asked for a chocolate martini.  Victoria came back and asked me what I ordered. I said Malibu and pineapple.  What we received was 2 martinis.  The Malibu you could barely taste... For 10.00- I was ripped off! Victoria needs to cheer up! I gave the lowest tip ever."
Haykush A.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,4.0,6/9/2016,"i love this place, really fresh drinks there, food was excellent as well, but service sometimes was really slow , that's why only 4 stars, anyway, I'll be back for sure!"""
Jessica B.,"Fullerton, CA",4,31,17,5.0,8/12/2014,"Went here on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend and it was surprisingly crowded. Wait wasn't longer than a minute though which was great. Waiter served us water and bread immediately, which was good because we were pretty hungry. Ordered a Caribbean cooler and it was a bit small for the price we paid but still delicious--just the right amount of alcohol. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese burger and loved it. Not too salty. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The coleslaw that came with it was delicious but the bbq sauce was a little too sweet. As usual, portion sizes are huge. You truly get what you pay for here. At the end, we finished off with a godiva chocolate cheesecake. It was perfect--chocolatey but not overpowering with sugar. I'd definitely come back here again."
Jason P.,"Boston, MA",43,16,,3.0,11/12/2012,Just a thought... If your customers must witness four separate performances of the waitstaff's attempt at singing happy birthday hire a goddamn vocal coach to train the crew. Even the mutants from the Star Wars bar could do better!
Vincent M.,"Framingham, MA",377,404,225,2.0,2/5/2010,"When I'm not waiting 45 minutes to sit here, I'm waiting just as long to be served mediocre frozen food. I don't know if it's the over priced entrees, the terrible service or the snooty attitude of the managers but CCF just doesn't do it for me.  The last time I was there I ordered a scotch and I had to send it back three times because either the cup was dirty or there were flies in it. Flies, in my scotch. I don't know, I can understand once but three? c'mon CCF I do like their Cheesecake so I suppose that's a win on their part but other than that, nothing really redeems it. Sorry guys."
A H.,"Hingham, MA",1,209,,2.0,10/19/2015,"We've eaten at many Cheesecake Factory Restaurants, and the food is always pretty good. Unfortunately this time, the food was good, but the service was horrible. Table of eight... server brought one bread basket... had to ask for another. Orders came out of the kitchen erratically... two, then three, then one, then two... over a period of several minutes. I had ordered a salad instead of the fries with my burger (nothing special, it's offered that way on the menu). I was half done with the burger, when the salad arrived. Also had to request and wait for condiments for the burger. Mustard and ketchup should automatically be brought with a hamburger. There were mistakes with one or two of the other orders, as well. I think I'll pass on this C. F. outlet in the future."
Alex S.,"Boston, MA",70,117,18,3.0,5/2/2010,"Five stars for the cheescake; one star for the pasta. The ""Pasta with Meat Sauce""  entree was slightly large as a portion and miffled with too much oil. The sauce was lacking in meat and had a consistency that separated itself from the pasta (i.e. when the pasta was gone, the plate was filled with it.) Overall, the meal didn't go down as well as I expected. I'll try something else next time. Apart from that, the cheesecake was amazing! I had the Godiva Chocolate, which was a nicely garnished confection with a tangy crust. I relished every forkful!"
Plerpl P.,"Newton, MA",0,4,,2.0,10/19/2013,"The only reason this particular restaurant is getting 2 stars is for the food and the cheesecake. We arrived at 6:30 and were told that the wait time was 5-10 minutes...15-20 minutes later we check with the hostess and she had actually messed up, and didn't take out name. I'm like ok, it happens. She says I will sit you right next, so we wait another 5 minutes and then she calls somebody else that ""wanted to sit at the patio"". Needless to say we were really frustrated by now. So we get seated and the waiter is nowhere to be seen for another good 5 minutes. Well we thought its a busy night so be patient. He takes our order and it took them 20 minutes to see them again...Very dissapointed!"
Leslie H.,"Brighton, MA",0,14,7,2.0,5/23/2015,The take-out food is not the same size that you get if you eat in. Salads to go are horrible and the sandwiches are just slapped into the containers. The take out area staff take their time picking up the phone. Very very disappointed in this eatery .
Hubert H.,"Cambridge, MA",30,601,,4.0,2/15/2014,"I've never been a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but I have to say for the amount of volume that they need to process during a busy weekend lunch hour they do an excellent job. I had the so-called Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was moderately creamy, not swimming in butter, some breaded chicken (a bit too thin on the actual meat for my taste) and a bit of tomato, or pepper. Definitely a very large portion (we ordered dinner portions during lunch hour). A taste of buddy's Jamaican chicken revealed it to be a bit too sweet, but otherwise a solid, fair, decent meal. Can skip dinner afterwards!"
Len G.,"Newton, MA",15,33,1,2.0,8/7/2011,"Every dish I ordered there is like an episode of Man vs Food.   Has anyone had any room left to even try their cheesecake?  One time I came there just for desert and I wasn't impressed ..   Same as all their other food, BIG portions, mediocre taste.   They need to stop trying to please everyone and concentrate on providing good quality food.   Their menu is huge and in addition they have advertisements in it.   When I'm hungry I'm not thinking of buying a diamond bracelet..   if they want to advertise in their menu they should advertise pepto bismol or tums at least that would be more appropriate. Order one of their salads, then enjoy eating it for the next 3 days..  The only reason I can think of going there is, if you're coming with 10 people who can't decide what type of food they want, either that or a group of competitor eaters. If you do go there, order something simple like a burger..  or chicken sandwich.  It will be average which is what this place is."
Sara M.,"Boston, MA",92,507,5,3.0,11/19/2011,"I only come to The Cheesecake Factory for a few things - their turkey club but with a cheeseburger instead of turkey, pumpkin cheesecake (when in season), and their red velvet cheesecake. The menu is enormous and the portions are comparable.  You can get many different types of cuisine and now they have a lighter menu with fewer calories, including drinks.  The mojito was delicious and not lacking flavour. While the menu is diverse, the food is not that great.  Also, I always feel like a pain the ass for modifying the turkey club to make a cheeseburger club instead.  One time the cheeseburger was cold, which was concerning.  Another time they didn't melt the cheese and then charged me $5 extra. The service isn't the best here and the servers don't exactly love their job.  It is what it is and I will continue to come here when I am craving one of the above."
Lauren B.,"Boston, MA",204,294,73,5.0,2/19/2012,"Came here on a Saturday night, nice and early to beat the rush.  Arrived around 5:40 and the four of us were seated almost immediately. From start to finish, our meal was efficient.  The serving staff at this restaurant moves around very quickly yet we never felt rushed. The only issue is that it's hard to get from one end of the restaurant to the other to use the restrooms because there are so many people waiting in the pathways in the lobby area. Go early so you don't have to wait in line!"
Khan A.,"Newton, MA",62,104,333,3.0,2/23/2013,"I love going to cheesecake. I think it's a good price for such a large portion of food that they have. I usually go for a dinner at this place once in 3 month or so. I usually get steak and i have no complains.  But I was very disappointed the last time I went to. Fried calamari for appetizer were delicious. And I love garlic sauce they offer with it. As for my main course I  decided to order something else and went for Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane. I got way too much sauce on my plate, I couldn't taste anything beside that sauce. If they would put a decent amount of sauce I would love that dish. But unfortunately that wasn't the case.  As for my friend we went with Chicken Bellagio. Originally dish was served with pasta but he change it to rise. Chicken was great but  there was so sauce so they rise was dry. The good part I share my sauce as I had plenty. So we kind make our dishes taste a bit better. Overall I do like Cheesecake Factory food but they just need to pay attention how they serve it."
Wendy L.,"San Francisco, CA",18,130,36,3.0,2/4/2012,"I found a coupe of things on the menu to stick with because every time I try something new I tend to be disappointed here.  APPETIZERS Buffalo Blasts - these are the bomb!!!! It's like like a buffalo chicken rangoon! must try Spinach & Artichoke dip - your average dip but it's still pretty delicious Samosas - not exactly authentic Indian but tasty. I like the thin crispy skin ENTREES Chicken Bellagio - two huge breaded chicken cutlets with linguine all over a creamy pesto sauce. Best thing ever added to the menu a couple years ago....it's 2 meals for me but so good. Only $13 Miso Salmon - glazed baked salmon over a bed of rice topped with sweet and creamy miso dressing. This is better than what I've had at Asian restaurants. CHEESECAKE Red Velvet Cheesecake - this is hands-down the best one ever!!!!!! It's unique, it's not too cheesy and not too heavy.  The service is so so here nothing special and nothing to complain about. When they are busy they are less attentive which is expected but in general a typical Cheesecake chain. Parking is convenient and the outdoor seating is nice in the summer."
