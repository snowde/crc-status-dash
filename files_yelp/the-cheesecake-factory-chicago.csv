Justin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",68,197,3724,5.0,8/23/2017,"Who doesn't love a good cheesecake after a pizza dinner? At least that is what 4 out of the 6 of us thought after we enjoyed a Chicago style pizza in Avondale, Illinois. We hopped in an Uber and ventured to the Magnificent mile to walk to the Cheesecake Factory at the John Hancock Center. Once there, we drooled over the selections in the display cases as you walk in. We went to put in our name and they had a table ready for us at 9pm. We ordered some cocktails and waters all around. After perusing the extensive list of 33 types of cheesecake and 9 other specialty desserts we made our choices. We ordered the Original cheesecake ""The one that started it all,"" the Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple, the Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake and last but definitely not least...Craig's Crazy Carrot cake Cheesecake. We all sampled each other's so people could try cakes they had never ordered and only two of us could finish the cakes. Thank goodness for togo containers!  Always a 5/5 for the cheese cakes and the service was exceptional and very attentive 5/5."
Jonna N.,"Chicago, IL",125,144,441,1.0,1/2/2018,"I went for the first time for my birthday dinner and it did not sit well in my stomach. We waited 45 minutes and spent most of that time in Water tower killing time waiting. I knew I would have to wait so I wasn't bothered. When we walked back in near the hostess, a busser asked us if we were just 2 and sat us down near the kitchen. So we didn't have to wait more. That was nice to be seated so fast. We got bread, drinks and our food in a timely manner, but halfway through eating my food my stomach hurt and I had to run to the bathroom. I got the bow-tie pasta with chicken and it did look greasy. I wouldn't go here again. I avoided the cheesecake, too. I didn't have an appetite to eat it. For birthdays, they only decorate the dessert cheesecake plate with happy birthday and you don't even get a discount or free cheesecake. Not worth going to again. I should have avoided this chain from the start."
Kimberly D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,15,3,1.0,11/1/2017,Terrible dirty restaurant in Chicago below the John Hancock building.  The bathrooms were deplorable. Don't go here you feel so filthy by the time you leave. I had two bites of my dinner. The table was sticky and my glass was dirty. There are a ton of places to eat in Chicago You don't need to waste your money here.
S K.,"Queen Anne, Seattle, WA",0,14,13,2.0,10/20/2017,"Dinner started well. Table of 4.  Sodas. Ordered. Good.  Food was brought out. One person got a burger, but server said 'fries on their way'. Later, server came back and said, 'fries coming'.  Then server never came back. We flagged him down and asked for a refill of Coke Zero.....but they ran out in the time we'd been there.  Never came back to refill other drinks. After we were ALL finished eating, server brings fries. My friend said, 'it's too late now. I needed them with my meal.  Please take them back.'  She suggested they comp her meal b/c she had a plain hamburger and promises of fries, but no luck in the 40 min we were eating. It really did set a negative experience.  Server came back and said no comp, but could have a piece of cheesecake.  Not a great solution for a diabetic.  Service was terrible.  It's like they're always busy so they don't care if you're happy or if you come back.  Luckily they don't need our business.....because we're not going back.  Food we had was tasty-the only reason for a second star."
Ursula P.,"Chicago, IL",213,185,1607,3.0,1/7/2018,"I always enjoy coming here to have my favorite Shrimp scampi dish and a slice of key lime cheesecake.   First off our waiter was not a normal State .  He seemed rushed and not at ease at all which made me ill at ease .  Secondly my dish was not hot .  It was barely warm, but I did eat some of it .  It would have been my usual shrimp scampi I love if it were hot . Unfortunately I didn't even want to be there anymore we paid our tab and left .  Tragic."
Ali C.,"Chicago, IL",49,477,1737,1.0,12/9/2017,Mediocre lunch restaurant in the 875 N Michigan building.  The Cobb salad had hard boiled eggs which were not fresh and fake bacon.  Lettuce was old.  The bathrooms were I'll maintained and unclean.  Not a pleasant experience.
Tairyn A.,"Coral Springs, FL",526,680,7288,3.0,11/7/2017,"Came to Cheesecake Factory from Navy pier before making our way to the Willis Tower to get a quick snack. We sat at the bar and got a couple of appetizers. Service was quick and food came out quick as well. We didn't get alcoholic drinks but even so, the bartender was pretty nice. We came on a early evening Friday. Dining room was not full, but there was quite a bit of people. Based on my experience, this was a great choice to get an early snack before dinner."
Christina S.,"Chicago, IL",48,322,2410,2.0,8/6/2017,"I ordered delivery and here it is... 5 stars for the Tiramisu Cheesecake which was decadent, delicious, and my favorite flavor so far! Thick graham cracker crust and flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth good cheesecake. 2 stars for the disgustingly burned ""Glamburger"" with skimpy toppings......I ordered a side ceasar salad instead of fries which was the only part that I actually ate.  I threw the hamburger in the garbage....really a bummer considering I was counting on a good burger from a reliable ""chain"" restaurant...very, very disappointed...."
Alexis S.,"Chicago, IL",73,1,1,4.0,1/1/2018,"I was really skeptical about getting the ""BANG BANG CHICKEN & SHRIMP"" only because it was Thai. Thai is usually spicy. I wanted to enjoy my meal not have to fan my mouth....BUT I ordered it anyway... & I'm glad I did !!!! It was AMAZING!! Flavors were very consistent across the palette. It was very delicious. It came served over your choose of brown or white rice. I ordered white with mine. Definitely a 10/10 highly recommend ."
Brittany H.,"Los Angeles, CA",276,152,92,4.0,11/6/2017,Grabbed some food to go. Ordered chicken tenders and fries. Was disappointed they didn't give me my fries had to return after I left to get my fries but once I got my fries they were fresh
Mike S.,"Naperville, IL",347,54,37,5.0,6/17/2017,"They accommodated a day-of group of 35 for us. Amazing customer service. My man Ro held the fort down for 35 orders, hero! Clean and busy. 5 stars for location and appearance of restaurant. 5 stars for taste of food.  Park in the Hancock tower parking and they'll validate it down to $15 for 3 hours. Major key."
Aaron R.,"Chicago, IL",12,45,85,1.0,9/30/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory on Michigan Avenue is really something. Don't get me wrong, having a nearby Cheesecake Factory with its massive menu and variety of food can really come in handy to quench whatever your fix is at any given moment. Unfortunately, I came here with my wife and nothing about the experience was delightful.  After being seated we didn't get bread, we asked for it, three times, to three different waiters and eventually got it. I waited over an hour for my food to come out. The manager said only a few more minutes, which turned into 20 more. When the food finally came out, the teriyaki chicken was undercooked and filled with crunchy tendons, gross! This was not farm to table...how about frozen dinner to table, anyone? Ultimately, the manager did everything he could to rectify the situation but the damage was done. I know the restaurant can get quite busy but a restaurant must, always, do their utmost to be attentive to their customers and, follow through with what they say. I ended up getting the chicken pineapple salad, which was pretty tasty. But again, I really can't get over the lack of quality service here, much room for improvement!"
Dania M.,"Wisconsin Dells, WI",37,12,9,1.0,12/31/2017,"Horrible service don't recommend this place wait to crazy service is really bad, we wait so much to get seated and to order a cheeescake so much almost 1 hour"
Mysel O.,"Chicago, IL",129,95,368,5.0,8/25/2017,Food and drinks are always good. Service is mediocre but then again I never really expect much from a chain restaurant
Erica L.,"Chicago, IL",4,63,54,5.0,8/1/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is the type of restaurant you go to that never let you down. Sure the wait time can be unpredictable but after a while you kinda know when it's peak time and when it's not. With that being said my cousin and I went on Monday, National Cheesecake day, with the intention of trying the funfetti cheesecake and to catch up. I decided on another flavor which was absolutely exquisite and my cousin tried the funfetti one and she really enjoyed it. We also had meals. My cousin had the chicken parmigiana sandwich and it looked pretty good, she said it was good. I had the beef pit dip sandwich and it was REALLY good. The bread was soft, the au jus was good and the meat tender, flavorful and plentiful. Our waitress was attentive even though it was crowded."
Natacha F.,"Jamaica, NY",5,31,116,5.0,7/14/2017,"My husband was a really, really hungry.  We stopped in and they seated us within 10 minutes. Our server, Mike was great!  He was very well mannered and knew the menú very well - all 20 pages of it! I'm a picky eater, and yes for someone who doesn't like creamy foods, I should not be where the name of the establishment has the word ""cheese"" in it, but my husband was really hungry and we had just left the observatory at the Water Tower, The Cheesecake Factory was right next door.  Mike understood my food quarks, and suggested the ""Diana Dine"" and it was delicious!!! Mike was absolutely outstanding!!!"
Sabrina S.,"Chicago, IL",85,61,240,2.0,12/15/2016,"I really wanted two slices of cheesecake for my birthday tomorrow. Since we were only two blocks away and I have my final tomorrow, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by today to get them.  The cashier wasn't friendly, or welcoming. She was blah and like a robot doing her job. She could've been nicer. But whatever, maybe she was there all day? They gave me a crumbled slice of cheesecake, and the other was a small slice. When my boyfriend asked the cashier about the slices, Paola, the cashier, said ""Maybe this one"" and took the slice that wasn't crumbled and exchanged it for a slightly bigger piece. My boyfriend spent nearly $20 on two small pieces of cheesecake, and there wasn't an apology or understanding or anything. The lemon raspberry cheesecake is ehhh. Do not recommend. The bottom was a little soggy and while it has an acceptable lemon flavor, so does the raspberry sauce on it. Could've tasted the actual raspberry part of it more. 1/5 The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is bomb. We get it every time we stop by. The raspberry and white chocolate work amazingly together, and while the raspberry is a bit tart, the flavor really comes out. 5/5 The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is why they're getting two stars. Wish I could give 2.5, but for the service I'm rounding down."
Neha R.,"Chicago, IL",9,23,6,5.0,11/30/2017,"What is there not to like? The menu has a million choices for everyone, and each location is consistent. I've been a regular since the days when everyone and their mom had their bday dinners here growing up. I loved it when I was vegetarian and would order the Portabella burger and the Japanese eggplant burger and STILL LOVE IT. Current go-to's are the Shrimp Bistro Pasta and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and of course the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Portions are HUGE and they are always accommodating about splitting portions. And who doesn't love that FREE brown oat bread? Gimme."
Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1089,1716,2662,3.0,10/3/2017,"For whatever it's worth, my dad has declared this the nicest Cheesecake Factory he's ever been in. Pro tip: On nice days, a table on the patio is worth it. On weekends, and even weekdays, the wait can be long. It's a popular spot for tourists and families. Bring your patience as there will be screaming kids. And you can expect the food and dessert to be just like any other Cheesecake Factory. But I will always keep coming back here for one main reason - the Buffalo Blasts. They are seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten."
Sarah Q.,"Elmwood Park, IL",2,46,1,1.0,12/20/2017,"Originally I would have given a much better review, unfortunately Cheesecake does not have a consistency of providing guests with great service not meals. When they are busy the quality decreases and unfortunately that is a deal breaker for any restaurant that operates in that manner! I feel that management needs to get their priorities straight and implement a plan to provide consistent high quality service as well as food on the menu!"
K V.,"Libertyville, IL",0,3,,1.0,1/3/2018,"They don't care because they don't have to.  Waited for a table at 3:30 in the afternoon for 45 minutes.  Finally escorted through a giant restaurant that had dozens of empty tables.  They don't staff the restaurant.  Even with throngs of people waiting.  Service was terrible and slow.  The food was garbage.  At 5:30, two of us were served cold food.  The other two waited for theirs to come, 10 minutes later which was hot.  This restaurant is an embarrassment to Chicago."
Christopher L.,"Chicago, IL",46,2,,1.0,12/15/2017,I ordered a pasta and oven roasted brocolli at 9:24 pm and it's 10:19 pm and I still haven't received my order. Friday night but still doesn't make sense for a restaurant to take a whole hour to make a plate of pasta and brocolli.
Chelsea C.,"Chicago, IL",151,63,6,1.0,6/19/2017,"Love it here! The biggest menu and lots of indoor and outdoor seating. It seems to always be busy but they get people in and out quickly. Event just going there for a slice of cheesecake is a fun outgoing where you won't leave hungry or disappointed. All of their dishes and drinks are delicious Unfortunately I had to update my review. We recently ordered delivery from here and I got my go to which is the barbecue chicken salad. On the receipt it clearly reads no tomatoes ( THATS IT). In this $16 salad, it's missing the avocado, apple, and bacon. I've had this salad numerous times and know what comes in it. Safe to say I'm extremely disappointed. Also, there's little pieces of tomatoes. WORST PART! It's missing the crunchy onion rings on top. This is more like a McDonald dollar menu salad."
Ga Hing C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,83,420,3.0,10/21/2016,"Let's start with the good part of the review first.  I love their complimentary bread. Distracts me from thinking about when the ordered food will come. We ordered the Luau salad. Let me tell you something, that salad was GIGANTIC AND DELICIOUS. The portion was good enough to share with 2-3 people. The second dish we ordered was the Chicken Picatta, it was good but a bit too sour for my taste (had lemon in the sauce).  As for appetizers, here comes the bad part of the review. We ordered the portabello, zucchini and avocado fries and the blue cheese pear flatbread (Pear blue cheese flatbread?). I expected shaved pears on the flatbread but instead there were this huge chunks of pears which made the flatbread disgusting or maybe it was the taste of those chunks of pears. I took all the pears out and it was a bit better. The avocado zucchini and portabello fries, they tasted pretty good. It was hard to tell what I was eating but my mom had an incident with the dish. She took a piece and started chewing and few seconds after I see her face change and pull out something from her mouth and seconds after a second thing from her mouth as well. She found TWO pieces of wire (one was probably 5cm long and the other one was 1cm long). We were all shocked and immediately called the waiter. I was so upset because it happened to my mom and if she swallowed those pieces of wire it would have been a bigger deal. I informed the waiter we found two pieces in the food while she was eating it. He called the manager and she spoke to us. She told us she knew exactly where they were coming from (fryer baskets).  The mananger kindly apologized and offered us complimentary dessert. We didn't want to make it a huge deal since my mom was fine and it was only the shock at that moment and a lot of customers sitting around us noticed the incident, so we took a piece of cheesecake and left things that way. We asked if the item could be removed from the check since we barely touched it and her response was ""of course, absolutely. I will take care of that"". When we asked for the check... THE APPETIZER WAS CHARGED! It was probably miscommunication but we told the server that the manager clearly stated that we were not going to have to pay for that appetizer. The server took care of it and we tipped him accordingly since the whole thing was not his (or the manager's) fault."
Billy L.,"Romeo, MI",20,215,526,3.0,4/23/2017,I always like the food at the cheesecake factory and this one was great too however the person I was with got a veggie burger that she said had no flavor.  I had the lunch sized salmon and it was very tasty.  The decor in this place was over the top. It reminded me of the kids Aladdin movie. The restrooms were clean and service was good.
Sandra S.,"Toronto, Canada",5,57,103,3.0,5/17/2017,"The only time I have cheesecake is on rare occasions when I go to the US. This was one of the occasions. My husband and I ordered the lemon and raspberry cheesecake as well as the ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake for take away to eat at our hotel room. The cheesecakes were good, however the red velvet cheesecake was a little too sweet for my taste. The other one was also sweet, although the sweetness was balanced by the slightly acidic raspberry coulis it was served with. Flavour-wise I give the cheesecakes 3.5 stars. For a really really delicious 5 star cheesecake, check out my review for Texas de Brazil! When it comes to the service, the guy who took our order, I believe his name was Juan, was very nice and friendly. He happily answered any questions the customers had about the different cakes and also came with suggestions based on your preferences. The service is a clear 5 star rating.  Although the awesome service brings up the rating, I would like to base this review on the food experience alone, which is why I give it 3 stars."
Keri M.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",379,54,7,3.0,12/6/2017,"The food is good, okay great! . Only reason for the 3 stars is the service sucks. Slow, and not attentive in the least bit.  We only saw the server to order."
Padma A.,"Chicago, IL",104,560,1329,3.0,8/22/2016,"We always end up here after a day of shopping at Water Tower Place and fortunately wait wasn't bad to get a table . We ordered whole bunch of things from gumbo, chicken sliders, eggplant parmesan, pasta and chicken with couscous. I didn't get any pictures because my phone was out of battery ...everything tasted okay but I wasn't happy with our servers attitude. Not nice at all!!"
KELLY M.,"Chicago, IL",88,106,439,4.0,4/29/2017,There cheesecakes are mouth watering...so many different flavor to chose. There foods are unbelievable large in size and you will need a box. The environment is nice and cozy...a little pack day to day. There is no valet parking you will need to park on the street.
Jimmy D.,"Ashburn, VA",1,64,4,1.0,8/19/2017,"After getting trapped at Chicago 360 (warning it takes forever to go up AND back down) we were starving and wanted to eat something quick. We were seated quickly and then everything went downhill from there.  We sat outside and I order a coke which took 15 mins. We finally got bread after 25 mins (I had to ask), and we finally got our food after sitting there for 45 min (we ordered right after we were seated). Never got my coke refilled, and of course when it was time to pay the check, he finally moved his ass to process my card. Why is it so hard to get decent service in America?? I've served before and it's not that hard. Yes you gotta move your ass, but good service equals consistent tips."
Dylan S.,"Normal, IL",105,67,102,4.0,8/1/2017,"While staying in Chicago, my friends and I decided to stop by The Cheesecake Factory underneath the John Hancock for dinner. I ordered a flatbread, and it was delicious. And obviously, their cheesecake is unreal. Although the location is great and the atmosphere is good, I think that you are paying for the name over the quality of the food. The menu seems pretty expensive for what you get, but it's a fun place to say that you've been to. I would definitely go back for cheesecake!"
Brooke W.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,6,,1.0,11/30/2017,"DO NOT ORDER TO GO, waited an entire hour for my food after calling in ahead of time."
Daniel S.,"Morgan Park, Chicago, IL",372,709,269,5.0,2/12/2017,"I know this is a national chain, but I gotta say it's pretty darn good, prices are a little expensive but you get so much food for it. Also their menu is so huge and vast, with so many different options. I got the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich, but there were easily 5 other things I could have gotten. As for the cheesecake, there are so many different flavors that look so good, I could have gotten at least 10 that I liked, but I ended up with the cookie dough slice. Everything tasted very good, and there's enough on the menu to warrant me coming back multiple times in the future. Also the designs on the inside are cool"
Jordan C.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",93,2,,1.0,12/4/2017,Ordered a single appetizer for takeout and its now been over 45 minutes I've been waiting. Absolutely shocking. They have 1 guy working and 6 people standing around. How the hell is that any sort of business model
Lu Y.,"Hyde Park, Chicago, IL",2,9,,2.0,11/21/2017,"I really don't want to say bad thing about this place. They seem like want to do a good job. However they left me no choice, CHAOS is the only word I can find to describe what we saw tonight, and I cannot even imagine what's happening back in the kitchen. I'd been waiting for my salad with ingredients they promised on the menu for over 90 minuets. I gave one extra stars for the manager's sort of sincere apology."
Ran H.,"Edgebrook, Chicago, IL",26,19,21,2.0,5/8/2017,"Me and my brother waited for 30 min for a table although we saw lots of empty tables for us to sit, the food was ok but we had to wait for another 30 min for our main course. Very disappointing, don't think I'm gonna eat here again."
Javier G.,"Strip District, Pittsburgh, PA",32,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Never again. Wanted to give the Cheese Ckae factory another try after having had an illegal charge at the restaurant in Pittsburgh which we had to contest through our bank and fortunately had overturned. Came in for brunch and was told they were not serving it after waiting 15 minutes for someone to show up . Two couples came and went after we eat and we did not get out food.  Spoke to manager and asked to wait longer. Decided to leave and as I said, never again."
Cassidy K.,"Littleton, CO",384,6,9,5.0,11/20/2017,Great place! I live in Colorado but I'll deffinetly be back here again! The cook eddy you could tell was very hard working and very dedicated! One of the best cheesecake factory's I've ever been to! Definitely better than colorados!
Brenda R.,"Chicago, IL",49,2,1,5.0,7/13/2017,If you come here make sure you ask for Jonathan. By far best service and an even better bartender. I come here all the time and by far amazing service.
Andrea B.,"Chicago, IL",263,201,378,3.0,12/5/2016,"I seriously love the cheesecake factory! I have not been to cheesecake since I have lived downtown ( 2 years or so). but I woke up in the morning and all I wanted was a chicken caesar salad from the Cheesecake Factory, and now it was my mission.  I came for dinner with a friend on Friday and it wasn't super busy ( we were expecting an hour plus wait) there was a table ready but we opted in for sitting in the bar. We sat down and started looking over the cocktail menu and then our waiter popped by. He helped us out narrow down our decision. I ordered the Blood orange Margarita ( without sweet and sour). I was not a fan whatsoever it was way too sweet for me so for my second drink I went with the safe choice of champagne. We were ready to order pretty much right away because we were starving. I ordered the appetizer chicken ceasar salad and my friend got the sliders with fries. I know the menu is extremely overwhelming with all of their options but I typically order ONLY the chicken caesar or the miso glazed salmon.   While we waited we noshed on some yummy cheesecake factory bread. the second best part to their caesar salad :). The food came out and it was delicious as always.  ALSO!!! to finish off our waiter was amazing. He was funny, attentive and very helpful."
