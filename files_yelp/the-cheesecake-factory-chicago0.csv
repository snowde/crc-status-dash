Alexandria L.,"Austin, TX",9,8,1,2.0,8/13/2015,"I really do hate writing bad reviews, but this experience irritated me.  My family and I are on vacation and this is our first time in Chicago.  When we arrived our waiter did get our drinks rapidly, after that it was horrible service. It took about 15-20 minutes to get our order, he brought to the table 8 pieces of bread to a table of 6 people, and our order took more than half an hour. May I add we never received one refill throughout our whole dining experience and this was a early lunch on a Thursday, it was hardly busy.  I am a foodie and the food was wonderful, but as far as the service I would be very skeptical to come back."
Hai L.,"Chicago, IL",3,6,,1.0,11/25/2016,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I thought it was a great place that always aimed to please. Until I went to the Michigan ave location in Chicago. Now I get it, I was there on the Friday after thanksgiving. They did do some things right but they def need to make sure the do some training of the staff.   Something around the lines of even though it's really busy doesn't mean we take each customer for granted.  So I finished some shopping and stopped into the bar area. Yes they are busy. No I don't expect presidential treatment. Just the normal I would normally get from a place that has always treated me well. Well where things went right, like I said it was busy. So the wait was long. But someone came to me to explain the situation and I did think that was a very nice gesture. I told him that I understood it is very busy and the food was out a few minutes after. That was good. What went wrong.  The food was very late and no bread was EVER offered while waiting. In fact I forgot that was even an option until they served me some AFTER my meal at which point I said I'm good. No need to waste food.  The breakfast sandwich finally came out on what looked like hard toasted buttered white bread. I asked the bartender about this and she said that's the way it is. Not wanting to cause a fuss I said it seems like white bread but whatever. I ate the inside and left the bread in a pile on the side. The bartender just grabbed it without a second glass and took it away. I don't know but if I were a waiter and saw a half eaten meal that was just questioned i would ask if everything was okay with the meal. Not a peep. I guess i as the customer is supposed to raise hell and be the bad guy?  Anyways finished my drink and left. Will not eat at this particular location again.  I know it was busy but some things should just be obvious from a server point of view.  Maybe I gave a tourist vibe out that they will never come back again or something.  To end maybe after DNA testing it would be found that it was brioche. But I clearly was not happy with the meal. I guess I just don't like the idea of paying for a nice sit down meal if I will be treated like I am at a soup kitchen."
Shaun L.,"Park City, UT",0,1,,1.0,3/28/2017,"Worst cheese cake factory I've  been to. Would not suggest any tourist to come in here as the service is terrible. Had to wait an hour for the food to arrive, drinks was not refil, sides was serve half an hour after I finished my meal, which was suppose to come together with the meal. The worst part is the server ignore our table..."
Anthony M.,"Chicago, IL",3577,1312,9468,1.0,11/16/2012,"Tourist Trap located in the basement of the 4th tallest building in Chicago.  Sounds like fun doesn't it...NOT!!! I feel like I have grown up beyond the Cheesecake factory.  I am so tired of the menu.  It is so big that it takes about 20 minutes to look through it before you can finally decide what to order and then the waiter comes over, after 20 minutes to tell you the specials. Honestly!  Just print them up and insert them in the front of this massive book they call a menu.  I believe less is more and the menu here wants to make everyone happy and in the end it makes no one happy!  And the evidence is in the lossy food they push out of the kitchen. On my most recent visit I asked the hostess to have a booth because this was going to be a working lunch and we needed some room to layout our documents and make notes.  She took me to a table that had benches...I asked her if she considered it a booth and she said yes.  I then informed her that my colleague was not going to be happy but she insisted it was a booth.  So we sat down and literally our chest were at the table height.  There was no way we could even write or take notes. I hate to say I told you so but I am going to say, ""I TOLD YOU SO!"" So we got up and asked her again if we could have a booth.  It was already after 1pm and we had missed the lunch crowd, so there were plenty of booths in the back.  She then took us to a booth that had been half cleaned but not on my side.  I grabbed a clean napkin from another table and picked up the dirty tray and moved it to the next table. I then used the napkin to wipe up the mess.  It was awkward with me just standing in the aisle and I was not about to sit on top of a mess. The bus boy arrived and started to clean our whole table again.  He then grabbed his dirty gross full of wet food tray. Next he took silverware from the table that the dirty gross full of wet food tray was sitting on top of and placed it all in front of me.  Honestly I was so grossed out.  Someone call the health department!  How oblivious could this guy be?  This is just bad management and a corporation that does not care about keeping things clean for their customers.  I got up again and went to a different table to get myself some fresh silverware, a new plate and a clean napkin.   We ordered our food and made a few simple requests.  For example, I ordered my turkey sandwich to have mayo on the side.  Guess what?  I got mayo on the side and also got mayo on the sandwich.  Really?  Again the kitchen did not care enough to read the notes of the waiter.  I did not send it back because we were having a business meeting and I just needed to keep working and eating at the same time.  I also got my salad dressing on the side too and it never came to the table.  I had to remind the food runner about it and eventually the waiter brought it. My buddy got the fish tacos and when I asked him how they were he made a face that told me they were not really good.  I am so glad we did not share them because I would have been mad.  He then said, ""I do not even like this place it is just so close to the office!""  Not to self...find a new restaurant to have our lunch meetings in! So yes this place is a tourist trap.  It is one of those chains that all of the hungry shoppers on Michigan Avenue from out of town end up in because it is familiar to them.  Now do not get me wrong there cheesecake is good and maybe cheesecake on this visit would have made me feel better or even 4 star-ish but cheesecake and business lunches do not go together. The food here is not that great.  In all of the years I have still not found anything on this menu that just jumps out and says, ""Order me all of the time!""  In fact, I just give up!  This place is a cheesecake place that happens to serve bad food too.  And when I say bad food...I mean food that is not even special or good.  I was also not happy with the service.  A hostess who could not actually give us a booth even though there were a bunch available.  A busboy who really did not care if his dirty disgusting tray was touching clean silverware and plates.  Someone could get sick because of this.  Food that had special requests made but none of the special requests were even carried out correctly.   This place just keeps packing people in and does not care to make it the best experience ever!  And that is sad with all of the amazing restaurants in downtown Chicago.  I wish you would clean up your act cheesecake factory and have a little respect for the product you are serving the public."
Food C.,"Latham, IL",2,35,2,4.0,9/3/2016,"After eating out for a week in Chitown a group of six of us can agree that T.C.F. was one of the best. Was pleased with the Chicken Biscuit, it had like a open pot pie over sliced chicken on one end and mashed potatoes on the other. The biscuits weren't all that fresh but the whole wheat bread with oats made up for it (YUM) Others had the Parmesan Chicken sandwich and raved about how good it was! Didn't try any cheesecake myself but the display case had numerous variety's."
Chad R.,"Denver, CO",51,153,,2.0,6/24/2015,"Thought it'd be funny to try one out while at this Chicago conference (nothing ""wrong"" with the brand, per se, but not my thing (you know?))-- joke was on me. It was 62 degrees in there. I had to blow in my hands the entire meal, and spent most of my time looking around at others and commiserating with them while they complained to their 'other/s' about how cold it was. A single tear streaks down my cheek, as I've only got Yelp at this meal. In fact, I need to take a break from typing this to sit on my hands because I'm losing feeling in them. Okay, I'm back-- so what else about this joint?  Highlight comes via the hostess station: these girls is a bunch of sour pusses, for real.  The only time they smile is when they swing through a server station to flirt with a guy or talk trash about the one coworker also seating (possibly manager) who is obviously not like the others. I'll just leave it at that. They clearly lack knowledge about the concept of situational awareness, too. I've seen them give the gasface to at least a dozen families/groups because, I imagine, they're ""not sitting down fast enoughjustsitdown,God!"" If you work here a few times a week, and stand at a crappy little podium with a map of the joint, you'll likely be more comfy there. Customers, on the other hand, particularly ones that don't frequent the place, want to gauge the light, or whether or not they're sitting under the full blast AC, or are identifying exits, or who knows what but why is your sour little gas face in such a hurry to get back to the podium?  You ain't smilin' or greetin'. You just gasfacin'. And you get paid by the hour, not by the guest (or gasface). Look, the food's good, right?  But I can't imagine ever coming back to this atmosphere. Above comments are completely exclusive of my server, Lauren, who was rad. Although she kept calling me 'sir' when I'm obviously not that kind of customer, made it known, and she must've known anyhow because it was weird EVERY single time. I think this place breeds that sort of weirdness, though, and I encourage her to at the very least be aware it, best case scenario get outta there."
Mark W.,"St. Charles, IL",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2016,"This happened this morning about 10:45.  I walked up to the hostess, stepping around a stroller that was parked in front of her stand.  The Hostess greeted me by telling me I pushed the staff who was seating people out of the way.  I had not touched anyone; I was just slipping around the stroller to check in.  I said, Are you talking to me?""  She said ""Yes, you just pushed her out of the way.""  I said I was sorry and walked out.  Not a greeting I was expecting.  I was sarcastically told to have a nice day as I was leaving.  I don't think the hostess could see the stroller in front of her stand, so she thought my stepping around it was pushing the staff out of the way, but I didn't touch anyone.  A rude way to greet a new customer.  Won't be back."
Benjamin H.,"Riverside, CA",0,17,1,1.0,2/29/2016,"Wow, where to start. We waited an hour, granted it was a Saturday night, so I don't mind waiting, but we were put at a tiny table where I could easily have bumped elbows with the parties on either side. This should have been a red flag, but we were hungry so we gave it a shot. We saw how busy it was so after waiting to be helped (for the first time) for another 10 minutes, we ordered our drinks, and an appetizer. Our waiter returned with our drinks 5 minutes later, but forgot to get my wife her water. I asked him kindly to bring the water as soon as he could, and we also ordered our food. The water never came, and neither did the appetizer, our food was out 20 minutes later. It was primarily cold. We left never having received the appetizer or water, but you better believe they left the appetizer on the bill. Don't worry, I had it removed before paying. Maybe we had a bad experience because went at the wrong time, but there are too many good restaurants in Chicago to waste money and time at a place like this. Truly disappointing. Just go somewhere else."
Basilman S.,"Iowa City, IA",8,23,15,1.0,8/27/2015,"I understand that the cheesecake is great, but we didn't have any. The service was painfully slow, I had an omelet, that was quite mediocre. I asked to have salmon mixed with the omelet. It came on the side. Took forever to get the food and the check. Not a good experience. May just have been our waiter who was inexperienced or mediocre or just didn't give a s#€!. Other guests with a different waiter seems to have better service and experience.  Have been here once before for my son's birthday after a ball game, 3 years ago. Packed, loud, but the good and service were great."
Rich R.,"Chicago, IL",0,40,,2.0,8/6/2016,"Came here on Friday at 7:30 and it was the worst service. We were seated and no one came by for 15 minutes with no bread or water. Finally our waitress Rachel showed up and we ordered food for my 6 year old daughter and a glass of wine and a beer. 10 minutes later we got our bread, still no water and no drinks. We finally got water but still no drinks. Finally our drinks arrived and not much later my daughter's Mac and cheese came. The Mac and cheese was one of the best. My wife and I finally got our food and it was mediocre. I had the factory burger and it came with a hard baguette roll which was not good to have with a burger. My wife had salmon with mashed potatoes and liked the salmon but not the chunky luke warm mashed potatoes. The service and food is not worth coming here again. This place has a lot of tourists and probably does not care as they are making their money regardless."
Kavya V.,"Baltimore, MD",27,21,2,5.0,7/12/2016,Has always been the best.. The food definetely depends on the choice of ur order... Careful wat u order as their menu is majestic ... The veggie toast with feta cheese was yummmm.. And the cheesecakes are divine...
Diane W.,"Chicago, IL",0,51,,2.0,12/28/2016,I went there earlier this year and the pasta dish wasnt cooked all the way thru. Only 60% cooked thru. 2 stars for that experience...
Alexia H.,"Toronto, Canada",11,25,7,4.0,6/30/2016,"There was quite a wait when we got to the restaurant, but after that the service was good. Great staff, the menu was amazing and the dessert menu was even better. The drinks are really expensive but delicious. Our food came quickly after we ordered and our waiter came back to check on us and ensure everything was good and to see if we needed anything else. I was there for a birthday lunch and had ordered cheesecake for dessert - the wait staff sang and happy birthday to you was written in chocolate sauce around the plate with a candle in the cheesecake. Not sure what all the negative reviews are about, but we had an incredible experience. It's super convenient if you're visiting 360 or shopping on Mag Mile as well."
Nia H.,"Chicago, IL",231,1,,2.0,8/13/2016,"Surprised at the poor service and the lack of presentation! The food was thrown together, the waiter was severely inattentive, and the wait was long. Usually love this chain, but no cigar with this location. Save your money, go somewhere local."
Mike R.,"Chicago, IL",50,9,,1.0,9/8/2015,"Location: Great Atmosphere: Good Food: Decent Service: Poor Went on a busy memorial day (evening), yesterday, and was met with slow service, food items that they ran out of, and a waiter that kept telling his customers that they were very busy every time he made an error or had a problem with service/food, etc.  I noticed other customers were getting the same type of poor service as me.  To end the evening on a better note we decided to pay our check and grab a cheesecake on the way out.  We paid our bill and went up to the counter to order cheesecake but were rejected by the staff saying we had to order through our server.  Our server was barely serving us while we were seated, and I was not about to go find him to help me order cheesecake now.  They lost my cheesecake business that night, and all future business at this restaurant chain. Goodbye and good luck Cheesecake Factory!"
Ji-Seung K.,"Idyllwild Pine Cove, CA",1,5,4,1.0,9/5/2015,"The meatball spaghetti was soggy and we have waited 20 minutes longer because the woman on counter took someone else instead lol She never apologized and five teams who came later than us went ahead. Also, the carbonara was served in dirty dish, the sauce was spilled all over the plate. They didn't attempt to wipe it before it's served."
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,4.0,5/25/2014,"Have you ever gone into ""Cheesecake Factory"" and ordered a small plate just to make sure you have room for cheesecake at the end? I had PRETZEL-COVERED CHICKEN STICKS (yay!) so I could save room for the CHRIS' OUTRAGEOUS CHEESECAKE (it's the German Chocolate Cake of cheesecakes). If there's anything truly outrageous it's the super-large space and super-packed patronage, I don't know how the staff handles it. I was served the small plate before I got bread. The waiter came over and apologized. As I sat there past 2:30 on a leisure afternoon when I needed to kill time, the ""Factory"" died down with less and less customers. I talked to the waiter for like 8-minutes, gabbing on this and that. We traded dessert secrets. #goodtimes"
Zarnigor N.,"Chicago, IL",28,35,247,4.0,10/17/2015,"I came with my son here and had to wait for long hour... Then waitress bring me very dirty tea cup , I had to ask for new one . The food and quality is not bad .."
Kelly B.,"Chicago, IL",4,63,,1.0,7/22/2015,"Holy sh*t, the hostess working last night had the WORST attitude that I have ever come across in my life. Just a suggestion to her, if you hate your job that much...then quit! So rude, not helpful, and rolled her eyes several times when customers were putting in reservations.  On the plus side, our waitress was amazing. She really made up for the witch working at the hostess stand."
Austin H.,"Marquette, MI",52,8,,5.0,8/7/2016,"Fast seating for a magnificent mile restaurant, friendly wait staff, food came out fast and was delicious. As always, grade A cheesecake as well."
