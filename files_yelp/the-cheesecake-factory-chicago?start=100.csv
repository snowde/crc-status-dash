Nina B.,"Chicago, IL",50,267,205,3.0,12/11/2016,"My daughter was in town a little bit ago and though she does stuff on a whim, I do not... But, I did, this time, because my littlest baby girl said, ""... come on mom let's go...""  To the Cheesecake Factory ""downtown""...A definite magical atmosphere, however, the service leaves me a little disappointed for the ""downtown"" location. They were busy, but the wait wasn't too long - about 20 minutes. Our table was so close to the other table, that when the other party exited they could sit and nearly did on our table. I guess it's all about packing them in like sardines. Truly, this detracts from the dining experience, (and it should be an experience when it's ""downtown"" - maybe I just don't get out much and this is how it is ""downtown""), but it's so loud! There was all that dining space upstairs - empty...  Our waiter didn't pull the chair for me, which I thought was what was supposed to happen in an upscale ""downtown"" restaurant, especially, when the older person is closest to you. And speaking of age... although, not major, my daughter who does have a young face, wasn't carded! Her pride was offended - but not their fault - she's getting older and looks 21+. The silverware wasn't clean as was the menu. The food was their regular, (like the Oakbrook location) - so I'm of the mind they can do this with their eyes closed. It was tasty, once home the avocado rolls didn't re-heat too well - again this is not their fault, however, since I had eaten lite I was looking forward to a dessert, so I was shocked when the waiter assumed we were not having a dessert and came with the check. No dessert menu. I didn't request the check. I got the feeling he thought it was time to turn the table over for his next tip - I don't know what he thought but I did want my dessert - really it's my main treat for going out - especially to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY! I asked for the dessert menu and ordered my dessert, paid, left a decent tip, even with poor service. The end. I'll return to the Oakbrook location, even though it's a trek now that I'm a Chicagoan again, but the service is better and that is huge on my list - next to quality."
Jessica D.,"Chicago, IL",94,17,2,1.0,10/15/2017,"Total CheeseCRAP factory! Went on a Tuesday so the place wasn't insanely crowded or anything so we were seated pretty quickly but only after snob city president (the hostess) took our party info. Oh and when you first walk in, despite employees running around like ants, no one tells you where the hell to check in at. The setup is a little funky. After being seated and waiting for an eternity we finally get to meet our waiter who is a first class AHOLE!Just an angry young man with a negative, snippy vibe. We were out and in a good mood and this guy just murdered that. Our drinks took, you guessed it, forever, to get there and they were obviously rushed. After having placed our order the manager, I think, comes over and tells us 2 out of the 4 items we ordered aren't available per the chef- so we just say thanks but we're leaving and he seems to have trouble processing this because his eyes roll and he repeats 'so you're leaving 'like 2-3 times . He doesn't ask why or for feedback. Oh, and we never got our bread. The Chicago chain should be ashamed of themselves. In the heart of the city with options all around and they aren't on their A game?! Y'all are gonna end up like Applebee's if you're not careful. Bottom line is that, again, with all the options so near by this can't be your go-to for a meal out in the city. Totally bummed I wasted my hard earned money on parking when we didn't even stay. Oh and it's super dark inside- like a little too dark. Almost need your cell phone flashlight to read the menu dark. What are they hiding in that low light? I was honestly a little worried about the cleanliness especially with all those intricate wall and ceiling folds all over. Just sayin'"
Daena S.,"Saint John, IN",1,6,8,5.0,8/3/2017,"The cheesecake, like always, was to die for and our waitress was the sweetest! Always a good time at this Cheesecake Factory"
Jacky C.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,5.0,9/4/2017,This was amazing I came here for me and my husbands 6 year anniversary 3 months ago. And I loved it so much !!!!! I had a burger a shake and ofcourse chocolate cheese cake I recommend ! So fancy and nice staff
Austin E.,"Huntley, IL",197,15,1,2.0,6/18/2017,"Corporate event last night at this location. Always a tough task for staff to host a large group, but I'm always left unimpressed with their efforts. I feel that they were understaffed and weren't able to compensate accordingly. Waiters took awhile to take our orders, and we waited over an hour to get our food. By then, my food was cold. Chill, Cheesecake... Chill."
C L.,"Utica, MI",1,15,5,1.0,4/21/2017,The place was full of energy and decorated in fun decor. Unfortunately my meal turned out to be a big disappointment. I ordered the Black bean burger which had absolutely no flavor - worst I have ever had. The side salad was ok but nothing to write home about. My friend enjoyed her salmon. I might go again to try something different.
Melissa B.,"Mill Creek, IN",8,17,28,4.0,7/4/2016,"Stopped in for lunch after going to the 360 in the Hancock building. The restaurant was fairly busy but I was seating quickly. Brandon D was great.  I ordered the chicken bellagio which was to die for. While I waited, I was given a basket to two mini-loaves of bread - a ciabatta and a dark, oaty bread that was super soft and yummy.  I'm only giving four stars because the entree portion is so huge I couldn't finish it.  Now, it has to be some sort of crime to go to Cheescake Factory and not have cheesecake. So, I got it to go naturally. ;) Red Velvet that is just amazing.  I would certainly return to this CF again. And, if I ordered the bellagio again I'd ask if I can get a half order!"
Tara P.,"Marshall, MI",50,15,2,3.0,4/9/2017,"It was ok, but I don't think the cheesecake was worth $8. I've had better for less.   The service was very slow (take out slices of cheesecake shouldn't take that long!) and the staff was borderline rude and definitely unprofessional - the one taking our order was talking about beating someone's a$$.  There are better places to go in the city."
Sharon K.,"Streeterville, Chicago, IL",63,2,,1.0,10/15/2017,"Poor service. Ordered two slices of cheese cake to go. I was handed a bag with whipped cream smeared all over one side of the bag. When I asked for another bag, the person acted as though it was an inconvenience. When I took out the boxes to transfer bags, the boxes had whipped cream all over the top and bottom of them. To pay almost $18 for two slices of cheesecake, this kind of service is ridiculous."
VIctoria D.,"Alpharetta, GA",67,1,,1.0,9/3/2016,"This place is absolutely horrible. Our party had to wait over 1.5 hours to get a seat. Not only was the wait horrible, but the service was deplorable. Once the pager rang out party had to wait an additional hour to get a table. This was after multiple complaints to many different servers, managers, and owners. On top of all all of the waiting our party was was promised and free appetizers (probably, so I won't post a bad review) and it took more than 45 minutes to arrive.  In all the wait time to get a table, the service, and the kitchen preparing time are all horrid. If it were possible the place would receive zero stars from me."
Jen M.,"Chicago, IL",56,72,378,4.0,5/22/2016,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory's dessert selection. Wanted to try a lighter slice of cheesecake and decided on their ""30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.""  It was a good choice! 2 layers of moist chocolate cake w/ 2 layers of original cheesecake & chocolate ganache.  There are a few other non-Cheesecake selections like the Lemon Cream Torte that is also very good! Ample outdoor seatings in the John Hancock sub-level to enjoy that delectable slice of heaven!"
Katherine W.,"Vancouver, WA",22,22,6,5.0,7/23/2017,"I love all cheesecake factory's but this location was FANTASTIC. In such a prime location, packed with people the service and food were perfect."
Nadia R.,"San Diego, CA",153,95,368,3.0,8/26/2016,"When we came to the table it was still dirty and there was no silverware. The food is good though .. Prices are high and the wait is long, but if you can make it through.."
Julie T.,"Valparaiso, IN",9,3,4,5.0,7/8/2017,"Awesome! Only a 10 minute wait on a Saturday night to be seated. Excellent wait staff, Wren was phenomenal. The place was packed but we still got our meal quickly. Then we stopped to tell the manager, Tom, on the way out what a great time we had and he walked us out and showed us some of the local art. Amazing time. Highly recommend."
Hassan S.,"Chicago, IL",58,3,3,4.0,7/6/2016,"Another great place to visit, I came here with friends for a late dinner and decided to go with one of the salads on the menu!  It took them a few to get us seated but not that significant delay for a last call. I ordered BBQ chicken ranch salad which tasted great and the portion is huge, definitely for more than one person! Could be also shared for the whole table.  Now lets talk about the taste, i loved it, the combination of the greens, chicken with BBQ sauce on top and the crusty fried onions on top! I took one star off for their lack of order in bringing food to the table, the cheesecake came 1st then the bread & butter then the food! But i wouldn't be blaming them it is the end of the day!  One of the awesome places to try in chicago for sure."
Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1004,1629,3.0,3/28/2016,I got into town super late and we were looking for somewhere to get a quick and light bite to eat.  One doesn't usually associate The Cheesecake Factory with a quick and light bite but we both ordered the White Chicken Chili with brown rice which is on the Skinnylicious menu.  It's just the right size portion where you're satisfied but don't feel like you've eaten tons and tons of food.  It's got just a little bit of spice and I like the texture of the brown rice in it.  It's clean and the service was decent and friendly.  They move a lot of people in and out here every single day. *Side note: I think this was the first Cheesecake Factory I ever ate at 15+ years ago.
Brooke L.,"Culver City, CA",2,9,,2.0,5/29/2017,I ordered take out for lunch and was a bit disappointed. I've been to Cheesecake Factory's plenty of different times just different locations and never really had an issue. I ordered the lunch size mango chicken salad and to my surprise there was one small piece of chicken cut into four slices. The overall salad was a good size but it didn't feel like a chicken salad. The chicken was also very dry and overcooked. Not something I would expect for a $14 salad.
Noelle H.,"Indianapolis, IN",18,7,,4.0,5/28/2017,"Waits always tend to be long here, but there are usually places you can sit while you wait. Staff was friendly and very attentive. We just had appetizers, drinks and cheesecake. All was delicious. Family friendly. Low lighting can make reading menu difficult depending on your seat. Great stop. They have a walk up counter if you just want to take Cheesecake to go."
Lee M.,"Chicago, IL",41,43,74,4.0,10/10/2016,"I must admit as a newbie in Chicago, I had to try the cheesecake factory. Well I like the food, the food is tasty, I have been there more than 3 times and I have not been disappointed. Very touristy but u know what, I love trying different types of restaurants. The cheesecake is amazing I often go there to crab a slice or two, that's the main reason why I go there lol. The waiters and the waitresses try really hard to make customers happy, despite the place being busy most of the time. This is my take away spot lol"
Alan F.,"Hercules, CA",67,383,62,4.0,12/29/2015,"Located on the sunken plaza at the base of the John Hancock Center.  A somewhat dark room, with daylight from windows on the plaza not penetrating far into the labyrinthine interior.  Decoratively a bit unsettling, full of pink, bulgy organic shapes--Jonah might have felt right at home. We arrived around 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was crowded to the point of discomfort, but we were handed a pager, and seated within about 20 minutes.  Our server came at once, though the food was then rather slow to be delivered. The menu is typical of the Cheesecake Factory chain:  Lots of variety, most things dependably well-executed, portions probably too damned big.  We ordered a couple of old favorites, and a couple of things new to us: - Taco sampler.  Four different kinds of tacos with four dipping sauces.  Adequate as an appetizer for two, and could serve as a perfectly satisfactory entree for one. - Thai lettuce wraps.  My wife's go-to Cheesecake Factory choice.  Delicious and messy; a few toothpicks might help with some of the structural engineering problems. - Cashew chicken.  Big chunks of sautéed white-meat chicken, cashews, green onions, white and black sesame seeds; rather dry, but what sauce there was, was mildly spicy.  Choice of white or brown rice.  Pretty good, though many Chinese restaurants do this sort of thing better.  Probably not something I'd order again, with so many other dishes waiting to be tried. - Mango Key lime cheesecake.  Our usual favorite from among the large selection of the house's eponymous specialty. Restrooms clean, but at least one of the stalls in the men's room was out of toilet paper; this had not been corrected fifteen minutes after being called to the attention of a server. On all of the bus lines on North Michigan Avenue.  Five blocks from the Chicago Avenue station on the Red Line."
