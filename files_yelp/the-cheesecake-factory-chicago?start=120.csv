Takayla S.,"Chicago, IL",163,4,1,1.0,9/19/2017,"Ordered a delivery from here on Postmates.... food was very poorly presented and made incorrectly. Put onions on my nachos after I asked for none because of an allergy. The factory nachos here used to be up to par.. no the tortilla chips are prepared burnt and over salted. They skimped down on the amount of melted cheese and chicken and jalapeños. Quality here has gone down tremendously, another restaurant who clearly let their standards go down the drain. Also ordered loaded tots which was mixed in with some sort of fried zucchini I believe. Gross! I felt robbed after receiving my order! $30 wasted and I then wished  I would have got chipotle and it would have been ten times better than what I got here smh"
Chatzy F.,"Chicago, IL",1,116,7,4.0,1/17/2017,"We love Cheesecake factory.  We when we eat there its always good.  But I do not recommend ordering from Grub Hub or Door Dash etc.  The food is always cold, they don't pack the food very well and really should not being doing food orders unless it is cheesecake.  We order from Cheesecake on Door Dash and it took forever probably because of the location.  We called and a manager could not get to the phone?!  So we had to reheat all our food because it was ice cold.   I would venture to say because there is no place for Grubhub or Doordash to park so no one wants to go down there to pick up food which I can understand but we had over $100++ in food got no credit or anything so we will never do this again!"
Mary T.,"Fishers, IN",72,159,253,3.0,2/14/2016,"Service was so slow! Sat in the bar immediately, which was great. We were there late at 1030pm, yet the kitchen seemed like it couldn't handle the amount of orders or something.  For two people, waited 45 minutes for food but it wasn't terribly busy. Manager came up and apologized for the wait even though we didn't complain. Even after telling us it would be 'right out', it still took 10 more minutes.  Server was very slow and couldn't multitask well. Food was good as usual though."
Valsielen M.,"Chicago, IL",57,86,398,1.0,2/7/2016,I found a black hair in my salad! It was disgusting! When I told the clerk she just apologized! and I could no longer continue to eat after seeing that hair in my food! disappointed!
Logan R.,"Long Beach, CA",231,61,85,4.0,7/10/2016,"Oddest looking Cheesecake Factory I have ever seen. Nonetheless, does not disappoint.. Busy but was sat within minutes. Extremely nice staff, great food. Drinks came very fast. Little chaotic, and food came a little slow, but would definitely recommend after having drinks at the signature lounge on the 96th floor."
Chew B.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,1,1.0,5/5/2017,"Incredibly disappointed. I was craving cheesecake so I decided to get delivery, I also got a milkshake and appetizer. The order was supposed to arrive in 30 min but ended up taking an hour. When the food showed up the appetizer was cold and the milkshake was melted, but the worst part is that the cheesecake, the whole reason I placed the order in the first place- was missing. So I spent $45 on a soupy milkshake and ice cold artichoke dip. Yay."
Ana B.,"Hollywood, FL",0,10,18,5.0,1/8/2016,"I'm happy we came, despite the so and so reviews. We went to the 360 Chicago observatory. This place is a next to it, hidden gem in a great location. Perfect place for a romantic dinner or bday celebration. For a Friday night,  there was no waiting for a party of 2. Geat, fast service. Recommend Andrew to be your waiter, very nice and fast.  Ordered stuffed tortilla, orange chicken and a piece of cheesecake. We had to take half of the food to go because the portions are generous. Little pricey, but totally an indulgence worth it !!! Food fresh and hot!"
Rawlins R.,"Chicago, IL",156,977,777,3.0,12/31/2014,Came to this location right under or on the ground level of the Hancock building.  It was a late Monday night. If you really want to impress someone I would suggest coming to this location as I stated is located under the Hancock.   I came for desert only and got the Reese's Cheesecake.  It was extremely good but also extremely rich.  I should of gotten a glass of milk to go with it.
Miguel G.,"Valley Glen, CA",49,88,32,1.0,6/21/2016,Have to update this to a 1 star now as we had a second manager come by and in our opinion made it worse. She comped our appetizers however those were fine. What they should have comped were our two meals. They obviously did that because the appetizers were half the price.  Cheesecake Factory is off our list when visiting Chicago.
Calvin R.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,24,1,3.0,9/19/2016,"Generally good food with decent portions. I had their lunch Renee special, which is half a sandwich, the soup of the day, and a green salad, for around $12. It was pretty good. The soup was their French onion and it was rich and tasty.  Service was excellent. Our server Gyro was attentive but not intrusive.  This is a good value if you want to get something for lunch that is not just a sandwich, but not necessarily looking for gourmet cooking."
JAM T.,"Chicago, IL",35,16,59,4.0,3/19/2017,"Love their burgers and the portions are huge! We went to their branch at John Hancock for lunch. The kids had pizzas and my wife had pasta. They gave out a free cheesecake and sang to my daughter for her birthday. Overall, we had a fun time and I'd recommend CCF any day!"
Kara B.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,1.0,3/18/2017,"This is a terrible location. Slow moving, forget it if you want to order carry out.  Chili and steak medallions took over 50 minutes. How do they sustain a business taking this long?"
Honest R.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",0,26,3,3.0,8/22/2017,"I don't really like this place a lot but they are known for quick seating even with crazy amount of people there.  We sat outside and we ordered an appetizer and its the best I ate at any cheese cake factory (Avocado roll), then comes the entrees, grilled sample was cooked a little extra and its too thin however the flavor is good. Mash potato is awesome, Broccoli was just dipped in hot water (very crunchy with no seasoning at all). friend salad (BBQ chicken - replace chicken with shrimp) was very very good, however they charged 7# extra for ~ 8 pieces of shrimp and didn't put the chicken!! i thought that i a rip off since we asked for replacement (i know shrimp can be more expensive but they were small and only 8 pieces). but anyways we enjoyed the seating. Cheese cake was awesome like always (Godiva)  Waiter was out of this world and I mean he came a couple of times to confirm order, Napkins translated to more silverware. Ice water translated to warm water, wheat bread translated to white bread and so on :-). but he was apologizing the whole time and being nice. but it was an ok dinner sitting. I would go again."
Corey F.,"Fort Wayne, IN",13,68,7,5.0,1/24/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and this location unique charm in downtown Chicago.  This is my second lunch (out of towner) at this location.  The host gave my requested seat with a view, and waitress was great.  How can you not love the HUGE menu at these places?!  Tex mex egg rolls, Cuban rolls, miso salmon, BBQ salad are all my favorites."
Val G.,"Kittery, ME",96,28,42,4.0,8/22/2016,"Long wait, defiantly recommend calling ahead with a reservation (waited 1 1/2 hrs) - service was so so .. Took about 15-20 minutes before someone came Over with water.. Bread basket didn't arrive for another 15-20 min or so.. Food was decent, meal portion sizes are enormous..enough to share!"
doreen s.,"Chicago, IL",35,205,10,1.0,1/2/2017,"Not the very best food I've eaten but,  was the closest thing to our hotel as we were booked at the Westin. Went for NYE and ordered the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. The 12 green beans they gave me were good, had a splash of lemon. However, the chicken tasted like a very basic home economics class recipe from a beginner. The mashed potatoes were very chunky and not creamy at all and a little salty. I also ordered chicken nachos that my bf liked but, I wasn't overly impressed with those either. The guacamole was bland, just tasted like mashed avocados. My bf ordered the fish and chips but, didn't like it because the batter was too airy and the fish was extremely soft and had no texture. For dessert he ordered the caramel cheesecake to go. He said it was ok, just a tad too sweet. Sadly, we won't be returning due to bad service and lousy food."
Deb Z.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,81,,3.0,7/30/2017,"Very dark inside, needs better lighting, very crowded, food was fine, cheese cake was great!"
Julia S.,"East Hampton, CT",5,24,5,1.0,7/29/2017,"Waited nearly an hour longer than estimated time as stated by waiter. My husband's mixed drink was too sweet & short on alcohol. My Miso Salmon had the thinnest salmon steak by at least an inch of any Cheesecake Factory that I'd ordered it from & it tasted fishy. Also, the restaurant is louder than a high school cafeteria."
Albert C.,"Minneapolis, MN",137,62,15,4.0,4/12/2016,"Cheesecake is definitely an indulgence that we all crave from time to time, and The Cheesecake Factory is the place you want to go if you want to give in to your urges! Although they do cheesecake very well, their other food items are delicious as well.  From large tasty Cobb Salads, to extra large portions of pasta, you won't be disappointed with what you get!  But be warned, since their portions are so large, you'll probably end up taking some home with you, unless you share! I went to the John Hancock location in Chicago, so it tends to be a busier place.  The lighting was very low, so it made it a bit difficult to see the menu, and it did make me a bit sleepy.  It could also have been from a food coma, or the 5 miles of walking I did.... but more lighting would still have been appreciated.  Their bathrooms are located outside the restaurant, and accessible to the general public, I'm not a huge fan of that..... When the warmer weather hits... try to get an outdoor table and enjoy the sunshine!"
Jimmy B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,17,4,1.0,5/16/2017,"I ve always stop by at this restaurant for its location and the service but today my experience was terrible. We have arrived at the bar area where you'll be seated and requested to dine outside. The waiter came and asked us what we would like to drink and i ve told him water only. His facial expressions changed and it took him 20 minutes to bring our drinks. There were other tables whom order there food way after us they have ate and left ,still our food hasn't arrived.Finally waiter showed up and brought our drinks and i asked him about the bread and butter whick every table gets. He told me that i had to let him know if i want it or not. I've been coming to this place for a while and never experienced this unprofessionalism but still no food. Its been 35 minutes. Waiter was hitting on every lady siting outside and taking care of there orders. I was so upset and i find the manager to complain. He said he is going to talk to him but I doubt it. Anyway i will not be coming back here."
