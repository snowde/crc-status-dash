Sarah D.,"Northbrook, IL",0,2,,1.0,2/25/2017,"I would  never come back to this restaurant, worst experience in my life , it took one hour to have our food get ready  and everytime  we ask our server whose name is Tanya she  was saying your food  is ready but was not finally food  came she put in the middle of table very hard  and took off, called the manager no apology , everything was very unpleasant feom the beginning hope this people will learn how to treat their guest , very sad seeing this kind of people working there,   i hope manager will read this and take the proper actions, so nobody have to go through this,.by the way we have our food take out because  we did not have any appetite left"
Oakland L.,"Chicago, IL",455,47,1,4.0,1/8/2017,"Mom came to visited, with a limited diet, perfect go to place because good and a chain. Literally everytime I go there, I'm immediately seated because I go straight to the large bar area. I've never had bad service or food, and cheesecake is always like it's supposed to be... Not super expensive,  but definitely not cheap.  Still good and I usually have left overs. Glad I no longer working at Water Tower cause that cheesecake was way too accessible. LoL"
JJ J.,"Fort Wayne, IN",3,48,31,5.0,1/13/2017,Everything here is absolutely delicious! Our server Omar was very tentative and prompt.
Gregory R.,"Champaign, IL",96,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,"I wish I could give zero stars. Our server, Ashley B, didn't greet our table for over 10 minutes. She then took our drinks, then proceeded to disappear for another 10-15 minutes. She never came to check on us, a different server gave me a refill and served our food, which was cold. I told Ashley and she didn't even apologize for it. Her response was ""oh okay"" and made me pay for the entire meal. Ordered Godiva cheesecake to go, which should come with a square of Godiva chocolate, nowhere to be found. Awful service, I'm highly disappointed. If you ever go to this location and get sat with Ashley B, just get up and leave."
Damla E.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",136,65,65,3.0,6/13/2016,"Everytime I come to this place, the service is disappointing. Each time we have to wait for a long time. Plus, I am not a fan of the dark lighting -makes me sleepy. However, the food is very tasety and comes in big portions. I would highly recommend Santa Fe salad!"
H K.,"Adrian, MI",2,325,174,2.0,6/20/2017,Came here with large group. Disappointed as the food was meh. Okay not great yet expensive. Would rather had gone to a Chicago favorite than a chain. Downfall of groupthink.  Cheesecake was good.
Whit G.,"Westmont, IL",0,5,2,1.0,7/30/2017,"This was a very unpleasant experience, not only was there trash on the floor, and my table was disgusting. But my meal was cold and I was unable to eat with my family because they screwed up my order. We had to constantly ask for refills.... It also seemed as though the quality has changed for the worst."
Matthew D.,"Chicago, IL",22,27,,5.0,3/14/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. It is spectacular. Ginormous menu. The bread is incredible and the service is usually good. Love their fries, sandwiches, and their pasta carbonara in particular! I don't branch out much on the menu because we really just go for the cheesecake. They have this one covered in caramel right now that is to die for. Honestly (and perhaps sadly) still one of our favorite places to eat in Chicago after living here for years.  Unfortunately, there is just about always a huge wait (45-hour) but it's a huge chain and its in the heart of Michigan ave. so it's honestly to be expected. Go kill some time upstairs in Best Buy drooling over TVs you'll never be able to afford!"
R. S.,"Lake Forest, IL",0,57,2,1.0,10/25/2016,"Chicken piccata barely edible.  Pasta very salty, didn't like the sauce.  Meatloaf was dry.  Was seated at a table about a foot from a servers' work area even though there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant in more pleasant and relaxing areas.  Felt like we were a party of 3 instead of 2 as servers came to the computer to enter orders, etc. while we were waiting for/eating our meal.  Sat down only to find a dirty salad plate.  Had to ask for bread and butter.  Even the lemonade was bad -- way too tart.  Eventually moved to a different table but it was too late at that point to enjoy our afternoon lunch.  Will absolutely not return."
Jessie Y.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,3.0,7/28/2017,The food is good but the service is not. Maybe because it is at a travel spot that has too many tourists everyday.
Ellie W.,"New York, NY",146,24,29,3.0,7/30/2015,"Yes, it is National Cheesecake Day which calls for longer waits and more business. Luckily, my mother and I grabbed a table in the bar section (first come/first serve) within about 10 minutes of arriving.  SERVICE: BAD! Our waiter seemed to be out of it. Every time we asked for something he forgot. It would take 2-3 times asking or having to ask another sever before getting something.  FOOD: I ordered a Kid's gluten-free pasta with Alfredo. My mother had Spaghetti with Meatball which she liked. When my pasta came out it was not done with a hard texture. I know GF has a different texture but this was terrible! I sent it back and within 10-15mins I had a fresh bowl. This was somewhat better but not the best GF pasta I have had. Thankfully the manager took off my pasta! CHEESECAKE: This restaurant has one cheesecake that is currently gluten-free: Godiva Chocolate. It is delicious and definitely the best part of the meal. Also, because it is National Cheesecake Day it was half-price!  I would recommend skipping the food and maybe going for dessert. You can also just order the cheesecake To-Go through the bakery."
Ed E.,"Berkeley, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/4/2017,"I love a good cheesecake factory but this isn't one. I had to queue for 10 minutes to order for take out, and saw a couple ahead of me wait 20 minutes for two slices of cheesecake. It took 15 minutes and a manager to get my hot drink. It has been 35 minutes so far and there's no sign of my food... oh, and a homeless man solicited me for change in the restaurant while I was waiting. This location needs an urgent change of management."
Wesley L.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",271,2,,1.0,7/25/2017,"I've came to this Cheesecake Factory twice now.  Sad to say I'm never going back.  The service here was extremely depressing. We tried calling over our waitress multiple times, each time with no response. We didn't see her for 45 minutes. No drink refill, no bread refill..nothing. She came very fast and often when it came time to pay.  This happened both times we came to this location."
Samantha J.,"Moorhead, MN",2,103,,4.0,11/14/2016,"Prior to going here I read yelp reviews & thought decor was a weird thing to be mentioned but then I ate here & see that yes, decor is odd. Especially the bathroom, not really sure what's going on there.  Anyway, it was busy when I arrived but I was able to sit in the bar & service was on par with a popular, busy restaurant. I was actually impressed that my sever was able to juggle so much, I would have been a hot mess. The guacamole salad was delicious, and of course the cheesecake was great."
Michael L.,"Carol Stream, IL",4,55,24,5.0,5/27/2016,"I am in love with Cheesecake Factory! Their food is always amazing. I love their variety of cheesecake and dessert. Their food and cheesecake is a little pricey. It is also very high in calories. They do have a menu with lower calorie options. I had the basil, tomato, and cheese flatbread and it was amazing!"
Jessica C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,10,,5.0,1/1/2017,"Met some friends here for dinner on New Years Eve and got seated right away around 5:30. I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the chicken parm sandwich. I didn't share any of my meal! The portion size was great, the food was hot, and we all cleaned our plates. Drinks were always refilled and our waitress was attentive. Ordered the tiramisu cheesecake for desert to share with my husband but I wish I would've ordered my own! It was really good! We always come to the Cheesecake Factory when we are in Chicago and we always have excellent food and service. I just thought I would write a review because this resturant is always so consistent with their food and service. We will be back next time we visit Chicago!"
Siva N.,"Evanston, IL",11,17,,1.0,11/29/2016,Slowest service ever. Had to wait forever to place order and to receive the food. They took forever to thin the check and take it back. This is not the first time this happened. Never coming back.
Yara Z.,"Washington, DC",101,1,,1.0,1/21/2017,Possible the worst service I've experienced. The waitress forgot our order and we had to leave without eating after waiting for more than an hour.
Chelsea F.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",6,14,5,1.0,6/29/2016,"Living nearby we have gone to this location often and recently we have increasingly been displeased. Last night 6/28 we came in and were sat right away. We watched as a blonde female server walked past our table at least 8 times serving the tables next us and never acknowledging us. We were sat at table 70 something.  Then we watched as two other tables were sat nearby and greeted quickly. We came hungry and left hungry and without service 15 min later.  We let the hostess know and all she had to say was ""That's weird."" Very disappointed.  I understand mistakes happen but each of the past few time we've been there we have seen fellow diners walk out without service.  We come for the food but we won't be back because the service is subpar.  Also they should invest in a person to polish the  silverware. This time I actually had chunks of food stuck to my cutlery. If someone would have come by our table I would have asked for a replacement."
Angela B.,"Bettendorf, IA",40,28,19,3.0,12/18/2016,"When we come to Chicago we always have to dessert at the Cheesecake Factory.  Only dessert, though.  There are much better places for dinner first.  The cheesecake is fantastic.  The wait however is not.  The fact that you can't make reservations is a bit of a frustration.  Next time we'll get it as take-out."
