Cristina G.,"West New York, NJ",11,69,137,4.0,5/19/2015,We order chicken teriyaki the portion was big and the flavour very nice also . Me and my son eat and left food on the plate it's enough for 2 people and 1 kid:-)
J C.,"Chicago, IL",4,12,23,4.0,5/23/2016,They have my favorite the chicken Bellagio or the chicken Madeira are good I love the mashed potatoes I hate not having room for dessert but i will share a strawberry shortcake
Jewel L.,"Chicago, IL",0,25,30,1.0,5/22/2016,"Bad service day. Food was delicious but server wasn't available when i needed her. Still waiting for my reorder... been here nearly an hour and just got my food. Unhappy since I made a special trip here for the pancakes. BTW, they are the lighrest, fluffiest most delicious pancakes I've ever had. Wish the were available other than ust on Sundays."
Sandra D.,"Champaign, IL",0,3,,1.0,7/6/2017,"I've been here many times and loved every experience. Today, not so much. When I walked in the door, I felt like I should have walked out. My friend and I has to wait 15 minutes for the hostess to come and have us seated. Once we've gotten seated, it just went downhill from there. The hostess told us to stand to the side so she can while down the table and when I told her the table was still sticky, she gave me attitude and told me she just whipped it. After that, the waitress came and she didn't look to happy. After waiting about 35 minutes for our food, I had to ask a waiter who was passing by how much longer it would be. Waited 10 more minutes and still no reply so I had asked another waiter who passed by to bring us our check. I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!! Never again will I recommend someone to come back. Worst place to go! Horrible service!!!"
Shlik K.,"Chicago, IL",18,15,5,5.0,9/24/2016,This place is always packed and you need to wait in line . But it's worth it. My favorite dish there is 4 cheese pasta and for dessert are tiramisu and red velvet cheesecake and also they don't have a good signal there and no wifi so we all talk and enjoy it
Robert K.,"Chicago, IL",1,42,,2.0,7/1/2017,"We ordered for delivery and had a pretty mixed experience.  My wife had the BBQ Chicken Ranch Salad which was good and she ate all of it.  I had the Spicy Chicken with Cashews which wasn't very good.  It was overly garlicy (I've had it before and it was never so garlic filled), and it was burned and charred.  Much of the chicken was black and tasted of carbon.  Had I been at the restaurant I'd have sent it back.  Sadly, with delivery (and having waited an hour for it to be delivered, I had to pick through to find the least burnt bits.  Won't do that again."
Ty D.,"Chicago, IL",2,12,,1.0,3/6/2017,"Manager is a dick. Not one employee knew how to properly answer a phone. Didn't ask for details on my issue, or any information and put me on hold twice for extended periods of time. Finally decided to just Uber all the way back to get help and saw that they were very slow (Monday night) and there was no reason for such a long hold. The manager was a complete asshole when I asked him if this was acceptable. Wouldn't go here again and wouldn't recommend."
Owen M.,"White Bear Lake, MN",3,13,17,5.0,6/30/2016,Very good I have been here many times and all were good. It's very fancy and there chess cake is amazing! They get people in and out in a timely manner. I would suggest going here if you want something delicious!!
Meg S.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,,3.0,9/21/2016,"Recently was here for dinner on a Monday night. While the wait to be seated was immediate, the service was slow and no sufficient. When our server arrived to the table, she didn't greet us probably, she just stated that she would be over with waters. We had to remind her to bring bread to the table. She was slow to bring out drinks to the table. Then are drinks were watered down. Towards the end of our meal, I guess she decided she should put in some effort to get a tip. That's when she became attentive to our table."
Lucia O.,"Portage, MI",25,4,1,2.0,9/2/2016,My poor review is all based on the manager's ability to solve an issue it was today. Lack of respect completely for your customers. We were given a table for 4 people after waiting for a 5 people table for 45 minutes we were not rushing and waited patiently.At the moment we got our 5 plates plates couldn't even fit the table we removed our drinks to barely make it. one person sat in the aisle was asked to stand up and allow the dirty dishes cart to pass at least twice as well as a wheel chair.  He never came back we need it to go and find him to complain about his lack of attention. There were enough tables to move us to an appropriate table. He offered a desert which of course we were not even interested in getting. So sad because the food as always was really good.  By the way more than 3 tables were waiting for him to stop an fix something.
Preston S.,"Bridgman, MI",72,101,199,2.0,6/23/2017,"You wait a very long time to eat in a bizarre looking dining area (my table mates said it makes them think of the pictures from colonoscopy results​, haha). So as you dine from the inside of the small intestine, you realize that the food is not great, not even very good. My family likes this place so we went. I will attempt to talk them out of it next time. The prices are too high. How can these average tasting dishes cost so much!!!??? The cheesecake was pretty good, though steeply priced as well. This is a fine example of a staple place that really doesn't live up to its name. The food maybe is 3 stars, but with such a high price, it goes down to 1 star. The cheesecake is 4 stars but again balances to 2 stars at such a ludicrous price. The service is quite good at 4 stars and overall look of the place was so bizarre that it is 2 stars. Wait is a factor at 1 star for not being worth the wait! Service and good cheesecake saves this from a one star review. Sorry for the critical review but so much hype, folks should know it doesn't live up!"
Christine B.,"Chicago, IL",2,19,10,4.0,3/18/2016,"I live in Chicago with so many great restaurants so I feel like it might be sinful to eat here on the regular but every time I come downtown I want to    The Cheesecake Factory has everything you could possibly want in a menu. There is a taste for any palate, including a skinny menu with meals under 600 calories. Just be sure to be mentally prepared to have enough food for an army! Hello to go boxes! The cheesecake is also delicious as well obviously! We always have a great service and food."
Executive Chef Ronnie B.,"Plymouth Township, MI",14,69,103,2.0,2/19/2015,"The good the bad and the ugly: The GAUDIEST restaurant I've ever seen personally.  My dirty silverware, just so off putting A nice, but no name server as an ""order taker"" No saucer OR spoon for my dbl espresso, not happy.   This pizza is pretty ""picture perfect"" Avocado club screams yummy value Tiramisu was stellar, yet the beauty of a classic dessert from Italy was taken away with a half a pound of whipped cream they put on the desert- there's literally more whipped cream and than there was desert, very sad."
Stuart L.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,11/23/2016,"NEVER EVER GET TAKE OUT FROM HERE!!!!!!! Ordered by phone and was told order would be ready by 7:05.  Arrived at 7:10.  Can you believe they made us wait in a long line of people ordering cheesecake slices and coffees? When we finally got to the front of the line, they ""could not find"" our order, and told us the manager ""was searching for it.""  When the manager finally came out, he was completely unaware of our order, and certainly had not been searching for it.  Turns out they hadn't started on our order.   Eventually they made our order.  No apologies or discounts.   This is just simply not a place that does takeout well."
Robert P.,"Chicago, IL",61,41,30,4.0,5/10/2016,"Very Iconic in the city of Chicago, This particular location that is (located in the Hancock Building) Has a very cool atmosphere and a full bar and also a huge display of, you guessed it, CHEESECAKE! The food and service are both also very good. They offer a huge array of dishes varying in cuisine from Asian to Italian to Classic American they have a good variety of food, if anything i would suggest shortening their menu, it's a good read.. :-)  Overall Very good 4 Star!"
Shiyuan Y.,"Chicago, IL",22,10,18,4.0,11/20/2016,"Delicious skinnylicious hamburger. The architecture style is special. My friends ordered steak, and tasted great. There were a lot of people, we waited 50 minutes. The cheesecake looks great!!!"
Neil D.,"Addison, IL",0,25,,2.0,6/9/2017,"I live in streeterville and unfortunately went to the cheese cake factory against my better judgement.Got a Russian waitress who was clueless,asked for a Hamburger with Swiss cheese and she had no idea what Swiss cheese was and asked me to write it down ..which I did and the then the hamburger came out with no cheese at all.the over weight manager was certainly not carrying his weight either.. Will not go to this establishment ever again."
Norm J.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",726,511,1982,3.0,12/1/2013,"Positives 5 Stars for the variety of cheesecakes (favorites include: Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and Vanilla Bean Cheesecake) 4 Stars for the employees working there. On each visit to this location I have had excellent service from the greeter telling me how ridiculous long I'll have to wait to eat at a chain restaurant, to the host/hostess who have seated me and didn't mind finding me another table when I saw that they were trying to place me next to a family with a bunch of kids, to the friendly wait staff. 3 Stars for the take out menu. The fact that you place your order and pick it up so you don't have to wait 2 hours just to sit and eat food that is OK, but not AMAZING. 3 Stars for the SkinnyLicious Menu were all the items are under 590 calories; thus allowing you to not feel so guilty when you order two slices of cheesecake for yourself (one to eat there and one to go). Negatives 1 Star for the boat load of tourist who visit this place as if it has 3 Michelin Stars. If there isn't a Cheesecake Factory in your country I can SORTA understand why you would come here, but if there's one in your city you have no excuse for visiting this place when you're on vacation. 2 Stars for the food which is nothing special. It's OK, but you'll never hear me calling home to tell the family about the awesome 1500 calorie pasta dish I just had."
Ken L.,"Clearwater, FL",62,133,38,4.0,5/2/2015,Love their outdoor seating option.  Their menu is extensive as a small book so finding something for everyone shouldn't be a problem.  Definitely call ahead add the wait can be up to 1 hour.
Teal R.,"Chicago, IL",23,137,27,3.0,4/4/2015,"Staying with my family on Michigan Ave. and needed somewhere to eat. Walked into a very crowded Cheesecake Factory and headed straight for the bar. We found an open table quickly but it was quite dirty. The service was great, however, the food was less than desirable. We shared the nachos that were just ""ok"". This location in general lacked the charm.  Will not return, mostly based on that I don't come down to river north often."
