Joanne M.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,5/21/2017,Not as clean as they used to be I keep finding food on my cup and around my plate that looks nothing the food on my dinner plate. Crumbs are on the table when seated. And food stuck to silver ware. Bathrooms are messy. Food is okay.
Mike S.,"Woodridge, IL",0,4,,2.0,5/6/2017,Inept bartenders. Have no awareness of people actually sitting at the bar (only 10 spots with 2 bartenders).  Had to flag one down for drink after sitting at bar for several minutes. Had to flag down down again to clear plate and get another drink. Appreciate service well is busy. Fully expect second bartender to handle bar top.  Disappointing.
David L.,"Los Angeles, CA",253,201,37,2.0,10/8/2015,Got the specialty shrimp pasta. Ugh service is slow but large portions. Pretty much what you expect from this place. Only come here if you have to.
Kyle L.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,11/1/2016,"Terrible server, I told him I was in a hurry and if he could bring the food out, and he had an absolute emotional breakdown. Never asked if everything was fine, and never offered me water."
Jake G.,"Westmont, IL",1,11,9,5.0,3/20/2017,Cheesecake Factory is a great place to get consistently good food and service. You HAVE to get their cheesecake obviously. I wish I could remember our servers name because he was great! Very attentive.
Kyra N.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,1,2.0,10/23/2016,"My husband and I used to love their salads, but now - not so much!  They're all lettuce.  Southwest salad should have beans, corn, chicken - it was 95% lettuce."
Kristine R.,"Chicago, IL",500,86,74,5.0,12/5/2014,"This location is located at the bottom of the John Hancock building. It's such a beautiful location! They are always super busy but the wait time is never too long. You can either eat inside or outside but I prefer eating inside because the fountain outside is kind of loud. Service here is impeccable! I've never had bad service here. They get your food out to you pretty fast too.  We got the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer and it was OK. Not as good as other places. It was kinda too thick for me. Their calamari is amazing. I always get the fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli and portobello mushrooms and I'm always satisfied about halfway through the entree because it's such a huge portion. My husband orders something different everytime we go from burgers to steak and he is always satisfied by the end of the meal. Their cheesecake here, just like any other Cheesecake Factory is to die for! I try to get something different every time, and I've never been disappointed. But I think my most favorite thing about this restaurant is the vibe. It's dim in there with the beautiful city outside."
Amy V.,"Chicago, IL",61,143,116,4.0,2/27/2016,"Great place for kids and adults as well! The salads are to die for AND the dessert! Our waiter, Chris, is the most patient dealing our table of Girl Scouts! And it's convenient...right in the Hancock!! Go there!0"
Antony J.,"Chicago, IL",3,4,18,4.0,3/30/2016,4 stars for the food. This place has tables in every corner crowding the place but can't complain cause the place is so crowded! Since we wer just a party of two we got a sorta shitty place. So life hack : go with at least 3 people. You're welcome!
Chetan G.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,66,4.0,3/26/2016,"The place is huge. Food is good, portions are huge. Avoid ordering too many dishes at once. Service is good and quick too. Pricing is also reasonable. Rating out of 5: Food - 4 Service -4.0 (self-service) Ambiance - 3.5 Pricing - 4 Would I visit again? Definitely!"
Ania P.,"Bordeaux, France",77,204,671,4.0,2/17/2015,Beautiful and tasty cheesecakes everywhere!  Really hard to make a choice! :) Nice place to go w friends or family!
Amy A.,"Cedar Falls, IA",43,283,567,3.0,8/31/2014,"Never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. Can't say I'll be in line to go back.  We just wanted a nice dinner with our kids on our last night in Chicago. We checked in at 4:45 and it was an hour wait. We waited outside where a ton of other people were also waiting.  It was pretty much an hour and it was our turn. We were seated in a corner booth. At least 10 minutes later our hurried waiter finally appeared. We ordered our drinks and meals at that time. At least 10 minutes after that our bread came. At least 15 - 20 minutes after that our food came.  I got the chicken bellagio which was actually wonderful. My husband had the chicken and biscuit which was just ""eh"" and the kids had mini corn dogs, chicken strips and pasta Parmesan. My daughters fries were not brought out with her meal and she was pretty much done eating by the time they arrived.  The waiter never really asked how we were doing. He was running around like a maniac which made us feel hurried and on edge. NOT a relaxing meal. He did keep our glasses full.  We ordered our cheesecakes to go. Paid and left.  Within 20 minutes of leaving all four of my kids were sick with upset stomachs and diarrhea. Not a good experience when you have one bathroom in the hotel and they are fighting over who has to go worse. Something they used in the food destroyed their bowels. After an hour they were good again.  We brought back two slices of cheesecake. A cherry and a dulce de leche. Must say ""super disappointed"". Very little flavor, whipped cream was blah- had absolutely no sweetener in it and might as well been butter on top. Couldn't finish either slice.  For $77 with a tip on top of that- I will go eat elsewhere."
Ian B.,"Downtown Core, Toronto, Canada",0,11,21,4.0,7/14/2015,"We had a great server which made the experience enjoyable.  It was quite loud, but the venue was able to seat is quite quickly.  The Mac and cheese balls and the nachos with chicken were great. I didn't mind the house wine.  Definitely recommend this place, but know that it can be quite loud.  However, the service was fast!"
MC A.,"Chicago, IL",0,72,2,2.0,10/10/2016,"Have been here multiple times. Love their cheesecakes! Don't like the service, especially the hostesses. They're rude and unprofessional. The food is okay, big portions but no substance. The past few times I would just get the cheesecakes from the carry out area. That's all I want from them."
Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,2.0,9/8/2014,"Disappointed with this location, the lowest I have every rated a Cheesecake Factory was a 4 before. After walking in drenched from the soaking rain and the restaurant not being very busy we were ignored for a few minutes...and were finally seated. The next thing the bread that was brought out was totally hard and stale, and they did not bring any of that brown oat bread, just the white stuff (everyone else got a mixture)  Suffice to say after one bite we moved the bread to the side. The meal and Cheesecake were good, but when finished the meal we had to wait 15 minutes to order Cheesecake even though the restaurant was not busy.  I am sure it was just one of those things that happen but it was my worst Cheesecake Factory experience."
Will M.,"New York, NY",0,24,1,2.0,7/4/2016,Decent corporate food.  Terrible service.  Sitting at bar and the plates from customers who left before I arrived are still sitting next to me after I'm done eating.   Bar completely understaffed.  Bartender nice enough when he gets a chance to look up.
Hurriyat G.,"London, KY",1,42,83,4.0,12/28/2014,"Went to Cheesecake Factory on Christmas Eve. Had to wait for 45 minutes even though I was told to wait for only 15 minutes. Anyway, after this got shown to my table and had a great server which made up for the initial mess-up. Ordered Bang bang chicken n shrimp along with Chicken with cashew nuts... Both were great... Though it could have been a tad bit more spicy. The kiddie meals (cheese pizza n chicken tenders) were also nicer than most places. The kids had fudge sundaes which were great and the cheesecake slices (keylime n original) were melt-in-ur-mouth. Overall, a great meal n a wonderful experience for 2 adults n 2 kids in $65.  The only thing I'd change is the portions..... Seeing mountains of food makes me lose my appetite a bit :)"
Shanita T.,"Joliet, IL",78,7,,2.0,9/29/2016,"Food is okay but slow slow slow service.  Here on a Thursday night, half empty place,  still waited a hour and half... this is the 3rd bad experience we have had here. 3 strikes you're out! :-/"
lyn m.,"San Francisco, CA",38,206,93,4.0,10/6/2015,Had just done the hop on hop off tour and this was close to where we got off.  First of all we sat almost in the dark we had to request another table why do they have such dark lighting you need to use a flashlight! We were sat near the window the food is always the same in Cheesecake Factory so you know what to expect ! We had quesadillas and pot stickers to start - delicious- I ordered lunch size pasta carbonara but was still a big portion shared strawberry cheesecake for dessert really good.
Corban S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",214,27,15,5.0,10/16/2015,"Was very busy, but used to that with the Cheese Cake Factory.  Facility was clean and has a great look and feel.   A bunch of the guys were able to sit at the bar and order without a wait.  Make it very easy for us to get in and watch the game at the bar. One thing that we wish was upgraded...  The TV screens at the bar were WAY to small.  Must have been smaller than 32"" witch is almost a wast for having a tv screen up showing a sporting event.  So...  It's not a sports bar.  If your going to try and watch a game and eat...  Go somewhere else."
