William T.,"Franklin, WI",0,7,1,2.0,5/5/2015,"Love the cheesecake factory but was terribly disappointed with this one. Stopped in for lunch. Wasn't busy when we arrived. Our server, Alberto, had the energy of a small gerbil but I quickly realized that,  because we were not in business suits,  nor were we a couple of skinny blonde coeds, he wouldn't pay much attention to us. Getting his attention was akin to pulling teeth. Orders received were wrong and it took 45 min to get food. Manager attempted to placate us with a free slice of cheesecake and a less than heartfelt apology from, Alberto. We balked at that, paid our bill and walked out.  Not coming back to this location."
Andrew C.,"Chicago, IL",145,39,,3.0,9/20/2016,"I love the Cheescake Factory chain. I love the cheesecake, weird interior and wide range of food (not to mention the famous great bread). This location is a favorite of mine to stop in because it's very convenient. Cheesecake here is always 5 stars, although it is pretty expensive (easily 8-12 bucks a slice). Unfortunately, I find service to be really inconsistent and often slow. There have been multiple instances where I have waited 30 min to be seated, been assigned by the hostess to a table and then told that I will need to wait because there has been an error with the seating. Food really varies depending on what you get. I have had some of the burgers, which are okay but then the salads and some of the pizzas can really vary based on the visit."
Kelly D.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,23,1,2.0,3/28/2015,"After visiting this location a few times I finally picked my birthday to express my sheer disappointment with this location.  In short, a friend and I just wanted cheesecake. We specified this to the host and she gave us a pager w/ my name and told us it would be 20 minutes.  30 minutes go by, and after lingering around the bar and stepping outside for a cigarette I decided to go check on the time at the host stand. Apparently my name and pager wasn't on the list. They had done a shift change so the hostess was not the one I was dealing with before. She explained to me that our name wasn't on the list anymore. I requested a manager. I knew it wasn't her fault.  So Julie, the manager, comes and speaks with me and I explain the situation. She checks the host stand with the hostess and the previous hostess had noted that ""we walked away"". What? Like, you think I want to take this pager to-go with me? No, I was walking around the bar and hanging by the front of the restaurant. I am aware and I made it clear that I knew it wasn't the current hostess's fault. I work in the industry so these things happen and it just sucks. Fortunately Julie was able to seat us immediately.  Unfortunately, the waitress we had must have caught wind of the situation and wasn't very pleasant. We were very nice to her so it was a shame she didn't greet us and introduce herself like she did to the other tables around us. My friend even told the hostess and manager that it was my birthday, but I didn't get a candle or any kind of ""happy birthday"" from anyone.  I've had issues with this place before in getting seated and not stellar service. But I guess that's what you get with corporate chain restaurants. I'm finally closing my chapter with the cheesecake factory. The two stars I'm leaving is for Julie and the newest hostess because they were the only help to this situation."
William C.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,,4.0,1/1/2017,Been coming here since 1995. Love the place. Just wish they would redecorate. Need to freshen it up guys!
Scott C.,"STUDIO CITY, CA",0,5,1,2.0,12/28/2016,"While your suggestion is good for a breakfast or dinner, it doesn't address the point I made in the review.  Please set expectations properly for waiting patrons."
Giselle V.,"Irvine, CA",213,282,1594,1.0,3/23/2014,"This is a chain restaurant so the food tastes the same as it does at every other Cheesecake Factory. However, the service leaves A LOT to be desired.  When we sat down our waiter said that he would be back to take our drink order and when he came back he brought waters for all four of us with him. (The waters aren't significant now but they will be). After he took our drink order (two iced teas, one diet coke, one strawberry lemonade) and appetizer order, he came back with the two teas and said that he had completely forgotten the diet coke and needed to pick up the lemonade from the bar and that he had put in our order for the appetizer.  We didn't see him for another 10 minutes, that is, he didn't come to our table to check on us. He served the table across from us the lemonade we had ordered, that they had ordered after us and he stood at the computer most of the time shaking his head and punching buttons.  Our appetizer came out before the other half of our drink order came. When we were done with our appetizer he brought the other two drinks that had been ordered. We waited another 50 minutes for our food to come. During this time our waiter visited the aforementioned computer several times and continued to punch more buttons, shake his head in frustration and talk to himself.  The one time he did come to see how we were, he brought a water pitcher to refill the waters that we had to drink because our regular drink orders were empty, but he didn't refill any of the drinks we actually wanted. It took another 20 minutes after we finished our food, and had requested boxes, for us to receive said boxes and the check.  The only way this restaurant would be worth visiting is if someone came at a time that was not the busy dinner rush.  We sat next to the kitchen and saw how small it was and that the kitchen staff was trying their hardest to pump out orders while the wait staff stood around joking with each other, dropping plates and cups (6 dropped plates/cups occurred while we were seated, God knows how many there are every other day) and scavenging off of plates of food that had been returned.  As a patron I honestly do not appreciate seeing my waiter, and the rest of the wait staff, eat off of the same plate, using their bare hands and proceeding with their duties without washing their hands at any time during the whole process.  Also, the kitchen was rather small and I am not sure if it was responsible for serving both stories of the restaurant, which would not be wise on behalf of the restaurant chain itself, which could have accounted for it taking so long with our food to arrive.  Either way, if I am in the Chicago area again I will not return to this location."
Hilbert S.,"Chicago, IL",1,6,3,2.0,4/16/2016,"I visited this place today and I was not impressed with my food selection (fried catfish,mash potatoes, green beans, and corn. The catfish was over cooked and tasted like it was kept over from the following evening dinner. The Nash potatoes looked dark (or was it from the lightening in the room?). The only good thing was the turtle cheesecake which I deeply enjoy. I doubt very seriously if I would ever return nor recommend this place for a dinning experience."
A H.,"Halifax, Canada",59,189,707,4.0,6/4/2015,"Everything was tasty here and the service was great. I had the fish tacos with the fish deep fried along with beans and rice. Everything tasted great, I really liked it. The cheesecake was AMAZING! I had the tuxedo cheesecake it was a definite winner for me. I want to go back and try more. Please open a cheesecake factory in Vancouver B.C Canada please! lol"
Guanyu Z.,"Chicago, IL",7,2,1,5.0,7/18/2015,Nice place. Bacon~bacon cheeseburger. I've been there couple times with my girlfriend. It gives me surprise every time
Steve O.,"Ontario, CA",4,8,10,5.0,12/5/2015,"""Atmosphere"" is different here than other Factory restaurants as the decor is like being inside a fluffy cheesecake!  Food is complimentary to the other restaurants though. It is always busy...we've dined here quite a bit and never been quoted less than an hour wait time. Chicken and biscuits and original cheesecake with strawberries to finish is highly recommended!"
Jennifer Y.,"ALLSTON, MA",33,22,,1.0,3/3/2015,"Next time, I better not find a piece of someone's hair in my Strawberry Shortcake  OH wait.. There is NEVER going to be a next time - I'm never coming back to you. You guys are pretty darn lucky that TCF is a natural chain restaurant. Otherwise, business would plummet.  Save yourselves a bad review and have your employees wear bouffant caps, hair nets, or a chef's cap while preparing meals. PLEASE?"
Rodger S.,"Menifee, CA",43,52,99,5.0,6/3/2016,This is definitely the best cheesecake factory I have ever been to. Take a ride up to the top of the Hancock building while you're there...
Akiko I.,"Northwest Side, TX",10,28,99,4.0,9/6/2014,"Very tasty and one thing I like is there is small plate menu with calories stated. All of their portion is gigantic, if you order salad, you'll see the heap of leaves!! It's very good but I have to say it's to share, not to eat all alone. I couldn't finish it up and not managed to get to cheesecake in this cheesecake factory.  Besides, the looks of the restaurant is pretty, resembles to the feeling of being in Disneyland!"
Vivian B.,"Harrison charter Township, MI",0,9,,2.0,12/29/2016,"Very expensive and just okay food. My chicken had 2 bones I found in it, and my pasta was not cooked enough and very hard. They do get the food out in a timely manner though."
Moran S.,"Littleton, CO",96,10,3,5.0,5/24/2016,Fresh and tasty!! Got our food on time and Got amazing service from Alexi :) highly recommend !
Claire L.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",33,81,3,3.0,8/28/2015,"Fun date place with literally every kind of food option possible from burritos to burgers to pasta to steak, so it's great for when everyone is craving something different and neither of you want to compromise.  The service is ok but nothing special, I usually find that the waiters are doing a lot more running around than actually waiting on people and tend to slack on the extra stuff you might request, like more water, extra dressing or more bread. I've also found that if you're having a more ""basic"" dinner (meaning no appetizers or fancy drinks) that they tend to really leave you alone and often leave you with empty water glasses. On the flip side, if you both order a drink when you first meet the waiter, they're never going to stop hounding you.  I do think the food is pretty good and overall love going, just would like to see the service stepped up a little bit. Big tourist place it seems so expect lots of families with younger kids but overall a win."
Maria G.,"Chicago, IL",3,140,172,4.0,3/28/2014,"Our server, Bianca, was GREAT and the food was GREAT as well!!! Thai Lettuce Wraps...ALWAYS excellent, even though chicken pieces were much smaller here than Skokie location. Buffalo Blasts...better here than Skokie location. Jamaican jerk chicken and shrimp with plantains, rice & black beans was SCRUMPTIOUS even though it wasn't really hot. Chile Relleno Cheeesburger with fries was outstanding! After a few glasses of Prosecco...can you  say itis??!!!"
Sarah D.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,,5.0,12/9/2016,"My mom and I just stopped in for some dessert after doing our Holiday shopping, and they did not disappoint!  Their classic cheesecake with strawberry topping and their tiramisu cheesecake are SO GOOD.  This may become a yearly tradition :)"
Sarah R.,"City Park, New Orleans, LA",95,68,186,4.0,6/30/2015,"I came in with my friend and only ordered drinks. My friend and I sat in the bar area at a booth. It was during that awkward transition between lunch and dinner, so they were slow. Our server's name was Ren, I believe. I only remember because he was really awesome! My friend and I are servers, so we tend to connect with servers. Ren was really cool and made our experience a great one! We shared the Georgia Peach. That drink tasted like straight up sorbet. No hint of alcohol. Those drinks are DANGEROUS - in other words, you better order that next time!!! I also got a SkinnyLicious Long Island Iced Tea - it's SkinnyLicious because the splash is of coke zero instead of coke. Pretty straight forward. Tasted good. I would order both again.  My friend got the BBQ salad, which was HUGE, like all of the food portions at Cheesecake Factory. The chicken looked freshly grilled and vegetables looked fresh. I took a bite and would order it if I went again. We also shared a slice of cheesecake - Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. Cheesecake with caramel, PB, butterfingers, Reese's, and an Oreo crust? Get. It. Actually, get everything that we got.  Did I forget to mention the bread that they bring out first? Cause, yeah. That's REALLY good, too. Sourdough and a slightly sweet honey oat wheat something bread. Always a great way to kick off the meal!"
Huimin L.,"Chicago, IL",115,4,,5.0,10/26/2015,"I went this place with my boy friend, and then I fall in love with him and the cake.  This was the first cheesecake factory i ever been in chicago. very good memory. and recommend."
