Dan R.,"Southfield, MI",0,11,2,5.0,6/3/2016,"Best chain ever! No better value for your money! Food and drinks are delicious and large portions. Menu is immensely diverse from Italian to American to Mexican to Asian to breakfast. Cheesecake is great!! Yes this place is crazy busy so wait times can be atrocious. It's because it's the best food for your money and its in downtown Chicago! Service can be hindered but only because it can get so very busy, but worth the wait."
Nada M.,"San Diego, CA",0,50,,1.0,11/26/2016,"One of the busiest branches ever, and thus the worst service.. A server spilled a drink all over my mother's coat and didn't even stop to clean it up, forget about getting us complimentary anything!!"
Jherica L A.,"Chicago, IL",43,9,3,4.0,8/7/2015,I ENJOYED my meal Southern Fried Catfish Meal... it was delicious! We walked in and got a table immediately (1pm on a Thursday) The catfish was meaty and very well compensated. The corn was sweet and buttery. The mashed potatoes chunky and moist. I enjoyed every bite. The margarita was weak but thats ok. Our server Dana was wonderful!! Request her... and shes cute!! Lol...
Nelson M.,"Champaign, IL",246,817,1524,4.0,3/23/2014,"Restaurant review If you like cheesecake, american food, and a busy restaurant then this is the place to visit. Located in the John Hancock building, this place is always super busy with a long wait. The food itself is good, but it is after all a chain restaurant. I can honestly say that I always leave filling full and happy. The prices are slightly above average, but cheaper then a fine dining restaurant. The cheesecake selection is always amazing, but you definitely over pay compared to buying a eli cheesecake from elsewhere. If you come be prepared to wait! Pro: large cheesecake selection, classic american entrees Cons: very long wait time Hidden gem: None"
Colin M.,"Crown Point, IN",2,40,6,3.0,12/17/2014,"Came here with a group of co-workers on Saturday night. My first ever Cheesecake Factory Experience, and only because someone else picked it. Honestly, after reading the ""Eat This Not Thant"" horror stories, I wanted to run screaming from this place. They have arguably the ""Worst Dish In America"" with their Bistro Shrimp pasta, clocking in at over 2200 calories per serving. That's more than a days worth of calories in one gloppy plate of pasta! Que horreur! But, it was either beg off dinner or join the group. So I joined the group. Kudo's on the Skinnylicious Menu. They have a number of selections advertised as less than 590 calories, so I guess that is acceptable. Mostly these selections are salads or fish (or a combination of both).  I had the chopped salad, which contained chicken, apple, corn and avocado and it was pretty good. I didn't trust the calorie count so I didn't finish it. My seatmate to the right had the grilled ahi tuna salad, which he was very pleased with. He literally ate every last morsel of salad on the plate. I personally don't like raw tuna, but he really found the meal excellent. His wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and again, she said she really enjoyed it. I was told that she never likes anything she gets at a restaurant, so this was really a victory for The Cheesecake Factory.  One of my table mates had the appetizer chicken Caesar salad, and it was enormous. We all said, ""This is the appetizer size???"" Honestly, it was entree sized. But good, reportedly.  There were other, acceptable dishes on the table, none so good that they warrant inclusion in this review. The only other thing to note was the size of the desserts. Again, one slice of cheesecake was as big as the entree. Ginormous. And the very slender woman who ordered it dispatched it down her alimentary canal with alacrity. I don't know how a very slender woman can eat 3000 calories worth of food and stay slender. So all in all, I would have to say that the Cheesecake Factory wasn't bad. Service was decent. I don';t think I would drive downtown for a chain restaurant, but if in a similar situation, I would have a lot less trepidation about the menu."
Janae T.,"Chicago, IL",4,17,2,4.0,1/17/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory, not necessarily for their food though. Don't get me wrong, the food is acceptably good but often lacks flavor in my opinion and honestly tastes a little too greasy at times. On the other hand, the drinks at this location(white sangria) was awesome! The service was ok, the waitress seemed a little spaced out, the host who sat is grumbled a few words and the time to get our food was a little long. Overall, it was a decent happy hour experience that I would do again."
Don N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",83,128,561,4.0,8/28/2013,"After walking for hours through Michigan avenue, we decided to reward ourselves with some cheese cake.  They actually have a lot of different dinner entrees but we just wanted the dessert. We tried both the tiramisu and caramel fudge turtle cheese cake. Both were very good but I liked the turtle more Pic:  Pic: "
Lara J.,"Palmetto, FL",26,37,3,5.0,7/7/2015,"You better come hungry!  I'm only slightly ashamed to say I eat at Cheesecake Factory a few times a year.  I love the service, the food and of course, the cheesecake!!!! I've gotten smarter over the years and finally just ordered an appetizer.  This was much better on the wallet and I was still stuffed to the gills.  I was so full, I left again without getting my beloved cheesecake :-(  Sometimes I just have to get dessert. One thing I occasionally do is take the leftovers and give them to someone on the street who is hungry- they seem appreciative.   This time I ordered the Tex Mex Egg Rolls  and they were fabulous!"
Mark C.,"Torrance, CA",129,576,668,2.0,11/27/2013,"Yes, the decor is fabulous, but the food was nowhere near as good as the interior design. I ordered some fettuccine and it felt hard and not cooked well. We all ordered some cheesecake though and for the most part, it was really good. My red velvet cheesecake wasn't as good as the normal cheesecake that one of my peers had."
Alyssa E.,"Brighton, CO",1,6,2,5.0,8/18/2014,"Loved the entire atmosphere and experience. Had to wait for 5-10 min. Was seated in a not-too-loud area, which we enjoyed. Very busy, but still got excellent attention from our waiter. I ordered a burger first, but was told that they were out of that particular kind. Totally fine with me and got an excellent portion of orange chicken. I'm intrigued to see what the big sized portion is since I ordered off the lunch menu.  Ordered cheesecake at the end and we got silverwear in the bag also, which was nice cause were staying in a hotel.  I'd definitely return our next time in Chicago!"
Ahmed M.,"Redwood City, CA",577,5,,5.0,5/15/2016,You know I love to go there. It's a place for families that drive Camrys and goto Disney.
Nina D.,"Rocky River, OH",1,26,,5.0,4/28/2016,"This location by far is the best.. Food was excellent, The server, Derek was excellent.. I loved the way they cooked my Broccoli, yum......"
Jackie G.,"Chicago, IL",13,33,211,3.0,3/29/2015,I love the Thai chicken lettuce meal . ! but I don't really like coming here because the food (pasta) makes me feel terrible after... Like I need a nap right away! And because the food is so heavy I don't ever get any cheese cake
Tasha L.,"Chicago, IL",1,2,1,5.0,10/25/2016,"The happy hour is on point, probably one of the best in the city for food quality/price combo. Everything is good including drinks. I usually get the chicken sliders, tex mex egg rolls and the JW lemonade, yummers!"
Bridget F.,"Wellesley, MA",6,77,32,2.0,11/29/2015,"Bartenders are not able to talk about or describe their menu. Asked about a beer and was completely different! Not attentive during busy hours and can be hard to get a bar seat because of the number of people they let take it up waiting for a table. Food was relatively quickly prepared. Fries cold, boo!! No one checks in. Better restaurant options close by!"
Sondra M.,"Englewood, NJ",259,25,17,2.0,4/16/2015,"The wait was about 40 minutes, which is fine I understand it was a busy night. But then the heat was blasting way too high and I was sweating in the restaurant. Also the waiter gave me the wrong dish, even though I pointed out the one I wanted on the menu to him which was disappointing. Also my key lime cheesecake was frozen when it got to my table as if they pulled it out of the back of the freezer :-( I came to the cheesecake factory for the cheesecake and it wasn't good at all. Not Okay."
Lee O.,"Aberdeen, SD",0,7,2,5.0,12/2/2013,"Located in Mag Mile right beside Hancock Center. Good environment, delicious food and friendly stuff. Nice experience with friends!"
Loretta P.,"Chicago, IL",250,145,1878,4.0,7/30/2013,"Ok. I've been here (and the Oak Brook location) at LEAST 35 times, as it is the go-to restaurant for my large family's occasion dinners. The food is pretty consistently fresh and of good quality, and there is enough variety for everyone to find something that they like. When I've gone alone, with a date, or friends, it has been 90% satisfactory, as well. (I miss you, Avery!) With all of that being said, I went again tonight. I told myself that it was for the Pre-National Cheesecake Day deal (1/2 off dessert slices), but I digress. I am taking the time to be the bazillionth reviewer of The Cheesecake Factory because of water! Yes, you read me correctly. Water is the the reason for this review. I just couldn't take it anymore! The food, the ambience, and the service are all laudable, but the water SUCKS DIRT! I don't understand how a fine dining establishment such as TCF can serve its guests such AWFUL water! I had to squeeze almost an entire lime into my glass in order to make it palatable! About 3 visits prior, I went with a very outspoken friend, who, upon being asked by our server if he needed anything else, said,""Yes. Get rid of this nasty a** water, and bring me some GOOD water! I was a mortified, but the server returned shortly with a glass of perfectly delicious, and, apparently, purified water! He mentioned that he'd gotten it from another part of the restaurant. Hunh?!? You KNOW what I asked for on my next visit, right? Unfortunately, this server must not have known about the secret source, because he brought me a bottle of Fiji and a glass, and tacked on a hefty $5 for the pleasure. It's needless to say that I didn't try that one again, as I don't particularly care to pay so dearly for a glass of water worth drinking. My dearest Cheesecake Factory, can you PLEASE remedy this one major flaw? I would greatly appreciate it, but I won't bother to make empty threats, because I'll be back tomorrow to celebrate National Cheesecake Day properly!"
Ariel T.,"Des Plaines, IL",13,5,2,1.0,9/8/2016,"I didn't even want to give this place 1 star. The staff here isn't helpful in the least, and the management is even worse. My 21st birthday is on Sat the 17th and I have over 20 people coming, we planned on having it here so I called to make a reservation which I was told I couldn't so I asked what else I could do because I have over 20 people coming  to which she was silent so I asked if I could rent the banquet hall for that day and I was told I could but the number on there website didn't work, which I was told after doesn't work anymore so I asked to be transferred over and I was transferred to a ""manager"" who asked what day I wanted to book the banquet hall for and I told her, she then said I could not book that date because it is a Saturday even though I was told I could and I told her this but she refused so I asked if I could reserve a table if I put money down and she said no so I asked to talk to a manager and she told me she was the manager so I asked what she could do for me because that is over 20 people of business which I would think you wouldn't want to lose but I guess not as she told me quite rudely she couldn't do anything because it's policy and I told her they should change that policy to which she said she's sorry I feel that way and that many others have felt that way but the policy has always been that way and will stay that way but we can come and wait anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours to be seated if I like or I can go somewhere else. I won't come back to this location. I've always love Cheesecake Factory and I've never had any problems before at any of there locations but this one is just awful"
Jasmine M.,"Aurora, IL",68,4,,2.0,4/6/2016,"Service was slow, i got my food and then my appetizer when I was halfway done with my food. The seating is small, they should make bigger tables because my things kept falling off the table."
