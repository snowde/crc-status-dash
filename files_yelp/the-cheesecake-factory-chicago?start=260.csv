Rob V.,"Winschoten, The Netherlands",7,13,4,4.0,5/19/2015,"Second time, after the SF location we were at CF. The place is huge and the menu is even bigger. We had an lunch meal which was really great portionwise nothing too much so we had room for an cheesecake. For me it was white chocolate raspberry truffle and although I only had a small meal it still was way too much. So great but so heavy.... It was Just delicious. We Will Be back here and then only the cheesecake. On the downside was the caramel machiatto, that was barely warm enough and I have had much better."
Stephanie A.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,3.0,4/3/2017,"I love the Food here, however the service can be horrible! Case in point, I went to Cheesecake Factory today(4/3/17) around 2 pm during lunch it was not as busy as usual and I placed an order to go at the dessert section. The Indian lady who took my order said it would take about 10-15 minutes to get my food. I waited and after about 30 minutes, during which there was almost no one waiting at the counter I asked the girl at the front desk about the food. I explained to her that I had been waiting for a while and her reply was that she had nothing to do with it and that I should ask the lady from the bakery who wasn't there at the time. I have been here many times and I  knew that it was unusual to wait this long especially when it wasn't as busy. After a few minutes the Indian (lady came back and I asked her about my food (which was already sitting on the shelf) She then packed it for me without any explanation or apology. When  I asked her what took so long as the restaurant wasn't  busy, she rolled her eyes at me and said the kitchen was busy. I told her there was no need to be rude and that an apology would have been nice for keeping me waiting. Again she completely ignored me and proceeded to speak over me to other customers who were waiting. I suggest that management train their staff to provide service that is half as good as their food!"
Bernard T.,"Joliet, IL",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2016,"Slow slow service never waited this long for food! Then I'm paying for parking, don't think I will be back ! And the manager only offered us soup and my food was cold!"
Jada F.,"Chicago, IL",0,31,,1.0,11/5/2015,Staff is insanely rude and the food is mediocre and overpriced. Save your money and try out the many other options of restaurants near by which are worth the wait
Jenna M.,"Iowa City, IA",51,9,33,1.0,2/11/2016,"We were sat by the kitchen, the staff was incredibly loud and distracting.  The waiter was not friendly and there was hair in our food. I felt it was completely over rated and over priced. There are hundreds of better options in Chicago."
Erin L.,"Warren, MI",5,8,6,3.0,9/5/2016,"Ordered lunch speciality. Fish and chips are just ok. Fish meat barely has any flavor. Valet cheese cake is heavy, which is good, but really sweeeeeeeet. Was only able to finish half."
Herschel S.,"Greenbelt, MD",27,164,87,3.0,8/11/2014,Meh. This makes me realize why I don't really like going to chain restaurants. I ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. So I like the sauce but the shrimp tasted from a frozen bag and not fresh. I did not like how the shrimp is also small and to make it appear bigger they just coated it with batter. Service is fine.  The location of this place is great though in attracting customers.
Ann F.,"New York, NY",216,270,516,5.0,4/7/2013,"I am so sad that I am JUST now getting around to reviewing this location.  I would not A) typically review a Cheesecake Factory, or B) rate one 5 stars!  However, this location definitely deserves it!  I had an OUTSTANDING experience here in July 2012! The wait was estimated over an hour, but they said if we could find a spot at the bar, we could seat immediately.  Instead we found two seats at the Barista instead.  The server was the cutest, most honest, and just awesome server ever!  I really wish I could remember her name (although its been three months short of a year!)  She was so attentive and just overall friendly.  She was patient and used tact when customers would come up and complain about the wait (as if it was her fault the restaurant was slow.... she works the coffee!)  She kept my water full too! Expect a long wait, OR sneak into the Barista's bar!"
Channy F.,"Chicago, IL",24,43,20,4.0,1/18/2016,"I love cheesecake! One of my simple and yummy pleasures. I have never been disappointed in my cheesecake on all the years I've been going there. I may not always dine in but I will stop by solely for the cheesecake. With that being said...I understand the popularity of the restaurant. But, I'm so put off by the constant crowding and the apparent disorganization at times. Granted, if it's not enough staff...they aren't at fault. But, many of times I turn away due to the wait time."
Bri A.,"Chicago, IL",190,429,567,2.0,4/3/2013,"This is the place to go if you're from the burbs or a tourist and don't know any better. Oops that's the food snob in me coming out! Ok, Cheesecake Factory isn't bad....but there are so many great places to eat in this city! That being said, my boyfriend's cheesecake craving was out of control so we had to stop in for a slice to go. There were so many delicious looking cakes at the counter and we had  hard time choosing! We went with mango key lime.  The place was busy so I expected to wait a few minutes...but not over 15! The cakes were pre-sliced and ready to go....it wasn't as though ours had to be made! During that time, I noticed two employees standing around, waiting for orders. Yet for some reason, it took them over 15 minutes to get someone to grab a slice and put it in a box. The people in front of us got theirs way before ours.  The cheesecake was awesome, but I wouldn't wait that long or pay almost $8 for a slice again."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  This Cheesecake is fun to eat at because it is located below street level in the Hancock building. It can be very crowded and is a smaller location. Unfortunately, one of their wait staff spilled food all over by suit and shoes when I was there on business and when I attempted to send the manager the cleaning bill, they never responded.  Besides this, the reason this establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Dian W.,"Windsor, Canada",21,122,45,5.0,2/15/2015,lol so many people waiting for seats. I just bought a cheesecake. Looks so good. And the service is fast. Dulce Caremel flavour.
Patrick J.,"Chicago, IL",46,257,345,4.0,11/22/2014,Cody the waiter is the man. He's a real server that's on point and detailed. Great comfort food.
Nicholas L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,1,1.0,5/15/2015,"Bad service. I asked for milk for my coffee, the guy said: use your relative's coffee. I said they need it.  It took him 5 minutes to get me the milk. After returning home I had the stomach runs if you know what I mean. ....I'm disappointed"
Ryan S.,"New Paris, IN",0,40,48,5.0,8/6/2016,The Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint!  My family loved the food and our service was great. We started with the fried Macaroni and Cheese balls... They might have led to the biggest smiles my kids made all weekend!  Alex did a great job. Definitely will be back.
Kim A.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,,1.0,9/11/2016,"This place was my ""go to"" whenever I had visitors from out of town or a place to celebrate, it's going downhill.  The service was great and prompt but the entrees were so much smaller (not the lunch portion). The mixed drinks were in a tiny glass filled with ice and $11.00 each, no price listed on the menu, also after getting the bill most of the dishes we ordered were $2-3.00 more than listed on the menu. I don't mind paying for a meal out especially if it's great food and service, but don't cheat me on the bill. I won't go back to the CF again, none of them."
Andrew P.,"Kalamazoo, MI",26,22,4,5.0,2/10/2016,Moderately priced with huge portions. Tons and tons of choices. Food was really great! Beer menu is slightly limited :/  desserts are also great!
Rebecca P.,"Chicago, IL",4,53,25,1.0,10/14/2015,Tried again for my boyfriend's birthday in June. Once again the cake was not ready and they were out of toppings. Maybe I'll just order online or give up next year.
Chris T.,"Chicago, IL",341,320,958,3.0,12/11/2012,"Mmm cheesecake. You really can't go wrong with the cheesecakes here, they're pretty awesome. The White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle cheesecake, for example, is as good as it sounds!  The problem is when you venture for anything beyond cheesecake that you should prepare for disappointment. The food is average. I think any place with a gigantic menu will always end up being just ok - jack of all trades and master of none as they say. I do like the avocado eggrolls though. Also this location is always super busy, it's tourist central, so be prepared to wait."
Julie C.,"Palatine, IL",0,3,,1.0,2/20/2016,"Service was awful. We arrived ""mid-shift"" of wait staff which may have been part of the problem. Never received complimentary bread. Appetizers took forever to arrive. Then another 20+ min wait for entrees which arrived cold. Two of three entrees were sent back because they were inedible cold. Took another 20+ mins for replacements. They comp'ed two cheesecake slices. Whoopee. Will never go back."
