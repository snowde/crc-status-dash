Britany S.,"Brampton, Canada",153,227,699,2.0,6/4/2014,I'm going to keep this review short as most people have visited cheesecake factory before. I usually do not have complaints with the cheesecake factory but this occasion was the exception. We ordered to corn tamales as usually because they are so good it has to be a sin. I regret not ordering the red velvet cheesecake because I I did nto like my past at all. The sauce was water and thin and did not coat the past so I felt like I was eating dry season pasta. I would never order that meal again. We asked for extra sauce but that dish is just not a winner. We sat in these booths in the back and my friends seat was wobbly if that makes any sense. So anytime the person in the booth behind her would move or get up she would feel it. Our waiter was ridiculously slow and we had to remind him about everything (even utensils). All I can say is the corn tamales never disappoint.
Justin D.,"Strathroy, Canada",0,7,,4.0,8/14/2016,My girlfriend and I both chose two different slices when we stopped in.  Both were dense and both were delicious.  The service was friendly and quick. Took us about 10 minutes to get our order and then a cozy place outside.
Julie A.,"Dalzell, IL",44,8,,1.0,8/22/2015,Terrible wait time. Was told it would be 45 minutes and hour and a half hostess told us 10 more minutes and then sat a table of 5 who just came in. When I questioned it she said they were sitting outside. I would have taken first available. Hostess had no clue!
Liz P.,"Clawson, MI",618,1174,2387,4.0,6/7/2013,"It may be touristy, and yes, the last time I was here was about 3 years ago, but it's still Cheesecake Factory and thus DELISH!! I always get the Pasta da Vinci and then choose a cheesecake slice from their ginormous cheesecake menu.  Last time I was here we only had a short wait, I believe, and we had a big party, about 6-8 people. We were in Chicago for a few days for fun (I live in the Detroit area) after graduating college.  The Cheesecake Factory has a HUGE menu and they have something for everyone, I'm sure! My favorite is that pasta dish but they have interesting appetizers too - I've had their SW egg rolls before as well as their samosas, at a different CF location."
BD P.,"Chicago, IL",459,72,74,1.0,4/7/2014,"Review by Becky: Decided to try the Cheesecake Factory out with my boyfriend because I had a $25 gift card. This is not a place we would usually get lunch or dinner at. What a horrible mistake! The worst burger experience of my life. Also the decor is hideous!  We came in around 1:45pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes to be seated.  After being seated we placed our order.  We had a lot of time to look over the menu when we were waiting 10 years for a table. We both ordered the Factory burger - I requested my burger well done with double tomato and no onions.  My boyfriend requested his burger medium rare and with only cheese. About 30 minutes later our server comes back with our food and plops it down and runs off.   Just by looking at my burger I could tell it was the wrong order.  Instead of the Factory burger I received the Smokehouse BBQ Burger (WTF I HATE BBQ SAUCE! HATE IT! The smell makes me sick)  My boyfriend's burger was fine and started to eat.   I tried to flag down a waiter or a staff member and there were none to be seen.  Finally 15 minutes later I was able to grab a bus boy and get him to grab our server.  After waiting another 10 minutes our server finally shows back up and I explain to him that I have the wrong burger and he admits he wrote the wrong thing down on our ticket. Wtf?  How do you mix up a factory burger and a BBQ burger?  He offered to bring me another burger and I refused because I wasn't going to wait another 30 minutes to get a burger when my boyfriend had been done eating for 20 minutes!   The server barely apologized.  I asked for the burger to be taken off our bill as I couldn't eat it.  He said he couldn't do that but could give me a piece of cheesecake for free.  Ummm wtf?  Are you serious?  You messed up my order, delivered a burger I couldn't eat but you are still going to charge me full price for it?  Hello! I'm starving!!!!!!!! The server brought us a tiny piece of cheesecake after we paid.   Thank god we didn't have to pay anything out of pocket for the crap the Cheesecake Factory serves. Service was horrible and non existent.  I didn't get to eat anything for lunch.  Also I tried the cheesecake when we got home and spit it right out.  It was the most disgusting cheesecake I have ever had in my entire life."
Malleana R.,"Chicago, IL",41,34,30,2.0,7/20/2015,"I had to drop the stars down this one time. Our waiter, Nathan, last night was not friendly and it was not received well since we were a large crowd who waited 2 hours and change to be seated and had 3 birthdays. It took forever to get seated which is understandable since we had a large crowd. However when we got called we had to wait another 20-30 minutes for them to get our table ready. Followed by three meals that were incorrect / under cooked. The waiter dropped bread on our table and expected us to still eat it . I ordered the kale salad and the Diane steak which was delicious ( Thank God ). But I just feel like the service could have been much better than it was."
Taffy T.,"Atlanta, GA",2,3,4,4.0,12/21/2014,"Waited 30 minutes, the restaurant is full of people, waiter can be cery busy. But The cheesecakes are great. Love godiva!"
Anissa G.,"Nappanee, IN",0,5,,5.0,8/7/2016,"Made impromptu trip into the city from Indiana with my son to experience  Tilt at the John Hancock bldg & then to dinner.  I see other reviewers complain about long waits, loud restaurant etc.. Well duh!  It's a huge city. The entire city is loud & busy. Anyway, yes, it took some time to get a table but our waiter had a great personality, he came with a smile, engaged us, our food was delicious, and we had a great time & good food for a spur of the moment decision to drive 2 hours for dinner was a good plan for the evening. I only hope I can get ahold of someone there & arrange to get the photographs that I bought that my boy left at the table."
Shervene D.,"Chicago, IL",1,23,3,4.0,2/2/2016,"Delicious food, and the prices aren't bad. The fried calamari is GREAT!"
Ashley C.,"Henderson, NV",59,282,167,5.0,10/3/2015,"Hate the parking, but it is chicago lol. Love this place, great food, good service. I think this location is the only one who knows how to cook. Props to the head chef! I have had many bad experience at other locations. Go here, its worth it :-)"
Ebony C.,"Charlotte, NC",92,134,77,4.0,7/31/2014,This was my go to place for Strawberry Cheesecake  every Saturday afternoon whenever I was in the downtown Chicago area.  I've only dined here once with my parents one Saturday afternoon and we had a good experience. The only disappointment was they didn't have my mom's sugar free cheesecake! :( I would definitely return the next time I'm in the area.
Maya O.,"Chicago, IL",74,16,33,5.0,11/15/2015,"Love this place so much! It's always been one of my favorites! I usually order the 4 cheese pasta dish, but I decided to go with the eggplant Parmesan this time and it was delicious! Their cheesecakes are also pretty delicious"
Dominique M.,"DePaul, Chicago, IL",287,137,239,4.0,9/27/2015,Surprised there was such a long wait at 9pm on a weeknight. That place is huge. Food was pretty average. Cheesecake was yummy. Walked out of there stuffed and even had leftovers. Not sure I would go again besides the fact that it's the only place open late in the area.
Shelli D.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,1.0,4/5/2015,"My table was dirty and it smelled, so I was moved to the table next to mine, which also smelled. I had a great waiter and the food was good. However, I watched the busboy wipe the table next to mine after the patrons left, and then understood why the tables stink. The busboy uses the same towel to wipe the tables, and then puts the towel in his apron pocket. He then puts down napkins and silverware on the table. That was gross, and for sure, unsanitary. Watching this caused me to stop eating and I would not order dessert.  I did not like the setting in the first place, and having to smell an unclean table while I ate, did not go over well with me. I do not plan to go back."
Kristen S.,"Novato, CA",8,8,1,1.0,7/18/2015,I came here craving something dessert  -- absolutely the worst cheesecake I've ever had. It was completely covered with whipped cream and sickeningly sweet.
Jessica C.,"South Bend, IN",15,17,,5.0,12/7/2015,"We came into Chicago for a little get away, and made a stop here. It was about 9pm local time, and we didn't think they'd be busy - we were wrong! Even though they were crazy inside and out, they seemed to have a system in place for getting people in and out while having an enjoyable experience. We waited about 40 mins, but the food was worth every minute. The staff was very kind as well. I would highly recommend for large parties or a night out."
Hansaem C.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,5.0,1/11/2016,"I went to the cheesecake factory on last Saturday night to eat dinner. It's my first time since I came to Chicago. I really want to recommand this restaurant because it has so nice staffs, yummy menus and good location. I ate a pasta, it tastes really good. I want to go this restaurant again!"
Ashley B.,"Urbana, IL",475,597,743,4.0,1/31/2011,"I have mixed feelings about this place. One, I used to love it before I actually lived in Chicago, which says a lot, it's a tourist trap for sure. Secondly, its HUGE, and yet, understaffed? I'm not really sure, but every time I come here I feel terrible for the servers, who look like they have way too many tables to deal with. That being said, I think I've been offered free cheesecake every time for that very reason. I will say the menu here is pretty extensive, great HUGE salads (I'm talking like, a whole head of lettuce in one serving) as well as steaks, tons of appetizers, single plates, sandwiches, pastas, pizza, and of course their many kinds of cheesecakes. Overall the quality of food is pretty good, you get huge servings, and if you come with picky eaters, you can all still find something you'll like. An all around good place."
Rachel L.,"Hammond, IN",1,28,30,5.0,4/20/2014,The Cajun chipotle chicken was delicious. The asparagus was so fresh! The lunch portion was huge and filling! #thanksCF
Hao Z.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,4.0,10/25/2015,Love Steak Dian. The original cheese cake also very good
