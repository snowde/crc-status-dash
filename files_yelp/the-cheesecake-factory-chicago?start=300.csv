Kevin G.,"Plymouth, MI",49,277,60,4.0,7/12/2014,"Just had lunch here. Appetizer kale and quinoa salad was huge. Lunch pizza and salad combination was also too much. Both were worth the price. Johnard was our server and was such a delight. Very friendly and outgoing. Another fantastic face for a company. As far as a go to place in my book, this is a destination spot when in Chicago."
Martin R.,"Uppsala, Sweden",2,2,,2.0,3/28/2015,"Poor service, overrated food, very cold - too much aircondition. But the cheesecake was alright."
MT W.,"Seattle, WA",143,205,644,2.0,8/30/2015,"Situated next to all the hotels and shops of Chicago downtown, along the Magnificent Mile, can't be anything more central. Open all day long, till 12:30 am on Saturdays and Sundays, and always very very packed. We went there twice but never to sit and eat inside, but to place and get to go order. Customers are standing and waiting to be seated in line. They get pagers to know when their table is finally ready. And it can take 15 or even 30 minutes. To my mind the place is not the most delicious or prestigious or anything to spend so much time waiting. Time waiting for to go food is enormous too. And I heard the clients were not very happy with the service. Of course if it's called the ""Cheesecake Factory"" - their cheesecakes are good. But as for the food on the menu, it's absolutely ordinary and there is nothing to droll that much about, it's a chain restaurant and besides in some other their locations the service is much better. And the prices are a bit above the average there to me for the quality of food they offer. There are tons of different and more interesting and delicious places around there to visit. So if you're coming back late from some event, you can drop by and order a bite to go. May be after 10 pm it's quieter there, but before - better choose something else not to waste your precious time."
Tammy B.,"Oak Forest, IL",28,7,2,5.0,7/1/2016,"Decided to have a nice lunch before heading back to the 'burbs.  There was a 15 minute wait for outdoor seating so we opted to dine in with no wait!  The waitress was very accommodating, food was fabulous. We all had the lunch portions, and seriously they would have been adequate for dinner!  The herb encrusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus was perfect. The fettuccine was delicious as well. We will definitely be back."
Drew T.,"Mascoutah, IL",0,7,,4.0,12/15/2015,Angel hair pasta with shrimp was good. Louisiana chicken pasta the pasta was good but the chicken was bland and dry.  Peppermint cheese cake was amazing.
Kelly A.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,1,1.0,6/3/2016,"Terrible service - not worth the food. Pretty hard to screw up the ""take-out"" process. Waited on hold for over 15mins. Called back to speak with a manager - waited for another 10mins and never got through. Totally unacceptable. Then, For a salad and fries waited over the time they quoted. James offered me ""free cheesecake"" when I arrived to express concern with the lost service standards. Terrible service met with a terrible solution. Sad to see such bad habits touted as acceptable in a Mag Mile operation."
Brad P.,"Red Wing, MN",0,98,11,2.0,11/17/2016,"I've been here several times, it's usually great. Unfortunately tonight was review night and my server blew it. It was late (9:30 pm) and not busy at all.  Yet the hostess put me, a party of one, in a small cramped area surrounded on all sides by larger, louder parties. It was uncomfortably loud in that 20 sq feet, but I could hear every word of these 10 conversations because the rest of the restaurant was largely empty.  I had to wait about 15 minutes before anyone stopped by. After I got my beverage it was another five minutes to place my order. The food was good but I had to ask for things that weren't coming out. Seems the late hour was a factor, but then I'm not the one who advertises meal service until 11:30. They could tell me it's coming in a minute, or make me find the server to inquire. Personally I'd rather if they just told me, seems simpler. When I was ready to leave I had to wait about ten minutes before my server stopped again so I could settle up. To his credit he got the tab out and ran my card lickity split, but I was surprised dessert was not mentioned. I had planned to take something with me but forgot all about it, with all the time I spent there trying to see if I could spot my server.  I think it was an unusual night and will be back again I'm sure."
Len M.,"Traverse City, MI",1,5,,3.0,5/3/2015,The menu is huge. Lots of items to choose from. Standard fare not superb..from what I tasted. Cheesecake is FAB. Waiter wasn't pleasant..almost like he didn't like his job. Hmmm.
Suzanne A.,"Chicago, IL",214,16,101,2.0,8/1/2014,I go to this place for one thing...CHEESECAKE. it's what qualifies them for 2 stars! They should get 4 stars of that's all they did.  Their menu for food is super big and the quality is hit or miss. Drinks are consistently weak. I don't enjoy the hefty prices and sub par food.  I do however love the cheesecake!  Godiva chocolate  Adam's Peanut butter cheesecake
Efi Z.,"Urbana, IL",51,150,,3.0,9/18/2014,Always a long wait with a beeping machine. Too over-rated by tourists and media.  To me it's not that different from olive garden or applebees. but for two people it usually costs us about $70 dollars. Cheesecake is not that impressive either.
Zachary H.,"Lompoc, CA",67,265,102,2.0,2/28/2014,"Never been too impressed with Cheesecake Factory this is no exception.  It was the closest place and we didn't want to go too far after traveling all day, probably a bad choice.   The menu has always seemed way too big for anything to be done particularly well.  factory is a good way of describing this place.  Mass produced, assembly line quality.   Bar was decent though and service was alright.  No good reason to go here."
Brenda A.,"Raleigh, NC",0,99,,2.0,5/14/2016,Went in late evening for carry out - a simple hamburger and fries.  After waiting 35 minutes for the order I took the 3 min walk to the hotel only to realize the food was cold. The fries weren't even worth eating - just terrible. I picked Cheesecake Factory because it's usually a safe bet. Not this time around.  Waste of $15.
Farida Y.,"Noble Square, Chicago, IL",18,16,11,4.0,4/5/2014,"It's a huge place!!! You need to wait before you'll sit, but it's very quick procedure . I came to try the famous cheesecake , I don't remember the name , as usual , lol, I prefer to ask the staff about their specials and bests. The cheesecake was just amazing !!!!! The best in my life and a big slice, good to share for two people ."
Craig E.,"Eastpointe, MI",0,15,,4.0,4/30/2015,"Dined here during a recent weekend trip with my best friend. She had visited other TCF locations before, but it was my first time. The wait was long to be seated, but it was worth it. The food was delicious and the cheesecake we ordered to go was even better. The staff was friendly and attentive. Seemed like a popular place for birthdays as at least 3 groups were sang to during our visit. I am still thinking about that slice of Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake..."
Daniel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,303,142,5.0,7/20/2015,Cool space. Had soft chicken tacos which was a nice light lunch. Ate at the bar. Bartender was nice and attentive to me. I haven't eaten at one of these spots in quite a while. Extensive menu.
Soyoung S.,"Chicago, IL",259,62,104,5.0,11/10/2012,"I've been here maybe a dozen times now, and It's steadily become one of my favorite places to go for a casual lunch/dinner! :3 The first couple times were huge misses for me, the pastas have always been really under-cooked and I hate complaining about food to the waiter, but my noodles were so hard I couldn't swallow them! :( And a couple of their other dishes have been really disappointing to me But I'd still find myself going back, either because my friends wanted to go, or it was the closest restaurant nearby. And I feel like since i've been giving it chances upon chances, and ordering different things every time, i've finally found the dishes that I like! :D I highly recommend the Steak Diane, and the Chicken Madiera, they are really really tasty and delicious :3  The smoothies are also to die for, and they are really cute with their tea and offer you many different choices! Although the strawberry shortcake is highly disappointing, the shortcake was really hard for some reason, but they do give you a very large portion!  Now that I've found my go-to dishes, my new goal is to tackle the cheesecake list..hehe"
Dana M.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,4,5.0,11/11/2014,"I'm writing this review to let people know about my experience and to advise them to choose the Cheesecake Factory for a nice time. As a usual consumer, I am interested in well-cooked dishes, high quality of food, unusual atmosphere and relatively acceptable prices. I would recommend you the Cheesecake factory, as it includes all of those options. To begin with, I want to highlight a wide range of dishes and their unusual big portions.  The Cheesecake Factory has his own extraordinary atmosphere. It creates a special mood among guests. I was really impressed by a unique décor, which makes you feel like you are in a fairytale: the nicely subdued light, pleasant music playing on the background, white-dressed waiters.  It is very clear from these observations that the Cheesecake Factory has all options to serve guests best and exceed their expectations. If you are interested in high service, appetizing food, unusual and out-of-the way atmosphere, so the Cheesecake Factory is a great alternative for you. When I came to the Cheesecake Factory, I liked immediately the service of this place. The stuff find to you a table and they present a menu. Before to take the order, they bring to you a glass of water and than I ordered pasta. A big plate of pasta Fettuccine Alfredo, that could be divided among 3 persons, surprised me. It is a common fact that the bigger the size of portions the bigger the price. The Cheesecake Factory is an exception to this rule. In addition, the dishes are not just large they are extremely tasty. It is an indisputable advantage that makes consumers happy.  The Cheesecake Factory has the most various and delicious range of cheesecake flavors such as: Oreo, Pumpkin, Red Velvet Cake and so on. I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake, which was so delicious and looked really beautiful. Deserts make people happy and the Cheesecake Factory knows how to do it best. The Cheesecake Factory is considered as the most popular place to have good time with family and friends, celebrate birthdays, family events."
G. R.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,,1.0,10/26/2014,I came to hopefully enjoy a delicious sandwich instead I was greeted with rudeness and indifference I simply asked where's the bathroom? Seems like some of the employees here too busy to be nice It will be a while before I come back.
Lilian P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,46,64,4.0,7/25/2014,"Good bar service with friendly bartenders who are very attentive and pleasant. For all Dave Matthews fans, they stock Dreaming Tree Wine."
Cristi S.,"Kansas City, MO",145,161,106,5.0,5/13/2014,"Had such amazing service at this location I couldn't believe it. It was a last minute decision on a busy Saturday night to come here for a drink and appetizer. We had 5 people and the host was just about to write our name down for a 1.5 hour wait when the most wonderful little waitress came over and said ""hi I have immediate seating for 5 in the cafe"". We'll take it! She was fantastic! Then our waitress for the evening was also just wonderful. She gave us recommendations, never rushed us, and when a bigger table opened up after 10 minutes she moved us quickly over to it. What service! The cafe part has a more limited menu than the restaurant. We had the lettuce wraps and I had the sangria. Yum yum! Everything was delicious. Bravo to the staff at the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago!"
