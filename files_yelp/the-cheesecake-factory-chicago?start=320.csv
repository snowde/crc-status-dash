Erica D.,"Chicago, IL",51,66,65,3.0,11/11/2013,"With so many other choices to go to in this area, I do not understand why people decide to come here. There are Cheesecake Factories all over the country, and if you're going to be downtown Chicago, why not eat a  restaurant unique to the area?  The last time I went here was with some family from out of town, and they really wanted to eat here for some reason .... Anyways, went here around lunch time and the tables smelled really weird, the smell of old dishrag water. It was pretty gross. The prices of the food are pretty pricy for the quality. Maybe I'm just biased, but the Cheesecake Factory is nothing special.  But if anything, I do enjoy their cheesecakes. That's about it."
Kevin E.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,95,20,3.0,6/7/2014,"I came here for brunch with a friend. Service was rather slow. Despite having a plethora of tables, we had to wait for the waitress to clock in before we could be seated. Sure... okay. We were seated in a booth, and I instantly noticed that our lamp was amazingly dusty. Like, I was scared if someone ran past our table, dust would fall into our food. I ordered a red sangria, because I love sangria and I want to try it everywhere. Their sangria was OVERLY sweet. I know it's the cheesecake factory, but there's no reason my sangria should taste like a cherry jolly rancher. My friend got the chicken caesar salad. It was a generous portion, and we ended up sharing. I got the skinny chicken pasta, which was pretty good."
Kristine N.,"Denver, CO",506,1041,58,4.0,1/4/2014,"This place is huge and beautiful but it's very popular on the weekends. Just a tip: the Cheesecake cafe upstairs serves the same food but from a limited menu. Since the main restaurants menu is a little ridiculous anyway, this ""top 75"" menu is perfect. Service is great and portions are HUGE. I ordered the chicken Madeira which is so so so good. Chicken breasts topped with asparagus, mozzerella, and some mushroom sauce. It comes with mashed potatoes and it is so yum. My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and it was ok. Good flavors, very spicy. A little dry for pasta though, definitely needed more sauce. Overall a great experience for a chain."
Brenda H.,"Homewood, IL",0,4,,1.0,12/11/2014,"Went to cheesecake factory downtown last night. Food was horrible, waitress was great, manager was worse than the food!"
Annette C.,"Valencia, CA",25,66,61,5.0,4/26/2014,"Sunday brunch was a great experience, not a long wait for us, we sat at the bar. The food was beyond delicious. We ordered the French Toast Napoleon and Monte Cristo....nom nom nom AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!! The service was also great, very friendly staff and the food recommendations was spot on fantastic!"
Dawn S.,"Lexington, KY",2,2,,4.0,10/16/2014,"To start off it was busy, but only had to wait 15 minutes with just my brother and I. We definitely got called before that time limit so the wait for a table wasn't bad.  Very impressed and happily stuffed from all the food. I really liked how there was a small menu for little meals, salads, drinks, etc. that said under a certain caloric number. I got the spinach artichoke dip to start and wasn't the best I've ever had, but was very delicious. I then got the americana cheeseburger which was very meaty and hit the spot for my craving. And..to Top it all off I got their notoriously delicious red velvet cake cheesecake. Was planning on taking a picture, but was too busy admiring and devouring the taste of the rich and sweet bites!"
Lucia G.,"Tinley Park, IL",32,8,1,2.0,10/14/2015,"I usually frequent your Orland park or oak Brook location I was at your place in Chicago and wow.... Very disappointed, I'll start with our fried came to the table 6 mins. Before our meal camel wth???? Waitress did not bring me lemons for my water like I asked and the wait for a seat was 45 mins not 10 like I was told."
Brooke O.,"West Town, Chicago, IL",439,100,35,5.0,3/27/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory in the Hancock tends to be a destination for many suburban families when they come to the city.  The huge portions, large menu, and of course cheesecake draws them in.  The quirky décor keeps them interested while they're there.  Cheesecake recently came up with a healthier menu which is nice.  The regular menu tends to be really heavy - partly because of the huge portions.  They do have a large selection of dishes that they will prepare as lunch portions which are still big but much more manageable."
Israel H.,"New York, NY",522,572,165,4.0,7/26/2012,"This place is in the bottom of the Hancock building. It seems to always be very crowded. Being that I always ate at the bar,  I didn't have to be concerned with the lines. I ate at the bar and always had prompt and great service.  My expectations have always been met here."
Tan L.,"Chicago, IL",0,52,,5.0,7/8/2015,"Great location in the city.  Went shopping at Water Tower and this always is the best place for dinner when I'm w my daughter.  The staff is educated about food allergies so I never worry.  People are always courteous and food is great and reasonably priced.  The only problem is, they need to expand this place.  It s always so packed even on a weeknight"
Raphael R.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",17,13,2,2.0,2/26/2014,"For years, we have celebrated most birthdays or milestones at a Cheescake Factory and this time was no exception. Celebrating my 50th birthday and wondering where to celebrate, I was lucky I spotted this location, which also happened to be close to the hotel we were staying at.  The first thing that really struck me was that we were able to get a table right away and this being a Friday night!  The waitress seemed to either be new or totally overwhelmed because she kept forgetting things and had to keep calling her back over and over. Food was typical Chessecake Factory fare, so no real surprises here.  While having dinner, an employee carrying a container with ice dropped it close to our table making a whole mess... When it came time for dessert, my wife asked for a slice of cheesecake and she expected to have it with a birthday candle like the so many other times in other locations but to her surprise, they were out of candles. Very weird and disappointing. We paid too much for a bad experience. And it was so disappointing it was on such a big occasion."
Cynthia P.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,36,23,2.0,2/12/2015,"We been here before when we visited chicago , we got great customer service and the food was great. Today we came back with our new born son, after I told the hostes that we did not want to sit in front of the window near the entry door guess where she put us, exactly there, had to get the manager to move us, horrible!!!! I thought this was a family friendly restaurant ."
Danielle S.,"Schaumburg, IL",13,1305,73,4.0,9/17/2011,"I have been to 4 Cheesecake Factories in my lifetime, and this location is what started it all. The downtown Cheesecake Factory is bar far the prettiest of them all. The water fall outside is so pretty, and the inside makes you feel like you are in a scene from Alice in Wonderland.  The menu is GINORMOUS. The cheesecake is unbelievable (so is the lemoncello cake!!), and the farfalle pasta...I have to get it every time. Ther service is great - they are always willing to help you pick something on the menu to eat if you can't decide.  It's very, very busy, so be prepared for a wait. I don't think I have ever seen that place dead. And for a good reason - it's delicious!"
Yadi R.,"Chicago, IL",1,23,2,1.0,3/27/2016,"Never had a bad service or a request denied (never crazy) ate at this location with my son for Easter lunch. On our way out i decided to stop at the cheesecake counter for a slice to take home. I asked for a slice to be cut in half and was told i would get a fork and knife?? I stated again would like it to be sliced she turned to a girl behind her to advise of my request. Left my son at the counter while i made a call. After our name was called i notice my slice was not cut as requested. When i mentioned this to GUADALUPE (name on receipt) she states ""well we cannot cut it"" with an ""oh well attitude"", WTF!! GUADALUPE led me to believe SHE was. Why tell me that you can and LIE?  Im all about customer service and she totally sucked! Last time i go to this location."
Lar P.,"Kailua, HI",4,29,5,5.0,6/28/2015,"Great place, food was very good and service excellent. Menu can be a little overwhelming but definitely has something for everyone. Everyone in our group of six was very happy with their food.  When you go, ask for Katie,a redhead, her service was excellent; well trained. I think she's from Hawaii."
Kristen D.,"Chicago, IL",88,348,129,3.0,4/30/2012,"Came to the Chicago location to celebrate our birthdays with a girlfriend. Service was SLOW at first, but after our 2nd waiter took over, it was better.  Strawberry martini - awesome. Strong! 4 Cheese Pasta - delicious Vanilla Bean cheesecake - not too rich (great after a very rich dinner) and perfect. Our waiter heard that it was our birthdays and brought out the rest of the male waiters to sing happy birthday to us. Candles and cheesecake with men singing us happy birthday was a great topper to the night!"
Sylvana S.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,4.0,2/16/2015,"I went here on a Monday evening. I always opt for the chopped salad. It always come to me the same way...delicious! I had a glass of Reisling and end the evening with the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. You are doing your body an injustice if you have not had this cheesecake.  One slice is too big, but you better believe it  will  be finished on day two!"
Diane S.,"Chicago, IL",135,87,19,4.0,10/10/2013,"I was taken here yesterday for a post-birthday dinner by my best friend.  We got there pretty early so we were seated promptly. We really only had to wait about 2 minutes for a booth, and we got a window seat so that we could people watch.  I ordered the Filet Large but subbed  in mashed potatoes and added a side of tempura asparagus, I had coffee, and tiramisu cheesecake.  My friend had the Herb-Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus and the peanut butter chocolate cheesecake.  We were stuffed!  Everything was really delicious, the gravy on my mashed potatoes had mushrooms in it so I think it was the madeira mushroom sauce that normally comes with the Steak Diane (which I would have ordered - maybe next time).  My only beef (pun intended) is that there was gristle on my tenderloin, which I just can't forgive for a 29.95 price tag.  And what was supposed to be medium rare was medium, boo.  But it's a chain, and I refused to bitch about anything.  I was just happy to be eating because I saved up all day and was very hungry.  So that's where that point went. AAAAAAAND anyway, it was all great.  I love the posh nouveau decor.  So so much.  What a cool looking place.  I would definitely go back. Service was great, too.  She was very cheerful and kind.   Plus I had excellent company!  :)"
Susan H.,"Sevierville, TN",0,48,125,3.0,7/6/2015,"It is a chain that's all I can say. The cheesecake is always delicious and hard to resist so we didn't. We tried the red velvet, Chris's outrageous, & carrot cake cheesecake and they were all mouth watering good! We ordered skinny salmon with asparagus which was actually very good. Also had the skinny chicken pasta and it was okay. We felt like choosing skinny rationalized eating cheesecake.....its r that what everyone would do?!?!? Lol we love their cheesecake!"
Brad S.,"Davenport, WA",3,10,2,2.0,7/1/2015,"In town for a conference. Ate at the Seattle Cheese and Factory many times and enjoyed it. This location not so much. Place was packed with a 60 min wait for dinner at 8:30 pm. Called for reservations, no reservations taken after 4pm. Not sure why during dinner you wouldn't take reservations!?! Place was packed. Our table was still covered in plates when we arrived. Had to wait next to people eating while they cleared the table. 5 of us got crammed into a small corner booth. Not the best seating. Now with that being said, I had the Mushroom Swiss burger which was very yummy. Friend had the Mac and Cheese burger which she also found very delicious. Decorations were entertaining. Would visit again at an off time if there is one of those."
