Vineet S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1748,948,1532,3.0,7/22/2011,"Considering the location(close proximity to Michigan ave and John Hancock), it is always buzzing with people.Specially on weekends there are always huge wait list.Reserving a table before arriving makes sense. They have a long menu list. Our waiter did not arrive even after we were seated for 20 minutes.Tried the Chicken pizza, which wasn't great.The banana cream cheesecake was nice."
Andii W.,"New York, NY",23,57,6,4.0,12/12/2014,My brother and I went here a couple weekends ago for the first time in a couple years. It is always so cute and their bathrooms are sooo clean thank god. My food was amazing and on time. I loved our waitress. I forgot her name but she wore the cutest square framed glasses. We really got to enjoy our dinner and talk comfortably.  And the music was like it came from my own hitlist. Double thumbs up for that.  We are going back tonight :-)
Caitlyn P.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2016,"We've gotten takeout from this specific location a couple times before, with no issues. However, over the weekend, our experience with this Cheesecake Factory was almost unbearable. My boyfriend and I both ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle mayo... Everything looked ok, nothing special about the presentation, but the moment we both bit into the sandwich, it was like biting into a piece of chicken coated in soggy breading. And had no flavor whatsoever. Literally tasted like fried, soggy buttery bread. Horrible. Not even the ""spicy"" mayo did anything to help it. Literally took one bite and threw it in the garbage. My son ordered the macaroni and cheese burger. When I looked at the presentation, it had to be one of the most unappealing things I've seen in a long time. The fried macaroni should be a nice golden color sitting on top of the burger, but instead it looked like a rubbery gray-brown ball. My son could barely stomach one bite. My other son had the kid chicken tenders; they were just as bad as our chicken sandwiches. The only redeeming factor about the meal was our appetizer of the fried avocado egg rolls. But even those were mediocre. My experience picking up the food was also unpleasant. Already waited in a line for close to 10 minutes and when I got to the register and told her my name and that I was here to pickup my order, she looked around almost confused, then found a receipt and told me ""she couldn't ring me up because she didn't take the order."" She proceeded to call the other waiter to come to the register which took about another 6-7 minutes. Both girls at the register were rude, and unapologetic. I will never be taking my business here again. Horrible food and customer service."
Naveen N.,"Midtown, Detroit, MI",7,348,,4.0,5/30/2015,"Large quantity of extremely delicious and obviously unhealthy food. Top off the meal with an even better tasting, and likely unhealthier, piece of cheesecake"
Giovanni H.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,5/4/2016,f this place!!! it needs to be cleaned up!!! feels like iced coffee was spilt all over and left there.  chuck e. cheese has a better feel to it!!!
Amber C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",5,16,48,4.0,9/20/2011,"I have been known to fantasize about this place. So much so that we make sure to stop in whenever we're in Chicago. Part of the reason could be because of the fun, Alice in Wonderland-esque atmosphere, complete with a lovely waterfall outside. Add a gigantic menu and friendly service and I'm a happy girl. I have been with groups of 10+ people, all sharing dishes, and have yet to try something I didn't enjoy. The portions are large enough that you'll be stuffed, yet will still have plenty of leftovers. Their Crispy Artichoke Hearts are a personal favorite (the lemon-garlic dip is addictive) and you can't go wrong with finishing your meal (assuming you have any room left) with a slice of the ridiculously delicious and decadent Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. The downside is that this location can get pretty packed, so you may want to plan your visit. The lines get quite long, although I haven't had much trouble when dining close to opening time."
John P.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,1,1.0,7/5/2014,"I often go in there to get cheesecake after work ""to go"". It's annoying that no matter what it always is a 10 minute wait... For some reason they never give you your slice of cheesecake after you pay... I've been there numerous amounts of time that there has been no one there, the cashier takes the cash and then someone else has to get it... It doesn't make sense. So I decided to call and place an order this way I didn't have to wait ... An associate by the name of Sam kept me on hold for 20 minutes!!! Good is good ... Service sucks"
Sera S.,"Cheshire, CT",0,15,,5.0,8/17/2015,Definitely one of the most convenient and amazing places to eat in Chicago. Food is great as always. The service is neither fast nor slow which makes you enjoy your break between the meals. I suggest the pasta choices that include shrimp. The sizes of the meals are big so if you also want to eat a cheesecake you might want to share the main course. I think you should definitely go there if you've never been to one of the Cheesecakes Factories.
Lindsey A.,"Chicago, IL",71,329,24,2.0,7/24/2011,"I've lived in Chicago for six years and have never once had the desire to endure all that is the Cheesecake Factory. But, my partner having received a gift cert for the chain, and us already being downtown on Saturday evening, we ventured in with patience.  It's not that the Factory has bad food or bad drinks or bad service or bad anything, really (it's actually all mediocre). It's just that it is exactly what its title says - a factory. You wait 45 minutes with 1,000 tourists to grab a seat in a restaurant that easily serves hundreds. Your waiter or waitress will immediately saunter up and say they're really busy (because, well, they are) while you pour over a 10-plus-page menu of everything from tacos to pastas to pizzas to sandwiches.  When you finally decide on an over-priced dish, your waiter will ask if you need anything. You'll suggest water and it'll take 10 minutes to come. Servers, hostesses, bussers and other members of this food manufacturing facility will sashay by - busy as bees. Your food will arrive semi-quickly, a portion so huge it might as well be stamped with ""America!"" on it. If the factory cut their portion sizes in half, they could also cut their prices in half, which for the actual food itself, would make sense, because it's nothing we haven't had before.  My chicken and biscuits were indeed chicken and biscuity, just as they should be, but my partner's salmon packed much more flavor (I wanted comfort food, though, and it did meet that expectation). Service? Meh. Our guy was nice enough - when he was around. We ended up with a hybrid approach to being waited on - a woman who filled in when our guy kept forgetting things (water, an explanation of the menu, etc.)  The factory is exactly as I expected it to be, nothing more and nothing less. They should consider slowing down a little - I suspect that 45-minute wait is standard busy or not - and cutting portions (nearly every table I spied had take-away bags) and besides, shouldn't we all just be here for the cheesecake, anyway?"
Felicia H.,"Madison, WI",1,1,,1.0,6/4/2014,"the service is so bad. The waiter brought me the wrong dish, I was about to begin, the waiter took it back without saying a word.  So angry. Won't come back and dine in again."
Ndidi B.,"Chicago, IL",1,19,5,4.0,12/27/2013,"Last night was my first time ever dining at The Cheesecake Factory. I had read a few Yelp reviews prior to and the mixed feedback had me skeptical. But my boyfriend had received a CF giftcard from his job, so we decided to have a date night here. I knew the restaurant would be packed because several Yelpers coined this place as a ""tourist trap"", so I decided to call ahead to get an estimate of the wait time. The lady said it was a half hour wait and kindly informed me that I could not put my name on the list over the phone when I tried to. My boyfriend ended up arriving before me, so our table was ready by the time I got there. I asked him how long he had been there and he said it had only been a 15 minute wait.  We were escorted to our table and given menus. I have seen some pretty large 'multi-paged' menus in my lifetime, but never had I seen a menu with ads! I chuckled to myself as it became clear why this place was labeled a tourist trap. As we were perusing, a female server named Liz came over and introduced herself. She asked if she could start us off with drinks and I asked her for two ice waters and two cups of hot water. [The hot water was for the silverware, which several Yelpers had pointed out would be filthy and to my suprise, were correct.] A few minutes after she left, a male server named Ryan came over and introduced himself. He then proceeded to ask if he could get us any drinks. Suprised, I told him we had been greeted already. He then explained that the previous server had been confused about whether or not we were her table, and apologized for the confusion. After recieving our drinks, being served warm bread and Ryan patiently answering all of my boyfriend's redundant questions about salads, we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio while my boyfriend ended up going with the Ceasar. Our food arrived in a timely manner, long enough for me to discover that each bathroom stall has its own personal sink and us to eat all of our bread, and looked absolutely delicious. Once we began to dig in, we both were pleasantly suprised. His Ceasar was generously portioned and well-dressed, while my pasta had my tastebuds rejoicing. I begged him to taste my dish and he, being born in Italy and a Italian food connoisseur, was also impressed. The overall evening was better than I expected, and my complaints were few and far apart. Sadly, it was my night to pick up the bill and last night's budget did not allow for me to try an cheesecake. Lol. In conclusion, I realize that The Cheesecake Factory is not a five-star restaurant, as should anyone else considering eating here. The food was tasty and that is all that matters. P.S. I took off a star because of the silverware. I'm a slight germaphobe, and icky silverware makes me feel uncomfortable. The managers of this restaurant really need to pay more attention to this issue, because I'm sure that is some sort of health code violation! :c"
Amanda F.,"Chicago, IL",46,61,,4.0,8/12/2013,"Yes, in a city full of amazing dive bars, amazing local eats and world famous restaurants I chose Cheesecake Factory on the busiest Chicago street with more tourists than anyone can count...And I'm proud of it. I love Cheesecake Factory, of any place I've ever been in Chicago, their lettuce wraps are hands down my favorite. After letting out my inner child at Navy Pier all day, I wanted lettuce wraps and I was up for the long jaunt down Michigan Ave on a Sunday. Upon getting there, as always it was packed, but only a 20 minute wait. This location under the Hancock building is pretty large and they get people in and out in a timely manner. I am a fan of their wheat bread, I can't get enough of that stuff! The staff is super friendly and chipper, which I think is even more impressive when you work somewhere that is always so populated. The staff is really always up on their A-Game. My Thai lettuce wraps were amazing, and huge! It's been probably 8 or 9 months since I've had them and they were delicious! I strongly recommend these! However, I honestly have never had anything on the menu I don't like. I was close to getting a new chipolte pasta, but I thought my body would be happier with the lettuce wraps.  I opted out from getting dessert this time, but I've also never had a piece of cheesecake there that wasn't phenomenal!"
Katie J.,"Wilmette, IL",0,3,,4.0,7/31/2015,"We were downtown for a day and had lunch with the fam. Great food, but really long wait and the hostess could have been better. Overall good but the old orchard location is my favorite."
Heather W.,"Bentonville, AR",321,590,520,4.0,9/15/2011,"What can I say? It's a Cheesecake Factory. New menu seems to be the same as the old one to me. Cheesecake Factory really isn't anything special, but I like the vibe here and the service is always good. It's an easy go-to for lunch when you want something 'safe'.  Snag a seat outside, if you can, when the weather is nice"
Hank A.,"Battle Creek, MI",0,23,,5.0,4/17/2016,"Spicy Cashew Chicken is great.  The cheese cakes are great.  The decor is very unique, I don't know how to classify the decor but I like it.  Last time we were there the staff was a bit off their game but usually the service is very good even when really busy.  Be warned it can be very busy but this usually doesn't impact wait times for seating or food.  Recommended."
Gheryl H.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,3.0,8/19/2015,"Hmm, how can I explain? Along side from long waiting & poor service, it's ok. I came here with my little brother and sister, we waited at least 20 min before we were given bread & straws for our water. Good food though, the waiting almost makes it completely bad...."
Rocelle H.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,9,,5.0,7/9/2014,"Went here for an anniversary dinner. Our server, Lauren D. never failed to check up on us every chance she got. She was always smiling and that is always a plus! :) My boyfriend had the lemon-herb chicken and I had the grilled porkchop - all delicious!!! We also had the Godiva Cheesecake which was also really good.  Overall, amazing food and top notch service by Lauren! Thank you! :)"
Megan S.,"Chicago, IL",7,100,,4.0,10/29/2013,Definitely an easy place to meet people for drinks if everyone works in the city. I typically meet friends for drinks here because its such a convenient location.  The only thing I have trouble with is deciding what to eat each time I go.
Andrea T.,"Park Ridge, IL",2,38,11,5.0,2/16/2014,"I was here last night Feb 15, and I was very pleased! Nick started with us, very informative, great smile, pleasant attitude, and was very composed in the middle of a huge dinner rush. He definitely possesses a very valuable professional work ethic where I can see him in management. He also informed us later that Tinos would take over, where as before he had his hands full. That shows great communication amongst the co workers and I applaud that! Tinos also was wonderful, very warm welcoming attitude, great smile. Even the bussers wished us to enjoy our meals which was refreshing.  The food was fantastic, two thumbs up. I had the Sun-dried tomato pasta with a red and white sauce mix (with chicken). Perfect combination of sweet and savory. My husband had the jambalaya pasta which he loved. He said ""This is the first time I am eating from someone else's opinion and it was very good! He was on point with this!"" I don't have to say much about the cheesecake, we all know it's good! Only thing negative is I do not recommend sitting by the window, there was a strong cold draft I had to wear my winter coat and scarf the entire time with my husbands jacket on my legs. Since everything was so great, it still made a pleasant evening for my husband and I which is why I think this review makes an honorable 5-star rating."
Amy M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",99,453,407,3.0,1/8/2012,Holy busy Batman!  We wanted to eat dinner here but being a group of 10 on a Saturday night with a packed house and a line out the door.....I decided to just get some cheesecake to go. Can't go wrong there!! :) The tiramisu was splendid. Really terrific blend of tiramisu & cheesecake. The white chocolate macadamia was a little too sweet for me but still good.  Saved the Red Velvet for my Mom's Christmas Birthday...it was so good and my Mom really loved it. I was thrilled to have a special cake for my special Mom for sure!
