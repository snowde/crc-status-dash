Ronald L.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,5/14/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has what I consider to be an insult to customers.I was informed by the manager of the Michigan Avenue restaurant they accept reservations for all days of the week except for Sunday. However, Sunday, happened to be the day of my problem. I stated that we reside in the Hancock Building and wanted to come to have lunch. It was 11:40 in the morning and would like to come down @12:30. We were told that the restaurant had room then but we could not have a reservation. I informed them if my money was only good six days a week, they would never see us again. Thank you,"
Nicole M.,"Fenton, MO",0,4,,1.0,5/5/2014,"This is only a review for this particular location, not Cheesecake Factory in general. We went for an early dinner Saturday evening & literally had the worst service I've ever had. I'll break it down - Drinks - 1st round took forever. Ordered 2nd round & they never came.  Bread - Were asked if we wanted some & which kind. We said yes & one of each. It never came. We requested it again when our food arrived & they only brought 1 kind. When we asked for more, we were told they were out but would bring us some when a new batch was finished. It never came. Entrees - the Pasta di Vinci was tasteless & my steak medallions were served with a butter knife. Nice. We left without getting our 2nd round of drinks & noticed that the people next to us left before their cheesecake arrived. They abandoned cheesecake - that is how bad the service was. I definitely will not go back to this location.  I'm totally bummed I wasted my gift card on this location :("
Hitesh N.,"Chicago, IL",24,2,,1.0,6/16/2015,"One of the worst experiences at this location. Been to many other locations of the same chain, if i thought they were average, this experience makes them look good. The bartender didn't pay any attention to us for the first 10 minutes. We ordered a bottle of wine, never came to pour a single glass of wine. Presentation of the food was terrible, i have had food at other locations, but this one did not amuse me. The water was not served at all. The staff was more interested in watching TV,keeping up on Basketball scores than paying attention to their job."
Nicole C.,"Washington, DC",268,105,63,4.0,6/21/2013,"My boyfriend and I were leaving close by bar and were very hungry. I had been to this particular Cheesecake Factory before with positive results so I convinced him to go. Side Note: If you're shopping on Michigan Ave, this is a great place to wrap up your day.  When we checked in the hostess said their would be a 30 minute wait, so we tried the bar area and found a table top right away.  Service - Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. While we waited for food, a manager came over to apologize for the wait and I'm pretty sure was about to offer us a free appetizer, but we declined and just asked for more bread. What's funny about this is we didn't think at all the food was delayed. About 1/2 minutes later our food came out piping hot.  Food - The last few times I came here I order a delicious salmon dish (so good I figured out how to make it at home), bi this day I opted for the chicken enchiladas. Good Choice. It was a different taste than I was expecting from other times I've had enchiladas, but it was a good different. Very earthy and savory flavor. I finished every morsel. We also order cheesecake to go - and of course that was wonderful as well. Atmosphere - Set up like most Cheescake factories. A little dark here though, but once your eyes adjust, it's okay. It was a bit noisy in the bar area, so steer clear of there is you want quiet time.  So...the bathroom. Pretty clean, but it has complete stalls (toilet and sink) all together behind a door you can lock. So I and others had to wait a long time for a stall. It almost looked like a mini Flash Mob doing the bathroom dance. Hahaha. Just don't wait until the last minute to go to the  bathroom. You might be uncomfortable with the wait."
Robert A.,"Chicago, IL",10,109,13,2.0,2/17/2016,"I brought my mom in for dinner, and this was her first time at the cheesecake factory. Unfortunately our experience was very lack luster. Our waiter was friendly and gave us good service however the quality of the food was bad. The bread that was brought to our table was cold and hard.  I ordered a Pineapple Mojito, and it was made poorly, it mirrored coconut water, sugar, and a few mints.  I sent it back and ordered a Mai Thai, which was also made incorrectly. My mother ordered a Mai Thai which was perfect , mines tasted like a completely different drink.  I requested that it be remade, I am assuming the bartender finally put a little passion and focus into the drink, because the third drink was great.  I typically order the chicken madeira but decided match it up (Factory Combination) with the shrimp scampi. My mother ordered the Southern fried catfish, which was overcooked. My chicken maderia was prefect as usual, however the shrimp scampi was not freshly made. It was obviously prep and left to sit, the shrimp texture was soggy and room temperature.  I am really disappointed  in the lack of attention that went into the food and drinks. I did not expect to receive fast food quality food.  We ordered two more Mai Thai  and finished our appetizer of buffalo wings, it was the only item that was made correctly. My mom made it clear she would not return, the food will not have me returning anytime soon. Not sure what happened with them."
Rose C.,"Farmington, MI",0,4,,1.0,11/29/2015,"Very disappointed in the service. We were there thanksgiving weekend . Sunday 11/29 got seated at 1 , ordered our food , my husband and daughter got their meal at 1:30. On the other hand me and my daughter are waiting for our food. The server kept saying its on its way, about 1:50 my daughter who was waiting for her salad , she asked the waiiter if she can get her food , her brought it, meanwhile I'm still waiting for mine, for gods sake all I ordered was salad with salmon. He said the kitchen was busy. Still waiting for the salmon to cook. My husband and my daughter finished their food. I got my food about 2:15 at that time I lost my appetite . The salad and salmon came , the fresh vegetable salad was all lettuce very few vegetables and a very small piece of salmon. Very, very disappointed , will never eat there again. Not worth the money or the service."
Meagan L.,"Munster, IN",16,8,,5.0,8/12/2014,One of my favorite places to eat. The food is amazing and the portions are huge! Every time I eat here I have leftovers to eat the next day. The servers are awesome too! Always willing to make recommendations and help you with the menu and very attentive. And of course the best cheesecake ever!!
Joelle G.,"New York, NY",271,730,69,4.0,10/23/2011,"This is the most mammoth Cheesecake Factory location I have seen. Whoa... I don't care if it's a chain, I LOVE eating here.  The servers were very nice  at this location & the food amazing as usual. Free refills on the lemonade, yeah :) Oh yeah, you bet your bottom dollar I'll be back."
Bobby L.,"Chicago, IL",0,28,11,2.0,4/9/2015,"It was my first time there and the ambiance was classy and dark.It was a long wait and pretty crowded. I ordered gumbo,and it wasn't to great it lacked flavor.It was also a tad pricey.I guess they only specialize in cheesecake so if you like cheesecake go for it. Overall its nothing to go write to mom about."
Kim K.,"Trafford, PA",0,20,,2.0,3/14/2016,"Don't order TOGO! They told us 30 mins when we ordered, showed up to pic up the food and waited 57 mins. Got back to the hotel, opened up the bags and got 1/2 of the wrong food. When I called to see what we could do the nasty hostess said there was nothing they could do bc they were ""just too busy"". I asked to talk to a manager and thankfully he said he would get us the right food. Went back to pick up the correct food and still waited 10 mins. I was very thankful for that but still crazy that everyone else who got the correct food the first time was ice cold. Portions were big and tasted well but would've been better warm"
Charlene H.,"Chicago, IL",1,59,,3.0,2/14/2014,Service was average to poor.  We waited to be seated.  No one ever came so we as to inquire.  The manager came but her response was less than good.  She said she would follow up.   The food was ample in quantity and good.   The server was okay. We had a gift card otherwise I wouldn't dine here.
Thongsy S.,"Chicago, IL",167,223,117,3.0,7/25/2014,"This is strictly based on my takeout order.  I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp.  It was good but nothing to write home about and for $18, not really worth it to me.  It had exactly 3 pieces of shrimp!  And don't get me started on the calories.  A full order is about 1800 calorie - yikes!  However, the takeout process was easy and they even provided complimentary bread as well."
Ash H.,"Dallas, TX",126,146,306,3.0,10/25/2013,"Cheesecake Factory has always been my favorite restaurant but this particular location has disappointed me. I came here for lunch on Mother's Day and we waited an hour for a table ,which it wasn't a big deal ,I understand we're in Chicago and it's Mother's Day. What let me down was my main course, I had the salmon with angel hair and the salmon was cold and the pasta was cold and hard, I totally lost my appetite and I didn't bother to ask them for another one because I know they're busy. I really hope this was just an one time only incident."
Firat A.,"Victoria, Canada",10,18,7,5.0,6/24/2012,"I saw a restaurant front that looked so wacky when I was walking down the street. Looked inside but did not see anybody, last second I saw a sign that said to continue down stairs for the host.  Once downstairs it was a fairly large and busy place. Being from out os country, I did not even realize it was a chain at first. It defiantly has a unique design.  Once we got our menus, we were surprised with the amount of selections, their menu is a booklet!  We ordered some appetizers and martinis and they were great. Our main dish were also great! We were very happy with the experience and the prices were quite cheap. Later I learned it was a chain, which kind of took away from uniqueness...."
Kassie D.,"Slough, United Kingdom",0,10,28,4.0,5/13/2014,"Great service, very attentive. But it does get pretty busy in there! Food was good - standard Cheesecake Factoryness"
Racquel D.,"Houston, TX",78,262,676,4.0,11/13/2011,"Man, this location is so much better than the ones in Houston! The staff here are always really nice and attentive.  This place can get packed since it's right on the Magnificent Mile, so be prepared to wait a while to get seated. But both times I've been here, ""a while"" was like 10 minutes, so it's probably hit or miss with wait time.  I didn't order a mojito, but my friend did and it was really good. And I am not a mojito person.  Sometimes the menu itself is overwhelming, but I usually like whatever I order. Clam chowder is always good. And the pastas are always good, too. And according to my friend, the red velvet cheesecake was awesome."
Chris W.,"Louisville, KY",116,426,1703,4.0,9/7/2013,"Super Super busy location, and huge.  Great outdoor patio area to sit, so much hussle and bussle.  They did a great job and the wait was only about 30 mins."
Ernie O.,"Missouri City, TX",20,30,7,5.0,3/16/2015,"Very enjoyable. Food was great, desert amazing. Great service and excellent decor."
Jerry V.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,5.0,4/27/2015,The Cheesecake Factory is great place for lunch or dinner. There entrées are very good which is in cheeseburgers are very good as well. Let's not get into the selection of cheesecakes! It's a bit more pricey compared to American style restaurant.
R T.,"Milwaukee, WI",20,25,33,5.0,1/9/2014,Came here for my birthday in NOVEMBER with my girlfriend The atmosphere is relaxed and they sing happy birthday to you when requested. Well i seen a couple people have the birthday song sang to them. Awhile later 4 or 5 workers came out of nowhere to sing happy birthday to me. LOL And other patrons in the restaurant sang along too...
