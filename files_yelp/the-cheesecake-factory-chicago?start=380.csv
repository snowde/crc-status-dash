Kristen O.,"Forest Park, IL",36,175,469,3.0,6/17/2011,"I'll start by saying nothing was terrible with my meal. The food was good, our waitress was friendly and nice, service was a little slow, but they were pretty busy, and the meal as a whole was nice. The slider appetizer was surprisingly fresh and delicious. My popcorn shrimp appetizer (I got for a meal) was not your run of the mill frozen shrimp and had some better breading than most. It also came with cocktail sauce and aioli.  Honestly, the $11.50  top-shelf Long Island Iced Tea, that didn't get me drunk enough is probably what's keeping me from forking over 4 stars."
Danielle M.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,59,21,1.0,8/19/2015,"I have been to this particular location many times and have never experienced what happened today.  The hosts at the main desk said our wait for a table for 2 two would be 20 minutes at around 7:30 PM today (Thursday).  We waited and waited and killed some time in the Best Buy right above it.  An HOUR later we finally go into the restaurant and ask what is happening, they reply with oh sorry it'll be less than 10 minutes.  So we stand nearby the host desk for maybe 5 minutes or so and our buzzer goes off.  We handed in our buzzer and half a dozen others were trying to do so too by waving them in the air like a damn concert or something.  They then printed out a ton of slips with party names on them and the corresponding number of menus into piles on the desk in no particular order and random hosts start calling out parties in no particular order. We stood there staring at our ticket for probably 10 minutes...so over an hour and 15 minutes went by JUST TO GET SEATED."
Dion T.,"Ypsilanti, MI",1,50,,2.0,12/29/2012,"Good: - Red Velvet Cheesecake; it's excellent. - Godiva Cheesecake; it's INCREDIBLE. - Macaroni Balls; delicious by themselves but even better with the accompanying sauce. - Stuffed Chicken Tortilla; initially thought I'd need some heat/spice, but all the pieces work very, very well, this was really tasty. Not so good: - Strawberry Lemonade; you're pretty much just drinking a glass of sugar. Just a hint of lemonade for me. - The wait, part 1; they told us an hour, gave us a buzzer that went off in an hour, we turned it in and were told to wait in a line for our name to be called, which was an additional 30 minutes.... - The wait, part 2; .....because they lost track of people's names, including ours. - The wait, part 3; A manager put in an appetizer to appease us....but didn't tell our waiter. The appetizer was delivered to the wrong table while the waiter was heading to the kitchen to check on it. Since we were already waiting, we added a second appetizer to the mix. A waiter-helper brought the original appetizer (!!!) plus an appetizer...that...we...didn't...order. True story. - The bill; We were told by our waiter the the manager wouldn't take anything off. We told him we need to talk to him/her. We explained our experience to the manager that came, and the bill was cut in half. Then the waiter said that THIS manager was the one he was hoping to get initially, not the one that first denied our claim. So there's a rogue manager roaming the premises and pleasing the customers...ok. - For the love of God, I would love to actually see the person sitting next to me. Mood lighting is one thing, nap lighting is another. Irritatingly dark in parts of the restaurant. Final thought: The food is, and has always been, excellent for us. The experience has always been frustrating. Our next visit(s) will be for cheesecake only, to-go. 5 stars for food, minus 3 for the experience. If you're a patient person, you can endure, it's not a life damaging experience. If you expect ultimate and exacting accountability from your restaurant, think twice about this place."
Anna H.,"Chicago, IL",20,55,27,5.0,2/13/2011,"LOVE this restaurant! Hubby & I went here recently for Valentine's Day dinner without a reservation. They took our name and seated us right away (less than 7  minutes).  I absolutely RECOMMEND the fried MAC and CHEESE. . . an indulgence starter plate of 4 HUGE fried mac and cheese balls with a red sauce that is so delicious! I ordered the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi that came on a bed of tomatoes, capers, & mashed potatoes! I LOVE THIS DISH! It is light and healthy, but so flavorful!!  And of course, their cheesecake is delicious! =)"
Lisa L.,"Chicago, IL",5,146,19,4.0,2/17/2015,"If you have a large group of people and everyone wants something different then this is the place to go.  Their signature lettuce wraps are excellent (pricey).  This one is right below the John Hancock Building and gets very crowded and the seats are VERY close to one another and loud.  Not a great place for a quiet date unless you get a booth in the back.  As for the cheesecakes, there are so many to choose from and I have never had a bad one yet.  The lemon meringue is a recent one I've tried and if you like lemon it's fabulous.  There is a little bit of coconut in it.  Definitely worth a try but beware it is pricey."
Jay I.,"New York, NY",229,666,155,4.0,2/18/2013,"Being not a big fan of franchise restaurants (meaning I have low expectation for them), this place surprised me a little bit.  We tried some chicken and steak with madeira sauce, which was quite good.  Their cheesecake is always above average so you can dwell on that too."
Maria Cristina G.,"Milan, Italy",23,14,13,4.0,2/13/2014,"Best Cheesecake i've ever had. Simply delicious and heavenly. The place looks like an Alice in Wonderland location. There's a great choice of flavors and cakes, I had a slice of Dark Chocolate and Raspberry cheesecake and I highly recommend it. Only two cons: really expensive and the guy at the counter, who was doing nothing, saw that I called him to be served and didn't help me. He just seemed not to care at all, he was a little rude. But the cake was definitely worth it!"
Justin M.,"Forsyth, IL",17,11,67,4.0,4/7/2013,"All I can say is, great place. The food is top quality and fits in perfectly with the various other cuisines Chicago has to offer, the employees are friendly and consistently check with tables to assure dining experiences are superb, and the wide variety of cheesecake gives one the chance to experiment different flavors onto the palette. The ambiance can be a little dark in some areas(Bar room), but, other than that, it's ALWAYS worth going to, especially if you're a tourist in Chicago."
Annie H.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,7/3/2015,"Wow.  This place is terrible on so many levels.  I've been to other Cheesecake Factories and have always had a positive experiences but this place is just so poorly run... if they were in any other location than Michigan Ave. they would surely be out of business.  I checked in with the hostess and was told it would be 15 minutes for outside seating.  So we waited for 15... 20... 30 minutes.  Finally I went up to the hostess stand and asked (nicely) how much longer it would be.  The hostess said ""Oh you're next on the list.  Should be 10 minutes.""  So we waited for 10... 15... 20 minutes.  So I went up to the hostess stand and said ""Look, we were told 15 minutes and it's been 45 minutes.""  And the hostess said, ""Yeah I know.""  And walked away.  Here's a little tip for you sweetheart... if you're going to be a little C U Next Tuesday then you should probably work in a different industry than the HOSPITALITY industry.   Anyway.  We finally get seated and I ask to speak to a manager.  He comes over 10 minutes later and says, ""I'm sorry that happened!  I'll get you started off right!""  Meanwhile, our waiter is nowhere to be found, we have no waters, and no bread.  Waiter finally shows up with a plate of some weird, fried greasy avocado egg rolls (which we didn't ask for and didn't want).  Not exactly a great way to get us ""started off right.""  Food finally comes (we never got bread and had to ask 3 times for water) and it was also greasy and gross.  We ended up being comped for the nasty avocado rolls, which we never asked for and didn't want.  So gross food, bad service, incredibly rude host staff, and clueless manager.  Stay away."
Martin P.,"Machesney Park, IL",11,18,3,3.0,3/19/2015,One of my favorite restaurants in the city. It's worth the wait even though it feels forever at times. The time to get food to table is not bad at all. The service is good and for the most part the waitresses are attentive. I usually go to Schaumburg location because it's not as busy. But the chicago location has a better feel to it. I gave 3 out of 5 stars for over all taste on food.
Vydia G.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,1.0,8/24/2015,"Went there Saturday afternoon around 12:30 or so with my cousin as we got massages to relax and hang out for the day - absolutely horrible waitress/service! unfortunately i didnt get her name as i was so mad after waiting about 20 minutes for our drinks and we could barely hear her as it was so loud in there, she wouldn't even try to hear us or speak louder. Since we wanted to try a little bit of everything we ordered 4 apps and she literally scoffed at us and said, ""woah!""...as if to food shame us for ordering 2 too many apps for just us two ppl! SO MAD! she never once asked if we needed anything in the meantime, she then took the order of the table next to us and the faces/looks she was giving this mother/daughter was horrible! she took her time in talking and getting food for the other tables in her section but not us. our food came in 2 cycles which was fine however, she never once came to check on us and then when she noticed we weren't eating anymore, she just took our dishes away and we had to flag her down to give us the bill. Worst $55 spent ever; will never come back to this location or any other - food/service has really gone down over the years!"
JR R.,"Millville, NJ",0,20,,4.0,3/17/2014,"Bar: The bartenders were excellent. Very attentive to their customer and quick with the order, delivery, and check. They were still very friendly and inviting without making you feel rushed."
Dawn K.,"Fond du Lac, WI",0,4,,4.0,3/17/2014,"Wouldn't be a trip to Chicago March 7th , without a stop here for dinner. We arrived on a Friday and had the fish specials for lent. Great food ! So filling we passed on the cheesecake!  Mahi-Mahi crusted with Macadamia Nuts dish-FAB! Fish was done to the correct done-ness. Not to fishy. Rice and veggies was a nice touch.  We arrived at 5:10pm and only had a 5 minute wait. Bread was so filling and our waiter was so attentive to our needs.  I ordered a mojito..the mint was so fresh.  Wonderful time, pleasant experience. Great!"
Julia S.,"Portland, OR",43,157,2,3.0,6/29/2013,"Here's the thing about the Cheesecake Factory- the best possible thing to eat there is going to be the cheesecake. My husband and I had breakfast/brunch a few days ago at the Cheesecake Factory. The place wasn't too crowded, which was a plus. We got a seat right away and our server was at our table within minutes. We were really craving eggs, so we were thrilled to see that these guys serve breakfast ALL day. First, we requested some well needed coffee. It was delicious! My husband ordered a cheese and sausage omelette. I ordered something called the ""energy breakfast,"" egg whites with spinach, tomatoes and toast. Both meals were decent.  We took some slices of cheesecake to go (I took the low carb cheesecake while my husband ordered the peanut butter cake cheesecake). They were very tasty (even the low carb one)!  My conclusion is that this place isn't known for its food, rather, its all about the cheesecake here. Don't be disappointed if the food isn't phenomenal. But be prepared for some great cheesecake!"
Jorge M.,"Cicero, IL",0,12,1,1.0,12/11/2014,"The Worst service , the waitress comes and the first thing she ask was are you ready to order ,  what in hell is wrong with servers now , no how are you, no welcome, no specials, no smile, the worst experience in donwntown, chicago."
Angie M.,"Morton Grove, IL",368,942,17,4.0,7/18/2012,"Haters gonna hate. ""It's a chain!"" ""Big portions doesn't equal big flavor!"" ""It's too crowded!"" ""No reservations!"" ""Too loud!"" For crying out loud... It's the freaking Cheesecake Factory in the Hancock building.  Were you expecting anything else? There are, however, a few tips to getting in, getting sat, getting a good meal and getting on with your life. First, NEVER come here on a weekend.  Just don't do it.  I know you don't want to sit next to a sweaty dude from Kenosha wearing jorts and a fanny pack any more than I do.  And if you come to CF on a weeknight, you just may avoid the influx of crazy tourists.  I mean, you'll still probably see some Kentucky-fried bangs and Reeboks, but probably less on a Wednesday evening than a Saturday, right?  You'll also avoid a fairly hefty wait.  Seating tends to come more quickly on the weeknights. Second, order the raspberry martini.  Just do it and don't worry about the stigma of drinking a pink drink.  My dad is the manliest man ever and he tucked into that pink cocktail like it was his job.  They're good.  Lethally good. Third, eat the Navajo sandwich.  Calorie-bomb?  YES.  Flavor-bomb?  YESSSSSS.  Grilled chicken, shredded lettuce, lush tomatoes, red onion and a bit of mayo on fry bread is just heaven.  You can do a double spin class tomorrow, ok? Finally, just get a piece of cheesecake.  If you ask your server nicely, they'll even cut it in half for you and serve it on separate plates.  That means double whipped cream, ya'll!  I'm partial to the fresh strawberry. Sometimes you have to eat downtown.  Cheesecake Factory can certainly be a more than acceptable place to make it happen."
Susanna C.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,7,4.0,3/9/2015,"I always wanted to try out The Cheesecake Factory here in Chicago so I went there last weekend. It was really crowded and we had to wait for about 30 minutes to be placed. I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory and wanted to try the shrimp with angel hair because I was nevery disappointed by seafood at The Cheesecake Factory. I'm so sad that I have to say that my food was little cold but besides this, I liked it. The tasted was good and they added enough shrimp to the spaghetti. But next time I will choose something else because I really don't like cold food. Since it was saturday night and the restaurant was literally exploding I understand that the kitchen must have been really busy that night."
Nicholas I.,"Orlando, FL",32,56,127,4.0,8/5/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory works out perfectly for us, and obviously for everyone else, as well. It's at the end of Michigan Ave. right under the Hancock Tower (which is cool!) So, if you are done with your shopping excursion, you can come straight here. The layout and decorations of this TCF were interesting and well put together. It seemed clean, if memory serves correctly, and comfortable.  The waiters/waitresses were nice and attentive. And that's saying a lot seeing as how crazy busy this place got! Now, onto the food. Which can make or completely break a restaurant... and I'm happy to report that it made this place. Portions were HUGE, everything was cooked to order, hot, and tasty. My whole family enjoyed their meal. And it was nice to take a rest after walking up and down Michigan Ave. several times over... tiring to say the least!  This is a nice meet up location, resting spot, and eating place. If you are around the M Ave. area and want a nice dinner, drop by."
Kori M.,"Atlanta, GA",127,388,5,3.0,10/26/2010,"Let me start by saying I need for everyone to get over this whole ""chain restaurants are the devil"" attitude. Yes it's a chain. Get over it. Oh and get over yourself too. If you were that much of a foodie you would have never stepped foot in this place to begin with. Okay! So now that we've got that out of the way on to the review... :-) So, I've been to Cheesecake plenty of times. Overall, it's not a bad spot. I think the ambiance is cute...in a weird but whimsical sort of way (Yes I said whimsical).  The menu is overwhelming and it's hit or miss. Once you find something you like you should probably just stick with it every time. Keeps the disappointment down you know? Last time I was in this place I had the most excellent server. She was amazing. Every recommendation she made was spot on. Oh and they have a new pineapple upside down cheesecake that is TO DIE FOR. I rarely eat their cheesecake but this one is definitely worth a trip back. Overall, this place isn't bad. It's super crowded and touristy so I'd say stick to going during off peak hours. Also, once you find that meal you love...stick with it. Oh and leave your food snob friends at home. They'll only ruin the experience for you."
Andrew B.,"Irvine, CA",17,151,1,4.0,8/21/2012,"Guys, it's the Cheesecake Factory. Most people know exactly what to expect when they go here. And that's EXACTLY why we go here. I branched out this time. I ordered Renee's Special for lunch (1/2 sandwich, soup, salad), and it was more than enough food (literally--I didn't finish). Everything was great, as usual. Mom ordered a perfectly cooked omelette. Yes, it's a chain. But it's the best damn chain restaurant I've ever been to."
