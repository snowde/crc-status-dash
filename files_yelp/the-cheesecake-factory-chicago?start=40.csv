Josef M.,"New York, NY",18,2,2,1.0,9/9/2017,Ordered through Doordash Delivery a sandwich and a bowl of ice cream. Online it shows three scoops with whipped cream. Received one and a half little scoops and no whipped cream. Also the sandwich was cold. ($30 delivery and tip). Very disappointing!
Mickey M.,"Elgin, SC",16,60,78,4.0,7/25/2017,Not a bad wait and well worth it.  Try the Chicken Madeira.  I had it without the cheese.  Superb!
Randy H.,"Chicago, IL",33,15,1,4.0,8/14/2017,"Look, I'm going to be honest here: I do not eat at Cheesecake Factory, because their food is just too much, and I don't want to get diabetes. However, I must say that the bar is simply amazing. I've never seen bartenders work more efficiently and without breaks. The drinks may be a bit pricey, but they're not unreasonable given the location, and I promise you won't ever have something as wonderful as their strawberry martini. Just last week I drank over $100 worth of them in one sitting. So if you care about not getting fat or acquiring diabetes, don't eat there. But if you like a good drink and a fantastic bartender, head directly to the bar."
Megan A.,"Chicago, IL",1,14,5,3.0,6/16/2017,Its a good place but the wait time today was over an hour.i know its weekend but still one hour to get a slice of cheesecake and then 20 mins aftr ordering u have to wait.other than the wait time it is a good place with a variety of desserts options
Nicholas M.,"Chicago, IL",145,248,6,2.0,1/14/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to and frankly, one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've had in a while.  The service was terrible. Took about 25 minutes just to get a cocktail and the place didn't seem that busy at the time. Then the food took another 20 minutes after that. 10 minutes into eating my food, the waiter is practically kicking us out of our table to make room for the dinner rush. Hey, I'm a paying customer too you know.  The food was alright but honestly with the experience I had, I wouldn't ever come back. This place left an unfortunate taste in my mouth. Hire some more waiters if you have to."
Brittany M.,"Chicago, IL",797,137,162,5.0,4/29/2017,"I can only speak to the cheesecake but as you may have guessed, it was pretty of the charts AMAZING!! We came here for dinner but there was a long wait and this was on a Tuesday night (so maybe call ahead or be prepared for a wait) so we decided to get cheesecake. The wait for the cheesecake was 10 minutes but it was so worth it. There are steps to sit on outside the restaurant, perfect spot to share a bit with your love (or your enemy if you're using the cheesecake as a peace offering). Great spot to eat if you're in the area. In the bottom of the John Hancock tower."
Aseel M.,"Detroit, MI",3,56,76,4.0,6/16/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a religious experience every time I come to Chicago.  The food is always consistently good, no matter what you pick. The price is reasonable for Chicago standards. The food portions are huge.  Nice place as well. Had indoor seating and outdoor.  Recommended."
Anthony S.,"Saint Louis, MO",14,129,35,3.0,6/24/2017,"Food was subpar at best. Overpriced for sure. Atmosphere was good, waiter was really good too. To me they're on the same level as Applebee's but they carry more food. My burger was good, my GFs food was good also. I'll come back to here but not just on a whim."
Selina A.,"Chicago, IL",111,7,2,1.0,11/5/2017,"I've been to this location in the past and have had better experiences. My boyfriend and I waited way too long for our food. Multiple tables that ordered after us got their food before we did. My boyfriend even had to put more money in the parking meter. Someone did come and apologize about the wait, but when our food arrived, the portion size was tiny, and the side of my plate was greasy. I finished the spaghetti that came with my shrimp scampi in 3 bites. The food presentation was also poor as well, kinda looked like it was being rushed out of the kitchen with no care. I'm not sure if they were running out of food or just extremely busy, but that's still no excuse. I will definitely not be coming back here again. The one star is for the bartender, who was extremely nice and accommodating while we were waiting for our table."
Francis R.,"Chicago, IL",674,712,998,3.0,10/20/2016,"The Rundown: The interior of this place feels like you sitting an a magical mushroom cave or something. Food wise the portions are huge and the menu is the same as I remember from over 10 years ago. Service was good but could be a tad bit speedier. Overall: A-OK I think at one point in my life I was going to Cheesecake Factory once a month. I've always been a fan of their pastas, specifically the Pasta Da Vinci (Sautéed Chicken, Mushrooms and Onions in a Delicious Madeira Wine Sauce Tossed with Penne Pasta and Parmesan). Cool to see that their menu looks relatively unchanged for the most part. More recently I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce), and it was delicious and definitely enough to feed two. Prices still seem to be the same from what I remember years ago as well and great to see they don't hike up the prices for being in a tourist heavy spot along Michigan Avenue. Anyways, even though it's a chain, it's great to see they're still serving up huge portions of quality food that I remember from long ago.   'Til next time, cheers!"
Polina K.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",3,4,8,3.0,8/26/2017,"Very nice place! My last lunch in Chicago was here and I'm not regret! Avocado rolls were tasty, but portions here are too bigAnd prices as well. Anyway I want to visit this place again and try here cheesecake!"
Brooke D.,"Chicago, IL",118,3,4,1.0,12/18/2017,"Last night we visited for dinner at 9:30pm,service was terrible. After being sat and quickly greeted by our waiter it was all down hill from there. Order appetizers that took a extremely longer that usual time for and arrived luke warm, waiter was attentive to the large group across from us while our drinks sat empty. Filet was over cooked requested a medium well, received a crisp over cooked well done burnt steak. Waiter did not check on our order until we were half way through our dinner as he was more concerned with the large group next to us, cracking jokes and splitting checks for a group of at least 20. Also found it odd that the restaurant chose to pull their wait staff off the floor to loudly sing happy birthday in the kitchen for another staff member in the middle of service. Chose to order cheesecake from the counter since our waiter was no where to be found, counter employee was rude as well. When exiting and passing the host stand witnessed a male employee massaging a Female employee at the host stand."
Carolina P.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,,4.0,12/17/2017,I love their burgers and of course their cheesecake is the best! Sometimes you can be waiting long which sucks. but the food is delicious!
Sara N.,"Arlington Heights, IL",143,125,19,5.0,4/11/2017,"Came here with a little less than an hour until close, around 10:40 PM. The food and service were incredible. 1. Freshly baked bread and butter 2. The most delicious angel hair pasta I've ever had at any Cheesecake location with the most flavor, tomatoes, and sauce- this was the best version I've had and I've been ordering this menu item for over a decade 3. This main dish came out in under 10 minutes, and as mentioned previously, it was better than any other previous order of it throughout my entire lifetime 4. Ordered 3 slices of cheesecake- Oreo, Snickers, and Adam's Peanut Butter (these are the best flavors they have IMO) and was in complete ecstasy 5. Server was super friendly, fast, and filled our water throughout the dining experience very frequently"
Mark L.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,3.0,8/12/2017,Would get five but for Some reason they always run out of ice cream. Maybe you should consider ordering a larger quantity if you know you run out.
Kallay C.,"St. Joseph, MI",113,22,16,2.0,5/20/2017,"They get two stars for their incredible service and cheesecake, but our food was terrible. Pasta carbonara was almost inedible because it was SO salty! (And I'm usually a pretty heavy seasoner myself. This was just too much.) The Bacon Bacon burger...  is it possible to have too much bacon? Yes. The burger was perfectly done, but the toppings killed it. Too much cheese, too much bacon, too much... stuff. We were bummed. But our server was excellent!  Francisco never let our mugs run dry of water and we were majorly dehydrated when we got there. He refilled it at least three times! As a former server, I know how hard it is to get the details right when you're slammed busy, and he did great! Very happy with him. I just wish our food wouldn't have been so awful."
LaShaye G.,"Farmington, MI",261,56,67,1.0,8/25/2017,"This place! Lord Jesus!!!!!!! We went here this past Monday the 21st for my niece's birthday. My family drove in from Michigan and I drove in from St Louis for the day. My niece LOVES Cheesecake factory and we were uber excited about ending our day of family fun there! (especially after our HORRIFIC experience at the Cheesecake Factory in St. Louis back in April) Well, let me tell you.  This location came in for runner up of the worst Cheesecake Factory that I have ever been to!  I'm sure by now you want details. Well, I am about to fill you in.  To begin. Me, My Aunt, and 3 nieces sat for about 10 minutes without being offered water or ANYTHING. Finally, the waiter offers us beverages. When he returns he manages to spill my niece's lemonade all over the table. Yes, accidents happen BUT this man did not apologize and he also DID NOT LIFT A FINGER TO CLEAN UP THE MESS! Yes, you heard that HE DID NOT LIFT A FINGER TO CLEAN UP THE ENTIRE MUG OF SPILLED LEMONADE. My aunt and niece cleans up this mess and he returns close to 5 minutes later with a new lemonade. He had the audacity to look irritated when I asked for a wet cloth so that we can clean the table and it not be sticky. After receiving the wet cloth HE WATCHED MY AUNT WIPE THE TABLE DOWN. I thought the situation was comical and said to him, ' I cant believe you're just going to watch her clean the table."" After my joking statement he still DID NOT HELP MY AUNT CLEAN THE TABLE. He grabbed a busser as she passed and said, ""Can you wipe this down THEY SPILLED A DRINK."" (DID YOU CATCH THAT? NHE BLAMED IT ON US)  Everyone at our table was freezing and we asked to move tables due to the draft of cold air. Guess what. We were just blatantly told NO! ARE YOUU SERIOUS! So, after that we much needed an adult beverage! I ordered a Whiskey Smash and my aunt ordered a Bellini of some sort. We ordered our food and was never offered another drink EVER!  After a great deal of time our food arrived and mine was cold and my Southern Fried Catfish was undercooked.  This was the visit from hell!   Jesus! We waited another 35 minutes for them to remake my food!  ALSO TO TOP OFF THIS VISIT........ WE WERE NEVER OFFERED CHEESECAKE!  This experience totally ruined the finale of my niece's birthday!"
Carrie J.,"Mission District, San Francisco, CA",54,14,42,5.0,8/4/2017,Cheesecake.  Oh. Cheesecake. Parkyr was over the moon about the smooth creaminess. Cute outdoor patio at this location as well with a sweet fountain to enjoy or the dark sensuous detailed ambiance indoors is wonderful and so very private to have great conversations.
Lucky T.,"Aurora, IL",0,8,,5.0,10/21/2017,"Incredible Cheesecake Factory. I really like the layout and design. They did a wonderful job with such a small and tight area. You do have to wait for a table on the weekend, but that's what happens when eating at the Cheesecake Factory."
Tana R.,"Chicago, IL",89,220,229,2.0,5/14/2017,"It's good food and great service but when this place gets packed (often at this location), it's hard for staff to keep up with the amount of customers coming in... I have been to better Cheesecake Factories for sure. Choose different location if you can."
