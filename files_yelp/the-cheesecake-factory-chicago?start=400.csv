Adela V.,"Miami, FL",42,5,,1.0,7/22/2014,"HORRIBLE.  I've been to various locations across the country and always loved the food, service, and overall atmosphere. I always go to a CF for my birthday since cheesecake is THE best dessert and their selection is amazing. Yesterday was my birthday and I was craving some orange chicken (which is what I always tend to order) and birthday cheesecake. So, my husband and I headed over for some birthday fun (or so I thought).  The location is great which is also why I wanted to go, the view and the breeze while sitting outside are amazing! It was a Monday night and was surprisingly busy (tourists maybe?), so we waited about 30 minutes for a table outside, which was fine, I don't mind waiting so long as the experience is a good one. Once we sat down, a waiter did not come by to take our order for about 15min. We already knew what we wanted to order since we had decided during our 30min wait. When the waiter came by, FINALLY, we ordered our food (spinach and cheese dip as an appetizer, orange chicken for me and pasta carbonara for my husband). Our waiter asked if we wanted some bread, we of course said YES! The bread took about another 15min to arrive, and by then our appetizer arrived too. Ok, so far so good. Then, about 20min later, our food arrived. We were about ready to eat a whale at that point, we were super hungry! That's when the disappointment comes. The food was bland. The white rice that came with my orange chicken was cold, the orange chicken itself was also cold and hard, not nice and chewy and flavorful like I remember. My husband's pasta was watery and was cold as well, no salt, no flavor. We tried to make the best of it and tried to eat it as is, but stopped about 1/4 of the way through and just could not take another bite. We were waiting for the server to come by to tell him, but he didn't come by for another 30min. By then, we just wanted to go home. I told him that the food was horrible and we just wanted the check. He said that we should've told him earlier so that he could've told his manager and the cooks and given us other options. (Um, maybe if you didn't take 30min to check on us?) But, apparently we had eaten some of it and we no longer would be credible. WHAT? We ate 1/4 of the plate because we attempted to deal with it. If it were good, trust me, the plates would have been CLEAN, no food left on them. My husband and I are huge foodies.  I heard the waiter talk to his manager behind us, trying to get us a discount I guess (nice of him), but his manager just shrugged his shoulders and we were given our $70 bill for the appetizer we ate and 1/4 portion we could stomach down. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK TO CF. I don't know if it's just this location because it's downtown, but it really put a dent in my loyalty to CF. Utterly disappointed.  Worst part, it ruined my birthday. Thanks."
Ron L.,"Chicago, IL",191,13,8,5.0,11/29/2014,I love love love Cheesecake Factory... My favorite item is the buffalo blasters... Yummy!!!
Ben B.,"Chicago, IL",241,880,2909,3.0,10/16/2008,"The menu is enormous.  You're sure to find something you'll like.  I had the Teriyaki Chicken, and it was good. The restaurant is a little cheesy, but that can be forgiven as long as you're not one of those people who is all about ""authentic"" little bistros in plywood shacks somewhere. I don't have anything particularly negative to say about the Cheesecake Factory, but there was a bit of a sticker shock when we got our bill.  Were those martinis really worth $10 a pop?  Um, no. For  two entrees, two drinks, two slices of cheesecake and a tip, I walked out $80 lighter.  That seems disproportionate.  If the prices were more reasonable, I could notch this baby to 4 stars, easy. I consider this a nice place to take your out-of-town visitors or a worthy stop just for the desserts."
Brian B.,"Chicago, IL",34,1020,913,4.0,7/7/2014,"Don't normally make a point to find these but we arrived late into Chicago on a Thursday night and this was open late. It was surprisingly packed with people but we were seated within a few minutes. Although loud and crowded, we received very good service. We ordered a handful of small plates to share including these meat kebabs that came with little pitas and veggies to build your own little pita thing. Super good, fast and reasonable priced."
Kathryn Z.,"Bridgman, MI",0,8,,4.0,2/22/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is by far my favorite restaurant! This location was very busy! Not too long of a wait for 2 of us. We were seated next to two other table which I didn't like. A little too close for comfort! Server was very busy and took about 15 minutes to get our waters. We both ordered and had to reorder because they were out of turkey lunch meat. Strawberry smoothie was delicious, quite possibly the best I've had! Chicken soup was very flavorful as well as the house salad which was surprising since it only contained mixed green, ranch and tomatoes. His French dip was nothing special. Fries were pretty good. Waited a while to receive our bill and for refills."
Sandi L.,"Portland, OR",1,24,4,2.0,1/8/2015,"So mediocre. I've been to other Cheesecake Factories and been blown away. This one gives the company a black eye. Lettuce wraps were unusually bland and the sauces--underwhelming. Two years ago, I had a similarly disappointing experience with a dish I've loved elsewhere. Shame on me for not learning my lesson."
Jennifer G.,"Easton, PA",1,13,20,5.0,11/3/2014,"Absolutely fantastic. I have been to a few cheese cake factories before and this one really does the name justice. The food was fantastic, service was top, and everything was made fast and fresh. We had Ro as our server and he made the night something truly special."
Alana T.,"Chicago, IL",150,190,34,5.0,6/25/2012,"THIS IS MY SPOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I've been going to Cheesecake factory faithfully for quite a few years, and when I say, I'm NEVER disappointed, I'm NEVER disappointed.  The most recent time I went, I had the Chicken Bellagio. Man, pasta with pesto sauce, chicken and cream sauce on top. If you think that's not enough, they PILE a a beautiful bed of Arugula on top. It's such a nice compliment.  Cheesecake factory has quite the extensive menu. There are pages and pages and pages of menu items. For all taste buds. I find it really hard to believe if you say you can't find something on the menu you like. But, I wouldn't necessarily blame you if you just got tired of searching. But, PLEASE, keep trying. It's stellar!  Of course, you can't go here without having it's namesake! Personally, I recommend the Banana Cream Cheesecake without the extra whipped cream (I gotta be good somewhere). It's awesomeness!  So... 1) Food is banging. The portions are HUGE! Definitely enough food to share and take some home!  2) Service is always awesome. I always get the best servers, and I'm one to chat it up with them, so I do so.  3) THE BROWN BREAD! EAT THE BROWN BREAD. I always tell them, ""don't bring any of that sourdough stuff"". THE BROWN BREAD has me on my knees, pleading for more BROWN BREAD.  4) The price is right!"
Lisa L.,"Chicago, IL",0,63,,5.0,12/25/2014,"Excellent service, even better food.  We were actually seated right away, normally there's a wait but we chose to sit upstairs where the menu is smaller but they have the same desserts.  I went shopping downtown with my 2 kids & we really only wanted some appetizers and, of course, cheesecake so the smaller menu was appealing.  We had the chicken wings, avocado egg rolls and the mac & cheese balls.  All were so tasty, especially the mac & cheese.  They were lightly breaded and so creamy.  My son said the wings were some of the best he ever had and the egg rolls were so different, but very good.  If you've walking Michigan Ave, the restaurant is inside the John Hancock, but has access from the street.  And the cheese cake was good too!"
Luis T.,"New York, NY",25,25,4,2.0,4/28/2014,"A word to the inept: Don't ever mess with the customer. So here's my story. I was at this location on the 19th of April. This was my first time coming to any Cheesecake Factory in the US. My wife and I wanted to have a great experience all around but that dream came to a halt.    It came to a halt in several ways. The first was when the manager mispronounced my name when calling our reservation.    The next was when the manager sat us next to an area where cold air was being brought in through the back doors. I told the manager we couldn't sit there but while he was listening to me, he had his hand on my shoulder. It was kind of like a in the animal kingdom asserting-my-dominance power play. It was really passive-aggressive and so I did the only logical thing and proceeded to put my hand on his shoulder. He told us that he would get us another table but that we had to go back and wait for him. Bad move on his part.    As if, the manager wasn't enough we were greeted by our waiter. I abruptly told him that my wife and I needed to move and we were waiting for the manager to come pick us up.   Now, I'm a kind man. When I do a job in the service industry, I come from a place of peace. This waiter told us to leave because he had to make tips. It was in the most condescending way possible.  He made us feel like dollar signs.  Even if we were dollar signs to him at least give us the illusion that we are not and actually provide good service.    He then later apologized but it was too little, too late.    Good food yet such lousy service. I really hope the district manager trains the individuals mentioned in the review.  No mercy for those who don't know that good service is key to a businesses' success."
Jackie C.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",10,16,,1.0,9/7/2012,We had a gift card so we decided to tackle the tourist crowd and go. I expected the wait and I knew we needed to be in a patient mood. What I didn't expect was the MOST ridiculous seating process EVER! Brace yourselves when you go... you will wait for your pager to go off- standard. But instead of someone seating you they escort you to the back of the restaurant to wait with the other group of 10 pagers that went off and wait AGAIN for your name to be called.  So chaotic and the most ridiculous sitting process I've ever encountered.
Ashwin A.,"Chicago, IL",8,20,12,5.0,11/18/2014,This place serves the best cheese cake I've had so far and also it is very good for pastas and burgers
Pearl T.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",5,169,43,4.0,10/26/2014,"Attentive service, clean restaurant, yummy food and good-sized portions.  I've never had more than a couple minute wait since I typically come either right before or right after the lunch rush. I've come here a couple of times and always ordered the miso salmon lunch special, which I really enjoy.  My four year old typically orders the chicken strips kids meal and those are pretty tasty... real breast meat pieces (not the overly processed strips).  They have a hugely extensive menu so there's sure to be something for everyone.  It's a chain and it's right smack in tourist-central but the quality of the food has been solid.  And the cheesecakes we've had have all been supreme!!"
Jennie T.,"Chicago, IL",219,751,373,4.0,3/2/2011,"I'm not big on the Cheesecake Factory in general, but this one, I'm a fan of because I work in the building and it's nice to be able go downstairs if I want pasta (sorry L'Appetito but heated pastas aren't the same; they actually make me a little sick). The servers are nice to me. A telltale sign of a customer from the building is one that goes into the restaurant donning only office wear when there's snow outside the building.  The service is a little slower than I'd like for my one-hour lunch break, but it at least wouldn't span over an hour. That would get me in trouble. I think they know that, so it's nice. Plus, you can always tell them that you need your food fast. Beware though, the portions are huge. You will have leftovers."
Ting C.,"Chicago, IL",0,32,,2.0,6/19/2014,"Meh. I've experienced better.....because the other times I've been here the service was indeed better. Ordered carry out today. Was told 20 minutes. Wasn't ready when I got there and waited in line 30 minutes after I called. Then was given this tiny piece of bread. Usually I am given 2 kinds of bread and both would be bigger then the piece I was given today. So I guess it's hit or miss here like any other restaurant. The problem is workers don't care to provide consistent service. It's not a Cheesecake Factory specific problem. It can even happen at Starbucks. It's the luck of the draw, depends on which worker you get that day and whether or not they are in a good mood."
Chelsea W.,"Urbana, IL",18,1,,1.0,6/13/2015,"I've never written any sort of customer review or feedback, but today I had my worst dining experience. I entered the Chicago store at 6:27pm. The front desk person took down my name and gave me a buzzer, said the wait would be about 15 min. After 25 min, I went to the front desk again and asked about my status in line. She said I would be called soon in 5-10 min. I waited another 20 min and checked again with the front desk, she told me I'm the next in line. I felt there should be something wrong, either with the buzzer or the system. I went to the back register/desk, and said I waited for almost an hour now, what's going on. The manager said, I was called 45 min ago. The buzzer never buzzed, I said. He the said yes the buzzers sometimes do not work, that's why he had someone call our names. I never heard anyone call my name, neither did my friend. We were waiting right at the cheesecake to-go place, which is less then 10 feet from where the manager is. There is no way we both missed the call! Plus, I asked the front desk two times and the girl told me to wait! She never told me I was called!! The manager's attitude is the worst I've ever seen in my entire life!! He said "" we've been doing the same business for year"". (Meaning that they couldn't possibly be wrong??!!) I told him that I've checked with the front desk, he didn't listen and insisted that its the same system and its not possible!!!! So again, it couldn't be their problem then??! It's my problem??? Never going to Cheesecake Factory any more!"
Feskeli G.,"Buena Park, CA",90,213,751,5.0,7/25/2012,"My fav spot for avocado rolls! Fav spot for asian chicken salad, and pomegrante mojitos."
Taylor M.,"La Moille, IL",9,32,23,4.0,7/23/2013,"We went here with a group of friends coming down from WI to visit and it was a great experience. The waiting staff was amazing: polite, helpful, quick... the menu itself is MASSIVE but our waiter helped us out and gave us plenty of time with no pressure to be able to look at everything. I ordered the skinnylicious chicken enchiladas and they we delicious! I would definitely order it again if there wasn't like 5 other things I wanted to try!  Only thing I would warn anyone about going here is that there are a lot of people in a kind of tight area so you would just have to prepare yourself for that! Otherwise it was a superb dining experience!"
Saira K.,"Atlanta, GA",147,1047,403,3.0,6/26/2012,"Touristy. Service was slow. I'm not really a fan of Cheesecake factory - comes from living in NY and regularly having to-die-for cheesecake. But, if you like Cheesecake factory, this is a good location."
Mark S.,"Highland, IN",1,11,17,5.0,4/20/2014,"Returned to Cheesecake Factory this weekend for the one millionth time. The food was awesome as always, although I have to say I prefer the OakBrook location a little better. Either way the food is awesome sauce."
