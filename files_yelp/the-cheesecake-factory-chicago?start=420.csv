Tia D.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",8,154,52,4.0,4/16/2014,"A busy Sunday mid~morning at the CCF but the wait for a table was not long at all, service was a different story! Our server was a bit pressured with the crowd and finally came through with menus but swiftly departed without even so much as ""would you like water""? No problem the tip will reflect that, as we began our order with appetizers and drinks another server came by and attempted to place our order, huh? The left hand is busy Jkn off and the right hand didn't know? hmm, anyway he appeared puzzled but moved on. Water and a bread basket finally arrived shortly thereafter.  The fried mac~n~cheese balls are to die for but calorie packed (be warned if you're fighting the battle of the bulge) I could only down one of these (comes three to an order) but my friend was able to take care of the rest. The grilled salmon was good, moist and well seasoned as well as the potatoes with the broccoli served steamed and fresh. Strawberry~lemonade was good as well, not too tart not too sweet. Service didn't improve much through desert but the cheesecake sure was good, it saved the entire visit, it delivered in flavor and freshness but again if you're fighting the battle be warned, they do offer low calorie options but I'd rather take the real deal and divvy out servings as part of my calorie goal, worked out fine, the atmosphere was very loud and we got a bad corner, weird sideways table that should be bull dozed out the door immediately, had to be the worst seat in the house, over all a nice meal for brunch if you can stand the service or lack of during those hours."
Nora L.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",37,9,,2.0,6/27/2015,"While the cheesecake is wonderful, the quality of their food otherwise leaves a lot to be desired - lots of additives, sugar and the like"
Anna G.,"Copenhagen, Denmark",0,2,,4.0,6/21/2014,"We really enjoyed our visit to Cheesecake Factory in April. The food was delicious and especially the Garlic Noodles hold a special place in my companion's heart. We also had two slices of cheesecake, one with cookie dough and the other with raspberry truffle. They were really good! The staff was friendly, but we experienced a lot of waiting doing our meal especially for the two slices of cheesecake, which we waited 30 min for, we actually missed an appointment because of the waiting.  However we would like to visit another time when we are in the US."
Hina Q.,"Mississauga, Canada",74,445,63,1.0,4/28/2012,"So back in December 2011 I ordered a 10"" cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory for my husband's birthday. I called into the location, told them which cake I wanted, gave them all my details, TIME of pick up, etc. So the day of my husband's birthday I had to ask a friend to pick up the cake since I couldn't get away, when she got to the restaurant, they had NO RECORD of my order!! wth!! So she had to wait 20mins for them to get one together.  Highly unprofessional.  So what was the point of taking all my information???  hmm..."
Sruts S.,"Chicago, IL",10,159,24,3.0,5/2/2013,"Food is good, portions are large, it's usually crowded. Get there early, especially if you're a large group, otherwise, try finding a spot in the bar area. While I'm not a big fan of any of their appetizers, the burgers, sandwiches and salads are great. The waiters all happy and quite fun. One of them even split checks for a group of 18 of us once! If you're here just for the cheesecake, grab one at the cake bar at the entrance."
Jeremy R.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",5,38,102,4.0,8/31/2014,Sunday brunch at the Cheese cake bottom of the menu there it is Breakfast Burrito and it was amazing
Audra W.,"Chicago, IL",134,65,4,1.0,2/15/2015,"Worst customer service in terms of management ever! I love Cheesecake Factory anywhere but downtown Chicago. I took my aunt and cousins there, my aunt ordered the pasta and it had a piece of glass in it! She cut up her tongue and management handled it terribly. They only comped her pasta, they didn't even care she injured herself nor did they care to throw out their contaminated supply of pasta. I'm disgusted the lack of caring my family experienced at this restaurant and will never visit this location again. They didn't bother to take care of us or the situation at all!"
Linda D.,"Holland, MI",0,16,,2.0,3/22/2014,Came to this restaurant because we have come before when we have been in Chicago. Brought a four-year-old with food allergies. Thought that cheesecake factory was allergy friendly but could not find anyone to give us an allergen menu. Waiter unable to help us with allergen information. Table was dirty. Toast with entrée was burned! Waiter are unapologetic. Disappointed.
Carlos R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/23/2014,"Never again. After a long cattle call of a wait (you actually have to wait in two lines, one to get called for a table, and a second one to get seated), two of us got our table. The couple next to us left before their food arrived, barely touched their drinks. Not a good sign.  The waitress was friendly. Then the draft beer machine was out of order for the next three days. It took two trips back and forth to get that information by the waitress. My partner's drink never arrived, asked three times for it. His cake was not available --plain cheesecake? Really? My food was good. It was not dessert but I got it there very quickly. I  was done well before he even got his cheesecake. It was ""just ok"". Timing was way off and didn't seem to be a concern to the staff. Although the prices are reasonable,  the hassle and time consumed made it completely not worth it."
Aaron C.,"Jefferson Park, Chicago, IL",0,17,,2.0,9/3/2014,"Food was good. Service - atrocious. Our server took a while before casually acknowledging our presence and taking our drink order. We both ordered a latte. When they brought the drinks in mammoth mugs, both were barely half full. It looked like they made one latte for two customers and called it good. The lattes I've gotten at the Cheesecake Factory in Old Orchard Mall (Skokie), however, are very tasty and well done. This was several years ago--have not been back. First impressions matter, people!"
Melanie S.,"Chicago, IL",667,867,323,2.0,12/31/2009,"Huge portions of mediocre food. Why does that get people all lathered up? This place always reminds me of the line in the Woody Allen movie 'Annie Hall': ""The food here is terrible. Yeah, and such small portions."" What you will get here are NOT small portions, but what is the appeal of a huge plate of uninspired, mass-produced food? And make no mistake. For this privilege, you will likely wait a LONG time for a table. Hell, you will likely have to wait just to put your name in for a table. Invariably, I get roped into coming here once or twice a year by friends or relatives visiting Chicago, or coworkers who think ""it's such a great place for a group."" Sure, the menu is enormous, but there's still nothing I want to eat here. It takes me forever to find the least offensive thing on the menu. People I'm with will say ""So many great things to pick from it's hard to narrow it down, huh?"" Umm, no. It's hard to narrow it down because there's literally nothing out of 15 menu pages that I want to pick at, hoping it will be decent. I usually end up with a salad of some kind. Even when I get the ""lunch size,"" it's still enough to feed 3 people. And it's not like salad keeps all that well, so there's no point in taking home the leftovers. Maybe I'm being too hard on this place. But it's expensive, crowded, and even their signature cheesecakes ain't all that great. I'm done with the 'Factory.' I've been here at least 20 times since it opened and I've never liked it. But I've never gotten food poisoning from eating here either, so that's why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1. From now on, if someone suggests going here, I'll just politely decline. I say skip this place. Life's too short to have even one mediocre meal."
Mohammed A.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,1.0,11/25/2015,"Came here for dinner with my family and the food was terrible! We had to send back the wings because they were cold and salty. When we ordered our main courses, the quality continued to suffer, pasta was dry and the crusted chicken was soggy! The staff didn't seem to care much about our concern, and the manager thought offering us a free cheese cake would resolve everything! Wow!"
Randy R.,"Portage, IN",34,5,1,4.0,10/8/2014,You can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory anywhere.  This one is Located at the base of the John Hancock building in downtown Chicago.  Wife and I took the kids on the south shore train to downtown and walked around.  We stopped in and enjoyed our ourselves.  The only reason I'm giving this four stars is the bill and tip totaled about $125.00 for two adults and one teenager and two kids.  Chicago are freaks when you see all the taxes on the bill.
Francois V.,"Chicago, IL",6,13,2,1.0,3/2/2014,Brought family here for New Years Day to celebrate son's birthday. Service was terrible the wait was long. Upstairs was empty but staff had us corralled like cattle in the hall. Bus boy's were overworked & short staffed. 4 sets of dirty dishes were dropped around us. My wife & niece got splashed nobody apologized or brought us napkins. We will NEVER return. This place is overrated & overpriced. 2 rules of business. The customer is always right if you find they are wrong then refer bk to rule #1
Lisa P.,"South Holland, IL",42,91,46,4.0,8/14/2012,"I really did enjoy my dinner here tonight and the cheesecake? Well the name of the place gives you some type of hint, right???"
Weichen H.,"Chicago, IL",9,25,3,5.0,11/11/2014,"The best cheesecake I ever had and I've tasted half of their cheesecake. Strongly recommend the red velvet, Godiva and the original ones. Besides, the salmon, beef and shrimp noodle is also good."
Celia J.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",18,9,9,1.0,5/3/2014,Super busy. So I ask if there's room at the bar and the host says yeah right through there. I head through and see an expresso bar immediately and a liquor and beer far to the far right 2 ppl at the expresso bar and a used seating so I sat down. I'm craving their fresh made to order guacamole. It's all I want. I sit for about 5 minutes and servers bustle in and out of the nearby kitchen one even walks through the expresso bar makes a coffee and leaves. I ask the host nearby if I can sit there and she says oh yes both bars are self seating. But I ask is there someone to serve me? Oh yes she tells me. I've been waiting for quite some time. She looks confused then says 'lemme check' and starts to wander away looking around lost so I finally say 'never mind I'll go else where' 'oh ok.' Like it's no problem whatsoever that I didn't get helped and want to leave. ~:( I still want that guac.
Xiao Z.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,5.0,11/6/2015,"In terms of value, I think their steak diane and shrimp scampi is the best. I like their avocado egg roll as appetizer.  Their cheesecake is the best that I can find in Chicago but it is bit expensive, though acceptable."
Angela H.,"Fennville, MI",4,57,5,5.0,9/21/2014,"Amazing, to-die-for cheesecakes.  Very pricy but worth it.  Better than I can ever make at home."
Stephanie A.,"Noble Square, Chicago, IL",6,47,4,5.0,6/3/2012,I love the cheesecake factory. But be warned if you want to come here for dinner to expect an hour wait. I suggest you ask to be seated outside. The wait to seat outside is a lot less wait.  The service here is okay. The waiter I got last time was great though. So don't judge them after only going once.
