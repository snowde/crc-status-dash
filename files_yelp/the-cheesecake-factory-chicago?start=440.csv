Anuj S.,"Chicago, IL",162,626,2,3.0,4/9/2010,"This place is definitely an experience.  You gotta go at least once.  You should see their menu... it's literally a BOOK.  They have basically every kind of cuisine under the sun.  Well, almost. I remember the quesadillas were really good.  The pasta is OK.  The pizza is also OK.  Oh, the portabella sandwich is nice and juicy, if you like that.  We really enjoyed these avacado spring rolls they have for appetiziers.  Never seen that anywhere else. Taste-wise... I'd say the food is good.  Not the greatest, but if you put everything else together, I like this place.  Of course the cheesecakes are really special.  Their dinner portions are so HUGE, though, you gotta remember to leave room for the dessert.  That's gotta be the best part. Update:  I went back here recently and remember why I'm not so high on this place.  The food is just very average and I remember seeing them pop up on the worst foods in terms of health in the COUNTRY.  I had the burrito this time.  It was just so average..."
Elle S.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,,3.0,10/23/2014,"I went there with the kiddos on a weekday- the wait was pretty decent, 5 minutes to a table. The food was OK, dessert was superb, what really makes me want to write a review is the smell and service. For some reason, the whole place smells like dirty rags - I can't describe it, it's like they mopped and wiped the whole place down with some dirty, old rag. And the service, I told them it was my son's birthday and they seemed less than happy to sing a ""happy birthday"" to him. Probably NOT having another dinner at this location, I much prefer the Old Orchard one or Oakbrook"
Tupac L.,"Chicago, IL",2,34,,2.0,3/12/2013,The service is very good. But the food is just okay they give u huge portions which makes the food taste nasty lol  The only good thing is there buffalo wings and pina coladas oh and they have fancy cups!
Odranre B.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",374,292,381,3.0,8/21/2012,"the food taste like...well,  the food from all the other cheesecake factory...it's always too loud inside...so many tourists...no reservations...there are no parking, so you'll have to pay private parking which will cost you around this area $20...the place is located on the base of the hancock building, which would explain all the tourists everyone deserves chances so i will occasionally re-visit establishments that did not get favorable reviews from me in hope that they have addressed the issues and will revise my views accordingly"
Angela N.,"Chicago, IL",48,30,13,2.0,10/28/2012,"I generally really like the Cheesecake Factory because the food is good and they give you generous portions. However, the service of this establishment completely turned me off. The hostess was semi-unprofessional and seemed to not care a bit about us. We wanted to sit outside and then she told us that there would be wait for a table (but we clearly saw that there was available seating outside and NO ONE in line to be sat), then she continued her conversation with her co-workers about some lady that was super picky about seating (NOT a conversation you should be having when guests are around you #sideconvos).  When we finally did sit, our server was extremely inattentive. We didn't even receive cups of water until a buser came by to ask us if we were okay. However, I'm one of those sympathetic people that will analyze the situation and make up an excuse for you like he's having a bad day, or he's just really tired. I work in the service industry and this is just not okay.  But we were super happy with the food when it came so it extinguished the steam that I was feeling from the lack of service!"
Rudy A.,"Berwyn, IL",0,11,1,4.0,8/7/2014,"The food was good there, it's a very nice looking place just took a long while for me to get my change back took longer honestly then my food to come"
Louise G.,"Houston, TX",53,61,7,4.0,9/4/2015,Have been to other locations of the Cheesecake Factory and have always been impressed with the wide selection on the menu and of course you need to leave room for dessert-the Godiva cheesecake is divine!!
Diana G.,"Chicago, IL",245,1024,3790,4.0,8/11/2008,My favorite thing to order is the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club. My brother gets the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it's got a kick to it. The tiramisu is very good!
Yee Gan O.,"London, United Kingdom",1361,2299,7859,4.0,9/22/2011,"OK I've finally done it. Despite my many trips to the USA, I've never been tempted to dine at the Cheescake Factory. However, I've been informed that I was missing out.\ So, during my trip to Chicago, when I spied a Cheesecake Factory at the base of the John Hancock Observatory close to my hotel, I decided to pick up something for dessert after my evening meal. I headed to the bakery section and was confronted by a bewildering array of cheesecakes. Apparently, they have more different types of cheesecakes than Baskin Robbins have flavours of ice cream. I can well believe it! I asked the server for advice and he recommended the red velvet - that way, I had the cake layer of red velvet to eat and also the famous cheesecake layers between the cake. Well, the portion was enormous! I'm not sure how people eat a main course and then fit one of these in. I actually ate the cheesecake over 2 days. It was tasty in a sinful sort of way. However, too much of it would give you a major sugar rush! So, I've finally done it and eaten from the Cheesecake Factory. If I had a major sweet tooth, I'd be back in a flash"
Siva R.,"Chicago, IL",2,1,,1.0,8/17/2014,"V had a red velvet cheesecake as it is one of their signature cake..  The cake has more of cheese and less of velvet cake and the cake is so hard to break and too sweet. Simply put,  the worst cake of our times.  Enjoy the true factory kind of environment."
Nicki W.,"Chicago, IL",144,245,170,3.0,12/11/2009,"I'm usually not up for the limited chain establishments in Chicago, but I've been walking past the place quite frequently for the past 5 years and I'm intrigued by the general look of the place so finally I decided to take a stab at Cheesecake. My friend and I went on Wednesday night and the place was pretty busy, not to mention...it's HUGE. It was freezing outside and snowing heavily. They seated us at a nice table right by the window (which in my opinion is one of the only spots I would ever sit). The views are nice and with the snow falling it was nice and peaceful.  Our waiter was really friendly and he helped us narrow down some items on the menu. Did I mention that this menu has the most serious case of A.D.D that I've ever seen? They have Italian food, Asian, Mexican, American...possibly more..but I started losing patience. I've never seen so many random items at one place. I guess they have over 200 menu options. I would much rather go to a place that specializes in one type of cuisine (otherwise I wonder about quality control).  We ordered some Pot Stickers, Thai Lettuce Wraps and Roasted Stuffed Dates. I was impressed. The stuffed Dates were wrapped in Bacon and they had a great combination of sweet and salty taste. The Thai Lettuce Wraps is what I really enjoyed. The Peanut sauce is to die for and the chicken had a great marinade on it. All of the apps were pretty simple. After the apps, we were stuffed, so I can't comment on the entrees or sandwiches but the Cheesecake is something I was personally looking forward to!  I get excited when restaurants have a nice list of coffee drinks (especially when it's collld out). I had the Cafe Mocha with the following Cheesecake selections: Lemon Rasberry Creme, Peppermint Bark and the Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. Of course the Peanut Butter was my favorite...but they were all SO good. Bad news for those of us trying to stick to a healthy diet, but a little slice of heaven here and there wont kill me! The overall ambience of the place wasn't bad either, but for the most part I try to stay away from the tourist-trap dining establishments on Michigan Ave during most times of the year.  If you're wondering what all that gold chrome all over the place is, I was wondering the same thing. I felt like I was inside a pie (the waiter told us it was supposed to be the inside of a Cheesecake) hmm..either way, cool place for a tourist-trap chain. I'll be back,"
Lee H.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,4.0,9/24/2015,"Enjoyed my chicken enchilada the service was very good and the desert was great. No ""magic"" ""gravitas"" or ""ambiance"""
Lincoln S.,"Naperville, IL",0,5,,3.0,8/11/2015,"I went here on a Saturday night for a dinner date with my girlfriend, and it was just okay.  They sat us upstairs, and I wanted the fish tacos, but couldn't find them on the menu.  We asked if they still had them, and we were moved downstairs, where they have a much bigger menu.  Strange that the menu was so much bigger downstairs.  The bread was a bit stale, which was surprising, since the restaurant was packed.  The fish tacos were okay, but not that flavorful.  The girlfriend had spaghetti and meatballs, which were very good.  The meatballs were among the best I've ever had.  We shared a piece of white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, which was delicious.  I had a black coffee, which tasted like canned pre-ground coffee, but whatever.  Overall including tip, I spent about $55, which was a little steep for a couple parts being less than great.  However, I would probably go back.  I just feel like there is better food for a better price at a lot of other restaurants."
Kelley S.,"Mundelein, IL",0,5,,5.0,9/21/2014,"The Crispy Chicken Costoletta was SOOOO great!! Along with this, the grilled fish tacos were also amazing! great size of dish and cooked to perfection."
Ritchie C.,"Chicago, IL",0,17,,1.0,2/10/2016,"My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a dinner, which is very rare because we never really go out to eat. He suggested Cheesecake Factory because we were shopping downtown. I've never been to one so I agreed. Very strange experience, I didn't understand the decor. I guess its like Moroccan under a big mushroom. Not sure, very dim and dated. I thought it was an upscale place, but they serve water in a plastic mug and offer generic american food. We ordered a pizza and burger and shared. I didn't know something so basic could end up so wrong. The pizza had literally no cheese and tasted like it was frozen. The burger was the worst. the bread was so hard I bit down and thought I chipped my tooth. The processed cheese seemed like it was left out for days and harden. I just took everything off and picked at the meat. We ordered a cheesecake which was great, but didn't make up for everything else. They should probably spend more time on the quality of the food than the decor, I'm sure they're just banking on tourist coming through and eating once. I don't think anyone that lives in Chicago actually dines here. Doubt I'll return."
Mark M.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,1.0,8/30/2014,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!  Will never come back!   Unfortunate as the food was actually better than other Cheesecake restaurants.    Service recovery was even worse than the original service - the next morning I wrote a complaint email to corporate, later that day I received a call from a manager who couldn't find my receipt (10 minutes on hold) in spite of my providing my entire meal as well as servers name.  She said that she would call back.   That was more than a day and a half ago.   Never again for us!"
Samantha M.,"London, United Kingdom",69,624,71,5.0,4/28/2014,"It was in Chicago we were introduced to the Cheesecake Factory. Oh my goodness! I can't rave enough. In many desert places, the main meals are somewhat average. Not so at the Cheesecake Factory. The burgers, the fries, the salads.... all delicious. And then the Cheesecake....! The first time we went, we had a cheesecake each. Whoops. No one told us we weren't supposed to! We walked out feeling satisfied but stuffed full of richness. We went to the Cheesecake factory 3 more times while we were in America. Never again did we get an individual cheesecake but each time we shared one, it was still just as delicious as the first time."
Melliza S.,"Redwood City, CA",3,23,,1.0,8/12/2013,The hostess said 5-10 mins for a table of 2. We got called 20 mins later only to find out our table is taken. This server have to go back to talk to the hostess to get us another table to find out again that the table is not ready and he wants us to wait again! My goodness! There are plenty of table around! We have been to other branches and we never  experienced anything like this. This place SUCKS!
Adam J.,"Washington, DC",1411,253,700,4.0,6/25/2013,"I don't typically visit Cheesecake Factory in any city. They're usually in mall plazas, extremely crowded, extremely loud, and the wait is outrageous. However, this location just happened to be on my stroll back to my hotel following trying out a new bar, and I was hungry, so location sold me and I gave it a shot. As expected, it was loud when I first entered, crowded, and she quoted us about 45 minute wait. Blah. But alas, there was a 2 person table top available in the bar area so we quickly went for it. Our server was at the top of his game, extremely attentive and friendly. Cheesecake factory has a menu probably too big for it's britches, but fortunately today we ordered a few of the items this location has learned to do well. The food was hot, not great but definitely good, and who doesn't love the portion size. We ordered cheesecake to go, which as usual was fantastic."
G W.,"Chicago, IL",0,36,,5.0,1/18/2015,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory at least 30 times.  It is delicious (as are all the the locations)!  They are always extremely busy so at times, service does get very slow.  However, food is always delicious.  I always get the Santa Fe Salad which has dressing to die for.  The prices are going up a little too much, though, and the serving sizes are going down, especially in the cheesecake slices.  It used to be a much better value, but the food is delicious.  I gave it 5 stars to counter all the unfair 1, 2, and 3 stars that it was given.  However, taking into account value, I would only give it 4 stars."
