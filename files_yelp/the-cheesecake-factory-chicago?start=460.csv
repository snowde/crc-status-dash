Jim K.,"Chicago, IL",64,171,,2.0,7/1/2012,"So, about every 6 weeks, possibly out of boredom, laziness or stupidity, I try this Cheesecake Factory.  I'm pretty much disappointed every single time.  The food is generally either quite bland (Chicken Parmesan Sandwich), or overpowering (Spicy Meat Pizza).  Some of the food is passable, mostly the apps like the Fried Mac and Cheese (which is best shared or risk ruining your appetite) or the Buffalo blasts.   Unfortunately, food wise, that's the good news... The tomato, basil, and cheese pizza was soggy (like fall off the crust soggy) and the Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" were dry, and trying to eat them was like attempting pound down charred bark mixed with broken glass, and the included mashed potatoes were the consistency of kindergarden crafting paste.   So, the one good thing that is constantly good about this Cheesecake Factory is the service.  The waitstaff is typically always upbeat, regardless of how busy the place is.   So, given the opportunity, skip it.  The foods expensive for what you get, regardless of portion size.  Plus, there are far better eateries within a block of this place."
Nicole W.,"Baltimore, MD",34,33,4,1.0,9/16/2013,"I was on my way shopping and tried to convince my boyfriend to go to The Cheesecake Factory because from my experiences in other areas, they aren't ""that bad"". I should've just kept walking! To preface, I am NOT a picky eater nor do I like to complain at all. Went in, sat near the bar, he ordered a Fat Tire (bottled) and I ordered a Goose Island Draft (the 32 oz). Since we were sitting near the bar, I sat and watched the bartender pour my draft which just foamed up. All foam. Top to bottom. Guy just left it there. Server came by and said they had to switch the tap so I said, ""Sure, as long as I can get a new beer and not the one sitting there."" He agreed and eventually I got my beer. But, the issue was, the bartender decided to just ADD to my foam that had been sitting there as foam slowly turning into beer for 15 minutes. The beer was rather warm and nasty. Server came back, I asked for a new beer, and received new beer somewhat correct (the bottled beer was WAY colder than the draft beer). By then it was after my apps came out that I finally received my beer. It was 20 minutes to receive a beer. It was also very weird that when I went to tell my server about the beer all I had to do was say ""excuse me"" and he goes, ""Is your beer warm?"" like he already knew.... For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Tacos. They brought out shrimp then came back with the correct ones after saying that I ordered chicken. Bit into the tacos and started to wonder why they tasted funny. Turns out the taco shells were stale! Told the server, and the poor guy just can see it and feel it.... the look on his face. Thankfully he comped the tacos because by then, I really did not want to eat there. The people were nice but it is rather clear there is something wrong with their managers (a bartender who can't pour beer and a kitchen that can't keep taco shells fresh).  I say go anywhere -except- there. TL;DR: Ordered beer, got warm foam-beer. Ordered tacos, got stale shells."
Mark L.,"Rochester, MI",27,139,48,4.0,5/15/2012,"Yes, this is definitely a tourist trap. Does that make it any worse for wear? No way!  I came here with a party of 4 on a crowded Friday lunch hour. I was pleased that I only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table because when I saw the brouhaha inside I was assuming at least a 30 - 40 minute wait. Once seated, we ordered a few drinks, strawberry and raspberry martinis, both incredibly tasty. As a guy, by social pressure and choice, I don't usually order martinis but I was on vacation, so I gave in and was not disappointed. They make 'em pretty strong so be prepared for a nice long meal. At lunch, be sure to look at the specials in addition to the normal offerings. The menu is so expansive that it took me several minutes just to order a drink. Once our food arrived, I heard only compliments about each dish: ""This pasta is glorious!"", ""I thought you could only get jambalaya likes this in Louisiana!"", ""It's like every food I like is partying on this sandwich!"". Stuff to that effect. And of course, we had to order at least one slice of cheesecake, chocolate mousse. It was so rich that one slice was enough for the four of us, given the delicious meal we had just eaten. If you're in Chicago, tourist or not, the Cheesecake factory is worth a visit."
P W.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,,1.0,8/8/2015,I will never eat here again for the second time I was served sub standard food  at the place
Couri T.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,3,2.0,8/3/2015,"I'm a fan of CCF, but today was not the best experience. Got to the bar after navigating my way through the lobby of tourists. Sat at the bar and was greeted immediately by the bartender. Order a Titos Vodka with cranberry and a fresh lime. The lime never made it on the glass. No big deal I would survive. Decided on the grilled fish tacos. By this time my glass was empty! Gave the bartender my food order with the hopes that he would notice the empty glass. No such luck today. I give it a few minute more and finally I ask for a refill on the Titos. Again no lime! Fast forward 20 minutes and still no food. I notice a few people who came in after me getting food, so I ask are the tacos coming soon? ""yes I sent someone to check on them."" the bartender replied as he turn to a passing server and says ""hey can you check on grilled fish tacos?"". About four minutes later a runner appears with the tacos. I dig into the black beans n rice, and they are luke warm at best. Okay you got me. They were cool at best. I attempted to eat the tacos, which were flavorful and well presented. I picked one up and the tortilla fell apart and the fish was cold. Warning! These tacos had been setting under a heatlamp for sometime getting cold and saturated with moisture. If I had more time I would've waited for them to fix the dish. Unfortunately I was meeting a friend at another location so my quick dinner turned into a ""I wish it was a better experience"". The bartender sends for the manager and this took forever. Finally he (manager) arrives, but the bartender had left to find him. The who's on second scenario. Long story short I recieved no apology from tha manager and he seemed annoyed that his system that clearly failed me created more work for him. Ad I mentionef I'm a fan of CCF, but I will stick to the suburban locations. They seem to care more."
Kate S.,"Memphis, TN",0,13,3,3.0,11/27/2012,"We went to this place last night and it was packed to the max! We were told that we would be waiting for approx. 30 minutes, which ended up to be 50 minutes. The good thing was that we were given a beeper, so we could go outside to take pictures in front of Christmas tree and the little train installation at the second entrance. As at every Cheesecake Factory, the menu was extensive and it took me another 15 minutes to decide. The Avocado Egg Role was as expected delicious, particularly with the sweet sauce it comes with. The Hibachi steak I ordered was decent, so were the wasabi mashed potatoes. Everything a little unspectacular, but we didn't expect more from a chain like this. However, the selection of ice creams was a bit disappointed, but once ordered the Godiva chocolate brownie sunday ice cream thingy, it made up for it in size. It could've fed two tables actually. At the end we ordered two cheesecakes, the low carb and the banana one, and they really were the highlight of our breakfast table next morning. All in all, our waitress was friendly and casual, the food is decent, the selection extensive, but nothing special. The waiting and the place being so packed, was not great though, to say the least. Just order some cheesecake here and take it home to enjoy with a good movie. P.s. Don't take your date here! Although the lights are dim, there're more romantic and private places. At least the girl at the next table did not look too impressed. Don't think the guy will get a second date."
Heather L.,"Des Plaines, IL",67,245,44,4.0,10/31/2011,"What can I say, I unapologetically love this chain of restaurants.  I have been to this location and the one in Schaumburg.  They are consistently yummy with fast friendly service in a semi-upscale room making it an excellent option for a Mom looking for a Ladies Day bite to eat with her eight year old BFF daughter. I have twice ordered the Thai lettuce wraps which are incredibly difficult to eat but the flavors are so good, I love them.  Yes, your hands will be sticky but just ask for a wet nap and they provide you with warmed wet linen napkins.  Very nice, thank you very much.  The lettuce wrap is colorful and fresh and light but filling.  It comes on a large platter with piles of julienned carrots, chopped cucumbers, cilantro, marinated chicken pieces, bamboo shoots and three Thai dipping sauces, the peanut butter chili sauce being my favorite. Of the three cheesecakes I've had on my last three recent visits, Chocolate Reeses Peanut butter cheesecake, Red Velvet cheesecake and Chocolate Candy Bar cheesecake; the Red Velvet was definitely my favorite.  The other two being just a bit too dense and rich even after fresh salad. The decor is whimsical and fun but also warm and inviting.  The service is efficient and friendly.  The gentleman here was a little goofy but that worked for us.  And they make a nice old fashioned."
Marie R.,"Chicago, IL",25,9,6,3.0,4/28/2014,The food is pretty good but the service seems to get worse each time I visit. Even when it's not too busy the service is still slower than expected.  Some of the seats are a little too close for comfort.  Probably better to leave this place to the tourist and just get the cheesecake to go.
Andre W.,"Chicago, IL",419,1624,226,4.0,4/30/2009,"They have earned one more star from me because yesterday, my girl's parents came into town and one of the things on their agenda was the Cheesecake Factory. We got there around 5PM and for the second time out of all the times I have been there, there was hardly anyone there (I know to just show up during the week instead of the weekend).  We all got cheesecake and my choice was my all time favorite, The Key Lime Cheesecake and it was great as usual!  We all had martinis. The three of them got Cosmos and even though it wasn't on the menu, I got a French Martini (love those). One of the best French Martinis I have ever tasted in my life (true story!). My girl and her parents have never tasted a french martini, so I let them taste mine and the next round were all french (They are hooked now!) Service was awesome and for the first time ever I used the bathroom in this place and it was really nice actually. Good times, good company, good drinks and good cheesecake! Well deserved extra star Cheesecake Factory!"
Raquel G.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,2.0,7/27/2015,"I literally signed up for Yelp just to write this review.  I've ordered pick up from this location about 5 times in the last month and every single time something was wrong.  The first time I walked home with the wrong salad.. the second time I learned my lesson and checked the bag( I had the wrong salad again).  The third and fourth time the salad was missing ingredients but I'd already walked home.  And tonight, I got home and realized they gave me the wrong dressing.  I know they probably don't care about quality control because this location is so popular, but be warned!  Check every single takeout item closely before you walk away!!"
Jessica S.,"Chicago, IL",74,240,3,4.0,10/14/2011,"My boyfriend had a gift certificate to the cheesecake Factory that we finally decided to take advantage of. Now, usually a big chain like this is not my style but the waitress was SO warm and attentive and the cheesecake was fantastic (the Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake was delectable) that we may decide to go back.  A touristy spot for sure, the large palatial dining room is kind of cool. Cheers to cheesecake!"
Lara Z.,"Chicago, IL",14,11,,2.0,12/18/2011,"I'm all about supporting local restaurants, so The Cheesecake Factory pretty much epitomizes my nightmare restaurant. The first time I visited this chain I had to wait about 50+ minutes or so to be seated, which strikes me as a ridiculous wait time for a chain restaurant. Will I wait 50+ minutes for a table at The Aviary? Absolutely. Will I wait 50+ minutes for a table at the Cheesecake Factory again? No way.  To be fair, the Cheesecake Factory does, well, as you would imagine, have decent cheesecakes. I tried the Godiva cheesecake and well you can't go wrong with anything that has Godiva chocolate in it. Yet in general, the size of portions is simply off-putting - someone described it well in a previous review - it's like they're yelling ""AMERICA!!!"" in your face x20. I have a tough time eating that much in one sitting, and I usually have a large appetite. Also, I hate low ceilings and overly crowded places - so The Cheesecake Factory is really not my cup of tea. Perhaps go once for the experience but no need to make it your regular spot, there are far better (local) restaurants in Chicago!"
Javier Q.,"Chicago, IL",70,70,1,1.0,4/7/2011,"This review is not about eating here but working for Cheesecake Factory. I was excited to work for such a big company and show case my skills as a cook. I learned about 20 items for the particular station, but the only main skill would be is BE EXTREMELY FAST. More of an intense labor, I didn't feel respected as an individual, but treated more like a number, or a robot of some sort. Breaks here DO NOT exist, you would work your whole entire shift without a break. I felt extremely bad for the employees who stayed in the back and rolled silverware all day without being offered drinks or food. I remember working 14 hours, and ONLY having a 30 minute break.  May I add that the pay is not good, I did expect more of Cheesecake Factory to pay their workers more money than a ""slow commercial restaurant"" As fast-paced and POPULAR this place is, PENNIES are giving to their employees for all the hard work they do on a daily basis. I'm sorry but the owner's of Cheesecake Factory seem to be very selfish and find it RIDICULOUS to not pay employees for holidays. You expect ME TO WORK ON CHRISTMAS DAY WITHOUT getting paid more? HA! You must be joking! This place is not worth applying nor working for. If you enjoy being a ""ROBOT"" go ahead and work here. This place was by far the worst place I ever worked for, my voice has to be heard as I don't allow big companies not appreciating their employees for all the work they are doing to keep it running. REMEMBER, if it wasn't for the worker's there, there won't be no successful business as the worker's are the one's that bust their behinds for the pennies that they get because the Owner's of the company are very selfish individuals that don't care about no one else but themselves.  And some advice, DON'T come bring your family when it's very busy  here as if the food falls onto the floor they will pick it up and put it right on your plate. They simply have no time to make a brand new order.  This is simply my opinion, and freedom of speech."
Corinna L.,"Westville, IL",1,8,,1.0,12/7/2014,"Was here on 12/5/14 around 4 p.m.  Only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated, which was the only great thing about this experience.  The waiter was very friendly, but needs to up his game.  My friend had to ask for a paper napkin and lemon for her tea several times before he finally brought it.  However, he was very good about refilling our drinks when they were low.  My appetizer (mozzarella garlic bread-not great) came WITH my meal.  What?  I had the cheese pizza.  I was not impressed and I LOVE pizza.  My friend had the veggie burger and said it was not good at all.  French fries were pretty good though and so was their double cheeseburger with bacon.  However, I found their lemonade the most delicious lemonade I've ever had.  I could have drank a gallon of that stuff!  But overall we decided we will not be coming back here."
Ashley C.,"Chicago, IL",11,491,108,2.0,9/29/2009,"If it was only their star cheesecake being rated, it would be a solid 4 of not 4.5 stars, but the rest of it just doesn't stack up. I find this place hard to rate because it varies so much. I've had some experiences better than others.   I do love their cheesecake and will pay the $6-7 for it.  I normally always get the Strawberry because it's classic, but this time I ventured out of my comfort zone and got the White Chocolate Blueberry. Amazing!  Somehow when people visit, they always want to come here since no one has been.  If it is going to be a chain, I'd prefer this one over others. We went for a late lunch is to avoid all the tourists (at 1:45 it was still busy but no wait).    Their service (2 stars)... is medicore. This past time it was okay, but the waiter seemed rushed to get us out. When you want to enjoy lunch and good company, the last thing you want to be is rushed . There isn't enough staff for the volumne that they get there.  The food was decent. I had the BBQ Chicken salad which was pretty tasty although it could have been more favorful.  The dressing was good but the greens were too plain for what you pay for. I did not like that some of the lettuce did not seem as fresh (NOT GOOD).  My friend ordered the pasta carbonara and really enjoyed it.  Had the food not been on the pricey side, I'd probably get 3, but for that, the stuff should be more than decent. I should no better though since it is on Michigan Ave. Overall, I would definitely go back for their cheesecake.  Most likely, I'd eat elsewhere and get it to go."
Blanca S.,"Chicago, IL",31,17,23,3.0,12/22/2013,"I have very mix reviews and feelings about the Cheesecake Factory. This review is for the downtown location which I visited this past week. We grabbed lunch around 12 o'clock so we waited a tad few. No biggie. Mind you I could see that the restaurant wasn't at full capacity, but I digress. Our server seemed very heavy footed and I could feel him reading me like a book. As if he somehow knew these two Mexicans weren't going to tip him the appropriate amount compared to his more sophisticated white tables. Turns out he was just a flat out horrid server. He did these super long pauses between dropping off drinks, bread, appetizers and taking our lunch order. Last time I was here the waitress was so helpful. She told us about the soup of the day the specials and even recommended her favorite dishes. So friendly and attentive. Total opposite from my most current experience.  He didn't tell us anything but the soup of the day. He said the sod was clam chowder and that it was the only soup available in a very harsh monotone. As if saying we better not even think about wanting something different or else. Yikes. We started off with stuffed mushrooms and the crab bites. This day the mushrooms had a funny taste, sort of like old mushrooms. They didn't taste fresh which it why I usually order them. The crab bites are always delightful. Very crispy on the outside but moist on the inside.  When dinning at The Cheesecake Factory I usually get the pasta carbonara. The sauce in the pasta is very delicious. Very very calorie filled but very delicious in deed. Peas and bacon, How can you go wrong?  I decided to try something new. The Shepard pot pie screamed my name. Mushrooms, carrots, squash, ground beef, mash potatoes , yum! The dish was very savory. I really wish it had some sort of pastry crust. That would of definitely brought the dish together.  I forgot what my bf had. He liked it. Something Cajun maybe I can't remember. Ha.  To quickly sum my experience up I had a nice lunch for the exception of our server. I only saw him hovering over us when he wanted us to pay the bill. Made me not want to return to that location in particular. But who am I kidding. I just won't sit in his section. If only I remember our waitress name :((  Ps. The cheesecakes are out of this world. My all time favorite is the banana cream followed by the Godiva chocolate one. Oh god.. I'm getting hungry."
Michael B.,"Washington, DC",136,150,2,5.0,10/27/2012,"I love this place, very good food and generous portions.  Service a bit slow though.  I had a blue cheese BLT burger, amazing, with a salad.  The salad was just ok, probably should have changed it up.  The entree salad was nothing impressive.  The shepards pie is good.  We had a few drinks, not bad, and to go, we left with some cheesecakes which I am always a fan of. Recommended.  5 stars because of its food, portions, price and cheesecakes.  However, not 5 star service."
Jason H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,15,2,2.0,5/3/2015,"Food was great; had the chicken parm sandwich and Chris' Outrageous cheesecake. Everything else, not so much. Fork was dirty. Salt shaker had a sauce or cream of some kind from whomever handled it last. Noticed food all over the floor in the dining area. Bathroom was a mess, towels all over the floor, in the sink, trash can was over flowing. Server kept saying he'd get us some bread which never came. Dining with a co-worker so we split the check. Check was split incorrectly. We both paid with credit card, somehow between our table and the register the cards were switched so we were charged for each other's meals."
Parker K.,"Wellesley, MA",5,107,25,5.0,3/15/2014,"Excellent service, tasty food.  We came here just for drinks and dessert but still got great service.  The bread was tasty as usual and the cheesecake (red velvet for me, chocolate tuxedo cream for my spouse) was incredibly moist.  The pina colada (with whipped cream, per our request) was also great."
Evelyn O.,"Chicago, IL",16,3,12,5.0,9/4/2013,"Satisfied every time I go to the cheesecake factory, the waiters/waitresses know the menu and explain it to you very well in case your in the mood to try something new from the menu."
