Kevin C.,"Boston, MA",57,58,3,5.0,4/25/2014,Tonight's dinner was perfect! Ahi Tartare small plate and Skinnylicious Steak Medallions with reduction (no wine sauce for me). Best part - Julie who took care of me and rocked it out!
Juliana R.,"Chicago, IL",67,352,35,2.0,3/29/2012,"I probably would not come back, I guess I never realized what a tourist attraction it is here.  It was an hour wait to get a table and no one told us we could just walk on over to the lounge and get a seat right away? Our server was quick and friendly and I was happy he get out out of there so fast but the food was not really worth the wait."
Michael V.,"Toronto, Canada",25,89,38,4.0,8/9/2011,"I really wish the Cheesecake Factory came to Canada.  Talk about a place that wants to stuff you.  I think they should start with the dessert menu first then the main courses.  No matter what I order I get a ton of food.  I think the next time I go, I am going to share my dish with my wife... and son... that's how much food they give.  I ordered the Kobe burger and it was divine.  Such tender meat patty... I am drooling as I am typing.  Overall, this chain is very good.  They treat their customers well and the food is great for the price."
Deepti D.,"Miami Beach, FL",45,42,45,5.0,4/2/2014,"We love right across the street so have met lots of the severs here, but none was better than our service today with Darien W! He was so attentive, polite, and fast! I feel like every time my soda was half way done he was already ready with a refill. He was also very friendly!"
Jules R.,"Chicago, IL",0,18,,1.0,7/26/2015,"Giving this place the benefit of the doubt and a second chance was a mistake. The food is decent, it's not the greatest but what's worse is that it takes 45 min to an hour for the food to come out. On our first visit they forgot my entire order and made us wait for 35 more minutes on top of the 45 we had already waited. On our second visit they had over cooked my food so they apologized and brought another dish out. The last straw was the fact that I found a shrimp tail in my steak dish from someone else. I'm so disappointed with the way that this business is run. It is extremely disorganized and it's a shame that this location makes others look just as bad."
Justin P.,"New York, NY",0,11,,3.0,9/22/2012,"I would like to start by saying the food is pretty good and they definitely give you generous portions for reasonable prices.  The staff is attentive and friendly which is especially impressive when you consider how much of a zoo it always is. However,  the interior is in need of a serious renovation as it looks closer to an indoor jungle gym than a restaurant.  I have seen other Cheesecake factories that have a classy and modern decor while maintaing a upscale vibe that they are going for.  The location is in the middle of Magnificent Mile and is always packed so be prepared for some serious waiting. Pro-Tip:  Keep an eye-on the first come first serve bar seating where we have been able to snag a table within the first 15 minutes of arrival."
Jennifer T.,"Chicago, IL",4,144,6,2.0,7/27/2011,"What happened to you, Cheesecake Factory? The last few times I visited this location we've had a few problems.  One, you have to wait way too long for take out.   My usual navajo has been dry and made with one small piece of chicken.  There's more shredded lettuce than chicken.  They ignore requests like ""no mayo"" even though it's on your take out receipt and they forget to give you your cheesecake.  Thank goodness we called and made them aware that we paid for the cheesecake but didn't get it.  They took it off our credit card and said if we came back they'd give us a free one.  That was the best thing about the meal which shouldn't be surprising I guess since it's called the cheesecake factory. I'm disappointed though.  I don't ever suggest that one should go to the suburbs but if you want to know what a Cheesecake Factory should really be, you should head to Oak Brook."
Krati G.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,3.0,7/6/2013,"I just loved the Blueberry mojito!! I haven't had a better mojito before. Rest, the food was alright (I am vegetarian). The portions were too big for a medium sized person."
Justine M.,"Chicago, IL",31,512,140,2.0,7/17/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a tourist attraction. Although they give you big servings, it's not worth the price. The food also lacks creativity and flavor. Our waiter was horrible. He would passby and drop off our food/drinks without stopping to talk or engage. Not a fan."
Jonathan R.,"Chicago, IL",71,58,,4.0,3/30/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. The orange chicken, the chicken madeira, the honey wheat bread...it's jt all so tasty. The Michigan Ave location is almost always crowded on weekend evenings so your best bet is to put your name on the list, but camp out near the bar and sit down when you see people leave. Sometimes you should even think about sitting before they've bussed the table...just to make sure you own that spot. Oh yea, the cheesecake is pretty good too."
Russ D.,"Forest Park, IL",24,127,,2.0,4/26/2014,Eh...it was fine.  I would eat here again out of convenience but I wouldn't make a special trip.
Jennifer W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,2.0,3/22/2015,Cashiers for cheesecake takeaway are completely inept. Took about five minutes for them to take my order and another ten to actually package the cheesecake. If I wanted to waste fifteen minutes of time I would get table service.
Theresa C.,"Naperville, IL",137,427,51,2.0,1/3/2011,"I was surprised on a busy Saturday night (and New Year's Eve no less) the wait for a table was only 45 minutes. My friend and I decided that Cheesecake Factory would be a perfect base for our night of drinking ahead. That's where the pluses end. We must've had the biggest space cadet for a waitress. First it took a long time for her to come over and take our drink/dinner order. But she was forgiven for that since it was so busy. We then get our drinks and a promise that the bread would be right out. Normally I'm not into bread but since both of us were hungry, we were kinda looking forward to it. So here starts the crisis: the waitress comes by three more times to say the bread will ""be right out if the oven."" She then goes on to say how the whole wheat bread is delicious and it's so good but she's still waiting for it to come out. Seriously what the fuck? You don't tell a table of hungry people that the bread is delicious but sorry you don't have any yet. I could really give two rat asses about the bread but it was built up so much, I wanted some. So we were figuring the entrees would arrive before the bread, which they did. And the fresh baked bread? Cold. But wait, I thought it was right out of the oven? My entrees wasn't any better. When I go to CF I usually get the Baja chicken tacos because they're consistently yummy. These tacos were so bland, it wasn't funny. The portions were huge but had no flavor. Such a disappointment because the entree is really delicious when made right. The beans and rice were the highlight of the dish and that was sad. All in all, the service sucked, the place was about 500 degrees and the tables were so close together. Nothing like putting my ass in someone's face when I needed to get out to use the restroom.   The only plus is there's a bevy of hot guys. My friend got a good look at one of the blondes. I unfortunately got a bad look of a guy who shouldn't even be allowed to wear white pants. Boo!"
Meghan H.,"Brussels, Belgium",365,398,5041,3.0,8/14/2011,"We actually come here pretty often due to its great location spack dab in the center of all of the Michigan Ave shopping.  I've always loved the atmosphere of this place--unique (hard to describe)... Even when we come here at the prime lunch/dinner hour and it is packed, we never have to wait too long for a table despite our being a party of five. The service is always great. The complimentary bread is really yummy, especially the darker, oat-wheat loaf. It always takes forever to figure out what you want to order here because their menu is seriously a book. It is sooooo long; they have way too many items. Everything I've ordered on their menu tends to be good although the huge portions make it feel so heavy to me and consequently I feel guilty for eating it even if I only finish half of my plate (which is still a LOT of food).  All of their cheesecakes are WONDERFUL.  I have never had a bad experience there.  Like the size of their meals, their cheesecake slices are huge, rich, and DELICIOUS! After such a huge meal, we're always too stuffed for dessert.  But occasionally we'll order some cheesecake to go--yum :)"
KuangYou C.,"Chicago, IL",49,113,6,3.0,5/29/2011,"This is my second time to Cheesecake Factory, but last time was in San Francisco. It was good because we ordered a lot of food, and of course it cost me lot of $$. This time, my friends and I all had cheesecake and ice cream, but in different flavors. I had the caramel one. It was good but very sweet. I think it goes better with a coffee or tea.  Besides, so many people there during weekends. I think it is better to go there during weekdays to avoid crowds and tourists."
Nickie P.,"Franklin, MI",59,163,1,4.0,4/9/2011,"As everyone else said, expect the wait to be long, but well worth it. We were able to find a table near the bar, so we didn't have to wait too long.  I have to say that we had a good meal and great cheesecake! We all loved the corn tamales appetizer, my dad loved his cheesesteak sandwich, and my salmon was great. My mom and sister really liked their steak, but wished it had been a little bit more tender.  Huge portions! After from stuffing all that food in my face, we took our cheesecake to go. Every cheesecake I've had from there is great, but my favorite is the original with strawberries on top. If you can't deal with the noise and the wait in the restaurant...at least grab some cheesecake for the road!"
Nari H.,"Chicago, IL",376,663,700,4.0,10/9/2011,"Reasonable prices for what you get - good portions, quality food and good location (minus the parking) and it's almost always busy :) Favorites are: Angel Hair pasta with Shrimp and Kobe Beef burger (hits the spot) Tips: Can be a little loud. Visit the John Hancock Signature room on the 96th floor for drinks and an amazing view afterwards!"
Mohan R.,"Columbia, MO",12,156,11,5.0,11/14/2013,"After running around Chicago, we were very hungry. Choose this place and did not regret it one bit.  Even though it was super busy and wait was a little longer than I liked, the food and the service was worth it.  Had an excellent burger, and that made up for the wait."
V.i.o.l.e.t.t.a. D.,"Chicago, IL",40,66,14,5.0,12/3/2010,"My boy and I came in around 8:15pm waited forever to be seated; one hour and forty-five minutes (all well worth it in the end). We were celebrating our friend Ashley's birthday and our waiter, I wish I could remember his name, was fabulous :] (all I remember was that he was a shift manager, blonde-ish) Anyways, I ordered the garlic noodle dish with pine nuts, asparagus, and Shitake mushrooms.  I didn't care for the mushrooms, kinda wished they had been 'bellas and I didn't even get one asparagus tip, just the stems....BUT, it was still amazing so I didn't mind too much.  For dessert my hunnie and I shared a strawberry cheesecake....heaven on a spoon. Per couple expect to pay $50 at least. (two entrees and one dessert)"
Robert B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,49,,1.0,4/2/2013,I hate my friends and family because they insist on Cheesecake Factory every time they vist from up north I live a block away from it and I'm cursed because this place sucks. I still have not found an edible item on there HUGE menu. LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME!!!! This is the Fort Lauderdale location I speak of.
