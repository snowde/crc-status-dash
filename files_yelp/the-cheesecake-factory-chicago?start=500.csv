Liz T.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,6,1.0,1/1/2014,"Review based solely on the turkey burger: worst turkey burger I've ever had. Mushy and horrible taste. Only thing good was the bun. They also put grilled onions on it which made it even worse. Looking back, I wish I would have had them take it back. Service fine."
Tammy M.,"Greenville, WI",13,18,,3.0,3/9/2014,I did a very positive review the other day after a great lunch visit. We had such a great time we decided on dinner there tonight. Completely different experience. The staff wasn't as friendly. Food was overly salty. I got the petite filet and the outside was charred and burnt. Side choices are poor. No option for baked potato or side salad. Couldn't read the menu because the light above us was burned out. We mentioned it to our waiter and 3 others. One employee said it has been like that for awhile and it bugs her too. Had to wait over 15 min just to get our cheesecake at the end. Bad atmosphere and sub-par service today shows an inconsistency in this restaurant. I lower the rating from 5 to 3. Was a five at lunch and a 1 at dinner. I am averaging the two.
Bob H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,5,1,3.0,4/15/2015,"Food was good, but host stand was hectic. I checked on our table and was told we were next, then after watching more tables go ahead of us I checked again. They had skipped our name again. Except for the cheesecake I don't see why the hype."
Jung C.,"Wheeling, IL",0,7,,4.0,5/12/2011,"I'm not a fan of Cheesecake Factory, but I was pleasantly surprised by this location. Service was great, food presentation was great, and the food itself was really delicious. I tried two different pastas, and I really liked both of them, especially the Chicken Chipotle Pasta which I thought sounded okay, but tasted pretty great. As expected, the place was crowded and loud even during a weekday dinner. My only complaint is the level of loudness and it was much too dark for me- I wish they had lit up the place a little more. All in all, great food, great service, a little lacking in atmosphere."
Courtney W.,"Brandon, FL",1213,580,84,3.0,12/3/2012,"This place is like tourist central in Chicago. It's below the Hancock and people just can't help themselves. Personally, when I travel to a city I try to eat some of the food that has made it famous or is unique to that location so I don't quite understand the rush to this place but who am I to judge. I've been here and I've waited almost an hour to be seated since they don't take reservations. Unlike other locations, you can stray too far from the bar area or your pager won't go off. It kind of feels like a cave in here since you are pretty much in the ground and the base of the Hancock. They have everything that all of the other CFs have and I normally go with quesadillas or the bow tie pasta chicken dish. It's easy to split something here or order an entree for yourself and be prepared to have lunch for at least a day or two on leftovers alone. The menu here is ridiculous. If you can't find something on it, you need to never eat out again because you will never be happy anywhere. The cheesecake is slightly overpriced but they come in way too many flavors to count. The red velvet is a personal favorite, as is the Oreo."
Karla P.,"Independence Township, MI",0,10,9,4.0,4/19/2012,Nice lite menu.  Really made my trip enjoyable. Good service too. They had Ginness
John J.,"Chicago, IL",12,23,,4.0,2/18/2014,"I only come here for one reason:  Key Lime Pie Cheesecake.  It is the greatest dessert on the planet.  I highly recommend everyone try it at least once.  As for the actual restaurant, I've dined here twice.  Both times, the service and the food was fantastic.  I got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta both times.  It was moderately spicy (not enough to overpower the dish but enough for you to notice).  The only ""downside"" to this place is that the inside just looks...weird.  It's as if you're sitting inside someone's mouth (as the walls all look like tongues).  If you can look past that, I highly recommend this place at least once a year."
Gina V.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,46,3,4.0,6/24/2012,"This place would have gotten 5 stars except the hostess was terrible and the ladies restroom was gross.  When we entered the hostess didn't even greet us. She told us a table (Saturday night at 10pm) would be a 40 minute wait to sit inside or outside. About 10 minutes  later our buzzer goes off for our table to be ready.  Either someone made a mistake or the girl was a big moron. As we were walking to where they were seating us we heard another host tell a table of 2 the wait would be 15 minutes. So I am thinking our hostess was an idiot.   Our server Keith was AMAZING!!!!!  He was friendly, knowledgable about the menu, the food, the drinks!!!  Overall he made our experience that much better. He is what I expect out of every server I encounter. I can not say enough great things about Keith. If you go here ask to be in his section.  Overall the food was good, the fried Mac and cheese was Fantastic. But I mean can you say anything bad about fried cheese and pasta. The entree sizes were huge, but the taste of them was good, they would improve a bit."
Natalie M.,"Washington, DC",160,187,83,3.0,1/23/2011,"I went here after work last summer and the place was packed. The wait for a table was ridiculously long, so my friends and I decided to order our food to go and eat our meals at the tables outside the restaurant.  After flipping through the menu, which was thicker than an issue of the Oprah magazine, I decided to order the crab cake bites and the arugula salad from the appetizer menu. My friends ordered a pasta dish to split between the two of them. Our food was ready in about twenty-five minutes. About 5 minutes more and I would have passed out from sheer hunger. The crab cakes were well seasoned and paired well with the arugula salad. I was still hungry after I ate, but at least I was no longer starving."
Jonathan S.,"Hammond, IN",14,17,5,4.0,6/18/2012,"One of my wife's and my favorite places to eat when we're on Michigan Ave. The food is delicious and they have the best cheesecake around. Their menu is abnormally large, which can be great, but if you don't necessarily know what you want, it can take a while to make a selection. The service is usually very good; however, they are usually always packed so expect at least a 30-40 minute wait. They do not allow reservations after 5pm. We usually get a pager and then go up to The NorthFace or Best Buy above and look around to kill time. The place is a little loud because it is hoppin' so don't expect a quiet environment."
Jenna S.,"Chicago, IL",788,1311,69,4.0,10/7/2008,"Mmmmmm Dulce de Leche cheesecake.  You are my weakness. I like the Cheesecake Factory.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain restaurant.  Chain restaurants can be good, too.  I have no problem with the fact that it's a chain.  If anything, the only problem I have is that it's busy so often that it's almost impossible to eat there without waiting at least 40 minutes for a table.   The restaurant itself is a very nice place.  Classy, kind of dark - a nice place for a date or a fun group outing.  They have a nice bar in the back with first come, first serve tables and a nice place to hang out while you're waiting for a table.   The food is great!  I've never had a problem with anything I've ordered.  I really like their veggie burger, regular burger and all of their appetizers.  I am confident that anything I order will be good because the quality is good and the quantity is unbelievable.  This is definitely a place that provides a ton of leftovers after the meal.   And the cheesecake!!  They have anything and everything possible for every taste.  You can get a slice or an entire cake, whichever you choose.  I've been at parties that have Cheesecake Factory desserts - yum!!  Cheesecake happens to be my favorite dessert, so perhaps I'm biased, but it's fiercely delicious."
Helena G.,"Washington, DC",30,234,350,3.0,8/23/2011,If you are a cheesecake lover this place is for you! They have many types of cheesecake! It's a challenge to choose one piece!  I already tasted a few! My favorite one is the banana cheesecake. I don't recommend the Godiva chocolate unless you are a cocoa addict! Otherwise it can be  too much! I usually share a piece with my fiance and in the end I always feel full!
Julia J.,"Chicago, IL",56,379,1,1.0,10/13/2010,"I think the only restaurant open in hell is the Cheesecake Factory.  My mom and her husband got a certificate and invited me and my husband to join them. So, it was free, and I still don't have any good things to say about this place. Why anyone in the Chicagoland area would go to the Cheesecake factory when you have your pick of world class restaurants at every price level is just beyond me.  The restaurant is a giant, loud, overpriced, disorganized mess...just like their entrees.  Never again."
Erika G.,"Chicago, IL",230,1994,167,3.0,8/14/2008,"The only thing I ever order here is the gigantic Cobb Salad, which I lived large on today and dropped $15 for lunch. It's like crack though, so delicious. Ordered take-out, too much of a zoo to put up with eating in. The outdoor dining area can be pleasant, and at the foot of the Hancock, has some glamour to it. Jordan Mozer's cartoon interior isn't holding up so well with time, starting to show a bit of age and wear. I had such a crush on Chicago's Bad Boy of Architecture in the 80s. His interiors are really imaginative, but apparently don't age well. The bar can be fun, to snicker at the tourists. I only like this place in the winter, 'cos it seems closed in to me, and not a lot of windows, which I don't like. Good place to bring picky eaters, the food is reliably good, but nothing special. My love of giant salads continues unabated, but wow - the service at this place is pretty bad. Don't wait on someone else before you're finished with my transaction, woman!"
Nicole H.,"Chicago, IL",102,521,126,2.0,6/17/2013,"Sooo, I actually opted to go here versus a fancy schmancy restaurant for my birthday last night. What in all the hells was I thinking?!!!!!! I read the reviews but figured it probably wasn't that bad and at least the cheesecake is going to be good. Incorrect on both. I ordered the chicken madeira and steak diane combo and had a slice of caramel apple cheesecake. Oh and also a peach bellini. I can say that the drink was enjoyable, although I suspect it had very little, if any liquor in it at all, and this is from someone who rarely drinks.  The chicken dish was more cheese than dish and the steak was not done the way I had asked it to be. The crab appetizer tasted like toast. The cajun chicken pasta was very heavy but not too bad. The service could have been better. To top it all off they forgot that they were supposed to be celebrating my birthday. Well, it's another spot to add to the list of places I've been too."
Negin J.,"Chicago, IL",18,94,1,5.0,10/2/2011,"You have to wait, almost 45 minutes, but it's worth it. The portions are big, and the brown bread that comes before your main course is out of this world. I ordered chicken madeira which was the waiter's suggestion and it was excellent.  Their red velvet cheesecake is not as good as what you get at Swedish Bakery, but is delicious. You can also buy the whole cake and take it home with you without waiting in the line."
Raymond N.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",86,94,4,4.0,8/30/2011,"Hostess was very rude. The paging system can definitely use improvement. I can't understand why after your pager buzzes, you need to go to another waiting area only to wait some mroe for the table to be ready. The waiter was very nice and professional, which compensated for the rudeness of the hostess.  Place is located on a busy street (Michigan Ave) just under the John Hancock building. It has an outdoor seating area, which is nicely situated below street level for good amount of privacy) Speedy service. My favorite new dish at this time would be the chicken and shrimp gumbo. Great sauce with a generous amount of chicken and shrimp. Pack half of your meal otherwise you will not have room for a slice of their awesome cheesecake.  GET THERE EARLY! I'm talking 5:30-6PM early and maybe you will wait just 45 minutes on a lucky day. A lot of tourists in the area."
Lyndsey N.,"Saint Louis, MO",52,263,267,3.0,7/28/2013,"I went here on a very busy Friday afternoon. I think this location is always very busy and touristy. We were told about a long wait, but gladly we were seated pretty quickly. There was no option of sitting on the patio area, cuz they were not serving out there. It would have been nice to sit outside in the nice weather. I ordered the Little House salad, which is not a regular house salad at all. The vinagarette dressing is supposed to be tossed with this salad but I did not taste the dressing at all. I would not order that again. Of course the Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu so anything would be great to order. I ordered small. Also got the Crispy fried Cheese which is so delicious and sounds simple but a great appetizer! My friend ordered the blueberry cheesecake which was a HUGE piece of cake. The server was very nice and patient with us while we looked at the long menu to order."
Luis C.,"Chicago, IL",65,34,30,4.0,7/14/2013,I never knew that this place had other food besides cheese cake! I ended up here instead of the signature lounge in the Hancock building and sure glad I come downstairs. This place had good food just a bit overcrowded and managed incorrectly. I would visit again though.
Layda C.,"Chicago, IL",4,92,20,4.0,6/27/2013,Great drinks and dessert ! Our server was amazing . I would ask for Andrew to take care of us again!
