Ashley N.,"Kansas City, MO",22,34,1,2.0,8/17/2013,This food just isn't good. The cheese cake is! But for a meal? nah. 2 stars for the cheesecake.
Annette U.,"Chicago, IL",58,183,25,5.0,4/11/2013,"It was a cold and windy night in Chicago and I decided not to wear socks outside in denial of the fact that it is now spring and should not be below 50 degrees. Since my feet were blocks of ice   guests were ravenous, there was no sense in walking any further from their hotel and I settled on The Cheesecake Factory for our dinner. I am usually against chain restaurants, but The Cheesecake Factory is an exception. I'be eaten here before many moons ago and while on vacation in Florida, and it always seems to be that guilty pleasure. I had the Moroccan chicken, husband had the cashew chicken, guests had filet mignon ans humongozoid Caesar salad. Also tried chicken samosas and stuffed mushrooms-both were delicious! Raspberry lemonade cocktail also amazing! Guests had the cheescake which is a bit rich for me-get one to share among your group."
Brittany S.,"Hampton, VA",4,141,5,5.0,10/6/2013,"I'm an avid Cheesecake Factory fan! I have been to a few different locations and will continue to eat at these restaurants. My mom and I got in to town late and strolled in to eat at Cheesecake Factory at 10:30 p.m., our server Brittany was so nice and very helpful. She genuinely cares about the people she serves which made the experience great. I had my favorite dish, crusted chicken romano, yummmmmmm. And we finished off the night with a slice of smores cheesecake, so rich, but so yummy!"
Kathy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",515,440,120,4.0,6/26/2008,"Ah yes, Cheesecake Factory...I would come here more often except for my love affair with its sister restaurant Grand Lux.  (Sorry CF, I still love you...) I remember my first time going to Cheesecake Factory and seeing Jerry Springer with all his crazy groupies...that was quite interesting...especially since, for a couple minutes I couldn't put my finger on why ""that guy"" looked so familiar (Please don't look at me in disbelief...I didn't watch the show). Anyways, I instantly fell in love with the avocado eggrolls...delicious!  And to this day, I always make sure to order it when I frequent CF.  Another default of mine would be their chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta (FYI, Grand Lux has this too but with rice instead).  For dessert, I love their chocolate tuxedo cheesecake...it is absolutely scrumptious.   People think that Grand Lux is a tourist trap but I don't know, Cheesecake scares me more in terms of that.  I think it has to do with the fact that it's in the Hancock building."
Lauren T.,"Chicago, IL",183,25,15,5.0,6/15/2013,"I come here from time to time and I am always satisfied. My experiences with the waiters/waitresses are mixed with good and bad but we are not going to get into that. The portions are huge. I usually go for the Shrimp Scampi pasta or the combo with Shrimp Scampi and Steak or fish. You cannot leave here without trying at least one dessert item. My suggestions: can't go wrong with the plain strawberry cheesecake, but if you want to try something new try either the Red Velvet cheesecake or the carrot cake or the strawberry shortcake. My new favorite cheesecake Craig's Crazy Carrot Cheesecake."
Victoria G.,"Seattle, WA",159,41,5,2.0,6/30/2013,"Not a fan! This is more commentary on the service than the food. My cousin and I came in on a Saturday night and it was packed, so we sat at the bar. We had been seated for at least five minutes and were never greeted, but the bartender Leah greeted customers beside us who sat down after us. When we finally flagged down the other bartender, he was nice enough, but neither seem very concerned with providing any kind of service. The mojitos were bad and way too sweet and while the food was good, it took 15 minutes for the cheesecake we ordered to come out -- why? Don't you just slice it? Hopefully sitting in the main areas provides better more attentive service for customers."
Rishabh A.,"Mountain View, CA",56,23,2,4.0,5/28/2011,Food is great... But very large portions... I and another friend shared an   entree and we ordered appetizers as well.. it was enough for both of us.. Otherwise a nice place to visit. But make sure you have reservations before hand as we had to wait for 45 mins on a weekend night.
Brendan B.,"Birmingham, MI",0,2,1,3.0,1/11/2015,Service slow.  Chili super salty and served with no spoon.  The kids loved their pasta except for one of them the Alfredo was not very appetizing and he felt nauseous after eating it. The cheesecake at the end was fine but served without forks (??!!&$@!)
Kwoky L.,"San Francisco, CA",163,634,65,4.0,12/4/2010,"With a location right under the John Hancock building, this Cheesecake Factory is probably the busiest one that I've been to. Every single time when I walk in the door, this place is close to full house. Now, is the food really THAT good? It's decent enough that picky me would want to be back here in the future.  I've been here on several occasions, even for my own birthday. I like how extensive the menu is. You have a variety of items to choose from and their taste was consistently good. Not particularly inventive or avant garde, if that's what you are expecting but the menu is varied enough that you won't go, ""Oh geez, it's the usual burger, fries, and pasta again?"" Yes, not to mention, fabulous cheesecakes. I find them quite expensive, about $5-$7 a slice if I have not mistaken. It's not awesome but again, it's good and there's plenty to choose from. I would recommend the Godiva cheesecake."
Laneka G.,"Chicago, IL",46,242,337,4.0,1/27/2013,"cheesecake factory is always crowded, always. i go here for a takeout slice of red velvet cheesecake its divine"
Cindy D.,"San Antonio, TX",5,22,9,1.0,3/19/2014,"Went here yesterday with my husband. The service was horrible! Extremely slow. No water with drinks served. No bread to the table as you're seated. Drinks, entrees, and meals for my husband and I were served separately. My husband's burger he ordered med. well looked like a charred hockey puck on the exterior, with a bloody interior. The clientele was coarse, and ill-mannered. The 3 individuals seated in the neighboring booth had an occupant who kept shaking her leg. When my husband leaned back to stop himself from being shook, the female reprimanded him for doing so, and started yelling very loud. This was because the bench seat of the booth was so loose, it rocked. There was at least 4 instances where the crashing of dropped dishes/glass ware hit the floor, and we witnessed one couple with a small child crying because one of their wait staff had bumped into where she was seated, and dropped water all over her. I wouldn't eat here again, even for free. If I could rate this a negative 5 star I would."
Joe B.,"Chicago, IL",0,24,,1.0,6/25/2014,"My late wife and I had eaten at Cheesecake hundreds of times after Cheesecake opened in the Hancock. We worked late night. So it was a great place to dine on quality food. When our daughter was born, we stopped going, and later, we went to more neighborhood restaurants. But last night, because we were out after 10,  I decided to bring my ten year old daughter to a place where her late beloved Mommy and I shared so many wonderful meals and times. As we left, my daughter asked me if Mommy and I had considered a divorce. Wow! Has this place gotten awful. The place had all kinds of open tables in rooms where people were seated. Yet we were told it would be a five to ten minute wait, which turned into fifteen minutes. The wait was the best part of the meal. It is clear that the staff culture has fallen off the cliff as witnessed by a group of staff members exchanging inappropriate chit chat/salacious gossip by the coffee bar despite the fact that we were within seven feet  ear shot.  Then there was the food and service. When we sat down, my daughter immediately spotted a dirty bread plate, for which I pointed it out to the server. It took five minutes, but eventually he replaced it. Never got regular water despite my request for it. (Hey. I am not interested in refilling my much smaller than it used to be Virgin Pina Colada.). Waiter took our order separately. Why I don't know. And then there was the food. My Tuna Ahi was the worst meal I have had in over ten years. It was the worst piece of tuna I have ever encountered in my life. I am truly ashamed of myself for having eaten it---such shame I have not felt since 30 years ago when I picked up a sweat hog at 2:00 am at Katzenjammers a long since closed Lincoln Park bar and spent the night with her. (And yes. That was the last time in my life when I ever got drunk.) And then came the fin de sicle--the cheesecakes. Not that bad. They seem to be a little lighter than they were, but they were OK. But the waiter (""Houdini"") should have sensed that all was not well when I ordered my check to come with the cheesecakes. Plain and simple. Corporate needs to clean house and start with a new crew from management on down.This place has stage four cancer."
Sherry C.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,3.0,9/19/2011,"This used to be my absolute number 1 place to go, and for years I went every Sunday night without fail!  They're menu is so extensive and they have everything you could possibly want!  The service is usually quick and efficient although they can get pretty slammed. So I go here after about a year's hiatus and I notice how SMALL the portions have gotten!  My boyfriend and I shared the spinach cheese dip, and the dipping bowl was incredibly tiny.  Then he ordered a burger and I had the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta.  I've seen their pasta dishes before, and I'm telling you they must have cut that bad boy by about 2/3rds of what it used to be!  My boyfriend's burger was mostly bread and looked like it came out of McDonalds. This was the first time I have ever left Cheesecake Factory disappointed and still hungry!  What happened?"
Shannen B.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",169,31,9,3.0,11/7/2010,"This place stays crowded.  Every time I visit Chicago I come here and and surprised at how crowded it is, but also how short the wait time is.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table for two.  The place was jam packed.  Our waiter wasn't the best, we had to keep reminding him to bring things, but he was attentive. The menu in this place is ridiculous.  It's something like 15 pages long.  This is going to sound silly, but I wish they had more non cheesecake desserts.  I actually really dislike cheesecake and would have liked to have ordered dessert if they had better choices.  I ended up getting a rather tasty Pasta Carbonera.  All their food is tasty, really.  It's also rather pricey.  I was shocked to discover that my strawberry lemonade was 4.95!  My dining partner ordered strawberry cheesecake and he wasn't too impressed by it.  Considering that Chicago has tons of delicious authentic restaurants this is an ok choice for when you're shopping on the Mag Mile, otherwise skip the trip."
Natalie M.,"Chicago, IL",158,196,138,4.0,6/13/2008,"As a Chicago native, I usually on go to the Cheesecake Factory when a. I have a craving for good cheesecake or b. tourists are in town.  I used to go more often, as I found something on the menu that wasnt terribly huge with an excess of calories-their vegan burger w/broccolli instead of fries, but they discontinued that selection. The four-cheese pasta is tasty(and yes loaded with calories and fat), but anyone going to the Cheesecake Factory knows what they are getting into. I say its nice for a special occasion inwhich one desires tasty rich food......but this is not a place to go to regularly.  I do think Grand Lux has them beat on desserts that are not cheesecake, but I think the food at Cheesecake Factory is of better quality."
An P.,"Miami, FL",1141,712,6373,3.0,2/18/2010,"I guess when my dad thinks of downtown, the first thing that comes into mind is Cheesecake Factory. That being the case, me and a cousin went out to meet him but I was running late due to the latest series of CTA cutbacks. Being late, I hurried to the Cheesecake Factory and entered through the upstairs entrance. The entire upstairs was abandoned, nary a sole and the lights were off with about a dozen or more tables and room to sit but no one manning the door. Getting the hint, I walked downstairs and saw empty rows of seating everywhere for noontime. I knew tourist season was over, but how could Cheesecake Factory be THIS empty!! After walking down through more of the restaurant I found someone who asked if I needed help, I kept on going and found my fam waving at me but was confused as no direct path was available and had to navigate through more zig zags and around the corners. When I sat down, the other table started waving trying to flag down their waiter and made fun that they had finally got his attention. I quickly ordered some  Tropical Iced Tea and we waited for our bread. Eventually the waiter came back and we ordered two platters of fried shrimp and a crab cake appetizer. The food came out relatively quickly and our drinks were refilled but the lunch entrees came before the bread did doh! The food was standard bar food and wasn't anything special in my opinion. It is typical American dining out fare, you will find much of the same at Red Lobster, Appleby's, TGIFriday's, Ruby Tuesday, etc. I kind of lump them all in the same category, nothing especially unique, but still good atmosphere and tasty unhealthy food when you feel like it. Better than Long John's Silver haha!!"
Jeanne H.,"Chicago, IL",5,13,22,5.0,6/2/2013,"Sensible lunch portion, and amazing white chocolate rasberries cheesecake!"
Shradha A.,"Chicago, IL",683,2108,181,2.0,11/11/2008,"I just cannot make myself to like this place - I've given it 3 tried before finally making my decision to put a 2-star on it! This place is the perfect example of chain restaurants gone out of control! Their breakfast is better than their lunch, but still not good enough to make my go back again.  I just feel this place has hollow hype and word of mouth value, more for the ""experience"" of having been to ""THE Cheesecake Factory"" and not much else.  The Boston ones are much better!"
Bob D.,"Chicago, IL",106,364,10,1.0,12/31/2009,"The only thing missing is the cattle prod. Maybe I should be glad this institution is here.  Perhaps I should be grateful for the way the uninformed and main street American types flock to this watered down trough.  It is possible this keeps me from watching people drop ice cubes in their white zin at my favorite haunts. The menu reads like a glossary from a menu text book.  Written by accountants and bean counters alike.   Something for everyone.   Everywhere you turn the ""greatness""  of the Cheesecake factory is shoved up your rear. If they laid claim to giant portions of mediocrity,  they would be right on.  The claims of ""delicious"",  and ""mouth watering"",  fall well short of their promise. Enormous portions are what most people tell their friends about,  this should be heeded as a warning.  These are the same boasts people waddle away from Old Country Buffet muttering.  The business plan is simple,  give the customer a bunch of shiny things to distract them,  over flow the plate with fries,  lettuce and whatever the cheapest thing out there is,  and when they realize how unsatisfied they are,  stick a giant piece of sweet stuff out there,  (which was most likely the only reason you agreed to have this meal),  and guilt everyone into paying for this epic failure of gastronomy. My daughter opted for the strawberry shortcake,  her words were,  ""the cake is hard and dry"".   As for the other foods,  does it really matter,  it all comes from the same feed lot."
Katherine R.,"Chicago, IL",44,159,141,4.0,3/17/2011,Food presentation is lovely such as the veggie burger and fries dish. You cannot have an intimate dinner for two here.  There are people talking all over and you can't hear yourself talk. There is a hollow sound or echo.  The acoustics is not condusive for dinner for two. Yet  the setting and ambiance is cool to look at with all the shimmery copper colored industrial factory.  The views of the Magnificant Mile are pretty nice near the window.   The dulce leche cheesecake is the bomb!
