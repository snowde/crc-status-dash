Lisa B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",297,393,3,3.0,12/31/2009,"Why do people wait an hour or more to eat here? That is the question. My excuse was that I had signed up with a secret shopper organization, and was getting a $40 gift card for my trouble. I figured, I'm reviewing things anyway, might as well receive some remuneration, right? One of the rules was I had to go for dinner at a particular time, and apparently 6:00 p.m. was when everyone in the world came downtown to hit the after-Christmas sales. I was not thrilled to wait an hour for a table, but rules are rules. The nice lady at the hostess desk informed me that the buzzer would not work outside the restaurant. She did not inform me that the upstairs cafe -- with its shorter menu and shorter wait -- was an option.  I had to figure that out on my own. The decor of this place is so bizarre -- the puffy tubelike ceiling made me think of intestines, and all the food moving through them. Ew.  Our service was delightful and the food was not half bad.  I really enjoyed my Cashew Chicken Salad, though I would venture to guess that about half the cashews were peanuts. And the cheesecake? Meh. I prefer Eli's.   People, don't wait an hour for this place, especially if you have hungry, cranky little kids in tow.  There are better places a stone's throw away.  Food Life at Water Tower Place, for one.   FYI -- they take reservations for groups between 2:00 and 5:00 p.m."
Konrad K.,"Chicago, IL",3,18,1,5.0,9/13/2012,I REALLY didn't like it here. Had to wait a very long time to be seated and the stuff seemed very rude to me. I'll never return there even if they paid me to.
Mike D.,"Grand Rapids Charter Township, MI",2,28,3,5.0,4/2/2013,Had some lunch with fam. Great cheesecake. Good bread. Nice atmosphere.  Had strawberry and red velvet cheesecake. All good. That's how we roll ...Jack!
Dorotka K.,"Elmwood Park, IL",26,291,1,3.0,12/26/2010,"The restaurant was super crowded. The place is huge and it looks like you are walking through a maze, but all the tables are so close to each other that it gives you a feeling of chaos.  They do not take reservations on the weekends and we waited for about 25 minutes, which was not too bad. They have a lot of seating available for people waiting for a table, but it literally looks like there are 50 people ahead of you. I was hungry and seeing all those people was a cause for concern. Anyway, we got to sit at a booth and I immediately felt claustrophobic. While the tables are quite large, the seat area is very cramped. We had our winter coats with us and had to hang them off the side of the booth, otherwise, we wouldn't fit comfortably. Our waiter was nice, but clearly busy, but we are not ones to make small talk anyway. Our food took a while. Probably around 40 minutes... I dunno, I lost track of time. The food was a hit for 2 out of 4 in our party. I guess the menu is a hit or miss. By the way, the menu is incredibly long. Most of the items there are 2000+ calories, but if you are not one to diet occasionally, you have nothing to worry about. My choices were limited to fish and salads. We did not have dessert, so I cannot comment on the highly complimented cheesecake. Overall, I wouldn't visit this location again, nor would I visit Cheesecake Factory. I think the money would have been better spent elsewhere."
Anna P.,"Pasadena, CA",78,321,37,3.0,10/21/2010,"I only come to Cheesecake Factory when I am in the mood for...well, cheesecake. And every time I do that, I am very happy and satisfied. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend coming here - this location is strangely dirty and the food sucks and the service is good but it's just not worth it considering all the other options nearby. Stick to what they do best - dessert - and you'll walk away full but happy."
A L.,"Chicago, IL",1,118,12,5.0,10/21/2014,The cheesecake is beyond delicious esp the banana Creme one. They top it with alot of whip cream and fresh banana slices on the side. Their food menu has a great variety. I had a salad with salmon and it was sooo incredibly good. The salmon was chilled and I thought it would be warm but still delicious. Service always great but always a wait to be seated so be prepared to hangout. Love this place !
Rick F.,"Chicago, IL",2335,1041,831,2.0,8/21/2008,"Atmosphere: Cheesey! Food: Standard Theme restaurant fare Service: Lunch SLOW! Prices: Slightly overpriced for the level of service Bathrooms: Clean Server was very formal for a lunch service, zero personality. Took a long time to bring the check. It's lunch! he should have been more cognizant of his job! Food was good! Spring Rolls, Chopped Salad and Edamame! Go for the location!"
Chuck W.,"Raleigh, NC",2,37,,3.0,11/26/2012,"Cheesecake Factory food was good -- always is.  On this Thursday noon, service was very slow. And the place was very, very cold."
C M.,"Chicago, IL",37,206,58,3.0,9/19/2012,"FYI: Despite what the above says, they still DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS (sorry for bold, just something I want people to see). They *might* for very large groups now (they did not 3 years ago), but definitely not just a few people. When I called after seeing the 'accepts reservations: yes' thing (I haven't been in a few years), I was told ""Seating is on a first come, first serve basis."" So they don't take reservations, and the above needs to change."
Julie T.,"Chicago, IL",0,43,4,4.0,1/6/2011,"I was never partial to any of their food, except: Avocado eggrolls.. amazing, crisp and refreshing.  Red velvet cheesecake..I don't even normally like cake, but this was moist and dense. a delicious mix of the rich cheesecake and soft velvet cake. Will not order food from here, but I will detour for a slice of red velvet cheesecake!"
Saurav T.,"Chicago, IL",9,7,,1.0,7/26/2014,"The service is horrible. After taking order and 45 mins later they come up and say - ""sorry we dont have what you ordered."" This is unacceptable. Wish I could give a ZERO star."
Edward E.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,1.0,7/24/2014,"Been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory for many years, but today's experience was horrible. Was told the wait was 20minutes yet we waited over 45 minutes to be seated, followed by another 15 min for our waitress to come take our drink order. To top it off the food was cold. Very disappointed and will not be visiting this location again."
Ryan T.,"West Burlington, IA",9,5,,5.0,3/31/2013,"Oscar was a phenomenal Manager this evening! We had a confusion finding the place and were stressed upon arrival, but Oscar, and our server John, cleared everything up and made us feel like royalty! You can't afford NOT to eat at the Cheesecake Factory at the Hancock!"
Oreo C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",28,179,24,4.0,9/21/2012,Cheesecake factory has never really disappointed me or my gf for all the visits at different locations we've been there. One of our favorites is the Avocado spring rolls.
Jacques M.,"Chicago, IL",89,220,38,3.0,2/27/2010,"Let me first start by saying I'm not big on the whole ""rate chains low"" anti corporate sentiment.  For me good food is good food.  That being said Cheesecake factory has its high and low points.         As other reviewers of have stated Cheesecake Factory offers large portions of standard American fare.  Despite the large portions, I'm still not sure I want to shell out $14 to $16 for Fried Fish, Chicken Fingers, and other easy to come by standard dishes (although I have).  The dishes, while not a great bargain, are always pretty decent (albeit nothing to get excited about). However, Cheesecake Factory (at least this location) features one of my pet peeves. I simply can't stand it when restaurants do not put prices next to their beer. It puts you in that awkward situation (if you want beer), do I ask for the price and look like a cheap skate (especially on a date) or do I risk paying $7 for a bud light?          As far as the cheesecake goes, it is really good. I've had the Godiva Chocolate & Some type of Cookie Dough Cheesecake both came in generous tasty portions. This is the restaurants strong point (hints the name Cheesecake Factory).           The service at this location is excellent. The hostess was very friendly and the server was also friendly and attentive. If you hate tourists (or at least eating with them) don't go here.  Atmosphere is strange in an interesting way (I think it's supposed to be cheesecakes coming out of the walls and ceilings??)              Overall, I give it a solid 3 star rating. I'm not sure I would recommend going here for lunch or dinner (although I wouldn't say avoid it either), but definitely a great dessert spot."
Nichole M.,"Chicago, IL",165,431,38,4.0,8/4/2010,"Um, it's a chain so don't get your hopes up, but they do have some delicious cheesecake.  So, this is a 3.5. The menu is extensive, meaning each dish is going to be mediocre.  I like their sliders, thai lettuce raps, potstickers and wontons for appetizers.  Their main dishes are always just ok.  So if it were my choice, i would go here and just get a bunch of yummy apps and not bother with the main courses. Why the main courses are ""eh.""    1- The portions are disgustingly big.  And you wonder why America has the most overweight people per sq mile?  When I get my plate of food, I immediately feel sick.   2- The seasoning and flavors of things like the sauce on the pastas or the marinade on the chicken just isn't all that flavorful.   Their cheesecake is always good and if I liked dessert, I would be in heaven here.  But I like food, real food."
Rhonda G.,"Chicago, IL",255,880,4,2.0,7/31/2009,"So, when you think of cheesecake factory do you get visions of oompa loompas running around with some weird dude in a hat making all sorts of cheesecake?  OK, me neither. So we're on the same page.  Everyone knows what the cheesecake factory is and yet some of us still go (don't judge me). I have a friend who had never been and i'm sure going was on her ""must do before I die list"" so we went.  The cheesecake is quite good and they have tons of different ones (snickers, ahem). BUT the food is absolutely terrible. The one in schaumburg had better food and that isn't saying much. I ordered pasta and it was undercooked and crunchy, the sauce was watered down and it was flavorless and gross. I immediately asked to order something else and the staff was very nice and accommodating (read: I don't think they spit in my food).  My new order was a turkey burger and while it wasn't gross it just wasn't much of anything: turkey and buns...no WOW unless tomato and sad looking lettuce is their idea of wow.  If you can order the cheesecake to-go then please do. The food is really not worth it and there are better places within spitting distance of this place. Seriously."
Rob M.,"Overland Park, KS",159,309,1,4.0,8/13/2012,"This location of Cheesecake Factory, located at the base of the John Hancock Tower, must be a gold mine for the company!  It's absolutely packed all day long.  We decided to give it a try after a long day of sightseeing -- it's only a block from our hotel.   At 7:45 p.m. it was still crowded, but the wait was only about 20 minutes, and they have plenty of places to sit until your buzzer goes off.  Service was a little spotty when we first sat down -- the table wasn't completely set and the coffee I ordered was just lukewarm.  But things improved rapidly after that.  Our server was good about bringing anything that was lacking, including more bread and a new pot of good, hot coffee.   We split the ""appetizer"" size Caesar salad -- it's merely humongous.  NEVER order the full size Caesar here, unless you've brought along the Mexican Soccer Team to share it with you (the salad was invented in Tijuana, so it's not Italian, despite the name and ingredients)!  My BF ordered the wild mushroom burger, which came with a more-than-bountiful fountain of fries, and he just loved it!  I ordered the carbonara, made with fettucine instead of spaghettini, and it was good and filling but a bit blah, flavor-wise.  The sauce needed to be cheesier, I think.  True to form, it was an enormous portion that I couldn't finish.  We wrapped things up with a slice of their chocolate coconut cheesecake, which came with two giant dollops of whipped cream.  The cheesecake was dense and rich and coconutty, on a chocolate crust.  We finished about half of it and brought the rest back to our hotel for a midnight snack.   All in all a pretty good experience.  Cheesecake Factory is good for basic kinds of foods, mostly well prepared, with a rather wide variety of choices, so it's especially good if you're with a group that's not quite sure what it wants!  Entrees are certainly more than large enough to split.  The cheesecake, of course, is excellent and available in many, many flavors (the Godiva chocolate one is total decadence).  Service is good, and prices are moderate to pricey, depending on what you order."
Dantee A.,"Chicago, IL",81,109,19,4.0,12/16/2009,"I expected slow service, average food, and overpriced drinks when I took my family here to eat  at this ""tourist-tastic  place - I was right! So why the 4-star review?  There is a charm about this restaurant on how it handles tourists, ridiculous requests (""make my latte 105 degrees please"" - the table behind us), and the apologetic wait-staff.  It's very humorous watching the wait-staff handle these situations - they are very tolerent and should be rewarded for their patience.  I would recommend coming here for dessert during a restaurant crawl of some sorts.  One cheesecake is enough for two people.  Just order a cheese-cake and two coffee's and your set.  Sit at the bar too - they have a nice bar menu just in case you don't want to wait."
Dan C.,"Chicago, IL",0,39,,1.0,2/12/2011,"Here's the deal, to be upfront.  I have never been to this particular Cheesecake Factory, although I have been to a couple others. That being said: Don't go here, especially if you are a tourist!!!  You are in CHICAGO.  This is a foodie city.  Go to a restaurant you can't go to in any suburban mall in America.  Every time I go past this place there are throngs of people waiting an insane amount of time for mediocre food they could get when they go home. That being said, go ahead and pick up a piece of cheesecake to take back to your hotel room.  The cheesecake is actually pretty good."
