Michael K.,"Pasadena, CA",37,73,1,4.0,7/30/2012,"I love this place!!  I've been to several Cheesecake Factories in different cities and never had a bad meal or a bad experience.  Wanna know what's good?  EVERYTHING!!  They're notorious for their huge menu which people describe as a ""book"".  The only issue might be that depending on when you go, you could be waiting over 40 minutes for a table but if you drink, that time will pass quickly if you wait at the bar.  I HIGHLY recommend their Passion Fruit Mojito.  IT'S UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!!  For their food, I recommend their Crispy Taquitos for a appetizer and their Kobe Burger is delectible.  Their salads are HUGE but delicious.  I can go on and on, but I'm sure if you go, whatever you order will be good."
Emily T.,"Ferndale, MI",6,70,,3.0,4/1/2010,"When my friends all insisted we eat dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, I thought i'd be going to a cafe and getting a sandwich and cheesecake. But it's a full restaurant, with a full bar. And I sure didn't expect to get drunk there either.  We  waited a loooong time to get seated,and sure the place is trendy, touristy, and the food is sub-par. But the atmosphere was nice, I had a lot of fun there and our server was very nice and didn't give us crap about splitting the check. I split fish and chips with a friend, and splurged on strawberry martinis--they were strong and delicious! The place burned a hole in my pocket, but everything is expensive in Chicago.  Oh, I didn't even try the cheesecake. It's like $7 a slice. I'll get my dessert in Detroit, thanks."
Andrew T.,"Chicago, IL",46,255,17,4.0,1/4/2010,"Do not come in here expecting a light meal... I highly recommend the Ahi Tempura appetizer (flash fried goodness!), zucchini sticks w/rance and for entrees the bistro shrimp pasta and sunrise fiesta breakfast burrito - the tomatillo avocado cream sauce is very tasty. The burgers are also great... Leave room for cheesecake!"
Pat E.,"Winfield, IL",91,739,71,5.0,5/30/2010,"Huge portions, at the bottom of the John Hancock! I had one of the best burgers ever here! I can see why this would be a top spot for an average tourists, and I am from the suburbs! The design of the place is AWESOME! GET CHEESECAKE (Oreo)!"
Lindsay A.,"Midland, MI",4,33,58,5.0,10/10/2010,"I should be embarrassed to like this place as much as I do since it's a chain, but I can't help it. Everything I've ever ordered here has been good -- drinks, food, cheesecake -- and the servers are all quick, polite and attentive. And, considering the Michigan Avenue location, the prices are good (at least for the food; I've always thought the slices of cheesecake were a little overpriced). This makes the Cheesecake Factory a typical stop for me during any trip to Chicago. My ""usual"" is the lunch-sized (but still gigantic) Chinese Chicken Salad and a slice of cheesecake. Godiva chocolate is my favorite. On my most recent visit, I tried the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Not as good as the Godiva, in my opinion, but definitely not bad."
Angelica M.,"Franklin Park, IL",0,2,,1.0,7/11/2014,"I honesty hated the service I got, the waiter would never come to see if we needed anything. We had to call him every time. He took 20 minutes just to go get my cheesecake, which is already made so I don't know why it would take so long to bring it to me & I also ordered for more bread & he ignored me & never got it for me & payed for it. SUCH A BAD SERVICE, DONT RECOMMEND."
Jessica B.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,20,,4.0,8/5/2010,"The Cheesecakes are marvellous! I ordered a red-velvet cheesecake last friday and it was awesome, although you'd certainly need more people to help finish it up, since it's very fulfilling. Kudos for the cakes! I had fettucine alfredo with chicken too, and it was just as i expected, simple, creamy and smooth! (Beware of the HUGE portions!)  The waiter was REALLY friendly and quick!! Great service overall!! The only dissatisfaction I felt was because it was too crowded on weekends.. So if you were going merely after the main courses, I'd say the wait was not worthwhile."
Elyssa H.,"Seattle, WA",0,86,,4.0,3/15/2010,"I had a delightful dinner here solo.  I was seated in their bar area, but at a table.  The server was attentive, the meal was good and served at the proper temperature, and she made sure I got that second beer.   The food is the same anywhere in this chain.  Again, I was pleased."
Jon B.,"South Holland, IL",41,40,16,4.0,6/22/2010,"Just a Fun Place: It's a fast paced restaurant with great service. They offer HUGE portions. They have the largest salads I have ever seen. The drinks are good, even if you prefer non- alcohol, but the best thing of all is the CHEESECAKE. The deserts are fresh and the variety seems to be endless. The service is great and the prices aren't bad either. One meal with appetizers for one comes to about ranges $20- $30"
Stephanie W.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,1.0,3/20/2013,"UPDATE: On my last visit with my boyfriend, after reheating food we had wrapped to go, he found a fried octopus in with his chicken sandwich. The octopus definitely was not there when we were eating at the restaurant, he opened each little sandwich to put the lettuce on, so someone had placed it in there when wrapping the food. Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable, will not be returning, and the manager only offered to replace the sandwich with another if we brought it back to the restaurant (which was not happening even if there wasn't a blizzard at the time. Huge menu! And a great selection on their""skinny"" menu for healthy options. I had the asparagus salad which was cooked perfectly. The taco wrap appetizer was difficult to eat since it's all stuffed in a piece of lettuce but was delicious.  Very nice staff as well and great prices (you won't spend $10 on an appetizer which I like)."
Rita W.,"Chicago, IL",0,18,,1.0,3/13/2013,"Although I like their cheesecake a lot, I feel the waiter in the restaurant is not professional. The service is bad. I almost had an argument with the manager. I won't go to that store anymore, and I believe there are other great dessert stores out there anyway."
Ed A.,"Chicago, IL",242,261,1,4.0,9/6/2009,"The cheesecake factory was very good. I know, I know, many of the reviewers on Yelp have a repulsion towards corporate chains. Sometimes, I feel the same way. But good food is good food. Located in downtown Chicago, it is an easily accessible and affordable place to grab lunch or dinner. Yes, it is touristy, if that also includes suburbanites. But the service is always great and I have yet to be let down by anything I have eaten.  The avocado egg rolls are outstanding! I could do without the decor. And, I don't like cheesecake. But besides that, the Cheesecake factory has solid food at reasonable prices for downtown Chicago."
Katie K.,"Chicago, IL",29,153,5,3.0,5/1/2012,"For a chain, this place is pretty good.  I think the place is a little pricey.  If I am going to be paying that much for a meal, I'd rather go somewhere that is not a chain, but that is just me.  The food is good, I had a chopped salad and it was very fresh, fresh.  The cheesecake was quite tasty too. It was overall a good experience.  This place is a tourist trap, so be prepared for that, I suppose."
Joe X.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,219,4,3.0,7/22/2012,"The food at Cheescake Factory is a 2 but we had good service here.  The menu is confusing, there are too many options.  They should cut the number of menu choices in half and raise the quality of the food to match that of what they do best: cheesecake."
Tj M.,"Flanagan, IL",2,169,176,4.0,7/14/2012,"We dined here one evening while staying in the gold coast.My girlfriend wanted to try this and I was up for it as it looked nice.This is in the basement of the john Hancock building. We sat in the lounge area and it was a trendy and different place to dine. The menu was real big and they had everything and the pops that they brought were in big glasses.With everything they had we actually just got the grilled cheese as that what we had a taste for.It was gigantic and we could not even finish it,it comes with a lot of fries too.Of course there cheesecake and other desserts our there too, but we were full.We thought this was a good place to eat and I think you'd enjoy it here. You can dine inside or outside in the patio area."
Jessica W.,"Redford, MI",1,16,1,5.0,9/17/2012,"So for my birthday, a couple of friends and I decided to take a road trip to Chicago. Best idea yet. We will be back soon. Anyways. The first restaurant we decided to dine at was the lovely Cheesecake Factory. Although it seemed busy, we were seated in a matter of minutes. The inside is dim but very nicely decorated and a lot of seating. We sat down, looked at the menus and... wow. Pages and pages of items to choose from, it was a booklet. We ordered our appetizers, I believe three of them. Holy cow they were good! As a seafood lover, I was pleased to see so many dishes available, and the prices were reasonable. No complaints about the food quality whatsoever. Next, dessert. You haven't seen a desert menu until you've looked at theirs. You will need more than a couple minutes to pick one or two out. Our cheesecakes were absolutely delicious, and we were beyond full. As I mentioned earlier, prices are reasonable, so our checks were average.  The next time we come to Chicago we are definitely dining here again!"
Kitten F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,1,4.0,4/23/2011,It's a chain but I love it and I especially love this one. Great service and scrumptious food plus cheesecake of course! I recommend the Red Velvet Cheesecake! Deelish!
Josh H.,"Chicago, IL",4,9,,2.0,11/13/2010,"The food and cocktails were excellent but the service was inexcusable. We waited over an hour to get a table which was fine, however when we were sat we waited an additional 10 minutes before we were even noticed. The sever asked us if we wanted water and then brought it to us after another longer wait. It got worse after that. He was inattentive and dismissive from then on. He never introduced himself or went over any specials. When we had planned to order 2 appetizers, but after my girlfriend ordered hers, the server ran off before I could order mine, and before we we could order our cocktails. We ordered our cocktails from another server because we could not get the attention of ours, when they were brought to us one was wrong.  The server alone made this night one that I wish to forget, he cost himself at least $30 in sales due to the appetizer ordeal, not telling us about the specials (we overheard another server explain that Clam Chowder was the soup and we both would have gotten that had we known) and it taking so long to get our cocktails. I reluctantly left him a 10% gratuity, but he did not even deserve that."
Cristaldo P.,"Crown Point, IN",6,27,59,4.0,6/30/2010,If your undecided about what to eat. You won't have this problem at the cheesecake factory. There is huge menu to choose from. Portions are large so if you have a big appetite this is place to go. Make sure to try out the Cajun jambalaya pasta it's a tasty dish. They have a variety of cheesecakes and desserts. The coconut cheesecake was good but I like the classic cheesecake the best. The service at the restaurant was good despite crowded atmosphere. Don't come here if you want a nice quiet dinner. This is a fun lively atmosphere to hangout with friends and family.
Megan M.,"Chicago, IL",0,34,,3.0,7/14/2014,"The food is always good, the service is usually sub-par. I had a really awful experience here once, but decided to go back because my boyfriend likes it. This time around the staff was very kind but again, slow and MIA most of the time."
