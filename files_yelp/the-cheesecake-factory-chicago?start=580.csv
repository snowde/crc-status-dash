John C.,"Floyds Knobs, IN",1,20,6,1.0,12/19/2011,"This place is dirty.  The floor was greasy, the menus dirty, the wine glasses grossed us out, and don't even look under your table.  The guy working thing host stand when you come in was actually rude.  There were a couple of workers there that really tried, but they are setup for failure.  Mgmt should be ashamed at the condition of the restaurant.  If the FOH is that way I don't want to think about the kitchen.  We will never go there again."
KT P.,"Winnetka, IL",0,10,,1.0,8/1/2011,"I came here this Saturday against my better judgement to meet a friend.  I work downtown in the area and all the locals know to avoid this place.  It was AWFUL..  1.5 hour wait turned into 2 hours.  When we were seated at 8:30 the floors were so greasy and slippery I almost fell.  The service was rushed yet slow.  The people watching is almost as scary as the food quality.  Even the pizza my boy ordered was undercooked and greasy.  To top it off, 30 minutes after I left I had what I will describe as a large gastrointestinal disturbance.  I am not kidding.  I am not bitter about the last thing that happened to me, in fact, I thought it was a rather humorous and appropriate finale to a terrible restaurant experience."
Glynis W.,"Chicago, IL",15,21,,4.0,6/27/2012,Always a good restaurant selection when visiting North Michigan Avenue!
Bill M.,"Chicago, IL",1890,1486,2524,4.0,8/12/2005,"This part of the chain at least has a plum location at the foot of the John Hancock Center, with a cool design too. The menu is massive and should have something you will like, though it may be harder to find something that you will love. It's a busy place, though waiting in the Hancock plaza is not necessarily a bad thing. I guess you have to order the cheesecake, whether you can finish it or not."
Gayatri D.,"Dallas, TX",27,114,7,5.0,3/22/2010,"Two words - Strawberry cheesecake :) Our average Sunday brunch turned into an afternoon well spent at the factory. The food tastes good, the servers are friendly and it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. For all those who don't like the massive portions or the mediocre food or the chainy touristy feel of the place ... go elsewhere and save the rest of us the 20 min wait to get a table. Thank you!"
Maria H.,"Chicago, IL",317,291,256,5.0,5/1/2007,"It's touristy but still a nice place to eat.  I really like the atmosphere and the restrooms especially.  It wasn't a long wait at all to get a table.  The server brought us some delicious bread that I kept ordering.  I would've just been satisfied w/ that.  I thought that the server was one of my favorites in a long time.  I tried remembering his name but unfortunately I couldn't think of it.  I had the ""little"" chicken tenders w/ a side of mashed and I substituted the corn for mac n cheese.  I got back this huge portion which I'm glad that I have leftovers for today.  I really wanted to make room for the cheesecake but I couldn't seem to stop eating my entree.  I love it that I can enjoy food and a good conversation and of course a funny waiter."
Roman M.,"Mesa, AZ",11,42,5,4.0,5/1/2010,"As far as chains go, I like the Cheesecake Factory. They have about 99 items on the menu.  It doesn't matter what kind of food you're in the mood for, they have it.  What makes it a good place is that it seems to be very consistent.  i've eaten at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants all over the country and not one of them has ever struck me as  'out of place'. Pick the kind of food you like, order, sit back and enjoy. My personal favorite is the fish tacos.  Tres yummy. Oh, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Red Velvet Cheesecake...  Oh my. What sets this location apart is all of the hammered copper inside.  It creates a very cool vibe."
Liz K.,"Chicago, IL",6,270,219,2.0,3/1/2012,"Going to the Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday night, I thought, finally I'll be here once when it isn't over an hour wait to sit down and I'll be able to enjoy my meal because it won't be so crowded! Well, we didn't wait for an hour, and it wasn't crowded. But we did have a group of 15 and apparently that waves a giant red flag for them to lower the quality of service. For a restaurant that consistently deals with a packed house on weekends, I was disillusioned to see that they couldn't keep up with our table on a practically empty Tuesday night. And it's not that our expectations were unreasonable, either; the things that I expected (greeting within 5 minutes, water glasses for everyone, drinks within 10-15 minutes, food to get to the right people) were completely within reason, in my opinion!  In terms of food, I was just underwhelmed with my dish. I got the Stuffed Chicken Tortilla, which comes with black beans, corn cakes, and sour cream. To me, that sounds like a Mexican/Hispanic dish, and I was looking forward to having some strong flavors come at me...but it was impressively bland. Not even more than a few shakes of salt could bring out an ounce of flavor. Really disappointing. I will give them one positive note, however, and it's that the cheesecake was wonderfully light yet rich. I got the Dulce de Leche variety and it was just fab. While I won't be back here to dine in, I would have no problem with dropping by to pick up a slice or two to enjoy at home."
Evan L.,"Chicago, IL",4,158,,4.0,3/8/2011,"food good, service good. I love this place because it was never redecorated same copper sculptured walls from the late 60's which are a work of art. It's nice when some things dont change I miss tha Gold Lion, Xanadu, Adolphs , Mel Markons, Don Roth's Blackhawk and whatever that restaurant was next tto the Chicago Theater. I'm done ranting. Thanks for reading. I remember now, it was Fritzels"
Chris D.,"Chicago, IL",0,152,,4.0,8/15/2012,Took my team for lunch here. Truly enjoyed the time there. Great team building afternoon. Server was fantastic. No excessive wait. Food was typical your Cheesecake Factory dishes and everyone seemed to get exactly what they wanted. Nice job! I have no complaints here.
Erin G.,"Chicago, IL",0,18,,2.0,7/29/2012,I like to come here occasionally...love the small plates and Banana Cream Cheesecake but last time I was here I couldn't believe how the service was...don't know if I'll go back.
Dawn H.,"Castle Rock, CO",23,255,9,3.0,12/5/2009,"Pros: Great cheesecake. Great food (especially the avocado eggrolls and Thai lettuce wraps).  Cons: Horrible wait. Every time. To make things worse, there's no where to wait. You're stuck obstructing the path of those arriving, those leaving, and the servers. Very claustrophobic experience....but what else do you expect from a chain restaurant on the Magnificent Mile?  Worth visiting once per year. Enough said."
Trinidad F.,"Maywood, IL",200,113,4,4.0,3/28/2009,"The interior design of this place is interesting. I'm never sure exactly what in. It looks like the inside of a pie to me. Anyways I'm giving this place 4 stars for super customer service, cheesecake and the size of the dishes!!!!  The last two times that I've been here were got the same waitress and she was awesome! I asked questions and was modifying my drinks and she never had an issue with it. She was just super friendly. You rock MISSY!!! Normally I just come for cheesecake and drinks. The first time I came I checked out the Caesar salad.  I only ordered half and when it got to the table I almost flipped out. It was huge!! It looked like a full salad to me but it wasn't. Great! The taste was OK. Needed more croutons. The dressing was a little on the light side. Now to the cheesecake...ITS SO YUMMY!! I'm committing a sin just thinking about enjoying a slice of Oreo cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream...mmmm. The cheesecake is always good here and I've never been disappointed. I always have to get vanilla ice cream on the side because the cheesecake a just a little to rich for me to handle without some cool and creamy. Great place for dessert!! Awesome service and everyone who checks this place out needs to try the Oreo cheesecake!!!! YUM!!!"
Alicia P.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,1.0,2/13/2013,"First off I'd like to say I do not use yelp and signed up just so I could explain to the public and the restaurant how awful this experience was! This was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  We went mid-afternoon to the Chicago cheesecake factory.  It was 4 friends and myself; the service was awful.  The male server serving us (I cant remember his name he had blonde longer cut hair, his name started with an F and it was a foreign name) was completely rude the entire meal and didn't even give us the time of day.  From the drinks to the bill I was disappointed.  We are in our mid to late 20s and locals.... We were out shopping for the day and ready to get some drinks and yummy food.... He sold us one drink each and when we drank them right away he came around took our dirty glasses, said nothing and walked away.  You would think a server would ask if we would like another drink.... Not only is that GOOD service but it would increase your bill as well??  He answered all of our questions rude and some questions couldn't even answer and said things like ""I don't know"".  Being a Chicago restaurant manager myself it took a lot to ignore this situation...  I tried hard.   However when our food all came out at different times, items were cold, the server was MIA for the entire time and the server never cleared anything besides the ONE drink order I was fed up.  I get very upset when I have a bad meal and even more upset when my friends are not enjoying their meal especially when we are PAYING CUSTOMERS!   I then decided I wanted to talk to a manager...  The manager was rude too!!  He said sorry however did nothing.  I told him ""If this was the restaurant I worked for this server would no longer have a job... I am not trying to get anyone fired but it's clear he has no respect for his job!""  The manager replied ""What can I do for you"" my reply was ""Nothing!"" and walked away.  The experience was already by far ruined!  And what type of management team member says ""what can i do for you?""  Your a manager sir and your job is to make sure your staff is doing a great job and giving customers the correct experience; if this fails then it is your job to embrace the customer, take in any problems and help assure the customer this was  fluke and would never happen again.  It is your job to make sure that the customer leaves happy and understands that the performance was unacceptable and engage in correcting rather than asking what the customer needs....  You know what we needed.  And you failed to do so.  There for you have now ruined a dining experience for your customers - one that actually could have been saved at that very moment.  Every place has bad staff members and its moments like this where a manager has the opportunity to a) correct and coach said employee of b) replace said employees with a staff member that wants their job and enjoys the service industry.   At the end of the day the food was sub-par since it was cold coming out at all different times, the server was the most awful - not only server but human I have ever interacted with and the manager should reconsider his life path.... Maybe consider a field where he actually isn't in charge of individuals and sits behind a desk and doesn't have to deal with customers.   I will add the only good experience was the bartender while we were waiting for our table.  It took him a long time to come over to us however once he did he was very pleasant and engaging....  Maybe they should consider moving him to management position or hiring more employees like that rather than Francisco or whatever his name was!"
Gailmarie W.,"Country Club Hills, IL",174,24,7,5.0,5/23/2012,"Visited after Windy City Live this morning! Wonderful server, even better food! Fun,fun,fun!!!! I'm SUCH A HAPPY CAMPER!!!"
Dave S.,"Hickory Hills, IL",593,1203,15,3.0,12/30/2008,"I made my first visit here on a Tuesday night in the middle of a blizzard. we figured that there would not be much of a wait and not be all that busy. When we got there, we were seated right away but when we left, the place was packed.  I have never had the opportunity to visit this place before even though I have lived here my entire life. Now that I have visited it, I most likely won't make this place a destination for me but I won't boycott the place.  The decor here is some of the cheesiest that I have ever seen. (No pun intended. Cheesy is the only word that comes to mind when thinking about this place. I think we were in a bad spot because it was really dark by our table.. It was dark enough where I was having difficulty reading the menu. When I went to the restroom, I noticed that the entire place did not seem that dark.  Our waitress, Kristina, did an EXCELLENT job. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly and sociable. Everyone we came into contact with was very friendly also.  The food did not really impress me as i thought it would. we started out with the fried Mac-n-cheese. Which was good but really didn't wow me. For my main meal, I had The Romano crusted chicken with pasta. Once again, it was good but it just did not wow me. I was pleased with the portion size that I received. They did not cut corners on the portions.  Now it is time for the cheesecake. I was looking forward to the dessert because obviously, this place is known for the cheesecake. I had the key lime cheesecake and it was delicious. Overall, I would not wait in line to go here, but it was a solid experience."
Anaher B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,148,,4.0,2/20/2014,"I've been here a couple of times. The first time I ever went I had an amazing time, seating, service and food were all great!. The second time it could have been better since the seating and service were not up to par. I do love the cheesecakes!"
Mags F.,"IL, IL",5,19,,5.0,8/18/2009,"Is it bad to love a chain restaurant? Because I love this place.  And it's occasionally fun to be a little touristy.  The food is consistently good (at every location I've been to). The portions are huge so I usually have leftovers for lunch the next day. And, the cheesecake is awesome. I have liked some menu items better than others, and I usually order one of the same handful of entrees. But it's great for a group or picky eaters because there is such huge variety on the menu. And though the wait is long, we can usually grab a table in the bar area pretty quickly."
Steve K.,"Chicago, IL",0,38,,3.0,9/23/2011,I DON'T THINK THIS LOCATION EXISTS ANYMORE.   Not sure why someone posted a review for June 2011.   (As I have to give a rating I am giving it 3 stars similar to the average existing rating so it doesn't skew things.)
Bev R.,"Holly, MI",4,13,,4.0,6/27/2010,Great food. Very excellent service considering the crowded restaurant. Each dish was put together well and tasty. Chocolate rasberry truffle. Cheesecake...YUM!!! On a side note floors were slick and restroom size were inadequate to handle patrons.
