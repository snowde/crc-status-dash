Arlene M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",79,40,2,2.0,12/2/2017,"Avoid this restaurant. There's so much more good food in Chicago! We had a quick lunch when we arrived in town because we were starving and hadn't gotten our bearings yet. It was fine, but super slow. I assumed it was a fluke. Tonight we went in just for dessert... You know, because that's what they're named for. It took over 20 minutes for someone to speak to us, then they said they'd rush the kitchen for us since we'd been waiting. They brought out a brownie sundae with almost frozen brownies that were stale tasting. It was horrible. We sent it back and said we'd just take the hot fudge sundae. By the time we got it we'd been in the restaurant an hour! And it was utterly mediocre. How do you screw up a $9 ($12 with tax and tip) hot fudge sundae? Well, start with a tiny, tiny amount of hot fudge smeared on the glass to make it look like a lot. Pour in a couple of tiny, tiny scoops of ice cream and a ton of camouflage whipped cream."
Jeremy W.,"Crystal Lake, IL",70,1,,1.0,2/22/2017,"TOURISTS DONT GO HERE! I am not a tourist but I wouldn't want someone from out of town to think this is how Chicago is. You know how you think people only review when they've had a bad experience? No--This place is truly horrible. All of the other reviews are right on.  The restaurant was half full the whole time we were there. Its pretty simple actually- we sat down, no one came to take our drink order for about 10 min. Finally an older lady took our drink order. 20 minutes went by, she ran by almost laughing, ""I'm sorry, I'll have those drinks in a minute, I just spilled something on myself...."" ???? Then we waited another 15 minutes and decided to get up and leave. She was walking up with our drinks, and as we were leaving she said, ""Ohhhh come on!"" As if we had done something wrong. I asked the hostess if we could speak to the manager. The manager came up, ignored us and started quietly talking to the hostess. The hostess mentioned to the manager that we wanted to talk to him. He looked at us and continued talking to the hostess. We just left. It was really bizzare. I felt like I was in a parallel universe. It just ruined the evening. But they don't care because they don't have to."
Harpreet S.,"Irvine, CA",6,6,,1.0,7/9/2017,It is pathetic place. We were first placed a table that could fit just 2 people and then when we got the table it was highly unhygienic. The person cleaning the table used wet cloth with no disinfectant and then he used the same hands to give us cutlery. The table also had wet spots.  We went with 2 kids and we were told there was no kids menu and they served my kids with adult glasses. I warn people who have families please go at your risk of health
Thomas T.,"Chicago, IL",47,125,,3.0,5/2/2017,"Well, it's the Cheesecake Factory. If you were looking for a very unique dining experience, this isn't it (although I've yet to receive a definitive answer on the vaguely anthropomorphic decor. Is it mushroom-inspired? Turkish? Honestly so many of the big wall coverings look like giant tongues and elbows and whatnot). The steak is always good. The cheesecake, without debate, is excellent too. This place tends to be super crowded, though, so be ready to wait at the nearby mall."
Denisse M.,"Chicago, IL",32,54,57,2.0,10/13/2016,"First of all this place has a weird deco, it looks like the Flintstones live there!! It looks like a cave and it's very dark. I don't get the whole concept of it. Our waitress was super nice but she had so much tables to attend she nearly came to check ours. I went with my husband and my younger to celebrate his 10th birthday, you will think an over priced place will at least give a free dessert for the birthday boy!, nope you had to buy the stupid cake so they can sing happy birthday. Our waitress told us they don't t do anything for birthdays at least you buy the cake -_-. I think if we are paying $15 per plate at least they could be nice about it and give him something. After she gave us our check she came out with a Sunday for my brother, ok that was nice of her but it was a slap on the face. There was no nearly any ice cream and it's was topped with lots of heavy whipped cream.  Now that's what you call cheap, my brother even started to cry when he got that nasty ass piece of shit ice cream. Now for the food I had the meatloaf, it was good but a bit salty, my younger brother has the pizza now that was the only good thing of the things we order. My husband had the burrito it tasted like chipotle not good sigh!!!! We had a nasty experience will never go back!! I don't recommend this place to any tourist and I live here!!"
Nafeesah A.,"Chicago, IL",97,434,36,4.0,2/26/2017,"I came here with a friend who treated me to lunch and I swear their dessert just took me to another level.....I had carrot cake and my friend had the salted caramel cheesecake. Not only was dessert good, but our pizza too was delicious. Carla was mine and my friend's server she's really friendly and always checked on us if we needed anything and she was also very fast with getting stuff situated. It's best to go during the week when it's not really crowded because the spring and summer months are when there's increased traffic coming into the restaurant. They do have outdoor seating only during the spring, summer and early fall months(while it's warm outside) Overall the experience was great and plan on doing it again soon!!!!!!"
Meli O.,"New York, NY",165,113,582,4.0,9/18/2016,"Oh my goodness I love this place: perfect location, yummy cheesecake at a really convenient price (7.5, and we are talking about THE cheesecake, people!) a huge menu with options for every taste bud, ridiculous huge portions (everything, no matter what, is for sharing), nice staff! I can go on and on. But please, do yourself a favor an ask for the dulce de leche cheesecake and simply enjoy! It's amazing, soft, creamy but the flavor is mild and perfect. I think I will come back tomorrow just to eat another slice of that mana from the heaven. The banana fresh is also good, but... Dulcce de leche!  The only cons I find is that the decoration looks like a huge Vgg, if you know what I mean, that's weird right?"
Livnelly M.,"Miami, FL",141,13,26,3.0,4/9/2017,"Hurts to write this review because my waitress was incredibly sweet and attentive, plus the restaurant looks like you're in a unique version of Alice in wonderland........BUT the food is just o.k. I ordered the same dishes from other locations, and they have tasted like heaven, but again, the food here is just o.k. The same taste wasn't there. Some foods were over cooked, burned, or just tasteless."
Kathy Z.,"River West, Chicago, IL",1,19,,1.0,9/29/2017,Had one of the worst service ever at this location . We live in neighborhood and this is the 2nd time we have had terrible service in the bar area . Our waiter was absolutely horrible. It wasn't even packed in the bar area and he didnt come by to check in us once then all of a sudden went in break . Didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or anything else. Absolutely awful!!!!!
Frank Z.,"San Diego, CA",71,25,4,2.0,9/12/2017,"Traveling thru again and had to try this place....sad. Usually CCF is pretty good in San Diego, but this place...nope. Food is just not up to par and service was pretty damn slow. Never coming here again as I regularly visit Chicago. Well now I know!"
Demetrius G.,"Chicago, IL",6,12,5,4.0,8/16/2017,"Best cheesecake I ever had the servers are friendly and polite, the only thing I hate is this place is super crowed with tourist."
Jeffrey V.,"Chicago, IL",34,5,,5.0,9/27/2017,"As a teen, you go to your local Barnes and Noble to enjoy your slice of Cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory, it wasn't until I moved to Chicago that I decided to come here with a couple of my friends for a couple of cocktails! Besides their many varieties of Cheesecake you will find a vast amount of fantastic things to eat! My friends and I had a cheese flatbread that was like a grilled cheese sandwich that came with a sweet marinara! It was phenomenal, and midway through-- my friend suggested another sauce that she had tried last time! They were both fantastic, our lovely handsome British bartender who assisted us until close last night was  attentive and too kind! Thank you for help making our night!"
Mark G.,"Montreal, Canada",52,638,23,3.0,8/3/2016,"My 3-star review is an average of the best and worst in one sitting.  Our server, Andrea, was new and very bubbly (in a good way). She was attentive to my daughter and to me and did her best to provide excellent service.  We were seated outside, and were served within a reasonable amount of time. The food was alright. My daughter's kid's meal salmon looked excellent and cooked perfectly. My pork chop took a bit longer and was tough.  Mid-meal, with a young child, it is only normal to go to the bathroom. As we were seated so close to a public area, I took my kid and my bag and we went inside the restaurant. We were gone for 4-6 minutes, and returned to see our table had been cleared and set for the next guests. The restaurant was no longer full though!  I went inside to share this news with the hostess whose first comment was ""it's because you didn't leave any personal belongings"". Ummm.. of course I didn't. It's a big city.  Manager was called over by our server and he was nothing but polite and apologetic. Pure class and professionalism. Not only did they comp the meal (naturally.. who would pay for something they didn't get to finish) but also re-fired a new chop for me and threw in 2 pieces of cheesecake for the road.  Moral of the story: sometimes, mistakes are made, but what's important is how you recover from them. This manager won me over despite an unfortunate situation, and it is to his (and the restaurant's) credit.  Oh, and the cheesecake was delicious."
Isabel V.,"Orlando, FL",84,18,,2.0,7/7/2017,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory! They usually have excellent food and excellent service. However, I will never go to this one again.  I thought it was going to be a positive experience since we got seated right away and the hostess was friendly; however, everything went downhill after that. We waited over an hour for our food to come out. We didn't get our appetizer we had ordered. Then they didn't even bring out the fries with my boyfriend's burger. We brought these issues to their attention and they said they would bring the fries right away and make sure we weren't charged for the appetizer. Ended up having to wait another 30 minutes for some fries. They offered us cheesecake on the house and ended up charging us for it. I was done complaining to them. I literally spent over 2 hours in this restaurant with negative impression. I will never be back to this location."
The D.,"Burbank, IL",1,14,9,5.0,7/6/2017,I've been coming forever and It's amazing If you haven't been do yourself a favor and come here
Corie J.,"Rochester Hills, MI",122,16,5,4.0,9/23/2017,"I have heard of this restaurant and never been before tonight, I was very impressed with the quality of the food and drinks. First we ordered tuna tartare which one had before at two other restaurants and have to say cheesecake factory's blew them out of the water!! My lemon drop martini was exceptional and while my filet mignon did come out overcooked, they compensated with a brand new steak and a slice of cheese cake for free :)"
Jack R.,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,1.0,12/26/2016,"Absolutely worst experience I have had in years.  To start, we were told that we would only have an hour wait for a party of seven.  They called us 20 minutes later to say our table was ready, only to tell us that they misheard us and thought we had a party of two.  They then said they would handle us as soon as possible.  Forty-six minutes later, we asked when our table would be ready and were told we were the next large part to be seated.  They called us about 10 minutes later and we stood up front waiting for another 11 minutes while they were ""cleaning"" our table which was not true as we were staring at the table we were going to be seated at in the bar area since they first paged us.   It felt as though they were punishing us for telling them they put down the wrong number in our party.  The food was just OK.  The kitchen was extremely slow.  The hosts up front were very curt practically to the point of insulting.  The only saving grace was our server Sharon, who was very attentive and and polite. I won't be going back any time soon and and would recommend that everyone stay away."
Emily F.,"Kearney, NE",36,3,,1.0,12/4/2017,"Dinner started out fine. The the crab artichoke appetizer was delicious. However, after a 35 minute wait for your entree and then finding a grill pick mixed in your pasta was not very appetizing. The server never apologized, just got a manger who did not do much. Decided to order dessert, which took another 25 minutes to get. A waste of 2.5 hours and my money."
Ronna B.,"Rock Island, IL",8,10,5,4.0,3/16/2017,"The food was really good. For all my gluten-free people, the gluten-free menu was really good, it had a wide variety and you get a lot of food. The service was okay our waitress couldve been friendlier but was efficient.   definitely worth it!"
Ivonne R.,"Chicago, IL",77,83,345,5.0,2/11/2016,"I love most cheesecakes and desserts at the Cheesecake Factories, but I must say that not everything else on their menu is as good. (There are, of course, a number of bakeries who make better items, but many are harder to find than this chain.) A great food item to get for lunch or dinner is the Herb-Crusted Salmon in lemon sauce with delicious mashed potatoes and asparagus! My mom and I really enjoy this item, and I was surprised to taste something this good here in comparison to other average dishes served here. Most dishes are huge there, but ask your waiter about the sizes and the smaller lunch portions. I've shared a delicious special 30th Anniversary cheesecake/cake and other desserts with 1 or 2 other people after a big meal. I must say that the Chicagoland and Indianapolis locations have pretty much the same quality. Yum, now, excuse me while I go Google chees"
