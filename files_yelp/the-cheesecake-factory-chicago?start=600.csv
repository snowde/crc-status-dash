Arlene G.,"Oak Park, IL",93,905,,4.0,10/6/2009,"If you haven't tried the lettuce wraps yet, it's a must for next time! I love those things! I have tried various entrees and I have liked them all. This is one of those restaurants you go to when you're hungry and you know no matter what you pick from the menu, it's gonna be good. They serve all types if ethnic foods so there's a great selection. It seems as if there's as many desserts as there are entrees! No matter what kind of food or dessert you're craving, this place will most likely have it!"
Joanna L.,"New York, NY",197,359,233,4.0,7/28/2007,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but I've only eaten there twice (although I've had their cheesecake tons of times). As for this Chicago location, it has relatively good service, very good food, good location and ambiance.  If you're not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, expect to spend over $10 for your meal (more if you're there for dinner and even more if you want dessert). Dessert runs around $6-8 for a slice of cheesecake (but if you like heavy cheesecake, it's well worth it!). If you go on a weekend or during peak meal hours, you're going to have to wait to eat. If you're not really that hungry and are willing to eat around mid-afternoon, then  I suggest that as the prime time that you can just walk in and eat. If you just want cheesecake, you can just order it from their front counter. Tell them what you want and wait for them to call for you to pick it up. :) If you're sharing, make sure to ask for extra forks and napkins! Oh and their bathrooms are amazing. I just love going in there!!!"
Blair M.,"Chicago, IL",174,20,1,5.0,3/2/2010,"Few restaurants are as distinctive and memorable as the Cheesecake Factory. While they are a restaurant chain, Chicago has one unique from all others. It's #12 in the chain, making it one of the older, more original designs, according to a Cheesecake employee Chicago's Cheesecake Factory brings about thoughts of a whimsical fairy tale. Low lighting brings about ambience, and a generally warm environment is extremely welcoming. People have described it to me as ""A real-life Fern Gully,"" ""The underground level of Mario Bros,"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""  Mushroom-shaped lights sit on the tables, and they alone cost a couple thousand dollars, according to an employee. The rest of the restaurant is made of flowing, non-linear shapes. A 21-page menu (with its own advertising) furthers this feeling of coziness. Offerings vary from appetizers, and light meals to hefty full-course offerings. They boast over 200 menu items. My buddy and I sampled the Calamari, which was served with a creamy garlic sauce and a marinara sauce. The Calamari was perfectly crisp, although the serving size was a bit small. Service at the Cheesecake Factory is notoriously amazing, and for good reason. Employees go through a 400-question test, and they have to get a 90% of better to pass, according to Jennifer Sotelo, a waitress and trainer at the Factory. ""What I tell all my trainees- 'you may be part-time, but during training you must be full-time,'"" Sotelo said. Our waiter, a young man by the name of Tom Schabow, has been with the Factory for a month. He described his experience as ""scary,"" though he has grown more comfortable in his position. He took excellent care of us, and was extremely gracious as we took a ridiculous amount of time to select our food. There is, of course, the cheesecake. They have over 30 varieties. Every offering is excellent, although our waiter recommended the Adams Peanut Butter Ripple. So. Good. We split the cake, and still found it to be a lot to eat. The total came to $27.71, which included Calamari, a soft drink, a beer, and a large piece of cheesecake. Price rating: The Advertising Major- Kids who know they'll get filthy rich soon enough- is the moderate category. Picture a kid with a briefcase and a blazer jacket."
Rick T.,"Pearl City, HI",21,19,,3.0,3/20/2011,"Typical Cheesecake Factory.  The food portions are large and the food is pretty good.  It's not great but not bad either, kind of guarenteed ok meal.  The price is ok but the wait is quite long.  We waited around an hour and waited 15 minutes longer after being called.  The waiter was nice and friendly.  The presentation was nice and especially appealing from the outside."
Sarah M.,"Chicago, IL",8,202,,3.0,12/23/2009,"Touristy location and therefore packed out.  However, all for good reasons. (Except for the slightly elevated prices). About 40 varieties of cheesecake are available and a varied mass of other savoury snacks and entrées.  The beetroot and goats cheese salad with pecans and apple was very light and flavourful. I also enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates and the key lime cheesecake. Interesting and quirky decor- an abstract representation of what it might feel like to be sat inside of a cheesecake perhaps? Not sure, but I sort of liked it. Luckily, you can avoid the crush and just order cheesecake to go in the foyer of the restaurant if you have a sugar craving while in the area."
Xavier R.,"Chicago, IL",3,3,1,1.0,1/2/2011,"Wow, what to say... Let me first say that this place isn't even deserving of a single star.  I recently came here for my friends birthday. Out of the three of us who went, neither of us had tried the cheesecake factory, so we thought we should see what the big deal is. The wait was 40 minutes, but I expected that, especially from a chain restaurant. I had a gut feeling this would be a bad experience from how noisy it was, not to mention we were seated right by the kitchen where they drop dishes every minute. We waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to come by and take our orders for drinks. He takes another 10 minutes bringing our drinks.  This is where it all falls apart. I ordered the meatloaf (don't ask), the birthday girl orders shrimp pasta, and my friend orders a grilled cheese. So after he takes our orders he tells us he would bring us bread, about 10 minutes go by and no bread. We had to pull him out of his way to ask him for the bread and refills, then he says ""Oh, You wanted bread?!"". We just sat there looking at each other like ""REALLY?!"".. So eventually brings us some damn bread, but no refills. Then my friend's pasta finally comes, while me and my other friend are still waiting for our food. They told us our food would be ready in just a couple of minutes about 3 times, like I really believed that bullshit. They FINALLY bring out my friend's grilled cheese (We were waiting for about an hour and a half since we ordered) how long does it even take to make a GRILLED CHEESE? Seriously??!!! So they have their food and I still don't have mine, and neither of us have our refills!!  As I was waiting for my food (still), my friend is dissatisfied with her pasta, so she, in all honesty, puts a hair in her pasta and tells the manager. Yes, we cheated them, but we waited two hours and got the shittiest service you can imagine. So she asks for soup instead of another entree. She gets her soup, but with NO SPOON. She was left eating the bacon bits with her knife, because they also didn't bring her another fork. Meanwhile I still don't have my fucking meatloaf. About 15 minutes passes by and the bring me a sub-par meatloaf. I only took two bites of my meatloaf when, upon further inspection, I find a ACUTUAL hair. It wasn't mine, because I have long hair; this was about half the size of mine. I was disgusted. Karma is a bitch. My friend complains to the manager about the crap service and the shitty food, to which he tells us that it's no excuse and offers us a free cheesecake slice and a happy birthday song. Honestly we felt so offended by that, it was basically a slap to the face. We did not want to spend another minute there, we had half the mind to leave. Just as we put on our coats, our waiter (who we only saw 3 times) comes by and tells us its on them. DAMN STRAIGHT IT'S ON THEM, I wasn't going to pay for any of that! We storm out of there, and as we are leaving, the manager tells us how this isn't their standards and blah, blah, blah, bullshit. But we just blew him off and ignored him.  It was seriously THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. I was honestly waiting for someone to give me $100 for being on MTV's boiling points, it was THAT BAD. Not even kidding, I was looking for hidden cameras. It was surreal; how could a restaurant give service like THAT?! Especially for a restaurant downtown?! Especially for someone's birthday?! And the excuses they gave us? HA! Like I really believed them, they were so ridiculous. But for some reason, when we past the revolving doors to leave, we busted out laughing. It was just one big joke, and has since then become the butt of all our jokes.  And if we learned anything, it's that;  1. bring a spoon 2. never order the meatloaf 3. only go for the cheese cake, I guess.. 4. chain restaurants really are the devil (and are made for tourists) But hey, at least the food was free....."
Michael G.,"Newington, CT",88,29,1,5.0,2/9/2010,"All you haters giving this bad reviews are obviously those people that find something terrible in everything that is good. This place is top of the line and hopefully these five stars will boost it up. The food is absolutely delectable and ambiance is comforting. The free bread is very good and for an American cuisine place, I have absolutely no complaints.  Next up was the boneless buffalo tenders and let me tell you, I consider myself something of a wing connoisseur and these were some of the best I've ever had. A huge portion of chicken with a tangy sauce and blue cheese. Fantastic.  For dinner it was the shrimp scampi and it wasn't your typical dish, as the shrimp were on the side but the shrimp alone were awesome! The sauce that the angel hair pasta and shrimp lay in was a buttery-garlicy goodness that even being an Italian, really blew me away. But what we all came for was the cheesecake, which, quoting Ron Burgundy, ""is simply the best there is."" Millions of flavors for every kind of person and occasion. If you've never had it, you're not living. It's one of the seven wonders of the worlds - the pyramids and cheesecake. If you go just for cheesecake, you're getting your money's worth. I've eaten cheesecake there, never dinner until this time and I now qualify the cheesecake factory as one of my top dining areas. Little pricey, but if you're efficient with what you order and don't stuff yourself like I chose to, you'll be alright. Well done indeed."
Ariane M.,"Chicago, IL",41,15,,5.0,5/11/2012,"Me and my friend went a couple a weeks back and the experience was amazing like seriously. There was no wait time, our waiter was amazeballs and even the manager on duty checked to make sure our service and meal was good. no complaints here, going back ASAP."
Barb S.,"Fremont, CA",23,19,1,4.0,10/4/2012,"the Cheescake Factory near the Hancock building is pretty cool, its a real experience! the whole interior design is a total Gaudi art nouveau experience. staff is friendly and prompt and the menu is gigantic. good place for lunch. you can sit out door in a lower court yard in front of Hancock tower."
Marjorie F.,"Chicago, IL",240,280,6,2.0,1/25/2009,"Living in Chicago aka ""land of many options"", I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants.  The few times I've been here have been 1) for work (I used to work in the Hancock), 2) because an out-of-town visitor insisted on coming here, and 3) when a friend has a craving for their cheesecake. Last night a friend had a craving for their food.  This is something I just don't understand because of all the wonderful restaurants we have in this great city!  But anyway... We started out with the avocado eggrolls.  Strange, but tasty.  I ordered the meatloaf while my friend ordered a salad.  The portions are GI-NORMOUS!!!  Good grief...  I forgot about that!  No wonder we have an obesity epidemic in this country. The meatloaf was OK...  Not the best I've ever had.  When I saw the plate, I knew it was too much.  The portion was too big, sauce was overflowing on everything, and once I tasted it, there was too much salt.  We also ordered dessert - the tiramisu.  Holy whipped cream!  There was a small slice of tiramisu with FIVE huge dollops of whipped cream on top and on the sides.  Yuck...  Too much whipped cream.    Ummm...  Are you noticing a theme here? Yes, TOO MUCH. The service was friendly and fast, which was nice.  I'll give them that.  Our server even went the extra mile to get the tirimisu from the main kitchen since they didn't serve it in the cafe section (on the 1st floor) where we were sitting.  Bonus points to him! The decor is very much like Alice in Wonderland.  I recommend laying off the hallucinogenics before coming here. Parking in the area is terrible, so you have to pay a high fee to park in their garage.  It's something you can't avoid unless you have access to public transportation ( ). Overall, my experience here was OK.  Will go back?  Only if you make me.  In the meantime, I will continue my practice of avoiding chain restaurants as long as I live in this town!"
Deana L.,"Chicago, IL",73,80,7,3.0,1/1/2009,"I usually dislike chain restaurants, for high prices on packaged/canned food, however CF is a slight exception.  I didn't want to like it, at first but it has grown on me for its food choices and bread and butter refills.  And it's not that I have been to many Cheesecake Factory Restaurants; it's that I have eaten at 1 or 2 of the stores many, many times.  Tonight, I expanded my repertoire. The Chicago CF is on the bottom floor of the John Hancock building.  The color palette is the same as every other CF, but the décor is different.  There is a sexual vibe to it as my CF partner-in-crime/good friend said.  The women's bathroom is especially interesting with ornate door handles and beautiful doors.  Check out the ceiling too.  It looks like rows of dough rising.   The food is typical CF-fare with good-sized portions.  I had what seems to be a new addition to the menu: the vegetable chop salad.  I asked for the pomegranate vinaigrette dressing on the side so the salad was fresh and crisp with a lot of 'stuff': beets, tomatoes, cucumbers, edamame, apples, white cheddar.  I added the grilled chicken too.  The salad dressing on the side was a little strange; the salad is mixed with a pom glaze and then a honey-ish, sesame-ish dressing is added.  Since it's fairly involved, ordering it on the side was weird. Overall, the salad was yummy!  Sidenote: The wait for a table was long, but that is the same at any CF."
Aaron S.,"Chicago, IL",251,254,69,4.0,10/19/2008,"Despite the waits and the occasional slow service, I can't bring myself to give this place anything less than 4 stars.  This is probably because I'm not a gourmet - I'm a gourmand.  We prefer our food to be served ""en masse"" and never walk away from a table feeling anything but stuffed and satisfied.  Quality is something we can accept to let slide in exchange for guaranteed quantity, and luckily Cheesecake Factory serves up enough of both to make it worthwhile. I've only been there twice this year - mostly because when you get the benefit of decent quality with a good amount of quantity, it comes with the challenge of being annoyingly expensive. I don't think I've ever been to this place and had a bill less than $50 for two people dining. Once you've made it past the inane waiting process with a vibrating light-up coaster that will sit blankly in your lap for at least 30-40 minutes if you've come between the hours of 4pm and 9pm, you'll possibly make it to a table.  Of course, you could just end up at one of the annoying too-high-up tables at the bar because they're out of REAL tables and it'll pressure you into getting a drink while you wait an insane length of time for your waiter and/or food.  Don't fall for it - you can get a 750ml bottle of liquor for the price of one bar drink that contains maybe a shot or two of actual liquor in it.  And yes, some reviewers have it right that the bathrooms can get downright atrocious - though I must have visited once when it was freshly cleaned and once when it hadn't been cleaned in a while, because it runs the gamut between funky and fine. The bread is excellent.  Makes the wait for service and ordered food not that bad.  I admit that almost every time I'm here, I get the same thing.  The steak.  It's pricey, but it's one of the few things on the menu I'd never be able to find in a store and cook to the level of deliciousness that they manage to do.  The fries are okay, but the fried onions are delectable and pair so nicely with a good steak. And the cheesecake!  The Oreo is one of the ones I've had the pleasure of trying, but I have to personally give a shout-out to their 6-carb cheesecake, which was the perfect gift for my Atkins-dieting girlfriend's birthday surprise.  They even spelled Happy Birthday and her name in sugar-free chocolate. My girl returned the favor for the waitress's bonus decorations by letting her know that she felt sorry for the Cheesecake Factory's coffee machine, and that it sounded like they had a clog in the milk steamer or something, causing it to squeal annoyingly.  She thanked us for the tip and made sure to tell the staffer at the coffee machine. This place could make it to five stars if they lowered some of the prices, or reduced the menu enough so they could begin to truly excel at cooking a smaller array of dishes rather than churn out less-quality results from the nightmarishly-long menu.  I can't fault them for the long waits or the stressed-out servers, though.  If you go, and you're not a tourist, just punch any tourists you see in the stomach until word spreads that they're not tourist-friendly and then we Chicagoans can take back this awesome restaurant and get to enjoy the food without a 40-minute wait."
Chrissy N.,"Chicago, IL",59,251,89,4.0,1/26/2009,"Eye candy AND good eats!  This place has anything you could dream up on the menu for lunch or dinner or brunch. The drinks are crazy exciting. The portions are huge. Unless you're having steak or lobster, everything is $10-$15. AND THEN there is the cheesecake!! Like 30 different flavors.  Indoor seating outdoor seating. Our waiter was four star in his manners, ease, friendliness, and attentiveness. Even tough it's very busy (you will wait 15-10 minutes), they encourage you to take your time, enjoy yourself, and stay as long as you like."
Amy S.,"Orland Park, IL",0,11,1,2.0,7/10/2012,The food was very mediocre and we sat near one of the stations where the staff put in their orders and very loudly heard them talk about the people they were waiting on( all of it derogatory) but it seemed that they were all in pretty much a bad mood in our area. The prices were average.
Laure N.,"Chicago, IL",5,32,,4.0,4/13/2010,"Great place to bring out of towners for Service,Food,Decor . The main course is good but the cheesecake is what you should be showing up for. Service is A+ I keep getting the same server Dave A and he is very  friendly and loves to serve food. If you have questions about the menu he is always there to help and doesn't say everything is good. Food B The cheesecake is not the best but it's good enough. For you chocolate lovers out there get the Godiva cheesecake it's great! . .  For a dollar more they add more booz to your drink I wouldn't suggest it at Cheesecake factory.  Also,for your Birthday you do get a free ice cream (very small).  Do bring someone here before you bring them to Signature Lounge it's worth it."
Justin H.,"Chicago, IL",259,369,52,4.0,5/2/2009,"Customer service was spot on. Seated right away. Drink orders were taken almost immediately, food was served in a quick fashion.  As for the food a freind insisted I get the Chicken Madiera. Wow, it was so good i could of had another plate! My other friend ordered it with extra extra sauce which i found to be unnecessary!  If you hit on the waiters do not be suprised if they take you up on the offer only to end up at their house learning they are Impotent.  Learned a few things here, Love their Chicken, Service is great  and don't hit on the servers, they might just be impotent!"
Lou A.,"Chicago, IL",2,24,,3.0,6/19/2012,"Service is meh, food is meh, but the cheesecake is fabulous!"
TOMMY o.,"Indianapolis, IN",111,540,1320,5.0,11/22/2008,"Daniel our Lunchtime waiter was Awesome!! our lunch was Great, this restr is in the basement of the John Hancock Building, we literally went from top to bottom, the food is Always Excellent, the wait from frantic guests wasn't too bad, ~30 minutes downtown Chicago during lunch rush hour & holiday shoppers"
Stacey W.,"Carol Stream, IL",77,160,10,2.0,5/2/2011,"I'd give it more stars, but the price and service were ridiculous. I got the chicken and biscuits and it was absolutely amazing. The biscuits were flaky and buttery and the mashed potatoes that came with it were phenomenal! The gravy was delicious as well. Of course we ordered cheesecake. I got the vanilla bean which was decadent. Our service went from good to decent to horrible. It took forever to get our drinks. The food came out in a normal time period. We had to wait a good 20-25 minutes just to get our cheesecake after we were done with dinner, and coincidentally our waiter was nowhere to be found during that time period. Needless to say he got the tip he deserved and we got out of there as quick as possible."
Laura P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,5.0,3/20/2014,"My boyfriend and I moved to Chicago on Saturday morning and dined at The Cheesecake Factory on Saturday night. We were undoubtedly stressed beyond belief and in need of a nice night out. Our wait to be seated was estimated at 45 minutes but we were able to sit in the bar area after waiting only 15. This was due to our phenomenal server Cody who grabbed our attention and let us know the table was up for grabs. I'm not exaggerating when I say Cody was phenomenal. Oddly enough, he wasn't even our main server! He was relieved by equally wonderful server Phillip who had just returned from his dinner break. Both guys were able to supply great recommendations and answer our annoying questions, all while smiling, joking, and giving us an all-around amazing night at The Cheesecake Factory!"
