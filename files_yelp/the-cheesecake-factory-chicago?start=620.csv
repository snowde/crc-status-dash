Lucian I.,"Dearborn, MI",0,4,,2.0,5/28/2012,"Don't believe the hype. We went there on a visit to Chicago, because everybody told us we had to go there. The restaurant is a tourist spot, crowded, but we didn't have to wait long, about 10 mins. I hated the decor, they go for whimsy, it comes out tacky. The waiters are dressed in all white, and it makes them look like orderlies from a mental institution. The food was very unimpressive. The menu is huge, and you need a few minutes to get through it, especially if it's your first time there like it was for us. We had a BLT salad as an appetizer, which was good, and ordered 2 entrees from the seafood menu. The portions are huge (even the soft drinks came in a huge glass, probably somewhere around 30oz), and the food was ok, but nothing to make me go back there. I doubt that I will ever eat again in a Cheesecake Factory. It is overhyped and overpriced, especially since what they serve seems to be just glorified fast food. The cheesecake was good, but very, very expensive, at about $7-9 a slice. It didn't blow me away like I would expect for that price. You can find better, cheaper desserts at local Chicago restaurants. We ended up spending about $80 including tip and dessert, for something that was probably worth about half of that amount. In my opinion, you'd be better spending your money in a local restaurant, trying some of the local fare: there are lots of gems spread all around the city, where you can have a more pleasurable and satisfying experience."
Amber S.,"St Michaels, AZ",1,11,3,1.0,2/19/2012,I started with the fry bread. What an insult on NAVAJO FRY BREAD. I believe it could be the none Bluebird flour. But omelet was different. First time in Chicago I'll try something else besides a chain restaurant . Thanks but no cigar on the fry bread.
Iman W.,"Chicago, IL",85,348,,3.0,4/1/2009,"First things first, if you're going to come here on a Friday, have on comfy shoes, for you will be standing for quite some time. I had a pasta dish, my friend had some sort of burger, and we agreed that the food was pretty..umm...well...it was bland. My drinks were fabulous, however. And the Godiva cheesecake made me want to curl up in a corner and whimper for mercy, it was THAT good. For the cheesecake and drinks alone I'd come back."
Jason S.,"Muscatine, IA",53,35,,3.0,1/18/2009,"When I lived in Chicago, I was so entranced by the thousands of choices available to me, I looked down my nose at any chain restaurant and seldom ate here.  However, now that I've spent the past eight years in culinary isolation in a smaller community, I don't mind this as much. So, while I enjoyed visiting some old favorites when back in town--I did enjoy making a trek here for what I knew would be some reliable tasty food and a good dessert. As all of the other reviews mention--portions here are gigantic. Unless you are absolutely starving, I'd skip appetizers and go for the main course and cheesecake--or go for apps and main dish, but no dessert. Or, you could do what I did, ordering apps and a main dish and getting my cheesecake to go (a decadent breakfast!) The decor is odd at this one, as well as other CF's that I've been in. I describe it as ""Help, I'm trapped in a cheesecake"" decor. Our server, when asked, described it as a dessert fantasy. I'd call it cheesey, but the pun is too obvious. The fried Macaroni and Cheese balls sound disgusting, but are actually very good. The Thai Lettuce rolls are also a good choice. I was with a group of eight, and we ordered two of the ""factory appetizer favorites"" for the table--a good way to sample the wares. For dinner, I've had great luck with the pasta dishes, meats, and specifically the meatloaf. I'm not sure why someone would come here and not order the cheesecake! My favorites are the dulce de leche, white chocolate raspberry truffle, Key Lime, and Dutch Apple Caramel. We were here on the night of a blizzard warning which appeared to thin down the crowds considerably. In fact, it might be my only visit here that didn't come with at least a 45 minute wait. There are a ton of better options in Chicago. But, if you are here for a few days, and want one-night to be a no pressure day that will please everyone in your party with its diverse menu, the Cheesecake Factory will be a good choice."
Jack C.,"San Francisco, CA",195,64,,3.0,10/1/2008,Now generally i am apposed to places like cheesecake and CPK and such.  However... Going to the original cheesecake in Chicago was an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend it for an out-of-towner or a hungry NorthWestern student needing a large/tasty meal for incredibly reasonable prices.
Rebecca H.,"Chicago, IL",25,234,6,2.0,8/3/2009,"This place is in the basement, and they don't try to cover up that fact. If you absolutely must, come here for desert and a drink only.  But, if you're going to be all touristy, it seems stupid to eat here with the Signature Room/Lounge just above."
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,12/28/2008,"This cheesecake factory is not unlike any of the others. The portions are big, the food is fattie, and the prices are out of control.  But they have the best shrimp pasta dish that I order ALL the time. Its so good I cant even remember the name!!! The cheesecake is delicious and I usually leave bloated, unable to walk, with a doggie bag in hand."
Jay K.,"Chicago, IL",6,5,,4.0,4/21/2012,Yeah I am fan of Cheese Cake Factory. The food is awesome there .  & the Best best best part is their Red Valvet Cheese Cake for Dessert .  Its so so so yummy & v stomach filling .  Loved this place .
Tam T.,"Louisville, KY",29,19,,1.0,8/1/2012,"So the update to the less than expected service. After writing the review and sending it to Cheesecake, I received a phone call from Nick (their manager apparently who doesn't seem to be in office that often), who informed me of his sadness to hear my bad experience. He gave me his number and told me to call back to discuss the matter. Upon receiving the message, I proceeded to call Nick back to be greeted by one of the staff, who told me that she does not know of anyone by that name that works at the Cheesecake. I listened to the message again and tried the other number instead of the caller ID number, which went to Bryan (a staff member). This time Bryan placed me on hold for 10 minutes after he said he will try to find Nick for me. I was then disconnected. I gave them a benefit of a doubt and called back. Bryan responded by saying Nick was not there.... The PLOT THICKENS! I called back next day and got a girl (Jessica), who said that Nick was not in again. Surprisingly, a manager seems to not do much at the factory. As I type this update, I am on hold for 20 minutes already on the following day after Bryan answered and told me to wait while he tries to see if Nick is in. Now this is just purely amusement on my part at this point. Let's see what corporate will do when this is sent to them. I suspect not much since they will override it and keep on trucking since I won't make such an impact, but still amusing to me.  If negative stars, I would..."
Jeff A.,"Chicago, IL",1164,309,7,4.0,5/14/2009,"Tourist Trap (maybe) (ok yes it is) but seriously!  The cheesecake is amazing! kick off your meal with a piece of the cheesecake because by the time you eat you will have no room left for one of these delicious creations... I eat at Cheese cake factories all over the country but my favorite one is right here in Chicago!  I just love it!  the service is always lightening quick regardless of how crowded they are!      My new favorite dish is the crusted ahi tuna I get it almost every time I go, it is probably not all that healthy, I tell my self it is!  and it is so darn good!  before this I was always getting the thai lettuce wraps, I am sure they are still great just have not hitched my wagon to that post in quite some time... My two favorite Cheese cakes are the lemon raspberry and the Godiva Chocolate...but I must say I just tried the Original for the first time on tuesday, wow it was amazing! velvety, creamy, rich and not too sweet... something tells me I will be back to that original cheesecake again many times over!"
Micah L.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",0,5,,5.0,4/4/2012,"Great food. Nice decor. Excellent prices.  I accidentally left something valuable at their restaurant, and the staff went above and beyond in making sure it was returned to me. They were extremely professional and courteous."
Kara M.,"Columbus, OH",155,525,22,4.0,2/20/2009,"Def do not go here if you're starving like a hostage because the wait can be terribly long. we had to wait like 1.5 hours for a table, and my friend really really wanted to go because she hadn't been to CF before. we got a table before i chewed off my own hand and our waiter was really nice. the appetizers came quick and our entrees followed shortly after. the food is nothing spectacular except for the chicken sandwich with avocado, but overall it's your typical american food. the Kahlua cheesecake is my fav and there are many to choose from. besides the wait everything was great!"
Annie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,245,7,3.0,10/6/2008,"If this place wasn't a chain, I'd probably give it more stars. I'm so unfair, I know.  My cuz and I stopped in for cheesecake and coffee while shoppin on Michigan Ave yesterday. We were seated immediately, received great service while sharing a slice of the always dependable Banana Cream Cheesecake. YUUUUUMUMS. I've been to Cheesecakes all over the country-- the waits are always long on the weekends but it's a nice, dependable restaurant. The menu is so extensive that everyone at your table will find what they're craving.  I know this Cheesecake Factory was built for tourists but I couldn't help but stop in to give my sweet tooth a tasty fix! :)"
Daniel S.,"Savannah, GA",1,67,40,4.0,5/7/2009,"The food here is descent, and the service was good the night I was there.  After ordering I had my meal within 10 minutes. The main reason I go to the cheesecake factory is for the desert, which is better than the main course. Overall, it rates well as a chain restaurant.  Good service and good food."
Eddie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,63,3,4.0,1/22/2009,"My family and I have been going to Cheesecake Factory for a long time back home in DC. It's just convenient, comfortable, and it opens late. Food is tasty, there are many options that cover a wide price range (from sandwiches under $10 to steaks over $20), and they give you MONSTER portions.  This particular Cheesecake Factory is in a pretty cool location, under the John Hancock building. If you can score outdoor seats in the summer, even better! There is actually a pretty hilarious and insightful article about how NBA players seem to frequent Cheesecake Factories across the country a lot, check it out: "
John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5,4.0,1/7/2011,"This resturant has just been renamed to the beefcake factory, or maybe Hostess just got into the resturant business because this place is loaded with twinkies. More about that to come... So my friend and I decided to hit up this location for A little New years eve base buildup. having gone to the other location in Oakbrook many times becfore we knew this was a good start to our night on the town. Unlike the Oakbrook location however this location is a bit on the tight side. tables are very close togather and it almost feels more like a mess hall than a resturant. That aside the locations are fairly similuar in decor. Our waitress although friendly seemed to be a few eggs short of a dozen. many times we were told we would be getting bread and it never came. My friend joked that we would get it after our auntrees and that is exactly what happened. The best part was she claimed it was in the oven but when it came it was cold... That must be the fastest cooling bread ever. I honestly think she kept forgetting to bring it and it was New years eve so I can totally let this one slide by. I ordered the Cheeseburger. Little did I know what kind of Beefcake I really ordered as my meal was delivered by a super hot blond food runner. Honestly this location gets points just for that :) My food came fresh and hot. Honestly this was one of the best burgers I have had at a cheesecake factory. Maybe I was just starved but it was amazing (the burger that is... ok the food runner too :)). All in all a great dinning experiance."
Darl B.,"Hinsdale, IL",48,202,,1.0,2/28/2012,They have like a zillion lunch items... I can honestly say I have never actually liked any of them I got! Cheesecake for dessert is good though. but food is like way way bad. why would anyone gives this place a good rating is beyond me. anyway last time I as there (other people pick it beforehand and I just kind of groan and bear it for the good of the party) there was a 'special' the Cuban sandwich. Oh it was special all-right!lol basically a French bun with yellow mustard and super pre-processed ham. omg so bad I wanted to cry lol! gawd it is all so bland and mediocre or worse. I just can't get over why anyone would pick this place to go to more than first time getting burned.
Kate N.,"Chicago, IL",85,47,,1.0,6/19/2008,"Caveat: This review goes for all Cheesecake locations, and I'm writing it because my friends and family are done listening to my rants on the subject. If you have a strong loyalty to the Cheesecake Factory, perhaps you should go read something else. Just a thought.  I remember the first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory -- it was in Jersey, in a mall. Even as a surly 13 year old with the palate sophistication of an alley cat, I was entirely underwhelmed. There was no sense of being momentarily welcomed into a respite from the world, like you experience at truly good restaurants at any price range. There was a weird taste coating my mouth when we finished.  This uneasy feeling -- as if I'm dining on a movie set and everything looks real, but isn't -- has only grown with the numerous work-sponsored ""team bonding"" lunches at CF's I've had to endure over the years. The conclusion I've come to is that, like so many other restaurants, CF is pure mediocrity and it simply exhausts me.  CF should accept the fact that it is on par with an Applebee's or Friendly's. At least those places don't attempt to be anything they're not! The food is no better and neither is the service. And at CF, you have to try to stomach that Wal-Martized version of fine dining decor.  Larger portions do not = better quality. Really. The price might be right, but those massive piles of cardboard doused in fat and sugar are all that is wrong with America.  Why on EARTH would you want to eat somewhere called a ""factory""? Go out and pick up Pollan's ""Omnivore's Dilemma."" Try and tell me, after reading it, that you want to put something that ADMITS to being straight from a factory in your mouth! (Even if you're not going to tell me anything of the sort, read the book anyway.) As I write this, I realize that many will wonder why I care. ""If you don't like it, don't go there!"" (You were thinking that. I know.) And you have a point. However, I think what I'm really railing against here is the sense that people don't demand better food, atmosphere, service. No one thinks twice about spending their money on something perhaps temporarily tasty but ultimately insubstantial, and that's why these places exist. These mediocre restaurants keep popping up like mushrooms, and eventually people start to think its the norm.  For the price of a CF meal, you can easily feast somewhere more genuine, if you're willing to look. So, no, I won't go to CF anymore. I'll skip the office birthday and ""so sorry you're leaving us"" celebrations. I'll just hope that people start putting their feet down before all the real places are stamped out by these alien, heartless, species. Trust me, if you stop to think about it, you can tell the difference. That is all."
Denise H.,"Chicago, IL",6,5,,1.0,12/11/2014,"Waitress was awesome! However, they have changed the way they fix artichokes, which is fine just not to my liking. I was given another appetizer the fried potato tarts, delicious! My guy ordered the Orange Chicken with rice, it was Bone Dry, I asked for Shrimp Scampi, I got Shrimp with Pasta and Tomato Sauce. I sent that back and was given the Shrimp Scampi, the pasta was pasty and the shrimp were cooked to long and enough basil to share with the entire restaurant. I asked for the manager, I showed him how hard my guy's rice was and that my scampi was unacceptable. He took both dishes and apologized. He did not come back the waitress came and brought our check, which still had the charges for the scampi. When he walked passed our table I asked him why was I charged for the scampi, he says because I ate two of the shrimp, I only ate one and had cut the other and mixed with the pasta. He then said, ""they (???) told him I had eaten the shrimp. I didn't mind paying for our drinks and appetizers but to pay and then have to go to dinner was to much! $17.95 + is what it cost them to loose a customer and my RECOMMENDATIONS!"
Amuse B.,"Northampton, MA",549,1981,2327,4.0,3/22/2009,"Food is the same as usual, so lets talk about the DECOR. This place is like walking into Alice in Wonderland, everything is poofy! I'd say to go in here just to check out the atmosphere, they really put a lot of effort into making this place interesting. I got the Pasta Davinci per usual and it was mahhhvelous. My waiter was also very nice."
