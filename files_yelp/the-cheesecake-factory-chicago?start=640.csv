Kim W.,"Portland, OR",19,172,1,3.0,9/13/2010,i may be unlike you because my damn-the-man and hate-on-corporations attitude shuts the hell up when i'm eating good food. the cheesecake? check. the shepard's pie? check.
Eric G.,"Sunrise, FL",3,23,2,4.0,7/19/2011,The wait here is not bad considering the location. Its the wait staff and food that make this place shine! The new Orleans shrimp and mushroom appetizers are amazing and the passion fruit mojito is absolutely tongue boggling! Ask for Larry if he's there; he was a super attentive and helpful waiter who took great care in making sure my experience was perfect.
Philly G.,"Chicago, IL",22,225,41,3.0,4/17/2011,"Don't sit at the bar if your going to try to eat a burger lol. Monterey burger was delicious as well as white macadamian nut cheesecake. However I asked for a well done burger and it was pretty pink inside, so much so that I took some of it out. Fresh lemonade was good too. not too pricey if you pay attention to what your ordering. Always a bit of a wait on the weekend."
Kim J.,"Chicago, IL",64,423,,1.0,7/17/2008,"Got stuck going here for a work lunch today.  To add to my list: 5.  The bathrooms were GROSS.  Like Chinatown gross.  It felt like they hadn't been cleaned since I was last there a year ago.   6.  You can't make a freaking reservation if you have a big group.  There were 16 of us from my office, and we got split up.  For a freaking celebratory luncheon.  After we were told we'd all be able to sit together on the phone.   7.  Did I mention that the food sucks?  Blech."
Candace M.,"Chicago, IL",96,150,1,3.0,4/12/2009,"When I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory it wasn't my first visit, I just haven't been for awhile, but I was given a gift card for CF and I wanted to use it.  I agree with the fact that the menu is overwhelming, I barely got passed the appetizers selection. My daughter and I had to wait only 20 minutes for seating.  At first, the lady tried to seat us at an end table where another guest had all their belongings in the seat.  That would have been entirely too crammed for me so I asked if we could sit in an available booth that I saw.  She without hesitation accommodated us.  That was a + in my book. I ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls (absolutely delicious), quesadillas and the fried mac & cheese (delicious) (like I said before I couldn't get passed the appetizers).  My daughter ordered the grilled cheese (huge) & fries (hey, she's four...what do you expect). My overall experience was ok.  This is not a regular place for me but hey since I had a gift card and I was having a mother/daughter day on the mag mile, why not.  I would definitely visit again."
Cathy H.,"New York, NY",24,177,1,3.0,3/16/2009,"I love some things about the cheesecake factory: huge menu (great for groups), fun decor, fun location (bottom floor, Hancock Tower), and generally decently tasty food.  And the wheat bread is to die for--sometimes I come here just for the wheat bread, I kid you not. Sadly, I don't think any of their food is super-great (like I said, I come here for the wheat bread--I don't think I've ever felt like I've wanted to come for anything else).  And the cheesecake is just so-so--it's tasty, but it's nothing to write home about (argh, dangling preposition!!)."
Drew K.,"Chicago, IL",14,30,,2.0,5/5/2008,"""Get it while you can""  I helped my friend move this weekend and to thank me he graciously gave me a $50 to this atrocity.  We drove down and parked at the Hancock Tower, big mistake. I could have gotten front row tickets to Wicked with the amount it costs to park here.  These acts keep reminding me why no big decisions are ever made by me.   This place,  I keep forgetting is always packed, and you usually have to wait for 30 minutes for a table or be prepared to fight off a throng of Asian tourists who are taking pictures in front of the giant mushroom.  Food is huge, not good, huge.  You will say to yourself ""Wow this taste um, this tastes, this tastes.... wow there is so much food.""   We had some glasses of wine,  or should I say, we had two glasses of cork-scented dishwater with a touch of oak. 1900 - 2008 must have been tough years for this one.  I think this place is packed because people are so full that they just don't leave.   Thanks for the gift card Trey, it was a romantic evening at the CF and my girlfriend and I are happy that we will be part of many a tourist photo album.  MEMORIES"
Brian F.,"Boston, MA",12,18,1,2.0,12/21/2008,"The cheesecake is decent but the service blows.  I think our server thought he was Kanye West.  After the hostess jammed us into the 2x3 table with 6 inches of space on each side, he quickly stopped by to say ""what up"". Well Kanye, I think your music is great, but it would be nice if I could get a refill on my $4 coke."
John P.,"Chicago, IL",31,11,1,1.0,8/12/2009,"My first review, and I pick an obvious one...Cheesecake Factory. Yes, I know the John Hancock location is a tourist trap, yes I should have known better, yes the prices are outrageous. Somehow, I'd never been there or any CF before.  What did I think of the food? Couldn't tell ya, we didn't get served.  People around us were getting served like crazy, people that were seated after us were being served, but not the wife & me. Sat there 30 minutes before storming off.  Can't say anything other than to avoid the shit out of this place."
Beth P.,"Chicago, IL",98,201,19,2.0,5/23/2008,"My family is visiting Chicago for the first time ever- and I've lived here for 3 years.  I had so many ideas of where to take them, but you know how it goes with visitors.  After a few sites, we found ourselves at the bottom of the John Hancock, and they wanted Cheesecake Factory next.   Ummm... We had a 3 and a 4 year old with us, and waited forever to be seated.  With all the tourists there with young children, I was surprised to find out that there is no section for kids foods in the novelesque menu.  Do they think they are really that fancy that they can't bother to have a kid's menu section?  Pssh.   We all know the portions are grotesquely huge, and tonight was no different.  But size isn't the only thing that matters, I guess.  I'm a fan of comfort food (lord help me) and I found the mashed potatoes and popcorn shrimp to be really good- not together though, ha.  Everything else (sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, corn mystery side dish) was flavorless.  Mac n Cheese balls- narsty!  Salad- brown lettuce?!? And I really don't like how all the servers wear tight, white, and most times a bit see-thru pants. ps- I don't like cheescake, but I heard that they do it well."
Hope G.,"Chicago, IL",39,33,,4.0,4/11/2009,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory alot. I've been to this particular location once, and ordered in once. My past two experiences with this place have signficantly increased my feelings towards their food. I once thought of this restaurant as pretty mediocre. The Thai Lettuce Wraps keeping me coming back. The three sauce combination is heavenly, the chicken is always smoky and tender and the butter lettuce cups are very refreshing. I would eat this great low carb dish all the time. More importantly, the past couple of times I've been extremely impressed with some of their other menu items that are pulling me away from my regular wrap order. The cashew chicken is served piping hot and has a delcious sweet and tangy sauce - really yummy! But once I tried my friends Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo order I was hooked. I stopped eating my own meal and just kept reaching across the table for more of his. Lucky for me, he liked the cashew chicken better and we switched. I'm obsessed with the gumbo and have searched long and hard for a copykat recipe. Perfection! Other appetizer options are tasty and worth mentioning, but they are too numerous to describe. You really can't go wrong. Beware of portion sizes on salads and entree items! Additionally, you should definitely get cheesecake! However, since you will be so full from your meal, I recommend doing what we did last time and ordering the cheesecake to arrive first. Take a few bites to tantalize your taste buds, and then set aside for after your main course. If you're still hungry, eat away, otherwise take it to go! This place will definitely make you fat! mmmmm...."
Gayle B.,"Centreville, MI",8,113,7,4.0,6/9/2011,Always a good meal & the peanut butter cheesecake was to die for.
Shannon H.,"Roscoe Village, Chicago, IL",134,148,93,2.0,2/9/2011,If you're looking for a place that will impress you with its ambience and you aren't worried about money then the Cheesecake Factory is for you. Otherwise the food is meh and pretty pricy. The Cheesecake is good though and the ambience is pretty cool. Honestly though the food is better at Grand Luxe so if your in Chicago you may want to skip The Cheesecake Factory since its a huge chain and save it for your local Cheesecake Factory.
Fate O.,"Chicago, IL",10,208,24,3.0,4/4/2011,"I wouldn't exactly say this is an accessible place. It was our half-anniversary dinner date and we had forgotten to make reservation but we were willing to wait more than one hour...  I thought that by looking at us, they would know we were on a special or romantic date (I should have told them but they were so occupied running around). They seated us in the most distracting area in middle (nowhere near window or in 2-seaters booth). This already dampen my mood a bit after having waited so long-- nonetheless, we proceed to try and make it pleasant.. that is, until the waiter neglected to be culturally aware (we had told him we're Deaf and he kept on talking and talking). What's more, we noticed everyone were getting bread baskets while they waited for their meals. Us? He did not even bring one to our table. I thought he might have fear of contracting our deafness so he didn't want to bother with us. How nice. It was only later until after our meals were we served a basket (by another server). There was yet a 3rd server who also came by-- she talked then show us what she was trying to say as if she was testing us-- I was a bit annoyed-- why was she talking if she knew we are Deaf? Customer service, 1 star. I had Chicken Bellagio- we both LOVE it. He had Famous Meatloaf- too spicy for us. We had Mango-Rasberry Iced drink-- YUM, we also LOVE this! All worth the price we paid, 4 stars. Average: 3 stars"
Saun C.,"Atlantic City, NJ",0,3,,5.0,11/11/2011,"I loved everything, cheesecakes are not so sweet just the way i like, next time i'll come for regular things like original cheesecake, last time i got pineapple upside down that was awesome, definitely come back:)"
Sandhya N.,"Chicago, IL",267,19,,1.0,9/7/2010,This place makes me want to vomit. I don't get the hype. I guess I heard the drinks are pretty good? I don't eat cheesecake so this place really didn't do anything for me.
Lora L.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,4.0,12/15/2011,I love Cheesecake Factory ! very big choice off food and drinks ! Service is good too ! Had my birthday there and I loved it !
Matthew E.,"Chicago, IL",130,191,7,3.0,7/6/2008,"Don't come here hungry, because it will take you at least 20 minutes just to go through all their menu items and decide on what sounds the best.  Three and a half stars would be given if possible. I love this restaurant, especially in a large group.  Everyone can get something they want without restricting the rest of the group to one type of culinary delight.   The cheesecake is also a MUST.  Chocolate cookie dough is always great, and so is Pineapple Upside Down, which unfortunately is only available seasonally.  The only main problem with this restaurant is that they don't take reservations and weekend nights usually mean long wait times."
Rebecca E.,"St George, UT",0,4,,3.0,7/20/2011,Great food as with all Cheesecake factories.  Our waitress was really great.  The design/architecture for this store was really ugly and weird.  Alot of it looked like giant hotdogs plastered to the ceiling
