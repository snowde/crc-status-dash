Gracie B.,"Jersey City, NJ",364,562,10,3.0,7/7/2007,"It's really hard to feign excitement over the cheesecake factory.  It's consistent if nothing else - so that's a plus. I went here with some family friends from southern Indiana.  I shared the Luau salad with my mom (really -  it's one of the best things on the menu).  And I had a pleasant Cheesecake factory meal...nothing bad...but not really anything to ""yelp"" about either. The bathroom, however, ick.  I don't know whose idea the little self-contained rooms were, but they STANK.  It felt like the closest I ever want to get to a prison toilet.  And it creates a long line when all you really want to do is wash your hands."
Bess R.,"Farmington, MI",72,378,,2.0,5/7/2008,"The food is pretty good for a slightly nicer TGIFriday's-ish place, but the portions are ridiculous.  I completely agree with Katie H.'s review. Since when did enormous portions = good cuisine?   Not for me.   Kids and tourists seem to like it though.   Guess the restaurant itself looks pretty cool.   Other than that.  Blah."
Misi P.,"Chicago, IL",80,461,4,3.0,9/16/2006,"I didn't find the prices abominable, 'specially for the mag mile, but the Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of those places you take your friend from outta town who doesn't eat anything outside of burgers and spaghetti to.  Big menu, but the food is standard fare, not ridiculously tasty or anything, but it works.   Service is just as bland as some of the entrees, but the cheesecake is always a winner, although I personally think I make a better cheese cake (I can rock a killer chocolate swirl turtle cheesecake.  booyah.)"
Rachel H.,"Chicago, IL",500,894,233,3.0,10/5/2006,I was thinking of mojitos and oddly enough it made me think of Cheescake Factory.  Lets just say its hard for me not to want to come over here and drink my lunch sometimes.  They are refreshing and pack some serious punch.  Anyway... This location looks as if you're inside some sort of fungus or maybe a blob of lard or something from all the weird blobby decor.  It's kind of strange.  I've had so many things here from the giant salads to the factory burger to the popcorn shrimp which are just a little spicy.  Right now I could go for the lemon roasted chicken which comes with some great potatoes.  I've been happy with everything I've gotten here.  And of course the desserts are to die for.  This location gets 3 stars because the service is kind of crap.
Jesster A.,"Evanston, IL",92,190,2,4.0,10/25/2006,"Ate at this location only once,  while waiting to visit a friend undergoing emergency surgery at NMH.  (I usually get talked in to going to the one at Old Orchard.)  I admire Sarah L. for being so observant* re: the bathroom STALL doors  (though her rational for the doors almost caused me to knock off a star from a restaurant chain that deserve high marks in the ""quality control"" department. ) Am I the only one who appreciates ""prompt service"" - but feels a tinge of disappointment/suspicion when the food arrives a little TOO fast? ""Inside of a gigantic cheesecake?""  ""Soft and weird."" Yes, that's how I felt as I waddled back to the OR waiting room."
Marissa B.,"Madison, WI",101,371,173,2.0,9/23/2007,"How'd I possibly end up here?!  Sigh. Oh yeah.  Out of town friends who reaaaallly wanted to go.  I would have thought that at 9pm on a Saturday night the wait would be shorter but I was wrong.  75-90 minutes - yikes.   The food was mediocre and the service was sloooooow.  No water or drink refills either.  I ordered a pizza that was supposed to come with artichokes, spinach, basil & tomato.  I searched and searched and all I could find were a few stray artichoke leaves scattered on my pizza.  Not chunks, not pieces of artichoke... I'm talking just a few, random, thin, little leaves.  I never found the basil.  Sadness!!   The crust was hard and coated in oil, not impressive.  They had no kids menu but they agreed to a ""kids size"" portion of pasta & sauce for $8.  It was a small bowl of bowtie pasta and a small (separate) bowl of marinara that looked like ragu.  Presentation: 0 points. I also have one beef with the bathrooms:  There are only sinks in each stall!  So if you need to just wash your hands, well, you're waiting in line with everyone else. BOTTOM LINE:  Not going back, unless there is some serious arm twisting.  You can do better, even on the Magnificent Mile... just venture out a block or two."
Sarah B.,"North Wales, PA",81,396,10,2.0,12/29/2005,"How often can I say, Tourist Trap?  Not enough, when it comes to Cheesecake Factory.  Service is nothing special and I always feel rushed by the servers.  Food is also nothing special; it holds mass appeal and comes in massive quantities and is always massively disappointing.  The interior is dark, and the only mood this lighting puts me in is mildly depressed. The redeeming quality: the cheesecake.  Under the mounds of whip cream and other toppings, they actually serve a sumptuous cheesecake--I recommend the take out counter."
Wendy Y.,"Chicago, IL",51,103,1,4.0,11/17/2008,"If you've been to one CF then you pretty much know the drill. Its a good place to go if you are with tourists, family, or when you are not in the mood for trying something new and different.  I haven't really had a bad meal here. In fact, the Chicken Madiera is really good. Dont go to the bathrooms unless you really have to, they are gross. We put our name in, walked around WaterTower, then came back so the wait wasn't that long. But the 10 minutes we had to wait was an absolute nightmare because it is such a clusterf*ck in the waiting area. Be warned- put your name in and then walk around for a bit.  There is no reason to sit around there, getting crowd-rage."
Ms T.,"Chicago, IL",33,131,,1.0,5/29/2007,"I hate this place. I hate this place. I hate this place. Its loud, full of tourist, the silverware was filthy and the food not that good.   Who the hell cares if you get enough to take home if it tastes like crap.  Twice as much crap is just more crap. I'd rather put some hot sauce on some toilet paper and eat it."
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,5.0,7/25/2006,"Having grown up with the SoCal locales and now the NorCal locales, I'm always surprised how consistent the food is here. This is evidence that Cheesecake Factory employs mad culinary scientists. How else could you explain travelling 1500+ miles and the food tasting like you had it back home with a menu this huge-mungous? An extra star for the cool locale in the Hancock tower. The SF local is at the top floor of the Macy's building and it's too bad the restaurant here wasn't at the top too :)"
Carlos C.,"Dallas, TX",406,206,988,4.0,10/25/2007,"If you've been to ONE cheescake factory.. you've seen them all. Food is really good (not great) and the portions are HUGE. Don't fool yourself.... share a dang main dish and get some CHEESECAKE! My favorite..... 25th anniversary Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake... Hmmm.... you WILL WAIT to sit so do what I do... GO TO THE BAR!  I have no shame, I'll eat at the bar and order a coke!"
Laur T.,"New York, NY",26,780,,3.0,12/29/2008,"3.5 stars! Eons ago, this was my first visit to the cheesecake factory. Yep I know it's a chain but back then, it was pretty cool. Food is your average fare but the sizes of those cakes surely take one's breath away. I remember this fondly because it was such an experience, with tons of people waiting in line to get in and the vibe from the restaurant within was so high that I was thinking to myself after, hmmm I should probably take this franchise outside of the US. All talk and no action...heh."
Lauren P.,"Chicago, IL",98,118,,4.0,11/11/2007,"Yes, all Cheesecake Factories are the same....delicious!   Reasonably priced food, huge portions and a great variety on the menu?  Plus they have amazing cheesecake? Come on, you have to like this place.  My recommendation - get something that you can eat the next day, and take half of it home.  That way you'll have room for dessert - which really, is the whole point of the restaurant!"
Erica K.,"Chicago, IL",91,211,,2.0,10/27/2008,"This place, as many tourist traps on the Mag Mile do, raises prices on average or below average food because they think people don't know the difference. Well, I hate to tell you Cheesecake Factory, but I know good fish when I taste it and I'm just not into your pseudo asian fusion appetizers. They're not fresh, they're over seasoned (SOY SAUCE?), and just plain not good. And your decor sucks. Really. Sucks. With so much good food in the city and trains that are easy to navigate, I have no idea why people bother with this. Even Frommers has better suggestions for places to eat than Cheesecake Factory....so there's no reason to suggest people can't find anything else. Edit: Also, there is far better cheesecake to be found."
Charlotte O.,"Chicago, IL",68,161,,5.0,11/18/2008,"I understand that this is a chain, and also a tourist trap with super long wait time, but I really enjoyed my visit here, so much so that it does deserve it's five stars.  It was my birthday. My S.O. wanted to take me out for dinner and when He asked what I wanted, I told him steak. He had me flip a coin and though I had no idea what that meant at the time, My choice had led us here.  We got itnand had a long long wait. The booth however was pretty comfortable, and we were really in no rush so the wait didn't bother me. It was kinda fun to people watch and listen to the different crowd noises. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory so I had no idea what to expect.  When we finally sat down at our table we were greeted by a really friendly waitress. All smiles, and as far as I could tell she was not faking her friendlyness which made it all the more nice. She made great conversation with through our meal, even listened when I told her that the milk steamer on their espresso machine was clogged. ( I had been a barista for a couple years at that point...they make a very loud distinctive noise when they are clogged and I know that noise when I hear it)  The menu was huge, which I think would make it a good place to bring a group to, because there is bound to be something for everyone on it. We each ordered our steaks. They came out at just the right temp and mine was perfectly medium rare. It was a really good steak! I was really surprised who knew that with a name like ""Cheesecake Factory"" they could make a good steak? (Glad my S.O. knew that though!)  During our meal my S.O. had wondered off, he said he wanted to see if they had his favorite kind of cheesecake, well when it was time for dessert I found out the real reason. He went off to tell our waitress that it was my Birthday, and convinced her and a different waitress to sink happy birthday to me. Here they come just after we finished our meal, carrying this plate that said ""Happy Birthday Char"" on the edges in chocolate syrup, and a big piece of cheesecake with a candle in it. After I blew it out, I was told it was the six carb cheesecake. How lovely! He had told them that I was on Atkins. (at the time anyway!)  I gotta say...It was really tasty! It had the same flavor as cheesecake, only difference really was the texture. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful birthday meal!"
Stephanie L.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,4.0,8/15/2011,"My boyfriend and I love to eat at Cheesecake Factory. We usually have no complaints and the food is always consistent and great. This past weekend we went for dinner and sat in the bar area. Our waiter, Adam, was wonderful. Very knowledgeable about the menu, energetic and nice. I ordered the buffalo chicken tenders (highly recommend them), and the server accidentally brought me wings instead of strips. Not a big deal, however Adam was very attentive to the situation and extremely apologetic. He made sure that we were taken care of and even sent us home with a free piece of cheesecake! Despite the little mix up, our experience was very enjoyable and we will of course be back there soon!"
B L.,"Chicago, IL",0,62,,3.0,5/16/2011,"Be prepared for a loooooooooong wait, as no reservations are taken. Food was OK most times I was there, but the last time I had shrimp it was over over seasoned and I had to scrape the sauce off.  A simple sauce would have been just lovely.  Wait staff has always been fine.  LOVELY atmosphere."
James C.,"Chicago, IL",36,80,3,2.0,2/27/2008,"Are you a tourist? Then don't go..screaming kids will scream no more! Its always packed with 300 pounds of tourists and for what? The payoff is comparable or lower then most Chicago joints off the Mile.  I got the hamburger.. cant remember the name, the waiter didnt warn me at all that the whole cow is included. Normally that wouldn't phase me one bit. But they put all kinds of junk on it. Tasty no..."
Marcel M.,"Chicago, IL",22,209,44,5.0,5/22/2006,"Do I even need to review this place?  It's been consistent no matter what city I've been to.  Some highlights:  Avocado eggroll appetizers, tons of fun burger, thai noodle salad, navajo sandwich, everything. Here's a tip at this location though.  It never fails us.  Go in at anytime and bypass the line.  Go to the bar area and find an open seat.  Sit down and enjoy.   If someone does smoke, you can barely smell it since it's pretty airy.   If you are in a big group, sorry, you have to wait. But for all you couples standing there and waiting with your buzz lightyear device in your back pocket, sit your butt down and order already."
miss a.,"Chicago, IL",6,59,138,4.0,3/5/2011,i like their food.  noisy crowd but it's ok for those that can hold conversations without others eavesdropping.  a very busy location
