Misse D.,"Chicago, IL",377,591,3,5.0,6/1/2006,"This is a great place to take out of town guests.  The decor is unique, the food is consistently good, and it's right on Michigan Ave.  I love to dine here and then go up to the Hancock Observatory. The wait?  It's long.  Very, very long."
Sarah L.,"Binghamton, NY",28,227,,5.0,10/22/2006,"God do I love the cheesecake factory.  Notable features of this one that set it apart from others I have been to: 10 foot tall mahogony doors with gigantic nickel doorknobs and heavy brass locks... ON THE BATHROOM STALLS.  My dining party surmised that this may be due to the abnormally high amount of purging that occurs in cheesecake factory bathrooms. Interior that over and over again makes you wonder if the designers who created this particular dining environment wanted you to feel like you were in fact inside a gigantic cheesecake. Newly installed computerized kitchen which, no shit, led to our food being delivered about 3 minutes after we ordered it even though there were easily 100 people in the restaurant."
Meow P.,"Munster, IN",68,84,4,2.0,7/23/2007,"This place is so nostalgic of dinners following high school dances, but you know what? I've never liked it. Not even the cheesecake. The food is average. It's pretty much the same exact stuff you could get at Houlihan's or any of your ""fancier"" Applebee's-type places. It's not bad, but nothing is ever very memorable and there isn't a single dish that I'd return again and again for. THAT's what I look for in a restaurant, and obviously The Cheesecake Factory doesn't have it. I really don't like heavy cheesecakes at all. I'm probably a bit of a cheesecake snob, but I much rather prefer the real deal. I like the light, fluffy Italian-style cheesecakes made with mascarpone and ricotta--the kind of cheesecakes you can actually savor throughout the process of eating a slice! Here, you have 6 pounds of cream cheese mixed with some sugar. I mean, obviously it doesn't taste bad, but it's just so gosh-darn rich that after one bite, your mouth goes numb and you lose all taste.  And for me, the worst part is, they always get me on these awesome-sounding cheesecake flavors, so of course, I have to get a slice. How could you pass up chocolate coconut or chocolate peanut butter cookie dough or even fresh banana? But then I try a bite or two and I'm sick of cheesecake for the next year-and-a-half.  I don't know. Maybe I just don't have enough estrogen flowing throughout my body to truly appreciate The Cheesecake Factory. I'll probably love it once I hit menopause. Or maybe I'll just go there after I watch a Golden Girls marathon on Lifetime. I'm sure it will hit the spot."
Shaina H.,"Pacific, WA",55,12,1,3.0,2/6/2011,"I know this franchise is everywhere, but I was in Chicago, on a beautiful day, craving some cheesecake. Nuff' said. Well the out side of the  building is very unique and inviting, but once you get in it had an odor. (I;m sorry but odors in restaurants are the worst, the food can be fantastic but if you're smelling dirty dishwater the whole time it ruins the meal) Also the staff was not to charming. The place was empty and they still acted like they were under staffed and weren't ever accommodating. I ordered the red velvet with white chocolate frosting. I added on some strawberries and it was delicious. Cakes are great, but needs to work on that customer service."
Gary D.,"Fullerton, CA",12,48,1,3.0,9/20/2008,"Since living in Chicago for less than a month, my wife and I have been keeping franchises down to a minimum. We had a giftcard to use so we gave this ""Mad Hatter"" design location a shot. If you like busy restaurants with franchise-style service and the comfort of the safety net it provides on your tongue then givet this place a try. There were 3 things I enjoyed at this restaurant, and one you can't get anywhere else. First there was the decor. I thought I was on the set of ""Alice and Wonderland"" but Johnny Depp or Tim Burton weren't here. It's a big place so you're bound to get seating right away.  Second, there was the cherry soda that is served with grenadine. If you drink like a fish and hate to wait for refills, then you're in luck because it's like ordering at 7eleven. I ordered the Cajun Chicken sandwich which was bland, perfect if you like family-style restaurants.  And last but not least, there was my wife. I had a good time dining out with her and talking about our following day's activities. Only two things I'm happy with here are on the menu, and they aren't that mind blowing to get you here. The Miso Salmon is good here as well as the selection of cheesecake."
Nikki N.,"Indianapolis, IN",19,4,,1.0,3/19/2011,"Husband and I went for dinner. It was very crowded but we did not have to wait long to sit in the in the cafe part of the resturant. We sat about 45 minutes with jus drinks. I ordered tea and water. It the waiter about 10 minutes to bring back splenda because there was none already on the table and ha forgot the water and had to go back again to get the water. We sat waiting while a party of two seated before us left and two parties. Of two seated after us was halfway finished their food. Manager came to us, asked if we were ok. After telling him no, he started making excuses for the waiter saying it's only been 20 minutes and my waiter started getting sick and that was not true because he was taking care of everyone around us. I took my salad that I waited 45 minutes for out. That's to long to wait for a salad and pasta dish that I know is already pre made."
Leang E.,"Chicago, IL",406,2004,522,4.0,6/6/2007,"I know I can be so anti-chain restaurants, but this place has such a huge menu and variety that there's usually something for everyone.  Plus, the service I had here was pretty good.  Even though there was a wait, the host let us know that there was an empty table at the bar.  This was great because we were looking to eat and head out to see a musical.  I had a margarita that tasted like lemonade.  It definitely makes it different, and I'm not quite sure if I ike that or not.  I ordered the griled chicken and avocado sandwich substituting the fries with a salad.  It was very tasty!  I love avocados.  Our waiter was quick and very friendly, and he was quite charming.  If the line isn't long, I don't mind coming here, and during the summer it usually is.."
Scott C.,"Royal Oak, MI",3,12,,5.0,3/14/2011,Had Sunday brunch here and glad we did!  Great sized lunch/brunch portions almost to much for a very reasonable price.  The atmosphere was great and the restaurant itself was really cool to look around in.  Food was very good reasonably priced and of course great cheesecake.
Mike P.,"Highland Park, IL",139,618,36,3.0,7/26/2006,"Coming from any direction, You pass at least 500 hundred restaurants that are superior to The Cheesecake Factory.  If a good restaurant is Walt Disney World, then The Cheesecake Factory is Euro-Disney. Just get the cheesecake to go.  Don't subject yourself to the hit or miss qualities of this suck-hole of an eating establishment. The cheesecake gives them 3 stars.  If not for that, Negative 20 stars."
A M.,"Olympia, WA",1,263,,2.0,5/19/2006,"The place was crowded with people who won't be coming back.  Beneath the roaring chatter, I could hear a pulsing bass sequence looping endlessly. The food was bland and a little greasy.  It came in large portions, which could be a plus or a minus. We had perfect service.  It's too bad that it was wasted on a place like this."
Ang R.,"Chicago, IL",8,311,,3.0,10/7/2006,"The cheesecake is great.  Let's just get that out of the way.  It's so good that I don't mind the high prices.  It's just the rest of the food which is on the mediocre side for such high prices. But I want to stress that it's a perfectly acceptable meal.  There's nothing at all objectionable about this place, and that might be the best thing about it.  You can probably order almost anything on the menu and be content with it.  And the portions, to be fair, are huge.  I ordered a smaller lunch portion salad to go along with the table's nacho appetizer, and it was gigantic.  I'm glad I didn't order a full portion of something.  My boyfriend had the pulled pork, which looked more like pulled pork shreds for a giant.  But they tasted good enough, so the weirdness wasn't an issue. Oh.  And the inside is...rather overdone.  But in a kind of impressive sort of a way."
Heather K.,"Ada, MI",39,35,11,5.0,8/5/2007,"Cool bathroom!  I'm serious--you have to check it out if you go.  By the way, the food is amazing.  Huge portions!  And obviously, their cheesecake is great!"
Jackie R.,"IL, IL",34,138,8,3.0,6/25/2008,"The food here is OK, if you like ordinary food. There is really no reason to go here- Chicago is a huge foodie city, so why spend $$$ on food you could make at home? Shrimp Scampi? Caesar Salad? Psssch. Sometimes there is a 2+ hour wait, sometimes the service sucks. Sometimes not. Its really hit or miss. The only reason I go here is when visitors are like ""OMG! Cheesecake Factory!!! We have to go!!!"" Even though they have a Cheesecake Factory in their own home town... If you must have an over-sized piece of cheesecake, send someone in to get it from the front counter and then run in the opposite direction and go seek out food that makes dining out worth while."
Ron A.,"Burbank, CA",46,30,38,4.0,9/16/2010,"Love the food but its super hectic.  One day the line was about 2 hours long the next day an hour.  When we finally got in, Kate our waitress made it a lot better. Food was usual Cheesecake Factory good and even though it was busy we were left alone to sit and enjoy our food.  Definetly a revisit if you can get in."
U P.,"Chicago, IL",3,83,7,2.0,9/12/2012,"I really dislike this restaurant. Every time I've been here (which, logically, wasn't many times) the food was less than mediocre. Their overpriced pasta is stale and looks like they just got it out of a dryer, where it's been mingling with some socks. The words heavy and anti-digestive come to mind when I start thinking about their food. Cheesecakes, an even more overpriced item, are alright; tiramisu was one of the least tasty once I've ever tried. I don't know what the big deal is about this place? Why the prices? To cover overhead for the rent, perhaps...that's the only excuse I can come up with. Btw has anyone else noticed that the ceiling of the restaurant at Michigan kind of looks like you are sitting inside of a fat person's colon? lmao. I think the servers are pretty good there so that's one plus."
Rocky B.,"Los Angeles, CA",202,527,16,3.0,6/20/2007,"I'm not necessarily a fan of eating at this place. I mean with long lines, less than mediocre service and just okay food...I'd rather skip it.  The real deal here for me is the Carrot Cake. OMG, it is awesome! I can just walk in, and yeah I wait in a bit of a line at the counter, place my order and boom...walk out with a huge, honking slice of Carrot Cake. So good, so fresh and topped with whipped cream. You take that out and sit on the steps by the water wall and there is nothing more perfect."
Carrie B.,"Chicago, IL",67,128,2,5.0,7/21/2006,"Although the portions are huge, they have the biggest menu I've ever seen! The chinese chicken salad is my favorite- just order it without the heaping pile of crispy foam wonton thingys. The pastas, sandwiches and other entrees are excellent and perfect for sharing. Even the cheese pizza is pretty tasty. The thai lettuce wraps make a great appetizer to share, also. They also have a great drink selection... and if you still have room in your stomach, you must order a slice of their signature cheesecake. Anything chocolatey gets a 2 thumbs up in my book.  (Not to hate, but I just found out that  one slice of the Outrageous Chocolate Cake has a whooping 1,380 calories!!!! DUH)  While some dishes are better than others, you can't go wrong here. Just be prepared to wait a while for a table on any given night of the week, or score a smaller table in the bar if you can. Also, it's an unavoidable tourist trap on any given weekday or weekend, so be prepared to wait and fight the crowds for a table at the bar."
Neetha G.,"Chicago, IL",0,21,,2.0,12/16/2011,"I like this place and its in a nice location, however the wait took forever! Poor service. Our server didn't even come to our table until we said something about 20 mins later, then it took another 10 min's to get someone. Our drinks also came in slow. How hard is it to get non alcoholic drinks? But, the food was great. I like the avocado appetizers. My fav!"
Maria R.,"IL, IL",175,150,28,3.0,5/8/2007,"Normally you wouldn't catch me in a chain restaurant, but I was actually surprised with the quality of food.  We had the salmon eggrolls that were very tasty with red cabbage and my husband had surf & turf...not bad.  I had a chinese chicken salad and although I had had better, this was ok.  Downside: It is way too busy for me and the hosts have some major attitude - especially the very rude dude Michael who walks around with a headset ignoring everyone.  BTW, the cheesecake was great - it tasted whipped and creamy. yum."
C M.,"New York, NY",267,454,791,4.0,6/25/2009,"When an establishment names itself as the ""Cheesecake Factory"", all other edible offerings ranging from appetizers to entrees should be secondary (if not tertiary) to the Cheesecake.  Of course, having been rendered as the Cheesecake that trumps a certain Chicago staple (for which I will omit), a visitation to the highly renowned Cheesecake Factory must be partaken. The Decor:  Situated in the subterranean level of the John Hancock building, the cavernous modeling of the Cheesecake Factory provides a strange yet welcoming atmospheric feel.  At first entry, patrons will have the option of indoor or outdoor seating.  Immediate entry into the restaurant will reveal the delicious cheesecake offerings available for purchase.  Options ranging from the Classic Plain Cheesecake to Strawberry Shortcake are on full display for purchase either by slice or as a whole.  To further enter the establishment is to understand the cavernous nature and design of the establishment. As patrons further enter The Cheesecake Factory, the lighting of the establishment is engulfed by low lit tungsten fluorescent, thus enhancing the cavernous design of the walls.  Patrons may find the interior to possess a subtle claustrophobic and blinding feel.  What's also daunting, but slightly attractive (with respects to the design), is the echoing capacity of the facility.  Given the excess of 300 patrons that dine during any given second at this establishment, the echoing roar of sporadic conversation increases the decibels levels of the establishment. The Food: Entree - Energy Breakfast:  The ""Energy Breakfast"" consists of 3 Scrambled Egg Whites that's served with 3 oz. of Grilled Chicken Breast, Sliced Tomato, and Sauteed Mushroom &amp; Spinach.  At first glance, the first visually disturbing site, with respects to the execution of this dish, is the rendering of water from the cooked spinach.  The bottom of the plate was littered with the liquid excess.  This aided in the diluting of the simple seasoning used in the preparation of this application.  Upon consumption, the Egg Whites contained a supremely coarse texture, thus indicating overcooking.  The Chicken Breasts were excessively overcooked and under seasoned, with the texture of the chicken to be coarse.  The sliced tomatoes were the victims of the excess liquid flow as they become mushy and inedible.  The ultimate welcoming aspect of the dish was the sauteed spinach &amp; mushrooms.  Both were cooked perfectly and contained the earthiness found in both ingredients. The Dessert: Strawberry Cheesecake: At first reception, the excessive portion size of the Cheesecake spoke wonders to the receiving eye.  Patrons will notice that the 10 oz. to 12 oz. serving size of the Cheesecake will force any patron to seek a take out box.  Luckily, the excessive offerings produced a welcoming satiety to those seeking gluttonous punishment.  During visual inspection, the Cheesecake was observed to have the proper white color that's accompanied by an elegant soft texture.  The graham cracker crust, acting as the base of the foundation, contained a semi-firm texture.  Finally, the Fresh Strawberries and syrup produced an excellent color contrast to the application.  At first bite, patrons will find that the primary taste observed is from the light, velvety, and fluffy cheesecake.  During consumption, the creamy texture of the application engulfs the palate by releasing the notable cream cheese flavors.  Further tasting will reveal notes of vanilla, brown sugar, and butter, which enhance the creaminess of the cheese by providing a subtle sweetness.  All ingredients used in the creation of the cheesecake work harmoniously to create both an abundance of flavors while keeping the subtle soft texture of the cake.  To aid in the textural contrast, the semi-crunchy graham cracker crust provided the scrumptious texture and cinnamon flavors to further enhance the cheesecake.  Although the Strawberries provided the round about freshness and earthiness to the application, it acted secondary to the palate consuming flavors of the cheesecake. Perhaps perfection is observed through The Cheesecake Factory's rendition of Cheesecake.  By creating an edible that embodies the palate clasping flavors of the ingredients used while keeping the integrity and structure of the creaminess of the cheese, the application stands above the rest in both the complexity and tasting of this application.  Few remarkable words can be noted regarding the superb execution of the cheesecake, but the ones rendered should be emphasized for it's extraordinary flavors and execution. Notes on Cheesecake Factory: 1) Cheesecake = $6.00 to $7.00, but well worth it. 2) Avoid the long wait...  Simply get the Cheesecake to go. 3) Avoid the food!  A lot of my party felt the food was lack and the star is the Cheesecake. 4) Service was chaotic due to the increased customer to wait staff ratio. 5) Seriously...  Just go for the Cheesecake!"
