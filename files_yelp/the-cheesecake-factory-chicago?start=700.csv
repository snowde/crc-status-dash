Matt S.,"Houston, TX",7,9,,5.0,10/25/2007,All Cheesecake Factories are awesome.  what makes this one so good is the 4 hour wait in line.  I too eat at the bar saves a lot of time.   Tiramisu Cheesecake maybe one of my favorite things to eat in the world...... this side of Chicago Pizza and one of those good Italian Beef Sandwhichs or well everything is good to eat in Chicago.
John S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",58,32,14,3.0,8/9/2010,"this place is ok. they give you huge portions, for it to be located in downtown chicago, right on michigan ave, the food cost wasnt that bad. i spent 87$, tax include, but for that i got two appetizers, to meals, a pop, and two slices of cheesecake. and out of that, we each took half of our food home to eat later. that wasnt bad at all however, once you add in parking, 25$, it gets pricey. we got there on a late sunday afternoon and had around a 30 minute wait, but it didnt seem that long. the food was average, i have had better. the star of the show is the cheesecake. i had the raspberry-lemon cheesecake and my wife had the pineapple upside down cheesecake. both were very good. in hindsight, i would have rather just had a couple of pieces of cheesecakes instead of the food."
Lee C.,"Toronto, Canada",4,10,25,1.0,9/3/2012,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo and have had a pleasant experience each time.  On a trip to Chicago, I wasn't expecting anything less and sadly the experience was way below par. The floor was slippery from my table all the way to bathroom... the Blackhawks could have held a practice session on this floor. The restaurant was jam packed and obviously understaffed because the service was terrible.  The food was horribly timed as well.  Our table had ordered 3 fish tacos with 1 grilled and 2 tempura.  How could they serve 1 tempura while the other 2 didn't come out for a good 20 minutes?  At the very least, the 2 tempuras should be served at the same time.  That was the story for everybody else's dinners; nothing came out at the same time.  The tempura taco itself was completely overstuffed and the first taco itself was soggy (and an absolute mess to eat) as a result.  The last taco you eat will be the soggiest since it's been bathing in its own juices the entire time.  Simple requests like salad dressing on the side were completely ignored, as were requests for lime wedges that weren't bone dry. As for dessert?  Somehow they still managed to mess that up by serving the strawberry shortcake long after the rest of us received and finished eating our cheesecakes. Our waiter apologized for the service and said that the weekend before school starts in September is when they get slammed the hardest.  This is still no excuse for the restaurant if it were properly run.  Save your money and skip this location; it was a complete disgrace."
Geno T.,"Chicago, IL",45,54,73,4.0,6/15/2007,"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but MY GOODNESS...I LOVE CHEESECAKE..and when it comes to a grand offering of cheesecakes, there is no better place than the Cheesecake Factory! But aside from deserts, the Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed me with their dishes of culinary delights. They are always tasty and well-portioned. Mmmm..mmmm...Absolutely delicious and I must say this is perhaps one of my favorite places in town for a late lunch or early dinner.  Ooooh Soo Good :-) 4 out of 5 stars, losing one star only because it is a chain restaurant on paper...even though not in taste :-)"
Food Junkie S.,"Chicago, IL",88,173,,1.0,12/22/2011,"went here with my wife for a quick dinner. The waiter took our order and everything seemed to be normal. After we placed our orders, we waited over 20 min to receives our drinks, which I think is unacceptable. Nonetheless we ignored it. Our app. came out shortly after. We ordered a burger and after waiting 45 min, we still had not received any food. We had to ask for refills. The server was beyond rude. When we asked when our food was coming, he said it hadn't been that long and that he would check. Instead he walks by and brings the manager. This is unacceptable at any restaurant. No one should ever have to wait 50 min for food that never came out. The server (Brian I think -bar area) should be fired. The food was terrible. The manager apologized and assured us he would make it right next time. Too bad, we will not be returning. I understand it just a burger and I'm not spending a lot of money, but this kind of service and wait time is unacceptable for any establishment.  The manager has wrapped up our burger to go. The togo box had a Grand Lux logo on it. Thought I had gone to Cheesecake.... avoid this place and save your money and time."
Brandon B.,"Chicago, IL",497,1237,603,3.0,9/28/2007,"I think every time I eat here the whole experience gets a little less special.   Why?  Maybe I'm getting more mature?  Maybe the white generic suburbanite from nowhereville America is slowly oozing out of me from the unique tastes of Chicago over many years?  I shouldn't flatter myself.   Maybe its the mega mentality (mega wait, mega menu, mega fem waiters (not complaining), mega partions (my salad was the size of a 400lb man's omentum), mega loud, mega annoying people who think this is a fancy place.   I have to admit the architecture is pretty cool though...I feel so healthy eating a salad dinner, if I ignore the fact it was 3000 calories!  And they offered cracked pepper!  How fancy!!"
Cely R.,"Chicago, IL",57,510,8765,5.0,8/4/2010,"wonderfull experince in sunday nite!!! hope all the restaurants can be like this good food,good price nice friendly staff:).....we try the fried calamary,chicken sliders,pita and bean dip  apple crisp and vanilla ice cream and factory hot coco we definally come back soon  love it:)"
Kathleen C.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",69,206,,5.0,4/25/2006,"I hate tourists. Therefore I must really love Cheesecake Factory considering the fact that I'm willing to wait amongst 350 morons from Wisconsin just to get their nachos. Say what you will about touristy chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory never fails to impress. Bests: Nachos, Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club, Santa Fe Salad (lunch size is almost small enough to finish), pumpkin pie cheesecake."
Rich K.,"Miami, FL",85,273,28,3.0,5/2/2010,"Great management, called last minute on a Sunday morning for a table of 20.  The place was packed, no problem with seating.  Food was normal for a Cheesecake restaurant, everyone seemed pleased with their meals."
Izzy N.,"Portland, OR",675,892,409,1.0,5/3/2009,"Customer service blew hardcore. After realizing that my friend had never received her credit card back at cheesecake 10 minutes later, (we were in Victoria's Secret by then so it was a short walk) we immediately turned around and told them what happened. Everyone was clueless, non chalant when it came to trying to find the card after checking back in person later that evening and via phone call. Here's an idea, cut the crap and double check with our waiter! I had a cheese steak sandwich and subway could have made a better sandwich. Oh well. I knew I should have just ordered cheesecake for lunch. On a nicer note.. we were seated quickly during lunch (weekday) and the crab rangoon was pretty good even though it looks like they don't know how to wrap those things. It's cool. but they're still DEAD TO ME."
Esther G.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,5.0,2/21/2013,"We loved the hospitality, the service was very kind and the food was great. Specially the cheesecake. If you are not really hungry or hungry at all then order the cheesecake only, cause it's worthy to try it!"
Ray L.,"San Diego, CA",201,236,,4.0,10/10/2006,"Why eat the food here when you can just try playing the - How much of this huge cheesecake can I eat game.    hint: only kewl people eat the raspberry truffle.  Don't be a pussy and get a single slice, you know this stuff is gorge-worthy so just practice bulimia if you must... it's that good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I can definitely live without it.  Every time I eat a cheesecake I know that my whole month at the gym was just wasted."
Shay F.,"Las Vegas, NV",78,75,30,2.0,4/3/2012,"Watched the busboy clean off a dirty table and then proceed to shine silverware with the same dirty dish rag he washed the table down with.  The hostess was getting ready to seat a couple at the table the newly ""cleaned"" silverware was sitting on and I let her know to swap out the utensils due to what I had just witnessed. I then asked our waitress to swap our's out as well since I was pretty sure the same busboy had set our table as well. The manager came over and apologized, which was nice, and he assured me he'd speak with the busboy. Aside from that stomach turning experience, the service was friendly and swift and the food was good.  The bathroom was dirty too....maybe I witnessed a pattern with this particular location?  With this catering to a large tourist base, I suggest they need to work harder on clean up and upkeep. Good location, friendly staff and decent food but because of the lack of cleanliness I just can't give this any more than 2 stars...borderline 1 star."
Lonniece B.,"Chicago, IL",2,43,,2.0,1/13/2010,"This is a good place to take out of town guest. For a born and breed Chicagoan, it's just another tourist trap. The food is mediocre at best, prices are expected to be high since it's downtown. The waitress we had screw up everyones order (twice), one of the darkest restaurants I've been to and it had no personality. I would only return if no other option was available."
Celeste C.,"Bellevue, WA",35,224,5,5.0,3/2/2007,Always love The Cheesecake Factory not matter what state I am in. It's a good stand by. When my husband and I were checking out grad schools here in Chicago we stayed right by here.  The waitress we had was really sweet and when she found out we were celebrating our anniversary ; she brought a happy anniversary slice of cheesecake for us to share!!  So romantic.  Oh just gives me the goosebumps.
Joshua M.,"Chicago, IL",96,340,17,3.0,3/10/2008,"The only reason to go here is if you have friends or family in town, and they're ""absolutely dying to try out 'The Cheesecake Factory.'""  I went with a(n ex-)friend of mine who was from Arkansas... We had a $300 bill (not surprising here - the prices are outrageous), and he STIFFED the (awesome) waiter and pocketed the tip money I figured into my half of the bill. I felt so bad, I never went back."
Lyn B.,"Chicago, IL",0,140,,2.0,1/21/2013,"I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory in general, since it's a reliable chain, and great for kids.  But, we're in Chicago, and there are too many other amazing restaurants, which is why I have to ding this one.  The food is fine, and the service is good too, but as the 2 rating description goes: ""Meh.  I've experienced better."""
Sue K.,"Lake County, IL",44,167,9,3.0,8/28/2010,"It's just a little too cheesy. There's something about the decor of this place that puts me off. Great effort has been made to make you feel like you're in the middle of a piece of cheese cake - with puffy yellow walls and swirls everywhere. The fact that it's basement level makes it weirder. Maybe a great place for kids after a hard shopping day - or if you're a cheese cake fanatic.  The food menu is supposed to be good, but looks like it could get hectic during busy times."
Bethany S.,"South Lyon, MI",12,72,14,4.0,3/24/2010,"HUGE PORTIONS! You must try the chicken samosas...  they are absolutely fantastic.  The pear martini was wonderful...  we had amazing food the night we were there.  We split a burrito, wanting a light dinner since we were planning on going out later that night.  The burrito, even after we split it, was enough for a complete dinner portion for each of us.  Of course we had to try the limoncello cake afterward which also didn't disappoint.  We're still dreaming of the chicken samosas.  It was a pricey dinner and totally worth every penny."
Wesley H.,"Chicago, IL",7,15,,4.0,8/26/2010,"I have been here many times and always love coming here, especially when I'm starving! I have a big appetite, and the portions here are very large, but still have great flavor as if it were created on a smaller scale. The location cannot be beat; right on the bottom floor of the Hancock Center - across the street from Water Tower Place and many stores. The atmosphere is really neat also. There is a lot of attention to detail and I would describe the atmosphere as if you were submerged in a dessert wonderland (the ceiling is made to look like a pie lattice) . This restaurant so far has my all time favorite dessert - the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. With ice cream, this rich fluffy cheesecake is the cure to any chocolate sweet tooth. The meals do get a bit pricey if you add drinks and the dessert, but definitely worth it."
