Melissa P.,"Chicago, IL",8,132,69,4.0,3/18/2012,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory.  They have the best cheesecake I've ever had anywhere.  I've tried to make cheesecake like theirs at home and just can't do it.  I've tried so many times and made so many recipes and they will never be as good as this place.  The only reason I give them 4 stars is because sometimes the wait for a table or even to get just cheesecake is bad.  They really need more help sometimes or maybe just to hurry up a bit.  I've had their salmon a couple times too and that is also delicious and their mashed potatoes are to die for, but I primarily stop by there for cheesecakes.  I really shouldn't eat that stuff because I need to lose weight, but I can't help myself and keep on going back.  That is how good they are that even a diet can't keep me away.  So go on and try them out if it's not too busy around there.  Probably the best time to go is during the week in the evenings.  On the weekends they are too packed with tourists a lot.  Not that I blame them for wanting some of that creamy goodness of cheesecake.  So yeah I say go try it out if you like cheesecake or are shopping at the Water Tower mall and get hungry."
Meghan B.,"Bloomington, IL",104,298,60,3.0,3/15/2008,"Eh.  Never really as bad as I think it's going to be.   My mom and sister love to come here when they're in town, so we go.  Seems the wait has decreased in the last year or so.  That's usually the worst part. The menu is huge, the service has always been friendly, and the cheesecake is of course very good. I'd never go here on purpose, but it's fine when family's in town."
A C.,"Oak Brook, IL",7,158,3,4.0,7/10/2010,This place is PACKED on a Friday or Saturday night.  The patio is very nice!  The Cheesecake is Oustanding! The Pulled Pork sandwich is surprisingly good!  Of course all of their burgers are delicious as well!
Brianna L.,"Chicago, IL",168,360,490,5.0,1/10/2010,i am the HUGEST fan of their Evelyn's pasta dish..i think thats what its called? minus the pine nuts!! and i also LOVE the salmon bc the tartar sauce if you can even call it that is yum-() bc of the dill it has in it love love love the dill!!
Linh L.,"Chicago, IL",393,642,712,3.0,2/27/2007,"service was good. Food was okay. Their food doesn't make me crave for it. Steak is nasty. Their desert is rich, but I could eat it. I love their brown bread though. They have one of the best places for bread."
Sasha M.,"Chicago, IL",15,35,2,3.0,2/23/2010,My chicken and mushroom pizza tasted like it was thrown in the microwave. That sh** was a soggy mess but whatever. The red velvet cheesecake is still the sh** though. POW!!
Diana S.,"San Mateo, CA",82,315,18,3.0,1/30/2008,"This place has fun decor and huge portions. The menu can be really overwhelming because it's like an entire book. There is way too much to choose from. Make sure to save room for the cheesecake.  Personally, I think Grand Lux is a lot better, but that could be because I love the beignets and they don't have those here."
Dee W.,"Evanston, IL",187,1570,1299,4.0,11/21/2005,Cheesecake - why else would you come here?  The wait is hella long but the cheesecake is worth it - all different types - the typical strawberry and fruit cheesecake andt here's oreo crusted cheesecake and toffee and coffee and EVERYTHING imaginable.
Nelson S.,"Chicago, IL",14,208,11,5.0,12/27/2006,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factories and normally, I would probably give it 4 stars but my recent visit here at the Hancock was just so great that it really did deserves all 5 stars.  I came here with 6 other friends from out of town and we were all well taken cared of.  I took them here because everyone will find something that they will like, the prices are reasonable, and the food is pretty tasty.  Do get scared away by the long wait times, they told us an hour and we were sat in about 20 minutes. Everything was pretty much the same regardless of what CF you go to but this night, we had the lovely Diane serve us and she was funny, outgoing, and just had fun with us and she rocked!  That to me made all the difference.  The food was good, the drinks were awesome (try the Mint Julep or Mojito), and of course, the cheesecake, yummy. CF has good consistency in their food quality across their locations and I am sure to be back sometime but this last time was truly an outstanding experience.  Thanks Diane!"
Michelle H.,"Los Gatos, CA",54,149,,2.0,1/27/2010,"Oh this place. First of all, there food has enough salt in it to last me 3 years. The dishes are massive and hide what could be a good flavor with a shit-ton of salt. One way to tell when things are fresh is to see how overly salty they are. The food, aside from the salt just isn't that good. I don't understand why people wait forever, end up paying close to $30 a person, when nothing about the cheesecake factory is even worth it. Yes, they do have good Cheesecake, but better can be found elsewhere. Seriously disappointing."
Ren H.,"Chicago, IL",87,1219,1930,5.0,8/25/2005,i will always love the salads here!  i have never looked at any other portion of the menu because i can't resist the salads everytime!  On the rare occasions i manage to save room for dessert the cheesecake is awesome!
A L.,"San Francisco, CA",8,226,,4.0,9/9/2007,"Let's be honest, all the CF's are exactly the same.   Decent food.  Lots of it.  Decent price.   Our server was awesome."
Albert C.,"Campbell, CA",85,473,21,3.0,12/26/2007,"Pretty standard fare with a wide variety of lunch and dinner choices and really good dessert. Favorite entrees include the Chinese chicken salad, the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and Joe's special omelette. Most of their entrees are large enough to share (or for two meals), which appeals to my cash-strapped sensibilities. Among the cheesecakes, I like the fresh strawberry and the chocolate Oreo mudslide. Being located in the lower level of the Hancock on Michigan Avenue is a nice touch. I can't vouch for the parking, since I've only ever taken the Red line to Chicago and just walked. Lots of fond memories of eatin with friends boosts this place to 3.5 stars."
Kristina K.,"Chicago, IL",7,67,1,4.0,9/26/2006,"Yes, there's always a wait. All the better to peruse the massive menu. Yes, there's a huge menu. But not so many vegetarian options. But the cheesecake! Oh! The Cheesecake! If I believed in Heaven, it would have endless supplies of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake!"
Erin C.,"New York, NY",42,203,6,3.0,11/2/2007,"The proliferation of Cheesecake Factory locations is making the country fat.  I mean, the portion sizes are out of control!  And the weight management salads are those UNDER 590 calories?  Really? That's not to say that the food isn't good, but it's just on the not so healthy side (which makes sense given the name of the restaurant).  Portions are more than generous; I ordered the lunch size pizza and side salad which was more like a personal size pizza and a full size salad.  I took half the pizza home and didn't finish the salad.  The good thing was that I was too full for dessert. The cheesecake IS delicious though, and I recommend trying it (splitting with someone else is probably the best option).  I love the pumpkin, tiramisu, and godiva cheesecakes.  And the chocolate raspberry truffle is heavenly. Be prepared to wait awhile at this place unless you come at a really off time.  And be prepared for a lot of tourists/suburbanites to be eating here as well (i.e., lots of children)."
Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,,2.0,9/26/2011,"Worst service I have ever seen at a restaurant!   Over the course of the meal, we had at least 3 different waiters because our waiter was currently ""on break"".  After being ready to order for at least 15 minutes, had to flag down a waiter that could take our order.  We were then told we would get the bread, but 20 minutes later another waiter comes out and tells us the bread is baking so it shouldn't be much longer.  About the same time the bread came out, 3 of our 4 meals are delivered.  After waiting a good 5 or 10 minutes for the last meal, a waiter finally comes out and tells us the last meal wasn't put in so it will be a little longer.  Finally all get our meals and finish.  We had already decided on cheesecake to order and again have to flag down a waiter to go get ours.  In total, it took us over 2 hours from being seated to getting our bill.  So upset with the service that we wanted to speak to a manager, but yet again our waiter disappeared.  By far the worst service I have ever seen.   The meal was good, but the waiter ruined this experience for us."
sean g.,"Villa Park, IL",1,7,,1.0,7/10/2009,"This restaurant is NOT one that I would recommend.  We were hoping to go in for lunch and be back across the street in just over an hour and a half.  We ordered 2 kids pastas and 2 burgers.  An hour and a half later, we still had not received our food.  We did let them know we needed to leave in half an hour and were from out of town.  The pasta did come out, however we never did get the burgers.  The excuse that we were given is that they were trying to cook the burgers to perfection.  We ordered them medium.  Never before have burgers taken even 45 minutes let alone an hour an a half to 2 hours!  Comps were not offered either, only an apology for us missing a meal.  The food might be pretty good (although we never did get to eat our meal) but the customer service is really horrid!"
Lindsay N.,"Chicago, IL",4,80,,3.0,7/21/2007,"Lots of variety, but basically a typical family restaurant in a nicer-than-average wrapping. The serving are very large for the most part and most come with sides.  The basics like French Fries and onion rings are very good,  some of the more interesting menu choices can be bland namely the breakfast choices. They serve some pretty nice espresso drinks but the prices are high and the quality doesn't really justify it.  The cheesecake is yummy, but picking a flavor is hard.  I can never finish a piece by myself, so unless you're a dessert fiend splitting a piece with a friend may be a good idea."
Dipali K.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,3,4.0,9/5/2010,"I'm a fan of Cheesecake factory..  Always willing to stop by for a bite or two. Love this place especially for it's chains maintains the STD.  Have been at Chicago downtown chain, love the Chicago Downtown feel. Fashion valley San Diego is a charm as well.."
Blair S.,"Wheaton, IL",1,71,,2.0,7/28/2011,"OK, so we went tonite , a Thursday and it was packed. Waited just 20 minutes for what was a very forgettable meal. Sat ten minutes before we even saw a waiter, asked for drinks and water, forgot water. My wife and daughter went to wash up, bathroom flooded, filthy, and generally vile. Back to dinner, wife Oerter Cajun chicken, no Cajun seasonings at all. I ordered a vegetable side, forgot that too. Overall, a wildly forgettable meal. The place has a menu that is too large to be good at any of it. It's so large that it resembles a fire drill, and you know the food will be chain like, and forgettable. I'm done with this chain. For the price, I will make other choices."
