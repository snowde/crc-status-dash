grace s.,"Chicago, IL",0,18,,1.0,8/18/2010,"I always thought there was nothing bad to eat at the cheesecake factory and the service was always good but now this is the second time trying after a bad meal and Im done with Cheesecake Factory!  Me and my 2 guests all 3 got pasta and OMG, holy salt!! My one friend had ordered the shrimp scampi many times before (her fav dish) but now there was an unreal amount of salt in the dishes. We were gagging  on it. WHen we told the waiter, he said ""yea, we use alot of salt here. You can order something else"" What?!?!  He should of had them remade it!!, but acted as if we were all a headache for complaining over our $20 meal having a pound of salt in them. Just awful!! not going back ever!!"
Heather L.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",42,166,198,3.0,8/29/2009,Went to the Cheesecake Factory on a friends recommendation (and it was right across the street from our hotel and American Girl).  I knew as soon as I opened the 15 page menu that we were probably not going to get a magnificent meal...too many choices. We started with an appetizer of stuffed olives...which really should have been called deep fried sausage balls with a portion of olive somewhere in the middle...ick.   I asked our server for some recommendations for dinner my youngest daughter decided on the adult entree fish tacos so I split them with her...had the tortillas been cooked properly (they were soggy chewy) this would actually have been a really good meal (you had your choice of ahi tuna and mahi mahi and we went with the mahi mahi).  My husband got the meatloaf dinner and ate half (which means it wasn't good...usually he'll eat his meal and help one of us finish ours).  I didn't taste it so I can't comment on it.  My older daughter got the soup (mushroom....she is a soup lover and would usually like mushroom but she didn't really care for this one) and onion rings (which we sent back because the batter was not cooked all the way through).  Also somewhere in the middle of our meal we all of sudden had another server....no explanation why???    The cheesecake was the one hit of the meal and we did polish it off and discuss ordering another to take back to the hotel for later.  Bottom line....go somewhere else for dinner and definitely stop here for dessert!
Elisa H.,"Chicago, IL",11,20,,5.0,11/21/2007,"I love the way this place is decorated.  it's like walking into a creamy, beautiful recreation of willie wonka's...or some swirly dream-like land of sugar and honey.  they just put in a bit more effort than usual for the atmosphere.  actually, it reminded me of vegas a bit.  only more classy:o) Okay, and, you know, the food is yummy and the prices are comfortable even for those of us who don't like spending a lot of money:o)  The restaurant is very large and it was a busy Friday night, but we didn't have to wait (too) long to be seated or for our food.  All in all, it was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I very much enjoyed it:o)  Quite the experience..."
Alexander E.,"Chicago, IL",0,56,,4.0,8/7/2012,"I never was a big fan of cheesecake until I came and ate at the Cheesecake Factory. It is too good. The food here is also very tasty. It always seem to be very crowded, but  that did not really bother me much. The staff is always very friendly and service is pretty fast. I suggest coming here during the week if you do not want to experience a big crowd. Now I'm a huge Cheesecake fan!"
Angelica D.,"Chicago, IL",5,95,2,4.0,4/13/2009,Cheesecake was so so yummy! Had the orange chicken and that delicious as well. Always came here for cheesecake but never really stopped by for the food. Boyfriend and I finally decided to stop by there friday nite after work. They told us the wait was going 2b 30 minutes but we didn't really mind. A host then came like 10 mins later and asked us that she would seat us upstairs  and we wouldn't have to wait for a table which we agreed to. The service here is pretty awesome.  Our server was very nice and on top of everything. The upstairs was kind of different than the lower level. It was less crowded and a bit more calm so that was a definite plus. The prices were reasonable and the portions are huge. Definitely recommend this place.
Tim J.,"Manteno, IL",16,210,72,1.0,1/8/2012,"We just got back from my wife's birthday dinner at the cheesecake factory in Chicago. We waited only moments to be seated on our reservation, but I watched 21 minutes tick by watching as tables all around us got seated with bread and water. When the table immediately to our right got their order taken and a moment later the table just beyond got their starter(both seated after us), I grabbed a waiter and asked to see a manager. We got an apology from a second manager and finally a waiter. After, starters arrived quickly. First the fried egg rolls with Guac, clearly fried in a hurry to get to us fast. Therefore very greasy and undercooked. After, the Thai lettuce wrap, which was the highlight of the evening. Although I imagine it is hard to screw up a raw appetizer plate. She had the orange chicken, a dish she had the previous day at the Cheesecake factory in Niles and said this portion was half of what it was in Niles. I had fettucini alfredo with chicken, which was incredibly dissapointing. It had about three oz chicken, the noodles were wide egg noodles and way way overcooked. They were just floppy. I ate about three oz of it and couldn't stand any more of it. Our seven year old had the chicken strips and refused to eat them, they were so over cooked. I tried them and she was right. They were as dry as cardboard....clearly pre-cooked. She ate none of them and only french fries. My wife stated the orange chicken was ok, but, ""not as good as Panda"". The cheesecake deserts were pretty good. My coffee was horrible and about on the level of dunkin donuts. Our bill came to $80.00 and we left a %12 tip. This was the worst money I have ever spent and I was highly disgusted with the food. I would not return to a cheesecake factory if cooporate contacted me and offered me a free equal meal. I plan to tell as many people I know what a terrible experience this was. Seriously, the orange chicken was not as good as panda?!? NEVER AGAIN"
Robert M.,"Cincinnati, OH",60,477,7,4.0,10/4/2009,Come for the cheesecake and tripy mushrom decor
Emily B.,"Chicago, IL",5,15,,5.0,10/10/2009,"I went here for my two year anniversary with my boyfriend, which happens to be the day before Christmas, so it was really busy. We had to wait for probably a half hour but we didn't have a reservation so in retrospect that was actually pretty amazing. We had this awesome waitress who was just so nice to us (we were like, 16 at the time so having someone treat us just as nice as adults is EXTREMELY rare) and the service was so quick for being so busy. They give you SO MUCH FOOD. They are pretty expensive but you can definitely take it home and eat just as much the next day. It's like two meals. My boyfriend got the personal pizza, which was essentially a medium sized full round pizza you would get at a pizza place. They give you a lot of food. The cheesecake is very good also. We tipped the waitress like, $30 because she was so great (a lot of money for anyone, much less totally broke 15 year olds.) Go there if you have the cash."
Janet N.,"Chicago, IL",4,17,,4.0,10/14/2006,"Come for the cheesecake, stay for the food. Really. If you love cheesecake that's probably the reason you're going to go. But you simply can't ignore the food. Set aside a few bucks and skip lunch, because you're gonna want to eat a LOT. Even the meatloaf is spectacular. If you can, end your day there so you can get a doggie bag and your cheesecake to go, because they really do give you that much food. Just be careful not to go for too many additonal sugary elements to the cheesecake--some of them will practically rot your teeth off instantaneously they're so sweet! Here's what I don't like about this location--it's always so terribly packed and when it's not the best weather you can't just wait outside for your buzzer to go off. Not to mention once it does you have to go inside and wait again. Plus, if you have a stroller or wheelchair you have to go around to another entrance and may well get lost trying to get to the place. Having to search for the elevator in the main building and walk through the hallways to the back door made me feel a little second-class, just because my friends had a stroller with them.  But there is a reason it's so packed, and there's a reason that I will take my friends there. If it were only about the cheesecake, the line would be longer for the bakery counter than the seating. But it's not just about the cheesecake."
J. E. N.,"Chicago, IL",1,38,,4.0,4/24/2009,"love this place~ bit pricey and the wait for a table will blow your mind~ go if you're in a grouping 4 or less~ also, don't order beer here~ way over priced the dishes are great tho~ so i end up returning even tho I know i have to wait ~"
KM I.,"Chicago, IL",33,226,2,3.0,12/2/2009,"decent if you are with a party with totally different palates. Love this location, very whimsical and comfy inside. Food is always great, nothing super fancy, just good. Service is always piss poor...dunno what is is, they are all that way. I am always dressed nice with my Louis Vuitton and everything and I still get treated like a 15 year old looking to ditch her bill, so thats always a drawback of going here. OH and I must mention the year I told them it was my boyfriends birthday and he said they would take care of it. Totally not looking for a free sundae, just something cute to acknowledge it for him. No, dumbass waitress came and asked if we wanted dessert and then brought the bill with nothing.....complained to manager and all he could produce was a dumbfounded look and an ""oh uh Im sorry...."", no I am sorry because we have since found better and now spend all of our money across the street at Frankie's Scallopine."
Harley W.,"Woodland Hills, CA",60,12,4,1.0,11/18/2010,"I was in Chicago as part of a road trip with my brother and two sisters. Which means we were having a great time having all the time in the world to be together, but we were also on a schedule to see all the things we wanted before us sisters had to go back on the road and my brother had to catch a plane back home, back to work. We had plans to see a show together on our last night in town and made the mistake of stopping at the Cheesecake to eat before the show. First, we were informed that my brother's order was somehow stolen from the kitchen. That's the first time it ever happened to us in all the years of eating out, but we were kinda amused, and decided we can still make it to the show, so we waited some more.  My brother got his order and said it wasn't amazing, but it tasted ok, but me and my sisters had to send our Pasta Da Vinci back to the kitchen twice for being undercooked. It was really doughy. We felt bad for doing that. We're usually not the kind of people who complain. It makes us feel uncomfortable. But even the poor waitress (who we felt bad for, I know what it's like to work in the service industry and apologize to clients about problems you yourself did not create. We were happy to leave a tip for her when we left) had to relay an apology from the cooks who agreed  the dish was below standards. We decided to get a plate of fries so we can leave and go to our show already. We ended up paying way too much for my brother's dish, the fries and our drinks, and left the place hungry, after a long  long wait, with no time to make it to the show. Complete disappointment. More than anything, I was angry that I entrusted this place with my last evening it town with my family, and that I kept waiting, hoping they will get their act together. We ended up not doing anything that evening, and feeling bad and cheated. Never again."
Carmen C.,"Chicago, IL",5,32,,4.0,11/12/2011,we have to wait 45 minutes to get a table. this is our second time. we order a salad . a fried mac and cheese and a kobe burger. the food is good. but not so amazing as other good restaurants. service is fast and friendly. this is a good place to go if u dont have to wait for more than30minutes
Jenny L.,"Madison, WI",0,160,,1.0,8/21/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory?  Really?  C'mon.  The service is crappy.  The food is blah.  It's freakin expensive!   The wait is unreal.   Went for a party, but wouldn't choose to go on my own.  $14 for a salad?"
Moni K.,"Evanston, IL",195,508,118,2.0,10/2/2008,"I am going to be very honest about my recent experience here: I had a glass of wine CHIANTI - RUFFINO, Italy ,TEX MEX EGGROLLS, and THE INCREDIBLE GRILLED EGGPLANT SANDWICH I waited 30 minutes for my wine, and I know that the wine that I got was not a chianti from Italy (My husband also ordered a beer and he waited for it patiently for 30 minutes too) Tex mex eggrolls were very good THE INCREDIBLE GRILLED EGGPLANT SANDWICH was ok...But the sad thing is that  I asked for ketchup  for my fries and I NEVER got it. So here is the service story: When we finally got our drinks 30 minutes later, we ordered our meal, my husband ordered a clam chowder soup. Our waiter said I will bring it right out...he never did took another 30 minutes and brought everything all at once. For his excuse he said the soup is made from scratch... my ass from scratch...you were not making it from scratch right now...it was prepared in the morning and all you have to do is heat it up, but you forgot. The sad part is that our waiter was not busy he had 4 open tables. Not only that he kept on patting my back whenever he came by, took requests and never came back with them. Pretty much he tried to bullshit his way of being of any help.  The patting on the back was just plain inappropriate and insulting. He was so obnoxious when he came by that another couple next to us started staring at him whenever he approached our table. The waiter also ignored my father in law's calls after him to remind him of the forgotten stuff. NOW, when the bill came, the waiter came by kneeled by our table and said that he knows his service was bad but the restaurant is understaffed. I am sorry but how can you be understaffed when you have 4 tables open, next to us. You see my dear father in law is a good soul (he also did not visit the bathroom)  tiped this man as usual but oh dear this was an experience Let me mentioned the BATHROOMS Filthy and dirty While I used the toilet I had to stand  in pee that was on the floor. Now tell me how a company like the Cheesecake Factory if they know they are so busy  and always understaffed why not take care of the bathrooms. I guess having cleaning crew clean the bathrooms would take away from their profits. So please do not tell me you make clam chowder from scratch, while your bathroom floor is soaked with urine. I was not born yesterday!!!!!!!!"
Katie A.,"Batavia, IL",43,265,,2.0,5/5/2008,"If you're of the mind that huge portions = awesome restaurant (that's it and that's all) then this is your place. And for your second dinner, check out Maggiano's.  Hope your gastric bypass goes to plan. This way the next time you go to a restaurant, you won't have to demand tables over booths anymore. What a blessing! I hate this country about 95% of the time."
Bart E.,"El Cajon, CA",61,21,73,4.0,6/21/2009,AWESOME service.  We had a group of  7 and it only took 15min to get seated.  Our server was very nice and helpful.  It was what you come to expect from the factory.   all the food was great... one person in the group got a burger and fries  and fries were a little old so the server brought out some new fries ASAP.
Tara M.,"Chicago, IL",124,243,2,3.0,10/20/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is: an overpriced chain restaurant with the most ridiculous menu I've ever seen. But everything on it is pretty solid and the service has always been acceptable. For the purposes of my review, I want to note two recent experiences here, both of which started with crappy service that was ultimately remedied. 1.) My mom and I went to CF for lunch one day a couple of months back. Within 2.5 seconds of her greeting us, I noticed that our waitress' nails were filthy. I mean FILTHY. I couldn't take my eyes off of them and lost my appetite on the spot. I didn't say anything to my mom about it so as not to ruin her meal, but a few minutes later she made a comment to me about it. So we ordered our respective entrees and the fried mac & cheese appetizer, the whole time praying that our waitress didn't touch any of our food. Our appetizer came out cold and apparently that was the last straw for Mom. She asked for the manager and complained mostly about our waitress' nails, and just a little about the cold appetizer. The manager offered to comp our appetizer and apologized profusely for the waitress--I really hope that the poor girl didn't lose her job. But hopefully CF checks their staff now before sending them out on the floor! 2.) My parents came down to the city last week and, as usual, wanted to hit up CF. Everything was going fine--our waiter (Scott) was friendly and attentive. We ordered promptly (Dad had the crispy beef, Mom ordered some sort of pasta and I ordered fish tacos). My dad's and my food came out just fine, and my poor mom sat there and waited and waited...finally the manager came out and explained that her pasta had gone to another table but that she would have it shortly. So about 20 minutes after my dad and I got our food, my mom got hers. Not really a big deal and we all dug in. My fish tacos suuuucked, by the way. Anyway, our waiter came back later to apologize again and my dad joked that my mom should get a free dessert for having to wait. Totally kidding. But a few moments later my mom was told she could choose any dessert she'd like. Thanks, guys! Overall, CF has good food (I will never stray from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta again) and I am sure that due to the sheer size of the restaurant and the menu that mishaps are bound to happen. It's good to know that they are taken care of properly when they do."
Jessica G.,"Villa Park, IL",71,423,6,3.0,11/17/2010,"So we came here for lunch with a group of work folks today.  It's pretty busy at lunch but they seated 7 of us, though somewhat awkwardly, in a round booth, almost right away.  Our server was very friendly and took our drink orders in a timely fashion, as well as our food orders.  The food took quite a while to come out and then half the items were brought and then 5 minutes later, the rest of the items came out.  We had one person on a bit of a time crunch and he had to have his food packed to go so he could make his meeting.  The food is ok overall.  Portions are enormous, even for lunch.  I had the ""Renee Special"" which is half of a turkey sandwich with salad (ask for it without the dressing if you don't want it drowned in dressing) and, which I did not realize when I was reading the menu, a cup of their soup of the day.  It was really a lot of food.  Not horrible and a decent price for the amount of food.  For a chain, it's ok but not somewhere I'd seek out on a regular basis anymore."
Kyla C.,"East Lansing, MI",5,29,,4.0,6/24/2011,"I was completely satisfied with the way this outing went. My 3 friends and I arrived at Cheesecake and thought we were going to have to wait for an hour. While sipping on their delicious Red Sangria we lucked out and got a table within 10 minutes. The calamari is cooked to perfection, but if you want to try something new order the avocado egg rolls. Crispy, fried on the outside and warm avocado filling on the inside. Perfect way to start off our meal. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Madeira, which is their most popular chicken dish, and definitely exceeded my expectations. Unfortunately I could not finish the whole meal, but if you love mushrooms, asparagus, cheese and chicken in an extremely yummy sauce, you should get that dish. The waiter was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had about the meal. The menu is pretty big so be prepared to take awhile to decide. The next day we went back to try their cheesecake and honestly you can't go wrong with anything you order."
