Gina W.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,7/21/2010,"My family and I came in on a Sunday afternoon. It was a bit crowded but it didn't take long for us to be seated. When we got to the table we noticed the silverware was DISGUSTING. There was traces of food on each and every single one of the utensils. Fortunately we were sitting near a window so we were able to see the appalling state of the silverware. Most of the restaurant was dim so I doubt others would have been able to notice the leftover food on their forks and knives before sticking them in their food and mouths. After having our utensils replaced TWICE we got our beverages, which also left something to be desired. After taking a few sips of my water, I found a long black strand of hair in my water.  Don't get me wrong; I am not a fussy, demanding customer but this was just too much. I asked another waitress to replace my drink and she got the manager. The manager apologized a dozen times before leaving us alone and then kept coming back to our table to check back on us, which became rather annoying. The food was alright, nothing particularly amazing . We asked our waiter for the check and offered us a slice of cheesecake on the house for all our troubles. I don't understand why the entrée portions were so big and yet we got this tiny morsel of cheesecake. We decided to get the brownie sundae cheesecake and we took it home. For a restaurant that calls itself ""The Cheesecake Factory"" I was expecting the best cheesecake I've had in my life. It was extremely decadent, in an inedible-without-a-glass-of-milk kind of way. In conclusion, if you plan to visit the Cheesecake Factory: CHECK YOUR SILVERWARE, check your beverages, and do not order the brownie sundae cheesecake."
Sheila W.,"Norwalk, CA",27,25,,1.0,9/3/2008,"I like The Cheesecake Factory generally, but I have to downgrade this place due to a certain waiter.  No bread until I finally asked after my meal came.  No straw.  (Everyone else had them.)  He wanted to kick me out after sitting for 15mins for lunch when there were plenty of empty tables.  I can't decide if it was ageist, sexism, racism, or just plain rudeness.  I understand that the people dining there were touristy and the staff were probably elitist, but I was dressed semi-formally and didn't order the cheapest item on the menu, so I don't know what gives. Even though I'll be staying within a block of this place for the next few weeks, I would only come back if I have a cheesecake craving, and even then, I would order take-out.  I'm writing this review to vent partly, but seriously, I enjoy dining out and spend good money on it, so places should not be allowed to treat people this way for no good reason.  I hope others will find this helpful and either call these waiters out or demand their bread and straws!"
Dillon C.,"Chicago, IL",3,2,,2.0,1/8/2010,"Writing a review for this place is kind of like writing a review for a $6 hotdog at a ballpark: If you like the overall experience, you'll probably like the food and it'll be worth it.  If you're just after a good dog though, you might be better served looking elsewhere.  The Cheesecake Factory is right on Michigan Ave; big-time downtown Chicago location.  And not only is it there, it belongs there.  Anyways, it took a year of convincing for me to believe this place served more than cheesecake.  It also took more than a year to go through the diner menu once I got there: it's huge. First, we got a couple of drinks that were 10 bucks apiece.  It was fun to be indulgent but what came out really wasn't that great (or strong).  Next, we ordered the lettuce wraps (bib lettuce, grilled chicken, carrots, noodles, cucumbers, bean sprouts, ECT) from the app menu.  They were my favorite part of the meal (really, just one of the three 1oz dipping sauces was my favorite part of the meal).  For my entrée, I got a combination of shrimp scampi and ""Steak Diane,"" which was peppercorn encrusted steak w/ mushrooms.  My GF got a pizza.  Both entrees were unimpressive and left me thinking about what I'd do to change them.  Regrettably, I don't really like cheesecake too much.  I tried (and shyly liked) both of our cheesecake deserts.  I hear from LOTS of people the have ""the best"" but I'm not one to say either way.   I'm not an ""anti-chain"" person but, somehow, this place falls into the negative mold.  There's just something about the taste of the food... kind of a salty, unsatisfying background that's always there.  Still, the food certainly isn't as bad as a Bennigan's or something like that so it didn't send me away screaming.  The service was fine.  What was painful were the prices.  Way, way too much for the value of food.  And that's the bottom line. I really like going down to Michigan Ave. in the heart of downtown Chicago.  I love the bustle and perpetual motion of it all.  The Cheesecake Factory is a fun, indulgent spot that belongs right there in the mix.  If you have guests coming in from out of town who want to experience Chicago by shopping downtown, peering out of tall skyscrapers, and eating somewhere fun afterwards, I think that they would really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  But the fact is that, somewhere else, you could be getting better food for  1/2 the price and incredible food for the same price."
Robert Jr E.,"Signal Hill, CA",216,216,,4.0,1/4/2009,"The bottom floor of the John Hancock building... Its your typical delicious cheesecake factory as are the one's in the United States.  What made this experience memorable was good weather (lol), but most importantly eating there with friends and family... as an added bonus, I recommend you guys take the elevator to the top floor of the Hancock building... really is a remarkable sight! Also, dont forget the Sears tower!"
Caroline A.,"Fairfax, VA",1136,1178,22,5.0,2/1/2007,"OK. I am not a fan of chain restaurants at all.  However, I love the cheesecake factory.  My mom and I do lunch here once a month and have a few favorites on the menu. We love love love the brown bread.  I've tried to re-create it at home many times, with no success.  The sweet molasses and chewy texture is pure love.  Favorites on the menu include: Thai chicken wrap appetizers, herb crusted salmon salad, chinese chicken salad and garlic mashed potatoes.  The sandwiches are enormous, and the entrees could feed a small family.  The chocolate cake is almost the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  My ex and I used to come JUST for the chocolate cake.  The only thing I don't like is the wait.  I can't believe they don't take reservations."
Dallas F.,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",381,409,279,3.0,7/27/2007,"If I wanted to quickly gain 30lbs I would eat here for a week. The portions are so big its quite ridiculous. I felt like I should have boxed my leftover  food for a homeless person but my last experience with giving a homeless person food didn't go so well. So I had ""Renee's special"" which consists of half a sandwich, a cup of soup, and a salad. The food was ok. You can't really mess these things up. In fact the Clam Chowder was very good as was the raspberry lemonade. The cheesecake I ate off of other's plates for dessert- ick. What the heck? Change your name to the Clam Chowder Factory, you do that well."
Pukar R.,"Houston, TX",65,256,5,4.0,1/4/2009,"As goes with any chain restaurant, the food and service is comparable but what makes this place stand out is the location. If you dine on the patio (hopefully over the summer lol) the ambiance and feeling of being in the center of everything that is beautiful about this wonderful city makes the food and drinks that much better!"
K M.,"Chicago, IL",176,270,1,3.0,10/26/2006,"Just came back from lunch there with my little sister, and am giving it 3 stars because I think its more good than bad, so I'll play nice, but keep in mind I was torn between 2-3 Pros:   1) Cheesecake is awesome. I don't generally love cheesecake and it would never be my first pick for a dessert.  But the things they do to it here make it so good! Split the dutch apple with my sister and sort of wished I had just ordered a piece as my lunch.  I would say don't bother with the food here and just come for dessert!  2) The food is also good enough and reasonably priced for how much you get.  I ordered the lunch size of the thai something or other pasta (which was good but really reminded me of the taste of a lean cuisine I like, which made me think I would have been better off having the lean cuisine for lunch!).  It was still ENORMOUS after downsizing- I can't imagine what kind of monstrosity they bring you for a dinner portion! I ate maybe 1/2 at most.   3) Huge menu should mean that there is something for everyone, so its a good place to take picky eaters you can't take somewhere better 4) The outdoor seating.  Its nice in the summer as a break from shopping.  Granted the line is huge then, but you can sit out on the steps and wait and its not a huge deal.  Cons:  1) Seriously- downsize the portions a bit more! There is a reason this country is morbidly overweight and this has to be part of it!  2) the decor.  There's something ALMOST cool about it, but it also reminds me of intestines and is overall way over the top and tacky.  I don't want to be thinking about the digestive system as I eat.  Its just too much.  Also the floors are very very slippery.  My heels almost couldn't take it, I nearly wiped out (and it wasn't because of the rain) 3) The huge menu.  While in some ways a pro, I find it to be a con as well.  To me it means they just can't figure out what they do well so I'm not sure what to get- do I get something Asian? Italian? A sandwich? It seems like they do all of these things well, but not great.  But I guess there's nothing really wrong with ""good.""  This place is bad for the indecisive, as well as the arteries. Go for lunch rather than dinner I think- we got there before noon so didn't have to wait a long time. I wouldn't wait an hour for this- I agree with those who say its probably best to save this place for a take out dessert!"
Mike K.,"Chicago, IL",178,354,3,4.0,10/26/2008,"It's always too crowded. I hate waiting forever to eat. The general idea of cheese and cake together scares me. The prices can be a bit too much. With all of that said, I really like this place. The menu is huge so you're bound to find something you like. Plus the portions are big so you'll leave full or have something to eat for lunch tomorrow. Its a great place for a group of friends or for enteraining out of towners."
S L.,"Chicago, IL",73,146,6,2.0,3/12/2008,"Eh, it was ok.  I agree with everyone when they say that it's a little touristy.  Although, I am finally understanding why they call it a factory.  It's because they push people into small crammed spaces and try to get you in and out of the circulation as quickly and as expensively as possible.  I went and it was super crowded, but the part that I really despised was when the waiter offered me gluten free solutions for food and he assured me that he knew the food was gluten free and then gave me some story about his ex having Celiac, but the food was in no way gluten-free.  One more thing, they sat me in a table where a light from the ceiling was shining directly on me and into my eyes.  I had to move.  The redeeming quality was the quality of food.  I will give them that."
Suzanne O.,"Chicago, IL",94,16,1,2.0,2/9/2006,"This place is a dieters and penny pinchers enemy. If portion size is their excuse for expensive entrees, why don't they just cut both the size and cost in half? The menu is extensive and everything is good but it lacks orginality and charm. The chicken tacos have Mexican authenticity and of course the cheesecake is out of this world. Avoid the place over busy tourist times, like summer, the holidays, weekends, etc."
Reid C.,"Chicago, IL",4,43,4,3.0,8/11/2007,"Sitting in the restaurant, waiting for my wife (who was waiting for the bathroom), I couldn't help but notice the people next to me: standard couple, likely in from the burbs or Kansas.  They ordered two means and had barely touched their plates.  Why?  Not good?  Probably not.  Probably just too much food.  So here's the trick: when stopping here with your SO, just order one appetizer (avocado egg rolls), one salad (chopped) and a main.  Split everything.  There is no way you'll go hungry.  And, if you can believe it, we left without even having a piece of their eponymous dessert.  Total: under $40.  Not bad for a pre Spelling Bee din din."
Shannon S.,"Chicago, IL",27,150,,4.0,4/9/2006,"If you are looking for a big menu with A LOT of variety, please check out the Cheesecake factory. This hot spot is located at the Hancock building, what a great eatery while doing some shopping on Michigan Ave. The menu is actually somewhat overwhelming as you can find yourself deciding between salads, pastas, sandwiches, burgers, main entrees, appetizers.....and please don't forget the cheesecake!! The portions are huge. Even the half portion salad I got filled me up before I was halfway done."
Eating Sleeping T.,"San Francisco, CA",30,192,15,2.0,8/9/2007,"I was dining solo at the bar on a Tuesday afternoon, and I ordered the lunch size portion of the Chinese chicken salad.  In the time it took me to go to the men's room (out the doors near the coffee bar, to the right and then to the left) to wash my hands, the kitchen was able to prep my salad and have it waiting for me when I got back.  One would think ""amazing service,"" right?  Unfortunately, the lettuce in the salad was completely soggy.  The dish should have been called ""Cold Lettuce Soup with Chicken and Mandarin Oranges.""  Isn't the whole point of going to chain restaurants the consistency?"
Alicia F.,"Chicago, IL",26,80,8,2.0,4/22/2006,"The big problem I have with Cheesecake Factory is that for a touristy, family type restaurant they have NO KIDS MENU. I am forced to order an adult-sized grilled cheese for my toddler which would probably feed her for two weeks. But we keep going back because all the people who visit us want to come here, and all my friends from the suburbs love it.  And the cheesecake is still really tasty. If I could just rate the cheesecake separately that would get 5 stars."
Megan S.,"Joliet, IL",18,27,,5.0,7/26/2006,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've eaten here about a dozen times, and they never cease to impress me with a wonderful meal. I religiously ordered the Shrimp Scampi with the Mac and Cheese Balls as an appetizer. I just recently tried the fish tacos, which satisfied me as well. Always remember to order a lemonade for your drink because they cover the rim of the cup in pure sugar. A refreshing treat. The staff is very cordial, the food comes out quickly, but make sure to be ready to order as soon as your waiter or waitress comes to your table for the first time. They might never come back."
Amy J.,"Chicago, IL",30,296,,4.0,4/11/2008,"The best part about this Cheesecake Factory is the location. It's right outside the Hancock building and kind of underground. It's really really cool. I've only been there in a party of two, so I've never had to deal with waiting too long. But, as everyone's already said, the menu is huge. You can get just about anything you want at Cheesecake Factory. Literally I think their menu is like 20 pages. I've had a bunch of different things there, but the one that really stands out is the Orange Chicken. It's really good. Also have had their pizza, and it's pretty good too (and way too much food for one person). And of course, the cheesecake... So good. They have like 50 flavors. It's almost insane. But, really, what stands out the most for me is the location. It's in a great spot."
Mary A.,"Chicago, IL",31,18,,3.0,4/16/2011,"their decent, food is ok, service was good!"
Chella G.,"Chicago, IL",58,140,9,3.0,5/29/2007,"Go here when you're thinking to yourself, ""Wow, I feel like being surrounded by annoying tourists today."" The Cheesecake Factory at Old Orchard is nice and airy.  However, I can't really stand this particular location because it seems like everyone there is a misguided tourist who thinks that this is high-class dining.   If you're visiting Chicago, try one of the non-chain restaurants and enjoy quality food.   Seriously, what is with the portion sizes at this place? The food is ok and I do like that many dishes come in a ""half order"" size.  Although, it's still more food than most people need in two meals.   The last time I ate here, my salad came drenched in dressing to the point that it didn't even taste good."
Martin N.,"Melbourne, Australia",6,41,3,4.0,2/21/2010,"I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory anyway, but this was another good experience.  Shows you that they ""travel"" well. Food was excellent, service was gr8 and we didn't have to que for that long which was a bonus."
