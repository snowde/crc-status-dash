Steve T.,"Chicago, IL",151,279,1,4.0,12/26/2007,"Very good.  I'm kinda addicted to their menu, and their Parmesan crusted chicken and pasta.  There is never room for cheesecake, so plan on ordering it to go.  The spinach artichoke dip appetizer is delicious.  What can I say, this might be a chain, but it's addictive and the quality is the same across locations.  The line here is especially long since it's on Mich Ave, so plan ahead.  Try sitting at the bar..."
Liz T.,"Chicago, IL",35,93,,1.0,1/22/2007,"I must say that I have disliked this restaurant for merely the concept alone.  Big serving sizes are equivocal to ugly America in my book.  And, I've always said that what this restaurant lacks in quality they make up for in quantity.  That said, I realize that I don't always get to pick the restaurant and that sometimes I need to just sit back and relax...here is an account of one such night. Reading the menu is like reading the encyclopedia, and once I'd made my way through the literature, I decided on some kind of tostada salad thing.  At first bite, I was impressed that the flavor didn't absolutely repulse me.  As a matter of fact, I was beginning to feel a little embarrassed by the amount of trash-talking I do.  And then it all changed.  About 10 bites in, I bit into something foreign, something inedible.  CARDBOARD.  I bit into cardboard.  Now, I realize there are many terrifying things that one could find in food, and when you consider the options, I lucked out, but still.  We flag the waiter over and he confirms that there is, indeed, cardboard in my salad.  He takes it away and tells us that he's sending the manager over.  15 minutes later the manager shows up with my plate in hand.  Her response, ""Yeah, there's cardboard in here.  It's from the boxes we keep the lettuce in.""  And, then, when she realized I wasn't buying what she was selling she said, ""...but it shouldn't be in your salad.""  They comped the salad, I was too freaked out to eat anything else,and left starving.  Will I give The Cheesecake Factory another try?  Probably not."
Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",124,506,,4.0,9/21/2008,"Love this place! Always gauranteed a good meal. The decor of the restaurant is a bit crazy. It has a very ""alice and wonderland"" high on mushrooms type of vibe. Ooh and you can't come here and not order cheesecake...mmmmmm."
Alexandra K.,"NY, NY",200,864,53,4.0,6/25/2008,"I dined at the Cheesecake Factory over 4 years ago and was less than pleased but upon my return this June, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed what I ordered. The cobb salad is absolutely delicious and instead of the fattening ranch dressing that a cobb is normally doused in, the Cheesecake Factory cobb was dressed with a light, tangy vinaigrette. I would also recommend the eggplant sandwich. The sandwich was perfectly savory and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. If you are watching your weight, consider substituting the fries for a baked potato, fruit, or vegetables. Last, but certainly not least, the 6-carb cheesecake. While it does not sound appealing to those not watching their weight, it's actually delicious. It's lighter and fluffier than normal cheese cake and has a walnut crust which is actually a better compliment to cheese cake than graham cracker. Overall, I think that this is a crowd-pleasing restaurant -- there's something for everyone."
Oscar the Death Cat B.,"Chicago, IL",33,452,1,3.0,2/2/2006,"Tourist-infested and almost always excessively busy, this place might be worth your while if you are lucky enough to visit during some off-day when the waits are not too long.  Be sure to leave room for cheesecake, because that is the only real reason to spend your money here - the other food is served in generous portions but is nothing memorable.  The decor of the dining space is a bit freaky, it's as though some tacky futuristic nightclub had planned to use the space but sold their lease at the last minute to the Cheesecake Factory."
Michelle W.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,577,80,5.0,8/12/2005,"For some reason I always feel like I am walking into Strawberry Shortcake's house when I walk into the Cheesecake Factory.  Perhaps it is its whimsical cloud like design.  Their food is excellent, but always order the half pasta or salad unless you haven't had anything to eat in 3 days.  All of the chicken entrees are amazing and their crab cakes are very good for being in the Midwest.  Of course their cheesecake is mouthwatering.  But then again, with the name of the dessert in the name of the restaurant I don't think they would suck.  Try to chocolate mousse cheesecake.  You won't be disappointed."
a w.,"Chicago, IL",22,1216,1279,3.0,11/15/2005,"This Cheesecake factory could not be located in a better place. And the decor and service at this restaurant are top notch as well. BUT the wait times are seriously insane. It gets suuuper crowded on the weekends and you can definitely count on getting a long wait. But besides that, this location is top notch and, of course, you cannot leave here without having some dessert!"
Karen J.,"Marion, IL",0,9,,4.0,2/11/2009,I love this place. Food is always yummy. The portions are huge (even lunch portions). The menu is huge. The staff is always great and friendly. It is a bit on the expensive side but always worth the money. At times you do have to wait but never to long. If I don't have time to stop in for a meal I always pick up a slice of cheesecake to go. BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!
C L.,"Chicago, IL",12,36,4,5.0,10/2/2010,"I must say, the 4 different times I've been have impressed me 4 different times.  Huge menu - delicious food - and for a place with an hour long wait Sat afternoon, our food and service has always been at a solid speed.  Well run establishment."
Melanie V.,"Chicago, IL",634,870,247,4.0,10/12/2006,"I'm really not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but this place has absolutely delicious **pesto chicken pizza**!  I was kind of skeptical about getting it at first, but the waiter reassured me that it was really good!  And it really WAS good!  Plus, if you're a fan of gin, try the ***gin rickey***!  Gin, lime juice, sugar...complete heaven. ;)"
Seiji C.,"San Francisco, CA",359,336,,3.0,3/29/2008,there's three things i'd like to do at the cheesecake factory the first is mild hallucinogens to enjoy the cheesecake frosting/mushroom decor the second is absinthe to create some excitement from the masses of bridge and tunnel traffic in a city with few of either the third is eat. they do a good job of compensating with quantity
Paul C.,"Chicago, IL",88,508,,3.0,6/12/2008,"I went here with some out of state family that was lodging downtown and for some reason wanted to lunch here.  I kept hoping to see Oprah or Jerry Springer, but alas, no one famous popped in.   You know the drill with this place, great cheesecake, average everything else."
Julia B.,"Chicago, IL",2,798,,4.0,12/29/2005,Portions are huge and the menu is also huge. You might spend a good 15 minutes trying to decide what you want! Good luck! The food is tastey and the cheesecake is pretty good as well!
Ralph L.,"IL, IL",58,81,1,3.0,8/15/2007,"Stay away unless you like crowded, touristy type of eatery. Sometimes you can find a table within 10 minutes."
Jessica M.,"Chicago, IL",7,217,1,3.0,5/1/2007,I wouldn't ever go here normally but once my ex's parents were in town doing the touristy thing and they took us out to eat here.  I don't remember much about the food except that the portions are ridiculously huge!  How are you supposed to have any cheesecake if you can't even make it through half your entree?  I just don't understand.
Ed J.,"Chicago, IL",24,127,78,1.0,10/6/2006,"""its like a vagina in here!!""-chanaynay suckazzz"
M M.,"Everywhere Branch, MO",40,65,3,4.0,10/25/2007,"I have to say I really like coming here, the food is always made the way I like it, the cheesecake...well, what can I say...YUMMO!!! the cool drinks and the location makes for a very special lunch or dinner."
Nana H.,"Milwaukee, WI",54,232,123,5.0,4/11/2008,The first time I came here I wait was an hour once we got seated our food came pretty quickly. The location is really cool. The menu is really huge and the portions are also huge. I hadn't tried cheesecake before then I loved it. Thankfully they opened to locations a couple years ago(Mayfair and Bayshore). The Bayshore location has curbside service.
Jacksown S.,"Chicago, IL",66,2,,1.0,9/28/2010,"please, dont eat here. Even if you are a tourist. Following a friend who had planned the trip, our party of eight was treated as cattle from the time we walked in. No room at the bar, dont stand there, wait in the hallway, your plastic thing will buzz when we are ready.After being told 10 minutes, we waited for our table, outside in the cold, for 35 minutes.  Even after our plastic thing buzzed we waited, and waited. The server, who refused to write anything down, (eight of us!!)  told us it would be better to get our food order in the computer, then he would come back and take our drink order.  On a lighter note, the food was, indeed edible. Surprising because their open kitchen showcases a grill station that is basically on fire. I think the grill cook was actually on fire. First came one salad, then two more salads, then a few entrees started showing up. Complete apathy from our server. Now, I love cheesecake, but i went home."
Molly C.,"Milwaukee, WI",305,911,3,4.0,10/5/2006,"so, my department got a cheesecake from the cheesecake factory today. it was put out at 3 and was gone by 3:04. i am not lying. it's very very tasty."
