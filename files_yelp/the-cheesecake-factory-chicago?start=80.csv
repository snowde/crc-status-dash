DeeMarie W.,"Kenosha, WI",49,51,168,3.0,1/12/2017,"It's been a while since I have been to any Cheesecake Factory. The decor here in the Chicago place is awful. The food was good. Drinks were good. But for myself only, I had two top shelf long islands and dinner, I also ordered a cheesecake to go. 75.00 for myself with tip. Was it worth it, no not really. For that, I wish I went somewhere else. I remember the piece of cheesecake to be huge. I got a tiny little sliver. So many other options. Go somewhere else for that price tag."
Jolene R.,"Chicago, IL",2,19,1,2.0,2/15/2017,"I called for carry out twice and both times was told ""20 minutes."" I arrived 20-25 minutes later both times to find that my order hadn't been put in yet, so I had to wait another 15 minutes. Luckily, I wasn't in a rush, but I definitely won't be here if I do have to be back at my desk within a specific amount of time.  While I was waiting the second time, I asked for a jar of their salad dressing to take home. The cashier asked me three times which one (""sesame soy."" Say that 3 times fast!), and she still gave me the wrong one. Food: win, Service: fail."
Amy C.,"スプリングフィールド, IL",0,4,4,3.0,5/19/2017,"I ordered Thai lettuce wraps like always and mango smoothie. They are quite good. My boyfriend ordered New York steak, it's ok. We also had chocolate mousse cheesecake & coffee. The cake is ok but they don't have good coffee."
Saadia Q.,"Willowbrook, IL",2,22,68,5.0,8/6/2017,"We frequent Cheesecake Factory about once a year, usually on special occasions or girls night out.  My husband and I were staying at the Warwick Allerton Hotel downtown, and after a few hours on Navy Pier, were famished.  Hubby ordered pizza from Gino's East, which was meh...luckily, I didn't settle on plain old pizza.  I called and ordered carryout from Cheesecake Factory and it hit the spot!  Ordered the bistro shrimp pasta (I know it has over 2,000 calories in it, but they took off the shrimp po boy from the menu, which I was originally going to order, so I had to settle on this bad boy).  Let me tell you...It was ON POINT!!  Much better than the ones I've been served previously at other locations.  The pasta was perfectly cooked with that yummy lemon cream sauce and the breaded shrimp was just amazing.  I also ordered kids' mac n' cheese for the kiddos, with a side order of large French fries, all for $34 carryout.  Our order was ready in 30 mins and hubby walked the 0.2 miles to pick it up.  He also picked up a slice of Godiva cheesecake, which is our all time fav, and it did not disappoint.  I'm so happy we chose to do carryout and eat from the comfort of our hotel bed, rather than spend $70+ to sit in the restaurant, wait an hour to be seated, and receive subpar service (which has been our experience in the past at other locations).  We also skipped eating the bread, which would have added another couple hundred calories to an already high caloric meal...and, although I am up at 5:30 am trying to work off the pasta, fries, and cheesecake in the hotel gym, it was definitely worth every delicious calorie.  Will definitely order from this location on subsequent downtown visits."
Helen A.,"Cary, NC",30,124,150,3.0,7/17/2017,"I usually like coming to this place. But it's 9 o'clock at night and I have been sitting here for a literally 30 minutes waiting for a sandwich and a salad.. it is a little busy but not enough to make it a 30 minute wait. I do hope my Chicken salad sandwich comes out fresh because they just killed the chicken, and that is what took so long.. Ugh Stick to Cheese cake, at least that looks ready to go.."
Shay R.,"Chicago, IL",156,204,310,3.0,2/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been the ultimate high school date place.  Pros:  - Obviously the Cheesecake! I'm a fan of all the cheesecakes that incorporate some type of chocolate cake.  - The restaurant is huge so the wait is not as long as it may seem when you walk into the place. On a busy Saturday my friend and I only had to wait between 20 to 30 minutes.  - The employees, from the waiters to the busboys, here always seem to maintain a positive attitude even when they are obviously swamped with the amount of tables they have to juggle - Depending on what you order you can get a large meal that is probably at minimum two servings for a reasonable price.  Cons:  - This location it's always packed with tourist so you're always guaranteed to wait no matter the time of date.  - If it wasn't for the Cheesecake I don't think anyone over 18 would eat here. The food quality is sub par at best so they give you a serving size that could feed a family of 4.  - Due to this location always being so busy you always have a 50/50 chance of your food being cold. My friend and I was excited for our fries to arrive and when they finally did the fries were ice cold. The plate was hotter than everything that I ordered."
Amanda M.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,2.0,1/7/2017,"Lets start with the good. The guac and steak and salmon along with the drinks were all good. But thats where it stopped. Cynthia was our waitress, she was a nice enough lady but a terrible waitress. It took close to 10 minutes to come over and greet us. She took our drink orders and got those over to us but forgot the water, the first of 4 times asking for water. Then we ordered our appetizer and dinners. The app came and we still didn't have silverware or plates until she came and checked on us and we had to ask. The guac was great, but we had to wait another 35-40 minutes for our meals. For our second round of drinks she brought me a margarita instead of Sangria and said ""they are both Mexican drinks""....(FALSE). When my meal actually came out she forgot my creamed corn.. I believe the main issue was that she decided to not use a note pad so she had to come back and confirm what we actually wanted. The most aggravating part of the whole experience was that every time she made a mistake she would make up some long excuse to try and make us feel sorry for her. She even mentioned that her son was at another table and that they were caught up talking. The dinner was hard to enjoy because we were getting increasingly more upset with our service as the night continued...  A manager stopped by our table to check on us: Manager: ""How is everything this evening for you?"" Me: ""......um just alright"" Manager: ""Alright, well I just wanted to check to make sure everything was going well. You're  welcome."" **briskly walks away** SOOO AWKWARD!!! What was the point of even checking on us?!? This was the WORST service in my entire life.. the reason I created a Yelp account. To the management of Cheesecake Factory I would require Cynthia to take some training classes because she was not up to par with serving standards...."
David C.,"Chicago, IL",102,415,460,1.0,8/15/2016,"We went here because it was the only place open late that had desert and my friend was wanting chocolate cake and carrot cake. My experiences at the cheesecake factories has not been good overall, but I was hoping since they specializes in cheesecake, this would be different. It was not! First of all, customer service here is not very good and it may be due to all the tourism. For example, the register guy was on the phone for some time taking an order while we waited to make an order in person. Shouldn't someone else do that? Shouldn't you take care of the customer in front of you first. We were not the only one's with this complaint. They did serve us some huge portions as you can see from the picture. However, the cakes tasted like batter and were super sugary. So bad, we threw most of it away. I felt guilty at first, but honestly it was not made for human consumption."
Channing W.,"Laie, HI",276,21,11,5.0,6/17/2017,Great night with good friends! We had about 35 people in our group and they accommodated us with our own room! For dinner I ordered the chicken Madeira and steak Diane combo and it was cooked perfectly and it came out nice and hot. Our server Ro did an excellent job keeping track of where all of our orders were even though we happened to move around from seat to seat. Great service and excellent response time!
Dave T.,"Portage, IN",2,77,61,3.0,9/8/2016,"Giving it a 3 star mainly because the service was awful and the food wasn't that great, but the cheesecake was awesome. Came here not really expecting that much and basically got just that and then some.  To start off we where seating outside and when it started raining our waitress was no where to be found and when I tried to talk to another waiter he just ignored me didn't even acknowledge me. That was frustrating. Appetizer was the egg roll sampler which was really good just wish our waitress would of told us what sauce was what.  Ordered a simple mac & cheese burger medium. Don't know why they asked how I wanted to cook because they overcooked it anyways. Burger was kind of plan after the Mac and cheese was gone. I had it with the blood orange Mojito which was a very good drink and was truly better than the burger.  For the finale I ordered the ultimate red velvet cheesecake with a coffee no compliance cheesecake was awesome just wish I would've got a refill with my coffee.  Probably will be back again maybe try a different location but just come in for dessert too many good places to eat around Chicago!"
Edgar R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,,4.0,11/22/2017,Excellent juicy ribeye nice portions plenty of deserte options good bang for your buck. Our waiter wasn't the friendliest but the environment was clean and pleasant.
Anthony K.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",22,133,129,4.0,3/1/2017,"One of our favorite restaurants at n Chicago. Even though a chain, still it is very good. Their menu is extensive and it will take you a few minutes to read through. At the end you will not know what to choose from because they have a lot of good choices so you need to come back and try the one you like.  They also have gluten free and healthy portions to choose from.  I love coming here when the wether is nice and can sit outside. The atmosphere inside is good as well, pleasing to adults and children.  Another great meal last weekend with the family.  We will come back when the wether warms up."
Maria Q.,"Champaign, IL",145,77,148,5.0,8/5/2016,"Never disappoints me, I always get the same Lettuce Chicken Wraps Asian style that I love so much!!  my friends tried diferent things and they were all happy with their choices."
Debbie G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/10/2017,Went in on 09/10/2017order takeout salad and buffalo wing appetizer and wait over an hour and no apologies nasty attitude from manange and order taker won't be back in Chicago this was in Chicago at 413pm Sunday
Elliot R.,"Lombard, IL",0,35,5,2.0,8/19/2017,"2 stars only because Cheesecake Factory food and the drinks are always good - I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and a Strawberry Martini. I'd recommend you visit one of their locations that isn't a zoo.  The service at this place is atrocious. I've been here three times (it's just such a convenient location!), and it's probably the most *consistently bad* service I've seen at a place. They cram too many people into the limited space. We had people within arm's reach on both sides, so that it felt like we were in an awkward triple-date with strangers. No dinner conversations here are private.  The waiter will visit your table a couple times an hour, when they get around to it. Our entrées this time took around 45 minutes. The manager came by but offered no explanation or recompense.  The cherry on top was when, on finally seeing our waiter again after dinner, we asked to see the dessert menu. He informed us that it was just too busy by the kitchen and it was hard for him to put in orders. Yup, that's right, we went to the Cheesecake Factory and were told by our waiter that it would be too burdensome if we were to actually order some cheesecake."
Nikki S.,"Chicago, IL",31,208,48,4.0,1/20/2017,We had a large group here for a birthday and our waitress was fantastic. She was attentive and friendly. Our food was great and so was the cheesecake. The birthday girl had a blast.
Ann K.,"Chicago, IL",2,3,3,4.0,12/12/2016,One of my favorite places in Chicago. I ordered Grilled Pork Chop and it was AMAZING. The service was phenomenal! They were all so kind and friendly. Awesome location!
Robert S.,"Chicago, IL",162,1120,1196,3.0,1/3/2016,"Prepare yourself for this tourist haven.  It's loud, hectic and dark due to the location in a below-grade plaza.  There are times I've gone in here, and the wait was over an hour.  Today, I got right in.  The ambiance is dark, with a distinctive Alice in Wonderland feel to all the curvy columns and bubbly ceiling. The food wasn't bad.  Three mini loaves of bread as a start.  The sweet corn tamale cakes were a nice appetizer.  The lunch special was a little bit of a letdown since they were out of turkey.  The Renee's Special chicken-almond salad sandwich was salty, and the small ciabatta it came on was dry.  The side Caesar salad was fine, and the tomato-shrimp soup was thick and tasty. Our waitress was overwhelmed (aren't they always at big family places like these?), but she was very nice and kept the drinks flowing."
CJ S.,"Chicago, IL",39,110,85,3.0,5/13/2017,"My cheesecake factory dine in experience was okay at best. I order carryout all the time and my food is always excellent. The chefs here really know how to cook. The food is consistently good. However, the dine in experience was one I could have done without. To wait an hour for a salad is a bit much. I get my carryout in half the time, and it's stuff like pork chops or burgers or something they really have to cook. Also to watch people who were seated much after you receive their meals before you. I mean seated after the waiter has already taken and supposedly put in your order. The redemption for this visit is the food. As I said, the food is always consistent. Everyone at my table thought their meals were very delicious. My salad, even after waiting an hour was perfect. It will probably be a while before I ever dine in at cheesecake factory again. I will be back for a carryout meal soon though."
Jill O.,"Lansing, IL",69,375,949,5.0,7/8/2015,"This is my absolute favorite Cheesecake Factory location- it's the one that I grew up with. The interior is really cool and unique, and it's nostalgic for me. It's always a pleasant treat for me when I get to go there. Like other Cheesecake factories, the menu is huge, and the portions are too. You better come hungry, because the food is ridiculous. It's a little bit pricey, but it's worth it considering you pretty much get two meals out of it. Plus, the honey wheat brown bread is amazing all on its own, and it comes free to the table. The service is always great at this location- they're always working fast and hard, and are always friendly.  Most recently, I went with two of my friends. We started with an appetizer, the Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread. It was unexpectedly awesome. It was super cheesy and garlicky, and is one of the best garlic breads I've ever had. I'd definitely order it again. One friend ordered the  Grilled Pork Chop with applesauce, mashed potatoes, and spinach. He devoured it, and thought it was exceptional. The other friend ordered the Fried Shrimp Platter, which is the only thing she ever orders there, so she thought it was great. I ordered my favorite Chicken Madeira, which was delicious as always. Naturally, we also ordered cheesecake. Both of my friends ordered Fresh Strawberry cheesecake and really enjoyed it. I got the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. It was pretty good, but I don't think I'd order it again. It was too tart for me."
