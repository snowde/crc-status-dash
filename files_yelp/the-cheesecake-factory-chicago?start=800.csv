Joe S.,"Chicago, IL",5,112,1,3.0,2/8/2006,"Average food, some great cheesecakes. Three stars for the cheesecake, topped with fresh whipped cream. Sinfully good.   Eat dinner somewhere else, like the Grill on the Alley or the Saloon Steakhouse.  Have dessert here. And cut the tourists some slack. They just don't know any better."
Kelsey P.,"Grandville, MI",1,5,,5.0,11/2/2010,"When I first visited the infamous Cheesecake Factory, I was very young. I fell in love immediately, cheesecake is a rich, decadant weakness of mine. I had not dined in until I was a teenager, and I remember the experience well. It was the middle of winter and it was icy outside. Just outside was a large Christmas tree, which they erect yearly, it was magical. We went inside and there was barely room to walk. It was immensely loud and everyone was overbearing. We received a buzzer and ended up waiting about two hours. It was worth the wait, when we were seated, it was in a large booth to accomidate our large party. The menu is quite diverse and I had a very hard time deciding. Our food was timely and was quite delicious. Dessert was outstanding, they have a slew of different cheesecakes and much more. I definitely recommend it, although off peak hours are decidedly appropriate, for they don't do reservations (as far as I know..)."
Mariana P.,"Cincinnati, OH",26,242,,1.0,5/31/2007,"Why the heck would anyone want to eat here when Chicago has so many great local restaurants? I guess the cheesecake is OK, but the only people that eat here are tourists (and we all know how much Chicagoans love tourists...) Overpriced, mediocre food in gigantic portions."
elizabeth n.,"Chicago, IL",512,390,9,5.0,2/2/2006,"Huge portions, whimsy decor, amazing desserts- what more could you want?!  Although the crowds do flock to this restaurant- if you go during the week or at off-times you shouldn't have to wait for very long.  The menu is overwhelming but in a good way because there are so many great options to choose from.  I have liked everything I've had there but my favorites include the shrimp club sandwich, the asian chicken salad, and the turkey club sandwich.  And the desserts- I just can't get enough of them.  The chocolate cake is out of this world and the cheesecakes are amazing.  Some of my favorite cheesecakes are the vanilla bean, chocolate brownie, strawberry, and oreo cheesecake.  YUM I'm getting hungry for it now!"
james V.,"Westminster, CA",4,188,,3.0,5/12/2010,"It is like other cheesecake factory restaurants. However, it is always crowded because it is right at the foot of the Water Tower and next to many hotels. You can sit inside or outdoor. Not sure why so many people want to sit outside in ""windy"" city. Service is quite efficient. We had a Cesar salad and four cheese pasta. Average. For dessert, we had mango and lime cheese cake. It was very good."
Jennifer B.,"Chicago, IL",19,365,21,3.0,2/11/2008,"This place is good, like all Cheesecake Factories. The portions are big and the choices are unique, but not worth the usual 45 minute wait with hundreds of tourists."
mariya k.,"Chicago, IL",83,28,1,3.0,2/8/2010,what the hell is this place supposed to resemble? a mushroom or a warped candle sandwich of some sort?
Jason P.,"Chicago, IL",70,219,,3.0,1/29/2008,"Your typical cheesecake factory, with good food, oversized portions and the token cheesecake of course. Spend your money at Grand Luxe and you get less wait time, and the same food (same company). The orange chicken is always acceptable here. The drinks are pretty good, and the atmosphere is about the same as any other cheesecake factory."
Ann Y.,"Arlington Heights, IL",177,351,13,4.0,2/17/2008,"I love the cheesecake factory, but this one always has a huge wait, and honestly I can go to one in the burbs with little to no wait and get the same food. That being said, the food is great, service is hit or miss and the cheesecake is to die for. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone. My favorites are the pasta w/ 4 cheeses and the chicken Madeira. Misses are the pad Thai and the shepherds pie (so gross). Never had a bad cheese cake, but the banana cream stands out as the best."
Emma L.,"Chicago, IL",8,61,,3.0,3/1/2006,"I don't like this chain as much as it's sister restaurant, Grand Lux. However, I still enjoy a good meal at the Cheesecake Factory even though they make you wait for way too long to get seated.  I usually stick with their appetizers or salads- can't go wrong with any of those!"
steve c.,"Chicago, IL",72,337,30,5.0,5/8/2007,I personally like this factory. Yeah it's touristy and pricey but it's nice and have great over porpotioned food. You have to get the desert and force the cheesecake down or you can simply take one home. i tend to try to force and pay for it after. There may be a wait with one of those vibrating buzzer things as it does get crazy at times.
Matt B.,"Denver, CO",9,71,5,3.0,3/28/2008,"I work in the building and know that they have small plates from 4-6 Monday - Friday, so I had my boyfriend meet me there after work today so drinks and some food and was pleasantly surprised. I when to college where there was a cheesecake and ate there once every few months and love love love the bistro shrimp pasta. I moved to Chicago last year and this was my first experience at this location - and even though it is super touristy (don't hate it for that - most people do not have this restaurant in their town and the menu is more that big enough to accommodate even the pickiest eater) it was an overall good experience. My drink, a raspberry martini, was $10.50 and not very strong, so I wouldn't suggest it. We ordered three small plates from the bar menu (prices range from $2.95 to $4.95) lettuce wraps, pulled pork sliders and fried calamari. The pork was not pulled, just chucks, but good bun and sauce, but the pork itself really needed some work and some fat trimmed. The lettuce wraps (3) were good, fresh vegetables but the calamari was by far the best. I highly recommend that dish. Our service was great and the food was cheap and good - we thought we found a close place a get some food deals and drinks but the drinks were too weak for the price - probably would go back, but we are not running there."
Liliana S.,"Chicago, IL",57,677,,4.0,9/4/2005,This is  a great option for large parties but sometimes the wait is too long. I dont come here to often. It can get really loud and crazy. My favorite dish is the shrimp scampi. They always make it right here.
Jen K.,"Chicago, IL",118,88,,3.0,7/15/2007,"Just like Grand Lux Cafe, the drinks are overpriced and the portions are too large.  There's tourists everywhere and the wait is forever long.  The food is pretty decent though and its a good place for lunch while shopping on Michigan if the wait isn't too long."
Mark A.,"Bountiful, UT",27,22,12,5.0,3/7/2010,"I don't go to Cheescake factories all that much, but tonight I was looking for something good but not too heavy.  Adam H was my server in the bar area and gave me 2 suggestions on appetizer specials.  I told him I was looking for salads.  I guess he sensed that I was looking for something lighter because he suggested from the Appetizer section the French Country Salad.  It was EXCELLENT, the perfect portion (HUGE) with a great Balsamic dressing.  Then I had one of the special appetizers of the evening that was the Crab & Artichoke Dip that was warm with some toasted Sourdough.  Again, EXCELLENT! Even the complimentary warm sourdough and Oat Wheat bread was delicious. But the main reason for my review is the level of service.  Adam H did just and excellent job and welcoming me and helping me make my selection.  His level of service was excellent!  I asked to speak to his manager so I could tell him that what a perfect employee he had! Some establishments don't even know what the word ""SERVICE"" means now days, that was certainly NOT the case at the Cheesecake factory tonight!!"
Sarah C.,"Plainfield, IL",0,12,,3.0,11/5/2010,"We went to the Cheesecake factory recently and it was ok. I haven't been there in ages and got the Memphis burger. I was expecting to be delicious and great and it was a bit of a disappointment.. the beef was a bit dry even though I asked for medium. However, on the plus side the passionfruit mojito was great after a long day at work and we were on our way to see Traces. So until our next visit, I would say a 3...the passion fruit mojito was the redemption!"
Johnny S.,"Chicago, IL",7,125,,4.0,11/15/2005,"This is probably the fanciest restaurant I have ever been to, the atmosphere is really nice, and dim, and relaxing. When I was there it was very empty, but the food is good and the cheesecake is overwhelming. I am full just thinking about it. For a cool dining oasis in the middle of bustling downtown Chicago, head here to the Hancock Cheesecake Factory."
Gail T.,"Chicago, IL",11,80,,4.0,12/6/2006,"the four stars are for the VAST menu. you'll never get tired of the stuff here and plus it's affordable for its location. also.. it's a very beautiful restaurant. off the michigan ave entrance, watch out for the very slippery floors by the booths if your wearing stilettos. you will definitely fall on your behind! the waiters are nice but the last time i was there the waitress i had assumed that when we gave her back the check that the rest of the cash difference was her tip so never came back with our change which kind of made me mad. i was pissed already because when we entered it was crazy crowded and the wait time was 30 minutes but didn't know where to go to ask to be seated because it was THAT crowded.  greatest meals? factory burger or shrimp scampi and the virgin socialite drink is the frozen iced mango-- pretty and yummy."
Allen M.,"Fremont, CA",106,67,,4.0,6/27/2007,"This location is in the basement level courtyard of the Hancock Tower.  I have eaten at several Cheesecakes and this one is pretty darned good.  If you have the chance, eat on their upper, street level........... You might see Jerry Springer!!! He lives in the building and he cuts through the upper part of the restaurant when he leaves, at least he did when I was there.  Pretty cool, we all chanted JERRY JERRY JERRY!!!!!! He seemed a little embarrassed but he was accommodating and posed for a pic!"
