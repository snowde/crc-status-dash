Sarah-jayne M.,"Chicago, IL",43,237,,1.0,12/24/2008,"I wish I could say something good about Cheesecake Factory because I want to like it but every experience I have had here has been bad. One time in particular which ended in me running to the bathroom for an emergency bio break! Ewwww! First annoying thing is the wait. Now I understand that this place is in the mag mile so is overloaded with tourists. This would be fine except there are often many open tables and the college kid waiters are just immune to noticing. Zero sense of emergency!! In addition to that the food is just OK. Nothing special. It's definately aimed at the unadventurous bland american palette. There is just something so generic about it. The cheesecake for which it is named isn't that great either. Again it tasted mass produced and artificial. The only saving grace is the martini menu which are actually quite good - although pricey. For what you pay here in addition to the wait, try something else."
J D.,"Chicago, IL",82,291,12,3.0,11/3/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is, well, it's The Cheesecake Factory. The food is reliably okay, anywhere in the country. I do, however, love their new small plates menu. Thus our epic begins. The first time I visited this location, they didn't even give us a copy of the small plates menu. They just gave us the regular one. Since we were all tired and hungry, this led to a lot of whining and being pissy because we thought we'd come out for no reason. The server didn't do anything to remedy that, either. After finally settling on some regular food to order, we were told that the artichokes in the kitchen were no good and so I would have to order something else. Shouldn't the servers be told that before the dinner rush? Anyway, my food finally came and it wasn't great but it was passable. My companion spilled her drink and a manager who came to check on us told her he'd be right back to clean it up for us but never returned so she sat with a lap and table full of ice water for her whole meal. At the end of the meal we spoke to another manager who then discounted the enter meal save for the cost of drinks and we were pretty much satisfied with the kind and professional way he handled the situation.  Last week we returned and 'lo and behold, the small plates menu had been added to the main menu, avoiding any future confusion. Thank you, Cheesecake Factory! We ordered our meal and in the process of bringing things out, our server dropped both of my roommates' items. The food, when it came out, was tasty and I enjoyed it all (stuffed mushrooms, beet salad, garlic knots, a perfect assortment). Then the server got kind of creepy and starting trying to talk to us about the death of John Coltrane and asking my barely 20 year old roommate about her interests (he was closer to late 30s/early 40s) in a way that made us uncomfortable. So, I guess it's up in the air. Food can be awesome or terrible, service can rock or blow. Who knows?"
Melissa M.,"Chicago, IL",89,334,1,4.0,12/7/2008,"Wow, I can't believe I haven't written about the Cheesecake Factory yet. This has been my unofficial favorite restaurant for probably fifteen years now, if not more. I remember when it first opened in the Hancock building, I was in maybe second or third grade and I read about it in the Chicago Tribune Kids section, KidNews. And I begged and begged my parents to take me. And ever since then, I have loved it. This Hancock location is definitely my favorite but I have eaten in Cheesecake Factory's all over the country - seriously, any time I go on vacation, I always end up there because I love it so much. I almost always get the Chinese Chicken Salad - oh so good. Their burgers are also delicious, as is the pizza. The last few times I have gone I have gotten this Meditteranean mahi mahi special that is just delightful. The strawberry martini - heaven. And of course the cheesecake. My usual is white chocolate raspberry but I had key lime last time and it was also wonderful. Everything can REALLY add up though - I try not to go there too often. I always end up splitting an app, plus an entree, plus a cocktail (or 2), plus my cheesecake and coffee.... you can pretty easily spend $60+ just for yourself! I have heard complaints about bad service and stuff but overall I just feel that people have crazy high expectations of servers. I have thought this even before I WAS a server but being a server solidified my feelings. Anyway, I truly don't see how you CAN'T like the Cheesecake Factory unless you don't like chain restaurants or something, which I don't understand that either."
Nicola C.,"Chicago, IL",0,122,1,4.0,8/25/2005,"Great place to go if you are shopping on Michigan Avenue,  the tourists can get to you a little especially if you go at prime time lunch and dinner, however go on off times and you'll love it.  There is an extensive menu, which sometimes leaves you wandering, is there too much to choose from?  Great Cheesecake, and daquiris, definitely worth a visit."
Kristin A.,"Chicago, IL",6,196,,3.0,11/14/2005,"I really like the menu selection and food at this place, but it is always so frustrating just to get a table. It's full of tourist out shopping for the day. Plan to wait at least an hour on weekends. Portions are HUGE so plan to take home leftovers. All of the desserts are amazing. Getting cheesecake is a must."
Jenelle G.,"Chicago, IL",1,9,,3.0,2/27/2008,"The food is average, drinks are a hit or miss but the ""Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake"" is mindblowingly  good. And yes mindblowingly is a word!!"
tobey t.,"Chicago, IL",3,49,1,5.0,2/2/2008,"I like the tropical iced tea, frozen iced mango, chicken piccata, etc. so much..............."
Mary R.,"Bowling Green, OH",1,8,,5.0,4/7/2008,"I was there on a Friday night during the rush, and I had nothing but excellent service! Our wait was only 20-30 minutes, which seemed pretty amazing to me, and our server was always attentive to our needs. Our food came out quickly and hot and delicious! And dessert was even better. No complaints at all for it being a busy Friday night in the middle of Downtown Chicago! They are very efficient and effective!"
Ramon R.,"Evanston, IL",3,225,281,5.0,7/25/2005,Tooooooo crowded.  Build an extra wing for Chrissakes!  Great food but the crowding really gives this place a sort of Chucky Cheese quality.  I'm waiting for them to put up pinball machines here.
Mary W.,"Chicago, IL",1,102,,5.0,8/13/2005,"Oh my goodness their cheesecake is to die for!!!!  If you are a cheesecake lover like myself, you will find yourself in Heaven.  They literally have over 25 cheesecakes to choose from.  Starting with your plain all the way to a banana cream pie to choose from.  Not only do they give you a large piece to indulge in, but they cover the sides with whipped cream for decoration.  It just makes my mouth water just thinking about it!  Their food selection is also very good.  You definately get your moneys worth with the potions that they serve to you.  The atmosphere is also very fun!  You are seated inside what seems to be something out of Alice in Wonderland!"
Blah B.,"Chicago, IL",0,312,68,4.0,3/26/2007,"Comfort food!! Seriously it is!! I love the corn cakes, the chicken pot pie, their salads are pretty good and the Spicy Chicken chipotle pasta is delicious!! My boys are def. fans, thought I'm not sure if it's the food or the wondrous list of desserts?!!"
Amy K.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,4.0,12/6/2011,"After many trips to downtown Chicago, where tourism is huge, it is a nice to find a place where the staff is genuinely professioal and sincerely kind. The Cheescake Factory in the John Hancock Towers is a great place to relax and eat a  delicious meal. The staff is happy and even the cooks and bus boys are smiling. Everyone there is generallly just "" happy!"" The friendly hostess, who is bright and conversational seatee me and stuck a a coverstion and asked me about my stay The waiter ,( named Daniel M) was also bright, friendly, calm , and professional,. As I ate my appetizer I watched this truly happy staff be jovial and congenial with the customers, and each other! Wow. My crab and cream cheese won ton type appetizer( do not remember the specific name, was delicious I also orerded the Chicken Regatta , which was also very nicley prepared. In a place where  literally millions travel to for shopping, dining, and cultural events, and many of the tourist employees are rude, this place is THE exception. A classic piece of cheescake with a nice hot cup of Earl Grey Tea completed my visit to the Cheesecake Factory. All of them were smiling.,. not one grumpy face in this place,  So refreshing to have that customer service. And I have visited many places on Magnificent Mile. So go visit them!"
Jilly M.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,5.0,1/17/2012,Interior is absolutely beautiful. Location is pretty superb at the bottom of the Hancock building so is a must when visiting Chicago. The wait can be long at the weekends but a good tip is to sit in the bar area where we were sat almost immediately. I recommend the Avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. Not being an avocado fan I loved them. Really delicious. The staff are all so nice and aim to please. Red Velvet cheesecake is also a must have but my favourite at the moment is the Oreo Cheesecake. It's so good. But having had appetizers and entrees they are happy to let you order dessert to take away. They even pack it up in a really presentable way with all the dressings etc. If your visiting Chicago you have to go to the Cheesecake Factory. It's such a great experience! Reservations are taken Mon to Fri during a set time only (there are some limitations re: party size and times) but the wait is so worth it if there at the weekend. Go!!
Julia W.,"Saint Louis, MO",266,429,112,4.0,1/8/2007,"For what it is (essentially, a McDonald's with fancier looking food, servers and mildly interesting decor), I give The Cheesecake Factory 4 stars.  I had a team lunch here last week after a 10 year hiatus and I can't say I really missed the place.  If you ever wonder why America leads the world in obesity, visit The Cheesecake Factory.  The size of their menu is a hint at the size of the portions.  The lunch portions are massive.  The appetizers definitely make 2 meals--I know, I had the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which were actually quite tasty with the peanut dipping sauce, for lunch and dinner.  My teammates all had enormous helpings of food from meatloaf to salad nicoise to pasta and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  I can't say much about prices because it was on the company... which is just how I like it for a place I really don't care about much.  All in all, though, the service was good, the place was relaxed and my food was worth eating twice.  Believe it or not, I skipped the cheesecake.  How's that for willpower?"
M M.,"Chicago, IL",3,134,,3.0,1/23/2009,"Really can't tell the difference between here and Grand Luxe.  Huge menu, large booths, reasonable prices.  It's a fun atmosphere to come here for a birthday or a big group of friends!"
Clare M.,"Chicago, IL",0,56,,1.0,3/31/2011,"Bad, bad, bad.  Lunch with my two teenage daughters on a Sunday.  Upside?  wait to be seated was not long even thought the restaurant was crowded.  Waiter was friendly and attentive.  Food?  UGH.  Ordered the lunch size chopped salad.  Came in a timely manner.  Taste?  Presentation?  A total turnoff.  I recently had the same salad the CF in Woodfield in Schaumburg, and it was delicious.  This one was absolutely so different from the other one I could barely tell it was the same item.  First of all, it was brown and I asked the waiter if it was supposed to be this way.  He told me it was from the balsamic vinegar dressing they used.... hmmmmm, don't remember the Woodfield salad being brown at all.  This was a tasteless, wimpy soggy mess of a salad with not enough bacon or chicken to boot, and too much egg salad like they were trying to hide something.  I kept expecting something to pop up out of the salad.  Plus side, they took it back, I reordered the Thai pasta with high hopes and again, was hugely disappointed.  Soggy beansprouts atop imitation Pad Thai with spagetti noodles?  Salty?  Check.  Soggy?  Check.  Awful?  Check.  Check. Check.  Will not go there again.  Items are overpriced, food is too salty.  Overall, the place is definitely for the average diner who doesn't expect much in taste but a lot of food.  Sorry guys."
Jerry O.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,,1.0,7/27/2009,"This place was very very dirty.  Sticky menus, sticky tables.  The silverware and the plates were not clean.  I can't believe a restaurant that is in the John Handcock Building can have such low standards for cleanliness.  They need to shut this place down for about a week and do a serious scrub down of this place.  If you look close you will see the grime and filth that poor suspecting suburbanites and tourists will spend an arm and a leg to eat at.  Gross just gross."
B M.,"Chicago, IL",1,20,3,5.0,1/24/2008,great cheesecakes of course..plus their blackened shrimp is very spicy and very good
Jonathan S.,"Chicago, IL",6,16,,2.0,6/13/2007,The cheesecake factory is great if you want to eat gigantic portions of mediocre food on the cheap.
Jeff A.,"New Lenox, IL",0,34,,3.0,7/9/2007,"This place seems to get mixed reviews and I've only been there four or five times but I find myself having to stop in for lunch everytime I walk the Mile. The thai pasta is actually very good as another reviewer mentioned. The interior is cool-looking as well as the bathrooms. They also dish out a mean cappucino (I'm not sure if they still have the coffee bar but they did when I went there). All in all, I try to stop in here pretty hungry after walking the Mile and maybe a shopping binge at the Virgin Records Store. It's worth a try to decide for yourself."
