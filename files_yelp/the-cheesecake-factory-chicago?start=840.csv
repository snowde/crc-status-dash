E M.,"Chicago, IL",3,12,,1.0,3/22/2008,The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to hang out with friends and the ambiance is nice but the selection of food is horrible.  I remember once I went there the waitress was very rude.  I went there a couple of times.  I remember one time I ordered a roasted chicken and they sent me out a whole chicken that was not cut up or anything.  I  was like what is this and I had it sent back.  I ended up ordering quesidillias instead.  I'm like what kind of meal is that.  But that was the only thing on the menu I was interested in.  The second time I went once again there was nothing good on the menu and I ended up getting a boring pizza.  Once again not my ideal meal when I go out.  I am not a cheesecake lover and their menu doesn't have anything that interests me.  The food is to overpriced and the wait to be seated is too long.  The only thing good about this place is that it is renowned but there is not too much offered behind the name.  Since the food is so horrible the place comes off cheap to me.  Avoid and continue your search downtown for a nicer restaurant that has better food.
