Robert R.,"Bonita, CA",112,35,79,4.0,10/8/2017,My family and I come here at least once a month and you get exactly what you would expect from a huge chain restaurant. We go here so often cuz they have sooo many options. Cheesecake Factory is perfect for families cuz everyone can find something they really like due to their variety. We always get the lettuce wraps and the Nashville nuggets along with the shepherds pie! Those items are almost always on our table when we dine here along with other food. Their drinks are really good too! My favorite is the pineapple mojito!  I wish they would try to stand out from the chain through their service or something. But after speaking to a lot of their servers it's my understanding that it's a very hostile work environment due to management. Hopefully that changes! I'm huge on customer service and I understand there's a lot of background stuff going on but 4 stars for now until I receive better service. Food came out great and our server yesterday was sweet but she also had us wait a long time for our check.
Lindsey B.,"Chula Vista, CA",12,119,109,1.0,12/17/2017,"Came to TCF for lunch on a Sunday. We were seated on the patio and placed our order of Kids pasta with butter, chicken and biscuits, and chicken and waffles from the brunch menu.  We waited over an hour before receiving the two meals pictured. Both had spent an extended period of time under the heat lamps. The plates were too hot to touch. There was no butter left to be seen on the hard Kids pasta. The gravy of the chicken and biscuits had created a thick film across the food and had burned onto the vegetables. My husband never received his food at all.  I asked to speak to a manager and after ten minutes he came to the table to say he was sorry for the delay in my husband's food. That they ran out of poached eggs but would have more in 2 minutes. I showed him our food and stated we were not comfortable eating that and quite honestly we weren't interested in a remake. I asked him ""Would you eat this?"" And he responded that no he wouldn't nor would he feed it to his family. Yet it was served to mine.  Very disappointed. Very surprised the only option he gave us was to wait for a remake of food that we had already waited an hour for."
Joanna R.,"San Diego, CA",900,186,169,3.0,12/7/2017,"Service was alright. But that comes with the company I guess. We didn't get waters right away nor the bread, (which is amazing, BTW)! They told us that they were making a new batch of the brown and sour dough bread, but when we got them, they were already hard. I was definitely looking forward to some hot bread!  I had gotten the breakfast burrito; which was BOMB! Although I wish it had more bacon in it. Other than that, it was so yummy! The whole meal itself already filled me up!  My friends also got other things as well, but the dish that really stood out was their lemon pancakes! It was almost a dessert pancake, that did not need anymore sugar, AKA syrup on it. It was perfect the way it was!  Parking here was a hassle, but good thing we got there earlier than usual. I love the area that it is in. There's definitely places to see/ just walk off that big meal that you just ate!"
Sarah H.,"San Diego, CA",175,97,261,3.0,12/5/2017,"Never had breakfast here before so we came right as they opened, 11 AM on the dot.  We had a seat at the bar area but were advised that the seat we chose against the mirrored wall isn't a ""seat yourself"" area at the bar. Whoops!  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive the entire time. The mimosas are a bit skinny for how expensive they are. Pretty disappointing if you think about how much champagne is in that flute. Tasted more of the orange juice than anything else.  We ordered the monte christo sandwich because I've never had one and it sounded yummy. My husband ordered the waffles and chicken bennies and said he loved it. I wish my sandwich wasn't so cold by the time it came out. The eggs were a little watery and the french toast bread was mushy. Kinda reminded me of something you'd order from the McDonalds breakfast menu.  No worries, though. We still come here for dinner and cheesecake but probably won't come back for breakfast."
Kika P.,"San Diego, CA",79,30,20,5.0,1/8/2018,"We were on a rush to go to a doc app and told our waiter if he can rush our order , he was super nice"
Sherry F.,"San Diego, CA",225,146,123,3.0,11/28/2017,"I love any of the cheesecake factories in San Diego, but this location just has slow service in all the times I've went. I always get the same dish and it tastes the same always, which I appreciate. I also appreciate that our server told me I had the option between red sauce or white sauce on my dish... she's the first person who has ever asked so it was a nice perk to try my favorite dish a little different."
Maritess C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",651,1121,4657,4.0,3/11/2017,"I came here for a late lunch with my daughter. They have kid's menus which was great. I typically don't come here often but I did receive excellent service from our waitress. We got seated within a few minutes. For starters, we got bread to munch on. I ate the brown bread and my daughter had the white sourdough bread with butter.  I was so thirsty more than hungry this time because of the heat. I get really dehydrated but I also needed the caffeine in my Diet Coke. My daughter got an apple juice. She was thirsty as well. For our meals, I went with the orange chicken with white rice lunch size. The dinner size is bigger portions. My chicken was good. Tangy and sweet which went well with the white rice. I was full after eating 1/3 of my meal. My daughter ate a little and we took our leftovers home. She enjoyed her meal. So glad to see her stomach happy. Service was excellent by the people here. Our waitress made sure we were okay and checked up on us frequently. I definitely liked that. Great service by our waitress."
Cicely K.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,29,14,2.0,12/3/2017,"We tried ordering from here last night via DoorDash, but something went wrong so we ended up doing carry out.  We ordered the kids mini slider meal for my child.  This is what the inside of both of them looked like."
Jerry A.,"Chula Vista, CA",47,30,5,5.0,1/1/2018,"Always a pleasant dining experience, food is good nd the of course the cheesecakes.. Do check wait time if you don't like waiting for 45 mins."
Abigail V.,"Chula Vista, CA",379,108,151,4.0,4/20/2017,"I've been here many times before and I'm surprised they have quite a low rating. I've never had a bad meal here so it's pretty unfortunate for those who have; i.e. while waiting for my table, I overheard a family complaining about an issue with the hostess, yikes. I guess that speaks volumes to Cheesecake Factory's inconsistency, but I'm giving them 4 stars because I've always had a positive dining experience.  I recently came to this location for Easter Sunday brunch with family. We were expecting a wait and were told it would be 30 min (got there around 10:30am) which wasn't too bad. We ordered the egg roll sampler as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good. It came with 4 types of egg rolls and 4 dipping sauces, see picture below. My favorite one was the pork! For my entree I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes since I was craving something sweet and was also looking for something packed with carbs to give me energy for the gym later lol. I'd say these were probably the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. They came topped with sliced strawberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. My only complaint would be that it wasn't lemony enough. There was lemon zest on top but it definitely wasn't enough for me to taste in any bite. Might as well have been called Strawberry Ricotta Pancakes haha.  Our waitress was incredible, very nice and accommodating. She always made sure we had everything we needed, along with each of the other employees that dropped off food at our table.  I guess based off of everyone else's reviews, this location is a hit or miss. I do personally recommend though, given that their menu is insanely extensive so there will definitely be something for every palate. Good for any occasion, special or casual!"
Sheltiemomm S.,"Lemon Grove, CA",61,110,28,5.0,11/4/2017,"YELPers! Saturdays must be when the, 'cream of the crop ' work, since my server, Alexandra, the incredibly fresh, crunchy Factory Chopped Salad, front Â desk staff & Alonzo were friendly, efficient, & Management's Leadership was palpable. Eat here for savory & of course, (what else?) Key Lime Cheesecake)!"
Jamie V.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,2,5.0,1/2/2018,I love the food! We had a waiter named Christopher who was great with svc and did anything we asked. The food is so amazing Every time I go there! my favorite restaurant.
Yuri H.,"Chula Vista, CA",105,21,23,3.0,9/18/2017,"I've dined here many times and every time, you just don't know if you'll have a good experience or a bad one. The food here isn't always consistent. Sometimes I really enjoy it and sometimes the food isn't that great. We took my dog to the dog park and afterwards eat and cheesecake was the only restaurant that let our dog eat with us. plus we like cheesecake for the most part so we came here which worked out for us.  We waited for like maybe 7 min to get seated outside. There was one other family eating outside and I don't know how they felt, but we felt pretty neglected. Yeah we're sitting outside, but shouldn't you check up on us and see how we're doing too.  Anyways I ordered the barbecue ranch chicken salad lunch portion and my mom got the pasta carbonara lunch size also. You can't really go wrong with salad so I enjoyed mine although I do wish it had more dressing. But the pasta she got was way too salty. We didn't even bother to ask our server for a new one because that would have taken another 5 years. It's a good thing I ordered the salad though to even out the saltiness.  I feel like you just have to be lucky to have a good meal here. Other times I come here for pasta it's fine and then other times it's too salty. Pretty disappointing"
Dee G.,"San Diego, CA",7,158,18,5.0,11/15/2017,"Not a fan of chain restaurants, but the menu is so extensive, from appetizers, to entrees, to desserts, & drinks. Definitely a great spot to bring picky guests who aren't into the new crafty food concepts. The food & service here is always great, even when it's busy."
Jimena P.,"Tijuana, Mexico",5,30,92,4.0,11/12/2017,"One of my favorite places for breakfast lunch or dinner everything is delicious I give 4 stars instead of 5 because the quality of the food and service is not always the same, even in salads the taste is diferent in every visit, for example this time the salad din't taste so good."
Maria C.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,50,4,1.0,7/4/2017,"The last two times I have ordered take out from here there have been bugs on my lettuce (Thai lettuce wraps). WASH YOUR LETTUCE!  7/4/17 UPDATE:  please look at the picture, this is from today's order. I will be contacting corporate. Thank u for your response."
Yara T.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,29,7,2.0,11/6/2017,"Service here sucks. Our food took forever to get to our table and then our appetizers were never put in apparently. Â So we never got those, either. Â Never checked in on how we were doing once our food came and had to ask for water refills. Â Cmon. Isn't that like serving basics 101?? Such a bummer, this place could be great. Prime location, and yet it's the last place I want to visit when I'm in the area."
Eliel C.,"Chula Vista, CA",17,94,281,5.0,12/22/2016,"I've been coming here for years. And I can't think of any negative. The food and portions are great. The service from the hostess, bartender, to waiter is always exceptional. Â The draft beer is always I've cold, and the mixed drinks are always high quality.  I stopped here today to take a little Chtistmas shopping break at the bar. The 22 oz draft Stella was served perfectly. And I'm not a big ""greasy food"" type of eater, but for some reason the Macaroni and cheese cheese burger really caught my attention from the menu. The bartender told me I wouldn't be disappointed. And boy was he right. The medium-rare meat was cooked to perfection and the burger was amazingly good. Loved every single bite of it.  This is definitely one of my favorite places to come out and east when ever I'm in the Otay Ranch area. It can get a little pricy though. The Burger w/ fries + a 22 oz and 16 oz Stella ran me $32. Â But hey, you get what you pay for and I'm not complaining."
Marisue G.,"San Diego, CA",81,295,560,5.0,7/24/2017,"Service here can be a hit or miss but so far, it's always a hit with me every time we dine here for some sweet cravings or pasta cravings or any cravings that they could satisfy. For me, food is always good and i try to order other items in their menu just for the sake of being able to ""explore"" and try it out to see which ones i would like. I have not encountered any unidentified crawling/flying/drowned insects yet and hopefully it would never happen. Living within walking distance to and from this location is a huge PLUS :-) I love the cheesecake factory!"
Abigail N.,"La Mesa, CA",192,188,55,1.0,5/21/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE!  Came to eat here cause it was the first time my dad would meet my son. They quoted us 20 minutes and paged us. After taking our pager our party of 9 was left standing at the front. Some blonde lady in pink, didn't say who she was or if she was a shift lead or manager or whatever told us that they were ""just checking in"" with us and that there was no way to know how long it would take for the people at the table to get up and leave. She said it would be rude of her to tell those patrons to leave but then in the same breath told me that my toddler could be fussy and would probably be better off waiting at Barnes at Noble until the table was ready. Do the pagers even extend that far? I think they did tell the patrons to leave though because a huge party walked out and none of them looked happy at all.  We were hungry and we're ready to put in our main order with the appetizer but our server insisted that he would take that order later. While waiting for our mains to come my mom finds a huge fly sitting in the bottom of her sweet tea! They brought us a new tea and that same blonde in pink came over and asked us how we were doing, didn't apologize or acknowledge the fly or anything!!! We asked the waiter if he had told his manager and he said he did but she didn't say a word about it.  Also my fiancÃ© ordered a medium rare burger and they served him medium well. This has happened every time we come here and I don't see the point in asking customers if they're just going to cook it however they want.  They didn't comp anything or apologize at all when clearly they were at fault for a lot of problems. Also when I went to the bathroom the hostess checked the stalls but didn't wipe down the counters which was sucked because I needed to get my toddler on the counter to wash his hands."
Kristie B.,"Chula Vista, CA",86,259,1174,3.0,12/20/2016,"I'm not a fan of chains. But, due to a severe lack of really good, locally owned, restaurants in this area of Chula Vista, the hubs and I have stopped in a few times on movie nights. I can't speak on other Cheesecake Factory locations, because I've never been to any others, but this place isn't half bad. The menu is massive, so prepare for a bit of a read. The portions are ridiculously large so prepare to take leftovers home or just leave quite a bit of food on your plate at the end of a meal. Given the menu and portion size, my meals have - so far - been well prepared and seemed fresh compared to other chains. The beer selection is small, so if you're looking for craft brews to choose from, you're out of luck. Despite the place seemingly always has a line, we've never had to wait long. Service has been consistently friendly and attentive. All in all, a decent spot for a meal in Otay Ranch Town Center."
David H.,"Chula Vista, CA",169,100,18,4.0,7/6/2017,"It's the Cheesecake Factory!!!! Â If you're not ready to sit there and look at the 32 page menu, you might as well just order curbside and take it to go. Â  That's really my only negative comment. The menu is too big.  If you live in the area of this specific place, you know it's always packed at certain hours. If you still go and you're making the ""I just farted, but I don't want to make a noise smell"" face - that's your fault. Â Plan ahead! The free bread is always a plus and the servers are always super nice! Â  The cheesecake selection is ridiculous, but dope! Their Oreo Cookie shake is my favorite! Â It's pretty much the only rival to Jack In The Box. Â Jack In The Box is cheaper though. Â  Beer selection could be better but it's not a bar so it's okay. Â  The only thing I never understood is why are the uniforms White??? Â  Seems like the company should be adding a detergent expense to their employees."
Leslie L.,"Spring Valley, CA",7,8,,5.0,12/19/2017,This food it's so good I love everything from their salads to their pastas. They have very good appetizers. This location can get very busy.
Joe T.,"San Diego, CA",62,1693,13708,4.0,10/6/2016,"I like the food at the cheesecake factory. Â I do not usually eat at one because it is usually crowded when I go and I usually avoid national chain restaurants unless I am craving something specific or can't decide on an alternative. Â I am glad they divided the menu into a two. Â The old menu was like reading the yellow pages. Â It had so many pages it would take me a minute or two to find a specific item on the menu. Â The cheesecake offerings alone is a page or two. They have really good cook to order burgers. Â I usually order a plain cheese burger but it is really good. Â Service is good, on par for a national chain restaurant."
Cherilynn C.,"Chula Vista, CA",81,25,31,5.0,9/7/2017,Alex and Shayna are the best bartenders. I always love seeing these girls behind the bar....they make my chocolate martinis so perfect! Fried chicken sliders and and baked potato tots are my favorite go to items. Honestly have never had a dish that I don't enjoy.
Joy M.,"San Diego, CA",428,426,9110,5.0,9/5/2016,"Came here on a Friday late night no waiting ! What!??? Â This CF location has a beautiful interior lightning & cute decors that sets your mood ;) We ordered the following drinks & foodies ;  Hubby - Chardonnay cheesecake, shrimp scampi and Vietnamese fresh rolls. Mine- Reisling, salmon rolls n beet arugula goat cheese salad from Skinnylicious menu it has lower calories same taste in the regular menu. Delish!!! Kiddos- salmon n Mac n cheese n burgers sliders. Oh boy no room for desserts why oh why ?  Overall great dining experience our server was super friendly n attentive. Stellar service!!! Definitely coming back here! They have over 200 food choices in their menu. Appetizers, small plates and of course desserts!!! Nom nom nom ;)"
Melissa B.,"Chula Vista, CA",181,110,12,1.0,9/4/2017,"My family dines here every so often, with service being ""okay"" and tolerable. Today was just bad from beginning to the end.  We were quoted a 25 min wait and given a pager. We requested outdoor seating since if it was available first and noticed no one was being seated outdoors anymore. I had my teenage daughter go to check in and let the staff know we'll take any available seat. My daughter comes back to tell my husband that they had paged us and called out name. That was a flat out lie. My husband was livid and said the pager didn't go off. We were also sitting outside and our names weren't called either. I went back inside to tell the staff what my daughter told us and they said we'd be seated right away. After 5 min of waiting we were finally seated. When it was my turn to place my order, the server mentioned that they didn't have that dish available. She hands me a paper that listed the unavailable dishes... I swear there was about 20 of them! I told the server to take my husband and daughter's order and to come back for mine. When she comes back, I choose another dish. That was also unavailable too. I was starting to get frustrated. She just explained that the restaurant underestimated how busy it was.  If a restaurant knows IN ADVANCE that more than 10 dishes are unavailable, this should be announced at the time of checking in. Customers should know in advance the menu is limited, especially for the popular items.  If that were the case, my family would've left at eaten elsewhere. My husband wanted to get up and leave, but we already waited 30 minutes and were seated. Not very happy with tonight's dining experience. I would give zero stars if I could."
Julia C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",126,66,238,5.0,5/4/2017,"I had the pleasure of having Katie as my server. The service was prompt and my server was a sweetheart. My beets with goat cheese that was out of this world delicious came out within five minutes then shortly after my pear and blue cheese flatbread arrived. Everything was delicious and made with love. Presentation was wonderful and the portions are big, although I ordered from small plates and snack menu the portions were still great. On my way out I grabbed a white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake recommended by Jeremy to go and didn't regret it because it is now my favorite cheesecake on the menu. Overall a wonderful experience that will keep me coming back and recommending to all of my buds."
Susanne R.,"San Diego, CA",450,542,888,4.0,3/31/2017,Had the skinnylicious green salad and the basil Tomato flatbread. Perfect amount of food and super delicious.
Peter P.,"Chula Vista, CA",461,104,242,5.0,4/18/2017,"This cheesecake factory has the best sheppard's pie in town. Â I tried the one at Karl Strauss and it was no comparison. Â This location is also big and clean, located in a busy outdoor mall in otay ranch. Â Parkung might get tight in the evening. Â Staffs here are friendly, fast, and very professional. Â  Although a little on the pricey end, it is worth eating in a elegant environment."
Latasha H.,"San Diego, CA",49,316,1327,3.0,2/5/2017,"Splendid variety of cheesecake/ dessert options. The cheesecake is better than the food. This location is located in Otay Ranch mall. The parking is not that great because two other busy popular restaurants are located on the same side. Portion sizes are modest considering its chain restaurant.  Customer service is average nothing extraordinary. I have never been here without waiting less than 45 minutes for a table.  My favs appetizers are the sweet corn cake tamales, warm crab dip and fried wontons. Appetizers are a shareable portion.  Cheesecake! Cheesecake! Try them all. My favs are salted caramel, chocolate tuxedo, crazy carrot cake, white chocolate raspberry and snickers. But don't limit yourself to 1..... try a new one! Sometimes I just go here for the cheesecake!!!  Additionally, this is a children friendly environment and they do have kid's menu that actually cater to young children taste buds."
Hannah J.,"Otay Ranch, Chula Vista, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/31/2017,"From the moment we stepped in, all the employees treated us with such kind attitudes, especially our waitress Jasmine, who was super attentive the entire night. Although part of our order got a little messed up, Jasmine made sure to get it taken care of and worked really hard to ensure we had a great dining experience. Thank you Jasmine!!!!!! :)"

Marc H.,"San Diego, CA",43,2,,1.0,11/23/2017,Your add said you are open on 23rd Nov but your close seen a lot of people stopping by to pyull the door tsk tsk tsk not good business
Lorna C.,"San Diego, CA",49,117,41,4.0,8/27/2017,Our server was super sweet and the food was as good as all the other cheesecake factories that are up to par are. I've eaten at a couple bad ones but this one was really good. I saw the manager walking around having her presence known which was nice. We ordered the usual stuff. We like the pasta da Vinci and ordered the macaroni and cheese burger. My kids had spaghetti and one had the sliders. I would definitely come back here had a good experience.
Carlos F.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,15,21,5.0,1/14/2017,"Been coming here for a while now and they never cease to amaze me with their excellent customer service and food!!! Brian our server was absolutely AMAZING!!! He's personable, recommended some very choice drinks and food (whiskey smash is perfection), he was constantly mindful of how we were doing and even boxed our food for us (a nice accoutrement that most places don't do for you). Food was spectacular. I ordered the avocado egg rolls, baked potato soup and cajun jumbalaya pasta. My wife ordered the meat loaf and my mother ordered a veggie melt... 5 out of 5 easily for the quality and craftsmanship. Been to plenty of other Cheesecake Factory restaurants... this place outshines them all! Customer for life."
Yupchuck B.,"San Diego, CA",1,22,5,2.0,8/5/2017,"The server messed up my salad order twice and was unapologetic. I asked for no dressing and two times it was brought out was soaked in dressing. The quality and presentation was lackluster. My friend ordered chicken and it was cold. Dinner on a weekend had very dim lighting- to the point it was hard to read the menu. The server left to go home right after giving us the check. Really, you can't wait a few minutes for us to pay? When I said we can give our credit cards now, he shrugged and said just give it to whoever walks by. Wow. I've had a much better experience at other cheesecake factory locations. Will not return to the Otay Ranch location."
Julia S.,"San Diego, CA",1,4,,1.0,11/29/2017,They forgot our nachos order. The salads were not fresh and good. Bad experience. I will never come back to this place. The staff need to improve.
Orion O.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",52,10,3,4.0,11/12/2017,"I dined here with my wife and kid for dinner. We had a great experience and the food was very fulfilling. We couldn't be happier having such delicious food in the neighborhood. I was disappointed with the desert because if it's not the original cheesecake, it will be overwhelmingly overpowered with other ingredients that make you wonder if you are eating cheesecake. If you get cheesecake from this factory, stick with the most original for a complete dining experience."
Eliza C.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",27,5,7,3.0,7/30/2017,"Dirty utensils )):  I've been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for years now and I've always had a great experience. Their employees are friendly, the food is great, wait times are reasonable, and it's the perfect place for all types of occasions. However, I was really turned off today by their dirty utensils. My family and I came for Sunday brunch at around 11 a.m. and only waited about 15 minutes, which is really great for brunch. When our hostess brought us to our table, it had yet been cleaned nor set. We had to wait another 10 minutes until we were seated. We easily excused that small fumble as our hostess was very friendly and had a great sense of urgency. She apologized to us and even helped clean the table herself.  Before we shuffled into our booth, we noticed that the seats were not entirely cleaned off. There was left some sort of grease stain that we had to awkwardly bring notice to to an employee. Not only were the seats still dirty, but so were our utensils. I first noticed a brown smudge on my fork that I honestly was just going to wipe off with my napkin, but then I noticed that all of our utensils on the table had crusted food on it. We then had to, again, awkwardly tell an employee that they gave us dirty utensils.  The second round of utensils they brought out to us were definitely cleaner than the first, but they still had unsightly white marks on them. We didn't complain, we just decided to wipe them ourselves. Fortunately, not long after, another person came by and brought us very clean utensils that were shiny and warm, probably freshly cleaned. We were pleased with their helpfulness but the switching of utensils twice got very annoying.  As always, Cheesecake Factory is a fine place. I most likely will continue to eat here. I just really hope something is done about their dirty dishes. It can easily turn someone off to this restaurant. Not gonna lie, we were contemplating on going to another restaurant because of it. So please, be sure your dishes are clean before served!!"
