James S.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,9,,1.0,11/11/2016,"I've dined at the The Cheesecake Factory in Mission Valley, Chula Vista (Otay) and the one located on Harbor Drive. The facilities are very clean; however the meals were consistently very bland and overpriced. San Diego has some great restaurants; however, when it comes to taste the Chesecake Factory doesn't even rate as mediocre in my opinion."
Princess L.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",115,27,21,1.0,1/29/2015,"Came here for my nieces birthday & our service was sad.  Our waiter was very impatient considering my family can be a little indecisive. But instead he got another waiter to cover our table and told us he was ""going home"" yet continued to serve both tables on each side of our booth.  On top of that, the new waiter that was given to us, oh yeah him' havent seen him since we were told he'd be our new waiter. Empty drinks down to watered down ice.  I don't know what we did really to deserve such crappy service.  Our food wasn't even all that great taking 25 mins to get two entrees.  It's sad."
Liz B.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,7,3.0,2/25/2016,"Impeccable service as always... I've been here and to other Cheesecake Factory locations many times, and have always been happy with the food and service. But this most recent visit was the first time I tried the spinach and artichoke dip. So many good dishes on that menu, and this just isn't one of them. The spinach tasted a teeny bit soggy, and the whole dip overall was pretty flavorless. I had to pile on the salt. Order the Thai lettuce wraps, or the loaded potato tots... both of those appys are awesome. But skip the spinach artichoke dip. Not great, not even all that good."
Patrick A.,"Little Italy, San Diego, CA",47,51,14,5.0,10/24/2014,We love The Cheesecake Factory. Delicious beautiful food and a very nice atmosphere. We come here on special occasions and always have great delicious memories.  This location in Otay was easy to get here and plenty of parking. And of course the cheesecake was great!
Melody H.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,5,,5.0,6/19/2015,"My husband and I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory yesterday for lunch. We sat at the bar ordered lunch and enjoyed every minute. The bartender/server was amazing. The food was great but the hospitality was even better. We will definitely go back to visit Josh, he made us feel so welcome.  Thanks again Josh, Robb and Mel"
David V.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,,5.0,10/31/2014,"If you have been here and didn't give this establishment 5 stars YOU ARE TRIPPEN service, food, everything thing here is on point will come back SOON!"
Bethseba B.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,17,3,3.0,12/15/2015,Very common place to eat . Not my favorite I never go anymore. I only like the margaritas here. But the food is just okay just normal .
Kevin P.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",3,43,2,5.0,1/25/2016,"As far as local spots go Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite. They have so many different choices for whatever you crave and at any time of day. Love the dessert here obviously, especially the cheesecake. Nice environment and friendly employees too. My only complaint is sometimes the togo is a bit slow answering to take an order, other than that this spot is golden."
Lauren F.,"Chula Vista, CA",72,33,3,4.0,3/1/2015,I always love going to Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dish is the Chicken Costaletta that comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The bread and butter is great to have. Love sitting at the bar because it is the fastest service compared to sitting at a table with a server. Quiet ambience making it easy to hear the person you are sitting with.  Only reason I give it a 4 is because it is always pricey to go get a plate of food but it is always great to have some leftovers for the next day as well!
KBelle B.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",1,15,17,3.0,4/5/2014,"I've given this location several chance to see if they have improved their cooking... and it seems they still don't quite match the taste and cooking style of the original Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley Mall or in any other location like in Orange County. My all time favorite Pasta Da Vinci... They make it either too sweet or too bland... Today it was too sweet... The mix of wine and parsley and other ingredients just didn't set in well together. As for everyone else's meal... It leaned in the sweeter side. Maybe the chef just has a sweeter taste when it comes to the food.. But it didn't match the taste we were all expecting from previous experiences in other locations.  Service was good for a busy night. ("",)"
Ana P. P.,"Chula Vista, CA",110,27,110,4.0,1/29/2014,"I live right around the corner and I constantly come here to eat with my family or on dates with my boyfriend. Always great food, though they usually mess up someone's order just a bit- it never fails.  This time around I had skinnyliciois soft tacos with the vegetable salad in escabeche and mimosas. Very tastey."
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1032,765,1723,4.0,1/6/2011,"Yeah, it's a chain. Some are good and some are not.  But when you take that long drive down the Toll 125 fwy and Chick Fil-A across the street won't cut it, you have to keep this place in mind.  After you park your weather beaten SUV and take that long stroll to the neon sign, you are instantly greeted by a fresh faced college co-ed who promptly seats you among the dozens of leather booths and wicker chairs.  The dimly lit ambience arouses your senses, the flashes from the large LCD monitors above the bar attract your attention, the all-white dressed servers impress you with their fast paced efficiency that is accompanied  by a never ending smile.  I've been a fan of this restaurant chain since 1993. I've always ordered the Chicken Jambalaya Pasta. The quality has wavered from location to location but I'd say it plays well here. The dishes are always filling and you'll be tempted to conclude your meal with a slice of their award winning cheesecakes. If you're out of room, take it home...but I doubt you'll let it sit until breakfast.  Mark my words.  It's all about the cheesecake.  Really, it is."
Mimi H.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/15/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory normally but this location has completely disappointed mainly due to the chef that prepared my food. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and the linguine was not cooked. Normally I don't send my food back but this time I had to unfortunately do so. The waitress (who was very sweet and polite) returned to the table to tell me that the chef said,"" that is how the pasta is prepared."" I let the waitress know that this is a dish I have always ordered and I know what uncooked pasta taste like. She went back to the kitchen, and after talking to the chef came back to let me know that it'll be about 10 minutes. When I got my Cajun jambalaya I notice there was a lot of water in the bottom of the plate, the shrimp was over cooked to a rubbery texture. It tasted watered down. He may have just added water and reheated it in the microwaved. I have worked in a restaurant myself and I will say that if the customer doesn't like something you do everything you can to make the customer happy. The Chef seems like he doesn't like criticism. Thank you for ruining my Dinner. On a more Positive note the waiter and waitress were amazing."
Joseph G.,"La Mesa, CA",190,18,,4.0,3/14/2016,"Great Place , Great Atmosphere ,Great FOOD. With that being said, my Wife, Kids and I waited for about a full hour to get our food. I got mine, my kids got theirs. However my wife ordered fish with Mash Potatoes ...something was wrong with the making of potatoes... Mind you my wife ordered that combination for the Mash Potatoes. After awhile, They offered her to have the fish now and wait for the potatoes she settled  for salad by time that came around The kids and I were already done with food and the Wife was already frustrated. So she asked for a box and I asked to speak to customer service.(Manager) Manager came over and Corrected the Problem with My wife meal that was now free. I still tipped the Waiter $20 because whatever the problem was, the waiters , manager were Excellent. Maybe just a Bad day. We understand and we will be back."
Lauren D.,"Chula Vista, CA",153,20,41,5.0,2/25/2015,"My birthday was on Monday I had a group of 23 come in. The wait staff was great. The food came in a timely manner, they didn't mess up anyone's order or bill, and everyone was friendly. It was a great experience and I'm glad I spent it there. Plus the food and cheesecake was AMAZING."
Keanu H.,"Chula Vista, CA",38,33,31,5.0,9/15/2014,"Oh, baby baby! This was my first time @ The Cheesecake Factory last night, and it was Awesome!!! I couldn't be more proud of my reward after the Pops Concert @ SWC (which I performed with the Jazz Vocal Ensemble and for my Solo), so me, my mom and dad went there to have a nice small family dinner. First, I tried the Crispy Crab Cakes with Mustard Sauce which was D- wait for it... licious! It's nice, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside of the crab, and putting it on the mustard sauce was a nice touch! Oh, and I also tried the fried cheese triangles, which were pretty good too. Next, I got the Fresh Basil, Tomato, and Cheese Flat-bread Pizza which was so good. It has a nice, thin, crispy crust of the flat-bread, and the fresh basil, juicy tomatoes and gooey cheese, just marvelous! and I also tried a bit of mom's Shrimp Scampi, or whatchamcallit? But, is still pretty adequate. And Finally, here it comes... CHEESECAKE!!! Eeyup, My Favorite Part! I got a piece of the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, and it is ""Hands Down"" and ""I'm in Heaven"" GOODNESS! It's always Moist, Indulgent, Creamy, Sweet, and best of all, YUMMYTASTIC! Overall, the food's great, the atmosphere is great, the staff are wonderful too, and I can't wait to have that whole entire same cheesecake on my B-day!!! So if you haven't been there, you've GOTTA come and try their cheesecakes, it is the BOMB."
Ana N.,"Chula Vista, CA",109,198,12,3.0,8/10/2015,"So disappointing. I came here for happy hour with a friend and my toddler. The staff was very nice and accommodating, the location itself is very beautiful, the food is a completely different matter. I ordered the buffalo strips and when I got it it looked like fried chicken. Turns out that they marinate the chicken in buffalo sauce and then fry is. It is pretty gross and greasy. The drinks were good. The other food we ordered was pretty nasty too though. My friend got the fried mac and cheese and for some reason it was pink (?). Yeah I don't even know what to say to that. Anyway, I wouldn't come back unless it is for dessert, because I know at least their cheese cakes are delicious!"
Cristina A.,"Tijuana, Mexico",1,66,225,5.0,2/22/2015,"Loved it... It's one of my favorite places to eat... The best part, no doubt is the desserts..."
Natalie M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/14/2016,This is my go to Resturaunt for a good fast dinner. I love sitting by the bar and service is always great.
Darlene B.,"Phoenix, AZ",97,653,794,3.0,10/30/2013,"I've been with a large party and a party of 2.  Service knows how to handle either or. But sometimes they don't check in enough, especially in need of a to go box or drink refills. Food is the same at any location, so I won't stress how the food tasted.  This place can fill up fast, especially when trying to get a seat at the bar."
