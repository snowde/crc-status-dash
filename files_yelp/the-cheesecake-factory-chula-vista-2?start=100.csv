James B.,"San Diego, CA",2,49,,4.0,4/16/2017,"The CHEESECAKE FACTORY was there today for Easter yes the service was slow but. I understand they where busy. But still the waitress was nice an pull threw on the service. I would have tipped  20% for spot on service but today. I felt a least 15% we enjoyed our food. I had the Bang Bang Chicken an Shrimp it was awesome! Also, walked out with a New York Cheesecake to go!!"
Nick N.,"San Diego, CA",32,58,85,5.0,10/14/2016,Fantastic dinner tonight! We ordered the Thai Lettuce wraps which come with three different sauces. All the sauces were great but the peanut sauce is by far my favorite! We also ordered four cheese pasta which was phenomenal! The seasonal Karl Strauss is Oktoberfest. Great selection after a long work day. Jackie was our server and was awesome! She had perfect timing on when to come and check on us.
Jeneth D.,"San Diego, CA",142,157,458,4.0,3/12/2016,Ordered the herb crusted salmon and crab dip. Service was prompt and food was better than expected.
Sabrina T.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,35,39,4.0,10/12/2016,4 stars for having vegan options and John who took the order for our office lunch. His customer service and personality were great. Everybody seemed happy with their orders. I ordered the avocado toast it was good. I was disappointed that they would serve it so burned on the bottom maybe since it was a to go order they though eh...they can't say anything about it. But I had to. I still ate it cuz I was hungry but each bite ended with that burnt taste. The 4 stars really is for the customer service I received on the phone and for having vegan options. Maybe consider a vegan cheesecake slice you can call it non dairy or whatever for your meat eating customers not to be afraid of it but it'd be a good idea. Honestly I haven't eaten here in like 2 years because of the options were limited. But it was a coworkers lunch so I'm glad I tried it again. Probably won't be back anytime soon.
Marie D.,"San Diego, CA",0,35,3,1.0,10/2/2016,"I loved cheesecake factory. I used to go every week. Elegant dining at a reasonable price. HOWEVER... Service, food quality, and presentation has gone down the toilet. Servers don't care... Cooks not following the menu.. I ordered a California (avocado, onions, mushrooms tomatoes, garlic, cheese) omelet and coffee. I asked for spinach instead of mushrooms. I got a cheese and spinach omelet.... I asked the server for avacado since apparently it was forgotten. 15 minutes pass and I get a chunk of avacado. Seriously?? Subway would have given a bigger portion, let alone cut it up! I tell the server I'm upset regarding the amount of avacado. I get half of what was provided but in small little chunks the second time. The side of tomato I got was not even ripe.  Sad that profit has cut in before quality and service. Pathetic. Time to find another restaurant."
L B.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,11,13,5.0,5/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory at Otay Ranch will always have a special place in my heart. Whether it be Happy Hour, Curbside pick up, DoorDash Delivery, Dine-in with family, or friends, their food and service delivers. With their generous portions, vast selection of entrees and desserts, and tasty cocktails, I will keep coming back."
Gaige H.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/15/2017,"Usually Cheesecake Factory is our go to during the week, we sit outside they accomodate our kids and usually even if the food and drinks take forever the server is generally really sincere and likeable. Today was definitely a different experience. We were greeted by the manager and my wife who works at a fine dining restaurant had a good interaction with him, unfortunately our server was not the same. We were greeted a little harshly, considering there was two other tables on the patio and the inside was dead for a lunch time so our server didn't need to be so stressed out and grumpy. Gave him immediately our kids order and drink order and appetizer order. I had also asked for waters but after three different table touches (each time he would bring out different drinks instead of prioritizing and bringing everything together we would have rather waited a little longer then two drinks here then a few minutes later another drink and then the waters after that). About 15 go by we receive our kids food,  with no sign of the appetizer we ordered at the same time. Probably 20-25 minutes in he comes by and says our food will be out shortly and we ask to cancel the appetizer since it's been over 30 minutes. What's the point of asking for a starter if it comes with the meal especially since we ordered it 15 minutes before we ordered our meal. Ten more minutes go by, we get our meals and I had noticed the chicken was dressed in vinegrette when I asked for no vinegrette, but they were good. But server didn't do a check back and only brought our stuff because the hostess couldn't get a to go box. As someone who has worked in food service it's just a shame when your go to place not only makes you not want to come back but also puts you in an agitated mood because of the lack of service knowledge."
Elaine G.,"San Diego, CA",0,27,,5.0,6/25/2016,"Busy Week lots going on... We wanted to celebrate Fathers Day.. but did not want to have to deal with The San Diego Crowds ..We decided to check out the Cheesecake Factory's Breakfast Brunch-  Thought it would be worth a shot due to the large crowds waiting to get in ton the weekend. We did not have a reservation but arrived right when they opened. There was a 20 Minute wait because Our Large Party did not want to sit outside- smaller parties were seated in the bar area which does not feel like a bar. The wait, however, was well worth it.  Ambiance: Very Chill. I would definitely come here again for breakfast Service: The Service was on Point. The Server showed up within 3-5 Minutes of our seating introduced herself to us, took a drink order. Drinks were served promptly. We took our time ordering but did not feel rushed even though you could see people showing up in Droves. Once we ordered the Food was served Promptly with a minimal wait.  Food-  Wow so they put bread on the table even though the Breakfast comes with a side of Toast!  Our Table ordered Poached eggs and Fruit, Two Factory Omelets, Crab Hash,and  Monte Cristo Sandwiches With Drinks. The Lady Next to Me had the Chicken and Waffles. Every thing was on Point. I did not get a chance to take a bite of the Crab Hash but I did have a bite of the Monte Cristo OMG soooooo friggin good!! Lots of Food Leftover- The lady sitting next table over had the Chicken and Waffles -It was beautifully plated as was the Crab. I overheard her telling her daughter how good it was and offering everyone bites."
Melanie Z.,"Hampton, VA",2,245,,5.0,2/27/2017,Took the family here for lunch. We all enjoyed our meals. My daughter ordered the pasta dish called the Di Vinci and it was delicious! I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was delicious as well. My husband ordered a burger and he said it was really good. Wait staff friendly. Service very good! We will return! Highly recommend!
Lauren L.,"San Diego, CA",356,176,81,4.0,8/5/2016,Great location with tons of parking which is crucial when you are starving! They have such a vast menu with so many different offerings. The staff is very attentive and accommodating as well. I really like this location!
Lauren P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,15,4,1.0,3/18/2017,This place is horrible. My son and his friends went there for his 18th birthday. Waiter took forever to bring the food. Food was cold according to my son and they messed up in the bill. He's not going back he said.
Cheryll 'n James U.,"Chula Vista, CA",69,118,269,4.0,2/7/2016,"Came her for the first time in a long while. Tonight the service was excellent with drinks being refilled regularly and yet not being too intrusive. I say to others that waiting/stewarding is a skill most anyone can do, but it's the little things that make service stand out, as was experienced tonight. Ordered crab bites for starters; they were exactly that bights worth, true as stated in the menu;quality ingredients as best as I can tell. Entrees were good, however my other half's Carbonara was not as rich as other places, and my Fish and Chips was made of quality ingredients however the portion size was not nearly as large as what I've received elsewhere. Dessert was excellent, and super rich. What else would one expect with cheesecake being in the name. So good, that we couldn't finish because they were overwhelming in their denseness of flavor. This location feels more laid back than the Fashion Valley location. It makes it more inviting. Of course the bill was higher than one would het elsewhere, but for the service and the dessert it was well worth the price (this time)."
Mary P.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,5,,2.0,4/21/2017,"Wow! I ordered my usual, turkey burger protein style. The patty was 1/2 the size it normally is. I wasn't going to complain at first, but I knew I was going to leave hungry. Lol I showed them my patty that they gladly  took back. 20 min. later, I swear, the same -1/2size patty was rewrapped  in lettuce, minus my salad! Didn't complain. I guess they have downsized! Wont be ordering my usual."
Aisa H.,"San Antonio, TX",154,276,238,5.0,11/16/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here for date night with another couple. The wait wasn't so bad considering the time and day of the week (Saturday around 6pm). Our server was wonderful. He came when we needed him and he was very informative with our questions. The food we ordered was great! I don't know what it is about the steaks here, but they melt in your mouth and are more than worth what you pay for. This place was nice and the portions were good. The restaurant was clean and was a comfortable place to have dinner."
Francisco B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/27/2017,This location is by far the worst if you ever need to order to go!  It takes so much time to get the bakery to answer the call let alone get your order right!  I've given them ample chances to win my service back and each time they've let me down.  I cannot imagine how much worse the service will get once more people move into the area. They better get their act together because more businesses with a smoother operation will inevitably win this market.
mike j.,"San Diego, CA",121,33,38,1.0,1/14/2017,They told me 25 min I've been here for 45 min on curb side. Finally got my food and she's been gone with my change for another 10 min never again!
Teresa H.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,27,,4.0,12/16/2016,Good food and many choices! My only problem with them is that they don't open until 11:30!! What's up with that? I would think the opening at 11:00 would boost their food sales. Not pleased with having to wait outside the door for 1/2 hour with 20 other people!!!! Otherwise nice place to eat and good service!
Osvaldo C.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,4,1,4.0,12/25/2016,"Is is true that Cheesecake Factory is not serving Police officers who are armed? Say this is not correct, so I can continue supporting your location, otherwise, you just lost another regular customer."
Amanda B.,"National City, CA",0,5,1,2.0,8/19/2017,"So I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. It's fun and upbeat and the food is always great. However, I'm at dinner with my gf. Who keep in mind is younger than me. I'm 30 yrs old. When I showed the bartender that I only had my paperwork from the DMV and a picture of my old license, she denied me a drink. Even asking her manager if they would accept it in place of my picture ID. She was so consumed with arguing the fact if i was really my age that she never bothered to look at my friends drivers license. She asked but never looked at it. So this to me is unacceptable. You are sure that you cannot serve me a glass of wine but you serve my younger partner a drink without ever glancing at her ID..? To top it off, after telling me she could not serve me and it was against the law, she adds the favorable comment, ""oh well DD it is."" WHO SAYS THAT TO AN UNSATISFIED who customer?!?! Incompetence at its finest. Understandable she couldn't serve me, just doing her job. But is rubbing it in also in her job description?"
Larry G.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,13,4,3.0,9/19/2016,The best thing about this place is there is usually no wait. The food is just as good as the one in fashion valley.  The kids like the food and there is more that one choice for them.  I would give an additional star but my wife got a rock in her salad last time we were there. The management was very concerned and professional about it. We will keep going there.
