Brittany W.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/12/2017,Came here for my birthday with my family and I love it. Everybody really liked their food. I was also surprised about all the options they had.
Oscar G.,"Mission Beach, San Diego, CA",221,9,2,5.0,3/3/2017,"Went the other night and had Aaron V. As our waiter  great service. The food was delicious I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo and got my food sooner then expected because of how busy it seemed. One of the plates that my party ordered was a bit late due to the fact that it took longer to cook, they came out to apologize and offered a free cheese cake due to the wait. Overall the dinner was amazing and the service was great thanks again Aaron and Staff."
Mayra L.,"Chula Vista, CA",47,2,,1.0,7/12/2017,"Went there Sunday evening for dinner.  Husband ordered chicken and rice dish,  kids ordered Cajun chicken littles and FRIES and I ordered fish and chips basket.  Everyone's dinner came out except my husbands,  waitress kept saying it was on its way out. Dinner never came out, manager brought it out after we were all done eating saying sorry for the delay, at that point we talk her to box it up.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go, waitress came out with box dinner and said sorry and she would comp the cheesecake for our inconvenience.   Long story short,  the chicken plate was thrown out Monday night at home.  Rice was so hard and chicken was soft and falling apart.  Definitely not a dish to take home and attempt to reheat.  I'm very disappointed in the managers attempt to make it better for our experience,  I really think the right thing to do was take that chicken dish off the bill and offer dessert on the house.  My last three experiences at the Otay Ranch Cheesecake Factory have not been the best.  Disappointed in the lack of customer service and the lack of ability to make a great experience for a family of four having dinner on a Sunday evening.   SMH"
Sarah G.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,1.0,7/24/2017,"What a lack of customer service here last night! Our server was Aaron. We came for a simple appetizer and cheesecake. It took forever to even be greeted..Then it took while to order. Took more than 20 minutes for Mac and Cheeseballs to come and we had to flag down Aaron the entire time if we wanted straws for our drinks, when we were wondering where the mac and cheeseballs were, when we wanted to order our cheesecake and coffee, and when we wanted our check!! The ENTIRE time! Even then when we asked for the check he just dropped it off and didn't say a word. Not a thank you for coming, have a good night, NOTHING!!!!! Worse customer service ever! What a waste of my money."
Jacob J.,"Spring Valley, CA",7,3,,2.0,1/8/2017,"Food was amazing... service was terrible.  Never order alcoholic beverages from this place. My girlfriend HATES whiskey. That being said, she loved my whiskey smash and whiskey sour.  Mix, water and a splash of alcohol.  For the price, these drinks are a joke.  Enjoy the area and the food but don't expect much for service or drinks.  Also took about 15 minutes after our appetizers to get our drinks (including wat er)."
Mimi C.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/13/2017,"We waited so long to get our food. Waited 45 minutes and the people besides us had gotten their food way before us. So after waiting for so long we told our waitress we were ready to go, so she was going to come bring our check. Another waitress came out with the food but we told her we were leaving so she threw our food out. And then our waitress came out and told us we didn't have to pay due to the wait that she was going to box our food. By then she found out the other waitress threw our food out. Moral of the story is service sucks!! Don't ever come here, Waiting so long for horrible service."
Nicki O.,"San Diego, CA",106,7,9,5.0,1/6/2017,Jessica was our waitress and she is by far the best person in customer service. Well taken care of the whole evening. Served hot food. She was very friendly. I am totally impressed. The food and atmosphere was awesome
Robert B.,"La Jolla, CA",1009,346,347,4.0,6/8/2015,This Cheesecake factory has parking nearby and comfortable seating. I order the fish and chips which were excellent. My father-in-law ordered the chilaquiles which were excellent according to him. We had to wait quite a while for our food but it was worth the wait. I ordered the Kahlúa Oreo cheesecake for dessert and it was out of this world.
Shea O.,"Chula Vista, CA",82,53,38,4.0,11/7/2016,"My steak diane was a bit dry than the usual. Other than that, everything else was great!"
Andy A.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,74,168,2.0,10/7/2016,"The only reason I'm writing this review is simply because the manager was definitely not on point this time. Our waiter was excellent! I want to make sure he gets the best credit unfortunately I do not know his name but in speaking with him he loves his job there and he's a great employee!  I ordered the meatloaf because that's what I wanted to eat. not a problem if you have something that  happens and the last piece crumbles I understand. However everything I wanted with the meatloaf; like the sides is what what I wanted. So, the manager tells me there was a mishap and the meat basically disintegrated. That if I wanted to order something else. I told him not really I really want meat and nothing else. I then ask him if he could just throw a steak on the plate because I don't want to change the sides that it came with. The manager then tells me he cannot reinvent the menu because his name is not on the building. I tell him that's obvious but if there's an error way after I ordered my food that they should of came immediately and told me and not waited so long. Again I tell him just pick any steak and drop it in the middle cooked and we'll be done. He says he cannot do that that I have to pick a steak item from the menu. So then I say fine get me that ribeye steak. Well that steak is $27 he says. I don't care give me the $10 steak just put a piece of meat on my plate with the sides of the meatloaf.I don't understand why it's so hard for him especially after waiting so long to get my food which I didn't get. I pretty much will not be going back to this place and will continue to go to the number one cheesecake factory in fashion valley. And I will tell all my friends not to go to the Eastlake cheesecake factory because of this manager who does not know Customer service.  Epic fail dude."
Zero S.,"San Diego, CA",3,12,6,2.0,3/18/2015,"If anyone has been here and said lunch was great - they're lying. I came back here got the chicken avocado  sandwich. Which was recommended by our waiter. Taking a bite is comparable to eating a street taco. Conceptually this is challenging to eat. Had to deconstruct some of it to make it manageable. The main focus which was the chicken and tasted under seasoned and reminded of of those sandwiches you get at 711. My wife got the mac and cheese and she also had issues with her dish. The macaroni they used was the bigger shell. Not the standard elbow style some are use to. And the cheese was a bit to salty for one person. Tasted like kosher salt or parmesan got dumped in. I been here twice in this location and wasn't a fan of their lunch menu. The manager was nice enough to remove both items from our bill. Honestly, the service is good here. Its just to bad the food isn't the same. -ZERO"
Claire G.,"Sandy, OR",0,3,,5.0,7/11/2017,"I love the food here, especially the club sandwich!! And service with a smile is one thing you won't have to worry about, the hostess who I believe is named Ashley has one of the warmest smiles and personalities I've seen in a hostess!"
Lala I.,"Chula Vista, CA",135,2,,5.0,6/17/2017,"I don't yelp often but our server Deanne was so amazing I had to do more then leave a good tip! My best friend and I went to celebrate my new job and took my 7 month old with us. Deanne was very attentive to the fact I had a child. Most places usually ignore her. I order her a side of avocado to feed her and asked for it to be brought with our dinner. While we were scarfing down the great bread they serve Deanne shows up with a plate of bread and bananas made into a butterfly for My daughter. Even at 7 months my baby knew it was for her and was so excited. She made sure she cut it so the baby could hold the bread herself too. Besides being extra sweet to the baby she was on top of everything and never left us looking or waiting for her. We had her get us refills multiple times, sent her back for BBQ sauce and she always came back quick and friendly. Deanne is definitely a reason to go back. I love great customer service and I definitely got it from her!"
Nathan M.,"Chula Vista, CA",88,40,30,4.0,5/22/2016,There food has been down on flavor and quality but yesterday I was surprised i ordered skinnylicious grilled salmon and had lots of flavor. Servive was a little slow but we were a party of 15. This is always a usual spot for us.
Diane J.,"Cardiff by the Sea, CA",25,81,,1.0,9/4/2016,"I have been to numerous Cheesecake Factory restaurants and have always found them to be safe bets for groups.  With a menu that size, everyone is going to find something they like to eat.  What I didn't like about this place is that the eggs on my chicken and waffles benedict, while poached correctly, had clearly been kept in cold water and then placed on my hot food.  I asked if I could get warm eggs as soon as our server made his way back to our table, which took a while.  In the meantime, I had eaten part of the waffle and chicken.  Instead of just bringing my new eggs, he took my plate back to the kitchen with him.  When he returned, half of my food was missing!  WTH?  I contacted Cheesecake Factory customer service, but they never responded.  I definitely feel like I got ripped off.  My son had a Chinese chicken salad, which was fine.  I'm sure I'll find myself at CF again, but certainly not the one on Birch Road in Chula Vista!"
Angie G.,"San Diego, CA",1279,430,1612,2.0,1/19/2015,"The wait for this location is as long as Fashion Valley. We had a group of 4 girls and waited about 35-45 minutes on a Sat. night (not surprised). BTW- they also have valet which is $5, I had no idea until I walked up. I was lucky enough to catch a great parking spot. We were seated and was attended by the waitress quickly. It took ME forever to order since the new year, I've been tracking my macros and using the MyFitnessPal app. Cheesecake factory has an entire menu dedicated to the Skinnylicious section.  The waitress came by and proceeded to take our food orders, well guess what...On a Saturday night they were COMPLETELY out of ALLLLLL Skinnylicious salads and Salmon (various ways of it being cooked). I was in outrage, I wasted all that time looking for something that would fit my macros. I told the waitress that really stinks and it would have been nice for her to let us know that ahead of time, since she did see us looking at that specific menu!  How does a chain restaurant (very popular) if that run out of ALL salads and salmon?!?! Bad business....That is why I don't really come to this restaurant."
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,2.0,1/12/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory has to be one of the worse ones I've ever been to.  I originally wasn't going to review this place, but after another long wait to be seated and served, a review was necessary.   I should know better because; A)  I've been here before and received bad service. B)  Some of my Yelp friends gave this Cheesecake Factory less than stellar reviews. C) They don't take reservations D) All of the Above You guessed it, it's D.  If you don't know already, Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations.  This is bad business, especially for this one.  Our wait for a table was well over an hour.  Add another 15 minutes for them to take our orders, another 25 minutes to get your food (some of which was delayed), and extra minutes to eat it.  In all, expect to be here 2+ hours for food that is just okay.  We ended up missing our movie because the wait was so long.  As for their food, no huge complaints here. I didn't get crazy with my dish and opted for their salmon entree.  This dish was pretty good, but definitely not worth the wait.   Overall, I'm still a fan of Cheesecake Factory. I usually give them 4 stars. But not this Cheesecake Factory.  When I'm in the area, I'm sure that I will be eating elsewhere.  But if you don't mind dinner taking most of your night, then come here."
Amanda R.,"San Diego, CA",33,60,,4.0,4/22/2016,"The food and cheesecake are tasty, a lil pricey but super yummy and good quality. I had a bad experience with my food not being good (not my usual experience) the manager comped my bill so that made things better. The banana cream pie cheesecake is the truth!!! It's alot cheaper if you buy the whole cheesecake!"
Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1362,5.0,10/11/2013,"Personally, I love The Cheesecake Factory. It's probably one of my favorite restaurants, and I eat out a lot. Emphasis on ""a lot"". My family and I eat here on multiple occasions... Birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, or simply to satisfy a craving - mine, specifically. Although the wait is long, the food makes it worthwhile, I'd have to say. The service always make a visit to this restaurant a positive experience.  I love the bread that they serve whilst looking through the menu. My usual: Chicken Madeira with a strawberry, mango smoothie. My sister's usual is the fettuccine with chicken and sundried tomatoes - perfect. My other sister normally chooses something different from the ""Skinnylicious"" menu, and everything is pretty satisfying. That sister's boyfriend tries something new each time, and nothing ever disappoints! My mom typically orders some type of salad; all are different, but each taste just as great. Lastly, my dad either gets a nice, juicy steak, or salmon. Our favorite cheesecake that we order is the white chocolate macadamia nut slice of heaven. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this place. It's beautiful, too."
Denise M.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,30,58,1.0,10/17/2016,"I wanted to eat here for my anniversary dinner but they didn't have any notices that they would be closed. It says they are closed at 11pm but when we arrived they said they were closing after just seating people. They did not even give an explanation, oh wait they did. They said because they are not taking people.... there's going to be many people wasting their time coming here because they don't know it's not open. So thanks for wasting our gas, we don't just live a mile away there aren't that many cheesecake factories around."
