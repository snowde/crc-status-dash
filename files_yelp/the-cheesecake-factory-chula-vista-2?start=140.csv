Laura B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,2,5.0,11/18/2016,"I love coming to eat here! Their food is so delicious but their service could definitely step it up. Besides that, it's a good thing we have a CF, in south San Diego. I hated driving all the way to FV!"
Jeffrey C.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,133,5.0,4/22/2016,Been to this place 15 times and never had a problem like tonight... The floor underneath our table was so dirty i felt like leaving...  3 spoons 2 knives and all types of food on the floor... The table is was sticky and the bathroom was also dirty...  The food was still good.  Hope to never experience this again because i like the food and the atmosphere at this location...  Only one day was horrible here.
Rochelle B.,"San Diego, CA",103,21,27,5.0,2/6/2015,"I love eating here. The only downside is having to wait 15-20mins to be seated if you don't have any reservations. Luckily, they have the option of self service seating with their high round tables (if available) or seating at the bar. All the times I have came here I haven't had one bad experience with the Servers. Sometimes they may take awhile to come back to you but this place gets pretty busy so its definitely understandable.  I usually order the same thing every time i come here which is the Louisiana chicken pasta. This by far has to be my favorite pasta dish. The flavor is amazing. Has a little spice to it but not so overwhelming where you're not able to enjoy your food. Highly recommend this pasta. It comes with mushrooms, bell peppers and onions. I usually hold off the onions from my pasta.  Today, my date ordered a Kobe cheeseburger. Words cant even begin to describe how amazing this burger tasted. It was very succulent and tasteful and definitely tasted like one of the cleanest burgers you can find. I was amazed how at amazing this burger tasted.  Hope this review helps for those of you stuck on the menu not knowing where to start."
Silvia A.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,11,23,5.0,5/12/2016,"Just had dinner here with my boyfriend and it was a great experience. Our server/waiter was very nice and very attentive to us. He gave us recommendations, as we asked from food to desserts, to drinks.  I had the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta & my boyfriend had the Chicken Madeira entree.  The spicy chipotle chicken pasta was made with a delicious red sauce and the server added Parmesan cheese, it was not super spicy, it was mild to average spicy. Nothing to sweat about.  My boyfriends chicken Madeira was delicious as well! The sauce was a little on the sweeter side, but it complimented very well.  For dessert we had the Tuxedo Cheesecake and it was really good! Ofcourse it was sweet, but it was perfect, lots of chocolate flavor.   Overall it was a great experience for me. Food and dessert was yummy and our server was very kind. My boyfriend says otherwise, he says ""that place is too pricey for basic food"". Lol"

Paul S.,"Spring Valley, CA",127,414,2830,4.0,11/12/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place I go to on occasion. They have a menu (book) that is just huge. The menu is so big that there is something for everybody. From burgers to sandwiches to burritos to pasta to pizza to salads. Cheesecake Factory has you covered even for the real picky eaters. The place is usually packed with wait times of up to 15-20 minutes. Which isn't too bad. The key though is to go to the bar. If your lucky there is empty high table and bar stools. The bar is open seating. You don't have to put your name on the wait list. Just find an available high table or even sit at the bar. At the bar you can order anything off the menu. So that's what I did. While people were still waiting for a table. I just walked in. Sat at a high table at the bar. Got a beer and put in my order for food. Why wait to eat when you don't have to? I ordered the fried mac and cheese in a marinara sauce for my appetizer. It is so good. Crunchy on the outside and hot and cheesy in the inside. So addictive. Couldn't decide off hand on my main course but settled for the Kobe beef burger. Which I was glad I did. Having the burger cooked medium well with onions, mushrooms, melted swiss, tomato and lettuce. The burger wasn't complicated but just plain good. Washed it down with a pint of Karl Strauss Octoberfest. My meal was satisfying. The food was good. The service was friendly. The bill was a little high but not super crazy. I will be back."
Alex D.,"Bonita, CA",21,51,80,4.0,2/27/2016,"The cheesecake factory without the crowds like fashion valley. It's nice to get the same experience sans the fight for parking or the 30+ minute wait on a Friday night for a table for 4. Spent many a family lunch and dinner here when it first opened. The most recent visit the wifey and I rolled up at 5pm. No wait for a table for 4. The table location was a booth but we got neglected by our waitress for the first 25 minutes. I suspect we were the furthest table she took care of and it wasn't until she gave the table to another waitress that service improved. Complimentary bread was and still is amazing.  the white bread is sourdough - I think it's alright but never been a fan.  The dark wheat bread though - addicting. One of the few restaurants that does free bread so well. Especially when it's fresh baked and warm...yummy. Food is always delicious but a bit pricey. $11.50 for a plain hamburger and salad w/ balsamic dressing. That was off of their skinnylicious menu where all items were 590 calories or less. Lunch prices were in the same range with dinner hitting the $15-$25 range. I'll still be back occasionally. The bread and food is always solid but a bit pricey. Service is not perfect but still good, on other occasions it's been consistently better. If you want the cheesecake factory experience without the crowd I recommend coming down to the otay mall."
HidiNRachael S.,"San Diego, CA",22,10,7,1.0,3/6/2016,We ordered a piece of 30th anniversary cheesecake to go and got a salted caramel one instead. We called to complain at approximately 8pm and was told the manager couldn't get to the phone because they were too busy.  1 star for poor customer service.
Anne C.,"San Diego, CA",1421,593,4114,4.0,2/24/2014,"I've seen lower reviews on yelp for this location... We eat here every few months or so.. And I've never had an awful, low rating warranted experience here.  Located in Otay Ranch mall, great location... Large parking lot, shared with AMC theater.  Their food is typical with food at any other CF... Last night I ordered the Bellagio Chicken (breaded chicken breast over a basil pesto and pasta with prosciutto and arugula greens. The serving was huge and it tasted pretty good. I think I ruined my appetite with all the yummy warm bread they give us! The busy dinner crowd and customer service is consistent with any other CF as well. But our server was awesome and very accommodating to our little ones. She brought them out their own plate of sliced bananas and sliced bread to occupy them while waiting for our order... She also offered hot water in case I needed to heat a bottle... My kids had Mac&Cheese and mini corn dogs. OMG I stole a taste of their corn dog, and i was impressed! It was pretty good!  And of course you can't go wrong with their huge selection of cheesecakes and other cakes for dessert...  I love their food.. The quality and serving sizes are understandable for the prices of their food... But the cheesecakes to me are a little overpriced.. And is it just me, or did the slices they serve get smaller?!"
Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4064,27983,4.0,9/20/2014,"I stopped in this Cheesecake Factory to celebrate National Cheeseburger Day and ordered their Americana Burger with a side salad, and of course, I rounded my eating experience with a decadent Red Velvet slice of cheesecake.  The burger came with American and cheddar cheese, crunchy potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, tender grilled Onions, pickles and their house made secret sauce on sesame egg bun ( ). I asked them to prepare the meat at a medium or pink all the way through and they delivered nicely ( ). The beef was juicy, tender, and had a very good beefy flavor that lingered on the palate. I liked both cheeses on the burger because the American melted easily, but the cheddar held up well and stated firm and sharp, so I got best of both worlds. The potato crisp added great texture and salty element to the burger, and the secret sauce brought the burger together nicely ( ). I was quite fond of this burger and was happy I had it on National Cheese Burger Day. The side salad was fresh and crispy, and I ordered it with their balsamic vinaigrette which was very good. It was the perfect go between the rich burger and such. The red velvet cheesecake was bliss. My sever Mitra I believe her name was, which I will correct when I find my receipt, if I am wrong, recommended it as her personal favorite. The slice was beautifully layered with cheese cake filling, white chocolate, and of course red velvet cake ( ). It was very rich in a very good way, and the red velvet cake was moist and flavorful. I was impressed with the great flavor and creamy texture of the actual cheesecake ( ).  On the outside, there was some curled up white chocolate morsels that added nice texture but not much flavor ( ). I was hoping they had that sweet white chocolate flavor but they did not. Nevertheless, a nice slice of cheesecake. My server was great. She had a friendly personality and was well verse in the in and outs of the the menu, especially their abundant of cheesecake offerings."
Denise L.,"Oceanside, CA",19,4,,5.0,7/11/2016,The food and the service was excellent! I enjoyed the environment and the location. The restaurant was clean and well maintained! I would recommend this place to everyone!
Chris W.,"San Diego, CA",292,5,2,2.0,10/2/2015,"We ordered the steak dianne combo with shrimp and one is with chicken madeira which costs like $20.99 each. The steak tasted like it was frozen before it was cooked. We asked for the steak to be cooked medium but it came dry, chewy and more well done. Manager asked us for a replacement dinner but it will take too long since we waited long enough already. Waitress was nice, however, we were disappointed by the quality of food they served us."
Luis M.,"San Diego, CA",252,145,1033,4.0,9/24/2015,I have been to this location twice and in both occasions I had a great experience. I like coming for brunch because their menu is so delicious. This last time I ordered a plate of chilaquiles with carnitas. The green salsa is delicious and is not spicy at all. I also ordered a side of their French toast. They only thing that I would have to comment on the French toast is that I preferred them toasty and crunchy and the ones from cheese cake factory were soft. But that is just my preference. I have to now try them for lunch or dinner since their menu was huge with lots of options to choose from.
Leticia Z.,"National City, CA",1,20,,4.0,3/12/2016,"Last night we dine in there my daughter and I,  40 minutes wait, no problem maybe because of the rain, but we had a good time  Good service , didn't get what we asked for at the beginning because a misunderstand  but the manager took care of it wright away and brought us the wright dish."
Capitain M.,"Chula Vista, CA",10,26,3,2.0,10/1/2015,The food is pretty good. Pizza was kinda dry :/  We waited for a long time to be seated even though there was plenty of seats ava. Waiter took a long time to bring our drinks..... Food omg we where probably there for an hr before we got it. I ordered a burger had no ketchup ... I asked for ketchup he brought the ketchup like 20 mins later so i ate a cold burger..... And it was raw! Waiter was very rude!!!!
Roy M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,19,5,3.0,9/17/2015,"We've eaten in several Cheesecake Factory restaurants and it is an excellent franchise.  Unfortunately the Otay Ranch branch was very disappointing.   It was really quiet when we arrived but we still had to wait for ten minutes for a table and then another 50 minutes for our food to arrive.  The waitress Kaitlyn was charming, but the kitchen did not translate her order correctly and the wrong food was delivered.  In addition the food was poorly prepared.  Very disappointing...  The manager was apologetic and was kind enough to remove some items from the bill which was greatly appreciated.  We assume this was an isolated case and that the kitchen was understaffed today. Better luck next time?"
Vanessa R.,"Chula Vista, CA",69,24,149,2.0,1/19/2016,"Normally my experience is fabulous here, but tonight it wasn't. I went with my family to celebrate my fathers birthday. It started with us trying to order an appetizer but each choice we attempted(3) they were ""out of"", huh? Yes exactly how does that even happen in a huge restaurant like this. Then when we got our dinner, we got all but one entree and that was because they burned the grilled chicken, what! Yup that happened. We were all done with our meal by the time they brought the new grilled chicken plate, wow... Server was extremely apologetic and took the entree off the bill plus gave us a cheesecake slice for free. This experience was unfortunate but I will most likely be back because I do love this place. It was just one of those days I guess..."
Avori S.,"Bonita, CA",2,11,2,5.0,9/30/2016,I love coming here because of the low carb cheesecake and It's def a fav place to eat at after a long day of shopping lots of options!
Glenn C.,"Cincinnati, OH",887,887,858,3.0,6/30/2015,Super busy! Service was lacking. Ordered chicken madiera and steak diane combo. Waitress never came back to check on steak as i told her it might be too rare. Caesar salad was smaller as told and didnt have anchovies as stated.
Wana L.,"San Diego, CA",680,393,592,4.0,10/4/2013,"Call me Negative Nancy... But did you know each of their dishes, on average, are about 1,000 calories?!!? I know, some of you don't care. I only started to care since I've been trying to keep track of my calories on my fitness pal.  ANYWAY, they have a Skinnylicious Menu now!!! Thank God for that! Less calories and a bit more healthier options! If you count calories, you'll definitely love this menu. But, watch out for their complimentary wheat bread!!! (I could eat 10 loaves, no problem!)  Service is a hit or miss. If it's crowded and there's a long wait, try sitting in the bar area. It's open seating."
