Virginia S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",281,82,5,5.0,7/16/2016,"First time here and I was really impressed with the atmosphere, food and service. I will return."
Ed P.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,9,1,5.0,9/5/2016,"I'm a margarita drinker - we always upsacle to silver patron where ever we go. That said, the food  was 100% good the service always good even though it was very crowded. I go there a lot but never order my main drink. Last night had to send the drinks back (which are expensive) way too sweet and the presentation was terrible. I felt like I was drinking a slurpee. The straw was taller than the glass itself. I don't know who the bartender was but they need to serve good drinks and toss out that mix for the margaritas. It's terrible!"
Michael M.,"San Diego, CA",2,4,2,1.0,8/12/2016,"Came here for my uncles 30th bday and was shocked at how bad the environment was, how bad service was, and how bad the food was. Maybe my impression of the cheese cake factory was that it was a bit more upper scale but I guess I was wrong in that aspect. My bad. The noise and operations of the restaurant were so loud I had to yell to the person across the table from me just so they could hear. Most the time it just sounded like there were a bunch of dishes being cleared from tables and utensils falling on the floor.  We waited about 50 minutes to be seated which I was fine with. We didn't have reservations and it was prime time on Friday so I knew there would be a wait. The problem was that we were a group of 12 being served by 1 guy and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and an hour and a half to get our food. Maybe I'm missing something here and that's average time for this size crowd. But the guy couldn't even get the right food in front of the right people. Why even write it down if you're not going to review your notes.  I had high expectations for the food because everyone seems to make a big deal about it. My mistake again. I ordered the chicken bellagio because the ingredients were boss level. It took the hour and a half to come out like I had mentioned before and I was upset at that. When it came out, it looked good and smelled good but it was like licking the ocean floor because it was so salty. It was more salty than this review. Then the waiter reassured me that it would take another 10 minutes to bring out another one. It took nearly 30 minutes and my whole family was already done eating. I tasted the food to make sure it was not salty and BAM!!! Good news. It tasted great. But by that time I lost my appetite and had them put it in a box for me to eat later."
Harvey M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/4/2017,"So I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for years and never felt disappointed, but Friday night changed that. We waited 1 hour to be seated, but the worst part was the taste of the food. My sons spaghetti was dry, my dads shrimp was tough, my ahi didn't taste fresh and worst of all my wife's spicy chicken was burned. I don't know what to think now."
M H.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,41,4,4.0,1/22/2017,"We used curbside service for the first time and I think it was really convenient. I also really appreciated my server, Betty. She was very friendly and efficient and I could just see she was working to provide excellent service. The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because the food wasn't that great and it was pretty expensive. I ordered the mushroom appetizers and they were really yummy. We also ordered wings and they weren't so great. We also ordered a plain burger and it was ok. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things. But the service was great! Thank you Betty and also the nice gal on the phone!"

Kimiko S.,"University City, San Diego, CA",137,48,67,5.0,6/24/2016,"I have always loved eating here! My favorite dish is the Pasta Da Vinci! I'm not a meat eater, so I love ordering it with mushrooms only. And it is so delicious!!!"
Nicholle M.,"Chula Vista, CA",94,55,288,5.0,5/23/2015,Party of 14 .. Yikes huh!!! Well I'm impressed... We were all seated together and we only waited 15 minutes for our tables .. Phew!!!!

Alberto C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,5,3,1.0,7/19/2016,"Just walk out of the restaurant. The worst costumer service. Restaurant is half empty, got my table and no one has come to greet me; the waiter pass by and nothing. 10 minutes later just walked  out, very annoying. The staff needs to be re training, no sign of the manager on duty,the staff looked unhappy. So unprofessional of this location. The best location definitely seaport village and Fashion Valley. I guess the higher the volume the service is better. Shame on this because I love Cheesecake Factory and today this location let me down."
Dan G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/20/2017,"I ordered shrimp and chicken jambalaya with brown rice and gave me some kind a chicken with pasta sauce with brown rice, some little bit of white rice and 1 bow tie pasta and lastly there are no shrimp. This place or the cooks probably thinking some customers don't know the difference difference between shrimp/chicken jambalaya and pasta sauce. I guess they need to train their cooks."
Tim M.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,36,171,3.0,7/30/2016,Enjoy the food and love the cheese cake. However the service can be a little sketchy.
Rissa M.,"San Diego, CA",6,45,95,3.0,8/2/2015,"I've been lucky to get great servers in my past experiences at TCF, but last night, our waitress was horrible. I used to work in food service, so I cut servers a lot of slack and I make sure to tip well because I'll always remember how hard it was to be a waitress. But I also give 3 strikes for bad customer service and our waitress definitely hit 3 strikes.  Strike 1: She didn't bring the bread, we were so caught up in our conversations, we didn't realize until hunger hit that we weren't given any bread. It came after the appetizers and after we asked. Strike 2: She never refilled our waters. When we had 4 out of 6 empty glasses, we finally asked whoever was nearby. Strike 3: She never came by to check on us, which is probably why strikes 1 and 2 happened. We couldn't find her most of the time, and when she was within our area she'd visit nearby tables but couldn't be bothered to check in with us. When she was nearby, we tried to get her attention, but she must've forgotten the fact that she was our waitress because she wouldn't even look in our direction. Drinks needed refills, plates were stacking up, and we needed boxes and the bill. Luckily, two other waiters helped out (Chandler was one, but I didn't catch the other one's name). Otherwise, I would've asked for the manager. The food was delicious and the wait to get seated wasn't long, but the service was so bad I had to take off a couple stars."
Albalina B.,"National City, CA",24,9,20,5.0,7/5/2015,"I picked the perfect place for my birthday dinner! There was a bit of a wait, but the hostess was really nice and he was funny. We decided to sit outside where their was only minimal people. Our food took a bit long but the waitress checked up on us and made sure our drinks where always filled to the top! The food was delicious and will definitely come back!"
Shaina H.,"San Diego, CA",76,112,491,1.0,5/25/2015,"The service here is horrible. The waiters take forever to serve their customers and the ones walking around don't help out either. Water took quite a while to come out; however, the food came out in a timely manner. The waiters also take forever to come check on you nor do they refill water. I recommend that the manager who sees this review retrain the employees on customer service and efficiency particularly upon the first impression. Moreover, I had to ask for my check from another unoccupied employee for my check. Do not come here!!!"
Sylvy G.,"Chula Vista, CA",31,1,,1.0,10/21/2016,Tonight was one of the worst nights I've ever had there! First of all our wait time for a table of 3 was about 25 min when we were told 15 min. We finally sit down look at the menu to see that the menu has changed and they no longer had one of the super food salads that I always would order so I tried something new. My hubby ordered the jambalaya which is his usual meal that he loves from there. Well we waited about 45min to get our food with a few apologies in between for the wait and they had served me the wrong salad! I had to wait an extra 5 to 10 min for them to correct it also my hubby's order didn't taste nearly as good as it usually does so at this point we were very disappointed! Again with some more apologies and we're told there were some new chefs in the kitchen. To be honest we almost walked out without paying for anything but was told that the salad would be on the house since everything went completely wrong! I felt that the whole meal should of been on the house but what can I say.... This might be the last time we eat there!
Jeanene W.,"San Diego, CA",62,19,,3.0,6/22/2015,"The food is good, but they are SLOW. It has taken 1 HOUR to get our food all three times that I have gone. This last Sunday it took over 30 minutes for the kitchen to make enough coffee for everyone who ordered some. 30 minutes for coffee is just crazy, so I say 3 stars because the food is good, but this location is frustrating."
Samantha P.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,2,5.0,9/8/2016,"Took my family to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my mom's birthday. Aaron was our server. He accommodated us so well, even when a dish served was way too salty (pasta carbonara). On top of Aaron offering to replace the dish with another of my choice, the restaurant manager came out to our table to apologize for the saltiness in the carbonara. The bang bang chicken is amazing, and the dish came out (replacing the carbonara) within 10 minutes. Special thanks to Aaron for making my mom's birthday celebration an amazing dinner to remember. We will definitely be back again!"
Car K.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,30,1,3.0,11/27/2016,"I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for several years and have always been happy with every dish that I've ordered.  There food is spectacular and their cocktails are awesomeHowever, my family and I recently ordered 3 cheesecake slices for dessert and were VERY DISAPPOINTED with how small they have become!!  It doesn't pay to go cheap on the very thing that a restaurant is known for!!  The slices are half the size they used to be and they filled the plate with huge swirls of whipped cream to make the dessert look big! Disappointed!"
Desiree I.,"San Diego, CA",74,29,18,5.0,5/9/2016,Customer service with a smile  Great food  Service with a smile  Have been there twice within the last two weeks everything is delicious customer service is the best ! waitress ! waiters ! are the best ! hostess with the smile All I have to give  is five  Thank you
Bianca V.,"San Diego, CA",71,295,266,4.0,4/25/2016,"Eaten here a couple times, the food always comes out great. The avocado rolls are yummy. My favorite. I like that it's in the mall area it is a pricey place to eat if your just gonna order some spaghetti and pasta u might as well just make it at home loll. The pasta isn't a ""oh my god so good"" so save your money loll. The cheesecake is super exspensive I bought 2 for almost $60 :O"
