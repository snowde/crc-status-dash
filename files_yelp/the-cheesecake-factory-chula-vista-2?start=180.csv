Zaven A.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,25,27,5.0,6/7/2016,"A nice family restaurant that serves  big portions on  jumbo plates, the food is good and they have a big selection to choose from, the cake is very rich, don't go on weekends if you are very hungry ,expect long wait."
Rashi V.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,3.0,6/4/2016,Good customer service. Cheesecake locations will never be my first destination of choice but generally one will not be disappointed or extremely elated at what you get there. This location is not as chaotic as the one in Fashion valley. For some reason they removed the shrimp jambalaya from their menu which was my favorite. Overall good food with reasonable cost.
Dr Raad A.,"Jamul, CA",0,9,5,1.0,11/13/2016,"Food came out 45 mints late  , very disappointed they didn't even offer a free cheesecake cheap corporate,,,"
Chris Z.,"El Cajon, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/14/2016,"I contacted Cheesecake Factory after this happened, and they decided not to reply. So now this review is going on yelp. My wife and I went to this Cheesecake Factory for her birthday.  Some of the employees were completely crude and unprofessional.  One employee was talking to his friend at the table next to us (The one seated at the table was in plain clothe but knew several of the employees) and was talking about a female in the restaurant and how he ""wanted to eat that so bad"".  He was specifically talking about a woman, and not food.  Another employee walked by the table, said ""F*ck You"" to his friend, laughed, and walked off.  I was really disappointed Cheesecake Factory.  It is pretty bad when IHOP has better trained and more professional employees than you do.  So not only do they have unprofessional employees, they also do not reply back when notified of such incidents."
Arturo M.,"National City, CA",1,22,5,2.0,12/12/2016,The service is terrible I go here all the time the only reason why I'm giving them a two star review because the manager was really nice but the people there are rude and take forever to bring your food wouldn't  Come here again after all the trouble you would think they would at least give you a discount on the food they didn't she offered me a cheesecake it's what ever wouldn't come back at this location even though I live down the street I rather go to the one in down I enjoy my food with out frustration !!!!!!!
Chris H.,"San Diego, CA",214,194,93,5.0,12/30/2014,"Really a very pleasant surprise here today; we were here for a birthday lunch for my son. Although the restaurant was quite busy when we arrived, we were greeted immediately and courteously.  After a short few minutes, we were seated and greeted by server Tasha. Throughout the lunch she was quick, caring and very knowledgable with the menu. We ordered Factory Nachos with Chicken, Meatloaf, Lemon and Herb Roasted Chicken and some burgers. The Factory Nachos were CRISP and delicious,  with plenty of roasted chicken and cheeeeeeeeese! The chicken and meatloaf were served piping hot and we're very well presented- Obviously the work of a well trained kitchen. Overall, this location is head and shoulders above Mission Valley and Seaport. The check was STILL under $100 for 5 with two glasses of wine and a couple of soft drinks, so that worked out as well. Management- Please recognize Tasha and her high standards and professionalism. We'll be back soon!"
Holland B.,"Alpine, CA",83,48,10,5.0,6/4/2016,"One of my favorite places for date night with my boyfriend. The food is good. We usually order some appetizers like spinach & artichoke dip and cheesy garlic bread. I usually always order some kind of good pasta and he usually gets some type of burger or pasta. His favorite cheesecake is the carrot cake one while mine is the anniversary cheesecake. The service is good, and the restaurant is always busy. We will be back again soon."
Angela A.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",314,522,777,5.0,12/2/2011,"I love coming to Otay Ranch because it is a dog friendly mall.  I never chose the Cheesecake Factory for two reasons, their extremely fattening menu and their no dog policy on the patio.   I am THRILLED to tell you that both of these negatives have changed.  First and most important to ME, is that doggies of all sizes are allowed on the patio.  The staff are wonderful about having them there too.  The second bit of news (probably more important to most of you) is that they now have a Skinnylicious menu!!!  OH BABY BABY.  The wonderful offerings of their expansive kitchen, but with less calories.  They have really made an effort to have something for everyone.  The ingredients and the calories are listed carefully and there are many to choose from.  They have become very knowledgeable and will help you pick something to fit your diet. What did I have?  I had their Wild Mushroom Flat bread only 440 calories and oh so tasty.  The flat bread was crunchy, there was plenty of gooey cheese and large slices of mushrooms.  The flavors blended perfectly.  I also had the White Bean Hummus, this was absolutely delicious (I didn't check the calories).  I don't believe this came from the Skinny menu, but I was with a Vegetarian and this was a great starter for us.  my Veggie daughter ordered a grilled eggplant sandwich and LOVED it.  My french bulldog just loved sleeping on the warm concrete in the sun, it was a cool day and this helped her warm up."
Katie H.,"San Diego, CA",100,96,37,2.0,2/22/2016,"The food was good, NOT great, NOT amazing, but good. The order wasn't right though, it took over a hour and a half to get our food, and it didn't come out all at once. My appetizer salad came out after entrées did and me entrée came even later. Half our party got their food and was nearly finished when the other half was still waiting. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. The table we were seated at had food and silverware under it and a used straw on top of it. We asked for 3 highchairs and got 2. We had called ahead to verify they could accommodate our size of party and then are told when we get there that they don't have a big enough table. WTF?!? Stephanie, who claimed to be a manager is pathetic. She tried to avoid us at every turn when we couldn't find our server, when our bill was wrong, and when 3 other tables in our section complained about service."
Steven S.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,,5.0,5/7/2016,"Today we came here for Mother's Day meal as we always go on a Sat to avoid the massive crowd on Sun. Everything went great from seating to our food. Our waitress Janina was great, very pleasant and took good care of us. I had the spicy cashew chicken for first time and it was delicious. We were all happy with our food and the lemon meringue cheesecake and salted caramel cheesecake were over the top good."
William H.,"San Diego, CA",2,29,,4.0,8/23/2015,"Overall good experience during my most recent visit. Went on a Sunday afternoon withy wife before the dinner rush so we were able to get a seat right away. Only problem I had with that was there were plenty of seats and the host just had to seat us directly next to another couple in the dining room... So my wife and I had about 20 minutes of awkward conversation until they finished and left. I'd have preferred some socially acceptable space so I didn't feel like I was eavesdropping on their conversation, or them on mine. Just weird and unappreciated. Food was good as usual though. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal; one minor thing I noticed, they did get a little cheap with the dipping sauces for our appetizer. We split an order of the buffalo meatballs, with there was hardly any sauce with it. Is dipping sauce really that expensive that they cut back on that now? Jeez! Anyway, my wife had the Chicken Madeira and I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. Both meals were very satisfying. And since it also happened to be my birthday, we also ordered dessert. I had vanilla cheesecake, my wife had lemon meringue cheesecake. Both were very good, after all it better be for their name sake! The only other feedback I have is the service could have been a little more attentive. I only had my drink refilled once and would have liked a third glass of coke zero but the server dropped off & retrieved the check without asking/noticing. I guess it was a good meal so I wasn't too disappointed. These are just some things that separate the good from the great."
Linda H.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,69,40,5.0,6/20/2015,"Food was great as usual!   Jennifer was attentive, yet not too intrusive.  Love it!!!!  Chicken Bellagio is the best."
Aziz A.,"San Diego, CA",1,16,,5.0,10/16/2016,"Very professional, good customer service, our food was late a little bit, the supervisor came 3 times to apologize."
Michelle M.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,25,6,5.0,9/28/2016,"Love the happy hour menu and our waitress,Deanna provided the best customer service. She was very friendly and accommodating even though we couldn't stay due to us having to pick up the kids. She made sure we had utensils and ranch dressing and everything! I hope management sees this and acknowledges her hard work. :)"
Ewa B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/8/2016,"Curb Side pick up is terrible. Called in my order and I was told 25 mins and food will be ready. I arrive 35 minutes later to allow for the Mothers Day brunch rush and call the Curbside number. ""We'll be right out"", they say. 15 minutes later no one comes out, so I go in. During the review of my order, 2 of the dishes were done wrong, they put in the order correctly but the kitchen made the mistakes. I should have just got a table when I arrived to pick up the food at least it would have been warm. This is the second time I've had an issue with CurbSide service. The other time was on a weekday at 5 pm."
Jay B.,"Irvine, CA",33,19,11,4.0,10/2/2015,"We have been to the Cheesecake Factory in both Waikiki and Las Vegas and they do not have happy hour, so this was a nice surprise!The food was good, we loved the Thai wraps, the buffalo chicken fried wraps were good, huge quantity, but quite filling due to them being deep fried I believe. We also had the crab and artichoke dip, which we weren't very fond of. It was very fishy tasting and we wished we had chosen the spinach dip instead. Drinks were good and everything was a great price! We were so full we couldn't even enjoy desert sadly. :( They all looked delicious!"
Katie F.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,16,,5.0,5/4/2016,"I know this is a chain restaurant but I simply love this Cheesecake Factory. The service is always fantastic and courteous. The lunch menu and skinny menu are amazing. My favorite dish is the DaVinci pasta, it is not skinny but it is delicious. I also have to leave room for cheesecake :). My husband and I never have to wait long for a table and if there is a wait, guess what, we shop :). Love CCF CV!"
Ryan S.,"Escondido, CA",1,129,25,2.0,11/10/2015,The silverware at our table was just flat out gross. Crust on the spoon from someone else's meal. Barely washed other utencils. Gross. I told the waitress and she paused for a few seconds before she snatched them up and came back with new ones not much cleaner. Not apologetic at all more like we inconvenienced her (April) with more work. Our food took 33 mins from when we ordered til it was delivered. Seemed long  considering they weren't busy. I prefer the fashion valley location and most likely won't be returning to this one.
Frankie M.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,319,133,4.0,3/23/2015,"Every time I've gone here which has been many, the service and food have been great. Usually get the Ahi tuna salad which is pretty tasty. To finish it off usually go for a piece of the original cheesecake. A plus is there open pretty late."
Ismena C.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,8,5.0,11/3/2014,Love this place and that it's Kids friendly.  We enjoy the the house salad and chiken pasta. Desert was great.
