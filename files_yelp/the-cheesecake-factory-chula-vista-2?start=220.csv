Anna S.,"Chula Vista, CA",9,10,22,4.0,10/22/2015,My first experience ever at the Cheesecake Factory was pleasant. I enjoy the fact that the portions are pretty decent. It is enough to make you full and have plenty left over for lunch the next day. I guess the good thing about it being in the Eastlake area is parking isn't too bad and it isn't as packed as the one in Fashion Valley. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very polite and attentive. If your bringing your significant other the lighting really sets the mood haha  I got the Mac n Cheese balls and jambalaya pasta. It was super delicious. The Mac n Cheese balls had the right amount of crisp. The jambalaya pasta was pretty darn good. I was kind of curious how they would pull that off but it had a nice kick to it. Their cookie dough cheesecake was heaven in my mouth! Savory goodness! I think it pretty much summed up my dinner that night. Overall I'd come back for sure. It is a little pricey but the food makes up for it. Stay hungry my friends...
Daniel B.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,22,,5.0,3/21/2016,"I waited for about 30 minutes last Friday, but i was really hungry and craving all sort of delicious and exquisite pastries and desserts."
Jenna H.,"Chula Vista, CA",818,295,1232,4.0,6/9/2014,"Used to go eat at cheesecake twice a week with my main girls since high school until I met my man. Since he's a body builder, I got into his lifestyle and eating habits. Been with him for almost two years, and have never been here with him ever since we got together. He calls it the fat people restaurant. That's why. Anyways, I've been craving and wanting my fav dish from here for the longest time & he finally decided to come here. I ordered strawberry lemonade, fried calimari, pasta carbonara. He got some grilled chicken dish. Bread wasn't warm at all, I was disappointed but I still liked it. The rest of my food tasted amazing :) as the usual BUT!  In my lemonade (3rd refill), there was a black plastic strip in it. What if I accidentally slurped it like a boba? Not a pretty sight.. Called the manager after we left (no drama) so they can be more cautious. Plus, I hate complaining and causing a scene.    Still love the place, gonna come back when my sis comes back from nyu."
June C.,"San Diego, CA",15,74,575,3.0,6/30/2014,"3.5 I've come here a few times. The food is always great as well as the servers. The portions are large and we end up eating about half before taking the rest home. Drinks: Recommend. Forgo the usual soda and try their lemonades. The strawberry and raspberry flavors are delish. Desserts: Skip. The last time we had room for dessert and got the red velvet and 30th anniversary cheesecakes. I wasn't impressed. The cheesecake was in between slices of cakes (red velvet and chocolate respectively), but the cheesecake part was too whipped and even too salty for me and may have resulted in less cheesecake flavor. The side of whipped cream (from can) was tastier than the cake. Overall presentation was nice."
Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,5.0,6/18/2014,"Yes, this is your typical Cheesecake Factory. One that makes mistakes, and can sometimes bring your food out cold. However, their service is superior to all the other Cheesecake Factory's I have been to. We came here on Father's Day with a party of five. It seemed fairly busy, but we were seated at the time that was quoted. That's always a plus! After being seated we were waited on by Davon H. He was outstanding! He brought all of our drinks promptly, and even brought out all of my annoying requests quickly. They were out of sourdough bread at the time we arrived, so he kept following up and remembered to actually bring it after it was freshly baked. That almost never happens at a Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual Tomato Basil Pasta and loved it of course. My friend got the Fish and Chips and unfortunately the portion was skimpy and very cold. They tasted like they were sitting under the heat lamp for too long. I'm not sure how Davon took notice that he wasn't satisfied, but he quicky came over to ask what he thought. When he saw that my friend wasn't happy, he offered to replace the meal with no hesitation, brought his manager to recover the situation and even offered a soup or salad while he waited for his meal to come out. The new portion was much better...and actually hot. My other friend got the Chicken Bellagio and loved it! Their fettucine was just ok, and their Ribeye meal had no complaints all around. For dessert I splurged and got a slice of Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. It was stuffed with fudge, PB, and even Butterfinger goodness. The slice was skimpy like most Cheesecake locations and there was a large portion of the cheesecake that didn't have any filling which kind of sucked. Their Pineapple Upside Down cheesecake was delicious like always and their Macadamia Nut one was deeeeelish as well! Food is like any other Cheesecake location in all honesty, but service is the by far the best of all locations I have visited!"
Ciara G.,"Chicago, IL",19,26,18,5.0,12/14/2015,My husband and I come here almost every weekend and no matter who is serving us they are courteous and pleasant. I've tried a few things on the menu and I can't decide what I like best honestly! The pastas are creamy with just the right amount of seasoning and the sandwiches are flavorful without being overbearing. Of course their cheesecakes are to die for as well.. we will definitely continue to come here!
Erik G.,"San Diego, CA",877,500,1895,4.0,4/3/2013,"I know this isn't really a foodie's paradise, but I do like it here for it's novelty.  You know, the over-sized portions, the massive menu, the sweet dark oat bread with butter before your meal, and the strawberry lemonade.  Oh yeah, the cheesecake too (if you save room).  I prefer the carrot cake (not the cheesecake version).   For lunch I like the lunch portion Miso Salmon with the cream sauce on the side.  This location is one of the best with regard to minimal wait times.  I bring clients here for lunch during the week and there is never a wait time.   I can't speak for it during weekends, but weekdays are virtually no lines (compared to the Fashion Valley location)."
Melanie G.,"San Diego, CA",126,163,259,2.0,7/24/2013,"Good for large groups, but ONLY for casual occasions. Nothing special. So it's perfect for work functions. I'm docking one star because recently their dish preparations have just been inconsistent, and the crazy thing is on multiple occasions the manager or waiter just acted like they didn't  know what I was talking about. A co-worker and I always used to get the Luau salad. It was always delicious, until it wasn't. Can't pinpoint exactly what's different. Our guess is there's less of the good greens and more iceberg. Plus they don't glaze the wonton skins anymore. Then on the light menu, the balsamic chicken with farro used to come with at least 2T of farro, and then the last time it was like 4 little grains! And the manager came over and tried to say that's how much they usually put. He seriously tried to come over and point at those 4 little pieces and say there's the farro. Despite this, it's still a tasty dish. What I do like is the miso salmon. No complaints.  What to stay away from: Luau salad Anything with ahi tuna"
Kara T.,"Chula Vista, CA",69,18,,1.0,5/15/2015,"Worst service EVER! I walked into The Cheesecake Factory today at about 4:30 with my two children. There wasn't anyone waiting in the lobby and when the host team asked me how many in my party I said ""three and may we please sit at the tables in the happy hour area."" They directed me to seat myself and I walked over and waited at a 4 top table that needed to be cleaned. Finally after about 10+ minutes, I walked back up to the host station and asked if they could have someone come clean the table so we could sit. The male host said with an attitude ""Miss (which is incorrect--I am a ma'am) these people just came in and I am going to sit them there."" I then replied, ""I've been waiting here for over 15 minutes now for the table to be bused as per your instruction."" He said ""no miss...you requested to sit at the bar not at a table."" I then said, ""no, I requested to sit in the happy hour area at a table. I have two elementary aged children--I wouldn't ever sit at the bar!"" He replied very rudely and in an aggressive tone, (and when I mean aggressive...he stood up taller--which he was about 1 foot taller than me, tightened up every muscle in his face, took a step towards me, glared down at me while answering me in a scolding tone) ""No you requested to sit at the bar and now if you want to sit at a table, you are going to have to wait until everyone has been seated. And, as you can see, there is now a wait."" I turned to my kids who looked so confused and said ""Let's go."" My 9 year old son said ""why was he so mean to us? Why didn't he let us sit. He told us to go sit at the table and he pointed to the table when we walked in."" I just walked out and said ""we will find somewhere else to eat."" I work full time with a 2 hour commute with my children in tow. I am tired and frankly wanted to beat the Friday night rush, eat out and enjoy a nice early dinner with my 2 kids (since my husband has to work late). My money is accepted everywhere else...so I guess we will support some other establishment. We eat out a lot and I will not be going to Cheesecake Factory for a long time...not that they need my business...they are always busy. This was so disappointing since we eat here often, several times per month between the Fashion Valley and Otay Ranch Town Center locations.  I guess this will force me to try other places to eat and perhaps find a new favorite."
Mike S.,"Chula Vista, CA",19,13,,1.0,8/22/2016,Went to cheesecake factory the other day and I ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad. They took a long time to bring my plate while everyone else got theirs. Come to find out they made the wrong salad in the kitchen and they had to make it all over again. When they brought out my salad it was missing the grilled chicken on the salad. I didn't want to return it and wait longer. My niece and nephew ordered a Cesar salad and it was missing croutons. It seemed that the kitchen just wanted to get tickets filled and not worry about standards. They did comp my meal but they still need to make food according to the menu and restaurant standards.
Rocco S.,"Newport News, VA",15,38,1,5.0,12/28/2014,"All the years I've been going and the many times and different ones I've been to , I am never disappointed.  The food is always great, customer service is friendly and fast. Need I say more Sure the cheesecake is very good. I think they are scaling the size if the portions of the cheesecake but let's not split hairs."
Renard R.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/11/2015,"Jessica, a waitress here who is very rude. I asked her a question, and she looked at me if I was stupid and ignored me. This is the second strike at this otay ranch location & This will be the last. Keep in mind I've been sitting at my table for 13 minutes, and not one person greeted us & not one person asked what we would like to drink & not one person even simply brought us bread that's already in a basket... It's the first part of the experience which makes the whole experience matter... The whole experience is dammed now, & no one will ever be receiving a tip Here again, unless it's the filipino waitress who is usually here on weekends, & when it's busy."
Lauren G.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",2,14,10,5.0,8/27/2015,I love this Cheesecake Factory! The services is always quick and everyone is very friendly. I love coming here for lunch and getting the delish soup and salad special. I also love the Pinapple Moscaw Mules from this bar. I would highly recommend this location to anyone.
Marisol O.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,1,2.0,1/26/2016,"Ordered the shrimp bistro and as I am eating I see a hair in my pasta. I call the manager, he changed my order ( obviously), apologized profusely about the incident and gave my mom and I a free cheesecake ( which I am thankful for) none the less the hair made my appetite go away, so I ended up eating very little. Didn't  really savor my meal as you can imagine."
Cheryl B.,"San Diego, CA",1,7,,1.0,11/16/2014,"Usually I would have given a higher rating but I ordered the Shrimp scampi & Steak Diane combo since I had it before and it was so good, but this time the steak was over cooked I ordered medium rare, send steak back & it came back in less 2 minutes. Also the shrimp scampi was breaded instead of cooked with wine & garlic! Perhaps there must be new cooks?!! I recd a response from the manager at the Chula Vista restaurant, at first he didn't know about the letter...after I explain my dinner experience he said if we came back to call him so he can comp my husband's Fish & Chips dinner...I doubt if we would go back to Cheesecake Factory"
Sherry W.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,14,4,5.0,6/3/2014,"I have been here several times and have always had grewt service and food-LOVE their happy hour nachos and Long Island Iced Tea! Tonight we went to the farmers market with our dog Bailey like we always do, and then planned on eating at another restaurant in the mall. We always eat on the patio with our pooch, as this mall bills itself as ""dog friendly"". We have had lots of great lunches/dinners on the patio, and the staff has always been super nice. We were turned away from the restaraunt we originally intended to dine at-""NO DOGS"" on the patio (no sign, they just told us) Went straight to Cheesecake Factory where they welcomed us and our dog as well as another group with their dog. They even brought them water in a take out container! Another great dinner (chicken piccata) and of course, yummy cheesecake!"
Winston S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",93,447,89,5.0,6/4/2012,"I was in Chula Vista 2 weeks ago, visiting a friend and stopped by to pick up 2 slices of cheesecake to go.  First of all, Otay Ranch is a really cool mall.  I like the lay out and architecture of the buildings.  Looks new and well maintained. We got pina colada cheesecake and strawberry cheesecake.  The prices are steep, but the quality is great.  The staff were friendly and I will come back when I am in the area."
B. Ellen I.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,4,1.0,4/17/2015,"We came to this restaurant Thursday April 16th about 7:45pm. We walked in just ahead of a large party. We approached the host at the front (young Hispanic guy with a bow-tie) and were told a 15-20 min wait. He offered for us to sit immediately at the bar, but I hate bar benches and wanted to relax. We were given a buzzer and since it was crowded in the lobby, we sat ourselves outside on the bench. As we are leaving, I hear, ""we have a party of 6"" from the group after us. My husband sat on the bench with the buzzer directly next to him on the wooden seat and I got up to look at the menu. There is an open patio with approx 4-7 people in it with 2 different waiters attending to them. 10-min goes by...we are now sitting together on the bench talking, the buzzer directly between us on the wooden bench...15-min goes by...we are playing Candy Crush and Bookworm, respectively. I happen to glance up and there is a couple who is entering, the man with a walker...they go in and come directly out and sit...20-min goes by, I look up and I don't see anyone in the lobby so I get up to check and it's empty. I call my husband over and we go inside. We wait...I tell my husband, ""the party of 6 that came after us is already seated""...He goes up to the counter and talks to the same young, Hispanic guy with the bow-tie. My husband asks about our table. The bow-tie guy tells him, it's going to be 15 min. My husband says, we've been waiting for 20 min. The bow-tie guy tells him, ""it's only been about 4 minutes"". My husband says, ""no, we've been waiting for 20 min...here's our buzzer..it never went off"". The guy looks at it and immediately says, ""we rang it for 5 min and no one answered"".  He then said that he would put us at the top of the list. I'm watching this all transpire from the back of the lobby and my husband then tells me what went on. Since we still have to wait, I tell my husband ""forget it!"" As he walks up to tell the host we aren't going to wait, the couple with the walker is being escorted back to their table. When I was walking out of the door, my husband was giving the buzzer back and all the guy said was ""are you sure?""...SMH. I find this unacceptable. He basically lied and was in-turn, saying we were liars. I will SWEAR under OATH that the buzzer never went off (I mean, have you ever had a buzzer ANYWHERE that DID NOT keep buzzing and buzzing and was lit-up until it got your attention?!?! Besides, it was on a wooden bench...which would have amplified the buzzing to pure annoyance!). His response shouldn't have been that he had done his job and it was OUR FAULT we didn't hear the buzzer!!! He should have called to have us seated IMMEDIATELY! Anyhow, I was so fumed I told my husband there was no way that I could eat there being so upset. So we went to P.F. Changs. MUCH better service and they even comped us an entree when the server mis-ordered our order! Now THAT'S what I call SERVICE!"
Cassie P.,"Barrio Logan, San Diego, CA",10,74,21,4.0,8/15/2015,Usually you can get a pretty decent meal here.... Mostly I have had salads which are quite good. Of course the cheesecake is delicious!  I tend to take it home since I'm full from dinner but can't leave without cheesecake! Love the tuxedo cheesecake but it's really rich!
Sirena P.,"San Diego, CA",10,7,,2.0,6/1/2016,"We almost always have a great time and a good meal when we come to this location of The Cheesecake Factory. Sometimes the service is slow, but we don't mind. However, today was not one of those better times. While the service was professional and efficient, my Chicken Madeira came out under cooked - chewy and the texture was all wrong. After I realized this I stopped eating the chicken (I had already consumed the first piece, which was fine), and informed our server. The manager came by and said sorry, offered another Chicken Madeira (no thanks, I'm getting some cheesecake). Mostly, I wanted them to know they undercooked the chicken so they can do a better job so no one got sick. It would have been nice to have been discounted on the Madeira, or comped a cheesecake (we ordered two).  I paid full price for everything.  I wouldn't be so down about it, but turns out I now have food poisoning, and that sucks."
