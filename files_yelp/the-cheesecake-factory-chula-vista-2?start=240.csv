Neal A.,"San Diego, CA",159,62,6,2.0,3/29/2014,"I have certain expectations when I go to a large chain restaurant such as Cheesecake.  I expect it to be well run, and I expect employes to be trained and know how to service the customer.  When you walk into a nearly empty restaurant and the hostesses appear to have absolutely no clue what to do with you, where to seat you, when to seat you...its a bit frustrating to say the least.  I am not writing this based on one experience, this is easily over the span of 5 -7 experiences, and I simply told my wife that I can no longer take the absolute horrible experience the second I step foot through those doors.  She now knows to not even ask to go to this location because even the thought of stepping foot in there annoys me.   All that said, the service at the table is fine, nothing special, and have had better at other locations. The food is what I usually write about, but if I cant get to the damn table to eat, than how can I write about the food, think about it.  Its consistent, and on par with most locations of cheesecake.   I just cant get past the first impression at this location, it has forever ruined my dining experience here.   Support local business San Diego, they need us and we need them!!"
Melissa B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",197,253,92,5.0,8/1/2015,"Joseph was our server and he was super friendly and helpful. We were seated within ten minutes and the food came out fast. The pina colada was excellent, Joseph recommended the miso salmon which was wonderful, the stuffed mushrooms were delicious, and the BBQ salad was great. I usually have to add dressing to he salad but it was made perfect. We had a great experience and I would definitely come back here again."
Annette T.,"Chula Vista, CA",43,8,,5.0,12/26/2015,"Wonderful happy hour, love the mojitos! the bartenders are always friendly and attentive, we come here weekly!"
Myrj B.,"San Diego, CA",268,2,5,4.0,9/9/2015,"Food is great, but pretty expensive. For me, at least haha. I recommend the ahi tartare - it's my absolute fave appetizer!!! Don't get it if you don't like raw fish though. The only other thing I've gotten is the Steak Diane plus the Herb Crusted Salmon for around $21. I think the only thing I highly dislike about this location is that the signal SUCKS haha. Actually, the signal where I am now is fine. So I guess it depends on where you're seated inside :p"
Lany H.,"Chula Vista, CA",46,51,1,2.0,4/23/2014,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times before. I think the only promising thing about it to me is the Happy Hour from 4-6. $5 appetizers/select mixed drinks & $3 select beers. Make sure if you go, you double check your receipt because if it's 6:01, by the time you order something it's getting marked at full price. I've been during non-happy hour times and the cooking is just as mediocre. I got some fried mac n cheese that was still cold in the middle. The Fettucini Alfredo I ordered tasted like preservatives. The cheesecake is shipped in from somewhere and kept in a freezer somewhere until they thaw the slices and serve em up. It's good if you live in Chula Vista and can't drive anywhere.  I used to think this was an OK place to be taken on a date but the food is just not up to par anymore. The shortcuts are costing them good regular customers."
Ron C.,"Spring Valley, CA",31,6,,1.0,12/28/2016,"I took the family to this Cheesecake Factory and was highly disappointed. Service was slow, and my meal was less than satisfactory. I ordered the Chicken Marsala, it cam with bow tie pasta that was hard, almost crunchy. The waitress was almost non-existent  though polite, so I just ate the chicken. When the waitress finally returned I told her of my disappointment and she said she would speak to the manager. I requested a glass of water and after 15 minutes I had to remind her I was still waiting on water. By this time I had noticed that other people that had arrived after us had been seated, had finished and had left while we still waited.  Not once had I seen or spoken to a manager. We decided that we would forgo singing happy Birthday to my daughter and just get desert to go. After spending spending over $200 and over 2 hours for a mediocre meal I am somewhat disappointed, However the waitress gave me my to go slice of cheesecake for my trouble for free which comes out to about a 3% discount on my total bill. I just expected more from a huge restaurant chain."
Cece A.,"San Diego, CA",114,188,339,5.0,7/6/2014,Service was great as usual. Today we ate calamari for starters. My server was nice enough to water down my strawberry lemonade as it is to sweet for me.  I had bistro shrimp pasta and my mom had fettucine Alfredo with shrimp.   My mother decided to order 3 cheesecakes. Mango. Blueberry and red velvet. Service was great. Food was great.
Marden M.,"San Diego, CA",169,23,64,5.0,3/27/2014,"I'm always taking a long time to order because of the great selection of food on the menu. So far everything I've tried has been very good. My favorite appetizer is fried calamari with this new garlic dipping sauce. I don't know if it's new but it was my first to try and it was awesome. Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta and the shrimp angel hair were also good dishes. However, my latest try which I recommend over the other 2 dishes is the Cajun jambalaya pasta. This dish is packed with flavor and the chicken they put in it was a deliciously tender.  If you're a meat person like me the rib eye was a really juicy flavorful dish as well. I've been to a few cheese cake factorys in SD and LA but the one in Otay really had tremendous customer service. Great job!"
Shannon D.,"Campo, CA",74,2,1,5.0,9/12/2015,From a restaurant owner... This place is a serious operation.... Until you have been in their shoes STFU and eat the good food... Haters hate...
Bernardo D.,"Chula Vista, CA",26,125,1478,5.0,5/20/2014,Enjoyed the late night at Cheesecake Factory in Otay Valley.  Thanks for being open until 11pm :-D..  great service from Monique here.  Always checking up on us to make sure all was well.
Elo B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,81,3,4.0,5/7/2016,"I feel like this is one of those places you go with a group and no one can decide on 1 spot. The menu is huge and I am always pleased with what I get. Chicken salad sandwich is one of my faves, their salads are delicious, small platters are often big enough for a meal...service is quick and they always have plenty of staff. Managers walk the floor often to make sure things are going well which is nice...I never have room for cheesecake but I've had them for celebrations and they're very decadent"
Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",165,1240,162,4.0,4/26/2012,"I like Cheesecake Factory.  I feel bad for myself trying to be a good foodie but also liking this chain.  This is the only chain I am always on board with going.  Even if the wait is ALWAYS over an hour.  Why is that?? So anyway, I went here when I was in SD to surprise a good friend for her baby shower! We met her and her family there for the big surprise reveal.  It was amazing.  Then we waited for over an hour for a table and that was less amazing.   I really like that they have the diet friendly section.  I also appreciate that they give the calorie counts although I am sure that has some flex in the kitchen.   The food really does come out quickly once you are seated so that's good.  And the drinks are strong, also a plus. Parking near here is just SUCH a pain.  This Cheesecake Factory is in a huge mall complex and you end up parking so far away.  I have been here twice really (apparently the friend I was visiting ALSO likes CF) and both times parking was annoying.  So leave extra time to find a spot."
Beth G.,"La Mesa, CA",0,10,2,1.0,9/28/2014,"Visited the Otay Ranch location today for lunch. Two of us with no kids seated in a round dining area full of kids. Thanks hostess. Then the wait for any service was beyond long. The restaurant wasn't that busy. Most people were home watching football. Needless to say the service was lousy. What is it with these restaurants? Where are the wait staff that actually earn their tips?  Not here and not at many restaurants I've been to lately. The Factory is overrated and not worth the money.  We had salads that were mediocre at best. We waited for bread, then drinks, then our food but the check came quickly. We were never offered water and had to ask for the bread. I'll never eat there or any of the Cheesecake factories again."
Muna J.,"Nashville, TN",0,3,,5.0,11/5/2015,"The prices can run 10-20 dollars but it is worth it. I would suggest going during lunch hours. They have pretty good lunch specials and the lunch portions are still pretty normal or big. Once, I did take food home after getting a lunch special, it depends on how hungry you are. Be sure to save room for dessert because you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and NOT get cheesecake, btw, their carrot cake is pretty good too. My favorite cheesecake is the fresh strawberry."
Jade D.,"Fredericton, Canada",3,79,29,2.0,6/15/2014,I normally would have nothing but good things to say about Cheesecake Factory but they've really dropped the ball the last 2 times I've ordered from them.  Both times I ordered on a holiday (mothers day and Father's Day) and ended up with half assed dishes with missing sauces or ingredients.  I've also noticed from experience that presentation greatly suffers when you order take out.  Make sure if your ordering out that you open and check all your dishes to make sure everything looks right. It's a pain in the ass and you shouldn't have to but its less aggravating then getting home and realizing that they messed up.  I don't think I'll be coming back for a while.
Dill B.,"Santee, CA",0,6,2,1.0,8/1/2015,"Cheesecake Factory? More like hell factory. Waitress cares more about tips than the customers, kept putting chicken on our pasta and I AM A VEGETARIAN:( I was almost in tears when I saw poor chicken little on the plate in front of me. That's what's wrong with this damn country, so many poor animals dying for nothing in the food industry. MEAT IS MURDER !! WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!! Didn't serve milk, didn't serve grilled cheese, messed up our order twice.  If I was blind and deaf I would think I was eating at a toilet, a toilet in hell."
Jane C.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,64,153,5.0,6/18/2014,"Service was great- prompt, attentive, responsive, clean. We enjoyed our meal finished with the s'mores cheesecake! Yummy!"
Alex P.,"National City, San Diego, CA",15,5,1,2.0,7/9/2015,The WORSE service ever!!!!! The food was great and their specials were good but the service from the kid in front and our waitress was horrible!
Elle B.,"Linda Vista, San Diego, CA",710,13,15,4.0,8/8/2015,"I had the firecracker shrimp, and fried zucchini. Not a lot of people there which was nice to me. I don't particularly care for major large crowds while I'm eating. The prices were excellent during this Happy Hour time frame and I will certainly be back. Very friendly staff and the ambiance was sweet."
Rick S.,"Chula Vista, CA",23,5,4,4.0,8/6/2015,"Our server tonight, Joseph, was outstanding! Above the usual great service at Cheesecake. Usually the food is pretty good here. Tonight the chicken Marsala was a bit too oily. But everything else was awesome."
