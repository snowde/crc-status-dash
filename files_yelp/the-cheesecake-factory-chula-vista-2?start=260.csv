C M.,"Chula Vista, CA",13,27,6,2.0,9/18/2015,"I have been coming to Cheesecake Factory in Chula Vista since its inception to this location. My other visits were above satisfactory but my last visit on Sept 11, 2015 was below average. They changed their menu and changed crusted salmon salad with Kale salmon salad and frankly it wasn't up to par. Additionally the shrimp garlic pasta was too salty unlike the previous ones we had.. The service was great and the ambiance is good but the particular dish we always ordered wasn't good. I think we will think twice before we go back to visit Cheesecake Factory again."
Doug S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,31,,4.0,9/9/2015,"It's a Cheesecake Factory... You pretty much know what to expect. Always great service, makes every type of food just about above average. Really only amazing thing about it is the desserts.  Never had a bad experience at this Cheesecake, nor any while were at it. Always a nice place to eat."
Loyd B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,18,,2.0,7/22/2015,Quality of food went down from how i remembered it. Used to be a food joint i would go regularly but not anymore.
Lisa W.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,3,1,2.0,9/2/2015,"Dinner was great. Service was great...but the next day when I was eating my left over mashed potatoes I found a piece of plastic string. I think it's from the potato bag...idk. It was big enough that I could have choked. Anyway, I uploaded a pic of it. Warning, if you order the mash potatoes please inspect them before eating. Better yet don't order them at all. If not for that string I would given 5 stars."
Sylvia F.,"New Bern, NC",12,199,473,4.0,11/19/2011,"OK, I'm stuck in a rut. Every time I go to ""Cheesecake"" I order the same thing. Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. SO GOOD! Love the crispy fries. Crunchy on the outside fluffy on the inside....yum. We got a order of Onion rings as well and those are almost better than the fries.....ALMOST. You cant go wrong here. The menu is a book. You'll find something you like. Check out my pictures."
Anisah A.,"San Diego, CA",8,36,,4.0,5/6/2015,"Great service and delicious food + drinks! I love the pasta carbonara, roasted lemon herb chicken and the salmon is always great! Don't forget the cheesecake at the end :)"
Linda K.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,54,2,4.0,5/21/2015,"The food are great the Bang Bang Shrimp is my favorite, service is good too! My new hangout with my best friend."
Wade R.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,42,,3.0,4/1/2016,"Ate there with wife and two nieces from South Korea.  The food was ok, but nothing to brag about.  The server provided outstanding service.  Three women, cant make up their mind, keep asking for additional items.  Good Job to him."
Celby A.,"Chula Vista, CA",36,36,126,5.0,3/8/2014,"I love that when I come here there's no long lines, I guess coz I know not to come here on holidays. Staff are friendly, talks to my kids every time were here coz were at least once a week. Bread is good as always, we always ask for calamari and through the years it still taste the same. If we crave for dinner we always come here, coz we hate driving far specially when were hungry. I tried almost all of the specials here so I know it's good. overall I love this place, I don't have to cook coz it's by my house and like I said me and my husband hates driving when were hungry."
R T.,"San Diego, CA",0,50,57,4.0,5/16/2015,"Excellent service. Lisa, Joseph and the Manager were friendly and welcoming.  My husband and I went right to the bar (no waiting - Saturday lunchtime) and had a nice lunch with drinks.  Order the key lime pie-- delicious."
Melissa H.,"Chula Vista, CA",217,188,36,1.0,11/27/2013,"I didn't get a chance to write my review on this place till now.  I heard a lot of good things about the food and the service.  I decided to try it with my son and it was not a pleasant experience.  One the wait was crazy....45 minutes for a table.  I asked if we can sit outside or at the bar area....yes. The hostess says your more than welcome to seat yourself.  I sit down near the bar area and waited for our server. 15 minutes later and nothing yet, no greeting, no eye contact, nothing. Just servers passing us by.  My son stops a gentlemen and asks if we can get help, sure he said and he will be right back. 10 minutes later, still nothing.  By then it's 25 minutes and counting with no help or acknowledgement.  We got up and walked out. Panera Bread received our service that day!!"
Allison J.,"San Diego, CA",561,858,2572,4.0,1/6/2014,"If I had to choose a chain restaurant to dine at, particularly in this area, I would definitely have Cheesecake Factory at the top of my list. First, the complimentary rye bread is the best. We always need refills of this. Second, their menu is huge! You can have options for every day of the year (well, not really, but I'm sure if you dined here once weekly, the. You would). Portion sizes are huge. You'll always have leftovers or you can always share with a friend. They have a skinnylicious menu for those with calories on their mind - go with the shrimp pasta! And there are tons of options in this menu. I recently had the luau salad and I've been craving that for days!  Be prepared to wait for a table. They don't take reservations and lately they have been crowded.  I'm not a fan of cheesecake and is don't think I've ever ordered dessert from a CF, so I can't comment on this, but from what my hubby and friends have told me, they make pretty desirable cheesecakes."
Theresa And Anthony E.,"Chula Vista, CA",28,133,141,5.0,9/13/2014,"This is my fave restaurant of all time. My husbands first time trying it the other day.. I Love everything about this restaurant and and all the locations are similar except this one sat us faster! They have a great ambiance, service, good, presentation, atmosphere and environment! Everything is good and there's so much to choose from.. It's almost hard to make a decision with so many different choices! Whatever you get it will be good and filling! There's never any room for cheesecake I always have to take a slice home for a late night snack and boy is it good! They always start you off with endless bread and the breads yummy, try not to fill up on it before apps! I always seem to get the Cajun chicken littles plate that comes with mashed potatoes which are delicious and a corn veggie medley that is seasoned to perfection! This time we tried fried Zuccini and it was the best I've ever had! It's lightly coated breaking was perfect enough for a slight crisp but the Zuccini was cooked perfectly, not hard but not too soft just right! Their ranch is tasty too. We also tried the chicken samosa appetizer which was great! Then hubby had the herb roasted salmon with shrimp and it was delicious! That salmon was excellent! Thanks for great service to Joseph L who was kind, friendly and prompt! We can't wait to go back!"
Arlem D.,"Lemon Grove, CA",9,83,30,3.0,3/16/2015,"I always enjoy coming here for the food and desert. The customer service sucks!! We went here yesterday for an early lunch, we decided to sit outside the waitress really needs to work on her customer service. We would ask her for napkins and she took long to bring them, she didn't even bother asking if we needed refills, or really never checked to see if we needed anything. Feels like everytime we go here we get bad customer service. Last time I came here the server over charged my card. I only give them three stars for the food"
Darcy P.,"La Mesa, CA",68,85,25,4.0,2/8/2015,"Went here with my man last night.  Started with shana in the bar. I had the georgia peach. He had jameison and ginger.  Mine was yummy.  She gave us menu lowdown as it was our first time....  I endesnup ordering the chicken madera ( any of u remember me from a while back Tracy Shrewder, Annette Clayton) last thing I woukd eat is chixken but it had mushrooms and asparagus and cheese. Literally melted in my mouth.  Dude had Hibachi steak.  Our thought was to 1/2 them.  His was not hot enuff and sauce on top ok. Thats why 4.  We both liked mine better it was pretty delicious and their menus extensive.  Oh yeah the cheesecake.   Always yummiest thing on earth.  I had something like Adams peanut butter drizzled in choxolate and he got the original.  Too full.  Had cpl bites when we got home  and I of course finished mine off this morning for breakfast"
Andrea A.,"University Heights, San Diego, CA",141,14,19,4.0,3/24/2015,"Good place to eat, messed up on orders a couple times but always fixed them... Our go to place"
Solehjon S.,"La Mesa, CA",35,13,2,5.0,2/25/2016,Great restaurant!!! Nice food!!! Really enjoyed. Gotta come back to have dinner again!
Samuel B.,"San Diego, CA",18,93,28,5.0,11/21/2013,"The best Cheesecake Factory! Awesome service, the waits are very minimal and the best that Otay Ranch has to offer.  Their take out is also awesome with their curbside pick up! Great job CF!!"
Cali S.,"San Diego, CA",752,351,92,4.0,6/26/2013,Eating the fried Mac & cheese balls... Delicious Love it here. This is only my second time here and I am hooked They have happy hour but I'm never smart enough to use it but that's ok because the food is totally worth the price
John B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/2/2016,My family loves this place. Parking might be a bit difficult. I always have someone hop out and reserve a table while I find parking. They also have valet parking. The food and the service is excellent. I would recommend it to anybody.
