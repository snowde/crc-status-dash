San T.,"Coronado, CA",0,28,15,5.0,10/27/2014,Great food. Great service. Promptly seated. The tamale cake  melts in your mouth! The lunch specials are reasonably price.The cheesecake is unbelievable!  Great place for lunch with the girls.
Misty A.,"La Mesa, CA",217,94,404,2.0,7/28/2011,"Next time I'll pass on breakfast and stick to the lunch and dinner menu.  So for my first trip to Sunday brunch I was thinking I was in for a treat, I mean I love the Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately I was super disappointed:( I had the french toast with strawberry's and my bf had the eggs benedict. The french toast had strawberry's in between the layers of french toast which would have been great had the french toast been cooked all the way. It was so raw I could only eat the edges. I don't know what was up with their cooks that day because my bf's eggs benedict was under cooked too. The eggs were so under cooked it was was gross."
Ronnie C.,"Chula Vista, CA",13,47,8,4.0,8/25/2014,"Ive had some bad experiences here, but I will say the way the situations were handled was impressive!  There's nothing on the menu that I totally love except I was there for brunch on Sunday and OMG!! the chilaquiles were amazing!! I am super picky about my chilaquiles because in my book no one makes them as delish as my aunt and cousin.....now i want to go back every sunday just to have that!  :D"
Annastacia W.,"Spring Valley, CA",1,14,,5.0,6/16/2015,The service we received was great! Our waiter was constantly checking in with us and had charisma. I recommend the bellagio chicken or the Louisiana chicken pasta for an entree and the Chris's outrageous cheesecake. The quality and taste of the food was spot on.
Marc B.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",367,50,1,4.0,3/22/2015,Food isn't much to talk about. The calamari is pretty good and most of the apps. The cheesecake is amazing. One of my favorites. All the slices I've had are incredible. The carrot cake is also epic.
Christopher G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,9,4,5.0,3/21/2015,"Great place to eat if you like choices, wait time is good alot better than the one off of friars road, service is has always been good. Have loved everything I choose to eat here , you cant go wrong with anything on the menu"
Laura D.,"San Diego, CA",284,223,362,4.0,12/15/2013,"If you want to eat at a Cheesecake Factory without all the fuss from the Fashion Valley location then come here. The wait is usually 5-15 minutes which isn't bad at all.  The place is very large and spacious and has a great bar area. If the wait is longer than 20 minutes my family and I usually just grab a table by the bar. If you have a large party then this is the place to come. They're very accommodating to large parties but if you're a group of teens just remember to be polite. I know a lot of waiters don't like looking after a bunch of wild teens.  As for the food, it's just your standard Cheesecake Factory food. The burgers are great here! I usually get a burger whenever I come. Other items that I love are the Miso Salmon, the Chicken Salad Sandwich, and the Pasta DaVinci.  If you find that Cheesecake Factory is a bit overpriced then come here during lunch! You basically get the same portion for a couple dollars cheaper. The lunch pasta is still huge for just $11! The Renee's Special is another great lunch special which includes half a sandwich, salad, and a soup. It's a great deal if you ask me. The service can sometimes be hit or miss though, that's where I take off a star. Sometimes you get great service and other times you barely get a visit from your waiter, he/she forgets everything, and the food takes forever! Also you can't just play on your phone here since the reception is horrible. Just keep asking for more free bread and you'll be ok. Overall this is a pretty good Cheesecake Factory location and I prefer it to the Fashion Valley location.  (PS. Is it just me or do the light fixtures by the booths look like the Eye of Sauron?)"
Rolando F.,"San Diego, CA",1,9,3,3.0,6/1/2014,"I had a horrible experience yesterday,  My birthday luch and I found a freaking hair in my plate, waiter was cool and I know shit happens but I think,  no! I'm sure they just took my plate ""to make me a new Cuban Sandwich,  my favorite I might say""  and beside waiting another 15 minutes for a ""new"" one I know they just stuck it in the microwave and sent it out again. Messed up uh?"
Anne M.,"San Diego, CA",22,175,11,2.0,1/12/2014,"I am a big Cheesecake Factory fan (and I don't even like cheesecake!!)  My last few experiences here have been really disappointing.  I was literally eating lunch with my friend (who used to be a server at the CF) telling her how I've never had bad service... and then we had bad service.  Our server basically ignored us, stood on the opposite side of a large counter when talking to us instead of standing next to the table, messed up some of our requests, and then was MIA when we wanted more drinks and our tab.   I've had two visits where they were out of a menu item.  One was the chicken marsala; the server suggested a different sauce that is similar. I just said okay because I didn't know what else I wanted to order.  It was gross and way too salty.  The polenta fries do not taste like any polenta I have ever eaten - the polenta is all blended to mush and it almost tastes like a mozzarella stick.  Almost every time I order my favorite appetizer (buffalo blasts) they take forever to come out and the servers always come and apologize, but then never comp it or even offer a free soft drink.  Once I ordered take out and it took over 30 minutes to get my food. Aside from those negatives, I do appreciate the numerous menu choices and my other experiences have been positive.  I am kind of addicted to the Buffalo Blasts... definitely give them a try."
Alicen V.,"Chula Vista, CA",77,37,125,4.0,8/14/2014,"Overall Cheesecake is a favorite! Quality of food is overall a 4.5. Service is typically outstanding. This location isn't nearly as crowded as fashion valley so waited time/convenience receives higher marks. However I think that due to fact that this location has the name the service lacks a bit. I've had a few services problems, including cold to-go food along with lacking curbside, at this location more than once and the manager has not been very sympathetic about it which I think is the company's policy."
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",670,814,2965,3.0,10/27/2011,"It's your typical CCF, but this is a smaller more intimate location. I love that you can get in and out without the typical one or two hour wait. Our wait was 20 minutes - on a Saturday night. Score!  My sweetie's salisbury steak was not cooked. No bueno! Our server did take it back immediately though. And of course, as it is with all Cheesecake Factory's, the manager offered to comp our meal.  Yes please.  Sadly though, there was like a 30 minute wait because they ran out of gravy for the steak...WTF! I really enjoyed my spicy crispy beef though. I just wish I could have finished it.  The funny thing is, as full as I was I still managed to take a piece of Hershey's chocolate cheesecake home. Please pray for me.  The service very good. The only downside is that it's not in my neck of the woods, so I can't say I would frequent this location."
Gael G.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,2,,2.0,2/21/2015,Its a mascarade of fancyness but my party waited for an hour for their food and the food is decent but servers lag to come back but over all it was okay I guess
Jessica C.,"Chula Vista, CA",44,139,92,3.0,4/30/2011,"I've been here many times and tonight I came again with my family for my sister's birthday.  I absolutely love the decor inside!  It's always very clean and I have always had excellent service. I was a little disappointed that they didn't take reservations.  Boo. The food is good, but not ""omg I love this place"" good, you know?  Their menu is seriously overwhelming.. they have sandwiches, pizzas, pasta, steak, seafood, burritos, asian food, salad, burgers, a bunch of other random things, and of course, cheesecake.  Perhaps I'd like this place more if I was actually a fan of cheesecake?  Who knows. One of my favorite things here is their kobe burger.  It's awesome when it's made right.  The past two times I've had it, I ordered it medium well and it came out well done.. womp womp, but the first time was great.. so I guess I'll start ordering it medium & hope for medium well! Tonight I had the four cheese pasta with chicken and it was just as good as when I had it the first time.  We also had the sliders and the fried mac & cheese for our appetizers and both were awesome!!  I loved the fried macaroni and cheese!! I ate 2 of the 4 little balls they gave us!!  The sliders were good too!  I also tried some of my boyfriend's crispy beef entree and it was pretty good. We came around the time the sun was setting so all we had was what we left of the sunlight and the weak dim ceiling lights.. my parents couldn't see their food!!  I guess it's supposed to create a romantic atmosphere or something.. but I'd rather see my food.. This place is nice, but it's never my first choice.  A-OK to me."
AJ I.,"Spring Valley, CA",177,111,37,4.0,6/17/2011,"This place is definitely great dinner and dessert place. Although I've failed to leave room for desert almost everytime. First off, their brown bread is addicting. You will get full from munching on it.  Their specialties are great. Their orange chicken is pretty good. Fried macaroni and cheese is a sin. The meatloaf is also good.. Now lets get to the good stuff.. the cheesecakes! they are pretty pricey but they are also rich and heavy. You'll probably regret eating a whole slice on your own. It'll put you in a coma. My favorites are the red velvet and dulce de leche. And you can't go wrong with the chocolate ones! You definitely want to share this It's better to go to this location than Fashion Valley because it's not as ridiculously busy."
L A.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,4.0,10/10/2014,"Probably one of our favorite restaurants. Love the pasta and deserts. You certainly wont get bored picking from their menu which is huge. From the turkey burger, pasta, drinks and huge chocolate truffle cake you cannot go wrong with your choices. Wait times typically not a big deal at this restaurant compared to Fashion Valley location. Staff very nice."
Big D.,"Cathedral City, CA",1,4,1,1.0,2/15/2014,I took my fiance to this restaurant for Valentine's Day my server was awesome but I ordered the four cheese chicken pasta and the pasta came out hard I took two bites had my lady ta k e a bite to make I wasn't trippin she said they probably didn't cook them long enough so I did pay without incident but didn't eat it.
EJ W.,"Spring Valley, San Diego, CA",0,23,9,2.0,2/1/2015,"I've been to several locations, but this one takes the cake for worst service. 1) Why did it take 30 mins for my table to be offered drinks? 2) Why did our waitress Amy keep saying she would be right with us but could never stop and ask if we were ready for anything? (Other associates we had to wave down ended up helping us) 3) Why did they repetitively get my order wrong and make me wait a total of an hour for my food? Their service at this location puts a bad name on the business. Get it together."
Lilli G.,"San Diego, CA",547,49,37,4.0,3/1/2015,"I like this Cheesecake Factory. The servers are always very professional and courteous. The presentation is always on point. We chose this spot for my son's birthday because the staff always great and they have a huge menu to choose from. Everyone's happy! From seafood, steaks, and or traditional American burgers, everything we have tasted here has been tasty. I recommend this place for anyone wanting a nice family evening out without breaking the bank. My favorite here is the Miso Salmon. MMMMM."
Krista S.,"San Diego, CA",23,4,,1.0,12/21/2013,This review is solely based on the service!!! Hands down the worst service I have ever received the server was horrible the manager brought our drinks the server asked my friend three times if she wanted the spinach artichoke dip then asked me how I wanted my chicken cooked cause I ordered the chicken Madeira/steak Diane combo really??? We ordered appetizers those arrived at the same time as our main meal which was also when we found out that they ran out of the spinach dip after we had talked to the manager the server was really skiddish towards us it took her forever to do anything she dropped off our check and then when we had a question about it she sent someone else over to us end result was we talked to the other manager she apologized to us about our experience our bill was $116.00 and we got shitty service!!! I personally like the food there but the service is ridiculous! I won't be going back anytime soon!!
Andre P.,"Chula Vista, CA",13,26,17,4.0,12/29/2014,My wife and I love to come here on date nights. Yes the wait can sometimes be longer than 25 mins but what do you expect its cheesecake factory there's only one location in the southbay. (its well worth the wait) They have over 18 pages on there menu it can get overwhelming at times I always had a hard time deciding because everything they serve is good. If you love salads will BBQ then I strongly suggest you try the Chicken BBQ salad its amazing and it comes with fried onions. Another one you need to try is the chicken maderia trust me you wont be disappointed. The only reason why I wont give it a 5 star rating is because the waiters can be a hit or miss here. I feel like they are something under staff during rush hour.
