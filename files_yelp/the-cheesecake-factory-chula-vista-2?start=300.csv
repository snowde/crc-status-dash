Stephanie T.,"Chula Vista, CA",211,168,307,3.0,11/19/2014,"I wish that Rudy was still at this location. He was amazing. Not that the other people are not amazing, but he just brought a lot to our evenings whenever we would go to have an appetizer and a glass of wine."
Itzel S.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/27/2016,"Terrible service. Overall bad experience. We sat down and waited to be offered drinks, almost 20 mins went by and a waiter asked if we had been helped which we answered no and asked for drinks and water. Waited for another 10 mins for our drinks and we had to ask for bread. Once the waitress finally came to take our order which we had been ready for a while my friend asked for an appetizer to which she replied with "" oh I wouldn't order that it's going to take too long"" she then went on to tell us a story about how a previous guest had to wait about 40 mins which we were okay with but she was very pushy on us not ordering that. We then went on with our orders. When I asked for my option of course the restaurant ran out of turkey burgers. And then she showed me a list of all the items that were unavailable for whatever reason. I don't know if that's how this restaurant works but it is unacceptable in my book. After that My boyfriend asked for more sauce for his pasta which took another 30 mins and me having to remind the waitress. Food was good but it was difficult to enjoy with such  terrible and to top it off they acted like all this was the norm."
Doug D.,"San Diego, CA",3,30,7,1.0,6/27/2015,Now I realize why this restaurant is not even four star. Kid Host Person unfriendly. No welcome or goodbye. But how does one teach etiquette to someone whose  highlight of the day is probably eating at McDonalds. Professionalism at the podium for the initial greeting is critical. Tables filthy along with spotted silverware and menus so dirty that one needs hand sanitizer after reviewing. My server today her first name starts with the letter M. Uniform in total disarray with disgusting stained white shirt and her hair looked like it hadn't been touched in a week. I was grossed out. Service throughout the meal...too many inconsistencies to even mention here. On this occasion food was very good but simple. Caesar salad and Cobb salad. I was so disappointed for the second time with the cleanliness and service of this place I had to call the manager Amy who's not the General Manager but I'm assuming his assistant. She took down all my concerns and was gracious. This may sound odd but she was the only highlight because she knew what I was talking about and agreed. I'm a former Food and Beverage Director in Las Vegas and San Diego and I give a lot of leeway when it comes to service as I understand things happen. But an unprofessional service staff...there is no excuse for it. Too much standing around when they can be polishing silverware and cleaning menus and training. This is a Manager problem as they must be hesitant to delegate  or instruct their staff for some reason.  I told Amy today I want nothing from this place but just to bring it to her attention. My experiences in Las Vegas with Cheesecake Factory in the Venetian and other places is five star. Maybe it's because of the Nevada Health Department takes things more seriously and it doesn't in San Diego which is probably too laid back. And if that's not the case then the service staff is definitely too laid back and I can sense they don't know or don't care about guest retention.  Bottom line profits at the Cheesecake Factory must be doing great because I don't know how Corporate allows mediocrity to continue.
Ryan K.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,13,8,5.0,3/27/2015,"This post is mostly in regards to happy hour, but other times have been great too. We come in a few times a week for the happy hour here and pretty much stopped going elsewhere for happy hour. The menu for happy hour is cheap and delicious. The drink specials are much better than the normal prices. The wait staff is great but my wife and I prefer to sit at the bar...we don't get asked what we want anymore because they all know us and what we normally order. Shayna, Josh, Bryan, Ray and Will are great behind the bar!"
James H.,"San Diego, CA",1,17,1,2.0,2/8/2015,"We normally come to cheese cake factory with my in-laws at least once a month. We came because there is such a big menu selection everybody can leave happy.  Last few months have been slipping. Our last visit included a 35 minute wait, and sub par service and food.  We are not normally picky/send back eaters but we had 4 waiters /waitresses and a lot of miscommunication.  Really disappointed, because all cheese cake factories are normally very good. Gonna have to find a new restaurant to frequent now."
Priscilla N.,"San Francisco, CA",759,218,660,4.0,1/15/2013,"Cheescake, pretty self-explanatory. Satisfies the needs/wants of each guest the menu is about 12 pages long. Pretty sure you can find a good pick ;)  Things I love: Mexican half salad, lettuce wraps, chicken/avocado sandwich. So many great mix of options."
Aaron A.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,35,2,4.0,1/30/2015,Hibachi Steak is the s**t! To die for! Im stuffed right now and could still eat hit! Customer service was good! They'd get five stars but I didn't dig the 30 minute wait!
Gina K.,"Palo Alto, CA",123,113,33,5.0,6/10/2011,"Love this restaurant. Great for groups of people as the menu has something for everyone. Been to this location 3 times, plus 2 times to the one in Palo Alto. Have not been disappointed by either, though this one has a much friendlier staff (the folks in PA seem a little stressed).  Be prepared to take home leftovers!"
kay c.,"San Diego, CA",166,74,1273,4.0,8/31/2010,"I frequent this place quite often to hit up their small plates menu or Sunday brunch.  I'm totally addicted to every mojito concoction they serve. They have happy hour from 4-6 M-F.  It loses a star because my favorite bartender  (Boma)  has moved to another location.   I've practically tried almost every dish on the menu.  The latest and greatest that has appealed to me are the following: Arugula Salad: Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil Ahi Tartare: Raw Tuna with Avocado and Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce. Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip: A delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes, Cheese and Sour Cream. Served Warm with Grilled Sourdough Bread. Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger: Smoked Bacon and Melted Cheddar with Crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce. Monte Cristo Sandwich: Crunchy French Toast Stuffed with Bacon, Grilled Ham, Scrambled Eggs and Melted Swiss Cheese Dusted with Powdered Sugar and Served with Strawberry Preserves. Crab Hash: A Delicious Blend of Sautéed Crab, Red, Yellow and Green Peppers, Onions and Potatoes. Topped with Poached Eggs and Hollandaise Sauce. The ambiance is chill not as crazy as Fashion Valley.  It works for me, if you want to be able to enjoy a meal and conversation with a few friends."
Michael S.,"San Diego, CA",168,69,41,4.0,7/14/2013,"One of the largest menus I have ever seen. I wish I could have room for cheesecake, but the entrees are all so big.  I wish I could give them a 5 star review but for brunch this morning my wife's eggs Benedict was cold. She said it tasted great but was not happy with it being cold.  You really get your money's worth and the service is always so great. Next time I will just get dessert. Plus I wish they had drink specials. I would love to come here with the wife for some drinks and cheese cake."
Edward R.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,10,4,2.0,6/4/2014,"Never in my life have I had such a horrible experience at a restaurant. Being one of the few groups waiting, we were informed of a 1-1.5 hour wait. We spoke to the curly-haired hostess regarding the possibility of splitting our part of 11 into two groups to get seated quicker. She strongly recommended we wait it out for all 11 of us to sit together.  As we waited a full two hours, we managed to grab a few drinks only to see parties of 4-8 people being seated left and right. It wasn't till after the two hour mark, were we finally seated.  I felt pretty embarrassed being ridiculed by some poor decision made by such an amateur hostess. Two of my guests were of age 85 and 86 and I was embarrassed to keep them out past 11:30pm when we had gotten to the restaurant by 8.  Keep in mind, we called the day prior only to be denied any reservation due to ""store policy."" On top of such a horrible experience before the meal, it was a slap in the face to see that the guests being seated before us (who arrived well after we did) so happened to be a vast majority of america (white) descent. While this bias may simply be coincidental, it's no excuse for being seated at a table where we have to wait 10 minutes for their signature bread and butter. Fortunately, a couple of drinks made the 30minute additional wait for food go by rather quickly.  While the food probably met company standards, the frustration and stress caused as a result of a poor, unorganized, unconcerned hostess was unacceptable.  I felt horrible that our server had to be a part of our unpleasing experience. He had the enthusiasm to provide a great experience but after the wait we were't having much of it. Props to him (bald guy I didn't catch his name). He did the best he can to make the remainder of our experience positive; as we have experienced at CCF in the past.  At the end of the night we still tipped our $300 bill and enjoyed a night with a couple of good drinks (shoutout to Josh the bartender).  My advice: Keep up the good work and re-train (or get rid of) hostesses that can't handle the responsibility of being the first impression of the restaurant."
Jaygee G.,"Bonita, CA",76,25,2,1.0,1/17/2015,"All I can say is ... Salty pasta :(. I've had fettuccine Alfredo twice, and both of the times the pasta was just too salty. Service is average but food is not that great. My husband also agrees that the food isn't that great. His plate was just so simple ... Nothing to be excited for."
Cara J.,"San Diego, CA",1,1,,5.0,4/6/2014,"I recently took my staff out for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory in Eastlake. The manager and servers were very accommodating and definitely exceeded my expectations with the delicious food and impeccable service. If you're in the mood for something sweet, try the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore cheesecake. It's the best!"
Maricela H.,"San Diego, CA",940,558,266,4.0,10/8/2010,I love Cheese and all things made of it! Cheesecake factory never lets me down! My friend and I are big fans of the Georgia peach alcoholic beverage from here so we decided to scurry on down and enjoy one or two in my case.   We usually split a Caesar salad and a dinner plate because we try to save room for cheesecake of course.   This night I wanted the arugula salad so I ordered it off the small plates meVnu he got the Caesar and we split some breaded chicken plate with pasta can't remember the name sorry.   The drinks were amazing as usual.  Salad great just want I wanted.  The pasta sauce was a little bland but the flavor of the chicken was great.   Cheesecake of course.  I like the lemon raspberry one but it wasn't my turn to pick so he chose pineapple upside down cheesecake.  Not bad but a little on the sweet side for me.   You can bet I will be returning and it will be my turn to choose the cheesecake yay!
Tracey H.,"Suffolk, VA",114,235,37,3.0,7/7/2012,"I'm usually not partial to eating at nationwide chains when I'm on vacation because of the obvious......I can get [insert restaurant name here] back home.  Oh well, the adults have seniority, right?  And by adults I mean my mom, aunt and uncle.  I kind of cowered in agreement even though the ""kids"" (my fiancé,  my son, his daughter and myself) had our hearts set on Islands. So off we go.  5 adults and 2 kids.  It was about noon on a Saturday and we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  Not bad at all.   I ordered the Navajo.  It's Indian fry bread stuffed with grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, avocado, mayo......its pretty damn good.  I was pleasantly surprised and it's huge! The kids had a burger and pizza respectively.  Both off of the adult menu because they're greedy like that (yet not overweight, otherwise they would have been fed salads with vinaigrette). Fiancé had the ribeye with a side of Mac and cheese.  He, like I always do, ordered his steak mid-rare.  It was unfortunately overcooked.  Not terribly overcooked, but enough to not be perfect.  It was still pink, but we like our steaks mooing.....sort of.   The adults had a veggie burger, turkey sandwich and a shrimp platter.  I didn't hear any complaints so I will assume it was all good. Back in VA cheesecake factory is just far enough to not frequent, but overall, I am a fan."
Karla C.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,9,88,5.0,6/27/2015,I love this Cheesecake Factory. Well it's the only one near us. It's always a long wait but the happy hour menu is awesome. Can't go wrong. Convenient coz its walking distance to my place.
margaret g.,"Bonita, CA",9,44,3,4.0,6/7/2014,"No big surprises on our visit to the Cheesecake Factory in CV today. Their consistency is one of the things I like about it. We arrived a little after on a Friday afternoon, thinking we would miss the lunch rush. No such luck. There was a short wait, but my hub and grabbed a table in the bar which worked fine. \ Our server Sabria was friendly and efficient. We had the zucchini for an app. I was hoping for more. Where is the fresh cut, tempura battered zuchs that I haven't seen since before Crouching Lion changed owners?? Anyway, I had the French Country Salad and Clam Chowder. They both knocked my socks off! The salad is mixed greens, grilled asparagus, beets, goat cheese, candied pecans in a balsamic vinaigrette. The chowder was thick and creamy, the potato, carrots cut in a small dice that I loved. It was so good I didn't add my customary drops of tabasco, as I didn't want to adulterate it's perfect flavor. My hub had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, with coleslaw. Both were very good - sorry that's all I could get from him. He was a little busy. Very good lunch!"
Michelle S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,15,2,3.0,11/11/2014,I have ordered curbside and although convenient I find that it's been more than once the order was not done correctly. Hopefully they will train their employees to double check that everything is complete before giving to customers
Niquelle W.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,14,,4.0,7/5/2014,"Not a fan of the plastic mugs but other than that it was a nice experience.  Met my husband for lunch. We had zero wait time and our server was very nice and pleasant.  We had to wait a few minutes for the bread when when it arrived it was hot out of the oven.  My husband ordered a fettuccine with sun tried tomatoes and chicken.  It was good and very creamy, I ordered my regular- Jamaican black pepper shrimp.  This was a little sweeter than normal but delicious and spicy!"
Cyn T.,"San Diego, CA",171,94,14,4.0,4/15/2014,What started out as a one star review ended in 4!I went to breakfast this past weekend with my fiance and his parents.  We waited a while for our food and when it finally came it was cold. Our potatoes were hard and dried out.ive never had a bad experience here before so I was shocked.  We had other things to do and didnt want to wait on hot food. The manager came out in seconds to apologized. Before we can even finish our conversation hot food was out and our bill taken care of. Great customer service and great management!  No excuses just results I will definitely keep coming back.
