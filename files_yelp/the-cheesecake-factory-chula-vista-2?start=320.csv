Mike C.,"Castle Rock, CO",92,43,195,4.0,2/27/2011,"i've been here a few times; prior to my Yelping experience may seem.  This place is awesome; because the one located at the Fashion Valley Mall is ALWAYS crowded with a 2 to 3 hour wait...(Darn tourist!)  LOL!   The food is good, service is good, however what puts it in the 4 star range is this...You only have to wait 20 minutes or less to be seated!!  I'm just sayin'...The mall there is great as well and I definitely recommend it if you've got some free time on the weekend. Semper Fi!"
Darwin L.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,7,,5.0,12/26/2014,"Great atmosphere, great service and, caring management and great food. My wife and I have been eating at the Otay Ranch Cheesecake Factory since it opened. Prior to that we ate at the Cheesecake factory at Fashion Valley.  We had great experiences at Fashion Valley however our experiences at Otay Ranch Cheesecake Factory is second to none.  We are fortunate to have such a venue in Chula Vista. No need to ever leave Chula Vista."
Einna S.,"San Diego, CA",131,196,363,3.0,1/14/2011,"My parents are pretty picky when it comes to eating out. Typically when we eat out...they like going to Chinese Restaurants, Filipino spots, or those chain joints (Chilis, TGIFS, etc). Dad chose The Cheesecake Factory for his lucky 1/11/11 birthday but we celebrated it early on a Sunday.  The bf and I got there first...30 minute wait on a Sunday night. Are you kidding me?! And yes i've been to the FV Cheesecake Factory as well so I know that these waits can take forever and a day. Family finally arrived and we were still not seated. When we FINALLY were seated, they didn't have that brown bread...they were out.  By the time we were seated, they were pretty much out of everything. The original dish the bf ordered was out. My dish came with rice and that sh#t was hard as fcuk. I understand that you are in a rush but damnnnn...i like my rice done right at least. I couldn't even eat it.  Overall, the food (not my rice) was good, our waitress was super nice, the person that seated was ehhhh, but the memories were unforgettable.  Note to self, do not come here on Sunday nights for dinner...they are out of almost everything. WORD!"
Alondra M.,"National City, CA",39,8,,5.0,12/23/2015,"This place is definitely a favorite. The quality is great and if you're  planning to splurge, then this is the place to be and you won't regret it . I don't come here often but when I do, the experience is always pleasant."
Eddie R.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/10/2014,"My family loves this restaurant. We've always had good service and they have some really good dishes. There are slight inconsistencies with the preparation of the food, otherwise I would've given them 5 stars."
Carlos M.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",192,40,43,3.0,8/5/2014,"Semi up scale sit down place; where children are still okay. Loud enough to hide children's cries but comfortable enough for a decent date or a few drinks with friends. Cheesecake is a 9. Improvements can be made. I've had better cheesecake, and since this is the Cheesecake Factory I expect more. Avocado egg roles are my go to. Over all nice place, decent service and nice environment. Nothing spectacular. A safe to go place.,"
Cindy S.,"San Diego, CA",54,33,2,3.0,12/2/2015,Went for bday. OMG. I ordered fish tacos not as great as first time they had too re do tacos again fish was under cook.  Took about an hour to get served few dishes wer mixed up  not cool waiters was nice and not her fault.
Kacie B.,"Menifee, CA",8,35,56,5.0,3/16/2014,"We went back again! Not even 30 days later! I got the Chicken Madeira and my husband got the Garlic Farfalle!!! They were both so amazing! My husband said his noodles were the best thing he has ever ordered there and it will probably be his go to from now on! We had another wonderful experience due in large part to our amazing waiter! Joseph was fun and efficient from the beginning and added little touches all throughout the meal to make it a wonderful experience! Next time you go, request him if possible!!! We will ask for him directly next time no matter the wait!"

Steph L.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/16/2016,"I really want to like Cheesecake factory--as I really do like the actual cheesecake there.  We probably have been going for lunch (only occasionally dinner) once every month or two for the last couple years.  Even when it is only two of us, it is impossible to get out of there in less than an hour and a half, and it's usually closer to two hours.  Everything is so SLOW, from getting bread and glasses of water through to getting the check and paying.  Last time apparently the table hadn't been wiped down because I sat my arm in a sticky mess.  Gross.  Waitress was apologetic and had someone come clean it.  Ahi tuna appetizer was great, but sandwiches and salad were not as tasty this time as normal.  The visit before that, we were seated on the open patio and were promptly forgotten about (it was a little chilly out, but if you are going to seat us there it would be nice to have a waitress come out more than once every 30 minutes, seriously.  Eventually I had to peer in through a window just to get the check).  I think it will be awhile before I go back, or maybe next time I'll just get a slice of cheesecake to go."
Kara P.,"San Diego, CA",320,400,1579,4.0,6/8/2010,"Bang Bang chicken & shrimp is the dish to get here, but if you have the opportunity to get breakfast, opt for the french toast on eggy brioche bread.  It's thick, crispy, and a perfect compliment to 2 strips of bacon. Sunday brunch menu starts at 10am & if you are out in Eastlake and want to avoid the Broken Yolk crowd, check out the Sunday menu here without any wait.  Since the mall openes at 11am, no one is around at 10am & you can usually get some quick seating.  I tried the crab hash with 2 poached eggs and loved the thick chunks of crab meat that is hidden under the 2 perfectly poached eggs."
Rocky R.,"Lemoore, CA",41,18,1,5.0,3/30/2014,"Food was delicious as always but it was my server who sets this experience apart from all my other times at cheesecake factory. His name was Joseph. He was just down right delightful. Really nice kid, worked really hard to make my time here pleasant. He also had his tie in an Eldridge knot which was really cool to see. Just proves his willingness to stay motivated. The kitchen sort of burnt my bacon and I was so full from all the rest of my food I didn't want to bother sending it back, but Joseph swooped in to save the day. I didn't even have to ask him to take it off my check he did it on his own. Hope he gets promoted to a trainer or something because waiters should be taking notes from this guy"
Leeon A.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,4,,5.0,10/26/2015,Hello everyone I went to this cheesecake factory restaurant and had a waitressed help me out on her training day her name is Stephanie she took very good care of us and also did five star job very good customer service and had a smile on her face the whole time and very respectful thank you so much for your great service Stephanie
Patricia G.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,68,4,4.0,1/28/2014,"Love CCF, burgers are great except the turkey burger.  Chicken tenders with honey mustard dip is delicious.  Chilaquiles, enchiladas, especially the tiramisu cake is delicious!! I bought an entire tiramisu cake for a bday and all my guests were impressed :-)"
Jenn B.,"Oakland, CA",902,603,209,3.0,1/11/2012,"This is your standard cheesecake factory. I'm sure we've all been to one at least once. Yes, the wait is definitely shorter than the one at Fashion Valley, but my goodness, the service can be extremely slow.  The last time I was here with my family, it took nearly an hour for them to bring out our food after we ordered, and the restaurant wasn't even full."
Ana M.,"Chula Vista, CA",97,125,8,4.0,12/7/2011,"Much better than the Mission Valley Cheesecake, like WAY better.  I have never had to wait for a table.  The servers are super nice-unlike the rude waiter that was at the mission valley one that made me feel like a total loser for eating my sandwich alone rather than with a friend.  The food is delish. I love this place."
Mark DM L.,"San Diego, CA",2514,35,95,2.0,11/30/2011,"I ordered my steak, with peppercorn and they put lots of pepper on top.  at least they got the blackened sides perfectly."
Emily G.,"Lowell, MA",0,40,11,4.0,3/26/2014,"Always excellent service, the wait is never long for takeout even when the restaraunt is really busy. My only complaint is they run out of certain cheesecake flavors frequently but there's enough other flavors."
Ashira P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,8,,3.0,5/19/2016,"I really enjoy going to the cheese cake factory with my family, we order for pick up a lot. This location is just not the greatest unfortunately I live in the woods. I used to go to the cheese cake factory in fashion valley mall. Busy but a lot better service, and food. Today, I had a hard time picking something to eat over the phone. I called and placed an order and then called back to change my order to a salad because, I decided I didn't want to eat a bunch of carbs after eating three scoops of icecream.  As I waited on the phone for about 7 minutes then I finally spoke to someone and changed my order and then he wanted to place me on hold again to have me speak with a manger and I told him that I was put on hold, and I will be picking up my salad in 25-30 minutes and he said okay, thank you. My sister picked up my salad and there was no cheese on the endive salad, no butter for the bread, I wasn't hungry anyways and had given it to my mother."
Sarah K.,"Redmond, WA",339,438,75,4.0,11/23/2011,"The first time I went to Cheesecake Factory was in 2009 in Anaheim, we had been on vacation then and I had said to hubby that I wanted to have dinner at Cheesecake Factory. His response was ""what about the main course"". He thought they only did Cheesecake! So fast forward to this October, it was my birthday, the second year running I was thousands of miles away from friends and family (last year we were travelling around Australia).  I wanted Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. I wasnt bothered about an appetizer or entree here. I just wanted Cheesecake. Hubby had a pumpkin pecan Cheesecake slice whilst I had a Chocolate Chip Cookie dough cheesecake slice. The cheesecake was good, the place was nice. Why 4 stars, well the server was slow, they didnt even acknowledge it was my birthday. I obviously wasnt expecting anything free but a ""happy birthday"" would not have gone amiss! I think I will stick to the Fashion Valley location next time."
