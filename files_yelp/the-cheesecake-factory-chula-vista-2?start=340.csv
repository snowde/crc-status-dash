Rizzo V.,"San Diego, CA",1,7,,2.0,9/18/2015,"Went with 6 people and it was disappointing. The food took about 45 minutes to arrive and when it did, lacked any flavor at all. Again there was six of us so one bad meal out of six wouldn't have been too bad but no one was satisfied with their food. Really high prices for the poor tasting food they delivered."
don t.,"San Diego, CA",0,31,,2.0,6/18/2015,"Received my ""margarita"" pizza last night, with friends celebrating a college graduation.  Apparently a prefab product with the small cubes of mozzarella Not melted, the pizza slightly warm, the crust quite thick out at the edges: un margarita style.   Taste was just ok.   I am not compelled to return."
Marica A.,"San Diego, CA",44,20,22,4.0,5/18/2014,"I gave it 4 stars because I got seated in less than 20 mins (seating can take up to 30-45 mins depending what time of the day you come; I arrived 2 hrs after it opened). But friendly service, great food (stuffed mushrooms was delish), great coffee and GREAT cheesecake. Yah, I'd come back!"
Ness R.,"Chula Vista, CA",68,32,9,4.0,4/9/2014,"4 stars, not 5 for brunch... This place just needs to step up their bacon game. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes... They were TDF! Possibly, the best pancakes I've ever had!"
Alex A.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,9,,3.0,8/8/2014,"Really good food, cheesecake is Amazing!!  But service is about 1-2 stars. Management keeps apologizing through different tables instead of making sure that things are getting done"
Sandra S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/23/2015,"I went there last Sunday, it was my first time, I ordered stuffed tortilla tacos,  the  worst corn tortilla I never had,  not even close to a tortilla definition,  insipid plate, I do not recommend mexican food on this place, I dont know about the rest of the menu. Also, slow service."
Kendrea P.,"Richmond, TX",6,41,8,4.0,1/20/2014,Every time I go I get the corn cakes. They are delicious. Long wait but who doesn't have a long wait on weekends it means they are doing something right to draw in customers. One time I went it took a long time for our food to come out but the manager came out an apologized and offered us a drink. Very sweet but I didn't except the offer. Stuff happens but I appreciated him apologizing. Food is always hot and good!
Justin R.,"Chula Vista, CA",44,17,,3.0,6/10/2014,This is my go to place when I'm looking for a great meal on any occasion.  The Famous Factory Meatloaf never disappoints & the service is friendly and professional.  It's good to have a solid place to go when your looking to have a great lunch or dinner any time.
Gia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,9,3,4.0,5/3/2014,"I always enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. It's a great place to socialize. They have a great wine selection. My personal favorite is the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc. The menu is very extensive. It can be tough to make a choice. The entree portions are huge - good to share. The Chicken Madeira, Bang Bang Shrimp, & Louisiana Chicken pasta are my favorites. The avocado spring rolls and tuna tartare are delicious starters. I like their Caesar salad too. The cheesecakes are fantastic!!! I've tried so many different things there & they've all been good. Don't expect gourmet, but expect good, consistent food that has something for everyone."
Maida I.,"San Diego, CA",2,94,13,4.0,1/12/2014,"Met my friends for dinner here at 4pm.  I don't eat here often so I didn't know they had a happy hour menu.  I ordered the nachos off the happy hour menu for only $5. I didn't expect that to come out on a big plate w/ a big portion.  There was 3 of us & we all shared.  Not knowing the nachos would be such a big portion I also ordered the Thai Chicken Wraps.  It is so delicious, fresh & made for 2 meals.   Service was good- our waitress came and checked on us often & refilled our drinks."
Robert B.,"Chula Vista, CA",20,130,50,5.0,7/8/2011,"I had just cooked fresh broccoli, mash potatoes from scratch and grilled rib eye steaks. BUT.. I was craving Cheesecake. What better place. I was greeted by a flawless waitress named Tiffany! (5 stars) I started off with a Ritz Martini - Courvoisier, Champagne, Cointreau and Pomegranate Juice. It was made to perfection. Thanks Chris. Remember, I came for cheesecake and that's all.  I ordered Fried Calamari - Fried Light and Crisp. Served with Garlic Dip and Cocktail Sauce. Tasty. Another Ritz Martini... and another. What can I say. Hopefully you'll catch my drift. Than it was time for the dessert. Brownie Sundae Cheesecake - Walnut-Brownie Cheesecake and White Chocolate Mousse Covered with Hot Fudge and Almonds. It was so good I wanted to slap your momma. I only ate half. I promise. I have no idea who ate the other. Special thanks to the staff! Especially Cynthia! She's great! Make sure you admire the decor. Very beautiful. Enjoy!"
Marisol S.,"Chula Vista, CA",195,60,186,5.0,5/15/2011,"Ohhh I love Cheesecake factory!! Every time I eat here and anything I eat here,  I never get disappointed.   My loves:  Appetizer would have to be Calamari!! I love their garlic aoli sauce.  I love their corn cakes and their stuffed mushroom.  I also really like their avocado eggrolls with that special sauce they use with their bang bang chicken. I love their soups as well, they are pretty tasty. Lunch/Dinner: Tied for my #1 spot are: Miso Salmon (has the miso sauce with a bit of sweet teriyaki on the salmon), Shrimp Scampi pasta (large shrimp with a special crust and the roasted garlic and the delicious creamy garlic sauce) OMG I fell in love the first time I ate it and keep falling in love, every time I eat it!!) #2 spot would have to be their Chicken madera, #3 would be the Steak diane (with the grilled onions) ooh my, their herb crusted salmon.   Dessert: My ultimate favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake.  OMG!! Just amaazing!  But if you are on a diet, share the low carb cheesecake! It's pretty darn good too! Drinks: Non alcoholic would have to be the sweetened Green tea!  OMG it's free refills. Alcoholic: Best mint mojito I have ever had!  It's perfectly balanced, the sweetness, the mint, and the mix of alcohol.  It will creep up on you. So beware.   The portions are pretty big and the next day, I look forward to leftovers!  I do love their free bread!  Especially the brown bread with the oat on top."
Ca T.,"San Diego, CA",3,122,,3.0,4/16/2015,"The food is good, not amazing, but good enough. I just can't get over how ridiculously dirty the floors are. I don't know about you, but when I'm eating at a sit down restaurant and paying about $15+ a plate, I'd expect the floors to look like they've cleaned them at least once since opening up. And what is it with the slippery floors? Lawsuit waiting to happen."
William H.,"Murrieta, CA",8,41,24,4.0,3/5/2014,Fried Mac n cheese is the best I've ever had no joke! Bar drinks were a little weak for what they cost. Overall I like cheese cake factory there is going to be something for everybody on their menu. (Its literally 15 pages long!) Kind of overwhelming  but nice they have so much to offer. The other menu items I have tried are consistent and service was friendly
Issack J.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,7,2,4.0,12/3/2014,Food and service was good. No complaints from my party of 8. Best appetizer is the avocado egg rolls. Don't forget to get some amazing cheesecake.
Jay J.,"Puyallup, WA",3,22,31,1.0,2/11/2015,"I have tried this place six times, but I am now convinced this restaurant has zero standards.  They food is served is sub par, and the service is without a doubt horrible.  The servers always forget, small asked items such as lemons.  When a question is asked this is there response ""uhm I think so, well I'm not sure"" , well if you are unsure I am as well.  Talk about the food items they have an abundance of choices; However, it either has no seasoning, or way to much to mask the zero flavor.  I have tried salad which was wilted, pork chops which were dry and not seasoned, to there steak dianne which was bland, rubbery and very little seasoning.  Each time the manager would ask would you like something else, or a complimentary cake and each time I declined.  It is not about the free items, it is about making and producing a great product.  If Chef Ramsey ever came here how disappointed would he be.  There are so many choices and low to mediocre food and service no thanks.  I will not return with my family."
Mikey H.,"San Diego, CA",352,821,2768,5.0,2/28/2009,"One word:  CHEESECAKE! via e-mail Me: Cheesecake Factory? She: Traffic is awful at 5:30 Other She: Wait a minute, last time we went somewhere close to Mikey, and before that close to you...it's time that it is close to me. Me: So Cheesecake Factory? She: There or D'Lish... OS: or Zorba's? She: Let's do Zorba's for lunch some other time...let's go have cheesecake Me: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY! (I always get my way) Yeah, it's a chain.  But it is always consistent no matter which location you go to.  The service is always pleasant, not much personality, but friendly and efficient.   My favorite dish is one of their most popular ones: CHICKEN MADEIRA Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce.  Served with Mashed Potatoes. That night I realized that this is the only dish I order when I'm here, and this is the only dish I will order.  But I don't come here very often for obvious reasons...I'd weigh a zillion pounds.  This dish is so good, that my friends order it as well and share.  Whatever you do, DO NOT order the Asian food...if you want orange chicken...go to Peking Chop Suey in North Park. We also order an appetizer, and I really wanted the fried macaroni and cheese...who ever came up with this artery clogging, fat inducing dish deserves a Nobel for coming up with this.  If you fry it, people will eat it.  The girls didn't want it, so we settled for the hot dip of Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Shallots, Garlic and a Mixture of Cheeses Served Bubbly Hot with Tortilla Chips and Salsa. (Okay, so sometimes I don't get my way.) We then ordered a BLT salad: Crisp Iceberg Lettuce Covered with Fresh Tomato, Bacon, Chopped Egg and Blue Cheese. Served with Our Bacon Dressing.  This was really good...it was like the sandwich without the bread.  I normally don't have a salad, but we split it, and I didn't have lunch so, WTH. For dessert I ordered the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  It's the only one I consistently order.  Except for Hawaii, where they have some kind of passion fruit thing.  Speaking of which, they serve this tropical iced tea which is pretty good.  The girls shared some macadamia nut thing...I'm selfish and never share my cheesecake, well except with the partner...and even that's hard for me to do.  What can I say, I just loves dessert.  I like this location because it's never really that crowded and it's adjacent to a mall.  The only thing that sucked was that I needed to pick up something out in El Cajon.  I took the exit to the 125 and then I got hit with a toll for taking the expressway.  I couldn't turn around and go back, and I couldn't blaze through without getting a ticket.   So I paid the 3 bucks...I know it's not much, but I wasn't prepared...so there I was scrambling in my car for loose change, on a freeway on ramp, with a couple cars behind me...WTH?  What happened to just getting on a freeway???"
Jan L.,"Bonita, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/24/2014,"First time having a bad experience. We went on Monday night to have dinner. We sat down and waited for over 10mins before anyone ever actually noticed us or even bothered to offer service. The place was pretty busy, but still gives no reason for the horrible service. We finally decided to leave. I did inform a Manager of this, however I felt as if she didn't try to fix the situation and keep us there for dinner. She just said oh okay. Uhm okay then?"
Angel G.,"Spring Valley, CA",13,2,,2.0,10/4/2013,"This is my first time here and the star ratings pretty much tell you how my experience has been. I gave it a second star cause the bread is good... But that's all so far. Had to send back the appetizer cause it was just tough and salty...gross. My meal finally arrived and it was mediocre at best, the rating was lowering by the minute, but the cheese cake brought the second star back up. Overall, I would come back for dessert only."
Neil P.,"San Diego, CA",427,146,2,3.0,7/29/2011,"Cheesecake factory is known for their food. I ordered the farmhouse burger. The description sound really good and even looked extremely good when it was delivered, however, the burger was lacking taste. I did not taste and flavor from the burger at all other than the beef. It could have used a little salt. Service was excellent which does not reflect on the burger!"
