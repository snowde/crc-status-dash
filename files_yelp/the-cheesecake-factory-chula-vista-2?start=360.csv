Steve S.,"Bonita, CA",1,9,,1.0,6/21/2015,"Went there for Mother's Day breakfast and had to send two out of four dishes back...came back with hair on them...went today for Father's Day breakfast..eggs Benedict came with almost one FRIED (would have sworn the TWO eggs should have been poached but what do I know) egg between both muffins...didn't care to get hair so just had them take it back....the wait staff is nice but the kitchen staff needs to be torn down and rebuilt.....out of 9 total orders in two visits 3 were correct...oh yes two of the dishes we asked for fruit and got fried potatoes...didn't even bother saying anything about that....GM came over offered to replace it but after having sent back order last time and getting hair and not just one hair (it was long hair and short hairs throughout dish) didn't want to risk it....they have lost our business forever!!! Again, staff great but don't risk sending food back that is wrong...no accident when you get hair in your food and its UNDER the food..."
Cristine E.,"Chula Vista, CA",48,43,52,5.0,11/10/2013,Simply the best! I love their small plate options and salads! So delicious.love this is near my place and this is the go to since it closes late
Dave B.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,39,,4.0,8/11/2013,Been to this location way too many times to even keep track of but one thing that is always on spot is the food.. I have yet to order something that was not tasty.. and the deserts!! OMG.. the Strawberry Shortcake is very good for those people that might have Overdosed on some of the Cheesecake that they offer.
Roberto C.,"University City, San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/7/2014,Have mixed feelings about this place. It's not really that good.... There's too many things on the menu which makes it confusing and hard to choose from. The food is average. It's seriously overpriced for what it really is. There's always a line and the staff is mean. 2 stars is really what it deserves.
Ma B.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,4.0,8/30/2011,"How do they do it?  I mean, how is the quality of their food (good or bad) so consistent between all the different locations.  I've been to the locations in Chula Vista, Fashion Valley, The Grove, and even in downtown Seattle and the food tastes, looks and presented EXACTLY the same no matter where I go.  There is some comfort in knowing I will be getting exactly what I ordered. The Bellagio Chicken is my absolute favorite!  Although the menu is so extensive that I am barely qualified to talk about most of what's on there.  I knocked down a star because sometimes the wait staff can be a bit unattentive.  Forgetting to refill my water, I can forgive, but having to wait a LONG time to get my bill when I have 2 little kids who were done with their food a million years ago (and the crayons just don't cut it after a while) and are ready to leave is not so cool."
On Blast A.,"San Diego, CA",2003,198,50,4.0,2/2/2013,"I really try to stay away from this place only because the menu gives me anxiety.  Looking at it you'd think that it was the final-final installment of both the harry potter and twilight series put together it's that long.  Anyhow here's what we ordered: Vietnamese Tacos Chicken Bellagio Turkey Burger with a Poverty Salad (not really poverty) Vietnamese Tacos were amazing.  Tastes like a vietnamese sammich hugged by a fluffy steamed bun!  Man were those flavors rich.  It wasn't bland or to salty.  Just right!  Not sure if there was any MSG in there, but I did feel something coursing through my veins that snuck into my eyelids doing pull-ups and making them heavy.  The chicken bellagio was also delicious.  There was a fried chicken filet on top that wasn't greasy... but the pasta was a bit.  I could have grabbed a hand full and rubbed it on the wall and it would become transparent.  Light on the oil next time PLEASE!  The pasta overall was worth the price and the size is decent for two people... that is if you step on the scale and it doesn't read ""GET OFF!""  My turkey burger on the other hand was okay.  Nothing special at all though cheesecake factory thinks otherwise and tags it with a $9 price tag.  The salad it comes with is just some plain greens with some tangy sauce.  woo hoo nothing to brag about.  It's the only healthy dish I could find that I could compromise with my gf who seemingly has a plot to sabotage my diet day in and day out.  Overall this place was good.   Service... eh.  The lady never refilled my water... gave her a 5% tip for that.  Use it to buy some class."
mark d.,"Honolulu, HI",125,119,14,5.0,3/30/2013,"I love the cheesecake factory.  Everything I eat here is delicious.  The wait is never too long.  The decorations are nice.  The service is usually good.  The food is always satisfying.  One of the only menus where I can close my eyes and pick and it's good.  My favorites include:  chicken bellagio, chicken madera, the big burrito, guacomole egg rolls, and my wife loves the stuff chicken enchiladas."
Thomas M.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,31,5,4.0,2/14/2014,"Yummy food, love the kobe beef burger.  Service could have been better, but our server seemed a little bit distracted."
Shel S.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/3/2015,"Food was great and our waitress was always attentive. We went to have a celebration dinner for a friend and though, it was not for a bday, they brought her out a small dessert. Only reason for the 4 star is that the wait time was almost 20 mins and then to receive our food was just as long, maybe a little longer. Would have ordered cheesecake but we were all so full with their big proportioned dinner meals. Satisfied our appetites."
Richard C.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,4,4.0,3/16/2014,"Waited 15 min to be seat, which isn't bad at all for a Saturday night.  Service was good, good was great.  We enjoyed the buffalo blasts, steak dinner and club sandwich. No complaints here."
Brianna U.,"Chula Vista, CA",20,8,,5.0,5/3/2013,"I love eating here! The atmosphere is amazing, calm, and the decorations are beautiful. I always order one of their burgers, and they are delicious every time. Excellent customer service and brilliant presentation of the food. I try to eat out here as often as I can!"
B W.,"Chula Vista, CA",26,71,,2.0,11/30/2014,"It's a factory alright...Just don't eat here during the kitchen shift change.  I used to like this place as the breadth of the menu offered something for everyone and in a diverse crowd everyone could find something to like.  Well in a recent excursion at about 2:45 we discovered what it is like to be caught between lunch and dinner.  Waitress was adequate and standard student type.  Poor child was sacrificed to our table due to the crappy kitchen she was serving.  My pasta was luke warm on arrival and very late--our food came nearly an hour after seating (and quickly ordering).  My wife's Tuna tartare was not to her liking.  I did not finish the pasta and my wife commented on it being hardly warm.  I said I would take it home and the waitress took it away to parts unknown and did not bring it back for ten minutes.  So...just my imagination...it goes back to the kitchen where my wife's comments are repeated and it is stuck with fingers and examined...or worse...and then brought back to me.  Well, after that, it is not coming home with me.  I also noticed that someone at another table returned a blender drink to the bar with something in it.  They took the Tuna Tartare off the bill, but by then the damage was done.  Declining performance...after they had been likely 3.5-4 range.  Kitchen at shift change (I am assuming that is the problem) is a mess.  You would do better at In and Out nearby."
Shamyran S.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,11,,3.0,2/27/2014,"I like the pastas. They have great service every time I go. The dessert is actually my favorite part!  I love trying a new one every time because they are all so good, and i share with my family of 4. They have valet right in front of the restaurant. Minus one star because the wait is always crazy."
Jesse G.,"San Diego, CA",7,15,2,1.0,1/22/2015,"Where to begin...the bread that I look forward to was hard and cold, I asked for warm bread and they brought out pretty much the same like it was under a heat lamp though. We then ordered some Mac n cheese balls as an appetizer and it never came. We got our entrees and those were good. My date asked for a free cheesecake for the app mess up, the waiter said ""I'll see what I can do."" We order one cheesecake for dessert to share, no spoons were brought with it. The bill came, there was the $7.95 for the cheesecake along with our entrees. Thanks for nothing Cheesecake factory Chula Vista. Alexander S., get some customer service training. UPDATE: Just spoke to the he manager who said she can't comp a dessert and offered to give us an appetizerto go. After stuffing myself with the entree and cheesecake, why the hell would I want an appetizer to go? Incompetence. Moral of the story...Cheesecake Factory in Chula Vista at 2015 Birch Road, you just lost two customers."
Carlos A.,"San Diego, CA",60,23,2,2.0,1/19/2015,"Just got home from having dinner at Cheesecake Factory Otay Ranch. Service was very good and our waitress was nice but the food we ordered left a lot to be desired. I've eaten a few times at the Fashion Valley location and don't remember the food being this bad. Our waitress brought bread and butter out but the bread seemed like it had been sitting out a while. Whatever, we were hungry so we slapped some butter and we ate some of it. For our appetizer, we ordered the Buffalo Blasts. I usually always order these but let me just say that on tonight's order I never found the chicken in some of them. It also seemed like the inside of them weren't cooked all the way. I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. First piece of chicken that I put in my mouth had to spit out because it felt like I was chewing on rubber. It was honestly pretty disgusting. The pasta was not cooked well and the Alfredo sauce had no flavor. My friend said her order was ok. We did not have any cheesecake tonight. I just got home and now my stomach is starting to bother me. I'm sure it's something that I ate at Cheesecake Factory. I might be back for cheesecake someday (I'm not gonna lie and be like I'm never going back there!) lol but I most likely will not eat at this location again."
Jen H.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,72,9,4.0,10/2/2011,"Honestly whenever I take friends or family here, nobody is ever disappointed.  There's something for everyone to enjoy here.  They have a great kids menu for my very picky little eater.  The service is usually good.  And we are always ridiculously stuffed.   I enjoy the hibachi steak and bang bang chicken and shrimp.  My hubby likes the orange chicken. My daughter always gets the pasta.  If you have room for dessert, red velvet cheesecake is delicious!!"
Amiee L.,"San Diego, CA",326,506,886,2.0,5/23/2009,"Had a truly odd experience last night for a dinner.  We sat down on the patio for dinner and everything was fine...our waiter came out and brought us our drinks and gave us our bread then oddly he put our order in and then left....ran around the corner (probably for a smoke) but it was odd because we saw him leave through the patio.  So, then we sat.....for awhile....no refills, no more bread, no food. He finally came back to your table and asked for we wanted more bread but no dinner yet.  Once the dinner came my order was totally wrong.  I ordered: Clam Chowder Soup & Salad with extra croutons.  I got: Potato Soup & Salad with no croutons.  The croutons thing was fine but when he brought me the soup he said ""We didn't have clam chowder but here's potato and it's the same color so maybe it will be ok"" (What an odd thing to say)  Lastly, when our bill came he kept on bringing us the wrong bill for the wrong table. Maybe he was just having a bad day....though he didn't seem to try very hard to make up for all the mistakes."
Doug A.,"National City, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/9/2011,"Went the day before Mother's Day to avoid crowd. We had a large party and called ahead of time to give them a heads up since they do not take reservations. Got there on time at 4;30pm. An hour and a half later, they finally seated us, even thou, other large parties arrived after us and were seated in front of us. Complained to manager, and he got us seated. He said he would bring out some free appetizers for us and only brought out 6 avocado rolls for 16 people. WTF? They then did not take our drink order for almost 20 minutes, our diner order for over 30 minutes. We finally started eating 1 hour after being seated. Then they forgot one of the kids orders. Most were happy with their food, but I got the large grande burrito, which was filled with white rice, not even Mexican rice, and very little chicken. So I basically paid for a $12 rice burrito. This is BS!"
Vivian G.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",19,1,,5.0,1/31/2014,"This specific location is our favorite eat spot; family, date night, birthdays, etc. We have always had the best customer service and if we had to wait, it wasn't longer than 15 minutes when you compare it to Fashion Valley location (and I have three kids, youngest is three).  The food is always great,  the complimentary bread is a favorite, and the menu gives you lots of options."
Alvin C.,"San Diego, CA",6,11,12,4.0,4/8/2013,"Pretty delicious shepard's pie! I don't usually go here that much, but when I do it's either gonna be the shepard's pie or chicken Madeira. :) Yuuuuuuuuum!"
