Carlos H.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,43,29,3.0,3/1/2015,"When you call for take-out food, the lady sounds dis-organized or busy and made some mistakes in my order. Food is good if they don't make mistakes taking the order."
John S.,"Chula Vista, CA",41,7,,3.0,12/22/2013,"My wife and I are regulars here due to it's proximity to our home and it's late hours. Unfortunately, both the food and service is hit and miss. I have had great meals and the very next time have everything completely horrific. I have had wonderful waiters and waitresses and I have had servers not check on us for 20+ minutes, forget to bring bread, take their break in the booth behind us without anyone else covering. So what does it tell me? Poor management and inconsistent service. It's too bad, because it has the capacity to be a very good restaurant. So if you decide to go there, you'd better hope for one of the good servers, and hopefully the good chef is on that night."
Jessica J.,"San Diego, CA",23,21,6,1.0,8/1/2012,"Waited 10 minutes, no bread. No silverware, what am I suppose to spread the butter with.... My finger?? Lunch pizza was awful... One side of the crust burnt and other side was uncooked. They forgot my salad and it took them another 10 minutes to bring it out. They're specialty must be sandwiches (besides cheesecake) since that seems to be the only thing they got right. Asked for dessert... another FAIL!!!  And did I mention this was during lunch time on a Monday... restaurant was fairly empty and a full staff.  What were they all doing?"
Jenna G.,"San Diego, CA",23,81,1,3.0,12/14/2010,"Went here with my family for a last minute dinner date.  As expected, the menu is enormous, so hard to choose just one thing!  We ordered a bottle of wine while we were looking at the menus.  The wine took quite some time to bring out, no big deal.  The servers delivered the bottle, but then seemed to disappear, never coming to check on our waters, or see if we wanted more drinks or wine. Everyone was happy with their meals, I would just recommend the service step up a notch."
Renee R.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,45,5,1.0,1/18/2016,"This was my first time at this location and probably my last. Hubby and I came here to check the place out because next month we are treating a friend for her birthday and wanted to see if this would be a good place to go. We came here Sunday around 3:30 pm. Before we got seated, I used the restroom, and had to complain to the desk that the restroom needed attending to. It was filthy! I use a walker, and had to maneuver through paper towels that were strewn all over the floor Waited 10 min. for a table, was seated, waited another 20 min. to have our order taken, I asked for water ( I was informed that they don't serve straws with their water and was asked if I wanted one, I said Yes, and never got it. No biggie) I ordered a Grilled Chicken Avocado Club sandwich and sweet potato fries ($1 extra). Hubby ordered Roasted Turkey Sandwich and fries. We waited over 30 min. for our food. The place was pretty packed and all around us were tables of 4-13 people, so I knew it would be a wait. When our food finally came, my sandwich was cut in half, piled with thick cut tomatoes-3 halves on EACH half of sandwich! There was 1 tiny piece of HARD bacon on each sandwich, a smear of avocado, and a piece of cold chicken ,which had NO GRILL MARKS ( thought it was a ""GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH""?) and the meat on each was the size of a 50 cent piece! The sweet potato fries were barely warm, and tasted like they had been microwave re-heated, and the plate was scalding hot! Hubby said his fries were barely warm too. The only good thing was the cheesecake. We ordered the Hershey's cheesecake and split it. I didn't bother complaining because they were so busy, and we had already spent 2 hours there, and had had enough. I was really disappointed. Guess we will find somewhere else to take our friend to for her birthday.  :("
Ryan H.,"Redlands, CA",43,46,70,4.0,4/17/2011,"Me and my wife really enjoy this place. It is so nice inside and they have a great menu and a really nice bar.  We both love the miso salmon and steak diane. The mashed potatoes that come with the steak diane are amazing. Also, service is usually excellent.  Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory."
Mau L.,"San Diego, CA",114,123,69,5.0,4/14/2011,"Happy hour prices are awesome. I always order 3 dishes from the Small Plates section and my bill is never more than $20.  Small Plates are perfect portion sizes before going to the movies. I just wished they also served red velvet cupcakes, not the cheesecake red velvet hybrid. I walk to B&N to buy a red velvet cupcake."
Samantha H.,"Lakewood, CA",1,5,,2.0,7/24/2014,"Came here before and service was terrible, thought to give it another go. Sadly still lacking. Who ever is training these servers must be at fault. Our server was polite and kind but completely oblivious to the tables trying to flag her down. It was laughable how oblivious she was. Not to mention that the burger I ordered had non of the exceptions I asked for no mayo and no onions isn't that complicated."
Antonio H.,"San Diego, CA",2,2,,5.0,1/20/2013,"My first time to the restaurant was unforgettable: It was the 3rd of January, my 1st San Diego trip of the year. The decor was like the inside of a palace. It was lunchtime, I had the Mac & cheese burger. It was delicious. But the piece of resistance was the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake, a cheesecake to die for. That experience has made me decide I wanna live near there when I get my 1st San Diego home & visit the restaurant at every chance I get. You should too, you'll be thankful."
Angel C.,"Honolulu, HI",90,222,265,4.0,2/1/2009,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory one too many times thanks to family or friends..though I'm not complaining. My last visit was a week ago for my birthday. Here are the dishes I'd recommend: Miso Salmon - The flavor and texture of the salmon was just right with that miso sauce..mmm. I loved how the salmon sat on a bed of rice cooked just right. The four snap peas served as nice garnish and an extra crunch. Chicken Bellagio - This dish is best if you're not on a diet. It's part of their limited-time menu, so order it while you can. The dish is basically two breaded chicken breasts, topped with prosciutto (Italian ham) and arugula. All of this sits on a small bed of spaghettini and some sort of cream sauce. Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo - Filling and comforting, period. Other notes: I'm a huge fan of pasta, but I'm not fond of CF's pasta dishes, besides the Chicken Bellagio. I'll order their smoothies only if I feel like splurging since they're a bit pricey. One of the servers named Josh still works here, and he is as friendly and prompt as ever. Overall, I love CF!"
Vicente A.,"San Diego, CA",17,17,4,5.0,6/7/2013,This place is awesome!!Some days it us busy...but most of the time its great to eat lunch and dinner. Great place for a dinner date and is close to the AMC.
Richard V.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,21,,5.0,9/26/2013,This is by far my favorite place to eat. I order something different every time and have never been disappointed. It has a wide variety of food to eat to please everyone's appetite. Excellent!
Cathy S.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,13,1,3.0,11/4/2012,"Ok well, we go into this cheesecake factory often, last week when we went we sat outside as usual, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to get to our table, wth is that.  Ive waitressed all my life and still do and I know that a waitress or waiter should greet your table within two minutes and if you are slammed see if you can get a co worker to help or send the busser over with waters and bread but NOooooooooo...........I was very dissapointed.  Also, we wanted the heat lamp on and it took two others to try and light it and STILL could not get it, they ended up moving us after our server took our drink orders.  She had a party of ten next to us and she was in full force paying attention to them.  newsflash to the   NOT seat a party at a table before checking with he waitress that has the big party to see if she is caught up. I believe her name was Victoria or something, who knows......after we moved, she came and took our order and that was the last we saw of her, she never came and checked on us at all, altho the guy server next to our table was kind enough to ask if we were doing ok.  Obviously we left him the tip.  on another note, we usually get the chinese chicken and share and they kitchen is always so kind to split it unless its our waiter/waitress that does it but this time it wasn't and i was like WTH......Im not even hungry anymore after waiting a half hour to order. Very disappointed on the service that night!!!"
Berenice D.,"Chula Vista, CA",399,215,64,4.0,10/24/2010,"To end my fabulous weekend with the boo we decided to grab a bite at Cheesecake factory after the movies. I was starved !  First of all, we waited more than 10 minutes to sit which is why i give it a 4 out of 5. We were told 10 minutes and I get very impatient and angry when im hungry.  We were finally seated and service was amazing. Our server Tammy was so helpful. So damn quick. Everything came so fast. We did end up ordering way too much food.  We started out with the calamari. After eating the bread and calamari....I was already full... Then here comes the ""ultimate eggplant sandwich.""  I took a look at it and was full. The sandwich is MASSIVE. I always have this problem when I go eat out. I try to order food that is not messy. As I was saying.......they should have an option next to the menu that says ""M"" for messy. My sandwich was too big to eat so quickly. It got a bit soggy and I could not finish it. It was tasty but too much.  The lover ordered the meatloaf and he was not even hungry. The portions were ridiculous. So much food. We could of just had 2 appetizers and called it a night.  Overall.... I had a great time here. I'll come back but not ordering all that food."
Sandy E.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,14,,3.0,8/4/2012,"Stay away from Monique V as your waitress. We love to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  We go there often.  Usually our service is pretty good but my most recent trip this week would have been my last if my kids did not like to go there so often. If we get seated in an area where Monique is serving, we will asked to get reseated or leave.    Her service is slow.  We spent $331.00 on our meal within our group and I had to go hunt her down and pay my bill since she had not been out to our table in 15 minutes.  I asked to speak to the manager but the guy leading the guests to the tables said I had to speak to our waitress.  Enjoy your unearned 18% tip, Monique V. Most of the time we get pretty good service and we enjoy the food.  The atmosphere is pretty good. I enjoy the Thai Chicken Pasta but there are many good dishes there."
Miggy F.,"Escondido, CA",0,211,51,5.0,9/23/2010,"I had not been to the cheesecake factory in a while, but I was glad that I went last night. In the time I've been gone they added some new items to their already huge menu. This time I had the Monterrey Burger. The Monterrey burger is big, so open wide, really wide if you want this one to fit in your mouth. It's presentation really impressed. Abundant greenery and thinly slice onions just the way I like them, Woah! is that half an avocado, sliced and shaped like a sea shell? All of this sits on a large sheet of cheese, and a fat patty cooked to your specification. Perhaps the biggest appeal to me was the ""secret sauce"" that comes with it.  What's in it? Option of fries or salad. I took the salad option with blue cheese dressing. Wow, there was some huge chunks of blue cheese in there. I was absolutely fabulous.  Anyways.  Don't be shy to try the Monterrey Burger it'll surely impress you too."
Eva A.,"National City, CA",23,132,40,4.0,8/12/2010,Love this location! My boyfriend and I have been here several times and each time the service has been spectacular. Yesterday we were able to experience happy hour where several of the appetizers and a few selected drinks were $5 a piece. The selected wells were $4 and domestics were $3.  We tried the Tex Mex Eggrolls which were delicious and the Bud Light was $3 a bottle. Our appetizer came out quick and they also gave us their complementary bread. We then ordered our entrees which I asked for the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich which came with fries and my choice of spicy buffalo sauce. It was definitely on the spicy side however was good none the less. My boyfriend had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which he enjoyed as well however mentioned it seemed like it had been sitting under the warming lamps for a while.  The bartender also made awesome Long Islands ($5 during happy hour) which I'll be ordering from here on out when I'm looking for an alcoholic drink from this location. The meals can be a little on the pricey side however for the quality food and awesome service I have no complaints!
Allison O.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",110,5,2,4.0,1/8/2014,"I came here for lunch on a Wednesday, so it wasn't too busy. the waitress knew the menu very well, and gave us suggestions on what to order. I settled on the southwest chicken salad with a side of green beans instead of fries. the sandwich was SO GOOD! I took away one star because the bread on the sandwich was a little too crispy and there was a little too much pepper on my green beans."
Lucy B.,"San Diego, CA",339,137,684,1.0,4/19/2010,"I ordered the tataki salad & they ran out. Then, I settled for another item on the menu & they ran out of that too! How does a popular restaurant like Cheesecake Factory run out of NOT ONE item on the menu... But TWO? The kitchen area has glass windows & when walking by, the person making salads with his gloved hand scratched his head, then continued mixing the salad with that same hand! Now I only go to the Fashion Valley location."
tyler k.,"San Diego, CA",51,35,8,4.0,6/3/2010,One of my favorite places to go for dessert! I just went to this location for the first time and they are a clean and friendly place.. i felt funny tho cause the staff was dressed all in white except a black tie.. But if you want a good meal someplace relaxing i would recomend The Cheesecake Factory..  My order white chocolate raspberry truffle sour dough baguette fresh baked
