Tina B.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",193,84,91,5.0,7/20/2017,Consistently this Cheesecake Factory is amazing. Happy hour is a great time to come here and the food choices are an excellent deal. I love their healthy menu- especially their white chicken chili with brown rice. The booths are big enough to fit 6 which is great! They also offer kids a little appetizer plate of bananas and bread. Don't leave here without trying their famous cheesecake. It's worth every calorie.

Nicole F.,"San Diego, CA",336,851,1978,3.0,11/30/2016,"I grant they are consistent....consistently all over the board with hits and misses. Not sure why we planned a last minute birthday party here... we didn't think it would be packed at 2pm on a Sunday but it was. Consequently, it was noisy and hard to visit with tablemates. Based on yelp reviews we opted to order one of the popular dishes call bang bang chicken and shrimp. This was a miss for both of us as half the plate was rice and the meal was too sweet. Where was the spice? You couldn't even recognize any shrimp. Another miss was the garlic noodles with shrimp. We asked our waitress if the shrimp were supposed to look like they did...especially compared to another person's jumbo shrimp on angel hair (that was a hit). The waitress had to go get the manager who told me she didn't understand why on the garlic noodles they chopped the shrimp up here and there. Especially noticeable as it is priced higher than the angel hair with which has beautiful jumbo shrimp!  Am I being too picky to complain about this when the meal is 20 bucks? No, it's 20 bucks! That's not cheap. And I don't think these shrimp are the expensive ones from Mexico either...probably the $7 per pound from Indonesia. Niece enjoyed her eggplant parmesan. Mom enjoyed her veggie burger but not the bread that came with it. Nephew's pasta was tiny. Dad's burrito was huge but filled with a couple pounds of rice! Another in our party thoroughly enjoyed her fried shrimp platter that came with jumbo fried shrimp. Their food is all over the map. If I ever find myself back here as a guest of someone's I'll probably opt for the salads as I had better luck with that last time."
Carlene R.,"San Diego, CA",107,384,565,2.0,1/3/2017,"My husband, daughter, and I ate here yesterday for lunch.  The service was slow and there were multiple times that the waiter was missing in action.  For example, once the hostess sat my family and I to our table, the waiter was missing for about 10 minutes.  When he came to our table, he welcomed himself, didn't apologize for his actions, and just took our order. Fastforwarding 20 minutes later, our food arrived, but the waiter didn't acknowledge us that the kitchen was running slow.  He didn't check on us if we needed anything else, didn't refill our beverages, didn't pick up at least one of our empty plates, and didn't tell us another waiter was going to take over.  I even over heard the other table behind me that the customer service was poor."
Caresse C.,"Chula Vista, CA",9,2,22,4.0,7/29/2017,"Been here many times being that it's so close to home. I receive great service every time I dine in. My family and I went for dinner today and surprisingly there was no wait. Our waitress Anna was very nice and attentive. We always get the calamari and buffalo wings for appetizers and they never disappoint. I always wanna try something new but I end up getting my favourite pasta, the Bistro Shrimp Pasta! Most of the time we don't get a slice of cheesecake being that we get sooo full from the bread, appetizers, and entrées. Though the Oreo cheesecake is my favourite!"
Irene L. N.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,1,1.0,11/5/2017,"We ate here to celebrate my birthday today. So I ordered their Hibachi skirt steak with mashed potatoes. To my dismay it comes with a paper on it too. I swallowed some, chewed some and found more. So we talked to the server, took the plate to show and inform the manager. She ask if we want to order a new one but don't have the appetite anymore. We are hoping that the manager would come out and talk to us but that didn't happen. We are so disappointed because we don't know if they are putting this kind of things seriously or just ignore it. How are they going to improve the service if they don't take the costumers seriously? We are not coming back here anymore."
Spring D.,"Chula Vista, CA",9,50,59,3.0,7/21/2017,I ordered a martini for starters that was yummy!! Then for Dinner I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta. The pasta came and it was a little on the spicy side. Okay not a little alot on the spicy side. It was still good but just too spicy for me.
Viviana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/12/2017,Had a great night here at Cheesecake Factory. Service and food was great. Recommend Evelyn's favorite pasta. I­t­ was delicious!
Kamry F.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,7,2.0,8/6/2017,"I would have given this one star if it wasn't for the host/hostesses and the great tasting food...  The host/hostesses were very polite, easy to talk to, and extremely attentive. The ambience is very nice, it gives you a more fancy type of feel, but in a family setting. I went in the middle of the afternoon on a work day, so the place was pretty empty. That being said, you would think it would be nice and clean. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The host sat us down in the booths in the back where the dome is. Every table around us has dirty dishes and FLIES. There were flies everywhere! Only reason I stayed was because my friend date was really craving the BangBang dish.  Our waiter didn't tend to us until 5 minutes after we got sat. Now, I work in restaurants - as a server, hostess, and manager. In every restaurant I worked, and even this location (my friends work here), you are supposed to stick to the 30 second rule. You have 30 seconds to tend to your table after they got sat to run them any drinks so they can drink while they browse the menu. Our waiter, instead, was hanging around the bar talking to his co-workers. When he finally came up to us, we said we were still browsing then he said ""alright then."" And walked away. He didn't take the time to get our drink orders (and we just wanted water), nor did he wait to answer my question. We had to wave him down for him to return. When he did, we asked for our waters and I asked if he could see if the kitchen could substitute my rice for quinoa. He told me he would check, but he did it with a slight attitude.  He came back about 10 minutes later with our waters, one was supposed to be with lemon, the other without. Just shows he wasn't paying attention... He tells me that he would be able to substitute, but for an up-charge. I said that was fine. We ordered two BangBangs, mine was supposed to be substituted with quinoa. When it came out, it was just brown rice. Instead of complaining, since the food was already made, I just told him I would keep it, but to not charge me for it. That was the last time I saw our waiter our entire visit. Ran out of water, no refills. I had to get up and ask, then get up again and ask for the box and check. I gave a $2 tip. I felt rude, but at least I gave something for the poor service (because I do understand that some places require you to tip out bussers, and I know he wasn't going to do any cleaning...)  Come to find out, his one other table was very unsatisfied as well. Cheesecake, I don't know how you choose people during your hiring process, or how/if you do orientations and training, but this man shouldn't be a server."
Andy R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,15,4,5.0,4/29/2017,". Thai Coconut Lime Chicken. Mmmmmmmmm x100. This was the first time I noticed this on the menu. I dine here 3 to 4 times a year and usually order my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta. This time I tried something different.  . I was amazed at the infusion of flavors this dish splashed my taste buds with. From eating through the piping hot chicken chunks then the mildly spicy coconut curry sauce and mushrooms and onions and ending with the chilled mango chunks in every bite, its hot, mildly-spicy, cold mixture provided a delightful foodgasmic experience. My mind was never this busy tasting each ingredient this dish had in every bite.  . I highly recommend this dish. Update: 7/22/2017 I ordered this dish last Wednesday. They added cashew nuts and the mango cubes were not served chilled. Please serve the mangoes chilled and I'll remember to request ""no cashews"" next time."
Christina H.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,2,1.0,8/26/2017,"We go to cheesecake because everything is always pretty consistent no matter which location.  Not the case for us last night. We waited over 45 minutes for any food to arrive at the table. The server said the kitchen ""lost the ticket"" the manager said the kitchen was ""backed up"". I'm sure the server just forgot to put the order in as all other tables around us who sat after us received their meals. I've been restaurant trainer and manager for over 10 years, so I know what that looks and sounds like. What was worse, the manager didn't even apologize he came up to say he was aware the food was taking long and offered us a calamari that had completely died under the line. I know because I saw a runner try to serve it 25 minutes earlier. The sauces, the plate and the lemon wedge were extremely hot... really nice gesture send out old food that was dead anyway to a couple with a 10 month old who have now been seated an hour without food. The sever completely ignored us instead of being more present and apologizing. We didn't need to be lied to, just acknowledged that our meal was ruined.  Just to put it into perspective how ignored our sever left us, he was taking an order next to us when we just decided to box the food since it still hadn't arrived. We agreed just to leave if he turned the other direction instead of coming up to as. And we did because he went out of his way to avoid us.  I've never ever ever left a restaurant like that before. In fact, I don't eve yelp other restaurants because I'm in the industry and I prefer to email or call but this situation left me so angry, starved for food and actual hospitality I do feel compelled to warn others.  We went to in and out and enjoyed the service and the food much better. That's my suggestion to others want consistency and hospitality!  Will not return to any location after this. We have options when it comes to dining out... money should be spent on places that care.  Last piece, the other manager was so completely unaware of our situation that she actually thanked us on the way out!! Clueless. Please retrain your team. Or hire people that care."
Michael L.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,17,71,4.0,7/13/2017,Came here to celebrate our daughter's birthday. This place never disappoints. My family and I love coming here. Their service was awesome. I just wish I got to jot down our servers name. She was very attentive and friendly. And their food is always on point. I definitely recommend this place.
Jenny L.,"San Diego, CA",79,47,,4.0,11/26/2016,"I've dined at The Cheesecake Factory before, but Wednesday night was my first time dining at this specific location. My friends and I came here for our Friendsgiving. We were seated immediately upon arrival. SERVICE: Out of all The Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, this one has the best service! All of our food came out within 20 min, which was surprising to me because I recall having to wait much longer than that at the Mission Valley and Downtown locations. And given that the restaurant was fairly busy at the time we were here, I thought that was impressive! Our waitress was very friendly, fun to talk to, and attentive! She recommended us some items on the cheesecake menu and would occasionally come by to refill our water and bread. She also came by to ask if we were satisfied with our food.  FOOD: I decided to try some menu items I haven't tried before. Here's what I tried: 1) Loaded tater tots: All hail the potato! Any foods with potato, I'm there. These loaded potato tots were amazing, especially with the sour cream and sriracha dip that came with it. I'm still thinking about these as I type. I'm tempted to order some for to-go tomorrow.  2) Chicken pasta: The pasta and marinara sauce ratio was spot on. The pasta was well done, and the marinara sauce was very tasty. The chicken pieces were a little dry, though.  3) Pumpkin cheesecake: I always expect nothing but good things when it comes to The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes. I enjoyed this -- it was creamy, was not overly sweet, and had enough pumpkin flavor.   RECOMMEND? Yes :) Nice location, good parking lot, great staff, overall good food."
Lucia P.,"San Ysidro, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/5/2017,"Loved everything,  the service, the place was clean, beautifully decorated, and the food was delicious."
Carlos C.,"Ignacio Zaragoza, Veracruz, Mexico",0,7,1,1.0,12/11/2017,"I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years, service here and food quality was amazing but now is just going straight to the floor. I been here for 1hour and 20 minutes  order all ready and nothing has come yet. Honestly avoid a bad experience at all cost very very bad restaurant place now"
Daryn P.,"Jacksonville, FL",40,23,11,2.0,6/4/2017,Terrible service first off! The waiter failed to notice that the bar completely forgot my drink and I had to bring it to his attention twice before I received it. Then I asked for my tiramisu to go and they brought me a pile of poop masquerading as tiramisu... this place does not deserve the money for this mediocre food... smh oh did I forget to mention this was my first time at Cheesecake Factory in 4 years! Shame how the service has diminished!!
Alex M.,"Chula Vista, CA",150,104,28,3.0,3/27/2017,"The quality is alright, and over priced. It's a new place to go for a date, but wouldn't go here if it was my choice"
Lizbeth F.,"Chula Vista, CA",62,175,240,4.0,9/22/2016,I used to like going to this location a lot because it was near my house and food was yummy!!! But things have changed in the last few months!!! And to so positive!  The atmosphere has changed as well! It just doesn't feel the same anymore! They got more competition like karinas buffalo wings and I thought they were going to try to keep their competitive advantage and do an external analysis to see how they can improve their internal objectives!  I'm sure they can gain and sustain their competitive advantage if they work harder! Come on cheesecake is an amazing restaurant! You can find anything you want from a steak to a salad!!! They have lots of different options! But food just doesn't taste the same anymore!  They need to work more on the quality of food! And also the service! The service is declining!  I still love cheesecake but i would Love to come back to this location instead of Going all the way to seaport village location!  I hope seaport village keeps up their hard work and not take for granted their competitive advantage they have!  I give 4 stars because all the times I have been coming here I leave with a memorable experience except Last time!!!!
Elizabeth B.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,24,19,1.0,3/16/2017,"This place sucks!!! My 11 year old daughter picked this place to have dinner after her Cotillion dance. She was so happy to be celebrated. We got here and sat down at 745. The server wasn't bad but it certainly took long for apps and salad to come out. Finally got our dinner almost an hour later and to make matters worse, they didn't bring my daughter's burger. The manager came over to apologize and said they were going to make her burger now and would be sure her meal was not on the ticket. Burger finally came after the rest of us were done eating. It was burnt and she was so upset. Ugh... just wanted to end this and leave! We get the bill and the burger is one there! Wth! Won't be going back. They ruined my daughter's celebration."
J C.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,26,9,5.0,3/26/2017,"Today our server Miguel N made all the difference cheesecake factory is always good but when your server is awesome it makes it even better.. Great service should always be applauded so aside from good food my parents and I enjoyed our day even more thanks to quick, attentive and kind service. It was a busy Sunday lunch but Miguel never kept us waiting thank you!"
