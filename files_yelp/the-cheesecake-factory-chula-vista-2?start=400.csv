Eliel M.,"Chula Vista, CA",48,5,,2.0,1/2/2016,"I never come to the Cheesecake factory but since my father was in town, I decided to give it a try. Put our name on the waiting list to eat, we were buzzed in about 5 minutes, which was nice seeing as it was supposed to be a 15 minute wait. Had our lunch , good and service was great. Before leaving, I thought that I might as well grab a slice of Cheesecake since that's what they are famous for. I asked for a slice and the girl behind the counter directed me to the guy at the register who was on the phone. I waited. Chatted with my dad for awhile, and finally asked the girl behind the counter if I could please get a slice of Cheesecake, she said that the guy at the register would have to help me, I told her that he can't, and that he's been on the phone for a long time. All she said was Sorry. Cmon people its a dam slice of Cheesecake! One bad experience ruins return business. Get it together and take care of your customers!"
Maggie F.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,53,121,5.0,7/24/2013,"My Sister and I ate here recently. I also take my BFF here frequently she likes the chicken asian salad..but I digress.. My Sister and I had dinner here. We were seated after a 7 minute wait..there was a line before us but we wanted to eat here, so we patiently waited for out turn. After being seated, our waiter TONY , greeted us and welcomed us to Cheesecake Factory, nice, very nice! He took our orders. I ordered the virgin Margarita (again, I am driving) and Sister had the iced green tea. Our drinks came promptly. And we ordered the mac and cheese burger with sweet potato fries. Sister likes her burger meduim well, they got it right! She did not complain, so that means it was right. I ordered the corn tortilla soup, and I did not regret it. It had the right amount of cilantro, strips of tortilla, the cheese was very good and not inundated with corn. The broth was perfect.  The bread that we were served with butter was really good. Tony kept checking on us if we needed anything. Attentive service, we liked that. And then I ordered the Thai Wrap...it was presented nicely with all the lettuce fresh and the veggies pretty good. I detected a previously frozen carrot strips (but I can let that pass, this time) on the platter, but the bean sprouts, cucumber, cabbage, grilled chicken strips and everything else were good, the 3 sauces were very good to be honest. Tony helped made the dining experience with my Sister pleasant. He was so attentive and serving us as if we were his only customer that night. Loved it!"
Cynthia C.,"La Mesa, CA",272,209,194,4.0,12/29/2009,"I love Cheesecake factory, large portions, good food!  The wait time at this TCF is always a bummer, but of all TCF this place has the least amount of wait time or no wait time at all, which is such a bonus and worth the drive from La Mesa! I've never waited more then 10 minutes at this place. The service is always great, can't ever complain, they're on top of their game and no that menu like nothing else.  Food is always so good, I recommend the chicken mediera! Yummo. Boo for now having the lemon-herb roasted chicken. It's been five times that I've wanted this dish and they're always out of it.  Only one other complaint. The bread is so soft yummy and warm, but on my last visit they didn't have bread until I was already done with my meal. Other than that this place is all around perfecto!"
Gabriela B.,"San Diego, CA",0,44,3,1.0,1/15/2013,"My friend had dinner at this location to celebrate her birthday.  Our server (JOSALYN) was the absolute worst server I have EVER encountered at ANY RESTAURANT.  She was beyond rude.  After taking our order (very abruptly), she NOT ONCE ASKED IF WE NEEDED ANYTHING.  Not once did she ask if we needed more water, not once did she ask if we liked our food- she never bothered to return to our table again until she left the bill.  When she returned my credit card, she of course didn't say thank you- she had no manners.  I have been to this location before and have never had such poor service.  People like Josalyn should not be in customer service- if she's your server- run!"
Melissa C.,"Chula Vista, CA",10,75,,2.0,2/8/2013,"Went there yesterday with two friends and their children.  Worst. Service. Ever.  Our order was NOT complex - kid's meals came out pretty quickly however adult meals (one sandwich, one salmon and a beet salad) took an HOUR.   Thing about dining with kids - we don't mess around.  Order and get OUT so the 18mos old twins don't experience a meltdown after sitting too long.  No such luck yesterday.  Kids were totally finished and starting to get fidgety after our meals took so long to come out.  AMAZING.   THEN had to track down another server to get our check b/c our waitress disappeared.   Thankfully we got out of there before a full-on meltdown but seriously...an HOUR to get our lunch on the table?  It was NOT busy.   We're taking this place off our lineup for a while.  Not worth the hassle."
Sara B.,"Chula Vista, CA",309,136,40,2.0,5/16/2012,"I had a salad with 4 shrimp added. $6.00 dollars just for 4 shrimp...not huge tiger shrimp, 1-inch circumference shrimp!  I won't be doing that again!"
Natasha K.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,7,,5.0,9/20/2012,Excellent service and food everytime I come here either on date night or with the family. Their white chocolate Ted velvet cheesecake is to DIE for! Soooooo good!
Natasha G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/17/2014,"Great food! Same as Fashion Valley location. Great staff, great overall experience every time."
Chynna W.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/10/2014,I love their original cheesecake the absolute best and aside from their incredible waitstaff and perhaps atmosphere that was probably the best thing of the night. The food to my husband and I was just overpriced and nothing that great. Portion size was large-neither of us finished our entree but reheating it of course is rarely as tasty as the first time and such was the case here. Many people recommended the restaurant for our anniversary meal but we haven't any plans to go back-we just weren't impressed.
Vanessa V.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,,3.0,11/10/2014,"I love the food, but did not like the service from Veronica who was behind the cheesecake counter.  I was with my restless child and I ordered a strawberry cheesecake.  Then a man walked in after me and ordered the same thing.  Minutes pass and she hands the cheesecake to him first.  Didn't she that I'm here with my impatient daughter or did she just want to provide better service to him because he had muscle?  That girl needs to be retrained on how to provide better customer service and to wipe the nasty smirk on her face!"
James L.,"San Diego, CA",40,140,100,4.0,1/2/2011,"One word, ZERO!!  No not stars, but wait time on a sunday when the wait time in Fashion Valley was over an hour.  Well worth the short drive to Eastlake/Otay Ranch to avoid the wait time of Fashion Valley. We had both a waiter and waitress helping us due to break times, and one(waitress) was fantastic, the other(waiter) a little slow, but didn't affect the quality of the food. Had the crusted romano chicken, HUGE quantity, with plenty left over for the next day! Menu is BIG, with plenty to choose from and the entrees can be a bit pricey, but the food is excellent.  Bread to munch on from the onset!"
Marianne B.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,16,,2.0,12/3/2012,"I reluctantly had lunch here a few weeks ago. And I remembered why I don't like to come here. This restaurant reminds me of that person in your life that tries so hard to please you but continues to disappoint you in the end (come on, you know what I'm talking about). The waitress was really nice and friendly but she kept on screwing up my order.  I had her take it back (it was the miso salmon dish) in the end was it was not edible. Their redeeming quality? At least there's free bread (although it can be a bit burnt at times so watch out) and of course, their famous cheesecake (if you want to consume 2,000 calories for dessert. Go for it!)"
Amy L.,"Lake Forest, CA",331,377,286,3.0,10/3/2010,"Love how its right by the mall, but the food is just okay. I definitely go to cheesecake factory more for their desserts and cheesecakes as oppose to their food. There appetizers may actually taste better than their actual dishes. Cheesecake factory has a myriad of tastes and choices, you can get something Asian inspired to Italian pasta.  I love their avocado eggrolls, its definitely enough for lunch if you want something light.  Dishes: jambalaya pasta: disappointing. I ordered this and there was no sauce on it. It was dry, they put sundried tomatoe in it and it was still hard and inedible.  They do however, give a good portion for a good price. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends who has different tastes and preferences. This is always out default restaurant when we can't make a decision."
Paul L.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",5,20,3,4.0,5/18/2013,"Their steak Diane, Pasta Davinchi, Bacon BBQ burger or Club sandwich are pretty good to try out!"
Cody M.,"Chula Vista, CA",33,17,7,4.0,3/20/2012,"Convenient location, good food at a semi-reasonable price. Better than your regular old Applebee's."
Mighty M.,"San Diego, CA",34,139,2,2.0,6/26/2012,:( I am seriously unhappy that I have to write this review but what happened to the Chicken Madeira? It's not even CLOSE to what it's supposed to be or is at any of the other locations. Seriously...I was disappointed. The service was excellent...whomever she was. Sorry...I was so distracted by this mess of a plate of food and bland mashed potatoes that I forgot to even ask her name. I'll just drive clear to Fashion Valley next time.
Jessie Z.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,98,55,2.0,5/28/2014,"We come here a few times a month after church.....I would have given this location 4-5 stars until 2 weeks ago!  We walked in with 4 kids (2 in high chairs) for dinner.  There was a huge crowd in the lobby so we told the hostess that we were going to go to the only open bar table to wait out our 15 min.   After 25 min we walked up to the hostess stand and they said they gave our table away.  They were not using pagers.  We waited for another 20 min while they waited for another table to open up.  Bar server was great...he is the only reason for the 2 stars!   We spent $50 in the bar (on apps and drinks for the kids) while the hostess gave away our table....and another $75 on dinner that we bagged up and brought home after the kids were ""losing it""!  We eat out all the time....but over an hour before they have food in front of them.....our night was over!   USE PAGERS or ask your hostesses to check the bar for a party of 6!!!!"
Helena P.,"San Diego, CA",1,9,,4.0,7/4/2013,"The food is pretty decent , I dislike the long waits on the weekends , but overall I like taking my family here to eat , it's relaxing ,clean and there's great food . Good for when I dont feel like cooking for my 3 kids!"
Derek M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,7,5,1.0,6/30/2013,"I took my daughter out to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for her High School graduation.  There were four us in our party. The place was not busy. So the server comes out  to our table trying to make conversation by asking what brings you here, what school did you graduate from, what are your plans afterwards, what college are you going to attend and he kept going on and on. My daughter and our group felt very uncomfortable. Felt like an interrogation.  Anyway, we ordered our meal and asked for water and to keep the water coming because we had been standing for the last three hours for my daughters graduation. Well, the water did not come. The order was screwed up, we asked for some brown bread and were told that they were out. But, then I noticed a few tables were being served that same bread. I asked the server about and he did not know anything about it. I am not saying because my daughters boyfriend is African American the service was poor.  My wife ordered a drink and was waiting 20 minutes and still it had not arrived. I asked the server and He did not know what was going on.  I replied, ""I guess its like the bread and you just ran out.""  A few minutes later the manager came out and apologized and took more of our time. By that time, the dinner was already destroyed and the event became one that you wanted to take the morning after pill to just forget. The manager offered to take the drink we did not receive off the bill and one slice of cheesecake. I did not want to argue even though I felt it was a slap in the face. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I even  gave a 18% tip for probably the worst meal of my life. The only reason why, I did not want too look cheap in front of my daughter and did not want to destroy   her special day any further. This was my first visit to the cheesecake factory and my last time. As my daughter got into her boyfriend's , I saw the look on my daughter's face and she was crying. Later, I found out from my wife, it was the meal. Total disappointment.!!!!"
Dante M.,"San Diego, CA",37,6,1,1.0,3/12/2013,Was disappointed in the food. Everything ordered for the family was very salty. The cheesecake did not taste great at all the night. Way to ruin a birthday
