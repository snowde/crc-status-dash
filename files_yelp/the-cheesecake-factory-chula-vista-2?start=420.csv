Jason F.,"Napa, CA",81,225,1,4.0,7/1/2012,"I had dinner here a couple nights ago.  It was by far the smallest in size Cheesecake Factory restaraunt I have been in.  Even thought it is small, the menu is the same.  Consistent everywhere you go.  Food and service were great here."
Kent F.,"BONITA, CA",1,6,,1.0,4/25/2013,"I've had good meals at this place, but not tonite. Pasta with ""meat sauce"" was made with chunks of leftover roast beef which must have been in fridge for days. I refused it and ordered angel hair  pasta with shrimp. Five shrimp on a pile of pasta with 2 cups of diced, cardboard, super-maket tomatoes dumped on top. No other seasoning that I could determione. No garlic, butter, or even salt. From bad taste to no taste. Don't know where the chef is from, but he doesn't know pasta from shoe polish."
Lahnna E.,"San Diego, CA",200,193,15,4.0,7/29/2009,"I pretty much always have a good experience at The Cheesecake.  I like that you get a ton of options.  On the downside, their encyclopedia of a menu aids in my indecisiveness.  I can only shudder to think how much money those menus cost to produce on top of the fact that they roll out new food stuffs all the time. Anyway, I like going here when I want some consistent comfort food.  This particular location is a drive for me, but it's A LOT less busy than Fashion Valley and its congregation of touristy shoppers.  My ex took me here last year for my birthday dinner and our waitress that night was exceptional.  Very friendly and easy to talk to and she was from Massachusetts! I always get edamame as an appetizer wherever I can find it.  It's a pretty hard dish to screw up and it's oh-so-yummy.  With drinks, it varies.  Sometimes I want a mojito, a margarita (the Ultimate and the Del Rey are very good), beer, a martini, or lemonade.  I'm one of those experimental chicks.  (ooh la la) Meals here are great.  I steer clear of the salads and pasta dishes because they are too huge.  A Caesar salad the next day isn't very appetizing to me.  However, the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta is pretty damn good reheated.  I love their chicken entrees here though.  I now pretty much always get the Chicken Madeira.  It easily has to be one of their best dishes served with asparagus (love!) and mashed potatoes (love love!). And then there's cheesecake.  I miss their Pineapple Upside Down.  So much actually that I always mention it when I eat here.  Like a pouty little kid but worse because food coma is setting in!  I love the Tiramisu, Dulce de Leche, Pumpkin, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cakes.  Yes, I've eaten A LOT of freakin' cheesecake.  These guys will also whip you up a mean mocha, or latte served in a glass with a straw. So, yeah, The Cheesecake isn't a huge adventure, but it's consistency and I like it."
Dominic C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/20/2012,"Great service but after this third incident, we will not be back.  One time we had cold food.  Really cold, not even luke warm.  Another time (last visit) hair in my food.  This time, glass in my wife's food.  Yes, glass.  If I could rate service separate, it would get a 4.  But with the unreliable experiences ( been here approx 15 times) it gets a 2."
Martin P.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",11,10,4,4.0,2/13/2012,Excellent service and they have some pretty tasty chicken dishes.  They give you delicious baked bread and they now offer a low calorie menu. Great place to eat and have fun.
Grace R.,"Chula Vista, CA",143,98,9,4.0,5/13/2012,"Yea it's a chain restaurant. I love it. One star off because they always push the cheesecake, after eating a full meal I can't eat that!!!!"
David N.,"Riverside, CA",28,179,14,5.0,5/3/2012,"It's usually less crowded here, although you sometimes have to wait for a table. The food is good and the service isn't bad either. I love getting their cheesecakes to go..."
Jose R.,"San Diego, CA",27,57,9,4.0,7/25/2009,"Went there yesterday a Friday at around 6pm, 5 adults and 1 child we waited around 20 minutes for a booth, place was full... what bad economy? at least not for them.  Service was very good start to finish I have to say, our server passed by and stopped many times to check on us and the food.  Had the Beer Battered Onion Rings and Fried Macaroni to start both very very good.  I ate a Burger, a $10 dollar burger with cheese and fries on the side very happy with my choice very good tasting. My wife had the Chipotle Chicken Pasta had to try it and also very good not to hot or sweet also a plus. Also tried the Orange Chicken from my sister's plate good also. Oh and I had a big ""cup"" of very good clam chowder at the beginning.  Portions are big so if you're not that hungry share a dish, my mom and sister did with a salad and the server was happy to bring extra plates to share.  I have to say I had my doubts of going there from reading the reviews here but I am glad I went there. Will definitely go back."
Trin H.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,26,,5.0,9/19/2011,"You HAVE to try it!  And their kids pasta; do I have to say more?  I've been there so many times, and no matter what, they always manage to make it a perfect meal.  I usually order, kids pasta, marinara sauce, no meatballs, and a little bowl of parmesan on the side.  I like lots of cheese.    After a few minutes, they bring exactly what I ordered.  No meatballs.  Marinara sauce.  And a bowl of finely shredded parmesan cheese.  It's like the shredded cheese is a fluffy cotton cloud. Whenever we go out to eat, I ask, 'CHEESECAKES'?' Though usually, it's not the answer -.-;   My mom and dad had their Vietnamese Tacos.  Now they order them every appetizer!  On a one to ten scale, my mom rates them a 9.  Why not a 10?  They're not PERFECT.  But they are really really good.  You can't live without it, like Portillo's.  (By the way, I'll make a Portillo's review) Oh yeah.  EDIT.  I've actually tried the cheesecakes here.  Are you a chocolate lover?  You MUST try the Hershey chocolate cheesecakes. Frosting and cake so good, chocolate chips so round, cheesecakes so good you would buy by the pound!     TO SUM IT UP They give you what you order for, TASTIEST PASTAAA~  And my favorite restaurant ^.^"
Jaime S.,"San Diego, CA",33,109,25,2.0,4/17/2012,"I have yet to receive a great visit to this chain. I have gone so far as to.send a letter to the district manager regarding a poor experience. Tonight, I ordered a burger made medium well. Perhaps this was my mistake but the burger was beyond well done. It was very dry and almost a crumbly texture. I had to ask for some kind of spread to combat the dryness to no avail. I mentioned my dissatisfaction to my waiter and he asked if there was something I wanted him to do. Interesting question! I simply stated that I was done with the burger and was now full. I will not be returning for any dinner service and will definitely be sending another letter voicing my concerns to the corporate office."
Johana T.,"San Diego, CA",477,556,1264,3.0,6/6/2011,"If I was just rating this place based on the looks, decor inside, overall atmosphere, and customer service I would rate it a 5. The food and the price of food on the other hand is why I'm rating it a 3. There are so many things to choose from on the menu it's like reading a book, and I've tried a variety of different things. The food in general is just not that tasty. It's really bland and needs more flavor and for the price you pay it's not worth it. The last time I went I got the four cheese pasta and a margarita pizzette and for the price I paid olive garden would of tasted better. I also got the cookie dough chocolate chip cheesecake and still a little pricey but this did not disappoint. If you want to come to a nice restaurant to enjoy good service, the decor, overall atmosphere and just cheesecake come here. If you want to enjoy a good plate of food I would rather go to the Seasons Fresh Buffet at Barona casino which only cost $16 per person with your free club card."
GreenDay R.,"San Diego, CA",76,190,103,1.0,1/27/2013,Ordered the barbecue pizza here and the pizza was burnt from the bottom and my strawberry shortcake sundae was horrible. Won't come here again.
Fonso P.,"La Mesa, CA",78,98,19,3.0,4/3/2009,"A few weeks ago I tagged along with my family as they headed to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch on Sunday. I was still reeling from Saturday night and figured some greasy food would do me good. When we arrived, we were expecting a long wait. The hostess suggested patio seating, so that we would get seated quicker (10 min vs. 30+ min). We gladly accepted.  What she didn't mention, was that we were gonna be directly under the sun, like ants under a magnifying glass.  Apparently, they couldn't open the umbrellas because some people sitting in the shade were chilly and had the heater going, and they can't open them next to a running heater. Whatever, thanks anyways.  While other waitresses kept trying to bring us food we didn't order, our waitress seemed like she was with it. She was nice enough too, she kept refilling our drinks, keeping us hydrated and all, but the overall service was really slow.  Everything (bringing the food, the dessert, the bill) took about twice as long as usual.  I don't know if that's how they normally operate, or maybe they just happened to be really busy that day. Luckily, the sun's position changed and eased up a bit towards the end of our meal.  Oh yeah, speaking of the meal; the pizza was alright, the mac n' cheese was good, and the banana cheesecake was great.  2 star dining experience and 4 star banana cheesecake = 3 star review."
Michael B.,"Chula Vista, CA",323,122,70,4.0,5/7/2009,"I go here quite often, especially for the bar food during happy hour from 4 to 6. Their bartender Chris is amazing. He is always super friendly, gives us spectacular service and knows our name and order by memory. When there is a long line he still waits on us at the bar in some cases more efficiently than a waiter or waitress. As for the bar food, my favorites are the fried mac and cheese, Vietnamese summer rolls, sliders and pot stickers. On the menu my favorites are the stuffed chicken tortillas (a Caribbean spin on a Mexican dish), the chicken and biscuits, the shepherds pie and the hamburgers. Their three beers on tap are: Stella Artrois, Karl Strauss Amber Lager and Fat Tire. You can't beat that. And the cocktails are excellent as well, although a bit pricey. If you want something happy and exciting but non-alcoholic give the Strawberry Lemonaid a try. Overall, food is 3 stars, drinks are 4 stars, prices are 3 stars, service is 4 stars and the legendary service Chris gives is...priceless...just kidding 5 stars. Overall - 4 stars."
Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",46,359,22,1.0,3/29/2009,"For some odd reason, the service at this Cheesecake Factory was downright TERRIBLE for me. I was with a party of nine people and I placed my name on the waiting list (which the staff said would be around 30 minutes). Typically, Cheesecake Factory is a busy place where you place your name on the wait list with the hope you would be seated on time. Unfortunately, the wait turned into an HOUR, even as others that came after us were seated.  But eventually we were seated, and the manager gave us an appetizer ""on the house"" for waiting such a long time. And we got bread (white only, since by the time we were seated all the wheat bread was gone). While the waiter had everyone else's order right, my order was botched. They made the wrong dish! What's up with that? To the waiter's credit, I did receive my correct order in 10 to 15 minutes' time. But even then, it felt like at times that it would only be until closing time that I would get my food. :( Thus, based on the mostly rubbish service and my botched order, I would avoid eating at this particular Cheesecake Factory. Big portions of food are nice, but service is also important to the overall experience."
Felicia M.,"Hawaii, HI",36,23,6,4.0,4/14/2010,"Ya, I'm a fan, definitely.  I've always loved The Cheesecake Factory - used to eat there all the time when I lived in L.A.  Now there's one in Otay Lakes.  The menu is HUGE & the cheesecake is the best.  They have every variety you can imagine & it's all good. The Cheesecake Factory is always packed - a popular spot that appeals to just about everyone.  It's gotta be the best restaurant chain out there in the mid-price range.  The only negative is - walk-ins only.  No reservations so you'll invariably have to wait for a table."
Darren S.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/1/2014,Just choose your food wisely. Meatloaf just bad. Mushroom gravy all over but no ketchup anywhere. Cheese cake way over priced.  I guess that that is I hate the most about the menu. They should take 5 to 10 bucks off most everything they have. Service can be spotty at times also. Once every 3 months is about right for this place.
Ryohei K.,"San Diego, CA",34,68,,3.0,7/3/2009,"Went there for lunch and I had a burger. Standard Cheesecake Factory portion; I don't know how they expect me to open my mouth that wide to eat a burger. Grilled onion on my burger was like 1"" thick, man.  Good job on the grilling, but is it too much for them to make it more ""eatable"" by sauteing instead of just sliced and grilled onion?   Kinda expensive for a lunch; your experience is as good as your company.  Service was decent. Nothing stood out about their service."
Danalee D.,"San Diego, CA",22,194,1,1.0,6/7/2011,"I really like Cheesecake Factory but recently they haven't been so great. What sucks is that they don't take reservations. So if you have a large party, you best hope you don't get there at a busy time. Some past experiences that led me to give them 1 star: - They gave me a water glass that was dirty at the bottom and chunks were floating in it. EWW! Did you not see that as you were filling the cup!? Double EWW! Shame on you! - I ordered a Pasta Di Vinci and the pasta was not even cooked. Yes I know what al dente is. That wasn't. It was just hard. I ended up just eating the chicken and my free bread & butter. I'm always scared of complaining and sending the food back to the kitchen. What if the waiter spits in it!? You will never know! - Another time I ordered the meatloaf. Burnt. Need I say more? - I know the sun is setting but can you not sit us in a booth where it's shining so bright you're blinded by the rays that are reflecting off the menus, plates and silverware. It's a weekday and you have more than half the restaurant with open seating. Oh, it's either this booth or the one next to it? Really!? They're both the same! Except the second choice, instead of the sun shining on the whole area, it's just shining on 2/3 of it. Fine. We'll take the second booth. C'mon Cheesecake Factory! What happened!?"
Ashley G.,"Fort Pierce, FL",3,22,32,1.0,8/9/2013,"We have come here a few times, with decent service and the food generally good. The last visit, will be just that. I ordered the club sandwich, which came out in about 20 minutes, first bite into it, I notice something extremely difficult to chew- so I spit it out and out comes a broken toothpick. It's as though the expediter broke it off the first time, left it in and just put another in without bothering to take out the original piece. This is extremely dangerous and with such lack of care toward their job, I can no longer trust the  preparations of the food.  The manager came out, apologized and offered to get me a new sandwich (seriously?), and said ""Don't worry, you won't have to pay for this one""- well I hope not! He was only planning on comping my meal, not my husbands nor our 4 year olds. So now, what was to be a family dinner is me hungry, watching them eat and being pretty pissed off. Thankfully our server (John) was more compassionate and understanding and comped our entire bill and gave us a free Cheesecake! Super awesome and kind, definitely wish this guy a great future! I feel like the manager didn't really take into account the severity of a costumer possibly swallowing a toothpick nor that his staff was completely careless and irresponsible."
