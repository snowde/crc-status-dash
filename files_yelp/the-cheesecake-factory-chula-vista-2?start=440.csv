Cesar M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,12,2,1.0,8/27/2012,"Let me start of by saying that we are avid fans of Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately, our recent experience at this location has left a real sour taste in our mouth. Upon arrival we had kindly asked the greeter/maitre d to seat us in a certain location of the restaurant in which we like. He gave us an attitude and told us that it would take a while because ""they had to clean the table"" I understood that we would wait 5-10 minutes to get to our table, but the attitude and tone was extremely unnecessary and rude. Upon seating we had noticed how hastily and ill - prepared the table was in comparison to the others around us and was shocked to see food in the crevices of our forks. We had alerted our waitress and she had brought us fresh silverware. After we ordered our food, it arrived at a temperature that seemed colder than it should.""(The Green Sauce  Carnitas Chilaquiles"" Was very cold and tasted very 'cafeteria' like) However we tried to enjoy our brunch the best we could, but we were shocked to find out that  this restaurant has a major FLY problem. 5-10 flys were next to our table, swarming around. Landing on our straws, food, and even table. They were climbing up the windows, and landing on our hair. I & my wife were repulsed by this atrocity, and alerted one of the bus-boys. He claimed to have told the manager, however nothing was done. We ordered over a hundred dollars worth of food, beverages, and cheesecake for our small party of 3, and we left a good tip like honest people. We went into this restaurant hoping for a great Sunday brunch. But ended up getting very bad food, and TERRIBLE service. We really love the food at cheesecake factory and hope to return, but some serious action, and even Pest Extermination, needs to be done. I really hope that someone listens to this comment, because as a paying customer, I feel like I did not receive the service I should have for the hundred dollars I spent."
Pilar K.,"Bonita, CA",6,103,,4.0,1/3/2012,"My husband, niece and I went to Cheesecake Factory for lunch on January 2, 2012.  Not a long wait and the service was great.  I had the Chinese Chicken Salad which was yummy but I couldn't finish it, my hubby had the Santa Fe Ranch Salad and my niece had the Renee's Special.  They give huge portions!  One of the better Cheesecake Factory's in San Diego for service."
Quay A.,"Craig, CO",63,322,72,2.0,10/13/2008,"I would only rate it 1 star but I will eat there again, just suffer through it if the group I am with has to go to that place.  I really dont understand why it is so popular. Positives: Large selection of food options Negatives: Cost (food is moderate but drinks are expensive) Crowded. Unimaginative. Food is not cooked well - so while it doesn't cost that much it is still overpriced for the quality. Had one of the worst made cocktails of my life (I rarley return anything and I had to). The menu is one very long series of commercials. All in all the only time I go here is if someone I am with really wants to go there.  I am consistently disappointed in the food, not well prepared, to greasy & salty.  There are many other places I would go to that are the same cost or less and better quality without putting up with the crowd.  If you have to get the cheesecake walk in buy it and leave, have your meal elsewhere."
J K.,"San Diego, CA",2,27,19,3.0,12/3/2008,"I ate here on Sunday with my family for lunch. We were seated right after we walked in. While sitting down and browsing through the menu, the first thing I noticed was that everything was a bit expensive. It was also hard to pick something because there were so many different dishes to choose from! Even though I had a hard time picking something, I ended up settling for the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip and the California Cheese steak. The wait for the food (including my family's) was about 30 minutes, so I made a number of trips to the bathroom to kill my boredom. I think that their bathrooms are fairly nice too- they're dimly lit and the sinks make washing my hands more fun! Childish, I know..but it's true. Haha. When we got our food, I wasn't really impressed with my cheese steak. I thought that it tasted plain and that the cheese and meat didn't blend at all. However, the fries were really good. The Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip were to die for though! Even though I wasn't given enough salsa (on the side), they gave me a second serving of it after I asked.. and it was A LOT.  MMMMMM. I suggest that you give it a try, though I prefer the one at Chili's more. xP Here is what my family ordered: Little brother- Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. - All I must say is..WOW. That burger was bigger than his face. He really seemed to enjoy it though. Mom- Fish tacos and some kind of sundried chicken tomato pasta thing. - I didn't try the fish tacos but the pasta thing that my mom ordered had just the right amount of seasonings- it wasn't too little or too much. The flavor was just right. For dessert, we ordered a Chocolate Truffle Cake of some sort but since I was borderline full, just one forkful made me sick. We ended up taking it home but once my stomach settled down, I was able to eat it and actually enjoy it. xP Overall, I like this place. Even though the prices are a bit high and the food is generally okay, I would consider coming here again... just not anytime soon. I thought that the atmosphere was pretty chill and that the waiters were very attentive and polite (ours, especially--such a happy girl!)  Yeaaaaaah. - J"
Mark D.,"San Diego, CA",519,184,8,4.0,8/7/2009,I like Cheescake Factory. My only problem is the wait sometimes. This time it was short. I guess since this one is fairly new it doesn't have that problem. I noticed it got a little busier as it got later.  I still love the food here. The portions are large and very good. The service is nice as well.  I ordered the corn cakes for appetizer and the meatloaf for my main meal. I couldn't even finish half of the oatmeal. I didn't have anything for dessert but I did like the food. I wish I could have eaten more.
Lakeisha G.,"Frisco, TX",7,88,3,5.0,8/7/2011,Still a favorite of mine.  I love the red velvet cheesecake!!
Tim W.,"San Diego, CA",17,110,13,5.0,3/14/2011,"Something on the menu for everyone sums up what I think of this restaurant. I'm not a real fan of cheesecake so for many years I avoided this place. Little did I know there was such large menu but there is even a type of cheesecake on the menu for that person that doesn't like cheesecake! When I go I have flashbacks of Gordon Ramsey telling some restaurant owner that his restaurant is a failure because menu is too large and unfocused....it works for Cheesecake Factory! There are some low cal options but I usually go here for a guilty indulgence. I can blow out 2000 calories on accident! I have more favorites than I can even speak of. It is always a delight to be able to take a dessert home. If you and your wife/date/friends all have a different craving, you can all find something on this menu. Great for groups. Just great. I'm not always in the mood for it but it is a my go to when we can't make up our mind. Cheesecake was not for me. Here you can get cheesecake with training wheels. They have flavors that take the bite out of the ""cheesecake"" flavor and soon enough...bam! You like more of the ""cheesecaky"" flavored items. Coffees, Teas, Alcohol, Large Menu, Great Desserts,  Loud environment. Recently discovered the brunch and what do you know, another favorite. The Lemon-Ricotta pancakes are addicting and only available for brunch. DAMN YOU CHEESCAKE FACTORY!  DAMN YOU!"
Rafe P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,43,,3.0,3/27/2011,"Come on!  It's a chain, not haute cuisine.  Very diverse menu that takes a long time to look through.  Seating is first come first served.  I've never had to wait more than a few minutes though. Service and food quality are uneven.  Sometimes, it'spretty good.  Sometimes it's mediocre at best."
Sereli R.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",56,87,15,4.0,6/29/2011,"there's an overwhelming amount of items on the menu. this makes it difficult for someone who already has a difficult time ordering. however, it also give you a lot of options! had the lentil soup and it was AMAZING. it reminded me of how my mom cooks it and we all know moms cooking is the best. i also tried to mediterranean mahi mahi. wow! that was so delicious. it came on a bed of savory mashed potatoes and tons of tomatoes and veggies. it was cooked perfectly and all the flavors blended well together. i'm craving this as i write this. damn! we came here kind of late but the service we got was really good! we didn't feel rushed at all and we felt really comfortable and relaxed.  next time i'll try not to eat so much so i can actually try some cheesecake."
Vincent M.,"San Diego, CA",1,7,2,1.0,2/16/2011,"Me and my fiancé went here for Valentines Day and to start off it took them 20 minutes after seating us to ask us what we want to drink. Second it took them about another 20 minutes to bring us our drinks. Third we ordered 2 appetizers and it took them a good 30 minutes to bring them out and one of them the artichoke dip was cold and had to be the worst thing I ever ate it had no flavor to it, so we asked to trade it out for something else and they did. Last we ordered slices of cheesecake and my fiancée slice was warm like it had been sitting out a while. One good thing their fried Mac n' Cheese was the greatest thing ever."
Cher G.,"La Mesa, CA",19,13,2,4.0,1/13/2012,"I had the grilled pear and blue cheese flatbread and an arugula salad with almonds, raisins and cheese. Delicious! I'm only giving 4 stars because it took a long time for the waitress to come to our table AND it's the first time I've gone to the cheesecake factory and it wasn't busy at all."
Marie K.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,10,,2.0,2/24/2014,"I just want to make it clear, I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory but the management at this one is poor.  It is a hit or miss most of the time and I continued to go because it's the only one around.  The servers are friendly and the food is to be expected from what you would receive at other Cheesecake Factories.  One evening my family and I waited for an hour to be seated, which I justified given it was during the dinner rush.  After the wait, and being extremely hungry, they sat us down at a table and in about 15 mins brought out a bread basket.  We grab a piece of bread to satisfy our rumbling stomachs and a cockroach ran from the bread basket to under our table!  YES!  A COCKROACH!...Scurried across the table to God knows where.  Now I am one of those people who are extremely disgusted by cockroaches (almost a fear of them), and this experience was just not acceptable.  We talked to the manager and he offered to seat us at a different table.  When I asked about some type of compensation for the time we had wasted to wait to be seated and what had happened...he didn't even offer one!  Needless to say we took our business elsewhere.   Jump ahead about a year later (the amount of time it took for me to get over the cockroach incident) I took my parents and 2 year old for lunch (notice I went during daylight).  Our adult meals were delicious (as to be expected). I had ordered my 2yo the macaroni from the children's menu, good portion, looked tasty, but I noticed small black pieces in the food.  At first I thought it was pepper but didn't recall them, or any restaurant putting ground pepper on a child's macaroni.  After further inspection and digging through the food, I found larger pieces of what was metal! I pointed it out to the waiter, who offered to bring out another one.  We got the second plate...and same thing!!  I found little pieces of black metal in the food!!!  Granted we were almost done with our meals, my two year old was hungry and couldn't understand why I kept taking his food away when all he wanted to do was eat it.  The waiter never offered to bring out something else on the house.  We politely asked for the check, and mind you I was pretty patient with them during this whole process even though my child was now fussy from not eating, but when I saw he had charged me for a child's meal that wasn't even edible, I made the decision to boycott this place for a while.  I had him remove the item from our bill and explained to him that in my opinion, the least they could of done was offer my son something else to eat free of charge for our hassle and patience.   I never reported these incidences to the Health Inspection Agency, but they are both note worthy to be complaints."
James C.,"San Diego, CA",531,311,129,3.0,7/1/2008,"I was debating whether to give a review to a popular restaurant like Cheesecake Factory, hereinafter referred to and wrongly abbreviated as CCF, and decided that I would add some trivial advice in the form of outline (or you can use outline as lyrics to a song draft). So here goes: If you are a mall rat  (under 18 and can't find social spot to hang out at besides the theater), go to CCF. If you are desperate, go to CCF. If you are really hungry to the point you see your ribs in the mirror, go to CCF. If you fancy the hostess in the front of CCF, go to CCF. If you want more food, than the money you have in your bank account, go to CCF. If you think your too chic to eat at a fast food joint, go to CCF. If you want to look douche, go to CCF. Bottom line: the food is decent and inexpensive; the atmosphere is bustling like a train depot during rush hour; and the decor is pre-fabricated, cookie-cutter template you would expect from a place like CCF. Oh yeah, the cheesecake is pretty good, hence the +1 stars, to make it 3 star rating."
Kayce J.,"Chula Vista, CA",24,32,14,3.0,7/29/2011,"Whatever you do, don't look at the nutritional values on anything you're eating, you might keel over just from reading. There is NOTHING on this menu under 1000 calories for an entire plate...not even the salads. Made it really difficult for me when I joined a friend for her birthday dinner. Also, they had WAY too hard of a time splitting up the bill for all of us at the end...took over half an hour and I needed to get home to my kids. Pretty annoying. Salad I ordered was mediocre...cheesecake was awesome, of course. It was the Oreo one, I think."
Nayeli A.,"Hollywood, CA",213,25,7,3.0,8/22/2010,"It seems like we (my mother-in-law, my boyfriend and I) eat at Cheesecake Factory at least once a week! Funny thing, this is our old local and thank god for that. The food at this location is so bad compared to the one at Fashion Valley (our ""new"" local, yey!), and the service tonight SUCKED! Maybe the fact that we switched booths out of the freezing area that we got sat at first had something to do with it... but either way, we didn't even get silverware till we had to ask for it in order to eat our food! LOL... c'mon!  Anywho-ha... finally got our entrees and 2 came out, then the 3rd didn't come out for at least 5 minutes! Not only that but Cici(m-i-l)'s dish, the Chicken Picatta, tasted too salty compared to the one she had 5 days ago at Fashion Valley. The drive is worth it and the difference (both in food & service) is HUGE!  Our waitress was sweet, but sweet isn't everything.... like when you bring two iced tea refills and forget mine even though I asked you for one and my glass is empty... things like that. One thing I for sure love about Cheesecake Factory is that they are open late which is probably why we frequent this place so much, we are nightowls!!! Overall, I think the company is good, this location just has to step up its game!"
Robert S.,"San Diego, CA",47,11,3,5.0,9/9/2011,"Went out with the family and kids. Great service and a good environment for fun and a great conversation. The food is pretty good yet I was mainly impressed how good our waitress was. She asked the right questions, showed up exactly when we needed her, so she got a nice tip. I would recommend this place for families and friends who want to have good food and a good time."
Luciane P.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,4.0,2/9/2012,"Last week, I went to The Cheesecake Factory with my husband and daughter, in Fashion Valley. It was a great experience.  The place is beautiful, and the waiters were so nice!! We feel very well there. We ordered a pepperoni pizza for us and a macaroni & cheese for her (kids menu). It was very good.  For dessert, based on the recommendations of our friends, we ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. OMG!  A huge piece of cheesecake and so much chocolate!  We enjoy it a lot. I've never ate so much chocolate cake in my life! I recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for a good food, desserts or for whom is chocoholic!!!"
Christie C.,"Vista, CA",52,91,25,3.0,6/1/2008,I only love this place for their FAMOUS selection of cheesecake. Other than that their steak and everything else is easily dupe-able at any other sit-down restaurant for a more reasonable price. The wait here is better than Fashion Valley and service is good.. kthanks. Oh yah they have VALET. big whoopdeedoo
Manuel C.,"San Diego, CA",68,16,5,5.0,4/19/2011,"Service was great the waitress we had today her name was angie. Excellent service didn't even have to ask for anything and also very impressive that she knew Spanish,food was good and I will most definitive coming back and asking for her.
