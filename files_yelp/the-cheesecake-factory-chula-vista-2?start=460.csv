Meg M.,"Chula Vista, CA",116,139,13,4.0,4/22/2008,"Would give the place 5 stars because their Cheesecake is the bomb, yo! BUT.. . . .  They lose a star because when we ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, ate pretty much the whole thing, noticed on the very last piece of chicken, the chicken was undercooked. The rest of the pieces seemed fine.... or I just didnt notice. But the last piece was cooked liked ""Seared Ahi""..... cooked on the outside and raw in middle.  I'm not the type to make a huge deal of things, so I politely informed the waiter that the chicken was raw and I showed it to him. I just let him know to let the cooks know to cook the chicken more thouroughly, so that they wont have trouble with other people.  The manager promptly came over and wanted more details on the incident. He took the item off the bill, without me asking. I wasnt even looking to do that because I had eaten the whole thing practically. I just wanted to inform them so the cooks need to watch it in the future.  If they didnt take me seriously, then I would've made a huge deal of it. But they were very professional about it and profusely apologized for the incident, which was nice.  Despite this incident of undercooked chicken, I will still go back because of their professionalism and listening to the ""customer"".  By the way, I didnt get sick, luckily.  (Adam's peanut butter cheesecake all the way!)"
Erica P.,"Chula Vista, CA",54,45,5,3.0,3/5/2009,"This review would've been higher if it weren't for the fact that I enjoyed my appetizer so much more than my main course.  So, my boyfriend and I decided to go here for our anniversary. I had heard that the location at the Fashion Valley Mall had some ghastly wait times and that they didn't take reservations! :( I called ahead anyway (to our Chula Vista chain) and I was surprised to hear the estimated time to be 15 minutes or less.  We arrived, and were seated almost immediately. I really liked the service and the atmosphere. We went ahead and ordered after browsing the huge menu. I decided on the Chicken Carbonara Pasta and my boyfriend, being the Southern Boy that he is, went with the Chicken and Biscuits. We also ordered an appetizer of fried Macaroni and I ordered a small bowl of their soup of the day, which happened to be Cream of Chicken and Artichoke Soup. When the appetizer and my soup arrived, I was so enamored by the presentation. The Macaroni balls were so elegantly placed on the plate that I dorked out and took a picture. (I'm BIG on presentation). I reluctantly took on from the plate and took a bite. I can't even describe how wonderful the flavor was! It was perfectly fried and the macaroni was so savory. My soup paled in comparison, but was still wonderfully delicious.  After my wonderful appetizers, I was anxiously anticipating what could be next! When our meals arrived, my pasta looked fairly simply laid out, but my boyfriend's Chicken and Biscuits had us cracking up. They made the nice country comfort food look so high class and elegant. I think it partially put off my boyfriend for just that. I tried my pasta, but found it to be lacking in flavor. A few more bites had me craving another round of Macaroni balls and soup. I noticed my boyfriend picking at his dish, and I found he was experiencing the same issue I had; the food was just too bland.  After eating our fill, we ordered some cheesecake to go, and that was awesome, but I should expect nothing less from the CHEESECAKE factory, right?"

Eddie P.,"San Diego, CA",900,709,158,2.0,10/20/2008,"We were one of the few people in the restaurant and it still took a long time for the server to serve us. On top of that, the food was terrible. I have never had such bad tasting, bitter chicken from the Cheesecake factory. The only redeeming quality is the cheesecake! The only pluses I can think of is that the food was extremely presentable, though tasted poor. This place is a highly overrated chain, and if you're in the mood for any kind of food, I'd recommend staying away. Desserts are good. The price is also way too high for it to be this terrible."
Beatriz B.,"San Antonio, TX",41,285,63,3.0,5/30/2010,"Placed a to go order for a Cali cheese steak w/fries, carne asada platter, and a strawberry cheesecake. The food tasted really good, but the downside was the curbside parking was full (being abused) so the only parking available was near the movies. The other issue was the tortillas were forgotten. Called and spoke to the manager just to give him an FYI in a nice non-bitchy way that we were a little disappointed. He was polite and gave us a discount. Overall, I like the food and service here, but instead of making excuses for why they can't police the curbside parking, they should just do something about it for customers like me who don't abuse the privilege."
Jayne E.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,54,2,2.0,2/19/2012,"Service was terrible today.  10 minutes to get seats (no one else waiting), 30 minutes to PLACE our order (waitress kept disappearing and taking care of other tables), 40 more minutes to get our lunch.  Yes, and we have a 4 year old.....not a good experience.  Even the food today was 'egh'...not worth waiting over an hour for it.   It will be a long while before I go back there."
S H.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,4.0,8/21/2013,"loved the food.. the cake was really rich.. but what do you expect with Cheese cake.. and it was so huge!   we had the appetizers and that filled us up.  We had our dogs, and they were so nice about seating us outside in the patio area.. made sure we had enough shade too, it was pretty warm that day."
Patrick R.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,29,,1.0,3/13/2011,"Now I remember why I don't go there for breakfast. Sat at the bar on a Sunday morning and the service was horrible. Not only did the bartender get my order wrong but he was too busy talking to other employees about how he only got an hours worth of sleep due to playing poker, he failed to notice I was out of water. Bad, Bad service...wish Rudy or Boma was back behind the bar. Will NEVER go back for breakfast agin, would rather wait 45 minutes for a table at IHop then go there again."
Ryan O.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",6,3,1,1.0,4/13/2013,"Our waitress was horrible. My wife, son and I were seated for more than ten minutes before our waitress even approached us. She finally came and took our drink orders. My wife asked for some sweetener for her iced tea....our waitress walked passed us four times before we finally asked someone else for the sweetener. She still never came out with it.  Our food was brought to us by someone else....(which isn't unusual) however, if the food is brought out by someone other than our server---usually our server will approach us soon after to ask if everything came out satisfactory....not in this case. We never saw our waitress for the duration of our meal. Not once to ask if we needed refills, or if we needed anything else, or to see how the food was.  We saw our waitress a total of three times:  to take our drink orders, to bring out our drinks/take our order, and to bring us the check. We left there extremely dissatisfied with the service we received."
Neil N.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/30/2014,"Today is my daughters birthday and we opted to dine in this place to celebrate her birthday. The place really looks nice and clean. After about 20 minutes wait time, we were seated at table 64. We got a nice table with a nice window view. Everything is going nice until we start getting our service. We nicely served with water and got our orders. After a few minutes of waiting our food arrived. We started eating and consume our drinks right away.  Our drinks remained empty for a long time and the waitress is no were to be found. She finally showed and just started taking our plates away while my daughter was still working to finish her food. The waitress was just so rude with no manners. Wooahhh, suppose to have a nice dinner to celebrate the birthday of my daughter but was ruined by this grouchy waitress. I think her name is Mirtha. will definitely will not go back to this place again. I will spend my hard earned dollar somewhere else.  Stay Away from this place"
Pj B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",141,277,1,5.0,7/30/2010,"SCORE!!! finally made it back here to try the cheesecake, and it was LONG LONG over due. Can't believe i never thought about trying the cheesecake before. I'm a huge fan now. Thanks again to the gf and her craftiness to find kick ass deals we scored a brand new style of cheesecake not even on the menu yet, WHAAAAA and AND for only a $1.50 and the bartender there hooked us up with the second slice for the same $1.50 promo price!  We went late night, kinda like 9:30ish or so, just to have an app and split some dessert. We had the Thia chicken lettuce wraps, for me A+ all the way. You get to use your fingers, whats not to like about that. For dessert one of the promo cheesecakes was the NEW Reese's pieces cheesecake, and let me tell you something, THAT right there is like biting into heaven. Asked the bartender which slice he suggested and he told us about the tuxedo Cheesecake and that one did not disappoint, not as good as the other but still good none the less.  Hot tip: come early or hope to find a seat, the place gets busy as hell!"
Mike P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/3/2013,"I came here being really hungry but I didn't have such a good time. I walked in and I almost slipped at the door, thank god I landed on an empty baby stroller. My new pair of Bobs ( sorta like toms) didn't provide me with good grip. Being a little guy the seating was a little weird because I had to pull a large bar stool to my regular table to eat. I over ordred on the food and tried finishing all of it. I started to feel queasy so I skipped to the bath room. As soon I walked in I blew chunks all over a little kid. I tried to make it better by cleaning his face with my new Banana Republic shirt. With my shirt dripping in spew I changed quickly to what I was wearing underneath my shirt, my lucky wife beater/muscle shirt. I walked back to my table and everyone was pointing at my face and laughing at me. I came to realize that I actually had a nose bleed from when I exerted myself when I spewed in the bathroom. I didn't want to look like I was embarrassed so I told my self I would finish the left over food on the table. While eating I inhaled a small amount of pepper that cause me to sneeze a mist of nose blood all over my food. At the moment I got up and left. I had a horrible time at the cheesecake factory and I would not recommend it to anyone I know."
Melissa S.,"Crestview, FL",308,427,64,3.0,12/5/2007,"I like the bread they give you in the beginning, the one with oats on it, soft and fluffy with spreadable butter. The sourdough, not so great. I need to remember to just order water, no soda, it's not worth it. It wasn't so crowded, considering it was 1 pm on a Wednesday afternoon. They do offer lunch specials, so you won't have to dish out $15+ for a meal. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta was okay, I liked what my friend ordered which was the Louisiana Chicken pasta.  How can anyone order cheesecake after eating an entree?  You'll end up full, that's for sure."
Lisa H.,"Otay Ranch, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/14/2011,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory.  Everytime I go, I am NEVER disappointed with my service or entree.  In fact, we are going there tonight for dinner :)  This one always has a wait, but is always worth it!  It is by far, one of my favorite places to go in Otay Ranch for a huge menu and dessert selection!!!"
Ruben C.,"San Diego, CA",1,34,,4.0,4/16/2013,"great spot to go for a special occasion, bdays etc. love the burger and dessert here"
Noelani M.,"Camarillo, CA",6,139,140,2.0,7/16/2012,"This is my second time going to the Cheesecake Factory. My first experience was ""okay"" nothing to rave about. If anything stood out it wouldve been the ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"". I'm not a fan of red velvet cake so imagine my suprise when I tasted what had to be the best cheesecake ever!!!! My second experience didnt fare any better then the first. For appetizers I ordered the cheese triangles, stuffed mushrooms, and crab artichoke dip. I didnt taste the cheese triangles as they were meant for the kiddos. But, you know its pretty bad when a 5 year old comments that its burnt and refuses to eat it. I love stuffed mushrooms and lets just say I took one bite and decided to pass. My 11 year year old on the other hand found it tasty and ate about 2 or 3 of them. The crab artichoke tasted like watery claim chowder. I took one bite and decided to send it back. It was supposed to be crab meat and artichoke but from the taste and looks of it I would say it was shredded tilapia with chunks of potatoe. Now on to the main dish. I ordered the Steak Dianne and Shrimp Scampi with mashed potatoes. The steak was ""okay"" it tasted like a heated tv dinner drowned in gravy and sliced mushrooms. The shrimp was horrible! I've never had battered, deep fried, shrimp drowned in tomatoes and spinach classified as scampi. Lets just say I ate less then half of one shrimp. You know your meal is pretty bad when your staring at your childs cheese and pepperoni pizza as if its the best dish on the table. In hopes of saving what had already been a total loss I ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go. I was not disappointed. In my opinon if your looking for a decent meal in the area. Go to Chilis and fill yourself up with those honey chipotle chicken crispers. Or if your into Asian Cusine stop by P.F. Changs and order a few barbeque spare ribs. On your way home stop by the Cheesecake Factory for the Ulimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. In all honesty they need to stick to what they know, ""Cheesecake"". The food is horrible. I give this place 1 Star for their cheesecake and 2 stars for their location......"
Eric K.,"Dublin, CA",45,1116,9,3.0,6/14/2008,"It was ok.... but for almost a $100 meal for 5 people for lunch...  entree, 1 appetizer, drinks and 2 slices of cake...  what can I say... a bit much. but... at least it's typical and predicatable..."
Jennifer M.,"Denver, CO",138,481,,4.0,8/26/2009,I've never really had a problem with the service or the wait time here. I always end up sharing the appetizer platter when I come here though. It's only $20 and you get enough tasty food for 4!
Chris S.,"Lincoln, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/14/2014,"I was here on Feb 14, 2014, in from out-of-town with a sister and brother-in-law visiting our step-dad on Valentine's night. This place was Hoppin'!  We arrived at 6 & were told, about a 45min wait. We were seated in 50 which was great considering the craziness that was going on this night. We got the outside patio on a perfect weather night. Our server was the delightful DESIREE D. This young lady was very knowledgeable on the menu items. She was very attentive and courteous with us. Considering some of the people running around on this very busy night, she was calm and confident (no hectic running) with us and her other tables. My sister commented to DESIREE that she must have a great memory as she was not writing down any of our order. Everything from drinks, entrees (with modifications) and desserts came exactly as ordered with no concerns. This is the server I want everytime I dine out. Thank you DESIREE D for your excellent service and a great night out! It did not go un-noticed or unappreciated. Any customer service oriented employer would be lucky to have you on their team. Sincerely,  Chris Scarbrough"
A V.,"NJ, NJ",5,16,,4.0,2/12/2008,"I guess this area is also known as Eastlake and it's close to my parent's residence.  It's in a relatively new and very large outdoor ""mall"" area.  There are so many stores around the area, it takes me at least a week to partially get my bearings straight and by then I'm headed back east. This is only the third Cheescake Factory that I've been to.  Until this one, when I was in the San Diego area, I/we usually went to the one at the Fashion Valley mall.  I've also been to the one in Las Vegas in the Caesar's Palace mall.  I haven't eaten at the ones in NJ for some reason. On this visit with the folks on the last night of a recent trip, I ordered the seared tuna with the wasabi topping.  It was a very satisfying meal like all other meals I've had at other Cheescake Factory restaurants.  I also could not stop eating the bread.  My parents split the herb-crusted salmon salad which they seemed to really like.  I also had a microbrew but can't remember the name.  It might have been an ale and it was pretty good.  For dessert, I had a few scoops of the cheesecake made with splenda.  It was ok.  I much prefer the caramel cheesecake which I had at the Vegas location. All in all, chain or not, I've always enjoyed every meal."
