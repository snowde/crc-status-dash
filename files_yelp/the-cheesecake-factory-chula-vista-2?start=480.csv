Ashley H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,2,,1.0,7/27/2014,"My husband and I tried to eat here earlier this evening to celebrate my birthday, however, we ended up just walking out. I gave the hostess my pager that was going off and when she grabbed the menus and started walking I obviously followed.. until she turned around and told me she was seating another family first which I apologized and waited. Then another hostess seated the couple that came in after us.. I brushed it off as a miscommunication between the hostesses and didn't say anything. Then the original hostess walked right by us ( after what seemed like talking to the other hostess about the mix up or something and looked straight at me) and grabbed the other couple that came in after us, I stopped and asked her when we would be seated and she told us it was getting worked out then proceeded to seat the couple that came in two couples after us. Needless to say we decided to leave and just go to Chilis instead where we got amazing service."
Marlo R.,"Chula Vista, CA",39,26,13,4.0,9/6/2009,"I live next door to the Otay Ranch Mall, so my husband and I are here at least once a week. The reason we keep coming back is because everything we order seems freshly made. The food is always very flavor full and seasoned correctly. Even if the place is full, the wait is usually only 20 minutes, and the wait staff are always very, very professional and courteous. We love to sit outside on the patio, listen to the sound of the fountain in middle of the mall and people watch while having a relaxing lunch or dinner. One of my fave dishes to order here is the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad...So good!  Also my fave drink to order here is the Passion Fruit Tea with a shot of simple syrup and Jack Daniels, delicious on a warm summers day."
William M.,"San Diego, CA",31,47,4,5.0,6/11/2010,"Can't go wrong with the Chicken Littles... THE MASHED POTATOES make me want to drop to my knees and praise the lord! For dessert, I recommend the Lemoncello Cream Torte. The staff is great, attentive, and friendly!!! Also, check them out for happy hour... the deals will make it easy to turn it into happy HOURS... yeah, that's plural."
Kandice N.,"San Diego, CA",1,13,6,5.0,12/17/2010,I don't have one bad thing to say about this place! We did have to wait about 15 mins to get a seat but they were really busy! I didn't mind because once i got my chicken pasta i was in heaven! Everything we got was really good. The waitresses were really nice and i must recommend the strawberry margaritas. DELICIOUS!
Maryella P.,"San Diego, CA",300,318,491,1.0,3/17/2009,"I sincerely hate the cheescake factory!  Their food is way too expensive considering it's not good whatsoever.  The only thing that I would guess is good is the cheescake but it's only beacuse they have so many different options. Because to be honest I think you could get a whole Costco cheescake and feed a family of twelve for twice as much.    On my most recent visit I was forced to go because the family was all going. I didn't order food, just sat outside enjoying the sunshine while everyone else had their lunch.  I swear the first fifteen minutes we were sitting there waiting for the food, the waitresses kept trying to give us other peoples orders.  What the hell? Are all these freakin chicks new or just dumb? Now I've never waited tables before but to make the same mistake that many times, C'mon!  They should shut down and open an Olive Garden in it's place. It would relieve some of the congestion at the OG on H street."
Doug K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,28,,3.0,9/1/2009,"I don't get this place.  Big chain, famous name...and yet they can't focus on any particular kind of food.  After first sitting down, we were handed menus that were 20 pages long...I don't even think there were any pages devoted to the cheesecake...but there were definitely several devoted to advertisements for other stores in the mall!!! How do they expect to turn tables when it takes at least 10 minutes for someone to read the entire menu let alone decide if they want Italian, British, Mexican, or Chinese food.  Oh yeah, they also have sandwiches and burgers and steaks and breakfast. I had the Shepherd's Pie which for some reason was a meat concoction in large flat bowl with some mashed potatoes on top...it didn't even appear to have been baked and certainly wasn't baked in the bowl like I had hoped. Overall, the food and service were pretty good and I'd probably go back again and try some pasta...no wait, maybe a burger, or orange chicken or a burrito.... By the way, don't order water in this location, by the way...it tastes like dirt (although this isn't really a reflection on the restaurant so much as the water in San Diego County)....the could filter it."
Jen G.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,18,,5.0,5/16/2009,"It was my mother's birthday and we had a party of nine, ready to have dinner on a Saturday night. They don't take reservations, but Joey, the guy running the floor was very accomodating. He  asked me what time we were going in and put me on the list. When we arrived our table was already being set up for us and our server was more than ready to get our drinks started. The wait for our food was less than expected, which was great! Before we knew it three servers came in with our food, and all the while our assigned server was very, very attentive. The service was speedy, as all other times I've had lunch or dinner here, I'm actually very suprised to see bad reviews about this particular location. Great service and great food has always been consistent, so it's five stars for me:)"
Mauricio P.,"Chula Vista, CA",127,27,,2.0,2/15/2010,"people that like the pasta here need to  get out more. wife got a giftcard at her work so we came to check it out. place looks like 5 stars and service was great but the pasta was DREADFUL and their cheesecake was as average as ive ever tasted, i make a better cake. i had a cajun type chicken pasta and was tasteleess, bland, unspicy, uninspiring...wife had a standard chicken alfredo and same deal, tasteless, bland...blah. we ate a few fork fulls and left. she also had a strawberry drink and it tasted like ultra cheap, rotten strawberry shake with drops of alcohol. i havnt tasted any of the pizzas or anything else but if these two dishes taste like crap and a few others ive tasted from family that brought it back, we have no desire to sample anythign else from this over hyped disaster of a chain."
Sarah O.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,23,3,4.0,4/2/2010,I've been coming here ever since they've open and I love it. I always come to have coffee and red velvet cheesecake! Great place to have a semi casual chit chat :)
Laura Z.,"Santee, CA",7,45,,4.0,1/16/2010,"Food was good, not great, but good...the place was very nice... I went there for my birthday and it was a good experience the waitress was attentive and friendly...."
Jessica L.,"Bonita, CA",213,15,1,5.0,4/22/2010,"I absolutely ove Cheesecake factory!  It is my favorite restaurant because they have so many menu options.  When you go with a big group everyone will be able to find something they like.  They are very kid friendly and the food comes out fast.  Whenever my girlfriends and I go out, this is where I always want to go."
Vivek A.,"San Mateo, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/4/2010,Terrible service not once did we get our water refilled. Nobody came to take our money when we tried to pay it was a joke
Claudia D.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/27/2012,"This is my first review for any restaurant ever (even though I eat out A LOT). However, this review is not so much for the restaurant as it is for a particular employee. I live in the North Park area and usually do not venture out very far -- especially to Otay Ranch! On this particular night, the mall was having a free movie screening so my friend and I decided to make the drive. We had dinner at this particular Cheesecake Factory location after the movie screening and sat at the bar. We were greeted and waited on by Jeremy. He was very pleasant and attentive and just gave overall great service. My friend and I had a comfortable, overall great experience with our food and drinks (btw, the summer rolls and the White Chicken Chili on the Skinnylicious Menu are DELICIOUS!). We paid and left and made the drive back home. When I got home I realized that I left my iPhone on the bar, right where I was sitting. You can imagine my horror at this realization as I don't have a landline and my husband was out of town on business. I drove manically to my friend's house and was able to call my phone. Jeremy picked it up, told me he had it and would wait for me to come get it. I am praising Jeremy for his honesty, integrity and for being so awesome. Jeremy, if you are reading this -- thank you!"
Timothy B.,"San Diego, CA",80,132,17,1.0,8/10/2010,"My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday.  I tried to talk her out of it because (and you may take this in consideration when you read this review) I do not like big corporate restaurants.  The experience we had demonstrates why I have this prejudice.  We fight our way to the check-in desk and I say ""two for lunch.""  I am told there will be a twenty minute wait.  I respond by saying, ""Outside is fine"" as it was a pleasant day and there were many empty tables outside.  I am told that we will be seated in a couple of minutes.  Twenty minutes goes by and we are finally seated outside.  There are only two other tables with customers at that time and many empty tables.  After a long wait the first waiter comes and wants to know what we want to drink.  My daughter orders a smoothie and I order water.  Another waiter shows up with a bread basket about five minutes later and leaves.  A third waiter comes to take our order.  We both order cheeseburgers.  I am asked how I want my burger cooked.  I respond ""medium-rare"".  About twenty minutes later the burgers arrive.  My daughter takes hers and I take the medium-rare burger.  The burger is cooked longer than a fast food restaurant's.  It is shoe leather.  As I am hungry and not wanting to upset the help I eat it anyways.  When done, my daughter gets a chocolate cheesecake.  At least that was ok.  This lunch for two cost over $50 with no alcoholic drinks.  I don't know how you can mess up cooking a burger but they did.  I don't mind paying $10 for a hamburger but for that price, it should be cooked to order."
V M.,"San Diego, CA",3,45,2,1.0,1/1/2014,will never ho here again . all staff and management team rude unprofessional and just not the type of service cheesecake factory likes to usually deliver
ROBIN L.,"San Diego, CA",2,25,,3.0,9/11/2011,"I like this place but seriously how dare they call it Shepards pie ? It was nothing like a real Shepards pie , more like a beef wine dish . The portion was huge enough for four people . I would much have preferred a smaller version of the real thing....................bummer . Service was excellent and so was the atmoshpere but wished I had had the Bang Bang chicken instead .............this entree gets a three rating . Not for any proud Brit....guess i'll head back to the Shakespeare pub ."
ROXANA I.,"Chula Vista, CA",29,14,2,5.0,10/29/2009,"I love there lettuce wraps for lunch, There napoletan french toast for sunday brunch, and the cheesecake is to good!!!"
Kathryn B.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/24/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory, however I recently went in to pick up a couple slices of cheesecake for my husband and myself and stood at the ToGo counter for over 15 min until one of the 3 employees working behind the counter finally acknowledged that I was there. It was even a slow night and a waitress standing nearby offered more assistance on details about the cakes than those behind the counter. Even a manager came by and didn't acknowledge me or another customer waiting at this point. I don't mind waiting as long as the staff acknowledges my existence and that they will be right with me. Should've walked out. Very disappointed with the normally helpful and enthusiastic staff."
Claudia G.,"San Diego, CA",133,45,1,1.0,11/4/2010,"I think, the Cheesecake Factory is known enough for their sinful deserts and wonderful food. OK, I get it. I may not be a regular at this establishment but this was a first that I had the worst customer service. And this is why I am giving this location a one star. Never again. It may have been the fact that me and the hubby had date night and we decided to be comfortable. By me saying this, I mean sweatshirts, jeans, and tennis shoes. Well, I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory from Hawaii, Los Angeles, and the Fashion Valley location, and dressing up for the Cheesecake Factory is definitely a first. Since when did this establishment meant dressing semi formal. PSHHHHHHH please. Just because we didn't wear our BCBG dresses like the girls next to us or a knock off Armani suit, doesn't mean we don't have money to burn. So Yelpers, go to the Fashion Valley location instead. At least at this location, you will get bread and water."
Melissa H.,"La Mesa, CA",16,34,,4.0,5/15/2008,This was my third time visiting this particular location. I was surprised to have to wait for almost 25 minutes on a Wed night around 7:45. Food was very good for all in our party of four and the service was attentive but not spectacular. The portions are huge so if you want cheesecake order that first or take it to go. I would lean more towards a five rating if it weren't for the way the seating was set up. I felt like the two top sitting next to our table was part of our group. Needless to say I will be back and do prefer this location to Fashion Valley for the previous mentioned reasons.
