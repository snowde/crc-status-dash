Shawn C.,"San Diego, CA",32,110,25,5.0,5/13/2007,"The new Otay Ranch location of the Cheesecake Factory deserves to be in the running for the best burger in San Diego! We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday while shopping at the new mall in Otay Ranch.  I have never been a huge fan of the food at The Cheesecake Factory so I ordered the burger to be safe.  Little did I know that I would be dining on one of the best burgers that I have ever tasted, When the burger came out it was huge.  It came with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled red onion rings, and aioli on the side.  It was cooked perfectly and had a big slice of cheddar cheese on top.  When I bit into the burger, it was juicy and so delicious that I could not believe it.  It was so much food, but it tasted so great that I did not want to stop eating.   My wife order the cobb salad.  She enjoyed her salad.  She described it as good, but not amazing. The service was very good. We were seated promptly with no wait. Our server was attentive, and the food came out pretty quickly.  The next time that I am craving a good burger, I will be heading to The Cheese Cake Factory"
A R.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,27,,2.0,4/4/2012,"My son and I drove from Los Angeles to take my niece to lunch. Went in on a Wednesday at 3:30pm, I mentioned to my son that I'd never been in a Cheesecake Factory when it was not crowded. We informed the African American young man who was the host, that there was 4 in our party. The restaurant was not crowded but we were left waiting for 10 minutes. The host left but came out when an African American couple came in and he sat them immediately. We were shocked, the restaurant was empty. When we did get seated I asked to speak to the manager the host's response was ""really"". He then said they were busy and in a meeting. I told the young man when they were done I would like to see them. When the manager did come out, his response was to just apologies. It is just bad business, customer service is a high commodity. I own 3 businesses in Los Angeles and I know how important Customer Service is to every business especially in this economy. I will not be eating at any of Cheesecake Factories from now on."
Alma S.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,5,,4.0,10/7/2012,well I went to cheesecake factory for a diner with my family everything was really good...
Karen C.,"Chula Vista, CA",18,2,,1.0,5/1/2011,"Tonight my family spent 3 hours trying to have dinner at the Chula Vista Cheesecake Factory.  This was one of the worst experiences in my recent dining experience.  We sat for about 1/2 hr before anyone even asked us for our order due to a shift change for the servers.  After the orders were taken, it took at least 45 minutes before we got served.  The first two dishes came out tepid and had to be sent back.  We spent another 20 minutes waiting for them to be served again and for the other two dishes to come out of the kitchen.   We started our dinner journey at 7PM and didn't walk out of the restaurant until 10PM.  Again, one of the worst experiences that I've had and I will never go back.   They are seriously disorganized and didn't  even offer to comp anything due to their errors in the preparation.  I would not suggest this restaurant to anyone.  I had $125 worth of gift certificates and had that not been the case, I would have been even more pissed about my experience."
Joel G.,"San Diego, CA",144,829,5,4.0,8/14/2007,"pros...this is just a great place to eat.  set in a great location where if you sit outside you can see everything that's happening.  and you don't have to wait for hours on end like the other ones.  the service was great, they were very attentive and even adjusted the umbrella that we were sitting under.  now about the food, my wife and i shared the chinese chicken salad, cause it was like huge.  i got the cuban sandwich, which was extra super crispy, warm and toasty.  they even have a selection of iced teas, green tea and tropical, but no regular.   then there are the desserts.  i don't think you could go wrong with anyone of them.  we got the fresh strawberry shortcake, oh that stuff is good.  juicy, sweet berries and that shortcake is delicious.  then i got the tiramisu, also top notch.  and it came out in seconds after ordering.   cons...well you could drop your car off at the valet parking, or you could walk the mini marathon for a parking space on the other side of the mall.  the parking lots that were near by when they first opened up are now gone because of the movie theaters."
Oin T.,"Wildomar, CA",39,14,37,4.0,10/13/2008,"Ate here on a Sunday, just about lunch time.  Wait was good, only about 5 minutes.  My girlfriend and I sat outside since it was a wonderful day.  The service was pretty good, our waitress was attentive enough without making too many trips to the table.  I was in the mood for breakfast-y stuff, so I ended up with the ""Breakfast"" Monte Cristo.  My-oh-my was thing good!  A bit too heavy on the powdered sugar, but that just dumps off anyway.  It was the eggs, ham, cheese and bacon version on some yummy french toast, with strawberry jam for dipping, man it was good.  breakfast potatoes we OK, nothing to rave about.  My girlfriend had the Shepherd's Pie, and she really enjoyed it too.  The portions are large as always, and it was too much for her to finish.  I had a bite and it was very tasty.  Now with this new mall out here, we might be able to get our CCF fix more often without the crazy wait usual for Fashion Valley."
Jeremy C.,"Bonita, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2010,"Our experience began at 9PM and ended at 1105PM with a short wait because the restaurant did not seem very full.  When we arrive at our table for 9, our waiter did not introduce himself or welcome us to the restaurant (we never got his name).  We ordered our drinks as well as waters for everyone.  He brought out eight waters, so I asked him for another water.  Instead of immediately getting me a water he stopped, proceeded to count all the waters on the table (as to try to insult me that I couldn't count).  When he realized that I was correct, he stood with a dumbfounded look on his face and looked at me.  It felt very awkward, but he then proceeded to get me a water.  He took our orders in a very rushed and informal fashion as if he didn't care.  At that point we had to ask for the bread which is usually given to us when we come in the restaurant right away (we were never offered it).  We received our food in a timely fashion.  Unfortunately our food orders were not correctly prepared.  Our waiter would never know this because he did not come and check on our meal ONE TIME during our visit.  He also did not come and refill our beverages.  One of our steaks was very overcooked and tough when ordered medium rare, my soup was cold, my associates skirt steak platter didn't have any toppings or guacamole with it.  After our meal was finished we received our check which was over $200.  We prepared to pay but no one came to get our check.  After 20 minutes of waiting we held our check in the air in hopes that someone would see it and help us.  When they finally did it took them over 12 minutes to charge our credit cards (we saw our waiter walk around the restaurant 4 times during this period).  We were extremely disappointed at this point so we went and talked to the manager.  The manager only gave us some in genuine apologies and excuses which did not make sense like it takes that long to split a bill with credit cards.  He seemed to mock us and didn't care how irked we were.  I felt we were mistreated because we were a group of 9 young business professionals that had to give a 18% tip because of our party size.  I hope you are unlike your manager and you will do more then simply apologize.  We spent 250$ on our bill and got about 2cents of service."
Agent X.,"San Quentin, CA",309,131,,3.0,5/5/2008,"service is above average, but i'd expect it since the menu is pretty pricey. however, the portion is very generous. in fact, it is too big so it was a mistake to order appetizers and no room to try the cheesecakes. we had enough leftover for lunch the next day. if the cost is spread out over two meals, it is actually a pretty good deal. the wait is just as ridiculously long as the Fashion Valley location."
Candice B.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,18,,5.0,3/25/2008,"I live closeby and I love going here for Happy Hour, M-F 4-6PM. Otherwise, its gets rather busy here after around 6PM on weekends but they serve the whole menu in the bar area and that's always quick and easy!"
PiNaYLoVe G.,"Spring Valley, CA",3,48,,4.0,12/16/2007,"so sorry to hear that the previous comments before me weren't so great. but I, on the other hand, had a great first visit to this location in eastlake. I usually go to the one in fasion valley, but we met up with my friends who live in the area. we didn't even have to make reservations ahead of   was too good to be true, and it was true. To start out, OUR waitress. She was hella cool and friendly AND her recommendations were phenomenal! (I forget her name, but I remember she was from Hawaii and NY.) The starters, the rolls were nice, but the appetizers were sooo much better. We ordered: Buffalo Blasts(Chicken Breast, Cheese and Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp.Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing), Fried Calamari (Served with Garlic Dip and Cocktail Sauce), and Ahi Carpaccio (Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto, Creamy Avocado and Togarashi Aioli). And that was for starters..all soo yummy! Now for the main course, I had the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which are usually for appetizers only, but I LOVE THESE! And My Man had his Beer Battered Fish and Chips (he's always on the look for the ultimate fish and chips location). My son had something equivelant to his usual mac and cheese, and he was happy. I think that would be my ONLY compaint about this place.....no kids meal. And finally, after ALL 5 of us were done, we definitely couldn't pass up on dessert. But for some reason, i forget which two desserts we ended it up with. I just remember that we're definitely coming back for more!"
