Ria V.,"San Diego, CA",1,66,29,4.0,9/20/2017,"Can never go wrong with any cheesecake here!!! Just love all of them... well, at least the ones I've tried. Food are good too and their portion size are pretty big. I always end up taking home at least half of what I ordered. No complaints on customer service... so far, they've been great! Will definitely come back here."
Laura B.,"San Diego, CA",136,63,211,4.0,8/16/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has a very good selection of food items on the menu. I like the variety of appetizers, salads, pastas, Mexican, Asian, and American foods. Lots of choices! There's also a kids menu too with food items the little ones are sure to like. I chose Mexican on my most recent visit. The beans, rice, chicken, tortillas, green salsa and avocados were fresh and delicious. My daughter ordered Chicken Marsala, and my son ordered Shepard's Pie. They were also pleased with the quality. Our appetizers included fried macaroni and cheese balls. They literally melt in your mouth. Delicious! I like that they start your meal with complimentary warm bread and butter too. My favorite is the darker bread, that has oatmeal sprinkled over the top. It's a little on the sweet side, which satisfies my sweet tooth. The best part is the excellent cheesecake choices! We purchased a whole carrot cheesecake to eat at home. I got the 10 inch and was surprised when I found out how much it cost, which was about $52.00. Yikes! Next time I'll ask the price before ordering. It was so big, that the 7 inch would've been just fine. Regardless, it was very good.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the noise level. It's hard to have a conversation. It's pretty loud inside of the restaurant. Other than that, it's a nice place to eat."
Madel C.,"San Diego, CA",69,1,1,1.0,4/8/2017,"Basically went to this location during lunch time and got fish and chips. Didn't finish my food so I asked to take it to go. Server didn't give me a bag the first time I asked and kind of gave me an attitude when I asked the second time. Then the server took my plate to box it to go while I paid for my meal... WITH TIP... because this is America. Went home and around dinner time I decided to eat my fish and chips. HOWEVER.... when I opened my to go box, it was BREAD!! Like c'mon really!! Do I really have to double check my to go box meal before going home! And let me remind you again... it was lunch time! It was less hectic for this horrible server to make such careless mistake. So yeah I lost $14 bucks plus TIP so $20 on a meal today."
Miss S.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,11,1.0,12/8/2017,"So I called to make a curb side order and I clearly asked for SPICY CHICKEN NACHOS and the young man brings me out some damn tortilla chips with shredded cheese. I tell him that I asked for spicy chicken nachos and he says oh you may have said that but I recall you said factory nachos?! Are you kidding me? Why the hell would I pay for some damn tortilla chips with cheese?! He needs to learn customer service skills and learn to give the customer what they asked for!!!! Every time I come here the ""college"" student wants to cop an attitude!"
Gerardo R.,"San Diego, CA",67,12,10,4.0,7/8/2017,Excellent service. Our server Mark was great. Will definitely be coming back to this location because of how awesome the service was.
Ronald R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,16,5,2.0,9/27/2017,"We come here occasionally when looking to eat a hearty meal. We've come to expect the long wait to get seated and the long wait to get our food (more than 20 minutes).  Today upon arriving, we got seated in less than 10 minutes. But getting our food took a lot longer than usual. Why, because our server forgot to place our order! We ordered appetizers with our meal almost immediate after getting seated. After waiting a while, we asked our server how much longer before we get the appetizers. She went to check with the kitchen, and came back to tell us that she forgot to order out appetizers. She then asked if we still want our appetizers because our food is almost ready. So I told her to forget. Our food took another 20 minutes to be served. So, I came to the conclusion that she forgot to place our order altogether. Because how can she forget the appetizers but not the meal when she wrote them on the SAME TICKET???  I can tolerate incompetence, but not getting lied to.  If not for their awesome always-fresh brown bread, I will never come back to this place."
Jet S.,"San Francisco, CA",3,78,22,4.0,9/16/2017,Can't go wrong with the Smore's cheesecake bring on the marshmallow loaded up on top of the cheesecake and there you go bomb dessert ... you can never go wrong with ordering the chicken marsala my wife likes to get it with the angel hair pasta I definitely think it holds more of the sauce my way truly knows how to order her food so I just followed her lead so good
Najmeh H.,"Carmel Valley, San Diego, CA",2,17,,3.0,9/6/2017,"Food is always good and dependable. But the service is extremely slow and it takes up a lot of time. Even at a time when it is not during lunch rush, I'm here and have been waiting over 20 minutes for my food after waiting another 10 minutes for the waiter to take my order. It makes it difficult to come here frequently"
Sharon D.,"San Diego, CA",8,11,29,4.0,8/28/2016,"Birthday celebration for 18.  No reservations accepted.  Patio seating available.  They brought extra umbrellas to provide shade.   Server was excellent.  Her name is not Isabella, that is her daughter's name tattooed on her arm.  She was friendly and attentive. Avocado egg rolls and crispy crab wontons were excellent.  I tried the Thai Salmon lunch portion for $14.99 which was a great value.  My favorite is miso salmon though.  Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake lived up to its name.  It was outrageously good!  The new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch cheesecake was good too.  My all time favorite is still White Macadamia Cheesecake."
Jayme D.,"Spring Valley, CA",247,20,8,4.0,4/19/2017,"My family comes to Cheesecake Factory when we can't decide where else to eat because the menu offers a wide range of food choices for each one of us. It's a sit-down place right by Barnes and Noble. You park in the mall parking lot and, if you're just walking in and depending on the time of day, can meet a wait time of anywhere from fifteen minutes to over an hour. The attire is pretty flexible; you can come dressy for an event or casual for lunch. The restaurant also accommodates group parties, although usually in a group event we've been seated outside. The food is usually somewhere between $12-$30 depending on what you order, and the wait staff are always really nice. Portions are generous. You get free bread and butter to tie you over before your entree comes out, and it's always a warm and welcome addition to your meal. The food itself can be a hit or miss because of the broad range of dishes they offer. I really like their salmon, broccoli and mashed potatoes dish, so if you're into fish I suggest you give it a try. For an appetizer, definitely try the tex mex eggrolls. As for seating, you can either sit at a booth/table inside or a table outside. The noise level is average (conversations around but not to the point that you can't hear yourself speak) and the seating is pretty intimate; the booths have high backs so you're pretty much in your own space. The cheesecake is also really good. If you're a chocolate lover, I suggest the Godiva cheesecake; it's rich and comes with a little Godiva square on top."
ellis c.,"Temecula, CA",110,4,,1.0,9/17/2017,"We had a very poor experience at this location. Appetizers were forgotten, meals were not very good, overcharged for items that came with specific plates and to top it off our waiter forgot we were celebrating a birthday even though we let the hostess know. We waited almost an hour to get our check.  After complaining to the manager he did bring a piece of cheesecake out for the birthday girl but we were not interested and just wanted to leave. We will not come back to this location."
shiryn r.,"San Diego, CA",98,19,,1.0,8/22/2017,"We came in at around 4 and no one was at the front to seat us so we helped ourselves to the bar area. Still, no service and several employees past us while we waited for any type of acknowledgement. After some time, we decided to leave and there were hostesses at the front who said the reason we didn't get any service was because they just switched shifts. We weren't helped at the front or in the dining room. Very upsetting. Do not come around 4 apparently!"
Justin F.,"Chula Vista, CA",226,214,189,4.0,2/10/2017,Me and my wife love coming here for the avocado egg rolls!!! They are definitely a must if you're an avocado fan. We also like the Skinnylicious Menu and of course all the variety of cheesecakes! Out of all the Cheesecake Factories this one by our house is me and my wife's favorite!
Eva A.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,3,2,3.0,11/16/2017,"It had been a while since I had been here, and I was a bit disappointed. The crew and service are magnificent; however, the food quality to my liking has changed. The Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls had way too much rice noodles, and I could never find the shrimp. I will not be ordering them again. The Jambalaya entree that I ordered and am very familiar with did not have the same consistency as before, and when I as ked the server for spicy, when it arrived at my table I had to beg for water. Besides those issues, I would recommend this family restaurant to anyone, the happy hour from 4 to 6.00 pm is very doable! BTW I attended Chula Vista, some other franchises do not have Happy Hour! :)"
Olivia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,21,10,4.0,1/25/2017,"The food was excellent! The catfish dinner was the best  I've had from a restaurant ever! The fish had a lite batter and was perfectly cooked. The plate came with mashed potatoes, roasted green bean and onions, and roasted corn. It's enough for me to have for lunch tomorrow! Mi esposo had the shrimp platter and he couldn't eat it all either. The cheesecake OMG! I couldn't even eat half of it.  I only gave 4 stars because there was a little problem with service. Had to ask several times for butter for bread that was cold by the time the butter came. I ordered my cheesecake first and had to wait so long for it to come that mi esposo had finished with his."
Eddie A.,"San Diego, CA",28,17,,3.0,1/8/2017,"As any Cheesecake Factory this place gets really packed especially on the wknds. Although there's a lot of parking areas, you will find that it is hard to find one nearby. (suggestion -  park by the library and just walk) Wait time average 30min to an hour (personal experience) Cleanliness - silverware sometimes have residues from poor washing, and the floor seems to be slippery. Food - Steaks are great!!! but hibachi steak is too sweet. Thai wraps are bomb. If you're going to order cheesecake ensure that it's freshly made (baked) The one they gave us tasted like a week old Service - expect to wait after you sat down. Your waitress might be too tired to provide the proper service (after taking your drinks and appetizer order about 10-15min wait). After taking your order (main entre) 10-25min wait for main food to arrive (always forget steak knife). Then, your waitress will disappear 'til you're almost finish with your meal so if you're looking for any assistance,... you have to ask someone else.  Overall - the food is the only thing that this place offers!!!"
Ros A.,"University City, San Diego, CA",540,269,761,3.0,8/21/2015,"I do like the food at Cheesecake Factory. Service and wait times aren't that great. Came on a weekday evening with a party of 12.  Service: - Our server seemed nice, but since he had our table plus several other tables he would often forget things. There were a few things we had to ask for 2-3 times. And during the wait in between appetizer and dinner, he didn't check on us.  Waiting: - Once we ordered our entrees, it took over 40 mins for our food to come. Some restaurants give kids their food ahead of time, but not at Cheesecake. - My aunt doesn't like spicy food. She had ordered the fish tacos and asked if the salsa/sauce was spicy. The server said no. When her food came out, for her it was spicy. So we asked them to re-make it since the sauce/salsa was on all the tacos. Her food took about 10 mins to re-make. Some were already done eating. In my opionion, the server should have put it on the side just in case.  Food: - To start off, we had the calamari. These had a good crisp and was served with two different sauces.  -I ordered the Chicken Picatta. It had been years since the last time I had piccata. The chicken was moist and had the right amount if sauce. The portion was a good amount, so I had enough for lunch the following day. - I tried the Classic Burger. This too was good.  Overall I would give 3.5 stars.  If the service was better, the food would make up for the long wait times."
Christos K.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,19,34,3.0,7/23/2017,Not happy with my experience. Small portions overpriced from the appetizers to the main course. Very long wait for our meal and when we did get served only half of us got the food and took a while for the rest of us to get their food.
Sandra P.,"San Diego, CA",6,54,47,5.0,10/16/2016,"Service was great, food excellent, I simply love this place. My kale salad was especially tasty today!"
Aby D.,"San Diego, CA",472,128,381,4.0,6/6/2016,"Our server Deanna was a sweetheart. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, it was a lot but the eggplant was a bit dry."
