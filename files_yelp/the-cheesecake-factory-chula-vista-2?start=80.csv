Ivan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,10,,3.0,10/12/2016,"I go to this please often cause they have a really nice view in the patio, and the food is good. But the service it's getting really,really bad. The waiter comes out,said he'll be back in a minute. Comes 10 min after, no water or bread I ask for, takes the order, I'm still waiting for water and bread but the guy doesn't show up. When he finally comes out with drink and food (spicy chicken chipotle pasta) it was cold, it really pissed me off. I was waiting to tell him, but he didn't came back and I end up eating my cold pasta. When he came back, I told him about it, and he brought a piece of cheesecake and a coffee, but guess what? I had to pay for everything. He only said ""I really apologize for the inconvenience ""  Very disappointed about the experience, the manager should talk to the employees or hire people who really qualifidoes their job right, we're not paying for getting anything for free, and I believe we deserve good food and good service, thanks. Ivan S."
Andrea B.,"Spring Valley, CA",1,36,,5.0,8/1/2017,"Honestly I only come to the Cheesecake Factory for their cheesecakes and every time I leave satisfied! I came here on National Cheesecake Day and Avraz (at the Otay Ranch Mall location), our server was very polite, humble and efficient; made sure we had enough time to order and asked how was everything. He made the dining experience quite pleasant as the whole restaurant was filled with families, crying babies and whatnot. I will definitely comeback!"
Brian C.,"San Diego, CA",2,8,,2.0,10/1/2016,"Today I thought I would treat the family to a nice lunch. It started off nice. The new cheesecake factory in Otay Ranch looks nice. But the staff is very lacking The guy who delivered the food told  me ""ya Boss"" :(   The women who took my order asked me if we should discipline the cook.  For forgetting to putting cheese on my kids cheese burger.   I asked for ranch like 4 times. The manager that dressed in all Black just looked and me and walked away."
Briana M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,1,2.0,2/12/2017,"The food was great as usual but we received subpar service. Our server Michaella H. wasn't very attentive at all. We asked for water several times before receiving it. We even had to ask for the complimentary bread that she never offered. Then when it came she only brought pumpernickel. She said she would be right out with some sourdough that was still in the oven. We never got it. We asked for it later again because I wanted it with my entree and even then she never brought any. This is very disappointing coming from The Cheesecake Factory. We love coming here and have never received anything less than excellent service before.  Also, some tables were moved for a large party and there was a mess where a table once was. We watched the MANAGER and several other team members walked by it multiple times and nobody ever bothered to sweep the mess up. I can't believe that any of this behavior is acceptable any time. But especially not on a Sunday evening with a full house."
Gerardo A.,"San Diego, CA",19,26,33,2.0,4/9/2017,There were more busy cashing out servers then thanking orders 20 min to get my cheese cake!!! Where were the managers . ????
Elize A.,"San Diego, CA",446,128,222,4.0,6/19/2015,"You won't have trouble finding parking, their parking lot is big. I try to avoid Cheesecake Factory during dinner time because it can get really busy. We only waited about 5 minutes during a Thursday afternoon around 2:30 PM. They have lunch specials until 5 PM that consists of ""lunch sized"" portions which I prefer because their dinner portions are always huge!  Our customer service was great and it was because of our waitress Jocelynn! I always had my water refilled, helped with what to order, and she always gave us bread. It wasn't fresh until the 3rd batch of bread she gave us, but it was still good. Who can say no to free bread? Get the whole wheat bread it's delish! (We had 3 rounds of it)  The food takes a little longer than most restaurants, even though it wasn't busy at all. It was the only downfall, however the free bread makes up for it. The food I got the skinnylicious grilled turkey burger, it was good and the portion was perfect; not too big not too small. The taste was also good I loved how it had grilled onions and mushrooms. It also comes with a green salad instead of French fries or any other unhealthy side which I loved! The green salad had a nice flavorful dressing and tasted fresh. I didn't even know about their new Skinnylicious menu until now, thank you Cheesecake! I tried sticking to my diet with their skinnylicious menu however we did order the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake for dessert. It was too sweet for me, so I just had a bite. :)"
William P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,20,55,5.0,7/10/2017,This is one of my family's favorite restaurant. We just had our lunch here today. Haley is our server and she is the best. Very accommodating. Attended to all our needs and always check on us if we are doing ok. Thank you Haley. You deserve a raise!
Misa A.,"Imperial Beach, CA",280,66,450,5.0,2/15/2016,"For the past 4 years, valentine's day at the cheesecake factory has been me and my hubbys tradition.  We came here for Valentine's dinner tonight around 6:00pm. We found parking pretty fast in the lot and then put our names down. They told us the wait was around 30 minutes so we decided to wait in our car because we have a little 16 month old crazy child. Weeell we ended up waiting for only 13 minutes!!!!! (HUGE TIP: We took our beeper all the way to our car cause there were no seats left and it still worked!!!!) On to the restauranting part!! We walked in, gave them our beeper and we were sat down immediately. Our  server was named Chris and he was sooooooooooooo nice!!! What really made me like him was he brought out a small plate of bananas for my daughter when he brought out the bread for us and I didn't even have to ask him for it!!!!!!!! I have never experienced such a nice yet simple gesture ever before at any restaurant ever!!!!!! I wish I could rate their customer service because it was impeccable. Soooo the food!!! We ordered buffalo blast appetizers which were amazinnnng. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken and my hubby ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and our baby girl wasn't too hungry after all the bananas, bread and buffalo blasts so we ordered her some french fries and shared our noodles. The food was sooooooooooooo good!!! I love their pastas I have never ever had a bad pasta dish there. We were soooo stuffed that we had to order our red velvet cheesecake to go. And after all the food we ordered our bill came out to only 63 dollars!!!!! I can't wait to go back and enjoy more pasta and cheesecakes :) Definitely my favorite location out of all the others in SD!!"
Sakae G.,"San Diego, CA",6,42,47,2.0,4/6/2017,"Goodness, I really wonder why I keep coming back here, when I'm let down every time. Oh, right, I have a few gift cards I don't want to waste. I think I'll go up to the Fashion Valley location to finish those off, because the Eastlake one has some issues. They used to be good and I used to love coming here, but the quality is going down big time. This is going to be a long one.  Before I talk about tonight, here is a summary of the last three times I've come here: 1) Med-well Hibachi Steak I ordered came raw/under-rare in the middle. Was dining with a chef friend who warned me not to eat it when I showed it to her. Had to have it corrected. 2) A friend and I both got food poisoning from either the Factory Nachos or the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes that we shared. 3) My Herb-Crusted Salmon came raw in the middle; the middle was a darker orange and semi-transparent. I noticed it when I took a bite in the dim restaurant lighting and the salmon felt like mushy sashimi in my mouth, so I used my phone light to look at it and discovered the raw middle. Gordon Ramsey would have slapped his hand on that ""RAW!"" salmon and made it explode if any of his chefs tried to serve that. (Note: In cases 1 & 3 a manager had my meal remade, but something is wrong at the core here if they keep messing up like this) TONIGHT: I'll try to keep this brief-ish: Fried Mac&Cheese appetizer was refrigerator cold in the middle of one of the balls, and the other 3 were just barely warm. The only tasty part of them was the breadcrumb crust and the marinara sauce they were served on top of. My entree--Hibachi Steak med-well again--was thankfully served med. But the potatoes were cold and the ""tempura asparagus"" was just the 1.5"" chunks of fried stalk and a few chunks of empty fried batter. My dining companion ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and guess what? You'll never guess. Ready? It was cold too! The shrimp was cooked to the point of being little rubber discs, the rice was hard and cold as if it had sat out for hours before being put on her plate in a cup-shaped flat-topped mound. She said the black beans tasted like they'd been poured straight out of a can onto her plate. But! The 3 plantain slices that came on with her meal were great and hot and we ate those dipped in the black pepper sauce, which was spicy and tasty as well. A little on the sweet side, but still good. I had a few bites of the Banana Cream Cheesecake I got to take home, and that was really good! (But I'm pretty sure that wasn't made here and was shipped in) For this much money ($75 tonight) I expect my food to be hot, fully cooked, and taste good. This Cheesecake Factory location keeps failing on all three counts. Also: Restrooms were dirty with tp in only 2 of 5 stalls, and the menus and salt/pepper shakers were coated in food smears and grime. Gross!"
Nick B.,"San Diego, CA",48,8,2,5.0,9/29/2017,Always the best chain even when they screw up they always make it right CCF always #1 chain
Chico R.,"Chicago, IL",0,96,11,5.0,5/28/2017,"I had dinner twice at the bar during my 2 night visit to San Ysidro. The quesadillas and guacamole I had were very good the one night. However, what prompted me to write the review was the service. Alexendra at the bar was great on my second visit. The night before the service was not horrible just not so customer friendly. Thanks Alexandra!"
Kathryn S.,"Chula Vista, CA",70,6,6,4.0,6/12/2017,"Whenever I go here I get pretty good service. The last time I went here it was my first time ordering alcohol. I turned 21 in December. To my surprise, the server didn't card me, which isn't a big deal to me but you'd think that they'd at least check."
Moses C.,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",920,87,205,4.0,11/2/2016,"Me and family always come to this location. It's usually generally not that busy.  Service: Its usually pretty good, never had a overwhelming experience but never left disappointed that I wasn't attended to.  Food: We always come here due to all the menu options, my go to is always the skinny menu.  Overall decent ran location. Usually pretty clean and staff is nice."
Claudia P.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,43,,5.0,9/13/2016,I just had lunch today 9/13/16 with my daughter and Shayna B give EXCELLENT service. The food is always delicious so really you can't go wrong. I was impressed by the exceptional customer service!  Thank you!
Tiffany J.,"Las Vegas, NV",228,121,39,2.0,7/20/2016,"I really don't like posting mediocre or even negative reviews. We must've come on an off night. I mean, it's Cheesecake Factory so there's an expectation of pretty decent but not inventive food. And an expectation of decent service as well.  Host stand: looked at my husband like he had 3 heads when we said we had 5 in our party.  We waited a few minutes for them to get a table ready. Followed her to the table, while passing 3 empty 6 top booths....to a booth for 4 where they put a chair at the end. Uncomfortable, but maybe they had cut the server in the section where tables that could actually seat 5 people were.  So they put an extra chair there but not another place setting. Also, our roll ups did not contain butter knives. So we were scraping our bread against the wrapper of the butter, and playing musical napkins. It was fun!   Service: server was in a hurry to get out. Barely spoke. Took our order and bounced.  The food runner dropped our apps down and left. No offer of ground black pepper for the Caesar salad. Maybe I overthought that one and CF isn't classy enough for that, but I swear I've been offered it before. Oh well, pepper shaker it was!  I should also mention that we were not offered share plates for the apps, so either we were using our tiny bread crumb covered plates, or eating directly from the plate itself. Good thing we were all family.  Food: chicken quesadilla was decent but guac was brown. Shirley temple was pink but had zero cherries. Caesar salad was okay but croutons were weirdly soft, like stale ciabatta bread that they didn't take time to toast. Carbonara was decent, but I find it strange that it was a white creamy sauce similar to Alfredo. Usually the carbonara I get at Italian restaurants doesn't have cream, or barely any, and the sauce is made with bacon grease/oil, pasta water and egg yolks. I could be wrong, or maybe this is just CF recipe.  The kicker:  the French dip. What a train wreck. I've never had a French dip that didn't come with, well, dip. Au jus. This was basically a roast beef sandwich on a hamburger bun. Yes, hamburger bun, complete with sesame seeds. Huh? I guess I was expecting a nice baguette and au jus to accompany. Again, maybe it's CF flair?  Well, it sucked. And the best part was, upon inspection, there were two corn kernels in it. If there was a bunch of corn in it, it would've made more sense. It would have been strange, but it wouldn't have creeped me out like two random corn kernels.  First world problems, yes. But when I'm spending $95 plus tip for dinner, I guess I expected a normal Cheesecake Factory experience. We still tipped $20 because we aren't a-holes, but seriously. Either this was a really off night, or it was the nonchalant B team working. They didn't even try."
Bernadette S.,"Chula Vista, CA",366,23,48,1.0,1/16/2017,"I've never given 1-star and unfortunately this was not the first time I've experienced the lack of service and attention from a restaurant of this caliber. We brought our clients to celebrate and reserved some of our comment to avoid our clients from feeling uncomfortable. Firstly, we transitioned between 5 servers within our first 10 minutes all while were confused and none could remember what we asked for. The following occurred during our dining experience my main frustration is my co worker and I split a LUAU salad which I requested with one of the 5 servers. The server that was on break came back with a full plate and I specifically asked the salad to be split into 2 bowls. The server proceeded to ""argue"" with me insisting this is against policy which is not true because another Cheesecake Factory graciously worked on this simple request of splitting a salad. Here is what else happened during our dining experience : 1) Rarely checked up on us several times my drink was empty and didn't ask if we could us refills 2) never offered hot water refills for our clients ""paid tea"" 3) Brought cheesecake with NO UTENSILS 4) We asked for more pumpernickel bread and it never came  5) We asked for straws and honey and no one came back with this simple request  6) Our dishes were not taken away when the cheesecake came out and clearly our plates were cleaned up and packed away. This by far has been one of the worst dining experiences to date since I've been living in the community since 2008. We dine our frequently and I now will choose to go to neighboring restaurants with better service. I've had another negative experience here but let's hold off on that story I believe I've made my point. Don't know what's going on here at this location and definitely not worth coming back - sorry!"
S. B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/1/2017,"I have been a long time customer to the Cheesecake Factory until I came to this location. It is the closest one to me, and every time I have gone there something has gone wrong. The first time, I was not allowed to bring my 7 month old baby in his stroller to the table. They wanted me to leave my expensive stroller by the door. The only option for the baby was to sit on my lap because he was not comfortable in a high chair yet. We ended up leaving because that would not have been a pleasant dining experience. After that, I ordered take out a couple times. But when I got it home, the order was completely wrong. It was a salad! My husband had to go back to the restaurant and get the right order. The final time, I ordered, my husband waited 45 minutes for the order and they didn't put in his extra sauce. If I ever want the Cheesecake Factory, I'll be driving to Mission Valley."
Cass W.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",70,3,,5.0,5/29/2017,I've been coming to Cheesecake Factory for quite some time now because it has a big variety in the menu and their food is pretty good! It also offers vegan options which I though was awesome of them to do because they didn't always have that on their menu. I definitely recommend checking this place out. Lots of food options!
Karlita S.,"Spring Valley, CA",61,1,,2.0,6/16/2017,"Not what I expected. Kinda expensive for their flavors, I ordered fried calamary as an appetizer and it felt like 1/3 calamary and the rest greasy stuff, the salmon was ok!"
Daisy S.,"Bonita, CA",1,5,1,3.0,11/3/2016,"This is my favorite location, and our waiters are always great. But the cooks? Ehh. Here's what happened... I had ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (one of my favorite dishes). When I first tasted my pasta, I noticed the pasta was undercooked. I told the waiter and asked if he could take it back and fix it. He then came back about 15 minutes later with a new plate.... but the pasta still was undercooked. My husband and son were nearly done with their entrees, and me being pregnant, I did not want to wait another 15 minutes again to get my pasta right. I ate a few bites and that's it.  I would still come back to this location but I would not order pasta here again.  PS: the Godiva chocolate cheesecake is to die for!"
