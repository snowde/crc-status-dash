Anthony G.,"Cincinnati, OH",70,5,5,5.0,1/6/2018,Who doesn't love cheese cake? For as many times as I've been to The Cheese. Ale Factory ( and it's been a lot ) I finally tried something new! The Chicken Bellagio was S O  G O O D ! Service is always great there as well. Our server Mitch killed! Super helpful! And the whites chocolate raspberry truffle is always dope
Anna S.,"Cincinnati, OH",249,314,759,1.0,12/4/2017,"The Saturday that my daughter and I visited for lunch, their kitchen staff were psychotically lazy about something as simple as splitting a freaking entree between two plates. I don't think the rude laziness was on our server's part, she looked like she was going to burst into tears when I gave her a probably stony stare of disapproval when she kept demurring about how the kitchen would refuse to split the Chicken Bellagio onto two places for my daughter and I. She told me that she would add the directions on the order but that the cooks would likely ignore it. GREEEEAT.  And, it wasn't the poor server who brought out the Chicken Bellagio ON ONE BLOODY PLATE, and who hastily managed to split the dish onto two plates at a station. I did NOT want to do it because we were seated crammed into one of those tiny two-person booths which was already overcrowded with water mugs and the bread plates. I asked the 2nd server what was the deal with their kitchen staff's attitudes about providing a minor customer service and she said ""oh you know, it gets crazy back there and they just don't have the time."" NONONONOOOOOO. What a weak excuse. It was lunch time and the place was half empty. If I'm paying $20 for one entree AT LUNCH then one cook back there should hopefully not be so incompetent that they can't plop noodles onto OMFG two separate plates *world spins off its axis*  Also, when we left, I was interested in their promo of buying a gift card for family members' Christmas presents and getting a free slice of cheesecake. But no, it was a bait-and-switch, you can't redeem the free cheesecake until 2018. I'll just get a gift card to O'Chucks or Olive Garden at Kroger and get the 4x fuel points promo - both restaurants probably don't have kitchen staff with misguided white collar egos that think their time is too invaluable to split a dish in half.  Cheesecake Factory, either scale down your menu to a manageable size or hire cooks that aren't so annoyingly lazy. And your food is already too overpriced to justify a splitting fee, but you may need to go that route if you can only find entitled kitchen staff to hire."
Schon B.,"Nashville, TN",16,46,9,2.0,11/16/2017,"Well, 8 minutes after our arrival, I was asked if we wanted drinks. The drink order was placed, as well as the order. Next I received some cold and crusty bread.  I heard the server telling the next table that they didn't have many people working. People have plenty of choices on where to dine when they try to determine where to dine. The meal itself was ok once it arrived; however the overall service has gone down at the Liberty location as well as the Kenwood location. A lot of better offers for less money. However if you have the time to wait and don't mind not getting refills, this might be the spot for you."
Vivian W.,"Burlington, KY",21,59,35,4.0,1/1/2018,"Have been here several time, this time i ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and Chocolate cheese cake. All taste wonderful. I would give 5 except the service is a little slow.. it seems take longer than normal time for the food to be ready.. and they don't take reservation. We were here at 1, get table at 1:45, when we finish lunch, it's already 4pm! It is a little crazy!"
Sandra H.,"Cincinnati, OH",20,85,354,3.0,9/21/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites. I shared two of my favorite dishes: Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, and the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. Both were prepare perfectly, as  was a birthday celebration, we also shared the Dulce De Leche cheese cake and the s'mores cheesecake, each with generous whipped cream. Service was excellent! For this time of day (4:15pm) service was abnormally slow.... over a half hour to get our entrees, and over 20 minutes waiting for bread. Both entrees were amazingly delicious, however the protein portions were unusually small."
Leif H.,"Cincinnati, OH",29,88,61,1.0,12/30/2017,"Awesome cheesecake but horrible service. Multiple times I've tried to order ahead carryout and am placed on hold forever. Because it's happens more than once, I actually took a picture of the call this last time. I called when I left my house and was still on hold when I arrived. Over 9 minutes on hold. I understand you're busy, but that is a little too long to be on hold.  I hung up and ordered inside. Who knows how much longer I would have been on hold."
Luke S.,"Cincinnati, OH",75,37,5,2.0,10/27/2017,"My wife and I got a gift card to here for our wedding, and there is a reason it took us 8 months to use it. First of all, unless you are out and about the Kenwood mall anyway, it is not a convent location.  Secondly, this place suffers from every problem of a chain. The menu is endless and the waitress did not know what to sell us. When I asked what they were best at, I was told everything. You simply cannot be good at everything. It took me forever to choose from their small book of a menu.  Finally, me wife and I each landed on a pasta dish and an appetizer. Even though the place didn't seem to busy, we had to wait on our table and wait for our server, a lot. The food was good. I had the cajun pasta. And while I enjoyed it, it's not the best pasta I've had.  Also, the pasta can feed two easily (definitely suggest one pasta for a couple), and the waitress didn't tell us that, but then laughed when we asked for boxes, saying: ""we are known for our large portions"". Well then, tell your customers."
Hannah H.,"Florence, KY",3,51,129,3.0,10/14/2017,"The environment: 10/10.  Very nice and elegant on the inside, which makes for a great space.  The food: fantastic! I highly recommend the crab and artichoke dip. It comes with a really large size portion of dip, but it definitely needed more bread which we had to ask for. I had the coconut lime chicken curry, also fantastic. It had amazing flavor, with roasted coconut on the top.  The cheesecake: super sweet, but really good. They have a good 35+ flavors, including seasonal flavors.  The Wait: On a Saturday at noon we had a 3 minute wait, which was a surprise, I anticipated it being longer.  The Service: The 3 star review comes purely from the lack of service we received. We had to almost beg for refills, from a server that wasn't ours, because we never saw ours. She never stopped to ask if we needed anything, never asked if we had everything we needed when delivering an appetizer, she would drop it off and run. Someone else delivered our main food. We asked another server for bread that they normally bring out, to which we were told we'd have to wait because there was none. I'm not sure how that happens if they plan for a weekend lunch rush. They used to box your food at the end of the meal, and today she just tossed the boxes and left. I'm not sure if that was only this occasion or if they stopped providing that service. Then we had to find her to ask for our check (I would have hoped the boxes would have been a clue we would like dessert or the check).  It's unfortunate that bad service left us feeling meh about the entire experience."
Heather A.,"Cincinnati, OH",1289,288,1184,5.0,4/16/2017,"Did you know that Cheesecake Factory serves breakfast on weekends? Did you also know they serve brunch on Sundays??? Not just brunch, but an amazing selection of gourmet food wonders that will fill your mouth with speechlessness!  Here are a few of their tantalizing menu selections, for which prose cannot do justice: -  Brûléed French Toast that tastes like cheesecake and French toast had a baby;  -  Chilaquiles with pulled pork and a tangy, warm verde sauce that rivals what you'd find at a beachside resort in Cabo;  -  Brioche breakfast sandwich with perfectly toasted brioche and thick, smoky bacon;  -  Breakfast Burrito with chicken chorizo and spicy ranchero sauce... The list goes on, but one of the most delightful surprises was the lemon ricotta pancakes! Fluffy, velvety pancakes with a hint of lemon and a custard-cake like texture that melts in your mouth. If fancy breakfast isn't your thing, they have all the classics as well, and the bacon is really good. Did I mention the bacon? Cheesecake Factory has breakfast dialed in. This is my first choice on any given Sunday from 10am until 2pm. If it's busy, the bar is first-come, first-served, and the service is quick! Enjoy!"
Thatcher H.,"Cincinnati, OH",7,50,21,5.0,11/1/2017,"This is our favorite date night place. We consistently visit this location and are always impressed with the food and the service. We have been on a loaded-nachos kick lately, but we missed the eggroll sampler, so we got that AND the nachos. Gluttony? Probably. Worth it? 100%! Make sure if you get the nachos to add the spicy chicken!"
Mavis F.,"Milford, OH",0,15,42,3.0,12/5/2017,"Overpriced is the word. If u like spicy food like me and pretty much all ur friends can't eat spicy food, that's the one u pick after shopping. Honestly that's why this restaurant is always located at shopping centers. However, their dessert is truely sth drive u back , only if u have a sweet tooth ofc lol And oh, never get their alcohol drink bcz U'll taste none!"
Samantha V.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,33,20,3.0,8/20/2017,"My husband and I came here for his birthday dinner. Long story short.. the wait wasn't bad, sat outside on a nice night. Server was nice, they were out of a decent amount of things and heard them telling other tables they were out of stuff. Our food took a really long time, to the point we considered leaving . All in all it was just a blah experience. Used to feel that Cheesecake Factory was a nicer place but it seems to be come more of an Olive Garden style. For the price I'd rather go next door to Maggianos"
Jared T.,"Cincinnati, OH",95,89,6,5.0,8/16/2017,"I had been to cheesecake factory many times before for dinner so there's not much more to say about dinner. One day after church I was looking for something different for brunch and found out cheesecake factory had a brunch menu. Let's just say that one time is all it took and I'm officially hooked and you can find me there every Sunday. I've had the chicken and waffle hollandaise which is extremely flavorful and filling. I also had the farmers omelette which was very filling. Both of these plates were hard to finish and made with typical cheesecake factory quality. If you didn't catch this from my post already, you need to check out the Sunday brunch!"
Justin K.,"Cincinnati, OH",167,40,17,4.0,2/12/2017,"Visited this location for the first time last weekend - I was very happy with dinner! We arrived at about 7:00pm and it was very crowded...even to get a table for 2 we were told it would be a 40 minute wait. No problem, as we are a young couple with time to spare. We walked around the mall and surprisingly got seated early, around 7:20pm. Once at the table, we went to order drinks and I was disappointed to learn that their draft beer lines weren't working. Not wanting to have a dry evening, we both ordered two mixed drinks. They were good and hit that sweet spot between too strong and too light. I got the Pineapple Mule and she had the strawberry lemonade. The bread that came before our meal was deliciously fresh and share-able. For dinner, I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken and she ordered the Orange Chicken with Rice. The portions were wonderful for the price. The meals had a really good flavor without being overly spiced and without fancy ""premiums"" - simple, delicious food.  For dessert, she ordered a slice of Tiramisu Cheesecake and I had the Oreo Cheesecake. We were both really happy with the Oreo Cheesecake, but something about the Tiramisu tasted...off. I suppose Tiramisu just wasn't our cup of tea. She actually ordered it as a recommendation from the waiter after we learned the Coffee Kailua Cheesecake is being phased off the menu...bummer! We left with enough leftovers for lunch the next day...portions are definitely large enough to do this. Throughout the night, our waiter was very friendly and service was what we normally expect: a good pace for the food and enough attention to feel like we were not set ignored during the dinner rush.  It made for a great date night and we will definitely return!"
Shekar J.,"Rapid City, SD",19,11,,4.0,12/15/2017,"Among all of the Cheesecake Factory locations I have been to, this one is among the better ones. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and treat you like old friends. Howard served us last we were there, and we couldn't have been happier. The only reason I give this place 4 stars out of 5 is because service, sometimes, can be a little slow. Otherwise, the food is always great, cleanliness is well maintained, and the overall atmosphere is generally very pleasant."
Mark S.,"Cincinnati, OH",105,179,177,4.0,5/12/2017,Friday night dinner at the mall.  50min wait so stauked a bar table (high tables are open seating)   Quick service and a nice selections of draft beers (local to boot!)   Club sandwich  is huge as are the burgers.    Bacon bacon is very cool as it has two types of bacon.   Just plan some time if you don't want to work the bar tables.  Always a long wait even weekdays so just be prepared.
Shi B.,"Covington, KY",170,22,56,5.0,5/20/2017,"So this is my update. Ashleigh our server earned the one star that my last visit lacked. I had the farfalle with Chicken. Everything about this dish made my mouth sing! The pasta omggg! But, let me stop. The QUESADILLA APPETIZER is what brought us back. Whaaat? A quesadilla that goes at a pasta place? Yasss. Try. It. You won't be disappointed.  The lemom meringue cheesecake, the end.  Ps. Ashleigh thank you thank you, you rock at your job. Seldomly our dining out is 110% on point from start to finish.. TONIGHT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT!"
Tatiana R.,"Miami, FL",136,19,13,1.0,12/2/2017,"Worst food ever. Thank God the waitress Kia was superb. We order a Chicken lettuce wrap taco that was dry, scarce and completely unappealing. The 'spicy"" salsa was poured straight from a can no doubt. This should not be in any menu from a decent restaurant. Then we order a Macchiato. They took about 15 minutes to make anything but a Macchiato. It was a big glass with something closer to a frapuccino, but hot. After we explained what an expresso with the foam is, they brought what in someone's mind resemblances it, yet is clueless. It ended up with a really distasteful American coffee. Not a place to eat. Nope."
Ron M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,30,,4.0,11/20/2017,"I had a Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake tonight for my birthday. So the restaurant is too loud and too big, the wait is sometimes too long, the service is adequate but not great, and the menu is the size of an encyclopedia. With cheesecake this good, who needs anything else? Every cheesecake is great and so is the white chicken chili, burgers, and most of their basic dishes. They struggle when they try to get too fancy. But there's always the cheesecake!"
Lily G.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,14,3,2.0,9/24/2017,"My server was obviously new. Or nervous? Perhaps both. While I understand being nervous or what have you, the amount of times I was walked away on was too much to handle. Three times I began speaking to her, and she just looked at me and walked away. I know there are great servers here, but this experience was too much to handle.  The apps took about 45 minutes. Which, in the grand scheme is a bit long, but I was gonna let that slide, until it came out wrong. These were simple requests, sauce on side, with extra sauce. It was the exact opposite. Sauce on. Very little sauce.  Then my entree was disgusting. I can't even remember what it's called. It was 2 chicken breasts with pasta on the side. Absolutely inedible.  I have had good experiences here. But this recent trip was horrid."
Andy V.,"Blue Ash, OH",10,125,53,3.0,10/30/2017,"First off, who doesn't love cheesecake? Came here on a date w the wife and I was surprised with how big their menu is... I tried to order the factory burrito but they were out of tortillas... who runs out of tortillas besides the chipotle by kenwood mall? I think I tried to also order something else (I can't remember, this was about a month or so ago) but they were also out. I ended up ordering the angel hair pasta with shrimp. Overall the food was pretty good but the size of the menu is kind of overwhelming. They should probably tame it down a bit rather than having a 15 page menu or whatever it was. I'm not sure if our waitress was really busy because they were short wait staff but it took almost 45min to get our food and probably 10-12min for our drinks. She only came around a few times. The cheesecake was probably the best part. I had the Reese cup and the wife had the Oreo cheesecake."
YumYumMeni J.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,63,116,3.0,8/14/2017,"The Jamaican black pepper shrimp is one of my favorite dishes here. It can be great at times. This time, the rice was really dried out. The accompanying sides also change from time to time. I also love the salmon fire cracker rolls, though the portion size has decreased over time. Solid steaks as well."
Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",236,436,1200,4.0,11/4/2016,"On this visit I decided to get my go to Buffalo Blasts as an appetizer because I wanted to try their burgers since I never had before. Let me tell you, they did not disappoint. I went for the mac-and-cheese burger and it was honestly really really good. It's basically a burger with a big slab of their fried macaroni on top..simple but quite tasty. I opted out of putting the pickles and onions on it that I had originally requested because I didn't want to mess with the flavor (it also comes with lettuce and tomato but I always ask for that to be taken off). The mac and cheese complimented the hamburger perfectly..like an extremely cheesy cheeseburger. The burger patty itself was kind of small in circumference but very thick and flavorful in the middle. This burger was good enough to warrant a place on my best burgers of Cincinnati list for sure! Also the waitress we had last night was amazing. So very friendly and attentive, I really wish I would've taken not of her name to give her a shout out. But yeah, I hope she's always are waitress every time we go there from here on out."
Kim C.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",97,2,1,2.0,10/15/2017,"Let me start by saying our service was wonderful! It's the food that we almost couldn't eat. We ordered the skinnylicous chicken samoasas, they were completely average. But we were starving. For our lunch we ordered a chopped salad. The dressing was the consistency of mayo, the apples we're, I'm not even sure maybe just the wrong kind of apple, EXTREMELY tart compared to the mild corn and avocado of the salad. It was bad. We were on a time limit so we didn't send it back. Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in a long time, and now I remember why."
Sandra F.,"Olive Hill, KY",0,24,,3.0,10/14/2017,"Our waitress was okay.  She was polite and brought our drinks and food in a timely manner.   My four cheese pasta was on the dry side.  My granddaughter and my husband's food were both good.  We ordered cheesecake for dessert and they were all very generous and all excellent.  We ordered the Birthday Celebration, Godiva, and the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, we would recommend them to everyone.  They are delicious."
Kelly F.,"Cincinnati, OH",55,95,94,1.0,4/7/2017,"Horrible service at the cheesecake counter tonight.  Arrived to an empty counter, ordered and waited for ten minutes while everyone who was helped after us got their desserts.  After nearly ten minutes, the girl at the counter (who took our order) asked if we were waiting for something.  I told her ""yes, the cheesecake we just ordered.""  She said they were making it, but they weren't.  We waited a few more minutes before asking again.  They had apparently put it cheesecake on the wrong side of the counter.  They barely apologized, didn't offer us anything for our wait, and my husbands slice of cheesecake is a complete joke for $8.  Worst experience, will drive to the location at liberty township in the future, or forgo Cheesecake Factory restaurants altogether."
Kimberly F.,"Middletown, OH",0,6,5,3.0,7/9/2017,"Very nice waitress(Page)., very beautiful restaurant. Not sure why, but, it took 45 minutes for appetizers. Is this normal? My husband ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, he Really liked them. I ordered the Cuban egg rolls, they were cold and not pleasant at all. Over all my opinion of this on a five star level is barely a three. But it was fun."
Bobby B.,"Hamilton, OH",0,8,,1.0,9/25/2017,"Worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory ever today. Beyond poor service and food being thrown together before giving it to customers. Nothing like receiving a single clump of pasta in the jambalaya... yes, one big clump... would have to use a knife and fork. Also, saw server one time without actually having to flag someone down. Then we get a manager with an attitude who wants to talk under her breath when I told her that there was a problem. She should be the first one fired... really really bad experience... I eat at cheesecake typically once a week out in Chicago, so hopefully this isn't a sign of how the company has decided to start treating customers... 9/25 update... wrote comment on site as suggested by Cheesecake Factory rep who responded to my yelp post...  never got a response to that either... obviously customer service must be low priority for them"
Mark E.,"Batavia, OH",4,38,1,3.0,5/12/2017,"Sadly this is all I could muster. The service was very good. That aside, I ordered the New York steak...medium.  Fail, the only rare part was next to the bone. It was tasty, but not what ordered.  I asked to substitute asparagus  (it said grilled on the menu) for the mashed potatoes.  So for the ""slight upcharge"" I got steamed asparagus. ..slight fail (I LOVE asparagus).  The cheesecake, however, was awesome  (as one would expect...given the name and all). All in all, not horrible, but I just expected more."
Eric M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,7,,2.0,9/26/2017,"The food is definitely a substantial upgrade from places named after a day of the week or a fruit or a pepper. In fact, I can't really say I've ever come close to needing to send back a meal for any reason. And, the Sunday brunch pancakes are awesome. Cheesecake Factory gets docked big time for the wait on seating. Every time I've been there the location near us is never really busy. Often less than half the tables are occupied. Somehow,  though, it is always a 10-15 minute wait while I stare at open table after open table. For a chain this size not to be able to properly staff their restaurant on such a consistent basis is rude and annoying. If the food quality ever drops I doubt I would ever dine there again. This is a problem that needs to be solved at the highest levels of corporate management. It sets a horrible tone even before a menu is delivered. Once seated the servers are consistently good and attentive, the respect for the customer's time is far from it."
Jana S.,"Cincinnati, OH",23,6,1,5.0,9/6/2017,I LOVE THEIR CHEESE CAKES.. makes my mouth water just thinking about eating some. Food is great and the beer is delicious
Darcy L.,"Clarksville, OH",66,108,30,3.0,1/22/2017,"So it's a chain restaurant.  Right?   I know it's a chain.  No judgment there at all.  I go here mostly for their desserts.  I'm not actually even a fan of cheesecake, but they have a few options that are made with lemon that are just delicious.  The Kenwood Cheesecake Factory has always been consistent, every time I've been there. Consistently busy (so consistently a wait for a table), consistently decent food, consistently decent service, and consistently moderately clean.  Sometimes the bathroom is dirtier than other times.  But it's never disastrous.  I've never regretted eating here. But why, for the love of everything holy, does the entire restaurant always smell like bleach?  It's so strong, it nauseates me.  I guess they're cleaning, but it worries me when the smell of bleach overpowers the smell of food in a restaurant that busy. I guess at least that's consistent, too..."
bob l.,"Cold Spring, KY",2,70,,3.0,3/19/2017,"This is the poshest ""factory"" i've ever been in. I was expecting a place a lil' nicer than ruby tuesdays but this place was near-palatial.  they had high ceilings with painted murals, fancy columns, tinted glass & dark wood partitions and marble floors. the menu was extensive with a spectrum from burgers & fries to pastas & salads to comfort foods to fancy faire. and let's not forget the cheesecake, how can you when you have about 20 different kinds to choose from. Prices are between high and too high. Portions were between good & plenty and almost too much. The wait staff was clean, nice & helpful. The atmosphere was kind of dark especially for lunch but would be just right for dinner. I paid $7 for a fair piece of cheesecake with toppings & all when i usually can get the whole pie for that much someplace else. I would recommend this place for a celebratory dinner but not just for a lunch or supper. The cheesecake I had was good but not $7 good, maybe only $5 good."
Grady M.,"Hebron, KY",3,28,47,5.0,3/1/2017,Went to The Cheesecake Factory today for lunch. I had the Factory burrito and original cheesecake for dessert. The food was good and our server Lisa was excellent. Will definitely go back again.
Ron R.,"Batavia, OH",4,17,,2.0,6/21/2017,"We had a party of five and were seated within the time frame given to us by the hostess. But this is where it ends. The service was horrible. When I say horrible, I am referring to 45 minutes for food delivery, 4 of the 5 meals delivered. The fifth meal, we were told they ran out of. So while we ate, the fifth meal arrived 15 minutes later. We then decided to order cheesecake. What a mistake, 20 minutes to receive our desserts. It doesn't end here. The manager came to our table and apologized for  the service, but offered no reasons as to why. Then after paying for our meals, it took the waitress 20 minutes to cash us out. Ridiculous!"
Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1000,3186,5.0,7/18/2015,"Chains aren't usually my thing, but absolutely ridiculously amazing cheesecake IS my thing. So I go to The Cheesecake Factory. A lot. My husband and I probably visit once a month. We split an appetizer and then we each get a slice of cheesecake and share (it's always better to have two flavors!). We usually go for Oreo, Reese's or Salted Caramel. If you don't like cheesecake, don't worry. Their menu has about one hundred pages. I'm sure you can find something. Even when it comes to desserts, there are options other than cheesecake. I would particularly recommend The Godiva Brownie Sundae. But you'll probably want to share because it's ENORMOUS!  I've tried a lot of different things on their menu. There are many good choices. Back in my vegetarian days when I ate nothing buy pasta, I loved their four cheese pasta and their alfredo pasta. But nowadays, if I want an entree, I'd go for their burger and sweet potato fries. It's also worth mentioning that they offer omelets all day long. Sometimes my husband wants breakfast for dinner and goes that route. But most of the time we want something light or small before diving into the hardcore sugar. If you want someone the lighter side, I would get their bleu cheese and pear flatbread, which was super delicious. Their Greek salad is pretty great too. But most of the time, my hubby and I go all out and share the crispy cuban rolls, loaded nachos or fried mac and cheese."
Mark P.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,4,,5.0,11/3/2017,"We enjoyed happy hour at the Cheesecake Factory in Kenwood Town Centre. What a great place for a happy hour. Beers were $4.00 and my wife's wine was $5.95. We enjoyed the Tex Mex egg rolls and Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. What excellent choices, both were really good and at $5.95 each were a great value. We sat at the bar and Linda was a very good bartender. She was attentive and cordial. I was a little skeptical of happy hour at a Cheesecake Factory, but it was a really nice treat. We also got a slice of cheesecake to go."
Brandy M.,"Middletown, OH",2,11,187,5.0,2/15/2017,"We've never had a bad experience here.  The past 2 times, i've gotten the Bang Bang shrimp and chicken. and delicious doesn't even describe it. no matter how busy it is, we always get our food in a timely manner and it's always delicious. 5/5 will keep coming back."
Andrew M.,"Saint Louis, MO",17,102,110,4.0,12/9/2016,I know it's a chain but I still.love the food here. My go to is usually Kobe Burger but this time had the Veggie melt minus the avocado.  It was a very tasty sandwich. We had a wonderful waitress who was very friendly and attentive. Of course we had a pice of plain cheese cake. Never had it before but it was just as good if not better than the flavored and dressed up ones.
Courtney P.,"Cincinnati, OH",122,172,36,2.0,9/15/2016,"Look I detest chains but I love The Cheesecake Factory. Yes. I said it.  I don't come here too often because I as much as I hate chains, I hate waiting to eat even more. I came on a Sunday evening between lunch and dinner and we only had about a fifteen minute wait which I was able to handle.  Our server was super nice, made great recommendations and conversation. I try to get something different every time I come so I opted for the lunch portioned spaghetti and meatballs and these buffalo chicken wonton things for an appetizer. My experience dining in was great. Here's where this place drops to 2 stars. My mother wanted chicken and biscuits brought to her  as she didn't want to come out. My friend and I did a little shopping and then I decided to call in the order before we walked back over to the restaurant. They said 25 minutes which was fine. We walked back after 15 and I paid and added 2 pieces of cheesecake to the order.  The line to order to go is a little crazy. It's difficult to tell where it begins and ends, people just stand everywhere (mostly in the way) and the worst part is the serious disorganization of the staff working the counter. I mean it's just straight up confusion. The 25 minute wait ended up being more like 40 minutes all together and I'm thinking 10 of those minutes was the staff not really knowing what to do. If I order takeout from TCF I'm doing the curbside to-go so I can avoid having to set foot in this place."
