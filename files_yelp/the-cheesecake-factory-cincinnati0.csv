Louise D.,"Covington, KY",83,196,30,4.0,11/23/2012,"I didn't expect much when I came here, but was pleasantly surprised. I had the meatloaf with steamed vegetables and the red velvet cheesecake. I had to ask boxes for both as the portions are huge! Our waitress was extremely friendly, a real delight! Would definitely come back when I'm at Kenwood!"
Ehrin M.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",40,22,2,1.0,10/12/2012,"Service is horrible for groups. Don't ever go with a group! We had a group of14 fmaily members gather for my birthday. And it took them over 45 minutes to finally give us the check. We had two waitresses, and a manager trying to figure out how to use their system, they couldn't print anything out for us. Finally my Uncle told them to splt up whatever they had for us on three checks and we would pay and be on our way. we have no idea what we paid for, and no one was helpful at all. They just don't know what they are doing."
Jenny T.,"New Providence, NJ",1,11,,3.0,8/30/2014,"Me went there for dinner without reservation. We were told the waiting will be 40 minutes and turn out we waited one hour and minutes. If not because my son in law went to check with them, the waiting time probably longer. Food is ok."
Adrian C.,"Cincinnati, OH",28,136,31,2.0,6/20/2012,"The last two times I have went to this location, service was good but extremely slow. It took an hour to get our food (we went during a non-busy time) and then another 40 min to get our check!  The food is good but for this amount of time I was miffed to say the least. Maybe next time I will just hit up the food court in the mall downstairs, as I can get my Yagoot and chick fil a in under 5 minutes."
Shari H.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,9,,4.0,7/31/2014,"Great variety (maybe too many to chose from?!)  large portions and great tasting. and as for the cheesecake, where to begine - well worth the 7-8 dollar pricing.....Very good, can't wait to go and try something different."
Robert M.,"Cincinnati, OH",60,477,7,4.0,11/12/2011,"Everything you need to know, The menu is huge.  The food portions are huge.  The bread with dinner is awesome.  The dessert is decadent.  So why 4 stars.  The food is uneven.  Sometimes you find something great. Sometimes the food is meh.  Rarely is its awful."
Julie P.,"Scott Depot, WV",7,6,3,5.0,3/23/2014,"Ive been to cheesecake several times For lunch and it was always okay but not great  Tonight's meal was a home run! I had beets and host cheese salad which was delicious. I thought the sesame oil was really a nice nutty touch but it was competing a bit with the strong flavor if the goat cheese. Still, really nice. The shrimp scampi was excellent. No noodles with it as it came with the steak Dianne. The medallions were done a little bit more than the medium I requested but still good. The sauce and mushrooms were delicious! It came with mashed potatoes which were so flavorful! The 3 were excellent and a good-sized portion. Yum! The service was excellent - especially the manager. He bent over backwards to make our wait more tolerable, bringing me a high chair to set the baby down. Even went as far as to bring her a little plate of sliced bananas and assorted bread! Wow. I was too stuffed for dessert but will definitely have to go again. Great dining overall!"
Jeffrey S.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,7,,2.0,4/14/2012,Food portions are great but dont believe the hostess about time for a table.  We were told 45 minutes for a table it took one hour and forty five minutes. When I inquired about the time they looked at me as if I was out of mind.  It's not worth iT.
Kevin L.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,8,,4.0,6/23/2012,It is really pricey. It has great food though. Good service. sometimes there is a long wait.
Colt Y.,"Houston, TX",14,36,2,4.0,11/29/2011,"Options galore, protions are huge and very consistent. Oh, and the Cheesecake is pretty good too."
Olivia Ou L.,"Columbus, OH",8,13,,3.0,2/18/2012,"In all, the cheese cakes there are fine. They are good-looking and yummy. One thing I am not satisfied is when you almost finised the half of a piece of cheese cake, you' ll strongly feel the cake is overly sweet."
Fwb G.,"Shalimar, FL",0,3,2,5.0,5/2/2009,"Wow!!! Incredible food n incredible service ! Anyone who gives a review below 4 stars, ur an idiot!!!! Ronald was our server and made our  experience wonderful, me n my friends loved it!"
Jason V.,"Hamilton, OH",23,4,,4.0,4/22/2012,We really enjoyed our dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. The shrimp tacos were excellent and I shared a bowl of the white chili with the wife. The only mild complaint is the 1hr 10 minute wait that turned into 2hrs.
Marcus J.,"Loganville, GA",17,78,7,4.0,9/7/2011,What's my favorite cheesecake? . . . It is the original with cream cheese topping. I ask for some fresh strawberries on the side!
Jeremie W.,"Fairfield, OH",0,2,,3.0,3/4/2012,been there last night with my girlfriend was OK  we eat avocado roll that was really good then we order Dian steak that was OK over cooked but i eat it all so :) i like the way it design and  service was very good thanks j
Mike H.,"Hamilton, OH",0,44,12,1.0,7/3/2013,"The food was average, the service was so bad that we had to ask another waitress to send over the manager so we could complain about our waitress who was still standing in the corner chatting with another waiter for 15 minutes. This was the last time I visit this restaurant."
Marie B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",152,590,53,4.0,2/3/2008,"This is a national chain, so their food is just that.  Not fabulous, but not bad either.  It was good.  Also, an extensive menu has something for everyone.  I appreciate how the restaurant is able to make minor changes to dishes to meet your desires (e.g., leave off this...add that).  The portions are incredibly huge, so be prepared to have a doggy bag (if you so desire).     A great place for a relaxed meal...also kid friendly and the prices won't give you sticker shock."
Val T.,"Cincinnati, OH",55,141,51,1.0,12/26/2009,Expensive corporate-designed food cooked in a production-line atmosphere.  Try Trio or Embers if you're in Kenwood and want a nice dinner.
Serena S.,"Madeira, OH",39,56,54,5.0,8/27/2009,I've eaten here several times and always enjoyed it. Sometimes it is really busy and there is a long wait like 30 min. It just depends when you go. During the week is the best time because it isn't crowded like that. Great food and cocktails and very tasty desserts and so much to choose from. I love the chicken piccata minus the capers. Mmmmm tasty. If you've never been here you are missing out.
Chris B.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,38,24,4.0,5/19/2009,"Vast and spacious, the Cheesecake Factory is huge, but waits are very long! So be sure to get a reservation, or you will work up an appetite waiting (which can be good, since the dishes are soo big!).  Their menu, is very large, so ask a server for help finding things.  There is much to choose from, but only a couple things for veggies like me!  Yet the food is very good, if you can stomach it (there WILL be food to take home).  The desserts are good, and varied.  If you've had the cheesecake, look at the others, there are some goodies outside of the cheesecake realm, like the Blackout cake, or the Chocolate Tower Truffle cake.  Anyway, its a great place to have a lunch at the mall, or have dinner with a group.  I recommend it."
