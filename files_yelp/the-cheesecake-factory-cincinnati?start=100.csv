Christina F.,"Clarion, PA",0,9,2,2.0,5/7/2016,"This is the second time I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory. The first time--barbecue bacon cheeseburger--was okay. Second time was spicy cashew chicken, and it was utterly repulsive. The sauce was gummy like it had been sitting for hours; chicken was rubbery and the rice was flavorless. The only reason this earns two stars is their fantastic (if pricey) turtle cheesecake."
Robert L.,"Bentonville, AR",14,158,,4.0,10/13/2013,"I went there for Brunch and had the monte cristo sandwhich.  First time I've ever had one.  It was good.  I really didn't care for the home fries that came with it.  They tasted like burnt potato shavings.  This would not prevent me from going back for their other food.  My favorite is the factory burrito.  Its as big as your forearm!  I also like the Godiva chocolate cheese cake and a cup of coffee.  The cheesecake is delicious but a hate to think of the calories and fat in it! Finally, the ambience is very nice with high decorated ceilings."
Amy E.,"Saint Louis, MO",136,499,30,3.0,7/8/2013,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in forever. I used to love it.  And yes, the cheesecake is still delicious- my go-to flavor is White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, and I enjoy every calorie-laden bite of it! However, the food is a bit overpriced, and underwhelming.  My Jambalaya Pasta was unbalanced, had too much lemon, and not worth it. The menu is overwhelming-- it is nice that they have a low calorie part of the menu for those who want to not indulge as much.  Service is fine.  I probably won't go back unless somebody else suggests it."
Kelly M.,"Cincinnati, OH",103,52,11,4.0,4/8/2015,"very good resturant! huge portions for a great price! GET THE FRIED MAC AND CHEESE! you'll thank me later!! i had the option of having the steak diane and the shrimp scampi. Both very good! i also had the red velvet cheese cake which was awesome!  only complaints were the bathrooms were quiet a mess. no toilet paper in any of the stalls and from people using paper towels to open the door were all over the floor, but hey im not eating in the bathroom so it wouldnt stop me from not coming back!"
Alyson M.,"Madison, AL",0,2,,5.0,10/13/2016,"Our server,  Megan, was terrific. We have a special diet and she could not have been more accommodating.  They gladly made substitutes. The meal was fast and hot and delicious."
Tabitha W.,"Cincinnati, OH",73,401,960,4.0,7/30/2013,"The only complaints I can think of for The Cheesecake Factory is if you get there at the wrong time, you might have a good-sized wait. Also, the prices can be on the high side depending on what you are ordering. Other than that, the menu is substantial with ample vegetarian options. Bread (and free refills) come with the meal.  The interior is always tastefully decorated with soft lighting.  Food is served in generous portions. And if there's one place where you're fairly certain you'll end the meal with dessert, this is it."
Cassidy W.,"Canton, MI",0,5,,2.0,3/12/2016,"Good food, however they need to let you know there's an up-charge for ingredients if you would like to substitute an item. A salad went from $11 to $21 by substituting a different protein and I wasn't made aware of this until my bill came. The manager only wanted to take care of the problem because I appeared ""upset"" not because it was the right thing to do."
Glenn C.,"Cincinnati, OH",887,887,858,4.0,1/5/2013,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this location.  It is always packed!  90 minute and 2 hour waits are not out of the ordinary. It's part of Kenwood Mall so put your reservations in and then go shopping! Huge menu makes it harder to choose.  I do have my favorites like Chicken Madiera or Salmon/Chicken Madiera combination.  The Chicken Madiera has a nice sauce and comes with Asparagus.  If you are Steak person the Rib Eye steak is excellent and so is the Steak Diane.   You can have the Steak Diane as a combo with the Salmon or Chicken Madiera.  The Steak Diane is a little spicy since it has a lot of pepper in it.   Portions are huge!  They also have smaller portions and health conscious options.  You can get a small side salad instead of the giant $10 Caesar or specialty salad that can be a meal by itself.  Cheesecakes are awesome but I have an issue on why my ""togo"" pieces are never the giant ones they show in their case.  They have a separate stash in the back freezer.  In November and December you get a free slice of cheesecake with every $25 giftcard purchase.  It's good from 12/26 until early February.  Buy yourself the giftcards before eating your meal."
Sara S.,"Cincinnati, OH",42,254,47,3.0,8/14/2014,"My husband and I visited this Cheesecake factory location last weekend for our anniversary.  The food was pretty good (he got some sort of chicken with pasta, and I got a chicken salad sandwich).  The service was decent (they are always super busy!).  The thing that I didn't like was the cleanliness (lack of!).  My husband had dirty silverware, and I didn't even get any (I ended up using one of the forks that they brought out when my husband told them that his silverware was dirty).  I saw the table next to us send back a dirty plate as well.  We will definitely eat here again (my husband looooves the cheesecake), but I will inspect my utensils next time."
Regina R.,"Torrance, CA",11,241,2,3.0,3/15/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain restaurant. It's delicious. I'm a sucker for their corncake appetizer. I could eat that as a meal. In fact, I do eat that as my meal. Yummers. Also, I love their lemonade, served with sugar crystals around the rim to offset the tart-ness.  We also stop in here for dessert for a special treat with friends. Even the chocolate cake, which is not a cheesecake, is decadent and good. And the atmosphere is special/classy if you're looking for an added umph to your evening. Prices are pretty fair considering the quantity of food you're getting. If going at a popular hour, I'd recommend a reservation. We've also shown up later in the evening and immediately gotten a table. I also recommend sharing because honestly, who can finish these portions? Issues mainly revolve around the fact that it's hard to choose from a menu that is simply way too big. Also, we really find that all the flavors of cheesecake are too sweet. I mean, I want to order something different, but in the end, I always go with the original because I find all other flavors to be too sweet. I can't finish a slice by myself, that's for sure. Several times I've tried asking ""what's your least sweet cheesecake"" and gotten no where. The one time I ordered the strawberry cheesecake, I regretted it. The strawberries were covered in sugary red goop, which was just sugary nastiness. Also, their coffee is terrible."
Dave L.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,108,5,3.0,1/17/2016,"Closer to four stars than 3. Incredibly broad menu/food choices. Enjoy eating at the bar...where they pour a good stiff drink. Cheesecake still best part, but can usually reliable food and service (at bar, cant speak to table servers). Always see,s to be a short wait..."
Matt W.,"West Chester, OH",20,1,2,1.0,12/27/2014,"My friend and I met up today for lunch. We went to the Cheesecake Factory at Kenwood Towne Centre near Cincinnati. After circling the parking lot for what seemed like a year, I found a spot out front. While waiting outside for my friend to show up, there was this putrid smell coming from the dumpsters behind this Cheesecake Factory location, near their outdoor seating area. They didn't even try to hide it (see photos). After watching cheesecake employee after cheesecake employee come out and dump trash, I wasn't really hungry anymore. When my buddy showed up, we opted for Magianos instead where the food was good and the restaurant didn't smell of trash and grease. 0/5 will not visit again. I imagine the health inspector wouldn't like this."
Renee M.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,68,3,1.0,11/2/2014,Geez.  Just getting cheesecake to go and the girl has an attitude. Is it so difficult to smile and be nice?  Hoping the cheesecake is still good. Just got home with the cheesecake and got one of the three I ordered. Two were not what I asked for. Ugh. Check your orders before you leave.
Al W.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,9,,1.0,7/27/2016,"Disappointed. Chicken used on sliders came out between burned and over cooked. Sent back to be recooked after manager agreed the food should not have not come out the way it did. Waited another 38 minutes while the rest of my party ate- still no food those of use that ordered sliders. After telling waiter and manager food had not arrived waited 12 more minutes for it to arrive in carry out boxes. To my extreme disappointment they had taken the pieces of chicken that are normally on a slider and cut them in pieces to use on several sliders. The pieces were the size of quarters and covered less than 1/4 of the bun. There was no attempt to rectify this situation, the manager actually would not come back to the table, he was busy."
Kayla S.,"Cincinnati, OH",8,31,6,5.0,5/19/2014,I love going here. I go probably once a month. The Philly cheesesteak sandwich is delicious!
Anu G.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,27,,3.0,7/25/2016,"Food was great. Prices are way too high. Okay ambiance and decor. We had to wait for about an hour to get a table on a Friday Lunch, whereas we only agreed to wait as the server said it should be 20 minutes to half an hour."
Nikhil S.,"Batavia, OH",118,26,10,3.0,9/23/2015,"Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was delicious, eggplant parmigiana was a disaster, bland and eggplant wasn't cooked fully. Had to send it back and order a replacement. Strawberry shortcake and Tiramisu was awesome. Service is top notch and ambience is beautiful."
Mackenzie L.,"South Lebanon, OH",0,27,,4.0,1/3/2016,Went for lunch today. Had an average experience.  I am an often goer of this restarurant and this afternoon was unusual. I am not one to complain about food at all but today the pasta was waaaaay to spicy that I truly could not eat it. The waiter laughed and didn't offer to do anything
Beth B.,"Cincinnati, OH",29,11,6,2.0,9/19/2015,"I went with my mother-n-law and sister-n-law we went at lunch and it wasn't very busy so we got seated quickly. The second we got seated our waiter was already there asking if we were ready to order. We told him to give us a few minutes he did and then after we placed our it took another 30minutes to get served. I'm not a fan of this place never have been. Plus, the food is mediocre at best and over priced."
Ricardo J.,"Dry Ridge, KY",1,24,1,2.0,10/29/2014,"Fish & chips need to be called fish and fries.  Batter sticks to the fish and was limp, but this is an issue amongst most punters who think they can make fish and chips.  Go to Manchester and order it, if its not in newspaper, it's not the real deal.   Cheesecake...  Excellent."
