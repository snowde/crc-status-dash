Ivet V.,"Newport, KY",87,118,760,4.0,7/30/2015,So in honor of national cheesecake  day I had to make my way to the cheesecake factory to get some delicious half off cheesecake. Granted i waited about an hour to get an oreo cheesecake and a regular cheesecake with strawberries for later. You can't beat half price so it was worth the wait
Esther K.,"Cincinnati, OH",282,124,14,3.0,8/30/2015,The menu is very expansive and has different choices from all over the world. Was excited at first but the food was mediocre. Better to have a small number of items on a menu then lots of ok stuff.
Kalelah W.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,1,,2.0,6/17/2016,"The setting is beautiful and seems to have pretty good management, I been maybe 5 times. I've always put it high on the list  just because of it's cheesecake, however the menu has so many random items and it's hard to find a decent dinner, the food is overrated. The last thing I ate was the chic Alfredo pasta--yuck, I was so disappointed  I wasted my money. I noted to never go there again, they need better cooks!"
Katie K.,"Cincinnati, OH",116,160,1,3.0,7/25/2015,"Ehhh... Overpriced and mediocre. Won't be back unless others recommend to meet here. Long lines for average food. $100 for 2 people, we should have gone somewhere local and upscale but had a gift-card. Not much more to say!"
Evan M.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,17,6,4.0,9/11/2014,"I have eaten here many times. This trip I stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar. I ordered the Firecracker Salmon appetizer and a slice of the Godiva Cheesecake.  The Salmon was good, my only complaint is that if their menu says the appetizer is enough to share, I expect a little more. Especially since it was only $2 cheaper than some entrees I was eyeing. The dish is strips of salmon, wrapped in spinach, and then wrapped in a large won ton style wrapper and fried until crisp. It has a spicy miso sauce served on the bottom of the plate (that isn't spicy at all). The plate it's served on is quite large, but there's only 4 pieces. There is a HUGE mound of raw red cabbage that serves as a device to prop up the salmon and make it look pretty. I think they would be better served by doing something with the cabbage. Make it an Asian slaw, or swap it out for something else like a salad of some kind. As it is, who wants to eat dry shaved cabbage? They missed an opportunity there. Still it was quite tasty.  And the cheesecake? Let me tell you, I don't like cheesecake. However, I will eat it from here. The Godiva cheesecake is so rich and chocolaty... it's heaven. It's a flourless Godiva chocolate cake on the bottom, Godiva chocolate cheesecake on top with chunks of Godiva chocolate in the middle. And lots of whipped cream. What more can you ask for? Next time I may skip the Salmon and just go for an entree. Why pay $11 for that when I can get a full entree for $13?"
Robert L.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,96,,5.0,6/21/2016,"This place is where your diet goes to die. The food is good for a chain but nothing spectacular. The desserts are the main point of coming here hence the name of the restaurant. The Vanilla Bean Cheesecake is onnnn pointttttt. The waiters here actually like their jobs unlike most restaurants, I would think they make good tips. Anyway if you want to enjoy life and put on a few pounds eat here. I would recommend this restaurant to any man, women or child."
Shannon D.,"Medford, MA",94,159,76,2.0,11/9/2013,"We generally have good experiences at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but a few things were very off with our lunch yesterday at this location. First off, our server was extremely unfriendly and some what rude. I politely asked to get some sugar for my iced tea. It took our server about 5 min. to bring some and when she did she slammed it in the table, said nothing and went on  to her next table. We had to ask her to refill our drinks a few times, and after she finally refilled we said thank you, but she never once said your welcome or smiled or anything. We are easy to please and very polite, but she treated us like we were a burden. As far as my food goes, my Cuban sandwhich was pretty dry and the pork did not taste fresh. My meal was not worth the $13.95, especially with the poor service. I will go to another Cheesecake Factory again, just not this location."
Jeremy R.,"Fort Myers, FL",34,70,1,4.0,7/31/2014,Great tasting food but let's be honest everyone comes for the cheesecake! Which is amazing here! The prices are a little high but who cares because it's the only place in Cincinnati with the selection of cheesecake they have! Everyone must go and at least see their selection!
Tricia M.,"Marysville, MI",10,33,61,4.0,7/2/2015,"I had a late lunch with my sisters. At first we started off with the Crab dip, when it came it had a weird, off smell so we sent it back. We all got other appetizers and drinks, they were all tasty and we all enjoyed everything! The appetizers were all large portions. I got a cup of the Wild Mushroom soup, it was delicious but huge!! I also got the Thai Lettuce Wraps and it was enough for 3-4 people. They were really good! Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. She couldn't do enough for us."
Jay H.,"Florence, KY",270,235,175,4.0,4/1/2014,"Had lunch here with Toey. I ordered my favorite. Avocado egg rolls...yummy. The green dipping sauce is unbelievable. Toey ordered the Mango drink, that was good. Onto the main course. Ordered the BBQ ranch chicken Salad. The portion was huge. A lot of stuff inside of salad red beans, chicken barbecue dressing avocado and cheese. Onto desert Godiva chocolate... Sensational!!!  Only downfall was kind of pricy for lunch, wish there was a lunch special. Will be back."
Deborah G.,"Lebanon, OH",1,22,45,5.0,8/19/2014,"Stopped in to pick up dinner ""To Go."" Friendly front counter individual who directed me to the cheesecake counter. Appreciated the patience extended while I tried to make up my mind. Final choice was Jambalaya and Dulce De Leche with caramel cheesecake. So delicious!"
Sarah T.,"Huntington, WV",29,165,83,4.0,5/11/2015,"We made the mistake of trying to eat here on Mother's Day, and when I saw the giant line of people waiting outside the door I almost backed out.  Miraculously though, since there were only 2 of us, we were seated right away.   Our server was very busy but friendly and attentive. He brought us bread while we were waiting for our appetizer, and none of the food took very long to arrive (shocking considering how busy they were).  The food was good.. It was similar to other Cheesecake Factories I've been to.  We split the Ahi Tartare for an appetizer and it was Delicious.  I was a little worried to try it, because I've had both amazing and disgusting ahi tuna from different Cheesecake Factories in the past.  We both had the grilled fish tacos.  They were good, but the corn tortillas were falling apart.. I gave up and just ate the filling with my fork (my husband managed to eat the tortillas and just had messy fingers after). It was still tasty.  Their house cabernet was yummy, and the tiramisu was Fantastic!! Very very yummy.  It was also massive so I'm glad we shared. The bathroom was starting to get dirty when I went in, but there was someone cleaning it, and considering how busy they were it wasn't bad at all.  Overall it was a nice visit!"
Carolyn B.,"Cincinnati, OH",348,330,1136,4.0,8/14/2013,"The food there is absolutely amazing although the food is a little pricey.  Often my daughter and I will order a couple of dishes and share them, then still not have room for dessert, so we will get something to take home!  The cheesecake is delicious enough to drive there just for that alone!  Even while you are waiting for your order, you can look at the amazing decor!  There are some times when the wait is too long though, but that just shows how popular it is."
Gabi R.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,1,,1.0,8/30/2015,"Not a good experience here today. First off they were out of meatloaf, which is a specialty item. Then the chicken Baja tacos I ordered instead were awful. And I'm not a picky eater. Service very slow. I will think twice about coming back."
Michele G.,"Loveland, OH",2,110,46,4.0,10/5/2013,"Pleasantly surprised! I was expecting your typical chain restaurant fair but everything was yummy and fresh! I had the cream of chicken soup, it was loaded with fresh mushrooms and big chunks of chicken. We also had the luau salad, very , very tasty. The chicken and biscuits was great also! The only negative things are the menu and seating. The menu is huge, like a novel! Makes it hard to choose something. The seating is such that if you are only two people you end up at tiny tables practically on top of the people next to you. I will definitely come back."
Kylie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,17,2,2.0,12/22/2014,No draft beer and the bartender didn't share the happy hour menu with us until after we paid. Not cool.
Jennifer N.,"Cincinnati, OH",66,124,7,4.0,10/12/2014,I went here on a Saturday and I expected it to be crowded but much to my surprise I waltzed right in grabbed a table and sat right down. The menu is huge ( I also knew that) but since the menu was so huge I took awhile to glance over and decide what to order in fact I changed my mind several times in my head. Finally I decided on something proceeded to eat some bread in meantime while I waited for my meal. My salad arrived and I must admit Cheesecake Factory does make a delicious ranch dressing. Finally my flatbread pizza arrived which was delicious. I was thinking about ordering cheesecake but I was extremely full so I passed. Maybe next time!! The servers were attentive as always and ambiance was great. As I was leaving people were lined up all over the place so I definitely picked the right time to go when I did. I definitely will return because I definitely do need that cheesecake!
Amanda C.,"Cincinnati, OH",53,221,192,3.0,5/11/2012,"It seems like the Kenwood Cheesecake Factory has deteriorated in the last few years. I used to really love the food here, but my last experience was disappointing. The Thai chicken pasta was so bland that I sent it back, and the sliders I ordered in its place weren't much better. As always, the cheesecake was stellar, so I would suggest the Cheesecake Factory more as a dessert stop than a dinner option. Not relevant to this review, I find the Cheesecake Factory's promotional emails incredibly self-serving and unfriendly. The ""specials"" are distinctly un-special, so I can't recommend anyone sign up for the mailing list."
Kevin W.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,22,6,2.0,7/29/2015,"If you want their cheesecake, which is very good, then get it to go.  Otherwise, I just don't understand the attraction.  The food is good, but not worth the wait nor the prices.  Parking at this location is not easy either.  There are so many other places to eat near here that I just don't understand why someone would go back again (except for dessert to go)."
Jenny B.,"Cincinnati, OH",10,72,54,3.0,3/19/2015,Decent place great options for everyone. The wait is always long bit that is testimony to their good food. I got the skinny chicken pasta. Delicious fresh and light. The app was lacking - cheese that is - however the pasta made up for it. Always a tough choice trying to pick a dinner here and not to mention dessert.
