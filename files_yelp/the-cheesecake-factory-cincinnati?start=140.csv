Cynthia R.,"Woodlawn, KY",158,265,15,4.0,9/8/2013,"Five. Five dollar. Five dollar happy hour appetizers (much better than a Subway footlong). Can't go wrong with the $5 fried mac and cheese balls. Salivating now just thinking about them. Awesome value and perfect for splitting with a friend or 2. And of course, the cheesecakes. And gigantic menu. And faux-fanciness without the pretentiousness of actual-fancy places. I love it all."
Betsy H.,"Burlington, KY",0,17,,1.0,4/13/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory, thank you for ignoring my repeated attempts to fix what should have been a simple customer service issue. But now, I choose to reach you where you might actually care about what your customers have to say. The Kenwood,OH Cheesecake Factory services sub par food at extreme prices. You couldn't make meatloaf and nachos that were edible. You refuse repeated attempts to contact you, the managers suggestion was laughable, and your online request to contact the customer relations email address also offers deafening  silence. Leaving the hospital visiting a family member on Easter Sunday should have been an easy request for a take out order. I called the order in, waited almost an hour to find the food was sitting behind you the entire time I waited in the lobby. The empty lobby, may I add. That should have been a clue.  Drove 45 minutes home, with what i knew was already cold food. but it was going to have to be reheated at some point because of the long drive. Little did I know that the food would have been packaged completely inedible. You char burn meatloaf. There was not one trace of the original meat. The potatoes you will be happy to know was used to plaster a large crack in the wall. You're request to contact  corporate customer service echoed with the deafening silence.  If I could rate this location any lower I would.  BTW my daughter would like to thank you for the explosive diarrhea from the Factory Nachos. Sorry not sorry, another lost customer."
Sandra F.,"Cincinnati, OH",367,1347,4643,3.0,12/1/2011,"This place is overrated.   The menu is alittle overwhelmin and the cheesecake isn't all that great.    I will say this, I do like the carrot cake (it is really huge!),  the Avocado Eggrolls, and Chicken Potstickers."
Mark F.,"Cincinnati, OH",129,447,226,4.0,2/21/2012,The Kobe beef burger is superb! Steve Kammerererer is the best waiter you could ever ask for. And he's a professional bowler.
Ben C.,"Cincinnati, OH",29,8,7,3.0,4/9/2015,Solid food. Service is questionable and it's definitely over priced but I will go again I'm sure.
Dale H.,"Edgewood, KY",74,80,228,4.0,2/11/2015,Very good food!! Very good service!!! The cheesecake is by far better than anywhere else!! The Fettuccine Alfredo was very good I added shrimp for extra $$$...
Ronnie R.,"Cincinnati, OH",39,3,,1.0,4/2/2015,"First, I tried to complete a guest survey online but there is no ""invitation reference number"" located on the receipt for me to enter. Let me start out by saying that our waitress was kind and very nice and personable. The experience of dining at Cheesecake factory in regards to the service put forth and the cleanliness I encountered was nothing less than deplorable.  I waited for 10min after being seated to request am ice water with lemon and the other party that was with me ordered a pomegranate mixed beverage.  The server returned with news that CCF no longer serves anything with or associated with pomegranate. So another beverage was requested. As we sat and waited my friend noticed the silverware and napkin was filthy. They had actually been used and the fork had cake frosting and crumbs on it. The spoon as well. The napkin had what appeared to be chocolate or some other stain on it. Soon after the drinks were brought to the table and the water was without lemon.  We notified our server about the silverware and she viewed it and cringed. She exclaimed that ""it must have been mixed up with the clean silverware or something because that is not even remotely clean and I am so sorry!"" At this time I requested the lemons for the water, again as well.  She left and returned moments later with a new set of silverware and a napkin.  We placed our orders for salad and lettuce wraps and waited. About 15 min later the order arrived.  When the server returned to check in my friend ordered another beverage. Several moments later the server returned to notify him that no alcoholic beverages could be served once the restaurant closed.  We finished our dishes and I ordered cheesecake once the server returned. That was brought out about ten mins later. I requested a fork and was told that she would be right back with one. Literally 15 minutes later, still no fork. My friend left the table to try to get someone to bring a fork. By this time the cheesecake was unappealing as it sat on the table thawing and the chocolate and whipped cream melting. (It was uncomfortable heated in the back of the restaurant.) Finally a fork was brought out with several apologies. A co-worker came to the table and said that our server was dealing with the manager over some drama in the back and that it wasn't her fault. Anyway, to keep the peace I ate some of the cheesecake. Our server returned and inquired how it was, and I told her it was honestly terrible. She said, again I am so sorry, and if we would like our checks or if there was anything else she could bring us. At this point we asked for the check.  The check was brought out and to our surprise the drink that my friend had ordered but was not served was on the bill.  This resulted in another wait in which my friend left the table to get rectified. The server explained that the manager did take it off the check and that the copy we were given was incorrect.  We paid and then left the table. As we walked out another staff member apologized for the issues and said to have a good night.  So, this is the experience my friend and I had. And yes we left gratuity, the girl has bills to pay. But again, this was our experience. I will not be returning to Cheesecake Factory because this is the 2nd time in 3 months that I have visited CCF to only regret it. The last time I was there the waitress blatantly requested we hurry it up because they close at 11pm. This was at 10:35pm. We were rushed out and it was just a rude gesture on her part, which is why I had not returned until recently. But this experience takes the cake - really!"
Jennifer B.,"Maineville, OH",0,10,,4.0,4/30/2015,Gotta love the Cheesecake Factory. The food is amazing and the service is always good! The menu is Huge! So much to choose from! I always try something different when I go. I just love the variety. There's something for everyone. The only bad thing it's usually pretty crowded! That's the only bad side!
Dane D.,"Medford, MA",75,105,12,2.0,11/9/2013,"So generally we have had good experiences at these establishments. This time however our server was in no way good. I wish I kept the receipt and could contact the management there about our experience. She had an attitude that we were bothering her by having to serve us and when my wife asked for sugar for her unsweetened Iced Tea, she brought it to the table and literally dropped it and didn't even apologize, but quickly left. We asked for the wheat bread only and she gave us an attitude, like we were being needy. The food came out in a bit of a longer than expected time, but the place was pretty full, so I won't fault them for that. My Santa Fe salad was good, but I don't think they gave me the right dressing, since I thought it was suppose to be a spicy-peanut vinaigrette, but I am pretty certain I got their Cilantro dressing. My wife got the Cuban and the sweet potato fries upgrade, but the pork in the Cuban was very flat and disappointing, but overall the sandwich was not bad. I was waiting for at least 15 minutes to get my water refilled by our lovely waitress and when she noticed that it was completely dry she neglected to even apologize for the neglect. Overall we have had generally good experiences when going to most locations, so we will visit another location in the future, but not likely this location."
Nina W.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,7,9,3.0,2/20/2015,"I dined here this evening and the atmosphere was crowded and dimly lit. Dim lit restaurants are a big fat negative for me! Besides that it's a lot of people bumping into you and less manners. I ordered quesadilla's. Nice portion and tasty. Served with sour cream, lettuce, salsa and guacamole. Service was just okay."
Neil H.,"Cincinnati, OH",12,68,10,2.0,2/24/2013,"Let's start off with the only reason we went here was for my daughter's birthday...she had to go to the cheesecake factory.   After waiting 1hr 45 min (!!!, mercifully we had things to do in the mall), we were finally seated.  We were greeted by our server quickly, the service was good. Now to the food...I had a spicy chicken salad, which wasn't spicy at all, and the chicken was lukewarm.  a couple of my kids got corn dogs, which had some nasty long john silver's style batter on them, one had the chicken fingers which she liked.  the fries that came with their meal were warm, but not hot, you could tell that had been sitting for a while.  my wife had some salmon that she didn't care much for. Overall, there is no way that this place is worth that kind of wait.  The food is pretty mediocre/bad, so do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
Lauren D.,"Midland, OH",96,55,144,3.0,11/14/2014,"We went here for my younger sisters birthday dinner, this is the first time I have been there in a very long time. For a group of 7 I feel like the service was very good and our waiter was nice. They brought out free bread as soon as we sat down. For appetizers we got the fried mac and cheese balls, summer rolls, and soy edamame. They only thing I would recommended from those would be the summer rolls there a nice crisp refreshing app. For dinner Jon & Clara  got the old fashioned burger and added bacon they thought it was very good. My dad got the Santa Fe salad the only thing he said about it was that it was huge. Two of my sisters got the da Vinci pastas and weren't very fond of them. My mom got the skinny enchiladas she said he favorite part was the cold vegetable salad that came on the side. I got the Tuscan chicken which was huge had three decent size pieces of chicken how ever the flavor in the whole dish was lacking all you could taste was oil. The cheesecakes we got were pumpkin, Godiva chocolate, and raspberry white truffle. Those were all good my favorite is the Godiva chocolate. Overall the experience was pretty good but the food just wasn't really anything I would go out of my way for."
Khisha A.,"Cincinnati, OH",33,8,,5.0,7/18/2012,"This place is AMAZING!  I worked there for a year and eat there all the time still.  That speaks high volume.  Sometimes, you work at a place and can't eat there when you are there. They make just about everything from scratch.  They pay attention to detail like crazy.  Every job there, you must take a written test.... from the bartender to the busser.  Management is amazing.   My favorite meals are: Chicken Jambalaya [over rice, extra sauce], Fried Macaroni Cheese Balls, Strawberry or Lemon Drop Martini, Cheesecake depends on my mood.  I have not had anything I didn't like there.   Two thumbs up."
Krystyna C.,"Cincinnati, OH",43,133,13,2.0,8/14/2012,"Let me start off this review by saying that the night my husband and I decided to go here for dinner, I was craving the BBQ Salmon dish. That's all I could think about and it's the only thing I wanted, so imagine how disappointed i was to find out that AFTER I had ordered my food, they were out of salmon. Seriously?! Completely out. And apparently had been out for three days. (Because telling me that when we sat down would have been too easy. Had we known they were out of salmon, there's no way I would have even ordered a glass of water.) The seating is ridiculous and I must say, if you're going to stick me at a table for ""two"" that is directly next to another table so that I feel like I am involved in their conversation, that's not a pleasant dining experience for me. That's more like torture.  The meal I ordered in substitution for my favorite meal being out of stock was the curry chicken and shrimp- recommended by our waiter. This thing was gross. It was grey in color and resembled cat vomit. I tried to eat the rice a handful of times and that was it for me- I couldn't finish this $15 plate of nasty. The wait times for this place are outrageous. 2 hours for a table for two?! Are you kidding me!? Save your money and hassle and go somewhere else. The only thing I can recommend is to get a slice of cheesecake to go and eat it at home where you don't have to listen to the empty nesters in the seat next to you crying because they moved their kid into college that morning. Nothing ruins a good meal faster than the buzz-kill at the table next to yours!"
Katie R.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,1,,1.0,2/20/2015,"What a horrible experience my family had last night. I pulled plastic out of my loaded tater tots, and received the worst service imaginable. The server was rude and the manager was even worse, not to mention they mocked my family as we were leaving. What a horribly unprofessional establishment. I will NEVER eat here again.."
Kennie G.,"Cincinnati, OH",30,177,20,3.0,12/28/2012,"If I could base this review solely on the merit of their cheesecake alone, this would be a five star review.  But alas, I must tell you of my whole experience. I have had slices of cheesecake and even a light bite from the appetizer menu to-go, but on this occassion I dined in with some friends.  We could not make a reservation because we called one minute--ONE MINUTE-- past the time they stopped taking reservations (I didn't even know they had a cut-off time for reservations).  We wound up waiting for about 30 minutes because one of my friends arrived early and got the wait started. The food was okay.  I say okay because across the board it was inconsistent.  We ordered a couple of appetizers to share with the table and one order of stuffed mushrooms was piping hot and the other was lukewarm.  The entree I ordered was okay, but there was definitely no seasoning, which was disappointing. I would like to return to The Cheesecake Factory because their menu reads like a novella so I could try something else with hopes for improvement, but in the meantime I'll just stick to take-out cheesecake slices."
Namrata A.,"New York, NY",103,706,24,3.0,1/16/2011,"When you dine, you rate the whole experience, and let's be 100% honest here, this place is different.  Cheesecake factory is a chain, its loud, its obnoxious, and its super crowded.  If that isn't enough of a determent (like it wasn't for me), then you're in for a good treat.  You've got this enormous menu with so many choices that you end up wanting a little bit of everything.  Everything is also hugely large here too.  Talk about trying to make Americans even more fatter - this is your joint here.   My significant other was clearly not pleased to go here since there are a wide variety of choices in Cincinnati, however, I was happy.  The wait was 1 hour and 30 mins on a Saturday night (typical), but you get to walk around that super cheesy Kenwood mall, or whatever its called. We had the fried mac and cheese - so good, seriously.  The avocado egg rolls were delicious too, but it would be nice to dip it into a spicy chipotle sauce other than some sweet Indian chutney.  He had the penne with four cheese which was basic, chicken was rubbery though.  I had to be a bit good and had the small caesar salad which was not small by any means.  The pineapple mojito was too sweet, so was the regular mojito, but the margarita was on point.  We got a cheesecake to go that seems to be the thing here too. Anyway, good food overall, not a ""real"" experience for a restaurant because its intimate or cozy, obviously pricey since you get the LARGE portions in everything.... but honestly, go on a second/third date here, and you'll be forced to talk more to the girl/guy since you're waiting a while - that means some true bonding.   Oh and the service!  Lady was nice, courteous, but took forever to get us the check and get a move on it, but I'll cut her a break, it is the crowded place in that particular mall.  Tis ok."
Emily B.,"Pheasant Hills, Loveland, OH",11,26,43,4.0,9/11/2014,"Took my son & daughter here to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday. We like the variety of the menu. Lots of choices. I was very pleased to see that they have a lite menu. I had the lite steak medallions. Cooked perfectly & just the right portion size. My daughter's fettuccine Alfredo w/chicken was very nice. My son's meal was a real struggle however. He ordered a shrimp dish that was mostly chicken! His sides took forever to be served & when they finally arrived, one was the wrong item. It was like a whole ordeal just trying to get what he ordered! Even with the confusion, the food was good & meal was very enjoyable. We ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake to-go. It was crazy-good !! Our waitress was very nice & apologetic for the minor mishaps. I think they were just super-busy. Overall, we totally enjoyed our dinner & I'm sure we'll be back."
Jeni S.,"Cincinnati, OH",23,25,7,2.0,6/21/2012,"I have been to the Kenwood Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count. If I am ever at the mall with my mom and sister, The Cheesecake Factory has always been the spot we stop for lunch or dinner. Mostly, we go here because it is convenient and has a lot of menu items. Since we all have different tastes, this place is a good compromise since everyone will find something on their massive menu that they like.  I have to say though, after my recent visit, I will never go back. Our server was nowhere to be found our entire meal. She took our drink order and didn't come back until she gave us our check. Anything we needed (refills of water, salt and pepper, napkins- you know- basics), we had to grab a server at another table or someone passing our table running food to another.  I have experienced its progressive decline over the past year or so. Each time, it gets a little bit worse. The food quality has gone steadily downhill, the service is terrible anymore and the prices seem to be going up. I am not sure whether they actually are, or it's that the terrible service and mediocre food simply highlight the fact that you're paying a whole lot of $$ that could be much better spent elsewhere."
Zumba Aaron L.,"Independence, KY",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2013,"I left this feedback on the company's website, and through their facebook page and after following up on facebook I finally received a call from their guest relations director, however, I called her back and heard nothing since and it's been more than a  month. I am convinced that at least this location has no regard for their customer's experience but I am going to share the experience with anyone else who might be considering dining at this location. If they would have taken the time to discuss and address the situation I would have considered keeping this to myself but I feel it necessary to share. Below is a verbatim of my unaddressed experience that I've shared with CF via Facebook and their website:  Yesterday's experience in your restaurant bordered between extremely disappointing and unacceptable. I and 7 colleagues were in your restaurant for a celebration of a successful event and the entire evening was less than satisfactory, let alone celebratory. It began shortly after we were seated when our waitress (I believe her name was Kristen) spilled an entire tray of ice water down my back, onto my seat which held my coat and a recently purchased Michael Kors handbag, and a shopping bag from Sephora. Understandably - accidents happen. However, the lack of response to the incident by management and the servers only remedy being to hang up my jacket (which was still wet when we left 1.5 hours later and I ventured into 43 degree weather) was unacceptable. No one from the management team stopped by our table to check on us or see if any resolution was needed, or to offer even a slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience, instead, I had to endure the rest of the meal in a soggy shirt and pants with damp hair and attempt to dry my handbag off in the restroom. Our server did ask if I was drying off about 12 minutes after the incident and said ""If it makes you feel better, I got wet, too."" Unnecessary comment and it did not help me feel better. To add insult to the situation our servers demeanor was curt the entire evening. When I asked for my mojito for the 3rd time...about 18 minutes after I ordered it and 5 minutes after everyone else's drinks came from the bar she cut me off stating ""I'm making it, I'm going to make it right now."" Someone in our party asked her how her day was and she replied that she was having the worst day she'd had in a year. EVERYONE is entitled to have an off day/evening/week/month, however, in the service industry I expect more of a poker face if you expect customers to reward your service in the form of gratuity. On a more positive note the food did arrive as ordered, albeit at this point my appetite was minimal. I hope that this feedback is used to improve the service in your Kenwood location for future customers.   I look forward to your response."
