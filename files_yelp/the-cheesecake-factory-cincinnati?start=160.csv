Don D.,"Covington, KY",8,25,6,3.0,1/8/2013,"Super long wait, As always, but the service otherwise good, and the food was timed well. My wife requested a side salad, that they could have offered to bring out first, but  not a huge deal. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and was very satisfied. There are a lot negatives about the Cheesecake Factory Franchise, from an overly large menu to ridiculous wait times and even over-sized portions. This review would be higher, if not for the wait, and more specifically the inaccurate estimates given. Whatever they tell you when you walk in the door, add 50% to it. We were told 30 minutes, which was not bad this visit, but the total time was over 45 minutes. The previous visit, at a different location so I am not basing this review on it, we were told 45 minutes, and it ended up being 90 minutes. That said, the food was good, and timed appropriately. I would eat here again, I'd just make sure I was there before I get hungry."
Melissa M.,"Lexington, KY",167,169,37,5.0,6/22/2012,"The first time I ever went to a Cheesecake Factory, I almost peed my pants I was so excited. The mere idea that a place exists with 20 kinds of cheesecake thrilled me beyond measure. When I found out they were building one in Cincinnati, I googled its opening for months. Today, we stopped by for lunch. We were seated in less than 5 minutes. It takes me a long time to choose from the menu because there are so many items from which to choose . This place really appeals to the hedonist in me. I also love the decor. I always feel like I'm enveloped in some kind of amber marshmallow cloud. We decided to choose from the lunch options because the other options are always huge.  The lunch options are also gigantic. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and salad (lunch portion). I could have fed an entire family with it. It was the best BBQ chicken pizza. The sauce was sweet and delicious with the red onions. The cheese was melty and wonderful. My fiance had the Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I tried it. It was very tasty - and enough to feed about 5 people. So, we had to get boxes. For dessert, we shared Adam's Peanut Butter Ripple Cheesecake. It has huge chunks of Butterfingers in it, peanut butter drizzled in the cheesecake and a chocolate crust. I think my fiance was a little upset watching me with the cheesecake as I seemed to be having some type of illicit affair with it.  It may be a chain but mmmm....heaven."
Stephen G.,"Cincinnati, OH",22,128,,2.0,3/22/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants where the phrase ""Your Mileage May Vary"" (YMMV) was made for. Every half-good experience we have ever had there has been tempered by the very next visit where we have often vowed to never darken their proverbial doorstep again. I think the reason we DO go back is that TCF at the Kenwood Town Center is - apart from the tacky ill-designed food court - pretty much the 'only game in town', its prime location at the main entrance to the mall guaranteeing it eyeballs and footfalls. The food isn't the problem. Sorry, I'll rephrase that... the food is rarely the problem. The menu is massive - the kitchen's cooks must hate its size and choice - and you can often get through one entire drink deciding what entree to opt for. (Is this the perfect sales ploy I wonder?). Almost everything that comes out is averagely average and inoffensively bland, but the restaurant always scores for the size of its portion. HUGE! When perusing the menu always try and bear in mind that your leftovers and subsequent doggy bag will feed you - for at least - one day extra. It's often like 2 or 3 meals for the (high) price of one! Once in a while however, something comes to your table that both looks and tastes awful... like the Teriyaki Chicken I tried there last year which had the look of something that had been kicked around on the floor before being plated. To be fair - food wise -  that was a bit of an anomaly. However, The Cheesecake Factory's main turnoff - for us is most definitely the service. I don't mean the people at the front desk who are trying to accommodate everyone who walks in expecting and/or demanding an immediate table for 4, but the servers. This, my friends, is where everything that could be good about the place gets ruined in one foul swoop. Don't get me wrong, we have had good service there. More often than not though we've been forced to encounter whatever the word is for 'indifference meets attitude'. On our most recent visit you could almost see the glow of boredom around the girl who phonily claimed she would ""be looking after us"". I respect that this is something of a ""first world problem"" but it then took an age for her to get waters to our table and our subsequent request for straws to drink them with was met with an almost audible *sigh*. I also have issues with servers who are initially keen to ask you what you would like then point blank refuse to listen to your response because, presumably, their heads are off on some cloud somewhere. My wife had to repeat her choice twice whilst I had to chime in three times before she comprehended mine. When the food eventually came she did wander over to ensure everything was okay. My wife asked for her water to be refilled and off the girl went for the jug. She came back, filled my wife's glass... totally missing the fact that, by this time, mine was also empty. My wife and I just looked at one another and laughed... laughter which became a little sour when we didn't see the server again for the rest of the meal. Oh sure she came to the table next to ours to deliver a check and pick up the payment but she never, ever returned to us again until such time as she was due to get paid. This, sadly, was not a rare experience. We have sat in all areas of the vast indoor space the Cheesecake Factory takes up and I would say that 8 times out of 10 we have received the same level of disappointing service, almost as if the staff there are trained in 'the art of surly'. Maybe that's why the portions are so big so as to take your mind off the service? Personally I think I'd prefer smaller portions, lower prices and a guarantee of some quality manners and attention from the staff. Now, on this most recent visit we didn't visit the bathrooms. There is very good reason for this. Maybe they have fixed the problem but on every visit in the past three or four years the bathrooms - and the corridor that leads to them - has permeated an off-putting odor. Not necessarily of lingering wee or poo but most definitely something with a 'sewerish aroma'. We commented on this once to a member of staff who could hardly wait to walk away from us after mumbling ""it's like that most of the time"" in our general direction. Now, before I tar the whole Cheesecake Factory chain with the same critical brush let me just say that our 'problems' have been limited exclusively to the Kenwood location. On our frequent visits to Chicago we have thoroughly enjoyed - and indeed, raved about - their location at the base of the Hancock Tower. We've never received anything but exemplary service there and can't make any complaints at all. Kenwood, by comparison, is the merest shadowiest shadow in Chicago's wake."
Cathy S.,"Kenwood, Cincinnati, OH",6,47,20,1.0,2/21/2014,"Don't even bother going to this location.  I love Cheesecake Factory!  However, this location is poorly managed!  They always make you wait even when you can see available tables.  The 3 times I've been there, the wait has been over an hour and I counted a minimum of 12 unoccupied tables.  The people at the front never smile to welcome you.  They all just look really young and overwhelmed.  The wait staff is sad.  They all seem to have huge egos, are not friendly, and good luck getting refills on drinks.  The food there is great!  The service and the people who work there are why I gave such a poor rating."
Sherri B.,"Little Rock, AR",18,17,52,4.0,11/23/2013,"We had Thai chicken lettuce wraps and an Asian Chicken Salad. There was enough food to share. I was glad that they had options that were delicious but not so heavy. I enjoyed the different sauces that came with the wraps. Asian Chicken Salad is one of my favorite salads from the Cheese Cake Factory. The salad at this location was not as good or pleasing to the eye as the one I had in Florida. For dessert we had strawberry shortcake, strawberry cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake. I tasted each of the cheesecakes, they were both good with a smooth texture. The strawberry shortcake was my dessert selection, the combination of the ice cream, cake and whipped topping was a nice blend. The cake actually reminded me of a scone or a biscuit. The decor is beautiful and I liked that the restaurant was ajoined to the mall i.e. after dinner we able to go shopping."
Kimberly J.,"Charleston, SC",1,60,,3.0,8/7/2014,"Decor is pretty.  Wait is a bit much and there is not enough seating available for disabled who are waiting.  Service was great, and food was hot and tasted great. For two burgers, fries, and two slices of cheesecake with drinks our total bill ww about $40."
Michael H.,"Cincinnati, OH",395,96,6,4.0,10/6/2011,"Well I FINALLY broke down and took the Mrs. to the Cheesecake Factory. It was actually a bit of a celebration for us -- DATE NIGHT WITH NO BABIES!! Grandma came and gave us a few, desperately needed hours of time to try and recall what it was like to actually have a relationship... sans two toddlers. So we land in Kenwood at the mall... ugh... we've been assimilated into upper middle class suburbanite status, desperately clinging to some shred of our former selves. The wait wasn't really all that bad for a Saturday dinner rush at the mall... under an hour, and they were true to their estimates. The server was great... she handled things like a charm, although she admitted that she was fairly new and hadn't fully assimilated the gargantuan menu. That's the thing about the Cheesecake Factory... even in a down economy it seems that they're trying to push the whole ""everything is big"" excess thing. Hey, their kitchen logistics aren't my issue... the only concern with a menu that large is what do they truly excel at making vs. what's on there to try and satisfy the masses while being ""excessive"". We ordered a couple of appetizers... a tempura ahi tuna roll and some crab bites (which were mini crab cakes). Both were pretty tasty. The wife went for a $10 mojito and I landed on a tall Stella Artois (since I'm one of those trendy Stella fans and they have it on draft.. no yucky Blue Moon orange juice flavored beer for me... you freaks). I had the shrimp scampi, which ended up being excellent... I was pleasantly surprised... angel hair was perfect (al dente angel hair is a delicate balance of time and attention). Very large shrimp and roasted garlic cloves... mmm... perfect balance. I was pleasantly surprised at the effort for a chain restaurant. It was extremely well prepared and presented. The Mrs. ended up with some chicken thing that she liked pretty well too. I tasted a bite and it was really good.  So now it's time for cheesecake... mmmm.... cheesecake and beer... The moment my wife saw they had turtle cheesecake, the decision-making process was done for her. I opted for something a little more basic - the plain with strawberries. Now this is where I have to be perfectly honest - I am not only a food snob, but in particular, I'm a cheesecake snob. In no way, shape, or form can I call Cheesecake Factory cheesecake ""the best evarrrrr"". Don't get me wrong, it's good. Pretty good even. However, I cannot and will not say that it's spectacular.  That's because my family has a secret cheesecake recipe that has been handed down for generations, which torches the living hell out of every other cheesecake I've ever tasted. So much so, that at one point there was serious discussion about commercializing the effort - especially after some high flutin' boys from New England got ahold of one and raved about how it was better  than any cheesecake they've ever eaten in NYC... and I agree with them. It is. However, that's all besides the point. Most people wouldn't ever know the difference, and to that end, the Cheesecake Factory will be a pinnacle of cheesecake glory for them. I would never want to take that away on the basis that some other vastly superior cheesecake exists out there - because they will most likely never eat it. So if Cheesecake Factory can get what they do pricewise for their product, I wonder how much I could get for our secret cheesecake nirvana.... naah... It's mine... all mine.... Ok... so in summation... Cheesecake Factory, gets decent marks for a chain place. I'd hit it again."
Elizabeth O.,"Tampa, FL",104,24,3,3.0,8/29/2012,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times, mostly because I've been in the mall and wanted to eat at a sit-down restaurant. The menu is overwhelming, so let me just help you out here. Get the lettuce wraps. Everything else is a fine, but mostly uninteresting. The lettuce wraps are very good, and also very large. Get the lettuce wraps and share it with someone for two reasons:  1. There is no way that you will be able to eat all of anything on the menu. The portions are more than generous, they are ridiculous.  2. Nothing is cheap. However, if you take the price of the lettuce wraps and divide by two, you are getting somewhere. Service is hit or miss. Good luck. Now it's time for dessert, and this is important. Pay your server, leave the restaurant, and go to Maggiano's next door for cheesecake. Cheesecake factory gets all their cheesecake frozen in a big truck every couple weeks. Maggiano's makes their cheesecake from scratch every morning and it's amazing. Now if your looking for snickers cheesecake with praline topping and caramel chocolate drizzle or whatever, sure, stay at the factory. That's what they do well. If you want a transcendent piece of cheesecake, Maggiano's has the best in Cincinnati."
Kristin C.,"Cincinnati, OH",88,30,2,5.0,8/18/2012,"I like The Cheesecake Factory. As far as large chain restaurants, it's by far my favorite.  The overall ambience of the place is just great. The dim lighting, the decor. I instantly feel relaxed. The servers are always really professional and friendly- they educate you on whatever menu changes there are and  offer great recommendations.  My favorite (non alcoholic) drink is definitely the raspberry lemonade. The rim of the glass is covered in sugar and it's just absolutely delicious. I order it every time I go.  One thing I really like about The Cheesecake Factory is the huge menu selection. There's literally something for everyone. Vegetarian, Asian, Italian... You name it, they've got it. They even have an entire ""Skinny"" menu for those who are watching what they eat.  The cheesecake... How could I not mention that? Unfortunately I'm so boring, my favorite is the plan old Original Low Carb cheesecake. The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake is amazing but I usually can't handle all of that.   It's not inexpensive, that's for sure. But, I believe you get what you pay for. The portion sizes are enormous, even the lunch portions. The service couldn't be better. Totally worth it."
Erica R.,"Stevensville, MI",4,17,1,5.0,11/9/2013,Wow! What a beautiful place to dine. The menu is a little lengthy. However not disappointed. I ordered the steak diane with shrimp scampi. Tasted amazing! And for dessert was a slice of turtle cheesecake! I was soooo stuffed by the end of the night. I really loved the atmosphere. The valet was OUTSTANDING! I would give valet a 5 star if i could! It was FASTEr than any valet i have ever used. The boy was on foot and ran for the vehicle!! Simply amazing!
Ella E.,"Cincinnati, OH",54,140,7,4.0,3/24/2014,"I know everybody thinks that this is a huge corporate chain. It is.  However, it makes for a perfect place when you or a large group cannot make up your mind on what type of food you like to have.  They have great portion sizes and a variety of food to choose from. It may not be the healthiest stuff but it offers a wide variety of food to choose from. Also, I really enjoy eating the bread that they offer on the table for free."
Alexandrea C.,"Maineville, OH",16,1,,4.0,11/30/2013,"Food was great. Must have the fried mac and cheese. Our server Nikki was wonderful, and made great suggestions. Will definitely wait for her section again!"
Autumn E.,"Cincinnati, OH",12,30,1,5.0,10/23/2011,"A few words for you: Fried Mac n Cheese.  Forget the cheesecake, I get the Fried Mac n Cheese every time I got to the Cheesecake Factory. Crispy on the outside, gooey, cheesy delicious on the inside. Nothing like it in the world, I swear it's not made by mere mortals, they have gods back there in the kitchen just to make this gooey delicacy.  And also the bread, oh my lord the bread served with real butter is to die for, warm and fresh, it has a well baked crisp shell on the outside, and soft supple perfect bread on the inside, perfect to rip into chunks and slather with butter to enjoy, which you will. Oh how you will enjoy it. Unless you don't eat bread, and if you don't, what is wrong with you?! They also have a nice attentive staff, who will serve you an interesting mix of entrees, salads and appetizers, of course delicious desserts, as well as drinks,  but for me its all about the Fried Mac n Cheese."
Matt C.,"Cincinnati, OH",36,4,,1.0,11/20/2013,"Not a fan, first had to wait while there were visibly open tables.  Then after we were seated, almost on top of the people next to us, the service was slow. The food was mediocre. And afterwards we had our cheesecake to go and when arrived home it was not what we ordered, we will not be back."
Manu M.,"Cincinnati, OH",16,111,8,3.0,4/3/2012,"This restaurant is in a prime location in the Kenwood Mall. Another one of my co-workers favorites (I think it's because of the low-cal or veggie options).  I have been here twice already. I go here because my friends like it, I like their company, and I don't mind the food. Nothing to write home about, but okay.  They have a skinnylicious menu which is supposedly low calories and all that jazz. I like a little bit of flavor in my food. If it is the bland microwaved dish, you can keep it to yourself. First time I went here, I made the mistake of ordering the Pasta. It was a sacrilege to the memory of the Pasta Carbonara I had from Yayas, Denver. They had all the stuff there - white sauce, green peas, bacon... but none of the flavor.  Next time I went, I was mindful of my lesson and ordered Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp. I have had a good experience with this dish in another location. And bang! They delivered it with the correct flavor.   Service is a good thing here, they are mindful of you, are fast. But don't take any recommendations from them."
Patricia L.,"Morrow, OH",0,3,,2.0,4/7/2016,"This chain has gone downhill over time.  We first discovered this restaurant years ago when visiting California and loved it.  That is when they gave a huge piece of cheesecake and the food was better value for the money.  The food is generally good depending on what you get and the cheesecake/desserts are not as good as they used to be and portions are small for the price charged.  My biggest problem with this particular location is the service.  It used to be much better but our experience has been very negative the past couple of times here and the management, well, does not seem to have any.  The last time, we were over charged, it took a long time to get our food and check.  When we brought it to the management's attention, no apology is made and they do nothing to try to keep your business.  There are other places to go that offer better value for your money and better service.  We will not return to this restaurant, at least this location."
Amanda L.,"Churubusco, IN",0,3,,5.0,5/11/2015,My food was amazing. I had a salmon salad. I got a huge piece of salmon and the plate was very pretty when it came out. Leeanne was our sever and she was great!!! Would totally go again
Andy D.,"Cincinnati, OH",136,63,9,2.0,7/14/2012,"2 hour wait for poor service... I just got home from taking my daughter out for a ""date night"".  She likes looking at the Disney Store (review to follow) and other children themed places at Kenwood Towne Center, so I thought that going to Chessecake would be a good choice. The place is ALWAYS crowded, and I'm used to waiting to get in there, but tonight was even longer than usual...about a 2 hour wait.  I ordered the Wasabi-Crusted Ahi Tuna Steak with Black rice (my daughter ordered the Mac & Cheese). The first thing that was disappointing about the service was that my meal was served with brown rice, instead of the black that I ordered...Next, all of items on the plate (the tuna, rice and julienne vegetables) were EXTREMELY bland.  The wasabi crusting that was detailed on the menu was more like a bland mound of panko bread crumbs scooped on top of my unevenly cooked piece of fish.  For $30 and being one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, you'd think that a little more pride and attention to detail would go into preparing it.  I had to douse my entire plate with soy sauce (which I had to ask for) to get through my meal...it's such a shame because it really did look like a quality cut of fish. I really do like the decor, and I like that it is located in the Towne Center, but after this performance I don't see myself going back for a while....the cheesecake was terrific though! :)"
Meli S.,"Grafton, WI",11,90,,2.0,8/8/2011,"Every time I go to a Cheesecake factory the service is horrid and the food gets worse. I order the Bang Bang Chicken and shrimp during my last visit. The server warned me it was hot. She was so wrong! I love thai, I love hot food. This dish was so sweet I honestly couldn't eat it. We had a reservation at 630 and still weren't seated til 715. Our drinks were empty at least 15 minutes minutes at one point during dinner. So disappointing.  I used to love Cheesecake factory. So sad to see them deteriorate with their popularity."
Tina G.,"Cincinnati, OH",67,157,46,4.0,4/23/2012,"A frequented spot for me and my significant other to hang out, have a drink and feel the evening breeze while watching late shoppers at Kenwood Towne Center."
