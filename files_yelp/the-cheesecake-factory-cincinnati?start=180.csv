Nikki H.,"Austin, TX",4,20,10,4.0,5/21/2012,"We came to this restaurant with no clue what to expect. We had never gone to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before. We went in around 4pm, which was great because it was so empty around the bar area and had few people seated in the booths.  We had a great waiter. He was full of energy and got our orders correct. He refilled our drinks frequently...so frequently that we had to tell him we didn't need one at the moment a couple of times. We ordered the nachos appetizer, Shepherd's pie, salmon/mashed potatoes, The Club sandwich and Baja chicken tacos. They all looked great and the portions were huge. I can't say how the other meals tasted like but the Baja tacos were flavorful, spicy, and perfectly accented with cilantro. We ended up bringing most of our food and the cheesecakes home. I had the low carb cheesecake with fresh strawberries on top, it was excellent.  The only con about the whole experience was the fact that the windows where we sat by were right next to the entrance to Kenwood Mall so it was a bit distracting with people walking by or sitting right under our window in benches.  Word of advice: be prepared to come in very hungry or bring home food since the portions are huge and this isn't a budget-friendly place to eat at."
Erin H.,"Mason, OH",1,25,11,2.0,9/14/2013,"Ambience was great, service and food were not.  The fries in the fish and chips tasted frozen, the hand made onion rings also tasted burnt and had no flavor, and the pizza was just ok. We just thought everything had no taste and if it did it was burnt. The server never asked us how the food was and he was so busy because we went on a Saturday night that we never had the opportunity to talk to him. For the price, it's just not worth it. We will take our business elsewhere in the future."
Rasha A.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,13,3,4.0,5/15/2014,"Went for Mother's Day, I want to say that they have Good food: I got Evelyn's favorite pasta and it was good, my mother got moccrocan chicken cuscus it was pretty tasty, my sister got orange chicken with brown rice; I personally didn't like the rice it had no salt but the orange chicken was just awesome. Then my brother got an original hamburger.  It wasn't bad. We then got Chris outrageous cheesecake it was okay I wouldn't recommend it just because there wasn't enough cheese flavor to it. The service started out awkward until halfway through it became a little more comfortable and cool. I would recommend for a gathering."
Katherine M.,"Boca Raton, FL",162,566,246,3.0,8/29/2011,"It's a Cheesecake Factory - so it's pretty normal. It's always crowded. The food is always the same. It's consistent. The food is just okay- I don't love anything here and never come here with anything in mind. It's good for salads and stuff. We ALWAYS get gift certificates here, so we end up coming after holidays and our birthday because we usually have 50+ dollars to spend. So the main thing to try here is their strawberry or raspberry lemonade topped with whipped cream. They may look at you kinda funky when you ask for whipped cream on top - but trust me - DO IT! Mix the whipped cream into the lemonade, and you will be in awe at how amazing it is. Apparently, the first Cheesecake Factory my husband went to did this and he's been convincing our friends to do it here since. It is delicious.  The cheesecake is good - it's what they are known for obviously. Sometimes it can get a bit rich - I can never finish a whole slice without getting full. I feel like most people have been here. If you come at dinner time or lunch time - expect a long wait."
Toree C.,"Aurora, IN",23,144,36,5.0,8/9/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! I can't think of a single negative experience. The service is always on point and even when it's a little slow, it's not a bad place to wait. The interior is beautiful and always very clean. The menu is extensive, so if you have a large group, everyone will be pleased. One turn there I ordered the Ahi Tuna and my husband had Shepard's Pie, just to give an example. Of course there is an incredible list of cheesecakes. The only warning is the issue of parking. Kenwood Mall is nightmare on any weekend, and I have been there when not a spot is open. So word to the wise, go early or on a weeknight."
Bre N.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,8,,4.0,4/26/2015,There's ALWAYS a wait to eat at this place. I have been countless times. The food is always good and fresh. I have never had a complaint about their food. Food is delicious. Cheesecake is amazing. Large menu. I think the lighting in this place is very dim though. The dim lighting is kind of depressing. Don't show up too hungry because u may have to wait an hour or more to be seated.
Laura G.,"Cincinnati, OH",58,138,4,4.0,1/29/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the giant cornerstones of Kenwood Mall, so expect long waits, big crowds and lots of noise. Well, expect these things if you go on a Friday or Saturday evening. On a random Wednesday I walked right in with one of my girlfriends and we had a downright delightful dinner.  The service is fantastic. And by fantastic I mean these people work hard for their money and you can tell they are trained well. Our server was super friendly, knowledgeable and timely. Other servers dropped by our table to bring by food and refill drinks, we were really surprised by how consistent they all were. We also noticed they were all male and around the same age, maybe 23-30. They even kind of looked alike. Cheesecake Factory are you cloning your servers? The service is great so keep it coming.  I've had things I've liked and disliked here. I was trying to eat light so I went with the fresh spring rolls and a mini-salad. The spring rolls have always been really fresh and I love the sauces they're served with. The salad was okay, it just didn't compare to the massive pile of greens that my girlfriend ordered. Anything would pale in comparison to her salad.  Needless to say, we didn't have any cheesecake but the diet coke was flowing like wine. I can safely say everyone can find something they like here, but please stay far, far away on the weekend. You'll thank me later."
Mike M.,"Burlington, KY",15,19,6,1.0,7/20/2014,"My wife and I decided to meet after work at a central location and Cheesecake Factory was the choice. It was Friday at 5:30, and the staff tried to seat us in an odd area, a little too close to another family, which felt like an invasion if their personal space. We moved ourselves to a better location since the staff seemed oblivious. My wife ordered the fried catfish and noticed it seemed very ""fatty"".  It seemed sort of undercooked (though nearly burned on the outside).  She ate most of one piece before giving up. At midnight that night, she got violently ill and spent the weekend vomiting and various other acts I won't mention. She has sworn off Cheesecake Factory forever (we'll see), but at the very least will always be very leery of improperly cooked food. She should have followed her instincts and sent it back. The staff seemed a little lost in general, like they were overwhelmed. We will not be back. There are far too many choices in the area for us to take the chance."
Kassidy L.,"Cincinnati, OH",27,11,17,5.0,2/24/2013,I come here on Sunday for the pancakes and syrup!!!!! I wish they served brunch on Saturday as well...
Trisha K.,"West Chester Township, OH",53,173,53,4.0,4/27/2011,"Cheesecake Factory has a HUGE menu, but as I've said, if there's a Cuban Sandwich on the menu, I MUST order it!  Cheesecake has a YUMMY Cuban Sandwich that will surely satisfy! Additionally, they have a good brunch menu.  It's nice to enjoy their  outdoor patio during the summer mornings before it gets too hot.  Then you can walk it off by shopping in the mall! Uh, I guess I should mention the obvious...yes the cheesecakes are awesome!"
Ning X.,"Noord, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",15,7,,3.0,2/9/2013,"It was a real fancy place to me, looked like Italian style, dressed up staff. We only had cheesecakes and drinks do didn't try the food there. Milkshake was good."
Keith W.,"Nicholasville, KY",35,68,20,4.0,8/21/2013,"Huge portions.  Almost always need a to-go box.  I've never had a bad meal there, and the cheesecake is always incredible.  I wish they would not put some of the tables so close together, though."
Jason B.,"Champaign, IL",82,157,5,4.0,8/13/2010,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory?  It's big.  It's loud.  It's obnoxious.  And it has great food.  This particular Cheesecake Factory, located right off I-71 on exit 12, is one of the premier restaurants of the Kenwood Shopping Center, and it deserves the reputation. When you arrive, finding a parking spot is quite easy.  You can park in the lot, the parking garage, or take advantage of the valet service offered by Kenwood.  If you decide just to drop in, the wait can be quite atrocious.  Anywhere from thirty minutes to over an hour.  So if you plan on going, I would recommend calling ahead and making a reservation.  And if you just so happen to be shopping in the mall, and decide on the spur of the moment to go, don't be surprised by the wait time, especially if you end up going during either the lunch or dinner rush. While you wait, you have the opportunity to gawk at a display of the various cheesecakes that have been made fresh that day.  It's enough to make your mouth water on the spot.  You can also wait over at the bar, which has everything imaginable.  They'll make you whatever you want. From what I understand, the bartenders will even make you something that isn't on the menu if you tell them what it is and how to mix it.  And if you really are not a fan of waiting, you can always just dine at the bar. If you choose not to wait outside, or at the bar, or in the mall, you can always wait right inside and admire the interior.  Although I have to admit I've never truly understood the décor of the Cheesecake Factory.  It always reminds of the Middle East, and cheesecake and the Mid East are just two things I would not connect with one another. When getting to your seat (and the seats are always a bit comfy) you are given a copy of the menu by a member of the staff.  Wow, this menu is big.  With over 200 choices to pick, it is sometimes difficult to determine what it is you happen to be in the mood for.  I have not tried the entire menu, but what I have sampled thus far has been all good. It is usually very difficult for a restaurant to pull off such a large menu and stay in business.  But the quality of the food makes it viable and doable.  The food is phenomenal.  The wait is usually a pain in the butt, but it is quickly forgotten once you see the size of your dish (insanely huge) and take your first bite. Everything I've eaten here has been delicious.  That includes the appetizers, main dish, and the desert...cheesecake. The cheesecake is always phenomenal.  There are a variety of different flavors to choose from.  I'm more of a traditional type of guy, so I usually go with the good-old fashioned type of cheesecake.  But that usually doesn't stop me from taking bites off the cheesecake of whoever happens to be with me. The only real negatives are the wait for a table, the wait to get your food, and the fact that it can be crazy busy, not only during lunch and dinner, but sometimes just throughout the day.  Oh, and the prices are a bit high (can't really blame them given how good the food is and the fact that the portions are purposely created large so they can be brought home).  A great place to come with friends, or take your significant other out on a date, or just go with the family. Mahalo, and enjoy."
Tara S.,"Cincinnati, OH",7,187,2,3.0,5/23/2013,"I can't even believe I am writing this because for so many years, I have refused to eat here.  With their massive portions and through-the-roof calorie counts, I figured it best to just avoid the place altogether for fear that my belts wouldn't fit the next day.  However, I visited here recently on a work lunch and discovered that they have a HUGE ""skinnylicious"" menu!  Calorie counts listed, fresh ingredients, and yummy.  I now have cravings for these shrimp summer rolls and various tacos.  Now, it's on my list of nearby lunch spots.  Just dont' follow up your skinnylicious items with the cheesecake and you can get out of there without having a heart attack on the way to the car!"
Joe B.,"Cincinnati, OH",7,54,10,5.0,8/24/2011,Fish and chips freaky good..comes with a great coleslaw.. And I don't usually eat coleslaw.....its that good. Hibachi steak is the best though.
Cincinnati B.,"Cincinnati, OH",21,36,22,2.0,2/27/2011,"I wouldn't say I completely dislike Cheesecake Factory, but it is definitely an over-hyped and over-priced chain. The current (no doubt fleeting) public fascination with the place reminds me of how popular Chi-Chi's was in the 80's (I do have fond childhood memories of those nachos...) Cheesecake Factory's menu is so bloated that it comes spiral-bound. What does it say about a restaurant whose menu is as large as a bible? ""Yes, I would like to order the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Psalm 22, Verse 26, please.""  Hallelujah, amen. The food is generally hit or miss, undeserving of the higher price point and excessively long waits. And what of the cheesecake? It tastes like any other good cheesecake you've ever had, nothing more, nothing less."
Amanda M.,"Alexandria, VA",166,200,902,4.0,5/16/2012,"I'm giving this Cheesecake Factory 4 stars - 3 stars for the food but 5 stars for our server Mason. A group of 7 of us stopped in here for a late lunch on Saturday (5/5). We only had to wait about 10 minutes and then we were escorted to a large round booth. Between the 7 of us, 4 were running the Flying Pig Marathon the next day and 3 were running the Half Marathon so we needed to carb load. As with all CFs I have eaten at, the food is a solid 3 star, nothing spectacular (I don't think it is possible to have outstanding food with a menu as large as CF's) but nothing bad either. This location gets 4 stars because we truly had 5 star service from Mason.  I'm not kidding when I say that between 7 of us we ordered water 4 different ways - water with ice and lemon, water without ice or lemon, water without ice but with lemon and water with ice but no lemon - poor guy, I wouldn't have blamed him if he had run away. We demolished the bread baskets and when we asked for more of the brown bread (which also deserves 5 stars) Mason brought us three baskets full (and we ate it all). One of the main dishes was not done when the other six were served, Mason apologized profusely and his manager came over and did the same. The seventh main came out within 5 minutes and we all dug in. When it came time to settle the check, Mason asked how we wanted to split it. We asked if we could split it seven ways. Mason responded with a smile and said ""sure, that will be easy."" We all reacted with shocked expressions and told him that that was the first time we have ever had a server respond that way. Mason explained that since our orders were put in by table and seat number, he could just print off the check for each seat number.    For me personally the serving sizes at CF are way too big, I ate until I was stuffed and still left with a takeout box full of enough pasta for an entire meal. In fact 4 of us took half of our meals home. Since we were staying in a motel we asked for plastic forks. In addition to the silverware, Mason also brought each of us some more brown bread wrapped in foil. Maybe it is because all of us are used to the attitudes that pass for customer service in the DMV area, but we were all so thrilled with the service we received from Mason that we asked to speak with his manager. We all complimented him profusely and his manager explained that Mason had just recently started picking up shifts on the floor (he normally works behind the counter in the bakery). So, if you are in Cincinnati and find yourself at this CF location, request Mason as your server, you won't be disappointed."
Toni O.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,4,,1.0,1/9/2015,"Blatant, obvious, and poor hostess service. What's going on when a hostess tells you at 3:15pm on a Friday that you will have to wait until 4:00pm to sit in an area other than near dirty dishes because they are short on servers; although the establishment  is practically empty and you only have 3 in your party?"
Stephanie S.,"Cincinnati, OH",80,58,1,2.0,3/9/2011,"This is a very typical, girlie thing to say.. but I freaking love cheesecake. It is the only reason why this place gets two stars. If it didn't have 30 varieties of these gigantic, rich desserts they would definitely only get one star.  If you go on a weekend, you'll wait at least 20 minutes just to see a hostess to ask her for a fork so you can stab your eye out. I don't mind waiting in a restaurant if it serves good food. In this place, you wait for an hour and and the food is nothing but 4 portions of processed mess. It's almost criminal how much food they give you. If you look on every 'eat this, not that' list, Cheesecake Factory is on it due to their 1,800 calorie meals. I've had sandwiches, pasta, appetizers from there and none of it I really even remember. I do remember the good cheesecake, the strong (if very expensive) drinks, and the very friendly bartenders. If you get a gift card for Christmas, I say get a slice of cheesecake to go. Otherwise, don't bother."
Cliff L.,"Kenwood, Cincinnati, OH",0,1,,2.0,8/3/2012,Mine and my wifes food was fine. The Mac and cheese that we got for my daughter was awful. The manager was nice enough to take it off the bill. And the air conditioner was broken and was very hot in the restaurant.
