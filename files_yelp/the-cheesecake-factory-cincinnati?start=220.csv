Mike D.,"Philadelphia, PA",145,151,94,3.0,4/20/2009,"Burger: 4 I ordered my burger medium but it came medium well. It was also really crumbly, i think it might have something to do with low fat content in kobe beef? Despite these 2 glaring errors, the meat was extremely delicious. Like so good, this actually tasted like a 12 dollar burger. Bun: 5 butter grilled brioche bun with sesame seeds. the perfect hamburger bun. Toppings: 4 blue cheese, grilled onions, and mushrooms. the mellow onions perfectly balanced the savory blue cheese and salty mushrooms Accoutrements: 2 $3 for a coke, the fries were below average. For some reason places like this always blow it on the fries. Free bread, which is always nice, but also always ruins you being able to finish the food you paid for. As they say ""THAT'S HOW THEY GET YA!"" Atmosphere: 2 I mean, it's the cheesecake factory. on a sunday at noon. crying babies, semi-pushy waitstaff. uppity white people. uncomfortable small booths and weird egyptian motifs everywhere Overall: 3.6 The Cheesecake Factory will forever be a guilty pleasure, but I had a gift card and was having a day with the old lady so I thought to myself, why not? I'm not gonna pretend like I'm too good for some food at the 'cake. I really wasn't feeling anything else on their ridiculous menu and the bun was the deal-sealer since I'm white and I like fancy bread. I've never tried a kobe burger before (the reason being, why shred up a great piece of meat just to cover it in all kinds of toppings and shit) and I'm still not sure it was done the right way, especially since they way overcooked mine. I'm not the type to send something back, especially at a place like that because it will just come back with pubes on it or something. But damn it, all the other stuff aside, that was a great burger. Big, meaty(nh), flavorful, complex and delicious. I put lettuce and tomato and ketchup on it about halfway through and almost ruined the damn thing. That's the first time that's ever happened to me. If you have the means (or in my case, a sweet gift card), do yourself a favor and get one of these. As much as it pains me to say it, The Cheesecake Factory's Kobe Burger is top notch. Side note: I really like their Boston Salad, Southwestern Eggrolls, and of course the cheesecake is pretty good."
Oz S.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,22,4,3.0,7/5/2007,"It's hard to put The Cheesecake Factory into a category because it's menu is 18 pages long (without ads it'd be about 13 pages). There's a huge selection that anyone is bound to find something they like. The restaurant styling is nice, hard to describe exactly but the best I could come up with is middle eastern crossed with Vatican and some Italian mixed in. In any case I loved the style, beautiful wall and ceiling paintings in reverse vignettes, the lighting is a tad too soft but not ""dark"" by any means. The service was friendly, when I sent back my iced tea for another the manager made sure everything was ok. The food arrived timely, no long wait. The food itself I have mixed feelings about. It wasn't terrible, but I wasn't happy with my choices. I'd definitely go back, but I'd try something else. My Meal: I had an iced tea per usual, but it was ""mango"" flavored, which to me tasted like soap, so I sent it back and got ""green iced tea"" as a replacement, which was better and had a refreshing mint taste to it. To begin the meal I had a chopped salad with a somewhat spicy ranch dressing, the presentation was lovely and it tasted good. My entree was the Chicken Madeira, which comes covered in mushroom sauce (with lots of mushrooms), cheese, and asparagus, with mashed potatoes on the side. The chicken had a flavor that was almost like a sweet honey glaze and the cheese added almost fried taste. The mashed potatoes had black pepper in them which isn't mentioned on the menu. The whole thing tasted ok but I wasn't big on it. And finally for a desert I of course had to try a cheesecake. I went for the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake, this disappointed me as well. It tasted good, but there wasn't very much of a caramel flavor, there was no caramel sauce or glaze or anything, it came with two big piles of fake whip cream (may have been canned), and it had nuts sprinkled on the top (not mentioned on the menu either). I feel The Cheesecake Factory has potential to have great meals, but my selection wasn't it. I'd give it another shot."
Cathy R.,"Lexington, KY",100,482,459,4.0,6/10/2008,"I've only visited this classy, stylish restaurant located in Kenwood Towne Center for a cocktail between shopping and a movie.  As a huge cheesecake fan, I can't believe I didn't at least order dessert! The bartender was friendly and the Cosmopolitan was good, if a bit pricey!"
Roberta B.,"Modesto, CA",0,33,,3.0,4/15/2009,"The food is okay, but not as good as it used to be.  I don't know what it is... just not as visually appealing, and portions aren't as impressive as I am used to at CF.  The guacamole is fantastic, though, and it's worth going just for that.  The woman at the bar had no personality, but the servers have always been very nice.  Certainly, this CF is not one of the best, but it's still good."
Alex B.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,6,,4.0,8/4/2009,"I love eating here but it's good to go when times are slow so you don't have to wait as this place is popular but i found it to be less so at lunch. The portions here are large (which is why i love it) so feel free to take some home. I was incredibly satisfied with my most recent visit where i ordered a chicken bellagio special which was perfectly cooked and served over delicious creamy pasta.  Be sure to save some room for dessert and try a famous piece of cheesecake. i recommend the oreo mudslide, godiva chocolate or chocolate chip cookie dough. on the whole cheesecake factory is a very nice place to eat and the service and atmosphere which I find compliments the food well only add to the dining experience"
