Mark D.,"Greensboro, NC",65,157,157,4.0,4/30/2016,"Let me start off by saying I've really never been a fan of the food at Cheesecake Factory. The actual cheesecake is a different story lol, I love those! I use to go there and just get a piece to go. However, I never know they served brunch on Sunday's, which has different menu items. That reason brought me here to see how it was. We beat the rush on this Sunday, and were sat down as soon as we got there. Our server was great. She was very nice, stayed on top of everything and made sure we always had full refreshments.  For my meal, I went with the fried chicken and waffles benedict. It also came topped with poached eggs and a side of potatoes. It was great! I've never had poached eggs before this, but it tasted great mixed with everything on the plate. The maple butter syrup was so tasty. Waffle was light, and the chicken was superb. Of course we couldn't leave without getting of cheesecake! The choice was the salted caramel cheesecake. Wow, I couldn't put my fork down!  Like I said, Cheesecake Factory wasn't my place to go, but now I wouldn't mind making it a place to go for a good Sunday brunch meal."
Edward M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,10,,2.0,12/8/2017,"Went there often but today I felt like I should have stayed home.  Got there at 4:20 and took a table in the bar (first come-first served).  Our favorite table needed busing but we sat there waiting for it to be cleaned so that we could order a mojito (best there I've ever had).  After being ignored for 15 minutes we went to the bar and ordered our mojitos from the bartender.  Ten more minutes more being ignored we moved to a clean table (we could see the bus man socializing).  Finally a waiter came by and asked, ""Have you been waited on?"" to which we answered in the negative.  He then said he was sorry and added, "" I'll be right back.""  However he never appeared again.  Finally, after over a half hour a waitress presented herself and announced, ""I'm your server.  What can I get for you?""  We told her about our mojitos which she finally brought to us.  Then I ordered my favorite chicken Marsala with mushrooms.  When we were finally served, for the first time ever at this restaurant, the meal was not up to their standards in my opinion.  The bow-tie pasta had the consistency the pasta has when cooked and then allowed to sit and petrify.  The Marsala sauce was scant.  It seemed to me that they had a serious management issue.  I'll go back; I'll order a mojito and chicken Marsala but I'll expect better service and a better meal that hasn't sat in room air to petrify."
Dave B.,"Mason, OH",1,8,1,4.0,3/19/2016,Menu is gigantic and the food is generally pretty good.  We really come for the desserts which are Texas-sized and phenomenal. Just wish they had more tables - 80 minute wait.
Jessi C.,"Cincinnati, OH",385,560,794,3.0,2/5/2015,"I was here for dinner after a hard day of shopping, and it really hit the spot. We only had to wait for 15 minutes because we were here on a week night...I would never try to get a spot here on the weekend (I can't stand waiting!), but it's really conveniently located in the Kenwood Mall. For dinner, I got the skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich. This is off of their low calorie menu, which is really great. They have so many things on the low cal menu, and they don't even taste like you're missing anything! The chicken salad sandwich is my favorite...The bread is toasted and buttery, and super crunchy which I love. My salad on the side was super tasty as well. My fiance ordered the chicken and biscuits which was extremely delicious, but definitely not low calorie! The dish needed more gravy because it was a little dry, and his food came out somewhat luke warm. I feel like that happens a lot here because the people in the table next to us also got not very hot food. But his mashed potatoes were soooo good, I couldn't stop stealing them off of his plate (there go all the calories I saved...). I never seem to have room leftover for cheesecake because their portions are HUGE...Which is a shame because I love cheesecake! Maybe next time I'll just get an appetizer and get cheesecake for dessert. I like the decor, and the server was very attentive. It took us a little while to get our food, and it is crazy busy. We were sitting right next to the table over from us (like...a foot away), and this little girl kept bumping her chair into our table. A little too close for comfort! And it's very loud in the restaurant, so it's hard to have a conversation there. But the food is decent, and it's convenient so I'll probably be back."
Amanda H.,"Cincinnati, OH",98,166,477,5.0,6/13/2015,"There are few things in the world I love more than cheesecake. I'm all about eating local and avoiding chain restaurants, but Cheesecake factory is one that is just always on point for me. I've yet to have a bad meal or any issues there in like 10 meals. When its good, its good- and they are. I took my little lady there on Friday and she loved it. Besides the obvious cheesecake, their menu is HUGE! Almost overwhelming for me, but it made Lauren happy since they had edamame. I got two small plates. The dynamite shrimp and the macaroni balls. Both were great. The macaroni balls were super heavy though. Not meant to be for one person. I should have just ate one instead of all four! That shrimp though was amazing. Next time I'm just going to get two orders of that!  On past visits I've had the chicken bellagio and its great too. Then for the best part- THE CHEESECAKE! We went with our all time favorite flavor, red velvet. It was so big both of us couldn't finish one piece. But it was so delicious. Like I said, I hate to admit how much I love this chain restaurant, but I do! Theres always a little bit of a wait, but its worth it."
Claire B.,"Bishopton, United Kingdom",43,273,337,4.0,1/10/2016,"There is a lot to love about the Cheesecake Factory besides their extensive and delicious range of cheesecakes. Their food menu is enormous, with a LOT to choose from. The mistake many people make is to have an appetizer then a main - if you insist on doing so, make sure you are sharing plates, because those portions are HUGE. In the UK, we don't go in much for doggy bags but here it is pretty much what's going to happen, because you are bestowed with heaped plates of everything (not a complaint!). The corn tamale thing is my favourite appetizer, it's so tasty, but huge, so share it! Cookie dough cheesecake all the way.  The staff are usually attentive and polite, though last time I waited for so long for someone to take my order, I had to physically go and track down a waiter to come to our table. That was the only blip in an otherwise textbook visit.  Will definitely return. Soon, I hope!"
Rob M.,"Allen Park, MI",13,66,20,3.0,7/6/2016,Consistent is the key word.  Good but not great.  Service is good but not great.  Big menu.  Ahi Tuna was good but not great.  Decor is cool.  Great place for a group.  Team lunch here was a success.  I would come here if convenient.  They seem to like mall locations.  Not a destination but a good place to kill some time.  Been to the Chicago and Indy locations as well.  Very consistent across locations
tiger w.,"New York, NY",2,18,,3.0,8/22/2017,The food is great but the service and food always takes forever! The crab dip appetizer was really good. Tried going here twice and both times food took more then 30 mins to come out. Will be back only if we have a lot of time to kill.
Stephanie R.,"Florence, KY",0,5,,1.0,9/4/2017,"It was a horrible experience. After an hour wait we were told it would be another 10 minutes that turned into 25 minutes. First our appetizers came out cold. Our drinks were forgotten about. It took 1 hour and 10 minutes for dinner to come out. My husband's shrimp was over done but cold. The angel hair pasta was clumped together and also cold. They forgot to do my meal. I waited another 35 minutes but by the time it got there everyone else was done so I just took mine home. Horribly over priced and definitely not worth the time and energy. ER were so disappointed. My 3 year old granddaughter was a trooper. We called ahead and they said 45 minutes so we were willing to give it a try. Don't do it, don't go."
Elyse F.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,358,873,3.0,10/7/2014,"If I had only ordered the raspberry lemonade and cheesecake my review would have been 4 stars. Their raspberry lemonade is my favorite non alcoholic drink served at any restaurant. It does not come from a soda fountain, but is mixed at the bar. Just when it seems a bit too sour, I lick some of the sugar off the rim of the glass and I am happy again. The wild blueberry cheesecake was good. It could have used a few more blueberries (our server commented that we got a piece with a lot.) The consistency and flavor were nice.   Lucky for them that I didn't only order food or this would be a 1 or 2 star review.  The cooks use heavy cream to make the eggs light and fluffy. While a common practice, it seems they added too much.  I could taste the cream more that the eggs. Filling was a little light. Filling wasn't cooked very much making it seem like more than it was. Only one piece of avocado. As you can see in the picture, the potatoes were overdone. Some were hard like chips while others were hard on the outside with a bit of softness in the middle. The English muffin was of the standard grocery store verity.  My husband ordered the Kobe burger. While he ordered it medium, it was very well done. It was obvious they made his fries before the burger, as they were cold upon delivery. On a positive note, the fresh baked bread was indeed fresh. It was still steaming when it arrived at our table.  If we go back, it will only be for drinks and cheesecake. I was in no way impressed with the cooking ability of the kitchen staff."
Tr P.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",34,20,4,4.0,12/7/2015,"The food is almost always top notch.  The service is also almost always the example of excellence. Normally I enjoy the ambience here, however today the lighting was a bit dim for my liking and since it was the first time we were seated as soon as we walked in, it took longer than normal to order.  I saw others using their phone's flash lights to view the menu. My only real quip is that servers need to remember that the fragrance you wear shouldn't be offensive. Good smelling is a moot point if its overpowering."
Ashleigh J.,"Cincinnati, OH",15,82,12,5.0,2/6/2017,"I've been here several times before my Yelp days lol. It never disappoints. The atmosphere is very nice, food is amazing (delicious and large portions and huge variety), great service. Some may say it's on the pricey side but as I previously stated, the portions are big. The only complaint is have is the lighting...it's quite dim and could be a little bit brighter. Other than, I love the Cheesecake Factory. Oh...the cheesecake is sooooooooo good too! I try a different one each time I go."
Henry J.,"Olde West Chester, OH",150,253,96,4.0,8/26/2015,"This is an incredibly busy restaurant. Being the only Cheesecake Factory in the Cincinnati metro (until the one on Liberty Way opens, anyway), naturally people flock here to get their cheesecake on. The menu's large, and management apparently have been stung by years of health magazines gawking at the incredibly waistline-expanding calories contained in almost all of their entrees, it had come up with a new Skinnylicious menu composed of dishes that are similarly rich in taste at only 590 calories or less. We went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. The place was packed, per usual. Don't bother making reservations on Saturdays and Sundays. They don't take them. Instead, they'll only take reservations during the week. I guess they don't want to leave a table empty in case someone who reserved a table decided to not show up. Anyway, we were told that our wait would be about 30 to 40 minutes. We got our table in about 20. So that's cool. After we sat down, our server helped us to devise a virgin fuzzy peach drink for my wife, who was very pregnant at this time. Our entrees came very quickly. I had their Jamaican black pepper shrimp and my wife their sweet tamale cake. For dessert, she had their lemon raspberry cheesecake and I tiramisu. In short, the food was great and definitely hit the right spot. No, we didn't order off of the Skinnylicious menu. So why the 1 star off? Because of two things. One, the floor was extremely slippery. My wife, being pregnant as she was, found it difficult to get up and walk without constantly feeling like she's gonna fall. Second, while our server was fast and very attentive, it was also obvious that she's under pressure by management to keep the tables turning to seat new patrons. Our meal felt a bit rushed towards the end, but it's no big deal. We'd go back for special occasions."
Shonda W.,"Latonia, KY",26,15,,4.0,8/16/2017,"I've been to this location a handful of times and every time it's been amazing. The food was always good, the wait was never crazy, and the staff was nice. The only downfall is they won't let you put in for reservations or put your name on the list until your entire party is present."
Kimberly J.,"Lebanon, OH",414,438,2368,3.0,7/10/2014,"Cheesecake Factories are pretty uniform in my opinion. I find them overwhelming myself because their menu is huge! My preference is to grab a seat at the bar (since the restaurant is usually packed and the wait is FOREVER long) and grab a drink, app and of course CHEESECAKE.--I mean why else are you here?  There drinks and bartenders have always been amazing. Their prices (for food and drinks) are a bit expensive, but usually a nice treat. I've had many of the different cheesecake flavors and they have all been wonderful. My all time favorite has to be the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. Yum Yum."
Lisa W.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/20/2017,The Coconut Lime Chicken was delicious and a great value. Sit at the bar. Incredible service and almost always seats available
Gloria Z.,"Hempstead, NY",114,308,1184,2.0,4/27/2015,"OK, so, ""The Cheesecake Factory."" Seems if you're reading this review, either you've never been to one of these, or you're wondering if ""this one"" is any different from other ones you've been to.  (It's not, with the possibly exception of the parking situation.) This is a place you either like a lot, or strongly dislike.  I think if you enjoy spending time in huge crowded shopping malls, this will be your kind of place.  For me, I don't care for either, and the only reason I have eaten at one of these four times in my life (most recently yesterday) is due to having received a gift card and not wanted it to go to waste.   To me, Cheesecake Factory is the epitome and definition of the huge corporate bloated nationwide chain, with a too-huge and unfocused menu, usually located (appropriately) in a huge. sprawling bloated suburban mall with a huge parking lot. (In this particular case, though, the parking lot is NOT huge enough.  It is so undersized -- or rather the mall oversized -- that they offer VALET parking for the MALL.  Be warned! Even the name of the place turns me off.  Who wants to eat at a ""Factory""? And that's what it feels like inside most times.  As has been suggested, if you must go here to spend a gift card, aim for the bar.  They do offer some creative cocktails (and fortunately, gift cards do not exclude alcohol!) Service? Could go either way, as you see from the great variance on that subject in the reviews. A corporate enterprise of this size has scores of employees, so on any given Saturday afternoon who knows which ones will be there, unlike a local restaurant where a manageable number of regular employees have pretty regular shifts and you know what to expect.  We've seen both ends of the service spectrum here.  Food? Some items are pretty tasty, yes,  but everything gives the impression of mass production, almost like upscale fast food. Sometimes it comes out really, really fast.  A little TOO fast, if you know what I mean. Combine this with the warehouse atmosphere, I just can find no reason to recommend this place as a dining choice.   This could be a ""good for kids"" restaurant, except, how would you like to show up with a babe in arms plus two runny-nosed whining toddlers and then find out you have to wait 45 minutes for a table, only to be squeezed next to an unhappy couple (who didn't read Yelp first) who'll then be shooting you angry looks throughout the meal as you spill over into what tiny amount of privacy they had to begin with? I would recommend the establishment if you want to purchase a big, delicious cheesecake for a special occasion. For a restaurant experience, no way, except for the mall rat crowd."
Cody J.,"Cincinnati, OH",6,103,13,3.0,1/27/2017,"6 of us went here for lunch during the work week one day - it wasn't terribly busy at all, but we still had to wait to be seated (even though we called ahead) and once seated the service was very slow. However, the server was very friendly and accommodating to everyone - she was certainly working very hard. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, although it was nothing special. Their menu is huge, which is a turn-off for me because it doesn't mean they specialize in anything. It's a nice atmosphere inside, but many of us thought it was cold..... perhaps it was where we were sitting? Everyone of course had to order a cheesecake for dessert. I ordered based on the presentation of the cheesecake displays (the Oreo cheesecake), but I was rather disappointed. It was good, but not excellent like everyone raves about. In my opinion, there are far better restaurants in Cincinnati now and way better desserts to choose from. I will not return."
Carlos P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,4,,4.0,6/7/2016,"Great place for the family.  I have pick almost all the pasta and chicken plates with no disappointments.   Pro: max wait time 10 min, great food, great service, fast turn around on food, clean bathroom and great location to go for a walk after a big dinner. Con: bit pricey, family of 4, we will spend an average of $80 to $100.  Parking, tough to find unless you want to spend on valet.  Kids review: 9 and 7yr old, 5 star all around."
Shelley C.,"Lebanon, OH",166,234,732,3.0,1/13/2015,"We were here Saturday evening with Friends.  We arrived about 4:50 to put our names in for a party of 15, it was already a 2.5 -3 hour wait....holy cow!  We gathered in the bar area and ordered drinks and just stood around (some of us got seats) and talked while we waited for our table. Let me say that this place always seems to be busy whenever we are here and we usually just sit at the bar to eat anyway, because I hate to wait to be seated.  Plus, the bar staff here is really awesome and very friendly.  I do feel that the menu is massive, to say the least.....it can take 10 minutes or more just to browse the menu.  Plus the portions are large - I can never eat all of whatever I get in one sitting, so leftovers it is! The bar list is pretty expansive as well, but I think they are pricey. We had a event to be at at 8pm, so about 6:45pm we ordered some appetizers while we were at the bar.  We ordered the Cuban Rolls and Pretzel Chicken Tenders - they were both good. They came out pretty quickly and they were both steaming hot.   After that we ordered a slice of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to split for dessert, because....well why else was I here except to get me some cheesecake for mah belly!  We have had several of the flavors here but tonight opted for this one. As we were finishing eating and getting our check, they were ready to seat our party, about 7:15pm.  They do not take any call ahead reservations or wait lists for large groups, which would be nice, so that is a bummer. Overall, I think this Cheesecake Factory is very similar to most other Cheesecake Factory's we have been to. Always busy and always a wait.  Good food but a little pricey."
