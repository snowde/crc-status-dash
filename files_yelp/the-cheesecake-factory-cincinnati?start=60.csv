James C.,"Maineville, OH",1,13,7,4.0,9/30/2015,"Service was great. Food was as expected. Not exceptional but good. Menu is something to behold. There are far too many choices, but I think hat is the idea at Cheesecake Factory.  Cheesecake was delicious."
Mishawn S.,"Cincinnati, OH",11,9,2,2.0,5/18/2016,"Is it me or is the Cheesecake Factory going through a shift?  Menu items I. e. Green tea no longer on menu,  turkey burger is a hit or miss,  floors are sticky and server was ""interesting"".  Booth area was dirty, ""Oh yeah there were some kids there earlier"" really and you still approved the area for customers.  Shame on us for tolerating this level of no service.  It's official The Factory is officially off the list - no more late night, mid week dinner runs- the marriage is over . Who knew breakfast potatoes were deep fried whereas there was nothing left of the potatoes but a dry crunchy throat scratching shell of a potato chip. It's over it really is over!"
Hayley M.,"Miamisburg, OH",188,3,5,1.0,1/31/2017,"While we typically receive great service from The Cheesecake Factory, tonight was so awful we probably won't return. We arrived, and after a brief wait we were seated. Our server greeted us by simply asking what we wanted to drink, we didn't learn her name until we received our receipt at the end of our visit. We ordered our food, and recieved bread while we waited. A different server dropped off our food, and as he walked away, our server walked up with drink refills and asked if everything was okay. Since we had just got our food, we said it was, and she walked away. I kept getting bites of undercooked, chewy pasta, and didn't want to finish eating it. We waited almost 15 minutes before our server returned, and her first question was ""do you need a box?"". If you have been gone from the table long enough for THAT to be your first question upon returning, you've been gone from the table for too long.... At that point, my fiancé was finished with his meal, and both of our beverages were empty. I informed her that my food was not satisfactory, she offered to have it remade, but I didn't want to wait that long for new pasta since my fiancé was already finished with his meal and we were ready to leave. I informed the server that we just wanted the check and to leave. She offered to have the pasta made to go, and I declined. She asked if we wanted dessert to go, and we ordered a cheesecake slice. We expected a manager to stop by our table, seeing as one of us was leaving without eating dinner, but no one stopped by. We eventually asked for a manager ourself, because we were so put off by this experience, and didn't understand why a manager hadn't stopped by sooner. A manager stopped by and told us he was aware that my pasta had come out undercooked, and had taken it off the bill, but he was not aware that because of our server taking so long to check back on the table, that we had decided to leave instead of having the meal remade. He apologized, and took the cost of the cheesecake off of the bill. Tonight was a total waste of time, and money. We would have been better off going somewhere else, and I am completely shocked at the complete lack of caring or concern from our server that our dinner had been completely ruined."
Maddie W.,"Cincinnati, OH",43,24,44,3.0,1/17/2017,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years @ this location. (Actually go every year for my birthday!) On Monday my siblings & grandmother were off & after a trip to the doctors office we decided that this was the perfect spot for lunch. After a 45 minute wait (which wasn't bad at all considering we were shopping during), my party was seated. The other 3 people in my party were at the Microsoft store playing the virtual reality game. So for about 10 minutes I sat by myself without any greeting from my waiter (who past by several times). Finally when the remaining people sat down he started off the greeting with ""I'm sorry ma'am, I wasn't ignoring you I was just waiting for the rest of your party"". But after that, the experience went down hill. My table ordered salads, soups, & a club sandwich. Well after all the tables around us (who got there later) got their food (which was like pasta & chicken) we got ours about 30 minutes after ordering. This was an unfortunate event, but I'm in the restaurant industry so I understand rushes so these 3 stars are quickly going to go back to 5 after future experience."
Ashton O.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,15,,1.0,4/14/2017,the service and the food were bad! the chips that came with our spinach dip were old and fried in old oil! really dont waste your money and the customer service here is less than one star ! my husbands food came and then mine was out 15 mins. later all around a bad restaurant  dont waste your time or money here!
Emily L.,"Cincinnati, OH",53,313,19,3.0,1/31/2016,"My boyfriend and I stopped in to get cheesecake to go. It was very hard to tell where the line for the takeout counter ended, because there were so many people. I couldn't tell who was in line and who was ""just looking."" This resulted in somebody cutting me in line. We finally got to order our cheesecake and it was fine, I just wish they had more signage about how the takeout counter works."
B K.,"New York, NY",0,16,5,1.0,12/15/2015,"Went at 11am for lunch because that is when they were able to get a reservation for 9 people.... which first off was a little odd.  I ordered a salad, no chicken.  It came out with chicken.  So while everyone else was eating, they had to remake mine.  This took 35 minutes.  When it came out, it was the incorrect salad.  I asked for a new one and just make it to go because at this point, the entire table had finished eating.  When it arrived, it was AGAIN incorrect.  When I asked the server to reassure, he said yes it was correct and scuffed off.  Turns out, it was not at all correct.  The salad was disgusting, had one soggy tortilla in it and looked nothing like the images it was supposed to.  I never got offered anything while waiting!  Terrible customer service.  All of this for a simple salad."
Olivia M.,"Cincinnati, OH",106,200,423,3.0,1/22/2015,"Brunch is amazing! Love the bruleed french toast. I'm sad it's only served on Sundays.  Lunch/Dinner it's just okay, nothing to write home about.  Loooooove the Cheesecake which lets be honest is the main reason to go to the Cheesecake Factory! My favs are the Strawberry, red velvet and tuxedo.  They are often on a wait so not the best place for a big crowd especially since they are located in the mall. Overall not a bad choice!"
Bianca J.,"Cincinnati, OH",259,107,23,4.0,10/14/2014,"I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory anywhere. Their quality is consistent across the board: delicious! The Kenwood location gets a bit busy, for good reason! They always provide great service and awesome food. I'm a fiend for the chicken and shrimp gumbo over rice. It comes with andouille, and pretty generously-sized shrimp and chicken! I've also had their burgers, which you can't go wrong with. Cheesecake Factory offers a large variety, so it's great for going in a group of picky eaters. There's something for everyone! Just don't go in a group on a Firday or Saturday night.. It gets pretty busy!"
Nicole W.,"Batavia, OH",0,5,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Terrible food! Restaurant was filthy, table wasn't clean had crumbs on it, and my silverware was filthy. My chicken Alfredo was disgusting the noodles were over cooked, then chicken tasted boiled and was tough and the sauce was disgusting it tasted like broccoli was grated over top of it! I will not return! How ever the sever was incredibly sweet and great at her job! Hire new table busters and kitchen staff that can cook noodles!"
Amanda T.,"Fremont, CA",387,105,103,4.0,10/19/2015,"Because the Cheesecake Factory is ALWAYS delicious, because of their CHEESECAKE! This is a chain restaurant, but I am so glad it is because I can always find one when I am craving some guaranteed good cheesecake. This is a great place for big groups. Granted around meal times and especially on weekends you will have to wait awhile, and I don't think they take reservations. Also, it's at Kenwood so there is difficult mall parking sometimes. However, worth it when you want to get your Cheesecake fix.  They always make sure you have water. My family likes to get the flavored iced tea. Then they always bring you some of their complimentary bread, which who doesn't love free bread! (Be ready to eat when you come here!) They have a delicious honey wheat with oats on it and a typical French bread. The wheat will change your life, so good! (As I write this I am getting excited that I have plans to eat here again soon!) Their menu is VERY LARGE! If you aren't sure what type of food you want, this can be a good choice because they have all types of food. Also, if you're looking for something specific chances are they have it! Every meal I have had here is good. They also have a Skinny menu, which I appreciate so I can also enjoy the bread and cheesecake. The ricotta and sausage flatbread is so good, and be warned it does have a bit of garlic on it! The lettuce wraps with chicken are also scrumptious and you feel so full after! All of the cheesecakes I have tried are AMAZING! I am particularly excited about the pumpkin cheesecake right now. However, the Oreo, cookie dough, basically all of the cheesecake you can't go wrong! If you have never been before, this place will change your life! Guaranteed good meal, you just might have to wait for a table a bit."
Scott N.,"Hayward, CA",151,435,681,3.0,8/22/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is A-OK. HUGE menu, which is a plus, but nothing I've tried is truly extraordinary. I do love the fried mac and cheese.  Portions are huge (even on the light menu)... so dessert (all those amazing cheesecakes) is a challenge.  We meet friends here often. It's a nice time. It's... A-OK.  Recommend coming for the cheesecake... come here for dessert."
Emily S.,"Cincinnati, OH",84,125,209,3.0,7/30/2015,"In honor of half-price cheesecake, a friend and I made our way over to the Cheesecake Factory last night. After about an hour wait (half price cheesecake is VERY popular), we were seated and enjoying the complimentary bread.  For me, the Cheesecake Factory is a place where you need to understand the menu and the food. Many of the menu options are absolutely loaded with calories and sodium (even some of their salads are questionable). And their lowest calorie cheesecake (non-low carb option) is a whopping 700 calories for one slice! The portion sizes are also very large (which adds to all the extra calories), and never have I seen anyone finish a full serving of any of their pasta entrees in one sitting. Having this information in mind, it is easier to plan accordingly. I usually opt for an appetizer off their Skinnylicious menu and only eat half, then splurge on a cheesecake. Other times, I will split regular menu items (the four-cheese pasta is delicious!) and a cheesecake with my boyfriend. Overall, you can still enjoy their food while controlling the calories and portions you take in."
Alex O.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,19,,5.0,3/13/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory! I get the mac and cheese burger every time and I love it ! Of course like the name suggests the cheesecakes are to die for ! Good atmosphere and great location. The only thing I don't like is the seating. Sometimes you have to share a booth with another table.
Linds D.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,16,,1.0,3/12/2017,I placed a carry out order and was told my order would be ready in 10-15 mins.  I get there and have to wait in line with everyone placing their orders for carry out.  They need to have a separate line for those that called ahead and placed their orders.  Fix this Cheesecake Factory!
Ryan H.,"Orinda, CA",53,124,1,3.0,8/1/2016,"Okay, not amazing. Ate this due to the limited choices of food available Sunday night. Got a salad. Lots of greens not a lot of sauce or chicken. Sorta sad, $10 Margherita Pizza was a rip off. One small pizza with four slices. Overpriced unspecial food. I would go back to try the cheesecake but not the food."
Chris W.,"Kenwood, Cincinnati, OH",14,31,2,2.0,7/25/2016,"Have been on multiple occasions however this most recent trip was not their best effort. Server did what she could but ultimately that didn't help matters. Took too long to order as she may have had to many tables. Food was brought in stages. Our kids food came first, adults came about 6-8 minutes later??  To make it worse, my wife's hamburger was undercooked and had to be remade!!   All of our troubles were not offset by management either. Difficult experience a Dan I can say we won't be making the trip back on the near future."
Emily S.,"Cincinnati, OH",111,148,78,5.0,10/9/2015,"We were seated right away and service was amazing. We just got drinks, apps, and cheesecake. Definitely recommend the avocado, Zucchini, & Portobello fries app. The Kahlua Coffee Cheesecake was also fantastic."
Jessica M.,"Laveen Village, AZ",16,14,6,4.0,6/20/2015,"Chicken Costello, potatoes, asparagus, and lime cream sauce is amazing.  Ribeye steak and fries so good you don't need A1.  Great service."
Reese M.,"Milford, OH",5,99,18,4.0,4/13/2015,"Located in Kenwood off I-71, this Cheesecake Factory is easy to get to.  Be warned, if you come here on the weekend, parking is very hard to come by.  This isn't fault of the restaurant but it does effect overall experience.  The parking lot is incredibly small! Once you're in, pretty standard to other Cheesecake Factories.   For this particular dining experience, we were seated in about 5 minutes. Waitress was attentive and responsive to our needs as a guest. Food was delicious. Desert was even better.  I always get strawberry cheesecake. 4/5 stars because of poor parking."
