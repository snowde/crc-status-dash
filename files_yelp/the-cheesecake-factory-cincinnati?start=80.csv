Grant M.,"Cincinnati, OH",13,62,,4.0,8/5/2016,"This is another bipolar restaurant. The service and food depends on the day. It's 5-star when it's clicking and average when not. I love the lettuce wraps. Their bread is amazing. So is their plantains. Most days it's good, so don't let my opening comments scare you away, but I did warn you just in case."
Tina K.,"Cincinnati, OH",527,199,,1.0,4/3/2016,"This is for a visit on Friday, April 1st.  Had this been my 1st visit, it would be my last.  I've been here numerous other times and those visits would rate at least 3 or 4 stars.   I arrived at 3:15, not a terribly busy time, and was told to wait before being seated for no apparent reason.  Once seated, my server arrived almost immediately to take my drink order.  I asked for a glass of ice water and a glass of white wine.  I also put in an order of Crispy Crab Bites.  The ice water arrived first and it was in a plastic mug with a handle.  Maybe it's just me but I prefer ice water to be in an actual glass.  Less than 5 minutes after ordering, my crispy crab bites arrived.  They were lukewarm at best.  I was almost done with them when the glass of wine finally showed up.  Not sure why but it always takes soooo long to get something from the bar here.  I ordered the pasta w/ shrimp & sausage but asked them to skip the shrimp and make it just sausage.  My server asked if I wanted bread and I said I did.  She brought the bread dish and a small bowl containing 2 pats of butter that were hard as a rock.  No possible way of spreading butter on the bread.  The menu says my pasta dish is  served w/ marinara sauce & basil.  When the dish arrived, the little bit of sauce on it was dried onto the pasta and it was an odd orange color.  It reminded me of cream of tomato soup.  This is not how marinara sauce is supposed to look.  They did skip the shrimp but the dish only had 4 clumps of sausage.  There were 3 long green wilted strips of what I'm assuming was supposed to be basil but it looked very unappetizing and I removed them from the bowl.  I asked for extra sauce which was brought out quickly but the odd orange color made it very unappealing.  As for the taste of the dish itself, quite frankly I could prepare something better in my own kitchen.  As I tried working my way thru it, I bit into a stem of some sort and a few bites later I bit into what appeared to be an onion piece but I couldn't chew it.  While all of this is going on, there was a woman bussing tables all around me and I can honestly say there is no possible way she could have made any more noise than she did.  I realize that gathering silverware can cause some clatter but this was clatter to the EXTREME as she struggled to cram it into the used glasses.  When placing new plates onto the bussed tables, she reminded me of a poker dealer as she tossed them onto the tables and they slid, very noisily across to their places.  The only redeeming factor to this visit was the piece of key lime cheesecake I ordered to go.  Like I said earlier, I've been here many times and it has always been much better than this visit.  I usually order the Steak Diane and it's fabulous.  This visit has changed my opinion of this place though.  As I walked out, I actually felt like I wanted my money back."
Jessie T.,"Cincinnati, OH",283,256,229,4.0,7/24/2014,"I usually am not a fan of huge chain restaurants, but I've always been a fan of this place, mainly because they give you more than a bang for your buck and their cheesecake is delicious. Yes, their selection is way bigger than it should be, but I think it should be appreciated that they try to include a vast variety of different cuisines.. and they do not do a bad job of it."
Ron G.,"Bethel, OH",8,46,59,4.0,3/19/2015,"I freely admit it; I attach a stigma to chain restaurants. There is something with the cold commercial detachment of everywhereness that cheapens even a divine meal for me. That said, while eating here too much would likely leave you in an early grave the flavors they impart are divine. This is not the place to go if you are on a diet. The portions are huge and the decadence drips from each fork full. Bold flavors are well developed and plentiful. True to their name, the cheesecake leaves nothing to be desired. Give it a try, but maybe limit it to a once a month indulgence. ;)"
Alyssa R.,"Columbus, OH",101,13,,1.0,9/9/2016,"So we're in from out of town and decide to order take out from this location. I placed our order at 6:15, they tell me it'll be 20-25 mins for two apps, an entree (pasta), a side salad and a piece of cheesecake. Ok, no problem. I drive the 15 mins it takes to get to the restaurant arriving at the curbside parking spots by 6:35. I could have walked in but I'm 36 weeks pregnant with my toddler in the car, not the easiest thing to manage. I call the number, describe my car, they tell me our food will be out in a couple mins. At 6:55 a server walks out with someone else's food who arrived 15 mins after we did. She takes my credit card and says she'll be right back. She comes back with our food at 7:05. She's nice enough and it's not her fault everything took so long so I don't punish her by not tipping, that's not cool. It appears all of our food is there. I drive the 15 mins back to our hotel and by this time (if you've ever been pregnant) I'm practically starving. I open the box with the $4.95 side salad that is not worth the money as its a handful of mixed greens with 1 slice of cucumber and two wedges of tomato. And NO dressing. Now this seems like no big deal but it's not like I just have dressing laying around my hotel room. I call the restaurant, the server I speak to initially asks if I wanna come pick up some dressing. WHAT?! No, I want you to take the salad off my bill. She puts me on the phone with the manager, Sarah I'm pretty sure she said. I explain the situation, she tells me the dressing is probably hiding in the box, No I checked already, she asks me if I wanna come pick up some dressing. WHAT?! No, I want you to take the salad off my bill. After everything she's willing to take half the price of the salad off my bill. You've got to be kidding me. The amount of money Cheesecake makes every year, scratch that every day you'd think they can afford the overpriced salad for the lack of prep and customer service they're offering. Thank goodness we're from out of town and won't be returning to this location again. Pathetic."
Mary M.,"Cincinnati, OH",42,50,172,2.0,6/28/2015,"I dined here with my mother and sister on a Monday afternoon. We had not been to the Cheesecake Factory in months and were excited to eat here again. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived and we were seated right away. The waitress came over after a few minutes and took our drink orders but it took close to 15 minutes to get drinks or bread.  The worst part (and the reason I only gave 2 stars) was that we waited over an hour for our food after ordering. We were not told in advance that there would be a long wait for food and we were given no explanation as to why it took so long. We were not offered more bread during our wait. The food was hot when it came out but we will probably never go back since the service was so poor. Again, the waitress nor a manager apologized to us or gave an explanation as to what took so long when the restaurant was not busy at all. When we paid as much as we did for our food, we expected better service. We were going to get cheesecake to take home but by the time we finally got our food and ate, we just wanted to leave."
Alexandra L.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,1.0,9/9/2016,"Called ahead for pick up.  Went in to the counter to pick up as opposed to curbside, thinking that it would be quicker and easier on the counter worker.  We get there at 20 mins. After the order was placed, was told 20-25 mins. Over the phone.  We pay for our order and get our mashed potatoes right away...but she never says anything about our 2 desserts that she read out loud off of the ticket.  Well, while standing there, another employee opens the fridge and pulls out 2 desserts to get to something from the back of the fridge about 5 mins. After the payment and receipt of the mashed potatoes.  Some 25 mins. Later I approach the woman who had performed the transaction with me and asked if there was a chance my food was ready.  She looks at the ticket, goes to the fridge, and what would you know, she pulls out the two desserts referred to earlier!!! Then says that she has to go ask them scoop ice cream for the desserts! No apology, or even recognition of mistakes. Poor systems, over priced, mediocre food, and poor service.  Not a recipe for future success and customer word of mouth"
Laura M.,"Cincinnati, OH",40,58,43,4.0,4/17/2014,"Had lunch here with my two daughters, mother and grandmother.  They were very polite and patient with the variety of age we had.  The food was yummy.  My oldest had the shrimp spring rolls and was in love.  I had the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich and it was freshly fried and delicious.   The portions were generous too.  The service was nice.  Nothing fast nor slow.  Just what you would expect."
Amanda K.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,20,13,4.0,10/21/2015,My birthday fell on a Sunday this year where my friend and I attended the Cheesecake Factory for Sunday brunch. Food was fantastic and service was great. Not a big fan of the close quarters. Didn't like hearing the conversation of the couple next to me. I tried the bacon bacon cheeseburger for the first time and let's just say it won't be the last.
Angela S.,"Canton, MI",67,89,94,5.0,5/28/2015,"We were really in the mood for sushi, but since it was 3pm and the sushi place didn't open until 5, he asked if I had ever been to Cheesecake Factory.  I had, he had not, and neither had my daughter.  So, Cheesecake Factory it was, and what a great decision!  No line in the middle of the afternoon, great service, and fantastic food.   The Fire-Roasted Artichokes were delicious and perfectly prepared.  The Ahi Carpaccio was art on a plate, and equally as tasty.  Our entrees were Four-Cheese Pasta, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  We passed them all around, and the consensus was that we had made an excellent choice for our early dinner.  Truly, it was probably the best Jamaican Jerk sauce I have ever eaten. He ordered 1/2 and 1/2 sweet and unsweet tea, and our waiter, Marquis, kept his glass full, bringing both pitchers to the table with each refill.  A shout out to Marquis for outstanding service and attention to detail.  It is those types of little things that make a dining experience worth five stars, and this definitely was.   For our grand finale, we ordered three types of cheesecakes and again shared them all, flourless Godiva Chocolate, Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, and Mango Key Lime. All three were party-in-your-mouth delicious! One of the benefits to this location is the ability to walk off dinner in the mall after your meal.  All in all, the food and the service were absolutely outstanding. I will be back when I am in town."
Allie M.,"Cincinnati, OH",53,46,6,5.0,5/31/2015,"I went for lunch today and was so impressed with my server, Jeffery. Before he even came over to take our drink order he brought a plate with bread and a sliced banana for my 9 month old son. I thought it was a very nice gesture to help keep my son occupied during lunch! I know sometime this location tends to be busy but the wait is well worth it!  I love that there is a lunch menu with smaller portions. When I am at the mall to shop I don't want to have to carry around leftover food. Ordering from the lunch menu is perfect!  I recommend the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, or the red velvet. You really can't go wrong with either of them! I do suggest sharing a slice though!"
Anjelica N.,"Cincinnati, OH",229,271,27,2.0,2/12/2014,"I truly embrace the philosophy, ""A jack of all trades is a master of nothing."" Evidently, the Cheesecake Factory and I don't see eye to eye on this. Cheesecake Factory makes..well...amazing cheesecake. This is something I cannot and will not ever deny. I could stay at those dessert displays and proceed to eat as much cheesecake as humanly possible, but I digress. Cheesecake Factory's menu is notorious for being highly expansive, covering different types of cuisine across the map. The food, usually, isn't bad. But it's never great. It's often times very salty. As in, ""oh my gosh this is so salty, I can feel my blood pressure rising."" With that said, the Italian food is extensive but nothing too out of this word. The Asian inspired food? Just don't. Please don't. The burrito and fish tacos - passable. Everything is simply...okay.  On top of the mediocre food (I'm not including the cheesecake - which I could write love stories for), the price doesn't match the quality. I mean really? C'mon now.  And last but not least, the noise. Sweet Jesus, the noise. Never come here if you want to have a good conversation with your friends...and DEFINITELY don't come here on a date. It's so loud, I can't even hear myself think."
Leah G.,"Lawrenceburg, IN",81,5,1,1.0,1/30/2015,Went there last night and the service wasn't all that great and neither was the food. I ordered the California cheesesteak sandwich and took the other half home. I guess I didn't notice since the restaurant was so dark that there was green mold on my bread. Will never eat here again.
Robert L.,"Brentwood, TN",259,264,,4.0,6/30/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory I just come for the cheesecakes. The food is fairly unhealthy and average but their desserts make up for it. I also like the decor the restaurant its to my liking. I do not eat here a lot but when I do I get the vanilla bean cheesecake its on point. I would recommend this place to all the skinny people that need to gain a few pounds but for me I cannot eat here that much I would be 300 pounds if I did but its a great place to eat once in a blue moon. I would recommend it if you are hungry also the Thai Lettuce Wraps are point here, very very good."
Hannah G.,"Cincinnati, OH",22,72,479,2.0,2/7/2016,"The first time I went there, our server checked to make sure what all was vegan with the chef and said Evelyn's pasta was vegan and the sourdough bread was vegan. Happy visit and was very satisfied. Second time I went there, no only did we have a rude host in person (also rude over the phone who refused to take a reservation saying they were closing early, which did not end up being the case, by the way), our server this time said he checked with the chef and they said Evelyn's pasta and sourdough both had eggs in them. So I could basically order nothing except the smoothie (the smoothie this time wasn't the yummy smoothie consistency I had last time). PETA's website says Evelyn's pasta and sourdough bread are vegan for Cheesecake Factory by the way. I felt deceived but glad came here a second time so I knew things they say are not true because which server are we supposed to trust? Never returning to Cheesecake Factory ever again."
Rhonda W.,"Franklin, OH",156,511,20507,5.0,5/9/2015,Love their cheese cake ... ..the food is ok.  the menu is huge ..the portions are large but the food is hit or miss.  I like their mushroom soup but otherwise .. we just get  the cheese cake there but eat elsewhere. Highly recommend the food next  door at Magginos .
Stephanie W.,"Cincinnati, OH",32,90,213,5.0,5/18/2015,"Came here 7 days apart just for the lemon drop martini. I must say the drink is worth the dining experience. I skipped the cheesecake on the second visit. The fried macaroni and cheese is really good. I had the mini chicken sandwiches with a side of fries, both were good.  We ordered loaded  chicken nachos, there was enough to share. I can't wait to return."
Lindsay W.,"Anderson Township, Cincinnati, OH",23,14,13,5.0,7/14/2014,"I love the fact that when I come here with a group everyone can get what they want. The menu is crazy BIG, but I've never had a meal I didn't like. You can't go wrong with any of the Ahi Tuna, my fave! Lunch is the best time of day to go and beat the crowd.  P.S. Chocolate Rasberry Truffle Cheesecake"
Amy B.,"Milford, OH",13,1,,2.0,5/21/2017,"The food here wasn't the issue; that was tasty, as usual, and our server was very nice. However, the handling of our party soured the night for me. We came in with a larger party - six adults, a child and an infant. We were first seated in a six-top booth with a chair ( no high chair).  Well, we tried but it was cramped, and they very kindly moved us...to a six-top TABLE with a high chair but no chair. We actually tried that too, until a host came to seat a couple at the 2-top beside us. Now, the high chair was between our table and that one (an 18"" gap), meaning that no one could get up or down from either table without moving the high chair. And as I scrambled to shift my baby and our bag out of the way, the host just stood there - no offer to help, or attempt to take that poor couple to a better location. I ended up asking her to just remove the high chair and spent most of the night (an 18th bday dinner for my son) out in the mall because there was no hope of eating without the high chair. To top it off, the hostess gave me a nasty look as I walked out with the baby."
Geekar L.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,320,1195,4.0,7/5/2012,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory before, but this time was an overall better experience! My sister and I came here for dinner around 6:30 and we were quickly seated at a table facing the bar. Our waiter was quick and friendly, even though it took me forever to pick something off the menu! After we ordered, warm bread and butter was brought to our table, I always appreciate warm bread! =)  We ended up ordering the firecracker salmon for an appetizer, shrimp scampi and grilled pork chops. All of which were good choices. The firecracker salmon was similar to a spring roll, but with cooked salmon and spinach. It was tangy and pretty good, but I like my salmon raw rather than cooked. My shrimp scampi was delicious; I actually cleaned my plate, which rarely happens! The shrimp was fresh and flavorful. The angel hair was cooked to the perfect texture, which went well with the buttery wine sauce. I didn't try the pork chops, but they looked good. I tried the mash and the apple sauce that came with it, I would eat that all day if you'd let me, haha.  We were stuffed, but as our waiter cleared the table, I answered him eagerly when he asked us if we wanted the dessert menu. In my head I was thinking, I've only been waiting all night! I ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, yummy chocolatey goodness! My sister ordered the Tiramisu, which was good too. not overly sweet. The food was good and the service was good. I will definitely be coming back here before returning to NY!"
