Diana L.,"North Miami, FL",175,287,619,4.0,2/11/2017,"These place never disappoints on food no matter what location you go to, the food always tastes delish. I got the lettuce tacos and they were pretty good and healthy. I also got to try a little bit of everyone else's food. The pasta is the best in this place! It's so greasy and delicious! And full of flavors. The flat breads were good, as well.  We went in a hurry since we had a movie to catch at 8, so we asked the waiter to let us know what cooks quick and will be ready fast since we only had an hour. He told us anything fried and pasta lol, well so we ordered just that. He offered really good service and was quick, which we needed at that moment."
Jo Jo C.,"Markham, Canada",47,210,178,4.0,1/10/2017,"We were visiting and ended up stumbling upon cheesecake factory as we vised coconut grove area. This was on the second floor of a building. There isn't Cheecake Factory in Toronto, where our group was from, so we did enjoy being able to eat here. The food are in huge portions. Just like all places in the states... The food was enjoyable and we like everything that we ordered. From the salad to the pasta, and pizza. Everything came out accordingly. We were a large group with approximately 10 including kids and we were still being taken care of to quite an extent I will be back if we visit again!"
Heather S.,"Miami, FL",98,77,324,4.0,5/20/2016,"Came here as a birthday dinner celebration for my mom. And on a Friday night of all times when everyone seems to be prowling the streets to do something exciting to kick off the weekend. Arrived close to 7 o'clock and our party of 5 was seated pretty quickly. Surprisingly, they weren't too busy at this time on a Friday, which was great for us since we didn't have to wait long to get a table. :)  Now, for those of you who have never been here before, their portions are pretty big. Don't fill up on the complimentary beard if you want to finish your meal. They certainly don't want you to go home hungry so definitely come on an empty stomach!  Luckily for me, I was practically starving by the time we made it to the restaurant and though I was slowly being seduced by the bread that was wickedly trying to get me to eat it, I held on strong! That was until the appetizers came and, needless to say, there went that notion. My sister was really craving the nachos so we started with that and got some pot stickers to start off the night. Our waiter was more than friendly, he certainly had some quick wit going on with some of our outrageous questions that seemed to have gotten asked. He didn't miss a beat. I am now convinced he is definitely a Jedi and really does meet up with Yoda out in the Everglades. =D Totally cool by my standards!  Also, one must have cheesecake when they go to the Cheesecake Factory! I mean, it's in their freakin' name for crying out loud!! :) The dessert menu is full with all sorts of tasty goodies that I'm sure will have you wishing you could have one of each. If you're not a fan of cheesecake, not to worry, they have regular cake too to satisfy that sweet tooth of yours. :P **Just a side note, parking can be a bit of a hassle, you can opt for the street or find a garage nearby. Either way, you're probably not going to find front row parking, especially if it's a Friday night, so do expect to do a bit of walking to get to your destination. It's not as bad as it seems though, you at least get to take in a bit of Coconut Grove on your journey."
Sabryna L.,"Miami, FL",56,321,487,3.0,4/29/2017,"I wanted to give Cheesecake factory another chance since my boyfriend absolutely loves this place. I changed my mindset to specifically order non-healthy meals, since I find that they do not have good options for healthy meals. As an appetizer, I ordered the Korean Fried Cauliflower. Though it may seem healthy, it probably wasn't because it was delicious. I think the menu said 1,000 calories - wow... It wasn't filling at all as an appetizer, but I would definitely order it again. My main entree was the fettuccine alfredo. I remember it tasting differently from my pre-yelp younger years. Of course when the waiter comes, I make him put an entire mountain of cheese on the serving for me. But by the time the cheese is gone, I noticed there wasn't any real flavor to the alfredo sauce. While pasta most likely always tastes delicious, this one started tasting a little bland towards the end. In my very many trips here, this is a reoccuring issue. I wish I could say I found my go-to dish here, but sadly it hasn't happened yet."
Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",202,439,2581,5.0,11/12/2015,"Although I may not admit it to my American friends (I'm a Brit), I LOVE it here! Our server (Xindi?) was really nice and constantly refilled our drinks when we were running low and the food came out really quick and it was delicious!  Firstly, the sweet brown bread from the complimentary bread basket is devine! I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich (one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!) and my husband ordered the taco salad. My sandwich had the perfect combination of ingredients and flavor to make it amazing!!  It was sooo good!! I love that you have marinara sauce to dip your sandwich in. My husbands salad was so large, he loved it.  We of course couldn't leave without cheesecake. We shared 1 slice of the salted caramel cheesecake, which I have to say, was AMAZING. The best flavor I have tried at Cheesecake Factory and it had a thick biscuit crust/base that I loved.  All round it was a fabulous experience, the food was great and our server was really great. We came away happy customers!"
Vanessa K.,"Miami, FL",0,40,29,1.0,4/1/2017,"Ordered delivery via door dash. Food arrived 35 minutes late and cold.  We ordered the Mac and cheese balls which were good. However, we ordered the four cheese penne pasta and buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were disgusting and our orders were wrong."
Zeina T.,"Miami, FL",35,3,,1.0,11/3/2016,"Wow! I never take the time to write a review, but this was a really bad experience. How disappointing! I usually love the food there, but the staff at this location specifically is soooooo unprofessional including management.  I walk in to dine at the bar after a long day at work thinking it's one of favorite spots to eat, and nothing can go wrong. At 1st, I stood by the bar waiting for the bartender Desiree to finish texting. I waited and waited and she wouldn't turn around and never even realized I was there. So I had to interrupt her texting, and finally placed my order which I already knew without needing a menu, being a regular customer. My cellphone had run out of battery, and I needed to turn it on and use it to request Uber once I'm done. So I asked her if she could get it charged. She said that the charger is available but not for guests needs. I asked for the manager on duty and asked what this meant. The manager Nina who took long to see me said that the bartender had her personal phone charger and is free to choose whether to let me use it or not. 1st, the bartender shouldn't be on her personal phone to begin with ignoring me while I'm waiting for service. And 2nd , no one is supposed to be more important than the customer.  I ended up just walking out immediately and going to another restaurant. I will only go to Dadeland location from now on."
Michele L.,"Miami, FL",33,155,,1.0,3/28/2016,"The resto was about half full but we were seated at the end table at the kitchen.  When we asked for another seating, the hostess rolled her eyes at us. We sat overlooking the street and the window sills were filthy with dust and food as was the floor. An single old fashioned was $12.  The dynamite shrimp was a greasy tempura with a few tablespoons of what tasted liked a paprika ranch dressing.  The favorite meatloaf was salty; dry and burnt at the edges.  The mushroom gravy tasted packaged with one single piece of mushroom.  The mashed red potatoes and succotash were good enough but tasted like diner food. Very disappointing!"
Naty K.,"Miami Beach, FL",283,1043,9873,4.0,4/6/2015,"I like Cheesecake Factory because the menu is so varied that it's impossible not to find something you like.  Plus, the food is tasty, and even if you don't get their cheesecake, you can drool over them and the amazing ingredient combinations staring back at you from behind the glass, and just dream...  Whether you want salads, pasta, seafood, or steak, they're here to please.  Even better, they now have a low calorie menu called the ""Skinnylicious"", so even the more health-conscious people can find something they like.  There's also a kids' menu, which has pretty affordable kid-approved options for even the most finicky kid.   I ordered a Skinnnylicious Fresh Vegetable Salad, and was thrilled by the variation of vegetables in it.  I don't think I have seen a salad with so many ingredients before: asparagus, green beans, tomato, cucumber, roasted beets, apple, edamame, radicchio, Romaine and white cheddar, with a pomegranate vinaigrette.  I also added chicken.  Sure, it wasn't as ""unbutton your pants because you're going to explode"" filling as their larger, calorie-laden options, but it was still quite satisfying, and with different, refreshing flavors going into your mouth, it was a new experience. I do want to warn you though, that being on Cocowalk, this location can get quite full.  We had a 30 minute wait, and though that normally would have made me give this location 2 or 3 stars, our waiter Kathleen was so great and so patient (we had 3 kids in our party, on a play date, so you can imagine how indecisive and rowdy they can get), that she is the reason I decided to give them a 4.  At one point, I needed to accompany the girls to the restroom, and the waitress was perfectly fine with that.  She made sure they didn't clean our table and rushed me off to go take care of the girls.  If all the waiters are this great, then I definitely stand behind my 4 star rating. It got too late to order cheesecake and kids shouldn't eat sugar late at night or they'll bounce off the walls and never sleep, so we had to skip on the cheesecake, but next time, we already know what we'll be ordering!"
Violet P.,"Edmonton, Canada",110,951,427,4.0,11/9/2014,"This location is in the Cocowalk area and was just 2 minutes away from our hotel.  It was a weekday evening and not busy around 6PM so we were shown to a table promptly. I'm familiar with this chain but had never eaten there before so it took a while to go through the menu.  There is a lot of items to choose from the appetizers to mains, and I wanted to save room for cheesecake!  Our server was attentive to check if we had questions about the menu and if we were ready to order.  She said portion sizes were big so that helped me decide what to have.  I had the tex mex egg rolls which were an appetizer but was enough for a meal.  There were so many flavours of cheesecake to choose from but I picked the tiramisu one.  The piece wasn't too big and rich to enjoy after my meal but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I enjoyed it with a cup of tea. I liked the food and service.  Would be back."
Moraine S.,"Miami, FL",80,74,186,3.0,8/20/2016,"I came here Tuesday evening with my fiance for a quick late night dinner. I love the atmosphere and the location of this restaurant. I am particularly used to the location at Aventura Mall since it is closer to my home. Our waitress took our order and brought our food out, which did take some time but I wasn't too picky about that. The food quality could have been better. I don't know if it was due to the fact that they were about to close in about an hour but I order the Shrimp Sandwich along with the Macaroni Cheese Balls. My fries were cold like they were sitting there for days. The fries tasted stale and cold. The waitress was going to take the fries back and get me a fresh batch but I was already full and did see it fit for them to make some more fries if I wasn't going to eat it. Overall the experience was not too bad but the food needs some more improvement."
Charlie S.,"Miami, FL",30,268,,3.0,11/17/2015,"It's always a little funny to review a chain restaurant, I think. Especially one as ubiquitous as The Cheesecake Factory. Nonetheless, here we go:  The location in Coconut Grove is a perfectly average spot. You get exactly what you expect out of the Cheesecake Factory. Big menu with diverse selections, big portions.  I got the the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and, from my read of the menu, thought it would be like a buffalo chicken sandwich. Not so. The coating on the chicken sort of has the spicy sauce cooked in, as opposed to poured on or being tossed in. So as served this was dry, not spicy enough, and a bit underwhelming.  I asked for extra hot sauce and blue cheese dressing which I added myself. And it turned out that the sandwich was pretty good with the additions.  My sweet potato fries were average. Little to say here. Perhaps slightly too crisp/dry for my taste.   Service was (you guessed it) pretty average."
Grei M.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,"Worse ever.. ordered so much food and it all came cold... pizza was cold, ice cream was melted, salad came totally different, shrimp  scampi pasta was cold. Overall a bad experience."
Jeff G.,"Edmonton, Canada",42,214,117,4.0,11/16/2014,"The selection is wide and the portions are huge. Pastas, burgers, steaks, fish & seafood, pizza, etc. I ordered the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with spicy Buffalo sauce. (HOT!!!) It came with French Fries on the side. I should've ordered a bucket of ice too. Did I mention it was hot? I got the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake™ for dessert. Another large portion. I could barely finish the cheesecake because the servings were so big. The food was awesome. It was a quiet weeknight when my wife and I went there so it was a laidback intimate evening. Our server was very nice, polite, and soft-spoken. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and glad to answer all the questions we had. It took us a while to decide what we wanted because the menu was so expansive but she was patient with us. The restaurant plays loungy, soft jazz music which adds to the tranquil atmosphere. Not my cup of tea but it seemed to fit for the evening. If we're in Miami again, we'll definitely revisit this place."
K S.,"Miami, FL",0,10,,1.0,6/30/2016,"Boy has the cheesecake factory in the Grove taking a complete nosedive..   Let me list my gripes..  -Dirty silverware  -Dirty wine glasses -Dirty bus boys - witnessed bus boy come out of the stall in men's room without washing his hands,  then proceeded to roll silverware packs.. Told Manager,  never responded back.  -Waiting over an hour and a half for food.  Can't wait to come back..."
Leah M.,"Miami, FL",1,21,16,5.0,8/2/2016,"I had an amazing time at Cheesecake Factory due to my terrific service from Marissa the waitress. The food was nothing to rave about, but my service was incredible. Marissa not only catered to our every need, she also gave us great recommendations (instead of just giving expensive suggestions to raise her bill) that were personalized to our wants.  If I come back, I'm asking to be seated with Marissa!"
Ute L.,"Denver, CO",435,864,1196,3.0,1/17/2015,"Just to be clear- someone gave me a CF gift card, otherwise you would not find me in this establishment. I came prepared, having studied their online nutrition guide. It would be fun to play a guess-how-many-calories trivia game here, as one of their salads clocks in at over 1,500 calories, and some of the fruity cheesecakes (wild blueberry for one) actually score higher on the calorie scale than the chocolatey ones.  They were busy on Saturday at 1:00 pm prime time, so I planted myself at the bar. The food came out incredibly fast and all the staff was very pleasant and friendly.  Since I already knew I was going to order a slice of cheesecake, I got the healthiest salad on the menu: Seared tuna with greens, avocado and tomato. I asked for lightly dressed greens, and they still came out more saturated than I like. The salad was good but nowhere near worth $18.  Oreo Dream Cheesecake... Layers of crushed Oreos, dark chocolate cheesecake, vanilla cheesecake, thick milk chocolate icing and Oreo crumbles. Incredibly rich and fatty. Not too sweet. I took my time eating it, even though the guys next to me seemed to get some weird satisfaction out of watching me.  The cake was even better once it came to room temperature. I am literally having heart palpitations now, as my body isn't used to this rich food. 880 calories, BTW - in case you were wondering. It's worth skipping dinner this one time."
Diana R.,"Miami, FL",18,15,6,3.0,2/22/2017,Just had dinner. Took a while to get our food in a half empty restaurant. My food finally came (chicken enchilada) cold!!  Had to wait more so they can microwave it.  It was good but not happy with the waiting and delivery. My drink was great!!
Chelsea R.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,3.0,3/20/2017,"I love the food at cheesecake, but this location is just not ALL that. The service is so slow, staff look like they hate their lives, etc..."
The Gringa ..,"Miami, FL",0,12,,1.0,8/22/2016,"I went to lunch with my boyfriend this past Friday at the Cheesecake Factory in Coconut Grove. I had heard many great things about the Cheesecake Factory and wanted to try it myself. This was the biggest mistake EVER!!! Our server was excellent and took the time to go over many things on the menu that I had questions about. It took me about 20 minutes to decide what I wanted because the menu is full of so many options. We ordered the fried Mac N' Cheese balls as our appetizer. They were delicious and something I've never tried before. Then I ordered a salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes, a pretty healthy choice, right? I was hospitalized later that evening because the salmon contained bacteria. 4 days later, I was finally released from the hospital. DO NOT EAT HERE!"
Renni Robinson P.,"Miami, FL",28,2,,5.0,2/19/2017,So this was my first time at a cheesecake factor outlet here. I was really impressed by their efficiency and service. There was a huge crowd so we had to wait for sometime. But everyone was very professional and well organized. The food and deserts were top class. I definitely recommend this place to everyone.
Seyran C.,"Miami, FL",125,232,130,2.0,10/28/2015,"I usually don't leave reviews for chain restaurants but I feel that Cheesecake Factory lovers should all be aware of some of the pitfalls associated with this restaurant that set it apart from others. First off, it's relatively small. I don't know if it's old, but it feels that way. And due to its proximity to a cinema, it's packed with large, loud families. Let me reiterate: LARGE, LOUD FAMILIES.  Actually, its likely because of this factor alone that service is exceptionally slow, the ambiance isn't as ""date-night-esque"" and the interior feels cramped.  That being said, there's nothing wrong with the food coming out of the kitchen. Same old classics, done consistently with every other Cheesecake Factory we've all likely been to.  My favourite is the Chicken Littles, a mountain of crispy tenders with mashed potato and corn. However, this time, I had El Hub get it while I ventured out into territory I had not yet explored in Cheesecake Factory before: Thai Chicken Lettuce Cups, which were actually delightfully fresh and filling. Moreover, I did not want to run to the bathroom to change into sweatpants immediately following my meal.  What more can I say."
Luis Fernando R.,"Weston, FL",2,4,1,5.0,8/13/2016,Our waitress Tammy made us a special original cheesecake with strawberries and Nutella topping! Thanks Tammy for such a fantastic service
Chris B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",16,15,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Service was pitiful, beer was warm, soup was cold, appetizer tasted like the fryer hasn't been cleaned in weeks, and menu did not have accurate food descriptions. One of our napkins had disturbing stains that appeared to be blood. Also, if the above was not enough to change your mind about visiting this location the server informed us of the tip suggestions at the bottom of the receipt, and parking sucked... I will never come back even if they offered to buy my next meal. This location is an embarrassment."
Yanick H.,"Fayetteville, NC",64,27,1,1.0,12/11/2016,"I always order the guacamole and the Marsala chicken. The guacamole was soupy, o believe they used their salsa to make it, worse guacamole I've ever had at the Cheesecake Factory. The chicken Marsala had a bunch of noodles with minimal sauce. Needless to say that was dry. I don't recommend this place."
Tyonna B.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2016,"I NEVER write Yelp reviews but this was ridiculous. I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory in Miami since I've moved here but I wanted to go for my birthday dinner because it has decent prices & I like the food for the most part but the experience here ALMOST ruined my birthday. This particular location is TERRIBLE. The service was unbelievably slow. We sat down for an hour before we got any of the bread that they serve & we didn't get waters for ANYONE unless we specifically asked. That's stuff that should be given immediately, not an hour later. But whatever. The food was subpar for me (I got the chicken nachos & they weren't even hot by the time they came out). None of the food was served at the same time so you had half the table waiting and the other half waiting an extra 10 minutes before the plates arrived. The service continued to be slow so we asked for the check the SECOND we got our entrees.....still took 30 minutes. The worst part for me was the fact that it was a birthday celebration. They knew it was my birthday because we explicitly told them multiple times. My friend told me at the end of the night that he was pissed because he went to the back and also notified someone that it was my birthday & asked them to sing and give me ice cream....because that's what they do on birthdays & I heard them in the restaurant singing to 2 other different people already. But guess what? It never happened. We had sat there for almost 3 full hours & it was almost 11:00 PM so I decided to forget about it & just told everyone they could go home because it wasn't worth it. Terrible birthday dinner for me and if I could re-do it all over again, from what I'm told: DADELAND Cheesecake Factory is much much better."
Sam R.,"Miami, FL",0,6,1,5.0,1/14/2017,"I came here at least once a week ,, my best spot for the cheese cake factory branch ,, the service and the food are amazing ."
Nathalie B.,"Miami, FL",186,143,51,4.0,6/14/2015,"I can't believe this!  Cheesecake Factory you have finally redeemed yourself! I'm always on the hunt for a great waffle and my friend told me that this place had the best ones she's ever tried.  At first I thought she was crazy!  Cheesecake Factory has a good anything? Doubtful.  I really dislike chain restaurants and I've had a terrible experience in the past with this location.   So this morning my friends decided we would give this restaurant a try for brunch.  I was hesitant but sucked it up because I wanted to see my girls.  I went with the intention of trying this ""amazing waffles"" but ended up ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes instead.  Holy deliciousness!!!  These were amazing!  My friends each ordered waffles and those were sooooo good.   I'll definitely give this place another try for brunch soon."
Julio S.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2017,"Terrible  service, 30 min waiting for a table when the restaurant wasn't full. Appetizer came at the same time with the main course for the other people, we have to wait 30 more min for our entre. Never comeback at this place. No recommend to come at this location or chain. Terrible experience!!!!"
Scott M.,"Miami, FL",34,10,,1.0,1/2/2017,"I have been going to this location consistently for three years now but after what happened on 12/31/16 I may not ever go again.  While eating lunch a gentleman sat at the table next to me with a small lap dog.  He sat eating his food with the dog in his lap.  I went to the front to speak with the Host and Hostess to find out if they allowed dogs in the facility.  Their answer shocked me, they said service dogs and small house dogs.  Really?  Small house dogs. I'm allergic to dogs and cats and the odor of that dog sitting next to me ruined my lunch.  Does the health dept. know this?  Is this your policy at all your locations?"
Michael S.,"Miami, FL",1,8,,1.0,3/14/2016,This place is filthy.  How are you guys going to lay out silverware on top of a table that just got cleaned with a towel that is completely dirty and unsanitary? I literally got sat down by the hostess and got up and left.  The other locations are better.
Alexander K.,"Santa Clara, CA",30,9,1,1.0,6/29/2016,Wow - I wonder why corporate doesn't fix this location... The restaurant seems a little dirty in general. Our table was sticky when we got seated. The steak was far from medium and friendliness is not known in this location. I ordered a cocktail which was done incorrectly and they did not attempt to fix it. It was a pure disappointment and I urge you to choose a different location. I hope corporate will look into this because this is a complete fail!
Rapha R.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,8,1.0,5/26/2017,"I never write bad reviews but i needed to take the time to review this restaurant because i am beyond disappointed! I've been going to cheesecake factory for years and it never disappoints me  but this location was by far one if my worst experiences ever! I'm from Orlando Fl and was on vacation in miami area with friends from California! I decided to take them to cheesecake factory since we all love it! We saw that this location is permanently closing in a couple of days and that should've been a hint to us or at least if should've rang our bell but we didn't pay attention to that! It seems like they just dont care anymore since they are closing! We started with factory nachos when we got our nachos we had a fly on the top enjoying the pico de gallo and sour cream, we noticed as the waitress was putting the plate on the table we told the waitress and we removed the fly ourselves i asked my friends if they wanted to send the plate back (as a matter of facts the waitress didn't offer us to send the plate back nor apologized or even said sorry) we decided to keep it and just removed from the plate all the chips from that area. 2 of us chose the Renee's special=worst decision ever, salad was soggy and even croutons were nasty, when Im about to try my soup my soup spoon was dirty with what looked like dry chocolate, my partner's soup salad was also dirty with what looked like dry cheese by this point we were giving up. By the way when we told the waitress to get clean silverware and showed her how dirty they were she just said ""oh ok i bring you new ones"" not even an ""im sorry"". My friends pasta was horrible, oily and flavorless by this time we just asked for our check and decided to leave!! It has been by far the worst dining experience with careless/inattentive waitress and wasted money! We decided to take our business to a local cuban restaurant instead to have a well deserved dinner and at least we had an awesome experience! I know this location is closing down but dont waste your time and money..... these people just dont care anymore but you are still paying for your food!!"
Peter R.,"Kent, WA",1,68,84,4.0,4/24/2017,"Absolute amazing place in a great location. Go here before​, after or during your shopping trip. But it's best to get reservations way ahead. This place is always crowded. Food is as usual amazing."
Mark N.,"Miami, FL",6,59,1,5.0,7/31/2016,"Who doesn't love national cheesecake day? For a Saturday night, our wait for two was less than five minutes. Our server, Stefano, was wonderful and surprisingly it was his first day! Kudos to him! Food was good and done right. Half price cheesecake was amazing! With as many times that I've been to the Grove, this was my first time coming in here!"
Melissa N.,"North Miami Beach, FL",125,160,72,2.0,1/14/2016,"Service is not a word a lot of people understand, but when you have an empty restaurant and get a 8 people table you should take advantage. Trust me, it's not that hard to make people enjoy their meal and less if you have no more than 3 tables to attend. Even though we enjoyed that this location was not crazy full as the one in Aventura which is closer to us, the service was so bad that we almost left the place and we are for sure not recommending this location."
Mercedes W.,"Miami, FL",124,136,419,4.0,4/13/2015,"The food was good, but Jan (I think that was her name), she was the STAR! Hands down one of the most down to earth, fun,  and engaging waitresses that I have EVER encountered! I am so happy that we were seated in her area. In fact, we will request her area any and  every time that we dine in! She made my birthday dinner awesome sauce!!!"
Nydia M.,"Miami, FL",391,647,166,1.0,10/4/2014,"I just visited this Cheesecake Factory location for what I can guarantee will be the final time. After waiting 20 minutes for bread we placed our order. The waitress was very friendly and her smile was very well received after getting the side eye from the hostess when I asked to not be seated in the hot terrace-like area with the big windows.  I ordered a veggie burger with no mayo and received a veggie burger with a side of mayo and traces of mayo in the lettuce and bread.  Looked like they prepared my burger with mayo, remembered that it wasn't supposed to have mayo, wiped some of it off, and them brought it out to me.  No thanks.  The burger was taken back and the manager stopped by to apologize, which was nice. After having been waiting for food for an hour I finally received my second burger. It was room temperature on the outside and cold on the inside. Cold.  Like straight from the fridge cold. I had three bites because it was 2pm at this point and I was insanely hungry, but it was a gross, cold, soggy/uncooked disaster. The goat cheese and beet salad my husband ordered was ok, but I've had the same salad at another cheesecake factory and it was a lot better. My kids grilled cheese had the most amount of butter I've ever seen in a piece of bread and the ""fresh"" fruit salad that came with it was a soggy mess. Check it out for yourself in the picture I posted. I've had much better meals pretty much everywhere else I've ever gone out to eat. There are much better restaurants in the same price point as this place but with much better quality food within walking distance."
Dawn A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,49,5.0,8/2/2015,"Passed the cheesecake factory on our trip in seattle but never got time to go in, so I was determined to visit when i found this one around the corner from our hotel in miami. Am i glad we did!  The hostess seated us straight away, our waiter 'mike' was friendly and helpful.  My husband had a pit beef dip sandwich, i had a cuban sandwich... We went halves and they were both delicious, really, really tasty, never even put a fry past my lips cause i was so full.... I guess it'll have to be another visit for the cheesecake;-) My daughter had the cajun chicken littles... Not little by any means, she loved them. We will be back!"
Margo B.,"Miami, FL",43,44,68,3.0,11/23/2014,Started off horribly with burnt marcaroni and cheese balls. I was pissed that they were clearly burnt. Theres no way the cook didnt see it. Luis the manager apologized. I am glad he took the time to do that. It really made a difference.  I ordered the chicken and biscuits and it was very good. Very moist chicken and good veggies and mashed potatoes..
