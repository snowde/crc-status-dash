Nancy A.,"Miami, FL",656,393,280,4.0,8/22/2010,the salads are great! HUGEEE... and of course the desserts are to die for. the service is ok and the ambience is in a great location.
Natalie P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",290,206,28,2.0,2/26/2012,"Blah blah blah. It's the Cheesecake Factory. Here's what you need to know: Food: exactly like every other Cheesecake Factory. Décor: pretty much the same as every other Cheesecake Factory. Ambiance: family central, noisy. Service: annoying, slow. I could have sworn that at 8 pm on a Saturday we were seated in ""kiddie central."" There were screaming children and their lazy parents everywhere - our table of four twenty-somethings would have really appreciated NOT being seated beside Princess Screams-a-lot. Annoying children aside, our server was a real PITA. His name was Daniel and he drove me crazy. After my drink still hadn't come out 15 minutes later, I flagged him down to let him know. His response? With sass: ""Yeah, I know, my bartender is really backed up right now."" How is that my problem? I think you mean, ""Oh no, I'm so sorry! Let me see how that's coming!"" Magically he ran right over to the computer and my drink was out in 2 minutes - he just clearly forgot to punch it in. Weirdly, after every time someone at our table said ""Thank You"" to him, he would respond with ""Thank You for Coming."" It was EXTREMELY obnoxious, but we made a game of it, and tried to say ""Thank You"" to him as many times as humanly possible. It was pretty nice payback for his incredibly negative attitude. If it weren't for the friends we were with, the manager probably would have gotten a piece of my mind. Anyway, if you hadn't guessed by the two stars and the review to this point, the Cheesecake Factory is not exactly my favorite restaurants and this is DEFINITELY not my favorite Cheesecake location. Per usual, I'll be avoiding it whenever possible. Especially because of overflow of children and their useless parents."
Monica B.,"Saint Johns, FL",93,194,82,1.0,1/18/2012,"Unfortunately dinner a couple weeks ago was a big crap-ola with the food. The appetizers (corn tamales & the avocado rolls) were decent but my hubby's $15 kobe burger was barely ok in taste  & the sweet potato fries were cold, not warm... Like I just left them in the fridge for 10 min cold. Not kidding!  Alas he decided not to complain so I kept my boca shut. My bro in law's burger also ok, but the fries were also borderline cold. Yuk.  My lettuce mushroom wraps were oilier (dunno if that's a word!) than a Texas drill hole & for reference a romaine skinny ass piece of lettuce doesn't help when u try to wrap stuff to it.  I had to roll that skinny thing like a joint and i didn't know if i should smoke it or eat it!!!  Please use standard iceberg or bib for Pete's sake!  The one star is for the sweet waitress that put up with my tipsy guys & their lame jokes.  Won't be coming back even if I'm super drunk, rather crawl across the street to johnny's..."
Virginia M.,"Miami, FL",427,350,404,3.0,12/9/2012,"No wait?! Are you serious?! Really?! YES! That started off the experience right. My friend and I were seated in 2 minutes! Me likey.  The bread was warm and delicious. My friend ordered the Chicken Piccata and I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos.. and this is where it went downhill. They boy needed salt, badly. They were seasoned but there was no flavor which is a shame. The rice and beans that came with my dish were great though so it wasn't TOO bad but the fact I had to put salt on my food really diminished my happiness.  As always, I always come with the intention of eating cheesecake but because of the portions I could not even fathom the idea of ordering any. Ugh. The service was great. The server here was not pushy like the one at Dadeland which was great but then again, there wasn't a wait of people. Also, this place is much quieter than the Dadeland location in case you wanted to have a conversation."
Gus R.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,1.0,8/21/2015,Bad service. I would never come back here again. They took 30 mins to bring out a salad and kids spaghetti.
Tom S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",9,37,46,4.0,8/1/2014,There seems to always be a 10-15 minute wait but it is worth it. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable of menu. The tables are clean and not wobbly but it is always so hot in the front of the restaurant. We are regulars at this location. Not many drawbacks. Enjoy
Elizabeth M.,"Miami, FL",132,81,114,5.0,3/5/2012,You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.  Let me start off my saying that I am not a cheesecake fan... definitely not my dessert of choice.  However the food and service are always consistent and that would explain the line at the hostess station. The menu is huge!  So grab one and narrow down your choices while you wait for a table.   My favorites: Drinks - PASSIONFRUIT ICE TEA is delish!  Long Island Ice Teas are fantastic! Bread - Only time wheat is better than white is at Cheesecake. Appetizers - Tuna Carpaccio (AMAZING!) and avacado spring rolls Entree - Pasta Davinci Dessert - Tuxedo Cheesecake (Not your ordinary cheesecake!)
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,2.0,10/14/2014,I've been to this Coconut Grove Cheesecake Factory and have never been disappointed until today.I went for my friends bday with her mom and my husband and my son.First off the bathroom needs a serious cleaning I saw a dead rat in the stall with toilet paper everywhere and it smells like a swamp.The staff is friendly but they need to get their act together.Some Waiter tripped and fell and spilled water.Really clumsy person.Our waitress should've done a better job for keeping us happy.My BBQ Salad was terrible but my S'mores Cheesecake was great but also my burger was a little weird I won't go back to this location
Travis H.,"Tampa, FL",278,231,378,4.0,1/2/2012,"First time ever eating at The Cheesecake Factory and it wasn't bad. I really didn't have any expectations I just went hoping for good food and a good time. First the place is set up really nice the tables were already set for you my only problem with that is they had the forks, spoons sitting on the table without any napkins under it and I'm like damn that's kinda dirty looking. So I look past that order my food fish and chips and it was damn good. You ever closed your eyes when you eating? That's how good that fish was. So after all theses years of not paying cheesecake any attention....im upset that I did I've been cheating myself."
Enrique C.,"Miami, FL",32,123,62,3.0,5/3/2012,"This location is a great alternative to the ridiculously packed Dadeland Mall one. The food, like the other restaurants, is very filling and served in big portions. I usually get the Factory Burger, Pulled-pork sandwich, Chicken Marsala, Chicken Madera and most recently the Macaroni n' Cheese Cheeseburger. Go with the mashed potatoes, not fries. Did I mention it's in the Grove?   ;^)"
Kenny L.,"Mississauga, Canada",0,11,,2.0,7/20/2015,"Server was good and pleasant ...deserved 2 of the stars. Food was among the worst of TCF that I had ever eaten in the chain of restaurants. Had the chicken bellagio. The chicken cutlet was way too salty, not crispy and presentation was not typical of TCF.  Pasta didn't have enough sauce....just not very appetizing!  Won't be back to this location."
Victoria A.,"Tampa, FL",198,193,238,4.0,12/12/2011,"First off I love cheesecake so what better place then the cheesecake factory! I had never been to this location but never the lest it was as shnazzy as the last. We got seated and waited on very quickly for a packed house. Our waiter was very friendly and didnt always bither like most of them do. I ordered the 4 cheese pasta( I am a sucker for pasta, LOVE IT) I was deelish! My boyfriend ordered a tropical martini I believe dont quote me on that and the fish and chips basket. He said it was very good and nice and tender. We had the windo seat looking off onto the streets of Coconut Grove. Our only blah of the evening were the young group of kids that were there for a birthday. They were very loud and a bit overbearing. I guess they never learned to use there inside voices. Overall nice time and great date loved it will most def be back hopefully sooner then later."
Danny N.,"Miami Beach, FL",242,235,89,1.0,12/30/2014,I can't believe all the things that went wrong today lol. I arrived earlier than the rest of my party so I sat.... Literally sat for 10 minutes and no one asked if I wanted water or anything for that matter.  Finally the waitress says hello and I order a mudslide with a shot of Baileys on the side. As my party arrived she brought a tiny glass which was supposed to be the recipe for heir mudslides. I mentioned that I had been at the dolphin one at which point it was the bartender that was new. Hmmmm any how she brought me another mudslide slightly larger but forgot the shot which I had poured into the first one.  We ordered our entrees and two fried cheeses.  I told her about the shot of baileys and she said she'd get it.15 minutes later I had finished the mudslide. I order. Second cuz I love torture lol. Her and a guy ask if I want a shot on the side of that one too. I said no since I never got the shot and things weren't going our way. We asked about the cheese since 20 minutes had passed and she went to check. Guess what?? The entrees were done but no cheese!!  Then my sons pizza had a hair in it lmao I'm like seriously?  Worst service in a long long long long time. Skip this place. Let's see if they charged me the shots. They did lol omg you gotta be fucking kidding me!!! They charged me one.
Meagan M.,"Central Fort Lauderdale, FL",175,119,452,5.0,9/16/2013,"They offer a skinnylicious menu which has so many healthy options! It also has quite a few of their signature menu items, made healthy. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, my boyfriend ordered the fish tacos and we both left feeling great (and more than satisfied) about our healthier, delicious options. We sat at the bar to watch a football game. The bartender was extremely nice and offered us many suggestions. If you have eaten here before you know their menu is HUGE and intimidating, so we were grateful. The food was out in about 10 minutes and it was $30 for both of us to eat. We were very happy and will definitely be back!"
Feeding B.,"Miami Beach, FL",9,6,,2.0,11/21/2011,"Last Night we went to The Cheesecake Factory at The Coco Walk in Miami, FL. to celebrate one of our private little  anniversary date. Our server was an incompetent ass clown with chronic halitosis. But we still remained courteous and left a fair tip. My Big Gorgeous ordered an outstanding BBQ pulled pork sandwich while I had some faux Baja fish taco fuckery. Their red sangria was better than expected. We both adored our desserts. Booboo got an Oreo cheesecake and I got the turtle cheesecake. The platter of nachos that Big Sexy made for lunch today totally kicked The Cheesecake Factory's Ass!Lol"
Rosaly C.,"Miami, FL",140,13,3,3.0,3/31/2014,"Ok I give this cheese cake factory an overall 3. I've had my share of good servers and bad... Enough to give it that rating. The tables are crowded a bit, the food takes a bit of time but this place is decent."
Len D.,"Miami, FL",28,146,3,2.0,5/18/2011,"I actually hate coming to this Cheesecake Factory. I've been here about 5 times.  Can't help it, people always give us gift cards and if I'm in the area, I'm gonna use it here if I'm hungry. They always sit us in the back where the windows are which is the worst place to be. Although it has a nice view, I guess. The waiters always forget about you and it's where they sit the party tables (birthdays and other celebrations). So when the waiters do get there, they usually focus on those tables. On top of that, the service is slow. We never get the good bread. Maybe once it didn't taste like it was sitting around all day. Hurt your gums hard. The food is good. I always have a problem telling the difference between the food at the same chains. So I can only differentiate the service which is bad. So maybe, try not to be like me and just drive 15 minutes further to the Dadeland mall locations. It's much better there, although I find the wait is usually longer."
Vera M.,"Miami, FL",0,35,3,1.0,4/17/2015,"The absolute worst meal service for a large group of thirty. Even though we called ahead for lunch, the kitchen was slow and erratic. Our servers did the best they could to keep the crowd happy but meals came out haphazardly with everyone eating at different times. It took almost 2 1/2 hours to get through a simple lunch without desserts because we ran out of time! Never attempt this place again with a crowd - they can't handle it. Asked for the managers help from the hostess - never saw him!"
Eva J.,"Rancho San Diego, San Diego, CA",76,185,44,4.0,5/18/2012,"Good and predictable.  I was there during the end of the lunch hour, around 2 p.m.  I had the ahi tartare and my mom had the Mexican chicken lettuce tacos.  Both my ahi and her tacos were really good. Our service was great, nothing negative to say about it.   The thing is, the Cheesecake Factory's menu is the same in San Diego or Portland or Miami. . .basically fancied up versions of menu staples, but pretty good nevertheless. Bonus -- when I was eating, Pitbull came in. He was super sweet, took a picture with me, and even gave my mom a huge hug.  I guess that's to be expected in Coconut Grove."
Terrance C.,"Hollywood, FL",4,9,5,4.0,5/3/2014,Came here for lunch and it was yummy! The mac and cheese burger was excellent. My girl had the shrimp scampi and she thought it was delicious! Would definitely come back here !
