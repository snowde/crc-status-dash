Rick G.,"Roseville, CA",0,58,10,3.0,4/15/2014,Good stuff. The usual CF food. Atmosphere: young. Not the safest place at night.
Carrie P.,"Chicago, IL",41,136,1,3.0,10/16/2011,"We had the BEST server possible. First of all, he was incredibly attentive to our table, even though it was a table of two.  The chef accidentally made the wrong dish for me, and the server just gave it to us, as he would throw it away if we didn't take it.  Free meal for later!  He was incredibly prompt and wonderful at making recommendations. That being said, the food itself wasn't anything to write home about.  The pasta dish was priced at about $25, but it is something you would be able to get elsewhere for much cheaper.  The food is loaded with unnecessary butter, for my taste.  It was a good meal, but definitely wasn't worth the $60 bill for two people. The CHEESECAKE is definitely the reason to come here (as the name might indicate).  I have tried the Oreo Cheesecake (awesome), the Red Velvet Cheesecake (phenomenal) and Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple was awe-inspiring.  I love cheesecake.  It is completely worth the stomach ache that comes from over-indulging in rich foods.  Overall, I would say come here for the cheesecake, but get your food elsewhere."
Remy L.,"Miami, FL",3,77,1,3.0,6/22/2011,"Delicious cheesecake. The food is okay but we could go just for the dessert. EDIT: the food is still good over there, although my $25 pastas were somewhat overpriced. The burgers are great and the cheesecakes still delicious. However the service is lower than average in my opinion. Lack of attention, not always ready to help (like last time when my wife had something sticky on her seat which she had to clean by herself while the waitress was watching her.  I'm not sure I'll even bother going back at this point. Some other locations in the Miami area are better."
Phil H.,"CBD, Denver, CO",5,12,38,5.0,12/30/2013,They have the best hibachi steak.  The price is reasonable.  The waitress is courteous and friendly.  The environment is very relaxing.  Definitely will come here again the next time I am in town.
Lourdes W.,"Miami, FL",84,120,,3.0,3/16/2010,"It's a chain, but I like it. I've been coming to this Cheesecake factory since it opened too long ago and I recently left happy. Upside: No wait, food was good and generous portion. Downside: Too much to choose from and no real specialty.  Over the years I've tried just about everything on the menu and it wasn't until I discovered the fried mac and cheese, that made me want to go back. These four little fried balls of cheesy goodness could cure just about any downer. The plate is also covered with a creamy pink pasta sauce.  Every now and then there's a craving for cheesecake, so you hit up the counter, get your slices with whipped cream and you're out the door.  You know exactly what you are going to get when you come here."
Nick M.,"Miami, FL",114,97,28,2.0,1/3/2013,Came here with my better half to eat a quick dinner before catching a movie nearby. I ordered the club sandwich and i have to say i was disappointed with it. The soup that my girl ordered was also nothing to write home about...overall we were not thrilled. Next time I will skip the factory.
Christy P.,"Miami, FL",201,296,86,3.0,8/16/2009,"Visited for late dinner on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised to be seated within 5 minutes - at most!  (my biggest pet peeve at CF's is the wait - so yayy!)  Got a cozy table in the corner, overlooking the Grove.  Server was very attentive - giving us our space to order, but still staying on top of things and not abandoning us.   I love Cheesecake Factory because you can always pick something different from the daunting 398,474 page menu - without getting bored.   Started out with drinks - dirty mojito & factory peach bellini (my fav!!), shared the avocado eggrolls - then ordered my comfort food favorite, grilled cheese, and the boyfriend ordered white chicken chili.  As always, it was tooo much food, but it was great the next day. It would've gotten 4 stars, but my grilled cheese could've had a little more cheese, a little less bread (see my yardhouse grilled cheese review)."
Alexandra B.,"South Miami, FL",182,32,8,3.0,7/19/2012,Love the red velvet cheesecake and great light food menu.
Vita V.,"Toronto, Canada",9,22,2,5.0,8/10/2011,"My fiance and I loved this place! The atmosphere was great! Our server was Nikia, and if I had $100 to give her as a tip, I would! She was so cheerful, knowledgeable and made the experience that much better! We ordered the shrimp scampi and it was deeelish! Will revisit!"
Paul W.,"Miami, FL",876,1200,548,3.0,6/8/2009,"I came here a few Fridays ago with 3 friends to grab dinner. We arrived and were seated within about 5 or 7 minutes. The waitress took our drink orders and brought a few kinds of breads and butter for us to start on while we chatted away and checked out the menu. The odd thing with the drink order was that it took her about 5 minutes to bring the alcoholic beverages, but the person in our group who only ordered a Diet Coke waited at least another 5 mins. more for her non-alcoholic drink to arrive. Hmmm.  The group I was with wanted to order a few appetizers to share. I did warn them about the size of the entrees, but even then I don't think they truly understood how large the portions really are here. They chowed down on the breads that arrived (which were yummy) and then polished off a plate of calamari and some avocado egg rolls (both of which were tasty), but then HOLLLLY S**t!  Here came their main course dishes and needless to say two of them had to take a box home so they could have the rest of their meals the next day for lunch.  In all, the food was good and everyone was happy with everything they ordered. As has always been the case at the Cheesecake Factory, the portions are too large IMO, and I'd rather pay a bit less and have a manageable sized meal rather than feeling like a stuffed pig because I tried to finish everything, or feeling a bit guilty about wasting so much food at the end. The service on this night was OK, but wasn't great. The drink orders took a while to arrive as I mentioned earlier in my review, but also once the food arrived one of my friends wanted to ask for a condiment for her burger. We waited nearly 10 minutes before we even saw our waitress, and only got her because we saw her at another table and managed to flag her down. It also took us a while to get the check and get out of there when we were ready to go.  As far as price, I had 2 drinks, a sandwich and fries and chipped in for the appetizers and I think my total came to something like $25 + tip so not bad at all. Improve the service and make the portions a bit more managable and I'd happily add a star."
J R.,"Miami, FL",19,157,357,4.0,5/27/2012,"Cheesecake Factory restaurants are always good. From the east to the west coast, usually located in malls or nearby malls. This one is located inside a Cocowalk, which has a dance club, comedy club, movie theatre and more. Their best feature for me is happy hour from 4-6pm. Their $5 menu is excellent. Of course the cheesecakes are delicious. Good service - cant go wrong."
Monique P.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/6/2014,"The servers are very dirty and look extremely disgusting, the food is really good they just need to change the color of the uniform, that's a huge turn off for me....not everyone know how to take care of whites...."
Shawn H.,"Miami, FL",35,178,170,1.0,6/21/2011,"My friend once said let's go to cheesecake factory factory for lunch. When I replied that their food sucks, he said ""but they give you a lot"". I think that sums it up. Large portions of bland food. I always joke around that flavor isn't included with your food here. I mean where do they genetically manufacture their flavorless ingredients? Even pungent ingredients like garlic and capers have no flavor at this establishment. And every dish comes loaded with tons of oil or heavy cream or both and still no flavor. Anyway, the service is always good and if you have a large group to cater to I still wouldn't rule out a visit. Like when my not very food centric friend brought his entire family from TN. I knew everybody would find something they would eat."
Carl C.,"Miami, FL",29,13,,5.0,7/2/2012,Great food and excellent service.  I would definitely recommend this cheesecake factory.  It's not as crazy busy as the other cheesecake factory restaurants in south florida.  Just be ready for large portions of food!!   You definitely get your money's worth!!
Todd H.,"Taylors, SC",0,9,,4.0,11/6/2012,"I am fan of the cheesecake factory and this one is not exception. I was a little skeptical because we arrived so close to closing but they didn't disappoint. The food was delicious. Definatelly order the avocado eggrolls for an appetizer. This particular location is difficult to find. You can see it, but getting to it is an adventure."
Trena B.,"Washington, DC",7,70,6,2.0,3/31/2009,"So I finally went to a Cheesecake Factory.  I have unofficially boycotted it on principle, but I was on vacation with my sister and she reeally wanted their cheesecake.  We had only dessert, a chocolate raspberry cheesecake of some kind. I had always assumed that the signature dish at this place would at least be edible.  I assumed wrong. If you can put aside the idea that you're (allegedly) eating cheesecake and view it as merely an oversweetened, indeterminate paste and said paste appeals to you, you're good to go.  if you would actually like to enjoy the savory/sweet meld of an actual cheesecake with just enough firmness to bite into, keep moving."
skot s.,"Miami, FL",0,56,,1.0,2/4/2015,"Soda machine broken, michael our waiter explained to us that all they have is some old bottles they store in the basement  to serve us tonight.   Coke was flat from age.  Manager came over to us to explain the problem.  He said he sent a employee to super market to purchase some new bottles of coke for the restaurant.   Explained the equipment is old and third time it broke down, but tonight looks like it is finished for good.  No soda drinks for next hour of our meal.  I realize you are wondering why I am making such a problem about not getting any soda.  But this problem was realized earlier in the day by the manager on duty.  NOTHING was done until dinner time, maybe he should have figured that many people are going to order some kind of soda with there dinner tonight, and should have the fore sight to do something!!!  Instead his thoughts were to bad so sad.   Time to replace this looser with someone who is trained by the Cheesecake Factory staff in running a major chain restaurant in Miami.  Looking at the other YELP reviews looks like time for some big changes at one of the oldest cheesecake restaurants. Nov. 11 2016 Now the latest.  We had two new problems.  First long hair in sunday brunch eggs, second on another visit the shrimp and angel hair the shrimp were bad. The mgr. Louis both times was made aware.  First time he did something.  Second time he said the shrimp comes into his restaurant frozen and shelf life is short.  He did nothing about the problem.  To top it off, today is Veterans day, I am a proud Army Vet and they are not even  going to give me a piece of pie !   Cheesecake really sucks !!   Sorry......."
Michelle S.,"Miami, FL",11,214,1,2.0,3/17/2011,"I'm not impressed by a huge selection on a menu or by large portions of food. Quantity and not quality us what cheesecake lives by and I've been disappointed again and again. The first time I ate at the grove location I ordered some chicken platter that was oversauced to the point that I was repulsed by my meal. The last time I came I ordered a tuna salad which I asked to have dressing on the side for and received it drenched in dressing, along with a dressing in the side.  The tuna itself was tasty but not worth the price. Not a fan of cheesecake."
Miami R.,"Miami, FL",116,77,32,3.0,12/5/2010,"I am giving the cheesecake factory a 3 star, because I've had good experiences at many locations. However, this latest visit deserves a 1 star. But, since I don't believe in destroying anyone's rating over one bad experience, they get the 3 star, and again, that's just because, on the whole, collectively, that what they'd deserve. We were in the grove and went for the old stand by of cheesecake factory. it was lunch time and there was no wait, we walked in, the hostess looked up and passed us off to the other host and we were sat right away.  Our server was one of those guys who's been there a while, he wears too much cologne, which I noticed one other time when we were there. He's pretty regular with his routine. He suggested the special, was animated as he did it. He kept up with our refills and the food came out pretty quickly.  From where we were sitting, we could see the host stand and what really got under my skin, was the female hostess. She was constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY on her cell phone texting. she had it in a drawer and would pull the drawer our and think she was being slick by reading and texting from there. She looked around all the time as not to get busted by a boss but it was the entire time we were there. She was also dressed a little inappropriately. She was a short, semi larger girl, which is absolutely fine (I'm not judging that at all) however, she was wearing jeans that were too tight (you know, someone who should not be wearing the skinny jeans) so, she had that muffin top, and her shirt was too snug and would ride up so you would constantly see black jeans, black top and bright muffin top. Couple that in with the fact that she was on her phone the entire time and it really started to effect my experience there. Since I've eaten there, I just chalk it up to the work pool we have to choose from down here in Miami. So I know cheesecake is better than that. However, if this were someone's first time, it would make for an AWFUL first impression.  Moving on from the hostess. I got a newer dish they were trying that was on a separate menu. Shrimp New Orleans. Let's just say, I hope this one does not end up on the regular menu.  the portion size was ok, but, it's not that great. what made it worse was, the rice was overcooked. I finished the rest of the dish but left a large portion of the rice behind. When the server came by to ask how everything was. I told him to let the kitchen manager know that the rice was overcooked and he might want to have them make a new batch of rice for the rest of the dishes. I told him, I didn't want anymore rice and that I didn't want anything done about my meal, I was just giving them a heads up. He brought me out another plate of the just the rice, but, it was the same overcooked rice I had mentioned lol. So, not I left behind the rice from my main dish, and the entire plate of overcooked rice he brought me.  So, this was not the greatest experience I've had at a cheesecake factory, but, like I said in the beginning, I've had plenty of very good experiences, so this won't stop me from going back. I just hope that the managers catch these details and fix them so that this doesn't become the norm. They've been around too long doing a great job to let these things drag them down. So, to recap: less cologne on the server better fitting clothes on the hostess not having the hostess text while working don't overcook the rice I'll be back again I know, be it the grove or aventura or wherever."
Brandon J.,"Miami, FL",70,18,52,4.0,7/10/2011,Cheesecake factory is a classic must have. I always get the spicy cashew chicken! But tonight we got a bunch of appetizers and it was more food than the wife n I could handle...always a good thing. Cheesecake in Cocowalk is definitely one of my favorites. Service was excellent.
