Monica R.,"Orlando, FL",113,8,4,3.0,7/2/2011,"I always seem to be content with the food at CF. I wouldn't say it's anything to write home to your momma about, but it does the job. I will say that I do get overwhelmed with their menu... way too much to choose from! I had the Chicken Croquettes this past time and they were incredible! Their food and drink happy hour is a pretty good deal."
scott s.,"Washington, DC",6,167,,3.0,3/29/2010,"it's a cheesecake factory.  it's not haute cuisine, but it's still yummy. i highly recommend getting their house red.  it's from the mondavis and i can't remember for the life of me what it was called, but apparently it's a vintage that's only distributed to the cheesecake factory.  IT WAS YUMMY!  go to the cheesecake factory just for the wine!"
Analys C.,"Miami, FL",106,48,10,2.0,9/3/2012,"I came here to have dinner with my sister. The waiter was nice but he had NO idea what was going on in the menu. Every time asked him about a certain plate his answer would be like ""I don't know because I dont eat Tuna"" or ""I don't eat that either"". Those were his answers. Wow. I wish he would have lied to me. I am very far from being a difficult customer, really... I dont expect the waiters to like everything on the menu or to give me their personal opinion on plates, that's always nice indeed, but at least be ready to give me a little description on what i'm inquiring about. He ended up just bringing the manager to my table who pretty much ended up being our waiter. He was very nice and suggested me something after describing it in detail. Once my food arrived, it was completely different from what me and him had discussed. I was starving, so I just sucked it up and ate it. The manager did come to check on  me, I explained to him my disappointment, he offered and insisted that I get a new plate, the one he had described, but I declined his offer because I was almost done with my food and had a movie to catch. So he said he would take it off my check, although I thanked him and insisted for him to not do that because I ate my food after all, he still did it. So I did appreciate that... but their waiters need to step their game up!"
Fran S.,"Miami, FL",12,119,,3.0,8/9/2010,It's okaaayyy.  The establishment looked pretty nice for a chain restaurant.  Their girly drinks were off the chain tho!
La C.,"San Francisco, CA",82,1052,45,2.0,2/22/2009,"This place was a big mistake.  On our first trip to Miami we decided to check out the Coconut Grove outdoor mall.  We were hungry and went into the Cheesecake factory and were pleasantly greeted by the wonderful cold a/c.  The service and food were blah, I remember the waitress bringing us the wrong drinks.  I've dine at another cheesecake factory and found the food was not as good.  We were dusted and disgusted that we didn't even have any dessert.  Now I know better, stay away from the tourist traps..."
Li S.,"Irvine, CA",7,182,104,5.0,1/7/2012,Had New Year's Eve Count Down. Complimentary toast and party pack. Happy 2012!
L.J. H.,"Miami, FL",1,46,2,3.0,8/21/2012,"I only came for drinks, appetizer and dessert. The service was blah, but it is a chain restaurant so what did I expect? I ordered crab cakes for my choice of appetizer and they were OK. They are deep fried, I prefer my crab cakes lightly fried or seared crisp. 3 came on my plate and I ate 1 1/2, they are quite thick, though. My Moscato was perfectly chilled and fizzy. My favorite was the dessert, my date LOVED my choice, the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's just delicious."
Justin P.,"Parkland, FL",98,196,7,2.0,11/10/2008,"Mediocre food, but they attempt to compensate with oversized portions.  I don't want large portions of bad food.  In fact, I would even prefer unreasonably small portions of good food.  Of course, large portions of good food would be ideal, but then they would probably get kicked out of the Cheesecake Factory chain, and I wouldn't want anyone to lose their job."
Dee P.,"Hialeah, FL",0,2,,1.0,5/12/2012,Rude service - Joe Canton in particular insulting. 25 minutes waiting for the waiter to take the order. 50 minutes for the overly well done hamburger and the chicken less Navajo to arrive. - top it off with a mgr Joe Canton who insults you even though you are not being disrespectful. Would not recommend this location. I wish I could give zero stars.
Kameelah R.,"San Francisco, CA",104,150,9,2.0,6/15/2008,Please don't waste your money here. the Steak Diane and The Fried Shrimp Scampi are pretty bad and everything takes forever. You can get crappy food just about anywhere so save yourself some money.
