Mark D.,"Miami, FL",23,259,571,4.0,12/27/2015,"Well I don't normally review the big chains because, basically, you already know them and have drawn your own conclusions. However, I think since employees at one location can really make a difference I am reviewing the Coconut Grove Cheesecake Factory. We were cheerfully greeted and seated immediately. The house manager, Siobhan, was delightful. She checked on us several times to make sure everything was alright. Our server was Marvin. Some adjectives to describe him are attentive, conversant, witty, and professional. These 2 individuals rate 5+ stars. The food this day, however, was somewhat hit and miss, not of the calibre of previous Cheesecake experiences. The Mac'n Cheese balls were great. The artichoke n'crab dip was fantastic. However, they provided an insufficient amount of crackers to dip with. Quick-thinking Marvin brought some fresh warm tortilla chips, but it wasn't quite the same. The DaVinci pasta was good but had a meager amount of chicken. The eggplant parm/pasta, and the garlic smashed potatoes were standard fare good. The Shrimp Scampi was on point awesome, however the accompanying steak Diane was somewhat over cooked, dry and a little tough. I conveyed my thoughts about the food to Siobhan, and she graciously accepted the ""constructive criticism"". Of course the cheesecake, in this case the ""Tuxedo"" was decadently delicious. Overall it was a 3 star food day on this visit but the above and beyond attitudes of Siobhan and Marvin kicked it up to like a 4.25 star experience."
Whitney F.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,6,,4.0,3/13/2017,"I went to eat here with my boyfriend and the experience was over all good! We tried the fried mac & cheese and it was good, maybe a little bit too much for my taste, I was full already! I also got chicken terayaki with rice, the chicken was delicious! But the rice wasn't the best one I  ate. My boyfriend's drink was with a very little amount of alcohol but our server fixed it and added more. The service was very good, the bill not too expensive!"
Dunieski P.,"Miami, FL",70,73,248,5.0,7/31/2016,The menu is spectacular and the atmosphere of the restaurant and the decoration grate they have a nice and fast service . The best of the menu is the sea salted caramel cheesecake  . Amazing.
Brandii W.,"Gig Harbor, WA",49,64,48,4.0,8/31/2014,"Apparently the best time to come to this location wit out a long wait time is after 10 pm. I walked right up to the bar area and took a seat. The bartender came up and offered a drink right away. They were very attentive. I ordered a glass of house merlot, and buffalo blast (I haven't had them in years since I left Florida). My wine came in no time, the food too about 10 minutes. My food came out before the complimentary bread (white and pumpernickel). A few of my blasts were a little burned, but there were about 10 of them so the 1 or 2 was no big deal. I had plenty left to take home. I also ordered an oreo cheesecake to go. Pure heaven! It tastes as delicious as I remember.  I'll be back here the next time I'm in town."
Molly G.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",12,90,39,5.0,6/13/2016,"I just LOVE the food here! And I am a very fussy eater. There are so many things  that I can't eat that I have to ask ALOT of questions so I am sure that I don't get sick from the food. Not only do they always get my order right, but they seem happy to accommodate me! I also like that my grandkids are happy with the food! An all over great place! LOVE the location too!"
Bill D.,"Miami, FL",59,14,2,5.0,1/1/2016,Fabulous bar service!!! Food is good and the ambient mood Is awesome. Always a great standby for the Grove!!
Juan S.,"Miami, FL",89,1406,31,4.0,10/11/2015,"Still packing them in after all these years... And it's easy to see why...Big portions, quality food, reasonable prices and friendly service.  Menus also don't get much bigger than CF....they have everything! Minus one star for getting rid of the Salmon Genovese...that was my favorite thing!  Bring it back!!!"
Rolanda B.,"Miami Gardens, FL",220,48,79,5.0,11/8/2015,Love it my server was Patrick and as usual the food was the bomb. Cheese cake give tons of food so if your hungry or want to save some for leftovers then this is the place to try. I had the Cuban crispy rolls as an appetizer and the shrimp with angel hair pasta.. Also a Mai tai to drink
Lindsay B.,"Lighthouse Point, FL",475,189,336,1.0,3/24/2014,"Service here was absolutely terrible. Our server Angela was incredibly rude and unhelpful. Laughed and rolled her eyes at me when I asked her questions about the drink list. Food took extremely long. She didn't check on us at all. Also, I accidentally dropped a pepper shaker and she told me I must have had to many martinis(I had two and they were WEAK). Worst customer service I've ever had. I feel like I got discriminated against because I came in in casual gym attire...little did she know we would have been her best table... She's lucky she even got a tip whatsoever, I'm just a polite diner so I don't do things like that. Never coming back."
Samantha M.,"Queensbury, NY",13,15,10,1.0,2/17/2016,I never would review a chain restaurant but this was awful food was typical of what you expect but the service was horrendous! They were screaming  across tables. Ignoring other tables. Never going to this location again. Lesson learned
Emma B.,"Doral, FL",71,148,130,5.0,2/14/2016,"I was in love with their menu. The first one i tried was the steak with vegetable. It is incredible . The taste and smell was so delicious. Their desert cheese cake was so good and traditional. I highly recommended this place to everyone want to enjoy their weekend with delicious food at a nice restaurant. Price was not expensive, but not cheap"
Natasha N.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,9,1,1.0,12/30/2014,"I am a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location was a huge let down and waste of money. I also want to mention that I have serving and hosting experience. During each grievance my party was more than polite.  First off, the hostess seated us in back room by the windows, which was disgustingly hot and packed! Everyone looked like packed sardines! She squeezed us at a table where in order to pull my chair out to sit, I had to hit the customers seat behind me. It was so loud I had to yell at my partner sitting across from me! We asked to be seated in the front part of the restaurant where there was plenty of room!! I cannot fathom the rational of trying to seat customers in a noisy, sticky back room when there is ample space in the front of house. There are too many tables in that back room, none of the customers were seated comfortably.  Service was mediocre at best. I ordered a Cobb salad and asked them to replace the bleu cheese with mozzarella. When my salad came out, the lettuce was tired looking and wet. It also had bleu cheese, no mozzarella. The waitress apologized and took it back to the kitchen. When it came back out it had no cheese at all, and no chicken anymore! They clearly just scraped the top portion of the salad off and didn't bother replacing the correct toppings. The kitchen should not be so lazy but our waitress did not even bother checking to make sure the order was correct. I didn't bother sending it back because clearly this staff was incompetent. Once is acceptable but if a customer has to ask you to DO YOUR JOB twice, that's excessive. To date, this was the worst cheesecake experience I have ever had. It is such a shame because it is in a prime location. I rate this restaurant one star because zero is not an option."
Angelina Q.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2016,Bartender too busy washing dishes to take my food order at the bar  Shitty service and manager has attitude issues.
Melanie U.,"Miami, FL",44,220,176,4.0,3/30/2015,I visited this cheesecake location for the first time for a late lunch and I really enjoyed it. Great food as always and great and quick service. I had a lunch pizza and salad which was fresh and very nice. My boyfriend ordered a California Cheese steak sandwich which was very flavorful and well made. Beautiful little location in Coconut Grove
Melissa R.,"Miami, FL",11,38,16,4.0,12/14/2014,Manager addressed any issues we had even though they were small which impressed my husband and I that he went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of.
C B.,"Miami, FL",30,3,3,4.0,8/16/2015,Dinner party of 12 here. Wait time was no less than 15 minutes on a Friday night. The waitress Deborah was very patient with us! The food was HOT and FRESH! The kids couldn't stop talking about the cheesecake! I would definitely come back to this location! Minus the kids... Lol!
Brad A.,"Acworth, GA",0,5,,2.0,7/18/2015,"Poor service server name is Maria c  Greek salad was not good and not exactly a Greek salad.  Server dosent tend to the table well we sat needing water items and help for long amounts of time. Had to ask multiple times for the cheesecake menu. Got up and got our menus ourselves.  Cheesecake was on a warm/hot plate????  Unless your just in need of a fix for cheese cake save yourself time,money and stress and go someplace else to eat."
Megan B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,67,2,4.0,2/15/2016,Got seated within 3 minutes even though we were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. The food is typical of cheesecake factory.  Have been to this location about 10 times and the food and service is always consistent.
Frank S.,"Tarrytown, NY",2,92,23,5.0,1/3/2016,"We came here for dessert only with family friends after nice dinner at Jaguar, Peruvian restaurant in coconut grove. Cheesecakes were great, especially chocolate mousse cheesecake was yummy! It is a busy place but service is friendly and fast. We were happy!"
Yesi Q.,"Miami, FL",84,35,9,1.0,1/4/2016,We have been to the location in Las Olas in Ft. Lauderdale. The first person we saw was the hostess which was so rude. She didn't greet anyone! She looked so angry to be there.  We had a party of 5 for someone birthday. Someone ordered the fajita tacos. They look good but they tasted bad. We asked the waitress if we could change tof the spaghetti and meatballs. She was like ummmmm I don't know. Hello you can make me pay for something that I don't like! After that she was rude. Once we were don't eating. We ask to sing happy birthday! They took so long we had to call her. We are really patient people. I use to be a waitress so I know how busy and that u may forget. But she walked past us so many times. I will never be going back to this location again!
