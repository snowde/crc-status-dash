Natalie M.,"Ferndale, WA",218,47,103,4.0,5/12/2015,"I have been going to Cheesecake Factory for years almost all my experiences are close to perfect. Therefore, my overall rating is based on all the years I've been going, not today's incident with the server. Today, I came for the Happy Hour (ends at 6PM by the way). I ordered the delicious Tamale that is $5.50 during the Happy Hour which is HUGE and perfect for sharing. In addition, we also shared the herb crusted salmon that also brings shrimp. Both of the entrees are perfect for sharing. I enjoy coming here because service is relatively quick, food is fresh, and clean. Although, service today at the bar sucked! I constantly had to call the server over for water or anything we needed. The server was very connected to his phone, talking with other co workers, and watching the TV. Other than that, my experience here is usually excellent."
ivan l.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,3.0,6/11/2016,The grill pork chop looks good but so dry.  Very bad cooking.  Never try again.  Should be two stars only but the system don't post it as review.
Michelle W.,"Miami, FL",0,8,,3.0,2/21/2015,"So we typically order to go and the quality of the food and service is GREAT!  No complaints. We did visit once and dined in.  I wasn't impressed with the service, our waiter seemed to be unenthusiastic and irritated.  Also we were seated in the back and the seating is extremely tight.  It was like dining with another couple who was seated next to us, well in this case, they were seated with us (that's how close the tables were).   I think we'll just go back to the normal routine of placing our orders to-go."
Israel P.,"Miami, FL",87,68,68,2.0,5/3/2015,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Parking is a problem, service is a problem. They are also bad at to go orders and catering. I have not had them to get an order right yet."
Debbie M.,"Hollywood, FL",4,25,47,1.0,2/16/2014,We went to this restaurant after the art festival closed. Every other restaurant in town had a really long wait and this one didn't. There is a good reason for that. We were seated within ten minutes. The tables were only about ten inches apart and it was very difficult to squeeze through to sit down.  We have always loved the cheesecake factory but this was our first trip to this location. The four cheese pasta was extremely salty and I couldn't even eat it. The waitress never asked why I didn't eat my meal. We both ordered cheesecake and one piece came out twice as big as the other. For a $60 meal this was a big disappointment.
Mansour S.,"Miami Beach, FL",20,51,9,5.0,10/12/2015,Went there with my family. what an experience they loved the place. the food is untouchable as well as the portions. the server was friendly and the place so clean. for sure its a place we will go back to visit. and the cheesecake well best ever.
Bernard R.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,4.0,4/24/2015,"I came severals time in this restaurant. Food good, i love the kobe burger... Only one problem: you need to wait all the time.... Fresh products and tasty."
Dr. Mario O. L.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,28,78,4.0,2/8/2016,"Oops I've dropped one of the stars....How could I?   After many years of absence we went with my son Gian Luca to visit this great eatery in one of the most charming little malls of the USA: Coco Walk. We have always had good experiences with the food and staff right from the start. Except yesterday. Mrs. Viviana, the lady that served our table, was apparently in the last half an hour of her shift and took short shrift of our custoner needs. First of all she did not greet us properly to make us feel welcomed. Second she pushed us to order when we were still reviewing a menu we were no longer familar with. Maybe she doesn' t know that the modern concept of a restaurant was born after the French Revolution guillotened thousands of noblemen and left their domestic help unemployed. They went to the Paris city centre to open businesses  with separate tables and a written menu. No more long shared tables and voiced menus for clients like you can see in ""The Prancing Pony"" of ""Lord of the Rings Part I"". Is she still living under the 'Ancien Regime'? Her abuse did not stop there. She did not bring us water or bread right away; she dropped my bottle of beer without pouring some of it as a courtesy. The worst came when we ordered. We have always enjoyed their pasta and seafood dishes with real Parmesan cheese grated over them. We asked for the ""Shrimp and Angel Hair pasta"" with a caveat. Extra shrimp for my son and extra squid for moi.. We were very hungry. ""We don't have that. Shrimp is the only seafood here."" she said grumpily. ""Excuse me,"" I said, ""you do have squid because I saw a dish of 'calamari' in the menu.""  ""Oh, sorry, I don't speak Italian,"" she said, sniggering."" I took a long hard look at her. ""But we do so don't try to BS us!""    After an uncomfortable impassse, Mrs. Siobhan McMahan, the manager, came to our table to sort things out. She explained that they could not sautee the squid so I settled for double Shrimp. We did some small talk and all was well. Fortunately that ogre of a woman finished her shift and a knockout young black girl called Courtney continued serving us. She was everything the other wasn't: polite, attentive and efficient.  When I told her that I was going to Yelp my visit, she smiled.  ""You' d better give me the best qualification or I'll spank you!"" she said.                                                                      ""With a wet towel?"" I asked.                                                      ""Absolutely."" she said, wagging a finger.                                                                             I'm going back soon to get my comeuppance.               The kind of sacrifices I have to endure for Yelp."
Silvia C.,"Hialeah, FL",2,57,35,3.0,7/26/2015,"This location is EXTRA busy ALWAYS. The service is not the best at all, there is always very long waits even when there isnt large parties around. It can get very loud inside since they do not have any outside seating. But food is tasty & you can take a walk or shop after your meal."
Phyllis D.,"Atlanta, GA",73,17,3,1.0,7/17/2015,"This is the worst ever Cheesecake Factory ever! From the decor is very dated, the service is horrible and the food did not taste like Cheesecake Factory food usually tastes. The bread was cold. i asked for oil & vinegar, the waiter, Peter said he didn't know where ""it"" was at the time! He had to find the 1 and only bottle of oil, which did not even taste like olive oil. Worst Cheesecake Factory ever! This place gives the CheeseCake Factory a bad name"
May D.,"East Northport, NY",0,8,2,4.0,6/21/2015,Is a nice place to have lunch or dinner...food is really good ...I love the blueberry mojito!!! The place is clean and the service is good...I dont give them 5 because sometimes they take too long to bring the appetizers..I would go back again .
Daylen D.,"Miami, FL",0,20,2,1.0,7/12/2015,"Let me start off by saying that I love the cheesecakes from the Cheesecake Factory. I think they're delicious! However, the 2 times I have been to this location in Coconut Grove, the experience has been horrible. Dirty utensils with pieces of food in them, cold bread (both times I've visited) and, old tasting cheesecake and terrible service, the second time I visited. The second visit was the one that led me to write this review. Our waiter didn't introduce himself, brought the tab while we were still eating, and took the change as tip without me even giving it to him! He never brought back the change. I had to ask for it! I tip for good service, but I don't like the tip being TAKEN without me giving it and even less when his service was awful to begin with. Overall, a terrible experience!!! Not sure I'll be coming back any time soon."
Luis G.,"Miami, FL",35,20,6,1.0,12/8/2014,"Sorry to say but this one in coconut grove is a must pass the food is not to the standard of other Chesecake , and we order the crab cake was a joke 3 bitesize cakes wos the worst they put to large cups with tartar it look horrible very disappointing not to mention 13.00 dollars for that plate , they should consider closing this place gives a bad name to the restaurant. .. felt they stold 75.00 for a horrible meal.."
Adalberto M.,"Miami, FL",586,330,158,4.0,3/8/2012,"Brace yourself for some large plates! It's Cheesecake Factory. An Italian chain that is somewhat upscale in comparison to the rest, but casual enough to feel comfortable.  If you're headed this way on a weekend, make reservations or get comfortable at the bar because you're going to wait. On that note, they make really good long island ice teas, and their ""well-mannered dirty martini"" is great. Ask for blue cheese olives.  Any of their pasta dishes are decent. My favorite is the Louisiana Pasta with breaded shrimp or the Cajun Chicken pasta. Both have a little bit of a kick. The portion is huge, so you can definitely share. Not too hungry? Get their small plates, cheap and pretty good! Dessert? Helloooooo Cheesecake! During the holidays they have a pumpkin pecan one, which is my favorite. But ANY of them do just fine."
Alison M.,"Washington, DC",302,743,20,3.0,12/29/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what else is there to say. Who hasn't been there? The cheesecakes are delicious and fattening, the portions are huge the Chinese chicken salad is my absolute fave. I also love the fact that they have a new new healthy/ lite menu (I forget what it's called.)  However, this cheesecake factory is not the best. Service and the food at this one is not up to par. They messed up our order and served my bf a a turkey burger that fell apart on him. The manager was no help and basically admitted that they have a bad recipe for it. They add a filler to it so all the turkey burgers fall apart.. so why is it on the menu? It was weird, but as I said before its the Cheesecake Factory so I'm gonna come back."
Alisha H.,"Rutherford, NJ",3,87,19,3.0,12/23/2015,"The cheesecake factory never disappoints on food, the service at this location however was lacking.  They changed waiters in the middle of our meal and didn't tell us so the order all of a sudden became very complicated, and we were only 3 people.  Overall the cheesecake always wins hands down, and being from New York that's a huge compliment."
Carmen V.,"Silver Bluff, Miami, FL",3,2,7,4.0,9/1/2013,"Came for a late dinner and we didn't have to wait, we were seated right away. The atmosphere, the food and service were really good. Brian(waiter) was very helpful and knowledgable about the food choices. We had the Hibachi Steak and Diané Steak with mashed potato and they were extremely tasty. The sauce amount and the meat were just right. If you like juicy steaks I highly recommend you to come and try these. Btw the pomegranate mojito was spectacular too. We had overall a great experience, no waiting, great service, good food, what else can we ask for?"
Linda M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",3,18,8,5.0,2/14/2015,"OMG!! So yummy! I got the Kaboom! A veggie sandwich and hubby got the Blammo! A roast beef sandwich. His bread was a little soggy from the au jus, but overall tasted good. This place is great! Very fresh and a very good value."
Enri G.,"Cutler Bay, FL",6,80,84,1.0,10/19/2014,Most kid / stroller unfriendly restaurant I have ever been..... I have been to other cheese cake factories that are similarly un friendly with strollers but wow this one is the top....
Mike J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,2,5,5.0,10/16/2014,"Visited the Cheesecake Factory in the Grove on Sunday afternoon and had a great experience.  Hard to believe the place has been there for over 20 years and is cleaner and better than the early days.  There was a wait and even though I was with two small kids we were treated kindly and given a table large enough to accommodate us.  We were greeted immediately and I don't remember the gentleman's name but he was friendly and knowledgeable.  We ordered two apps which were tasty and came out quickly and steaming hot!  My four year old loved the mac n cheese balls!  My wife and I each got tacos, which were fresh and delicious.  The only negative thing I can say is that the portions are huge!  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  We live in Broward and don't get to the Grove often, but I certainly recommend the Cheesecake Factory to anyone going to Coconut Grove."
