Emily R.,"Germantown, TN",40,253,623,4.0,12/6/2014,We all loved our meal. I had the factory meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn. It was indeed the comfort food I was craving. It was well seasoned and well prepared. My husband enjoyed his chicken Madeira with sautéed spinach. He are every bite. My daughter had the chicken Romano and she was very happy with her dish. The server was attentive and very friendly.
Green L.,"Homestead, FL",1,117,,5.0,3/4/2015,"I freakin love the food at this place. The fried mac and cheese is really good, its an appetizer thats eats like an entrée. Tiramisu cheesecake, yummy in my tummy lol....."
Cece L.,"Paris, France",0,7,,5.0,2/28/2015,I love this restaurant. They propose a good variety of food. I love their mashed potatoes!  And theirs cheescakes are amazing!!!! I will come back ! You will not be disappointed. Also the staff are very kind.
Carrie R.,"Melbourne, FL",127,84,20,3.0,7/23/2013,"You may have been taken here on a date when you were in high school thinking you had made it into official adulthood and overlooked the gaudy decor because, hey,  you were big time now. But come here as an adult and your kind of wondering why a place called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" is fashioned as though it was erected from ancient ruins.  Any how, the food is a typical hodgepodge of everything and the kitchen sink and the portions are almost certainly not meant for normal consumption during one sitting. So fortunately if you care about your calorie intake there is a ""Skinnylicious"" menu that helps navigate you through what should be a normal serving size (though it will look minuscule if you glance at the indulgent family that is surely stuffing their faces in a booth near by). In a nutshell, service is efficient and the food is predictable- the ""skinnylicious"" menu is not bad- the fiance and I shared a pear and blue cheese flatbread which was pretty delicious, the sweet pear was balanced by the sharp and salty blue cheese. I ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich with a side salad and it was ok, not out of this world but not guilt inducing. My fiance ordered the turkey burger with the same side salad and no complaints were made. Overall it wasn't bad but not enough to make us rush back- we did have a $50 gift certificate so that made it more worth our while."
Marylin T.,"Steilacoom, WA",91,110,132,4.0,4/28/2011,I love eating at the bar not because I order drinks but becaus the bartenders make me feel welcomed even though I just order food. Love the four cheese pasta and the southwestern salad with extra dressing yum! Lots of colorful clients maybe found there and if you get lucky they might just grab you and kiss your head. Ewww funny but it did happen to me.
Sergio F.,"Miami, FL",766,1259,5145,4.0,11/15/2010,"I came by last night for a friend's birthday. We had done the Art Walk Saturday and wanted a break from the usual Design District and beach haunts. Besides, the Grove is an old standby and perfect for Sunday going-outs as its not packed.  Seating was a 20 minute wait, which is fairly typical when I go to Cheesecake but at least we had time to walk around window shop. Our waiter found us a cozy inside table (perfect for a birthday dinner). Wine (chardonnay) was cold and crisp, and promptly served.  The brown bread was awesome..I could come here just for the bread!  My dinner consisted of a HUGE portion of a pasta and chicken. The ""tomato"" seemed a mix of fresh tomatoes supplemented with marinara sauce but tasty nonetheless. There could have been chicken pieces but I won't complain too much compared to other restaurants. Where CFS Grove shone in my opinion was in the dessert and service department. Since the portion was too large for a single seating they actually put it in the takeout box for birthday girl and myself! This was a pleasant surprise as most restaurants usually just give you the box and expect for you to pack it yourself. Their 30th Anniversary cheesecake was monumental! I'm not a chocolate fan (yes there are such people) but this one made me a convert with its balance of softness and richness. I also liked the presentation with the candle, sprinkles and writing Happy Birthday with syrup on the plate :) They didn't charge a mandatory tip but I was glad to because the service was awesome!"
Olga Z.,"Dania Beach, FL",85,147,179,3.0,12/30/2012,"Did you know Cheesecake offers Happy Hour and has been for about a couple of years now? I surely didn't. Never thought of Cheesecake as a Happy Hour type of place, until recently.   Happy Hour is from 4pm - 6pm, Monday thru Friday.  The menu includes $5 cocktails (margarita, cosmo, mojito, etc.) some well drinks and some wines by the glass.  The Happy Hour food menu also offers FULL-SIZE portions (hot spinach/cheese dip, crispy wontons, avocado eggrolls, sliders, fried mac & cheese, sweet corn, tamales, fried calamari, etc.) for $5! We shared the FULL-SIZE, delicious tamales and ordered perfect (not watered-down) mojitos and cosmos. Worth checking-out if you happen to already enjoy their food and customer service."
Christopher L.,"Miami, FL",0,36,2,2.0,2/11/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain, and this restaurant has chain restaurant food.  It also needs a rehab, as it has a beaten up vibe from years of use.  The food is plentiful but tasteless.  I had a Margarita for $10 and it was poor.   There a lot of good restaurants in Coconut Grove.  This is not one of them.  Boring and banal."
Jazz J.,"North Miami, FL",19,103,40,3.0,11/8/2014,"Another place that my coworkers love. Large menu and hit or miss with the waiters /waitresses. I have tried many items on the menu, but really don't have a favorite. I can say I love the appetizer fried mac and cheese I get them every time I go. Overall it's just ok 2 me. I more than likely will return especially when overruled by my coworkers."
Andy K.,"Miami, FL",5,8,7,4.0,11/8/2014,I always love their Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Baked Potato Soup. I see all these other negative reviews and just don't understand. Cheesecake is a pretty general restaurant for any occasion.
Rob R.,"Calgary, Canada",1,24,,3.0,2/18/2015,This place is okay. not great. Pasta was subpar. Couldn't care less to come back
Jennifer C.,"Colchester, VT",2,7,13,3.0,11/24/2014,"This definitely wasn't my favorite Cheesecake Factory location. In fact, this was probably the worst I've ever been to. It was small and cramped and the service was very slow. We went on a Saturday night, so we expected a wait. However, they told us 15 minutes, which turned into 45+. Once seated, our waiter was polite, but forgetful and superrrrr slow. We had to ask for bread to be brought out twice before it was. That said, the food was delicious as always.... when we finally got it."
Sean H.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,267,4,4.0,6/4/2013,"Strangely enough, this is the only Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to, and I'm not even from South Florida. I recently returned for my second visit on a rainy Friday afternoon. After a pretty ridiculously long wait, we were seated near a window, giving us a good view of the cute Grove shopping area down below. As usual, the menu was overwhelmingly massive, and the food was good and generously portioned. I failed, yet again, to finish my whole meal.  Cheesecake Factory isn't gourmet food by any means, but if you're in the market to get very full for not much money, it fits the bill quite nicely."
Laure M.,"Paris, France",158,476,201,3.0,4/29/2011,"Went there for dinner last night. The menu is too long, too many options it's too hard to find what to eat :) or it is for me. They give you bread (sourdough and cereal bread). Our waiter was nice, attentive, filled the waters etc... I got the chicken salad sandwich with a green salad and ranch. The sandwich is huge, so the salad on the side is enough, almost unnecessary because it's very small so get the fries if you are hungry. The bread is a thick buttery white toast, toasted in butter (well toasted in butter). It's crispy, it's good but your fingers will get a bit greasy. I liked the roasted almonds in the sandwich. I was hesitating with the chicken quesadilla but I get that everywhere all the time so I opted for the chicken salad sandwich. I think the quesadilla would have been a better choice because it's cheesy!! The sandwich was good though but I don't think I'll get it again. My husband got the fish & chips and was very happy. It is served with fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce. It's big. The fish fingers are very chunky and the batter looked very good. The fries looked crispy and good.  We decided to indulge and share a slice of the original cheesecake. The cheesecake menu is huge, 2 pages, and the slices are massive. However for the original, the size is totally normal and manageable. Overall it was good. Too bad they don't offer outside seatings. Too many options but it's good if you don't know what to eat and are very hungry!"
Shanene W.,"Miami, FL",29,26,7,4.0,3/12/2013,It's not what it used to be. Pros: great variety.  I recommend the dynamite shrimp and firecracker salmon as appetizers.  Cons: they push the tables together too tight. If you ate unfortunate to sit at a table and a large person is seated next to you be prepared to have their thighs or elbows running against you. Not cool.
Fern B.,"Miami, FL",20,75,165,5.0,8/3/2013,"I really enjoy going to Cheesecake Factory, last night I gather there with some friends and as usual the food was phenomenal, it's my experience, everytime I go to any CF I try a new dish on the menu, with very few exceptions, all of them have been super tasty."
Michael B.,"Miami, FL",27,4,1,5.0,5/26/2014,"Took it easy and went with a salad. It was HUGE! There's nothing like going in hungry, eating healthy, and leaving stuffed!"
Nury T.,"Miami, FL",91,41,761,5.0,6/5/2013,"Complimentary bread is delicious! Everything we had from appetizers to chicken to the cheesecakes was wonderful! Pot stickers, pizza, chicken madeira, chicken bellagio, flatbreads, to soup of the day...yummy! Oreo Cheesecake is fabulous!"
Cassie P.,"Miami, FL",3140,1285,2333,2.0,5/15/2010,"There could not be a better fitted name for a restaurant because this popular chain really is a ""factory."" What does it manufacture? Oversized portions of just about any type of food that you could imagine wanting.  With so many great restaurants around the area, I get confused when people choose Cheesecake to go to for dinner, but I find myself here every now and then, usually with big groups of friends for a birthday. The plus side is that the menu has just about anything you could want so everyone can always find something.  The downside of this is that you feel like you're reading a novel before ordering and it makes deciding what to get quite the ordeal!  I've always had good experiences here with the waitstaff and they do a good job of working their assembly line. And not going to lie, I LOVE the cheesecake. Cheesecake is by far my favorite dessert, and they do it just as good as the rest! With all the different varieties, it's impossible to pass up. But cheesecake aside, I'll always choose to go to a real restaurant and pass up the factory."
Yara A.,"Miami, FL",6,36,7,4.0,10/3/2014,"One of my favorite places for brunch. Though I'm not a fan of chain restaurants the Cheesecake Factory has very good food. The lemon ricotta pancakes are a must try! However, pancakes and French toast are only available on Sunday's."
