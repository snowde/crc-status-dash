Delvin D.,"Columbia, MD",0,11,15,5.0,12/8/2017,"Not the best place to work, but who is reading for that? The food is excellent (made from scratch). The scenery is spectacular. The servers are thoroughly trained. The waits can be long, but people will wait for good food and service. I've always found it worth the wait. A slice of cheesecake is pricey, but people will pay for it, as do I. I'm not generally a fan of corporate restaurants, but this is my favorite place to eat."
Taahine M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,1,,2.0,12/3/2017,"Came here last night with family (party of 5) after my sister's graduation ceremony in Baltimore... Very busy night and because they don't do reservations, the wait was super long - about an hr and 5-10 min before we were finally seated. We ordered appetizers as we were drinking while the other 2 in our party ordered entrees -- ** Egg roll sampler -- this we loved! Delicious and flavorful!! ** Salmon Rolls -- it was alright though I feel it could be better. The salmon was dry and a little bland. ** Buffalo Chicken wings -- good! I ordered this without the sauce because I was craving fried chicken wings and this was pretty straightforward - juicy, flavorful and good! ** Dynamite shrimp -- this was NOT good!! Shrimp was overly breaded, no flavor and there was nothing dynamite about the sauce at all!! ** Grilled Steak Medallions (ordered to be shared as appetizer) -- I was kind of iffy about ordering steak here and the rest of the party advised I shouldn't  since its not a streak place but I went ahead and ordered it since I was craving steak. I ordered the steak medium rare but when they brought it out it was from medium to mostly well done (not happy about that). The flavor was OK but upset about how the steak was cooked (not medium rare)! Should've listened to everyone! ** Country Salad -- Good salad!! Didn't taste the entrees of the other 2 in the party so won't add those to the review... My final take on here -- food was sub par, mediocre (not including the desserts). Not worth the pricing or the wait. Service was just okay though I do understand that this was a very busy night and the servers may have been a little stressed with all the pressure. Believe the hype when it comes to the desserts but regarding the food -- don't believe the hype!!!"
Tri L.,"Columbia, MD",241,78,614,4.0,11/17/2017,"This is our (my girlfriend and I) go-to place whenever we're uncertain or undecided about to eat. It's close to where we live and it's conveniently located in the Columbia Mall. We often go to the mall before or after coming here. The Cheesecake Factory offers a huge selection of entrees and delicious desserts. The variety of entrees is expansive, with options that are American, Chinese, Indian, Seafood, and many other types. Absolutely have to try out their cheesecakes, it's in their name! Sometimes we'll be in the mood for something light and healthy(-ish), sometimes we'll be in the mood for something heavy and filling, and we'll often be satisfied with our options here. The food is decent but not stunning. Portion size is very generous and many times I have to bring home leftovers. They also offer good, warm bread as an opener. Some personal favorites include: Fried Cheese, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and Tomato Basil Pasta with Chicken.  Service is usually good but sometimes is lacking. Usually we have waiters who are very friendly and attentive but other times we barely see them. The wait time can get long if you show up during prime hours (6-7:30PM). There's plenty of parking space. If you're looking for a decent place with a lot of options, you can't go wrong here."
Brandon S.,"Essex, MD",26,157,153,3.0,12/23/2017,"Another dark dinning experience with mediocre food at a Cheesecake Factory. Not horrible, but just not great. Sure, it's in the heart of Columbia, it's during the Christmas season so parking is nuts but the staff is friendly. If you live in a cave, you'll feel right at home in the very dim interior. I had to pull out my phone and use it as a flashlight to see the menu clearly. Food is priced higher than its quality but it's not terrible. For a family of 4, look to spend about $75. Wouldn't recommend but also would advise to run away from."
Renu O.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",13,57,173,4.0,1/2/2018,"We had real good time with friends. It was kind of impromptu plan and the place was packed . We headed to the bar and ordered our drinks along with nacho, chicken burrito and for dinner I ordered veggie burger . It was amazing and healthy too. Patty was made of brown rice :) must try for all vegetarians!"
Kenneth C.,"Washington, DC",96,50,77,4.0,12/19/2017,"I don't know if this Factory is the original one in the state but it feels like the OG. Imo, it's probably the best cheesecake factory in the state. I've been to montgomery malls, arundel malls, and others, but this one just gives off a vibe that's unlike the rest. Aside from the vibe it gives off, there are not many details of which to differentiate each Factory. Yet, the service here is definitely the best. Each time I've been, my servers have always been at the top of their game, never missing a beat. When it comes to the food, I'll always say that you really get what you pay for (maybe get a bit less considering the steep prices). But the vibe and service bump up my review to 4 stars."
Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",28,188,220,4.0,9/12/2017,"Went for lunch with a friend and decided to sit outside since the weather was so amazing. The hostess at first was going to sit us in the shade on one side of the building and when we requested to sit on the other side, where others were sitting, so we could be in the sun she said they were having issues with bees. She sat at us the one table out there that had some sun.  Our waitress was great. She was very friendly and attentive. She also knew a lot about the menu. We asked about the Korean Fried Cauliflower and she highly recommended it. It was so good! So flavorful and a little spicy but not overly. I forgot to take a picture but it was delicious!  I ordered the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls. They were great as usually. Could of used a bit more marinara sauce but other than that they were great. I also ordered the Truffle Bacon Grilled Cheese Sticks. They were also great!  Only downside was that the bees were on our side of the building too kept landing on our table, plates, and us. We moved to another table in the shade and next to the building and still had the same problem. Others were also having the same issue. Our waitress handled it great though despite the chaos it created. The hostess should have really stopped seating people out there though until they either have the issue resolved."
Susan D.,"Alexandria, VA",148,22,25,3.0,12/28/2017,"I have frequented the Tysons Corner and Durham, NC locations often and this experience was just okay in comparison. I ordered the hibachi steak which came out cold to the touch. The server took the dish away to set it under a heat lamp while my boyfriend continued to finish his entire meal. The plate came back scalding hot and the food was at this point dried out. I very much regretted stepping out of my comfort zone of chicken at this restaurant. Our server, Kumba, was very kind. The peppermint cheesecake was again just okay. For a slightly expensive date night and considering I wanted my boyfriend's first experience at Cheesecake to be amazing... everything was just okay. I expected so much more."
Alyssa S.,"Baltimore, MD",286,153,531,4.0,3/27/2017,"Best service at this location is in the bar! IMO this location knocks the Towson one out of the water. I've been a few times for dinner and once recently for brunch. Brunch on a Sunday or frankly all day Sunday is absolutely packed. An excess of 30+ minute wait at 2pm and about 30 people in the lobby packed. The busy brunch visit was so-so, the table was entirely sticky and all of our plates and silverware were dirty. The waitress handled it really well and brought more. The fried chicken and waffles Benedict looked amazing, but was just ok. The egg wasn't properly poached and the chicken was cooked in an odd oil.  All of my dinner visits here have been good, usually weekdays and it's never been super crowded. I recommend the mac and cheese balls, endive salad, lettuce wrap chicken (not as good as P.F. Chang's though, Chicken Bellagio, Crispy Chicken sand which, four cheese pasta, miso salmon, crispy chicken and shrimp, and the jambalaya. Brown bread is always the best. Martinis here are pretty good, although pricey. I don't think they have a happy hour here or if they do it isn't advertised well and is over by 630pm.  And of course the cheesecake! I'm usually too full to eat any but I never pass up on getting some Togo."
Wanda R.,"Hanover, MD",0,6,4,1.0,12/16/2017,"Wish I could give this restaurant a Zero! My daughter is there now, she got there 6:24pm & was told an hour wait. She chose this place because it is- was her favorite place. She is trying to celebrate her 18th birthday with 6 of her friends. After approximately 1 1/2 hrs she asked how much longer AND the ""manager"" actually told her she's only been waiting 1 hr & 23 minutes. I'm shocked at the rudeness, especially from a so called manager!! After @ 10 minutes my daughter approached the manager again & asked if she'd made the 1 1/2 hrs wait now. The so called manager had the nerve to tell her she's being rude & if she wasn't ""nice"" he would ask her to leave. I am in complete shock!!! All my daughter wanted was to eat at her favorite restaurant with her friends to celebrate her 18th birthday. I don't know how this restaurant stays in business the way they treat customers!! I will definitely be writing Corporate! My daughter deserves an apology ASAP ******* When my daughter got home she did say her food was good And the waiter was nice & funny-- so that helped. They sang Happy Birthday to her BUT they charged her for the cheesecake, I thought a slice was free on your birthday. She ordered an appetizer, drink & a meal so it's not like just went just for the free cheesecake. The experience was not worth going back, AT LEAST not to this location. Her father already told he he'll never go back, Not after the way they treated his daughter! I already wrote corporate And I will put this on all my social media"
Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",108,191,387,4.0,9/19/2017,"Amother great Cheescake Factory. I like this location better most because of the size of this restaurant and the bar. Otherwise, same great service and awesome food."
Carmen M.,"Elkridge, MD",0,15,,2.0,12/2/2017,"I really like all the Cheesecake Factory's I've attended prior to this one in Columbia.  This location is unfortunately the worst one I've been to.  From the start, the table we were seated at was filthy, crumbs on the booth seats and all over the table.  But my colleagues and I just simply wiped the table with a napkin, and brushed off the seats.  No big deal.   I unfortunately bit onto something hard, it appeared to me to maybe be a tiny rock in my taco?  I brought it to the attention of our server, Henry, and sensing this complaint was irritating to him, I did say I wasn't trying to be a pain.  He said ""ok"" and took the foreign object away.  I picked through the rest of my tacos with a fork (which was not great, by the way), since he didn't offer me a different entree, or an alternative suggestion by any means.  I'm curious if this location has a different policy on improperly prepared food, since the entree was not removed from my check? I would have said something, again, however, since I was out with fellow colleagues, I let it go. Also, the shrimp in my taco was as tough as leather, and truth be told, the others in my group politely picked around their food as well.   Someone might need to get the line back in order... we were less than impressed with this location to say the least."
Lissa H.,"Rockville, MD",32,128,371,3.0,5/7/2017,"Decided to dine in for quick dinner after a trip to the adjacent mall. I ordered the Firecracker Salmon and Ahi Tuna Tartare as my meal and my child ordered the kids cheese pizza.  The Firecracker Salmon is comprised of fresh salmon rolled in spinach and a wrapper to form a cigar shape and fried. It is served with sweet chili sauce for dipping. The Ahi Tuna Tartare is layered with avocado, pickled ginger and served on top of soy ginger sesame sauce and accompanied by wonton crisps. We also shared a slice of white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for dessert."
Jake M.,"Baltimore, MD",0,7,,1.0,9/2/2017,"What can I say after an hour and my wife still did not receive her meal? They brought me the wrong order twice (my entree) and suggested I just eat the 2nd one because I would have to wait to have the correct one prepared.  Asked for BBQ sauce for my daughter's order. After waiting nearly 20 mins, I walked and found a manager. It still took another 10 mins. We finally got my wife's order and put it in a to-go box.  The whole thing was a disaster."
Gina J.,"Bowie, MD",59,95,29,2.0,4/18/2017,"Service Friday 4/14 was horrible. After being seated outdoors, I asked for the heat lamp to be turned on, the waiter called to manager over and he appeared to do it. A few minutes later i noticed it was not warming up, alerted the waiter so he suggested we move to table where it worked. OK! It would have been nice to be told that it did not.....but anyway. I asked the waiter about one the newer apps and his response was yeah its ok as he walked away. strike #2.  After placing our order of Tenn hot chicken and Shrimp pasta, we saw him again when the food arrived. Never did he ask for drink orders or offer  bring water to the table. The food was OK, but service leaves much  to be desired! Will not visit this location again. And oh yeah went to the Columbia Mall afterwards...its it me or is it turning into a ""dead Mall""?? Random thought."
Victor R.,"Mt Rainier, MD",1,15,,5.0,11/26/2017,As always.. Good plentiful food. Their kale salad is off the chain. And I don't have to say much about the red velvet cheesecake. Nuff  said!
Geraldine U.,"Silver Spring, MD",419,219,338,3.0,2/9/2017,"How could you say no to yummy food in large serving sizes and to the ability to choose from a wide variety of cheesecake flavors to finish off your meal? You can't!  Say yes to not being afraid of asking for more of the brown bread.  Say yes to the avocado spring rolls. And to the calamari if you're a fan.  Say yes to any pasta dish (it'll last you at least 2 meals).  Say yes to any chicken dish (in my experience, always tender and juicy). Say yes to cheesecake no matter how full you are! (My favorite is banana cream).  Unfortunately the wait can get a little long on a Friday or Saturday evening (up to 45-60 min for a group more than 4), but maybe go shopping a little while you wait."
Frank K.,"Columbia, MD",0,6,11,1.0,10/5/2017,"New mango and avocado salad ordered as takeout. The leaves look dead, they forgot to put grilled chicken on it, mango is sour and avocado is non existent. Would recommend all check their take out as dine and take out portions are getting skinnier and not what people want.  Hope they improve their service and food."
Gagan S.,"Catonsville, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/25/2017,My wife's birthday disaster: this is is how it begins...Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurant and the place where I met wife for the first time.... I decided to celebrate her bday there with group of 13...we had to wait for 1 hour on a Monday night ..and then I showed the front desk person how much space is there to fit us..they then accommodated us It took 30 minutes before someone came to take our order...another 30 to get first round of drinks..I was already disappointed with the service and called the manger...she came..her name was Lauren..I explained what is going on and she said she will take care We ordered appetizers and dinner...right after I ordered that I told the waitress that It's my wife's bday and I need a full cake of carrot cake to surprise her and wish her..she said that she will bring it..I confirmed 3 times...when the dinner was done ..she tells me that it is frozen and not edible! I was disappointed but went to the counter and told to her to bring 4 different slices...it took her another 30 minutes and no one was there! I got up and asked for the manager again..Lauren came again and I explained her the whole story and how disappointed I was.... In the end Lauren tells me that she will convey to the waitress and tells me that if I come back they will give me a cheesecake! Lmao Thank you Lauren I don't need it and thanks for your team for screwing up my wife's bday!!! Very disappointed with a. Company that me and my wife have loved for years... Not sure if higher management cares for these reviews or not but they sure did lose a loyal customer today... Never going back there again!
Fatima Z.,"Silver Spring, MD",60,26,,3.0,11/11/2017,I normally love coming here. Unfortunately today was a bad experience. I asked for no prosciutto in my food and ended up having a ton. I had ordered curb side pick up so there was not much I could do. The manager however was extremely kind and apologetic. He offered to ship me a gift card to compensate.
Dr. Keenan C.,"Middle River, MD",7,1,,1.0,11/15/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory still placing silverware directly on contaminated tables in Columbia, MD and elsewhere. This policy much be changed immediately. Wiping tables using same rags. Really cheesecake Factory. Caught food poisoning, viral gastroenteritis and acute kidney injury 3 weeks ago. Had to be admitted at ER. My child and a friend also ate and got sick also.  A national boycott and protest is being planned. STAY TUNED!"
Alli F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5,17,19,5.0,12/22/2016,"We went to Cheesecake Factory for dinner after years of not getting the chance to go! We just moved to Columbia from LA and figured that Cheesecake was around the corner and a safe bet! I have always been preferable to the food, however the service has never been anything extraordinary... until last Thursday night. We went in 15 mins prior to closing, I honestly feel bad for them, I've worked in retail when I was younger and hated those customers, but always had to serve them with a smile.  Well, the Bartender, Sarah went above and beyond. We let her know that we were new to the area and she greeted us with open arms. She gave us some amazing suggestions of places in the area to check out, where to go skiing. I was apologetic throughout the night, she just laughed every time and said it was not a problem at all and she had to be there anyway. She even said it was refreshing to have customers like us. Anyway, Cheesecake Factory use to be my favorite restaurant when I was a kid and this is by far the BEST service I have received over 3 decades!!!  Thanks Sarah! Keep up the great work! :)"
Taiwo S.,"Wheaton-Glenmont, MD",202,9,2,4.0,10/31/2017,"I came here on a Sunday evening with my mom and was able to get seated right away- super impressed. Our waitress was Paige Z and she was very friendly and patient with us as we decided on what we wanted. I typically only order the Louisiana chicken pasta and wanted to try something different but I settled on that since it was familiar. My mom had no idea what she wanted, so we asked Paige what she liked and she recommended the Bang bang chicken and shrimp, so my mom decided to give it a try.  She brought out a bread basket containing only wheat bread (which we requested) and immediately noticed that the bread was burnt. Not slightly overcooked- burnt ( the whole backside of the bread was black couldn't be cut with a knife). Surely the person who burnt the bread knew it was burnt and still decided to place it in a basket, probably hoping we wouldn't notice. We made Paige aware of the burnt bread and she brought us a new basket 10 minutes later.  While trying to cut the bread I noticed that the entire handle of my knife was dirty! I looked at the other silverware on the table and some of the forks were dirty too :(  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I asked for a glass of hot water and we soaked the utensils in the water and wiped them off. When the food came, everything looked great. I go to eat my pasta and its cold. It wasn't warm as if it had been sitting on the line for a few minutes, it was COLD. I was so disappointed because I always get this meal and it usually comes out just right. Again, not wanting to make a big deal out of it, I just ate it as is. My mom told me to just eat her food down her and I could just heat mine up and take it for lunch the next day. Her meal was AMAZING (hence the 4 stars despite all that went wrong). It was hot and as delicious as Paige said it would be. I plan on interchanging between the bang bang chicken and the Louisiana pasta from now on."
Kate S.,"Baltimore, MD",91,320,613,3.0,5/18/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. Over the top with portion sizes, menu selection, and prices. We have family that live in the middle of nowhere and they always get so excited when they come to visit. They think this place is like a Michelin Star restaurant...  I like coming here before 5 p.m. because you can order off of the lunch menu (smaller portions and cheaper prices). The lunch menu is limited but there is still plenty to choose from (soup, salads, sandwiches, pasta dishes, factory favorites, etc.).  We came here on a Monday afternoon and the place was practically empty. I was surprised when our food took awhile to come out... it wasn't like it was prime time for dining. When the meals came out, my salad was the last to arrive at the table... 5 minutes after everyone else's orders came out. I usually enjoy the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad, but the onion straws on top were undercooked and soggy-- not the usual crispy texture. The Falafel Salad contained a generous portion of falafel and the feta cheese and vinaigrette were a very tasty accompaniment. If you like cheesecake, this is definitely the place to get it. So many different flavors to choose from-- if you have room for it!"
Jedda P.,"Rockville, MD",221,73,78,4.0,6/24/2016,"Got here before the dinner rush hour on a Friday night (~6:00pm) and got a seat right away at the bar. Server (Kumba) was really nice, all smiles and even made recommendations when we got stuck between 2 appetizers/small plates.  Ordered 3 appetizers/small plates (samosas, shrimp and cheesy tots) and loved all of them! I think the shrimp is definitely going to be my go to... Loved the sauce that it came with. I don't know if the service is just overall fast (I don't come here often) or if it's because it wasn't that busy yet... But friends and I were able to eat and chat and still make our movie at 7:30 next door.  Only downside is that happy hour ends at 6pm and not 7... So we missed it :(  Overall a very good experience! #ourfoodieventures (on Instagram)"
Nastassia M.,"Meridianville, AL",2,11,9,2.0,7/6/2017,"This place is horrible. Ordered the same meal I've been ordering  for over 5 years. Asked for extra sauce on the side. Drive all the way home, only to find they decided NOT to add ANY sauce on the food. Dry Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi. Called and spoke with the manager MARK, who stated"" come by another day tomorrow perhaps on your way home and bring the food back with the receipt! Huh, are you insane? Defeats the entire purpose of ordering to go! He I ask for the GM, Mark explains he's not available. Moral of the story check your food before you leave!better customer service is needed AJ and Mark!"
Jazlyn L.,"Laurel, MD",113,21,48,4.0,8/11/2017,"I enjoy eating here,  it is usually crowed on the weekends but I often find a seat in the bar section and opt to eat there.  My favorite dishes  are Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and Miso Fish.  The portions are large and we always have leftovers."
Kris M.,"Sykesville, MD",23,19,,5.0,10/4/2017,"We are 'frequent flyers' at the Cheesecake Factory! Their food is very consistent, the atmosphere is upbeat, decor is nice and service is great. My go-to is the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls, always enjoyed with a glass of white wine, of course. So good! I am not big on deserts but my daughter LOVES red velvet cheesecake. I will return again and again!"
Aladdin I.,"Ellicott City, MD",32,20,3,4.0,5/9/2017,"I have been here countless times, but most recently I did a carryout on 5/1 and the carryout staff was awesome! The guy that seemed like the manager helped me decided on a new flavor and was a good sport and patient. The lady Mayra was awesome also and has been the best carryout experience I've had.

Charlie G.,"SUITLAND, MD",1,9,,5.0,6/18/2017,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory!  One of my best meals was had the day I was released from the hospital after brain surgery.  I had a taste for salmon, and my brother took me to the Columbia, MD location.  I wish I had taken a picture because my plate was gorgeous.  The Thai Glazed Salmon was a generous portion, perfectly cooked on a bed of brown rice.  I requested the brown rice instead of white.  I also had the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which were outstanding.  But back to the salmon, it was large enough for me to save some for my lunch the next day, and warmed over, it was still the bomb! A neighbor had come to visit me just as I was preparing to heat my plate, and I couldn't wait for that woman to leave so I could eat in peace!  Oh, it was soooo good! My only complaint about CF is the noise level.  You can hardly hear yourself think, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying my meal.   I want to go back today, but it's Father's Day plus a Sunday, and I know any restaurant today is going to be a zoo!"
M L.,"Clarksburg, MD",0,6,,3.0,10/5/2017,"31st Wedding anniversary and thought it would be nice to take my husband to lunch.  Experience 2   Food 3 From the very beginning the Waiter was great.  But clearly something out of his control was going on in the background. Received our ice tea, but had to track down someone for sugar after a wait that allowed me to even go to the restroom, stand in a line and return to the table.  I got back to the table before the sugar did.   We arrived at 1:40 pm., post lunch rush.  We were served after 2:15 pm.  Food came in two parts.  Sandwiches, then the sweet potato fries.  Food: Veggie burger was good.  This is one of the reasons I go to Cheesecake Factory, different location.  Tomatoes were fresh, pickles were fine.  Lettuce, though moist, looked more like left over bits of shredded lettuce for tacos.  Husband's bacon burger was alright.  He ordered medium well, but he got something that was pink.  Could have sent it back but the afternoon had already been long.  We ordered our lunch.  After a while, Waiter came out and explained that there was a delay of the veggie burger.  His manager was working on it.  Waiter also apologized that the before meal bread had not arrived. He said (this was the third time) that he was still waiting for it to get finished baking.   The manager came out with the sandwiches, apologized and said the fries were on their way.  I did express (soft tones) our frustration at the wait.  He just kind of looked at us.   Shortly there after a member of the kitchen team came out with a lovely servings of sweet potato fries.  They were hot and good.  She was friendly.  She wanted to know if we wanted some of the pre-meal bread when it was done.  We passed.  Did not get any cheesecake.  Had planned on it, but we were pretty much over it.   Overall this was not a great experience.  We made the best of it.  But won't be going back."
Jackie A.,"Laurel, MD",26,290,,2.0,3/11/2017,"There are certain dishes that allow for creativity and there are others that when you  order them, you anticipate them to be presented in a certain way.  This holds true for shrimp scampi.  I want to taste the garlic, wine, butter, hint of lemon - see the sprinkle of parsley on my  fat, perfectly cooked shrimp.  I want my nose to twitch, as I inhale the buttery, garlic sauce emitting from my pasta.  That's what I expect to see and taste.  What I received was a mound of pasta, with neither garlic nor lemon - perhaps some butter and wine - served with fried shrimp.  Where's the GARLIC.  You just made me a shrimp scampi without garlic and you fried the shrimp, as if served on a seafood platter?  Say it isn't so. I enjoyed my small Greek salad, with it's fresh veggies and zippy vinaigrette, but next time - please use the oregano leaves and toss the woody twig. On a positive note, my service was stellar and the s'more cheese cake was toothsome, yummy and worth those extra calories."
Erica M.,"Washington, DC",5,114,292,3.0,4/8/2017,"So I will give them 3 stars for the drinks, ambiance, and staff. I am not a fan by any means. I just don't like the food. I know many will not agree with me but I have gone to different ones and I genuinely don't like it.  Now on the other hand the drinks were outstanding!!!!!!"
Stacy R.,"Bethesda, MD",98,162,105,3.0,8/30/2016,I've eaten here about 7 times this year. Each time has been amazing with no complaints. Here are my favorites. The spicy crispy chicken sandwich = seriously stupid good The eggplant parm = perfect and the portion is enough for me to make 3-4 meals out of it! Avocado salad = so fresh and yummy The herb crusted salmon is a dish I've eaten for years. Extra dirty Belvedere martini with blue cheese stuffed queen olives. You can't have just one!
James P.,"Rockville, MD",0,8,2,3.0,4/14/2017,"Cheesecake is decent most of the time Loud noises ridiculous wait time for not so worth food. Portions are generous but sometimes the pastas can be bland. However, the ambiance definitely makes up a bit little too dark but its good casual night out place. And ofcourse cheesecake always good"
Matt S.,"Bethesda, MD",0,1,,5.0,12/23/2017,"I am going through a tough custody battle with my ex and the only time I was being allowed to celebrate Christmas with my daughters was an hour at the Mall in Columbia the day after Christmas.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that the Mall isn't an ideal location for ANYTHING the day after Christmas. But the idea of going there on that day to meet your 3 and 6 year old daughters to celebrate and open up more than 20 gifts, is nothing short of a nightmare.  Thankfully, I came up with the idea of trying to find a restaurant that would reserve a small area in a back corner where we could sit down, open gifts, and enjoy ourselves briefly.  After a few unsuccessful requests to other restaurants, I finally called The Cheesecake Factory and spoke to one of their Managers names Zach (or Zack? I'll refer to him as Z from now on so I don't spell his name wrong haha), and without hesitation he agreed to reserve a place for us.  As luck would have it, Z was also scheduled to be the opening manager that day, and made sure I knew to come directly to him if I ran into any issues.  Now, if anyone has ever been to Cheesecake Factory, they are pretty strict about their reservation policy.  I even called two other CF locations to see if they'd agree to it, and they both said no. Z probably has no idea how much this means to me, or how much better he's making my daughters Christmas, but it's hard to explain how truly grateful I am to find someone that cares more about doing the right thing instead of going by ""policy"" and saying no.  I figured the least I could do is write some reviews to say thank you.  So thanks Z!  You just gave me the best Christmas gift I could ever receive!"

I'm surprised that this location has only been rated three stars.. that's unfortunate because that number doesn't reflect my personal experience here. Last week I came for dinner and everything felt the same as it did a few years ago (except they have a ""skinny menu"" now which btw doesn't include pasta dishes). I was always a major fan of their Alfredo with Chicken and Cajun Jambalaya. Cheesecake Factory is where I fell in love with anything that's ""white chocolate raspberry"" flavored. Take me to Cheesecake and you will win me over!"
Rumit P.,"Silver Spring, MD",391,441,1293,4.0,7/19/2016,"I've visited the Columbia location for years and years, and this is a review of my latest visit (7/18/16). I like TCF because every time I order an entree here it takes just like the way it did the previous time I ordered. They are consistent.  We were seated right away without a wait (9pm on a Monday, so we didn't expect a wait). There was a reasonable crowd given that this location is right by a major residential development and Columbia Mall. The server was prompt and friendly and did adequate follow-up visits to the table.  I ordered the Southern fried chicken sliders, which are four mini sliders (""mini"" is relative) with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and two sauces on the side (mayo and tangy chipotle ranch). The chicken was cooked well, not overdone, and was flavorful and fresh. The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and complemented the meal well. The pickles were way too many for the four sliders, so you're in for a treat if you're a pickle fan. The portion size is large enough for one person.  Leave room for dessert! Get the dessert to go and order well enough ahead of time; they're slow in getting the cheesecakes out."

I am rating them based on their pasta and salads since that's all I've ordered them even to this date. Their foods are quite handful and you won't feel like you have been ripped off from their fairly pricy menus. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed their atmosphere as well as services."
E. R.,"Washington, DC",0,7,20,2.0,9/23/2016,"How does The Cheesecake Factory in Columbia, MD run out of Spinach and Cheese dip??? It really bothers me when the customer have to ask for bread at a restaurant where they provide bread for the table. We ordered a few appetizers to share but I have to say that the food here is really inconsistent which to me hurts the Cheesecake Factory brand. Our service was not bad but it he wa not as attentive as he should have been. We had to catch him to ask fir refills even though he walked past a few times. We ordered buffalo blast, crab and artichoke dip, sliders, and fried calamari. Here's the skinny: Sliders - We asked for well done but when received them they were undercooked so we had to send them back. It took quite a while to get them back which we didn't understand but at least they were juicy and cooked well when the second time. Crab & Artichoke Dip - We ordered this in place of the spinach and cheese dip but I was not impressed. It was okay, but needed more cheese and seasoning. It had way too much grease (as seen in the pic) so we had to drain it before eating. Fried Calamari / Buffalo Blast - Great, nice crisp coating and seasoned well.  I gave it 3 stars because I couldn't do 2.5. I think I'll continue to go to the one in DC or Alexandria/Arlington."
