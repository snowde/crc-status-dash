Kris L.,"Catonsville, MD",0,23,26,5.0,6/29/2014,"Great Sunday brunch menu and happy hour.  The seating is great with the exception of the two rows in the center of the restaurant. They sit people too close together to the point that you feel like you are part of other peoples conversations. I highly suggest asking not to be seated there. Otherwise, we have always had good waiters, efficient service, and good food here. I always have leftovers for 1 or 2 additional meals so come hungry!"
Erika S.,"Owings Mills, MD",60,28,4,4.0,11/23/2012,"You know, there is only so much you can say about a chain restaurant.  The food was on par with expectations.  However, I wish there was a bit more light available within the restaurant.  I know it is supposed to be romantic, but  I felt like it was past the point of passionate first date atmosphere.  It was more like, 'please hand me a flashlight as I manuever my way to my booth without killing myself'.  Then, of course, I cannot read the menu because it is so dark.  I am not that old.  However, I found myself wishing I had one of those magnifier light thingys I see on TV.  My 20/20 vision was no match for the combination of small letters and dim lighting. Our server was nice.  She was new so she was being shadowed by a more experienced server.  Now while I have the patience of a saint, my cousins were a different story.  When we were providing our orders to the server, he asked if they could add bacon to his burger.  The server proceeded to tell him that she didn't think he could.  The trainer stepped in and said he could.  However, my cousin never let go of the fact that she said he couldn't add bacon to his burger.  Nevertheless, the only issue I had with her is that her language on occasion was a bit informal.  When we needed items packed up for to go boxes, she said 'Yea sure, give it here"".  So, for me, if that is the only issue I have going to a commercial joint like the Cheesecase Factory, that is a satisfactory service."
Adam R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",4,38,,5.0,2/13/2015,"I give it five stars for being the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to. The servers waste no time in getting you in and placing you at your tables, and it seems they've had plenty of experience with eating the food and can give great recommendations.  This place is packed Monday-Sunday for dinner, so I would suggest putting in your name, and taking a leisurely stroll down near the mall. As far as time to food and servers- they're very attentive and the food seems to come out at a very good pace.  As far as taste- Cheesecake factory always has perfect food when it comes to consistency- and so I never have anything to complain about."
Janet P.,"Charles Town, WV",71,263,221,3.0,11/18/2012,"Came here with a friend who wanted to come for dinner this week, I'm not a CF fan but this was probably the best one I've been to thus far. We were told the wait was 20min, we waited a bit longer than that (like 30min) and then we proceeded to talk to the hostess who then immediately got us a seat right after. We had also called the place to try and make a reservation but they told us that they don't take reservations. Bunch of stuck-up overdressed customers were here, packed parking-lot around the area as well... thought I had just arrived at Tysons 2 or something, lol. The bread was good that we got before our food arrived. The black tea I didn't care for as it was strong and bitter, but I didn't want to get there fruit flavored tea, so I stuck to drinking the water. The artichoke dip was fair but could've been a bit better I thought. I got the spicy cashew chicken which was pretty tasty and not overly spicy which was good because I like to enjoy my food without breaking a sweat, this was definitely the best CF dish I've tried thus far but something about it still seemed a bit off to me. I also had the Godiva Cheesecake which was pretty much the way it sounded but topped with a dallop of whip cream on top and another dallop on the plate. The decor looks like most CF factories, like a knock-off version of a Las Vegas establishment, heh. The 2-people tables are small (one side booth and one side chair) and very close to the neighboring tables, luckily my butt didn't get in someones food upon sitting on the booth side. The menu's looked like a book, we joked how they might as well have us open a huge newspaper but then we'd hit the people beside us, lol. Our waitress was good to us (although had a weird voice which made it hard to understand with all the noise in the place), but I noticed any African-American customers kept getting bad service or something, no clue what was up with that."
Lawrence S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",29,12,,2.0,11/22/2015,"First off, considering that the Cheesecake Factory is a chain establishment, most of what I'm going to say is going to sound repetitive to those who've experienced plenty of these restaurants. Anyways, first off, slow service, while the waiters are courteous, being such a huge restaurant with many tables, it's impossible to catch the attention of a worker, especially so when I'm seated at the booth where the cursory look of the waiter will most like zip right past your upraised hand, either that or the waiter just turns around and walks out of the lane of tables that they are waiting because you were seated right in the middle of that corridor, like how I was with my family. Waitress got my order wrong, had to wait another 25 mins after the rest of the food came to even taste any of my food. Eggplant Parmesean lunch item, they gave me chicken parm btw. And when I it came to the bill, realized they charged me for the dinner value of the parm when I asked for the lunch version. Brought this up with my waitress, says that they charged me the dinner parm because that's what they gave me, messed up the order here again as you can see, told her my stance of how I'm not paying for their mistake, which St that point she told me she will bring this issue up with er manager. Truthfully, felt a bit insulted that they thought to charge me the whole value of any meal item considering the rest of my table was done with their food and waited another 15 minutes or so while I start munching on my food when it arrived. It's the little things, but service is the bread and butter of any restaurant, regardless of being an independent restaurant or a franchise. Regardless, food is mediocre, and the rush job on my food at this point left me with a eggplant dish still a little more raw in the center than it should be, and pasta that had not taken the extra 5 secs to properly coat with the pesto. Had bunches of just plain noodle uncoated staring at me. Know I'm being a repetitive, but the small things that you overlook is what cost you in anything you do. Can't give this place more than 2 stars."
Nichole F.,"Ocean City, MD",1,4,1,1.0,7/8/2015,"Terrible experience at lunch today.  Got seated at a squished table by a super loud man.  We would have dealt with that if everything else had not been AWFUL.  We did not get offered bread (after waiting about 10 minutes for someone to come to the table).  I tried to find our server to ask, but she was nowhere to be found most of the time.  She was pleasant but absent.  My daughter's salad had a half-dead fly in it and the 4 bites she had before the discovery were displeasing to her senses.  Our pizza was hot and fresh and hopefully fly-free.  Our server asked if I wanted a box for the pizza and she brought me 1 tiny black cheesecake box for 4 slices of pizza.  I had to stack them on top of one another and I'm sure they are going to be very soggy later.  We ordered cheesecake to go and waited 15 minutes for it.  Nothing was taken off our $50 bill (for 2 people without alcohol).  The manager didn't give a flying f*** about our issue and he walked away without a resolution.  Won't be going there again.  Thanks for nothing Cheesecake Factory."
Clara S.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,3,1,5.0,2/1/2015,Best place I've eaten. Love it here so much. The workers are so nice and always smiling. The food great and fresh. Their cheesecake is so good. :) I really really really really really really really love it here.
SA F.,"Frederick, MD",1,121,103,1.0,6/18/2012,"We tried this place out for Mother's Day - HORRIBLE.  WILL NOT GO BACK  I called ahead for our party of twelve (12) & was told there was no call ahead seating, but the wait time would be 1-2 hours, starting when our party arrived.  Okay, so we drove an hour to go there.   Once we got to the front of the line to get in line for a table, I was told I would have to wait to speak with the Manager to get a real wait time.  REALLY?  So ten (10) minutes later, the MANAGER tells me it will be 5-6 **HOURS** until we can be seated.  It's 2 pm on a Sunday & (now that all 12 of us - including 6 kids) are there, we can wait until 8 or 9 PM for lunch.  Hmmm.. I think not.   It's almost like they didn't want our business.  How bout telling me over the phone ""we are slammed, we just cannot accommodate such a large party today"" but no, you tease me with the 1-2 hour wait time enticing me to drive an hour to get to your restaurant, then surprise me with some BULL CRAP 5-6 HOUR WAIT TIME?  Ridiculous.  I can't believe the manager kept a straight face while feeding me this line of crap.  So I suggest we break down into three (3) parties - party of 3, party of 4 & party of 5.  He tells me it will be 1-2 hours.  Okay, fine, we will sit separately.  I go shopping while hubby & kids wait for the table.  30 minutes later I get the call - our table is ready.  Really?  Can't they use a computer for a real wait time?  I used to be a hostess in a busy restaurant & we used to pull the numbers out of our backsides (total guess work), but that was 20 years ago & I didn't work at an upscale place like the Cheesecake Factory. Service was okay, food was okay - I will NEVER go back to the Columbia store because of the CRAPTASTIC manager.  I wrote to Corporate, but they did nothing."
Liz S.,"Washington, DC",13,38,,3.0,12/9/2015,The service isn't great and the food is pretty good usually depending on what your order. I had the pesto pasta dish and it wasn't my favorite but I have had some meat based pasta dishes that are usually pretty good.
Jill W.,"Atlanta, GA",303,272,272,5.0,5/15/2012,"Nothing has ever disappointed here. I'm not even one to care about bad service, but we've always had exemplary servers here. That said, onto the food. I actually close my eyes and savor the food here, which is a good sign. Some items that have elicited that reaction include: -shrimp toast on a stick w/ sauce: these could be properly described as shrimp and veggie meatballs paired with an orange/pink sauce...clean and fresh with a nice crust -vietnamese tacos (don't be fooled--I would have usually been turned off thinking of having to bite into a hard corn shell, but NO, this came with those white, enriched-flour steamed buns used in asian pastry stores! Like a pork bun, with laces of red pepper and lettuce--yum) -chicken samosas with a green sauce (these are unique; it's like ground meat in a thin, crispy phyllo dough type of wrapper; I appreciate that better than the tough, thick, fried dough that usually encases samosas in Indian food places. So it's not real traditional samosas, but I'd say if you're into low-carb, you'd appreciate) -thai lettuce wraps (better than P.F. Changs, hands down! Big, clean pieces of lettuce, good quality chicken filling, and several sauces to choose from, along with sprouts, purple lettuce, etc. this is a meal in itself, one of the largest appetizers) -summer rolls (better than the ones from real pho places...sorry, those run the risk of tasting fishy but the ones here at Cheesecake are Americanized to the point where there isn't that ""fishy"" taste) -Evelyn's favorite pasta (great vegetarian option) -Salmon, diane steak, shrimp combo platter (small cuts of meat that do not overwhelm, but there are several pieces so the portion size is ample overall) -salads (these are HUGE and can be taken home) -and of course, the cheesecakes and desserts...the ultimate red velvet cheesecake was a trip. Anyway, the general idea is that everything I've tried has been done very well and exceeded my expectations.  This particular store is great because it's next to the mall and movie theatre and it opens late--no one really chases you out. They turn on the lights politely :)"
Chris G.,"Elkridge, MD",32,43,,3.0,1/21/2013,"I've eaten here before and it is like every other Cheesecake Factory; overpacked, overpriced and a surplus uncooked food. Would I eat here again? Probably so, only if I couldn't convince whomever I'm with to go somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, though, I am writing this review to rave about the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It can't be beat!"
Tee B.,"Columbia, MD",5,70,7,4.0,7/21/2014,"Desserts good. They have some decent dishes, and decor is an upgrade from most restaurants. They will now have to compete with Maggianos, which strives to be on the same level but gives you more food. We'll see who wins."
Nikki G.,"Ellicott City, MD",84,39,19,2.0,12/23/2012,"The food is great half the time and the other half overpriced, but the service is always lacking here.  I have experienced poor service at this location on several occasions.  On my most recent visit, my waitress could not be found when needed more than once. When she was asked for the check she forgot which I can understand.  The second time we asked she responded with, ""Oh I didn't think you were really ready for the check.""  Once we were ready to pay the check she never stopped by to cash us out so we had to ask another waiter.   I tasted the Cream of Mushroom Soup, The Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, and Miso Salmon.  All of these food items were delicious.  The only reason my rating is not worse."
Garvin C.,"Ellicott City, MD",13,216,3,3.0,7/27/2010,"The Cheesecake factory I think is one of the better national chain restaurants in terms of food and variety. This particular location has been pretty consistent with putting out good meals. I've ordered a few different pasta dishes, sandwiches, and burgers, and each time the entree has come out cooked well (e.g. pasta was never overcooked, sauces not way too salty or gloppy, sandwiches not too oily or put together poorly, etc.). Of course, their desserts are delicious, but only something you should eat every once in a while (they are really bad for your health if you eat it often!).  The decor is a little over the top in my opinion, but it's nice and airy in there. One thing that really get to be here are the floors. They can be kind of slick, so be careful walking near the kitchen area! The service for the most part is fine, but for some reason I never get the feeling that they want to take good care of me as a customer. Not sure why though, but I never feel entirely comfortable here. Parking can be tough since it is at the Columbia Mall, so you might be parked far away. The wait for a seat can be really long during busy hours, so try and arrive a little earlier if possible."
Amy H.,"Rockville, MD",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2015,"Wow. We had a horrible experience here, which is unfortunate because we drove from Rockville due to our previous good experiences. Our waitress asked my husband to open the wine bottle because she didn't know how, then didn't even pour the wine. Ok, fine, we're not snobs so whatever. Then our entrees took over 30 minutes to come out. The manager stopped by to say they were coming out in a few minutes but it was much longer and we were never offered more bread or anything. When the salmon salad got there, it was raw. Totally slimy and raw. I left most of it and told the waitress so she said they get that complaint a lot and they would just put the food on my plate back on the grill. Um, gross. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to split since I was still hungry, and they split it so unevenly it was comical. I'm not convinced they split a full piece, it was tiny and usually the cheesecake slices are way too big for us. The clincher was when I paid with a $100 and the waitress asked -- 15 minutes after picking up our folder -- if we needed change. Good lord, never again will we bother driving that far for awful service with sub-par food. Stick to the Montgomery Mall location!"
Dana P.,"Severn, MD",0,2,,1.0,10/3/2015,Just tried to get cheesecake from the bakery and had to cancel our order because it was forgotten. Was told 10 minute wait and by 25 minutes people who were behind us in line had gotten there order already. They brought the manager out to refund us and never apologized or anything. I understand being busy but when someone orders food and cheesecake 20 minutes after you and it was already coming out then obviously our order was lost. Never going back to Cheesecake Factory again
Kristin M.,"Laurel, MD",11,9,,2.0,7/17/2014,"Attended for brunch with a group of 8 women.  Service was EXTREMELY slow.  As in, we ordered waters and then waited 20 minutes to receive them.  Then waited another 20 minutes to place an order, much, much longer to receive the food, etc.  It wasn't even crowded so I'm not sure why the server was gone all the time.  My friend and I ordered two dishes to share - the monte cristo sandwich and the crab hash.  Monte Cristo sandwich was excellent. Very rich, but no complaints.  The crab hash was a complete disappointment.  Totally bland, no spices added (especially no salt).  Overall, not worth a second trip."
Amber M.,"Columbia, MD",235,237,48,2.0,4/21/2014,"Premium location, sub-par service. I've been here on several occasions and very recently I've noticed the staff isnt too happy to be working there. I'm not exactly expecting to receive the ""Disney Experience"" at TCF but I havent come across too many friendly servers here. We do pick up service now and those TCF staff are always very nice. The ridiculously long waits and failure to adopt a group reservation policy are additional turn offs of mine."
Adam L.,"Columbia, MD",2,1,,1.0,7/30/2014,Frozen cheese cake to go along with poor service. Waited 20 minutes to order and pay and another 35 to get it.
Raj S.,"Columbia, MD",0,11,,5.0,7/26/2015,"We have always had a great time at this location.  Only downside, expect a wait for a table most of the time."
