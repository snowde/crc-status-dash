Kathryn R.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",0,6,2,2.0,2/25/2017,The carry out is usually hit or miss.  I often have to check the bag.  Tonight I forgot to do this. Of course now at 8 pm not convenient to tut around.  Our kids meal of corn dogs No fries.  The tray is so big with four pieces that maybe equals one corn at best then no fries. Now heating I am frozen fries taking more time. Our Cobb salad has cheese which I asked twice to make sure and it was repeated back to me. Of course there is cheese.  So that goes to the trash.  Out of three orders only one correct.  The manager is sending out a refund for the items wrong.  Still pretty annoying for tonight because still have to figure out one meal for the Cobb salad replacement......not sure why staff can't be trained to check each order before it goes out.  Same service at McDonald's
Chanel E.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",68,9,,3.0,8/12/2016,"Spoke to a representative, and they offered a gift card for the inconveniences we had, so we are all good. I hope the service is awesome next time we visit!"
Jane p.,"Odenton, MD",7,15,5,1.0,7/22/2016,"Sheesh. This place has really gone down hill. Such a stark difference from the opening. Not one manager touched our table during our 2 hour dinner. ALWAYS OUT OF BREAD! Why! This location cannot seem to get this right. This is your concepts staple! Cmon! Just a suggestion... Maybe up your pars?! We always get the same excuse ""the baker loaded the ovens too late"". Since when was it appropriate to blame the kitchen?! Completely unprofessional- server 101. Dirty silverware... Really?! Basic side work, people! Spare yourself the despair and time, drive 15 minutes to go to Arundel Mills. Always have fresh bread, always have a manager visit our table, always clean silverware, always plenty of parking."
Sharon L.,"Columbia, MD",69,9,,5.0,9/17/2016,Had lunch at cheesecake factory today wonderful salmon platter. Prepared excellently and served well. Service was a little slow. But the ambience made up for the slow service. Had lunch today service and food much better. They were slammed and sitting was immediate. Great place to eat.
Sam S.,"Novi, MI",0,17,,1.0,3/14/2017,So we came here today (snow day). The place was pretty empty and we got sat at some small table up against a dirty diving wall. The small plates on the table were dirty. Bread came out at the same time as our food. Food was very bland. There were pieces of paper or something in my boyfriend's pasta.
Amanda C.,"Columbia, MD",0,15,2,1.0,9/11/2016,Everytime we come here they take forever to deliver the food and the host staff is rude. Tonight we spent more time waiting for our cheesecakes than we did waiting for a table and eating our food.
Rekyia A.,"Baltimore, MD",45,35,53,1.0,7/8/2016,"Before I give this review, Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite go to spots and this is the first time I've had a horrible experience.  My family and I are in town for the 4th July weekend visiting family and we decided to check out Cheesecake Factory for brunch. First off I want to say our silverware was very filthy once we sat down at the table...very disgusting. Midway into indulging in our meal, I notice mold on all our toast. Mind you that one of my family members already digested a few pieces already. Once we told the waitress she immediately saw the bread and got the manager. The manager name is Bo Martz (supposedly) came to our table and said he was sorry and he don't know what else to say. We could not believe that's all he said. We had to tell him that he was going to take care our bill and we advise him he should have came to us with solutions and an answer to why we was eating molded bread! The manager was not sympathetic at all. He was basically looking at us like he was the victim. Horrible experience at this location!"
Carlo C.,"Rockville, MD",0,23,,2.0,9/8/2016,"Visited the Columbia Maryland shop recently, hadn't been in a long time and recalled that it was well run.  This visit was underwhelming, the floor around our table was very dirty, lots of food left by the previous diners. All our silverware was dirty (dried food). Food was okay, not the standard we're used to when they're on their game. Would not go back to this location."
Sherice H.,"Henderson, NC",260,64,186,4.0,12/18/2015,"Celebrating my sweetie's graduation from Bowie State University. I'm so proud of you baby.  As usual,  the food is great. The conversation is off da chain. The mai tai has the man talking his head off. This day was a long time on the making   Lol. I am just happy he is happy."
Amanda M.,"Alexandria, VA",0,7,,1.0,8/13/2016,"So just quick. I love this restaurant in general ,but I just had a very unpleasant experience here. It's 100 degrees and absolutely no one was or is going to use the out side space so in our wait I sat down. I'm 6 month pregnant and my feet and back are giving me issue if I stand for too long. I was told I could set there because it was for ordering costumers. I told the manager Martin and he could not careless. There was honestly one table that was sat for service. I would happily gotten up if it was full. But there was PLENTY of space for me to rest for a minute while waiting. So now I am standing with extreme pain rushing down my leg and swollen feet. Sorry I'm creating a child and just want to sit for a second while I wait to eat at your establishment.  Thank you for not caring on my birthday."
Amanda Z.,"Randallstown, MD",433,126,335,3.0,7/10/2015,Lemme say something about cheesecake factory. They should just seel cheesecake and they should be a drive through. No muss no fuss gimme my cheesecake and let me be.  I called to make a reservation the hostess told me they dont take them -__- thats funny because ive done it before. I thanked her waited 5 minutes called back hoping someone else would pick up and bingo reservation for 5 no problem smh I dont care for this chain too much nothing on the 20 page (which is a whole other issues. 20 pages?? For what) menu makes me need to come back except maybe their bread but i can get that at the bar where they serve me over priced sangria. Everything is just fine here. The food is fine. The drinks fine. The lighting always a tad too dark and the waiters in white which i always think if funny.  You handle food thats the worst color if you spill something.   But the cheesecake always saves them all those wonderful options. My favorite is the chocolate mousse. So beeline to the cheesecake display but dont bother staying for the unoriginal dining fare
Katie K.,"Elkridge, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Was so happy to learn about national cheesecake day yesterday and the great deal. I went in last night around 9:30 with one other person. We waited about 15 minutes before anyone came to our table only to did out it would be a 2 hour wait for cheesecake! That's crazy! We were informed that some people had been waiting 2.5 hours and still had not gotten their cheesecake. The restaurant was not completely full, as I have seen it much busier with better service on a Friday night.I am overall disappointed there was no manager or someone walking around apologizing for this inconvenience and offering some sort of compensation. Every table around us looked absolutely miserable, no one was even speaking to each other. I thought for sure Cheesecake Factory would have been more professional in their response to this situation. I do not think I will be returning to Cheesecake after seeing how this situation was handled and there is clearly no appropriate management."
Gabriel R.,"Cypress, TX",10,4,3,2.0,12/12/2015,"The cashew chicken is possible the most terrible meal I've had in a long time. It literally tastes like the chef dumped an entire jar of hoisin sauce, mixed in a bottle of soy sauce and the proceeded to add a handful of salt. The combination created a flavor that is neither spicy or robust, but rather overpowering and bland. The staff, was attentive and helpful though and the starter bread was pretty good.  Also the Jamaican shrimp was burnt. Overall, too expensive for lackluster food."
Mesha M.,"Washington, DC",5,52,83,3.0,11/21/2015,Large menu of classic American food and a variety of delicious cheesecakes. Something for everyone.  Love the avocado egg rolls!
Shakir T.,"Windsor Mill, MD",39,44,60,4.0,12/5/2015,Getting addicted to Thai Glazed salmon and made to order avocado extra spicy. Customer service is always good. They are fast friendly and very helpful well trained staff. They pack left over food. Weekends make sure to go early to make reservation
Christina K.,"Boston, MA",127,3,,1.0,7/29/2016,Utterly disgusted I ran out of there today with my family - the people next to use jumped up because ROACHES were crawling on their table. The manager said he'd get his pest control guy to check it out... In other words he knows they have a problem. And where there are a few roaches tons more follow.... Just gross. I will never eat there again. Not to mention the wait was terrible and the staff were gossiping before they even would hand us the wait timer... Get it together CCF!
Shani L.,"Alexandria, VA",213,141,884,4.0,9/18/2015,Great management and wait staff. I came in on a Friday at 6:30pm and put my name down for a party of 22. We were seated by 8:15. The wait staff were upbeat and efficient. No problems with the check or timing of food. This venue allows you to bring your cake with no fee. I would recommend for a large party.
Tiffany R.,"Columbia, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2016,Went to cheesecake to purchase a 7 in cheesecake and of course I expected it to be frozen a bit because they are already pre made. What I don't understand is why I waited so long to receive the cheesecake when all they had to do was put it in a bag. I literally watched 6 people that were after me receive their orders before me and the whole time my cheesecake was sitting in the back counter for an expensive cheesecake I expected better customer service. Very disappointed I had to wait almost 40 minutes.  Almost missing my dinner party event.
Ojaswi G.,"Pittsburg, CA",37,4,1,5.0,1/10/2017,"Good italian offering , don't order the tacos though but the food is great n great seting n interiors"
Heidi B.,"Columbia, MD",65,9,,1.0,5/9/2016,"ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS food and service!!! First time out in forever so my sons wanted to treat me to Mother's Day dinner. We even decided to come out Monday as opposed to the busiest day and were seated right away. Our server (Erica) hardly checked our table and when she did, never asked if we needed refills or how the food was. Mark, manager on duty was less than helpful and not understanding. He acted as though we were greatly imposing upon his time and offered little resolution. I WILL NEVER return here!!!! This used to be my favorite place too, ages ago. Things have surely changed. The prices got much higher, while the customer service and management got MUCH LOWER!!!  I would do a 1/2 of a star but that's not an option."
