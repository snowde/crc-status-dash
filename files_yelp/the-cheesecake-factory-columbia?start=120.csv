Gloria C.,"Laurel, MD",10,32,104,1.0,4/11/2016,"Last night my boyfriend and I came here after work which was around 9:20pm. I didn't get to eat at work and this was the only thing we could think of that would be open. We placed or orders and we were sipping on our drinks when my boyfriend found some odd white thing floating around in his drink. We told the server and she got us a new one. Great-it was fine. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer which was good. His factory burrito came out looking like an enchilada more than a burrito. Which is still fine. My fettuccine Alfredo came out. I took a small bite. I eat very salty.. But this wasn't even edible. Too damn salty. The server asked if I wanted Parmesan cheese which I responded yes then realized how damn stay it was and said no the pasta is salty as it is. She said oh should I get them to remake it and I said it was fine because I didn't want to be too annoying. At that exact moment I found pieces of broccoli in my pasta. This pasta doesn't come with broccoli... Which I then slightly moved the spoon (the spoon that comes on the side with all pasta dishes) guess what I found? A piece of withered leafy green. And it was a big one too. Lost my appetite. The server watched me unveil that SOB too. She was disgusted too. Did what she could, offered me a new one, a different dish, etc. but do you think I really want to eat after seeing that? I know I went in 40 minutes before closing time but isn't that ridiculous? I didn't even complain. Like who knows where those broccoli bits and withered leafy green came from?! From another dish? Maybe the plate itself was dirty? Was the spoon dirty? Was it even washed? Were they cleaning the back, getting ready to go and those bits happened to fly into my dish?! I don't know!! Yeah. No thanks. The manager came over saying ""oh I looked at your dish. What was wrong with it..?"" Lol I just looked at her and then explained what I had found in it.. She just offered a new dish to which I declined. That's it. Shitty management. Server did what she could. They took off the Alfredo off the bill. Obviously. Was totally disgusted. Definitely not acceptable. The server took the dish away as soon as we discovered those nasty bits. Didn't even get to take any pictures, that's how shocked I was. Anyways.. What a shit show. Will definitely take a lot for me to come back."
Jacob A.,"Norwalk, CT",84,2,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Okay so I'm sitting here right now... and my food was great, but half of my party has not received their food. Notice I said My food WAS great? I finished my meal and they still haven't brought out the food for any of the rest of my party. What could possibly be going wrong with your kitchen that you would deliver 6 out of the 12 plates we ordered, then inform us that the rest will be out soon... it's been 30 minutes... I'm embarrassed, we are a group of people that all run restaurants. The lack of attention from the manager on right now is really starting to make us frustrated.  I know that when there is a problem with a table it amplifies everything for the guest.  That being said, we didn't get refills on water, and one of our party ordered a second drink from the bar that never came, our plates never got pre-bussed off the table. Dessert comes slow, and we waited to pay.  By the end of the meal we just wanted to get out of this place but couldn't because we had to wait for everything. We made it clear we wanted to leave by taking the late food to go, and getting dessert to go, but those clues didn't speed anything up.  Whoever reads this, should note that a manager should be engaging with any table that has a problem, a meal this discombobulated should be taken care of through out the meal  by the manager."
Carolyn C.,"Baltimore, MD",342,293,974,5.0,2/4/2015,"My Mother and I came here last night after attempting to eat at Season 52 (45 minute wait and playing that annoying Disney Frozen soundtrack). We slipped right into two seats at the bar which was GREAT because if not we would have left due to the wait being another 45 minutes (yikes!). Our server was Sarah T. She was obviously the bar tender and was the ONLY bartender. My Mom and I watched her for the whole hour and half we were there, she was super crazy fast and knew everything by heart. She was amazing as was our food. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with a Cappuccino and my Mom had the Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls with a glass of Riesling. I am just now noticing that our check is wrong and that she charged us for the wrong wine which is a $1.50 more, however, she was such a good bartender that--eh who cares. The Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls have changed; they used to come out on a regular plate with sauce on the side. Now they are served doused in the sauce which takes up the whole plate with what seems like a whole head of red cut up cabbage. She still said it tasted the same but to me it just screamed waste of food. Who in their right mind will eat a whole head of red cabbage? Our food was yummy and we would come back--hopefully for happy hour!"
Natasha M.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,5,,2.0,6/6/2016,"I would give this a 1 star but because of some of the employees (like Gabby & Nadia), i wont. i'm not sure why this place cant get there salad orders right, but i swear 1 out of every 3 times they get it wrong! -yes i frequent here. this past time REALLY upset me.  I always call in ahead of time and order, then walk in to pick it up. i do this routinely now because i cannot trust them to bring my food to the car since i know it will most likely be wrong. they can never remember to give me the extra dressing i ask for. this particular time, instead of forgetting, they drenched the salad with dressing and put extra on the side! ummm..... this is CARRY OUT!!! by the time i go to where i was going, the salads would be mushy!!! dressing always goes on the side for carry-outs. then my salads came with iceberg, which i specifically asked for no iceberg, since they are kale & spinach salads. not sure when they started to make it look fuller by throwing in iceberg. i'm paying for kale and spinach, so that's what i should get. sad i have to request it, then still dont get it! they like to fill the container 25-40% so i always have to show them i noticed, and ask for more. crazy thing is, a lady standing next to me asked the manager if he took anything off my bill for all my trouble and he said no... she just stared at him (LOL) and then he walked away as fast as he could!!!!!! the employee named Gabby, saw/heard it, so she offered me a free piece of cheesecake! SHE is the only reason i calmed down. its sad an employee needs to do the managers job! and he is the SAME guy who has dealt with my wrong orders before and NEVER offers to compensate. i will get his name next time so i can post here. p.s. Gabby & Nadia - they deserve a 5 star!!!!! management SUCKS."
Marisol B.,"Clarksville, MD",1,7,2,1.0,8/27/2016,"Awful experience I am gluten and dairy free and my daughter was in town and wanted to go to the cheese cake factory.   The waitresses didn't have a clue.  My daughter was so upset she got up and found the manager ,  he wasn't much help either. He explained everything comes prepackaged so really the only thing I could eat was salad or sweet potatoes fries. And he wasn't sure about the fries  Horrible experience I was totally frustrated and my daughter was in tears."
Candice D.,"Alexandria, VA",165,75,55,4.0,3/19/2016,"Can you really go wrong here. People who go know the menu and they are pretty consistent. And service ha always been consistent as well. It's a reliable place to go when you can't figure out what you want and for the most part the food is good. It's not gourmet but it's satisfying. My go to plates: Tex-Mex egg rolls, Santa Fe chicken salad, chicken Madeira and shrimp scampi. And...for good measure a slice of key lime cheesecake."
Charles T.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,4,,1.0,10/19/2015,"In the famous words of John Maxwell, "" everything rises and falls on leadership."" Mark ( manager at the Cheesecake Factory in Columbia Mall, MD is not a good leader.  I approached him last night to express concerns about our service, and he simply walked away while I was in mid sentence. It wasn't extremely busy, therefore I was a bit perplexed as to why out waiter couldn't handle a very simple order that was read directly from the menu. 2 out of 4 meals ordered were completely wrong and I'm assuming because we sent them back, he decided to teach us a lesson.  After he disappeared for quite some time, he surfaced with a bill that he had to delete the orders that were never requested by my group. I asked to speak with Mark( manager on duty). I merely wanted to give some constructive feedback about the service. Mark's body language was priceless. He was very nonchalant and simply walked away. I will not spend my hard earned money at their establishment."
Anne H.,"Columbia, MD",6,3,,1.0,11/30/2014,"I don't write reviews but this place is trash!! I would chose to put no stars at all if i was allowed. I am never going back! Took my sister for dinner, asked the host for a small cake or sundae with candles for her birthday! It never came! It was such a failure no customer service at all too! Went to get some cake at the take out area instead 20mins waiting for a slice of cake! Guess what the server said? "" sorry that your waiting so long like all the other customers(big sarcasm and attitude)"" and did I tell you that the the manager was right beside him? Didn't even do anything! Useless! Let's just say you guys just lost a whole family of customers and were not coming back! You guys suck!"
Virgil G.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",8,17,11,1.0,6/21/2015,I'm at the Cheesecake Factory which is normally a good spot to eat. But for a holiday that they know they will be busy FATHER's DAY!!!! Their service is poor and the attitude of the management is horrible today as for the staff I kinda feel sorry for well not really. What I'm trying to say is this is the worst experience I've ever had at this place.
Ms B.,"Columbia, MD",6,60,25,3.0,6/20/2015,"I decided to take my daughter out to her favorite place. Cheers to the best kale salad I've ever had in my life. It is the only food I enjoyed. Tried something new off the menu but it was disgusting. They burned my sandwich. I never asked for well toasted bread.  Who would bring someone a burnt sandwich? Don't get me started on the fries. They were dry, salty and nasty. Why did it take over 30 minutes for two people to receive a Cuban sandwich, fries and a pasta dish.  Thank goodness my waiter had the Cuban sandwich removed from my bill. I just showed him what I received and he said, no problem.  I left feeling hungry and desiring something good to eat. I thought I had a chance on a Thursday afternoon when the place was rather empty but the food failed me."
Maria L.,"Laurel, MD",56,157,209,3.0,9/29/2013,"Blehh. Is not as good as it once was. Waiter was very slow and needed 2 other waiters to aid him. He never actually took our order, it was always someone different. When he did get me more water, he returned with a glass that had a straw in it, when my glass never had a straw to begin with it... Yuck Got rid of the Navajo Sandwich as well as the California Burger on the menu :( Won't be coming here anytime soon; quality is not the same."
Dimonique B.,"Bel Air, MD",0,48,5,1.0,1/17/2016,"Visited the night of 1/17/16. After receiving piss poor service from our waiter who I'm pretty sure was drunk or high, not only was our food bland and tasteless, but we also observed a roach as it crawled across our table. Our meal was comped once the manager brought out a form especially for situations like this, making such horrible dining experiences seem common place for this establishment. This was my first and last experience at the Columbia Cheesecake Factory location, as I am THOROUGHLY disgusted!"
Vik J.,"Fairfax, VA",5,15,,3.0,2/27/2015,"Went on a Tuesday night and it was super packed with a 30 minute wait. I'm not sure if that was normal for the area, but it is connected to a mall around a lot of neighborhoods, so it might be the area's go-to place for dinner. Staff was very attentive and came around a lot to see if we were doing ok and asking if we needed anything. Other than that, it's a typical Cheesecake Factory. Meh food with awesome cheesecake desserts. Appetizers are always better than entrees, so I would stick to more of those."
Abu B.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,36,18,1.0,10/26/2014,"Foolish me tried carry out again. It's fine to be busy and it's fine to have to wait, but the folks behind the counter are so crazy disorganized, they don't know what they're doing."
Bentley N.,"Laurel, MD",1,14,7,4.0,4/24/2016,Some of the seating is pretty bad. But the menu is quite decent and they have lots of options. And their cheesecake is outstanding. The quality is good
Richard M.,"Columbia, MD",41,17,6,3.0,8/5/2015,"So, my whole family loves The Cheesecake Factory. I have fallen in love with cheesecake since I first tried it in college and am now on a goal to make up for all of the opportunities I have missed out prior to my awakening. That being said, this onetime shining star of quality cuisine and service has become tarnished...at least at this location. First, the cheesecake is amazing and at this point no one can even question that. It is rich and creamy and without a doubt heavens streets are paved with it. This is also the only reason it get 3 stars. However, the service is no longer stellar. At a recent visit our waitress with 5 tables and only 3 filled was horrible. I ordered soup that was horrible, more on that later, and it sat in front of me for a good 10 minutes before she ever appeared to see if we were okay. She apologised for the food and took it off the bill but still. Then my friend ordered a pasta dish and waited about ten minutes to get some olive oil and cheese. She asked for no sauce and olive oil when she ordered. This is also not the first time, a week prior we waited 20 minutes for soup, hmmm maybe it is the soup, before the waitperson returned to say it would be another 30 minutes for soup. What? Now the food. Let's talk about the Chicken Tortilla Soup I ordered as an appetiser. Normally, The Cheesecake Factory has amazing soups...normally. This soup was wretched. First, it was more like day old oatmeal then soup in both consistency and taste than soup. Seriously canned soup would have been better. The taste was mealy and had the overwhelming taste of Corn Masa. There was no chicken to be found in the Chicken Tortilla Soup and it was garnished with a pool of grease and some corn. And the smell!  Even the patrons next to us were offended.  The Main dishes were good, although not as tasty as you would think. I had the combo Steak Diane and Chicken Marsala. The Steak Diane was wonderful but under seasoned. The Chicken Marsala was excellent but the Mashed Potatoes were cold clumpy and not good at all. Between the poor service and the not so great food, I feel like this once amazing establishment is on the decline. I will speak to a manager and try them again in a few months and update my review, but until then I would recommend take out cheesecake and dining some place else."
Sam F.,"Washington, DC",0,28,,1.0,10/19/2016,0 stars. WORST EXPERIENCE. We went out on a weeknight with a few friends for a birthday dinner. Was seated and ordered food- appetizer came out and then nothing for OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF. The manager later came and said they are understaffed. Come on
Mike W.,"Mt Airy, MD",7,84,7,3.0,4/8/2015,I love cheesecake and just order the cheesecake and come and pick it up and go home and have it. This place is a mad house and be prepared for long waits pretty much anytime that you would expect a place to be busy.
Deborah B.,"Laurel, MD",0,1,,1.0,6/13/2016,"THE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED.  The food sat under a warmer for far too long and when it finally came the plates were so hot, the server couldn't even get the plate to the far side of the booth without sliding it (no one could touch it).  The food was incredibly dry.  When mentioned to the manager she did nothing.  Furthermore, I ordered a beer...the server brought the wrong one (a clearly different beer), server took back the wrong one and brought a new one...but left both beers on the bill (until I complained!).  My son ordered a root beer and then asked for a water.  The server poured water into his cup with remaining root beer!!!! When I asked to speak to the manager a SECOND time to complain about the additional beer left on the check...again, she said (rather insincere), ""sorry that happened"".  Won't go there again!"
Chuck C.,"泰山區, Taiwan",5,3,4,1.0,3/24/2016,"Came here for some desert , the waiter walks by 20 times , and we Seat like 15 mins , nobody came to service , I think 1 star still too much to them ... Very bad experience"
