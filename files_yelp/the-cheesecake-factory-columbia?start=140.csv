Melissa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,183,,2.0,9/7/2014,"To begin with, I already don't like Cheesecake Factory, so that was already coloring my judgment going into it. I find the food to be overpriced and unremarkable. Yes, maybe it's because I'm snobby and live in New York City, where I can have a more wonderful culinary experience at half the price. But still, aside from the cheesecake itself, which is delicious, I do not recommend people eat here. But specific to my most recent trip, the hostess told us it would be a 5-10 minute wait. And then did not seat us until 30 minutes later. I don't like it when they undershoot. Next, our server was pretty nice, but when we ordered spinach and artichoke dip, the chips came out completely stale. Like to the point where we were worried we would chip our teeth on them. At this point, we tried to flag down our server, but she was nowhere to be found. There were DOZENS of servers working the floor looking exactly like her, but none of them were actually her. Why wasn't she checking up on us?  To add to this horrible experience, the food was terrible. The usual bland, stale, tasteless stuff I've come to expect from all Cheesecake Factories."
Josh G.,"Washington, DC",23,240,255,3.0,11/28/2014,"This location is fairly comparable to other Cheesecake Factory locations as far as food offerings and even quality, but the service tends to be sporadic and unreliable. As such, I find myself more partial to other locations."
Sheila P.,"College Park, MD",4,35,,5.0,1/12/2016,"vegetarians please listen: macaroni and cheese burger with a veggie patty, it's life changing also the californian guacamole salad is phenominal"
Sherri G.,"Hanover, MD",8,28,50,4.0,2/3/2015,Enjoyed the firecracker salmon and a glass of Riesling.  The bartender was awesome. She was all over the place making sure everybody was happy.  Walked right in and sat at the bar.  Lots of people waiting for a table.  Got lucky and found two seats at the bar.  Never go wrong with an order of the firecracker salmon.
Leigh M.,"Columbia, MD",87,91,26,4.0,1/4/2016,"Nothing unique about this place, but it's a good version of what it is. I hadn't been to a CF in years and we ended up there yesterday for lunch. It was just as I remembered, and everything was yummy, indulgent, and huge. I am glad I ordered the lunch size version of the Pasta Da Vinci. I was able to finish most of it and didn't feel guilty about not taking leftovers home because it was reduced in price. Our server was excellent."
Mang J.,"Redmond, WA",3,52,7,2.0,7/31/2014,"(Caveat: It's a truth universally acknowledged that The Ol' Mangaretta does not like chain restaurants.) A visit to the Cheesecake Factory equals mediocrity draped under the guise of quantity, but I am not easily fooled. Unfortunately, that's how every experience I've had at the factory usually ends. The only thing that varies wildly is the service. I've had some of the worst and some of the best service at several locations. During this last trip to the factory, it was only the stellar service provided by Amanda that kept this review from carrying a one-star rating. I think she should quit and open up a business where she teaches others how to provide exceptional service. At any rate, since I'm often outvoted by my pals, it's likely that I'll end up at the factory again. When I do, I hope Amanda's working so I can sit in her section. But...I don't care if they serve single portions that would take out Paul Bunyan and the Jolly Green Giant. The food just isn't good. Did someone lose the key to the spice cabinet? I don't want a bowl full of blah. Of all the dishes I've had at every location I've visited, there are probably two that are actually delicious--and that includes the cheesecake. While their cheesecake flavor concepts are wonderfully imaginative, the taste and texture of the cheesecake itself is similar to non-dairy whipped topping if it were thicker and somewhat creamier. Please, Cheesecake Factory, tweak your recipes to make them flavorful. So, two stars for the wonderful Amanda, who I hope harbors entrepreneurial dreams; and minus three stars for mammoth portions of blah food that's searching for its lost shaker of salt and other spices, and thickened Cool Whip for dessert."
AJ M.,"Burtonsville, MD",25,16,,4.0,6/21/2014,"If you are not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, the first thing I want to tell you is that if you don't like reading- don't come here. The menu is about ten dictionaries long, and split across several volumes like the Harry Potter series. When your server comes to ask if you've decided, you will literally burst out into maniacal laughter because you will only be twenty pages in and you're still looking at starter plates. Not to worry. Flip to a random page and point at something and odds are that it is delicious and there is a ton of it. Sarcasm aside, the selection of food here is diverse and extensive. If you don't know those two words, you are really going to have a hard to time with the menu here so you may consider bringing a tutor or some kind of speed-reader to help you along. They seriously have food from all cultures of the world, and even though you would think there's too many types of food for any of them to be great, they regularly excel in all areas. Portions are always immense and also gratifying if taking part of your meal home makes you feel less fat. I usually go for the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad because something about eating at Cheesecake Factory makes me feel like a hip young white woman. You might not encounter this issue, so dishes like Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp or the Factory Burrito are excellent choices as well. Appetizers like the Crab Wontons or Santa Fe Eggrolls are ridiculously good, but you probably won't find them in the labryinth of a menu. My bet is that you tap out around page 75 and ask the server what he recommends. Don't worry, it's foolproof. Just don't order a Glamburger. I don't know what it is but it sounds like something David Bowie would serve up at an under-21 foam party. If you leave without, at the very least, splitting a piece of Cheesecake- you are dooming yourself to a life without sun and joy. Trust me. You can count calories all day, but the torrent of endorphins your brain will release after one bite of Pineapple Upsidedown Cheesecake will be like a rain of a thousand orgasms. Just order it. If you're that worried, you can order a salad like I do so the waiter doesn't judge you when you finish the whole piece of cheesecake (he will anyway). As far as this specific Cheesecake Factory goes, the wait is long almost all the time. That's a good thing. It reaffirms your decision to come here because 45 minutes worth of other people thought coming here was a good idea too. The service has always been on-point and friendly for me, and if anyone else here got a different result, it's possible they ordered a Glamburger and it is effecting their mood. I took off a star because I can hear the waiter's thoughts when I eat the whipped cream pile after my cheesecake is gone. Stop judging me."
Dave M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",2,202,1,2.0,2/14/2015,"Tex-mex egg rolls were pretty good.  Tasty, temperature hot. Crab dip was acceptable. Happy Hour Long Island Iced Tea was great and a bargain at $5. Happy Hour Margarita was lousy. Roast Beef Dip sandwich was horrible.  Two tablespoons of gristly meat with a few onions and barely any cheese.  Big mistake. Vegetable salad was good. Mac & Cheese burger looked good but didn't taste it. Fries were undercooked despite my asking for them crispy."
Stewie G.,"Clearwater, FL",4,107,26,4.0,1/5/2015,"I want to give them a 3.5 versus 4, but alas 4 is how it goes. First time at this location, was busy but my girlfriend and I were in very quickly, only a five minute wait at 4pm on a Friday. We were sat at a very cramped area. The long banquet with tables for two, very close to the neighboring ones. This wouldn't be too bad for us but some very large patrons next to us bumped our table and their coats touched our food. Needless to say this was unappetizing. Space the tables a bit more please!  The food is typical of a chain. Satisfying but nothing to write home about. I got a steak which was a tad salty for my taste but cooked to the temp I wanted. My gf had a tuna salad, she was pleased. Ordered cheesecake to go. Service was attentive.  Parking at this mall is terrible, we used valet that day."
Christina O.,"Baltimore, MD",220,145,1315,3.0,11/7/2014,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times, however this is my first time here in Columbia mall. The food portion was smaller than Arundel Mills Cheesecake Factory. I had the Fettucine sundried tomatoes and chicken pasta--it was really greasy. The service was good--I prefer the Cheesecake Factory in Arundel Mills."
Jim D.,"Frederick, MD",3,6,,2.0,2/26/2016,While my wife's salad was excellent and the salads I've had before were also excellent I could not say that for the hamburger and french fries I had today. I asked for the hamburger to be medium well it was medium rare. The french fries while very cool in temperature also tasted worse then any fast food french fries I've ever tasted. Certainly not worth the expense.
Doris L.,"Suitland, MD",2,34,131,5.0,1/3/2016,"A little wait, however, Nathan our server was attentive and efficient.. I had the bacon bacon burger, son had chicken sandwich and hubby had fried crab balls and stuffed mushrooms.  Alcoholic beverages were on point."
April P.,"WOODBINE, MD",0,15,6,1.0,7/5/2015,"The food is horrible.   Not surprised, given the large menu, there is no way they can make anything fresh.  My MIL asked for her crab cake grilled or broiled and was told the only option would be fried --- obviously bc it's frozen.  The food was bland and pitiful.  We did get a piece of cheesecake which we shared between 7 of us and that was fine given it would have been too rich for anyone to eat by themselves and not hurl.  And I hate, HATE this stupid family style seating.  Who wants to sit on top of strangers while they are eating??   This franchise needs to get it together."
Got I.,"Washington, DC",0,36,1,1.0,8/9/2014,"I hate this location. The food is terrible, service is slow, and no parking at all. I've had the same exact meal turn out well at other cheesecake locations and really gross here. Go to Towson or Arundel Mills instead.  If you want to end up with diarrhea and an upset stomach. Go here. Something isn't kosher in the kitchen at this location."
Hana K.,"Columbia, MD",18,41,2,5.0,12/14/2014,"As a regular at Cheesecake Factory, they can never disappointed me. Excellent customer service.   They never say no of how I want my food to be done. (I'm very picky) Curbside To-go are awesome.  They basically bring the food out to me while I'm in my car. Awesome."
H L.,"Rockville, MD",0,8,,5.0,2/6/2016,"This location is always busy when we dine here, yet we love their food and services. Even though the last time we went here a waitress who helped with other tables brought out the wrong dish for my order, the person who took my order did apologize later which was fine. It happens! (I always feel a tad weird making someone bring a dish back or telling them my order was wrong because it may get someone else in trouble. :/) It's funny how often my order goes wrong when I'm so hungry! :P The waiter always checked back on us which we really appreciated and overall we always like going here for dinner! :) We always buy cheesecake from here to munch on! They're delish :) (Sometimes we just stop by here just to pick up cakes)"
Joseph W.,"Columbia, MD",75,229,48,3.0,8/28/2014,"I like my cheesecake factory. Its in my neighborhood. Love the blueberry mojito. texmex egg rolls, chicken sliders, and cheese cake is the only thing I eat out of there. My only complaint is that i have to continue to tell them to not sit me by the kitchen and bathroom"
Kevin B.,"Riverdale Park, MD",28,9,7,4.0,4/21/2014,"I had been working at The Cheesecake Factory for about 2 weeks before I actually decided to eat there. My girlfriend and her roommates have eaten there before and told me numerous times how great the food was so they took me out once for a small celebration. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Hibachi Steak Entrees. Both were delicious! The steak was cooked exactly how I requested it and presentation of the food was good as well. Our waiter took good care of all four of us and was very patient since we ordered a lot and I'm really indecisive at new restaurants. I also had a slice of Original Cheesecake. I had never eaten Cheesecake before and decided why not try some at a place known for great dessert? Needless to say I ended up loving Cheesecake and I pick up a slice every now and then after my shifts. So far, the Original is still my favorite but the Banana Cheesecake is pretty good as well. I am definitely a fan of The Cheesecake Factory franchise!"
Garima C.,"Rockville, MD",19,258,292,3.0,9/29/2015,"I like the fried avocado, mushrooms and zucchini. I never thought of frying an avocado but then again, anything deep fried is always going to taste good. Eggplant parmigiana was good , although I liked the pesto pasta on the side, more. The spicy chicken pasta as well as the spicy Guacamole wasn't 'spicy' in the real sense, but good."
Ashley S.,"Frederick, MD",0,2,,1.0,3/24/2016,"I wish I could give zero stars, this place was absolutely disgusting.  We arrived at our table after about an hour waiting to see that all the utensils and plates were nasty and covered in food.  My plate had a whole thing of butter stuck on the bottom.  The food was alright but it made my brother sick and he even threw up when we got home.  Not to mention that there was MOLD in my moms ice cream.  When we went to confront the manager he was so rude and acted like he didnt care.  Waste of money and time"
