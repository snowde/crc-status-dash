Haleigh R.,"Columbia, MD",2,29,4,5.0,10/18/2014,This is my go to place! They have everything and anything you can think of when it comes to food.  That's probably why I enjoy it because of such a variety of items on their menu.  Not to mention the desserts are always delicious!
Ricky S.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,6,1,1.0,6/5/2016,"I never thought I would have to review cheesecake factory I mean it's one of the best right however went there with my family last night for dinner for my birthday I got my usual drink which cost $10 completely water down One of my daughters got the Baja chicken tacos no flavor dry chicken my other daughter got some chicken dish with pasta and fried chicken on top with no flavor or bland no seasoning my wife got a chicken and shrimp dish they screw that up to it took them 20 minutes to make it and the shrimp was like rubber my chicken and shrimp Cajun jambalaya which is their signature dish was overcooked it was like mush. Terrible shame on you,because the kind of prices you  charge your food should  live up to"
Jenn L.,"Clarksville, MD",0,115,,5.0,9/29/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory! It's just you have to watch out for the waits. But other than that, the food is delicious. Sometimes, the service is a hit or a miss."
Sridhar K.,"Marriottsville, MD",0,9,1,2.0,10/20/2015,Very frustrating about waiting in lobby. I called ahead they mentioned that we don't take reservations. It sounded as if they have enough tables to host everyone. Suggestion to start accepting reservations.  Good food. Service is mediocre. Had to ask waiter to refill water couple of times. I think waiters have too many tables to handle.
David M.,"Ocean Pines, MD",0,29,,2.0,6/22/2016,"First time here. Took 10 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge us. The nachos were fantastic. My meal comes out alone. I'm half way through my meal and my wife's meal comes out. The waitress claims they are waiting on a meatball for my son's meal. Another 10 minutes later his meal comes out.  Never seen 3 meals come out so speratic. The waited never acknowledged this was a problem.  Never said sorry,  nothing. I was unimpressed by the whole thing. I only gave 2 stars for the nachos."
Crystal L.,"Columbia, MD",37,91,137,2.0,4/17/2015,"Usually I have nothing bad to say about the Cheesecake Factory, so my last visit took me totally by shock! My fiancé ordered the burrito, the burrito is humongous and drizzled with sauces and cheese. After waiting about 45 minutes for it the first thing I noticed is a big long black piece of hair baked into the cheese. We alerted the hostess who brought it out and she said oh I will send the manger over. Once he came over and saw it , he asked ""would you like me to remove this wrap and stuff your fixings into a new wrap?"" WTH??? Are you kidding me? You might as well just pull the hair out and say all better it's gone now! Who would want the inside fixings of a burrito with a baked hair in the cheese???? I was sooo surprised by his response I lost my appetite. Hoping something like this never happens again. We were really shocked, as Cheesecake Factory usually does no wrong!"
Jamal B.,"Columbia, MD",45,3,,1.0,6/20/2016,I live close so my wife and I call curbside to order from time to time. No only do they take forever to answer the phone they pick up the phone and hang up! I hate to say this but it's simply not worth the poor customer service!
Katie R.,"Washington, DC",0,9,1,4.0,11/11/2015,"I needed a good place to have brunch on a Sunday with a good friend from out of town, and this was perfect.  Plenty of seating and we could take our time without feeling the brunch crowd rush.  I had the Brule French Toast with bacon which was delicious."
Rachel C.,"Columbia, MD",0,5,,1.0,8/18/2015,"I had already ate dinner and I was just here for desert, but my family came to eat dinner. Not only did their dinner come late, but also my dessert came 1 hour late. I was very disappointed by their service. I ONLY ordered a slice of cheesecake."
Anam J.,"Ellicott City, MD",6,15,,4.0,8/27/2015,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory ever since it opened. The food is usually pretty good! My favorites on the menu are the Louisiana chicken pasta, the crab cake sandwich and for dessert the strawberry shortcake.  The service is also great! For the amount of times I have visited this establishment ,which to be honest , is close to almost 50-60 times I have had complaints only a handful of times. When those complaints were brought to a managers attention, they took pretty good care of me and always did something to make up for it. Definitely a great place to eat and I would recommend it."
Tamara W.,"Laurel, MD",6,120,,1.0,10/28/2013,"We were starving and so we decided to go to TCF for their huge portions and delicious food. We were not greeted politely by the reservation desk personnel, they just looked and blinked at us without asking what we needed.  It was around 3 p.m., and the place was not that crowded, yet we were seated in a crummy corner near the kitchen. The waitress took forever to come over. She was curt, polite, but not very attentive and I had to beg for water and wait for her to be near to ask for another napkin.  The biggest disappointment and I was shocked about this one: the food.  I ordered the meatloaf which comes with mashed potatoes and succotash. The meatoaf was not tasty and had a huge amount of filler/bread so the texture was weird, potatoes were bland and too lumpy even for the rustic type, the succotash was fine, at least the corn was fresh. My friend's food was mediocre and we were very disappointed in what we thought would be a delicious meal.  My son's cheesecake was just not tasty at all. It might have been that they changed distributors and are cutting corners in terms of quality of ingredients, or maybe the cooks are not cooking the food correctly, or both---whatever the reason TCF has truly gone down the tubes. I will think twice before I dine there again.  I will certainly not go to the Columbia location again."
Quin A.,"Silver Spring, MD",15,185,377,4.0,5/2/2015,"Overall had a nice dinner last night with my family and the boss's family. Took about 10 minutes to find parking and another 40 minutes before we got a table. The place was packed. First ordered drinks. Strawberry lemonade and piña colada  were very good. The lemonade was a little too sweet though. Then ordered sliders for appetizers and they were awesome as usual. We got enchiladas and salmon, respectively. Food took a long while to arrive at the table. Enchiladas were perfect and piping hot. Salmon was served with mashed potatoes and both were cold. The waitress brought a replacement plate of hot mashed potatoes so that remedied the situation a bit. The complementary bread and butter they served was also good. We were so full after drinks and appetizers that had to take most of entrées to go. Also got dessert to go, mango cheesecake, which was also good but going with another flavor next time. And, the waitress was friendly enough."
Ma-e M.,"Baltimore County, MD",0,1416,569,3.0,4/12/2014,"I'm quite impressed with the Asian food service person who attended our table for office luncheon. She knows how to give excellent service. Cheesecake Factory's menu can get confusing, but she helped us understand and navigate the variety of food. She knows the menu very well and will give the detailed description of each food. As always the ambiance feels like happiness and fun décor. The lunch special Miso Salmon was delicious and finished the plate right away. The salmon with teriyaki sauce was not too sweet and the miso sauce around the brown rice was very good. Surprise that it's called lunch special, $14 when portion looks like it can be served during dinner."
Desiree C.,"Windsor Mill, MD",17,21,21,4.0,7/30/2014,"Swift, friendly n attentive waitress!!  They have a huge and complete skinnylicious menu ."
Katie S.,"Woodbine, MD",111,170,68,4.0,11/26/2013,"Yummy food today - fried zucchini, margarita flat bread, hummus and pita, beets with goat cheese, house salad. Table/utensils were dirty!! But waiter brought us all new quickly. We were there early so we ate fast!! Waiter, Alan, was awesome!"
Anthony W.,"Essex, MD",0,8,,5.0,5/7/2016,Awesome experience as usual.  Our server was excellent.  They were very crowded and wait time was between 30-45 minutes.  They always have great portions!
Maria B.,"Seattle, WA",158,329,34,2.0,11/25/2013,"Went last Friday night with a friend- wait was over an hour and the bar area is first come, first served. I really think they should start accepting reservations here because by the time you get your table you are so pissed you don't want to look through a 30 page menu with ads in it . The portions are huge and the food really isn't all that good. The front hostesses are so sassy and rude too!"
Sandy P.,"Baltimore, MD",19,26,3,2.0,12/14/2013,"The SkinnyLicious Menu is a SHAM!!! The Cheesecake Factory used to be such a special treat to enjoy every now and then.  Especially, after going to the movies or shopping at the mall.  When I started eating more healthy, I was so glad to hear about their SkinnyLicious Menu.  What a total sham!  The selections on the SkinnyLicious Menu are just has greasy as regular entrees.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken and asked for steamed vegetables on the side with NO added oil or butter... Both came out to the table drenched in oil and butter.  What a HUGE disappointment!  I had to send it back.  I guess if you're going to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, there are NO healthy options, although they make that claim with their SkinnyLicious Menu. Also, the customer service by some of the wait staff is sometimes good, but the past few times I visited it was terrible."
Sunshine B.,"Elkridge, MD",9,62,18,4.0,4/24/2015,So good. The best thing about the meal was knowing that the dessert would phenomenal. My husband got the gumbo. His only wish was that they used jasmine rice instead of white. I had the carbonara. I'm perfectly pleased. Lemon meringue cheesecake!  Best think on earth. Very pleased. My only complaint was that the music was WAY too loud. I couldn't hear myself think and the people sitting beside us were yelling over the music all night which was annoying. It was too loud to have any kind of decent conversation.
Carlie W.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,2,,1.0,12/24/2014,Ordered a cheesecake for the holidays and they gave me the wrong one. When I called to let them know they acted like they had no record of the transaction in their system and made it very difficult to return. Never using them again!
