Donna Y.,"Clarksville, MD",172,509,309,2.0,12/30/2011,"I've been here only a couple times but they don't accept reservations so waiting is definite especially when there are 6 people in your group. Their menu is almost like a novel, they have an option for everyone. It looks like they have a new portion on the menu (i dont know exactly how new this is but it's new to me!) the skinnylicious part which has pretty slim pickings. The calories show in this section ranges between 500-700 calories which is pretty depressing and I just imagine how many calories are in their other dishes? Pretty gross. Anyways, I ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich and I am actually quite surprised it tasted alright. I'm not a big fan of bacon but this dish comes with it just ask your server if the chef can remove the bacon. It comes with a side order of salad (meh). For dessert we ordered the red velvet cake cheesecake which was simply divine (1200 calories/slice). I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but I do enjoy more cake than cheesecake so this choice in dessert was perfect with 50/50. The slices are huge so it can be shared with two people maybe even three.  In total, I walked out having eaten near 1500 or so calories in one meal... i feel so gross."
Penny K.,"Germantown, MD",9,4,,1.0,5/30/2015,"Very disappointed in my lunch today.  It was supposed to be my birthday celebration and things were so bad we left before cheesecake!!  My father ordered an eggplant dish which he could not eat.  I usually love the factory omelettes , but the eggs looked funny today, and not much taste.  Our salt shaker was jammed and we asked for a new one.  The waiter took a few steps away and returned with the same shaker.  I used to really enjoy eating at this Cheesecake Factory, but today was really bad!!"
Brittny D.,"Catonsville, MD",16,7,4,5.0,4/29/2015,"I didn't realize they had happy hour at this location. I tried the fried mac and cheese and the sliders. They were both delicious. And I love the J.W.'s pink lemonade! The bartenders changed shifts seamlessly, and the drinks were strong!"
Melanie R.,"Ellicott City, MD",151,193,59,1.0,4/18/2013,"You know, at one time, I probably went to Cheesecake Factory several times a year. Tonight I think will be my last visit, unless I run in and get a dessert slice to go. I think maybe I have matured past this terrible chain, and its factory worker feel. The  menu is out of control. It is way too complex and long....the choices and food variety is almost over the top. I learned from watching those Food tv shows that restaurants should keep the menu to a page or two and do it really well! Cheesecake Factory executives must have missed that business advise.  Lets talk about noise level....the way the tables are positioned, you are literally on top of your neighbor. At several points in the meal, I covered my ears. It was like high school cafeteria. I kept hearing about three or four conversations all around me. I even learned that the lady a few tables down hated sleeping with her husband Greg. Anyway, point being it is so distracting you can't even enjoy your food. So my days at all Cheesecake Factories are over. Ten years ago you were the bomb, and I remember waiting at the Inner harbor for two hours just to get a seat! Those days are far gone...sad to say."
Jean G.,"Columbia, MD",0,23,,2.0,9/8/2014,"I have never been a fan of this place, and I've visited it more than a handful of times since it opened. If you come during off-peak times it's not bad. The food is decent although a little pricey. If you are stupid enough to come when it's busy you have to wait an insanely long time only to sit in an extremely loud and crowded room where you have to shout to talk to people at your table.  The last time I went there was last year (literally, it was the final time I am going there) the person next to us started having ""words"" with the manager, something about her pancakes being undercooked, and since we were about an elbow's length away we had no choice but to sit there in silence as the entire scene (about 30 minutes worth) played out. It was so awkward and uncomfortable. The manager insisted that her food had been cooked properly even though the waitress had already agreed with her that it was undercooked and offered to bring her something else, but after being confronted by the manager she insisted on paying her tab and leaving. The manager had the guts to stand next to her table and say ""No, I assure you, we would never give out raw food"" instead of just apologizing and comping the meal. What was even the point of the manager coming by - to fight for the cost of her plate of pancakes?"
Christina H.,"Glen Burnie, MD",1,1,1,4.0,11/8/2013,"The food was good and so was the service. I always order the Spicy Cashew Chicken, but I had second thoughts when the person at the table next to me complained and said their Spicy Cashew Chicken was too salty. What I had was seasoned right so I didn't think it was salty tasting. I would get the same entree again. Maybe should have skipped the glass of wine and got a cheesecake slice for dessert instead."
M J.,"Beltsville, MD",52,168,300,3.0,12/30/2013,"Nice location with ample parking. The service was unremarkable (not as good say, as the local IHOP.) I had a chimichanga meal that was quite tasty. The execution of their services & the experience they offer for what they charge is better suited for takeout meals versus a sit down restaurant, which is how I rated them."
Kristin G.,"Laurel, MD",2,18,2,2.0,2/27/2016,We used to come here all the time and the service was great. Its been a few months now I'm celebrating my birthday and we waited at the bar for 20 minutes before anyone even greeted us. Then the server finally comes over and asks if we want lunch? If course we do! It's 12:15p !! Then she asks if we want bread! No duh I want bread that's part of what i come here for. Right after she leaves to get our drinks another couple sits in the bar area next to us and they get greeted immediately from another server!
Becca H.,"Abingdon, MD",43,262,172,4.0,11/10/2013,"As I've stated in previous reviews, I'm not generally a chain restaurant fan. Cheesecake Factory is one of the few exceptions. This particular Cheesecake Factory is a little more crowded than others I've been to...45 min wait to sit. But then again, it was a Saturday approaching 5:00 and during holiday season, so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. As far as food goes, I've never been disappointed by any Cheesecake Factory. I always try to order something different. This particular time I got the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious - the salmon was nice and flaky in a nice lemon butter sauce, the mashed potatoes were flavorful, the asparagus was so-so...a little bland. But overall it was great. Our waitress (can't remember her name) was superb. Very friendly and attentive, even on a super-packed, super busy Saturday night. In hindsight, I probably won't ever go back during such a busy time."
Stacey K.,"Columbia, MD",0,22,,5.0,2/18/2016,"Love their avocado egg roll and of course their cheesecakes! They have very good customer service each and every time I go. Sure, there's always a wait and they don't take reservation but their Chinese lettuce salad and chicken lettuce wraps are well worth it."
Lauren A.,"Laurel, MD",377,10,2,1.0,2/28/2015,Everything was going fine until we received our waters. First we noticed a brown smudge on the cup...not sure what it was. Then after further inspection we noticed someone's bobby pin was floating at the bottom of the cup. It was absolutely disgusting. The manager was nice and apologetic and took care of our entire bill. I will definitely be checking my glasses from now on
Michael R.,"Baltimore, MD",39,30,,2.0,1/20/2015,"Please someone come over and tell me that I'm not going crazy or imagining things. How in the world is this place packed to the gills on most nights of the week? The atmosphere is great, but three quarters of the entrees taste like paper. It's like eating cafeteria-style food in a trendy upscale restaurant. When you factor in the parking situation and wait times on weekend evenings I simply just don't get what all the craze is about."
Amy P.,"Elkridge, MD",22,128,274,3.0,7/24/2013,"The food at Cheesecake Factory is consistent and portion size is huge. The food always comes out pretty good. I usually get either Bang Bang Chicken, Chicken Marsala, Hichachi Steack or Miso Salmon. They're all great dishes. My only complaint with the Cheesecake Factory is that the wait is too long. Every time I go it's almost always close to an hour wait. That's usually the case with any Cheesecake Factory location I go."
Q L.,"Columbia, MD",4,16,,3.0,5/9/2013,"Good food, big portions. However, it is crowded and loud, and there is ALWAYS a really long wait, which makes it not worth coming. Bought a whole cheesecake once, and they gave it to me frozen which was questionable..."
Katherine B.,"Hollywood, FL",93,79,64,3.0,1/30/2013,"Typical cheescake factory! Took my son here after school for cheescake and coffee (for me). Happy hour specials on food are great prices ($5). The cheese bites were really good, fontina instead of moz, i believe. Cheese seemed smoother and a little nuttier. I really enjoyed. Waitress was attentive. I'd come back, just not a huge fan of chain restaurants tis all."
Jamika A.,"Columbia, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/14/2016,"I have been going to the Cheesecake factory for a while and I'm just feed up. My last experience was the straw that broke the camel,s back. I have been ordering take out lately to avoid the crowded restaurant and it's been a disaster every time. This last time, I called my order in around 7pm, was told it would be ready in 15-20 mins I get there about 25-30mins later and call to have the food brought out to me. 20 mins after calling to say I'm outside, my food still hasn't come out. So I go in and they can't find my food. After waiting another 10 mins they guy bring my food. I pay and leave. I get home to discover that half of my order is missing. I call and speak to the manager (who took my initial order, so he remembered me) who says the check is still open and he would remove the charge. Dummy me believe him.. just checked my bank and of course the charge was not removed. If this had only happened once, I wouldn't be writing this review.. but they have consistently messed up my orders and lied when saying charges would be removed. Such a shame"
Julia H.,"Woodstock, MD",1,48,,4.0,2/12/2016,One of my all time favorite restaurants and I am not a big chain restaurant person.  I love their food but HATE the wait.  It's especially bad because the movies are right next door so you can't plan to eat there unless you get there 2 hours early if you are seeing a movie.  We try and if we can't get in we go to Champs.
Phi N.,"Glenmont, MD",104,867,3259,3.0,9/3/2010,"The menu's soooo big! It gives me a headache everytime trying to decide on what to order. On top of that, they give you like a billion specials and menu updates. We started lunch off with calamari, which is always good anywhere I get it. I just love calamari I guess. I got the farm range burger for my meal. Probably one of the best things I've ever ordered from cheesecake factory. Usually I'm not a big fan of this place, but this burger was all right. Cooked well, came with some sort of bacon (not the crispy type), and and egg on top. it was too thick to bite into though. I had to cut it. Which is kind of weird... who eats a burger with a fork and knife??? Fries were really good, really salty... I like that high blood pressure! It's the only test I score high on!"
Jessie J.,"Manhattan, NY",55,107,231,5.0,1/4/2013,One thing everyone knows about me is that I HATE CHEAP DRINKS ! I've been the cheesecake factory many times and one thing I can tell you is that they have one of the best mojitos I've ever had in my life.
Airy K.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"I have been there many times and never had this problem...It is infested with roaches!!! Also outside ofthe building their are rats! Most people are too busy talking to see this it is so gross. I saw 5 roaches inside on the table next to us and 1 on ours!!! Scurrying across the plates!It ruined my mom's birthday we left after waiting 45 minutes to get a table!!! Me the table next to us and another table left because there were roaches everywhere so nasty. The manager offered to have the pest control guy to pay for the bill so they know that they have a problem!!! The lighting is also so dark in there that there are probably more but most people can't see them!!!! If you see one roach there is always more!!! Then seeing rats popping out of the trashcans  outside! They're were a whole bunch I saw at least 7! They were big fat rats too! But the other people were too busy talking to see them!!!I am so disgusted! I've eaten there before and they really do have great food but the fact they have roaches I will NEVER eat there a again, such a bummer!!!Ive known that they had a rat problem but that was on the outside but now they have roaches too on the inside running across ur food and ur plates on the chairs cover up your purses thank God a roach didn't get in mine!!! Beware!! Health and hygiene comes before good food! Since they have so many rats outside I bet that they're inside the building too!!!Do not eat here unless you want a sauted roach!!!! Go to red lobster they have better food for cheaper and no roaches!!!"
