Ned F.,"Washington, DC",0,129,,1.0,11/16/2013,"i ordered fish and chips, and had a few bites of my kid's mac and cheese and my stomach (10 hours later) is cramping up so bad at 4:30am. It's 5am right now and I can't fall back asleep and just went to the bathroom."
Harith D.,"Baltimore, MD",19,17,5,1.0,9/8/2013,"So, two of my friends love the Cheesecake Factory in Rockville, and one of them really likes the one in Columbia, so when they were hungry, we stopped by around 11 on our way to Ellicott City.   Rather than explain what we ordered and how it was, let me jump right to the end of the meal.  My friends wanted to give a good tip to the waiter, as he was extremely friendly and warm in personality, even though he was rather slow in stopping by our table, despite the restaurant being strangely empty.  They insisted on paying for the bill and then giving the tip directly to waiter, explaining that the service was good but that the food was exceptionally sub-par compared to other Cheesecake Factory visits. His response?  Sorry, we have new cooks.   New cooks?  This is a well known chain restaurant.  People come here for known dishes of a known quality, and they pay rather highly for that along with a moderately upscale ambience.  The cooks need to perform regardless of how old or new they are, that's why they train them.   The only good explanation would have been if all the cooks were out at once and the waitstaff were forced to cook and some half-senile man was forced out of retirement to oversee the cooking.  Then perhaps we could have commiserated over his sad failure rather than the failure of this restaurant."
Charles F.,"Pasadena, MD",4,34,,3.0,10/19/2013,"This place is pretty normal, run of the mill, cheesecake factory.  The service is always ""ok"", nothing to write home about.  Friends and I will meet here occasionally for food and a good laugh.  The one thing that gets annoying is, as it gets dark outside, they all of a sudden dimmed down the lights in the restaurant. Like, absurdly dark. Crossing the line from mood lighting to ""someone could cop a feel."""
Carolyn J.,"Ellicott City, MD",25,84,48,4.0,4/19/2014,"I always order the same thing. The Santa Fe Salad but with ranch instead of the spicy peanut dressing (sorry peanut should be eaten as a snack or put with chocolate, not as a dressing on salad). I decided to do something different this time and went with meatloaf with corn succotash?  It's a nice helping of meatloaf as any dish you get there. Three pieces at least. If you like black pepper, there's plenty of it in the meatloaf, a little too much for my liking, (I'm not a big salt & pepper person, I grew up not using it) and there are plenty of caramelized onions on top. The mashed potatoes were not bad. I decided to take the meal home though since I wasn't really liking it (someone else could eat it) and it wasn't something I would send back & ordered my usual, Santa Fe Salad.  I've never had any problems with the restaurant. I do think the tables are too close together though. And it can get loud. But I enjoy going."
Paul W.,"Columbia, MD",0,6,,1.0,5/25/2014,I got a single Yuengling draft beer here and it ended up costing me $12 after a $2 tip. I don't think I'll be getting anything to drink here from now on. PF Chang's around the corner has the same beer for $4 vs Cheesecake's $10. Your local liquor store also has the same beer for $7 in a six pack.
Robin G.,"Bethesda, MD",88,434,218,4.0,3/16/2014,We had a great brunch there today! I had the Elvis Style Belgian waffle with peanut butter and bananas and bacon!!!! Delish!!!!!! Good service and good food!
Blake H.,"Baltimore, MD",8,5,1,5.0,6/3/2014,"Ate here for dinner on 6/2/14. Had wonderful service from Erica or Erika. Not sure which way she spells it. Started off with waters and Factory Nachos. I ordered a Raspberry Lemonade which is SO worth the $4.50. My friend (who is 21) ordered a glass of Red Sangria that is $11. (Erica also properly asked to view her ID). She said it was amazing. We both ended up ordering the Skinnylicious Shrimp Tacos. They were delicious as well and served with escabeche vegetables. We then for desert got both the Godiva and Key Lime Cheesecake. No complaints. Food great, awesome server, and great atmosphere outside."
John S.,"Columbia, MD",82,78,1,2.0,4/20/2011,"I don't get it.  Why are cheese cake factories constantly packed?  Is it the over-priced food?  Is it the fact that they cram tables into a section like sardines in a can?  Is it the non-authentic food that is just average at best?  (Seriously, something is wrong with a restaurant that has Mexican, Italian, Thai, and American food all on the same menu.)  Is it the waiters/waitresses that are so concerned about turning your table over as quickly as possible that they give you the least amount of interaction possible to get at least 15%? The only reason I can fathom is the cheesecake is really, really good.  However, you can just order that to go.  So why the hell do people flock to this place like its a 5 star joint?  I guess there are two things I will never know:  why the Cheesecake Factory does so well and what the meaning to life is."
Kathy M.,"Washington, DC",38,104,,4.0,3/2/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, the food is always pretty good. I will admit that this isn't my favorite location, but it's still decent."
Pamm P.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",7,74,46,4.0,7/11/2013,Come for the happy hour and 5$$ menu. You can't go wrong at the Cheesecake. Friendly attentive service. Fresh plentiful food. A yes we can attitude . Enjoy
None Y.,"Columbia, MD",0,4,,4.0,5/31/2015,"The gumbo was amazing, I got it with just shrimp and it was phenomenal. My waitress was awesome, I don't recall her name, and the lemon meringue cheese cake was perfect"
Lil Y.,"Columbia, MD",62,82,6,4.0,1/22/2012,"I seriously LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Although sometimes the service is bad, it's kind of worth it. I order take out quite often as well and it's the same quality of food.  I absolutely love their Louisiana Chicken Pasta! So good! And I have a couple of other favorites as well! The only downside is that they don't take reservations. Love it if they did!"
Frank G.,"Severn, MD",39,301,4,1.0,1/20/2011,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to, but I have the feeling that if I've eaten at one, I've eaten at them all. To say this place has no soul is an understatement. The food and decor are entirely devoid of any authenticity whatsoever. It's a restaurant designed by a committee... and most of the food tastes like it was cooked by one too. My first thought after flipping through the menu -- which for some bizarre reason contains advertisements (huh?) -- was there was no way they could do a good job cooking that many different types of food. Turned out I was right. They ""make up"" for the complete lack of culinary skill by giving you portions suitable for sumo wrestlers... as if giving you more of something bad is a good thing. Pile on high prices, long wait times, and slow service (even for weekday lunches), and I'm just not seeing the appeal of this place. Oh, and despite the name, the cheesecake isn't any good either."
Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3758,414,2038,2.0,8/14/2011,"Gorgeous building, ideal location.   Most people would probably agree that it's not called the ""Cheesecake Factory"" for nothing.  Great variety on their cheesecakes and for the most part, they taste wonderful. Problem is the rest of their menu is filled with poorly conceptualized and executed items.  You add that with long waits and a staff that is largely underwhelming and....PF Changs a few steps away doesn't look so bad.  Only thing that keeps it from a 1 is the cheesecakes themselves.  Maybe they should just be a bakery........"
Mary M.,"Lewisville, TX",98,285,77,4.0,11/12/2013,Good restaurant with large menu offering many different types of food. They have a reduced calorie menu which is helpful if you're watching your weight. They also have seasonal cheesecake flavors. They often have a long wait on the weekends and at night so plan your visit strategically.
Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,102,29,4.0,11/26/2013,Better service than White Flint
Sue S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,37,,4.0,8/9/2012,"We are Cheesecake Factory aficionados, having visited quite a few of them in all parts of the country.  Therefore, we are used to the long wait times that is typical for many locations, so that is not a factor in this review. We just moved to the area recently, and have visited this location 3 times so far.  It's pretty good for the most part.  The chicken piccata, steak diane and salads were all excellent, but the chicken marsala was not up to the usual standards the night we had it. Service was mostly good, except when we had the server in training. The music was a bit too loud. The cheesecake was divine, as always."
Starr C.,"McLean, VA",128,294,427,3.0,8/15/2011,"I was here Saturday for lunch with my roommates. Wait time was about 20 minutes, so not too bad considering it was Saturday. We got seated and yeah, it's a bit squished, being that close to the other tables. I just have to remind myself that if there were less tables more spaced apart, the wait time would be more ridiculous than usual. Our waiter was pretty attentive even though his section was really busy. We ordered and the bread was a bit slow coming out, but again, it was pretty busy. Not totally sure how fast our food came out, because we were catching up and talking a lot, but it didn't seem like a very long wait. I got the chicken salad sandwich (it comes with almonds) with side of green salad. Was pretty big, for which I'm glad because you know Cheesecake Factory isn't cheap! Buttered, which made for flavor and also a bit of a mess for me to eat. I tried to be a lady, but to no avail. My friends seemed pretty happy with their orders, also. I didn't hear any major complaints about their food, and I know I snuck some sweet potato fries. Dessert. We didn't get cheesecake (the horror, right?) because I don't like cheesecake. I'll let you process that and then move on. My friend wanted just strawberries because she tries to keep healthy but definitely indulged with a giant burger with bacon and Fontina cheese and fries instead of the salad, so she just got the bowl of strawberries which comes with a bowl of cream. The rest of us shared a strawberry shortcake. I had some problems with it. It was presented beautifully - shortcake then vanilla ice cream then more short cake then strawberries then a mountain of cream with strawberries all around - but I took issue with the shortcake. The ice cream was nice, although I didn't eat much of it because I would've preferred if it was a bit softer. The shortcake was NOT soft enough. I was definitely expecting more of a spongy type of cake, but it was kind of hard, like the shell of a cream puff. I just checked shortcake, and sometimes it's like a biscuit, but it should be cake. Spongy. Soft. I could barely get pieces of it off to eat with the strawberries, so I basically also had strawberries with cream for dessert, with a few bites of ice cream. Bottom line: you get a nice experience and great food at the Cheesecake Factory. I'm kind of on a college budget, so I probably won't indulge in it TOO often (you know), but I have no major complaints. I just don't think I'll jump at the next opportunity to stop by."
Gerson R.,"San Diego, CA",16,27,2,2.0,6/30/2011,"So....I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. You're probably wondering why I'm giving a bad review then. I will tell you. The CF is awesome for lunch and dinner, and even better for the cheesecake, however, they failed epically when it came to brunch. I'm not sure I've ever had such a terrible breakfast. I ordered the Brunch Combo, while my fiance ordered French Toast Napoleon.  The Combo consisted of eggs, bacon, and pancakes. The eggs were good, but unfortunately, they were the only good part of my meal. The bacon felt like rubber had very little flavor. The pancakes were absolutely horrendous! They reminded me of the McDonald's hotcakes... but worse.  The Napoleon wasn't as bad, but it definitely wasn't great. The toast they use is the same toast they use for the Grilled Chicken Avocado Club Sandwich. It tastes fantastic with the sandwich, but as french toast, not so much... To make matters worse, our server was very inattentive and I think may have been allergic to happiness and smiling. He brought us out cold and hard bread, and brought me a lukewarm coffee.  The only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars is because another server, who actually was friendly and attentive (even though it wasn't her table), catered to our needs that our MIA server didn't fulfill, and because she brought me a nice and hot cup of coffee. The coffee is really great there. It's definitely in my top 3 that I've had. Conclusively, don't go here for brunch. Any other time is good, but save breakfast foods for another place. You really broke my heart CF. Papa Bear. Out."
Emily M.,"Bladensburg, MD",38,97,119,1.0,1/28/2013,Why is it so damn dark in here...not romantic at all. Crazy wait time for shitty food.  I practically sat in my neighbors lap during dinner. Waitress was nice. That is all.
