Christopher G.,"Falls Church, VA",267,96,197,3.0,8/17/2011,It's the Factory......what's not to like here? The place runs like a well oiled machine.
Emanuel C.,"Washington, DC",0,31,,5.0,3/18/2015,Allison was a wonderful waitress and professional all the way. The chicken scampi is really delicious and so was the godiva chocolate cheesecake. I had a very nice experience for lunch here and I would highly recommend this place to others. I might even return in the future. I'm very satisfied. I didn't think chicken could be done with scampi but it was excellent.
Jack P.,"Union Bridge, MD",6,9,1,4.0,12/14/2013,"During a real busy night, had a table for two in only 4 minutes. The waitstaff was kind and didnt push the expensive foods. The food arrived relatively fast for the crowdedness and the food was great. I had the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and my girlfriend had the Louisiana chicken pasta. Would highly recommend both."
Danielle J.,"Baltimore, MD",64,173,113,4.0,7/10/2011,"I went here with a friend recently for happy hour. Beth was our server and she was excellent... attentive and personable. We had the buffalo blasts, avocado egg rolls and mojitos. Sadly the food was not as good as I remember from another location, but our mojitos were excellent! We went around 4:30 pm so we were seated immediately and everything we ordered came out quickly. By the time we left people were waiting for the bar tables so if you're going for happy hour get there early."
Daniela M.,"Columbia, MD",24,32,41,1.0,10/16/2012,"This place serves generous portions of mediocre food. The Cajun Jambalaya pasta had no flavor whatsoever and the Pasta with Meat Sauce was nothing special. I ordered the Key Lime pie cheesecake and could not finish eating it because it was too sour (yes, I had good KL pie before and just loved it). On the other hand, my husband had the pumpkin pecan and he said it was really good. I went to this specific location twice and both times I noticed that the staff likes to gather around the register during their breaks. Therefore, if your table is next to the register be prepared to have a group of 4 to 6 staff members talking and laughing over your food. This place doesn't seem to have good management."
Lewis W.,"Ruckersville, VA",1,65,37,4.0,7/22/2011,"Best Cuban sandwich I've had in a long time.  Yeah, that's my picture..."
C K.,"Crofton, MD",1,25,4,1.0,5/11/2014,"HORRIBLE management. I cannot even blame the servers for the severe incompetence seen at this restaurant. Myself and my guest were seated after a small 20 minute wait. Not a problem. 11 minutes go by and no one asked us for our drink order or to say ""Hey, how ya doin?"" I had to grab another server to see if she could find ours. She brings me the manager, he said he's sorry and dessert is on him. So we place our order with the girl I grabbed, still have not met our actual server. Someone brings out my guests drink, mine never came. I go to the hostess desk and ask for a manager who assures me he will go find our server. Meanwhile he brings out my drink. A few minutes later a server comes out begging for forgiveness, which I was obviously not interested in giving. I just wanted my food so I could get out of there. So our food comes out and it is literally missing main food items, no bacon and no strawberries! I ask the server ""Didn't this come with bacon? And I added strawberries to my pancakes!"" He looked at me and said I can go get you some bacon like that's not what was listed on the menu and I was inconveniencing him. Unbelievable! By the way, my potatoes and eggs were like warm, which I kept to myself. So the check comes, I tell the server about our free dessert offer and he says ""Well let me go find out about that."" I said never mind, paid the bill, AND still gave the a$$hole a tip because I have more class than the people I dealt with. They've lost a customer for life, not that this giant chain gives a damn."
Pat K.,"Beltsville, MD",3,36,8,3.0,7/21/2011,"Cheesecake factory has good food and OK service. With that being said, for the prices you pay, it should be better than just ""OK"".  Almost anytime you go there it is always crammed because of the seating, it is very loud, and everything is overpriced. Even the drinks there are really, really expensive. One good thing I will say is that even though the food is not amazing, it is good, and you get a lot of it. One thing I will recommend is the fried mac and cheese balls, they are delicious! If you want to come here for the cheesecake, just remember to only do desert or not get an appetizer with your meal. I have always been too full after an appetizer and a meal to do cheesecake."
Ebony C.,"Washington, DC",11,24,6,4.0,3/25/2013,"Love love love the Cheesecake Factory! The only issue I have is the amount of time waiting to get seated. Otherwise, service is always nice and food is good ( especially the cheesecakes). Catch me at the location on a regular basis ( waiting for for a table :-) )"
Dominique J.,"Catonsville, MD",0,3,,5.0,7/4/2013,"Great portions, decent price, and I've never had a complaint about the service. Definitely the go-to spot for me and the boyfriend. Also, the ahi tartare is beyond delicious!"
Kem W.,"Woodstock, MD",15,208,7,3.0,1/20/2013,"The restaurant has a ""factory"" feel to it but the food is good. I had the Moroccan chicken. The chicken breast was nicely grilled with a bright spicy sauce. I didn't have dessert but I know the cheesecake is good. The server was friendly and helpful. We went at 4 PM on a Ravens game day so the wait was only 10 minutes. I've been there when the wait was very long."
Michele W.,"Woodbine, MD",59,420,28,3.0,1/8/2013,"Portions are large and made with great quality ingredients. However, the onion rings on 2 of the dishes were cold and limp. It was very busy. There was a 15-25 minute wait. The cheesecakes are top notch. The service is prompt, efficient, professional, and helpful."

Joel F.,"Buffalo, NY",17,13,5,3.0,5/24/2012,It is a Cheese Cake Factory chain and it was good.  Service was excellent and didn't spend a whole lot of time waiting for a table.  It was a good experience ......  again.
Becky J.,"Catonsville, MD",7,27,7,4.0,3/28/2012,Always a headache to get a seat here but consistently good food. Love the chopped salad!
Bobbie W.,"Laurel, MD",58,3,,1.0,7/4/2013,For the second time someone at the Cheesecake Factory has stolen my husbands credit card number & bought stuff off the internet. It happened about 8mths ago the first time. They used his debit card info and bought songs off of iTunes. $25 4 times to equal to $100. We went to the Cheesecake Factory a few weeks ago and someone tried to buy $600 worth of stuff off the internet from walmart. Thank goodness the credit card company stopped them then called my husband. They have got to be stopped! PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR CARD AT THIS LOCATION.
Solace C.,"Clarksburg, MD",56,381,4,3.0,1/1/2014,"This place is really good for comfort food. Their salads are delish. Their pasta dishes are good. This place can be somewhat confusing as you enter, especially when there is no host or hostess in site to sit you. Here comes our waitress, ditsey and clumsey and was flirting with my man!!! Im not sure if it was because he was in uniform or what and she made little eye contact with me as if  I was chop liver. The service was rather slow our food comes and its pretty decent but this twit of a waitress kept flirting with him asking q's about irrevelant stuff. I asked for more cheese to send her  off ...that took 15 minutes then she comes back asking if we want dessert. I was like I asked for cheese a while ago, are you grating the cheese in kitchen or what? She was like oh yeah, you still want it? me: I asked for it right? and yes we want dessert. The cheesecakes where good. I got an oreo cheesecake ,and the hubs got a cherry topping cheesecake. Though, the cheesecakes were pricy, they were good. It would have been 5 stars but the service sort of suck.. Nobody likes waiting and no chick likes it when some airhead waitress is flirting with the hubs."
K W.,"Germantown, MD",0,5,,1.0,8/14/2015,"Beware!!!  I would give this -0 review if I could.  My hubby and I ordered take out food to take with us to a concert at the Merriweather  Pavilion across the street on Saturday, August 7th.  We ordered an appetizer and three entrees.  We parked our car and ate the appetizer and one entree before going to the show.  Shortly thereafter, we prepared our things to go over to the concert, we were consolidating the food into one bag and that's when we noticed a live roach crawling on one of the entrees.  I almost vomitted right then and there because we had already eaten half of the food that was in the other bag.  I was so upset!  We immediately drove back to the restaurant and basically tossed the food at the take out counter.  I explained to the worker that there was a roach crawling on my food (as loud as I could) and forced her to look at it. She did and immediately went to get the GM.  It took him a few minutes to come over. While we were waiting my husband vomit in the bathroom.  The GM finally came over and I told him that there was a roach in my food and to look it - he refused and said he believed me.  I demanded my money back.  He was looking for the receipt.  I was so distraught that I couldn't even find the receipt.  We explained that we were just there less than 20 minutes ago so you would think it would have been easy to find our order.  While he's searching for the receipt - I explained that we were frequent patrons of the CF and had never experienced such a disgusting and nasty incident as this.  He said in all his 8 years of working at CF that he had never experienced anything like it either.  He was apologetic and offered free food and dessert.  Really?  Are you serious? I wouldn't even want a glass of water from this darn place!  I was so disgusted - just the image of the roach in my food and to think that I may have eaten one - made me nausea that I went to the restroom and threw up!  When I came back out, hubby was holding his head down - not feeling well at all.  Not to mention we were late for the concert at this point and had to decide whether to go or forfeit the $200+ that we spent on tickets.  We went on to the concert - although we really couldn't enjoy it because I couldn't help but think about the incident. I contacted the health department and they are investigating the incident.  Now I am completely turned off from eating at any restaurant.  It took me awhile to eat after the incident because I couldn't get the image out of my head of the roach crawling on my food.  I couldn't sleep that well either.  This incident has forced me to cook my own food from now on."
DA K.,"Columbia, MD",1,25,,1.0,3/8/2012,I've only been here twice and was not pleased at all about my visits. This place is totally overrated and over priced. I was just dying to go here for the first time because I wanted to see what everyone was bragging on being so good and to see why there was always an incredible long wait for. Well after being there twice I would say. NOT WORTH IT. My food had no taste at all. No seasoning. I had the Cajun seafood and it was no where near Cajun. In my opinion they need to stick with their name CHEESECAKES.
Mich S.,"Washington, DC",64,23,7,2.0,2/16/2012,"Infinite choices. Warm, OK food. Service feels rushed. Not worth a drive, but if you're at the mall already..."
