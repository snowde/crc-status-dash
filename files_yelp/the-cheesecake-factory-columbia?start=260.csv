Jordan K.,"Glen Burnie, MD",340,531,436,4.0,10/10/2011,Fast friendly service!  Arrived at 1130 for lunch and no problems with seating or waiting a long time for food.  I ordered the smokehouse burger from their intensive menu.  Came out the way wanted it cooked and the portion was good for the size.
Patty O.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,5,,4.0,2/9/2013,"Excellent service at the bar, packed house, fabulous food! Herb-Crusted Salmon & Asparagus lunch."
Leland P.,"Laurel, MD",1,26,6,4.0,6/24/2012,"Nice quality food and the staff is usually above average, be prepared to wait on a weekend...or just about anytime"
Ieesha J.,"Washington, DC",510,310,392,5.0,1/12/2012,Always a fan of TCF. You know what to expect. Food always on point..and the cheesecake is to die for - this is ONE chain restaurant that I don't mind going to! The only things is...coming after 8pm you will ALWAYS have a wait. I've been coming to TCF for YEARS and never once was disappointed!
Laurie W.,"Rockville, MD",444,189,,2.0,3/28/2009,"There is always a ridiculous wait at every Cheesecake Factory. I think people expect to see actual cheesecakes rolling out the door on a conveyor belt and that idea is so lovely that it's just like, yeah, I'm going THERE.  That is not what happens there. What happens there, usually, is you wait a long time for a table and then you sit down and it's loud and menu is like a little plastic confusing book and you pick something that sounds like it's less than perhaps 8000 grams of fat and the size of the table and then you eat. And of course you get cheesecake because, we-hell, it's the CHEESECAKE factory, you idiot. That's what you get there!  So why did I just eat that super mega seared wasabi ahi tuna salad with the two dressings the apropros-of-nothing rice cracker shavings and also the fried macaroni and cheese appetizer? And why did I suck down the mojito again? Right! In preparation for cheesecake.  We didn't have to wait last night because a friend got there early (she loves this place, by the way. I'm just a hater.) and snagged a bar table. I'd never been to this location, but it's the same as the other two, in Rockville and Atlanta, that I've been to.  The food was ok. The waitress was extremely annoying, high-maintenance and rushy-rushy and snapping up the dishes while you were still eating, that sort of thing. But if I worked in this place I'd need Xanax cheesecake so I kind of feel for her.  Vanilla bean cheesecake was ok. White chocolate raspberry truffle was my favorite for a long time. I always, always feel like I should have just eaten dessert when I come here, and having done this before I think that's the ticket. Eat somewhere more sane - like home, maybe? - where the entrees aren't the size of a garbage-can lid, and go for cheesecake and maybe a coffee drink in the bar. Do not do the whole dinner ordeal. There are so many better places to do this.  My final irksome tidbit is the inclusion on the menu of a section of ""Weight Management Salads."" Hi 1954 . May I have some spiced apple rings and cottage cheese, too? You specialize in the fattiest dessert in the world besides eating cake icing out of the container (what what?) and you're not only going to give me three allegedly more sensible dining options, you're actually going to CALL THEM WEIGHT MANAGEMENT SALADS and make me order them that way? (And I don't mean me. The day I utter those words to a server is the day I ought to be spoon fed at home.) It really bothered me.  Meh."
Melissa S.,"Severna Park, MD",0,45,,5.0,9/4/2011,I love this place! Huge menu. I've tried several things and all were delish. Save room for the cheesecake! Too many to choose from. Lots of seating inside and out. The service was GREAT! The prices are are a bit steep so we only go for special occasions.
Chris G.,"Manhattan, NY",46,11,,2.0,8/16/2011,"Food was just .... Meh.... Sat at the bar for dinner, almost no one in the area.  You think getting a drink with two bartenders behind the bar would be relatively easy.  But I think Moses had an easier time with the Red Sea.  Service absolutely sux here."
C W.,"Washington, DC",2,231,52,3.0,2/16/2015,"Visited this location for the first time during Valentine's day weekend.  To say it was busy is an understatement.  The wait was about 40 minutes, but this was reasonable considering 1. it was Valentine's day weekend, and 2. the restaurant is located right besides the movie theater at the mall.  It sucks that they don't take reservations, but I completely understand considering the amounts of traffic this restaurant brings in.   I do wish they had a better waiting area available (there is 1 bench that will fit 4 people).  Our server was awesome.  Once we were seated, she promptly asked us for our drink orders, etc. and came to check up on us throughout our meal.  My husband ordered the filet mignon medium-rare and I had the Steak Diane.  His steak came out perfect.   My steak was cooked as requested; however I thought the flavors were bland compared to my order at other locations.  The sauce tasted more watered down vs. the rich flavor that I'm use to."
Nate H.,"Palm Springs, CA",339,496,392,5.0,6/12/2009,"I rarely review a chain, or even care to visit unless there is no other option, and last night, there was very little other options for a meal after a concert at Merriweather Post at 10:45pm. (BTW, Earth Wind and Fire rocked). We called from the car to make sure they were open.  They said as long as we get to a table and order before 11pm, we were good.  We booked, and made it. Now, this is the time you would expect the worst service, attitude and food, right?  Au contraire, mes amis!  The entire staff could not have been nicer. They asked about the concert, the waiter was nice, and professional, made conversation, everything was like clockwork - and we were pretty much the ONLY table in this huge, usually busy place. This Cheesecake Factory has to be one of the more impressive spaces I have seen in the chain - and I've been to many of them from Chicago, to Florida, and the one in Bethesda.  This one reminded me of the lobby of the Venetian Hotel in Vegas...just over the top, high design, spacious, down right beautiful. The food - perfect for this chain.  Fresh, huge portions.  One guest started with the ceasar salad - I've never seen such a mound!  Had to be 2000 calories right there.  The menu seems to favor the chinese thing alot - a whole page.  So I got the Orange chicken.  Simple, huge chunks of tasty white meat with a tangy fresh orange glaze.  None of that heavy breading hiding a little turd of chicken part from other places. (there, I have finally said 'turd' in a review!) The whole table split the apple pie, carmel ice cream thingy just for kicks.  It was awesome, even though it was now midnight and we couldn't think of eating it all.  (damn, now today I want it) So, if you live around Columbia MD, you guys got it made.  If you only come up here for concerts at the Post, stop here before for a great meal!"
Jonathan H.,"San Diego, CA",416,327,1006,3.0,1/31/2009,"I got this awesome drink called the Georgia Peach, which tasted like I was drinking an actual fruit with a straw, kind of like the picture on the Tropicana carton where that red and white straw is punched into the side of the orange. Delicious. The Oreo Cookie Something Something Mudslide Cheesecake was pretty good, too, but it was soo rich I felt like I was eating a pound cake, except it was made of Oreo and actually weighed a pound."
A C.,"Woodbine, MD",6,95,4,4.0,6/15/2009,"I went to this restaurant for my 21st birthday. I sat at the bar because it was pretty crowded on a thursday night. Restaurant Feel - The dim lighting was a tad bit too dim. However, the layout was pretty nice. Service - Service was fairly timely. The host and waiters were respectful. Food Quality - I tried the calamari, which is extremely tastey, although somewhat on the pricey side. I ordered the Kobe Beef Burger, which is amazing. Overall, the food quality was slightly underworth the price, but still a good dinner."
Michele G.,"WINDSOR MILL, MD",0,3,,2.0,5/17/2014,"This place used to be one of our favorite places to eat. Good food, good service, and right next door to AMC theater. Recently the food service has gone down.  On my trip before this one I had a hair fried in with my onion rings. GROSS!!!!! The manager comped the meal I did not eat and my boyfriends meal. So we gave it another try. Today was worse. My boyfriend asked for an omelette. You could make your own from four ingredients. He spent some time explaining that all four. Ingredients should be cheese. Secondly, he asked for a steak to be added to his meal. Interestingly the waitress interpreted that to mean a steak added to the omelet even though he asked for a steak and egg meal. Go figure. But it gets worse. They take the omelet back and try again. This time omelet came out with one ingredient instead of 4 helpings of cheese and the steak was lukewarm and cold in 5 minutes. The manager finally came by only to argue that rare steak should be lukewarm. Now we all know that your meat has to be a certain temperature to meet health standards. And this guy is telling us the meat is supposed to be lukewarm when served. This is our last trip to this Cheesecake Factory . And we were regulars. Don't know what happened but I don't think it is safe to eat here. The bread was toasted on one side."
Brian S.,"Sykesville, MD",3,24,2,4.0,11/2/2012,"I am a huge fan of the cheesecake here. It easily gets five stars. The food was a different story. It really wasn't that good. Sometimes it takes over an hour just to get a table. The line is always out the door, which means that it has to be good."
Heather W.,"Millersville, MD",276,281,39,4.0,6/1/2011,"I went to another CF and had a horrible experience, this place turned it around for me.  They georgia peach was delicious and as it should be!  But it is on the expensive side, $9.50/drink.  I got a mini appetizer of the artichoke and crab dip.... IT WAS PHENOMINAL... I was blown away."
Andrea G.,"Savage, MD",39,8,2,4.0,8/24/2012,I always enjoy myself here. The salad I got last time was OK but the Hibachi Steak before that was amazing. And of course the cheesecake is always a treat. It's not a very intimate atmosphere but still good for dates and the like.
Nick S.,"Beltsville, MD",13,9,1,4.0,12/13/2008,"Went up to the Cheesecake Factory in Columbia yesterday to grab a couple drinks and some lunch with my friends. In the past when I have been I can agree with the rest of the reviewers in saying the wait is generally insufferable, but yesterday we snuck in and got some prime bar seats. The bartenders were both very personable and helpful. They found time to talk fantasy football with us while still serving their other customers and manning the service bar. The drinks were well made. All of my friends and I enjoyed our meals and drinks. I ordered a new item called Chicken Bellagio. It was comprised of two thinly sliced, lightly breaded chicken breasts over a pesto pasta. the chicken breasts were then topped with prosciutto and arugula and a parmesan cream sauce. It was delicious and I was happy to find it because they have actually removed my old Cheesecake Facrtory favorite from the menu. If you are looking for a good appetizer, try their Buffalo Blasts. This appetizer is made up of shreded chicken stuffed inside a fried shell.  Overall, this Cheesecake Factory did a great job in making my dining experience enjoyable. The only thing they can improve on is the wait times, which thankfully I didn't have to endure."
Ernest P.,"Ellicott City, MD",2,80,10,4.0,12/18/2008,"Here is a shout out to the Happy Hour Bar Menu!  If you can score a seat (they have tables, hightops and barstools)--all first come first serve, go for it.  Smaller plates of your favorite apps at good prices.  Highly recommend the salads (BLT or Chopped) for like $3.  Can't go wrong. Nice to pay for the food you eat and not enormous portions that go home in a doggie-bag and sit in the back of the refrigerator."
Jody Z.,"Columbia, MD",173,218,30,3.0,4/24/2009,"I've been to a lot of different Cheesecake Factory restaurants and I think it's the best chain restaurant for consistently good food.  I'm not normally a big fan of chains.  However, the food at the one in Columbia tastes just like the one in Baltimore, in DC, in Boston, etc.  You know what you're going to get and I like that.  They also excel at mastering a bunch of different cuisines---Mexican, America, Italian, etc---there is something for everyone.  I've never disliked anything on the menu and I've tried salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta entrees, and of course cheesecake! You've probably heard that the portions are huge and that's true.  Expect leftovers or split one appetizer, one entree, and a dessert with a friend.  Some half portions are available at lunch and I wish they offered these at dinner time too.  It's pricier than most chains, I think, but not outrageous.  I think the drinks are too overpriced though. My main reason for the lower rating is that this particular Cheesecake Factory is always a mob scene!  There is ALWAYS a huge wait.  It's not their fault, but you should be warned before you go there.  Expect a 1.5-2 hour wait unless you visit at a really off time.  Try to snag some of the seat yourself tables by the bar if you can.  Warning though---If you do this, the other ""vultures"" will be stalking you and waiting until the second you start to get up to snag your table.  This can be kind of annoying. I've given up visiting the actual restaurant and have started doing Curbside To Go.  Call it in and they bring it right out to your car.  You get the yummy bread too.  It's saves me money because I usually order a $2.50 Diet Coke---what a rip off!  Then I eat my meal at home, in peace without the noise of 100 people jammed into the entryway or being stared down by the vultures trying to take my seat."
M M.,"Centreville, VA",49,11,,3.0,1/28/2013,So noisy! It's always so crowded and noisy. And this place doesn't have a clear decoration. (A bit oriantal a bit modern; but not good combination of them) I don't like the atmosphere. But taste of grilled salmon is awesome! And also crabcakes are good.
Ji K.,"Hanover, MD",18,96,1,3.0,3/16/2009,It is a chain and you get what you expected.  The food is consistently not bad at this branch and the portions are large. I tend to visit here when most other restaurants are closed.  The kitchen is open till 11am even on Sunday nights.  I usually leave satisfied. It doesn't hurt that I still like the cheesecakes here.  I almost considered giving a chain 4 stars.
