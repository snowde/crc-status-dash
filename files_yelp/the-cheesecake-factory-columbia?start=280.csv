John M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",301,12,,5.0,10/22/2011,The spinach and artichoke dip and tempura fried ahi tuna roll appetizers were amazing. Service was perfect. Always great to have a night out with no issues in service and great food.
Jennifer H.,"Glen Burnie, MD",52,141,1,3.0,5/9/2011,"Most of their food is good, but you're really supposed to come here for the desserts.  The 1.5 hour wait isn't really worth it though.  You can probably go somewhere else for food just as good (or much better) and not wait for so long. The food tends to be americanized-fusion cuisine of some sort that's sometimes really good or something just OK.  If you love authenticity when it comes to food, don't come here.  Food portions are really large, but there's nothing to seriously rave about when it comes to their entrees.  My sister loves their fried mac n cheese appetizer.  Their potstickers are eh.     Cheesecake is extremely overpriced at $7.50 a slice, but they do have a large variety of flavors.  If anything, go for a strawberry shortcake or regular cake.  They are massive desserts that you can share with several people and not have to worry about the fat and calories that a slice of cheesecake would have. It's a very loud environment so don't expect to have a quiet romantic evening here. Service has always been good.  Food came out quickly and wait staff has always been friendly.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on their menu."
Su K.,"Washington, DC",229,428,582,3.0,5/27/2008,"Today was the first time I decided where I wanted to eat because I wanted to Yelp about it. Yes, it is a chain restaurant, but after ragging on the Rockville location, I wanted to let my fellow Yelpers know about this not-so-secret dining delight in Columbia, MD...but it wasn't to be. With chain restaurants, the food/decor/coasters are predictable, but what sets chains apart are the little things; and they lacked in the little things. For example, after dropping my mom and wife off in front of the restaurant and parking in that ridiculously crowded lot, I walked toward the restaurant while pushing my baby girl in a stroller. As  I approached the door, I noticed a server exiting the restaurant--as evidenced by her all white ensemble--possibly having just ended her shift.. Having been a dad for 3+ months now, I've learned that pushing a stroller will A) draw ladies of all ages - pied piper, thy name is Graco and B) cause random people to open doors for you. She didn't even bother to hold the door for me -- and I was definitely within a reasonable please-hold-the-door/elevator distance. Food - I was unimpressed with the Chinese Chicken Salad - it had all these crispy, stringy things, and while I'm normally a fan of all things fried, these overwhelmed the salad. My wife and mom both had the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which are always fantastic! Highly recommended (they are on the appetizer menu). Note: they have lunch portions until 5p.m. for $8.95-$9.95 (normally $13+), which is a great deal for the salads since salads are typically no good as leftovers. The only cabbage/lettuce that should be soggy is kim chi! Also, we decided to mix things up and try the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. It was ok, but we should have stuck with our old favorite, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Service - This is what used to set this location apart, not just from other Cheesecakes, but other establishments in Columbia, particularly since the majority of restaurants in Columbia seem to be a part of a chain. The key word is used to. The previous times we've dined here, the server brought out some steaming, moist towels with fresh lemons after our meal because the Thai Lettuce Wraps can get messy. Not this time. Admittedly, the server wasn't bad, but he was just another chain server. Location - The waits tend to be much better here than in Rockville. A wait here however, makes sense because The Mall in Columbia does get crowded and I imagine all the shoppers get tired of Sarku after a while. Additionally, this location is very kid friendly. They'll park your stroller and have wide enough aisles that putting a high chair next to your table won't violate a fire code. Finally, there is outdoor seating (as Ina K. noted) which offers a view of the movie theater, a large office building, and a town home. This place used to stand out but it now looks like another predictable link in the chain. Other nearby offerings include: Uno, Champps (I don't know what the 2nd 'p' stands for, but probably not ""Popular"" as I've never seen this place too crowded), and the Food Court. Personally, I'd stick with Cheesecake or make the drive over to the lake for Sushi Sono or Waterside."
Allison S.,"Baltimore, MD",19,168,8,4.0,6/30/2010,"Cheesecake Factory never fails! Even on busy nights the wait is rarely over 15 minutes, everything arrives to your table in a timely manner, the waitress refills your water as needed, and all you have to do is hear a couple speeches about the soup of the day and some new cake that gives a  dollar to homeless people.  I will admit that Farzan's CFIF is real, but the key to avoiding it is to bring someone with you who will eat all of his own food, and then eat half of yours.  Usually I get a small plate salad, an appetizer, and then split a slice of cheesecake. The small plates are the best thing to happen to CF, because they are regular portioned meals. I recommend avoiding the entrees. The food is definitely tasty, and I think it is worth the money since they give you so much of it. Just bring some home if you hate big portions that much! My favorites include the Little House Salad, Firecracker Salmon, and Tex-Mex Eggrolls. Oh, and Tiramisu Cheesecake =)"
Cole C.,"Washington, DC",193,59,6,4.0,3/28/2010,"Number two on the short list of chain restaurants that I love. Every CF I've been to in this great land of ours has never left me disappointed and I still get excited when I discover a new one. I most recently visited the Columbia location with no exception. The service was swift and friendly, my favorite appetizer of avocado egg rolls was on point as usual, the sunrise fiesta burrito was ginormous plus delicious and the peach bellini's were mighty tasty. I plan my visit's during hours that are generally less busy. What hours would those be? you might ask. HA! I'll never tell. CF, keep on keepin on."
Ina C.,"Westwood, MA",380,697,93,3.0,3/26/2008,"As if Columbia was lacking in chain restaurants, Cheesecake came to the ""rescue"" a few years ago and settled itself next to Columbia Mall's movie theater. I've always said that there's a conspiracy at Cheesecake Factory - Considering the size of the restaurant, how can every Cheesecake Factory in the United States have a 45+ minute wait? It baffles my mind! And this Cheesecake is no different.  The food is the same as any of the other 29389045 Cheesecakes in the country, but what I do love about this location is their outdoor dining area. Yes, you're facing a mammoth parking lot; And yes, there are delinquent high schoolers hanging outside the movie theater next door...but somehow, you'll find peace and serenity on this patio, away from the shouting acoustics of the indoor dining room. I'm giving this place three stars - One for the beautiful patio, another for always having at least ONE thing I like (the menu is humaangous, but at least you have your pick), and a third for being a great default dinner spot anywhere in the entire country. :) Like any other Cheesecake, wait times dramatically decrease after 8pm, so you should be able to find a table indoors or outdoors later in the evening. So if you're in Columbia on a beautiful evening, stop by at Cheesecake for some al fresco dining!"
Cindy L.,"Washington, DC",333,187,70,2.0,4/30/2008,"Service was decent..although our server was extremely loud, food was good and came out promptly...all was good and my BF paid the bill for our 6-person dinner w/my parents.  I order a cappuccino after he paid the bill...it doesn't show up for 10 minutes, she forgot to put the order in. Another server walks by and spills coffee all over my feet and pant legs...he apologizes....and then our server goes on to charge me my coffee. Seems like she didnt care what happened after the bill was paid even though she saw that I was soaked in coffee.  I work in the hospitality industry and that is absolutely unacceptable. I didnt ask for anything and didn't want to complain since the server was really sorry. But to charge me after you see me getting doused in coffee...just very uncaring in my opinion."
Courtney C.,"Pasadena, MD",244,476,27,3.0,4/4/2010,"I refuse to eat a meal here. There is no reason to eat that many calories in one sitting. This place is always packed and we wonder why Americans have the highest obesity rates! I was looking for a place in the Columbia area that had margaritas and/or mojitos with a patio. I figures this would work. 4:00 on a Saturday and there was a wait for the patio. Oh how I hate Columbia sometimes. They sat us in the very back of the patio, not a big deal, but not the best seat by far. Pineapple Mojito was delicious. We tried the guacamole-medium and it was pretty descent. I liked that it had chunks of avocado in it. The shrimp summer rolls were actually pretty good. Crisp asparagus, fresh herbs, good sized shrimp, but nothing close to authentic with ramen noodles inside. The white bean hummus was descent, but nothing too special. the pita it came with tasted like grill and nothing like bread. it was very strange. We got two pieces of cheesecake to go. so, a total of 6 drinks, 3 apps and 2 pieces of cheesecake were about $105! A little pricey. We were there for 2 1/2 hours and our waitress was okay. Friendly, but slow on the water refills and when we said a third person was coming she didn't bring an extra place setting or napkin. Good think my hubby doesn't mind sharing with me.  I still wouldn't come here for a meal, but to indulge in a few appetizers and over priced drinks on the patio wasn't too bad. Next time I meet up with a friend for drinks, I'll choose somewhere else."
Ty T.,"Crestview, FL",67,24,57,3.0,4/3/2011,Good staff. Above average food for a restaurant of this type. I'm a fan of the calamari. This location is always crowded...make a reservation.
Soo U.,"Ellicott City, MD",4,18,3,4.0,3/22/2012,"i finally tried a non-cheesecake dessert here. it felt kind of silly to go to cheesecake factory and not get cheesecake, but their cakes look pretty good so i finally tried one out. i got the chocolate tower truffle cake and it was chocolate decadence- so if you ever have a chocolate craving this is where it's at, just be warned, it will be sweet, so get some coffee with it"
Mary T.,"Laurel, MD",0,2,,1.0,4/14/2013,"Warning for your wallet.  My basic Margarita cost $9.50.  My husband's basic frozen Margarita cost $9.50.  They were served in tiny stemmed glasses.  That's a total of $19.00 for two tiny standard Margaritas.  Really.   There are hundreds of wonderful restaurants in Columbia, MD.  Don't waste your money in this one."
Kay S.,"Columbia, MD",605,362,,1.0,3/17/2008,"I hate chains, but I hate this particular Cheesecake Factory the most. Food aside (obviously, completely pedestrian), the service and management are awful. I went with a group of about 15 (not my pick!), we had reservations and STILL were made to wait for nearly an hour. No apologies, no complimentary cocktails, nuthin'. Oh, how I hate chains."
G T.,"Fort Meade, MD",1,29,19,5.0,4/17/2009,"Hey, can you believe it, my first time ever to go to the Cheesecake Factory, kinda.  I was really impressed, the decor was super nice, the wait staff, outstanding and the food, amazing!  This was very impressive to me considering--- this is a chain and the price for our (2) lunch was just $63 with tip!  I'm going back, and I bet that's a cool place to stop in on a weekend evening, if you can get in the door.   They've figured out how to do a chain right, my hat is sincerely off, best chain I've been to in years.  Loved it."
Ira B.,"Villanova, PA",41,5,,3.0,6/27/2011,Cheesecake Factory in Columbia is probably no better or worse than any of the others. I've been to this one as well as the one in King of Prussia Mall and they are about the same. The service is nothing special and the food is the same. Their cheese cake is obviously the highlight of the menu and can also break the bank. Good overall experience though.
Danny L.,"Columbia, MD",6,45,13,3.0,3/4/2009,This Cheesecake factory is like all the others found around the country. The lines are long and the portions are huge. Nothing really daring to adventuresome on the menu.
Michelle S.,"Elkridge, MD",0,26,,2.0,11/1/2010,"The food is just ok, the service has been horrible the past few times eating here, not planning on going back."
Sandie D.,"Washington, DC",40,56,,4.0,8/8/2008,"We were on our way to check out a school in Columbia and decided to get something to eat at Cheesecake Factory.  We had never been there and took a look at the menu and decided to give it a try.  We arrived during happy hour and since we were on a childless outing decided to venture into the bar.  Happy hour in restaurants is the way to go to try their food without spending an arm and a leg.  We slipped in right before the end of happy hour. The server was very friendly.  Took our order quickly and got our order in before the bewitching hour turned food into full price.  The restaurant itself is large and roomy. It has a very elegant look for a  casual environment. We enjoyed Mini Sliders, Egg rolls, and Mini Cuban Sandwiches with fries. The beer was cold, the food was hot and more than we expected, and the server went out of his way to accommodate us.  Our only regret was that we didn't have time or room to try their famous cheesecake.  But you can bet we will be back again."
Lauren H.,"Columbia, MD",0,3,,2.0,8/12/2009,"The food is pretty good here but pretty pricey. $7.00 for a slice of cheesecake is way overpriced imo. The cheesecakes also range from 1000-2000 calories per slice from my research. However, if you still must get a cheesecake, the fresh strawberry and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake taste really good. Also, i'm not sure if the 45mins-2.5hour waits are worth it. I think this chain is pretty overrated... If you go on a weekend night, be prepared for the long wait. They don't take reservations or call ahead seating. It is also very loud and cold inside so I prefer sitting on the patio. Their clam chowder soup is probably one of the better soups. It can be a little too creamy however. My favorite dish is the miso salmon. It is really yummy with the salmon served on top of the rice. It costs $20 for the dish but try to go during their lunch hours (till 5pm) and I believe it costs around $13?  The ladies room.....is disgusting. No toilet paper in all the stalls, trash overflowing, and water all over the counters. Try to avoid it if possible.  Overall, I give it a 2. Overrated and could get food just as good over by champs or p.f changs for cheaper and less of a wait!"
Mark H.,"Columbia, MD",2,1,,3.0,1/4/2006,"It is very crowded-especially since just opened and it was the holidays.  Got there at 10:55 am for 11 am opening on Fri. 12-30-2005-- already 50+ people in line.  However, if you are willing to sit at the bar or at one of the high tables in the bar area, you can skip the line and grab your seat.  Friendly people-- a mom came over and asked if she could borrow a chair-- I thought she'd take it to her table, but she didn't have a table-- instead brought over her young child and sat him at my table-- haven't seen that before.  Variety of food, quality on par with other high end sit down popular ""American"" restaurants, though prices a bit high.  If you enjoy a wait, like lively environment with colorful decor, decent food, near movie theaters and a mall this is a reasonable choice."
