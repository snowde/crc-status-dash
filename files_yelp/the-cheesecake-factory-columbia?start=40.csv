Amy K.,"Elkridge, MD",96,31,27,1.0,6/9/2017,So Cheesecake Factory is notorious for their waits. That j can deal with but what is absolutely unacceptable is getting splinter in your dish. My boyfriend was eating his dinner and had to take a splinter out of his mouth!!! What's even more infuriating is the managers response. He just offered to remake the food. My boyfriend refused and then he offered to take it off the bill. Seriously if my boyfriend had swallowed the SPLINTER and any damage had occurred he could have sued.  He talked to another manager after the dissatisfaction with the first one who offered a free entree. But this is honestly not acceptable at all. The first manager should have handled it better but there should never be a case where there is a piece of wood in our food.
Christina X.,"Silver Spring, MD",7,10,29,1.0,7/31/2017,I had dinner here tonight and the Jason the manager came out with the food and when he put the food down he spill my friends drink all over the table and some on her and the only thing he did he asked her did you get wet and she said it's ok a little and he left and did nothing. Thanks for nothing!!!!
Dorothy N.,"Silver Spring, MD",222,65,62,1.0,6/20/2016,"Still giving 1 star.  Was waiting in one of two poorly defined lines for pick up. The woman at the counter let 2 people go ahead of me and when I said excuse me I was here first. She said Yeah but I need to get people their cheesecake orders first.  Umm, hello. I already ordered, called, and was there to pick up.  One of the people she let go ahead of me was picking up something also and complaining about their curbside service taking 45 mins (yikes.) Will definitely not be ordering from Cheesecake again."
Kelly J.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,9,,2.0,11/11/2016,"Slow service for how over priced the food is, it's a location that is in a highly populated area and is constantly busy so I don't see why they can't hire more (competent) staff. Tonight was told 20 minutes for curb side, took an hour.. Food was ready and given to us but we had to wait almost 10 minutes for our cheesecake to be brought out after the food, and another 15 for our credit card to be returned to us. No apologies, no manager to be found, we started doing curb side because dine in was so bad, guess we won't be doing curb side again for a while! The two stars are only because food quality has always been decent. Edit- just got home and they didn't even get the order correct. Did I mention it's Veterans Day and I wanted to have a nice meal with my veteran boyfriend? Thanks for ruining that, too."
Tracey O.,"Hanover, MD",0,28,,5.0,7/31/2017,"Finally!!!  A Cheesecake Factory that gets it right!!!  Went to dinner with my Mother/Nephew last Saturday. Had the best meal and service ever received at a Cheesecake Factory.  Gavin (Server) was spot on whilst Jasmine (Bartender) made me the BEST fresh muddled strawberry Mojito I've ever had! (Exactly how I requested it)  I moved down to MD from NJ 2015 and it's been very difficult to find a place for a decent meal and spot on staff.  This location has nailed it.  I strongly encourage you re-train your Arundel Mills location staff so they too can reach the same level of excellence as your Columbia location.  I requested Jason (Manager) to our table so he too can know how much we appreciated our experience.  The Kobe beef burger was perfectly done,  all our food came out fresh and hot, timing of delivery was spot on and any special requests were executed. WELL DONE!!!!"
Samasama P.,"Maryland City, MD",4,7,13,1.0,10/9/2016,Do not I repeat do not eat here friend found roach in food ! A friend of mine found a dead roach in her pancakes. Manager claim they're not sure how it got there and that it goes threw several people before getting to the table ! What type of mess is this !
Deanne B.,"Woodbine, MD",47,118,54,3.0,9/24/2016,Visited last night - Friday night. Had a 25 minute wait. Not bad. Very pleasant waiter but he really needs to hone his skills. Dumped butter (literally) on the table and a basket of bread saying he would be back for drink orders. Several minutes later he returned. Took drink orders. Brought one drink back to the table then we waited another five minutes for the rest of the drinks. Placed an appetizer order with the drinks. That arrived much later. Finally placed our food order. Food took a long time to come and the plates were so hot you could have burned yourself. Our waiter didn't bring them. Made me think they sat under the heat lamps a long time. Food was ok.... until later. My husband got terribly ill from the chicken. Horrible music was screeching in the background.   A bit disappointing.
Tracy D.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,12,4,5.0,3/21/2017,"The food was as good as usual. We were seated promptly, as well. Our server, Issac was attentive, thorough and comical. Customer service in general is on a downhill slope in some establishments these days. How refreshing it was to have such a great experience today with our server!"
Patrice W.,"Baltimore, MD",44,74,187,5.0,10/24/2016,"Awesome happy hour. Most of the items are $5.95. This is the mojito one of the 5 drinks on the menu not including the wine, beer ans well drink specials. The appetizer menu is on the happy hour also. The avocado tacos are apart of the food specials which are also $5.95 or less. Absolutely great deal. The drinks are strong and the service is excellent!"
John C.,"Columbia, MD",65,2,,1.0,9/20/2017,Yeah so far I'm not impressed they forgot about us for about 20 min after the hostess sat us then it was shift change and a waiter refused to serve us and after about 45 min drinks just came
Elizabeth W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",295,188,360,4.0,4/11/2016,"I have never felt like I needed to review the Cheesecake Factory, because well, the place is a chain and it's got good food and typically good service. But last night's meal and service was so good, it just deserved to be talked about. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta is just redundant since all Jambalaya is cajun, but the spices were perfect and the green linguine noodles were just oh so good.  The stuffed mushrooms are always a little runny, but with the bacon and cheese on top, I can never resist! And the Fried Zucchini Fritters, oh my god. Perfectly cooked, not soggy and the yummy in my tummy. My friends meals were delicious as well, I think everyone was plenty satisfied with their meals. Our server, I'm so sorry I forgot your name so that I could give you a good review, but she was attentive and on point. Making sure we got our waters refilled, our drinks refilled and that the food was fine. Good job hiring her, Cheesecake! Of course the cheesecake, I can't end this review without saying something about Cheesecake! Definitely get the Lemon Raspberry, it was so tart and yet so sweet, the perfect combination. And the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was the perfect blend of white chocolate and chocolate mousse. I was in heaven!"
Aubrey G.,"Laurel, MD",1,34,27,5.0,5/15/2017,First time having Thai lettuce wraps. Food is always fresh and delicious. I will most definitely try them again staff were friendly and provided great service. Always end with my dolce de leche cheesecake!!
Megan B.,"Silver Spring, MD",131,252,550,4.0,5/14/2015,"Summary: great food, great drinks, tough parking, lots of traffic.  Long story: I love the Cheesecake Factory. I mean, I have never had a bad meal here. The food is amazing every time. Yet again I was so starving that I forgot to take a picture of my Cuban sandwich with a side green salad tossed in honey citrus dressing. I can't even tell you how delicious this meal was. The sandwich comes on what can only be described as a miniature baguette. It's toasted, and the cheese is literally melting out of the sides of the sandwich. Definitely more than you can eat in one sitting.  My friend got the sweet corn tamale appetizer. It came with tomato and avocado, and was drizzled in some incredible chipotle sauce.  Also every flavor of cheesecake you could imagine. And they do not disappoint on the cheesecake.  Service was decent, and they have heat lamps for you to sit outside on a patio. I prefer the patio because something about the acoustics makes the atmosphere inside very loud. But they do have a small bar inside, which is nice.  So, this place is apparently across from a music venue (maybe Merriweather Pavilion?). Either way, traffic can be an absolute bear if you don't plan around the concerts. I drove up from Silver Spring today after work, and because a COVER BAND was performing, it took me over an hour and a half to get to the Cheesecake Factory. That's a long time to drive for dinner. So just plan for that. Also, this place is in a mall, and it's hard to find parking on the weekends, but not during the week so much."
Max H.,"Silver Spring, MD",29,10,,1.0,6/19/2017,"This is probably the worst cheesecake factory ive been to. Charged me almost twenty dollars for oily inedible fish and chips last week, INEDIBLE. I just came back from them and got an stale peice of banana cheesecake, STALE with brown black banana slices on it. I live half half an hour away, they want their brown slice back for a refund, guess theyre paying for it in the end, thru yelp. Absolutley disgusting."
Edward V.,"New York, NY",1,3,,4.0,6/19/2017,Isaac. Go there and ask to sit in his section. The food is whatever but Isaac will make sure you enjoy your time there. He's got great personality and knows how to balance that with what you need while dining out.
Ava R.,"Fulton, MD",0,1,,2.0,9/23/2017,"Went out for dinner with my family, service was very slow. Our food came out in nearly an hour and we were still waiting on another meal."
Ally Y.,"Laurel, MD",174,121,71,4.0,12/31/2015,"Why is this place rated so low? I live in Columbia so I come here very frequently, and I leave satisfied every time.  Few of my favorite dishes: Cashew Chicken: very very good. it's actually my favorite dish. it's spicy and sweet just right, and the portion is absolutely huge. I highly recommend.  Calamari: can you go wrong with this one? Chipotle Pasta: my favorite pasta dish. it's not bland and I add chicken in mine to keep it interesting. the spice is perfect.  Lemon Chicken: also very good. chicken is cooked perfectly and I enjoy the lemon sauce.  Strawberry daiquiri: Yummm. it's such a girly cocktail but I love it anyways.  I also love Cheesecake Factory bread. and the service. all the waitresses/waiters I have dealt with are very pleasant. I know there's always a long wait but that's because it's good.  Cheesecakes themselves are also amazing. my favorite is dulce de leche.  only complaint: priced a little high."
Jeff W.,"Finksburg, MD",64,14,3,5.0,4/7/2017,I experienced extreme flight delays at BWI. That place was a 3rd world hell hole. I needed a place to grab dinner and drinks. Cheesecake hooked me. These guys are great.
Ann P.,"Washington, DC",838,599,1483,4.0,4/20/2015,"The thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that is has become so main stream. I feel like it's been franchised so much that it's become such a basic restaurant. But the Cheesecake Factory was once such a unique restaurant. Now I feel like it's something very expected.  Despite the generic nature of the restaurant,  I love the Cheesecake Factory. I especially love all of their salads. I am indeed that girl who always asks for extra dressing. I also love all of their pasta selections. I'm also that girl who asks for extra sauce on my pasta. But, hey don't judge a girl solely on her love for sauces and dressings. I prefer extra saltiness and sweetness from sauces, but I'm abnormal. Thus, there is no need to order more dressing and sauces if you are not a sauce fanatic like myself. I usually go for the salad at lunch and the pasta for my dinner selections. You can never go wrong.  After your dinner you have to, and I mean you have to, you must... end with a slice of cheesecake."
Lisa S.,"Laurel, MD",76,22,1,5.0,6/13/2017,"I love this place! From the service to the food quality, my visit is never short of spectacular! This is one of my favorite restaurants and definitely the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to!"
