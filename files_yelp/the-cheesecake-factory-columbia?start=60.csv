Tiffany K.,"Baltimore, MD",30,52,26,3.0,9/18/2016,"Cheesecake is great of course and the servers are nice.  A ton of options to choose from but it is overpriced. It's been my experience that the dishes are either barely seasoned at all or over seasoned (to the point of being inedible) a little balance would go a long way. Also, if your meal comes with some sort of meat, for instance a pasta dish with chicken, there won't be much meat in it. Stick to appetizers and dessert and you should be ok."
Toby L.,"Columbia, MD",22,24,4,4.0,11/13/2016,"Perfect happy hour location but it ends at 6:00 PM, an hour earlier than the competition.   Service is usually good but be aware that during happy hour bartenders will often serve the the ""wrong"" size/type of drink that's (conveniently) not on special so be sure to be specific.   The food is very good and I'm quickly becoming a ""regular"" here, the five-minute walk from my home a contributing factor."
Rummy V.,"Columbia, MD",316,232,988,2.0,7/4/2016,"I feel as if every time I come here the experience and food is quite different. The wait was about 10minutes, no not because they were busy but only because it took a while to obtain eye contact from the host that was right in front of us. This food was just very messy, no regards to presentation and cleanliness as everything was dripping everywhere on my plate and off. The silverware had a couple of stains on them. The food I did get a chance to eat was very good which was the bread and the nacho appetizers! Our waitress was very nice but this place has changed. For what you are paying for you deserve quality food and service. Sadly, Cheesecake Factory has definitely fell off."
Dia J.,"Laurel, MD",0,2,,1.0,11/10/2017,"I have been going to Cheesecake Factory for years and sometimes twice a week. I have never had bad experience with any other locations except this one. The customer service was terrible. My brother had to go find our server twice. The food she brought out was cold. She gave the food to us and just left, never came back to ask how everything is. Once my brother found her I told her my food is cold. She goes oh we can fix that. After waiting for another 30 mins while everyone else was done eating. My food came and it was tomato sauce where pasta was floating and no cheese and this dish is called 4 cheese pasta. Once again the server was gone and no where to be found. Once she came back she goes oh we can not add cheese once we reheat the pasta.I was like how can I eat this and before I could finish what I had to say. She cut me off and said oh our kitchen is going down and haven't been making good food but I will have the manager take it out of ur check. The manager didn't even bother coming to the table and tried to do anything to fix the situation. Just because of this wouldn't be going to any Cheesecake Factory restaurant."
Deutz D.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",1,19,,1.0,3/10/2017,It was terrible to say the least. The food was runny and tasteless. You can't go wrong with a franchise but this was no good. The drinks tasted flat. The portions were very small! I was not a happy camper !
Lacey I.,"Williamsburg, VA",26,5,1,5.0,6/30/2016,"For my first time visiting the chain, I was very impressed. There was a large crowd waiting for tables when we arrived at around 7 on a Tuesday. There were numerous open tables, and the hostesses were steadily seating guests; keeping the wait times minimal and not overwhelming the waitstaff.  We ordered 3 courses: appetizers, sandwiches and of course cheesecake. Our Fried Mac and Cheese was tasty but a little cool at the center. Both sandwiches we ordered were delicious and huge. We could only eat half and have the rest boxed. Our cheesecakes, to go, were also great. Our service by Kumba was the highlight of the evening. Her timing and service were outstanding. We never needed anything but we didn't feel bothered. She was very friendly and warm and made us feel welcome. We plan on asking for her when we return and recommend that you do the same. One suggestion: Please invest in the decor. The mixture of ancient Egypt, Golden Girls pastels and 90s moodiness just isn't working."
DM S.,"Columbia, MD",99,11,11,4.0,3/17/2016,"This place is pretty good, food wise and atmosphere wise.  The wait is always a tad bit long, but worth the wait.  My only complaint is that the tables are way too closed together and that the cheesecake is like $7.00 and up for a slice of cheesecake,  that's insane.  The food is always hot and fresh, and is served with a becoming presentation.  I have eaten there several times as I live in this area, will always go back, just wish the tables weren't so closed together, there is no privacy when you would like to have a private conversation.  As well as the wait not being so long. Inside is gorgeous and the food is delicious!   Go there you will not be sorry!!"
Meunda W.,"Germantown, MD",21,29,35,1.0,11/13/2016,"This restaurant location was aweful. I ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad and the greens were not fresh by just looking at it. Looked like they took it out the trash and mounted it up on the plate to actually serve. We called the manager and he actually admitted that they place all plates on a hot counter under heating lamps for pickup that the waiters take to tables. But, why are cold meals, especially a damn salad on the hot counters under heating lamps?  I wish Chef Ramsey was there to check those plates and give hell to the chefs. If I did not know better and ate that rotten salad, I'd be either in the bathroom or in the hospital. Terrible."
Connie Y.,"Rockville, MD",254,97,1425,3.0,9/25/2014,"I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake and got a lemon Raspberry Creme Cheesecake. 'Nough said.   On the upside, their Bistro Shrimp Pasta was as good as usual and with that extra Parmesan sprinkled on top, makes for a delectable pasta dish. With fresh mushrooms, lightly battered shrimp, arugula, and tomatoes tossed into spaghetti, it is one of the better dishes at Cheesecake. Quite buttery, but not too creamy. You may want to ask for less salt on the dish. My friend ordered the Farfelle with chicken and roasted garlic and much to my delight, the garlic-parmesan creaminess wasn't  too overwhelming. The mixture of peas, tomatoes, and mushrooms helped to lighten the creaminess of the pasta. If you enjoy creamy pastas and cute bow-tie pasta, please try. Overall, it was a satisfying if not sufficient meal. Do come back for their happy hour though. Great appetizers (try the buffalo blasts) at great prices."
Melody M.,"Owings Mills, MD",23,120,152,4.0,6/25/2016,Waited a while to get seated. One seated the floor under our table was wet and dirty -we found pieces of bacon under there. That said  out waiter Rashad was EXCELLENT. He was friendly and personable and we really enjoyed him waiting on us. We were fighting to give him tips at the end. The manager told us he was fairly new. I had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and my table mates had crab cakes and shrimp and chicken pasta. The drinks were not memorable Arnold Palmer tasted like water. Of course the lemon meringue cheesecake was wonderful. We will be back.
Simone S.,"Silver Spring, MD",4,5,59,4.0,2/5/2016,We came for dinner and drinks. My close friend and I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory! What a great place that has a variety of solid food options.  Here's what I got: Drink: Classic Mojito! I am obsessed with a flavorsome mojito and this did not fail me. Entree: The Louisiana Chicken Pasta and wow talk about scrumptious. It was seasoned to perfection; I am not one who typically opts for a spicy dish but man oh man this was worth it. I highly recommend. You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not get Cheesecake!! I stuck to what I know and love the succulent original cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream! Our waitress Alyssa was delightful! Overall I would recommend that you stop in after you do a little shopping. Only thing I wish they would take reservations after the lunch hour.
Ted B.,"Town Center, Columbia, MD",7,3,,5.0,3/10/2017,Food and ambiance is great!  Sarah the bartender is very efficient and a true professional and very pleasant.
Ericka G.,"Columbia, MD",260,419,1625,2.0,6/24/2014,"I've been here a million times and strangely my service is better than when they are insanely busy.  My niece is sick so we ordered ginger ale. Apparently that soft drink does not have free refills. We ordered soup, I asked her for crackers. Apparently all of the CF has no crackers. Strike 1. The small plates on the table under the napkins weren't clean. The waitress heard when I said these aren't clean, turned around then turned back around pretending she heard not a thing. She never brought us plates, we even got our apps, still no plates. I got them from a random waitstaff men that I waved down. Also my nephew asked, ""why is it that when you speak to him, he speaks back and when you ask him to do something he does it.... Why doesn't OUR waitress behave that way?"" From the mouths of babes.... Strike 2. The waitress was not friendly nor accommodating. I'm here with children ages 8, 12, 13, & 17, she addressed no one. More aloof and irritated that we were making her have to work. Strike 3. At present, this chick is getting a 10% tip with a comment on my bill from me.  I'm not impressed. As I left, my very absent waitress Ashley was discovered to be chatting it up at server station by the bar. She: 1. Did take the small plates after I addressed her directly that they were all dirty. She never brought us more. We were served bread & our appetizers and still no plates. I had to wave down a random server. He got us the plates. The plates were stored in the cabinet directly in front of our table. He apologized for our waitress. 2. She never came back to clear our table after the entrees arrived. 3. She never gave eye contact. She was very short and seemingly annoyed. That was just her attitude. Yes, I was there with kids, but they know how to behave when out with me so, her attitude was not in anyway provoked. 4. Two random servers checked on us and we got boxes from them. The second server was who got our waitress because we were already packed up and needed the check. That server got her from wherever she was chatting & she then asked if we needed boxes (which clearly we didn't because we had already bagged & boxed ourselves AND consolidated all the plates so it would be easy to clear the table).  I decided not to tip her and to leave her a note on the check instead. The note just said that she missed out on the tip because her colleagues did what she was supposed to do. May I remind you, the restaurant was DEAD. Very few people there. More servers than patrons. I spoke to the manager as I left and he was embarrassed. I praised the other servers and let him know I an frequent customer (who lives very close by) and know her behavior was not standard. He gave me his card and assured me that at my next visit, is have optimal service. Now, that's how it's done. Brava manager!"
Bobby P.,"Ellicott City, MD",2,6,,1.0,7/26/2017,Possibly the worst restaurant experience which made me download Yelp to tell everyone.  Been waiting for a drink for 40 minutes and a manager basically said they are backed up and deal w it.    Placed food order about 45 min ago and it's still not here.
Amira M.,"Orlando, FL",104,167,130,1.0,6/20/2015,"The one star is for the sliver of delicious cheesecake I bought from the take out counter.   My husband, son, and I went here for lunch after a movie. My son and I walk up to a rather distracted hostess and asked for a table for three.  She spoke to me without looking at me and directed us to stand to the side.  Another woman came up to us and said, ""Table for two?"" I told her no, three.  She looks confused and speaks to the first hostess who says, ""She said two.  Now she wants three?"" Rolled her eyes and made a face.  The second hostess seemed annoyed with me.  I watched as at least four other groups were seated, all who came after us and two were also parties of three. The side plates were wet, the silverware was mostly dirty, and the server was rude.  I asked her for new plates, telling her they were wet and dirty.  She made a face and started examining them. ""Just this one is dirty,"" she said.  Great start, I'm thinking.   She messes up our drink order and barely is around expect to drop off our food and then our check.  The replacement silverware she brought was also dirty so we shared what was mostly clean.  I could not get out of there fast enough.  The food was a tiny bit above fast food and definitely not worth the prices charged. The service was rude and super pretentious for no reason.  I've been to other cheesecake factories so I knew going in it's a chain, but the Arundel Mills location is so much better. They are much nicer and serve uniform slices of cheesecake. It was confusing when I got home and saw how little the slice was.  What did they do? Shave a bit off from the factory portion?? I was paying for my takeout order and another customer started talking to me about the bad food there.  I told her about my brown guacamole and bad service.  The cashier said, ""Well you could have ordered a salad.  At least those are good."" Really? I'm saying how horrible the food and service was to another customer and your only addition is to tell me to order something else? I guess I could have spoken to a manager, but at that point we just wanted to get out of there."
Amy A.,"Columbia, MD",2,14,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Judging by the sheer amount of people always at this place I can only conclude that everyone in Columbia has no idea what good food tastes like. This place is everything I hate about chain restaurants, from the terrible food, to the insane prices, and it's constantly packed. I was in here the other day just to get a drink before a movie and the bar was packed with people waiting for tables and they had only 2 bartenders serving the entire restaurant, I felt really bad for them because they seemed like they were doing a good job and really trying. Unfortunately there was a stuck up lady at the bar who kept tapping the bar like she was at a blackjack table and sighing because her drink wasn't getting filled fast enough. I literally only went in here because they closed Uno's and Chammps (not that I like those places either) and there wasn't a closer bar nearby to grab a drink. The only plus side was that the drink was well made. If you like terrible food that's expensive at a place that likes to pretend it's fancy then this is your spot."
Rivkha A.,"Dundalk, MD",27,3,,3.0,5/19/2016,"Once again the service and the food was excellent. We waited a little bit longer than what we were told but the waitress we had was great!! She was very friendly and she was on the ball. The food was very good and the macaroni ball appetizers were delicious.  The only thing I can complain about, sadly, was the woman's restroom. Not clean at all. Trash on the floor. Garbage falling out of the trash cans. There were cobwebs over the bathroom stall. Toilet paper on the floor. Gross!!! Need to do better in that department because the rest of the place is good."
Eric L.,"Elkridge, MD",9,240,5,2.0,10/25/2015,"We braved the crowds and visited on a Saturday night. We waited about 45 minutes which was the estimated time, unfortunately they tried to seat us at a dirty table and we had to wait an additional 5 minutes. Every time we eat here, it is a mixed bag. Some entrees are pretty decent, and some are average at best. I enjoy the chicken madeira and steak diane, but don't enjoy the mashed potatoes that are the consistency of a softball.  On this occasion, I made the mistake of ordering the chicken enchiladas. They were average at best, but one will typically receive a better portion for the $$ at a mexican restaurant. Everyone else's food arrived and the manager came over to the table to explain they had to remake mine. I appreciate the manager coming over, but not the fact that everyone else was halfway done with their food when my entree arrived. The service here is also inconsistent. I think the servers are competent overall from our experiences here, but it seems they have too much to handle.  My advice would be to simply the menu and take out the mediocre items. Also, why not have all ahead seating or the option of reserving using an app?"
Michael H.,"Bloomfield, IN",8,17,1,4.0,8/26/2016,"First time ever to eat in a Cheesecake Factory. All my life I thought it was a place to eat... cheesecake. Serving sizes were enormous! And the menu... I haven't ever seen such a varied and full menu in any restaurant ever! Main dish was Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Cooked to perfection! The server was excellent as well, and was there when we needed her.  Finished off with the Mango and Key Lime cheesecake. Superb! I'll be back!"
Sam L.,"Derwood, MD",0,2,1,1.0,9/9/2015,"I have been waiting on a server after I was seated for 20 minutes, I asked one of the managers and they have not sent anyone over, never going to this location again I am not sure I will ever eat at any of other locations again"
