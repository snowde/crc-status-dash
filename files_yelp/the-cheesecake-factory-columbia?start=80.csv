Christina P.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,38,11,3.0,8/18/2016,"Always go here. For some reason, the pastas do not fit my taste, ever. For one of the dishes, the chicken was the only thing seasoned and the noodles were bland. My favorites are Steak Diane and Chinese Chicken Salad. A year ago or so, I immediately got the bread and butter serviced, but now I have to ask for it. Strange. I also got the Macaroni and Cheese Hamburger, 7/10. Asked for Medium Well and they burned it totally, total blackness all around the burger. I wish they would thoroughly clean the utensils, ugh they were so dirty. Cheescake is also super sweet, diabetes everywhere. Overall it's okay."
Abbas B.,"Rockville, MD",55,242,66,4.0,5/17/2016,Love coming to this Cheesecake Factory.  The service is quick and they even have a curbside service where they will bring your food to your car.  The food is good and the cheesecake is great.  This is our go to restaurant when we can not figure out what we want to eat in Columbia.  Always expect a wait though for at least 10 -15 minutes.  It is open pretty late too.  Love coming here to eat.  One of the better Cheesecake factories I have been too!!
Harper T.,"Columbia, MD",0,19,2,4.0,1/28/2017,"Awesome food as expected, good value for money. Love the bread at this place. Drinks are quite large which is great. Customer service is on point. The only issue I have about this place is that it can get pretty loud once the restaurant starts to fill up and at night you feel one you can't see your food as the lights are turned quite low."
Kash S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,34,3,1.0,10/25/2016,"I have visited this location many times before and have been satisfied with the food. I have always felt that the service in this location was somewhat lacking but my last visit has solidified that. First, my spouse and I were seated in a very small corner table. With my spouse being 6'7 it was ridiculous that the hostess would even place us at the table when he literally would not be able to sit comfortably. We asked for a separate table and were placed directly next to the kitchen. This was not ideal and wasn't understandable as we arrived at around 9:30pm and the restaurant wasn't busy. We asked to be moved again and we're seated in a spacious booth next to the window viewing the outdoor seating. Everything was going well and our food came out quickly. However, I looked out the window and saw an enormous RAT. I was completely disgusted and lost my appetite. I told our waitress and she did not seem to think it was a problem. I will not be returning!!!"
Andrea J.,"Randallstown, MD",88,31,30,5.0,7/1/2016,The Cheesecake Factory will always be my favorite restaurant. The food is superb and the ambience is out of this world.
Charles H.,"Columbia, MD",21,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,"For starters,  I waited to be served for approximately 10 minutes before the server took my drink order.  Secondly, my server never gave me eating utensils,  my order came out and wasn't correct.   I have been coming here for 9 years and the quality of the service isn't great recently.   If you like good customer service,  you may want to go somewhere else."
A.j. R.,"Baltimore, MD",133,207,1433,2.0,3/1/2016,"Really hate this Jain restaurant for several reasons, first it's over priced and over rated. Second, the way the seating is in this chain restaurant limits private and intimate conversations because they jam pack everyone together to maximize the number of customers you can fit into their restaurant. Third did I say they are way over priced and rated. The cheesecake is good but other than that nothing spectacular. Just a glorified chain restaurant meant to make people think they are getting fine dining and a classy atmosphere."
Cherise B.,"Glenelg, MD",29,7,1,1.0,1/18/2017,The WORST customer service! You are better off going to McDonalds! Don't bother complaining to management they are just as bad. Never again! I will take my money to PF Changs!
Trenae H.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",77,35,93,3.0,9/3/2015,Sooooooo I've been to Cheesecake Factory a dozen of times but if you are indecisive like me....its hard to choose because they have so many options to choose from. I get overwhelmed.  Lol I went a few days ago and opted for the Salmon appetizers and Buffalo blasts. Ohhemmgeeee both were very good. If you want a lighter/healthier option..go for the salmon appetizer. The thai glaze with it had a great taste. The buffalo blasts are served with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce...its definitely a shareable appetizer. Now for the main course..I opted for the BBQ chicken salad. It sounded great on the menu and when the waiter brought it to my table..it looked amazing. However..it was NOT!!! The bbq ranch dressing left alot to be desired..it was bland....I asked the waitress to bring me honey mustard..that didnt help either. The chicken was tasteless. I love a good salad but this was not it.  Previously I've tried the Louisiana chicken pasta and it never disappoints. Its seasoned to perfection and I can never eat it all in one sitting. It tastes good reheated too!
Sheree P.,"Washington, DC",39,67,137,4.0,8/6/2015,"On my last visit I decided to try the Garlic Noodles pasta for the first time and it was really good! I usually stick to my usual (Cajun Jambalaya), but this experimental dish turned out to be very good and I'll definitely order it again.  For dessert I got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake...Mmm!! This location has the menu favorites you've come to expect from Cheesecake Factory and good service."
Sri M.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,5,25,5.0,6/6/2016,Hanging out with hubby .Good food .Their chicken samosas are excellent and I love their chicken jambulaya.
Keshia M.,"Washington, DC",165,17,57,3.0,6/30/2017,My food would of been great if they actually gave me what I ordered. Service was slow and the management was not helpful or willing to accommodate us for the crappy service. Definitely will not be having that server again and the manager could use a class on customer service.
Laura B.,"El Paso, TX",78,109,9,3.0,8/14/2016,"The cheesecake is always spot on.  I ventured from my standard White Chcoolate Raspberry or Red Velvet and got the Lemon Raspberry.  It was WAY too tart and the raspberry sauce tasted artificial.  I would not recommend that Cheesecake.  Also, the pineapple mojito is really too sweet.  The asian pear martinis are very good.  We received good service."
Wayne G.,"Baltimore, MD",32,409,25,3.0,5/12/2015,"It's still good and still noisy though less so or we're  getting used to it.  This time I had the factory burrito based on another reviewers recommendation and it's very good.   My wife had the chicken tacos and says they are OK.  The burrito is enough for two meals.  The food tastes good at a fair price however the place is noisy and we could hardly hear the waiter or each other though we could hear people at other tables like AM radio atmospheric jumps.  If we go again it will be between regular meals. We've since tried fried catfish, flatbread, burgers, waffle, eggs, grilled steak, meat loaf, fish tacos and the hot fudge sundae.  Recommended - Factory Burrito, Fried Catfish, Waffle, and the Hot Fudge Sundae. Skip - Grilled Steak, Faltbread, and Chicken Tacos. The service gets confused at times especially weekend evenings.  About five tables around us had trouble getting basics like water and bread. We've returned several times for Sunday brunch and enjoyed it.   The service has improved."
Jackie D.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,7,5,1.0,1/3/2016,My husband and I were given gift cards for Christmas so we thought it would be a nice date. The wait was not long and the host team were very nice. Our server was also very polite. The food was tasty.  However when we were first sat my husbands silverware was really dirty with bits of old food. They brought him another set and again they were dirty. Finally got a set that were clean. I ordered a glass of wine and the glass came out to my table nasty dirty too. Then to top it off when we got forks for our dessert mine was dirty too. As much as I like the food I am thinking of not returning. When we talked to the manager he seemed uninterested and blew us off. There was no accommodation for our experience.
Glenda W.,"Columbia, MD",0,15,,5.0,5/11/2017,"I really enjoy eating out at Cheesecake.  Most entrees are a bit pricey, but ample amount of food and good quality.  Sometimes the wait can be a bit too long.  Otherwise, great place."
Wendy M.,"Burtonsville, MD",0,4,,1.0,11/5/2016,"Horrible experience. I called my order in, waited 15 minutes to go in. The staff was chatting and didn't acknowledge me at all until a couple walked up and after acknowledging them and starting to take their order I had to let them know I was there first. The recipe for the chicken and biscuit was changed for the worst. Will not return to this location. No respect and the food was not good!"
Debra W.,"Sykesville, MD",22,59,31,1.0,1/3/2017,My husband and I went for dinner and to start they tell us 20 min no big deal it's dinner time. Well no sooner than the girl at the counter gives us the pager a waitress comes over with 2 girls she just hugged and tells the girl at the counter hey this girl use to work here can we give her a seat now she doesn't want to wait. The girl at the counter says are you sure and she says again yea let's put her here and grabs some menus. These two girls walked in right after us so we have to wait but ex employees don't??  Than I think it was the manager a white guy with a pin stripe shirt I couldn't tell if he was spitting into his coffee cup or drinking cause I never seen him raise the cup just put it to his mouth. Than after 35 min they seat us. The waiter was attentive came right over for our drinks. We order buffalo blast as an app he got the filet I got the chicken belligio. OMG!!! That's when the wait started. After 25 min we got apps another 35-40 the dinner. You'd think the dinner would be hot NO!!!!  My husband wanted well done got med pink all the way through dry cold!!!  My pasta was cold dry and sticking to the plate I ordered extra cream sauce and the noodles sucked that up. The chicken was cold. Terrible!  The manager came over to the table beside us and says to them. I'm so sorry for the wait your food shouldn't take much longer. Never came over to us to say nothing. The food has just fell off. I paid $67 and some change and I'd expect a descent meal!!
Lilyanc Y.,"Fulton, MD",0,1,3,4.0,10/28/2016,"I love the cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory! Especially the vanilla cheesecake, low sugar but yummy!!!  And I always order their spaghetti. The plate is quite large. Price is reasonable."
Tisha S.,"Capitol Heights, MD",537,341,214,4.0,8/15/2016,Can I hear for National cheesecake weekend and to get my half-price cheesecake. I did not realize that they were $3 versus 6 I thought the $6 was the half price otherwise I would have picked up more. Our food was good even though the wait was over an hour. It was very crowded but it was still a very long wait.
