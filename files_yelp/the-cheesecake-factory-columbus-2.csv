Ryan C.,"Morral, OH",61,101,67,5.0,8/4/2017,"Fantastic. Absolutely reeks of quality, outstanding service, and value.  One of the better meals I have had in a while.  Coupled with outstanding service, this was a win.  I don't often leave a five-star review, but this one was earned. The food was perfect, the atmosphere was great.  Resulting in, a wonderful evening. You will not be disappointed to dine here."
Misty H.,"Martinsburg, WV",0,34,13,2.0,11/11/2017,"Go for the cheesecake and eat dinner elsewhere. Food was mediocre. Our food arrived about 15 minutes apart so we were eating at different times. The milkshake was just milk with Oreos smashed (it was warm so the ice cream was completely melted). Overall, for the price there are many other options to get better food in Columbus. The cheesecake isn't really worth the long wait."
Robert S.,"Hilliard, OH",1,31,,1.0,11/5/2017,"This place is WAY overrated. I was hardly impressed. They should call this place The Sugar Factory I had dinner at a Japanese restaurant in the Polaris mall food court where I got a huge portion of food at a great price, I decided to come here for dessert. All I could taste in the two different cheesecakes I ordered were just huge amounts of sugar. The pieces of cheesecake I ordered were caramel pecan and some kind of truffle, they're supposed to be different from each other but tasted nearly exactly the same and each layer I bit into had hardly any difference in taste besides just tasting like different textures of sugar. I could hear my kidneys and liver shrieking in pain because of the sugar overload from each bite. This stuff is EXPENSIVE too! Totally not worth the money. they charge a fortune for just one piece of cheesecake, if it tasted amazing I wouldn't mind that, when I go to a grocery store though and buy a mass-produced piece of cheesecake for 1/5 of the cost it should NOT taste better than the one that costs a fortune that i ordered from this restaurant. One of the bakery staff had an attitude with me when I tried ordering too. I was standing in front of the bakery where there were two or three people working on the other side and I waited for someone to ask me if I needed help, I wasn't sure if this where I was supposed to order. No one asks me if I need anything after standing for a good moment. It seems like they assume people go out of their way to stare and admire their cheesecake in the bakery display like it's the Mona Lisa or something. I ask one of the women behind the counter if I can order cheesecake to go from the bakery counter and with an attitude she says ""she needs to help you"".  If you want a nice sit-down restaurant experience there are TONS of other options near by and if you want a great value for your money the food court in the mall has good options too."
Shuo F.,"Dublin, OH",179,151,74,4.0,11/11/2017,"I honestly haven't been to Cheesecake Factory for over 5 years. If you've been to Cheesecake Factory, then you've been to them all. The ambience is same everywhere. It's nice and casual with food for everyone. It's a great place to sit down with your friends to eat after shopping. That's probably why every Cheesecake Factory is always packed with long lines, so always prepare to wait! I think they've expanded their menu since 5 years ago. It's now 20 pages long with more choices!"
Basima A.,"Washington, DC",175,66,163,4.0,8/3/2017,"My favorite book? The Cheesecake Factory menu.   When you're with your friends and your conversation transitions into the inevitable ""where do you want to go?"", ""I don't know, where do you want to go?""-- this is the place you go.   There isn't anything I find particularly special about their food (with the exception of their cheesecakes), other than the fact that there is literally something for everyone, and you'll never hate what you order.  It's incredibly consistent and you'll never leave hungry.  Like, ever.  The only thing you'll hate is deciding what to order because there are SO many options.   Also, portions.. WHO EATS THIS MUCH FOOD??  Each entree is large enough to feed a small village and then some.  Now, their cheesecake is above par, although I don't recall actually ever eating cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, because there is simply no room left after dinner.  But I'm resourceful, so I always order it to goooo! And enjoy it as a midnight snack. Do make sure you eat the bread.  Always so warm and SO delicious.   Favorite apps:  1. avocado rolls- if you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out.  2. Calamari- perfectly crispy and so very tasty. 3. Warm crab and Artichoke dip- I could eat this all day, every day.   As for the entrees, I mean, I've never gotten anything I haven't liked, and as far as I'm concerned  neither will you!  My go-to is definitely the chicken Alfredo or the Thai salmon, both good.   If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, make sure you call ahead and make a reservation. It tends to get quite crowded.  Give their Nutella cheesecake a try. It's pretty spectacular!!"
Stephanie L.,"Columbus, OH",64,31,6,4.0,11/9/2017,"I've always enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory and I was again very pleased with my cheesecake...the cafe au lait one this time. Delicious! The food was just ok (and I expect very good food from this restaurant). I will say the manager impressed me, I had originally ordered the cauliflower appetizer, and she came out to let me know the cauliflower was not up to par. She then asked if I'd like to try another appetizer. I appreciate the attention to detail and quality."
Bethany K.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",90,323,248,4.0,3/22/2017,"This is a solid Cheesecake Factory.  I have been here quite a few times, and haven't had any real issues.  The only actual complaint that I ever have is the wait times.   Other than that, I have had great meals and drinks here.  They get my order right every time. They can be considered on the more expensive side of things, but usually things around Polaris are.  So, use this as a celebration or special night out meal only if needed. Try the RED VELVET cheesecake!  Quite decedent."
Lisa T.,"Morgantown, WV",0,48,,3.0,11/7/2017,"Everything here was great except for our initial encounter, which is why I can't give it more than three stars. The good - Our waitress was good. She was efficient. It was late and my kids were hungry. She could tell and got everything out ASAP. The food was good.  Cheesecake was obviously good.  The bad - As much as we liked our waitress, she couldn't get our wine bottle open. No big deal. My husband handled it, but then she just left the bottle on the table and didn't pour it. Again, no big deal, but not what you are really expecting. My son has a shellfish allergy. I asked right off what our options were. Waitress informed us that everything is made to order and his meal would be made on a separate grill, cooks would switch gloves and to order whatever we would like. Awesome! That was great. But, I have a sneaking suspicion that didn't actually happen. I'm not sure, but I just didn't get that feeling. Regardless, his meal was great so I can't comment more on that.  The worst part though was the banter between the hostesses. We had about a 20 minute wait to be seated. Now I get that this is in Ohio and they may not be used to the southern accent. But as we stood next to the hostess station and waited, a woman with a very southern accent came up and spoke to the hostess. The hostess immediately turned around and made fun of that woman with the other hostess. Very unprofessional. That really shouldn't happen. This lady wasn't rude or demanding. And she got made fun of right off the bat. And loud enough that I could hear it. Would it make me never go here again? No. But, it just didn't sit well. The staff should be better trained."
Paige E.,"Columbus, OH",11,53,42,5.0,12/26/2016,"We come here monthly. By far the best nachos in Columbus. When you order a burger medium rare, that's how it comes. Love this place!!"
Joanna W.,"Columbus, OH",53,39,20,4.0,6/22/2017,I order from the skinny menu and my boyfriend gets the honey chicken or something from the pasta. I enjoy that the calories are printed in the menu so you know how many are in each product. The menu selection is plentiful and the service is okay. I tried the cheesecake once and it was very sweet so I made two desserts out of it. The wait is very long most of the times went (granted we eat during normal dinner hours so we expect it). The portion sizes are large so there are always leftovers.
Kevin C.,"Columbus, OH",1389,247,1105,5.0,2/19/2016,"Birthday date night with my wife. We arrived Friday night about 6:50p and were seated at 7:35. This place was packed and super busy, but the service was top notch, and the staff were very attentive. It's somewhat dark which makes it a bit hard to see the menu, and the menu is 19 pages long! That's a bit overwhelming, however there are only about 4 pages that are specific for food and the rest is appetizers, desserts, and other things. Once we figured out the 2 pages that interested us we decided quickly on what to eat. I chose the Chicken Madeira which according to the menu was sauteed chicken breast topped with asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese, covered with fresh mushroom madeira sauce and a side of mashed potatoes.   This meal was very tasty and the portion size was rather large. I was able to take home half of my meal and have it for lunch the next day.   We shared the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (Cheesecake with Caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger and Reese's peanut butter cups).  What a wonderful piece of heaven this cheesecake was.   The food is very good and the portion sizes are very large, however the price for the meals and the cheesecake are also high.  I would like to see a place like this reduce the size of their meals, which would allow the price to come down as well.   We had a wonderful visit and enjoyed our date night."
Adrianne G.,"Columbus, OH",0,18,,2.0,7/15/2017,"This is not the best Cheesecake Factory I've visited. Every time I go, they seem to be out of something. This time they were out of the brown bread and ice cream. On top of that the women's restroom was disgusting...and out of toilet paper. Do not recommend this location at all."
D S.,"Columbus, OH",0,32,7,1.0,10/9/2017,Had dinner there today.  Awful awful AWFUL food!! My son's chicken tenders were over-fried and there was more crispy batter than chicken in the tenders. I had the large chicken burrito.  BIG mistake!  It was full of plain white rice which was so undercooked that it was crunchy in my mouth! 75% of the burrito was filled with the hard white rice and it had no seasoning!  I think there were 2 tiny pieces of chicken in the entire large burrito!   I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in almost a decade and I definitely won't be back!
sharon s.,"Novato, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/14/2017,"My sister and I frequent the Cheesecake Factory as a tradition to celebrate our birthdays.  We were seated at 12:20pm in a section that was full of 2-top and 4-top tables. There was no indication, to us, that the entire left side of this section was all one group.  The waitress took our order in a timely manner, but after about 20 minutes, the wrong appetizer was delivered to our table. The correct appetizer didn't arrive until 1:15 - just 2-3 minutes before our main entrees were served.   We noticed that around 12:45, the waiters were yelling, ""Who had the...."" to the group of small tables, as they served their meals and realized the section was filled with a business group.    Once the group finished eating (at about the time we were being served), an awards meeting began.  The leader was standing right by my seat, (with her ""behind"" in my face) calling people up for awards, hugs, and photos.  This STOPPED the wait staff from checking on our table, and stopped our ability to hold a conversation.  The manager who said that she had already dealt with a previous problem regarding that group offered us a weak apology and a slice of cheesecake. Pathetic.  It looks like we'll find a new venue for our traditional birthday lunch."
Leeanne B.,"New Philadelphia, OH",25,6,4,1.0,8/15/2017,"Very disappointing. Ordered the $20 Fettuccini Alfredo with blackened chicken.  First of all, the chicken was not blackened, but the worst part was the sauce. It had no flavor and was water thin. I expressed my disappointment to the waitress, and after seeing that I barely ate any, I thought she'd take it off my bill, but she charged me full price. I will never go back to the Cheesecake Factory. Never."
Annie K.,"Dublin, OH",7,40,30,5.0,9/3/2017,Love the location of this place right next to the mall! All he cheesecakes are amazing and they have so many options! Prices for everything can be pretty expensive here though. Probably around $30+ after taxes and tips just for an entree and cheesecake. It gets really busy and crowded sometimes and it's hard to hear with all the TVs playing at once and servers bustling around
Marsha H.,"Miami, FL",38,9,,3.0,9/5/2017,Not one of my favorites anymore didn't know what to order so I asked about their new Korean  fried cauliflower that my daughters rave about and he was telling me that it wasn't good that he would never order it so I ordered the dynamite shrimp which is supposed to be crispy temper and there was nothing crispy about it at all it was a very lack luster appetizer my husband's hamburger was supposed to be meeting him and was more well done and his fries didn't come out until he was halfway done with that very  attentive waiter
Johnson Y.,"Hilliard, OH",0,80,20,3.0,8/3/2017,"The cheesecake is good, don't get me wrong, but nothing special above store bought.  It's always too busy to just come in and sit down-always a wait."
Wing Yan K.,"Columbus, OH",57,63,189,3.0,2/1/2017,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory for a while. One things that I like is their menu is endless and have so much selection. Of course, I can't finish the meal without ordering their cheesecake."
Francis M.,"Dublin, OH",48,58,6,5.0,8/12/2017,I'm noticing a theme here with the online menus not posting prices. This makes it very frustrating when deciding on trying new things at new places. *Edit* Since customer service responded within 24 hours of this review and showed me where I was wrong initially the rating goes from one star to 5 stars. Kudos Cheesecake Factory great customer service goes a long way! :-)
Alice H.,"Mount Vernon, OH",7,7,,5.0,3/26/2017,Met friends here for lunch. Had great service and the Chicken Parm sandwich was wonderful! Also had Chris's Outragous Cheesecake! Superb! Great experience.
Adam H.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,,2.0,12/23/2016,Usually I love this place but I just spent 30 dollars on a steak that had to be sent back 3 times. Can't believe I didn't get my meal for free. Not to happy.  P.s. I'm usually not one to complain
Cary K.,"Columbus, OH",18,54,2,1.0,4/21/2017,It shocks me that The Cheesecake Factory does not filter their water!? Columbus water is not healthy and tastes horrible! It's just tacky to offer gross city water!? Get it together people!
Michael B.,"Columbus, OH",4,6,8,2.0,10/7/2017,"usually this is a favorite place to go, but my family went on 10/7/17 and were disappointed... I tried the gumbo for the first time and it just tasted like chicken broth with a lot of pepper... I've had authentic gumbo and can make good gumbo... it was no where close... I took only 2 bites. my daughter had the Louisiana pasta... the chicken was good but the pasta was watery and bland , she only ate the chicken. my waiter was nice but never offered a substitute dish or comp. I would have at least expected that he offer to get the manager. I hate wasting money but that's exactly what I feel I did with my dish. and because they didn't try to make things right... I will look to other places to eat before going there. just grab the cheesecake as carry out."
Craig R.,"Delaware, OH",6,11,,2.0,7/9/2017,"Since I don't believe in providing a 1- or 5-star review upon one visit to a restaurant, I'll refrain from doing so this time. However, if I were to do that, I'd grade my latest experience 1-star.  As far as the pros go, the menu is filled with so many options, no matter how picky one might be, he/she is bound to find something to their liking. The server was also quite friendly. In saying all of that, however, as I was in the mood for something ""Cajun"" and I stumbled upon a speciality dish called ""Cajun Chicken Littles,"" I ordered that and came away extremely disappointed. The dish is described on the menu as: ""Boneless Breast of Chicken Pieces, Spiced, Breaded and Fried Crisp..."" When I took my first bite, I could tell there was absolutely nothing ""Cajun"" about it and nothing ""little"" about it either. When the waitress returned, I asked for some Cajun seasoning, since it had appeared I was served two orders of regular chicken tenders with barbecue sauce on the side. When she returned, she said, ""I'm sorry, but this order isn't Cajun and isn't little. Here's some blackened seasoning. Hopefully that helps."" Really? A dish is called ""Cajun Chicken Littles"" and 2/3 of the title is inaccurate? If I had known the ""Cajun Chicken"" wasn't Cajun, I would have ordered something else. Not only that, but while I quickly lost my appetite and didn't eat much of the disappointing meal, I wasn't offered a discount for the slip-up. Hopefully my dog likes the leftovers..."
Serena B.,"Saint Marys, GA",12,2,4,5.0,12/20/2016,"The bartender was really nice even while swamped with orders. If you like fruity drinks then I suggest the passion fruit mojito and typhoon punch. As for cheesecake the smores was great. My husband and I had a great time for our one year anniversary date. The place was beautiful, the atmosphere had a great vibe and I would definitely recommend to eat here."
Garrett Y.,"Milton, MA",190,312,987,4.0,9/5/2015,"This review is for this location. One can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. We came here for dinner this evening (Saturday). There were 7 of us, and we knew there would be something for everyone here. We ordered the buffalo chicken blasts, tex mex egg rolls and the guacamole egg rolls as appetizers. All were yummy as usual. For dinner I had the southern fried catfish dinner. The fish was nice and juicy, and not too doughy. Strawberry lemonade was fantastic! My family ordered dessert but I didn't try any as I was full from appetizers and dinner. Service was excellent... Thank you Megan! As we can here later in the evening (around 9:30 pm) there was ample parking. However, I am sure parking is scarcer during peak dinner or mall hours."
Dave S.,"Dublin, OH",72,100,547,4.0,7/2/2015,"A very nice restaurant uniforms are nice u come down a long hallway leading to the hostess stand if the line is back at the front door it's busy. Walking down the long hallway is nice stone is all around u. Marble or granite  or looks like it.on ur right the slices of heaven. In front of u the dining room low lighting is good they have it.  They have nine types of cheese cake maybe more drinks are good food is a lot your going to take some home. I know they aren't the healthiest of places to eat some times u might over indulge"" eat this not that"" the books don't like them at all so maybe read some of he menu before Going out but other then that a great place to eat and sample some slices of heaven!"
Rebecca B.,"Tampa, FL",0,34,28,5.0,6/9/2017,"Best happy hour around! 4-6pm weekdays. $6 for most apps. We orders the nachos and they are huge and delicious! Brought leftovers home. Also ordered sliders and figured there would be 1 or 2 but there were 4 sliders and they were delicious! Great value! Definitely will be back. Note the happy hour is only good in the bar area but we had a nice table in a quiet area. Only complaint was that it was cold inside, but just know to being a coat next time."
Joe C.,"Lewis Center, OH",1,14,,3.0,5/10/2017,"Made the mistake of coming here the day of OSU graduation, so everyone and their mothers decided to eat here. The wait was over an hour. Four people at my table ended up getting sick. I have a fever and pretty bad muscle aches. Maybe in the mad rush to serve the crowd, no one followed food safety guidelines."
Manu P.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,1.0,5/22/2017,I was in Cheesecake today I waited for 15 minutes just for some to say that my server will be with me shortly and had to wait another 10 minutes for some one to show up very bad way to treating guests. While I sit there and watch I see servers are taking care of other guests who came after us but ignored us. Is it because of the color of my skin that made me treated the way I was treated? Or dose Cheescake factory dose not good customer service?  I walked out because I do not want to eat in a place where there no basic courtesy and had my brunch at Brio where I was treated really well.  It was refreshing to see some one caring for you. You guys need to learn from your competitor how to treat your guests.
Tami H.,"Sunbury, OH",11,3,,1.0,2/14/2017,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, I did contact you...you assured me that You were very sorry for our experience,and sent us a whole $10 dollars as an ""apology"" Considering we spent $70 on dinner $10 is quite a slap in the face! A restaurant that can't refill drinks or bring hot food to the table,yet expect us to return because you sent $10 ?You should really be a comedy club."
Sean M.,"Cincinnati, OH",113,104,66,4.0,8/28/2016,"My girlfriend and I stopped here for a late-night snack and dessert.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla, two pops and a slice of cheesecake.  It was $30+ for the stop. The service was GREAT.  We loved our server.  She was fun, energetic, helpful, and all of the other words that go with a great server.  She even pointed out that she was a SERVER, NOT a waitress.  She served people.  Fantastic. The patio was also a nice atmosphere for our late night visit. When the check came though, we remembered why we only go to Cheesecake Factory occasionally.  Wow is it overpriced."
K. K.,"New Albany, OH",18,62,4,2.0,2/15/2017,"Decided to skip the crowd & do carryout for Valentine's Day dinner.  Called & ordering was fast & easy.  Pulled up to the to-go parking and called to let them know I was waiting.  About 10 minutes later a girl came out with the food & took another 5 minutes to run my credit card.  I got there right at the quoted time, but food didn't feel very warm.  Got home a few minutes later & it was pretty cold & mashed potatoes were super lumpy.  Portions seem much smaller than when you dine-in.  Also they should put sauces on the side so food doesn't get soggy.  Overall it was an ok experience, but definitely not worth $57."
Amanda K.,"Toledo, OH",0,3,,1.0,8/16/2017,"We always come to the Cheesecake Factory but tonight was the Worse service in the entire world!!!!!!!!! I have served and bartended for over 2.5 years so I completely understand what it is like and I'm not one to complain but tonight was unreal!!!!...I ordered a lettuce wrap with no chicken just fresh veggies and my boyfriend ordered a ribeye steak with mash potatoes and green beans...our food took over an hr to receive on a Wednesday night that was not busy by any means. We have been here on many weekends where our food never took this long..We got our food and my boyfriend only got his steak and green beans. I asked our server what took so long he said he was waiting on the mashed potatoes and didn't want to wait any longer so he brought out our food...which was fine. He said he would bring out the mashed potatoes as soon as they were done.....But of course By the time he was about done with his steak and green beans he THEN got his mash potatoes....mind you this was after waiting already an hour for our food. The manager brought it out and asked us if we were doing ok still, we said yes. He Did not even bother to apologize for the long wait nor did the server even bother to ask us if we wanted a salad or more bread as we were waiting for our food. We had to ASK him if we could have more bread!!!!....So ridiculous on both their parts.....How is it that The table that sat across from us arrived 20 minutes after we did and received their food before us ??? Completely unacceptable .....Service was far too slow....worse dining experience."
Christy J.,"Shelby, OH",4,5,2,5.0,2/20/2017,We stopped after a trip to the columbus zoo. It was 3pm on a beautiful Saturday. We were told the wait was at least 40 min. We decided to wait since we had never been here before. We were given a menu on request to pass the time. After our 40 min wait we were taken to a table. We were promptly greeted by our waitress who took our drink order and we went ahead and gave our meal order as well since we had ample time to view the menu. Everything came in a timely fashion. Drinks then the mac and cheese balls (delicious). With in moments our meal arrived. Our choices were the bacon burger with fries and a meal of steak Diane/ shrimp scampi with red mashed potatoes. Crusty bread was served on the side. The food was amazing with the exception on the fries. we had a great waitress. A piece of Adam's pb/cho cheesecake was taken home. The meal was excellent but pricey. No alcohol was ordered and our bill was 66.00 for 2 people. If we are ever in the area we will be back.
Matteo P.,"Milan, Italy",1,25,137,4.0,8/16/2016,"I come here becuase I always look ""the big bang theory"" on italian tv. So I really MUST come.  The restaurant is a bit big for my standard. Seems a big chain rest.  But waiters was really nice and professional. Food was really good.  One thing. One night my choice was finished. A teryaky steak or something like that. They refuse to serve me this with a different cut but same treatmen because they wasn't sure that can be good as the standard.  I never eat it so they can serve me anything (remember I'm italian and we don't have cheescake factory). But they prefer keep they standard at high level.  And this for me is very professional."
Amanda D.,"Columbus, OH",31,80,217,2.0,7/25/2017,"We have been to Cheesecake Factory a bunch of times. The last few times we have visited the experience has gone downhill a little each time. This time tonite was the worst. Being a Tuesday we thought it would be in and out. We sat down in a timely manner but everything else was super super slow. We waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came over. When he finally came we ordered our drinks and our food. The people next to us got their food right after we ordered. They ate, paid and left. Still no food for us. The waiter said it's coming about 3 times. Then the manager came and apologized and said it's coming. Then another couple sat down next to us. We finally got our food, about 50 minutes later. Meanwhile the couple next to us ate, paid and left before we got our check paid so we could leave. We assumed that after all that we would have some kind of comp on our bill. We did not. Then, to make things worse, I left my (very sentimental) birthday card on the booth seat when we got up. I realized when we were pulling out of the parking lot. I called to have them grab it and the hostess said no one has seen it. I spoke to a manager and she finally admitted that the buser saw it, said there was nothing in it so he threw it away. Super disappointed. The food was okay."
Natallia S.,"Hilliard, OH",37,11,7,3.0,6/19/2016,"This location has its cons and pros.  On the bright side their bread is amazing, there are also couple good things on the menu. Avocado toast is my fav for now. Service is also pretty good For some reason in summer it is ABSOLUTELY FREEZING inside, when it's hot and you wear tshirt and shorts you will most likely freeze in the first 10 minutes there.  In winter it is super cold, especially the waiting area. I'm not sure if it's just the building designed that way or they are trying to make customers feel uncomfortable so they can leave sooner and there would be more rotation.  I don't like being cold or waiting over an hour for a table and than another 40 minutes for my food to come out. Most possibly be back as the food is decent and desserts are good but it's not my favorite spot"
Mohammad Y.,"Youngstown, OH",95,1,,5.0,3/5/2017,"Was in town for the Arnold Classic and decided to come here for dinner. It was a great pleasure having  Alena as our server! Although she was busy and had many other tables to deal with, she still managed to provide us with 5 star service! She was so friendly and she consistently checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. Next time I'm in Columbus I will be back thanks to the wonderful service."
