Lisa R.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",41,133,652,4.0,10/7/2012,"Stopped into this busy Cheesecake Factory on a saturday afternoon and had a rather pleasant visit. Wait time for a regular table was a half hour, however we were able to grab a high top right by the bar and were served right away. Started off our ""lunch"" with some fried crispy cheese.  The breading was a big thick which made the frying a little strong.  There was more fried breading than actual cheese, but it was still ""ok"". The cheese was a combo of two different types which was fairly tasty, just not much of it.  I had the cheeseburger, can't remember the exact name just remember that it was charbroiled and had cheddar. The burger was not a typical ""burger"" per say, it was served on a partial loaf...baguette size. The burger was rather tasty and well cooked. Great flavor in the burger without drying it out, still a good amount of juice in the burger. The fries were very tasty and not overly salted. Just the right amount of crisp, salty, and moist.  The better half had the salmon. He enjoyed the salmon itself, didn't really care for the sides. The broccoli, as he reports, was cold so he didn't really eat any of it. His other side was mashed potatoes, he ate some of those but he's not a huge mashed potato fan. Service was quick and very pleasant. I would recommend and would return."
Y G.,"Dublin, OH",0,1,,2.0,11/2/2014,"The food was ok. Main course serving was big, we shared between two adults and one child.  We went there on Sunday at 1:20pm. The receiptionist told us that the wait time was 30 minutes. We were seated at 2:15pm. If we knew that we had to wait 55 minutes we would have gone to another place. I felt that our time was not well respected. While I was waiting i watched people coming and the receiptionist told everybody that the wait time was 30 munites. Hmmmm.... If people already have waited for 30 minutes, they are likely to keep waiting. But i did not like the strategy.  After we were seated at 2:15pm, our order was taken at 2:40pm. We clearly put the menu down and waited for someone to take our order at 2:20pm.  Our salad arrived at 3:10pm, main course 3:35pm, dessert 4pm and left at 4:15pm. My daughter missed her gym class since i did not expect the lunch to be almost 3 hour long.  So if you have something scheduled, dont take the waiting time that the receiptionist tells seriously, or double it."
Zach G.,"Kalamazoo, MI",14,72,3,5.0,3/16/2014,As good as any other Cheesecake Factory.  Whenever I come the waiting staff is great and the food is always on point.  I suggest it!
LeeAnn N.,"Akron, OH",155,254,28,3.0,8/1/2011,"First off, I hate chains. Why go to chains when there are so many other amazing local places? Maybe it's just me but chain food is bleh.  First the menu itself if way too large...and they also needed cleaned. I hate sticky menus so we'll list it as a pet peeve. With pages and pages to pick from it can often be a tedious task. Also, the prices are a bit ridiculous for again, chain food.  I don't have a problem paying $15+ for a dish but from a chain, I do. I'd rather go spend that money elsewhere on something that is probably prepared fresh and with local ingredients. Anyways, off my pedestal about chains. My fiance and I couldn't decide what to order so we went with the quesadillas, pot-stickers and calamari. Apps for dinner, sounds good to me. All  3 were delicious, my favorite being the quesadillas. Warm, filled with cheese and chicken and filling! The guac was also really good. Potstickers OK and wasn't digging the fried calamari. But overall, it was all good. And Dessert! The reason why I would come here....in the past. I was SO disappointed in my cheesecake. All 5 of us got something different and I got the tiramasu. Love cheesecake and tiramasu so I thought this would be perfect. My piece, for $8,50 was tiny and everyone even commented on that. To say it was 1/2 the size of the others would be pushing it. TINY! Also, I miss the crust on this cheesecake like the others had. Also, def. more tiramasu than cheesecake. And the whip cream is so nasty, def. couldn't get that down.  Overall, for the price, I'd rather spend my $$$ elsewhere. Way better food and desserts to be had."
Nate F.,"Oregon, OH",0,6,3,3.0,8/16/2013,"I have mixed feelings based on a mixed experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  First, lets get the primary concern out of the way... The Cheesecake was outstanding.  I mean, wow, it was really good.  Rich and creamy, the Oreo Cheesecake that I had order was perfection, and worth a trip down to Columbus all by itself.  My wife's cheesecake was equally as good.  The rest of the meal is where things didn't go so well.  My burger, which I ordered medium, was over well done and dry.  My wife had a shrimp plate and got food poisoning from it.  The kid's food looked average in every way.  Considering the price of the food, I would advise anyone just to stay away from their meals.  Cheesecake should be the only reason anyone goes to cheesecake factory.  If you go for that reason alone, you will be more than happy.  Anything else, just stay away."
Tipper T.,"Marysville, OH",1414,236,648,5.0,9/30/2011,"OK ...... So .... The Cheesecake Factory IS One of my Favorite Places to Dine ! ...... The Cheesecake of course ..is great ...BUT .....

Sabrina L.,"Columbus, OH",68,289,24,2.0,9/19/2011,"Over-rated. If I was only going for cheeseake then Cheesecake Factory could get four stars, but the food is meh at best.  Yes the menu is huge, but bigger isn't always better.  The pasta is gummy, the mashed potatoes seem microwaved, and the portions are giant in a way that is unappealing to me. They don't take reservations so if you're going at a busy time be ready to wait.  Or just get some cheesecake to go and save yourself the bother."
Jen F.,"Galloway, OH",7,35,8,2.0,10/6/2013,Came to the cheese cake factory at Polaris for dinner. It was a usual CCF experience. The food was excellent!  We had ordered the Mac & Cheese burger and Romano crusted chicken (add extra sauce on the side ) and split them. They both are very tasty meals. We sat at the bar and the service was good. A usual down fall at the CCF is the service but tonight we were pleased. We decided to get some desert to eat half now an take have home we ordered a red velvet OMG delicious !! Then the banana cream... Tasted good but such a small slice. It was 1/2 the size of the red velvet   Was told it was pre cut by corporate ?? They don't make them on location?? So I'm Paying 8$ for a pie that is who knows how old and not fresh??  We had to order a third piece to take home because I wasn't sharing mine   A little disappointed :/
Kimberly S.,"Marengo, OH",9,48,13,1.0,3/2/2013,"Want to drop a couple pounds real quick? Then this is the place for you!  For those of you unfamiliar with Norovirus, it is basically an ""oral-fecal"" illness that derives from poor sanitation combined with food handling. Now I'm no expert, but with some information from the Columbus & Morrow County health departments & some research on my end, I've become very familiar.  You see, I was the first of a handful of people to be afflicted with said Norovirus through the Cheesecake Factory of Polaris. Thankfully some of us came forward & reported it to the health department & they are taking it very seriously. I didn't know this was possible, so next time you suspect you've been contaminated by a restaurant, give them a call. Don't expect it to end there though folks, as they need to be able to prove your food-borne illness came from that particular restaurant, so if you are willing (& I was, as this was my VERY EXPENSIVE birthday dinner), they will ask that you submit stool samples. Specific stool samples. Embarrassing? Yup. But we have a baby, so poop is something I'm a little accustomed to, unfortunately. Anyhow, I digress. My husband was so excited to take me out for a nice birthday dinner.  We just moved here & I've never been to any Cheesecake Factory, so I was stoked! The service? It was good! Our food? It too, was good! The first time..... The other 8-10 times when it came back up, not so good. Trying to care for a 1 year old the day after your birthday with volcanic eruptions coming out of both ends? Priceless... Their only saving grace is that our son didn't get sick as well. Apparently Yelp filters out reviews in an attempts to save businesses from what may be competitors, who are saying bad things about their business. It's a shame because this place gave me FOOD POISONING... In my opinion, this should be the first thing fellow Yelpers see..."
Cheri C.,"Columbus, OH",0,20,,2.0,8/19/2013,"Let me say first that the Cheesecake itself is excellent.  Being the restaurant namesake, I had high expectations and they definitely delivered.  But... the rest of the food is not so great and a bit on the expensive side.  ($16 for runny Chicken Fettuccine, anyone???)  The ambiance is a bit strange as well.  There were some nicer dressed folks out for a nice Saturday night dinner, mixed in with mall folks in their shorts and flip-flops.  Might be back for a lunch, but would opt to share an entree, or maybe just follow the crowd at the dessert line instead. :)"
Amy F.,"Powell, OH",3,3,,2.0,9/19/2014,"Their fish and chips meal was batter and chips.  Of course the cheese cake was wonderful, but that was one of the worst meals we've ever experienced there, very disappointed.  Service was great."
Mia A.,"Columbus, OH",2,10,3,4.0,10/25/2014,"I love cheesecake factory. I love how they have little bit of EVERYTHING. I come here regularly after work, trying different things. my favorite so far is their chicken wrap. If you never had it before, definitely try their chicken wrap. it comes with 3 different sauces and they are delicious. you can tell they are a little bit over priced, but as long as it is constant and good I don't mind coming here every now and then!"
Ali H.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",18,37,,2.0,6/13/2014,"First time to this location, sadly will be the last.  We were a party of 7. 5 adults and 2 kids celebrating a families birthday.  We were seated and greeted promptly but the good ended there.  Our food 50 minutes to arrive. Whrn it did 2 people received their food.  No mention or recognition from the server as the people all around us who were seated after us were served.  About 10 minutes later 2 more plates came.  5 more minutes and the final plate and kids meal arrived.This kids pizza was so hot and the cashew chicken looked like someones reheated burnt leftovers, with no cashews.  All of the requests were forgotten such as no tomatoes, add cheese on a burger.  The manager came out and looked embarrassed by what the cashew chicken looked like and offered to replace but they were out of cashews and as we were already there over an hour we declined. He took care of the dish but the whole experience was lack luster. None of us ordered  dessert bc we were just over the whole experience.  Hope you get it together Cheesecake, reminded me of Applebee's...."
Samara C.,"Hilliard, OH",5,17,1,4.0,11/29/2013,The Sheppard pie waz amazing very flavorful. The salad on the hand was severely under dressed. Waitress was very knowledgeable.  The only sad part I can't eat the cheese cake
T F.,"San Diego, CA",1,57,,2.0,8/13/2014,"We arrive - we are seated in the patio because the inside of the restaurant is just too cold.  The person who greeted us (ended up being the manager) was pleasant.  She seated us. So I am there with my beau...we are waiting.  It takes like 10 minutes for our waiter to come...his name is Kerrod (very rude and unfriendly & his work uniform was dirty which makes me concerned for him to handle my food).  So we only ask for water & a glass of wine...it takes him almost another 15 minutes to bring that back to our table - there are at least 5 other parties that sit down and he barely comes back.  My boyfriend asked him were we allotted bread.  His response ""oh yea, I guess I can bring it....""....so we wait.  Then he takes our order.  My boyfriend has never been here so he is asking questions.  Kerrod seemed annoyed and he ended up placing our order.  I got a salad and my boyfriend ordered a burger.  Others are sat down and we still don't have our food.  I am getting annoyed so we decide to leave.  The manager (Allison) comes over and asks us what's the problem.  I tell her about the food and service...oh did I mention our waiter came out with sunglasses on??  Weird....so we are about to leave.  She rushes and gets our food and gives it to us on the house.  We wait almost an hour and my boyfriend's burger was cold...maybe because it was sitting in back the whole time.  I was so annoyed I  left my food.  Allison tried to accommodate us.  She gave us a gift card which was nice, but dang, did we have to go thru such drastic measures?  Our waiter had a crappy attitude from the word go....so he ruined my boyfriend's first experience at the factory..."
Katherine B.,"Hilliard, OH",64,75,10,3.0,8/9/2010,"My husband and I visited the Cheesecake Factory for the first time this past Saturday night.  We found a $25.00 gift card that we had received for a gift a while back and forgotten about, so it was an unexpected treat. My first thought upon walking in was how noisy the place was.  One traverses a rather long hallway when entering from the parking lot, and you are unable to see the interior of the restaurant...but boy could you hear it!!  It didn't seem so bad when we got in there, but we did opt to eat outside on the patio, somewhat unusual for us. The server was terrific.  He was attentive enough, but not overly so...I hate it when they hand around.  He did warn us about the size of the entrees, and that was very much appreciated.  He was also  ready with answers about entrees and opinions about which he liked better.  I KNOW I might  not like what the server likes, but when I ask them what they like, it's nice when they've actually sampled the items on the menus enough to have preferences!! I ordered the barbecued salmon.  It came with smashed potatoes, onion rings, and corn succotash.  The salmon was fine, cooked okay, but rather ordinary.  So were the potatoes and onions rings...pretty much what you'd expect and a thousand other restaurants.  They weren't hot...so that's a ding.  The corn succotash was delicious...I was expecting corn with lima beans or green beans.  No!!  It was full of cubed zucchini and yellow squash and tasted hot and fresh. My husband had a steak, cooked medium rare, which came with two enormous batter fried onion rings and french fries.  Wayyyyy too many french fries, and not very good at that--not too hot and not too crispy.  His steak was cooked perfectly, though, and the onion rings were much better than the stringy kind that came with my salmon (I know cuz I stole one when he wasn't looking).   I had to pack up half of my meal...and I noticed many other diners had to do the same.  I still felt like I needed to be rolled out, so even cheesecake ""to go"" was not an option for me.  My husband had a piece of carrot cake cheesecake packed up.  He ate it later that evening and pronounced it delicious. All in all, though, the overall experience was just okay.  About what I would expect from a much closer to my house Max & Erma's, Fridays, or Applebee's, but it seemed more expensive.  I was glad we had the gift card.  I'd eat there again if I were in a group and it was a group decision but probably wouldn't choose it over many other venues."
Sharon P.,"RAYMOND, OH",4,44,,4.0,5/19/2012,"Why didn't you make us feel special tonight??  You usually make us feel special.  It didn't help much that for hubbs and my 23rd wedding anniversary we were sat beside two young couples and their 4 kids, they thought their high-chairs were jungle-gyms and standing on chairs and wreaking havoc on our intimate dinner.  You were cute and all, but I'm not sure how many times you came close to kicking my arm.... your annoyance over-rode any cuteness you had.  Cashew Chicken was wonderful, again.  Hubbs had BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger....which he adores!  Good job!"
Sarah B.,"Marion, OH",42,45,40,3.0,4/4/2013,I usually only come here for the Caesar salad and a few hunks of bread.
Jodi L.,"Delaware, OH",16,58,,5.0,4/1/2013,Always the best food with the best consistent quality.  Cheesecake is always amazing - at times the service quality has declined - but to keep up with such an extensive Menu is always impressive.
Sunee M.,"Columbus, OH",51,25,10,4.0,2/15/2012,"This place has a HUGE selection on their menu.  From burgers, to pasta, to Asian, to salads, to pizza, anything you could really want.  I've always had great service when I go to any cheesecake restaurant.  I also LOVE their large selection of cheesecakes.  I've had several different types, and all of them are so incredibly delicious!!  I highly recommend this place for anyone.  :)"
