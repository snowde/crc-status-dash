Elizabeth B.,"Philadelphia, PA",149,235,14,2.0,1/1/2010,"Made a quick pit stop at Cheesecake Factory to meet a friend for coffee. There are probably better places to do this, but it was in the middle of a snowstorm and it was conveniently located.  Seated quickly in the bar area, we told the waiter we wouldn't be ordering food or alcohol, just a hot chocolate for her and a latte for me. He didn't seem too pleased, but by the end of the night I realized that this was just his demeanor. He didn't crack a smile the entire time, no matter how charming or friendly we were (and we really were).  The drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive. When they did, the waiter said there was a microwave mishap. A microwave? Seriously? This is a real restaurant, serving real food. Microwaves should not involved.  I waited another 10 minutes or so until I could get his attention to ask for sugar and a spoon or stirring device. While we were waiting, a tray of empty glasses flew out of a server's hand and went flying everywhere. It was cleaned up quickly, which was nice, but the floor was so slippery afterward that it was kind of perilous. Come to think of it, it was probably slippery anyway which caused the spill in the first place. The latte was fine ... my friend said her hot choc tasted like Swiss Miss.  I haven't eaten real food at Cheesecake Factory in some time (though I remember it being tasty, about oh .... 8 years ago) but I won't return for coffee, no sir! I have learned my lesson."
Jeremy R.,"Columbus, OH",15,14,2,3.0,6/13/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is a dressed up casual dining resturaunt that boasts great cheesecake. The food is overpriced, and the beer selection is awful. The wine list is ok, but as with any restaurant the markup is rediculous. I only come here when family gives me no choice."
Jeff A.,"Chicago, IL",1164,309,7,4.0,8/7/2009,"I tour the country for my job, my favorite chain of restaurants for group dining is cheesecake factory without a doubt!   I ate at this one last year right after it opened and gain this year just a couple days ago, and the service is on point and the atmosphere is just phenomenal, of-course this is the case at most Cheesecake Factories... I tried a few of the small plates from the new special menu, leave it to Cheesecake factory to make an already great menu even better! I had one of the small plate mushroom pizettes it was just wonderful!  Crisp thin crust, copious amounts of mushrooms, and perfect flavors of herbs and cheese wonderfulness!  I also had the Ahi tuna Tar Tar with avocado salad it was great (It could have had more tuna) the flavor was rich yet delicate the consistency was great and it had these really naughty fresh fries flour tortilla chips to scoop it on, another winner!  I also had a salad that was not on the menu it all it was heavily salted and peppered arugula with raisins and nuts and happiness all about the salt quotient was almost overwhelming and i suspect for many it would have been but I still really liked it!   The table also split some bacon wrapped cheese stuffed dates and they were amazing! HMMMMMMM We also split a piece of Lemon Raspberry cheesecake this is one of my favorites and it is always good! Gosh Darn I love The Cheesecake Factory, I just hope this new small plate menu becomes a permanent addition to all Cheesecake Factories!"
Bee S.,"Cleveland, OH",64,211,98,4.0,8/29/2011,"I ate once at a Cheesecake Factory long ago and was so unimpressed and disgusted at the never ate at one again apart from running in and grabbing a piece of cheesecake to go every now and then. But just recently dined here with 9 coworkers. I really just went to be polite, but ended up having a great time! I was incredibly impressed with our service. The waiter we had was amazing, he was so attentive even with our large party, and he was super polite and checked on us just enough to make sure everything was going well the entire night.  I also like how they now have a ""skinnylicious"" menu, completely separate from the main menu. It takes all of the regular menu items (and a few new items I think) and combine them all in one little separate menu with items ranging in calorie content, but nothing over 600 calories, if I remember correctly. It was really convenient, especially since I've always been wary of their meals after reading all the horror stories about how they notoriously have 1000+ calorie dishes and don't post their nutrition info. And they don't skimp on the portions either, they are just healthier options at the same prices!"
Trish D.,"Columbus, OH",93,26,4,5.0,3/14/2011,I soooo love the Cheesecake Factory I always get the chicken tortillas and banana cheesecake it's so great anytime there's a problem they resolve it quickly... I love Cheesecake Factory!!!
Francesca Q.,"Powell, OH",0,2,,5.0,7/23/2012,"My boyfriend and I decided to come back to the first real date we had for our anniversary. The first time we visited I wasn't stoked on the food, but he loved his dish. This time around we both were in love with our food, our waiter and our cheesecake.  The server was very nice and attentive, even put up with my boyfriend being a bit tipsy and obnoxious."
Mark F.,"Toledo, OH",0,1,2,4.0,4/26/2012,"Very friendly staff, blue cheese BLT burger was very good. Cheesecake heaven!"
Gage D.,"Columbus, OH",0,10,,1.0,2/28/2013,"The name says it all. It is truly a factory and they are making money hand over fist from all the fools that live near Polaris.. We felt like we are in Disney world meaning everything is fake. They take a warehouse fill it with a ton of crap and god the high school kids with their parents credit cards pack the place. It's so loud, the menu is full of cheese ads and the food quality is only a step above you local Applebee's. save your time and money. You will wait an hour or more jammed in the lobby like live stock before a tag team of servers take your order and bring the factory food."
Chelsea M.,"Columbus, OH",0,35,,1.0,1/16/2014,"I had such horrific service and mediocre food tonight that I will NEVER be back here.  I was charged tax and gratuity on a take-out order, so that one meal, one appetizer and 2 pieces of cheesecake totaled more than $60. Ummm...get over yourself, CF.  Your food isn't THAT good.  I honestly would have been happier if I had just gone to McDonald's.  Oh, and they screwed up my order to boot. I won't go into specifics since I could write a freaking novel about what went wrong tonight...but trust me.  Stay away."
Farida A.,"Columbus, OH",4,2,,5.0,11/4/2014,outstanding service and great tasting food with phenominal desserts.we had oreo cookie cheese cake and it was so awesome.right texture with little crunch to it.our entire experince i would rate it definately 5/5
Kara K.,"Columbus, OH",18,277,,3.0,9/26/2011,"My future sister in law was in town & wanted pasta.  We decided on the Cheesecake Factory as she could get pasta & we could get whatever else PLUS my fiance had been dying to taste their latest cheesecake creation. My chicken romano was good as always & she very much enjoyed her fettucini alfredo.  The fiance got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  He said the meatloaf was good, but the mashed potatoes were not so great.  I love mashed potatoes so I stole a bite.  I found them worse than the usual instant mashed potatoes you find at restaurants - dry & hard once they were stuck in their sand-castle mold.  We finished our dinner & on to the real reason we came: cheesecake.   The fiance had been salivating over the new Hershey's cheesecake.  Well, too bad because they were out of it.  They were also out of some soup earlier in the evening.  We mentioned that the Hershey's cheesecake was the reason we came there that evening & our waiter said nothing.  I pointed out that their name is the cheesecake FACTORY - make some more.  Then our waiter had the gall to say the BAKERY (again implying they could produce more cheesecake not run out of it for the evening) was busy & we would have to wait approximately 15 minutes for our cheesecake.  The fiance settled on Godiva & his sister & I shared the tiramasu cheesecake.  I like tiramasu, I like cheesecake, so I thought I would love it.  But it was the first time I have ever not liked a slice from the Cheesecake Factory.  It was dry and boring.  Well we will go back to try the Hershey's cheescake, but will not waste our time or money with eating dinner."
Heather A.,"Columbus, OH",64,340,138,4.0,8/10/2008,The new Polaris location is now open.  We had the opportunity to sample the menu and service before presented to the public and it was great.  The place looks beautiful but no surprises.  They are churning these places out like there is no tomorrow.  I once thought of the CF at Easton as such a treat- a unique place in Columbus to plan your night around but they are becoming so cookie cutter.  Disappointed in that- but not the menu.
loraine s.,"Columbus, OH",0,27,,2.0,7/16/2010,i went there for lunch yesterday. the place is beautiful. I think they overprice. their food is nothing special. service very good though. spend about $60 before tips for lunch of two people. i don't thing i will be back.
