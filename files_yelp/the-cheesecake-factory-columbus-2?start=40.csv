Amy L.,"Sarasota, FL",10,34,12,3.0,8/6/2017,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a long time.  The menu is overwhelming so much stuff to pick from.  I got the stuffed mushrooms they were ok but a bit over cooked, and I order the lemon shrimp ok the light menu the sauce was great I would like liked the tail off on the shrimp it mixes better with the pasta that way. The food came out very quickly not much wait however our server may have had too many tables or something we didn't see her much at all."

Johnny R.,"Columbus, OH",1,113,15,4.0,9/1/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory at Polaris hosted myself and the fetching Mrs. Rat on 5/14/16 for dinner. We arrived at 5:45pm to find the place overrun with Prom goers. While waiting to get to the reservation station, a group in front of us offered their buzzer as they were not going to wait the 90 minutes predicted by the hostess. We passed the buzzer to a party of four. After waiting 8 minutes we were escorted to our table. We ordered iced tea and pot-stickers. They arrived in a timely fashion and the pot-stickers were very good. Our waitress was superb and did not hover around, she gave us plenty of time to peruse the vast menu. The fetching Mrs. Rat ordered steak medallions with grilled spring vegetables. The presentation was pleasing to the eye and the food was tasty to the tongue. I had the steak Diane & salmon combination with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The steak was grilled to perfection. The salmon was a bit more done for my taste. I don't fault the cook though as I should have ordered it medium rare. We both ordered cheesecake and coffee to end the meal. I had traditional with cherry topping. The fetching Mrs. Rat had vanilla bean with strawberries on the side. I see that some reviews say that service was slow. We had no problems whatsoever. As I mentioned earlier, it was prom night so the place was packed. Food was very good, service was great, atmosphere was fine. I think we shall return."
Kaylie H.,"Columbus, OH",0,12,2,2.0,11/26/2016,"The service is good, our server was very friendly, however the food was disappointing. The fried cod was very dry and flavorless even after salt on it. It did not fall apart at all and was not flaky."
Adrianne N.,"Dublin, OH",0,2,,2.0,6/20/2017,"Typically I like Cheesecake Factory, however, I have been to this location twice and will not be going again. Everytime we go they seem to be out on something, today they were out of wheat bread and ice cream. The food was dry...even the potatoes! And the service was not the best. I would rather just find another restaurant next time."
Joe R.,"Columbus, OH",0,13,10,1.0,2/13/2016,"Our first trip tonight, we're excited to try it..  Will be our last.  Start out with being told a 40min to 1 hr wait.  That alone isn't to bad, but they have little room to stand and wait, so we head over to Barnes and noble to kill some time.  20 min later, we are back, standing in the long hallway waiting for our buzzer.  40 minutes of that sardine can joy, an hour since we checked in originally, I check in again.  Lady at the front counter had attitude, said we must have been paged while out of the building.  We took our reprimanding, decided to wait for that next available table.  30 more minutes, this time standing right by the counter, the attitude lady realizes we had been paged again, but it never went off.  This is where it went south.  Only a lip service apology, and we still had to wait, because others who had a similar issue were all trying to get seated at the same time.   Finally get a table, the booth for two is cramped.  Waitress asks how things are going, but shrugs off our complaint.  Decided to avoid us since we were grumpy, our service was subpar, even though we cheered ourselves up and became pleasant to be around. Then the food came out, and it was very average at best.  The crusted parmesan chicken was way to salty, the egg roll appetizer was pretty good, the eggplant Parmesan was very plain and average.  Took nearly 45 minutes to get dinner, and with the slow service we skipped desert .  After all, just going out to dinner on date night took up almost 4 hours.  But at least we had those 20 minutes at Barnes and noble."
Alex C.,"Gahanna, Columbus, OH",16,14,4,4.0,11/15/2016,Came in before noon on a Sunday and we didn't have to wait which was nice. Only complaint was the bread came out slow. Everything else was good. A little expensive for what we got but that's to be expected here.
Asxdxfan 1.,"Pickerington, OH",0,2,,2.0,5/7/2017,The lobby is one of worst set up I have seen for a restaurant this size. Needs more seating. People looking at the cheese cake display are in the way of someone trying to get to the other side
Katherine C.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Very disappointed with visit. This is not our first time. We wer out for our Birthday dinner. There were 3 of us with Birthdays. Out of the five dinners that were ordered, only 2 were correct. We asked to speak with the manager ( Ashton ) and she was very rude. Very disappointed as this was always a group favorite. There are so many choices in the Columbus area and we will not be back."
Harriet W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,4,2,5.0,5/22/2017,"I had the best service ever from this location. Zack the manager was so sweet. I hadn't noticed the time when I got off work and went in. It was 10 minutes to close and so I decided to just say I'm sorry, I'll go elsewhere, (having been a server I remember dreading having guests walking in so close to closing time) well, he welcomed me back, and said it was no trouble, don't worry about it! I refused one more time, and he insisted that it wasn't any trouble and the kitchen won't be mad. I, having not had anything to eat all day, accepted. I ordered, and again, he made sure that I got anything I wanted. I felt that he went above and beyond!! Thank you for putting your guest first!"
Xenia M.,"Plainfield, IL",0,3,,1.0,5/20/2017,I love the food at this place and whenever I have visited this restaurant in IL the service has been commendable but I was disappointed when I went here. We asked for chilled water and the person got us tap water when we asked we were told I got you what I had this is all we have. Really an upscale restaurant can't give its guests cold water. Many will just make an attempt to pour cold water from a pitcher full of ice with minimal ice cubes to make the customer happy. The experience was just bad through out from appetizer to entree I believe the person waiting our table was having a bad day but why take it out on a paying customer.
Amy R.,"Columbus, OH",0,34,,4.0,10/13/2016,Great Cheesecake Factory with the normal great service and food. Never disappointed by this location!
John M.,"Dublin, OH",34,4,1,2.0,9/7/2015,"Went to the Polaris location for my daughters birthday dinner. Disappointing to say the least. Service was marginal. Silverware was dirty. Left a spoon and knife on tables edge for replacement. Server never looked at it. Finally, pointed it out and he did not replace.  Food was OK. Burger was overcooked. Chicken in salad was horrible. Fried shrimp was very good. Worst of all was the dessert. Found a long piece of paper in the cheesecake. Server saw it left on plate and said ""was that in the cheesecake?"" When we answered yes, he said nothing further, shook his head and left. Will not be returning..."
Lori G.,"Dublin, OH",0,15,1,2.0,7/27/2015,"Very disappointing, wont return. Prices were too high for the quality of the food. The cheesecake was the highlight though.  The server was nice but food...no Bueno! Menu is too big to execute at high quality..160+items. I ordered a pasta dish that was priced at $17.95. The shrimp in the pasta were ""bay"" shrimp...very small that are usually used for shrimp salad, some were over cooked. Sent dish back and got meatloaf...tasted ok, not great, but portion size was huge...id rather a smaller portion for less money. Husband ordered a French dip sandwich...usually on a baguette of sorts but came out on a sesame seed bun, like a burger bun, which the menu did not state, and my husband cant eat seeds. Our bill was over $100 and when we left we were very disappointed. Next time we want a nice dinner we'll stick to Bravo and Hyde Park."
Joshua A.,"Lewis Center, OH",0,3,,1.0,8/13/2016,Need to figure out how to maintain seating flow properly.  Been a few times with large parties and have waitied at least 30 minutes beyond predicted wait time.  One time they forgot to tell us our table was ready for 20 minutes and we had already waited 1hr 45mins.
Colie R.,"New York, NY",44,110,219,1.0,5/15/2015,"There's nothing more enjoyable than going to a restaurant where a waitress never comes back and then when your food is finally delivered there is hair cooked into the chicken. Once I was able to find my waitress and alert her of the situation she was only able to mutter ""Sorry"" while not looking in my eye and not offering a solution to the hair being in my food. Completely disgusted. Get your cooks hair nets."
Suzanne F.,"Columbus, OH",73,207,409,3.0,1/12/2016,"Well what can you say about a place that's corporate. It's opulent and nicely decorated. It's roomy and has a nice bar, place to get to go cheesecake and cake slices. Then there's the spacious dining room.  I ordered the fried zucchini with marinara as ordinarily it comes with ranch. I also ordered off their ""Skinnylicious"" menu where items have 600 calories or less. I got the Asian chicken tacos that utilize lettuce as their shell then chicken, bamboo shoots, Asian slaw and chopped peanuts.  It's served with two different sauces that include a peanut sauce and a ginger sauce. I like them both. Alas you can't forget the complimentary sourdough and pumpernickel bread served with butter. My friend ordered the crab bites which are little mini crab cakes and they weren't too bad.  She also got their corn chowder soup. Our waitress was pretty efficient but hard to understand at times as she had a thick accent.  I'd go here again if in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way as it's just usual corporate fare."
Michael G.,"Columbus, OH",38,626,23,3.0,3/12/2015,"Ugh.  I stopped reading the menu on page 10.  The good news, our waiter was well trained and he knew the pages cold.  Really do you need such a huge menu.  Ugh. It was a Saturday lunch and the wait approached an hour.  Where do they come from. I opted for a garden salad.  It was huge and delicious.  Good choice. Of course cheesecake, regular NY style.  Delicious. I'm not sure what i think of CF.  What I had was 4*.  Cheesecake 4*.  Menu 1*.  My server 4*."
Zach A.,"Polaris, Columbus, OH",0,1,,5.0,2/9/2016,"Foods decent, one of the employees, Justin McNeal, makes the place worth going to. You can't beat hard work and dedication, honestly the only reason I would gonback"
Tom P.,"Powell, OH",3,11,2,2.0,10/6/2013,"Okay, you know what you're getting at Cheesecake Factory, right?  It's a chain.  I have no problem with mistakes in business - we all have 'em and the measure of our character is how we respond to them.   So I ordered the Buffalo Burger on Oct 5th for a late lunch while my wife ordered a pizza and salad combo.  The buffalo burger has onion rings on it.  The food was delivered, I took my first bite and couldn't sink my teeth in - something hard was blocking it.  So I pulled out a long strip of hardened onion skin from one of the rings and set that aside.  Things happen I thought - it's just an onion.  Then again and again as each of the four onion rings had a strip of impenetrable onion skin that hadn't been peeled off until I had a small pile of them (see picture). The waiter failed to return to check on me until I was three-fourths done with the burger.  At which time I *finally* got to ask for the ketchup for the fries and pointed out there was a problem with the food.  I said I didn't want to send it back (it was far too late and the rest was okay), but that he really should alert the kitchen that they'd made a mistake.  I even picked up an onion skin strip and demonstrated that you could try to pull it apart but it was very strong and unchewable.  This should have set off alarm bells, but he said something like, ""oh, okay"" and left.  I would've expected a manager to drop by within minutes but that didn't happen, meaning he didn't tell anyone.  Which means that serving bad food wasn't taken seriously.  To be clear, I did not want any sort of comp - no free food or desserts.  I only wanted the business to know about the mistake, take quality seriously and take steps to correct it.  But that did not happen, so we're done with Cheesecake Factory.  I'm going to upload a pic - I think Yelp hooks that to my review."
