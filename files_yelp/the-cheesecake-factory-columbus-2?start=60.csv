Michael N.,"Bowling Green, OH",3,28,13,4.0,3/12/2015,"A quick note here: Eat at the Easton location if you can. Polaris has the worst layout ever. I won't go back again if I can help it. I've always enjoyed this restaurant. This time around was no different. The server was a super friendly & attentive Eastern European woman - best server I've had in a while! I love the bread, but it wasn't as hot & fresh as it should be (on every refill). My dish was very good (spicy cashew chicken). It was well cooked & presented. Could be spicy for your average joe, but I'm a spice freak, so I would've preferred more. My Sam Adams seasonal beer was very crisp & refreshing. For dessert, I got the strawberry cheesecake. It was absolutely to die for. Thick, rich body, fresh strawberries in a sauce, thick & generous whipped cream, & a tasty crust. Overall a good experience. Another note: they don't take reservations on the weekend."
YeeMan W.,"Lewis Center, OH",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2016,"My boyfriend and I went to the Polaris mall Cheesecake Factory for dinner yesterday, after all day of work, just want to have little joy and relax!  Normally I'm very happy with the foods and servers, yesterday we had the waiter name Chris, he is horrible, he Is so rude to us the whole dinner. First, we ordered crabcakes, it came out pretty fast, so we are so happy, because after all day of work, we are hungry, we took the first bite, it tasted good as usual, but this time in the middle of crabcakes still cold, so we return the crabcakes. The manager bring out the new order of crabcakes, and apology to us.  With our reminder, the rude waiter Chris just remember to bring us bread, that's after half and hour later after we been sited, and put in order, and the appetizer already been out and return, plus he didn't give us any plates and he throw the bread to our table and walk away, not even say a word! So we asked other staff to bring us plates, omg, one of the plate are so dirty!  Of course when the manager here, we have to tell him that, the manager explain why the bread took half and hour, because they are out and still in the oven?! Ok, we accept that explanation, at least he tried, he continue about the cold crabcakes and dirty plate, he said shouldn't happened! He took the dirty plate and tell us he will bring a new one, oh well, he didn't.  In some way, the manager is professional, we give the manger some credit, so we didn't tip badly to that rude waiter ""Chris"" I don't know you are racist or you have bad experience about Asain tipper, because I don't see you have a bad day, you handle the table across to us very well, just because they are your people? Then you should tell your company to put up a sign, no other races allowed in our restaurant but white. That's all I can think of you are being racist, because you showing me your attitude between us to the other table! But I really don't need to come to the restaurant to see such thing, you can keep it at home! What a trash!"
Nathan K.,"Columbus, OH",8,39,1,3.0,11/5/2014,"Let's get straight to the point...the Cheesecake is the best part about this place.  Don't be fooled by the ambiance, the decor, or the biblical sized menu, -- side note: I've never understood restaurants with 15 page menus. How can you boast having good food when you have to be able to cook that many items. I'd rather sacrifice quantity for a little quality. -- because all that really matters is the cheesecake.  My recommendation: order the cheesecake first and your entrée second. You don't want to fill up on bread and food and then miss the best part.  Personal favorite, the raspberry and lemon cheesecake. Light, tangy, fruity, and smooth."
Bryant M.,"Columbus, OH",3514,819,1243,3.0,10/17/2014,"***3.5 stars*** It's not local... I know I shouldn't be here... I'm full of shame... BLAH BLAH BLAH.  I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in at least 6 years. It's not that I hate it; it's just not really my thing. Big portions, big chain, big prices, etc.  Well tonight I was at Polaris mall getting a massage at Comfort Zone (trust me--don't judge), and the Mister and I needed dinner. He wanted pasta, and since I have this wheat thing, he rarely gets it.  It dawned on me that CF probably had a gluten-free menu, so I gave them a quick call--and they did! I placed our order, and then they told me I could PARK OUTSIDE AND THEY WOULD BRING MY FOOD.  What?! Maybe I'm just easily amused, but the Cheesecake Factory impressed me tonight with their GF menu and the way they let me be lazy.  As for the food, it's your typical CF fare. Everything was good. Not amazing, but still tasty. I definitely don't think I'll wait another 6 years before heading back!"
Jackie A.,"Columbus, OH",0,33,,4.0,9/7/2016,"My spouse and I had lunch today at The Cheesecake Factory at Polaris and had a wonderful, delicious meal. I had the lunch fish and chips and she the Asian lettuce wraps, both produced empty plates and full stomachs. Almost too full to order a slice of Turtle Pecan Cheesecake, but why come to this place and not get cheesecake!  We devoured it, a food of the Gods. Service was great, the only issue 38.00 for lunch. Lucky for us we had a gift card. An overall great experience"
Trina T.,"Whitehall, Columbus, OH",531,78,61,1.0,10/4/2015,I've been here quite a few times even when it was extremely busy but today I was very disappointed today. I went in with my parents around 4 pm an it wasn't even crowded. The hostess asked how many and my mom said three and she said it would be a few minutes. I was extremely pissed off when there were other people that got seated and even a party of nine that just walked in got seated before us. The restaurant wasn't full at all. I asked to be seated and I was told that it would be another few minutes. Those extra few minutes turned out to be a full wasted 15 minutes. I hope that the manager reads this because I was highly displeased. I won't be coming back to this location because of this experience
Sara S.,"Cincinnati, OH",42,254,47,4.0,10/22/2014,"The food is good, and the service is excellent. I prefer this location to the one near my home (Cincinnati)."
Caroline C.,"Powell, OH",0,23,26,5.0,8/14/2016,"Every time I've been here the food has been amazing and the service has been great. No place I would go for cheesecake other than the Cheesecake Factory. I always get the four cheese pasta, never disappoints. You can't go wrong with the smores, Oreo or anniversary cheesecake."
Bryan H.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,57,1,3.0,7/15/2014,"The cheesecake and desserts far outweigh the blandness of their menu.  The dinner menu tries to be something for everyone, and doing so they fail to do anything spectacular. The burgers aren't great, just ok. The pasta isn't spectacular,  just ok. When your menu is thicker than a 3 subject notebook,  you're trying to be all things to all people.  The service at this location is train going up a hill slow. FYI. I am not from Columbus so I probably won't be back here, but it kind of turned me off from trying the one where I live."
Paul T.,"Columbus, OH",34,45,62,1.0,9/6/2015,Had really bad service & food today. I felt like only this location (Polaris) though. The one in Easton is constantly good never had a problem. Polaris location is unorganized & you have to get on their case before you get service. I don't like to input  bad reviews but if it gets really bad I have to. Not coming back to this (Polaris) location.
Cathi H.,"Delaware, OH",2,17,,1.0,5/10/2015,"3rd attempt at the Polaris location last night .We had a party of 5 and luckily found 2spots at the bar to wait. The bartender( I did not catch his name because I'm not sure he could speak) was rude and completely ignored us. The other bartender had to stop what she was doing to wait on us. our waitress was pleasant but could hardly hear us. The accustics in that building are awful!  I ordered a chop salad. Chopped is right! It was chopped so fine I couldn't tell what was in it. My husband got a filet. It was cooked perfectly but a 30 dollar steak, you would think it would have come with a side? nope, just a hunk of meat on a plate! We spent $100. 3rd time NOT a charm. Won't go back....OK maybe for cheesecake."
Melanie Y.,"Columbus, OH",0,18,7,1.0,7/19/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite places to go for birthday celebrations.  I was excited when I called and was able to do call ahead seating.  We arrived on time and were seated.  This is where our experience went downhill.  Our food took nearly 40 minutes and the restaurant was not overly busy.  Our waitress provided the worst service I have experienced in 10+ years.  When our food arrived our kids grilled cheese was so black our kids would not eat it.  Our kids meatball was over cooked and dry.  The kids cheeseburger was lacking cheese.  Upon receiving our food our waitress never checked on us.  We had to stop her for cheese (for the burger), refills (which we never received), and the bill (which was not on 2 checks as requested).  The two adult meals were fine.   We celebrated a child's birthday and that took another 20+ minutes which we we're ready to walk out the door when they finally brought the desserts.  We have had good experiences at the Polaris location prior to today.  If this waitress was a trainee then she still needed her trainer for support.  Very disappointing birthday dinner."
Xingqun Y.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,1.0,7/16/2016,If you are not american you should not come his location. Service is bad and the manager try to excuse. Not they fault. When the crab cake come the bread haven't be serviced. And the crab cake is cold. So we ask the service change new one. And he toke back with plate too. And wait for another 10 mins still not ready and we so hungry so I ask the service can we have some bread first. And he go get bread and didn't bring us new plate and don't explain why the bread take so long. And late the manager bring out new crab cake and apologize to us about first was cold. And I ask can I have plate please and why the bread take so long and he said cause it's new. And I said In this case you should let your customer know about it. And he forgot our plate so I have to ask the host to get us plate. And one of the plate is dirty.  what the shame. And when the service give our check didn't said anything just  drop and left. Wtf the service name is Christ
Keith B.,"Powell, OH",332,516,72,2.0,8/17/2012,"I didn't like this place, at all. Came here with a coworker for lunch, met our server in five minutes, was served our drinks 30 minutes later, our lunch 30 minutes after that. Normally, two people can do lunch at nearly every place in Polaris in an hour or less. Larger groups? Yeah, maybe a little longer. here? Two people. No crazy requests. Ordered from the lunch menu, and it took over 90 minutes. The food was meh, but filling (I had the blackened chicken sandwich). Plain and simple, I'll be skipping it for lunch from now on."
James C.,"Cincinnati, OH",149,462,95,4.0,8/3/2015,Was very impressed with the brunch. The mimosas were flowing and the Huevos Rancheros was delicious. Black beans and melted cheese made this breakfast experience perfect. Would defiantly recommend this brunch to anyone looking for a quick b fast fix!
Paul F.,"Columbus, OH",175,927,2263,4.0,1/18/2014,"What I don't understand is why all these people who profess disdain for this place, why don't they go elsewhere???  I came up to get a couple of pieces of chesecake, which I did, and if I hated it as much as some of the HATERS do, there are a lot of other restaurants the would be glad to take my money.   If I had to pick a nit, it's that the Cheesecake Factory is a tad to expensive for my wallet.  So I restrict those trips until I really need a piece and then I buy TWO of them.  That'll hold me until the next time the craving hits."
Ashley R.,"Marion, OH",4,54,29,5.0,7/10/2015,My fiance and I absolutely love ordering from the cheesecake factory. We decided to order to gobinstead of dining in. We both wanted to order the factory combos. I got the chicken Madeira and shrimp scampi. It was delicous. I love their shrimp scampi. My fiance got the steak diane and herb crusted salmon. He absolutely loved it. I tried a bite of his plate... I was a bit jealous of his salmon. It was amazing!! Let me tell you if you come here the food will be good and they have not once messed up our orders. Also if you really like cheesecake this is the place to go. I have not tried many flavors. But i know they have the best cheesecake in town. My personsal favorite is the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake. It is so good!!
Crystal G.,"Perrysburg, OH",0,16,,5.0,9/13/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory- Polaris is fantastic. I mean, if you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory yet, run as fast as you can to get to one! The menu itself is like a novel, its the largest menu I've ever seen. I always have to get the mac and cheese bites as an appetizer because they come perfectly made and the sauce they are served on is impeccable! I think it's important to note also that I DO NOT LIKE CHEESECAKE! How crazy is that?! BUT they have the BEST carrot cake I've ever had. Sometimes I call the take out line and have them bring me out a slice of their to die for carrot cake to the curb side parking. I mean, don't judge. It's just THAT good."
Loren G.,"Lewis Center, OH",0,6,,1.0,5/8/2016,"Loud restaurant with mediocre food & slow service. Maybe if the waiters didn't have to spend so much time running back & forth to the kitchen to fetch takeout boxes because of the large (yet over-priced) entrees they could focus on giving faster service. If it weren't for the cheesecake..the slices have gotten smaller, by the way..there wouldn't be anything special about the place. Don't care to go back."
Linda C.,"Delaware, OH",9,14,7,1.0,4/6/2016,We tried to book my daughter's bachelorette dinner here but was told they couldn't accommodate us. They told us that we were welcome to come in and out out names...all 20 .....on the list and they'd be glad to accommodate us. It would take about 2 hours. They said they were quite busy and this would accept their sales. Don't worry! We wouldn't want to affect their sales....they just lost a guaranteed party of 20'
