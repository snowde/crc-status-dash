Sarah P.,"Columbus, OH",60,313,11,5.0,4/7/2014,"Their food is absolutely wonderful.  They give HUGE portions, so you can usually get 3 meals out of 1.  Their cheesecake is also remarkable.  The lemon raspberry creme is super light and fluffy.  The red velvet is wonderful as well.  I would give them 100 stars if I could.  This is a favorite of my whole family. My family from out of town come to Columbus to specifically eat here it's so good."
Alexandra J.,"Columbus, OH",7,10,1,3.0,9/16/2013,"I'll give my review as I'm sitting (for 10 minutes now) for my check.  I came here with my GF for lunch while out running errands. I wish we would've went elsewhere, but she seemed to enjoy herself.  I'll run though my complaints fairly quickly - the decor is gross, the wait was way too long for the place to be this empty, and the food was so-so.  We started off with the fried cheese and it was nothing to brag about. The sauce was too sweet and the outside was burnt. For our lunches, I ordered the herb encrusted salmon and the GF ordered the gumbo. As stated, my food was so-so, the highlight being the mashed potatoes. The portion sizes were alright.  Now my major complaint is how absolutely long it took for this entire process. Our waitress seemed so impatient, yet took forever once we placed an order or asked for something. Cool the attitude, missy, I'll be sure to not return and assist in your Monday blues."
Yetunde O.,"Hilliard, OH",0,8,,1.0,1/17/2016,I was very disappointed by the manager's way of handling a mix up with my meal. They did not bring out the correct order until our table was done eating. The manager basically told me they gave me more shrimp than I should have gotten and a lame apology. I think I will spend my money somewhere else next time.on the other hand our server was nice.
Andy D.,"Cincinnati, OH",43,57,4,2.0,1/5/2015,"Located in Polaris mall's dining sector, this cheesecake factory has ample seating both indoor and outdoor.  Parking is shared with nearby Barnes and Noble and it is usually easy to find a spot.  Food is typical of other cheesecake factories with a GINORMOUS menu, and the cheesecake selection and larger than life portions do not disappoint a hungry diner.  Service here is not the best, as waiters and waitresses seem disinterested and forget requests easily.  For example we were seated outside during a hot day and did not receive waters until we asked for it."
K M.,"Columbus, OH",71,24,11,5.0,4/19/2016,"As long as you don't mind waiting an hour to get a seat, Cheesecake Factory is always a win! The food is amazing, the portions are ridiculous, and the service has always been stellar. Even though they are always slammed, they always seem to have enough staff to accommodate the mad rush. Oh, and the avocado rolls are a must have!"
R K.,"London, OH",1,74,35,2.0,11/17/2013,"One star food, three star decor. The bang bang chicken and shrimp used to be pretty good, but everything had been cheapened here aside from the cheesecake. The quality of the entire chain really has declined."
John O.,"Vallejo, CA",0,14,,2.0,9/3/2016,"Went here last night with my wife.  The issue was sub par service and poor execution.  They were out of orange bitters for the whiskey smash which i understand you run out of ingredients from time to time, but the gentlemen told me its probably just as good as it is with them...if thats the case why have them in There in the first place.  I changed my drink to another one off the whiskey section which was rather good.  We each had a salad, I had a caesar which the dressing had 0 flavor and my wofes side salad had A similar issue.  I always order the hibachi steak with the wasabi mash.  Unfortunately there was NO wasabi in the mash and there was something off with the taste of the steak so i only ate a couple pieces.  The mash potatoes were good, just not what i wanted (note:  I will almost never send food back to a kitchen as Ive heard too many horror stories, which is why I didnt mention it).  My wife ordered the southwest chicken sandwich which she loved and took home the leftovers.  Most engaged waiters would notice that someone ate half of their meal and question why they don't want to take it home especially when part of the party takes theirs and the other doesnt, but ours had no questions.  Maybe my expectations are too high, but I think cheesecake factory is going the way of all corporate restaurants when they get too big, they struggle to maintain product quality and service."
Luke M.,"Columbus, OH",0,7,,2.0,12/11/2014,Just got through having lunch with family and am purty disappointed. The food was okay but service wasn't great. First they took a long time to get food out then finally they told us that they had over cooked my brothers food and it would be a while longer.  When his food arrived the manager came and said that he was disappointed how the mashed potatoes looked so he sent them back and that they would be coming soon. After all this they overcharged our bill and we had to wait to have it fixed. They did comp my brother a piece of cheesecake for his wait that why they get 2 stars
Jen Y.,"Columbus, OH",131,13,6,1.0,12/30/2015,"I usually don't get disappointed when coming to a Cheesecake Factory, but this experience was just awful. It was a Tuesday night and was a little bit busier than we expected so we decided to sit at the bar. Once we did, it took 20 minutes before someone asked us what we wanted to drink. Then it took another 15 minutes to get a mojito and two water. Then it took another 30 minutes for someone to come and take our order. Service was just horrible. And the food was just the same. Clearly it was let out too long, I got the steak medallions and they were all top charred. My vegetables were charred, wilted, and tiny. I am a stickler for good service, and this place just not have it. Won't be visiting this location ever again."
Tom T.,"Indian Land, SC",18,9,3,1.0,11/16/2014,"Love Cheesecake Factory but Brunch today was awful.  Cold food, incomplete order, so so service.  Columbus likes to brag about being a restaurant market, it's a shame it's not known as an good operations market"
Anna Z.,"Westerville, OH",0,4,,1.0,11/23/2014,"The past recent visit at the Cheesecake Factory was a very unpleasant experience. I was there with my brother and sisters, we were seated there on a Thursday night so it wasn't busy. We sat for about 10 mins till we had to get up and look for a server to get our drinks. Me and my sisters ordered strawberry lemonades when they arrived we all took a sip, they all tasted like a rubber hose. we asked for a replacement of sprite and asked for it to not be from the bar. I then ordered a margarita pizza. It looked and tasted like it was frozen food that they just warmed up. My brother ordered the cashew chicken, let's just say they can't do chinese food, we'll stick to Molly Woo's. We defeniatly won't be returning."
Josh K.,"Mount Vernon, OH",5,131,20,3.0,1/9/2016,I am not a fan of chain restaurants. This place is average. I would really give it 2.5 stars.  The bang bang chicken is a good dish. Not being a fan of cheesecake may have something to do with my rating.  Service is generally very good.
Shea H.,"Vernon, CT",93,252,972,1.0,1/20/2013,"We just stopped here for a little birthday dessert.  Unfortunately, it was unnecessarily sweet; and let me tell you, I love sweets but these cheesecake slices just screamed manufactured.  I, surprisingly, had never had cheesecake from TCF.  In my world of trying to eat well, TCF seems to be one of the worse offenders because of calories and excessive use of salt and sugar.  My experience confirms all that I've heard and I think we all can do better, people.  Seriously-- the taste is not worth it.  If it was yummy, I would totally sacrifice health for occasional treat but it's not."
Chen L.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,4.0,11/16/2014,"It was a great places for me and my friends to have meal, the steak was nice. I would absolutely come here and try some food else."
Yi S.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,4.0,11/18/2013,"I think the food there is really delicious and the Pumpkin cheesecake is awesome! I really enjoyed the meal with my friends there. However, because it was weekend and many people were waiting there, my friends and I waited about half an hour. Chinese people are anxious about waiting for such a long time. And the food is too much and most of us had to waste it.  But I still want to say it is worth to waiting. The food there is yummy flavor and the cheesecake is unbelievable. Moreover, the waiters of The Cheesecake Factory were really nice and hospitable. Although we have looked for the menu for a long time, they still showed great patience to us. They gave us some good recommendations as well."
Adam K.,"Dublin, OH",161,219,33,4.0,4/23/2013,"Sometimes we come here for food.  Sometimes after we've eaten somewhere else, just to get dessert.  Lately, it's been more of the latter. The food is just ""too much.""  It's good, don't get me wrong, but like Champp's on steroids.  The portions are made for Biggest Loser dropouts and the prices are a little high for what you get.  This is one of those places that seems to justify its high prices on the ambiance and portion sizes, neither of which the consumer can control... or can we??   Okay, so you can't re-paint the ceiling at Cheesecake, but why would you?  It's beautiful.  However, if you can get your date or someone in your party to decide on a dish to share, this is the way to go.  Chances are, you'll eat your 1/2 and still feel like a fata$$ anyway.   I'm not into fancy desserts - in fact, I'm not much of a sweets person, so I typically don't eat the cheesecake, but when I do (a la Dos Equis), I just get a plain one.  Typically, I just get drinks, though... they have great cocktails."
Nick S.,"Cincinnati, OH",30,50,9,4.0,10/20/2014,"I had a luau salad (lunch size), and it was gigantic.  The salad tastes great, and the display was pretty neat too. I finished my meal with a huge slice of Snicker's cheesecake (excellent)! The service was good, so I will definitely be back when I am in the area again."
Casey S.,"Columbus, OH",39,69,6,5.0,3/2/2013,"The place was packed tonight and I was told it would be an hour wait so we ventured next door to Barnes and Noble with the pager they gave us. I was also told that the pager would not work in Barnes and Noble and that I should return before the hour so we don't lose our spot.  So we arrived at Barnes and Noble and decide to buy some chai tea and coffee from Starbucks and low and behold our pager goes off. I had to power walk in five inch heels and throw away my chai tea. I was a little irritated that the employee kind of lied to us but also happy that the wait was far less than an hour. The waitress was very attentive and always kept our beverages full at all times. We had ordered calamari and it was overly greasy and the breading kept coming off which exposed the rubbery concoction. I don't like knowing what calamari looks like without its clothes on. On the upper hand, I ordered the filet mignon and of course it was it was amazing. I love the way filet mignon just almost melts in your mouth. The fries that accompanied my steak were far less impressive and had two random onion rings with them. (I loathe onions). By the end of all that my stomach was pushing for a food baby so I got my cheesecake to go. Dulce de leche was my poison of choice. I still have yet to eat my cheesecake, it's sitting in the fridge haunting me but I know it will be a delight."
Shelley T.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,4.0,10/25/2014,I went there with my friends after shopping and we were super hungry. The restaurant seemed nice.  I got a fish taco and it was okay. The rice tastes funny but I like the taco. The salads my friends got were so big! Then we shared a cheesecake.  It was so good that we finished it in a second!
Ryan D.,"Cleveland, OH",45,10,,2.0,6/16/2014,Let me say first and foremost I love the Cheesecake Factory however this particular location is an epic fail.  If you want a good Cheesecake Factory experience to go the Easton location. It seems as if the kitchen at the Polaris location I'd always messing up something and please change your cooking oil more often.
