Jayme H.,"Columbus, OH",1236,128,374,4.0,1/10/2018,"Whenever I think of The Cheesecake Factory I picture Oprah Winfrey singing lyrics to Drake's song Childplay (""This is a place for families that drive Camries and go to Disney"") while slicing pieces of cheesecake for her guests. I have no clue why I picture this in my head, but it does sorta set a stage for what I expect when I plan to visit. It's a very family friendly establishment, it can be rather lavish, and it's pretty much what folks are deeming ""basic"" these days.  Now basic isn't necessarily a bad thing. To me is just means, common or popular.  This specific location of The Cheesecake Factory is right in the middle of Easton shopping center. This means there's a lot of parking surrounding it but depends on the time of year, day, etc. you may have to walk a bit. When you're walking in to give your name to the host, you'll notice a great patio! I always choose to sit outside if the weather is nice. This spot also has a good sized bar and an enormous dining area. It honestly feels never ending. This is a good thing considering how busy this location is. It always seems like there's a line out the door however I never seem to have to wait very long before I'm being taken back to a table.  I feel like the last several times I've visited I've gotten the same waitress. She is a total sweetheart and has definitely been working there for a while. She's always quick to greet the table, take drink orders, bring out bread, and she regularly checks in to make sure everything is going well. Speaking of bread, I love that they always bring out warm, freshly baked bread. Usually sourdough and honey wheat, both fantastic, especially when you're starving! I don't have a go-to menu item when I visit. I tend to try something new each time. I can confidently say that the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad is delicious! Big thumbs up! It comes tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and it's very refreshing! I also enjoy the Greek salad on the small plate menu, the avocado eggrolls on the appetizer menu, and the pastas are tasty and filling (the portions feel huge). Now, when it comes to down the actual cheesecake, I could go on and on forever. Every single one I've had has been amazing. The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is absolutely heavenly. I take a bite and it's pretty close to an outta body experience - no lie. The white chocolate macadamia nut is also a top choice. I love the crunch of the nuts. It gives it some much-needed texture.  Overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is the food and the service has always been pretty good here. Its consistent and consistent is nice and comforting. It's why people visit the same restaurants over and over again. That's likely why I keep coming back to The Cheesecake Factory when I'm hungry and it's near by. While the majority of the time I dine out, I go local, I can make an exception to that rule every now and then."
Heather S.,"Columbus, OH",49,191,59,4.0,12/28/2017,"I've always been a fan and probably always will be. I hate waiting to be seated at restaurants and this one is one of the worst. It's so hard to get into 75% of the time.  Their menu is massive. Like ginormous. I've tried several things on the menu, but my go to is always the pasta davinci. The portions are rather large and a to go box is usually necessary. Their appetizers are all good too. Most recently tried the Nashville hot chicken bites and enjoyed those.  I love that ordering dessert here is the norm and is expected. I don't feel like others are judging me as much for being a pig at this restaurant. Sometimes my hubs and l will get a piece of cheesecake for the table and a piece to go for the next day. Everything I've had here has been solid and the service is always okay. Nothing exceptional, but not bad."
Tom H.,"Westerville, OH",118,301,1990,3.0,11/21/2017,"Were you thinking about indulging in a slice of cheesecake while in the area? We were. Just carryout 2 slices. This does not reflect the full menu or dining room. It's the visual mecca of cheesecakes. Bright lighted cases to showcase their delights. A bustling of staff behind the counter, as well as staff from the dining room. They also come to this same area to fill their tables orders for dessert. If I was at a table, I would appreciate my servers aggressive nature of getting my order filled promptly. As a customer who is browsing the case, and ordering, I did not. The personal contact jostling unnecessarily. The loud verbose banter amongst staff about guests. Distracting the cashier taking our order. All things that should be worked on by the front of the house manger. Opening them up at home a short time later, My wife's first comment was, ""Why is yours bigger"". The answer to always remember is ""DIMENSIONS"". CF has their very own cheesecake carryout container. Slices may not be wider or taller than the container.  Her cheesecake was shorter because it was adorned with pretty decorations of treats. The taller the chimney, the lower the roof. This is not the very best cheesecake around. It's as good as most, and is top of the ladder in variety. I have found a food truck that somehow manages to make theirs so smooth and creamy, with a delicate firmness. Toppings vary by day, or specific to custom orders. Now I am forbidden to share the name here, but know that they have the best Sweet Cheese. I'm quite sure many comment on the price. $8/slice Nov 2017 is steep. Especially for average. If you think my review is not accurate, than I am ecstatic that you love your cheesecake experience.  Keep in mind that you can only hold a review to the standards you have experienced, not expected."
Liz A.,"Columbus, OH",52,41,24,5.0,11/11/2017,"Crazy busy place - but it was an AMAZING meal!  We thought going at 5 pm would beat the crowd - but we were wrong.  Not sure if there were lots out for dinner before a movie or eating after early holiday shopping - or perhaps off school/work for Veterans Day (on a Friday).  Regardless, we think they said it would be a 10 minute wait - and it was eleven.  Not bad, but lobby was crowded as it was SO COLD out that night. We got a nice 2-seater table away for any window - good so we could warm up.  Our waitress was super nice and attentive.  Overall, they did a good job keeping our drinks filled (we got a different waitress half way through our time there - weird.)   Hubby ordered the chicken chipotle pasta dish.  He had ordered it before and remembered it being good.  This meal lived up to his recollection and was very good (EMPTY PLATER). I ordered the Skinnylicious chopped chicken salad dish - dressing on the side.  I think I got what I ordered (no dressing - ever.  but it was fine without).  I question whether it was actually a Skinnylicious under 590 calorie dish as it was SO GOOD.  There was plenty of flavorful bacon and crumbled bleu cheese, as well as chicken, avocado and corn.  It was a huge serving.  I just have trouble believing it was Skinnylicious.  Regardless, I ate EVERY SINGLE BITE OF IT!  I posted a photo - check it out.  You can see al the cheese and the pile of shredded greens. The only very  minor complaint (although it's more of a strong comment) - was the food seemed to take a while to come out.  Granted we had fresh bread to snack on - so we weren't dying of hunger.  Also, we really weren't in a hurry to go back out in the cold to trek back to the garage for our car. I have to remember how much I love the salad so we return more often."
April S.,"Westerville, OH",200,189,655,3.0,11/10/2017,"I haven't been here in probably 10 years. Located in the heart of Easton Towne Center. Parking at parking lots located on both sides or street parking with meters. Casual ambience. Warning.. it's very dark in the restaurant. Guess it's supposed to help create the mood but i wear super thick glasses and it made me feel blind. They give you bread before the meal, i would have thought it would come out warm but it didnt. Was very hard to spread the butter. I did appreciate the honey wheat bread though. Food didnt take too long. Our waiter was good and gave us a wide range of selections of his preferences. I ordered a chicken dish that was breaded chicken in a lemon sauce with sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus..the chicken was really good. The dish was only $17ish and it was so much food, made it into two meals...lunch for the next day.  The menu has a wide variety from seafood, to chicken, to pastas, to steaks and sandwiches. They also offer a skinny meal with a pretty good selection with minimized calories. Looking forward to a return visit to try something else. Not sure why it's taken me 10 years to return!"
Blaire W.,"Columbus, OH",11,13,16,3.0,11/4/2017,"I've been to this location a few times before for lunch and dinner. This time I went for brunch with 4 other people. We all got something different and I got the eggs Benedict with the potatoes and a side of fruit. Pretty standard.  We ordered coffee and I also asked for a water. I didn't get the water until I asked 2 more times toward the end of the meal. I had to ask twice for sweetener. This was frustrating because it took our server a long time to come back.  My food arrived before everyone else's by several minutes. Each persons dish arrived a few minutes after the next, except the breakfast combo. That came about 5 minutes after the 4th meal arrived. A waffle, two scrambled eggs and bacon was the last to arrive. At least it was hot when it came. So if you plan to eat together, good luck because not everyone will get their food together.  My meal was pretty good. Still warm by the time we all had our food. It was pretty standard Benedict. Nothing to write home about.  One friend got the eggs, toast and bacon and they forgot the bacon. The friend with the waffle had to send it back because it was borderline over cooked. Another friend got the brioche breakfast sandwich and the last friend got the monte cristo. Both sandwiches looked sloppy and haphazard. The monte cristo was not a typical monte cristo, not what you normally would think of and she wasn't pleased with it.  $3.25 for standard drip coffee and a breakfast I can get at the corner spot in a suburb would have been better. You're definitely paying for the name when you come here. I prefer Cheesecake Factory for dinner."
Randy G.,"Alto, MI",10,106,30,4.0,8/7/2017,Try the Jamaican shrimp I always like Caribbean food and they did a nice job with it. I'm not a big fan of national chains like this but always enjoy the food if it's prepared to the quality that they execute. Service was also very good and we barely had to wait for anything.  At the end of the meal our table ordered three pieces of Cheesecake to try out which was the best. The red velvet won for our table against the tiramasu and some other chocolatey chocolate cake.  I'd recommend the place if your in a bind for a food place to try.
Scott H.,"Groveport, OH",2,6,,5.0,12/11/2017,"This place rocks in being able to eat very well (healthy) and the environment is great!  If cheesecake is your gig then you have a ton of choices!   We split a huge salad , an appetizer, and fillet mignon!    Totally great!   Wait staff is amazing!   Will definitely go back."
Kevin C.,"Columbus, OH",1389,247,1105,5.0,10/12/2016,"Stopped in Sunday afternoon about 1:00.  This place is busy!  We put our name down and waited about 30 min for our pager to buzz.  We were seated and promptly attended to.  Our drink order was taken and some time was given to review the 30 page menu.  The menu is overwhelming but if you break it down and go directly for the pages that are of interest then you only have about 2-4 pages to look at.  It's even easier if you decided between dinner or sandwiches.  We chose sandwiches, and the sandwiches that we chose were delicious.  We have eaten here before and had items off the dinner menu.   The Cheesecake Factory is pretty expensive but the quality of the meal is worth the price that you pay. The sandwiches are around $14 and the meals are around $20.   Our server was fun and attentive. He brought out our drinks and fresh bread. We placed our order, and our sandwiches were brought out in a good amount of time.   Our service was great, and the food was fabulous.  We shared a  1/2 sandwich with each other so we could try them both out, but we only ended up eating  1/2 of our own sandwich as we were full.  We both enjoyed our sandwiches and French fries and mentioned how tasty and fresh the ingredients were and the crispiness of the French fries.   We did not order any dessert this time but have in the past.  The cheesecake is fantastic and I highly recommend ordering a piece.    Order:   CUBAN SANDWICH $13.95 Slow Roasted Pork, Ham, Swiss cheese, Pickles, Mustard and Mayonnaise on a Grilled and Pressed Roll. Served with French Fries or Green Salad.   CHICKEN PARMESAN SANDWICH $13.95 Tender Chicken Lightly Coated in Parmesan Breadcrumbs, Roasted Peppers, Tomato Sauce and Melted Cheese on a Freshly Grilled French Roll. Served with French Fries or Green Salad."
Joe C.,"Mount Vernon, OH",0,24,18,3.0,1/5/2018,I'll keep this short the food was fresh tasted like it been made very recently it was even pretty good the wife's was very bland and we had about a half hour 45 minute wait to get in. Meh it was okay
Heather R.,"New Albany, OH",59,18,5,4.0,12/18/2017,"The food and drinks are are always on point. However, be prepared to wait for about an hour or more on the weekends. The Asian pear martini is really good but a bit on the sweet side. We also got a few apps like the fried Mac and cheese, avocado egg rolls, and the buffalo blasts. All delicious!"
Corey N.,"Bluefield, VA",5,10,10,4.0,5/17/2017,Had very good service on this trip. My wife had meat loaf and I had the fresh grilled salmon. My wife liked her meat loaf and my salmon was good as well but not amazing.  Salmon needed some additional seasoning in my opinion. The wife and I also got some cheesecake slices. I got the original and she had the tuxedo. Both of these were excellent.
Iesha P.,"Columbus, OH",1,15,,3.0,10/26/2017,"We frequent this Cheesecake location often since we live close. EVERY experience, our waiter comes back and tells us they are out of something (chicken and biscuits...stuffed chicken tortillas). It never fails. We are actually moving soon so we're excited to try a different location."
Melanie Y.,"Columbus, OH",0,18,7,3.0,7/15/2017,"We love The Cheesecake Factory and it's our go-to  place with our kids.  The menu is vast and servings are large.  This past visit we went on a rainy Saturday night.  Wait was typical to be seated. Our wit for bread was 40 minutes.  With 4 very hungry kids that was ridiculous.  Our server said he would bring it in 2-3 minutes after ordering.  I finally went by the kitchen to ask for crackers and the server said they didn't have crackers, but she would get me some bread!  So very frustrating for something patrons expect quickly at this restaurant.   The restaurant has great food and amazing cheesecake but I don't recommend going at busy times."
Mark K.,"Columbus, OH",182,1929,1240,3.0,10/26/2016,"Now, come on, I know I've reviewed this.  We go here every few months.  It's another of Sweetie's favorites that I am glad to go to, but not at the top of my list. Huge, always busy, always loud.  But, good food, huge slices of an endless variety of cheesecakes, and good service.  This time we just stopped in for cheesecake.  So busy that literally getting us two slices took 10 minutes.  Rich, huge slices, in pretty much any flavor you can think of. When we come for dinner, Sweetie usually gets a steak and salmon combo, and loves it.  I get something spicy- shrimp, jambalaya, etc.  Always good, and plenty for leftovers.  It is expensive, but the quality and quantity make that worth it.  We'll see how things go with a baby for dining in sometime soon.   Try to come at off hours (still busy, just not crazy.)  Prepare to wait, regardless.  Pick something from the huge menu.  And have some cheesecake, to go."
Carolyn T.,"Groveport, OH",4,14,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Yesterday we made the poor decision to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. We were with extended family so neither my husband nor I spoke up about the quality of our food. I ordered Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs.  By the time I got my order the food was cold. The tortilla chips were soggy. It was very unappetizing. My husband ordered the Brunch Combo which is eggs, bacon, and pancakes. He told me his food was cold, as well. I realize that some of the fault lies with us for not speaking up. I did not want to embarrass the others in our party by saying anything. One may be assured I doubt my husband or I will go back."
Michele W.,"Columbus, OH",2,73,,2.0,4/1/2017,"Caveat - I've been to the Cheesecake Factory twice before many years ago when I lived in a different state.  Was not impressed AT ALL then.  Because of that I never go there.  The only reason why I went there recently is because I wanted a salad for lunch & I was trying to find places around where I work that had good salads.  A friend suggested the Cheesecake Factory, as large as their menu is, I knew they would probably have a salad that I may like. Ordered the anti-oxidant salad, here is the description:  A Delicious Blend of Salad Greens, Spinach, Kale, Avocado, Broccoli, Grapes, Roasted Pear, Blueberries, Onion, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds with Lemon-Blueberry Vinaigrette. Sounds appetizing right???  NOT.  This was basically a blend of salad greens.  I requested no avocado or almonds.  There were NO blueberries at all.  There were all of 8 grapes cut in half, the roasted pear was diced so tiny that as I was eating I remembered it was supposed to have pear and I had to dig for these miniscule pieces that basically added no flavor to all that kale and spinach.  There was also no broccoli in the salad!  The ONLY good thing was the dressing.  If I'd wanted a kale & spinach salad I would've ordered that!   Anyone whose ever been to the Cheesecake Factory knows they give large portion.  So I had this huge takeout of basically spinach & kale with a few sunflower seeds, grapes & diced pears with fabulous dressing.  Once AGAIN - I will not go to the cheesecake factory for the next 30 years.  Maybe they will improve by then."
Heath D.,"Columbus, OH",97,172,130,1.0,7/16/2017,"I have to update my review. This location just can't handle that traffic it seems. We've been here several times in the last two years, because it is closer than that Polaris location, and everyone we say we won't come back. We mean it this time. We don't mind waiting to be seated. That's to be expected. But the quality of service here is despicable. Yes, it's that bad. Maybe it is a hiring issue. A training issue. I have no idea. I get better service at Applebee's or any other cheaper restaurant than at this location. And for the prices here...they should be ashamed. I'll go to Polaris from here out...totally worth the extra 20 minute or so drive. What a shame! I do not recommend this to anyone who would like to be greeted, have their drink orders taken, or have bread to munch on within 10 of being seated."
Ann W.,"Lockbourne, OH",4,7,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"Really can't rate this place since we never ate. Upon arrival we told them we wanted a table in the bar the hostess said it would be a few minutes. We'll after 45 minutes and watching droves of people come and go I still waited because no one was coming and going from the bar area were we was wanting to be seated. Then all of a sudden they started taking couples to the bar. My husband asked why we had been over looked. She asked his name, then could not find it. I was ready to leave then they found us a table so off I went, only to be seated in a cramped little half table up against a wall with children jumping on the seats next to me. I got up and left. I'm not rating the food here since I never had any but I will rate the staff. I will not go back."
Jessica L.,"Columbus, OH",9,133,373,4.0,5/23/2016,"This poor girl has been on a ""healthy-living journey"" for a year and a half now (I've lost 200 pounds!) so when my birthday rolled around this year, I wanted to be REAL bad. So of course I picked the Cheesecake Factory, America's biggest guilty pleasure.  We went on a Friday at about 2:00pm since this location gets crazy packed on Saturday and Sunday and we quickly got a table for 2. Since I knew I was going to eat a slice of cheesecake with an entire days worth of calories and fat grams, we decided to order the chicken samosas appetizer from the Skinnylicious menu. They were amazing! Full of spiced meat and lightly fried but not dripping in grease. The dipping sauce was great too, so we were very pleased with this low-calorie app.  For my meal I ordered the sausage & ricotta flatbread also from the Skinnylicious menu, and my husband had the Cuban sandwich. When they delivered our meals I'm not gonna lie: I was totally jealous of the huge, crusty sandwich my husband received. It looked so unbelievably good! He said it was delicious even though he prefers softer bread (I like it firm and crusty so this looked perfect to me). My flatbread was listed as a small plate and it definitely was small, but it was pretty awesome. The sausage was finely ground and tasted great and the ricotta and kale combo was so tasty. A small dish that packed a ton of flavor, so I was a happy girl. Now, the REAL reason we visited this place...the cheesecake. I had the Oreo dream extreme (covered in thick chocolate and full of soft Oreo bits - EXACTLY what I was craving!) and my husband had the vanilla bean (sounded boring but tasted like the most delicious, whippy scoop of vanilla bean ice cream ever). Both slices were huge and literally too good to put into words.  Overall, this Cheesecake Factory visit made this an awesomely delicious birthday!"
Alix V.,"Columbus, OH",38,78,1,5.0,1/20/2017,"The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. I'm gluten free and dairy free so it's really hard for me to find places with multiple options. TCF has an amazing gluten free menu! I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, gluten free. It's tossed in oil with no Parmesan cheeses. It was amazing! I probably won't order anything else there. The location is great, too. After dinner, my wife and I walked all around the mall. It was a great experience and we'll be coming back for sure."
Gina M.,"Bolivar, OH",1,7,,1.0,8/26/2017,I will never come here again. We have been here for almost an hour without anyone let know what is going on. To top it all off my friend order crisp Cuban rolls and she was told they were out and she ordered an another item and then they came back they were out. Not happy!
Deniece L.,"Columbus, OH",81,206,1774,3.0,11/8/2016,"It had been years since I had eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, but my mom was in visiting and we needed a place that a wide variety of choices for all the picky eaters in my family, so we came here. I remember CF being a good place to eat for special occasions like birthdays and date nights. That still seems to be the case because the servers were performing off-key renditions of Happy Birthday about every 5 minutes. However, the quality of food and service was not what I remember. The food was bland and greasy. Our server seemed bored and was slow on food/drink delivery, despite the restaurant not being all that busy. The prices have gone up quite a bit, too, since the last time we ate here.  At least the cheesecake is still really good. Their mac & cheese was super yummy too. Overall, if you're at Easton and are craving dessert, stop on by, however, there are better, cheaper, non-chain restaurant options in Columbus to try."
Kenny C.,"Denver, CO",63,94,41,1.0,7/25/2017,"This is strictly for the bartender.  Be friendlier!  I decided to get my food to go!  Not sure if she was having a bad day or not, but she was putting off some bad vibes."
Isabel G.,"Columbus, OH",51,98,479,4.0,7/7/2016,"I don't think anyone needs another review for this chain,  but I wanted to review the ""skinny menu"". Be very careful if you are trying to be healthy at the Cheesecake factory and ordering off their regular menu.  Even some of their salads are over 1700 calories! I have tried 3 things from the skinny menu and each dish has been great. I have tried two salads and the turkey burger.  Everything was excellent which surprised me considering how low in calories and fat they all are.  I definitely recommend their skinny menu. Don't be afraid to try it because I am a fat kid and I honestly enjoyed everything I have tried from this menu. Since you are ordering from the skinny menu, you might as well split a piece of cheesecake with someone. Just don't look at the calories,  sugar, fat, or carbohydrates unless you want to cry."
Beth H.,"Columbus, OH",27,18,,3.0,3/5/2017,"We came here for lunch on a Saturday around one and this place was packed. Regardless,  the wait for a party of seven was only forty-five minutes.  The menu here is huge. Overwhelmingly huge. Our waitress was able to name a few of her favorites, but with a menu this big, I feel like you are taking a gamble on quantity over quality. Either way, I had the cashew chicken with brown rice, extra spicy. The sauce was more toward sweet than spicy, but still good. If you like spicy food, I would recommend emphasizing that when you order. For an appetizer, we had the corn tamales. I would not really call them corn tamales. They were more like a sweet corn cake, but they were still good. Everyone at the table seemed pleased with what they ordered.  Now for the best part, the cheesecake. Order the cheesecake. Is it a little expensive? yes. But just do it. You won't regret it. So pick one of the many different flavors and ignore the sheer amount of calories. You'll be glad you did."
Savannah B.,"New Albany, OH",4,14,1,3.0,8/8/2017,I love Cheesecake Factory because of the vast menu and the chicken maderia is my go-to dish. Still great food at this location but the service was slow and we were not served the bread. Not exactly a good situation when you're starving.
Trina T.,"Whitehall, Columbus, OH",531,78,61,4.0,5/26/2017,"Nothing pleases me more than the abundance of portions not just with their cheesecake alone but their salad can be eaten for a dinner serving. The ambience is nice,always busy but the workers are always smiling and on point, food comes out hot hot hot and the cheesecake selection is to die for!!!"
Justin P.,"Columbus, OH",42,137,241,4.0,6/5/2016,The atmosphere is nice nut food just a little above average. I mean nothing tjat blows your mind and I've had several dishes here. Today I ordered the orange chicken and was not impressed. The chicken was hard and lack flavor. The glaze was barely on the chicken so I had to request more. The cheese cake was just ok which was the carmel salted version. The sweetness of the glaze and the crust fought each other way too much. Now the service was excellent no complaints what so ever. Order was correct and she recommended the lunch portion which was still huge. I say come give it a whirl and enjoy an outing.
Justin H.,"Mason, MI",0,25,51,3.0,7/15/2017,"Stopped in for dinner with some friends.  The meal was pretty good overall, but the cheesecake was the star of the show.  The menu is huge which can make it hard to narrow down what you want, but also to maintain standards of quality."
Stephanie K.,"Columbus, OH",134,139,210,4.0,3/24/2016,Last Sunday I met my best friend for brunch.. Another friend had mentioned for me to get the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes; that they were the best she ever had.. So sure enough we both ordered Large Iced Coffees and split the pancakes. She also ordered the Chicken and Waffles which we both enjoyed.. Everything was great.. service and quality of food.. We will definitely be back soon...
Tag T.,"Zanesville, OH",72,36,31,5.0,1/6/2017,The food and service that I had were both amazing. We had the mac and cheese bites for an appetizer and it was some of the best fried food I've eaten. I ordered the buffalo blasts for my meal and they were great. My wife got the mac and cheese burger which had fried mac and cheese on it and it was also amazing. Server was great as well.
Steven H.,"Columbus, OH",70,70,501,3.0,4/21/2016,"I decided to stop in for dinner and eat on the patio since it was a nice sunny day out. The patio is real nice, but to me i think the servers had to many tables which slowed down the service.  My wife and I started off with drinks she had the strawberry Martini i had the red Sangria it took longer than usual to just get two drinks this was not at a peak time it was before the 6pm dinner crowd. I ordered a side salad i say about 20 mins had past no salad the next thing i know here comes our food never brought out my salad. The food was delicious and our server was nice. The bill came and my wife and I was shocked on how much our drinks cost her Martini was 11.95 and my Sangria was 10.95 let me say this the drinks are way to expensive and not worth it. The drinks are to pricey, so beware before you order a drink."
Lauren F.,"Westerville, OH",199,33,,4.0,11/5/2016,Our food and service was wonderful! Christian was our server and he did a great job making sure our drinks were always full and that we were enjoying ourselves! He always had a smile on his face and was polite to all of the tables around us as well! Christian and the cooks deserve 5 stars for sure!  I gave 4 stars because we were told a 30 minute wait and waited for an hour. I understand they can't give you an exact quote of how long it will be but 5 or 6 two tops were seated before us that came in well over 20 minutes AFTER we did. When we asked the hostess about it they sat us within 5 minutes. Need more training up front for sure!
Me So Hungryy Y.,"Westlake, OH",1,80,97,4.0,5/21/2017,"This factory was crazy busy. Server was great, food was pretty good like usual.  Lettuce chicken wraps were a bit skimpy for price. 2 of the lettuces were almost too small to pick up. Taquitos were good but needed more filling."
Kimberly P.,"San Francisco, CA",121,282,119,4.0,8/1/2016,"I love TCF and every chance I get, I am there! Stopped in for dinner with my mom and sister. The wait was about 20 minutes and our waiter was great. Of course, my libation of choice is the J.W.'s Pink Lemonade and I am currently loving the Chicken Littles entree that comes with corn succotash and mashed potatoes. The food and service was great.

Laura E.,"Columbus, OH",0,3,1,2.0,6/4/2016,"A.) Our app took 15 mins before they even came to tell us it wasn't available.  B.) A large piece of paper was found in my food (after I got it partially in my mouth). Management said, ""Sorry...""  And took that item off our bill. Took my fries from me. Maybe the entire experience warranted a free meal. Good damage control would have made us return. We spend money and tip GREAT! Both my boyfriend and I work in restaurants and are forgiving of mistakes, but not being dismissed.  Food was good enough that we might try Polaris CheeFact"
Gwen W.,"Columbus, OH",381,1097,2553,2.0,12/7/2014,"Since I had a GC, a friend and I decided to eat here. It was pretty busy When we got here, on a Thursday evening at 7 pm, but we got seated right away (simply because we were a party of two). Our waitress was pleasant.  Thoughts on the food? This was not my first Time to CCF. And, in fact, after eating the cheesecake when I got home, it seemed lacking compared to my last piece of cc from here. In fact, I wasn't pleased with the tiramisu taste this time. Change of recipe? Or have my tastebuds changed over the 2 years. And for the $5.95 price, I'm inclined to say I like the Kroger cake better. Yes, you heard me. Unfortunately, this leaves me rather bummed. All the talk and hype, and my tongue didn't get that experience.  Backing up, I got Chicken Carbonara for the main course. Tender chicken cubes. Creamy garlic-cheese sauce. A good amount of bacon bits. Not bad. $18 good? Don't know if I'd go that far.  I'm not sure I'll be back, unless of course, family decides to meet for a meal. The prices are, I feel, too high. Perhaps they feel it's warrant, since Easton's clientele has more income to burn. Who knows. I'm inclined toward the local, mom and pop places, that you know every penny is put back into the establishment, and food!!"
Holly F.,"Morgantown, WV",37,37,27,2.0,9/24/2016,"After waiting for about 10 minutes to even be greeted by the busy staff, we were led to our table by a frazzled host who kept either changing his mind or was confused about where to seat us.  Once we were seated, we noticed that the restaurant was cramped and loud. The din of room was saturated with the sounds of screaming kids, the bustling, open kitchen, and harried servers which made it feel like a hospital cafeteria.  We couldn't decide on the theme of the decor, either. Egyptian? Havana? Tropical? Ancient Roman?  Anyway, the place was so busy that the servers seemed to not be able to keep up. Our server was pleasant, but forgetful. We were finished eating for almost 30 minutes receiving our check while we watched other tables come and go.  The food was ok, chain restaurant quality.  Portions were small for the price, but my blueberry mojito was pretty good. Overall, I was underwhelmed yet overestimulated by the busy, noisy atmosphere."
