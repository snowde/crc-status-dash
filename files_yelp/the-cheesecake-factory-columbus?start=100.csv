Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,4.0,11/28/2014,"There's an endless amount of national chains available for lunch or dinner when shopping in Easton. Some are good. Others, not so much. Meanwhile, there's two things you can count on at this Cheesecake Factory: an endless amount of choices and consistency. This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory's in the country, and I've been to many of them over the years. Great location, too.  There's no point in going through what's good and bad on the menu. I'm guessing anyone that would shop in this area has been here or to one of the many locations nationwide before. We all know there's nothing bad on the menu and portions are huge!"
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,9/14/2010,"I thought their hostess was a bit unfriendly and could have sworn a couple of other groups who came in after were seated before us... but I won't hold a grudge because everything else was satisfactory. I wanted to sit outside on a patio somewhere in Easton to have a drink or two. The Cheesecake Factory has a fairly large outside seating area so we opted for them.  I was glad to have a much friendlier waiter!  I'm a fan of their 'small plates and snacks' page in their menu.  We ordered the Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip as well as their pear and brie pizzette. The dip is addicting (as expected) and the pizzette is not for everyone. It may be an acquired taste for some but i like brie cheese and thought it was a creative addition to their menu. I like this restaurant because it's for everyone and I think everyone can find something they like. It may be a chain but it's a notch above and certainly not an Applebee's or a TGIFriday. It's great because they were able to create a place where people will come so many reasons. Whether it's celebrating important events like their birthday or anniversary, a place to have a drink at the bar, just to buy a cheesecake, or to dine with their little kids and know they'll make a huge mess!"
Ness S.,"Dublin, OH",80,468,276,3.0,6/25/2014,"The cheesecakes here are really good. My favorite is the new york cheesecake or the chocolate raspberry, both are quite decadent. The food is standard fare. Gigantic portions, generally taste fine but nothing stands out and the pasta dishes can be quite greasy. Unless you're really hungry, plan on taking some home. The cocktail menu is extensive and the mimosa and  the margaritas are quite good. Nice place but I wouldn't wait for an hour to be seated, which is what you should expect on a weekend night."
Emma L.,"Columbus, OH",124,331,211,4.0,11/12/2012,"I'm not much of a chain-goer, but I have to admit I do really like The Cheesecake Factory.  A year or so ago I would have given around 3 stars for not really being my thing, but ever since they introduced the small-plates and 'skinnylicious' (questionable marketing decision there) menus, I'm a fan!  My favorite way to dine here is to order a bottle of their house Cabernet (around $30), split one of the bigger appetizer salads (~$10) and then a few small plates to share (ranging from $4-$8). It's for sure enough to share between 2 people and we leave feeling great - not uncomfortably full with 3 pounds of leftovers in a to-go bag.  Service is usually pretty great and no one seems to mind a couple of people enjoying a leisurely shared dinner, even on a  semi-busy night.  Seriously, try the small plates!"
Brian H.,"Cincinnati, OH",52,146,86,5.0,1/1/2015,This is the first time I ate a Cheesecake Factory and it didn't disappoint. The menu could be a bit overwhelming because of all number of selections and to make it worse everything looked good. I ended up going with the Pasta Carbonara which was beyond amazing. The service was friendly and even though it was busy our food came out pretty quick. To top it off I had a piece of vanilla bean cheesecake. My only complaint was that the unsweetened tea tasted more like green tea then black but not the end of the world. Would definitely return!
Sierra L.,"Harrisburg, OH",0,2,,5.0,7/31/2016,"I love this place...their food is delicious and their cheesecakes even more so, they are AMAZING!  The only complaint is that there are so many calories in this so I only eat half of the slice and save the rest for the next day so that I can actually eat part of a meal.  Next time I'm having them cut it in half and put half in  to-go box since its sooo hard to be self disciplined lol"
Will P.,"Columbus, OH",161,355,58,2.0,3/26/2013,"Menu full of nothing I like   For such a large menu, I can never find anything that I like from Cheesecake.  It is just not good to me.  I don't eat cheesecake either, and the desserts I have had weren't very good.  Maybe next time, sike there won't be a next time."
M B.,"Gahanna, Columbus, OH",9,20,23,1.0,9/24/2015,Food was extremely salty. Terrible service. Will not be coming back! Way overpriced for what it is!
Misty H.,"Ashville, OH",25,1,,2.0,12/31/2015,"Food was good but overpriced.  Our server, Charles, acted annoyed the whole time with our family of three.  He didn't even bag our food but bagged the table next to us.  I am sure we won't be frequenting this establishment."
Matt P.,"Columbus, OH",54,201,496,4.0,1/23/2014,"Many already know what The Cheesecake Factory is all about-a lot of love/hate out there. Consensus is that they have a huge menu (and servings) of food-burgers, pasta, pizza, salads, seafood, steaks, etc, etc. Not great on beer selection-Blue Moon is as ""exotic"" as they get. However, many don't know of their Sunday Brunch-that's right, Sunday Brunch.  One of the cool things about Yelping is hearing something many don't know about, hopping on here and sharing that info. Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Sorry, I was rambling so I jumped straight to it. This is my favorite item on their brunch menu. Pancakes? Yes. So what. So what? Here's what-buttermilk pancakes with ricotta cheese and lemon zest. Sounds so simple doesn't it? Is it Sunday yet? They're so light, fluffy, moist and ...refreshing? It's the lemon zest-so good. A must try. ...also, the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake. Dear God. I grew up loving this cake and when I tried CF's cheesecake version I just stared at it after one bite."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,4.0,5/29/2012,"For a chain restaurant I would give it 5 stars but overall a solid 4 stars. We hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in years (last time in Beveryly Hills, CA) and didn't remember it being anything special. This time we had a gift card and were shopping at Easton and figured to give it another chance. We got there monday at 5 with minimal wait and once we saw the happy hour menu decided to sit at the bar. Service was very nice and super fast, we were on an out in an hour. The prices are steep for a chain restaurant, there was no way I was going to pay $25+ for some fish so once I saw they have a housemade veggie burger I had to give it a try. It was pretty good, not as good as Northstar or some others but descent. The house sald with ginger soy super yummy, best dressing ever! We got a bunch of $5 plates the guys favorite was the mac n cheese balls, the burger sliders were also pretty good, the chicken sliders ok but not much chicken, really more bread and breading than anything else. The tex mex egg rolls were fine, I loved the avocado spread with it. The chicken potstickers were also good. Portions for apps were pretty big, you get alot more than at any other restaurant we've been to and for $5 a good deal. I just can't jutify paying $7 for a slice of cake so I've yet to try that but I did stand there and drool for a few minutes...."
Yasser A.,"Columbus, OH",9,34,20,3.0,9/7/2015,"I love eating in Cheesecake factory because the quality and taste of food,  yet, today the restaurant fails to deliver good service which I noticed to be the case during busy times!"
Sarah W.,"Columbus, OH",198,90,40,4.0,7/19/2015,"The wait to get a table takes a long time. Staff pleasant, delicious food, the pumpernickel bread is amazing! Menu is huge. Their vegetable salad is incredible, portions are huge. They have a skinny menu which is delicious. Cheesecake good, but rich. I can only eat a few bites and usually share with someone. Decor beautiful."
Gia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,63,2,1.0,12/31/2014,"I fucking love cake.  I will do a lot of shit for cake.  It's the only reason and the best part of braving polar temperatures and snow monsters, bearing hordes of white people who can neither parallel park nor be successful pedestrians (by successful, I mean, behaving in crosswalks in a way suggesting one chooses life), eventually just leaving your car wherever because ""officer, frankly, I am feeling rather handicapped, yes. Also, I've no loose change"", shoving your way past all the assholes who can find no other place to loiter in the restaurant lobby of the Cheesecake Factory but in the clearly marked ROPED OFF line for desserts and carryout, watching as a gainfully employed young black man slices a curiously small $10 piece of cake and proceeds to manhandle said piece like it's meatloaf, and you'll notice this started with ""the best part"" and you'll notice I can't finish the sentence because what the FUCK.  I never want to watch someone PALM a piece of cake, MY piece, like it's a motherfucking steak; and when I say no whipped cream, I never want anyone to roll their eyes and attempt to scrape the whipped cream off of the palmed piece of cake; and I never want to have to say ""NO THAT'S NOT A THING CUT ANOTHER PIECE YOU ARE THE REASON WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS""; and I never want to start having symptoms of a rage stroke in a motherfucking Cheesecake Factory lobby as I watch the same asshole cut a new smaller piece (BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO PALM, I ASSUME) and all without ever changing gloves.  Please promptly message me if you can direct me to a place where I might address the increasing urgency of my carrot cake needs because I don't know what in the living fuck that nonsense last night was but the devil is a lie.  #THESTRUGGLE"
Eric M.,"Hilltop, Columbus, OH",0,7,,1.0,11/14/2015,"This was an extremely bad experience for me and my family, especially since we were coming here for a couple of birthdays. I concede that it was very busy at the time but we waited over an hour for our food and all the dishes were cold by the time we got them. I'm trying not to blame the waiter (who's name I did not get), but he did not offer any excuse as to why our food was late or why they were all cold. And it especially didn't help when he almost put his tie into my food several times when he was trying to refill some waters at our table. I've had decent experiences here before but we spent about an hour and a half from being seated to getting our food. This will most likely be my last time I go here and I can't recommend anyone going here for a larger party because you will be waiting for an extremely long time."
Jennifer A.,"Mentor, OH",57,13,12,3.0,9/21/2015,They were out of several dishes our party of 9 tried to order last evening.  All salmon dishes and shrimp platters. That was disappointing but mostly that they did not tell the people who ordered the shrimp platters they did not have them until right when everyone else was receiving their food. So these people had to wait for the new food to be made. While we ate. They got their food much later. Nothing was offered to them. We had to ask. When we did and the manager came. He was surprised no one had told him much earlier so he could have handled. Food was good but they handled the situation poorly.
Rebecca B.,"Columbus, OH",1,15,,2.0,10/31/2015,Not thrilled. Quility of food is not represented by the high prices. My $15 fish tacos should have been $7. Same for my husband and daughters meals. Over priced for not great food. Not surprised though anybody with that many items on there menu usually don't hit the mark on all of it. There known for cheesecake so that's all they should do.
Tory R.,"Westerville, OH",185,278,312,3.0,12/11/2011,"I love the food at the Cheesecake factory!! My favorite is the bang bang chicken and shrimp. And it's one of the best things for you (calorie-wise) on the menu.  This particular location is usually rather busy, being in Easton and all. I went on a Thursday evening with my parents and our wait was around 30-35 minutes.....but the people watching was good....plus, we also had a menu and it took about that long to look through it to find out what we wanted! :o) The only thing I don't like about this place is that their prices keep going up. I'm kind've a tight-wad...especially around the holidays. My favorite dish (bang bang chicken & shrimp) is now $17.95. And that's just for the actual meal. If you want a caesar salad (side salad) is $8.95. Really??!! And then of course you have to have dessert. In my case it's either carrot cake or one of the chocolate cakes because I just don't like cheesecake.  This is a good place to go one in a while....but I'm not willing to submit to the rediculous prices on a routine basis."
T T.,"Columbus, OH",0,7,,2.0,5/31/2016,"I ordered a ribeye.  The good news:  I ordered it medium rare and it was prepared properly.  The bad news:  It was way too salty.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce--seemed like a wine sauce or demi-glace of some type, or it was some type of rub they prepped it with, but whatever they doused it in spoiled the taste of an otherwise perfectly prepared cut of meat.  The mashed potatoes, bread and salad were good, but that does not offset the price of the meal.  For the price of the steak, comparable to restaurants for which steak is their specialty, it shouldn't taste like salt pork."
Kevin C.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2015,20 minutes 20 more minutes after 20 minutes. Management.... as a consumer I do not ask how long as a formality I ask how long the wait is to see if I want to wait for your services...... very poor customer service.
