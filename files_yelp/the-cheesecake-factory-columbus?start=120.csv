Kevin C.,"Valparaiso, IN",89,112,263,3.0,4/17/2013,"There is really only one word to describe The Cheesecake Factory: M'eh. Judging from the ambiance and prices, this restaurant attempts to market itself as a sophisticated, up-scale dining option. What this restaurant achieves superficially, it missed the mark in substance. Unfortunately, there isn't much about this place that would commend itself to those seeking an enjoyable night out - especially considering what you'll end up paying.  On the few occasions I've eaten here, it has always been exceedingly crowded regardless of the day. On my most recent visit, my wife and I were packed into a row of tables like sardines. We ended sitting elbow-to-elbow with a group of rambunctious, Australian muscle-heads who spent the evening bragging about their most recent DUIs. The whole restaurant was extremely loud (Australians notwithstanding) so much so that we could barely carry on a private conversation.  The food was overall very average. The offerings and quality are about what you might expect from TGI Fridays, just 50% more expensive. The service was okay, and the wait times were a bit longer than what you'd like. The only reason I bumped this review up to 3 stars was because of the cheesecake. In this realm, they certainly live up to their reputation. The variety and overall deliciousness of the dessert menu was the evening's saving grace. But, you can always just buy a cheesecake to go, and skip the unwanted invasions on your wallet and personal space."
Aj S.,"Elk Grove, CA",30,7,2,3.0,2/26/2016,"Tried to call an order for cheesecake  pick up was put on hold for seven minutes with no answer so I walked into the store. Spoke to Michael D in bakery who then said that there wasn't any call transferred to him for a cheesecake order and was also informed that they do not do carry out order for cheesecake over the phone. Michael D then took our order, never got an apology for being put on hold or misinformed. Very poor customer service."
P. G.,"Detroit, MI",0,4,1,5.0,4/3/2016,Food exceeded expectations. Fresh and delicious! Service was great. Godiva cheesecake was amazing!
Meghann T.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",107,133,52,3.0,6/6/2013,"When it comes to chain restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory is in my top 5. It's clean, the servers are attentive and efficient, and the menu is always exciting with each visit (I mean, come on, there is almost 10 pages)! I'm also always super impressed with the servers, and how they maintain CLEAN and SPOTLESS white uniforms - props, Cheesecake staff! My favorite entree is the Chicken Madeira. My favorite cheesecake is the Lemon Raspberry. Parking is a PAIN for this location (same with Polaris), but I deal with it."
Kevin C.,"Zanesville, OH",1,50,13,5.0,3/14/2015,"Stopped for a late lunch with wife. We were seated immediately and approached within a minute by server. He was a very happy and knowledgeable young man. After a few suggestions we ordered the potstickers as an app as well as asian lettuce wraps and turkey avocado sandwich. All items delivered in a timely manner, presented well and tasted delicious. We finished the meal with a lemon meringue cheesecake and coffee. What could be better. This location never disappoints."
Jamie C.,"Canal Winchester, OH",35,42,9,5.0,7/10/2013,"I thought it was great. The wait wasn't long, our waitress was nice and the food tasted wonderful. I had the veggie burger, mom had the turkey burger, dad had the Cuban sandwich, and my niece had a kids cheese pizza. The prices are fair because you get quite a lot. Didn't really like the strawberry lemonade and my mom didn't like the garden house salad because it was romaine lettuce. Oh she was also disappointed in the cheese cake because it wasn't all that but she like it. Overall nice."
Rick M.,"Lancaster, OH",48,154,106,3.0,11/21/2014,I'm not a huge fan as I think their menu is just a little overwhelming and nothing stands out or is exemplary.  I had the chicken katsu this time and it was rather tasty. However the 1900 calorie count was a bit of a sticker shock.  They are a solid restaurant but I'm more a mom and pop type of guy.  Now the cheesecake is rather unique and delish.  Overall a little pricey but enough variety that just about anyone can find something to dine on.
Sara M.,"South Gate, CA",1,29,,3.0,4/16/2015,"First time going to this restaurant and i must say everything was delicious except for the customer service. Our server was beyond rude, he couldn't recommend anything on the menu and then he did not attend to us like he did the a table that was right next to us. Im completely unsatisfied with the service but I can say the food was on point. Next time i'll have to just order out to enjoy my meal completely."
Mayuri M.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",0,34,25,3.0,12/22/2013,"THE GOOD: The food was good, as it always is. Their portions are typically large but I opted for the lunch menu so it was appropriately sized. The cheesecake was excellent, as expected.  THE BAD: Took us forever to be seated, the food took a while and even getting water took at least 15 minutes. The worse has got to be the service - our server was horrible. I suppose he was having a bad day but I'd would have rather he didn't take it out on us. He threw the menus down, he threw the glasses of water causing it to spill and just had a sour disposition all together. He would even slightly throw out food when they arrived. This restaurant would be 5-star worthy if not for the server.  OVERALL: I personally won't be returning anytime soon."
Stephanie P.,"Dublin, OH",53,284,35,4.0,6/24/2013,"A 10 minute wait at 7:00pm on a Friday in Easton?!? That's worth 4 stars alone.  That was the wait length for seating inside and outside. We wanted outside so we could enjoy the beautiful weather and people watch the Easton Art Festival goers. We got exactly what we wanted. With an excellent waiter and cocktails to boot.  I had the chicken parm sandwich which was pretty tasty. The boyfriend had the luau salad which was massive and incredibly good. And, when I say massive, I meant it... it was 3 stories high. For drinks, I skipped the wine and went with J.W.'s pink lemonade which tasted exactly like pink lemonade despite being entirely alcohol. I don't remember the name of the drink my bf had but it was tropical and wonderful. No cheesecake on this visit but I pressed my face against the case so I know what I am having for dinner next time."
Philip F.,"Fort Wayne, IN",13,4,,2.0,1/17/2015,"On a Saturday afternoon at 3,  we waited 52 minutes for a seat,  and then another 30 minutes for food.  No wonder the wait to be seated was so long! The waitress was passable. The food was good."
Cynthia P.,"Columbus, OH",0,3,3,2.0,7/27/2016,"Our family a party of 5 went to this resturant to celebrate out daughters 20th birthday. After Looking over the menu and talking we realized that 30 minutes had passed and we did not have a server. I stopped a passing server who said she did not know who our server was, that she would check . When she returned she said she did not know who it was  but would take our drink order. She did that and our appetizer order. Meanwhile I stopped a hostess and asked who was our server and told her how long we have been waiting. She said she would check, she came to our table a short while later said Nathan was our server and he would be with us shortly. He never came, but the server who took our initial order delivered an appetizer and said she would take care of us.meanwhile people all around us were being seated and served.  I asked the hostess for the manager, who arrived and was apologetic and would take care of our appetizer. Our food was slow to come, but tasty as usual. When our check came the appetizer was still on our check. I told the server about the error, she had to check with the manager. That was an awful evening . Never should a customer have to chase down for a server!"
Paul F.,"Columbus, OH",175,927,2263,4.0,2/20/2011,"I hadn't been here in quite a while so I decided to come over tonight for dinner.  My biggest problem was 1) finding it. and 2) getting back to it after looking for a parking space.  But I managed to do both.  Finding a seat has never been a problem for me since I've always been content to eat at the bar and that's what I did tonight.  And they were CROWDED!!   But I sat at the bar and ordered a number of small plates.  I got the corn fritters (these were the best of the bunch), the beets and goat cheese, and the small house salad.  For dessert I got a piece of cheesecake to bring home and I haven't been hungry enough to even look at it yet. The small house salad would have been plenty large for me under any conditons and the beets, well, there could have been a few more of them.  But it was a good meal and I'll likely go back again."
Bonnie A.,"Columbus, OH",0,3,,5.0,5/16/2014,Love love love the smokehouse bbq burger.  This is our go_to place for gurlie gatherings.  The brown bread loaf is the best. White vested waiters leave you feeling pampered.  Prices are on the high end which is why we save this for special gatherings.  Expect $50 for 2 if ur going for the dessert (and who isnt?) Plus $10 tip.  Worth it occasionally !
Anna H.,"Hilliard, OH",192,541,206,4.0,1/8/2013,"I've only dined-in a couple of times and I've had good food.  They are always very busy.  I especially like the Avocado Eggrolls on the appetizer menu, which are to-die-for.  If I am at Easton (which is not often at all because I hate people) I will get them as carryout.  One of my favorite dishes ever."
David W.,"Nashport, OH",2,89,2,3.0,9/2/2014,"We had read previous reviews and thought we'd try it out this past Sunday afternoon.  The place was packed, but because we were just a twosome we were seated immediately.  The seating is what I call picnic style.  You are  essentially sharing a table with strangers. I ordered a Swiss/ mushroom burger that came with fries, and the wife got a pecan covered French Toast dish with bacon.  The food wasn't bad - average, a bit pricy ($12.50 for the burger & fries), decent atmosphere if you love crowds, and slightly above average service.  We didn't try the cheesecake but it sure looked good.  I felt like the whole experience was kind of ""yuppy"", but hey we were in that kind of area.  Will we go back?  For the price and type of food available here, probably not.  There are to many other choices in this area of Columbus."
Taylor M.,"Columbus, OH",0,8,,5.0,11/29/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory at Easton is ALWAYS packed, but I don't mind because the food is amazing. The servers are very attentive and always extremely grateful when you leave a good tip. The bread is warm and soft. My favorite is the fried mac and cheese, but all of their pastas are great. I rarely have room left in my stomach for cheesecake, but it's worth the stomachache."
Amy H.,"Flanders, NJ",66,198,95,5.0,8/3/2015,"always a grand slam with a large group.  we each can order different items - chicken, pasta, asian, etc.  everything you could want!  we very much enjoy all of the options.  drinks are great and HUGE.  service was great.  our waiter was hysterical and quick with service and we were there!"
Dawn K.,"Cleveland, OH",22,96,26,2.0,10/9/2011,"Went to Cheesecake Factory because we had a gift card. It was OK, but not great. Had either the food or service been better, they likely would have gotten 3 stars.  First issue, we waited more than 20 minutes for our appetizer. Then, our entrees came before we had finished the appetizer.  Our buffalo blasts appetizer was pretty good, but could have used a bit more spice. I had the ""spicy"" chicken tacos for my entree. It was not spicy, was pretty much tasteless and was dry. The biggest taste I got was from the tortilla, instead of everything in it.  Next issue was with the service. Our waitress was friendly and nice, but I think she had too many tables. We were both completely out of water. She stopped to check on the food and mentioned she would get more, but it never came.  The best part of the meal was the cheesecake. I got the pumpkin cheesecake, and it was delicious. We also finally got some more water- we asked for it when our cheesecake was delivered.  Not terrible, but I'm glad I didn't pay for most of the meal. Probably won't go back for dinner."
Heather S.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/24/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory, and especially the one at Easton. We always get great service there and the waiters and waitresses spend the perfect amount of time at the table. Some restaurants you get annoyed by constantly getting asked if everything is okay, or sometimes they don't come to your table quite enough. Every time we are at Easton they stop by and fill drinks and I sometimes don't even realize it. Maybe one or two stops by the table making sure everything is okay. It's very nice! Can actually enjoy my dinner and have conversations without interruptions every 5/10 minutes, but still have full drinks and see them walk by if we need to stop them.  Not to mention their food is to die for. Haven't had one thing yet that I don't like from any Cheesecake Factory!"
