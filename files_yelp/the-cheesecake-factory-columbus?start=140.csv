The Yelp-inator W.,"Germantown, TN",2,329,72,4.0,7/14/2012,"Yum - the cheesecake factory Awesome menu - Consistently good food, service, and atmosphere. Same here as the other ones I have been to."
Sarah F.,"Columbus, OH",125,512,202,4.0,6/3/2010,"I really do like their food, and of course cheesecake, but they lose a star for the  dreadful wait. I know it's great to be busy, but I hate waiting forever and then having to swim my way through a stupid busy sea of people and tables and chairs to get to where I'm going.  I did visit once on a Monday morning I believe? It was pretty slow, and THAT was nice. So maybe I should only go on weekday mornings or afternoons."
Richy R.,"Westerville, OH",0,4,,2.0,7/16/2015,The surprising mediocrity of this restaurants interior doesn't even start to compensate for the poor food and even poorer service. At least the cheesecake isn't half bad.
Courtney W.,"Daytona Beach, FL",50,337,195,3.0,5/14/2013,"Every once in a while I review a place and I look at the star rating and I go 'huh..I really don't know' and then you weigh the pros and the cons. I had this issue with this place. I LOVE this place but this location wasn't as good as what I remember back east. The wait at 6pm was an hour and half so we walked over to barnes and noble and browsed, which is always nice for a mall restaurant... there's distractions. When our names were called we noticed the wait went up to 3 hours. THAT IS NUTS!!! I don't care how good the cheesecake is, 3 hours is NUTS!!  So we get in at about 7:30 and our waitress took a considerable amount of time to get to us and was in a rush the whole night, often forgetting we asked for things like napkins or more bread. She needed a break to say the least....badly! The bread that was on the table was stale; like 2 days ago type stale. For an app we all shared the buffalo blasts (Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing) which was tasty... a lot tastier then I thought they would be. The dipping sauce was bad though. They didn't go together at all.  I ordered the chicken romano (Breast of Chicken Coated with a Romano-Parmesan Cheese Crust. Served with Pasta w/ Tomato Sauce.)  It was 2 flattened pieces of dried out chicken with panko bread crumbs (tasted no cheese) with a huge (like 4 servings) of pasta with a creamy red sauce. The sauce was good but there was barely any at all on the pasta and the chicken was drier then a boot so I asked for more sauce not wanting to send the food back; it took long enough to get to us the first time. The hubby got some kind of pasta and had the same issue I did; didn't realize what he was ordering and it came out dry and without much sauce. We both asked for more sauce which came out quick.  Dad got a salad which was large, but not enough food for a man in his eyes. He didn't say much else about it apart from complaining about prices for bad food. My mom order mac and cheese, which came out deep fried. She was horrified by the calories but her face showed she was in heaven.  The reason we go back is the cheesecake. I got the red velvet cheese cake this time. My favorite so far, although their blueberry cheese cake is so heavenly that I may have two favorites. Then again, every new flavor I try ends up being my new favorite so oh well. Mom got a huge piece of carrot cake and dam near licked the plate clean. I think next time I'll just go back for apps and cheesecake."
Joe S.,"Columbus, OH",2,30,6,5.0,10/12/2013,It was really good I got the burrito it was really good then for cheese cake I got the taremisu sorry for my spelling not sure how to spell that but anyway it was really good service too
Kathy G.,"Villa Park, CA",0,16,5,3.0,7/27/2014,"We LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. Have been to them from Hawaii to Florida, but THIS ONE IS SO SLOW AND INEFFICIENT for some reason. We have gone here repeatedly and it is ALWAYS the same-SLOW and they get the orders WRONG"
Faith C.,"Toledo, OH",64,296,422,4.0,12/3/2011,"This is another chain restaurant that I love to visit! The times that I've gone to this location, the employees have been friendly and attentive. The last time I was there, the waiter was overly friendly but I guess that's better than being rude.  They have such a large variety of foods from Asian dishes to Mexican and even comfort food like meatloaf & shepherd's pie. Yum- meatloaf!!   And their cheesecake! Delish! Love the fresh strawberry and the vanilla bean! I wish we had a Cheesecake Factory where I lived!"
Mary C.,"Grove City, OH",8,27,10,3.0,8/14/2013,"There was no wait at 5 pm on a Wednesday!  Service was good but hard to hear with the loudness of the music.  Had the skinnyliciousness tacos with chicken, pretty good!  The Cuban is what my boyfriend ordered.  It was very tasty.  I would definitely come back again."
Neal W.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",157,139,26,2.0,7/27/2013,"Here are the top six things you should know before visiting The Cheesecake Factory in Easton (or any Cheesecake Factory, really): 1.) This place is always seems to be pretty busy, but I can't seem to understand why. My excuse was that I had a gift certificate, but I imagine most people are choosing to send their dining dollars to Cheesecake Factory over one of the local great restaurants they could discover through Yelp. 2.) They're obviously known for their large portions, and the food is actually pretty good, but everything tastes good when it's made with two sticks of butter and topped with cheddar cheese. The menu is also very large, which would be good if you're with a bunch of picky eaters, but it was honestly a bit overwhelming and hard to figure out which items would be the best choices. 3.) The decor in this place seems to be having some identity issues. There seemed to be Mediterranean, Egyptian, Italian, French, and possibly Jersey Shore influence in the design. Again, it seems like they're trying to have as many concepts as possible to please everyone, but it just comes off strange and identity-less. 4.) The prices are a little high, but I guess many find comfort knowing that they are going to get a decent meal and plenty of leftovers. 5.) The service is pretty good. No complaints from my visit.  6.) By the end of our meal we were stuffed, but since it's The Cheesecake Factory, we felt obligated to get a slice (plus cheesecake is delicious). We got a piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake to go and it tasted great. For being called The Cheesecake Factory, that does seem to be where their strength is. If I had a craving I could see myself stopping back in to get a slice, but I wouldn't come back for the rest of the menu. Got your six, Neal"
Megan T.,"Columbus, OH",40,122,25,2.0,12/15/2013,"Ten tragedies. The Cheesecake Factory at this location has been going downhill for a while now. Today just took the cake. It took forever to get us seated. We had to get up and ask for a high chair for our son. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, sans chicken, sub shrimp. It came out and the shrimp weren't cleaned properly, and the sauce was like water. It was ridiculous. I know it was Sunday afternoon. I realize that we were seated during a shift change. But there was really no excuse for the subpar food. I ended up sending it back and gnoshed on some of my guy's fries. Disappointing."
Chelsea M.,"MI, MI",74,272,160,3.0,1/31/2011,Just went here for a few drinks after walking around Easton. The martinis were tasty and the people watching was very entertaining. The best recommendation I have for any Cheesecake Factory is come with the mindset to wait- because it's going to be a while.
G D.,"Lima, OH",18,35,,4.0,2/15/2014,"The place was packed for Valentine's day. Despite that fact, there were plenty of servers, and we didnt have to wait long for anything. our waitress was very sweet, and did an adequate job. The food was amazing. I had the Chicken Di Pana. Delicious! If there weren't so many places to eat in Columbus, I'd be back again today."
Kelly T.,"Bloomington, IL",63,28,7,5.0,3/23/2011,"Huge menu.  I got the lunch size of the Cobb salad and it was HUGE.  No clue what the full sized portion would be.  Everyone loved their entrees and then on to the cheesecake.    Lots of choices here too.  I am a big Key Lime Pie fan, so I got their cheesecake version of that.  I highly recommend."
Steve G.,"Columbus, OH",6,34,6,4.0,1/21/2011,"There is a reason there is always a wait. The menu here is ridiculous. I challenge anyone to not find something that sounds appetizing. You can find just about anything here whether your in the mood for Italian, Indian, Mexican, American, whatever. Yes it's a huge chain restaurant, but it's consistently good in our experience. The food is always well prepared. I've eaten here dozens of times in several cities and have always found the food and waitstaff to be much better than average. You can't go wrong with the Chicken Madeira. I also like several of their pasta dishes. Salads are good but they are not a hea Gets 4 stars for the crazy wait times and the cheesecake is overpriced."
David C.,"University District, Columbus, OH",0,1,1,4.0,12/9/2013,"I always enjoying going to the Cheesecake Factory! The warming environment in the restaurant makes me and my partner relief! Their pasta, especially Pasta Da Vinchi is fabulous! It has the taste which you will never get tired of. The sauce and the ingredients also put the pasta to a better space! This is a recommended restaurant for any occasion! Definitely try their cheesecakes out to!"
Sabrina L.,"Columbus, OH",68,289,24,3.0,7/29/2010,"The first time I tried the Cheesecake Factory I ordered something called the California Guacamole and Brie melt and it was life-changing.  Hand to heaven it was one of the best foods I've ever tried in my life.  And then they got rid of it.  So Cheesecake Factory and I stopped being friends. But it's one of those breakups, where we still run into each other now and then.  Inevitably someone from back home will be coming to Columbus and insist we eat there and I'll smile and agree, and enjoy the complimentary bread, which is really quite good, but then I'll take one look at the menu and remember why the Cheesecake Factory and I are no longer on speaking terms. For such a long menu, they have very little that appeals to me.  I eat meat, but only when I'm sure of the quality, and since I'm not sure of it at CF that leaves me with the veggie options, and the veggie options get no love from me. The cheesecake is good, the waits are annoying, and a visit once a year seems like enough.  I'm giving them three stars for the bread and the dessert, but everything in between is meh at best."
Lisa k.,"Lewis Center, OH",10,19,,1.0,10/7/2012,Quoted 30 minutes waited 45-50 minutes.  Seated and greeted. Order app and meal.  Food took FOREVR! Our food came out before kids. Husband food cold. Ordered cheesecake and after 25 min waiting for it finally got up to find a manager. 3 hrs later we were finally out of there.
Darryl K.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,170,47,3.0,10/11/2014,"Nice setting, waiter was friendly. Wait was over 1.2hrs to seat. Food took another hour to arrive. Food quality was average. (Had a lone burger and enchilada). Honestly is it worth the wait? No"
David L.,"Boston, MA",116,981,840,3.0,7/30/2010,"Taste: 3 Value: 5 Service: 4 Since it was the pre-anniversary and they had a special, I decided to drop here after eating at Brio. Huge mistake. I was completely full after Brio, and I was so stuffed after eating a slice of cheesecake it almost hurt to walk around. Interestingly enough, this was actually my first time at a Cheesecake Factory chain. Quality-wise, it's pretty good. I ordered the Fresh Strawberry, which came with a ton of whipped cream and 3-4 strawberries. However, I wasn't amazed by it, hence no 4-star rating. They also took nearly 10 minutes to find a seat for me, even though it was just for one. Afterwards, I felt a bit guilty dropping in for just cheesecake, so I gave my waitress a nice tip."
Rita J.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,2.0,1/18/2015,"Went to CCF yesterday with 4 other friends for lunch. Ordered an item that came with soup and salad. They only had one soup option, which I found to be odd. Then when I got home, the strawberry cheesecake that I got to go and paid 7.95 for was just a sliver... not at all worth that price. IF I ever go back to CCF, I will not order the cheesecake. Though it was good, not worth the price for such a small slice."
