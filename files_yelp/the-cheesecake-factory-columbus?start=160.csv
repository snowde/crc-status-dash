Anqi Y.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,5.0,11/23/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Because almost every dish have a good flavor and the amount of the food is really large. I love the brown bread before the dinner, which is very soft and savory. However,  the serve speed is not so good. Maybe there are too many big fans every day and the restaurant is always loud and full of people. But, it's worth to try the famous cheesecake. The cheese is vey light and not greasy. I'd like to eat one there and take off another."

Cheryl H.,"Columbus, OH",984,288,101,4.0,3/14/2010,"I felt morally obligated to update this review because of a change in my diet. In my previous review, I described the world's most amazing sandwich, known as the Navajo. -  Warm, crunchy fry bread. Perfectly ripened avocado. Grilled chicken. Lettuce. Tomato. Herb mayo. Served with amazing french fries, and the most incredibly rich ranch dressing to dunk them in. Well... I don't eat MEAT anymore, so when I was at Cheesecake Factory the other day, it physically pained me to know that I couldn't eat this sandwich. I made a last-minute decision when the waitress arrived back at our table - I asked for the Navajo, with no chicken, and added swiss cheese and mushrooms (and the obligatory side of ranch.) She only hesitated for a fraction of a second at me ordering a chicken sandwich sans chicken, then smiled and said ""Of course!""  When my Navajo came out, it was PACKED with veggies so that it was just as fulfilling as if it had chicken. And, if possible... even better than I remembered it. :)"
Barry S.,"Columbus, OH",1,14,,3.0,6/3/2010,"I've eaten in house a few times, but mostly takeout.. just for the reason that it was so packed that I didn't want to wait 2 hours for a table. This is just one of those restaurants that reviews really don't matter because people will go there anyway..  They'll go just for the sake of going because it's the Cheesecake Factory.  There's nothing wrong with that- CF has built such a reputation that they have become ""review-proof"" in a way.  The service is decent, but it's clearly obvious that the servers make their money on quantity, not quality- a direct opposition from the Fish Market.. CF service has the turn em and burn em approach and it's sad.  There menu is such a novel that it would be hard to find something even the pickiest eater didn't like.   At CF, it's easy to make an appetizer a meal because the portions are huge...  beyond huge. The price is definitely in line with the portion sizes.  Their takeout leaves a little to be desired, but it's not the food-  it's the accuracy..."
Heidi H.,"Phoenix, AZ",278,102,226,3.0,3/16/2012,"I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factories.  Unfortunately this location is packed on weekends.  We got to experience a 2 hour wait for a table.  Totally crazy, but since we were from out of town and with a group we were patient.  As always, food comes in large portions. FYI gratuity automatically added on with larger groups."
Garrett B.,"Huntington, WV",106,66,14,2.0,8/27/2011,"Whatever. Too any choices on the menu (do something good and stick to that, not try and have it all), too expensive, so-so service, why go? Ugh."
Dennis L.,"Columbus, OH",29,184,,3.0,7/29/2010,"Why is this restaurant always crowded?  I'm having difficulty thinking of a time I ate here or even walked past when the lobby wasn't packed shoulder-to-shoulder with people, spilling out onto the patio.  Sometimes you even have to get on a waiting list for a beeper!  People wait hours to eat here.  I don't get it.  I mean, the food is quite good, much better than average for a national chain, but it's not THAT good.  And waiting in that lobby is stressful.  There's a constant stream of servers running back and forth from the dining room to the case the holds the cheesecake, and there are very few places to sit.  They need to have a dedicated waiting room here, like a doctor's office. I also hate the portion sizes here.  When you get a ""lunch-sized"" salad for your meal, and you eat until you're stuffed and the bowl is still three-quarters full, it's too much.  The serving sizes are big at many chain restaurants, but here they're out of control.  It's like the poster child for American gluttony. All that said, the food here really is quite good.  With a name like Cheesecake Factory, your cheesecake better be awesome, and it is (you ever wonder why almost nothing at Olive Garden contains olives?).  I always settle on the banana cream, and it's good enough to daydream about.  As for entrees, I've never had anything I disliked.  The best thing I've ever had here is the pizza with goat cheese and roasted veggies.  It's very, very rare I order vegetarian dishes, but the description was so mouth-watering, I had to try it.  I don't know if they still serve cole slaw, but I hope so, because it's the only restaurant cole slaw I've ever liked in my life... made with crisp, fresh cabbage and a light dressing. I just wish you could eat here without wasting an hour of your life standing around."
Grace O.,"Palatine, IL",17,30,7,4.0,8/3/2012,"This place is great! If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory you have to go, it's an important life experience. The one in Easton is very nice. The decorations are kind of Egyptian meets Aztec-ish. The wait time varies. In the evenings on weekends, when Easton is packed, there is usually a 2 hour wait (and they do not take reservations). But if you go on off hours there is hardly any wait at all. The service can be either amazing or disappointing depending on how busy they are. But never mind the service, the food is always amazing! My favorite entree is the Teriyaki Chicken (which comes with grilled pineapple and bananas on the side - Yum). The Cheescake menu spans 2 pages and there are so many different types. But my favorite deserts on the menu are the Tiramisu and Original Cheesecake w/cherry topping."
Tiffany E.,"Bedford, OH",9,15,6,1.0,6/17/2012,My food appeared to have been old .. Like sitting from an earlier cancelled order or something :( everyone else at the table liked there food.
Leslie L.,"Dayton, OH",25,173,,3.0,12/29/2011,"Just like every other Cheesecake Factory. Food was good. Service was good. The place was packed, but the wait wasn't too terrible."
Dan C.,"Chicago, IL",0,39,,1.0,9/3/2011,Only go here for the cheesecake.  The actual food is blah-boring and greasy/salty/etc...
Travis Z.,"Columbia, SC",152,182,54,4.0,11/14/2011,Love the portions and the variety in the menu.  Service is always top-notch and food is good as well.  Each plate will last you 2-3 meals which is nice to take home for leftovers.
Simone D.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,55,12,2.0,3/29/2011,"So my reason for going to Cheesecake Factory was because I needed a kid friendly restaurant. I knew that they had a kids menu so I was thrilled to go here and then shop afterwards. I'm a fan of the huge menu they have. There are so many options. The strawberry lemonade I had, was amazing. That's where my good experience ended for the most part.  I ordered the grilled chicken and fries for my 4 year old. I couldn't decide what I wanted so the rest of my party(3 others) ordered first and then about 10 minutes later I put in my order. First off when we were going over the menu I was asking the waitress what was good. She had said something was good but she compared it to chicken parmesan and I made it very clear that I didn't like chicken parmesan. So I asked her between two other things on the menu. She told me to go with the Chicken Bellagio I believe it was. Now I could be wrong but when I looked at the menu I didn't gather it was going to be exactly like chicken parmesan with a different sauce. So the fact that I stated I didn't like that and then she offered it, she wasn't paying too close attention. I'm not sure if she was interested in getting us in and out because she made the comment that she was almost off work so she was anxious which makes me uneasy because I feel like I'm intruding almost. Anyways, my order comes out first. I understand one order would come out quicker than 3, but if you have children you can understand that having your food come out and not theirs makes things difficult.  The other items come out. Back to the grilled chicken. It was under-cooked!! I couldn't believe it. I cut it all up and as I'm looking at it, it's PINK! As any parent could be surprised, I was floored. Especially to be at Cheesecake Factory and have a small mishap like that. I was thinking maybe it was my eyes, so I tasted it. I definitely had to use my napkin after the first taste because I could tell it was not fully cooked! I told my waitress and she apologized. Then the manager came by and apologized, put another piece of chicken on the grill for me. Then another manager came by and dropped the chicken off made sure it was okay. Offered me another meal for myself since he could tell I wasn't liking it, but I declined. My mother LOVES Cheesecake Factory so she appreciated the meal! They ended up taking the kids meal off the bill which was very nice but in the same sense, under-cooked chicken is unacceptable. So for the most part the staff was very friendly and helpful but they seemed ""too busy"" to really care. It was 3 PM when I went so they could have made their concern seem a little more genuine. Don't think I'll be going back here."
Jaclyn K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",2,4,,4.0,4/27/2011,"I had a nice experience here. 4 stars for: 1) Very friendly (but not annoying) workers!  I believe everyone on staff said ""Welcome,"" ""Good Afternoon,"" or ""Have a good day!"" 2) Accomodating waitress.  I got the raspberry lemonade- which is possibly my favorite drink in the world- and it was never even close to being empty- plus the sugar sprinkled along the rim of the glass (which is part of the drink's appeal for me) was always there. The waitress was also very kind and friendly but NOT fake. 3) The food was awesome It was flavorful, delicious and piping hot (when appropriate). I left happily full. I'll rarely say no if someone suggests eating at the cheesecake factory.   4) Fast service I was there on a weekday afternoon and the place was fairly crowded with lunch-ers, yet everything came out to the table so quickly, the thought crossed my mind that maybe they had some wizards working back in the kitchen.... Overall a very pleasant experience. I would not be opposed to a repeat meal."
Reeya W.,"Columbus, OH",3,1,,4.0,12/1/2013,"It is really nice. Not only the cheese cake but also the curry food. I love it! The second reason I love it is because of the location. It is in the heart of Easton. After shopping, we can have a good meal. But, there are always many people. I need wait long time."
Heather G.,"New Albany, OH",38,128,24,3.0,12/30/2010,"Why is this place always busy? There is always a wait. I guess the tourists that flock to Easton must love it. Me? Not so much. The food is good, but overpriced and not really worth the wait. The portions are ridiculously huge and so is the menu. This means everyone can find something and you have lunch for the next day. The service is usually underwhelming. I usually go for a pasta dish or salad. In the summer they had delicious fried zucchini. The cheesecake, of course doesn't disappoint."
Jessica S.,"Columbus, OH",7,23,,2.0,5/27/2011,Awesome cheesecake. Way overpriced for cheesecake and the food. The seating is cramped. Your table spills into the other tables. You might as well be dining with strangers because they are so close to you that their elbows touch yours when you eat. The service is slow and there is always a wait for a table.
Meredith M.,"Columbus, OH",66,239,9,4.0,5/12/2008,"While the wait was over an hour saturday evening the meal was worth the wait.  What I enjoy most about CF is that there is something on the menu for everyone.   I had the Petit Filet and it was very tender and cooked perfectly.  My father really liked his fish tacos, my husband was disappointed in the Ahi Tuna, but realized he shouldn't have expected sushi grade at this restaurant.  My Aunt loved the Factory Chopped Salad, which is my usual...best salad on the menu - page 9. My Passion Fruit Mojitos were not too strong, and not too weak.  Our server was excellent and as busy as it was he took the time to answer all of our questions, make great suggestions, and keep our glasses filled.   This is an excellent choice if going out with a large group or people with varying tastes.  And don't forget to order the cheesecake, it is really good.  The strawberry is my favorite, my parents love the Chocolate Mousse.   I've also ordered their cheesecakes online for birthdays and they arrive fresh!"
Brad T.,"Austin, TX",0,10,,3.0,10/5/2013,"The food is fantastic! Our service was very good as well (at least from the server). Getting a drink at the bar took 20 minutes though, and they weren't overly busy. Bartender paid attention only to the people sitting at the bar and didn't acknowledge those waiting for drinks who couldn't sit.  This restaurant is very busy all the time and our ""40 minute"" wait time ended up being about 60 minutes. This is a good place to eat during off-peak times."
Tasha A.,"Decatur, GA",51,186,32,4.0,12/7/2008,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, in Columbus, in Atlanta, and in any other city that I've been too lol.   I love the versatility of the menu!  I'm world's pickiest eater & seriously, they offer a little something for everyone! As long as they continue to serve good food and for the most part have good customer service, I'll continue to be a Cheesecake Factory fan!"
