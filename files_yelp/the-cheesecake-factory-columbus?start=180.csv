Seth D.,"Columbus, OH",315,313,26,3.0,11/15/2010,"Holy crap, why are so many people willing to shell out big bucks for this place? Look, if someone else was paying, I would enjoy  it, but I went with a large gift card and still payed a lot. The food is good, and so is the service, but come on, nothing daring is going on here, it's a chain!"
Tracy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",162,445,123,4.0,4/16/2007,"OK, it seems like you have seem one Cheesecake Factory you have seem them all.  The interior may be different, but the concept is the same.  My experience with this part of the chain was to help my very pregnant friend satisfy a craving.  We (her husband and I) ran in, waited in line, placed our order and got back to the car in 5 minutes.  Yeah!!! for the Low Carb Cheesecake with Strawberries and Bananas.  (Did I really say yeah for Bananas???? I guess that shows how much I treasure my friend, that I even cheer for bananas when they satisfy my friend's cravings.) It was very easy to order desert for take out.   Kudos to the staff for great service!!!"
Liz M.,"Columbus, OH",554,605,208,3.0,6/21/2010,"Cheesecake Factory isn't a favorite of mine, but somehow I end up going there about 5 or 6 times a year. I don't complian. It's always a decent experience. This is how it goes down. There's always an annoying wait evern if it's 3PM on Friday or 10PM on Saturday, and fuggedaboudit during peak times. So, anyway, you're waiting and people are everywhere, not dressed appropriately for dinner, carrying shopping bags and pushing strollers. That's Easton for ya! Then your name gets called and you're so excited! The seating is meant to get as many people in as possible which takes away from the ambiance, but you get over it when you get your bread (eat the brown kind) and then order drinks. Their mixed drinks are THE BEST! Whoever is their bartender, they should get 5 stars! Anyway, you go through the HUGE menu, pick something that sounds good, you get the huge plate of food. It is pretty good. You can't finish, you may or may not get cheesecake to-go. You get the bill and are shocked at how much you've spent. Pay and tip for the attentive service and try to rush out through the crowded hostess coral. That's was a nice time, wasn't it?"
Lindsey N.,"Columbus, OH",6,4,11,4.0,12/9/2010,I like this place for dinner with the in-laws there is something for everyone on the 20 page menu. It does get crowded around dinner so get your name on the list early!
Kevin M.,"Washington, DC",24,201,1,3.0,5/23/2008,"I'll jump on the ""meh, Cheesecake Factory"" bandwagon.  I've always found the food to be very satisfying, once I navigated through the huge menu.  The prices are a little high and the portions are huge, however, which means it's best if you plan from the start to take half of your food home. Of course, even after half a meal here, you might not be able to fit the cheesecake in your belly.  But odds are you'll order it anyway, and it'll be delicious.  The pieces are also quite large, however, so it's best to share them.  In other words, everything at this restaurant is twice as big as it should be. So, yeah, I like the food fine, but as others have said the place is huge and loud and frequently has an hour wait.  I'd sooner go almost anywhere else at Easton - Restaurant Hama and Cafe Istanbul in particular are both very good and far, far less populated than Cheesecake Factory, PF Chang's, or California Pizza Kitchen usually are."
Beth H.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,,3.0,2/4/2011,Extensive menu. Portions are way too big but that's not a bad thing if you like leftovers for two nights like I do. The food is above quality bar and grill fare. Not very many low-fat options but I generally don't go out to eat for low-fat meals as I eat enough of those at home.
Lindsey T.,"Zanesville, OH",0,30,,5.0,3/11/2012,"The food is excellent, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the service is always much greater than the service I get at other chain restaurants. I have been here about five or more times and each time it has been awesome."
Karen W.,"Columbus, OH",51,419,148,5.0,8/21/2011,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory and overall, it should get more than 5 stars. What a great place to come to for dinner. They have an extensive menu and you could pretty much find a little bit of everything on there from mexican to italian to good 'ol American food. We arrived last night (Saturday night) around 6 pm and we only had to wait 20 minutes for our table. We were seated quickly and the waitress was great. I asked her what she recommended, which was the Chicken Midiera. Yum with a capital Y! We also chose to get a piece of cheesecake. Unfortunately the Oreo cheesecake had been sold out already. (boo!), but we ended up having the chocolate mousse cheesecake. Yeah, didnt think there was any room for cheesecake, but there was!! Overall the atmosphere was pleasing and very nice. It almost felt like we were out of town on vacation to a nice casual restaurant. We'll definitely be going there again soon!"
F Z.,"Columbus, OH",510,372,442,1.0,5/22/2008,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, Thank you for the chopped-up caterpillar--that was still wiggling nonetheless--the last time I ordered your Luau Salad. The fact that Twin discovered it as he was finishing up the salad for me was not at all comforting; it only led us to question ourselves as to who ate the other half of the caterpillar. Me or him? It's a great appetite killer, I tell ya. So yes, CF, I am now scarred for life and will never ever order salads anywhere else. I realize that such insects are easily overlooked in green salad leaves and the like, but having one of them on display in my dish (and quite possibly moving its way to my stomach) is one hell of a different story... and a revolting one for that matter. I have not been back ever since and will have to find other ways to satisfy my white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake cravings. Sadness. Sincerely, A Former Faithful Customer"
Trent C.,"Chicago, IL",11,194,19,2.0,8/18/2010,"I'm not a huge Cheesecake Factory fan but this one was bad even for me.  The service is painfully slow and the servers have an attitude every time.  Food is decent but nothing fantastic.  Best thing is the cheesecake, as you would expect, but even that is not mind-blowing."
Emily A.,"Columbus, OH",81,68,,2.0,5/23/2008,"Personal biases of mine that impact my review of this restaurant: I try to avoid Easton like the plague. I'm a vegetarian. I prefer small cozy restaurants to giant amusement park sized establishments. I've eaten at CF once in my life, and I doubt I'll ever go back.  Some friends of mine invited me one Friday evening last summer, so I sucked up my courage and braved the traffic and drove out to Easton.  Found parking with no more than normal difficulty, and successfully navigated the mazelike restaurant to the table where my friends were seated.  The free bread was quite tasty, so things got off to a good start.  The service must have been fine because I don't remember anything particular about it.  We ordered drinks, which were very expensive and not all that strong, though tasty.  Those things, and the cheesecake itself, were the plusses.  On the minus side: the menu was gigantic and not vegetarian-friendly.  I tend to find large menus, like large restaurants, a bit overwhelming.  I ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich which sounded like a manageable veggie dinner to eat and still have room for cheesecake.  Not so much!  I ended up with a huge pile of fries surrounding what seemed like a loaf of greasy bread filled with eggplant, red peppers, and a half a pound of cheese.  It was the greasiest, messiest, most unmanageable ""sandwich"" I've ever seen.  I think I ate a third of the sandwich, half the fries, and of course a slice of cheesecake, and consumed more fat than I'd had all week.  Yuck!  The restaurant was very loud and crowded, and, like I said earlier, had all the ambience of a theme park. Two stars - one for the cheesecake, one for the free bread and fancy drinks.  Nothing for the food or the atmosphere.  But maybe that's just me."
Trevor B.,"Grove City, OH",0,1,,2.0,12/4/2012,"My wife and I have been searching for a place that offers the classic Eggs Benedict.  Since The Cheesecake Factory offers this item on their Sunday Brunch menu, we decided to give it a try on 12/2/2012.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  My wife ordered French Toast and bacon, and I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Canadian Bacon and Hollandaise sauce.  After an extremely long wait for our food to arrive (it wasn't crowded or busy at 10 AM), my wife was presented with her French Toast, but no bacon.  Apparently, the bacon was not ready.  The worst offense was my Eggs Benedict was presented with a greasy and broken Hollandaise sauce.  When our waitress came back to ask if everything was okay, I informed her that my dish had to go back to the kitchen.  She didn't ask why, and picked it up and returned to the kitchen.  I did overhear her saying the sauce was broken, so at least our waitress knew the dish was unacceptable.  What I can't fathom is why the kitchen would send such a disaster out to the table in the first place.  The second attempt was no better than the first.  The sauce was again broken.  Apparently, there was no chef working that had passed basic sauces at culinary school.  Now here is the absolute worst offense.  As I had been craving Eggs Benedict, I decided to eat the second dish as I was also hungry and didn't want to waste further time having them fix me something else.  During my meal, I was presented with a flour-thickened Hollandaise sauce.  That should have been criminal!  It isn't called Hollandaise GRAVY, it's supposed to be an emulsification!  That had to be the worst offense from the kitchen.  Needless to say, the manager did remove the Eggs Benedict from the check - I wouldn't have paid for it anyway.  The service was good. The waitress was sympathetic.  The transgressions on the kitchen were unforgivable.  We had been past fans of The Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience, we won't be going back.  I cannot suffer a kitchen that just doesn't care about the quality of the food they are producing."
Gavin C.,"Westerville, OH",0,6,,4.0,6/23/2009,"No matter what you're in the mood for, they're going to have a large portion and it's going to taste great!  Drinks are over-priced but it's a great place for dinner."
