Alexander S.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,,4.0,5/22/2017,Another good place to enjoy variety and quality of food.  It does get crowded and wait time varies it can be up to 20 minutes or more but I assure you it is all worth it.  Friendly staff huge menu loaded with delicious food order anything it is a win win you will be walking out with a happy face:-) . Make sure you are starving when you want to get there because they are quite generous in food portion :-)
Marya C.,"Victorian Village, Columbus, OH",3,35,16,1.0,5/7/2017,Was this for real? I went with my two daughters for a Sunday brunch. I ordered a black coffee for myself and water for the table. Later I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes to split with my daughter and another kids' French toast. When the food came 30 minutes later we noticed the food tasted like coffee. Both of the small metal carafes that were supposed to be filled with syrup were filled with black coffee instead! Needless to say both of our meals were ruined when we poured coffee over our food. When I told the waiter about the problem he said that I ordered it that way. What??? I have never even heard of pouring coffee over lemon pancakes let alone ordering coffee to pour over my 11 year old's French toast. The manager at first was going to comp us for only one meal until I had to explain again that both meals were ruined. I wish we were more patient and had waited in the line at North Star. There is a reason their line is out the door and not at Cheesecake.
Jamecia L.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,1,1.0,6/5/2017,"Usually this is a decent place, but the service was horrible! They were out of food at 12p on a Monday! Someone in the party upcharged on their drink refill & they charged for both. This customer didn't even eat!!! The manager Brittany drug a napkin through someone's plate & laughed about. Epic fail today!"
Mary C.,"Columbus, OH",0,3,,3.0,10/30/2017,"Ordered a cheesecake on Friday night to pick up Monday at 5:00. I think that's a fair notice. I left work early to pick it up and it wasn't ready- which ended up being fine since they had extra in the back. I also ordered a chocolate block on the side to read ""happy birthday brian"". I kid you not it took the red headed baker 30 minutes to write on it. She had one that would have been fine. It was sloppy but I would have taken it. But no, she wiped the writing off and started over. I only put 20 minutes in my meter thinking I'd be in and out to pick up my order. So I told them I had to pay my meter and I'd be back. I came back and she was starting over on a whole new chocolate block. I mean come on. So I waited another 10 minutes and then said ""look forget about the chocolate block"". Took my cake and left. I'm pretty upset actually. I paid for that block and tipped the bakers before any of this and I 100% regret it. It'd be one thing if hey were just running behind schedule but if the new girl takes more than 4 attempts at writing ""happy birthday brian"" on a block then for the love of god take pity on the customer and help her out. Wasted money. The cake was fine but I won't be coming back to that location again."
Lucy L.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,2.0,3/6/2017,"I've been to at least 20 different Cheesecake Factories across the country since I travel a lot for work, and this is hands down the worst one. I honestly didn't think the food and service could be so different, but wow, the food was almost inedible. I always order the same things - miso salmon, dynamite shrimp and carrot cake. The salmon and miso sauce were literally disgusting. Not even sure what I was eating and pray I don't get sick later tonight. The dynamite shrimp was far from dynamite. I just left there and am so disappointed to have to write this terrible review, but THE FOOD WAS AWFUL. I come to Columbus a few times a month and will never dine here again. There are much better options at Easton."
Pete R.,"Cardington, OH",4,4,,2.0,3/6/2017,"Visited on March 5th. A nice weather day, Easton and the  resteraunt were both very busy. I submitted my name for the 20 minutes wait. Went to the bar and ordered a Kentucky mule,a bourbon drink. The drink was 10$ it tasted terrible, worse I've ever had, I paid with a hundred dollar bill, and was given my change in one's and fives. When we got our booth, the waiter was rushing back and forth, was definitely not interested in spending time with us. The entire visit we were made to feel as though we were in the way. This used to be a great place to go. And it may still be, just not on Sunday March 5th 2017. As expensive as this place is, service should be better.. This was probably our last visit. Too many other options in cbus"
Barbara V.,"Granger, IN",0,47,7,3.0,8/8/2017,Great food but service was extremely slow.  We waited 15 minutes to order and another hour to get our food- 3 salads and 5 kids meals.  No explanation or apology for slow service.
Akisha T.,"Chattanooga, TN",1,9,7,5.0,7/4/2016,My favorite restaurant in the world...lol I always enjoy the food here and this time in OH wasn't any different. This time I had Philly cheesesteak and it was just as good the next day we I reheated it. Waiter was a bit slow but hey it what it is.
Candace M.,"Spokane, WA",275,671,1126,5.0,6/1/2014,"Went here during the day while my tire was getting fixed nearby. Had a great lunch! I ordered the grilled artichoke and beet and goat cheese salad. The grilled artichoke was absolutely superb. Cooked perfectly and with a dipping sauce that still makes m mouth water at the thought of it! I realize that I could probably (I mean, maybe...) grill an artichoke myself, but Cheesecake Factory has made it an art form! The salad was good too. My companion and I split a mimosa which was also great. I prefer the ambiance of this location to the one I'm used to in Cleveland, which is a lot darker. This one was more well-lit, bigger, and more interesting in general.  If I want a grilled artichoke again (which, honestly, is all the time) I will be back to the Cheesecake Factory!"
Emily P.,"Barboursville, WV",60,23,1,4.0,1/22/2017,"This location is always very crowded. With that being said, the Cheesecake is amazing. My favorite on the menu is the bang bang chicken and shrimp. Tastes like curry, which I love. Can't really go wrong here, unless you're in a hurry"
Nancy A.,"Kalamazoo, MI",46,5,4,4.0,11/17/2015,"Very quick to get seated for two.   Noise level is higher than I prefer but tolerable.  I had a glass of wine and water within 10 minutes.   Very impressed. Very dark, bring a flashlight if you have poor eyesight. I orderes the Thai Glazed Salmon and it was absolutely wonderful.  So large a portion that I brought half my meal plus a slice of cheesecake home. I would definitely recommend this location.  Just be prepared to walk after you find parking, wait a while to be seated and get cozy with the table next to you."
Annie L.,"Powell, OH",0,10,4,1.0,3/12/2017,"we've been waiting for your food for over an hour! didn't have to wait to be seated. Ordered an appetizer for my entree and took 20 minutes to get after everyone received their food. Beyond disappointed, management did not even care."
James B.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2017,"Not one to write reviews (for anything) but felt compelled to write this one. Came at 4:15 today and was asked to wait 15 min with a wide open restaurant. We literally passed empty booth after empty booth while walking to our seats ... Upon arrival, our booth was layered with crumbs and our dish ware was stained and crusted. We were so disgusted that we looked at each other and without saying anything just walked out. Thanks for taking 20 min of my Friday evening and reminding me why I hate corporate restaurants. Please fail soon"
Stacy O.,"Northbrook, IL",113,378,25,3.0,5/6/2015,"Everything about our experience here was toeing the line of a disaster. We were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait, but were then seated within 3 minutes. The host staff clearly have some work to do on estimating wait times. Though, I suppose it's better to under promise and then over deliver. Our server seemed to think we needed the entire evening to read the menu since he made himself too scarce after taking our beverage order. He (or the kitchen?) managed to screw up almost order -- my brother's sweet potato fries ""fell off"" the plate on the way to the table and then they forgot to bring more; my salad came with the dressing on it instead of on the side; my nephew's hot fudge sundae showed up without hot fudge. I know why people like this -- fake upscale with huge portions -- but I'd skip it in favor of a local Columbus establishment any day."
Mary C.,"Lansing, MI",9,56,140,4.0,4/13/2016,"The Corn fritter platter was outstanding the taste is extremely authentic and it's quite large it was amazing home cooked meal feel , the chicken tacos from the skinny menu are wrapped in lettuce and have avocado chicken and veggies inside , they  were great and healthy ! Finally the dulce de leche cheesecake was ridiculously great SO good! For a chain restaurant this place has my vote !"
Kaoru M.,"Northwest, Columbus, OH",100,262,339,1.0,3/6/2016,"We had a friend who really wanted to have her birthday dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. So against our better judgement, we signed up for a large group dinner at a restaurant that doesn't accept reservations. Knowing that there will be a wait, we arrived well ahead of the group at 4:30 to put our name in for our 12-person table. We were advised that a large group had just sat down at 4:30 so that it will be a 2 hour wait. Apparently they designate one specific set of seats at this restaurant for large groups, so we had the wait for the group before us to leave.  Never mind that this is a huge restaurant and could have placed us elsewhere if they'd actually tried. We literally saw over a 100 people seated before us after all. Unfortunately for us, the large group that they allowed to seat before us at the only table we were allowed to sit at was not a complete party, and it apparently took them an hour to even order since not everyone had arrived when they seated this group ahead of us.  So we waited and waited and waited. For 3 hours in the end. It could've been 2.5 hrs but they didn't want to hurry the group occupying our table apparently... Which is fair except the birthday girl went to check on our table and found 2 out of 12 table remaining, just texting on their phones. I know you don't kick people out of their seats at a restaurant usually, but come on! The manager comped us some appetizers, which was nice of him. But 3 hours of my weekend to me is worth a little more than free nachos and chicken tenders.  And the final zinger? The birthday girl ordered a veggie burger and they were out. Sigh..."
Mary B.,"Columbus, OH",160,200,443,4.0,1/10/2016,"Great American Eatery! Yes, a chain restaurant that beat their rivals. The pages on pages of options appease a lot of appetites. The cheesecake and large portions bring us back time after time. The drawbacks are the high drink prices,  both alcohol and non alcohol drinks and lengthy waits without reservation or call ahead capabilities. The service is prompt, friendly and very knowledgeable. The food is made to order and can be modify based on diet restrictions and/or allergies.  Fact: menus across the nation vary depending on regions to cater to the population. The menu will vary depending on if your in Hawaii, California, Florida, Ohio, etc. Make sure you visit another cheesecake factory to check out the variation. Can't believe it took me so long to review. We adore this restaurant for all of its glory. The changing menu is enough to keep us coming back but the classics will always be there."
Christopher B.,"Gary, IN",33,7,,4.0,11/18/2016,Always good at accommodating big parties. Enjoy going here after church with the family.
Robert B.,"Westerville, OH",104,23,8,4.0,7/3/2016,Food was very good but the cheesecake was to die for I wish that they would have an open view into them making the cheesecakes from beginning to end but they don't. They will customize and make a cheesecake just for you if you pay for it and trust me you'll pay for it. Prices are a little above reasonable prices but it is worth it beautiful atmosphere and good drinks. I will be coming back again just not want it so busy which it always seems to be
Eric M.,"New Albany, OH",8,9,4,1.0,11/6/2016,"The service here is beyond poor. Trying to leave, let alone get food is unbelievably slow. If you don't have an entire afternoon to devote to mediocre food, go somewhere else."
