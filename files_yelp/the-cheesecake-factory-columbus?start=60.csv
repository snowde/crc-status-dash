Colleen G.,"Baltimore, OH",0,6,,5.0,11/4/2016,"When ever I want to treat myself or someone in my family to a great dinner out we go to the Cheesecake Factory! I'm amazed that they can offer such an extensive menu and everything I've ever gotten there has been wonderful. We always get cheesecake for dessert and I've learned when in doubt, get the Godiva! It's a 40 minute drive for us but so worth it."
Jon A.,"Galion, OH",117,113,277,3.0,11/15/2015,"Had the fried chicken sliders which were the best chicken sandwiches any of us have ever had - total perfection.  I also had mac and cheese which was just good - nothing overly impressive.  My wife had chicken and mushroom wraps and did not care for them much due to an undesirable aftertaste.  My daughter had a grilled chicken salad which she must of liked as she finished most of it. Our biggest problem wasn't the food but was the location of our table.  We were sandwiched in between two tables of people and there was zero privacy.  When the waitress would wait on either of the tables to the left or right of us, her butt was way too close to me - very uncomfortable.  The second issue was the noise level.  I hate being stressed out when I'm eating.  I'm stressed out enough at my job and don't have the desire to deal with more stress when I'm trying to relax in my limited time off.  Those sliders were damn good, but I don't think I could go through that again.  Maybe next time I'll have a glass of wine before we go so I won't be so stressed.  Do people actually like eating in this type of environment?  I certainly don't get it."
Bethany K.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",90,323,248,4.0,7/23/2013,"I really enjoy this location...  they are open late, but due to their location - in the heart of Easton - they are ALWAYS busy!  It would be SO great if you were able to make a reservation. I have been here several times, and it took a little while to find an entree that I loved.  There are several great appetizers, but again, I had a tough time with my entree... then I found it!  I love, LOVE the Hibachi steak.  The combined spices are phenomenal... They chef manages to get a nice, crisp outer edge while the meat is still tender and flavorful. The Thai lettuce wraps are excellent, and large enough for an entree with left overs, or excellent to share as an appetizer And of course, the cheesecake is awesome... two full pages!"
Justin W.,"Clearfield, PA",1,8,9,1.0,10/6/2016,"Burger wasn't cooked. Came out raw in the middle. Sent it back and when it came back out it was nasty. Instead of making a new burger, they brought out the one I had taken a bite out of. They obviously put it back on the grill to cook it a bit more. Waitress treated me as if I didn't know what I was talking about and gave me a nasty look. She said I had ordered it like that. Not once did I say I wanted it raw in the middle. Fries and cheesecake was the only good thing about my order. The other 3 orders were fine."
Alex M.,"Auburn Hills, MI",21,552,1552,4.0,9/5/2015,"Went in and got a slice of Smores Cheesecake. Took a while just to get a slice with no communication, but boy was it good! Very rich with a good presentation."
Tracy D.,"Northland, Columbus, OH",6,3,,2.0,8/17/2016,"Had dinner here last night celebrating a friend's birthday. Sat us in the very back of the restaurant. Our table was under an air conditioning vent and it was freezing cold. Complained to the waitress who told us the air conditioning was controlled out of state so they couldn't do anything. We all basically ordered appetizers for dinner and it took over a half hour to get our food. I ordered salad and the sausage ricotta Flatbread, brought the Flatbread out before the salad and it was just warm, didn't seem to be cooked all the way. Unfortunately, I was on a time constraints so didn't have time to wait for another. Another girl in the group had to wait 20 min for a refill and her food was also just warm. We only had 5 in our group so not a big amount to wait on. Service very slow. Was not happy at all with this visit."
Doug S.,"Greenfield, OH",0,1,1,2.0,1/31/2017,Went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Greene in Dayton and it was the worst experience. My waitress dumped 5 drinks on me and ran off to the kitchen never came back out to say sorry. The manager moved us to a different table and apologized for her.after all of that all I got was one free piece of cheesecake.
Beci B.,"Bridgeport, OH",20,49,13,1.0,8/4/2015,"I normally love the Cheesecake and always end an evening of Easton shopping by picking my up a few pieces of cheesecake and taking them back to the hotel. However on this particular night I had a takeout piece of Red Velvet. Service was horrific and they kind of threw the cheesecake upside down in the box. Once I settled in at the hotel , I noticed the frosting had an off taste but plowed forward - bad decision. About 4 hours later I was awoken with an uncontrollable need to upchuck which lasted about an hour. I then remember the weird, sour frosting.  No more Cheesecake Factory for me."
Christa R.,"Lancaster, OH",14,9,1,2.0,1/14/2017,"Food was great. The steak diane and shrimp scampi are delicious and well prepared as well as the buffalo bites and stuffed  mushrooms. We were looking forward to drinks, dinner,and cheesecake to celebrate a birthday. After waiting an hour to get seated (no big deal,they were super busy) we had what may be the worst service I've received by Adalina. We ordered appetizers and our meals which were both delivered quickly by the food runners. Our waitress was at our table only when taking our order, when the food was delivered, and when we finally flagged her down 20 minutes after everyone was done eating. One of the guests at our table went his entire meal without anything to drink. We told her he never got his second beer (he had ordered when the food arrived)to which she responded ""Oh okay"" and then proceeded to inform us she had been taking care of a tables order with a food allergy. Apparently it's ok to neglect your other tables if someone is allergic to something. Everyone had planned to order cheesecake but chose not to considering how long it took for Adalina to return to her tables. It took another 10 minutes to get the checks and when they were brought she made sure to inform us she had taken off that second beer you know the one we never received. Really disappointed."
Linda P.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,2.0,1/23/2017,"Horrible brunch! He ordered blueberry pancakes, I ordered a spinach,bacon,mushroom omelet w fruit. Fruit looked and tasted canned and there were only a few pieces in little bowl. Omelet was cold. Mentioned this to server Carla, she took omelet & fruit back. Fruit came back with frozen blueberries dumped over it...gross! He was done with his pancakes by the time I got my 2nd omelet. Had no flavor, totally unseasoned, inedible. Mentioned this to Carla, she said ""sorry!"" and waled away. Rip off for $14.00 meal, never again!"
Creg S.,"Washington Court House, OH",0,13,6,1.0,7/26/2016,"In the afternoon, on a weekday, my wife and I stopped here to eat a late lunch. The place was not busy and we saw that only a few people were outside eating. We decided to ask for outside seating. Even though there were seats galore inside and out, we were told that there would be a 15 minute wait no matter what area we chose. There were a few people ahead of us and were being called.  While waiting, we looked outside and felt like it might rain so we approached the desk to tell them that we would like to change to an inside table.  At that time we were told that our name had already been called. There was absolutely no way we had been called since we had not left the area. Since we had supposedly missed our call, the lady told us that we would then be ""put back into the rotation."" We didn't know what that meant, but soon found out. The next name called was that of a couple who came after us. The next name was another couple after us. We got the idea.  At that point we decided that a table for us could not be found and that our business was not desired.  We got up to walk out and once they saw us leaving, they quickly called our name, but we continued to walk out.  We took a short walk to PF Changs, walked directly in, was immediately waited on and had a great meal. If you want to be told to sit and cool your heals go here, otherwise go somewhere else."
April C.,"Columbus, OH",51,24,10,3.0,6/18/2016,"I ordered a Creamsicle from the bar while waiting for a table outside on the patio by the fire.  It was delicious but since it was  $11,  I only had one.  We were seated, asked for water, and 20 minutes later received water.  We had the firecracker salmon for an appetizer.  It was very delicious.  They brought out my steak before my salad so I sent the salad back.  The steak was very yummy and so were the green beans, even though I ordered broccoli.  Halfway through the meal I had to tell the waiter our drink glasses were empty and he also forgot to give us bread. My bf did not enjoy his chicken  Marsala.  The sauce was very thin.  He said olive garden is so much better.  We also  got a raspberry white chocolate cheesecake to go and they were out of plastic forks. Excellent food.  Very poor service."
Heather M.,"Columbus, OH",2,7,4,1.0,11/11/2015,"I would give 0 stars if I could. Every time we eat here, dine in or carry out, we have an issue. Last time my quesadilla was soggy because the salsa soaked into it. Once we waited over an hour for food when two tables seated after us got there's just fine. This time I'm done. I will never go to this location again. My steak was supposed to be medium well, NOT burnt on the outside. I have two mushrooms and a disgusting pile of salty onions. This is beyond ridiculous and j paid $20 for this!!! - See picture!!!"
Sarah P.,"Columbus, OH",60,313,11,5.0,7/23/2014,"One of my all time favorite restaurants!  I am 100% in love with the Cheesecake Factory, and I am NOT afraid to admit it. 1st up:  APPETIZERS  YAY!!, Ok, so I have only had 1 of their appetizers, but after tasting their chicken quesadilla why would I ever get anything else???  I have been to several Mexican restaurants and have NEVER had one as good as this.  I have even tried to duplicate it at home (to no avail) it's so good.   Next up:  Main Courses!!  Chicken & Biscuits.  So good, so so good.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the super moist chicken, sweet carrots, flaky biscuits and unique gravy.  This dish makes my taste buds sing. This is definitely my favorite entree-period. I have also had their Chicken & Avocado sandwich that comes with french fries.  This sandwich, my friends, is super tasty.  When I first ordered this I was slightly leary of the combination, but don't be hesitant like I was.  Jump into it full force because it is the shiznit. My husband gets their shrimp bistro pasta.  He says it has a great flavor to it and he orders this every time we go.  I CANNOT vouch for this because I will NEVER taste it, because as most of you know you eat with your eyes first and something about this dish just appears unappealing to me and I refuse to put a bite of it anywhere near my mouth.  Sorry, I'm just weird like that. I have tasted their pizza, it's mighty good too.  My kids have gotten their chicken fingers on MANY occasions, and they always gobble them up with a quickness. Their brown bread is soft, and just plain good.  We always ask for all brown bread when we go here because we are not big fans of the harder sourdough bread (they can keep that stuff). Now to my favorite part. What they are known best for...CHEESECAKE!  I have tried so many I don't even know where to start.  I will tell you my absolute favorite is the lemon raspberry one.  It is so light and fluffy and not as heavy as most of the other flavors.  Others I have tried that are fabulous as well are,  Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Ultimate Red Velvet, Oreo (the regular one is good, the chocolate oreo one is gross--tell them no thank you on that one), Chocolate Tuxedo (yuk--avoid this one too), White Chocolate Blueberry, Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, and I am sure there are many other.  All of the cheesecakes I have tasted (other than the ones listed with bad comments beside them) and been wonderful. I would recommend this spot for a friends night out or a family outing.  Either way, you will get good food."
Joshua C.,"Hattiesburg, MS",32,192,257,4.0,5/6/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory always has great food. They have an extensive menu and I have yet to order an item I did not enjoy. The meals/flavors are consistent. Service has always been good in my experience. Portions tend to be too large for a single (normal) person so I'd plan on sharing.  Of course the Cheesecake is what they're really known for and it is delicious. So try to save room. Otherwise, you can always order a slice for carry out."
Susan V.,"Grove City, OH",0,17,10,4.0,6/8/2015,"I'm giving this four stars only because the service was a bit slow, and our daughters' orange chicken entree' that they split wasn't ""orange chicken"" according to them, it wasn't sweet or tangy enough.   Other than that this place is amazing! I ordered a slice of the Godiva chocolate cheesecake that was way off the charts - it was heavenly! I love very rich decadent chocolate...the ""crust"" or whatever was what I believe to be dark chocolate and the middle part like a chocolate mousse (it is flourless), also with a chocolate wafer square on top of it!  It was so rich that my daughter and I had to get a box and there was still 1/4 left which we shared the next day, lol.  My other daughter and her boyfriend ordered the tuxedo cheesecake which they very much enjoyed.  It was my older daughter's birthday so I told the server then about five or six wait staff came out and sang happy birthday with her cheesecake decorated with some sprinkles and a candle in the whipped cream, a very nice festive touch! It was definitely a birthday to remember for her and we most likely will come back next year for her Sweet 16th!"
Jennifer T.,"Westerville, OH",61,136,68,3.0,4/26/2016,"My husband, daughter and I went here the other night. My husband had some gift cards he wanted to use. Typically, we don't come to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. When we were in there, that's what we wanted. Their food is... okay. Their menu is huge, and it's almost as if they are trying to cater to whatever you have a craving for. This makes it a bit hard to choose what you want. I ordered the Shepard's pie - and it was... eh. I have never had Shepard's pie before, but I would definitely say that it's not very authentic. It seemed like it was something that they had thrown together in the kitchen, and topped with Mashed potatoes. The Potatoes were fine, but I wasn't too keen on eating the rest of it.  The waitstaff was pretty good, considering we arrived a half hour before close. The food took a bit longer to come out, and it was whatever for us. The Cheesecake is amazing though! I would definitely recommend coming for Cheesecake, but if you want a meal, go somewhere else."
Nicole B.,"Corona, NY",84,98,71,5.0,3/7/2015,"One word: AMAZING!  My first time going, and LOVED it.  To start off we had the fried calamari which was fantastic. They have really good lemonade and I ordered their jalapeño pineapple margarita they have which was quite interesting.  My date ordered filet mignon, Medium Rare and it was to die for! Melt in your mouth, cooked phenomenally! I ordered the Steak Diana, cooked Medium with Salmon. The Steak was ok. And the salmon was good without the lemon sauce they put underneath. Didn't care for it at all.  Their mashed potato's were way too salty and my date pointed it out to the manager and the manager asked to take them back and we declined just letting him know so he could tell his cooks. The manager then told us he would give us a piece of cheesecake on the house.  We also had a plate of macaroni and cheese which I must say was the best Mac n cheese I've ever had in my life. Order it! You'll thank me later. At the end we ordered a piece of lemon meringue cheesecake and white chocolate chip macadamia nut. Both...... Out of this world. Could be just because I'm a cheesecake fanatic!  I wish I could remember our waiters name cause he was pretty awesome!"
Katherine M.,"Lakeville, MN",40,42,300,1.0,4/16/2016,"Ordered simple spaghetti. They brought out a small plate of noodles with a side of spaghetti sauce that was in a condiment dish? I asked for more sauce, was brought another condiment size marinara sauce that was cold. At this point my noodles are cold and I'm over the whole meal. Asked the waiter to just take it off my bill and bring me the check. This just seems like too easy of a dish to be screwed up this badly."
Matyuk P.,"Galloway, OH",2,1,,4.0,6/22/2016,"There was a bit of a wait, but once we were seated we were served right away. Got the avocado rolls, they we great. Definitely recommend."
