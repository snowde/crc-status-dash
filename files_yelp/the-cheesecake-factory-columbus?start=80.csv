Adam G.,"Hilliard, OH",0,29,,4.0,6/6/2016,"I went to Cheesecake Factory just for dessert.  Though it was very busy, we were able to get a table for two at 9pm on a Saturday night in about 5 minutes.  We already knew exactly what we wanted to order but we had to wait at least 10 minutes for our server to come.   There were many more tempting options than the last time we were there - I ended up getting the smores cheesecake and it was incredible.  There were small chunks of chocolate and a toasted marshmallow on top - a very accurate take on a smore.   Different people tried bringing other tables' dinners to us 2-3 times - one time while we were in the middle of eating our dessert (try and use some common sense).   Overall, the cheesecake is amazing.  The restaurant could benefit from better organization.  I would have just got my cheesecake to go and sat outside by the fountains but it was raining."
Jason S.,"Sarasota, FL",3,35,20,3.0,9/5/2014,"So..I hear they have a HUGE menu?! ;) We stopped to have a piece of cheesecake and a drink. Now, I don't mind paying top $$ for food and/or drink but this caught me off guard. CF is known for their cheesecake and I don't mind paying $7-$8 for it, it's all spectacular. We ordered 2 pieces of Cheesecake, 1 glass of sangria and some fruity drink for the little lady...$38. Which was expected until I noticed the drinks were $10 each?! I am more than happy to pay $10 for their AWESOME cheesecakes but not for watered down desert drinks. But I still love the cheesecake, unfortunately."
Kat M.,"Allegany, NY",77,10,1,1.0,4/16/2016,I waited in line for over 30 minutes just to put my name down on the waiting list. Only to find out that it was a 5 HOUR wait for a party of 8. I NEVER should have needed to wait that long to put our name on the list. There were PLENTY of open tables and the party of 4 in front of me was told 15 minutes yet the manager wouldn't apologize or do anything to accommodate our party. We usually like the restaurant and have been often but we will not return
Chris G.,"Kansas City, MO",244,531,54,3.0,10/29/2013,"What you expect from a Cheesecake Factory is what you get.  The food was actually slightly above average, which was a pleasant surprise.  No surprise on the bill; for one entree, water and dessert the bill was still $25 before tip! High, I think, but oh well. Service was good."
Kim N.,"Cridersville, OH",10,91,74,4.0,7/12/2015,Bang Bang Chicken! Yummy! Hubby enjoyed his Hibachi Steak as well! Very busy! Waiter was disappointing... never came back for refills. Nice Easton location! Beautiful decor.
Beth M.,"Columbus, OH",164,86,72,3.0,4/4/2015,"Great location.  Size is a little small when it comes to the wait.  I have had to wait outside during the winter because there was no more room on the inside.  Great food, large portions.  Always stick with the classic cheesecake."
Tracey B.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",1,22,3,4.0,4/9/2016,"Went for happy hour,  the J.W. lemonade was great,  and the variety of appetizers are delicious especially the sweet corn tamales,  yummo! Had the salted carmel cheesecake wasn't at all salted carmel, they should just say carmel cheesecake,  but was so happy that the waitress gave me extra carmel, Fun time all the way around."
K C.,"Grove City, OH",0,37,,5.0,11/7/2016,"Best cheesecake ever!  Good food, but a bit pricey!  The best thing is their cheesecake and the many different flavors of cheesecake!  Best cheesecake in the world!  I personally love the plain cheesecake with fruit on top but the other kinds are also delicious!!!"
Johnny G.,"Blacklick, OH",5,58,5,4.0,3/12/2015,"Got lucky to find two seats right away at the bar for dinner with my wife. Overall a great experience. Drinks were sizable and tasty and served quickly as was our food and all refills thanks to Matthew. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was well prepared and served around a giant mound of rice - plenty enough to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. My go-to Veggie Burger with an excellent side salad hit the spot as usual. It falls apart a little too easily but is just as delicious when eaten with a fork and knife. It's even better when I add mustard or hot sauce. It may not always be worth the long wait (1 hour or more) but it consistently makes for a great experience, especially when the entire family goes and has so many options."
Tim H.,"Columbus, OH",28,12,,2.0,5/26/2015,"Excited to see that they take reservations for parties of 7 or more...  ...LESS exited to find out that it's only before 4pm.   I was trying to book ahead of time for a party of ten, on a Wednesday, for a special event where I'll have older family members in town.  I had hoped to be able to bring them in and sit down.  Why take reservations at all? This is a review based on company policy... not based on food."
Tom P.,"Columbus, OH",0,21,40,5.0,3/30/2016,"Been here several times and have had very good experiences. Our waiter Sean is awesome, always making solid recommendations and even highlighting good local spots to check out. We once had an issue where two of our free cheesecake coupons came back as invalid for some reason. The manager Brian waived it and comped us two cheesecakes without any challenge."
Kenneth H.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,2.0,12/23/2014,"I've eaten at cheesecake factory many times over the years and this restaurant about 6.    I have to say this was by far the worst service I have ever had at ccf.   The server seemed annoyed by us from the start.   The restaurant wasn't that busy even though it is close to Christmas. We were there at an off peak time.    Our food arrived at a reasonable time except for one meal.   It took another 7 minutes for the last meal to arrive. I swear they must have dropped it or forgot it (it was the lunch portion of the full meal I had. Go figure!). We all tried to be polite and wait but our food was getting cold.  Once the food arrived our server disappeared.  We asked a different server for more bread but ccf must be on a cost cutting program.   It never arrived.   When our server finally came back we asked for more bread again.   She repeated the request, asking in an incredulous tone, ""MORE bread? "", like we couldn't possibly need more. On to desert.   It is, after all, the reason you go there. The cheesecake was solid and did not disappoint. Cost cutting is going on with the cheesecake as well. No longer are the portions overflowing the plate! Normal portions! Price is the same, however.   And, note to staff, unless you plan to eat it with your fingers one needs a fork.   We had none.   A fact the server could have noted when she cleaned our plates.  So being the patient customer I am, I asked for forks.   She said she'd go find some and brought back 2.  Only 1 problem, there were 5 of us! So I sent her scurrying off in a huff for 3 more.  Needles to say her tip reflected her level of poor service. I won't be back anytime soon."
Ally T.,"Blacklick, OH",0,1,,1.0,10/10/2016,"I have eaten at this easton cheesecake factory many times- and each time we had great service until last night. I have been a server for the past 5 years, so I know when another server says the same B.S lines to me and I know they messed up. I understand that mistakes happen, things in the kitchen can get crazy, people run food they weren't suppose to.  i get it. But our server never apologized during the meal and neither did management.  it took almost 10 minutes- once again if she would have apologized in her greet ""thank you so much for your patience this evening I'm Tianna""- i get it. full section. running around. nothing.  It took quiet awhile after that to receive our drinks...1 ice water and 3 unsweetened ice teas.  *do the servers/management at cheesecake factory not help one another when they are slammed?*  when she finally came back to us we gave her our full order- apps and all.  this is where the service and management failed.  Our appetizers never came because our entree's came out first. two other servers ran our dinner out in which we asked what happened to our appetizers. They were being plated. Our server didn't come over to say ""I am so sorry!"" nadda. The manager who I assume was running the line that evening came over right when our food was dropped off to inform us that our appetizers were coming out, in which we said no. we had our dinner. no thanks. He honestly didn't looked surprised that she messed up. But no apology just a ""I'll take those off the check for you"" and walked away.  we were half way done with our meal when our server came back to see how everything was tasting-no mention of the appetizers mix up. dropped off the bread that we had asked for when we ordered our food over 20 minutes prior....filled up drinks and walked away and didn't come back until we boxed up our food.  we all ordered a cheesecake, my boyfriend a cup of coffee. My friends across from me said ""yes, two pumpkin cheesecakes because we don't share""- she misunderstood, this I wasn't as mad because I once again understand that it's loud and the other cheesecake came out somewhat quicker *I understand you have to rush the order* - since only three cheesecakes came out not 4. but my boyfriend never got his coffee. no apology.  so we paid and hung out in the booth- we were actually ok with how everything happened for our meals. we haven't see each other and it was actually my friends taking me and my boyfriend out as my boyfriends belated birthday present to us from them. well needless to say... I caught our server and another server at a terminal staring at us- I can only speculate that they were sh** talking us because she saw her 10% tip, but they made it pretty obvious, my jaw dropped. Go to the back ladies.  Our server did apologize once though- at the end after we paid about the appetizers but it wasn't sincere, quick, and she promptly walked away.  I was just going to write this off as one bad trip, as I've gone before and my service was great- I wasn't going to write a review but the last straw was when our server came back to us to ask us why she received such a bad tip..which is that cheesecake factory policy? because...it should have been obvious- well my friend that paid went on to explain why she received a bad tip- about how the appetizers, the coffee- she tried to say she can't control when the food comes out- which is somewhat true-but in this circumstance no. I don't know if you use micros or aloha but any server knows not to put appetizers and pasta in at the same time- as most places you have the pasta pre-cooked so all you have to do is deep fry the chicken, toss in the sauce and plate them- so yeah they cook way faster than all of the appetizers we ordered. She either put them in at the same time or  way too close to one another- like she rang them in less then five minutes later. Management never came back either to check on us. honestly we could have solved this problem if management would have been better and expressed ANY apologies but none. I hope next time I go back this issues will be resolved with service and management."
Curt P.,"Spokane, WA",3,15,1,5.0,9/23/2014,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory for years. I have never had a bad experience and I've been to several in multiple states. I don't care that the menu gives War and Peace a run for it's money, I don't care that one meal likely meets a weeks worth of calories, and I definitely don't care that it's a chain. The phrase jack of all trades master of none does not apply to Cheesecake Factory because everything they do, they do well. From appetizer to dessert it is can't miss. AND THE PORTIONS ARE SO LARGE THEY DESERVE A SENTENCE IN ALL CAPS.  The chicken madiera is one of their most popular dishes and if you try it you will see why. My favorite menu item has actually been of the menu for years, but as sad as that is, I can always drown out the memory with an appetizer, entree and dessert. And of course, cheesecakes are their namesake, and the have about a billion to choose from. But seriously, the list is 50+ cheesecakes of which I've probably had between 10-15. My favorite is the Red Velvet and it is not so rich that I can't eat it in a single sitting. Some cheesecakes, like the Godiva or Tuxedo are too rich not to be spread out over the next day or so. The Linda's Fudge Cake is always a good choice if you opt not to go the cheesecake route. The one downside is that this place is always packed during peak hours but it is worth the wait. We will definitely be back which is probably the most important test of any restaurant."
Ed H.,"Pickerington, OH",10,57,1,2.0,10/13/2014,"I remember my first visit, it was great. Now it's just loud, uncomfortable seating next to strangers, so so food with giant portions.  The menu is all over the board, way too many items to do a good job.   I ordered the Southern Catfish, very over cooked, served with a pound of mashed potatoes, corn and green beans.  My wife had corn chowder.  We both ordered cheesecake.  60.00 later we head home to eat our cheesecake at home without two families sitting on both sides of us stare at our plates. The pumpkin cheesecake is wonderful. Next time I'll pickup a salad at Wendy's then swing by for dessert to go."
Stephanie J.,"Pataskala, OH",3,47,10,5.0,1/15/2016,Favorite restaurant EVER! Have not had one bad thing here. Service is always great and fast. The burgers here are also the best burgers I've ever had in my entire life! I've had burgers from the top steak places and none of them can even come close to being as mouth watering as theirs. Love this place!
Joe M.,"Walled Lake, MI",227,1077,232,4.0,11/11/2014,"Love the Shepard's Pie. Great for Gluten Free folks. The menu is massive, but lots of good things for us Gluten Free eaters. I say it's a must.BTW our server was so nice. Really went out of his way to make sure our business meal went well."
Corey Tess T.,"Anaheim, CA",752,647,636,2.0,12/9/2012,"I am usually a fan of TCF - I have been to locations all over So Cal. This one is located inside Easton Town Center and perhaps that is why it is so hard to get good service. We had a group of about 10 and had to wait almost 40 minutes for a table. We actually only got seated after talking to the manager. Once we were seated, they were pretty quick taking the orders and bringing us some complimentary apps, however it took a long time for us to get the entrees... a one hour lunch ended up taking us 3 hours. The food was fine and as usual the menu is massive. I always have The Navajo sandwich when I go there, fry bread and avocado (you can't hate that). It was good. Parking was torture. People were actually stalking everyone who would leave the shops to see where they were parked and try to get their spot. I think the service really suffers from the location, but then again.. that is why it is so popular as well."
Tabitha F.,"Columbus, OH",212,214,138,4.0,7/10/2014,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory a hand full of times now. It's never my suggestion to go there but I have never had a bad experience. I have sampled drinks, appetizers and deserts only....so I cannot speak for their dinner or lunch plates. Drinks - are pretty good, no unique drinks on the menu but the classics are pretty solid. They even have a happy hour with some good deals from 4-6. Appetizers - I have tried several and they were all yummy. The chicken pot stickers were probably my favorite, crab drip is great. Desserts - are of course the hi-light. cheesecake of countless varieties - The Lemon Raspberry Creme is so good but none will disappoint you, count on that. Their tiramisu was also really good - I was really surprised. The vibe inside is chill and the service has always been good whether I was at the bar or a table."
Christina M.,"Newark, OH",185,62,115,4.0,11/5/2015,Great place with good food. The cheesecake is the real star though. You can look at all of the pies for sale as soon as you walk in. There's always a wait so make sure to give yourself some extra time This is a chain restaurant so you know it's going to be the same across the board.
