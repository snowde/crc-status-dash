Mike K.,"Novato, CA",164,108,56,4.0,11/28/2017,"Seriously? A four-star review of a cheesy chain restaurant? Well, in this case, yes indeed. We had a couple of occasions to be in Corte Madera around lunchtime this fall, and ended up one time at The Factory. Well, of course I always am leery about a place with 3,000+ calorie meal options, but there it was in the middle of the menu book, SALADS! Actual healthy salad options. I went for Chinese chicken salad, the small one please with dressing on the side. It was surprisingly good, with crisp greens and noodles, lean chicken, and herbed just to my liking!  While perusing the menu I also discovered several other items for non-gluttons, including sandwich and dinner plate options that were not overly carbiferous. My wife and daughter loved their entree (enough for two) and we seemed to be in some kind of time warp as we were served our drinks almost as soon as we sat down and our lunch in what seemed like just a few minutes... a lot faster then I remember for Cheesecake Factory. Maybe it's just this location. Maybe they have to bring it up a notch for the fussy Main crowd. I don't know. I do know I'll try them again and let you all know if this was just a fluke. In any case, as of today, I'm a fan."
Sara S.,"Novato, CA",27,58,84,4.0,11/22/2017,"I don't know if I put review for Cheesecake Factory before or not! I am going to make it short and general! First of all, It was nice that we didn't have to wait for a long time to get a table although it was a busy day as usual!  The service was okay not good, but in Cheesecake Factory, the food never satisfied me... I have been in this place several times, but I feel like the food doesn't have the quality! For Cheesecake Factory, as a big chain restaurant, people are expecting a better quality!"
Oren H.,"San Francisco, CA",136,10,,1.0,11/6/2017,"How can it be possible that this place is still open? To be quite honest I try to not be negative and write bad reviews and I am always the person fighting to give servers larger tips but this may top one of the lesser experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I came into the restaurant, was seated right away because it was a very slow night (probably for good reason - others know what I did not). My server came over - seemed very nice - I placed my order and then that is where the fun starts. For the next 35 minutes (and I know it was this long because I made a call right after I ordered so I checked what the time was when I made the call) on a slow night, I did not see my server, my food, nada. Glass was empty. I had to get out of my seat to go ask another waitress to see if she could help find my server and my food. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me they burnt it so they are remaking the dish.  My server finally shows up with the food and asked me ""how do those look?"" I responded ""they look fine it's the first I have seen them"". She said she had them remake them because the first order was burnt. By the way they were the Cajun Chicken Littles. I greatly appreciate that they remade my order but I am not sure I need to be grateful that the process took 35 minutes when the restaurant was dead and it was their mistake. No manager ever came over to discuss what happened (the waitress that went to solve the riddle earlier implied one might). No apology for the long wait time was vet made. Still glass is empty. Finally some water arrives. Hallelujah.  I finish my meal and then the bill comes. Not only was there no considerations for the 40 minutes of my life that was wasted but the charge was even more than the menu price. I asked if I could swap mashed potatoes for asparagus. Reply ""Sure no problem"".  The bill had a $4 additional charge which was never mentioned. Moral of this whole story is I have no idea why I didn't ask for a manager. I have no idea why I left even a penny for a tip but left a tip (reduced but nonetheless) and I am writing this to warn everyone that the way this place is being run is absolute dog s*^%. There are plenty of amazing restaurants with great service so don't waste your precious hours walking through the doors of this sadly run establishment."
Calvin P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,3,,3.0,1/9/2018,"Went to the cheesecake factory with some friends last week. I ordered the Chicken Stuffed Tortillas.  The order comes with the tacos, corn cakes, and black beans. The Chicken Stuffed Tortillas themselves were good - not great but good.  For some reason both the black beans and the corn cakes were just lousy.   I had a mojito which made the whole evening feel good so overall I was happy. And the server was friendly and generally on point."
Nathan S.,"Novato, CA",91,23,,3.0,1/8/2018,"Walking in you get the standard chain restaurant.  We were seated quickly and got our drinks.  The waiters looked understaffed and it took awhile to get our order in and out on our table.   Light was a bit too dim and the music was a bit too loud even for my young ears. The food is what we expected: burgers, pastas, pizza, etc. nothing spectacular, but very convenient.  There isn't a dish I would say ""you must stay away from.""  Their cheesecake game IS on point though.  That never a bad order, course it is on the priced side. I've been here several times because of convenience, not because it was super great. There are times service is awesome, the food is terrible, and vise versa. Advice: workin on consistency would be the first thing to do.  The rest will kinda fall into place when that's addressed."
Laura D.,"Napa, CA",2,33,80,4.0,7/6/2017,"CAN I GET SALT ALL AROUND THAT RIM RIM RIM RIM Just kidding it was sugar. I ordered a strawberry lemonade that I would order again because it was so fresh. I was a little sick when I went here to celebrate graduating Junior College so I couldn't enjoy my food so much before I felt too sick to eat. I ordered a soup and salad combo to keep it more on the healthy side. The salad was simple but EXCELLENT. It was so flavorful with the ranch dressing I ordered and so fresh. I ordered a soup on the side which was a cream of chicken but it had vegetables in it like peas, carrots and artichokes. I can tell there were more artichokes than anything but that's okay since I liked the taste. Would come here again! Hopefully when I'm not sick and can enjoy food the way I like."
Heidi D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",201,554,1076,4.0,9/9/2017,"I came here with some girlfriends for a birthday/end-of-the-week/spontaneous evening.  We had a somewhat odd/negative experience and it was unlike times at other Cheesecake Factory locations so I am not rating down for it. I will give it a try again.    At the restaurant itself, we had two managers come to our table and I did end up contacting CF corporate afterwards, Their customer service has been professional and I feel like our frustrations and concerns were heard.   I did have the lemon cheesecake and it was as very good.  The meringue was sweet and I liked the texture."
Alan R.,"San Rafael, CA",170,270,164,4.0,5/29/2017,"Decent except when it's crowded Management closes the outside against customers wishes, scaring away large groups of people Terrible for #cake shareholders"
Wendy C.,"Napa, CA",23,214,296,1.0,5/29/2017,"Long wait for service. We thought going to the bar area would be faster but maybe regular table would have been faster!  The water glass had lipstick on it.  That was the first of many red flags. The spoon, knife were not clean.  When the nice server brought back the new water glass it had something at the bottom that was scary looking not sure if it was a bug or what??? The manager Emily came out and apologized but when the server brought another glass of water it had something on the outside!! What a calamity.  We decided that we did not trust the food and walked out.  The first time I've ever done that in my life. PS The bread was warm and yummy."
Diane G.,"Petaluma, CA",9,149,236,3.0,11/23/2017,"We were a group of five but only came for dessert at the to go area. We did not sit down at a table. There was a long line waiting. I thought the cheesecake prices were expensive. Slices were a good size, very rich."
Lindsay A.,"San Rafael, CA",0,60,41,3.0,12/30/2017,"Server was awesome, service could have been stronger and the food a tad better too (greasy egg rolls, out of cauliflower, misunderstandings re orders ...). Ended on the best hot fudge sundae with extra whipped cream, mostly makes up for the misadventures!"
Erica S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,33,,5.0,12/29/2017,"A+ for my favorite restaurant! They take good care of me every week! Atmosphere is great, food is fabulous and the staff is super good!"
Jason K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",10,53,69,3.0,11/7/2017,This place is the typical overpriced chain restaurant. It's decent food but try the upscale approach in order to charge more. The calamari was good but pretty pricey. You won't be wowed with the food and you will pay a good price for it but that's what I expected when I came in.
Joanna C.,"Seattle, WA",140,88,189,4.0,1/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory, yay! My first visit in SF.  - Free bread: is always a highlight at any restaurant, who am I kidding XD The brown bread is much softer with a hint of sweetness (and much better) than the white bread. I definitely ate too much bread before all the food came :P - Louisiana chicken pasta: such a giant portion, definitely enough for 2.  - Strawberry cheesecake: I've never tried it before, but I guess it's a favourite on their menu for good reason! It was really delicious, and not too sweet (at least, compared to some of the other ultra chocolatey flavours I've tried in the past lol), so I'll definitely be ordering this one again soon :)"
Eva C.,"Tiburon, CA",45,172,563,4.0,8/8/2017,Great food tonight!- Korean cauliflower was great and the buffalo wings were spot on. My husband ordered the Baja chicken tacos and the zucchini strips- very nice tasty tonight. We sat at the bar tonight which was great since the giants were on and winning for once! Bartenders were very nice and efficient and the bar area was kept  very clean! Great job tonight
Christina L.,"San Rafael, CA",21,133,502,3.0,1/15/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a number of times before taking my business elsewhere. Haven't been in some time since my birthday. I came in with my boyfriend to celebrate with drinks and food. My boyfriend asked the waitress if it was possible to have a little birthday cake for me, she refused. Aside from that, the food was pretty good. Ordered three appetizers, two ""signature"" dishes and 3 drinks or so. Can't recall hahah. Total came out to 220 and some change. Cheesecake Factory was my good to place for big dinner parties w/ coworkers and or relatives. I'll be back, but not anytime soon. ;("
Lee G.,"Antioch, CA",89,6,2,1.0,7/29/2017,This is my favorite place of ALL RESTAURANTS! Especially the one in Corte Madera.. The food was GARBAGE!! The Firecracker Salmon came out looking HORRIBLE! My Bread was burned! TheCrab Roll was busted and burned! Very little crab yet lots of breading and very little crab meat! Overall .. IT WAS SINCERELY DISHEARTENING!!
kate f.,"New York, NY",193,5,13,5.0,12/23/2017,I rarely ever write a review but I must say that our server Scott at the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera made the biggest impression! My boyfriend and I dined at the restaurant the night before Thanksgiving this past November and we're delighted to have Scott as our server. 5 STARS!!! Not only was he kind but he was the only waiter waiting on the bar area and did a stand out job. The food was good but the service is what will keep us coming back!
Catherine W.,"San Rafael, CA",39,122,28,2.0,6/25/2017,"Came here recently with a friend for some bar food & drink. Did a slow burn while I watched the wait staff service some woman who came in well after me. She actually ordered and got her food and drink before they even stopped by our table to see if we had any questions and to take our order. I mean this place is okay, but it would def be a third or fourth choice if in the Village shopping center. The food is not good enough to make up for shoddy service. (That is to say, I'd probably skip it)."
Shirley P.,"San Rafael, CA",2,9,,1.0,10/3/2017,"Burnt dark, tasteless Tex-Mex egg rolls Kale & quinoa salad rancid +$10 mimosa tasted like Bud Light mixed with OJ  No judgement on server at all.  This is prob result of poor mgmt & untrained chef or w/e.  I advise Yelp readers to not spend $$ on this establishment until new mgmt is in place.  I am not looking for any freebies.  I am writing on this platform because I have a conscience."
Nichole L.,"Windsor, CA",6,22,,1.0,12/18/2017,"Where do I begin. The missing items or the bad service. First we ordered the avocado rolls and later when we're expecting them someone tells us they don't have any. Secondly we ordered factory burrito, a entree salad, and a burger with fries and side. We never got the side salad or the sides that were supposed to come with the burrito. We asked for bread twice only got one. On top of this our waiter made some excuse about how the kitchen never tells customers what they don't have and other sites are better. After this mess we get the bill and the waiter charged us for the salad and the avocado rolls. Of course in the end we got it taken off. This was the worst service I have ever had at this restaurant and I am not sure I will be coming back."
Elia B.,"Atascadero, CA",15,117,233,3.0,6/18/2017,Not the best CF I've been to.  The service was great.   The place was a little too hot ... they needed to kick the a/c up in the morning.  The tables are too low.
Tonya T.,"Novato, CA",0,10,5,4.0,10/28/2017,Yummy lunch with family had really good salmon. The only thing I would complain is the food was slow but service was great thank you.
Rolando B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,13,,1.0,12/6/2017,Ordered an old fashioned burger and i asked for medium rare it was burnt and fries you can tell were old. I got this to go so i couldn't talk to anyone on why my food tasted like Ass
Sandy M.,"Novato, CA",18,59,27,5.0,8/25/2017,"Had a fabulous lunch the other day. My friend is always late. My waiter Courtney was always checking on me and insisted on bringing me bread and butter with ice water while I waited. Was very attentive and fun to talk to. I had the chicken pot stickers and they were great. Presented arranged in a circle. Was just the right amount for a late lunch. My friend had the turkey club sandwich. It was loaded with meat and looked great. He raved about it and took half home. He eats out just about every day since he doesn't cook at home, so his comments are well placed. He also ordered half a 10 inch cheesecake to go. I took my favorite Key Lime Pie cheesecake. Was able to make it last for three wonderful snacks. Love it!"
Michelle M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",95,138,272,4.0,5/18/2017,"For a chain restaurant, this is definitely one of my favorites. If you or someone in your group can't find something to like from their VERY extensive menu, the problem is not them! Cheesecake factory salads are probably my favorite, so many to chose from but I love the bbq chicken one the best. I've enjoyed other entrees such as; chicken picatta, prawn and angel hair, baja tacos, grilled salmon, meatloaf and chicken madeira. The entree portions are HUGE! Perfect for leftovers. As far as their cheesecake my personal favorite is the Tuxedo. I've also had their peanut butter cup, red velvet and oreo. All delicious!! I don't remember ever having bad service, the waitstaff is friendly and efficient. Definitely will be returning!"
Danyelle H.,"Windsor, CA",2,33,31,4.0,9/2/2017,Late night girls drive to get a bite to eat. Been here many times but the service was odd this time. We waited for our food for about 40 minutes and it came to us cold.  Eggs on a friends plate came hard when it should of been runny. She just asked for another egg but they wouldn't bring one ?? And then they took her plate.  It was just a weird night. The manager did take a couple dinners off the bill and gave 25% off for everyone  . I think the kitchen was having a hard night. This one time will not keep me from going back. I do love the cheesecake and my Asian lettuce wrap tacos were delicious as always.  Huge menu so there s pretty much something for everyone.
Alyssa C.,"San Francisco, CA",21,281,,4.0,8/27/2017,"I haven't tried everything on the menu but the ones I have tried have tasted great. Some of my favorites include the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, Avocado Egg Rolls, various cheesecakes, etc. However I wish this location offered me a $5 off coupon or gift card for a future visit just like the one in SF. That would be nice."
Navie K.,"Yuba City, CA",2,17,2,5.0,9/25/2017,"We ordered the Buffalo Crisps and Louisiana Ch Pasta, our server was very good at providing details about the food! They were kinda busy so we felt a tiny bit neglected. But he was super kind, and the food absolutely made up for it. The Buffalo Crisps were amazing, and such a large portion for the two of us. So crispy and cheesy, and they aren't spicy, the pasta was also wonderful. Definitely would return, the food here is really good!"
Madelyn A.,"Cotati, CA",8,51,2,5.0,9/9/2017,"My review is for our amazing waiter, Scott. He's been my server a few times over the years and had I known his name before our most recent visit, I would have written this review sooner.  Scott is ALWAYS on top of it with refilling water, which is always a great thing when I'm at a restaurant because I love to drink ice cold water and seem overindulge on it. He's attentive -- greeting us as we sit down, taking our order, bread, a plate of strawberries for our toddler, etc. He jokes -- I asked for no egg in my salad. So, when he's repeating back our order to confirm, Scott jokingly said I asked for extra egg  Our last visit Scott was amazing because we were daringly out to eat as a family with our newborn. He doted on her, telling us about his 2 kids. The baby started to get restless during dinner and he recognized that and helped us get our food boxed up as quickly as possible. We were getting cake to go bc it was our older daughter's birthday and he treated us to a dessert as a congratulations for the baby. Totally unexpected but such a nice gesture. Scott is hands down one of the best servers I've ever had and I really hope he gets recognized for his hard work.  I'll add, close to a couple of years ago I was out to dinner at Cheesecake with an old friend who is known to be high maintenance at restaurants. Scott was our server at the time. I'll never forget this meal because I was actually embarrassed by her behavior toward him. She had special requests with everything she ordered because of whatever diet she was on at the time and its restrictions. She wasn't considerate or appreciative toward him for his work to make sure her meal was correct. He very much went above and beyond to accommodate her. Long and short of this story, he was smiles and rainbows and didn't miss a beat while dealing with my difficult companion."
Vanessa P.,"Spring Valley, San Diego, CA",39,13,,1.0,11/23/2017,"We came into town on a Tuesday night to visit my son and came here for dinner. The place was busy, but we were able to be seated in the bar area  The service  and food were both horrible. The waiter, Jorge was rude and could care less about showing any pleasant customer service. It took so long for us to get our food, water filled or bread at the table. The food came out cold and tasted horrible. When I asked to speak to a manager, Emily came to our table and just wanted to make excuses and not take any ownership or responsibility  for the bad service or food. The waiter, Jorge all of a sudden became friendly once we spoke to Emily, but it was too late. We did not eat our meals and the ticket still came with the entire amount due. Horrible food, horrible customer service and horrible management. We will not return to this location and recommend that no one go to this location."
Ty P.,"Mill Valley, CA",3,3,,2.0,8/2/2017,"Service has been sliding at this location. They've hired new servers that often get the bill wrong; twice recently we were given the wrong bill and charged for other folks' food. Took days to have someone else's bill reversed from my card.   Secondly, a new waiter came lumbering over, sweating and dripping sweat onto the salad plate as he layed the dish onto the table. Same waiter touching food with thumbs. Talk about appetizing!!  Thirdly, service is noticeably slower and appetizers often come out AFTER your dinner. Always the same excuse from each server that they're ""backed up."" My impression is that the new hires aren't getting decent training."
Audra S.,"Novato, CA",91,40,4,1.0,8/12/2017,"The last few times we have come, we have been really disappointed, but this time sealed the deal. We will NEVER eat at this overpriced box again! Arrived today for a late lunch, not too crowded, but sat down to a dirty table and waited 17 minutes JUST for water! When our waitress arrived to finally take our order, the first two items I attempted to order THEY WERE OUT OF! What? It was not even similar?? How much are they out of? We ended up ordering 2 burgers and a salad. After waiting AN HOUR, for an easy order, my sons BBq Bacon burger came out without bacon AND shoestring onions. My burger was SO charred it tastes like charcoal and the salad was wrong. WTH? After 1/2 his burger was gone the shoestring onions came out on the side with a ""sorry"" and the fries were replaced with a salad. To pay over $80 for crap food and crap service, we will NEVER EVER go here again."
Chinh L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",217,48,7,2.0,8/10/2017,"Went here last night. We ordered the loaded tots, dynamite shrimp, bellagio chicken with basil pasta and the miso salmon. We finished dinner with the celebration cheese cake.  1st I was a little disappointed that they were out of avocado egg rolls, so we decided to order the loaded tots and those were not good. Dynamite shrimp had no flavor. My gf thinks that here dish was a warm but not hot, like it had been sitting around for awhile. My miso salmon was amazing like always. #1 dependable dish there. Celebration cheese cake was no good."
Douglas F.,"Tiburon, CA",683,451,294,3.0,6/16/2016,"Corte Madera Cheesecake Factory- the Cheesecake is Amazing, the food is average, the service is average to poor. The Happy Hour in the bar seems to be typically understaffed causing long waits for service. Because it's understaffed the servers are running around and lack the time to give quality service. This is unfortunate because they have a great happy hour menu from 4pm to 6pm."
Tim B.,"Novato, CA",70,278,8,4.0,1/1/2017,"So one of our gifts for Christmas was $100 in gift cards for the Cheesecake Factory. I say two as the giver felt it necessary to split the $100 in two, just in case we wanted to split up and visit the chain on separate occasions. It's allright, it's ok... We wound up visiting just three days after the national holiday, arriving at about 5:30. Granted it was in the middle of that holiday week between Christmas and New Years, but the place was hoppin. Fortunately we were able to get a table quickly without a reservation, although there were a lot of larger groups waiting for a table. A taste of familiarity occurred when we realized the woman walking us to our table used to work at another restaurant we frequent. Upon this, she had our server 'treat us extra special'. That's nice - and to be fair he did check on us often, although all of that could have fallen by the wayside if they had just remembered to give us forks so that we didn't feel obligated to ask for them. Sidebar: Why is it that many restaurants don't seem to pay much attention to obvious details such as... silverware? Are they really paranoid about people stealing the semi-precious metal? As to the meal itself - well, one can never fault this chain for lack of choice. I enjoyed the Cajun pasta, washed down with a Lost Coast IPA, whereas the missus relished her falafel pasta and iced tea. Food came promptly and went down smoother than a Santana/Rob Thomas collaboration. Dessert was the Kahlua cheesecake, which was predictably sumptuous.  Entire bill came to a mere 67 smackers - considering that accounted for two people's meals, drinks and desserts, not too shabby. And we didn't have to eat until the next day."
Kevin K.,"Petaluma, CA",2,4,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Holy cow, what terrible service. I know this is a chain and all that, but when you wait 10 minutes in the bar to be acknowledged, then go back to the host and are finally seated and another 10 before being acknowledged by the server, then 40 minutes waiting for a burger and orange chicken, then the food clearly being warm (not hot) from sitting under a heat lamp for who knows how long, it pushes the limit of what's acceptable service for chain food. Seriously, go anywhere else. Nordstroms has a great restaurant."
Saeed R.,"Richmond, CA",67,94,39,3.0,8/6/2017,Really can't complain. I was able to get multiple slices of cheesecake at a decent price (national cheesecake day). It was pretty empty at only 5pm compared to the other locations. The cashier was pretty nice. Not a lot of interaction. Can't say I will necessarily be back. Corte Madera is a little too far out. Good parking.
Mickey O.,"El Sobrante, CA",11,17,1,5.0,8/24/2017,"5 stars all thanks to Scott! He was our server and he was great! Big smile and good attitude. He explained a new menu item that I ordered, which was great. He refilled our drinks often and quickly. Gave us an extra plate of grated cheese after I mentioned my wife loved it when we first got our food. He knew I needed a box for my leftover food before I even asked amd gave me extra bread for later.  To top it all off he gave us two hot towels to clean our hands after the meal and somehow my hands felt softer and cleaner than they have in years (I'm not kidding, I made that exact comment at the table). As usual the food was good and the portions were large. I got the chicken parmesan pizza style which was tasty and the wife got a pear and blue cheese flatbread which she loved. We tried bacon truffle oil cheese sticks too but they were only fine not great.  We got our cheesecake to go and Scott gave us a coupon for our next visit. I told him it was our anniversary the next day after we got the check and that he made it great already."
Ally G.,"Belvedere Tiburon, Belvedere, CA",80,3,6,1.0,11/22/2017,Came here for my birthday dinner. I was appalled. Our waiter was fantastic and simply Embarrassed by how the manager Emily Was treating us. I had a terrible time coming here for my BIRTHDAY. I ordered three things and each time the manager waited ten minutes to come inform me that they were out of the dish. My friends all got there food while I was stuck waiting. Besides that we couldn't get bread for the first 35 minutes and then once we ate the bread and asked for more we waited 30 more Minutes to get the next batch. The manager treated me Terrible talking with a sarcastic smirk and tone in her voice. she did nothing at all to Try to make my dinner better and we eventually had to leave. I'm disgusting by how I got treated and am expecting a call from someone to offer me an apology.
