Doug R.,"Richmond, CA",0,26,1,2.0,1/1/2016,"Consistently the worst service of most ""chain"" restaraunts I have been too. I feel that this location especially isn't managed well. The wait for the initial server contact is way too long. We just waited over 15 minutes from when we were seated to when we were contacted. It is so noisy that the servers have a hard time hearing. The food is ok, nothing really special except for the Thai lettuce wraps. I have been to this location quite a few times over the years and I always leave only moderately satisfied."
David T.,"Rohnert Park, CA",21,17,,1.0,3/21/2016,"Sad to say we had an abysmal experience. We had a breakfast, the food was mediocre and the waiter had an attitude. We should have gone to IHOP"
Tina O.,"Santa Rosa, CA",235,415,1145,4.0,1/29/2015,"Had lunch here yesterday and liked it alot.  We split a couple appetizers - wrapped deep fried cuban sandwich which was crispy, tasty and not greasy.  then we shared the chicken satay lettuce wrap that came with 3 sauces and 4 different condiments.  It was messy but really tasty.  And kindly they brought us hot towels and lemons for our sticky fingers.  Service was perfect.  We liked it alot!  We just couldn't find room for any cheesecake but they looked divine - maybe next time!"
Erika Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,108,3,2.0,12/12/2015,Bad customer service. Even worse food. Came for dessert asked our server if we could have alcoholic coffee he looked at us like we were crazy?? Then brought us a latte with a shot of kaluha which was $8.50!! For one shot! And the chocolate cake was extremely dry. Such a bad experience here today.
Samantha R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",53,139,35,4.0,1/17/2014,"I got the Fish & Chips, and ordered a bunch of other food for my co-workers. It was a little greasy & pricey, but good."
Lorin S.,"Tiburon, CA",50,124,78,2.0,8/13/2015,"Wow has this place changed hands or what?  Not only was my order wrong, but then when they brought the right order have the ingredients weren't in it. Somehow the management is not doing their job of keeping this place in better rankings. It's a shame that the people of Marin continue to except bad food when this place used to have some of the best food in Marin."
Cynthia T.,"San Rafael, CA",0,8,1,2.0,8/25/2016,"Went there for lunch right when they opened at 11am. I ordered the lunch pasta-fettuccine Alfredo no chicken, and it made me sick. I didn't finish it due to the fact that it seemed like leftovers from the day before. The sauce was of some weird consistency and the pasta itself didn't seem just boiled. My stomach started turning and I rushed to their bathroom to throw up. My suggestion: don't eat there right when it opens."
Jen C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,75,,1.0,8/15/2014,"This reivew is for the service NOT the food.  The food is always good... This time around, our service was the WORST! I took my brother, his girlfriend and my two chidren to lunch at Cheesecake Factory today.  We came post lunch rush (if there is one in Corte Madera).  We were seated about 5 minutes after arriving and all was going perfectly... Our waiter was pleasant, he took our drink orders and then our entree choices.  We were hungry since it was on the late side.  My kids were STARVING.  So, we wait for our food.  And we wait.  And pretty soon I realize we've been waiting close to an hour.  During this time our waiter was totally MIA.  He didn't check in with us, didn't give us an update or explanation or even replenish our bread supply.  We had to flag him down and when we did, he said something that I intrepreted as, ""I'll ask the Stewardess"" but I guess what he said was, ""I'll see where it is"".  He comes back about 5 minutes later with our food and NO explanation.  I asked him why it took so long and he said, ""It's a new menu day"".   Huh? Yes, it was a new menu day at Cheesefactory yet not ONE item we ordered was a new menu option.  Not only that, why would a restaurant change their menu on a Friday, back up the kitchen and offer NO apology.  Personally, I think this is unacceptable.   In all the years, and all the different Cheesecake Factories I've eaten in, I've NEVER had service this bad.  Pathetic..."
Jaclyn N.,"San Francisco, CA",63,13,4,1.0,4/22/2016,"What a terrible experience. I've been going to this restaurant for YEARS, and this was by far the worst experience I've had there. Our waitress, Katerina, was horrific. From the start of the meal she copped attitude and got progressively worse to the point where she was walking past our table and ignoring my mom and me. We spoke to the manager about her awful attitude and service (not to mention our food being sent out ice cold) and he paid us some lip service and removed our two iced teas from the bill. What a joke of a restaurant!"
Eliza W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",111,51,1,5.0,9/5/2015,"As always, the Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. Great place to go to celebrate, especially on a weekday. Great food for a chain and always pleasant service."
Alyssa T.,"Novato, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/11/2015,"I used to love the Cheesecake Factory, but the past three times I have been there, the service has been horrible. The food hasn't been good either. The most recent time, my friend and I waited ten minutes after being seated before we were acknowledged by a waitress or waiter. The waitress was fairly nice but our appetizers were horrible. I ordered the avocado egg rolls as a meal during happy hour and I couldn't finish them. The avocado was overly ripe and mushy, and the egg roll shell can best be described as stale. My friend's crab dip came with burnt mini toasts, and the waitress never came around to refill her water. We both walked away disappointed but were happy that we at least only paid happy hour price; still not worth it. I say just come to get cheesecake and expect a large amount of waiting either before or after being seated."
Issy D.,"Sacramento, CA",771,562,70,3.0,4/2/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is somehow not as good as the other ones I have gone too.   I love the one in Sacramento and have never had a bad meal at this one. I got the cajun chicken pasta here which was boring in flavor even though it stated ""a very spicy sauce."" This might be the case for just this CF or maybe all CF's. It was my first time having this pasta. I do have to say the shrimp on this pasta was perfectly cooked and tasty. I got a Mai Tai here and was awesome, but for ten dollars I could of done without. The drinks here are a real bank killer. The cheesecakes of course are always a real treat. I tried the oreo one this time and it's sinful."
Michelle H.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,51,2,2.0,7/27/2016,"Sooooo, I'm a Cheesecake Factory enthusiast!  CF is the perfect place to go when no one wants to make a decision on a particular type of food.  CF has a little of everything, and it's always very delicious.  For this visit, my family and I had just gotten into town, and this was our first meal commencing a week-long family adventure.  We hadn't taken a trip like this since we were kids.  It was something special, and we knew CF would send us off correctly.  Oh man, were we sorely mistaken.  Luckily this was the only mistake we made that week.  Ok back to the review.  Our server was Bryan, and at first he was very attentive.  He made contact with our table quickly, got our drink orders promptly (along with their famous bread), and took our order in a timely manner.  Then it all went to hell.  Our food came and tasted fine, but for NO JOKE 20 minutes, he went by our table without checking on us.  No ""two minute, two bite"" check back to see if everything came out okay.  No refills.  Not even a glance our way.  My Dad went without a drink his entire meal!  And you might ask, why didn't you raise a hand or call for him?  WE DID.  But he had a needy 5-top in the booth next to us that was taking him all over the restaurant with their requests....  I get it, I served for 8 years at a similar corporate restaurant, and it's hard to break away from a table like that, but you HAVE to BALANCE your SERVICE.  MULTITASKING is a MUST.  There is no room for going back and forth for ONE table.  Full hands in, full hands out.  That's the job.  Finally my sister got out of the booth and had to stand in front of him to stop him from walking by.  She asked for the check and boxes.  He knew he was in trouble.  He took the plates that needed to be boxed, then we got the check.  BUT HE ADDED ANOTHER TABLE'S BILL ONTO OUR CHECK.  Bryan, always glance at your check before printing.  There were no drinks on it, so the sequence of service was off.  Or perhaps you hadn't closed a previous check, which prompted the lack of drinks when you began our check.  Whatever it is, it's a messy way to work.  So we got the manager over and my sister explained what happened and he had that look.  It's the look of slight defensiveness, he's heard complaints one too many times at his restaurant.  He said he'd take 25% off and fix the ticket.  Cool, great, we just want to leave.  The manager brings back the ticket, AND IT'S FOR THE WRONG HALF OF THE BILL!  It's for a 2-top and there were four of us!  How did he not catch this?!  So then my sister hunts down the manager again.  And he doesn't say a word, just gets us the right half without eye contact and no one comes back pick up our check.  So we leave cash and were on our way.  For CF standards, I'd petition to shut this location down, you don't need this kind of negativity on your good name.  The only reason it's still open is because happy hour options (or options as a whole) are limited in Corte Madera.  Your location works in your favor.  Just...if you're reading this as a nice family going on an awesome vacation and want a place you're familiar with so you think Let's Go To CF!  Don't.  Try their local restaurants.  OH!  Or Super Duper Burgers in Mill Valley!  That place was AMAZING!"
J B.,"Berkeley, CA",0,111,,1.0,9/1/2016,After a horrible lunch here we have decided that we cannot return. We ordered a turkey burger which came with cabbage instead of lettuce and tasted gross. The veggie burger fell into a million pieces and tasted soft and sick! My kid told me her chicken strips were so hard and crispy that she could not bite into them without pain. The bread was also hard. Service was so-so. We won't return because of the food itself. Very gross!!!! For a cheaper price go next door to Boudin and get some superb bread and soup! That's what we will be doing next time for sure.
Bennett V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,19,,2.0,8/1/2015,"This place used to be good, but has been going down in quality over the past couple of years.  They are just getting lazy both in the kitchen and out front.  I don't know, maybe it just the fact that it's a big corporation chain and I'm expecting too much... But it did used to be good and the ones down in LA are pretty good.  They need to get someone in charge of this Marin branch who inspires good work from the cooks again."
Brendan E.,"Monrovia, CA",22,77,7,2.0,8/18/2015,Let me start off by saying that I know cheesecake factory operations very well. I eat at cheesecake factory at least once a week and ALWAYS order the same thing spicy cashew chicken. Today this dish was gross. First rice was extremely under portioned and meal was about a third smaller then other cheese cake factories. Also the plate was soaked in a water mess of sauce it was like eating soup and tasted off.  Maybe too much sherry wine and not enough hoisin sauce? idk you be the judge. Any how also I didn't get bread until I was halfway into my meal... which is always nice to munch on while waiting for my meal.  Overall not a typical cheesecake factory experience...
Sol S.,"Larkspur, CA",78,18,5,5.0,8/21/2016,"Went here for lunch couple of weeks ago, great service and food! We sat outside and it was absolutely a great afternoon."
Diego B.,"Brisbane, CA",31,9,6,4.0,9/22/2014,"This restaurant is a temple. I do not know any person who lives in California and has never been to the CCF. Indeed, when I think about it I have the impression I am talking about a real American landmark. My last visit was awesome, starting with an exceptional service provided by a Ukrainian waitress, I can't remember her name but she was ridiculously adorable and her accent even sweeter than the cheesecake I had for dessert.  My dinner consisted of a small cup of clam chowder and the Bang-Bang chicken and shrimp. I did not like the soup much because it was too heavy but the main course was excellent. I loved the coconut sprinkles with the curry sauce the chicken and shrimp are mixed with. For dessert I enjoyed the White Chocolate Raspberry Cream cheesecake, the waitress said it was the main seller and I decided to try it. Aside the lousy soup everything else was great."
Bill J.,"Petaluma, CA",0,58,1,3.0,1/17/2016,"I don't really go in for chain restaurants, however the Cheesecake factory has some good meals and is a nice place to stop and relax after shopping. Steak Diane and bang bang chicken and shrimp are two of my favorites. Downside is it is sometimes uncomfortably loud. A few other downsides are the inconsistent service as well as the premium prices for mediocre drinks. On our last visit there was no bread or water, and we had to ask for utensils including a serving spoon to share the main course. Mixed drinks over $14? The last time I was there I ordered a Martini and they brought it in an old fashioned glass - said they were out of the right glasses."
Pala V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,24,18,3.0,5/12/2014,Love their red velvet cheese cake OMG.  Their busy during lunch hour their staff are wonderful. Steak is delightful easy parking. Would go again when their not busy
