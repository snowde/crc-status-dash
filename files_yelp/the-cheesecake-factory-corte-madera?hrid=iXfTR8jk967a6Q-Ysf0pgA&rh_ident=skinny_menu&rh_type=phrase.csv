Sher R.,"Marin County, United States",0,10,,5.0,6/9/2017,"Something for everyone. Except for the loudness of the place- it is a great place for the family with members of all ages. I love the   - helps to save calories for the wonderful desserts lol. No really, I like NY cheesecake so we order the sundaes. We have been known to have the sundae for dinner! The chocolate cake with ice cream is the best BIG dessert in Marin since there isn't a Farrell's or Max's. I am not talking about delicate desserts - this is a celebration dessert. It is worth it to get the extra hot fudge. And all the food is great. And the service is always spot on - quick refills of the humongous ice teas, soda's, etc. The appetizers are so great that if the idea of a meal bores you - just get a bunch of the wonderful appetizers ( if you like artichokes and they are making them - GET IT. And to manage the noise - ask for a booth in the back. Oh yes, if you have an adorable dog like we do ( Zoie the Bassett) enjoy your meal outside. You won't be sorry."

Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, United States",395,752,957,3.0,7/8/2012,"standard cheesecake factory. huge portions, great service.  and heavy calories :) unless you order from the  ... I have lately stopped going to the SF cheesecake factory and gone here. It's not worth the hassle waiting in line for 30 minutes feeling like a sardine in a can in san francisco. the wait time here is quick and plenty of parking."
Pat L.,"Santa Rosa, United States",4,50,,3.0,8/1/2013,"For everyone who avoids the Cheesecake Factory because they value their waistline - avoid no more!!!  They now have a   and it is quite good  with many choices.  I would never, never go their because of the unhealthy food but was forced to go as a cooperative gesture.  What a nice surprise.  I had the Chinese chicken salad, my friend the Chicken salad sandwich and another friend the enchiladas - all under 590 calories.  Not exactly Weight watchers but good enough for us.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for entering the quest for smaller behinds!!"
Barbara S.,"Mill Valley, United States",115,532,59,4.0,7/3/2013,"My hubby and I discovered recently that they have a ""skinny"" menu. It has a lot of offerings and none of the dishes have more than 500 something calories. The two dishes we've been sharing are the shrimp creole and the seared ahi tuna salad platter. Both are delicious and very satisfying. We usually split both. I don't normally go for chains, but their   has won us over. Lots of tasty sounding things are on that menu and we plan to work our way through it."
Adriana L.,"Millbrae, United States",0,51,8,3.0,26/7/2012,"Good ol' Cheesecake Factory! Nice place to go when you can't make up your mind what you want to eat. You will surely find something in their huge menu and the addition of the   was nice so you'd feel less guilty wolfing down that fat cheesecake at the end. LOL. Nice service, meh food but you know it's ALL about the Cheesecake!!! My favorites: Godiva, Cookie Dough, Original w/fresh strawberries...mmmm!"
Jazzy H.,"Rodeo, United States",46,6,,4.0,7/8/2012,"It was my first time here and maybe I just expected more that's my reason for giving 4 stars, but the food was good and our server was awesome. Also, the   was a plus, plus."
