Vy W.,"Concord, CA",1,14,3,1.0,9/25/2016,"The food is terrible. My husband ordered the chicken biscuit, and he got very sick. We called the restaurant and told them about the situation. The lady who picked up the phone didn't say sorry to us at all. All she said was : "" thank you, I will let them know. Bye"". What type of customer service is that?  We will never be back here."
Jessica M.,"Sonoma, CA",11,14,8,5.0,7/15/2016,Great food and service... And pet friendly! I swear by the crab wonton appetizers but I have yet to eat something I hated at this place!
Anny N.,"San Rafael, CA",1,41,2,4.0,3/20/2017,"This is me and my boyfriend's favorite place to dine and date! Whether it be lunch or dinner or Sunday brunch, we always have a good time here, The food is good and the cheesecakes are great. Servers are usually nice and efficient. Sometimes there are servers though that need improvement. Other than that, we try to enjoy our dates :)"
Nicole R.,"Cotati, CA",0,16,2,3.0,4/19/2017,"As a vegetarian it is incredibly hard to order here. Some meals you would assume are vegetarian, like a bean burrito are not...the black beans are made with chicken broth. Almost every pasta dish, meat or not has chicken broth in the sauce somewhere. It was really crazy last time, the server was even laughing because everything I asked about had chicken broth in it. Why????? Ended up getting a salad, which was good, but would like the option to get a good vegetarian burrito or vegetarian pasta. Bottom line, please take the chicken broth out of the beans at least!"
Tammy R.,"Sonoma, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/15/2017,"The service here is horrid.  We were a party of six and were told our table would be available in ten minutes.  One hour later, after 15 parties of two and four were seated, with a very rude, uncaring and snarky hostess giving us a line, we gave up and left. Don't try to eat here if you are expecting polite, caring service that cares about the customers. You will not find it here."
Jon L.,"Petaluma, CA",74,5,1,5.0,8/18/2016,Service was great and the food we ordered was excellent. I got a double bacon cheeseburger cooked medium rare which was surprisingly amazing. My kids absolutely loved there milkshakes.It was crazy busy for a Thursday night.
Sophia C.,"Long Beach, CA",120,11,14,1.0,7/31/2017,Went in for a full slice of cheesecake for the sale... Was given an OLDER SMALLER piece of cheesecake... When given the cheesecake (to go mind you) I had to ask for a bag and for utensils. I asked nicely and the idiot started muttering right in front of other customers and myself... I walked out and don't know if I will ever come back...  HALF OFF MY ASS
Valeria O.,"Richmond, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/27/2017,"My boyfriend and I went here with a couple of friends and we all had separate checks. His check came out to be $41.27 so he gave the waitress $40 in cash and he gave her his card to pay the rest which was $1.27. When he checked his bank account it turns out that the waitress paid the whole check with his card and we have no idea what happened to the $40 dollars. We called two times to complain but they said ""they would call back"" yet we haven't gotten a call back. He still wants his $40 dollars back !!!!!!!"
Daisy L.,"San Rafael, CA",0,4,,3.0,8/14/2017,"The best part of my Cheesecake Factory experience is definitely the cheesecake. I look forward to eating dessert overtime I come here. Overall the service is mediocre and the dishes run on the heavier and salter side. If I could recommend a dish, it would the the Pasta DaVinci. It was a nice balance of flavors though, I have realized that they sometimes saturate the pasta with too much oil. If you only come to the Cheesecake Factory, just for the cheesecake, I would definitely rate that 4 stars but the overall dining experience only merits 3."
Fitry R.,"San Rafael, CA",44,5,,5.0,6/21/2016,"I don't really write reviews on Yelp but... 5 stars for the server named Scott. He is an excellent server and a very very very very friendly man. He takes care of his customer like his numero uno priority! And for The Cheesecake Factory itself, I LOVE THEIR FOOD. ps. the only downside is that the lighting is way too dark! my boyfriend and I were struggling reading the menu and to enjoy looking at our food"
Mary B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,83,26,5.0,6/26/2016,"After seeing the stars and reviews on Cheesecake I was not too sure how our meal would be. It was only a 15 min wait. We went to the bar and got a drink and found 3 seats at the bar and they buzzed us shortly after. We were seated outside on a lovely evening. We had the nicest waiter and the food came faster than I expected for how busy they were. I ordered the Thai salmon and it could not have been cooked any better than it was. It was crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside and it was a huge piece. My husband had the chicken and biscuits and said it was great, as well. I can not wait to go back and try something else. Good job!!"
Gerhard W.,"Santee, CA",0,39,8,2.0,3/28/2016,"First of, I like the Cheesecake Factory, and we've been to several locations but today was really disappointing.  It was Monday after 2pm and it wasn't very full, but yet our server took a long time coming by our table. Unfortunately, it didn't get better from here.  Our server really messed up our orders, and none of the dishes came out as ordered.  The manager tried to compensate, but after waiting more than 50 minutes for a burger, we were displeased.  The icing on the cake was, that we were charged extra for substitution items, which pumped up the check quite a bit. After, yet again waiting and pointing the mistakes out, we could finally leave, dissatisfied, after a long time, without being probably fed."
Brian Divina M.,"Oakland, CA",43,26,13,1.0,11/21/2016,"Went there last night for a birthday party dinner for my wife (11/21The hostess told us to arrive 15 to 20 minutes early for our party of 11. When we got there, she told us the wait was more than an hour. She was very rude, unhelpful, and didn't seem to care that we were without a place to have dinner. I will never eat there. Ever."
C L.,"Los Angeles, CA",229,6,1,5.0,2/15/2017,"I love coming her because of the speedy and wonderful service. Scott is the best waiter EVER! He is always so attentive. It doesn't matter if I bring 20 people or just two, he always gives the best service (even if it's late at night). I feel lucky to know that this is somewhere I can go to have a really positive experience. Hats off to Scott and the front desk staff at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Gayk G.,"San Rafael, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/5/2017,"This is our goto place for lunch and dinner. Gracious interior and delicious food, drinks and desserts. I highly recommend this restaurant. Prices are very reasonable."
Lexie L.,"San Dimas, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/5/2017,"I had my best Cheesecake Factory experience yet at this location. The food was fantastic and the service from our waiter, Scott, was even better. Scott was most definitely the best waiter we've had at any Cheesecake Factory location. We'll definitely be returning whenever we're in the area, and I recommend you do the same!"
Francisco C.,"Richmond, CA",0,17,2,1.0,8/6/2016,"Just go to concord.. this place is pretty gross and if you eat here you're pretty gross lol.. literally everything was dirty as hell. I got lucky with this trip out to this restaurant and ate nothing.. I don't think I'll be eating at any Cheesecake Factory due to this experience cause now I assume that's why they keep the lights so low.. also I was just outside the restaurant holding the pager thing waiting and walked in after I got tired of watching the people that were before me, eating their entrees and they said that she just paged me and deleted my name, then basically said I was too far away for it to pick me up. Cool. Then the nasty happened so basically I'm feeling fuck Cheesecake Factory.  Oh yeah I almost forgot there was a waitress who's walked around and bumped into me and moved my chair when she passed by, and I looked over and got no acknowledgement, then when she walked around; she did the same thing to my dad! I don't know if she just didn't like our ""look"" or whatever but what an asshole, she was just mean for no reason, but I'll take her body language's advice into consideration and never come here again. She was blonde and ""chubby"" with pepper shakers on.. lol and I'm fat too but I don't carry myself around like a jerk.."
Helen G.,"Petaluma, CA",36,188,219,1.0,5/12/2017,"Came here tonight with my three children for our Mothers Day celebration since I will not be with my son on Sunday and let me tell you, the biggest disappointment and let down. My 10 year old chose this place as he loves the food here but it was one disappointment after the other. Our drinks took forever and didn't come out u till our food came, two appetizers that we ordered never made it to the table but were on our receipt of course! My steak was super cold and the food was completely off tonight! We went through three different servers since they had to go on breaks and they had zero communication with each other. No one knew if the bread had eggs, if the pasta had egg or the burger bun! What a let down! We normally are fans of this particular location and eat here pretty frequently but tonight was such a let down and I just felt like tonight's experience ruined our little celebration."
Anne J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",89,143,56,4.0,8/9/2015,"The food is delicious. However, service is very spotty. You can have a great waiter, or one that could care less.  Unfortunately, tonight we got one that didn't seem to like her job and had no desire to be there.  As for us, we drove 2 hours to get to the restaurant and then waited 40 minutes to get a table.  (We were starving as we hadn't eaten all day.)  However, once we were finally seated, we waited another 20 minutes and never saw a waitress. We had to get up and find a waitress!  When one finally arrived, we asked her to bring lots of bread, water and a passion ice tea.  That could be done in about 5 minutes, right?  No such luck. People who had a different waitress and were seated long after we were, got their drinks and appetizers before our waitress ever came to our table!  I had to get up from the table to go find a waitress, then had to get up again to ask for a manager, when our waitress never showed.   The manager (Julian?) was very apologetic and compt'd us dessert and even delivered a free soup and salad (that we didn't eat), but the service never got any better.  Our waitress had ruined what was supposed to be a special night out.  By the way, our total time from arrival to leaving was over 2 hours to 2 1/2 hours.    I love their avocado egg rolls ($11), chicken madeira ($18), and bang, bang chicken and shrimp ($18). I think everyone loves their extensive menu, but make sure you get a great waiter or no matter how good the food is, it won't be worth the visit."
Dkac C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,44,,4.0,1/28/2017,Food still good with huge portions.  Gabe at the bakery counter....thanks!   U r awesone
