Kenzie E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,3,5.0,7/28/2017,Everything is so good! Can never finish my food though because it's a lot! I've gone twice and had great service!
Carol M.,"Windsor, CA",3,66,,1.0,11/22/2016,"Wow! Been going to this location for years. It represents a bit of a 'ritual' when we are in that area. We always like to go there to be able to bring some amazing Cheesecake home. Went there Sunday night with 3 other people. The wait was relatively short. We asked to be placed in booth as we do grow tired of a table that isn't picked up or cleared during the course of the meal. No booth when there were several unoccupied. But, we have always overlooked this as the Chicken Bellagio is so unique and the Artichoke appetizer is back on the menu. The Food overall is so good! The menu so diverse with so many choices!!!!! We were seated, our wait person introduced himself. We ordered the Calamari and Artichoke as appetizers. Both were delicious. No change in plates, from tiny bread plates with butter wrappers. Are we expected to reach over each other to eat or dip into the sauces? We asked (after I returned a dirty knife) politely, this happens, for other plates. We were asked 'what size'? These were delivered by another waitperson filling in for the first one. The other plates weren't removed. There we go again with a table so crowded, with water, beverages, appetizers, bread plates, silverware that there was no room. We were trying not to get upset by any of this, just ignored it and wanted to focus on enjoying ourselves.  On top of everything else, and it wasn't packed in there, our meals came out and were plopped on the table with this mess by someone else who wouldn't give us time to move the other things. Just set them on the edge of the table and scurried off.  We hadn't had a chance to eat the appetizers. We aren't chronic complainers, don't except a crumbsweeping person. I don't expect a plate of hot food to be handed across my friend's face to reach me. It table was so crowded that we were trying not to knock anything over. I tried 'stacking' a few plates up to make room hoping that someone would notice and didn't until we said something again. By the time we finished the appetizers the food was tepid. We ordered several pieces of that Wonderful Cheesecake to go. We had to plead to get containers for our unfinished dinners. The person brought out small containers which wouldn't have held the food. I asked for larger containers. The waitperson 'smirked' and asked what size do you want? Most waitstaff personnel look at a table and assess these things. We left, still having enjoyed one another, but the experience required much overlooking. For a place so popular, one would have hoped that the 'ratings' would reflect this. After years of overlooking these things, just had to say something!"
Elizabeth S.,"Windsor, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/8/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite spots,however the past few visits have been less than desired. Menu items have been modified and service is slow-really slow. Chefs especially are not on point as items -too frequently -are made wrong. Tonight was the last time Dinning at Cheesecake Factory. We walked in and the atmosphere seemed a bit unorganized and should have known our fate when our greeter escorted us to our table-but there was no table. He had to go get a table and set it up while we stood in the isle.  I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with Swiss cheese and bell peppers. It came 30 minutes later with no cheese and no bell peppers. Waitress-took it back and it was remade again-wrong.  I received my sandwich 25  minutes later with bread so hard-my steak knife could not cut through it. I sent it back asking for fresh bread and it came back 20 minutes later undercooked without cheese or bell peppers --again! How can a cheesesteak sandwich be so difficult? Manager came over and said sorry-but nothing else. Luis-was less than professional. He did not offer anything to relieve the situation nor was he willing to accommodate now a 1-1.5 hour dinner wait-a solution. I had to ask to have item removed. The professionalism we once enjoyed is no longer present."
Miami S.,"San Francisco, CA",144,252,28,4.0,4/28/2016,"First, CF has gone to great lengths to lighten up their menu. There are myriad healthy items  (lei Lettuce Wraps - yum!) It is a fun place to gather with pals and nosh. We like to sit outside on a summer's night. Fun. Second, Marin has a dearth of restaurants...hence, many are full, loud, packed and noisy. CF can be a cacophony of The Loud Family types ..."
Jennifer M.,"American Canyon, CA",3,31,15,4.0,6/4/2016,Good service tonight.  Loved the Hibachi steak.  But my husband's hamburger was over cooked and fried were cold and hard.
Alexandra S.,"Folsom, CA",494,126,123,4.0,2/23/2015,"We have attempted this Cheescake Factory twice now, and eaten there once. Not the place to go if you don't want a longgg wait! The first time we went the wait was too long so we left. The second time, we decided to stick the 45 minute wait out.  Pros: -Good food. I LOVE the Avocado Egg Rolls! I get those every single time I go to the Cheesecake Factory. They are AMAZING. -Good drinks. I've liked every drink I've tried there.  -Endive Salad is also delicious.  -Big menu with lots of options. Also a whole ""Skinny"" menu with low-calorie options. -Lots of vegetarian options.  -Fresh, warm bread with butter is served at every table while you wait for your food. -Pretty speedy service, especially considering how PACKED the place always is.  -I like the atmosphere and lighting. Somehow seems intimate even though it's crazy busy and packed.  -In a shopping center, so you can always go early and do some shopping :)  -Lots of parking. Cons: -Shopping center closed on 7...on the weekend! So if you're going to dinner, don't expect to be able to browse the shops while waiting. -Like I mentioned before, LONG waits.  -They don't take reservations. So no way really to avoid a long wait.  -Not a very large Cheesecake Factory. -Very crowded all the times I've been there. Not a big waiting area either so it's just a very packed feeling. Despite the crowds and long waits, I love the food SO much that of course I'll be back :) Just don't go if you're in a rush...it will not be a quick meal."
Lancaster S.,"Milpitas, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2016,"I'm not the type to write reviews at all but, I just had the most awful service ever. We walked in asked for a table and the hostess said 1 hour to 2 hrs. Okay, fine I wait. They finally call us after an hour and when I walk in the door she says ""Oh my god, it was about time"". I let it go and decide to enjoy our dinner. Our server was Ted he was great but, it seemed like they were either short staffed or he was seriously ignoring us. He took drink orders and didn't offer appetizer. So, we just decided to ask him to take our order of appetizer. He left and came back 20 min later to take our food order . We finish our appetizer and we had to ask for refills and more bread.  Our food arrives, we decide to wait for our bread and drinks. It never arrived. We just decided to eat our meal. Many workers including management walk by multiple times. No one ever bothered to ask if we were okay or if we needed anything. The next time we saw our server after asking for bread and drinks was when he drop off the check. I work in the hospitality industry myself and I can understand a busy day but, he and all the staff completely ignored us. I left a tip just because I know servers live out of tips but I will never be coming here and I will tell my friends and family about my experience. Mediocre service no thank you ill rather go to a McDonalds if that what I was looking for ."
Ricardo R.,"Novato, CA",1,2,1,1.0,2/29/2016,"This location sucks at getting your order  correct. They try and charge 15 dollars for every dish and then only serve you an appetizer portion. Make sure if you are ordering for pick up that you check your Oder IN STORE before leaving. Worst location I have been to. I ordered the white chicken chillie and got about 2 scoops of the soup in my to go PLATE, couldn't even give me a bowl. And the rice that came with it was a joke. They wouldn't refund me my money ."
Linda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",497,349,855,3.0,4/6/2014,"I know i know.. Its a chain restaurant but it was a place my step mother in law could eat at since shes picky lol Service wise was very slow. Considering we came at 12pm for sunday brunch... Surprisingly was not busy but service was super slow. We had to repeat our request to our waiter twice. And to add to the amazingly slow service, he got my order incorrectly. Pretty sad but i guess i cannot expect too much from a chain restaurant -.- One thing the waiter was right about though. Their lunch portions are big and their dinner portions are even bigger. Although the portions are pretty filling it was still the standard ok go to food when you have step in laws who are ubber picky about what they eat. Meaning it mist be american food otherwise she wouldnt dare touch it lol"
Steve M.,"Sonoma, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2017,Service was as bad as I have ever experienced. Food was great. But that is only half of the experience. I will never go back to this Cheese Cake Factory. From the coffee being served at different times to the meals were delivered 5 minutes apart. Complained to Manager. I never have left a negative comment on a restaurant but this was ridiculous . All tables in our area were laughing at how bad the service was.
Paul C.,"Petaluma, CA",49,7,,2.0,7/29/2016,"Often when you walk in here and find an empty table near the bar, particularly at lunchtime, it's like hitting the lottery ... Until today. Damn, one bitty with too many tables and zero dental plan! Lunch was good, but as I sit here writing this, we continue to wait for our check. What's happening at the Factory?"
Kate W.,"Napa, CA",96,11,12,1.0,12/19/2016,This place has the worst food and service!!!!! BEWARE THIS PLACE IS AWFUL. I waited 45 minutes for a burger that was overdone no cheese and couldn't hold the pickles when I told them I was allergic. The fix a new bun and a piece of cold cheese. When I asked to see a manger she really could have cared less. STAY AWAY! This is the worst experience. I will NEVER COME BACK.
Denise M.,"San Francisco, CA",2,9,1,1.0,5/9/2016,They Didn't give any utensils for the take-out. There was a piece of wire in my pasta and bread given was hard as a rock.
Jennifer C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",158,177,20,5.0,3/10/2015,Thank you Emily(manager) for calling me & checking to see if I received my gift card.  Shows cheesecake truly makes an effort in customer service.    I had ordered 2 desserts to go...the young man repeats my order right I go home & it was 2 different desserts....wasn't mad at all cause its not worth it.  I had to let them know that they may have gave it too another person or is going to.  The manager took my address to give me a gift card :-)
S L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,4,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Unfortunately, my group wanted to stop here last night on the way home from the airport. It has been some time since I've eaten at a CF....not a big fan of chain mall food. It certainly hasn't changed in the years, a 20-30 minute way, bad food and you are looking at a 2 hour meal time.  My friend ordered the burger which was chewy and way too salty (this from a girl who salts everything). The fries tasted of old grease/oil. None of us had more than 2.  The Orange chicken was dry and chewy (yes just like the burger) The rice was sticky and crunchy (like plastic).  Unfortunately ,the only thing I wanted was soup, the Clam Chowder didn't sound appealing, they only have one soup a day even in the rainy winter months. I simply opted for Ginger Ale and a wait until we got home.  Sadly, the food was so disappointing, the service took forever, that  we opted to skip desert and get the heck out of this place. Bocca Pizza a few doors down looked a bit more appealing. Again, mall food. Blech!"
Kwi V.,"Windsor, CA",12,36,,4.0,10/10/2016,Cheesecake Factory is consistently good. I love the Shepards Pie and the Spicy Cashew Chicken.
Katherine S.,"Vacaville, CA",4,60,,2.0,7/19/2016,"I typically love cheesecake factory's I mean cheesecake is my favorite thing in the world, however the service is terrible. We had a young girl named Alia or something along the lines but she never smiled and she seemed ready to be off of work. I don't appreciate paying money for attitude, I can get that for free on the streets. I won't be back to this location but the food was great and the cheesecake was even better. So hats off to the chefs for this one. They get the two stars."
Brian C.,"Sausalito, CA",0,53,2,4.0,11/8/2016,"The food is consistently good as is the service.  Unfortunately the place is way too DARK! Check out all the diners in booths using their phones for light. When I complained I was told ""corporate"" controls the lighting.  Too bad It cost them a star."
Les T.,"St Helena, CA",208,53,181,4.0,2/23/2016,"Stopped for a quick Happy Hour bite at the bar. Buddy ordered the nachos and that was pretty tasty. I particularly liked the chips they used. I ordered the Happy Hour burger and was pleasantly surprised how big it was and how yummy. For dessert I went with the Kalua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake and it was deelish! So much goodness in each bite. For sures I'll definitely order that again. Service was okay, not really attentive but also not too slow where I wanted to chop my arm off and eat it. Overall a good experience and quality value food, so I'll be back."
C S.,"Sacramento, CA",230,69,41,4.0,9/29/2016,"Good cheesecake. Came in around 9pm on a Sunday night. The place was pretty slow however, there was a group of girls that decided to cut us in line. The staff didn't notice although I did feel a little off-put by their acknowledgement. Overall the cheesecake we ordered seemed to be fresh and what we were looking for. Once in a year experience, a little too sweet for my liking but what do you expect for cheesecake!"
