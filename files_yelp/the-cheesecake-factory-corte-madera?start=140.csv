Eyreka G.,"Emeryville, CA",1,10,5,1.0,10/5/2016,"I wonder why Cheesecake Factory asked me to contact them..... I did and no response. I will still go to the other Cheesecake Factory locations ( I even had my daughter's 13th birthday celebration with her friends at the San Francisco location years ago) I have a few great Cheesecake Factory memories at other locations  but I WILL NEVER GO TO THE CORTE MADRE location because of the lack of service, concern and disappointing food.  I hope other people read my review and scroll down to a lot of other yelpers that have disappointed by this location.  We live in the Bay and have a lot of great restaurants that will respect our time, money and give better service. What restaurant forgets a babies French Fries........ Cheesecake Corte Madre."
Diana H.,"Los Angeles, CA",160,61,23,1.0,6/11/2016,"30min wait to be seated. Walked to our table, stood to wait while they got the chair. 45min wait for food. Did not give enough appetizer plates. The party of 9 next to us got 3 bread baskets, our party of 8 got one. They came later than we did, but received their food earlier.  Appetizers were better than entrees. Most of their meats were dry (chicken, steak). Large portions, you'll definitely have leftovers.  In a mall area with plenty of parking. Waiters/waitresses were polite when we saw them.  Will not be back. Lacking basic customer service or maybe they're understaffed during peak hours."
Tempestt G.,"Salida, CA",69,1,4,5.0,2/19/2017,Giving this place 4 stars because of the awesome experience I had last night. I came into the bar and was promptly greeted by Jake. His service and drinks were impeccable. Thanks to him I will be coming back more often!
Daniel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",287,209,50,4.0,11/16/2014,"First, I have to say I resisted this restaurant for a long time.  I went to the original Cheesecake Factory when it was a small place in Beverly Hills, and they always had OK food at inflated prices. The new restaurants, big and a bit gaudy, always had ridiculously long wait times with no reservations and those stupid beeper things that meant you had to stay within 100 feet when they could be using text messaging to let you know when your table is ready. I had some bad experiences here early on, freezing in the back round room while waiters changed and forgot to bring food, etc. All that said--the food is actually quite good, and almost always enough for two meals--so you can take half home. The menu, of course, is so big that everyone can find something that interests them, italian, mexican, american, asian... vegetarian, cheese, meat, fish... I've yet to have a meal that wasn't good here. Not the very best, but always good. The fish 'n chips are standouts. And this is the big thing--there are very, very few late night restaurants in Marin. Most of the county closes down by 9pm at the latest. The earliest this restaurant closes is 10pm on Sunday nights. Monday through Thursday it's open till 11pm, and Friday's it's midnight. That's when the Cheesecake factory is best--late in the evening. You don't have to fight for parking (not enough mall parking in the day). You don't have to wait for an hour or more for a table as you do during more popular hours. ----- IMPORTANT LATE NIGHT TIP: I went there after a premiere of a movie I co-wrote and act in,   and arrived on a Thursday at 10:50pm.  The man at the front desk told me the kitchen was closed. But it doesn't really close till 11, and with a nice, ""pretty please"" from me he let me sit down, and the waitress was fine with it, as was the kitchen.  So if you arrive close to the posted closing time, ask nicely to be seated even if they try to dissuade you (which is kind of odd, but oh, well)."
Victoria C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,57,,1.0,7/24/2016,"THIS IS THE LAST TIME I GO HERE! Went here because we have a one year old and if I remember, its family friendly.  The food always comes out mis-executed.  I ordered the shepard's pie...I know, I know, not an everyday dish but oh man, it was 10x worst than I could ever think.  It was basically  big wads of ground beef, raw carrots, a couple tomatoes and a smear of very dry mash potato (tasted old).  dear lord it was disgusting.  To think I used to think this place was fancy as a kid.  Ugh..."
Kimberley M.,"Willits, CA",75,33,,1.0,4/9/2017,"The Waitress and hostess were incredibly rude and unprofessional. We were put in a freezing, cold, windy corner outside, they refused to put us by a heater, we had to ask multiple times for silverware and plates. We were waiting for a chance to buy cheesecake and never happened. No one ever came back around to refill our drinks or even ask if we needed anything. All around bad experience"
Lauren D.,"Marin County, CA",0,82,45,1.0,10/22/2016,Today was one of the worst experiences I've had here. The food is normally consistent but today everything went wrong from the service to the food right down to soda being spilled on my jacket and being burned by the plate my order came out on. After finishing up my meal with one hand resting on a pack of ice delivered by the waiter we were shocked when a manager didn't even come over to apologize. Will rethink coming back. It's too bad because it's a family favorite.
Mark L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,41,,5.0,4/21/2017,"We love this Cheesecake Factory.  Always have a friendly and helpful staff and the food is always very good.  Orders are taken right away and food comes out hot and within a good time.  Atmosphere is awesome of course with all of the high ceilings, booths, and large columns.  Love to sit on the patio when it's warm enough."
Rotem T.,"San Jose, CA",23,22,2,3.0,5/29/2016,"We came to the cheesecake and they sat us immediately so that was nice. The waitress was so sweet but....we ordered the children's pasta and the waitress brought 2 cups of apple juice ""on her"" instead of one. The problem was the content was 80% water in two of them. It's the first time anybody offered to do this for us and now I know why! Usually try bring one and it real apple juice. I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms with the wine sauce I've eaten it many times and this time there was no wine in it. It was dark very thick sauce as a pregnant woman with cravings it was disappointing. All the rest of the experience was good! Still love this restaurant very much!!"
Foodivore ..,"Berkeley, CA",9,17,112,4.0,2/18/2015,"FOOD...is mostly American, steaks, burgers, salads, but they also have Italian and Asian inspired dishes. Great portions, large variety of entrees to choose from.  SERVICE: is hit or miss. Depends on the server you get and the time you go or whether or not it's busy. AMBIANCE: Fancy bistro with a casual atmosphere. MUST TRYS: Chicken Madeira Asian lettuce wraps  Strawberry shortcake (dessert) Strawberry lemonade"
Amy Lynn C.,"Pacifica, CA",4,24,7,3.0,8/7/2016,"Pre ordered a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake with extra raspberry sauce on the side plus a bday choco block. Wasn't ready when I got there and i asked to see the cake before I paid because the workers were literally manhandling them as they were pulling them out of the fridge. I asked why there wasn't any sauce and the employee said I pour it myself so it doesn't get get messy. Because of what she said I asked for 1 more container of raspberry sauce and thought that would be cool. Few things I noticed after I left.. The last sauce I asked for, container was 1/5 full no joke. She swirled it so it looked full when she gave it to me. I know because I looked at the other 2 before paying. I also realized they charged me $10 for ""1 pint"" of sauce. Knowing they don't add sauce to a cake that requires it and then charged you for a punt of it separately, WHERE'S MY EXTRA THAT I NOT ONLY ORDERED BUT PAID FOR?! JIP, JIP, JIP!!!!!!!!!!!  mlm"
Kimberly D.,"San Rafael, CA",299,46,47,2.0,9/6/2015,Service was extremely slow. Food was alright. I've tasted better Cheesecake Factory at other locations.
Melissa M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",20,3,,2.0,4/12/2016,"Terrible service! The server left our check, then disappeared. 20 minutes later we went up front to ask if someone could take our money. We could have had a free lunch. I don't like how close the tables are together. No private conversation happening there! My salad was really good, though. Next time I will get it to go!"
Donald B.,"Novato, CA",1,13,,2.0,2/9/2017,I ordered the Chinese chicken salad with mandarin oranges and was severely disappointed.The amount of crispy white noodles was overwhelming at least five times as much as shown in a photograph of same salad online. The other ingredients supposed to be in a salary diminished by the presence of this useless ingredient. I feel useless when it is in excess in fact I took more than a fistful and put it in my bread dish. In my mind this $15 salad was greatly diminished by cheap ingredients
Onesmilingteacher ..,"Orangevale, CA",0,63,,2.0,4/17/2016,"If you want a waiter who thinks he is a pretty boy and would rather flirt with customers rather than do his job, then GO to this Cheesecake Factory location.  His name is Joel, just ask for him by name.  He is by far the worst waiter I have ever encountered.  He didn't even bring my water when requested it.  He was too busy doing other things, like flirting with the 20 somethings, I had to ask a different waitress to bring my water after 15 minutes.   The two stars are because my boyfriend and myself loved our food.  I had flatbread, and my boyfriend had french dip.  Other than that it was a horrible experience!"
Shelly S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/21/2017,"I loved the service my family received! The servers name is Scott, he went far above and beyond to make our time great! The food was fantastic! And Scott's touch made it that much better! Thank you for the heated wet napkins too!!!!!!"
Josh E.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,4.0,2/18/2017,Started out dinner a little rocky just because it took us a few minutes to get our drinks. But oh man did they make up for it! Scott was beyond attentive and his recommendations were spot on! I would recommend this particular establishment to anyone looking for a great meal and some great service.
Nadia M.,"Novato, CA",7,43,317,5.0,12/19/2015,"I love, love and love this place. Even my kids now just want to eat there. The only thing which bothers me lot is the long long wait. I think they should serve an appetizer or samples during that wait. Otherwise this is the best place to eat healthy food."
Dina R.,"Gulfport, MS",9,56,2,3.0,5/17/2016,"Good food, decent drinks, cool service. Hate that I'm sitting next to a table with a family... their kid is playing a movie on a loud ass iPad. At least have you kid wear headphones. Why are simple common things not so simple and common to people?"
Noe-Siomara R.,"San Rafael, CA",1,6,2,5.0,7/5/2016,"came in with a party of 7(+an infant), our waiter Scott made our whole experience very pleasant! He was so attentive to each of us and very friendly!! Food was delicious as well!"
