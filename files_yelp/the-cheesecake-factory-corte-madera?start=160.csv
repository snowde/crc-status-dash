Michael M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/15/2017,"Service was amazing. Particularly the waiter named Scott. He was very nice, attentive, and made the night even more enjoyable."
Monica K.,"Martinez, CA",42,205,268,5.0,9/7/2015,"This location has never let me down. The service is always good, along with the food. I have come to the conclusion that most of their desserts are a little too rich for me, so I will normally order their strawberry shortcake for dessert, which comes on a sweet biscuit, with vanilla ice cream and strawberries.  You can never go wrong with their humongous salads."
Allie P.,"Mill Valley, CA",130,281,259,2.0,6/12/2014,"I have never really understood why this place is soooo popular. I mean it must be because of convenience, or maybe it's the 20page menu that it has to offer? Lord knows when you have so many different dishes from different places it has to all be good - because you really can perfect a 20 page menu.  With all this said. The menu is Average. The atmosphere a bit Vegas - you know the fake New York New York, Balagio,MGM etc. Infact, this place is just that. A giant Vegas all housed in one building known as the Cheese Cake Factory."
Stephanie S.,"Vallejo, CA",25,104,130,5.0,4/17/2014,"I have to admit that cheesecake is one of my favorite things on earth and when I need to get my fix I come here or to Nation's. My friend and I were in Novato livin' it up at the DSW and decided to go to Sol Food in San Rafael but, as usual, there was a long stupid line out the door. We knew there was a Cheesecake factory nearby so we headed there. That was a good decision because we had the best experience.  1. We were seated immediately. 2. Our waiter SABRINA was amazing!(I put her name in caps just in case her boss sees this review) She was so friendly and sweet. 3. The food as usual was really good. Santorini farro salad, fried macaroni and cheese, factory nachos, and of course my cheesecake....so good. 4. Some random awesome guy came up to me and told me I was beautiful! I so needed to hear that. That night confirmed what I already know.. . the cheesecake factory is magic:)"
Martin B.,"Mill Valley, CA",4,89,58,1.0,6/14/2016,"Been a while since we came , I want to give it the benefit of doubt with some larger parties being in but the service was bad. Sitting for over 1hr to be served cold food. Something tells me that the current employment situation in Marin is hurting the lower paid staff who rely on tips for wages. I will come back again hoping it was a one off."
Alisa L.,"Albany, CA",236,27,47,5.0,6/14/2015,Service was nice and quick . My fettuccine was really tasty . I ordered lunch size they have it till 5 pm . It is a little smaller then regular dish and I was able to eat  desert as well . As a desert I ordered pineapple cheesecake and I loved it . Over at all $53 lunch for 2 people was good .
Jillian C.,"Napa, CA",70,7,5,4.0,6/20/2015,"Awesome place, the best cheesecake ever! I recommend ultimate red velvet or the lemon meringue, you can't go wrong in either or of these orders :p"
Ame V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",52,17,2,3.0,6/14/2016,"The food is always tasty and pretty quick, but the evening lighting is TERRIBLE!!! It is SO dark that you can't even see...my son even got nauseated! Please fix that!!!"
Sandra P.,"San Francisco, CA",440,744,2583,1.0,5/24/2015,"I went back here after over 4 years of boycotting the bad experience that I had last time. I have to say, it's definitely not up to par with other cheesecake factory. We were seated within 20 minutes on a Saturday night which was a miracle. Our waiter immediately took our drink orders and deliver them promptly. Being on weight watchers we ordered off the skinny licious menu. We ordered a mozzarella flatbread, and then we each ordered a salad: I got the Asian salad and my boyfriend ordered the Mexican tortilla salad. This is where it all started to go bad. Our waiter came back and told us they were completely out of flatbreads. You would think he might've known. However since he didn't, we changed our order to shrimp spring rolls. They were just okay. Not much shrimp and one of the rolls was not put together properly and just fell apart. Next up was our salads and the waiter came over to ask me if I minded if the dressing was on the salad. I told him of course I minded because I needed to have the dressing on the side as I indicated to him when I ordered. We waited an additional 20 minutes while they redid my salad. The salads were good: I can't say they weren't! But again this place is not customer service friendly. They gather a crowd and they know they will so they don't have to put much into it. I won't be back for probably another four years, if ever."
Jacqueline B.,"Hercules, CA",49,29,11,2.0,3/6/2016,"I give this place two stars for their service. The service was awesome. We were greeted appropriately and timely seated. Our food came out fast too.  Problem with the Cheesecake Factory is they don't put the extra effort in to their food. Our appetizers were terrible. The beer battered fries, the batter was good but the fries weren't cooked! The Dynamite Shrimp were so skimpy and so fishy that is was a turnoff. My kids chicken strips were well done and my burger was good but the fries were terrible. I mean pretty they were bad. Bad enough to where I just won't be coming back here or any other Cheesecake Factory. The food is not good in Walnut Creek either. I am only here because it's my sons birthday and he wanted to come to dinner here. I really hope the chefs shape up here. It's a shame because it really is a great environment."
Andy C.,"San Quentin, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2016,"Let me preface this review with two things: 1. I am in my 40's and have never had food at a restaurant that was so bad it had to be returned in all the years I've dined out. I'm not a nit picky person. 2. The experience tonight was so bad I opened a Yelp profile  Got seated at 6:30 for a couple burgers and a burrito (table of 3). After placing the order, which included two burgers, medium rare, no ""special"" sauce, we were served at 7:35. Both burgers were served covered in their nasty 1000 island based sauce. My son was starving, so he said he'd eat his. I sent mine back, politely. 25 minutes later, she brings back another burger that was well done, borderline burned. She asked if it was ok and I showed her that it was burnt and that I had asked for medium rare. Her response, "" Thats the kitchens mistake, there's nothing I can do about that"". I asked to speak with the manager after I paid the check and after explaining what happened, got the glazed donut stare from the 22 year old ""manager"". He says, ""well, I didn't charge you for your burger"", and just stares at me. At 8:30, we left with by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  If you ever have the urge to patronize this horrible restaurant, save your time and money and just go to McDonalds or even 7-11. The food will be the same quality but will be much cheaper and you will likely get much better customer service. If it wasn't for their cheesecake, this place would have folded years ago. Despite all the bad reviews, it still stays busy, which is why they don't even respond to all their negative feedback. Unreal..."
Christina A.,"Corte Madera, CA",1,25,6,2.0,1/11/2016,"I don't think there is a single appealing item on the menu that isn't ginormous in size and sopped in grease (and it's the largest menu ever).  It's always been a very long wait time (throughout the whole experience).  If this place didn't have a monopoly on restaurants in the entire shopping center, I am not sure they would still be around."
W B.,"Elk Grove, CA",22,19,6,1.0,3/25/2015,"I'm giving cheesecake factory in Corte Madera 1 star only because of a pizza I ordered. I ordered the calabrian pizza to go and when I got home, it was worse than store bought box style. Hopefully I can attach a photo of the pizza I received and I'll let you be the judge. I'm only giving a star because of the great customer service I received at the to go counter. So pizza eaters....beware. .."
Nick T.,"Novato, CA",13,53,41,4.0,2/15/2016,Bomb cheese cake but this place is way too overpriced for almost every single thing on the menu. If you are smart you will save most of your money and come in for an occasional slice of cheesecake & avoid everything else
Jenna C.,"Novato, CA",4,8,1,2.0,2/15/2015,"I have to say, this place is hit or miss. I always have something wrong when I come here. This time I came in for lunch, not very busy, and took an hour to get two salads. You've got to be joking! Last time they messed up 2 orders. The time before that they FORGOT someone's meal. And the worst part about it? The servers act like they could care less. Is this so typical that your servers don't think this is a bad thing? It's getting to the point that every time someone suggests this place, I groan. The only reason they get two stars is cause when the the food is correct, it's delicious."
Jacquelyn K.,"San Diego, CA",1,29,18,3.0,3/8/2016,"The food was great. I ordered the endive salad and the avocado egg rolls. My boyfriend ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I had wine and he had cucumber lemonade. All very tasty., I felt rushed. We did show up an hour before closing and our server did not offer us dessert, and just gave us the check. She said the dessert bar was closed. We wanted cake to-go but we didn't get it. We still have her a nice tip, but no cake. It takes two seconds to grab cake and throw it in a box."
G O.,"San Francisco, CA",280,102,1,4.0,5/8/2016,"I come here several times a year because honestly it is my favorite location out of all of them in the Bay Area. And came her today (Mother's Day) with a group of 10 of us and surprisingly it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Luckily there was a party of 10 prior to us that was sitting outside(where we wanted to sit) and they were finishing up right as I put my name on the list so our wait was about 20mins.  Our waiter Scott was GREAT! He was fast, made sure everything was great, and was really friendly. With a large group of people, they are always bound to mess something up but Scott only messed up one order which was minor (didn't sub a side that was requested).  Food wise, it wasn't mind blowing but good. I didn't have the teriyaki chicken but 4 out of 10 people did and it they complained about the chicken being burned. After they took the skin off, it was fine. Drinks were nice and strong as well.  Overall everything was great, and I will continue to come here."
Amy O.,"San Francisco, CA",274,1463,189,5.0,4/6/2014,"Excellent service. Perfect cappuccino. Carrot cake slice was huge, moist, and full of flavor. A midday stop for a sweet treat was perfect. Also have come here before for brunch on a Sunday, and sat in the bar area. Again, consistently great service. And we had a great late breakfast."
Sabrina B.,"Sonoma, CA",0,14,,3.0,1/9/2016,"The food is okay, what you'd expect from a chain restaurant. Butt, the waiter kept positioning himself between my table and the one next to me to take their orders, speak with them, etc...  his booty was in my face at least 5 times while I was trying to enjoy my break and my meal.  The situation pretty much ruined my $28 lunch - not okay."
Anthony F.,"Kentfield, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/20/2016,returned to give them a second chance .. and over a year later it's still as bad.. so nothing has been done to improve the shoddy service despite the negative reviews.  Poor management or lack of?  I won't be giving it third chance.
