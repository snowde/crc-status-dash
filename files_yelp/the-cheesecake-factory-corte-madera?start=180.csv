Rachel S.,"Sebastopol, CA",3,3,,1.0,11/28/2016,"Can't rate the food, never tried it. Walked in the door and seated within a minute. Several servers walked past multiple times and not a one acknowledge us to help us. Figured someone would have offered to get us drinks while server was busy.  We sat for 15 minutes and as soon as we got up the server came over. Only reason why he acknowledge us was we stood up from our table to leave.  By the way..the restaurant was only 30 percent occupied. Not impressed."
Joe P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",116,150,32,5.0,7/4/2015,This place is my wife's favorite place to eat. Especially intriguing because of the size of the menu and selection of cheesecake. I try to order something different and so far have not had anything bad. It's in a shopping mall which is cool if you've got some time to burn. On this particular occasion our waiter  was awesome. Can remember his name? But he needs a promotion.
Kylie H.,"San Rafael, CA",24,4,,5.0,5/3/2016,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory too many times to count and have for the most part had pleasant experiences. Tonight I went there and had the most PHENOMENAL service and waiter. Scott hands down went above and beyond to give us the best service I think I have ever had. Being a server myself, I could tell he had a lot of tables to handle, but he didn't let that effect his quality of service. He even brought us out warm towels at the end of our meal which was refreshing. Amazing service all around. If you go here ask for Scott to be your server!! :)"
Netalee K.,"San Francisco, CA",286,4,1,2.0,1/24/2016,"Dont get the crab hash!!! Ew the service is good , the staff is nice but the breakfast was horrible. why was there celery in my hash? weird!"
Kayla C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",16,16,4,2.0,3/12/2015,"The food is okay here, cheese cake is the star of course. Out of the times I have been here I have only had a decent waiter once. The other times they are not that great. On my most recent trip my friend found a bug in the salt shaker. (Picture.)"
Chris S.,"Petaluma, CA",88,3,3,1.0,11/8/2016,"I would give it zero if I could, they were out of avocado ""products"" because of an avocado shortage.... so we couldn't order any appetizers with it but they could put it on a more expensive burger if we would like. Also they were out of Ahi tuna which is hard to believe a place would run out of avocado and Ahi when that's in a ton of there meals. Food was ok at best, service was terrible. Couldn't read the menu because it was so dark and when asked to turn the lights up they said they couldn't it was a company policy to keep it dark."
Ashley J.,"Sacramento, CA",147,433,258,4.0,11/18/2014,"Updated review! Lunched here today with 2 of my favorite ladies (grandma and cousin), and the food and service was absolute perfection... // Jamaican black pepper shrimp was AHHHMAZING. Also had the peach Bellini cocktail (so good), a Long Island iced tea, the House White, crab cakes, sweet potato fries, and parmesan crusted salmon. On point. Hot. Tasty. Perfectly seasoned. Great portions."
Christine R.,"Marin County, CA",1630,1015,14273,4.0,10/16/2013,"Grabbed a bite to eat with a dear friend at the bar.  Besides the Dodgers defeating the Braves, winning the NLCS ticket, and causing me to puke a little, the evening was quite enjoyable.  Our samosas were served hot and tasty, yet too salty.  I was disappointed to find out they discontinued the Vietnamese tacos, they were scrumptious; please bring them back on the menu.  We had room for dessert, and Cheesecake promoted the S'mores cheesecake.  This decadent dessert is the perfect ending to a comforting meal; however, it's super rich.  You'll need a tall glass of milk to go with it; otherwise, take the rest home to enjoy with port.  Our bartender was super friendly and attentive.  Management:  I'd like to suggest the happy hour be extended to 7pm or start later around 4pm for working people.  Realistically, people get off after 5pm and commute through traffic.  By the time we get there (even locals), happy hour is over by 6pm.  Either way, I'm still grateful Cheesecake finally has a happy hour :-) P.S. Love their loaves of honey wheat brown bread, warm outta the oven...mmm...mmm...good!"
Peter B.,"San Anselmo, CA",229,9,,2.0,5/7/2016,"This is one place I would reserve for visiting family from the midwest. The over-the-top theme park level decor and ambiance make it seem like a concession at Disney World, and the crowds are mostly just as I described; large parties that are visiting families. The long waits at busy times and big plastic buzzers contribute to that effect. The food is competent, standard anywhere-in-America fare, but very caloric, huge portions, with large doses of butter and sugar to appeal to the mainstream. Still, it will appeal to older relatives and kids, visitors who are averse to culture shock, since this is not unlike any other in the chain, and they seem to be geared towards seating large parties. Charming to the unsophisticated."
Antonia M.,"Novato, CA",10,284,67,5.0,5/2/2015,The food was great and the service was fantastic.  You should definitely try the specialty cheesecakes while you are there.
Joe E.,"Mill Valley, CA",18,135,116,2.0,11/30/2014,"It's an interesting place.  Its like someone took Dennys, upscaled the menu while tripling its size and then quadrupled the portion sizes.  Well, except for their signature dish. I find it odd that the one dish on the menu that doesn't come in ginormous size is the cheesecake. I don't know if they still do it as I didn't experience it last time but it seems like they used to schedule their employees to never make it though a customers meal.  That is prior to the last time I went I don't recall making it through a meal with a single server. I always had two.  This of course causes service problems and while good for the chain (short term) is bad for the server and customer (immediately).  Long term, their scheduling system is part of what keeps me out of here. While the food sizes are rather large I haven't found anything of 'wow' quality on the menu.  I'd rather they shrink portion sizes and use higher quality ingredients."
Aj K.,"San Lorenzo, CA",1,27,4,3.0,11/22/2016,"Food was okay, drinks didn't arrive with appetizer. When we asked about our drink, our server apologized and offered us house salad for being late. Liked the customer service. Only concern is the food is a way expensive compared to the portions served"
Lisa T.,"Lakeport, CA",0,11,1,3.0,5/22/2016,"I've been to several Cheescake factory locations and the last two visits were at the Corte Madera.  My last experience was so bad I complained to the manager while there, then called the next day due to the poor way I was treated by the manager.  I was promised a gift card in the mail which I have yet to receive.  Anyhow today's experience was not bad, however the table was dirty and my avocado eggs rolls were very lemony....I will probably not return after two negatives"
Matt T.,"Mill Valley, CA",34,114,43,3.0,1/1/2016,Well you know. I've lost count over the years of how many times over the past 30 years I've been to a CF. Always pretty good but always challenging to decide with the hundreds of choices - I'm not kidding. It's actually a pain in the...
Pat R.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,25,,2.0,5/19/2016,"Very nice waiter & excellent service UNTIL we got our entrees.  Then the waiter neglected us for about 20 minutes after we had finished before he got us more water & took dessert orders. Chix caesar was good except chix was tough as an old rag!  Cheese cake was super, as usual. Seems it wouldn't take much to be a lot better in service & chix!"
Ryan M.,"San Rafael, CA",13,123,17,4.0,12/27/2015,"I know that I'm likely going to have to turn over my foodie card for this but I have to be honest and say that this place is actually quite good. It's tough to say for someone who can't stand chain restaurants as a matter of principle but so much for principles. Since having a little one, my wife and I have had to figure out more kid friendly dining options and this has become a go to as a result. The undeniable benefit here is that there is literally something for everyone in the menu and all the specialties I have had so far are very good. The Hibachi Steak is by far my favorite but I have yet to not enjoy my eating experience here. The service is hit or miss as with most chains and depends largely on which server you get. Parking is a breeze as it's located at the Village in Corte Madera and you can also call ahead and get your order brought to your car instead!"
Liliana M.,"Hercules, CA",3,23,18,4.0,3/28/2016,"went just for a quick pick up of cheesecakes after a day in half moon bay. Cant get enough of the vanilla bean cheesecake. And my hunny's favorite, red velvet cheesecake."
Kimberly G.,"San Rafael, CA",0,9,,2.0,5/5/2017,"Three things I've never had here:  a decent meal, an order without multiple errors, or good service.  The servers never write the orders down, they assure you they have it right, and then get it wrong, with dreary regularity.  My most recent, and last ever meal there, I asked to have onions added and they brought me a stinking, slippery, bowl of onions and told me to I had to put them on myself.  This was only one of multiple flops in my simple order of a plate of sliders, they forgot to put the cheese and the mustard, and the meat was extremely skimpy, hard and dry.  I was working on my laptop, and it still stinks of the onions I had to handle.  Is this a restaurant or a self-serve cafeteria with restaurant prices?  They don't even have wifi!  This mediocre chain would never have made it in Marin, if they weren't the only restaurant in the county where you can eat after 9:00 pm.  Very overpriced for the low-quality ingredients and cooking.  Not recommended."
Anne R.,"Hercules, CA",5000,829,322,3.0,12/8/2013,This place is really nice. It's like the SF location but without all the hustle of the city life and cars everywhere. The location is pretty big and on a not so busy night it can feel kind of empty. It's kind of dim in here so bring a phone light lol I guess the soft lighting is suppose to give off a romantic feel? Not sure lol  As far as the menu - biggest choice selection I have ever seen lol it's literally like 10 pages long - good I guess for having different options but hard when you are on crunch for time. Good quality isn't 5 stars it's more like 3 stars - not bad but not the best. Customer service here is alright - hit or miss in my opinion.  Give this place a try and tell me what you think. Either SF or this location are decent.
Randy O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/21/2016,"This use to be one of my favorite consistently good restaurants to always meet a friend for lunch or dinner. Last night I was there with a friend. We experience the worst service ever ! It took 20 minuets to get a 2nd place setting. set,,, The bread did not come until mid main course. We ended up busing our own table.We tried to flag down the waiter , busboy or manager... They just did not care... We were never even asked if we wanted desert ... (It is the cheesecake factory..). We waited for ever for a check probably another 25 minuets. We were constantly trying to find a server... Finally someone came over said I am sorry..and offered us 1 piece of cheesecake to take out... There were 2 of us... which I pointed out... so 2 pieces would be nice.They said no only one.. Very sorry to go out to a nice dinner, pay good money and be ignored. Incompetent help and hostess's and server..."
