Jeff H.,"Victoria, Canada",1,2,8,5.0,3/2/2014,Ordered the orange chicken and the pork chop. Fantastic! Huge servings! The deserts were great. I recommend the carrot cake.  The staff was amazing. Can't wait to go back.
Sea S.,"Eureka, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/7/2016,"Oh my gosh, EAT HERE! The hostess was sweet, kind and efficient. I didn't get her name, darn. Eric, our waiter, was FABULOUS! Excellent service, always a smile, kind, quick service, funny, and just a wonderful human. The food was delicious. The Oreo cheesecake was to die for. I'd eat here everyday because of the excellent staff AND the scrumptious food!"
Sarah H.,"San Anselmo, CA",177,24,53,5.0,11/17/2014,"My all time favorite chain restaurant! I could eat the whole menu everything is so good. Even if there is a wait I don't mind it's always worth it. I have never had a bad meal here. My favorites are pasta carbonara, shrimp scampi, hibachi steak, popcorn shrimp, crab and artichoke dip, sweet corn tamale cakes, Cobb salad, nachos, Greek salad, and avocado egg rolls. Everything is always fresh and delicious. I've never had to send anything back. Food comes out fast for such a big restaurant. The servers are always great and I've actually become friends with a few of them :). I love to go for happy hour as well during the week. 5$ for most of the appetizers and basic drinks. Yes please :)"

Smia S.,"Novato, CA",2,28,1,4.0,7/6/2015,"Went here with the fam for my sister's birthday. Honestly, the price of the food is just too much, it's just not worth it. But I have to say, the service deserves 4 stars. My family is very picky so we made some changes to the sides, the waitress was very nice about it. My mom really didn't like her order so she was nice enough to take her order back and give her something else. I ordered the orange chicken, def wasn't the best orange chicken in the world but its not at a Chinese restaurant, so I'm not gonna complain."
Vanessa S.,"San Pablo, CA",30,115,25,5.0,6/29/2014,"YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2014     29/100 Came here last night with a group of girls for my birthday dinner. I've eaten at other cheesecake factories in the past, and I've ordered food to go from this location before, but everything tastes so much better when dining in! I ordered a well done sirloin which came with a side of fries. The steak was cooked perfectly....Sooo good! After dinner, we each got a piece of cheesecake plu a bowl of ice cream for me since it was my bday celebration. Even the ice cream was delicious! It was topped with a tower of thick, creamy whipped cream and sprinkles. CF isn't cheap, but the bill wasn't as shocking as I had expected, even for 5 people. Way to go Cheesecake Factory, the food was great! Oh yes...our waitress was extremely nice & helpful as well which just added to our pleasant experience."
Lorri B.,"Placerville, CA",0,18,,3.0,7/19/2015,"I had an awesome waitress, who helped me by speaking with the manager to make sure I had no problems with ingredients I'm allergic to being added to my food. Thank you for that.  The beverage I got was perfect.  The less than four stars is for behavior of the gentleman who cleaned up the table across from me. I hope his manager speaks with him to correct the behavior so it never happens again. He seemed much too comfortable doing it, which means he's probably used to it.  You never know who is watching you and who they may report things to."
Aneesa I.,"Oakland, CA",3,51,52,1.0,6/25/2013,"One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. I came here with my family on a visit to the city. Nobody liked their food, I could tell by the almost entirely full plates.  The waiters were kind and refilled our drinks often, but the food was horrendous.  I ordered the fish and chips (tempura batter fried,) with some fries, but for $14 I could have gone to the wharf and spent less for the same thing. It turned out to be the best out of all of the other five dishes we ordered.  The chicken piccata can be described as a mass of cold, old, and dried out spaghetti with a nonexistent amount of sauce. The chicken was similar to a frozen dinner entree. The fish cost $16. The meatloaf consisted entirely of bread, and the Shepherd's pie was chunks of ground beef in sauce, with mashed potatoes on top--where did the pie part go?  The food was way too overpriced and generally nasty. The bread was not good either.  Our booth was filthy, laden with old food, with a greasy table to add to the unclean sitting area. I could see the remnants of old food caked onto the silverware.  This place is terrible. There are plenty of excellent restaurants in San Francisco that serve great food at reasonable prices."
Emily P.,"Sonoma, CA",44,12,6,1.0,5/6/2015,This place doesn't even deserve a star I loved this place till today my moms birthday today and we asked them to sing for my moms birthday but no one showed up and they took my moms name to sing and the waitress only took our order and never showed up till we paid. Worst place ever!
Taylor W.,"Sierra Madre, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/6/2016,"So I walk in, get seated fairly quickly, peruse the menu, then wait for a server to acknowledge my existence. 5 minutes.... 10 minutes..... People are being served to both the left and right of me, so I assume I'm wearing my invisibility cloak.  15 minutes.... All attempts to get anyone's attention fail miserably.  Finally, after 20 minutes, I get up, walk out, and head over to California Pizza Kitchen.  Keep up the great customer service, Cheesecake Factory!"
Lovey G.,"Pacifica, CA",2,37,6,4.0,5/31/2016,This location is always packed but they never fail to make their customers feel important. We visit here once a month as this is my daughter's favorite place to eat. Pepperoni pizza and Linda's fudge cake are her favorites! Not all their food are outstanding but overall I will still give them a 4 star. Will continue to be their regular customer!
Courtney M.,"San Rafael, CA",107,38,1,3.0,3/2/2013,"HAPPY HOUR - until 6pm Happy Hour food menu has a lot of choices, which is refreshing compared to other Happy Hours in the area.  People get pretty competitive about finding a seat, which is a draw back, but once we settled in it was good drinks and yummy, consistent apps to start off the weekend!"
Vicki A.,"Larkspur, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/11/2016,"Stay away.  Support other local, smaller, non corporate places.  Tonight was the clincher after 3-4 visits over last six months, it just gets worse and worse.  Bad service. Can't get orders correct.  We were a party of four who go often through the past years. We all agreed the quality of the place has suffered. The other recent comments about happy hour are on point. Lack of presence by a manager is off putting.  I won't go back."
Chris T.,"San Francisco, CA",321,53,14,2.0,3/16/2014,"This was my first trip to the Cheesecake Factory and I'm going to guess that normally this chain is reasonably good at serving food because they've been around for a while. So I don't know what happened tonight, but dinner service completely fell apart. Our table and every other table nearby was having a horrible experience. Slow meal service, missing waiters, orders coming out at inappropriate times.Our table-neighbor got her cheesecake before the main dish ever arrived.  Cheesecake Factory tries to push out kid dishes earlier, which is nice, however our other neighbors did not get the adult dishes for 20 minutes after their kid was finished eating and we got all of ours. Even getting a cup of lemonade for my son took 15 minutes and was delivered by a random person separate from our other drinks. I was going to write this all off to the kitchen or management but our waiter walked around with our check after running my credit card for at least 15 minutes. He was apologetic but it was just another thing that made dinner service Kitchen-Nightmares-worthy on this particular night. The stars it gets are because the food was pretty OK. I had the Romano Crusted Chicken and it was good (the chicken was good, but the pasta and sauce were bland). My wife's chicken pasta was pretty good as well. And I've generally heard good things about Cheesecake Factory but after spending 1h45m for a simple one-course meal, I just can't give them a favorable review this time."
Shell B.,"Portland, OR",2,19,1,5.0,10/14/2015,"We came here for dinner around 8:30 at night. Had great service. We ordered six of the small plates which were healthy in portion, plenty to feed the two of us and less than $50. Would definitely come back."
Janice C.,"San Francisco, CA",528,2174,5892,3.0,1/21/2010,"Okay, this is weird. The bf and I had to come back to the Village at Corte Madera (an outdoor  shopping mall) because for once, he needed to purchase stuff and I'm returning goods. That almost NEVER happens. If you don't want to leave the immediate mall area, there are 3 choices for food: CF, Boudin SF and the lil cafe by Nordies. CF won. The host was suspiciously cheery for a rainy day, but I appreciated his perkiness. There was no wait which was a plus, since we were hungry. We ordered a Mojito (too sweet for our taste) to sip on while waiting for our food to come.  Normally, I gorge on the bread basket at CF, since their dark oat bread is good, but this time it was just okay and the french bread was hard. I think I cut the upper roof of my mouth from chewing on the hard edges. I ordered from the small bites menu since I wanted to try a salad and a pizza without lugging leftovers around while at the mall and the portions were just right for me.  I loved the sweet beets in my salad with goat cheese, peppery arugula and candied walnuts.  A little heavy on the dressing though. The Wild Mushroom pizzette looks like a elongated flatbread. It had plenty of cheese and the mushrooms were cooked just right.  Bf liked his Classic burger which was served with bleu cheese sauce on the side.   Our server Dominic had a cute smile and easy demeanor, but wish he was more doting on his service. All in all, a good choice in the mall area, our lunch was only $30 (not including tip)"
Mario H.,"San Pablo, CA",182,9,7,3.0,11/9/2014,Very loud...bland food...watered down drinks....i gave them 3 stars because the service was actually great...but they can't control bad seasoning and watered down drinks...small bar....they do cheesecake cake...maybe it was just this location but for sure would not come back here
Mark H.,"Wynnewood, PA",45,141,,4.0,8/25/2014,"This is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory.  We were in the area visiting the shops and wanted to grab a quick lunch.  It's always interesting how similar these places all are.  If I couldn't look outside, I'd say we were in any other suburban area. The menu is exactly the same as any other Cheesecake Factory.  If you haven't been to one yet, be prepared for menu overload and understand that portions are all huge.  This was our first time both ordering from the Skinnylicious menu.  Ignoring the silly name, this menu actually solves a big problem I have with Cheesecake Factory.  Usually the meals are way too big and I feel overfull even after just eating a portion of the meal, but this new menu does a good job of providing more balanced meal. Service was good and our server did a great job of double checking for my girlfriend's food restrictions. Overall this was a good stop for lunch and if we're back in the area I wouldn't hesitate to stop back in."
Kelly F.,"San Rafael, CA",19,104,22,1.0,2/19/2016,"Ahhh! Cheesecake Factory - after all these years you have failed me! 50 minutes after sitting down and had only received our waters (30 minutes after the waitress dropped off some bread, said nothing, and ran off not to be seen again for quite awhile). I had to get up and find my daughter a booster seat because no one offered and no one came by that we could ask for help from. No apology for the wait. The waitress was super rushed to take our order - basically told us to order our apps + meals at one time (and as I could've guessed they ALL came out at once). No room on the table. She dropped forks on the floor, didn't offer to replace them. She was ""new"" and complaining about how busy they were and venting about the job?! We wanted the artichoke appetizer. they were out. The gentlemen next to us ordered Thai lettuce wraps, they were out. And the men on the other side of us ordered the lemon herb chicken, and they were out of that too! We ended up having to take more than 1/2 our food home because of the ill timing of the poor service. I would've talked to a manager (it was that bad) but I could not even imagine spending one more minute in that restaurant tonight. Needless to say we won't be back anytime soon! This visit really left a bad taste in my mouth."
Kevin J.,"San Francisco, CA",2508,873,340,3.0,2/6/2012,"What can I say?  This is a Corte Madera staple; one that I'd like to undo with a staple remover but it serves up a hefty plate... literally.  I try not to make it a habit to dine at chain restaurants but I have been to Cheesecake Factory several times for the likes of my family and friends.  You can't really find a bad tasting item on the menu and the menu serves up over 100 items I'm sure.  The Fried Cheese Balls are to die for and the Vegetable salad is sure to curb your Veggie appetite. I'm not so sure about the monolithic theme going on within the restaurant.  It's almost as if to say that their cheesecake is some kind of a god.  It's good, but not god."
