Ron D.,"Visalia, CA",2,8,4,1.0,5/4/2015,Worst service ever.  Went for dinner last Friday.  I ordered a steak and my wife ordered nachos.  After nearly an hour wait the manager comes over and tells us she is sorry for the wait but they are making new cheese sauce for the nachos.  5 minutes later our waiter comes over and tells us the delay is because the overcooked my steak.  Needless to say we left!
Kabal G.,"San Pablo, CA",1,8,6,3.0,3/14/2016,The food is always good here the only thing that I didn't like was that they brought the food separately it was four of us and they brought 2 people there food and then 15 mins later they brought the other peoples food.  The point of going to a restaurant together is to eat together and that's ridiculous 15 mins the other food was cold.
Mario R.,"San Pablo, CA",76,3,,1.0,6/11/2016,"I usually don't write bad reviews because I'm pretty understanding, but I was excited about eating here since I usually love it. I came with 5 friends at around 9:30pm and left about 11:30pm, during that time we only got one refill, and our food came about 45 Minutes after we ordered even though it wasn't busy at all. All my friends got their food but I didn't (ordered parmesan crusted chicken) after they were done eating I still haven't received my food and the server said that they over cooked my chicken and I guess didn't bother making another one,  so after all that I didn't even have dinner. I wasn't offered anything else or a free drink atleast since I barely got a refill. I wasn't looking for a hand out but I bet if I had been a rude customer and cause a scene that wouldn't have been the case. Pretty disappointed.  And I still left a tip. Oh and they over charged me 24$ and I pointed it out and they took 20 minutes to correct."
Kathleen N.,"Kentfield, CA",36,10,,1.0,1/13/2016,"Poor service all around.  I requested curbside service (kids in tow), waited 10 minutes in my car, and then decided to go in.  Apparently there had been a change in shifts, and phone person didn't tell delivery person that I was waiting outside.  Fine.  I bring food home to find undercooked hamburgers (I ordered medium for my kids), wilted, yellow kale in my salad and missing side for one entree.  I felt this many mistakes at a less than busy time deserved a phone call, so I called to speak with the manager, and I was put on hold for five minutes.  The only reason I gave the restaurant a star is because of their tasty French fries.  I won't be going back."
Roman K.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,12,,1.0,3/29/2015,If I could I would give minus 5 stars. Love Cheesecake Factory but this experience was the worst. It all started with asking for a table. We wanted to sit outside. We put our name on the list and waited. We waited and then were informed that they called our name but we didn't response and therefore they gave the table to someone else. We waited again but nothing happened. We saw several tables that were empty but needed to be cleaned.  Eventually we just went and cleaned off the table ourselves and sat down. Within seconds the host ran outside and asked us if we were sat down by someone? We said no but we were tired of waiting.  She left us there and said she will get us some menus. After another 10 minutes of waiting we got menus and some evil looks from the waitress. Then after ordering the waitress forgot our order and apologizes several times blaming the computer for it.  After about 1.5 hours of wait we got our food that wasn't even that hot anymore.  After complaining the manager offered us free cheesecake. We paid our bill and waited for the free cake that never came. We eventually left and as we passed the cheesecake station  the manager saw us and ran over to the cheesecake station to ask for our cheesecake.  She then rushed over to us to say it's being prepared. We eventually got one slice of cake. We were three people though. They could have at least given us three slices.  In total the worst experience ever.  McDonald's has better customer service.
Genevieve M.,"Berkeley, CA",123,82,30,3.0,10/22/2013,I'm only rating three stars because the customer service sucked. I brought my little sister here for her 8th grade graduation celebration and although they did give us a table right away the front staff was just snobby.  The food was great my only complain was that it was probably overly spiced I don't know. Our waiter wasn't too bad but I didn't feel the genuine chemistry I could tell he was eager for tips. Not so crazy about this location either.
Katie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,10,3.0,4/19/2014,Ok so I decided to go hunting for a brownie sundae and it brought us here. I ordered one and they brought me a hot fudge sundae and fork to eat it with instead if a spoon  In terms of service our waiter was very nice and was always around
Genevieve B.,"Mountain View, CA",13,117,,4.0,4/12/2014,Excellent service and they are wonderful and kind to those with kids.   Stupid yelp won't take a short review..... Food is decent and good portions but service sets them apart. Nice outdoor area to eat. Today they hosted a charity breakfast.  Just seem like good folks.
Jenny C.,"San Rafael, CA",10,7,,4.0,8/1/2014,"I came here last night with a friend, and it was very busy due to their National Cheesecake Day promotion (1/2off cheesecake slice, dine-in only).  -Parking:  pretty easy on a Thursday night  (mall parking lot). -Wait time, average 20 min. We were already starving so it seemed longer. -Food took a long time coming out. Understandable because of their sale and waitress apologized and thanked us for our patience. -Food quality & appearance (appetizer / entree / cheesecake ) were excellent. -Price is average to high for a family restaurant:        $10-12 for appetizers        $16-20 for premium entree (steak and seafood)        No prices on drink menus.  -Service: Nice and courteous with quick response by our waitress. -Atmosphere: loud - probably due to tile floor and high ceiling. We had a fun experience and took home yummy leftovers. Only drawback is that the main entree(on huge plates) came just 2 minutes after we had gotten our appetizer. The table for 2 was too small and we had to rush our appetizer (Otherwise our dinner would get cold).  I would go again when it's not so busy."
Alison H.,"San Rafael, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/11/2016,"I went there to celebrate having my foster child living with me for 6 months.  I ordered a salad with no chicken and it came out with chicken.  I sent it back and it was returned, this time with three of four hidden pieces of chicken.  I have been a vegetarian for 43 years, and this was very offensive.  When I told the waiter he just shrugged, and when he gave me the bill the salad was on there, even though I could not eat it.  Disgusted.  And they would not change, nor has the complaint been addressed by the management"
b f.,"Larkspur, CA",0,29,,1.0,12/6/2015,"Service has hit a new low at the Corte Madera Cheesecake Factory. After waiting for our order to be taken, we waited another 45 minutes before our salad and sandwiches were delivered. This was on a slow week night, early, before 6 in the evening. Empty tables all around us. Server nowhere in sight. When we were finished with our entree, the server was not around for dessert order. When we were finished with our meal, I had to stand up and look around for the server, not seeing her, I asked the manager if someone could please bring our check so we could leave. We had very elderly people with us and didn't expect that salad and sandwich would take over two hours from start to finish. Previous visits have been better but over the last six months, we have experienced filthy silverware, tasteless food, incorrect orders and generally bad service. Time to avoid this restaurant. Other restaurants in this chain are superior to this one. Additionally, they were out of soup, out of pumpkin cheesecake and this was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Server didn't recommend alternatives, just said without apology, we are ""out."" The vegeburger ordered by two at the table was literally so sloppy it would require a spoon. When complaint was made, we were told they could make another one, not an offer of ordering another item. Because the two did not want to delay the meal, they didn't re-order.  All around awful experience. No more chances will be given."
Maegan G.,"San Rafael, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/26/2016,"As a cheesecake factory, I expected a lot more. The setting was way too dark, probably the darkest cheesecake factory I've gone to. We got seated right away, got our drinks and ordered right away as there weren't as much people. We also got our food right away, so I can't complain about that. The food was cooked okay, I felt as if my dish was a tad bit over cooked, but manageable as the bold flavors was there, but there was a missing element in the other dish as it lacked saltiness. I am assuming it was missing the pancetta. On to the service, Our server Michelle, was very kind and welcoming, however she lacked on checking up on our table as for her other tables. I only had one cup of water, wanted more bread, and I'm assuming her manager or someone had to pull her out of a conversation she was having with a customer at the bar for I'd say 20 mins. When we asked for to-go boxes, I surprised that this cheesecake factory had their customers box their own food. Our server Michelle was generous enough to give us two separate bags for our boxes, BUT she placed the bags directly on top of my dish. UHHH I dont know what that bag touched... for all I know it may have fell into something icky. Probably won't be coming back again...."
Steve S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/16/2016,Fun but fattening. I have a weakness for sweets and am in hog heaven when it comes to desserts here. The entrees are good too if you're in the mood for comfort food.
Patty S.,"Gualala, CA",11,13,,4.0,12/21/2014,"First time in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I wish I would have saved room for cheesecake. We had the avocado rolls as an appetizer, my husband had the Sunday brunch omelet and I had the Pit Beef sandwich. It was more than we are use to eating but very good. We'll have the leftovers for dinner. Staff was very attentive even though it was very busy. I will definitely go back to try the actual cheesecake and possibly bring some home."
Nancy M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,37,5,5.0,6/9/2015,Excellent customer service. We had a Graduation luncheon for our small party. The manager was so very friendly. He was very kind to elderly women in our group. Nice waitress would politely listen to complaints regarding glassware. Food brought in a timely manner. Water glasses and hot water was filled at appropriate time. The food was delicious. I had the Skinnylicous soft tacos which were tasty with a generous side of vegetables. Our graduate ordered a tasty cheesecake with cherries and two scoops of ice cream. My daughter felt very special. Thank you.
Jessica C.,"Mill Valley, CA",23,60,78,4.0,2/26/2012,"I'm consistently happy eating here. It's great for families w kids that still want good food at a decent price. The wine list is decent..  Some of my favs are the fried calamari, firecracker shrimp rolls, and pretty much any pasta dish!  Service is great.. There can be a wait, So be prepared for 20-45 min of waiting on a Friday or Saturday night. There is outdoor seating w heat lamps. Once seated, the food comes out quickly.  I like it!!"
Lynn B.,"Novato, CA",0,25,,5.0,3/25/2014,"Love Love Love the  Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is extensive and the atmosphere is so pretty.  It gets crowded, so be prepared to wait at dinner time.  We usually try to go mid-afternoon for a  late lunch/early dinner after shopping. Our favorite 2 dishes are the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta and the BBQ Chicken Salad.   The Shrimp Scampi and Meatloaf are also very good...But really, everything is great, we've never been disappointed... They've added ""small dishes"" to their menu, which is great, considering the proportions are really big.   Service is always friendly.  All in all- good stuff!"
Barbara C.,"Mill Valley, CA",6,9,,1.0,9/20/2016,"Well, the food was good but the service was friendly and horrible.  I ordered fish tacos and they brought chicken well after serving everyone else at our table. It was then a half hour before the first of two sets of fish taco's arrive (I did NOT order two dinners). The second server seemed a little confused when he saw I ""already"" had the fish taco plate (I was just picking up the first taco). I had to insist he take them back to the kitchen.  Everyone else at our table had finished eating by the time the first of my taco's arrived (I had insisted they start). Two of them asked for their left overs to be boxed. One was boxed and the server confessed she'd ""tossed"" the other and took that dinner off the check. I know I should have asked to be comped for my dinner too but just wanted to leave. The final ""are you kidding"" was the unspeakable condition of the women's restroom. I've loved Cheesecake Factory in the past but I don't think we'll be going there anytime soon."
Bunny A.,"San Rafael, CA",18,40,7,1.0,1/4/2013,"Until this last visit, The Cheesecake Factory was a safe and reliable source for great service, good food, generous portions in a clean environment.  That was definitely NOT the case on Thursday 1/3/13. We arrived at 9:00 and were seated immediately in the bar area. The table was dirty, the floor around the table was littered in crumbs, and the flatware had bits of dried on food. Our server took about 5 minutes to arrive at our table, and then he was neither friendly or rude, but lacked any semblance of a personality.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls and factory nachos to share. The egg rolls were tepid, and the nachos were dripping in grease, and totally lacked flavor. Our server must have known he served us lousy food, because he never checked back in, until he came to clear the plates, at which time he made a half-assed attempt to offer dessert, as he dropped the check and ran away. Well, now I can cross TCF off my list of sure bets, and add it to my list of never agains! In a word...YUCK!"
Marina C.,"San Rafael, CA",71,42,10,3.0,1/1/2014,"This place is good if you are really hungry!!! The service was friendly, but the host staff looked at me like I was a huge problem when I asked if they had a table for 3. If you don't then just say no, but if you do then don't give me attitude about it.  The food was good, Caesar salad and the fire roasted artichoke. I highly recommend the artichoke, it is the best thing on their ridiculously large menu.  If you are watching your weight don't even step through the doors! Red velvet cheesecake is also good."
