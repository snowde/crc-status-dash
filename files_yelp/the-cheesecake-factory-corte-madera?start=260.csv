Kathy J.,"San Rafael, CA",20,91,3,1.0,1/28/2015,This location lacks management and employee training. Almost every time we go in there is not a server to be found in the bar area. Yesterday at shift change and as usual our server left and did not intro us to the new server. I asked a server near by for coffee waited 20 minutes and never got coffee. You never see a manager presence at this location unlike Palo Alto and Las Vegas. This location is sub par don't waste your money for bad service.
Milla G.,"Corte Madera, CA",4,35,23,3.0,9/26/2014,"So I normally love to come here to meet up with friends. The place is aesthetically appealing, a great menu for all kinds of taste buds and it's all around a good time. They are known for their huge portions and extensive menu. Well, I just came here with some lady friends and was so disappointed with how small my portion was that I had to complain about it. Luckily the management was great and understood that clearly there was a mistake, but it was such a shame to have to go through all of that when whoever brought the dish to the table should have noticed how small it was or even my waiter didn't notice. The flavors were right on but talk about doing portion control... Still had a nice time, our waiter was lovely and the dessert was superb as usual. I guess my message is, if you are presented with a dish that looks like you could actually finish it, something isn't right and cheesecake if you have decided to drastically cut down on your portions, like half the amount, then please let us as customers know or lower the price of the dish. As upset as I may sound, this will not stop me from coming back. I still enjoyed my meal and service so thank you for that."

Jeffrey S.,"San Leandro, CA",329,444,250,3.0,4/25/2011,"I came here with my family yesterday for Easter dinner.  With 9 people in tow, I was worried that we wouldn't get seated right away, since they don't take reservations.  But we came in around 5:30, so it wasn't quite the dinner rush yet, and we seated right away. I came in with my brother's kids, who are a little rambunctious, so the Cheesecake Factory is a good place for them, as the entire place is always loud.  And the menu is very large, so there's something in there for everyone. Unfortunately, the food is just OK.  None of the entrees I've ever tried have ever wowed me.  The portions are very large, which is good, but nothing so great that I have to try them again.  Plus, the leftovers are not very good the 2nd time around. The reason to come here, though, is to get dessert.  Even if you are too stuffed from the rest of your meal, you need to get a slice of cheesecake, at least to go.  We ordered 5 different slices and shared them, and they were all excellent. Overall, if you can get in when it's not busy, great.  Otherwise, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  Desserts are great, the rest of the experience is just OK,."
Rebecca S.,"San Anselmo, CA",0,6,1,3.0,10/23/2014,"The food is just okay and the service was not great.  We waited 45 minutes.  The skinny menu, however, was pretty decent."
Clarissa P.,"Novato, CA",92,15,3,1.0,12/28/2013,"I give them one star. It was busy as usual but found a spot at the bar. It was just too dark in this place. I think they keep it dark so you don't see your actual plate of food in front of you due to the pool of oil I had. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. It had really good but since it was dark, couldn't really tell it had that much oil on the plate. Got home and started snacking on the rest of my food I brought home and noticed that there was just ALOT of oil on the plate.   Middle of the night woke up totally not feeling well. Got food poisoning from this place. I will most definitely not be going back here and suggest others to watch out for them. Totally not worth it."
Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",231,47,53,5.0,3/16/2014,"Such great service! The portions are really big. They are very attentive! We had the Bam-Bam, Jambalaya, and Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. All of the meals were so good! We asked for drinks and they found out it was My Jesse's birthday today and when we ordered dessert they decorated his plate with Happy Birthday To You. This place is really good!"
W B.,"Cathedral City, CA",21,81,19,2.0,10/19/2013,"I have been here several times. It has a lovey patio perfect place for lunch after shopping on a sunny day. I almost always order the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  The past several times I have eaten at this location have been disappointing. Inconsistent food. Over cooked Chicken, sauce that is to sweet or noddles that are heavily seasoned with curry powder and a bit pasty and soggy. This past occasion a group of managers were eating behind us on the patio discussing the restaurant. Talk about an appetite suppressant.   Time to give it a rest and step it up maybe Ilfornio across the freeway?"
Don K.,"Riverside, CA",0,15,,4.0,3/3/2015,Amazing food and good amount for the price. I like the steak Diane and their hamburgers and of course the cheese cakes=]
mary r.,"Honolulu, HI",285,68,70,3.0,3/29/2013,"I have been to a few Cheesecake Factory locations across the US but this is my first time reviewing one lol My mom and I came here specifically for happy hour looking for a late lunch early dinner.  She had raved to me that they have the BEST happy hour.  Ok 5 dollar cocktails and appetizers? I'm IN!!   We sat at the tables by the bar.  It didn't take long for our server to acknowledge us (I can't remember his name though).  My mom ordered a cranberry juice & club soda, I ordered a mojito.  The server brought out  the wrong drink for my mom (2 separate glasses of soda & juice lol) but was very quick to correct it.  After that we ordered our food and our server brought out the bread and we asked for olive oil (we don't use butter).  Our server disappeared after that.  I don't know if he was scared of us or if he was just busy.  We had to ask another server for water.  We were never checked on but it was ok but still a quick "" how's it going"" is nice.   I'm a server at a busy restaurant where at certain points especially during a shift change I can have up to 7 tables or more and still give good service.  The restaurant wasn't very busy at the time so I'm not sure if this guy was having a bad day or if his tables were just being needy.  The Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu (where I live) is the busiest one in the chain and their servers always manage to make it back for a check up.   We left a decent tip because the server was at least nice and polite.  He would have gotten a better one if he didn't disappear.   Three stars for the good food....but work on your service Cheesecake!"
Lxs S.,"Corte Madera, CA",13,486,43,4.0,10/1/2012,"EZ to park, service friendly, everyone can find something they like on the menu, portions are HUGE which means good leftovers.   As for the actual cheesecake?  They all look tempting but every kind I have ever tried was too sweet and not particularly cheesy, so I say stuff yourself on the food and leave the cheesecake alone."
Amanda C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",699,709,2037,4.0,8/14/2012,"this is an excellent Cheesecake place, especially for a treat after lunch. I went here with my bf and friend and we wanted a little cocktail and some cheesecake. I had the chocolate chip cookie dough and it was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the key lime cheesecake and it was so creamy and tasty. They have delicious pomegranate/regular margaritas and their service was fantastic!"
Cel Y.,"Berkeley, CA",215,89,278,3.0,5/15/2014,I had take out for lunch today and ordered the Miso Salmon. It was pretty good up until I found a piece of hair in my food. I didn't mind it at all because it was just one. I only took a couple bites and saved it for home.  When I got home I got hungry again after work so I warmed my food up and found another piece of hair and it was in my mouth. I didn't mind it again even tho my hair isn't short and black. I put my food to the side and saved it for later. I got hungry again and I finally went in to finish the rest of my lunch size miso salmon only to find another piece of short black hair in my mouth.... UGGHHHH!!! Now I'm really dissatisfied. Do they not wear hear nets? Ridiculous...  The hair was found in my brown rice. I just called them to make a complaint. Not looking for any reimbursement or anything because I didn't pay for lunch. It was a pharma Rep lunch. I told Jessica one of the managers about this incident and she was super kind and helpful. All I wanted to know after finding the 3rd piece of short black hair maybe 4 inches long... If their staff wore hair nets. She said they do so I don't know how that happened. They were nice enough to send me a 20 dollar gift card for my inconvenience.
Desire R.,"Novato, CA",6,96,11,4.0,11/18/2013,"I came here for a late lunch and ordered the kale salad which was pretty good, I also ordered the vanilla cafe latte also pretty good. Will come back"
Willaim F.,"Corte Madera, CA",1,4,,1.0,2/14/2015,Waiting for more then a hours to get setting and then other just to get food. All the food was cold and taste like the kitchen staff had a cold. Way to munch salt in everything.  The staff was cold and over worked.
Betty B.,"San Diego, CA",241,57,93,4.0,9/13/2010,"After taking taking a long accounting class, my friend and I decided to hit up our local cheesecake factory. It's not our first times here, but definitely our first time for lunch/happy hour.  We arrived around 3ish and found out that happy hour didn't start until 4pm, so we ordered our lunch plates first (good until 5pm).   First thing I love about this place is that they give you a basket of free bread. Since we both liked the brown oat bread, the server gave us just only that. I ordered a half sandwich/soup/salad combo, and I had expected a small plate, but what was supposed to be ""half"" of a chicken salad sandwich, it was big enough to be a whole sandwich! I also paired it with a spicy chicken tortilla soup and a huge portion of their infamous ceasar salad...ALL for under $10! So we were sooo stuffed from our overly portioned lunch plates that we forgot all about ordering drinks for happy hour! The service was an added bonus to our meal as well. Don't be surprised if I'm a regular at this location and the San Francisco Macy's location (I just hate the long wait for that one).  And what was our original purpose for vising this place? Oh yes, the cheesecake. We never ever have space in our tummy for cheesecake, but I promise, promise to make time for you, my white chocolate raspberry truffle. So please, please for me, make room for the cheesecake!"
E. R.,"San Rafael, CA",5,165,2,5.0,7/2/2014,"One of Marin's shiniest jewels in its crown. Beautiful atmosphere, and what a menu. There are certain items that are better than others, but once you find what you like, you are set. The desserts are magnificent, although I'm still bitter that they changed the Strawberry Shortcake cake (it used to be fluffly, now it's crusty with too much sugar sprinkled on top). During peak times there can be a wait, but it's usually not too bad. Definitely try and get a booth because the other tables are a little too close quarter for me, I feel like I'm eating with strangers. Parking is usually easy. Love it!"
B H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,37,3,3.0,12/17/2015,Great location. Good food. Service was not so great. She kept forgetting about us (a table of 5).They're very busy on the weekends and need to have more help.
Joel C.,"Carpinteria, CA",39,62,63,5.0,8/19/2012,"DELICIOUS pomegranate margaritas and light and rich Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. Enjoyable patio which, in the afternoon, makes for a nice and warming lunch outside. Staff is friendly and attentive, and they allowed our dog on the patio. Great place for a relaxing lunch or early dinner. Good for groups and families as well as a romantic date."
Rick H.,"Mill Valley, CA",6,171,,2.0,4/26/2014,"If all you're looking for is quantity, this is the place for you. The food is absolutely gigantic. Monstrous! Does it taste like anything you really want to eat? Now, that's a different story. And, a personal,quibble. The cheesecake? I'm just not into Godzilla-sized slices stuffed with, or covered with every gooey, sticky, sweet thing imaginable.  Personally, I just like cheesecake. But, that's just me."
