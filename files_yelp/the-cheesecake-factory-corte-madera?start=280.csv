S W.,"San Francisco, CA",528,356,6,4.0,7/10/2012,"In the past, when I thought about the phrase ""Cheesecake Factory"" I immediately thought about a 5,000 calorie meal. Being from California, this was just frightening and I would stay away as much as I could (their addicting brown sugar and French rolls don't help at all, nor do their slushy like drinks)...  And then one day I went with my girlfriend and I saw their ""reduced calorie"" menu--drinks and food both. 100 calorie Mojitos? I got two! Flavorful and refreshing! We split the Asian Chicken Salad (under 400 calories) along with the Miso Salmon with extra sauce (how wrong can you go with fish if you stay away from the white rice, right?!). But since we were already there and saving ourselves just thousands of calories already, we just had to order the (fried) Avocado egg rolls!  The salad was delicious and refreshing--I think it is their dressing that does the trick. The Miso Salmon with extra brown sauce was perfectly glazed and cooked just right - not over done, and not squishy. I also really enjoyed dipping the salmon in the white sauce that the rice sat on. And the avocado egg rolls--- you just can' go wrong with the word ""Avocado"" and the implication of something ""fried"" in the same phrase."
Rain Greg J.,"Palm Springs, CA",10,143,87,5.0,10/10/2014,"We typically prefer locally owned and operated businesses, but we stopped in at the Cheese Cake Factory for a quick drink and a potty break while out shopping. This was my first time at any Cheese Cake Factory and the best deal we've had yet in San Francisco. Happy hour drinks $5 and nice sized drinks! $5 appetizers, and they are good sized portions! We had the delicious shrimp spring rolls. 3 good sized spring rolls on a bed of pan noodles and slaw w/2 dipping sauces. Now I know why they've been so successful. Great food, great service, and great value! They also had a healthy menu, separate from the typical high calorie menu with plenty of tasty options. WAY TO GO!! We will be back, that's a promise!"
Greta R.,"San Rafael, CA",60,522,57,4.0,3/17/2013,"We've been here about 6 times in the past year.  It has become our go-to place when we are at the Village.  They have a new Skinny menu that is excellent.  They are healthy versions of some of there classic dishes.  We've always had good, attentive service.  Normally, we aren't big fans of chains, but this one seems to be very well managed."
Jaidene J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",28,23,2,5.0,10/17/2014,"Every time I come to this specific Cheesecake Factory I leave with no complaints.  The food is amazing,  service is excellent and of course the cheesecake is devine. The only thing is the wait but thats not the restaurant's fault,  so no points deducted."
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",395,752,957,3.0,8/7/2012,"standard cheesecake factory. huge portions, great service.  and heavy calories :) unless you order from the skinny menu... I have lately stopped going to the SF cheesecake factory and gone here. It's not worth the hassle waiting in line for 30 minutes feeling like a sardine in a can in san francisco. the wait time here is quick and plenty of parking."
Dana S.,"Los Altos, CA",0,15,,3.0,1/8/2016,"We often eat at char restaurants, but this one is a bit disappointing as there are way too many options for food.  I understand this would be difficult to change as it is a chain and you can't just change one location's menu, but there's something to be said about having fewer options and more focus on quality. Also, the waiters don't come around enough."
Charles R.,"San Rafael, CA",24,76,20,4.0,7/12/2012,"New skinny menu?    Well for the Cheesecake Factory I suppose it is a ""skinny"" menu.  The faro salad was especially tasty but for other items is simply seems that the Cheesecake Factory has reduced the portion size from a Midwest portion down to a California sized portion and replaced the deep fried items with salads.   At least it seems like they are making an effort."
Kory F.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/28/2015,"I have nothing against cheesecake factory since my wife and I go to one all of the time in southern California...we love the food and the atmosphere has been pretty good. But this place is horrible. They sat us right next to the kitchen, where we couldn't even here each other speak from across the table. The table we were at had all place setting on it, and the table was very dirty with food particles and dried sauce. We asked for them to clean the table and bring us new place settings. They never came and we had to ask for them, and when they did, they didn't give us any napkins, nor give us a chance to ask for them. Next, they brought my beer in a chipped glass. I have no idea if that was chipped after they filled the glass or if there was chipped glass in my drink. Thirdly, I saw my waitress twice, when she took my order and when I asked for the check over 40 minuted later... Still without a napkin. I don't normally write reviews, but for how much you pay for food here, you best have better service than what I got tonight. Never coming back here, not recommending this place to anyone."
Reena P.,"Dixon, CA",176,500,234,3.0,8/28/2012,"Decided to stop in after torturing my boyfriend with hours of shopping at the mall in Corte Madera.  Cheesecake Factory is still run of the mill and is still an assortment of hodge-podge food.  We opted to try the spring rolls that are on the ""Skinny"" menu... they didn't seem particularly skinnier than the other ones we've eaten here before but maybe just smaller in size.  We shared the jambalaya which we were told was going to be spicy and full of flavor. We actually found it pretty bland.  The food just IS here and the atmosphere is the way it's always been where you can enjoy a quiet intimate dinner with someone.  The only thing I'll have to add otherwise is that the BROWN bread is way better than any other bread here! :)"
Noah M.,"Mill Valley, CA",61,16,,4.0,11/11/2014,"I eat here a few times a month and although the food is often processed, the portions are large and the service is pretty good. It takes a bit longer than average to get your food here..... not sure why that is? I've only been to this CCF so I have nothing to compare it to but as far as chain restaurants go CCF wins the prize."
Andrew V.,"San Francisco, CA",84,268,259,4.0,5/11/2013,"I hate chain restaurants, but this spot is one of my favorites. Food is good and cheesecakes are GREAT! SO BOMB. Unlimitted parking! unlike San Francisco Union Square location"
Sam M.,"Northern, CA",9,130,18,1.0,3/26/2012,"There wasn't anything Happy about the Happy Hour. Our service was HORRIBLE!!! I was a server, bartender and manager for years so this is one of my pet peeves.  1. Took her 10 minutes even to acknowledge us...and no it wasn't busy.  2. Appetizer was cold 3. Salads never came until we asked for them 30 minutes later. They salads were good. 4. It was very clear that our server didn't care. She was interested in serving one of the sous chef's and his family who was sitting next to us.  5. When she gave us the bill, she just dropped it on the table and started talking to the sous chef. Seriously! Not even a thank you or eye contact. 5. I left the Cheesecake factory hungry."
Chris T.,"Novato, CA",0,14,,4.0,11/7/2013,"We had a great family meal here.  The girl who served us was really great!  She was very informed about all the items on the menu (which is huge) and recommended some great food for us to order.  Everybody was very happy with what they received from drinks to dessert!  It had been a long time since I'd been here, but definately will come back!!"
Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,4.0,11/29/2010,"Oooff! Even their lunch entrees are plus-sized and (this time) good! If you value your waistline, split any one of these and this will be the correct portion size. Their lunch pizza with a stunningly pretty (large of course) house salad were really excellent and I had leftovers for both. Ditto for the Chicken Piccata, and the other lunch meals our party of 4 had.  Only disappointment was their seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake which is more like a pumpkin cheesecake layered over a poorly-prepared pecan pie. Not my favorite, even though I separately love Pumpkin flavored cheesecake and good Pecan Pies.  Service was prompt, attentive and very friendly. I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and generally this place is better than average for service."
Iris S.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",9,17,14,5.0,7/18/2012,"My partner and I have been coming to this cheese cake factory, in Corte Madera, for at least five years; not because we are particularly fond of supporting large corporate chains, but because of the service. I have two words for you: Danielle & Katelin. They are the best of the best and you can find them behind the bar. Not only do they know our particular, favorite cocktails, but they've tracked our variations over the years. They also know our names and remember enough about us to ask how we are doing. I am a professional artist and my partner is a forensic engineer. We have tried lots of local restaurants and bars because we like to unwind after a long day. In fact, I sincerely believe in supporting local businesses. - But what keeps us coming back is the sense of community that Katelin & Danielle provide. If they are not behind the bar, we are both disappointed."
Nelly C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,17,,2.0,12/9/2015,Food is generally really good but seems to always be served barely lukewarm or cold.
Hollis K.,"San Rafael, CA",54,64,6,5.0,6/8/2012,I'm such a snob that I usually avoid any kind of chain reataurant like the plague.....The Cheesecake Factory has it's Vegas style Ceasars Palace decor BUT it has outside seating and I can take my dog.   And the service is always attentive and very good.....And the burgers are awesome......not just good but awesome..... Nice interesting appetizers and an entire skinny menu as well....good espresso too. There are so very few outside dining places in Marin I think this is a gem.....Im there weekly.......I definitely recommend.....sitting outside with the heatlamps reminds me of the old north beach days of Enricos......I love it.....you should too.
Pb J.,"Oakland, CA",9,150,,4.0,11/16/2012,"I cant believe I have never reviewed the Cheesecake Factory before!  I am totally in love with this chain restaurant, they are my guilty pleasure!  With a menu of over 12 pages and one full page of just the cheesecake desserts, how can you go wrong? I have never experience anything less than OK service, and on occasion you are blessed with a really friendly, attentive server who will jump at the opportunity to turn themselves inside out for you! I have fallen in love with the following dishes, and come highly recommended if you are even in a bind for what to get: + Passion Ice Tea + Peach Belini (so much fun in a glass with so little actual alcohol!) + Nachos (because how can you possibly screw nachos up? + Tamale cakes + Roasted Artichoke (when in season) + The veggie burger made primarily with bulgar and beets Word to the wise, the portion sizes are ginormous and enough to share, especially if you are thinking of getting a cheesecake to follow! Oh also!  The brown bread is amazing!!"
Bonnie L.,"San Mateo, CA",9,187,39,4.0,3/8/2012,"It's feels almost blasphemous to review a chain but even if Marin County wasn't a barren foodie desert, I'd still give this place 4 stars. The service was what was truly impressive, especially from a chain. Every time we visited the servers were quick, attentive, and looked like they were happy to be there. I've never seen such consistent service at a chain restaurant. Mind blown. They now have a Skinnylicious menu, which is awesome.The menu has a broad range of items to choose from and comes in good portions. Everything there was good. The exception were the pastas. Pasta came out dry the first time (as if it was sitting under a heat lamp) and cold the second. Ahi tuna salad rocked as did the turkey burger. So glad there's this place in Marin County!"
Dina V.,"San Francisco, CA",101,414,446,2.0,2/4/2010,"We like Cheesecake Factory, but this one hasn't been one of our best experiences. We've been to this location a few times even. It was our initial server who disappointed me. The wait was to be expected considering it was lunchtime on a Sunday and the hostesses were doing their job efficiently without being rude.  We were seated in a booth and our 1st server was soon there to take our drink orders. He came to put the napkins down for the drinks but instead of placing them down, HE LEISURELY TOSSED THEM ON THE TABLE. WTF kind of service was that? I asked for water with lemon, he brought me water no straw no lemon. So I then had to ask for my lemon. Our bread came awhile later, isn't that the first thing to hit the table even before the drinks come? The food was as expected, good! Our server was NOT on top of filling drinks either. The mister's soda was finished for quite a bit and the server was no where to be seen or found. We had to put the cup on the edge of the table for someone to notice and when he finally came out he took the cup, but never returned the refill so we had to ask him for that. Luckily for us, he was off to his break so another guy stepped in and his attentiveness was far better. I'm hoping they shared that tip b/c the mister has a tendency to overtip."
