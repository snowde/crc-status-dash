John S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,,1.0,10/12/2014,"Food was OK, about a C+. What was most disappointing was the arrogant and incompetent manager Jullian, who told us there would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table, when there was nobody else waiting and at least 25% of the tables were empty.  Will NOT go back to this food mill."
Amber C.,"Burlingame, CA",94,23,,2.0,4/14/2014,"This is the first (and possibly last) time I have visited this Cheesecake Factory. I'm more familiar with the SF location, and have always had a great experience there. Our names were taken, and after a short wait my friend and I were seated. Our waitress was friendly, and checked in with us (we took a bit of time to get settled and figure out what we want).  When the waitress returned, my friend ordered the Asian Pear Martini, and I a glass of white wine. I ordered the entree Pear and Endive salad, while my friend said she'd like to start with an appetizer salad. Imagine my surprise when my ""entree salad"" came back on a tiny plate. After poking around a bit at my salad, I didn't find any fo the grilled chicken, pear or blue cheese I had expected. My friend discovered there is also an ""Endive Salad"" on the appetizer menu, and, after conferring with the waitress, we discovered there had been a slight mixup. She had thought I wanted the appetizer Endive, not the entree Pear and Endive. An honest mistake, which she readily fixed. The Endive salad was whisked away, and after a bit my Pear and Endive salad was brought out. Here was why I gave this location two stars. The salad was extremely disappointing!!! Let me explain. I'm not a super picky food eater. Something has to be extremely awful or bland for me to dislike it. In general, I love food. But this salad was terribly bland. I could have made a better version at home for half the price. My friend and I soon discovered that the ratios of the meal were completely off. I basically received a bowl of greens with grilled chicken. The salad has almost no dressing on it. I discovered three (three!) TINY hunks of blue cheese at the bottom of my dish, and almost no walnuts. There was also almost no pear. Essentially, I ate through the slightly dry greens, and ended up enjoying about 3 bites worth of properly proportioned greens-extras mix at the bottom of my dish.  This was a huge disappointment. We all go out for dinner expecting a treat, but I ended up enjoying the complimentary bread more than the salad I ordered. I think with the proper mix of ingredients, the taste would be a hit. But this salad was an absolute no go. My friend enjoyed her appetizer salad and salmon though, so I am thrilled she picked something that was done right. She did not like her martini though, because it was very sweet, almost like syrup. The bottom of the martini had a gritty texture from the pear puree. The two stars I give: one for the waitress who was friendly and very attentive. The second: the cheesecake.  The saving grace of this meal was the cheesecake. Our waitress recommended the smores cheesecake, and my friend and I split it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Holy moly. They even top it with their house-made marshmallow fluff. It truly saved the day. I am still very much on the fence about whether to return to the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera again. The location was perfect to meet halfway with my friend for our once-a-month dinner, but my experience was less than thrilling."
Timsamstravelusa S.,"Larkspur, CA",64,70,170,3.0,5/28/2014,I wish they has another choice of preserves beside strawberry.  Great service as expected.  The breakfast is as good anywhere in Marin and less money.  I sit outside to enjoy the weather.
Wesley T.,"San Pablo, CA",1,13,1,4.0,3/10/2013,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in quite a while because of the heavy calorie desserts, but decided to go today.  The food and the service was very good and the dessert was sinful!  I had grilled Mahi Mahi over mash potatoes, with a Mediterranean tomato & artichoke sauce on top; and topped it off with Key Lime Cheese Cake.   Everything was very good, but I definitely have to go to the gym tomorrow. :)"
Cassie L.,"Sausalito, CA",4,11,,5.0,8/3/2014,"We love coming here, even though it is usually hectic and busy! But last night we came for a friends birthday and we had the nicest service! Sarah was awesome!! Made our night really enjoyable! Thank you :-)"
Amanda L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",87,119,36,5.0,4/16/2014,"I love this place. I've never had a bad experience here with service, food or anything. Servers have always been great. Food is always delicious. And the cheesecake never disappoints. Can't come here and NOT get a slice, even if you take it to go! I wish there was a closer one to us (build one in Santa Rosa!!!), but it's a treat to drive down to Corte Madera to come eat here."
Mary B.,"San Rafael, CA",106,138,39,4.0,12/19/2011,"Ok its Marin!  Not that many places open late and if you want a drink this is a poppin spot.  Today, I tried the Vietnamese tacos and not to shabby!  I do try to order something new off the menu every visit, so like I say if you see me there more then three times then it is worth trying."
Dirtyzdro B.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2014,"This was the most shittiest place in the f****** world I took down the f****** hours my damn chicken and biscuits and a wife steak and potatoes  I will never in my life come back here again is Cheesecake Factory,this is the worst place ever two thumbs down and I wouldn't eat the cheesecake cuz that took 20 mins to get,expect for the dude wit long hair cashier he's cool."
Lost B.,"New York, NY",1,468,61,3.0,1/19/2012,Maybe it was an off day but the waiter was really weird and totally forgetful. Forgot our drinks and my salad then took forever to come back with an answer. The food itself was good I ordered the Portabella mushroom sandwich which was very yummy. Their stuffed mushrooms did not taste the same as another location  for some reason. I have a receipe that is dead on the same and make these at home for my spouse and I have to say that these ones at this location were ok not great. No room for dessert.
Emmeline A.,"Fresno, CA",524,258,151,1.0,8/11/2011,"They straight up forgot about our to-go order. Meanwhile, there are groups of 5-6 servers just standing around chattin' it up. My salad was ok. The dressing on that Chinese chicken salad was much to salty for my liking. Boyfriend's fries weren't crispy anymore. Burger was the normal, chain-restaurant huge burger."
Michael H.,"Sebastopol, CA",14,21,33,5.0,4/27/2014,"First time here, and have always heard good stories about the place! Bypassed the SF place for Corte Madera, due to wait times! The cheesecakes are to die for!!!!!! I had The Pit Beef Sandwich! Oh yeah! Service was excellent!!! Very short wait for our table!!! Parking, well it's Corte Madera!!!!"
C R.,"Richmond, CA",17,245,53,3.0,5/22/2012,"We came here for dinner on Sunday. Our waiter, Daniel, was very friendly and attentive. We ended up ordering the calamari and crispy fried cheese for appetizers; then we had the tomato basil pasta and chicken alfredo pasta. Then of course.....dessert was chocolate mousse cheesecake and dulce de leche caramel cheesecake. Everything was very tasty, pastas came out steamy hot and of course dessert was wonderful. We had a birthday at our table and Daniel made the dessert special with a birthday greeting written on the plate and a ""quartet"" singing Happy Birthday. We had a great time and much of it was because of our waiter. Thanks Daniel for being a great waiter......"
Lilian N.,"Queens, NY",376,184,358,4.0,4/9/2012,"Since the Cheesecake Factory is a chain and the food is almost always great, I'll just review this particular restaurant's setting  The ambiance and size of the one in corte madera was comfortable and not overwhelming. Our waiter was extremely friendly, and despite our frequent calling him over to add food and drinks, he never once showed annoyance. Often times he came and checked on us, making sure our drinks and bread were refilled. He had a sense of humor that made our table smile, making the experience that much better. Overall, it was superb."
Will F.,"Upperville, VA",0,19,2,1.0,7/28/2014,We just had lunch at this location. Nice outside setting. I ordered roasted chicken from the gluten free menu. It was poorly prepared and not worth the price. The presentation was classic cheesecake. A plate overflowing with mashed potatoes and cubed carrots (the big kind a horse might really enjoy). The chicken instead of half or quartered was cut in pieces - probably from a steam table.
Zach C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",4,11,,3.0,6/13/2014,The food is generally solid if not amazing.  I have always received excellent service here.  The one thing I have to warn people about is to not order the nachos.  I had ordered them before and they were fine but the last time I did they used some terrible new salsa and the cheese they put on it didn't even taste like cheese.  It had some strange texture to it and where the worst nachos I have ever had.
Hesh P.,"Oakland, CA",134,30,11,1.0,4/8/2013,"DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! We went to this location for my boyfriends sisters birthday and when we got the bill we wanted to chip in not knowing what the total was. The other couple we went with paid $100 in cash, which we saw them put in the checkbook and when we got our portion to sign off on our card there was $160 bill, seemed high but we didn't want to damper her night so we signed off and never questioned it. The next day the other couple asked us how we liked the dinner and mentioned what a great deal it was, only $160! Wait a minute? That's what we paid and even after we saw him slip the $100 bill in the checkbook. So we then called the restaurant to sort everything out because essentially our waiter pocketed the cash we left. We were told there was nothing they could do until Monday so we called to follow up today and the manager on duty today told us that their waiter doesn't recall us putting $100 in the checkbook so there's no proof and since we signed off on the bill there is nothing they can do! Wow.  Food was really good, but having a waiter steal $100 just leaves a very bad taste in my mouth."
Christian H.,"San Rafael, CA",145,233,408,2.0,3/22/2009,"Let's take a moment to discuss the topic of Ketchup Cleanliness.   Corporate restaurants like this Cheesecake Factory have a condiment policy that items like ketchup always come to the table with a full bottle.  How would they do that without bringing each and every table a brand new bottle?  They DON'T.  What they do instead is have their servers marry the glass ketchup bottles so that they are ""presented full"" to each table they go to.   What's wrong with that, you ask?  First, you will notice that Heinz Ketchup  clearly tells you not to do that on the labels of their bottles.  Second, the color of the ketchup will change over time, turning more of a dark brown color.  Third, think about all the possible bacterial transfers that could happen by recycling the ketchup from table to table.  Fourth, over time...old ketchup will begin a gassy fermentation which can be noticed if you look closely and see bubbles forming in it. What happens with all that gassy fermentation, you ask?  If you were sitting at the bar last Thursday for lunch, you got the answer RIGHT IN YOUR FACE while you had lunch!  One guy opened a gassy, bacteria-infested ketchup bottle to use for his burger and the entire contents VOLCANOED out of the bottle onto everyone in a ten foot radius! Come on, Cheesecake Factory.  This problem was so five-years ago in the restaurant industry.  Order the smaller, squeezable ketchup bottles that you can't take the cap off of to marry, transfer bacteria or shower all of your customers with while they are just trying to enjoy lunch! Gross!!"
Emily E.,"Novato, CA",1,2,,1.0,11/10/2014,"My family and I had a HORRIBLE experience here. We went to celebrate my eighteenth birthday on a Saturday night. I tried to make reservations, however they only take them between11am - 12pm. Because weekends are so busy at this place, I don't think it's smart, or fair, to only accept reservations for an hour. We were given a defective pager, and ended up having to wait an extra twenty minutes. Then, the waitress didn't realize we were a party of six until she brought us all out to the patio. We had to go back to the front of the restaurant to wait for just two tables to be pushed together. In the process, our waitress hurt herself (how or to what extent, I do not know) and didn't let anyone know that we were waiting. My boyfriend repeatedly had to ask for the hosts to check on our situation. We got the impression that they totally didn't care for our service since they were completely packed. It was absolutely ridiculous, so we left after wasting two hours. I will never go here again without a reservation, and if the service has not improved I am boycotting!"
Emily C.,"Mill Valley, CA",27,321,11,2.0,2/5/2010,"I've been eating at this place for several years. I love their chopped salad and it's a great place for a quick bite and glass of wine after shopping. Tonight, for the first time ever, I had their cheesecake and I was extremely disappointed. In fact, I have to say that it was THE WORST CHEESECAKE I have ever had!! And I ordered the basic, traditional cheesecake. It was essentially frozen! No fresh baked cheesecakes served here. Shocking!! I was disgusted and would recommend people DO NOT ORDER CHEESECAKE ever from this place!! The bar waitress was nice and I tipped generously despite the lousy cheesecake. I will NEVER order it again. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
Emy B.,"San Francisco, CA",34,489,197,4.0,1/23/2012,"I've been here so many times...I'm more of a fan now that they have a ""skinnylicious"" menu.  I'm trying to watch what I eat and this menu is so helpful.  I loved the chicken white bean chilli with brown rice, less than 590 calories for the meal =) ... plus I love that they offer grilled chicken with veggies as an option for the kids menu.  It frustrates me to always see mac & cheese, hot dogs, or hamburgers on kids menus these days so this is pretty refreshing."
