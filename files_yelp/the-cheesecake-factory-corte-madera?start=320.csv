Pat L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",4,50,,3.0,1/8/2013,"For everyone who avoids the Cheesecake Factory because they value their waistline - avoid no more!!!  They now have a Skinny menu and it is quite good  with many choices.  I would never, never go their because of the unhealthy food but was forced to go as a cooperative gesture.  What a nice surprise.  I had the Chinese chicken salad, my friend the Chicken salad sandwich and another friend the enchiladas - all under 590 calories.  Not exactly Weight watchers but good enough for us.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for entering the quest for smaller behinds!!"
Munther H.,"Marysville, CA",31,61,170,4.0,3/15/2014,"I've really never had any problems at the cheesecake factory in corte madera, except for once a couple years back when I waited 90 mins for my food. Excusing that one instance, the food is quality and the desserts are luscious and tempting. Pasta Da Vinci is my favorite, with the Salmon next in line. The wait times can be a little frustrating at times, but nonetheless it is one of the better options in Marin."
Orland R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,95,52,4.0,11/18/2014,"Food is always excellent, many choices. The waiter. To night, no so good, seemed to be in a hurry, we felt rushed. He didn't bring me a plate or napkin. I used the bread paper napkin, he never noticed throughout my dinner.  Shame on him.. But the food is excellent, food gets 4 stars, waiter -4..."
Lars S.,"Novato, CA",62,441,708,4.0,1/3/2014,"This place never disappoints, when it comes to the food or the service and today was no exception.  I have been to many different locations and have never had a bad experience.  I therefore have a hard time taking people seriously who rate this place one star.  It did take a while to get our food this time because the place was packed.  There must be a reason why you almost always have to wait for a table.  The Steak Diane is to die for!"
Davet M.,"San Francisco, CA",97,145,23,1.0,11/9/2012,"Poor, poor customer service. Never got a refill of water. Never got asked how things were going. Never got the check. He even had the balls to clown my husband for wearing his 49ers gear. We could've walked out and no body would've noticed. They were so lucky that we are honest people. I finally had to ask another waitress to get our waiter (who never came back). She gave us our to-go boxes and our check. Dude must have been in training or something. Train your new people right. You're ruining your reputation by hiring incompetent help!"
Alexa B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",8,28,3,3.0,1/15/2012,"This was my first time to the Cheesecake Factory, and I ordered the Fried Mac n Cheese appetizer and the Garlic Noodle entree. I had promised a friend I would try the Fried Mac n Cheese and I'm glad I did! It was sinfully delicious. The Garlic Noodle was nothing special, however. It was actually quite boring.  The service was not great... the waiter started out by bringing our party of 4 a bread basket with only 2 pads of butter, said he would be right back with more butter, and then kept forgetting the butter after we reminded him three times. He only checked on us once after getting our meal, and our water glasses were empty for a while.  Despite all this, this restaurant gets three stars because of the main event: Dessert. First of all, the dessert menu is extraordinary. Any dessert imaginable - in cheesecake form. Our group ordered and shared 4 different kinds: Red Velvet (great if you love a mouthful of cream cheese frosting), Dulce de Leche (smooth, fluffy and by far the best choice of the evening), Pineapple Upside Down (interesting but wouldn't order again), and Chocolate Mousse (pure chocolate ecstasy).  So, overall, I'd go there again for the Fried Mac n Cheese and to try four more varieties of cheesecake!"
Vee D.,"San Francisco, CA",16,6,,5.0,4/16/2015,"Stopped by the Cheesecake factory today for lunch and the place was slammed. I placed a to go order and though there was a little mishap, I called and spoke to the manager and he was AWESOME! I ended up with a delicious gluten free turkey burger, a side of avocado and a slice of yummy gluten-free cheesecake!! Overall great experience!!!"
Bethany G.,"Novato, CA",14,12,,5.0,4/2/2014,I love it here. The whole staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating even when I have been in on the busiest nights. The cheesecake is delicious of course too! Their Chicken Picante pasta is my favorite.
Nadja B.,"San Diego, CA",37,88,24,4.0,4/9/2013,"I love this place!!!!! Big fan of their cakes.The food is always yummy and the staff is always friendly (at least the times I've been there). I really can't complain much about it, prices are a little high but I think the happy hour is a good alternative."
Catherine N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/23/2012,"I rated this CF 1 star to get the attention of someone in CF's Management.  My husband and  I have been ordering take-out from this CF at least 2x/month for the last 3+ years.  The food and service had always been excellent.  The food still is.  I'm taking the time to write this rant to get your Take-Out service fixed because I want to order your food so I don't have to sit and wait 15-20 after I place the order when I arrive.  I'm NOT scamming for free food or gift certificates! Unfortunately for the last 3 months or so we've found it nearly impossible to place our order.  I start trying to place the order once we exit the Waldo tunnel and I am ALWAYS put on hold.  I've tried holding until we get to CF.  I've tried hanging up, redialing, and complaining to the receptionist who answers that NO, I do not want to be put on hold.  Finally, last Tuesday (8-21-12), I walked into CF still on hold and asked for ""the manager""  A young lady who said she was ""the manager"" apologized profusely and said they'd been really busy...yet there was only one order sitting there and no other cars outside in the pick-up area. She explained that it's just her (running between the kitchen and the counter/car) and the server behind the counter.  Only they (or her?) can take the orders because there are more than 200 items and the receptionist's aren't capable of asking the right questions.  Since the restaurant wasn't busy I asked why the servers couldn't help out when they were busy and that they shouldn't leave customers on hold for so long.   Prior to 2-3 months ago we were only rarely put on hold and only for a minute or two.  I haven't been able to successfully place an order by phone since then. Since it only takes 15 minutes or so to prepare the order (yeah!!) placing the order earlier doesn't work.  IF I have to walk inside to order...what is the purpose of your pick-up area?  Why is the receptionist answering the phone for Take-out if all she is going to do is put me on hold?  What process ensures that somebody eventually takes the held calls?  The few times I've managed to place the order before arriving was when I hung up and dialed until the person answering was different and took the order directly.  I've also sat on hold for 15 minutes only to have my calls dropped.  I want Take-Out fixed!!"
Julia F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,66,93,3.0,8/18/2011,"Had the avocado egg rolls yet again, but they were less good this time. Their quality really fluctuates so the food can be really good or just plain mediocre, like it was this time. So just know that you won't get exactly the same thing each time."
Vincent L.,"San Ramon, CA",294,86,27,4.0,8/24/2011,"I didn't expect to like this place nearly as much as I did. The food was good, the service was attentive, and the setting was perfect for the mood that had us stop in to have a nice dinner. We opted for an assortment of small plates and appetizers and we made the right choice! The stuffed mushrooms were divine although a little bit too rich for my companion (which meant that I got to have most of them). We both loved the Southwestern style egg rolls. I've never thought much of The Cheesecake Factory because it always seemed like the kind of place you go when one of your co-workers sets it up for someone's birthday. But I am reformed! I liked the decor, I liked the wait staff (and could tell that they're well-trained), and the food was clearly well conceived and well prepared. I'll go back again soon."
Amanda P.,"San Francisco, CA",19,260,3,5.0,12/18/2010,"I have two words for you: Farmhouse Cheeseburger.  Holy moly, I am in love with this burger: big burger patty, cheddar cheese, lettuce, onion (yes they will give you grilled if you ask), tomato, mayo, smoked pork belly, a sunny-side-up egg, on a brioche bun.  Wooooow.  Fries were decent - really just okay.  Bread was yummy.  We did take some of the cheesecake to go, but haven't even eaten it yet - just the smell of it in the car tells me it will be good.  Perhaps slightly too expensive, but good. Not really sure why there's so many reviews here that say nothing negative about CF and still give only three stars.  Upset that it's a chain?  Meh, get over it.  To me, there's nothing inherently bad about a chain.  I've been to plenty of one-off restaurants that suck.  Also I read some people complained about the caloric content of this place.  Have you actually looked at the nutritional information in most restaurants?  Terrifying.  At least this place's ""healthy salads"" were under 590 calories, not around 700 like other places... Prices were pretty fair - about high average for this caliber of place.  Service was friendly and not too slow.  My only real complaint is that there wasn't enough seating for people who were waiting to be seated for their meal."
Erin G.,"San Bruno, CA",4,37,15,5.0,12/15/2013,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location in the Bay Area. If you come here, try the Hibachi Steak or the Gumbo. Very Good!"
Anad G.,"Oakland, CA",19,32,40,5.0,9/10/2010,"No, for real it's Cheesecake Factory, everything is good. I'm stuck on the same dishes. The ""Chicken Bellagio"" is a plate of heaven and if you need a switch the ""Louisiana Chicken Pasta"" is so good it makes no sense! Of course the Strawberry Lemonade should be bottles and sold in the store, it's so good. On to dessert: the LemonChello Cake, DAMN!"
SoCalSkippy ..,"Victorville, CA",0,202,28,4.0,10/1/2011,"My Fiancee and I came here for dinner one night during our romantic week-long getaway to Napa. We've been to the Cheesecake Factory a billion times before, so there's not much to say about this particular location because they're all the same for the most part. The building was nice, the inside is fairly small though, the service was good, the food tasted great (as always) and the dessert was amazing too! My only gripe (and I've had this same gripe forever) is that this place is ridiculously pricey; if they could lower the prices a bit...this place would easily get a 5 star rating from me and more business too!"
stephanie p.,"San Rafael, CA",12,289,2,4.0,8/28/2011,"We don't go to the cheesecake factory that often but towards the end of my pregnancy we ventured in and I fell in love with the warm crab dip, since than we go at least once a month, sometimes more, service is always nice! never have had  a bad meal here. Love the chicken di pano"
Dianne R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,12,,2.0,1/15/2014,"Eeeek! Very pricey, bad service and really loud. Now the cheesecake is great, but you pay for it. I went with a friend before Christmas and she had to send her drink back because it was so bad. Then the waitress forgot to turn our order in, so it took forever to get a salad and nachos. I will not go back there.... ever!"
Marcus K.,"San Francisco, CA",640,1076,1897,3.0,5/15/2009,"Been here half a dozen times over the years and I keep coming back.   Its a nice food selection that covers fish, salads, meats, pastas, ethnic cuisines including Mex, Thai, and more.   They also have a low calorie (skinny) menu.  Most of what i tried has been very good.   Ironically, I've never been a fan of their desserts.  Cheesecake is too sweet and rich other offerings are kinda meh.  Just tried the curbside delivery but doesn't seem to be working.  I better go in and see.   They are a bit pricey so keep that in mind."
SF U.,"San Francisco, CA",3,244,42,4.0,7/10/2013,"it may be a chain, however the food is always consistent.  i have prob had close to everything on the menu over the years, and have only just learned about sunday brunch and happy hour specials.  always solid and lots to choose from :) so easy with groups and children too."
