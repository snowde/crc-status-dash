Erika S.,"Belmont, CA",384,205,29,3.0,5/19/2013,It's good to have in the neighborhood but then again...it's a chain and the many food choices in their menu is so confusing.
Nikki N.,"Vallejo, CA",37,411,,5.0,4/27/2012,"I never met a CF I didn't like. Love this place because they are open late til 11 pm which allows me to enjoy dinner with my gf without feeling rushed. Nikki, our waitress, was very impressive and gave many helpful suggestions on dinner and dessert."
Kris D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",27,35,11,4.0,10/7/2012,"Super good. It was my first time there and my boyfriend an I love it. Only thing is there so many options for food that you kinda get lost on what to order. Other than that food great, service was great, and atmosphere was great too. Will be driving 40+ minutes to eat there again. Cheese cake is to die for!"
B B.,"Novato, CA",2,83,3,5.0,12/7/2013,"Great food; this is true of all the Cheesecake Factory locations.  What really sets this place apart is the service.  Our server, Johanna, was absolutely incredible."
Sina T.,"Kentfield, CA",5,34,,1.0,12/6/2012,"There is no consistency in the service here. Once it is amazing, but 3 out of 4 it is horrible. They need to learn time management. Also, twice they overcharged my credit card and after I just noticed that there is a big difference in the check and the credit card receipt they just apologized.  I will do my best to avoid this place in the future."
Sophia O.,"Novato, CA",226,90,31,4.0,5/4/2011,"I came here for lunch wanting to sit out on the patio, and we had our choice of tables, but it was a little chilly in the shade, so we sat inside. I loved that it wasn't too crowded, because I didn't feel so bad that I take up so much space with my baby in her stroller. The lunch ""smaller"" portions are about the size of a large dinner portion anywhere else!! I had the lunch sized Luau salad and LOVED it! The cheesecakes are ALL amazingly sinful! The carb-free cheesecakes are actually REALLY good! Nice & creamy, without the guilt... the carb-free cheesecake with strawberries is just fresh strawberries & whipped cream on the side."
Glenn G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",242,297,55,4.0,5/20/2013,Really good food. The server was friendly and never left us alone too long. Only knock is because of the prices.
Jack H.,"Hot Springs, AR",36,270,53,4.0,5/13/2013,This place is definitely atypical for a chain restaurant.  Everything I've ever had on the menu is delicious and consistently so.  The ambiance is fun at this location too.  The down side is the noise level is usually pretty loud and the menu is so huge!  Normally I shy away from a restaurant with a book for a menu as that normally means they have a ton of items they're okay at and none that are awesome.  This one is an exception though.
Jasmine H.,"Albany, CA",37,63,6,4.0,5/11/2013,"Reasonable prices, large portions, friendly staff! Their pulled pork sandwich is really good. They take special requests like no salt on fries or no bun! Their bread is and drinks are good. Cheesecake to die for and a newer SkinnyLicious menu all dishes under 500 calories. The chicken tacos are good and filling! I like this location, walnut creek and San Francisco (above Macys in Union Square)!"
Shannon S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,67,87,4.0,11/5/2012,"Overall Great experience.. We sat at the bar ordered small plates which are basically tapas, not expensive and small. So two people can order 2-3 and feel satisfied. We ordered the beet salad and crispy artichoke hearts. Loved the beet salad that had arugula and chunks of goat cheese, candied pecans, granny smith apples and beets. Tony p was our bartender. He recommended and made the best drink Ever! Strawberry martini... Divine!!!!! Muddled strawberries and vodka. So good. Will come back again the next time we shop at Nordys.!"
Don F.,"Petaluma, CA",65,241,729,5.0,2/21/2009,"Came by before 5pm and had no trouble getting a table. I have always had good service and food here. Tonight was no different. I had the pulled pork sandwich and brownie sunday cheesecake. The wife had some kind of salad and some kind of cheesecake. Always leave stuffed! We went to Macy's and the Apple store, then came back by here and there was people waiting to get in."
AnonX X.,"Oakland, CA",0,115,4,1.0,6/14/2014,"I've been to a few different locations. Food is usually good. Ordered a margherita pizza at the Corte Madera restaurant. Asked for added mushrooms... so they cooked it without sauce? Sent it back. They cooked another one, with sauce, but it was so salty I couldn't eat it. The pizza they messed up was better than the corrected version. Didn't look good. Didn't smell good. Didn't taste good. It was flat out nasty, and I rarely say that about a pizza. It seemed like it was frozen. Yuck!"
Stacey C.,"Fairfax, CA",110,507,38,3.0,2/10/2009,"It really is a strange big room with a Vegas atmosphere. I don't usually review let alone go to chain restaurants but hunger hit when the sun went down and we had to eat fast.  We had extremely attentive service, food came within 15 minutes of ordering. The menu is pretty vast.  My pasta with roast veggies was tasty all things considered. I assume when I go to places like that that my food at the best of times will be a little salty and will lack complexity and may contain a lot of corn starch.  With my large pasta dish (enough for two meals for me), a pellegrino and coffee I paid about $20.00. I certainly wouldn't have wanted to pay more so I guess it's safe to say this exceeded some of my expectations."
Barbara S.,"Mill Valley, CA",115,532,59,4.0,3/7/2013,"My hubby and I discovered recently that they have a ""skinny"" menu. It has a lot of offerings and none of the dishes have more than 500 something calories. The two dishes we've been sharing are the shrimp creole and the seared ahi tuna salad platter. Both are delicious and very satisfying. We usually split both. I don't normally go for chains, but their skinny menu has won us over. Lots of tasty sounding things are on that menu and we plan to work our way through it."
Sara T.,"Marin County, CA",3,97,56,4.0,3/31/2013,"We like the cheesecake factory,  especially the barbecue salmon (with fries and a side salad) and the Santa Fe salad. The atmosphere is fun. We just wish it weren't so expensive."
Debra G.,"Benicia, CA",4,37,4,5.0,8/23/2014,"8-16-2014 my first time to Cheesecake Factory.  OMG!  Huge line about 7 pm, but space at a little table at the end of the bar and my sister-in-law and I sat there, with no wait.  The bar tender/our hostess was so friendly and helpful.  The menu is huge, plus there's the one with special or lighter fares.  I ordered Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos (or something like that) and a grilled artichoke.  The lettuce tacos had a couple of great sauces on the side.  The artichoke was medium size, grilled perfectly and had a good aioli.  The two dishes were about $7-8 each, and enough for dinner... that is until I got home and had room for some of the big serving of Apple crisp, vanilla ice cream & whipped cream to go!  Lots of firm apples, good cinnamon flavor.  Topping was more like Dutch Apple pie than crisp with oatmeal, but it was great!  I enjoyed 1/2 that night and breakfast the next morning.  I don't often like chain restaurants so much, but this obviously higher-end one was an exception.  I'll definitely be going back."
Ronald R.,"San Mateo, CA",10,27,12,1.0,5/4/2010,"I haven't eaten at this C.F. yet, but have done so at the San Jose location once, but wanted to bring readers' attention to the fact that C.F. as been called ""THE WORST RESTAURANT IN AMERICA."" No surprise they routinely appears in those ""WORST OF"" or ""EAT THIS, NOT THAT"" lists!  Sure, the food and drinks can be TASTY and portions are HUGE, but there are such dubious ""awards"" as the: ""WORST RESTAURANT IN AMERICA"" as far as FAT and SALT goes.  Cheesecake Factory offers the WORST BREAKFAST IN AMERICA, ranked #19 out of 20 Won the ""WORST SANDWICH in AMERICA""  with as much Saturated FAT as in 10 strips of Bacon, and more than the daily maximum recommended salt intake.     I guess dining here very rarely and avoiding some of their more egregious FAT BOMB choices, should be acceptable.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!"
Drew F.,"Oakland, CA",42,113,228,4.0,2/15/2013,"I recently had the chance to go back to back cheescake factory hoppin, first a stop at Union Square and the next day corte madera. I found the staff a step up from Union Square, especially liked the no waiting part. Prices were the same but this place was not as crowded and service was way better. Of course there was no sweet view but it made up in service. If they had a high rise view we would only visit this one."
Andrew G.,"Baltimore, MD",0,34,,3.0,10/22/2014,Just as good as any other cheesecake factory.... I had the meatloaf and was pleased.  Sometimes their menu is just too much to look at.  Is it possible to have too many options? I think it might be
Antoine J.,"Oakland, CA",147,20,10,3.0,10/6/2010,"I'd give all Cheesecake Factory's 3 and a half. All have happy hour (except Union Square), and all serve HUGE portions. I usually stop at this CF leaving SF and crossing both the GG bridge and the San Rafael bridge back to the eastbay-waiting for traffic to die down. Standard American fare- if you been to one you've been to them all. You always know what your going to get- and you'll probably need a doggie bag. Of course the Cheesecake itself is to die for....the Red Velvet one is smackin."
