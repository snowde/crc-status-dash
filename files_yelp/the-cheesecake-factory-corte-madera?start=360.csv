Christina E.,"San Rafael, CA",0,20,37,5.0,5/25/2013,Love this place the food in always good. Best server is definitely Justin. I always ask for him cause he makes our night even more enjoyable. ;)
Daniel P.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,16,,2.0,9/30/2013,"If they would put less food on the plates and serve a better meal, I would give them 3 stars. As it is, it is typical american eating. More is better. Not my choice of restaurant fair."
David D.,"San Francisco, CA",83,328,2,4.0,2/25/2010,"I typically tend to like this place. The food is usually decent and the service is very good. I personally recommend the chicken madeira. It is truly excellent in my opinion. And dont even get me started on the cheesecake! Its freakin awesome! HOWEVER their cheesecake is incredibly dense. Dont even try eating one on your own. You wont finish half of it! But dont worry, I'l be there to help you out with the other half : )"
Kandice S.,"Sausalito, CA",84,12,1,4.0,8/4/2012,"I always like going to cheese factory with a group of people because their menu is endless...and everyone can find something of their liking....their food is usually really good, and most the time the service is okay, not always though..avoid rush times if possible, because then you will be waiting forever. My only complaint is the waiting and how noisy it could get during rush hour but over all I give it 4 stars for the beautiful decorated restaurant, great food, and decent service when it's not too busy."
Jennifer T.,"Pleasanton, CA",16,41,25,5.0,1/24/2013,"I always loved CF! It's a highly known establishment, so the food is always consistent. This place is just like any other CFs. Waiters and waitresses are mostly nice, every once in a while I get a not so great one."
David C.,"Knoxville, TN",59,196,235,4.0,10/28/2009,"Last night, my wife and I took our eldest daughter and her husband out for a dinner to celebrate her birthday.  She has often talked about wanting to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, so we planned to make the Corte Madera location our ""secret"" destination. My wife and I have eaten at the Union Square Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco and enjoyed the atmosphere and food, but let me tell you this ... the Corte Madera location is far better in most every aspect including atmosphere, decor, knowledgable wait staff, friendly employees, great prices, large portions that lend themselves to doggie bags, FREE, EASY & CLOSE By PARKING, just to name a few. We arrived shortly after 7 pm and were immediately seated in a cozy, private booth by our vivacious and bubbly hostess.  Soon afterwards, we were greeted by Kate, our server, who never lapsed or missed a beat during our meal. The Chicken Madeira (Kate's recommendation) was INCREDIBLE and exceeded the exhuberant description provided by Kate.  The Salmon Scampi Combo was declicous mouth-watering beyond belief.  The Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp would make the King of Siam green with envy.   The Jambalaya Pasta which I ordered, because it was the entree most closely akin to Weight Watcher standards, didn't pass muster.  The chicken was succulent, but the shrimp and sausage were dry and over-cooked.  The pasta was a dente as it should have been, but someone in the kitchen got carried away with powdering the entire dish with chili powder.   Argh!   Sometimes I HATE weight watchers! The Kahlua Coca Coffee Cheesecake and the Pumpkin Cheesecake were divine. The staff at Corte Madera knows what they're doing and other than the Jumbalaya Pasta, it all blended for an evening of splendid repaste."
Tatiane B.,"Hercules, CA",38,83,25,5.0,12/8/2012,"First time in the restaurant for my bday celebration,11 of us. Took an hour and half to get a table but its holiday season and the mall was full. My cousin kept saying how great food was here and i have to agree! I tried the firefly drink,and boy was that yum! The lady serving us was very nice. I ordered jamaican black pepper shrimp to share with mom ( save space for cheesecake) and the plate is good enough for two,if you eat small portions like we do. Food was delicious and so was everyones else cause i tried from everyones plate lol The cheesecake was awesome!!! I tried again from everyones : banana ,key lime,pumpkin and godiva chocolate!! Yum,yum,yum!!! We cant wait to go back again and eat more! Dont even want to think about calories!! ;)"
James L.,"San Rafael, CA",0,21,,2.0,8/13/2014,"I'm still giving this place 2 stars for all the other times I've been there and had a good experience.  This last time we went, we were a group of 5 people and all shared a artichoke and spinach dip, while having individual entrees for dinner. We all fealt really bad the next day, two of us actually had to go to the e.r for food poisoning ( fortunately) I wasn't one of them.  I called them up and told them about the situation, and informed them there was no doubt in my mind that the dip made us all sick. I asked her if she had any other reports of people feeling the same last night and she told me no. Funny enough, I called my friend to see how he was doing and he told me he had gotten off phone with the manager 20 minutes before I called reporting that the artichoke dip made him sick. Hmmm, not cool management. As bad as it may seem to admit your food made us sick, you should have the morality of advising us that others reported food poisoning, and that medical attention was needed in the other incidents ( my buddies fiancé was one of the 2 people in the e.r), he made sure the management was aware.  They did ask me for my address to send a gift certificate; at least they were apologetic; however I did not give it to them and have no intentions of ever risking feeling that way at a Cheesecake Factory ever again"
Carrie S.,"San Francisco, CA",21,128,20,4.0,2/24/2010,"Just had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory last night. I really enjoyed myself. I started at the bar with a GG martini, dry and up with olives and it was made perfectly and served in a nice frozen glass. The bartender was friendly and fast! I was meeting girlfriends that evening and we had a booth in the back. Our food server (Mathew) was very friendly and made sure to introduce himself to us (twice even when someone arrived late!). He rattled off the specials of the day with ease and aplomb and made them sound so delish we ordered one! The crab artichoke dip was yummy and started the meal off with a bang. We all tend to order the same things every time we go to TCF but the food is always consistent and fresh. Half the table ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad (yum), someone ordered the fresh spring rolls as an entree which worked out well, another ordered the fish tacos which are always a standout.  We skipped dessert but took several slices of cheesecake to go. Our waiter even brought our girlfriend (who announced she's expecting again) an ice cream sundae on the house! TCF is a great place to go with a group, kids, or even a date. It's fun, there are TONS of food options and the service is reliably good."
Wesley L.,"Stockton, CA",5,76,38,3.0,1/4/2013,"Awesome cheesecake ... as you'd expect. I got the one with butterfingers and all kinds of other bad for you stuff that made it just perfect. The service was just OK; it could have been much better. The weird thing was watching a couple bring their dog, obviously not a service dog, into the restaurant. If they were seated outside, I'd understand. The management was well aware and just allowed them to exist. Maybe those people were wealthy and the employees were afraid of offending them. Whatever. I didn't appreciate sitting in a restaurant a few feet from a dirty animal. That's the bay area for you."
Ernest S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,34,6,3.0,1/21/2013,"Too BIG, too many choices that prevents great execution. nice atmosphere, but too BIG for my likes. Always busy so i guess it is liked."
Gabrielle C.,"Rockwall, TX",272,145,16,2.0,5/10/2009,"I must have a selective memory when it comes to The Cheesecake Factory. For some reason I always seem to think that the service ""isn't that bad"" and today, again, I was reminded of just how wrong I can be.  NOTE:: The food is great, this review has nothing to do with the food, which is probably why I keep suffering through a meal here, because I so enjoy the vast menu of yumminess.  Don't tell anyone but I'm pretty sure our server was an auto-bot of some sort because his voice never changed tone and I'm pretty sure I didn't see any facial expressions. And someone forgot to program the ""check on your tables after they get their food"" setting because after we got our food he didn't come check on us until we were actually done eating.  In our desperate attempt to quench our thirst we had to ask a food runner for a refill but he said ""your server (aka auto-bot) will help you,"" in the end, another lovely server who obviously knows what she was doing (wish she had been MY server) got our refills.  In addition we were sat without the following: silverware, salt, pepper, condiments and bread, although I realize the bread comes after the fact.  Again, food good, service, really, really poor. I would recommend eating at the bar where the bartenders have no way of getting away from you.  And don't forget to try the Strawberry Lemonade which is heaven in a glass and of course, the cheesecake is straight up a slice of heaven!"
Marie K.,"Larkspur, CA",12,72,2,3.0,6/6/2010,"Chain restaurants are never my first choice, but the Cheescake Factory is decent enough for one.  It is a good place for a quick lunch while out shopping with the girls, or to meet some pals for a Happy Hour.  The appetizers are good to share with friends over drinks- and one of my fave sandwiches is the Shrimp Club.  Yum. Kid friendly?  Eh- debatable.  They have a kids menu, ok.  But restaurants that classify themselves as ""Kid Friendly"" should at least offer some crayons and something to doodle on.  The best kid friendly restaurants all do!  I know, all my friends without kids give me the ""You should come prepared and bring that stuff with you"".  Well, maybe- but once you have kids you truly appreciate the places that try to make taking your kids out just a little easier- and those places get more of my $$$, for sure.   All in all, good place for lunch or dinner with older kids and adults- but if you're looking for a familiy night out with young kids-- go over to Max's across the freeway."
Betty S.,"San Francisco, CA",79,281,2,3.0,4/26/2009,"Came here last night for dinner and we left very full and happy people. Normally I would avoid the Cheesecake Factory like the plague - but I took my chances and hope that we didn't have to wait 2 hrs for a table. We got there at 9pm - rather late for dinner and we only had to wait 5-10 mins max. Perfect! We were seated quickly and the waiter took our order. I like how they they give you fresh rye and sourdough bread with butter to munch on while you wait for your food.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls - one of my favorite appetizers here. It was really delicious but the dipping sauce was a little sweet. We also ordered the Cuban sandwich and substituted the fries for a side of mac and cheese. The sandwich was actually really good - not oily and with a unique taste. The mac and cheese was delicious - made with white cheddar and was creamy and not too cheesy. I could have just had a side of that for dinner. The strawberry lemonade was good - but way too sweet.  Overall our experience here was good. We didn't have to wait the normal 1-2 hrs for a seat, and the service here was actually very attentive. Portions here are huge so I suggest sharing if you can. We didn't even order a lot, and we took half a sandwich home. The cheesecake looked really good and there was a great selection but we were really full. Next time, I'll try to go back and save room for a piece of cheesecake."
Allie A.,"San Francisco, CA",128,51,7,2.0,11/20/2011,"I visited this location very recently, servers were nice, but definitely not attentive, they literally took forever to bring the food, and took over half and hour just to bring the check to our table. I'm guessing they thought we wanted to stay there the whole night. Not sure if I'll be heading back to this specific location anytime soon."
Justin L.,"Stanford, CA",1240,545,232,3.0,6/20/2007,"My Rating:  3.5 STARS Okay, hate to admit it...but every so often I get the urge to hit up Cheesecake.  Yeah, yeah...I know it's a tourist trap...and I know it's not exactly ""fine"" dining...but hey, I really dig the appetizers. The thing I however hate most about Cheesecake is the ridiculously long wait to get seated.  If you're already hungry and you try to go to the Union Square, Palo Alto or Valley Fair locations, forget about being seated before you pass out from hypoglycemia. Because of the typically insane waitlist on any given night, I have avoided Cheesecake altogether for quite some time.  My explorations of the Bay recently led me to The Village at Corte Madera (sounds like some sequel from M. Night Shyamalan).  Situated right next to Nordstrom sits a Cheesecake Factory that I had no idea existed.  Feeling famished from a long day, we stopped by.  While we were already prepared to be turned away by the host telling us that there was an hour+ wait...we were actually shocked when he said we would be seated in 10-15 min.  And as promised, our little restaurant pager lit up within 15 min.  We were set up with a nice table out on the patio right under a heat lamp.  Waitress was very pleasant and provided us with really good service.  We ordered the appetizer sampler of course...avocado eggrolls were so excellente after working up an appetite from explorin' the Marin Headlands.  For dessert, I have never really enjoyed any of their actual cheesecakes...so this time I sampled the Chocolate Truffle Cake.  If you like chocolate...get this cake...period. So if you're ever tired of fighting to hit all the foodie hotspots and you simply want some huge portions of fatty American food...this Cheesecake location will hit the spot...without the wait!"
Sami R.,"San Francisco, CA",8,170,,3.0,7/5/2010,"Chain restaurants tend to have it tough when it comes to Yelp reviews, as the bar seems to be set at a higher mark for them simply because of that. We have been to plenty of four star Yelp rated restaurants, which ended up being lackluster, while we have been to several chain restaurants with low ratings that ended up being fairly good. Chevy's is one, Cheesecake Factory is another. This place isn't fantastic, but our experience here was overall good. We ordered the Caesar Salad and the Basil Chicken pasta. The portions here are huge, with both being more than enough to keep us full with enough left overs for an entire second meal at a later occasion as well. The service was also more or less good, as the waitress kept our bread full before the food arrived. However, there was a huge delay in terms of the process of getting our check.  Pasta was good though, salad was good. Neither was top of the line, and we have had better elsewhere, but each was still tasty in its own right and something we were glad we ordered in the end. We did end up asking for some extra Caesar dressing, though, as it was lacking a little in that department, and the waitress was happy to bring us another container. Overall, this place was good. We are kind of conflicted between 3 and 4 stars. There are aspects of it that seem to apply to both just being ""okay"" and being ""very good"". Suffice to say, though, that we will be going back to a Cheesecake Factory in the future, this location or another, when we feel like pigging out on some huge portions."
Don H.,"Sonoma, CA",0,109,126,4.0,3/4/2011,Beautify restaurant with great servers and excellent food. You cannot good wrong dining here. The cheesecake is the BEST I have ever had.

Adriana L.,"Millbrae, CA",0,51,8,3.0,7/26/2012,"Good ol' Cheesecake Factory! Nice place to go when you can't make up your mind what you want to eat. You will surely find something in their huge menu and the addition of the Skinny Menu was nice so you'd feel less guilty wolfing down that fat cheesecake at the end. LOL. Nice service, meh food but you know it's ALL about the Cheesecake!!! My favorites: Godiva, Cookie Dough, Original w/fresh strawberries...mmmm!"
