Luis C.,"Albany, CA",7,62,,3.0,5/13/2010,"Been a long time since I've written a review and even longer since I had eaten at a chain restaurant, but after a few hours of window shopping, actual shopping and ogling over a table we vowed would be the centerpiece of our dining room, we found ourselves suddenly starving. Unfamiliar with the culinary offerings in Corte Madera, we settled on Cheesecake Factory. ""For reals?"" I questioned hubby. ""For real!"" he replied. So in we went...and was told to wait around 30 minutes. 30 more minutes to try different chairs, stare at the table, imagine it in our dining room. Restoration Hardware is such a temptress...ahem...and a story, err review for another time. As for Cheesecake Factory, I had forgotten how extensive a menu it has! Seems like there's definitely Asian and Italian leanings. Although I went with my safe choice-- neither here nor there-- a yummy jambalaya. Hubby had a tougher time deciding between two dishes: steak and steak. Okay, to be more precise, it was a fight between ribeye and Hibachi. Now, I thought Hibachi was an old TV brand or some kind of crappy outdoor grill, but never knew it could describe a steak. And from hubby's expression (quite the self-proclaimed steak connoisseur by the way) he was pleasantly surprised! Tangy, sweet but not too sweet, smoky, tender wonderful steak!! Almost as good as my jambalaya. And it was accompanied by a large yummy mound of garlic mashed potatoes. Yum! So all in all, not too bad for a chain. And a very good meal. Oh- we still managed to stalk the table from the window before heading to our car."
AnnaMarie S.,"Vallejo, CA",16,73,4,3.0,3/29/2010,"You can't really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory's food or cheesecake. The food is amazing and the cheesecakes are little pieces of heaven. Also, the menu provides a huge variety of food from pastas, steaks to sandwiches to fit anybody's taste buds.  I'll be reviewing the service and how kid friendly it was. I made a huge mistake by not finding out what my server's name was but all i know is that she was AMAZING! She had long curly brownish hair and was probably in her early twenties. She made sure that we had bread on the table, drinks were filled and even gave us the status of our order since it took a little longer. Its amazing how wonderful a dining experience can be when you have a server who's attentive & friendly. She was great.  My little girl is at that age where she hates sitting still... oh and lucky us, she HATES high chairs. I asked for some crayons and paper but  was told they didn't have any. I mean, really? You have a kids menu but no crayons or paper? We weren't expecting to eat out but now I know that if we ever go to a cheesecake factory again, we'd have to bring our  own supplies. Which is fine but slightly disappointing.  Also, the touch faucet in the bathroom is so irritating. I was holding my daughter and every time I would touch the faucet & put her hands under there, it stopped. It was such a hassle to just wash her hands that I ended up with a wet t-shirt when I came out.  This place is great for a group of friends and a date with the hubby though."
Lay Lay G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",2,21,1,5.0,7/21/2012,"Just had lunch today their! They had yummy appetizer bread! I really enjoyed the wheat bread they serve. The passion tea was awesome! Our waitress was super nice, fast and she provided great service. I ordered the rodeo BBQ burger I think that's what it's called. Anyway it was sooo yummy! The burger was juicy! It was a great burger.I recommended with sweet potatoe fries. We also got the white chocolate Carmel macadamia but cheese cake n chocolate coconut cheese cake. They were pretty tasty! Guaranteed you will be stuffed n satisfied after leaving this spot! :)"
KC C.,"San Rafael, CA",6,81,17,2.0,5/20/2009,"The service at this branch of the chain is terrible. I've never, ever left a restaurant without leaving any tip EXCEPT for the last time I ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera.  I was there for lunch, eating alone. Was never checked on. Never offered drink refills, and I essentially had to stand up and flag down the waitress in order to get my bill (after waiting at least 15-20 minutes - I was reading my book, but still - she didn't even check on me) I made eye contact with several of the other staff but they had the ""that's not my area"" attitude and didn't respond & pretended to not notice.  Anyways, I will not return to this restaurant. The service does suck, and seems to correlate with others regarding the terrible service."
M L.,"San Rafael, CA",36,15,3,4.0,7/11/2012,Standard busy Cheesecake Factory Restaurant.  Try to avoid the main eating hours of 12-1pm or 5-7pm...may need to wait 20 minutes for a table.  Large portions...good food as usual.  Servers were timely and refilled water quite a number of times.  Relatively good experience!
Tanya W.,"Novato, CA",14,138,104,3.0,4/24/2006,"It's freaky how crowded this place gets sometimes. I call it the rich people's McDonalds since they're definitely kid friendly but they ain't cheap. Lot's of large-portion options but I might argue that they should stick to the American basics because their foray into international foods is not exactly spectacular.  The atmosphere is something like a decorated indoor football field with very high ceilings and nice, pretty teenage girl waitstaff. Good for families, picky eaters or when you're not sure what you want but otherwise if you are out just for a great meal....try somewhere else."
Mike I.,"Santa Rosa, CA",15,311,,2.0,11/9/2009,"Mediocrity on a grand scale. Came for an early Sunday lunch with our two kids (two and 3 months). They are well set up for kids. The restaurant is clean and bright. Staffed by clean cut high schoolers. The waiter showed up with a smile and a plate of bread and banana slices for our son right away.  The food, however, was uninspired and overpriced (not atypical for chain restaurants like these, in my opinion). $38 dollars for a child's pizza, two burgers (neither as good as In and Out and 4 times as expensive) and a cup of milk. If we didn't already have the gift certificate and weren't already at the Pottery Barn, I would much rather eat elsewhere."
Jeannie P.,"Moorestown, NJ",12,13,3,4.0,1/26/2012,Great service! Excellent. Kid grilled cheese was a winner for my 9 year old (10 ). The other meals were fabulous as well.
Allan B.,"San Francisco, CA",9,137,3,4.0,3/22/2015,"what any complaints?  food is good.  service is great.  everything is consistent.  when you go to The Cheescake Factory, you know what you get, just like any other chain."
Jasmine C.,"Penngrove, CA",3,19,2,3.0,3/20/2014,"The food is alright. It's not absolutely delicious but it's not terrible. The silverware was just sitting on the table, without any napkins. They could at least put them on the plates or on the towels but not just on the table. 1) it doesn't look nice 2) the tables are dirty.( I honestly don't care but other people freak) The cheesecake however is delicious."
Sammy L.,"Gresham, OR",0,12,,5.0,7/16/2012,"Awesome cheesecake, great burgers, and great tacos. Portions are large, service was good, and restaurant was clean. I would for sure go back."
Adryenn A.,"Reno, NV",1886,193,33,5.0,10/1/2009,"Yeah for the new kids menu! :) Loved our server and the new policy, ""bring out something for the kids to eat asap"" to reduce meltdowns and give parents the support they need to have a great meal! I love the new small plates menu, and will order 3 of those as a meal.  I really think the service and menu have improved alot in the last few months. Not sure if there's a new manager on site, or a new dedication to the customer experience, but I'm happy. I go there both with Jack and with friends, and it's been super the last 10 times.  The new review and star upgrade is for the ""about time"" kids menu, which offers a little bit of everything, including a wheat and dairy free option. :)  Smart!"
Kevin R.,"Mill Valley, CA",67,13,9,5.0,3/16/2012,"I'm not a chain restaurant kinda guy, but service/quality/quantity/atmosphere/price really matter to me when spending my hard earned bucks. I get off work at my restaurant where I'm surrounded by free food all day and go here so I can eat an awesome dinner a couple times a month. Consistently awesome food. I don't know how they do it!"
Ryan A.,"San Pablo, CA",173,22,14,3.0,5/5/2012,"Everything was great, we got seated pretty fast, and we sat in the bar area. We like to watch ESPN and Sportscenter and just chill...but the only thing i think was odd at this one was that in their bar area, instead of sports they had old lady yoga, old ladies working out, ON BOTH TVs. It was just weird...ive never been to a bar area in an restaurant and there NOT BE ANY SPORTS. so we asked if someone could possibly change it, and nobody seemed to come back to us with any answers. they made it seem like it was SOO difficult to do that. But why have that on TV anyway???? smh...i dont know bout everyone else, but i dont wanna watch old ladies doing anything on tv while i'm in a bar (area). other than that, the food was great!"
Jim H.,"Castro Valley, CA",165,121,10,4.0,4/28/2010,"I used to work around here and thus came here a lot for work dinners with co-workers.  Its also pretty close to Muir woods. This cheesecake factory had almost no wait, as oppose to its sister stores in SF and SJ.  I loved the Cajun rib-eye steak here, being decent size and juicy.  The cheesecake however is cremey and slightly too soft.  Which is different as the other reviewer's experience, maybe I just happened to get a mistake, or maybe I am just not a cheesecake connoisseur.   I do love the fact that it has a huge parking lot.  Its a good place to go after hiking at Muir woods."
Johnson N.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,377,258,3.0,11/23/2009,"We had a company lunch here yesterday with a rather large take-out order (20 strong!).  The lady seemed very nice and was patient throughout the long phone interaction.  I had doubts on whether or not she got the entire order correctly, so I asked her to repeat the order. She went through the confirmation a littttttle too quickly, so I trusted that she got everything down. When I arrived to actually pick up this massive order, I had a spreadsheet with a list of all the entree / dessert items to compare against their receipt.  The guy who came out at Curbside said that he double and triple checked the order, and that I had nothing to worry about.   Just as a precaution, I checked my list with their receipt, and everything seemed to have matched up.  Later at work, as I was sorting everything out and matching entrees / desserts to each person, I found that they missed a Factory Mud Pie and mixed up an entree.  ""No peas, yes chicken."" They gave us ""extra peas, no chicken.""  Oh well.  My friend was a good sport about it, so that was fine. Besides that, the food was good, desserts were good, and given the size of the order, I was impressed with their service.  Perhaps I have to try their food while dining in one of these days."
Michele M.,"San Rafael, CA",100,155,30,3.0,9/1/2009,"If you go on a Sunday afternoon and sit outside, they let you tie your doggie just outside the fence so you can keep an eye on him/her.  Sure it isn't the best food in the world, but it does the trick!  Don't come here if you don't like kids.  The place is like Neverland on free ride Friday on weekday evenings.   I like that it is attached to the Mall, duh. Oh and I like that dark mystery bread they serve up hot."
Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",32,92,14,4.0,2/18/2010,"I like coming to this cheesecake factory is because the wait is not as long as the one in San Francisco. Also the service and restaurant lighting is awesome ! I love sitting next to windows, and when i ask to be seated next to one, i will always get one which is awesome. Refills come before our drinks are even finished, without being asked. I think im just lucky, since people are putting soso reviews on this place. But when i went there everything was the way i wanted to be.  Food is great, like always. Bread, calamari, and etc. Very delicious. Oh just a warning, Lunch and dinner servings have a big difference in them becareful when you decide."
Nikki S.,"Sebastopol, CA",84,98,1,5.0,6/5/2011,Oh my gosh i cannot explain how much i love this place.  The food is great but the cheesecakes are to die for! Its a perfect birthday treat! Anyway i do wish they'd come up to Sonoma county!
John C.,"Oakland, CA",6,42,2,2.0,6/15/2009,"The cheesecake factory is nothing more than an expensive Applebee's.  I dont get what the big deal is about this place.  First off its always so crowded and the inside is dark and tacky.  Second, the food is not good.  I know alot of people that go here cause you get large portions and heaping salads, but most often that just means I have to eat alot of crappy stuff because I dont want to waste food (and I try to never send food back).   I had a chinese chicken salad and serious it tasted like window cleaner.  I told the waiter as we were leaving and he got all defensive (since I dared insult the cheesecake factory) saying he had it for lunch and it was fine.  Lastly, the place is really overpriced.  Just cause you add some toasted pine nuts and cilantro to a dish does not justify making it 19.50 rather than 7.50.  For what you pay, there are really a number of other significantly better resturaunts in marin.   Oh and the weight management menu.  What a crock of shit!  I love it when restaurants do this.  Take a jog or walk if you want to lose weight, because food from cheesecake factory is not going to make you a size five dear."
