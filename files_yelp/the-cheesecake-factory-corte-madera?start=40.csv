Katie C.,"Napa, CA",90,73,33,1.0,5/29/2017,"Wow is all I can say. I like the cheesecake factory but this experience or this location (I can't decide which one it is) was just a disaster. My first water glass had lipstick on the rim. Not too big of a deal if they were nice about it. But the second glass had something floating in it. I think it was a pinto bean....at that point I was a little grossed out. The manager came out and apologized for the dirty glasses. Then, the third water glass has something on the outside of the glass. Wow. Three times? I was scared to eat the food at that point. When is the last time the health department came here? With the dirty glasses and the dirty silverware Mom got we were all grossed out to eat the food. I like the cheesecake factory but not this location."
Marcus E.,"Novato, CA",1,1,,1.0,12/24/2017,"This place is a place I honestly hate with a burning passion, today I went with a big group and we had 4 people who had their food sent back, my fries were stale. I've never had a good experience with this place. I don't think I will ever eat there again."
Roman L.,"San Bruno, CA",41,37,43,3.0,11/3/2017,"Honestly, I have mixed feelings about The Cheesecake Factory. Never consistent and all locations are different, some are better than others but still feel like there should be some consistency in food and service. It's a hit or miss. Once in a while it's fine to eat."
Alix J.,"San Francisco, CA",107,183,30,2.0,7/16/2017,"I came here today with my best friend and my mom, the service was lacking! Normally the service is more attentive, we sat outside on the patio and it was not that crowded.  We had to ask for a bread basket three times and ask for silverware.  My mom's food wasn't right and to make up for the mistake the manager on duty said they would offer a small house salad instead of a salad of her choice.  We weren't offered a refill on the lemonades we ordered or waters. I wasn't offered another strawberry margarita.  The food was good and the cheesecakes were good.  It was my best friend's birthday and they sang happy birthday to her when they brought out her cheesecake she ordered."
Kayla H.,"Shingle Springs, CA",10,36,6,1.0,7/3/2017,"We came here Saturday ,(7/1) to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary with some friends. The waiter was so slow and didn't check on us at all. We were there at 8:30 PM so it wasn't too busy. We all ordered our food and waited....and waited...and waited. Finally after 35-40 minutes it came out. After we finished dinner, the waiter brought over plates and announced these are for the cake. My husband had a special cake dropped off before dinner and it was supposed to be a surprise. He ruined the surprise and my husband wasn't very happy. They were specifically given instructions that it was a surprise. Anyways, we paid and left. Fast forward to Sunday, (7/2) ...my son vomited all day and night. I took him to the emergency room and they hooked him up to IV fluids and anti-nausea meds. He had tests done and it came back he has enteritis. The doctor said it's usually caused by food. I don't doubt it that it was from The Cheesecake Factory.  We spent a lot of money the other night and we were extremely disappointed. I love The Cheesecake Factory usually, but I'll be avoiding it probably indefinitely."
Heather D.,"Kentfield, CA",2,2,,5.0,11/4/2017,"Honestly Best Service I've received in my life. I went to dinner with my partner and we had Scott S as our server. he was AMAZING !! Outstanding service, he was so sweet. Our food took awhile to come out due to the 30 people table that was behind us, but he was so attentive plus he was pretty busy. The food was delicious so was the blood orange margarita that my partner got. If anyone wants to get a delicious pasta and wants great service come here and ask for him ! Great way to sum up your dinner"
Tori P.,"Sunset, Redding, CA",286,2,,2.0,6/28/2017,"Worst bar service ever.  Watched our waitress pull a wine glass for my order of a pricey glass of chard. Bartender made 4 milkshakes, chatted with a person at bar and did dishes. 15 minutes for the glass. My dinner was done........ The pour was ounces less then the older better dressed couple next to me. Might just be done with this place"
T F.,"Vallejo, CA",3,126,326,3.0,6/24/2017,"I go to Cheesecake Factory mainly for their happy hour during the week but on this one occasion we went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  Our server was HORRIBLE...she had no customer service skills and just wore a dead expression on her face the whole time we were there.  She'd go missing for long periods of time.  But that wasn't the only problem...we ordered a pina colada which tasted disgusting, almost like they used old, stale juices.  I ordered chicken parmesan ""pizza style"" which looked amazing on the plate but was tasteless.  I will just stick with happy hour."
Sonia A.,"San Francisco, CA",237,255,,1.0,11/15/2016,"Came here on saturday, had to wait 30 minutes at 2:30pm in the afternoon for a table outside. Not even lunch hours.  We got drinks while we waited. Overpriced and not that great.  When we got seated it took forever for our waitress and come take our order. Once we ordered  it took forever to get our food. Our server was a grouch, and never checked on us if we doing alright or wanted anything else.  The food itself was crappy, got the salmon rolls where the salmon tasted stale, fried mac & cheese bits were $12 for only four balls and some load mashed potatoes which okay, but not worth $7.  I had to hunt down the waitress to get our bill, because she never came back. I finally got the bill from the hostess, and took care of it at the count. If it wasn't for my friend who suggested to quick eat here during our shopping trip, I would have gone across the way at the Nordstrom Cafe or one of the other nearby eateries.  This place is not worth your time and money."
Eric W.,"Castile, NY",1,79,72,4.0,5/29/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is decent, but the service was better in the past (as with most chains). Open seating in the bar is nice, and the server was good. Seemed understaffed however, our server had many tables. The food is good. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp ($20) always good, as is the Buffalo chicken sandwich ($14) Portions have definitely decreased though, but you still get enough food.  The chicken picatta or picata? tasted like pure melted butter. The pasta was buttered too much as well. I was very disappointed with this entree."
Kevin L.,"San Francisco, CA",522,773,203,5.0,10/24/2016,"It is not always about the food.  Yes the dynamite shrimp tempura was a bit sad and curled up resembling calamari with a bland batter and no crunch, isn't tempura shrimp suppose to be straight?  And their chicken potstickers were burnt on the bottom and a complete mess with the ponzu soy puddle underneath.  I heard the corporate chef is Japanese so I was expecting more from their Asian offerings.  First time to cheesecake factory BTW.   Enough of the Asian dishes.  Why 5 stars?  I didn't have high expectations for an overall great meal, but did expect to have a good time, which we did.  Kevin our server was always around during a super busy dinner service.  Our drinks were never empty, albeit the glasses were huge, lol.  The drinks are quite strong, ultimate margaritas, yes very ultimate, typhoon punch, so easy to drink, watch out.  Cheesecakes were great, my favorite was the lemon meringue.  Steak Diane cooked perfectly rare at $20, can't complain and lots of food, probably about 1 pound or so of potatoes, lol.  A pasta dish can feed 6 kids or 3 large adults, especially smaller oriental adults. The one hour wait was worth it for drinks and cheesecakes.  The overall grandma birthday experience was great.   Also the decor is lovely with large comfortable seating."
Brett Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,39,1,1.0,7/24/2017,"Abysmal service is an appropriate compliment to a highly mediocre dinner. Waited 1h30 for a table (on Sunday night), 45m for a martini, 45m to tell us they ran out of what we had ordered 6:30pm = 11pm until we left. Manager couldn't even comp one drink to compensate for the multiple snafus! Should have jumped this ship far earlier for more pleasant waters.  Hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a decade. No interest in giving it another chance. Go elsewhere. Anywhere."
Seth R.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",291,7,8,2.0,9/1/2017,"The service gets worse every time.  If you can't manage to bring me some water and bread within 10 minutes, get out of the restaurant Buissiness. I notified the manager and that it took more than 10 minutes to get our drink order taken, then an additional 10 minutes to bring it to the table. I would expect he would offer a cheesecake or something. But no. I eat hear at least 1 time a week. Nope. Not anymore."
Giovanni A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",146,108,183,2.0,2/23/2016,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to their locations from Chicago to Hawaii to San Francisco & the original in Beverly Hills. The decor is always beautiful, there's always a pleasant vibe in the establishment. Our waitress was very friendly, she attended to our every need.  I ordered their spinach dip for starters. It was mediocre, nothing to necessarily write home about. The dip was barely lukewarm, it could've been heated longer. The pita chips were ok, not much excitement there. It's a spinach dip so what could go wrong? Someone else in my party ordered a steak, it was lukewarm also. Which was surprising. I ordered their shrimp fettuccini. It was bland.  The fettuccini sauce tasted like it came from a glass jar. Something tasted store made to me, not freshly prepared. The noodles were OK, like I said earlier nothing to write home about. I was severely disappointed. My pasta was bland, the sauce needed a serious intervention for flavoring, & the steak was mediocre. The entire meal was a lukewarm mess. I love the Cheesecake Factory but I left severely disappointed & $100 for a meal that could've been reheated. I was so disappointed I broke my tradition & didn't even get a cheesecake."
Leetal M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,18,2,1.0,12/5/2017,Not sure what's worse: the food or the service. Pretty sure my waiter and the host were high on something...
Kevin C.,"Missoula, MT",0,17,1,1.0,10/15/2017,"Ordered online and came in to pick it up they didn't get it done because they missed it and they where "" busy as a motherfuker"" I guess I'm not used to being sworn that when I go to pick up my food. To top it all off his two co workers just laughed and said that that was"
Emi W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/26/2017,"This is the worst experience I have with Cheesecake Factory in Marin county San Francisco. We came on a Saturday at around 3pm. We have been waiting for an hour for our food even it is probably the down time of the restaurant.  We order buffalo chicken wings which came out like coal, all black. So we told the waiter we would like to have them remake it, then the so called manager came to our table without even introducing himself, he approached us like 'ugh chicken wings? I just want to let you know even we make it again, it will probably look the same' ugh , no! We had it in different location and they look perfectly fine. I just can't understand how they made the chicken wings like coal? That manager John did not even apologize? So disappointed!! Worst experience ever!"
Bethany J.,"Novato, CA",20,53,10,2.0,2/18/2017,My friend and I ordered some food from here a few days ago. I was so disappointed in the pasta we received. The shrimp butter pasta we ordered was completely undercooked and stuck together. Absolutely horrible if you ask me. I would either avoid or stay away from ordering pasta. But if they undercook their pasta what else will they undercook? Just saying. View my photo for reference. 2 stars because the lady up front was extremely nice.
Zoe E.,"El Cerrito, CA",2,9,40,2.0,4/16/2017,"Crossed the bridge just to get some cheesecake. After a little browsing in a few stores, ordered the banana cream cheesecake to-go without whip cream. They put on whip cream and then corrected their mistake by scraping it off. Unfortunately for me, once I arrived at home I saw they scraped off the Bavarian cream and not the large mountain of whip cream on the cheesecake. Sure they took care of the other mountain of whip cream on the bottom of the container, but that wouldn't have affected the cheesecake as much. In short, if you don't want any whip cream make sure you check out your cheesecake before you cross the bridge and settle in at home."
Aaron N.,"Petaluma, CA",85,22,16,3.0,3/12/2017,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants and this location was on par with the rest. The service was okay and the food was good but nothing to brag about.  We came here at about 3:30 pm on a Sunday and still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which I guess is on pat for cheesecake standards. The herb crusted salmon and steak medallions was surprisingly good! For desert we ordered the lemon raspberry cheesecake, which had a lot of flavor but in my opinion was lacking cheesecake."
