Tanya P.,"Lafayette, CA",340,857,82,4.0,12/20/2008,"The food has become dramatically more consistent in quality and haven't had a negative experience yet (any negative situations have literally been from not so polite customers). Getting to know what we like and not like here. Salads and apps are the standout. Desserts are yummy but like a ton of bricks in the tummy -- so skip that unless you want to nap Be prepared for a decent wait to be seated during prime dining windows as it is the primary food spot for this more upper tier shopping village. If it's busy, jump straight to the bar lounge area to snag a table quickly."
Cindy B.,"Kentfield, CA",75,69,4,3.0,5/26/2011,Pricey for average chain food.  Service is hit or miss.  Either fantastic or dude - I would have rather served myself.  Or had my worst enemy serve me.  Anyone but you.  I would go if other people wanted to go - but it's not a place I'm dying to go to again.  The host staff have been snobby every time - but that's probably because they have to deal with snobby pushy people.
Sydel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,145,11,1.0,8/10/2009,"Wow, it took  f o r e v e r  for our lunch to come out, it wasn't busy and we waited for 4 drinks worth of time... the food was okay, but anything tastes great when you are about to chew on your own tongue for nourishment. eh, i would only go for a last resort if i were dying of thirst."
Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",446,1654,757,3.0,12/28/2010,I am ashamed of my boneless buffalo chicken wing desires.
Carolina H.,"San Rafael, CA",70,98,99,3.0,2/10/2009,"I came in a few weeks ago with my lover while on a shopping excursion. I am a huge fan of the Chessecake factory but this location was very disappointing. We walked in, grabbed a number, and waited at the bar for a table. We then were seated in a booth and the waitress took our order and disappeared. We waited and waited still no waitress (waited at least 15 minutes) other parties were being served who came in after us and before us still no waitress. I through my hands up and  I finally walked back over to the bar area and ordered my drinks and walked back over to my seat. Out of nowhere she appears with a frown on her face... Asking if we needed anything else as she brought out our plates and if we still wanted the drinks that we had ordered from the begining? I told her no that we were fine and off she went upset mumbling under her breath.  I wasn't phased at all, you can miss me with all that! We both had the Steak Diane and I give that dish five stars hands down, it was good. A large portion of red mashed potatoes and a steak well seasoned and cook to perfection. I can't wait to have it again but I think I will stick to the San Francisco location... I can always count on them."
Raider J.,"Marin County, CA",378,647,,5.0,2/7/2009,I am a huge fan of this chain restaurant.   The one in Marin is consistent with all the other ones that you would find anywhere else in the US. Two things that stand out about this one is the wait time is better than the one in SF and the patio dining is super cool and enjoyable on a Summer evening.
LucyElyse F.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,33,,4.0,3/29/2010,"Have been to the Corte Madera CCF many times, too many for me to count. The service has always been good. No complaints. I appreciate their smiling staff. Their food took a bit of a dip in cooking technique in 2008, but they seem to have bounced back since then.  I appreciate their decor and ambiance. It reminds me of the old HUGE movie palaces back East where they have Egyptian styled lobbies. Chandeliers, pillars, mirrors, etc. these old movie houses have been turned into restaurants back home on the East coast, so I understand the decor that Cheesecake is going for. The decor is over the top and that suits us just fine. The whole vibe goes along with the Village Mall experience of shopping energy and big multiple visuals.  Love the smiley guy host at the front door with the long blonde hair. When he's not there, our dining experience is not complete. Love the Ahi Carpaccio, Roasted Lemon Chicken, Meatloaf, Pork Chops, with Mashed Potatoes, Carrots, Pecan Crusted Catfish, Tiramisu and Lemoncello Cake. We always split our entree and dessert between 2 people. Works out great. No overeating. No overspending, no leftovers. The wait staff has always been helpful about us splitting our entrees."
Chandra V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",260,108,45,4.0,9/26/2012,"Yes, I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Yes, it is a chain. Yes, the menu is annoyingly large. Yes, the drinks are too sugary. Yes, a lot of the food is probably pre-packaged/frozen. But thankfully I've never lived within an hour of Cheesecake Factory so going is a rare treat for me! It's not the type of place that I would wait to be seated at. If I'm going to wait, I'm going to seek out the best of the best, but I look forward to going here once every few months for the atmosphere, good service, and yummy cocktails,. I went with my bf yesterday before the Giants game and sat in the self-seating cocktail area at one of the hightops. Service was really friendly, charming and funny. I ordered the Blueberry Mojito which was delicious, although I'd order it with an added shot next time. Next I tried the Asian Pear Martini! This was a stronger drink, but had a somewhat syrupy texture I didn't love. It was also quite sweet. My bf had a spiked banana milkshake, yum! Because I like drinking there and I already know that the drinks have half a day's worth calories in them, I usually order off the skinnylicious (stupid name!) menu, and so far there's nothing on it that I wouldn't recommend. The bleu cheese and pear flatbread was chewy and flavorful, but I recommend eating it while it's hot! It was super soggy for breakfast this morning. I also tried the fried mac and cheese balls (no, not on the skinnylicious menu)! Omg, I could barely finish one. Sooo rich, but very yummy! The beet salad was very good too. I don't like the bread there, it usually tastes stale and too crusty to me, but I suppose that's for the better! As usual, there was no room for cheesecake! I'm going to have to dedicate a visit to purely dessert sometime."
Jen D.,"Berlin, Germany",268,1481,274,2.0,8/5/2008,"I don't want to even admit that I ate here, but I did. With a lack of knowledge of the area and extreme hunger that kept growing, I gave in and ate here. It was a nice day so I asked for an outside table. I was seated immediately.  My server, who looked a lot like Adrian Grenier (drooooooooool~), greeted me quickly and took my order. New Zealand sauvignon blanc please. And he asked for my ID! yay!!  For lunch I went with the small green salad with bacon vinaigrette. The salad was whatever. And if the salad dressing was in fact bacon vinaigrette, I couldn't tell. Didn't taste any bacon. Any oil. Any vinegar. I just tasted freshly washed salad mix. Hmmm...  For the main entree, I went for the LUNCH PORTION romano chicken. I emphasize LUNCH PORTION because when a menu says ""lunch portion"" you would think it would be a small portion right? Well, I sure think that way. So it comes out and it's HUGE. 1 very large flattened chicken breast and what looked to be almost an entire box of spaghetti with sauce. Come on people!! You don't need THAT MUCH FOOD for lunch!!!!  I don't like to complain, but hear me out for a second. I don't know where the portions got so out of hand. Americans want more and more and bigger and bigger. More and bigger aren't always better and better. I was disgusted at the size of this meal. Sure, the price wasn't bad for the size. But it was still disgusting. Meals shouldn't be that big.  Ok sorry... I'll stop now.  Don't think I'll ever come back to The Cheesecake Factory if I can help it. The food isn't that good anyway and don't get me started again on the portions..."
Megan W.,"Marin County, CA",11,146,,2.0,12/13/2010,"Had a plain garden salad and even that felt unhealthy.  Nothing about this place screams fresh or healthy, or good for that matter.  Also, it's nto that hard to make a bellini, especially if you have a bastardized version on your menu - sparkling wine + peach juice = bellini.  How freaking hard is that.   I will never come back here."
Courtney S.,"San Anselmo, CA",203,275,50,3.0,7/20/2010,"This review is slightly overdue, so forgive me if this seems dated... Honestly, there was really nothing wrong when I came here, come to think of it. My boyfriend and I wanted a late night dessert-snack, and yes, we smoked something that made us have such a craving *ahem*, so we ventured across the freeway from his house to get cheesecake. The inside of the establishment is very clean and has a good atmosphere - okay, check. There's an overwhelming menu selection to satisfy every craving and fancy to address the needs of stoners and pregnant women - check. Then there's the REALLY SUPER BUBBLY HAPPY SERVER WHO SOUNDS LIKE SHE SUCKED IN A HELIUM BALLOON - che... wait, what? I'm all about good service and friendly servers. I'm sure it was the end of her shift and she was working hard for the tip. But, I really felt like I was being talked to by a chipmunk on speed. I felt like she kept coming every 3 minutes to check up on us too... CHILL, LADY. We were just trying to relax, enjoy our cake slices, and have a conversation... which was extremely hard with the server we had.  I don't like writing reviews that criticize the staff, because I've been in that position and can relate, but I was put off enough by it that my boyfriend and I still joke about it a whole six months later."
Lorna T.,"San Anselmo, CA",1,29,,2.0,1/4/2012,"I ordered the Chicken Franchesse for $14.95.  It was about 7 rock shrimp, a few peas and 3 tiny slivers of canned artichoke in a garlic sauce that tasted as if they forgot the garlic with a mountain of plain white rice (substituted for pasta due to gluten intolerance) with no sauce on the rice.  This would have cost me under $5 to make at home and was nothing special.  Had there been more shrimp and vegetables with garlic in the sauce and some sauce on top of the rice I would have given 4 stars.  I had to order a meager serving of spinach for $5 to really feel like I had some vegetables with my dinner.   My friend's dish was the Chicken Madeira for $17.95 and it also lacked vegetables with only 3 scrawny spears of asparagus with an emphasis on the mashed potatoes but the chicken and sauce were good.  My friend, out of desperation for more vegetables, reached for my spinach and caused me even more bewilderment. The service was very good. The one thing that is so good for us is sorely lacking at this restaurant :  healthy and abundant vegetables with the dinners."
Desi D.,"Petaluma, CA",7,20,,4.0,2/28/2010,"Great location, big parking and great service.  Two words:  Hibachi Steak.  Of course if you still have room afterwards, you can never go wrong with the cheese cakes.   Definitely a go to place."
Marsha G.,"Petaluma, CA",0,16,,2.0,3/24/2013,"Yesterday I had lunch with my sister and a friend here.  The service was very good, but other than that I was not impressed. . My meal (fish and chips) was just okay-nothing special and fish a little soggy  We all wanted to wanted a glass of wine so ordered a bottle of White Zinfandel. We were brought a bottle of Beringers.  Having purchased this at the grocery store for $3.99 a bottle, I figured with the restaurant mark up we were probably going to get nailed about $15 for it.  When the bill came, my sister paid it and after we left she told me it was $26.00.  I was shocked. I understand that restaurants are in the business to make money but marking something about 6.5 times is a bit much.  It will be a long time before I go there again and certainly will never order a bottle of wine."
Scott S.,"San Rafael, CA",43,250,367,3.0,6/18/2011,"Once you get past the noise and almost guaranteed wait the food is not bad. There is a huge selection so almost anybody can find something  they will like. If you can agree on a main course with someone then share. If not you are left with a mound of leftovers. You'll notice practically everyone leaving with a doggy bag. If for some reason you cannot share then choose something that will be good the next day. For example the meatloaf, chicken or fish. Do not get a salad or anything fried. Salads don't keep once they are dressed and fried foods go soggy. Last night I the chicken Diana (I think that was it). Two generous pieces of boneless chicken, lightly breaded and sauteed with a cream sauce. It came with about a pound of mashed potatoes, no joke, and 2 cups of steamed broccoli. Enough for two normal adults even without an appetizer. I had a glass of Mark West Pinot. My son had a chicken quesadilla (he ate half) and my daughter had the child's corn dogs. We ordered two slices of cheesecake for dessert and as of this morning half of it is sitting in the fridge. A slice of cheesecake here is enough for 3 people (who aren't disgusting gluttons). When you share the prices become quite reasonable. Just don't let your eyes get ahead of your stomach."
Matt R.,"San Rafael, CA",3,172,,2.0,11/7/2011,"We ate here mid-shift on Sunday afternoon October 30. I mention mid-shift because it appeared the kitchen was indifferent and did not care if the items cooked matched what had been ordered. The combination cream of chicken artichoke soup was excellent. I had bits of bell peppers, corn, and mushrooms  (it took a very long time to get to the table and we looked out and saw people outside who had arrived after us served before us). We ordered a grilled artichoke, which came out boiled, not grilled, and with a very bland sauce. We asked the manager (see below) when she asked about the hamburger, how the artichoke was supposed to be cooked, and she answered grilled meant it had grill marks. This artichoke had none. The manager said it was not cooked the way it was supposed to be. A Kobe (American) hamburger ordered medium rare came out burned well, and had to be sent back. Once it returned (now more rare than medium rare) it was very good. The chicken salad sandwich appeared to be how bland can you go? The sandwich, which claims to be on brioche toast, came out with toasted white bread . The chicken salad, stated to have almonds, did have some almonds -- about two slivers (sprinkled on by the chef before serving?  Tranced out?), and had no seasoning. I didn't think mayonnaise was a seasoning, but perhaps I am wrong. The chicken tasted as though it was not fresh. Service (referring to the servers not the kitchen staff) was excellent. The manager, when she heard the hamburger had to be sent back, apologized and comped the hamburger and the artichoke. Others have noted that the service persons do not always match who takes your order. Our experience was not different, but I think the servers  tried hard.  The food here, as others have noted, can vary. I will probably try this again some months later when I can forget what occurred."
Janie A.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,59,,4.0,2/23/2013,"I'm glad we have a Cheesecake Factory in Southern Marin. The menu is huge and varied.  Sometimes a group of us will order a whole bunch of appetizers and share.  But when it's just me and I want the full experience, I'll take their chicken salad sandwich or just chicken salad fixed any old way and I'm in heaven. This place is big and sometimes noisy and when you're in the mood, that can be very festive. Takeout from here is also a nice idea."
Hunter G.,"Davis, CA",21,192,7,2.0,4/1/2009,"Talk about overwhelming. Someone dumped a lot of money into this place. It was like eating at Disneyland. Even if the columns, cornices, and stained glass light fixtures aren't real, they give the Cheesecake factory a palatial feel. You are greeted by someone with a permanent smile who also says goodbye to you when you leave. I think our greeter was one of the kids from Hanson. You know, Mmm Bop. But the menu. Come on. It's spiral bound with about forty-twelve pages of food, pictures, and advertisements. Advertisements? Do I really need to be thinking about a diamond necklace while I eat? There were just too many choices. It took fifteen minutes just to look through the whole thing. The food wasn't bad but it all seemed so over-the-top, rich, and large. I looked around to see families of overweight kids and their overweight parents. It was just too much. I guess if mom and dad like this place and they are paying I can force myself to go. They DO have beer. But otherwise please don't ask me to come here."
Mrs F.,"San Francisco, CA",13,323,,4.0,7/6/2009,"It's around a 3.5 star place, but with the location (we like most of the small towns north of the GG Bridge) and service, we can round up. The food was nice (and the portions huge - not our portions, but all the burger and fries and meal-sized salads we saw around us).   I've only been to Cheesecake Factory once in my life before this, and that was in Seattle many moons ago.  I remember the pasta was cheesy and the cheesecake addicting.  So when my husband and I were here over the weekend shopping, instead of buying a sandwich at Boudin SF, I said let's try Cheesecake Factory, since he had only been to CF once his life also. I wanted pasta and dessert.  He wanted the Cubano sandwich.  We also got a menu listing all the calories of every dish they served.  It had everything on it, every appy, every lunch special, every drink.  We were in shock.  My husband was in so much shock I had to tell him to keep his voice down.  Even with his running and weight conditioning everyday, he could not justify the roughly 1600 calories (give or take a couple hundred cals) on one Cubano sandwich.  The pasta dishes I wanted were creamy sauces.  Even at the smaller lunch portion, they were around 1200 calories.  The tomato-based sauces were 1000 calories.   So what did we get?  He had an egg-white omelette, I had the simply grilled salmon with vegies.  Each was 900 cals or under.  It was just a piece of salmon, no sauce.  But it was a good size, and pretty flavorful even without any sauces.  It came with a nice side salad with vinaigrette dressing.   To start off they served really gooood bread!  I ate maybe 600 cals worth of bread just there alone. This was our first time dining out and were able to look at the calories of our meals.  I don't know if I like it or not!  It didn't make for an enjoyable lunch.  I guess after time, we will get used to it and learn to look past the calories.  If you substitute for lighter sides, the numbers go down.   I'm going to give a shout out to our server, Ashleigh.  She was fantastic.  She spoke so clearly, slowly, and gently.  She was so professional, too.  I think she was 21 or so, but her attitude was so mature and just - nice!  I really enjoyed hearing her speak. So much for cheesy pasta and creamy dessert!  Ha!"
Rebecca J.,"Mill Valley, CA",48,22,,1.0,8/17/2012,"In this day & age when almost every restaurant you visit, no matter how small, is gluten-sensitive (even pizza places!), I was extremely disappointed by my recent experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera.  Although the menu is ENORMOUS, there was no gluten free section and everything I asked the server about had some form of gluten--including things where there shouldn't even be any wheat at all!  Normally at the very least salads are a safe bet, but I was informed that ALL of Cheesecake Factory's salad dressings contain gluten.  As do the soups.  The server had no suggestions for me so I then asked about the nachos, but was informed that even the sour cream contains gluten!  What?  Gluten in sour cream?  It is certainly not in the sour cream that I buy at the grocery store...  At that point I lost my appetite altogether as I realized just how unhealthy the food there is in general.   Couldn't the Cheesecake Factory perhaps dedicate just 1 page of their huge menu to gluten free offerings (or even just provide a gluten free salad dressing??).  If other large chains (like CPK) and even small ""mom & pop"" restaurants are willing & able to make this effort for their customers, it is upsetting that a giant like The Cheesecake Factory is making no effort whatsoever.  I won't be back."
