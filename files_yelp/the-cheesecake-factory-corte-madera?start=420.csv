Darius A.,"San Bruno, CA",29,620,34,5.0,7/19/2011,How can people hate on this place? I completely forgot this place existed. Everything they have here is delicious. Service is usually great and the food is always spectacular. The appetizer nachos are amazing. I have actually never had a piece of cheesecake here so I cannot vouch for it. Every time I go here I am usually too full from the meal that desert sounds terrible.
Katie W.,"Sonoma, CA",258,498,75,3.0,7/11/2008,"I have a strong pact with one of my Dearest Brats never to ever go here. It's a long story, but seriously worth the boycott. Yesterday I was suckered into breaking said promise. I am still feeling badly about this, but sometimes life throw shit at you, ya know? Scene: Lunchtime, busy Cheesecakers We gots ta wait. It's cool, we take our leash that'll beep when the table's ready and go shopping.  We're beeped, we're on! Food: Let's talk about their overwhelming book of a menu. Is this like the Room of Requirement of Menus? Like, if you think of a food item, does it automatically appear on some page in this extensive list?  Despite their disputable magical abilities, the food always comes out and I feel a little like: Oh shit. Do I need to be able to feed 7 with this, or is it ok to wolf it all down like the Closet Pig that is Grace and get the f* out?  I got the Ahi Tuna Salad - not one of the huge-r plates, a nice/small size and very plain. Which actually suited me fine.   And that made me think about past meals here, they are over-the-top or just so-so. There's no middle-ground AND I break my pact.  If you're unlike I, and do not have an undying bond NOT to go here, go ahead - but don't say I didn't warn you. You will wait and sometimes wait some more for totally just ok food.  Are YOU ok with that?"
Aaron S.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,24,,1.0,8/24/2008,"The idea of the amount of food served here makes me sick.  After leaving here, one is woozy with the sickening stupor of rich lobster, five loaves of white bread and the ersatz taste of cough syrup.  Blech.    This defeats the purpose of eating out.  One eats out to enjoy his or her food, not to stuff themselves with it.    Furthermore, not that it is particularly dirty, I did have a hair in my caesar salad the last time I went there. Food:  C+ Service: C Atmosphere: D so dank and dim"
Patricia C.,"San Jose, CA",83,10,,2.0,9/27/2011,"So I called in my order since I work here at the mall... I ordered cripsy Taquitos.... Spicy chicken and cheese right up my alley... I made sure to ask.. It's only chicken and cheese inside the Taquitos right? He assured me yes only cheese and chicken.... So I pick it up and get back to my kiosk... Halfway into my good Taquitos there's corn all in there!! Way to much to take out.. Now I know what some of you are thinkin.. ""just eat it"".. Well I'm sorry but im 100% picky about my food and when I ask if thats all that's in there that's all that needs to be in there!!! I dont like surprises and I certainly dont like corn!!!!!!"
Lynnie P.,"Richmond, CA",109,347,25,4.0,7/18/2008,"The strawberry shortcake is wonderful! I got it without the ice cream.  They didn't have any more biscuits so they made mine fresh.  It was warm and complimented the fresh berries.  I like that they don't add sugar to the dessert.  Jeff tasted it and said it was missing the sweetness of ice cream.  He's a wise cracker.  Yes, both meanings. (Thanks to our server, Brian, for giving Jeff my rejected vanilla ice cream with some hot fudge!)"
Turtle R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",69,132,,4.0,3/14/2009,"I really don't understand the complaints - it's a national chain restaurant - what do you expect? It's not the cook getting up at the crack of dawn to go get the freshest local ingredients as is so common in so many independent Bay Area restaurants (another reason to love the Bay Area of course) On more than one occasion I've found the wait staff to be very on edge - they seem very worried about people complaining! A couple of times the waiter/waitress apologized for the portions being so large - before we had even ordered.  It's the Cheesecake Factory! That's what they're known for! And as I said both times, I know, so what? You get a to go bag. I love the lemon herb roasted chicken and the Ghirardelli chocolate cheesecake. Everything is a generous portion - including their drinks. Reasonably priced, good quality. Wait staff has always been attentive and friendly. This Cheesecake Factory doesn't have the ambiance of the San Francisco one overlooking Union Square but the wait time is much more reasonable. And the food quality seems on par with all of the other Cheesecake Factories I've eaten at all over the country."
Rhonda E.,"San Ramon, CA",51,9,,5.0,8/15/2013,"Family stopped in here after a full day at Stinson Beach.  We know the brand and depend on the reliability of the product.  What we weren't expecting was dynamic service.  Tanaya, our server, was helpful with selections (a huge plus with that ridiculous menu!) and easy going with the kids' choices.  Her support staff was around constantly, as they seem to easily all work together to keep everyone in the general area with topped-off glasses and the plates coming. It was evident to me that she and her team really seem to have this gig under control as I witnessed patrons at two other tables give them a hard time over what seemed like ""high maintenance hell"" (ex: ""I like my Arnold Palmer with just little bit more lemonade than iced tea, can you redo this?"" - are you kidding me?).  But this staff seemed to handle it all really nicely even if my eyes were rolling back into my head.  Good job Cheesecake Factory.  Give the girl a raise!"
Ryan G.,"San Francisco, CA",10,154,,3.0,12/11/2007,"Size MATTERS. Especially here in some obscene manner, anything you order will come in large portions. Large enough that if two of you are not super hungry, can probably split one meal and still have ROOM for cheesecake.  Cheescake Factory is in the Village, in Corte Madera. One of only a few food options when shopping here, they did away with the mall-like food court, in order to enhance the quality of this PLACE. While you can expect a wait during most busy times: sunny shopping days, weekend nights and during the HOLIDAYS. Wait is not to bad, and they give you one of those remote, vibrating disc things that alerts you that your wait is over.  Really need to work on the range of these. Confined to sitting within a few yards of the front door. Tried to put it to the test by sitting near Nordstrom's, bad CHOICE. Moving along... Seating is plentiful, the booths can feel a little packed when there are 4 adults and expanding waist lines. If you are impatient on waiting, snag one of the table tops or bar space and order off the full menu. Once seated you are greeted with the most insanely packed menu. 8+ pages with colored ADVERTISEMENTS for plastic surgery (oddly enough!) to vacations. First few pages are alcohol. Make a decision and move onto the food.  My strategy here is to rule out whole categories of food, like say pasta or salad. And then try and choose. My safe pick was fish tacos. Nice to get a choice Albacore or Mahi Mahi. Along came my plate full of 3 fat tacos. Finished ONE and hit a wall.  All the burgers looked decent enough, and the Crispy Cajun Littles (chicken fingers!) was insane. Fried pieces everywhere, huge lump of mashed potatoes. Guess you can be good and substitute for some broccoli, smothered in BUTTER. A coronary awaits you here! If you were able to finish your meal. Cheesecake awaits you here. Place is good just for that, skip food and just eat cake next time. Choices are again, INSANE. Chocolate, peanut butter, snickers, banana, pumpkin, and more in all sorts of combinations. At least you will have LEFTOVERS"
stacy o.,"San Francisco, CA",7,48,4,1.0,3/30/2006,"My question is: how did this restaurant ever get approved to be built in Marin? Did someone think they were in Las Vegas? This place is insult to anyone who appreciates good food. And I don't mean snobby, good, expensive food. Just food that tastes good.  Everything about this place is grossly oversized. From the ginormous size of the restaurant and its horsey decor, to the plates of food that could feed a family of 20 (and we wonder why Americans are fat) to the 6 pound individual piece of cheesecake.  My ass is getting bigger just looking at this stuff. Save your money and go elsewhere. Unless you have a thing for bad chain restaurants with crappy, overpriced food served in a Disneyland atmosphere."
Michael O.,"Northern, CA",117,361,66,2.0,4/4/2006,"Lunch was basic, with a double decker hamburger (ordered well done, received medium, garnished with salad style chopped romaine which just slid out from the burger and onto the plate, no tomato), fries and an iced tea, times two.  Very huge portions.  I'm not sure why this place feels they should hammer their patrons at the register for mediocre food.   $30+ for two very basic meals.  I wasn't impressed; I'd rather get in my car and drive five minutes to the other side of the 101 for some food worth paying for, or get a pretzel dog at the other end of the mall!  Two stars for the fact that I did not become ill for eating their food, and the waitress was nice.  For shame, Village.  For shame."
And-back-there-on-the-drums E.,"San Francisco, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/7/2007,"I'm out of touch I guess. Couple of people I know asked me to lunch and said it would be here and I momentarily freaked. I don't normaly go to anything ending with factory or barn or warehouse, unless it's actually a real factory or barn or warehouse. However, my high school girlfriend Susan Yarm, who is no longer with us, taught me back then to ""Always Say Yes"", and I still try to.  So I said Yes. What a nightmare. A huge plastic menu made even huge-r by all the FULL PAGE ADVERTISEMENTS. In the menu. Full Page Ads. How innovative. They've already made money off me and I haven't yet ordered. OK, let's make this short. The fucking portions are obscene. They should merge with Wheelbarrow Factory and cart the shit out in wheelbarrows. Felt bad watching my waiter try to carry all of that slop all hunched over like that. It's good they supplied him with one of those back supports or the poor guy won't make it though high school.   I was 6'2"" and weighed 185 lbs when I went in, and I'm glad to say I still am. And that's because I left 90% of my food right there. What a fucking waste.  NOBODY needs this much food."
Shannon W.,"San Rafael, CA",3,227,,4.0,4/9/2011,"I love their salads for when I am on the run, especially their Asian Chicken salad.  Also, don't forget to grab a slice of cheesecake on the way out- sure, they are full of calories, but where else can you get an eight layer slice of chocolate cake?!?"
Jazzy H.,"Rodeo, CA",46,6,,4.0,8/7/2012,"It was my first time here and maybe I just expected more that's my reason for giving 4 stars, but the food was good and our server was awesome. Also, the skinny menu was a plus, plus."
Jason R.,"San Francisco, CA",428,625,34,3.0,12/19/2007,"If you want to see Persians acting like douches in Marin, go to the Cheesecake Factory. If I wanted to do that I'd go to a rug store, or LA, or Macy's sale. But I know more than you do, and I have no desire to see Persians in Marin any more than I have to. I once came here with some foreign visitors and they were shocked by how big everything was: the deserts, the entrees, the booths, the height of the ceilings. It's some sort of bs abundance thing that we Americans are hooked on.  We think they're living in squalor is quaint and they think we are cute, over-privileged morons. It works out great."
Mrs. M.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/30/2011,"I have never had a bad meal at this Cheescake Factory. I eat there often and have tried much of the menu and have enjoyed it all. They also make great cocktails and of course unreal desserts. It can get busy but I have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes. I also love that it is in the mall so I can grab lunch with a girlfriend, have a couple glasses of wine and hit the shops! It is very big and always bustling with activity which I like. Great for kids as the noise level is high. The patio on a warm day is heavenly.  My only complaint is that the portions are gigantic! Even the ""lunch sized"" salads are big enough to feed my whole family so I always walk out feeling like I overate because it is so delicious I can't stop!"
J W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,183,986,2.0,4/15/2013,"We did not have good service from our server.  I was so disappointed because my family and I were on a mini-vacation in Mill Valley.   He was kind of rude from the time we sat down.  When he brought our check to us, he just said softly, ""thank you""  to my husband and left the bill on the left side of the table next to my husband.  The Jambalaya does not taste good anymore.  It was too mushy and too saucy.  I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant since the year 2000 because of the pricey meals.  The jambalaya was so much better then."
Nana C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,18,,1.0,8/7/2011,"EVERYTIME!!!! I go here it is a bad experience! NEVER going again... I do not care whose birthday it is!!!! Anytime anyone is even thinking this location I steer them clear!! Better off traveling to downtown SF!!! They always messed up on drinks. Never get what we ordered and forget it if you want something from the bar!! You might get it by dessert! Once we actually ended having to have out food boxed up and for to go because we were there almost an hour!!! The food is in some cases downright gross!! This is pathetic especially for a ""chain""."
Trumom R.,"CA, CA",55,50,11,1.0,4/6/2007,"Back in my college days, my roommate would lure me to her house in the Valley for the weekend by promising we could hit Tommy's ( ), In 'n' Out, and The Cheesecake Factory- 3 places we didn't (as yet) have in NoCal (Hey, Tommy's, CAN YOU HEAR ME? YOU HAVE A FAN UP HERE!) But I digress (visions of chili cheese fries... mmmmmm...) The Cheesecake Factory was a treat back then, but after the last few times I've been there, it's become less of a treat and more of a place where I eat too much Chili's style food. You will not be disappointed if all you are expecting is an OK, somewhat fancy-schmancy sandwich. I suggest getting half a salad at lunchtime, or sharing one, and then getting the cheesecake (but don't get the banana- too fakey tasting.) Speaking of the cheesecake, how many of you have not thought about laying down under the whipped cream machine with your mouth wide open??? Mmmmm... whipped cream... But I digress (geez, I'm distracted tonight.) Let me just sum it up: - Drinkies, good (mojito too sweet, though) - Salads, good (but huge if you get full size) - Garlic Noodles (OK- but whaddup with the woody ends of the asparagus?) - Kid's Menu (none to speak of, and no crayons for coloring; this is a huge issue for those with kids; thus, THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR KIDS) - Service (sux) - Would I come back here? Maybe, if I were just out shopping with girlfriends, or my mom. I will never, ever bring my kids back here. - If I could suggest one thing to this restaurant... It would be to CREATE A KIDS MENU AND GET SOME CRAYONS AND SOME COLORING BOOKS (Next time I'm in this area with my kids, I'm heading across the freeway to California Pizza Kitchen where my kids are TREATED RIGHT! Ya hear, Cheesecake Factory?)"
Leon R.,"San Francisco, CA",80,167,37,1.0,9/17/2007,The quintessential ugly american dining experience. Obscenely large portions of fake food. Check. Generic chain atmosphere trying to be upscale.  Check. Advertisements in the menu.  Check. Moronic clientele who eat this crap up.  Check.    Review with checks. Check.      What a waste of space.
J F.,"Singapore, Singapore",91,291,,3.0,7/27/2008,"What is it about a long bike ride that makes me feel so entitled to a cheeseburger? I may never know, but yesterday when we ended up at the Cheesecake Factory, my burger craving did not go unfulfilled. This burger was so huge we all started speculating on how much it weighed. Needless to say half of it had to get packed up with my leftover fries to be devoured at a later time. I'm sure the giant bottomless $4 glass of lemonade I ordered added to my fullness too.  Since I have never tried the cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory I ordered a piece of the Original with the Strawberry glaze to take with me as well. I have to say that when I did finally try it, I kind of didn't like it so much. It tasted salty to me. I think maybe it was the sour cream layer that grossed me out.  Whatever it was, I didn't care for it and threw most of the cake out. Obviously, lots of people love the cheesecake so it must just be me. I had the same experience with that movie the Professional. Most people love that movie, but I hate that it, and imagine now that my personal hell might be where it plays on a loop while Marin mothers serve me Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from atop of their double-wide baby strollers. If you would like an awesome dessert - I will say that I put a good dent in my friend's strawberry shortcake at the Cheesecake Factory yesterday. It could have used a few more strawberries, but it was SO GOOD - and huge. Three of us couldn't finish it."
