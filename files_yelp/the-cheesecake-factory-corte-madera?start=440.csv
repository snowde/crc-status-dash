Clementine O.,"San Francisco, CA",3,39,48,4.0,3/11/2009,"My girlfriends and I thought we were both eating healthy. Nice salads. Wow, are we health conscious?? That salad is tasting a bit dry?!  Oh shit, really.....hey there is no salad dressing in our salads, none on the side :) oops they forgot! as we giggled about our dry salads.  We had the Pear and endive salad, and Chinese chicken salad with dressing. Salads are huge super size me size. One salad was enough to feed two of us. We all had leftovers!  The deserts were gi-normous!!!  Feeling like something sweet, but not too heavy and rich?  Lemoncello Cream Torte, yum yum yum, nice and light with zest."
Crystal V.,"San Rafael, CA",117,137,52,2.0,4/12/2010,"I'll be honest I used to love this place. Like really love it, I mean go there like 4 times a week love but times have changed. After my last visit I'm really thinking this company is all about raping you. I ordered their BBQ Chicken salad that is priced at $13.95, I don't eat chicken so I asked if I could sub Salmon, the server told me it would be a couple extra bucks. Sure that's fine but when the bill came my $13.95 salad turned into a $19.95 salad. WTF? $20 bucks for a over cooked, over dressed salad? No thanks!! I'll go waste 20 bucks on a good meal!"
Juju B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,30,26,3.0,7/17/2009,"This place is starting to bore me. I only came here again because my friend wanted to. Our waitress was bubbly and fake, but nice. I ordered green iced tea which I was satisfied with and drank two whole glasses of. My friend ordered the calamari and chicken quasedillas. The calamari was good, as well as the quasedillas. I got the orange chicken, lunch size, which is the smaller one but it was still HUGE. For my taste, it was WAY too orangy and sweet. It tasted like chicken in orange syrup or something. We were too full for desert so skipped it but I don't like cheesecake factory deserts anyway. Nor do I like cheesecake, which is pretty much baked creamcheese. Ick. The only positive thing about this place is the super long menu. They make everything!"
Rache C.,"San Francisco, CA",65,36,,3.0,2/8/2007,"Unlike its SF big brother, this Cheesecake Factory does not have tons of people waiting in line.  It is conveniently located in an outdoors mall, so hard-working shoppers such as myself can get food that is not Panda Express, Sbarro, or McDonalds.  Mind you it is not a great restaurant, but think of it as mall food and suddenly it's not so bad. The menu kind of suffers from an identity issue.  It doesn't know if it is fusion-Asian, Italian, American, or just a dessert joint.  I do give it an extra star for having low-carb cheesecake... not that it's necessarily healthful or tasty, but I generally appreciate establishments that try to accomodate different dietary needs."
Mel A.,"San Francisco, CA",40,108,152,4.0,11/10/2010,"2 words...Happy Hour! Lots of apps for $5. We got the shrimp spring rolls, calamari, fire roasted artichoke, chicken pot-stickers & fried chicken sliders....everything was yummy! Excellent service too by our waitress (Nichole) and everyone else who brought out our food. The peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake is REALLY good & I'm not even a cheesecake person!"
Elena N.,"San Francisco, CA",1406,2423,10560,4.0,8/4/2008,"I think this is the first Chessecake Factory location where I didn't have to wait for a table.  Of course, I got here after 8 pm on a Saturday, so that may have been why.  The service here was great.  I went with a friend and we were talking the whole entire time, so I felt kinda bad for the waiter since it took us forever to look at our menus.  But he was very attentive and sweet.  Let us go at our own pace.  I got the steak diane and other than being a little overcooked for my taste, it was very good.  My grey goose martini was again made very well.  Other than forgetting the olives, I have no complaints about this location."
Matt G.,"Healdsburg, CA",7,179,,3.0,2/1/2007,"Too many items on the menu, too much food on the plate, too many people making lots of noise, but the food was good, the drinks although expensive were good, and we were able to take food home for lunch the next day!   Pretty good for a chain operation, surprising that they can put out that good a meal!"
Daniel P.,"New York, NY",7,88,19,3.0,12/14/2009,The food wasn't bad and the conversation was good. I don't know if I ventured into other areas of the menu if I would feel the same way and I don't want to find out. I don't like the idea of eating at a factory.
Ann H.,"San Diego, CA",257,79,4,2.0,9/4/2009,"So this wednesday (9/2), the ex visited me for lunchbreak and we head over to the cheesecake factory.  There was no wait so it was great.  The food took a while to come out but I didn't mind since i was just munching on their bread and talking- it was very nice that the manager came out and personally apologized for the fact that our food was taking so long.  Food comes and its yummy (like always...i ""heart"" the fetticini with chicken n sundried tomatoes), so far everything is swell.   Well it's time for me to go back to work so I tell the server I need to hurry n get back to work, the lunch was 23 something so i give him 40 bucks...the change returns and there is one 5-dollar bill and six 1-dollar bills...hm ok so they put in a 5 dollar bill instead of a 10, understandable since they were now a little more busy.   However the next part is what made this a TWO-STAR experience.  I ask the server and he goes oh i'm sorry i tried to hurry, he takes out his WALLET and pulls out a FIVE.  I don't know about you but I find that very very shady...if i wasn't in a hurry i would have asked to speak with the manager.  I always tip well so there is NO NEED to tip yourself.  Always count your change if you are planning to eat here..."
Diana H.,"Berkeley, CA",14,93,,4.0,10/20/2007,"I'm sorry, but I like this place. The portions are famously huge, yes. A pasta dish will comfortably serve two people. I don't really think that's BAD...it's just something to be aware of. I hardly ever even make it to desert. It's a chain, which I don't like, and there are ads in the menu (eeeew) which adds to the overall tackiness already put in place by the bizarre decorum (pastel roman impressionist mother's day card trying to be romantic...?) But, well... The actual FOOD is quite good. Their meat is cooked right, and the flavors are usually well-rounded (if a twinge, eh, fatty).  They also have a very, very large menu, which I love. There's something here for everyone. I hate restaurants that offer 6 entrees on their menu. Not here, my friends. For this, It's a great place to go with a group.  I think the prices are very, very fair. You can get a sandwich that will last you through tonight and tomorrow's lunch for 10 dollars.  It's also one of the ONLY places in Marin county that's open past 10. Did you hear that?  at 11 o'clock on a Friday, it's this or Dennys. Don't put it out of your mind as a late night spot to get chow that won't give you acid reflux, constipation and nightmares. I think people need to ease up on this place. Also, a note on their meat: Their chicken is natural and free range. No hormones or antibiotics. Yea, ask your favorite diner if their chickens were treated better then most--and whether or not by eating that chicken sandwich you will be consuming the hormones, anitbiotics and preservatives that were added to the meat before and after it was killed. Their beef, I'm not so sure about. It' s all USDA grade A (some of it even Kobe)...which, I guess means happier, healthier cows, for a happier, healthier you, but all meat companies ever talk about is the marbling...not whether nasty hormones/checmicals were added. The Cheesecake factory should be supported for offering higher quality meat than most restaurants...including non-chains."
Lisa M.,"Larkspur, CA",2,200,9,4.0,2/4/2010,"I'm a happy hour/cheap food fan.  Guilty pleasure is heading off to CF before 6pm on weekdays and sitting at the bar, eating cheap food.  Good, plentiful, cheap food.  Enjoy the food with a nice glass of wine and I'm a happy camper.  Cheers!"
Michelle C.,"San Francisco, CA",10,26,1,4.0,11/27/2010,"All the Cheesecake Factory Restaurants are the same, even Grand Lux Cafe (the better higher sibling in LA) has a predictable menu and experience. Everything depends on how long the wait you have and the server. I went with my friend for a late night snack and ordered Thai Chicken Wraps (delicious and probably one of the healthier choices) and Spinach Cheese dip with chips (our sinful selection). Clean and good service."
Carie G.,"Sonoma, CA",12,78,,1.0,9/23/2010,DOWN HILL!!! This place used to be good. My first complaint about a place who is famous for its cheesecake charged us $6.50 for a sliver of cheesecake! The portions were rediculously huge and not very exciting. Our salad was majorly wilted and we felt rushed. This was a huge disappointment. They really need to get negative ratings for this website because some of these restaurants are really bad. BAD!!!!
Clu C.,"Novato, CA",56,49,33,5.0,9/16/2012,so impressed with this restaurant! i went for the first time last week and ate a mushroom burger and blueberry cheesecake. it was fantastic. our appetizers were at the table within 10 minutes of ordering them and the food was followed shortly afterwards. service=10. undoubtedly a fantastic place to dine. i'm baffled at their rating at 3 starts.
Ronald N.,"Hercules, CA",201,399,94,4.0,9/10/2010,Cheesecake Factory near a busy shopping center is not bad. When it find open it would be hard to get a seat. Recently its been dying down. I guess people were getting tired of eating there. I love the service that I got at the bar.
Mike M.,"Richmond, CA",16,93,4,3.0,6/17/2008,"In general, my experience at this cheesecake factory was okay.  The food was pretty much the same as any other cheesecake factory but it took forever to be seated.  The hostess originally said that it would be a 25 to 35 minute wait.  45 minutes later we were seated.  Not such a big deal except that there was nowhere to sit and the bar was full.  On top of that, the pagers apparently don't work outside.  We ended up getting seated in a booth below an air conditioner vent.  The entire time we were there we had a constant chilly breeze.  At some point they dimmed the lights way too low making our booth feel like a cave.   When it came to service I'm not sure if the waiter annoyed the hell out of me or impressed me.  We definitely got outstanding attention from him but I can't help but wonder if some of his sharp humor and witty comments were really just a lame way of trying to hit on my fiance.  He must of asked her ten times if she wanted to order cheesecake and even hunched down at our table and started bullshitting.  Although it was nothing too obvious, it started to get real annoying. The food was good but a little too salty.  The cake was amazing of course."
Bob G.,"San Rafael, CA",89,155,76,2.0,6/9/2009,I agree with some of the reviews about the service. The word that comes to mind is... LACKING. The food is average but the Cheesecake is killer. Try the less heavy Key Lime Cheesecake.
Valerie C.,"San Francisco, CA",213,137,43,2.0,5/16/2008,"As I sit here picking at the remnants of a Cheesecake Factory Chicken Madeira, I have to say that this is one of those few occasions where the food tastes better a day later. I mean, you know how food quality is supposed to be sub-par when served as leftovers? Well in my case, the mediocre food I had last night is still mediocre today. And since I anticipated a change (for the worse) in taste and instead was greeted by the same oversalted mashed potatoes and overdone cheese I had at my bff's graduation dinner last night, by default my expectations were exceeded. But enough with my attempt at being philosophical about the Cheesecake Factory; bottom line is: I DON'T SEE MYSELF EVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN. I didn't even want to waste my time yelping about a chain, but a'las the experience I had last night had to be one of the worst I've had for this restaurant chain (I've been ones in Palo Alto, San Francisco, Sacramento and Waikiki).  I come here out of comfort: I LOVE the calamari and the bread service is pretty good (although I usually skip the sourdough and go straight for the brown loaf), and if I didn't manage to stuff myself with the above PLUS an entre, I definitely go for a slice of cheesecake. Last night was no different.  Our party of eight was seated on the patio, which we surprisingly did not have to wait long for. (The weather was GORGEOUS!) However, it was obvious the service would be slow from that point forward as our server had to have had half the tables (something like 8-10 parties).  We started off with appetizers (calamari and the spinach dip) which took longer than it should have to come out. I KNOW both could have been served better, as the calamari came out as one solid battered mess and the spinach dip required you to crack through the heatlamp-dried top to reach what should have been the creamy dip. The bread came out sometime after that, and then the food, which I mentioned earlier. We decided for some cheesecake (after all, it's not made onsite anyway) so we weren't really disappointed with that. The best part of my experience had to be my company. Oh, and the beer."
jennifer w.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,36,2,2.0,8/16/2010,"It is really hard to find healthy food here.  I had the fish tacos which were way over-seasoned with spicy chiles, I could only eat a few bites.  The fish wasn't tender, it was kind of hard and overcooked.  The rest of the meal was forgettable except for the guacamole which was tasty.  My dining companion had three appetizers and I tasted the corn cakes which were quite good until I got a little piece of hot pepper (serrano)? in one bite and my nose started running like a faucet.  I am not usually sensitive to medium-spicy things, so I was really suprised that a place like Cheesecake factory would serve such hot dishes.  The other things were all deep fried and I didn't taste them."
Theresa G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,20,,3.0,8/12/2010,They put WAY too much sugar in everything! And they supersize EVERYTHING. I try to get a salad but they bring enough to feed a family of 4 and there is lots of sugar in the dressing. The waiters are nice and there isn't too long of a wait.
