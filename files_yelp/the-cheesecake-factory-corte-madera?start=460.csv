asia c.,"San Francisco, CA",56,111,,5.0,4/23/2010,"every year i come here with my family on my birthday, and i love it every time.  this year, our server was Kyle, who was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and fun. everyone had a great time.  we try to order something different every time we come, and i personally have never been disappointed. the staff here is always nice, and very accommodating if you have some kind of issue."
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, CA",224,423,7,2.0,8/19/2009,"This review has absolutely nothing to do with the food or the restaurant itself but all to do with the service.  The food (which is always amazing) was yet again more than satisfactory!  I love the selection and the enormous portions so I can eat it for the next three days.   Now lets talk about the service.  The hostesses were super sweet and got us a table right quick, which ive NEVER had occur at a cheesecake factory.  Maybe news has spread that the service is pretty terrible according to all these reviews.  We sat outside which is a favorite of mine.  The server didnt show up for more than 10 minutes, I thikn that is way too long to take a drink order.  Each dish that came out was served by someone new, and each person was more and more rude.  The first lady seemed really alarmed and offended that we asked for bread.  The second guy who served my chinese chicken salad was even worse.  I asked if he could remove all that excess stuff on top (what is that crap anyway) and he gave me a dirty look.  I apologize if I asked you to DO YOUR JOB.  But my god at least pretend to be fake.  I also apologize that you have to wait tables on a beautiful sunday, but that was your choice not mine.  The service was just way too slow, and the waitress had maybe 3 tables besides us.  And tons of help with the other jerks!   Also, why must the uniforms be white?  I hate seeing all the stains throughout the day of work."
William C.,"Tiburon, CA",37,636,203,2.0,7/28/2007,The service staffs were all very nice in general. The food portion was too much! one dish could usually feed  two persons. In addition the pasta had no taste whatsoever.
Kai T.,"Oakland, CA",31,291,14,1.0,3/30/2009,"Desserts and cocktails are decent. But otherwise if you want to go to a gawdy restaurant which has more advertisements then food on its menu which takes about an hour to go through b/c its so large and lighting so dark and love disgusting amounts of portions of food with absolutely forgetable flavor and taste then this if your joint. Honestly, food shouldnt last you 4 meals like that. Sacrificing flavor to get out elephant size portions is not my cup of tea."
Denise L.,"San Francisco, CA",122,442,,3.0,10/30/2006,"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat at the Corte Madera shopping center and nothing looked appealing to us. Don't know what happened to the food court, but it was MIA.  I'm not a huge fan of Cheesecake factory, but I haven't eaten here in a long time, so I decided to give it another try. It's a pretty decent place. Great selection of food that will please even the pickiest eaters. The portions here are HUGE, so be sure not to fill up on bread or appetizers. Appetizers are actually the size of an entree. With that said, I ordered the Thai fresh spring rolls with two types of dipping sauce. The rolls were made with fresh shitaake mushrooms, carrots, asparagus, bean sprouts and cilantro wrapped with rice paper. The 2 dipping sauces were peanut sauce and sesame sauce. Both good. I remember their having their chicken wraps before too and those were good too."
Vicky F.,"Novato, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/19/2010,I love this place! I go here often with friends and i always get the chicken marsala and mushrooms which are amazing! The complementary bread with butter is delicious too. The staff are all very friendly and i would definitely suggest going here to eat.
Denny R.,"Petaluma, CA",45,188,,4.0,1/4/2010,"my date and I initially were going to try out the new BJ's at Northgate, but the wait was over an hour so we decided on the Cheesecake Factory.  Mind you it was a Saturday night, so walked in and we were told about 25 min wait...wonderful!  Went to the bar and I had a Mojito and the cute boy I was with opted for some Vodka soda thing...anywho 25 min later our buzzer went off and we were seated.  Cute as a button waitress, and I had the bacon and prawn blt and my date had a huge salad...service was great, food was very good and all in all a great night...kudos that it was a Saturday night and the service and speed were that good."
Bre E.,"Hercules, CA",50,50,12,3.0,1/16/2010,"Not the best food..but good. Desserts are the best. The decor is nice as well, service is good. Should be taking all the business from BJ's..not a complete improvement but definitely better."
Dean T.,"Burlingame, CA",70,20,,2.0,1/13/2008,"The food is pretty good and there's a very diverse menu, but there is one huge drawback to this restaurant - the wait.  If you are unfortunate enough to come here around, say, dinner time, you're going to wait...  and wait... and wait to get a table.  They will ALWAYS tell you that it'll be ""about 20 minutes"".  30 minutes later, you check in with the hostess - ""oh, any minute now!""  15 minutes later you want to leave out of disgust, but you're already too invested, so you wait it out. If you don't mind waiting for a table, the service is usually quite good, but highly variable. Of course, you should save room for a slice of million-calorie cheesecake!"
Chris H.,"Hayward, CA",5,53,4,3.0,1/17/2010,"So many reviews already, so I'll keep this brief. The parking is convenient, the front desk staff were businesslike. On the two occasions we visited this particular store the wait staff were very good. On the first occasion one of the brunch orders was messed up, the manager and wait staff couldn't have handled it better, it was almost embarrassing how helpful they wanted to be, and yet the problem was fixed in minutes anyway. On the second occasion we went for dinner, the place was so dark that we could hardly read the menus and we resolved that in future we would bring some extra lighting. The entrees were fine but the appetizers have been so disappointing that we just don't bother any more.  We only had dessert at other parts of this chain, they were too rich and too big, but OK to share. Maybe if we go there again they will have fixed the lighting issue."
Peter E.,"San Rafael, CA",11,77,10,4.0,4/1/2007,"I love the bar and the high bar tables. Great place to meet with friends, watch sports and enjoy food and a beer. My family loves this place too. The menu is very wide and deep. Quiet noisy though and they don't have any services for the kids such as crayons etc. We keep coming back to this place we like it more and more. The service is always good and the food is good. My kids love this place. I'm changing my rating to 4 stars. YES!"
NinaJoy L.,"Windsor, CA",0,11,,5.0,7/8/2010,I just loved eating here.  The atmosphere is great.  We sat in a booth.  My very picky daughter had a real hard time deciding on what to eat as all the dishes are very tempting. The service was excellent.
Kentiya H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",26,15,1,3.0,4/23/2009,"I've been to the Corte Madera Cheesecake Factory twice now but I'd rather drive all the way to San Francisco just for better service. All of the employees at the Corte Madera location look so unhappy. I understand it is probably because they're working but I can at least act happy and be friendly when I'm at work. The food was good, the waiter was strange, the cheesecake had been previously cut and left in the fridge. My cheesecake was clearly at least two days old. I had asked for no whipped cream... But it came with whipped cream. Oh well. Maybe I'm being too nice with 3 stars."
Jay H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,18,,1.0,9/10/2008,"All of our orders were screwed up. I seriously doubt the cook knew what he was doing. We ordered roasted artichoke: that was underdone (could'nt even get to the meaty part, it was just really hard). We ordered a medium kobe beef burger: that one came out BLACK (and I mean REALLY burnt. talk about a waste of kobe beef!). We also ordered a chicken dish with bowtie pasta (dont remember the name), the bowtie pasta was underdone (it wasn't even al dente, it was just hard). Ordered Tiramisu cake (regular, not cheesecake): soggy and disgusting. Espresso: no foam? where did the foam go? bitter coffee? We told the waitress to take it back about 3 times. Never had such a terrible experience at these prices. Will most definately never be back again."
Benjamin C.,"Richmond, VA",76,51,1,2.0,3/27/2009,"At some point one of these chain restaurants is going to realize that perhaps feeding each person a portion that is made to feed two or three isn't the best idea.  The food overall is okay, you can't expect fresh local ingredients from a 20 page menu.  In order to produce the number of dishes they offer, things have to be thrown together quickly so you will see a whole lot of deep frying and very large freezers here.  Lastly if cheesecake is in your name, take the effort to make it right, not just giant and loaded with fat."
Linda F.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/24/2010,"This is definitely a lively, loud spot.  But, why do they have to charge so much for their specialty drinks and not put a price for them on the menu? I don't think the food is very good and the children's menu is overpriced. Unfortunately the Village has few food choices.  I miss the old California Cafe"
CINDY K.,"San Francisco, CA",119,228,8,4.0,7/5/2007,"*This is a Sunday Brunch Review Only* HELLA GOOD FRENCH TOAST!!!  And I'm not normally a french toast kinda gal, which is why I ordered their asparagus, portabellos & artichokes omelette w/added chicken apple sausage.  Lucky I was w/my friend who just couldn't decide b/t the french toast AND their sweet corn tamales - so he got both.  Our two other compadres for brunch got omelettes each AND they decided to split the belgian waffles, too. Count it, folks, that's right, we had a 1.5 entree platter (PLATTER, people, cuz it's The Cheesecake Factory) average per person at our table.   My lunch and dinner experiences at this location, as well as others have been consistently mediocre, a 3-star-edible-and-entirely-forgetful-neither-good-nor-bad-deal.   But wow we were all LOVING our brunch that day - omelette pan perfect fluffy-ness to the eggs, generous fresh chunks of filler and stellar, truly stellar, french toast!  The only disappointment was the belgian waffles - flavorless compared to the rest of our goodies. Too bad the special brunch is only for Sunday, but come out to this location and you'll be spared the bad parking and horrendous crowds. Oh, and their staff's actually real nice and seem to give a crap about you."
Teddy B.,"San Francisco, CA",474,192,24,3.0,8/1/2007,Curbside Service is available at the Corte Madera Cheesecake Factory. You can place your order at 415-945-0777 and 20 minutes later pull up in your Lexus or BMW or Aston Martin or Datsun 210 and pick up your take-out without ever getting out of your car. Just pull up to the restaurant and call the curbside pick up number and a chirpy tweener will run out your FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE or KEY LIME CHEESECAKE or whatever your indulgence. The End.
Rick H.,"Oakland, CA",401,1285,1012,3.0,12/12/2005,"One of your higher-end designer chains, but I believe they are stooping to new lows in this explosive growth phase of theirs by plopping down branches smack in the middle of suburban mall parking lots off the freeway.  And really, just because the portions are gigantic does not necessarily mean the food is that great, and it's not.  The best thing they offer here, as I mentioned vis-a-vis the Union Square location, are the appetizers and cheesecake selection, obviously.  Everything else is just blah."
miss lisa k.,"Minneapolis, MN",28,32,1,1.0,6/8/2005,"The Way too large portions of average tasting food. The menu is longer than most books I read (alas, could be commentary on the author here) and filled with ads. Wait-- you're already giving them your business, right? The decor is on par with cheesy buffets in Las Vegas.   If you are in Corte Madera and need to eat, opt for ""the Gap"" burrito at the  food court instead."
