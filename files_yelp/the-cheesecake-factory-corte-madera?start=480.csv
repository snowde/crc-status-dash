Melanie C.,"Pinole, CA",243,53,9,4.0,2/21/2009,"Well the wait here on a Friday night is long. But NOT as long as a wait on a Friday night at the cheesecake factory in San Francisco on top of Macy's on Union Square. The staff here are really nice! and we usually give a nice tip. When you order an entree you HAVE to order a cheesecake. if not, then what is the point of going to the CHEESECAKE factory! hehehe. unless you r a diabetic. then I don't know if they have a cheesecake for you. Does anyone know? A cheesecake made with sweet and low or something? hA."
Daisy S.,"Mililani, HI",53,490,196,3.0,1/28/2009,"The cheesecakes are the highlights of this place. The food?! ahhh! very average considering the wait time. So, I will reconsider it twice before coming here again."
Jane K.,"San Francisco, CA",4449,1213,1899,5.0,6/19/2006,"Yes it's a chain, yes it's corporate schmuck oversized and cheesy but boy, can they feed you! It's SO American that they just wanna create a ridiculous amount of options that nobody could possibly comprehend and then stuff the living daylights out of you till you can hardly stretch your belly to intake air.  YES! I feel like having a pep rally over it. But, if you really are too overwhelmed get the Baha chicken tacos. They're yummy. And you'll be eating them for days."
Jennifer N.,"San Francisco, CA",107,114,7,1.0,12/30/2008,"I went here one day when it was storming.  Therefore, the place wasn't busy.  My boyfriend and I helped ourselves to a bar table and we did not get any acknowledgment for 10 minutes.  This pissed me off so I walked up to the bar and asked for menus since no one wanted to bring us any and the beezy just threw it at me!  Excuse me?!!?  So we're sitting there deciding what to order--another 15 minutes passes and still not one waiter comes to our table.  It's not like we were invisible because it was busy.  This place was almost empty and the waiters were just standing around.  I wasn't gonna put up with it so we left after 30 minutes.  It was so bad I complained but haven't heard anything and its been a year.  I won't bring business to this location ever again."
Remy C.,"Richmond, CA",23,29,,4.0,10/7/2009,"I went here Sunday 10/4. I can honestly say I really like this place! Good drinks, Bomb food, BiG-ASS MENU! The service is not that great, we had a good waitress at first that was nice and took our orders and even explained the dishes to us. Then about 15 Mins. later, she came to our table and introduced our new waiter, a guy, who only checked on us once! (WTF?) Watever, This review is all about the food! I got the Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Madeira With the sauces on the side. Soooo Good! My Sister got the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean.. and by the looks of the the fish was very fresh and it really smelled good, my mom got the California Cheesesteak ( I know right, ya go ALL the way here just to order Cheesesteak moms?! Lol) But she said it was really good and tender! Food was excellent though. We ordered cheesecakes to go. We got Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecake (for me! YUMMY!) Dutch Apple Caramel Struesel, Low Carb Cheesecake with Strawberries ( for moms) And, Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake (for my sister) And OMG they were good! Like I said I really do like eating here. Its always a good time. This was my first time eating at this location, and I enjoyed it. Only thing about all Cheesecake Factories is that it isn't cheap. So when you go here try to have a good time!"
Karin H.,"Oakland, CA",52,103,10,2.0,1/27/2006,"Having only dined at this restaurant once, it's difficult to write a comprehensive review; their menu is ridiculously long.  Although I enjoyed my appetizer and salad, neither was remarkable.  Decor is absurd, and the clientele is worse: hordes of overweight,  bourgeois couples expecting to be pampered and willing to pay dearly for it.  This place gets two stars instead of one simply because A) the chocolate martini knocked me on my ass, and B) I'm in love with one of the waitresses."
Jan C.,"Haiku, HI",104,209,220,4.0,12/19/2007,"No apology, Why are people bashing?  This is not a destination restaurant, but a great place to go after shopping, or take a break from cooking.  The food is good, you can get away with an appetizer and you are full. I recently had firecracker salmon rolls, which were served over a heap of slaw of purple cabbage and  thai peanut dressing YUMMY!  All I needed for a great meal!"
Mary P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,33,,4.0,7/12/2009,"I know it's overpriced, but The Cheesecake Factory is so delicious I just can't stay away.  I've been here for a few birthday parties and just with my friends for dinner, and it's always a fun, festive place with delicious food.  We usually order the appetizer sampler, which is filling enough to serve as a main course - especially because the cheesecake is so rich you don't want to fill up before dessert! It loses a star for pricey-ness and spotty service, but other than that, I have no complaints!"
Sophie C.,"San Rafael, CA",0,10,15,1.0,4/10/2011,The red velvet cake is made of half a batter without taste and half butter - I weighted the amount of frosting per serving = 7oz ! Not worth the price or the calories at all...
lisa w.,"San Francisco, CA",73,427,,2.0,5/22/2007,"good salads, but eh service.  the few times i've been here the noise level was pretty ridiculous such that my companion couldn't hear me speaking.  the last time i went here (which was quite a while ago and i haven't been back) the restaurant was mostly empty but they sat my dad and i next to a birthday table with about 15 people at it who were all yelling and laughing and standing (yes, standing) around their table and crowding into our table. it's not such a big deal to have a birthday party nearby your table, but it's pretty ridiculous to have people's asses literally 4 inches from our table nearly leaning on our table (i'm not exaggerating) while yelling and cheering. now here's the clincher: our waitress didn't even notice!! we had to ask her to move us (which she had to have someone else do since she didn't have the authority or whatever)  anyhoo, never been back."
Carlos C.,"San Francisco, CA",29,13,1,1.0,4/16/2010,"I visited the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera on a Sunday for lunch. The service was terrible. When I arrived I was given a pager  to be called when a table for 4 opened up. As I waited for a table for 20 minutes, the hostess took the pager and told me to wait while she prepared a table for our party, she then proceeded to take us to an open section in the middle of the restaurant. As we sat on a table, another hostess came over to us and told us to move that the section that we were seating was not open. She then took us to the waiting area for more time , and she went on to take a recently arrived party to the table that she had told us to move from. She then walked away while other hostesses continued to seat other customers with pagers that arrived at the restaurant after us. We waited another 5 minutes until they took us to the end of the restaurant to an almost completely empty area. We certainly questioned their actions and lack of professionalism. I do not recommend this place at all, The food was just mediocre and the service was totally rude."
David N.,"San Rafael, CA",3,44,,4.0,1/5/2009,"Delicious food and decent service.  HOWEVER, one star docked because the waiters practically tackle you as you are walking through the aisles!  Slow down people!"
Clara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",767,820,613,4.0,6/1/2007,"the wait was only 30 minutes on a saturday evening at 6:30 pm! if you've been to any other cheesecake factories, you'd realize that this is an extremely short wait. :P but actually, we ended up not waiting at all because there was an open table in the bar area, so we took that. anyway, food was good as usual - not gourmet but definitely better than most chains - and service was decent. i'd go back if i were in the area."
Sammy S.,"Oakland, CA",366,281,22,3.0,11/6/2006,"I'm not really a big fan of the cheesecake factory. The portions of food are absolutely ridiculous. Like there is this Asian salad that has crunchies piled on top, that is seriously as tall as the leaning tower of Pisa. Who really needs that much food I ask? (and believe me, I love huge portions, but this is unreal). And do you notice who is eating at the Cheesecake factory? Mommies who take their little kids here during a day of shopping. These poor kids are being breed to think like fat kids. After enough visits to the cheesecake factory they will begin to think ""hey, this is a normal sized meal,"" then they'll start complaining about the too-small portions you serve them at home.   I'm also freaked out by the all-white attire worn by the staff. White is the most impractical color to wear in a restaurant. It's just a recipe for a big, ugly disaster that there is no way to cover up. The ambiance is totally tacky and over the top. It looks like a restaurant in a Vegas hotel, with all the cheesy murals and chandeliers.   I actually think the food is not bad and I come here for lunch once in a while if I'm in the hood, and by in the hood, I mean shamelessly shopping at the yuppiest outdoor ""shopping center"" aka mall in town. So the lunch food is ok, but the cheesecakes here are fucking great. I try to get ones that aren't too complex, because if you add too much to you're cheesecake, it basically becomes something else. But I'm a huge fan of the banana cream cheesecake. Out of this world I tell you. Just like Evie!  Side bar that indicates I may start eating like the fat kids at the Cheesecake factory:  Last week we celebrated my father's birthday, which happens to fall on Halloween. So not only had I already eaten more candy in one night than an entire year (I'm usually not that into candy), but my mom had picked up a traditional old fashion cheesecake. I only ate a tiny slice, but this weekend, while my parents were out of town, I decided to eat one of the left over pieces. As I started to dig in, I began eying the left over Halloween candy, picturing how amazing it would be if I crumbled bits of Twix on top of the cheesecake. I mean, the Cheesecake factory would do it, actually I think they do, but with Snickers. I walked back and forth to the bucket of candy three or four times before I decided it would be way too disgusting to do what I was daydreaming about. See, just ordering food from the restaurant take-out style leaves me with fat kid mentality. I think I need a break from the factory. Time to get my head back together."
Christy M.,"San Francisco, CA",53,218,,4.0,3/27/2007,"I give this restaurant a better review than the Union Square, SF location because I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes at the Marin location. It's sad that they got rid of the gourmet food court at The Village, but Cheesecake's good. I usually share a salad and an entree between 2 other girlfriends and that's plenty. Basically, cheap eats, decent food, a refueling break between shops."
Tonya J.,"Olympia, WA",10,29,,4.0,1/25/2008,"Although, we have visited The Cheesecake Factory in many states this one is our favorite location. The food is plentiful & always good, hot, & fresh. Although, my spouse & I have been on diets since January 2007, & we had to ban eating out (other than on special events.) We are able to split our meals & still leave extremely full. However, there is always long waits, but the experience is always worth the wait."
Alexandra M.,"Tiburon, CA",1,43,65,3.0,10/8/2008,Huge menu I can never make up my mind. Once I have made up my mind I am never satisfied once the food comes. There is always wayyy too much and I get tired of the flavor after about three bites. Good desserts though.
Mario P.,"South San Francisco, CA",101,232,264,5.0,6/25/2008,"Took my co-worker to lunch for her birthday.  We were seated rather quickly (come before 11:45am to avoid the wait).  Our server was named ""Dash"" (at least that what it said on the receipt) and he certainly lived up to his name.  Not only was he polite and friendly, but the service on the appetizer, main dish and dessert was consistently quick throughout the meal.  We had an internet coupon for a free dessert because of their anniversary this week.  He double checked with the manager and informed us we only needed to purchase entrees that were at least $8.00, which we both did.  She had the chopped salad (loved it) and I had the Double BBQ Bacon Burger (Angus Beef...YUMMMMY).  She also ordered a crab cake appetizer, which was also good with the sauce that came with it.  Going back to the coupon, he surprisingly informed us we were entitled to another dessert (after we had just split the first one - Dulce De Leche Cheesecake was sinful).  We apparently read the coupon wrong and that was really nice of him to point this out.  I'm not sure what prompted it, but he shook both of our hands and thanked us for coming (before I even settled the bill).  I never had a server offer to shake my hand before, so thought that was a nice honest gesture on his part.  I gave him 25% for such great service and a great attitude.  I've been on a roll with getting such good servers lately and this was no exception.  Someone there better give him a raise (really!).  Big props to this location! FYI:  I looked at my leftovers a few days later and noticed the 1/2 of the fries I didn't finish weren't there.  I'm a little bummed, but I won't change the rating.  However, I would suggest checking your ""to go"" box after they pack it before you leave."
Jedimaster J.,"El Cerrito, CA",1,89,,3.0,10/12/2007,"This place is attached to a huge outdoor shopping plaza.  If you're planning on clothes shopping, I advise you shop first, then eat.  Don't eat first and then shop.  You won't fit into anything and will be tempted to buy a moomoo.  The portions at this restaurant are no joke.  The half salads alone may require a doggy bag.  Not bad for a chain restaurant.  Consistently tasty and they have a huge selection."
Ameigh F.,"San Francisco, CA",34,112,,2.0,3/28/2008,"working at the village mall for almost two years, i have to say that i have eaten here a fair amount of times and can give a pretty accurate review. the food is okay as long as you dont eat there all the time, which was hard for me because there was no food court there at all. the portions are HUGE! even the lunch portions were enough for two people. and in my opinion, nothing on the menu is a healthy choice. bleh. eating lunch there would always make me go into a food coma in the afternoon. its good, but too much. also, the staff isnt always on it. i would call in my order and a few times, it wasnt even put in the system and i had to wait another 15 minutes there while it was prepared. service was slow for sit down as well.  the drinks were good, but i just felt like everything was overpriced and heavy...and that doesnt match with the sunnyness of corte madera."
