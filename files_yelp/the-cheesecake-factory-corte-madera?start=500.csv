Jen J.,"San Francisco, CA",76,127,13,5.0,5/13/2005,"I usually hate large chain restaurants but everything on the menu at the Cheesecake Factory has impressed me. My favorite thing is the Thai Lettus Raps.....fills me up and I always have leftovers, and its only $10! Get the Carmel Apple Struddle Cheesecake its creamy, and lighter than a lot of the other kinds."
Gabe F.,"New Rochelle, NY",4,31,,4.0,6/11/2008,"The food is usually very good, the service is great, and it's pretty cheap. Sometimes they oversalt the food, but for the most part, this is a good place to go. They don't take reservations, though."
David B.,"San Francisco, CA",56,127,,3.0,6/30/2006,"Cheesecake Factory has big portions of everything, and by everything the menu covers a whole range of types of food. Easy place to go when you have no other ideas.  Salmon salad is great and the Ton of Fun Burger will have you dead! Place can get crowded so look for the island seating in the bar, free for all. The special drinks are over the top and I can never eat a main dish and make it to the Cheescake one day!"
Jenna M.,"San Francisco, CA",25,241,,3.0,7/27/2007,"I went here for the first time the other day and I really didn't see what all the hype was about.  I got the four cheese pasta and it tasted like I could have made it at home for $3.  The server was very friendly and the food was reasonably priced, but I have no desire to return."
Jen Ken H.,"San Francisco, CA",7,95,,3.0,9/8/2006,"J says: what the heck is up with the portions here?  this is why peope have an obesity problem.  i ordered the lunch portion of a cobb salad and it was like a mountain of food.  i ate and ate and ate and only polished off half of it.  i shudder to think how gigantic the dinner portions must be.  there's almost too much to choose from on the menu, it annoyed me having to flip through 20 pages of stuff.  based on food and atmosphere just 2 stars but i'll give it one more since the service was friendly and very accomodating to my friend who had two little kids."
Sandy F.,"San Francisco, CA",2,2,,1.0,5/2/2010,"We ate at the CM Cheesecake Factory last night in celebration of my brother-in-law's birthday, and within hours I was frightfully ill. I had the herb encrusted salmon, a mocha, and a hot chocolate -  all delicious at the time, but not so delicious as it burned my esophagus at 2:00 am. As I write, I am in abdominal pain and am - forgive the reference - pooping out everything I take in. I was forced to miss the $100/ticket seminar I had paid to attend today and feel too weak  to do much of anything. Wish I could take back last night... Never. Again."
Kris O.,"San Rafael, CA",473,133,129,3.0,9/19/2008,"I remember back in 2004 when this place was being built and how much of a big deal this joint was going to be, and since their opening in I have been a guest here on several occasions. I have tried numerous appetizers, salads, small plates, pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, cocktails and cheesecakes over the years and Its always been sort of the same thing. My opinion on this establishment fluctuates all the time I either hate it or I love it dearly. What I don't like about this restaurant is that it is busy most of the time and they always seems to sit you somewhere that isn't very comfortable. I disapprove of a restaurant that dares calls themselves the ""Cheesecake Factory"" and doesn't make their own cheesecakes. I found out that they are shipped there every morning and all that is actually made there is the food itself. Now over time I have had really great waiters and really bad ones some are absolutely on their game and ready to assist you. Some have seemed disinterested in what they do or have creeped me out a little. There portions are huge and basically you will want to split some of their items with a friend or date, I could not even imagine eating it all by myself. Now what I do like is that the cheesecakes are good, filling but good. I always love there bread that they bring out right when you get there, its so damn good. I like there new introductions to a Tapas menu so you can eat here now without spending an arm and leg and they are small so you don't leave feeling like a fat cow. I like there smoothies, and coffee items also they make wonderful cocktails (when I drank) with a full bar with many options. This restaurant is good for groups, birthday dinners, and a special night out with friends, family or if you got a hot date. I try to eat here once in awhile but I couldn't eat here everyday because then I may end up looking like Rose O' Donnell."
perry a.,"Sausalito, CA",19,62,1,3.0,11/8/2009,"I had been to the Corte Madera Cheesecake Factory twice, the first time we left because the only tables available were outside and it was 50 degrees and blowing. The second time was for lunch and after a bit of a wait, we were seated and it was OK. My problem with the Cheesecake factory had been the impression that you had to wait way too long for an OK meal. This past weekend we stopped in at 11:40am with an out of town guest and the first thing I heard from the host was "" we're very busy and not all of the staff has reported..."" so I'm thinking...here we go. There had to be 15 people ahead of us...and it's not even noon! After 10 minutes we are seated. I pull up Yelp! on my BB to see what I might be getting into...bad service average food, etc. Surprise! The waiter was at our table immediately, took our drink orders, returned in a few minutes and took our lunch order. A bus boy delivered the warm bread and lunch was served in 15 minutes. Food was fine, the service outstanding, the check was delivered timely. Patience I will need for the amount of wait time for a table but if everything else holds up, I can make the Cheesecake Factory one of my usuals."
A. C.,"Burlingame, CA",0,38,,2.0,1/26/2009,"My Cobb salad was the strangest thing I've ever experienced - a giant heap of 95% lettuce and 5% miniscule chicken shreds, bacon bits, egg bits and blue cheese granules, with a whisper of tomato.  It was so totally awful and bland I had to send it back, and that is NOT something I normally do.  Everything was, how do you say?  Meh.  The turtle cheesecake was good though.  I would say use this place as a place to go for dessert and maybe appetizers with the girls.  The menu is definitely all style and promise, but falls flat on its a** when it comes to flavour.  Service is average."
Maria F.,"Point Reyes Station, CA",0,10,,4.0,2/7/2012,the happy hour here rocks...loved everything i ordered....yummy!!!!
Patricia R.,"La Quinta, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/1/2007,"Very disappointing experience at this Cheesecake Factory.  This makes 2 locations that have been substandard in the past 2 months. Fish tacos were loaded with coleslaw, couldn't find the fish in 2 of them and there was no fish in the third.  My husband had a club sandwich that was served dry, because the server did not listen and when the sandwich was brought out, we were told ""the french fries just weren't ready yet.""  It was like bringing out a salad and asking you to wait for the dressing, odd way to serve lunch.   The service was slow and the server kept popping by to say ""1 more minute"" - for more than 20 minutes. The Cheesecake Factory at one time was a fun, inexpensive and yet high quality restaurant, now it has been crossed off of my list."
ashley l.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/4/2007,"I was among the first people to be hired to work at this place. I was hired before it was even built.  The first day it opened we had 20 or more EX-CCF employees picketing our front doors. I should have taken the hint then and left.  The food here is terrible for the price For one the portions are HUGE. That is something that this place takes pride in. But I think its unhealthy. It just encourages people to eat appetizers the size of two meals. Then the meals themselves are so huge it would feed my whole family. Beyond that the food is extremely fatty, e.g. Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls ... Despite how hard I worked and all the heavy lifting I did, when I was gone, I had gained a ton of weight and 6 months later I had lost 40 lbs by just not eating there anymore.   Beyond that the food itself is just mediocre. I don't know why anyone would pay $20 for something that I could make at home from a box in a fraction of the time it takes to go there, wait for a table and then wait for the food. Its really not worth it.  Another point is a good portion of the food is taken from other restaurants, they even admit it, they have us sing the burger king song to remember the ingrediants on one of their burgers. They have $6 burger type things from Carl's Jr. except a little bit taller and they charge $15. Even working there and getting a 50% discount on the food the only thing I could really afford was a burger or pizza or an appetizer on what they paid me. Trust me, the food is crap for what you are paying for it.  The service is terrible, and you know why? they can't keep anyone there longer than a few months. I was only there 6 or 7 months and I still outlasted several of their managers. No one that I started with is still there, not even the manager who hired me. When I put this place on resumes I have to write that my managers are no longer there so there is really no point in calling for a reference. IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN OPEN 3 YEARS!!!! Trust me, if you are thinking about somewhere to eat in Marin, there are so many wonderful places to eat, I don't know why in the world you would pick something so generic and overpriced as the cheesecake factory."
Sally H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3,,1.0,7/4/2008,"My previously favorite, easy, sometimes delicious open later than normal restaurant will not be visited by myself again.  Unfortunately there was a cockroach on table that appeared under my friends plate : (  F That!  I think I'm gonna be sick.  The manager did comp our meals and said that pest control was on the way, but really, I'm going to be sick."
Michelle I.,"San Francisco, CA",869,620,21,4.0,5/13/2005,i was so against coming here until finally i caved-in and went... now i've actually been back a few times because they have some excellent salads on the menu! there's 3 i have problems choosing between because they're all so good.
Jose D.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,31,3,4.0,3/2/2009,i liked this cheesecake factory the service was good and so was the food even though it took a little longer to get to our table than expected the food was worth the wait plus the people their were very experienced and had a great mood i would recommend this place for a good night out
Sina H.,"Novato, CA",1,32,,2.0,3/23/2011,"I have always been a huge fan of the cheesecake factory, I still am. However, I am NOT fond of the one in Corte Madera. I love the one in the city, anyways, I came by to have lunch with a friend. I met her at our table and ordered a glass of white wine. It took our waiter more than 10 minutes to bring it to us. There was absolutely no bread brought to use either! (P.S. as everyone knows, the cheesecake factory has the best bread ever!!!! I could die for some right now :) then we ordered our food, she ordered a soup which was okay she said. I ordered a Thai peanut sauce chicken pasta. It was LOADED with sauce and tasted way too sweet. The chicken and rice was alright but it would have been much, much better with less sauce on it. I had a stomach ache for the rest of the day. Next time I crave the cheesecake factory, I am defiantly going to the one in Union City, SF.  & I will ask for light on the sauce. Hope this helps anyone if they decide to order this."
Greg B.,"Larkspur, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/19/2007,"OK, I've been there twice and that's enough. The first time I thought I was in a Disney World restaurant. I thought Mickey was coming out to serve my meal, but no it wasn't be. Disney may be over the top, and that's OK, but not at the local mall. At least Disney gets you your food on time. I did eventually get my food from the robot waiter with three communication devices strapped to him and thought there must be some mistake, I only need a single portion, not three. The portions sizes there are OUT OF CONTROL. Food was mediocre. That was my first time in. The second time my son and I walked in to check out the take out desserts. Someone had just barfed in the reception area. I guess they figured they could eat the whole thing. No more for me."
Jeannie W.,"San Francisco, CA",58,29,,3.0,4/16/2007,"came here for dinner with the bf and his auntie after an afternoon of roaming around the outlets in petaluma.  gave the hostess my name for our party and was told the wait would be approximately 10-15 minutes.  after 10-15 minutes our little buzzer went off and we were seated at a table in front of the bar.  ordered some calamari for an appetizer, the bf had a tons of fun burger, his auntie had a pulled pork sandwich and i had the bistro shrimp pasta.  we got our appetizer maybe about 15 minutes after we ordered.  by that time, i was famished already so i practically gobbled down the whole plate, barely leaving any for the bf and his auntie.  we finish our appetizer and it seems like another 30 minutes before we get our main dishes.  i was starting to get really impatient because i kept seeing parties that were seated after us get their food first.  FINALLY our food came and the bf asked how come our food took so long and our server told us that ""sometimes the pasta takes longer.""  i was thinking, WTF?  pasta shouldn't take that long to boil, but i just shut my little mouth and decided to let it go and enjoy my meal.  the portions are so ginormous that of course i had to take my food to go.  surprisingly, we opted not to have any dessert since we were stuff already.  all in all, i didn't really expect much from this place anyway, since it's your usual type of food.    if it weren't for the fact that our server was nice and that the wait was actually 10-15 miniutes, i would only give two stars."
