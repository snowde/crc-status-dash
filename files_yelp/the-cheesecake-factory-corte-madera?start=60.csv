Darlene C.,"Napa, CA",23,159,97,1.0,7/17/2016,"RECOMMENDATION:  Definitely steer clear from THIS particular CF (usually a crowd-pleaser kind of staple when we can't decide what we want) - it is so poorly run, its really SAD.   FAILURE OF CORPORATE:  I mean, these gorgeous places cost millions to build and it's like they aren't even giving their staff food service training 101, so they have tools to be successful and I get the impression from the wait staff that the kitchen causes a lot of the problem.  TRAIN them, please. Their timing is TERRIBLE.  It took us 10 just to be greeted and put in a drink order.  Whomever actually checks in on social media for CF, I hope to God you're paying attention to the sentiment of your most recent crappy reviews:  there's a reason. OUR ISSUE:  (this time? aside from the poor service) Limp, just past raw potato, fries - a simple ""extra crispy"" request and they weren't even close.  And a veggie burger that was so undercooked, it presented like raw (albeit veggie) hamburger that broke apart and fell from the bun every time I took a bite:  the only reason I ate it (with a FORK!) was because I knew I would be there another hour waiting for someone to come and re-fire it for me ... Aside from that, they forgot the lemons for my daughter's salmon, we had to beg for water and iced tea refills, and it took 20 minutes to get the fries re-fried that I gave up even wanting, because the excitement of excellent fries anticipation was long passed and then I was all agro at what was supposed to be an awesome start of my shopping trip with my 19-year-old. SUMMARY:  Bummed because it really turns me off from CF's in general, thinking that they all might be run like this one, and why bother, when you're busting out $50 for lunch.  Oh yeah, and when I asked for a manager the collective looks from the busser and the hostess up front, chatting, was like ""I have no idea what you're talking about - manager? what's THAT?""  The adult busser looked at the teenage hostess and said, I guess she's IT!""  Ridiculous.  Sad.  Get your sh*# together Cheesecake Factory!"
Alyssa J.,"Tigard, OR",135,577,161,1.0,6/20/2016,"They really need to get it together for happy hour over here or they're going to lose customers. I came in at 4:30 on Friday and asked if bar was self seating for hh and was told that it in fact was. I picked out a seat my party of four, and then I was rudely confronted by a different hostess who said we had taken her table she was planning on using. When i expressed my confusion there was no empathy, just a nasty reply ""there's other people waiting."" OOOkkkaayyy. So I went to the bar and ordered a beer at the counter. Bartender seemed nice. We finally found a bar table that was free, and it took 10 minutes to get someone to clean it despite asking several people. After that we were left alone... as were the two tables next to us. Look, i know 4:30/5 is the shift change over, but this really is no excuse. It became laughable that the three tables banded together, and kept asking passing by servers if they could take our order. Despite many people on the floor, we were told by everyone ""it's the end of my shift I'm leaving."" My suggestion to the management would be to a) stagger the start/end times of shifts, b) have a dedicated hh server, c) explain to employees that they can't be so rude. Finally, one server who told us he was supposed to be leaving took all 3 tables orders, and acted like he was doing us a big favor. After that we had a bunch of different people helping us so it was hard to say who's responsibility we were. The apps were just fine, and I wished we'd had a better experience. We won't be coming back here for happy hour."
James M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/26/2017,"Great dinner, great server (thanks, Scott). My orange chicken, and my wife's salmon were perfect.   If only they had a lunch sized portion of nachos, or we had better self control, we'd have had room for dessert!"
Kate M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",21,152,231,2.0,12/28/2015,"The 2 stars are for: *decent wait time and table accommodation with our children  It was disappointing that it took 10 minutes to even be approached with a greeting. Then, it felt like we didn't see our server until he brought out food, then the bill. I wanted to ask for a couple of things but never got the opportunity. The food (shared the avocado salad and flat bread) wasn't bad, wasn't incredible either. Beside the bad service, I'm just not the biggest Cheesecake Factory Fan and can't see why so many people are so crazy over it."
Pam George C.,"Menifee, CA",76,6,2,1.0,11/11/2017,"When we Yelped Chessecake Factory and saw the lower number of stars given by other customers we thought... What the heck?! We decided to give it a try anyway.  We really should have listened to the low ratings given! The bathroom had not one seat cover in any of the stalls.  How long did that bathroom go unattended to not have one seat cover in any of the four stalls? That alone should have told us what kind of service the place gives.  When we checked in we were told the wait would be 20 minutes. After waiting 45 minutes, we were finally seated in our booth. Hungry and ready to eat we ordered our meals. It took another 45 minutes to get our food. Without asking, the manager stopped by to apologize for the extended wait stating that ""the pasta station is a bit behind."" She ssw that we had our small son with us and offered a bowl of rice to ""tide him over"" until our dishes were served. Gee thanks for the thought however no we do not want a plate of rice to ruin my son's appetite so he won't eat what we ordered him. I am thankful that she apologized and came over to check on us but I do feel that something more should have been done. At the very least a discount on our meal. We will not be returning to any Cheesecake Factory. Their service and food  have been steadily declining over the years."
Peggy F.,"San Rafael, CA",28,6,,1.0,1/12/2017,Last time I am eating here. The fish tacos were cold. My husbands turkey was old and the roll Too sweet. Our server Sara was very attentive But could not make up for the food. The last 2 times I was here I had the Luau salad.  It was thrown into the bowl. Chicken was old. I tried...it must be good  if you just have dessert.
Scott B.,"Philadelphia, PA",160,115,92,4.0,11/15/2016,"I love the cheesecake factory. the menu is extremely vast and there is something for every appetite size and desire. don't fill up too much on the main though, as you need to make sure you save room for cheesecake!!"
Paul D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",54,233,128,4.0,7/26/2016,"We love Cheesecake Factory but are disappointed when they consistently run out of brown bread and take a super long time to serve our dinner. The waitresses and hostesses are friendly and terrific considering they have no control of wait. The food is great. This place is crowded. Wonderful  place to celebrate Birthdays , family dinners, and anniversary's. We recommend Cheesecake Factory but don't expect brown bread"
Lynnette F.,"Novato, CA",29,331,1051,4.0,10/12/2015,"Andrew was our server and he was very friendly and efficient.   We started with warm bread and butter, as well as an appetizer ; guacamole and chips. The guacamole was seasoned well, and flavorful.  We shared a bacon cheeseburger,  the bacon was crisp, and hot.  We ordered dessert to go.  One pumpkin cheesecake,  and one dry , likely week old carrot cake. I'll never order dessert to go again.   I believe the prices are a bit over the top.  $50.00 for a shared meal."
William W.,"San Rafael, CA",134,69,105,4.0,1/15/2016,"First time visiting Cheesecake Factory after all of my friends ranting and raving about their food. I decided to go for my birthday to try it out and I have to say my friends were spot on about the food quality and portions. I can't remember the exact name of the pasta dish I ate but it was a shrimp based pasta with tomatoes and other dressings and it was very delicious. The portion was enough to have some for the next day as well which is always a plus in my opinion. Also I'm not a big dessert eater but since I'm here I had to try a piece of cheesecake. I got the red velvet cheesecake and if you are a fan of red velvet cake and cheesecake this combo will definitely put you on a cloud a fly you to the moon. One of the best slices of cheesecake I have ever eaten. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because the service was good but not great. They could have been understaffed of course (which I know he feeling) but it was hard to find the server at times even while walking around the restaurant looking for him, but he was very good when he was with us. This place is a must stop if you haven't eaten here before or if you just want a slice of cheesecake."
Bruce B.,"Walnut Grove, CA",43,775,1001,5.0,8/11/2015,"Went to several restaurants prior to arriving here. Some were so busy you could not park and others you can drink at the bar but not eat.  Here's a spot where the table at rush comes with a wait. However at the bar you just walk in and sit down.  Still have a wonderful menu with so much to choose from. Big fully stocked bar for all those drinks and a great wine selection as well.  Tonight I had catfish and mash, wow how yummy!  My server at the bar was very attentive and exceeded my expectations!  This is all the way around an excellent meal. I have this spot bookmarked."
Jimmy L.,"San Francisco, CA",35,122,132,3.0,6/29/2016,"Great Location, Excellent service, gorgeous restaurant. Food reasonably priced. A large group ordered an assortment of different items, the diane steak, spaghetti and meatballs,burgers,appetizers..all solid. This is a chain so don't expect the high flavors of the top 100 in San Francisco. Still it is a good place to go, relax and get some decent food. Our server was very attentive, the establishment is very busy and getting seating can be a challenge especially on holidays."
Kassie R.,"Napa, CA",29,14,2,1.0,8/13/2017,"Do you want to experience dining where the wait staff couldn't give a damn that you are there? Well if the answer is yes, then look no further than the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera.  I have had two very lousy experiences at this location. Let me say that I have been to the Union Square and Walnut Creek locations many times and never had a bad experience ever.  The first bad experience I was with my friend getting dinner. The wait staff barely paid any attention to us. Never bothered to ask how our food was. Never got us drink refills. They gave us the check before we had even finished our dinner. Very rude.  My last terrible experience here was about a month ago. I was passing through the area and decided to stop by for dinner. After waiting for a table for 20 mins (totally understandable) I was seated. I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter ever acknowledged me. Never asked for a drink order. Never said they would be right with me. They managed to service the tables on both sides on mine in this time, but they completely ignored me. After 15 minutes I just left. How hard is it to get service at this location?? I used to love the Cheesecake Factory but honestly after my visits to this location, I'm really starting to think less of the place. I will never EVER return to the Corte Madera location. Worst. Service. Ever."
Sylvia L.,"Novato, CA",89,172,66,4.0,4/26/2017,"This is your typical Cheesecake factory. I have only eaten at a couple, but there are many and they all look like this one. It's just pretty average. They were real busy and we had to wait about 20 min. Which is not bad if you're expecting it. There's places to walk around and sit outside, so it's not that bad. They told us it would be about 20 min and it was pretty spot on. It may have been faster, but it definitely wasn't longer. I honestly don't remember what I ordered so it must not have been very memorable. I think it was chicken pot pie. The dessert was the black tie cheesecake, iirc. It had a vanilla mouse and chocolate. Of course, it was bomb as hell. This is not a place I go often, since I do tend to avoid crowds, and try to eat healthy,  but it's fun for a day when you're cheating on your diet and want to have a comforting meal. I have nothing bad to say about it. Then again, my expectations are pretty low when it comes to these types of places. I'll go back, but not often."
Jenna L.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,54,20,1.0,6/4/2017,"Horrible. Everything. We ordered 2 salads and a lettuce wrap & we waited an hour for it. When they brought it to us they tried to sugar coat it and say the shrimp took a long time...cooking shrimp should take no more than 10 min & that would be over cooked, so I don't buy that. They comped our cheesecake but in my opinion, they should have done more. We were there for almost 2 hours to have a simple lunch. And even with all the waiting they didn't come by our table to make sure we were ok or anything, awful service. Just awful. We saw friends walk into the plaza and they said they were going to boudin next door (mind you we'd already been there 40 min). They went in, order, ate and left and we were just finishing our food when they left. Ridiculous. Save yourself time, money & anger and do NOT go here. The last time I said i wasn't going back, now I know why!"
Erin K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",49,288,190,4.0,4/2/2016,"*VEGAN* & gluten free review: I referenced PETA's guide before coming so that I would have a good idea of what I could/could not eat. According to the guide, the Cheesecake Factory has a lot of items that are vegan-friendly that are not just salads (see list below); however, I decided to just go for a salad anyways and got the ""Super Antioxidant Salad"" with the dressing on the side, which is under the ""Super Food"" page in the menu. It was legit so good. Dressing was on point, almonds, roasted pears, kale, blueberries, etc... so yummy. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal, because chain restaurants don't cater to vegans and special ordering something always turns out way bland. I didn't even have to special order here! I highly recommend this salad for vegans/nonvegans/people who want a salad option.  Here is a copy/paste from PETA's vegan guide of options from Cheesecake Factory. Salads Vegan Cobb Salad Super Antioxidant Salad California Guacamole Salad (Hold the feta cheese, avocado cream drizzle, and try it with any of the vegan dressings listed below instead of the cilantro dressing.) Kale and Quinoa Salad (Hold the Parmesan cheese.) Falafel Salad (Order it without feta cheese, and with any of the vegan dressings listed below.).) Fresh Vegetable Salad (Hold the white cheddar.) French Country Salad (Hold the goat cheese.) Tossed Green Salad (Hold the croutons.) Endive Salad (Hold the blue cheese.)

Kurt H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",28,53,4,5.0,4/16/2017,Hard to go wrong here. Something for everyone whether you want cheesecake or not. My daughter loved her chocolate mousse cheesecake and the ahi tartare was absolutely delicious.
Destinee Y.,"Davis, CA",52,13,5,2.0,3/6/2017,"I came to this location at dinner for a friends birthday hoping to have a nice and fun night and unfortunately our whole group left extremely disappointed.  I have a relatively long list of issues I had while there so I'll just start from the beginning.  Firstly we were seated at a dirty table that took waayyy too long after we were seated to be cleared. Our server Hannah H finally brought us bread and DIRTY plates said she would be back to take our drink orders and then disappeared for a good 20 minutes, long story short she took the dirty plates back and never brought new ones out. We got the mac and cheese balls and a side of asparagus as an appetizer. SIDENOTE the asparagus side was $6.95 for 5 soggy unseasoned cold pieces of asparagus... what. It was an hour and a half after we arrived that we finally got our food. The appetizers (cold) came with the main dishes -- the plates were obviously sitting under a warmer forever before being brought out to us. I ordered a burger with a side salad, and didn't receive the salad until after myself and everyone else in my group was done with our entrees, keep in mind the salad was literally just spring mix drenched in balsamic vinaigrette. Our water cups were only refilled once after being directly asked for a refill. Overall it was just a really lame experience, we were so so neglected which is totally unacceptable. Hopefully this can be taken constructively and changes can be made to ensure better service in the future."
Kaitlyn O.,"Corte Madera, CA",177,2,,5.0,5/12/2017,"I come here about once a week, so I've had many different waiters before. Today I had the pleasure of Scott  waiting our table. He is the best waiter I've had at any restaurant! So kind and thoughtful and a pleasure to work with. Will be requesting him any time I go!!"
payam b.,"Sausalito, CA",124,74,21,3.0,6/28/2017,Food as always very good but service at this location terrible . Always food coming at your desk cold and takes time . You need to ask your servant several time to get a napkin or water . I hope they hire a better manger seems like the current one not very good .
