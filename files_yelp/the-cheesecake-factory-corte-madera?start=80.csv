david s.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,10,1,1.0,4/28/2017,"This place is horrible. The service was super slow, the waiter and waitress (yes it took that long that we had both) were not good at their jobs. The food was bland and to top it all off, one of us dropped their iPhone at the table when we left. We came back in no more than 5 minutes later and it was gone. This is the last time I will be going to a CCF."
Cherie S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/18/2017,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory...BUT this one is the absolute WORST one I've EVER been too!!! I ordered the firecracker salmon and it was so skimpy and it looked like it was literally just thrown on the plate. I couldn't believe it, I've NEVER seen it served like this EVER and I've been to at least 8+ different cities and this was the absolute worst. The waiter we had was really NICE and attentive, I was a little shocked he didn't have them redo it--unless, this is how they normally serve it."
Lizette R.,"Sonoma, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I have been here MULTIPLE times over the years and I have NEVER had a bad experience until today. If I could give their manager and Michelle zero stars I would. We got here at 4:30 pm and we did not get out until 7:15...WHY?? Because apparently they had just changed their menu and ""the kitchen was having a hard time with it"". There were seven of us, and two of us didn't even get our food until everybody else was done eating. One of the late plates came with white rice that was absolutely dry....how you mess up steamed rice is beyond me but whatever. It happened. This wasn't even the worst part. Our server, Michelle, was absolutely flustered. She just could not handle her work and it was showing and we weren't even that needy of a table, but she only refilled our waters twice in the TWO HOURS AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES we were forced to endure her service.  Anybody would become annoyed by waiting for so long to just receive food and the check. We were pissed especially after a long day in the city. When the checks came, she messed it ALL up. Again, how she did it was beyond me. We had three tags already separated And we had all put our cards down with the correct receipts, but when she came back they were all completely swapped and some of us paid more than we even had to. I understand splitting tags is hard. Ok. But She didn't even apologize for all the inconvenience. She managed to blame the kitchen for late food and get pissed at the fact that we were beyond annoyed with the service. She was rude to us as if we were the inconvenience!!! After speaking to Luis, the manager TWICE he said the best he could do was comp dessert.....of all the things he could of done he thought that was his best option?? Not even a coupon to return not even a free meal that was over 45-minutes late, not even an apology!! This was absurd. Absolute WORST service I have ever experienced here, and let me reiterate that it has never, never, never, been this terrible. It wasn't even busy when we arrived and because of there inability to provide good customer service, we had a great day ruined by a terrible attitude and a manager who can barely manage. Obviously I will not be returning."
Tucker J.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/11/2017,"Terrible service,Rude,Not focused on there work. We got there at 5.00 and did not get seated till 6.00 and did not get or food till 7.30."
Remy M.,"Berkeley, CA",0,32,2,5.0,10/1/2017,"Thank's Scott, for the V.I.P. treatment you provided Saturday night! We had a nice dinning experience, as well as the time, we spent @the bar (Aloura-makes terrific cocktails)."
MB E.,"San Francisco, CA",278,8,,5.0,6/14/2017,"Could not have asked for a more surprisingly wonderful casual dinner after a long afternoon of errands. All because of SCOTT! Scott, you're the best. So attentive and always going the extra mile - found me the balsamic vinegar I was looking for even after someone else had said they were out and brought us warm wet napkins after our meal. We will most certainly be back :)"
Tans R.,"Petaluma, CA",4,132,4,4.0,8/14/2017,"My husband and I were coming back from IKEA in Emeryville and were starving. We looked on YELP and were like Yes lets do it! We arrived here on a Sunday night a little after 8pm. We had a 10 minute wait and was seated with Michelle. This older loving gal was fantastic! Super jazzed to be working there, went over some of her favorites and was fantastic on refills! We loved her! She knew that menu very well! We went with the Shepard's Pie, which my husband says was fantastic! I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club, it did not disappoint. Bacon was crispy and avocado was fresh!! I had the Flavored Iced Tea and it was amazing. I must of had 3 refills from poor Michelle. But she had a smile the whole time!! When it came to dessert we really couldn't decide, so we went with 3 slices of Cheesecake! We ordered the Snickers, Reese's and finally the Banana Cream. OMG all were fantastic but my favorite was the Banana Cream, best I have ever had. I can't wait to go back and try more! This place rocks! Thanks for Michelle for your awesome service! The only thing I would say that needs better attention was the bathroom, it was dirty. Toliet paper, paper towels and seat covers all over. It had rusty hinges  on the doors, it needs to be looked at ASAP. If I had gone to the bathroom first I may not have eaten there. That's the only reason they are getting 4 stars and not 5. I did let the front desk know and they said they will take care of it and that they were sorry. Which was nice. I watched one of the hostesses walk to the restroom very briskly after my comment.  We will be back and I will check the bathroom first!"
George R.,"Windsor, CA",1,22,28,4.0,11/26/2016,We stop in every time we go south of Novato. We love the atmosphere and the complimentary bread. I usually get the Cuban sandwich (the best I've ever had) this time I ate the chicken Madera and I could not stop it was great. My daughter had the chicken Romano and the wife had the chicken Bellagio. We always take a few slices of cheese cake to go. We never have a bad meal there.
V A.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/3/2016,Food didn't taste good. Service was too late!!!.  They made a mistake in our order too. Shitt place. Do not recommend!
Maelani L.,"Mill Valley, CA",49,62,67,3.0,9/24/2016,The food is good but you have to wait at lease 30 minutes for a table. If you are on a diet don't come here. I try to avoid this place unless I really have a craving for fattening food.
Linda X.,"San Francisco, CA",337,500,640,4.0,12/13/2015,I usually don't eat at many chain restaurants but The Cheesecake Factory is pretty solid. The service was friendly and the food was good quality. The menu was enormous it's hard to decide what to order. We got the buffalo blasts appetizer which was chicken and cheese stuffed in a fried wrapper ($10). It was perfectly crispy and delicious. I got the steak diane ($20) that had a flavorful mushroom sauce and creamy mashed potatoes. I wasn't as big of a fan of the steak. For dessert I got the lemon meringue cheesecake ($7). I really liked it - very rich and sweet and definitely enough to share with someone.
Raquel B.,"Oakland, CA",6,20,2,5.0,8/30/2017,"This location is probably my favorite at of all the Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Area.  I met a friend for lunch the other day, and we sat outside.  Scott, was our waiter.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls, and I had the skinnylicious protein burger.  The food was delicious, and the service we received was impeccable!  I will definitely be back, and request to be seated in Scott's area."
Katherina C.,"San Francisco, CA",21,8,27,3.0,12/16/2015,I ordered chicken Marcela and in my first bite I got wire from the kitchen scrubbers  They never brought the bread and butter until after we ate our lunch even after asking twice I asked for plain ice tea twice and kept getting tropical fruit ice tea  Not a good experience today  Now I'm still waiting on my check so I can leave and its no where to be seen :(
Dave B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,1,,1.0,9/5/2017,"This place is skipping putting the more expensive items in the dishes. My wife ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. It came without the chicken. She noticed it and pointed it out to the waiter who went and got chicken to add. I ordered the vegan Cobb salad which is supposed to include avocado, almonds and sunflower seeds but didn't. I didn't notice until after I left and I went online to see what ingredients were supposed to have been included. I suggest going elsewhere, if you do decide to visit pay attention to what you aren't getting."
Michelle H.,"Fairfield, CA",0,17,15,1.0,4/19/2017,Food was so full of old grease from lunch and dripping. They offered an alternative but said it would give us the same thing but would have to wait for oil to be switched which would be another wait so we got salad and ended up with frozen lettuce. Then the waitress asked how we'd like to pay for our meals since she her boss
Grace D.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/27/2017,"The reason for the four star review is that I believe there is still room for improvement- the Chicken Madeira left me wanting. The menu claims it to be the most popular chicken dish, however the sweetness in the Madeira sauce just didn't do it for me. But the Ahi Tartare and drinks were phenomenal. With that said, the overall culinary experience was great! The staff and customer service throughout our experience were all wonderful, but our server Scott stood above them all. His sense of humor was matched with his professional attentiveness and dedication to our great experience. Thank you Scott! We will be back again."
Jeannie T.,"Oakland, CA",90,226,913,4.0,2/9/2016,"Came by to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I came with a group of 7 people. It wasn't as busy since it was a Monday so we only had to wait a few minutes for them to push some tables together for us. Our server, I believe his name was Theo, was on the younger side so it was easy for our table to joke around with him. We started with the fried calamari, avocado eggrolls, firecracker salmon, and buffalo wings. The fried clamari is always good, especially when they serve them with the tentacles, my favorite part. It had a light batter and was cooked well. The avocado eggrolls are also a must. I prefer the avocado eggrolls from Cheesecake Factory over the ones from CPK. The perfect amount of avocado with bits of sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro, perfectly fried up in a crisp wrapper. It comes with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Kinda weird but when paired together, it works. The firecracker salmon was a new appetizer that I'd never tried. It's salmon rolled in spinach and fried in a crisp wrapper. I thought it was pretty good. And the buffalo wings had a nice crunch. It had nice meaty pieces but wasn't overly dry. The crust wasn't too heavy and it was executed well. The crust stayed put with the chicken when you bit into it. Definitely my kind of chicken wing, though I'm more of drumstick person. As far as entrees go, I really should've shared a dish because I was so full just from the appetizers, but I ended up with the Chinese chicken salad and my boyfriend got the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. The Chinese chicken salad is literally my go to dish whenever I venture out to the Cheesecake Factory. It never disappoints and I love the dressing. It's the perfect a amount of tang with a crunch from the rice noodles, almonds, and crisp wontons.  I also tried the Farfalle that my boyfriend ordered. It's actually really good. It's bow-tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce. The roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce was what made the dish perfect. But the cream sauce is a bit on the heavy side, so it's difficult to take in if you've already downed 2 mai tai's like my boyfriend and guy friends were doing. Especially before you've even eaten anything. So we ended up taking that to go.  For dessert, we asked Theo to surprise us because everything looked so good and we couldn't decide on which cheesecake to order. What came out was a s'mores cheesecake and it was the bomb. It was like a heaven on a plate with melted marshmallows, ice cream, and graham crackers. It's so good. You have to try it.  The only small tid bit that I had was that the bread was a bit hard when they brought it out. Almost as if they gave us leftover bread that had been sitting out but was just warmed up to hide the fact that it wasn't fresh. But all of our appetizers made up for it. So it wasn't that big of a deal."
Guy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,,2.0,6/20/2017,First visit to a Cheesecake Factory. Went with my wife. The restaurant seemed overly air conditioned to me. Service was a bit slow possibly because my wife required gluten free food. I ordered an Oriental chicken salad. The dressing was overly sweet for my taste. The greens were soggy and not especially fresh. My wife had an omelette with spinach and feta. She didn't think it was particularly tasty. Our waitress was pleasant but overall not a particularly good eating experience.
Jennifer L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",14,89,4,1.0,11/4/2015,"The food was great but the service that my boyfriend and I experienced was HORRIBLE!! Our server was Stanley K. We waited 10 minutes for our check after we asked. Right when I saw him approaching, I reached for my wallet. I was expecting him to set it on the table and say ""I'll be back for the check in just a moment."" Instead he said ""I'll take that from you now"" before I even had the chance to look at the bill. Also, not even once did he checked up on us to see if our food was okay or if my boyfriend wanted a refill. San Francisco over Corte Madera any day. I would rather drive an extra 15 minutes on top of the 45 minute drive from where I live for an at home experience in a restaurant rather than feeling like a burden and rushed! Cheesecake Factory management, please retrain Stanley!"
Sher R.,"Marin County, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/6/2017,"Something for everyone. Except for the loudness of the place- it is a great place for the family with members of all ages. I love the skinny menu - helps to save calories for the wonderful desserts lol. No really, I like NY cheesecake so we order the sundaes. We have been known to have the sundae for dinner! The chocolate cake with ice cream is the best BIG dessert in Marin since there isn't a Farrell's or Max's. I am not talking about delicate desserts - this is a celebration dessert. It is worth it to get the extra hot fudge. And all the food is great. And the service is always spot on - quick refills of the humongous ice teas, soda's, etc. The appetizers are so great that if the idea of a meal bores you - just get a bunch of the wonderful appetizers ( if you like artichokes and they are making them - GET IT. And to manage the noise - ask for a booth in the back. Oh yes, if you have an adorable dog like we do ( Zoie the Bassett) enjoy your meal outside. You won't be sorry."
