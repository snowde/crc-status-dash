The Hungry B.,"Plano, TX",0,3,1,4.0,12/13/2017,"The best mozzarella flatbread! Ok so now that I have that out of system let me deep dive into the actual review for The Cheesecake Factory! Saturday night was the first time I visited this oh-so-famous restaurant chain and we were greeted by 50 odd people waiting their turn (at 9 pm on a Saturday) The wait was 1.5 hour and we decided to sit at the bar instead. After a 30 minute (excruciating) wait we finally found some seating at the bar and impatiently ordered some water and bread. By this time we were starving and decided to order our appetizer and entree together Appetizer- Fresh Basil, tomato and cheese flatbread  Entree- Louisiana chicken pasta, no chicken and substituted mushroom with sundried tomato (Dietary restriction- Vegetarian husband) As the first statement of the review says, the flatbread was to die for! The best one we ever tried! The pasta was delicious, specially when we added with thesundried tomato! There are few things we did want to try,  - Long Island iced tea- which my husband said was epic! - Cheesecake!- which I had no room for at the end of my meal Nevertheless, I have previous tried the Godiva and red velvet cheesecake takeouts and they are delicious! Goes without saying the food is brilliant, but I did take one star off for the long wait and for the restaurant not accepting prior reservations (previously tried on multiple occasions)"
Unhappy C.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2017,Pathetic. Waited 30 minutes on hold before I could even place an order to go.  Eventually went with curbside pickup and the food was cold and wasn't even the correct order.  Waste of money. Waste of time. This is going in the garbage and I'm ordering Taco Bell. At least I know I'll be satisfied and even if I'm not I only spent $5.00 and not $50.
Randall R.,"Sachse, TX",216,257,62,4.0,12/9/2017,"I never have complaints here.  They have a multitude of well prepared standards.  TCF is generally not thought as a super-healthy alternative, and that's a shame, because one really knocks my socks off - the vegan cobb.  That name is a bit of an oxymoron, because it is not a cobb salad - no egg, no bacon, no blue cheese, no chicken, but it;s the best vegan salad in Dallas.  Loads of healthy grains, nuts, seeds and fresh vegetables - they really do it up right. Food: 4 stars Cost is a  bit of an issue on some items.  While that vegan cobb is a steal at $12.50, this is not where I would come for a $28.50 ribeye, a $20.50 steak diane, or a $6.95 side of asparagus, but that's always an issue with menus this large.  It's tough to be all things to all people. Price: 3 stars The setting is fine, maybe a notch below the aforementioned upscale price point.  Atmosphere: 3 stars The waitstaff is as professional as you would expect.  They know the menu and they know how to treat customers - very professional Service: 4 stars I'll average up, because the restroom was very clean, and will return for that awesome vegan cobb. Overall: 4 stars"
Jeff B.,"Plano, TX",7,116,712,3.0,12/24/2017,"Thankful to find a short wait here on Christmas Eve after we gave up a 7:15pm reservation at Benihana because they were running an hour behind on reservations.  Friendly service, awesome fresh bread, plentiful food and a bustling atmosphere. The only negative here was that the floors are slippery everywhere, as are the menus, leaving you feeling like there's a thin film on both. The table seemed to have the same residue. Not sure what they clean with but even our server acknowledged that people have slipped or come close to it. I plan to catch the manager on the way out to at least pass on the concern. Otherwise, Cheesecake Factory is a dependable spot for a great meal, super delicious dessert and lotsa leftovers!"
Marcie B.,"Garland, TX",8,311,294,4.0,10/5/2017,"My family had never been to cheesecake factory to eat. I have been several times for cheesecake only, but never dinner.  The wait was about 30 minutes on a Sunday night for 4. Btw, Sunday night is apparently birthday night for all you grinches.  (I say this because I am one. Enough with the singing for your bday, you're 30.)  I ordered the Santa fe salad, husband ordered the parmesan crusted chicken, and rest of the group ordered the pasta and meatloaf. Everybody was pleased with theirs.  Note, the portion sizes are huge. You can EASILY share. The only thing not shareable was the pasta. I could have made 3 meals out of my salad.  Of course we ended with cheesecake which is always amazing.  It's not some place I'd go all the time, but it was solid and a new experience."
Lisa J.,"Garland, TX",0,11,,4.0,1/3/2018,"Came here a couple of years ago, maybe 5 or more years and had a horrible experience with a white waitress that made it loud and clear that she didnt want to serve ""black people."" She left from ours and served whites only. Another waitress was given to us...but honestly that should be a reason to terminate someone. It greatly improved this time I went it was booming with business and they handled it well. It seemed like the racist were finally gone! Food given out in a timely manner, very delicious, wonderful staff will be returning to this location when I visit Dallas again"
Kevin S.,"Dallas, TX",27,179,39,3.0,11/2/2017,"This is the cheesecake factory and if you've been there before, you know that everything here is usually pretty darn good, on the food and dessert menu. Everything has been consistent year after year that I've gone. I actually prefer going to the one up in Allen at Watters Creek. This location gets busy. I went on a weeknight at about 630 and trying to find a place to park was ridiculous. The wait inside was about 30 minutes, well that's what they told us, it ended up being about 45 minutes.  I don't know if they take reservations, but I honestly would not go to this place on a Friday, Saturday evening and probably would try to stay away from it Saturday and Sunday during brunch and lunch hours. Not because of the food or anything, just because of the parking and the wait situation. I've never had an issue with service at this location.  But, like I said, the food is always good here, it's consistent and I know I need to try more things other than the meatloaf dinner, shepherds pie and the big burrito!"
Leonie S.,"Richardson, TX",1,15,4,2.0,1/2/2018,"Tonight was disappointing for my family. We had a party of 12...I thought with such a big group, there would have been more than 1 wait staff. The food was tasty, but lukewarm. My 2nd margarita came out late...it wasn't like it was super busy.  My mother told the waitress her food was not even warm and she said she was going to let the manager know.  Nothing came from that."
Morgan M.,"Heartland, TX",238,2,,5.0,1/5/2018,"Tonight, I ordered food through the curbside pickup option at Cheesecake Factory and had a WONDERFUL experience! I placed my order, arrived & parked at the front, and was greeted by a sweet waitress named Latrece. My food was brought out promptly and was checked in front of me! Overall, awesome food & awesome experience!!"
Kimberly S.,"Plano, TX",0,14,4,2.0,12/7/2017,"Lately the food has been a disappointment.   The chicken in my chipotle chicken pasta was rubbery and barely warm.   It's like the entire plate of items were cooked at different temperatures. Though the service was good, I just think there are better places to eat with comparable prices.  I typically have no issues but my last few visits are either hit or miss (no middle ground) and  after today I'm afraid I'm not ready return here anytime soon. I normally come here for the chicken dishes and pastas.  The last few entrees were off in seasoning.  The dishes are not hot, as if it sat for a while before they delivered it.  The service is acceptable given how busy they can become, but a poor quality meal is unacceptable. Perhaps, stricter management in the kitchen. I also sent this complaint to the restaurant directly and I got a return call from Mike...I'm not confident that any changes will be implemented and quite leery about going back."
Max D.,"Dallas, TX",459,98,1203,1.0,5/13/2017,"One of the worst dining experiences i have ever had. First off i just want to say i was always a fan of cheesecake factory, large menu with good food and delicious cheesecake. I also rarely give one stars for most of my reviews but this was truly a one star experience.  Me and my gf stopped by after shopping at northpark mall nearby. The wait was about 30 mins or so even though we were past lunch hour stopping by around 2:30. We figured as much since its mother's day tomorrow. When we were seated the waiter was super short with us and obviously was in a rush since when we asked to order our food after giving our drinks order he said only drinks right now since he needs to get drink orders to his other tables first. Ok thats understandable.  I should have known things would go downhill when i received my drink order of a Belvedere on the rocks with a lime. The waiter got it wrong and it came back completely full and totally watered down not what i was expecting when i just wanted a shot on the rocks pretty much. I didnt complain since they were busy and didnt want to wait for another drink. Then the food eventually came and my gf got a sante fe salad and i got a four cheese pasta with chicken. Everything was great until i went for a bite of my pasta when i noticed a hair in it. That pretty much completely ruined my appetite right there.  We notified the waiter who brought the manager over who was truly sorry and offered to remake it which we said okay to. He also offered a complimentary salad or soup which we rejected. I had a couple bites of the remade pasta but just lost my appetite at that point. They eventually comped the pasta portion of the meal after my gf asked about it. They probably should have comped the whole meal. The waiter wasn't apologetic at all. The manager was and did say they are supposed to wear hairnets in the kitchen and he was truly sorry.  Unfortunately i still need to rate this 1 star. Long wait for a disappointing drink they messed up, hair in my pasta and very unfriendly service."
Emily M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",23,120,88,5.0,10/14/2017,"Everytime I come here it is excellently consistent.  Even walking in at 7:30pm.on a Saturday with no reservations we were seated within 25 mins.  The food was spectacular and the drinks were top notch. We ordered almost the entire appetizer menu, some good, some bad."
Daisy B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",59,8,3,1.0,12/12/2017,"How do I begin,  Came to dinner with my sister and we ordered our main Entree, waiting a long time. Now usually they bring bread out to us or at least that's what we thought. We asked the woman who brought us our food if they usually bring the bread out and she said ""KINDA"" I asked, what do you mean by that? She stated it's only given upon request. This has never happened before, so i was a bit confused. Who knew you had to go to a restaurant and it automatically be your job to ask them to give you bread???? Thought that was just common courtesy but guess not anymore!!"
Nikki W.,"Dallas, TX",477,116,34,3.0,8/24/2017,"You know what you're gonna get at Cheesecake Factory. Consistent, standard fare. The only thing that really varies is customer service and st this location, honestly, it's so-so..."
Chuck K.,"Dallas, TX",83,152,208,4.0,11/11/2017,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 Stars tonight is because of the atrocious parking situation, and the uber long wait. However, I realize that's not really their fault, they're just very popular. Anyway, I must brag about the wait staff. Lauren H. was absolutely fantastic. We came with a party of 12, celebrating my daughter's birthday. Of those 12, 9 were teenage girls. Can you imagine serving 9 teenage girls? And of course they all ordered this, that and the other special requests, ate three bites, and then needed take-home bags. There was absolutely nothing Lauren could have done better. Attentive, expedient, knew the menu inside and out, and all with a smile. It was a wonderful dining experience."
Alexis R.,"Garland, TX",0,6,1,1.0,1/9/2018,"Service was horrible. Not to mention we went to this restaurant to celebrate my mothers and aunts birthdays before I head back to college. There was a 30-40 minute wait for a party of 8 which was not that bad, but when we got to the table she did not give us any specialities , no soup of the day, did not even introduce herself. She did not tell us they were out of their most popular bread until 20 minutes after we were seated. Our waiter took about 20 minutes to bring back a cookies and cream milkshake minutes before the entree was brought out. My mother wanted to order an appetizer before her entree and there were no chicken tacitos. They did not have what my mom wanted to order. Unfortunately, my poor mother finally complained about the horrible service we were receiving to the manager on duty... she was not pleased with her dinner on her birthday at this location and we will not ever be returning here ever again. Not to mention, the chipotle pasta there was not great either. Only good thing about this night was that the manager found another waitress who turned everything upside down and ended up making the night somewhat of a good night. Thanks Kenzie for all of your help and for trying to please my mother and aunt on this special day.  Very unhappy."
Yolanda H.,"Plano, TX",141,104,425,3.0,3/22/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a decent option for a team lunch. The menu is large so it is likely there is something on the menu to address finicky to hearty eaters. I highly suggest that if you are pressed for time with a large party, then you encourage your crew to check out the menu online before coming to the restaurant. As most visitors would say, the portions are large, even for a lunch menu. I would say the servings are in line with the price points. My lunch menu cobb salad was enough for two meals. In my opinion, after years of trying some of this and some of that in the menu, the salads are the most consistent menu items. But let's be honest, the place is known for cheesecake, and lots of it. If you are too stuffed after your meal, then cheesecake to-go is an option. Some of my my favs are Vanilla Bean, Key Lime and Lemon Raspberry."
Emily J.,"Dallas, TX",31,92,2,4.0,10/19/2017,We actually ate here for brunch. I had some chicken and waffle and egg concoction. My fault for not requesting no runny eggs. I should have read the entire description. Other than that the food was great. The other person had sweet and sour chicken and absolutely loved it. Cheesecake of course was amazing for all 3 of us dining this day. I don't give 5 stars because the service was less than I expected. Our waiter seemed like he was very busy yet the restaurant was not full and we never even got drink refills. We didn't see him much so ordered our cheesecake to go at the counter. Other than that will go back.
WaNesha J.,"Frisco, TX",254,104,384,2.0,5/29/2017,I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants but I was drug here by a relative. Years ago I used to come here for lunch or a slice of cheese cake but I think that my taste buds have evolved and now the food taste less that mediocre and for the price I know a thousand places that I would rather give my money. So I see now they have small plates. I ordered the toquitos and this bacon grilled cheese. The toquitos amounted to 2 tasteless deep fried rolls of flour tortillas laying in a puddle of salsa. Honestly I don't want to spend my time reviewing this establishment because the cheese cake was even disappointing
C. D.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,3,1.0,12/16/2017,"Absolutely the worst dining experience on my daughters birthday a few days ago. Service was terrible, the waitress kept disappearing, about to choke on the bread because drinks weren't being refilled. My food came out cold, once it was brought back, it was still only lukewarm. Even though my daughter was wearing a crown and had massive balloons, she didnt even offer to sing happy birthday until we brought it up and when she brought her cheesecake (after getting the order wrong at first) she came and sang the driest happy birth I've ever heard...by herself (no other servers, as other tables had done that night). Brian, one of the MODs was useless as well."
Valarie C.,"Dallas, TX",1,18,1,5.0,12/18/2017,"This review is for Thomas J the bartender, he's super attentive and adept! We ate at the bar and he noticed our server mentioning that they were out of basil...he asked a server to go find some and she did (because what is a margarita pizza w/o basil) The manager was very apologetic and made things right! Go to the Cheesecake Factory and eat at bar, Thomas J will take good care of you!"
Jennifer A.,"Acworth, GA",45,9,2,4.0,11/6/2017,"I had an excellent experience at this Cheesecake Factory! I ordered the shepherd's pie, and it was yummy! The portions were EXTRA large, so be ready for leftovers!"
Ray F.,"Dallas, TX",78,414,158,4.0,4/15/2017,"A Friday night with a group of 7 at 7 PM at a place most of us had never been.   Me and my date got there 45 minutes early to get on the list and had a drink at the bar.  Kind of surprised for the cost, but the atmosphere was nice. As the rest showed up early, our pager went off and they had a circular booth for us which was way too small.  So back on the list we went and tried to hide in the bar to get out of everyone's way.  About 10 minutes later, we had a table. The menu and all of the additional inserts requires more than a few minutes to a new patron to read. I can only imagine how complicated the kitchen must be. The wait staff was great and got most of everything right. She brought bread and butter which with 7 hungry people, did not last long.  I ordered the mini crab cakes and a small garden salad to start.  Both were right temperature and tasty.  Timing was good.   My main course was the Americana Burger.  It was juicy, flavorful and huge!  The fries were hot and tasty.  My only complaint was the tiny container of ketchup. Seriously, I spent over $80 on a meal for 2 and they skimp on ketchup?  The wait staff brought more when I asked. The only problems from the rest of our group was a mix up on a salad being ordered and a steak not as ordered. All enjoyed their meal and experience. The chocolate cheesecake was good."
Bessy G.,"Wylie, TX",99,51,23,5.0,5/8/2017,Excellent! My waitress went above and beyond to make sure we felt comfortable and gave us plenty of choices/ suggestions since we didn't know what to order! We tried  the avocado rolls and Cajun pasta with chicken or something like that lol Really good! You can't go to Cheesecake Factory n not try their dessert.... helloooo....? Of course I got me cheesecake Godiva chocolate mmm rich chocolate smooth sweet yup I liked it. Will definitely be back soon!!!
Ai C.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,18,3,2.0,12/8/2017,Was really disappointed on how my take out order was packaged up. The bananas in my cheese cake were soggy and brown making the crust and the bottom of my cheesecake wet. Also I live 5 mins away and my food was not even like warm so I wonder how long it sat there before it was given to me. We just moved to Dallas and was looking for comfort food. Really disappointed on tonight's meal.
Robbie D.,"Oak Lawn, Dallas, TX",716,69,280,3.0,2/13/2017,"Coming to Cheesecake Factory has always been a treat, especially after the movies or shopping at North park.  I always enjoy coming here as the the atmosphere is always inviting and of-course  fantastic cheesecake that they come to know for.  My experience on Friday evening is mixture of good and bad. I rarely ever post anything negative but rather, constructive so here it goes... As we entered the restaurant and upon visiting the host desk to add our name to the wait list, we were quoted 10 minutes. During our short wait, I casually browsed the robust cheesecake selection and made mental notes of what I'd like to order for my dessert. Our host/Hostess called our name and then sat us. As we were guided to our table, I already made assumptions on the fate of our evening which would likely be excellent based on previous visits at other notable locations . I've been to Cheesecake Factory in Oahu Hawaii, Beverly Hills California, Miami Florida and of course Texas.  As we were seated, our server arrived and greeted us. He asked to take our drink order and and checked to see if we'd like to start our evening with any appetizers. The evening were off to a good start ! After a bit of a wait, he arrived with our drinks and took our dinner order. As we relaxed and chatted, I noticed, where's our bread? and where is the coffee to my cream? All of which I asked for earlier when we first arrived and that was 15-20 minutes ago. Thankfully, the cream and the bread finally arrived but now the sweetener is missing so my coffee is now cold and flat. Unsure at this point to ask for anything else as there always seems to be a seven to ten minute delay. As I attempted to partake on the bread and butter, I encountered another issue, which was our cutlery. My knife by appearance looked unwashed and in my opinion unsanitary to placed at any table let alone an established restaurant of this caliber. I took a knife at the unseated table next to us hoping it's cleaned and polished to no avail, so the fork was the next best thing. Again, at this point not confident any requests would be well executed. Our dishes arrived, I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp  and it was just as magnificent as I recalled at other locations. The sauce was light but was big in flavor. I particularly enjoyed the subtle hints of peanuts, curry and oriental spices which accented the chicken and the shrimp nicely. Our guests receive their entrees as well and we were a happy table. From this point on it was smooth sailing. Our entrees were delicious and our drinks were kept full for the duration which is a nice reprieve from the first half of our visit.  For dessert, we indulged on the Tiramisu cheesecake which was light by cheesecake standard but big on tiramisu flavor. There were noticeable hints of cocoa, mascarpone cheese and cinnamon. I could of had two although one was perfect for sharing!  Overall assessment: clean your forks and knifes, it doesn't set a good precedent for your guests when they are about to spend 25-30$ on dinner and have dirty cutlery.  If someone ask for coffee and it's accompaniment, everything should be delivered as such and in unison. That said, the beautiful decor, consistency in the food quality and of course the cheesecake selections are all great attributes!"
Nicole S.,"University Park, Dallas, TX",200,67,56,4.0,3/6/2017,"Came to this location, making it the first time I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, and I'm not sure why the reviews aren't very good! It is pricey, but the portions are huge. I haven't gotten such big portions of food at any restaurant in a really long time. I got the Chicken Bellagio and the pasta part is a tiny bit oily, but overall it is delicious. I love the arugula and prosciutto! I also got the strawberry cheesecake and tried some at home and of course it's good as well. Our server, Steve, was excellent and so nice, he deserves a shoutout. Parking is a little difficult."
Alissa M.,"Far North Dallas, Dallas, TX",44,9,2,4.0,12/4/2017,"We had a new server and he was great! The service was quick and friendly. The food was pretty good I recommend trying the chickpea and goat cheese salad it's really good! My friend did not like the beef stew and they brought her something else so fast, took the beef stew off the tab, the manager came to apologize and ask what she didn't like so they could make changes and gave us a free slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience. Overall it was a good experience!"
Jamie W.,"Whitehouse, TX",31,50,83,4.0,7/28/2017,I've eaten here twice in the past two weeks. Primarily its close to my hotel and they have good food.  I've eaten here for lunch and have come in at night and gotten food to go. Both were great experiences. My daughter got the cheeseburger and it was cooked as requested. Cheesecake for days!  The food comes on large portions. If you go to this page and click on menu their is picture of nearly every item so you can see what it looks like professionally. Most platters are shareable as well. We will be back!
Daisy D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,,1.0,12/28/2017,"We did a pickup order (after waiting on hold for 7+ minutes and hanging up and calling back.) Here's a recommendation: if you have any food allergy, go somewhere else. The girl on the phone insisted my order should be gluten-free taking off one ingredient. What I received was a box of oily plain chips and all my toppings to the side. Ordered a burger that was overly salty and missing ingredients. Overall inedible: I learned my lesson, and won't be back."
Brenna R.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/24/2017,"I called three times tonight to put in a to go order.... not late either, probably 8:45. They dropped me once, put me on hold twice and I never got to place the order. I know I cannot be the only one this has happened to, so if you're busy, hire more people! I know you can afford it with how busy this location can be, it's truly not hard to have good customer service. In a city as big as Dallas I have choices. And I'm not going to go out of my way to choose this place when there are others that will be nicer, especially on Christmas!"
Cynthia C.,"Carrollton, TX",37,635,595,4.0,1/16/2017,"Our sever mentioned that she would be respectful of our time since we were on a lunch break from work. She may have sped up the process a little too fast since she didn't notice the fly in my coworker's water. The bread came out quickly but wasn't hot. I ordered the shimp and sausage pasta from the lunch menu and lemme tell you, those portion sizes are deceiving. I finished all but four rigatonis. My coworker was only able to finish half of her turkey avocado club, and I was very surprised with how packed the sandwich was!"
Melodie S.,"Irving, TX",0,5,,5.0,12/22/2017,"Wish we were able to snap a pic of our food before we ate it. Everything was great, our serve me Deon was on top of it!!! He recommended the friend mac & chz talk about amazing! He helped us choose our dishes and was very attentive."
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,5.0,10/4/2016,"As long as firecracker salmon rolls are on the menu, they will always get five stars from me. That is one awesome appetizer. Just nothing like it around. OMG. It is amazing. The Monti Christal was perfect in everyway. The egg omelet entree was surpurb. Everything was on point. The service was excellent. The atmosphere was wonderful. And the firecracker salmon rolls was kick butt good. Dang."
Ashley M.,"Dallas, TX",179,120,44,1.0,4/14/2017,"I was here a few days ago for happy hour.  At first things were going well.  I sat down at a table by the bar. The place was fairly empty. There was a lot of wait staff just kind of hanging around conversating.      I ordered a cosmo and the Fried Chicken sliders. I was brought out the hamburger sliders. Smh. I was really irritated by this being that I literally hadn't eaten all day. I was not happy with having to wait on them to remake a dish that was put in the system incorrectly.     The waiter argued me down saying that I did not specify which sliders I wanted. But I definitely said fried chicken sliders and I pointed to it on the menu as well. But let's say, his version of the story was correct. If I did not specify which sliders I wanted, why didn't you just ask me which ones I wanted, instead of playing the guessing game?     I called a manager over and the nonchalant look on his face let me know that he didn't think a waiter arguing with me was a big deal. All he did was offer for another waiter to serve us. Even after that,  my date and I ordered another round of drinks and continued to patronize the place. My date still tipped and ordered A Slice of Cheesecake for me to go . But I could not get out of there fast enough!  My blood was boiling.  Worst service and attitudes ever. I guess I will start back going to Grand Lux instead."
Jeff C.,"Dallas, TX",26,18,,2.0,10/1/2017,"I just tried to place a curbside order with The Cheesecake Factory and everything I tried to order was either a ""menu revision"" (as in taken off the menu) or they were out of! Come on! For as much as they charge, they should get their act together!!!!! The food is good provided they decide to offer what you want!!!!! Not paying these prices to have my first, second, and third choices unavailable....I'll go elsewhere."
B A.,"Plano, TX",0,8,,1.0,3/25/2017,"I wish there was a no star for the ridiculous customer service for this place! These people are sick . Please hire more people and train them on how to talk , listen and behave with the customers . You are in business because of customers like us.  Just because you have crowds waiting to be seated, doesn't mean you are doing good business. The cashier - ""Christian D ""according to the receipt threw away the receipt at us are you kidding me ? I have called thrice , three different people at the pick up counter and no body gives a damn to respond. I mean I have been to cheese cake factories all over the states and this place is a let down complete let down! Guys get your house together you are in the hospitality industry for god sake respect and customer service should be your corner stone for business.  I will personally make an effort to tell people not to come here literally coz it's second time for the experience like this!"
Jace H.,"Terrell, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Today 11/9/17. Was the second time that I have been to Cheesecake Factory. In a months time and had horrible service from the elderly gentleman  in the bar area, today we waited 25 min to get water, I went and spoke with the host stand to see if he could get some help and they did nothing. 10 minutes later we decided to leave and I went back to the host stand and explained that we were leaving and then they decided to try and do something about it.  Oct. 19. I went for my bday and, again had the same server. He was rude. Couldn't get our order straight and gave us attitude when we tried to explain our order. He should not have the bar area to himself, he cannot handle the fast pace of the bar area alone.  I enjoy this place very much and go at least 3-4 time a month or more but  two times is unacceptable unfortunately I will not be returning. Hope everyone who goes there has a better experience."
Randy H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",328,3,1,5.0,6/25/2017,I'm never disappointed when I come here to dine. Service and the food are truly exceptional. This is by far my favorite place to eat!
Andie F.,"Danville, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Terrible service. Terrible food.  This location must be under new management as it used to be decent.  Forgot about my drink in the bar. Asked for crispy fries, they were undercooked.  Forgot about blue cheese.  Had to 'make fresh'. And since when does blue cheese have garlic?  Nachos were horrible. Not melted cheese on top and some kind of nasty cheese sauce on the bottom.  Red sauce on top tasted terrible.  Chocolate cake was presented broken and tasted dry.  We frequented Cheesecake Factory.  Will not be returning."
