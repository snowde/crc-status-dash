Ash B.,"Plano, TX",38,27,,4.0,7/20/2013,"I try not to review chain restaurant but this time I actually enjoyed. I ordered the salmon appetizer with cabbage and it was great, tasty fresh and crispy. The main course was good as well (like a glazed chicken with veggie). the prices are a bit high but definitely not over priced.  And the cheesecake hmm delicious! big piece of strawberry cheesecake.... The service was great, the waiter was nice and made sure we got all we need. Why four stars then...? it's still a big chain like a factory of food... try to give your business to a small, local, family owned business...."
Abhimanyu R.,"Dallas, TX",78,8,1,3.0,8/21/2015,I have been here multiple times and every time I loved their food :) If you really want to taste a good Italian meal in budget I would suggest this place hands down. The staff is ok and friendly but always seems little busy even when place is not crowded. They provide free and unlimited bread with butter just ask the server. Don't try the white bread it's really hard (you can hit a person with that :P) brown bread is okay if it is warm. Main course is nice and serving portion is pretty satisfying my personal favourite is Farfalle With Chicken And Roasted Garlic. Not a place if you planning to take your lady on a date because of high crowd almost all the time.

Kevin G.,"Dallas, TX",94,112,16,1.0,6/14/2013,"We hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, but tonight we needed a place that had dessert and was open late. My wife and I took my Mom to dinner, and after we dropped her at home, we both realized we wanted something sweet. The only problem was that it was 10pm, so a lot of places would be closed or closing. Someone mentioned Cheesecake Factory, the Maps app on my phone said they were open until after midnight, so off we went. No wait on arrival, which was good. Asked for a table, no problem. Found the desserts on page 467 of the menu, good to go. So far, the only issue is they don't have pie. No pie? The waiter shows up, gets a drink order, starts going through specials, and my wife says, ""I think we're just having dessert."" He wanders off to get the drinks. Behind me, I hear an angry female voice whisper, ""They're just having dessert?"" This made me feel uncomfortable, since I don't like strangers angry at me, but out of the corner of my eye, I noticed she was carrying a tray with two whole pieces of bread, so she was probably just overworked. I hope she found a more worthy table to receive her bread. We ordered ""just dessert"" (our just desserts?) Next, our drinks arrived. Out of the corner of my other eye, I noticed something on the end of the table. Our check. Drinks, check, food.  Has the serving order changed? I ordered alcohol, and I'm not a small person, and many people can tell I'm Irish - wouldn't you leave that tab open? It's interesting how a piece of paper in a plastic sheath can ruin an otherwise fine piece of chocolate cake. ""Fine"" as in tasty, large and slightly over-priced. So, I see no need to go back. If you get he bum's rush out of a place for just ordering dessert when the name of the place contains ""cheesecake"", I don't need to visit any longer. Ironically, it took forever for the waiter to notice my credit card so we could pay and make room for real customers. If you want to be known for desserts, perhaps you should warn staff that some customers will come in to order it. The last time I received a check before my order was in a New York diner after midnight. We got my food, the check and then my wife's food. So, that was slightly better than tonight. Plus, the diner had some charm."
Amy E.,"Dallas, TX",65,320,44,1.0,11/26/2011,"Fiance's parents are in town for the weekend and invited us to dinner last night.  Other family members coming decided on Cheesecake Factory since it was close to their hotel, so off we went. Service was average at best.   The food was not good.  Fiance's crispy beef was an exception to that.  I forgot why I stopped going to the Cheesecake Factory to begin with, and now I remember why.  Paying $17 for an entire box of spaghetti and 2 pounded-flat chicken breasts is ridiculous.  No one needs an entire box of spaghetti on their plate.  Rather, why don't you put some veggies or something else of actual substance on it?  Pasta costs 99 cents to make, two chicken breasts set you back about $5... so why does this cost $17? Pasta was exceptionally salty (found out from his mom afterward that hers was the same), but the worst was glancing down at my plate and seeing a lovely dark hair beneath one of the chicken breasts.  If you can't wear hair nets, I really don't want to know what else you are not doing when preparing my food.   We won't be back again."
Penny N.,"Crystal Lake, IL",4,16,5,5.0,6/4/2015,Amazing food!! The bread was wonderful and I had the carbonara. Hubby had the pizza. Loved the cheesecake and our server was excellent! They know how to treat their customers!!
Cody C.,"Stephenville, TX",3,3,,4.0,5/31/2015,Cheesecake and service were incredible as always. Got seated for 2 within minutes. The only downside was my wives water had some stuff floating in it. But other than that it was superb.
Anna S.,"Cedar Hill, TX",18,34,3,5.0,3/25/2015,"The hostess was friendly and seated us immediately. Our server, Jacob D., has been so polite and helpful. He was patient and helpful as we couldn't decide what to order. He took care of us very well and contributed to our wonderful experience. The salmon genevese was the best salmon I've ever had, and the lemon meringue was amazing!"
Peter H.,"Richardson, TX",567,453,522,3.0,1/9/2012,"How in the world do you ever decide on what to get here when there's like 21209 different items on the menu? Cheesecake Factory is like how H&M is for clothes, get upscale items for a lower price.  It's actually a great concept.  During this visit, i ordered the Chicken Carbonara while the boo got the Cajun Jambalaya pasta.  Of course they never skimp on their portions, so value is always guaranteed.  Each pasta was cooked nice and had plenty of flavor.  We shared the Tiramisu Cheesecake, which was very good.  Come to Cheesecake Factory to get a filling meal and pay less than what you would pay at a restaurant on Mckinney Ave."
Jen W.,"Forney, TX",48,10,3,2.0,5/12/2015,"I just had dinner here with friends while I'm in town. The service was terrible. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks but they sure did keep bringing us bread. An hour into our visit, we finally started getting our food one plate at a time. We got my plate and then waited for 10 minutes for the other two plates. While we waited for the other two plates, I went and asked for a manager. The host said he'd send one over and surprise, surprise, nobody ever came. Then, like magic, our other two plates appeared. We waited forever for to-go boxes and the only time our server was attentive is when it was time for us to pay. What a shock.  the food was good. Like always but the service was completely unsatisfactory. Obnoxiously bad. The Moscow Mules were delicious though. Some good did come from our visit. I gained a new favorite cocktail."
Paul H.,"San Antonio, TX",9,21,12,3.0,2/7/2016,"Saturday, a busy day for this location, that not withstanding it took them over two hours to seat us (a group of nine).  Obligatory bread and butter soon appear, warm bread real butter, very good.  Drinks/appetizers ordered and arrive in reasonable time.  Entrees ordered and arrive in like fashion with the exception of one entree that was ""sent to the wrong table"".  Food presentation was over the top, every entree served drew attention with the occasional oohs and aahs.  I had the grilled fish tacos with black beans and rice.  Tacos were adequate but overstuffed with what was supposed to be marinated onion but seemed to be more like a cole slaw.  They must have been rationing the fish because there was too much filler and not enough fish.  I gotta give our waiter credit, he did pretty good, and gave us separate checks without batting an eyelash.  He was tipped accordingly well.  Overall it was adequate, I would go back maybe at a time when it's a little less busy."
Jessica T.,"Dallas, TX",77,79,70,5.0,11/12/2013,"I attended this location with my work buddies and had a fabulous time. Beautiful, clean, and very inviting. Our waiters were very nice and extremely helpful with our questions about the menu. We all ordered different dishes and we are. Group that loves and I mean loves food and we literally had silence at the table because we loved our entrees so much."
Erin L.,"Upper Greenville, Dallas, TX",39,14,28,2.0,2/17/2015,Only reason I'm giving two stars is their food is really good other than that I'm tired of crappy waiters people that can't remember orders and this place is definitely one of those places.
Eric C.,"Dallas, TX",734,229,449,4.0,8/15/2013,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory?!?  Okay, let's put aside the 4 day wait to get a table, the noise and the Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation's ""sled scene"" ultra slick floors there.  Put all that aside.  No!  Don't think about it and lets just focus on the servers... who are hit or miss.  Crap...I digress.  Okay all that deserves 1-2 stars and if that were all then I probably wouldn't return. No, but seriously, who doesn't like a 47 page menu?  I must confess, I get the same thing most every time, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  Seriously try it.  You'll thank me.  It's a life changing experience and not all that spicy.  My bride gets the Asian lettuce wraps which admittedly are pretty good and my kids get bowtie pasta with alfredo on the kids menu.  I'm not gonna lie, that alfredo they make for the kids is really good!   Don't forget the cheesecake which is akin to the shrimp scene in Forrest Gump.  There are many many many many options.  It makes mouths happy."
Diana D.,"Dallas, TX",150,264,213,1.0,1/26/2011,"Dear Cheesecake Factory Host Staff, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, if you say that it is going to be a 35 minute wait, but you suspect that it will be more than an hour...AND you know the party has two hungry children and it is one of the kid's birthday...just be honest.  Pack up a complimentary slice of cake and send the birthday boy on his way where he will be able to celebrate and eat dinner before 9:30 at night.  Then invite them to come back another time, and the probably will. Sincerely, Done with CF"
Jen T.,"Dallas, TX",131,416,115,4.0,1/20/2015,"Walked in on a Saturday and had to stand by the door they were so packed, luckily it was just my husband and myself which means we get seated fairly quickly. They took us over to the bar area to sit right next to large family. We were not wanting to have a nice lunch sitting in someone's lap so asked for a booth and only had to wait another few minutes for that, so that was nice.  Once seated our waitress was super friendly and took our drink orders. They have special teas which we opted for, it was strawberry and soooo good. They even put sugar on the rim of the glass. We ordered the avocado fries which came with a nice spicy dipping sauce. Our app came out with our meal which stinks a  little because Iike to snack and you can't do that when you have a massive meal in front of you. I ordered a chicken dish that I can't recall the name of, and my husband ordered a steak dish. I wish I would have ordered the steak because it was amazing, it was medium rare and cooked to perfection. Even his mashed  potatoes were perfect. All in all I got the wrong meal, mine wasn't bad it just wasn't steak.  We ordered the red velvet  cheesecake. It was pretty tasty, I don't know why I was expecting to be awed, wowed, left speechless by cheesecake, but it didn't happen. Good but not slap yo momma good.  Although it was about $60 for our lunch I think we will make this one of our rare expensive outings, at least when we want a good steak."
Regina B.,"Dallas, TX",0,15,1,4.0,3/22/2016,"My Boyfriend and I love the Cheesecake Factory, especially when we can't decide what we are in the mood for. Their HUGE menu has a little bit of everything. We love the Mac and Cheese fried balls as an app. Their salads are also great and portion size is crazy big. Of course we get Cheesecake every time and its to die for. The Chocolate cake is also amazing. Service is usually great and food comes out pretty fast. A great place for the family or birthdays!"
Johnathan D.,"Dallas, TX",4,7,,3.0,10/8/2015,"I took my wife to this location for our 3rdyear anniversary. I called several hours in advance to book a table for two. I specifically asked for a table no where near a bathroom, the kitchen or where there would be foot traffic (like waiters next to a kios). They were very nice over the phone and said no problem we'll take care of it. We arrived at 5:30 and I had forgotten at how refreshing it was in The Cheesecake Factory. It had been probably 10 years since I had been there last. We were seated in the far back next to a giant wall with a great view of the restaurant. I felt really good about the table until only a minute after we sat down we heard pans being dropped on the floor, plates clinking together and orders being yelled loudly. We had been seated only feet away from the kitchen. There were no doors between where people sit and where the kitchen is. The only thing between us was a wall but on both ends of the wall there was a huge area where waiters were walking back n forth and our table was right next to it. I tried to ignore it but after trying to have a conversation with my wife more pans were being dropped in the kitchen and it was so loud I couldn't even carry on a conversation without thinking (what is going on back there?) and my wife agreed. I asked my waiter Michael if we could sit somewhere else. He completely agreed with me that it was so loud and he gave me the option of where I would like to sit. I chose a booth far away from the kitchen and it ended up being a perfect spot. We ordered mixed drinks, some kind of marinated steak (My wife chose it so I forget the name) and their popular fresh strawberry cheesecake which was excellent. I ordered the pineapple Moscow Mule which was an interesting twist on the original Moscow Mule and my wife ordered a drink (forget what it was) but it had rum in it and it was absolutely awful, at least for me. It was pure alcohol with a splash of food coloring (from the taste of it) or something. It had no taste to it except the alcohol. I am not one to complain about an extra shot or two from the bar tender but at $10 a glass and it being a fruit drink it should have a nice flavor to it instead of every time you drink its like taking a straight shot of rum. My wife did order a second one but she agreed with me it was too strong to be a mix drink. We ended up having a great time at the end. The initial bump with giving us a table right next to the kitchen even when I specifically asked not to be took 2 stars away. It is just unacceptable. In fact, they really need to put doors there instead of leaving these giant gaps open. Those kitchens can get so loud I don't see how anyone can enjoy a conversation over a meal sitting at those tables only feet away from the kitchen. Michael was a great waiter. It wasn't his fault we were seated there. What was even more odd was that the restaurant was probably 80% empty because we got there early before the dinner rush and we were still seated at probably the worst table in the entire restaurant. That's what I don't understand."
Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2111,3423,3.0,12/10/2010,"Welcome to a glitzy American cafeteria, sort of like a big box store of gastronomie.  Order nachos, chinese food, or chicken fried chicken and mashed potatoes.    If you have room, share a slice of cheesecake.  Join a gaggle of well dressed Lemings and their families as America enjoys it's obscene and trifling riches.  Enjoy it while it lasts."
Shahbaaz A.,"Richardson, TX",247,108,,5.0,1/13/2015,"I love Cheesecake factory! The inside is great and upscale. Their cheesecakes are great and famous( hence the name). Know that a slice of cheesecake no matter what flavor is around 1,000 or more calories X_X Their entrees and appetizers are really good also! I didn't like their cream cheese wontons so much. Their orange chicken isn't special either but so many of their items are really good. Even though some items can be pricey($23) they're huge and can easily be shared by 2 people. Open till midnight also :) I love the complimentary whole wheat bread they serve, better than the white bread in my opinion. Same company as Grand Lux cafe but I like cheesecake factory better."
