Andrew P.,"Wichita Falls, TX",313,47,28,5.0,10/24/2016,Travis our waiter was absolutely amazing! He possibly was the best server I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with! After being seated he took our drink order and got everything right even with our odd requests. He was very attentive amd friendly! He is great with kids also! Our kids loved talking to him! Highly recommend going to this Cheesecake Factory and requesting Travis!
B M.,"Irving, TX",0,13,4,2.0,8/20/2016,"Two stars for the cakes, no offense ! Services extremely mediocre they don't care about the customer standing in front, really order is ready I had to show them that it is ready . Really. ? Please improve customer service"
Polly M.,"Center, TX",45,13,1,5.0,11/5/2016,"Had dinner there on a Saturday night with 4 adults and 4 kids.  We were expecting the worst, right?  After a very short wait we were seated at a large booth comfortable enough for all.  Our server arrived quickly and was very pleasant and efficient.  Appetizers came quickly and our meals were also served in a timely manner.  Plenty of drink refills too.  Of course we ordered desserts, which were amazing.  Everything tasted great.  Food and service were excellent.  Everyone was happy.  Pretty much a miracle."
Eve B.,"Fort Hood, TX",184,376,101,4.0,4/23/2015,On a busy Tuesday night we walked in and was seated quickly. Service was great and the food was wonderful. I had a turkey burger and I was amazed at the flavor of the burger. Need to watch so I don't eat so much bread and butter.  Portions are big and can be shared or half packed up and taken home. To save room for the yummy cheesecake.  Have tired most of them but so far love the red velvet cheesecake.. But so many more to try.
Brandi G.,"Coppell, TX",1,1,4,1.0,5/8/2016,"I called to verify whether they were busy. The hostess who answered replied, incredibly rudely, ""Well, I mean, yeah."" Nothing else. Didn't even get the chance to try this location. Very disappointed."
Brian R.,"Powell, OH",46,12,35,5.0,6/17/2015,"No matter where you go, Cheesecake Factory is there.  Consistently good with a menu that is so expansive everyone can find something they like, Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet. My recommendations are the Mac N Cheese balls, the chicken Madeira and of course cheesecake for dessert.   Cheesecake Factory is loud and full of energy, a great place for parties and birthdays.  Definitely recommended."
Eric C.,"Dallas, TX",0,102,,1.0,4/9/2017,Worst cheesecake ever.  Curbside took over 30 minutes.  Called order in TWO HOURS AHEAD OF TIME to have it ready when I needed it.  Ridiculous!
Diana A.,"Wichita, KS",64,46,11,3.0,9/18/2016,Visited this place for the very first time and it turned out to be less than the commotion my family made out of it. It could have been because of the waitress which did not offer very good service at all. She took for ever to take out orders and on top of that messed up my order and when it came to paying she didn't fix her mistake nor attempted to. Definitely will not return here to this location and I most likely will try another restaurant when going out for similar food.
Malia R.,"Dallas, TX",498,673,1405,2.0,10/20/2014,"I've never been to The Cheesecake Factory and disliked what I ordered.  This was the exception.  The service was just okay But the food was gross! We've been going to The Cheesecake Factory regularly for nearly 10 years now and this was a first.  I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas which must have had 3 cups of salt in it. It was almost inedible.  My daughter had the pasta with marinara sauce, but it was basically pasta with 1 tsp tomato sauce to 2 cups water. The only thing good was the slice of cheesecake. We should have just ate at McDonald's and came here for cheesecake afterward, even THAT would have saved our sodium intakes.  Our server Robert M. was average.  I'll just stick to the location in Frisco from now on."
Nathaniel H.,"Dallas, TX",5,33,72,1.0,10/11/2014,"I walked in and attempted to get a table. The two hostesses had their back to me, talking to three servers, one of which who walked up and saw me, then started talking to the hostess and ignored me. What would have been a couple of expensive drinks and slices of cheesecake turned into a single slice to go. The only helpful person was Carla who served me promptly, prepped my order, and was courteous. The Frisco location is better, but not by much."
Alex D.,"Dallas, TX",0,12,2,1.0,1/7/2017,"I didn't even have to go to the restaurant to have a bad experience, I was out with family and we were trying to see if cheesecake had open spots. We call ahead of time and they rudely say they can't give that info over the phone. So we decide to go there and the wait time was over two hours. A complete waste of time."
Brad D.,"Wylie, TX",41,97,22,5.0,8/1/2016,"We visited on National Cheesecake Day, which might seem like a mistake. The place was absolutely packed at lunch time on a Saturday, but we only waited about 15-20 minutes for a party of two. Service was good given the volume of people in there, and our food still came out in a reasonable amount of time. We had the Key Lime cheesecake and cherry cheesecake after our meal, and brought home a slice of the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake and the salted caramel. Delicious!"
Rhonda G.,"Winona, TX",76,1,,1.0,7/11/2016,"I will NOT recommend nor return to this location.  My husband & I were in from out of town celebrating our anniversary & this place was recommended. We had a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE with the hostess, food & management! The hostess insisted on our party sitting in a booth that was extremely to small for accommodation. We asked to be sat at a table that was open, but the hostess said the table was for a party that checked in after us. I asked to speak with a manager & she walked right passed me & told the hostess to set is at the open table. Once we ordered our food, it wasn't what we expected. My shrimp Alfredo was dry & the shrimp wasn't could fully. My aunt asked for a well done burger which ended up being a raw burger. We asked for the manager & once he came, he never apologized. We WILL NOT return. The only reason they get one star is because, I couldn't post without one."
Kay C.,"Pasadena, TX",1,5,,4.0,9/19/2016,I had decent service and delicious grilled fish tacos. Wasn't to pleased with the low carbs cheese cake thou. Everything is always good here.
Chasity M.,"Dallas, TX",96,10,,1.0,9/17/2016,"Food is always good, but the to-go staff is super rude. I've gone there twice in the last 2 wks, and the staff was off-putting both times. No matter how good the food is, when you're treated poorly, you just don't want to come back."
Jennifer J.,"Dallas, TX",64,272,418,4.0,11/8/2013,"We went to the Cheesecake factory because we had received a $50 gift card from some friends. I had low expectations because I don't normally eat at chain restaurants. I think they are boring. I was pleasantly surprised with our visit.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night so that's pretty normal. But since this place always seems to have a wait, it would be nice if they had a waiting area large enough to accomodate everyone who is waiting.  The hot sourdough bread was very nice to start with. We shared the French country salad. The sweet and salty combo was perfect together.  I had the Morrocan chicken. It was very good and with three chicken breasts I will have two more meals at home. My husband had the cashew chicken. He liked it a lot, but also could only eat a portion of his serving. And that is saying a lot about the size of his meal.  Our waiter Travis was great too!"
Joe B.,"Garland, TX",1,20,1,1.0,9/5/2016,"Every time we've been here, there always seems to be a problem that we don't experience at other Cheesecake locations, be it food, service or atmosphere. A situation demonstrated by other reviewers. This time it was lousy service. The hostess seated us right next to two large noisy parties, one a birthday party. We requested to move 3 booths down and the hostess caught an attitude and flat out refused to allow us to move, claiming no other area was available even though this was a late Sunday night with a sparse crowd. Then we waited. And waited. Aaaand waited. For several minutes we waited for a server that would never appear. I would have tracked down a manager to fix all this but my headache from the noisy people led us to get the hell out of there. Which we did.  This isn't Black Eye Pea prices...it's Cheesecake Factory prices. I don't expect spiteful hostesses or non-existent servers, or seating policies that don't avoid seating guests RIGHT next to a loud birthday bash. It's my money, I'll sit where I damn well please. Which won't be here again. Ever."
Roderick J.,"Rockwall, TX",29,162,25,4.0,11/29/2015,"Nothing but great Cheesecake factory food.  I had the southern fried chicken sliders from the appetizer menu.  Four good sliders, very very good.  Didn't have room for cheesecake, but we took it to go.   :)"
Poxidozz P.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,4.0,9/23/2016,Several food options especially their deserts. I love Salad&Salmon and chocolate cake (can't remember the name). The service was fine on the weekend due to crowed people but overall is good.
Lawrence G.,"Keene, NH",0,70,,4.0,2/27/2017,"We came here after a girls' athletic event, and the girl in our party was about to melt down during our 15-minute wait (blood suger low); most thoughtful host got her an apple juice, and all was well.  Decent cocktails, according to ladies who weren't the DD.  Most of the food was 3-star level, par for this chain.  Service and dessert gave the 4th star here."
