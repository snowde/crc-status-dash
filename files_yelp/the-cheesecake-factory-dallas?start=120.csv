Yolanda M.,"Irving, TX",273,361,307,5.0,8/4/2014,"Cheesecake review only although I have been to this location many times.  National Cheesecake day was half off cheesecake not 1 but 2 days bonus! Also the website said dine-in only but it was offered to-go as well. If you missed it mark it down on your calendar next year July 30th. Cheesecake factory has the largest variety and best tasting cheesecake hands down. Their name says it all, it's consistently good and they never run out. You would think they would run low on some varieties especially near closing time, but they don't.   I enjoyed my cheesecake as always only wished I could have made it earlier for dinner.  If you haven't tried the Red Velvet you should it's awesome but if you need a Chocolate fix I recommend Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake, its brownies, and German chocolate all rolled into one delicious mouthful. I don't you can go wrong with any of their flavors, i'm sure even the low fat and sugar free are good but lets be real and get the full fat, full sugar, full calorie it's not like you eat it everyday."
Samson M.,"Dallas, TX",2,11,12,2.0,9/28/2014,"Greeting and service is exceptional however the food is ok or should I say my choice was bad. I had salmon Genovese with artichoke, green beens and grilled sliced tomato. Salmon Genovese tasted like gasoline, also sliced tomato was burnt badly.  Also, they have really good deserts.... Had red velvet cheese cake, and I can't explain how good it was!!!! I am giving them two stars based on service and once again THE RED VELVET CAKE."
Art V.,"Alamogordo, NM",0,5,1,1.0,4/9/2016,"It started off as great atmosphere and drinks. But we ordered appetizer nachos. We started to eat and we found a cockroach cooked into the cheese. Management picked up the tab, but warning to all don't eat there before looking what you eat."

Felix L.,"Santa Ana, CA",33,32,7,5.0,7/16/2016,Have to admit - service was amazing by Cooper .. On top of everthing .. Constantly checking on us to ensure overall experience at it's best .. Thanks again Cooper .
Temmy W.,"Dallas, TX",93,68,22,4.0,6/26/2016,It's the Cheesecake. I mean how can you give this place a bad review when their cheesecake are delicious. The wait as usual was disappointing so we ended up taking one of the tables outside. The service was pretty good and fast and like I said the Cheesecake was definitely worth the wait.
Bill M.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/7/2017,"Today is 3/7/17.  Notice the date of my dinner, 1/27/17.  This has been my worst experience with restaurant management ever.  I am normally not a complainer, but this experience should be heard by upper management and dealt with. I normally love the Cheesecake Factory and have taken my family there many times.  This time I ordered curbside take out for my family of five.  I got there and let them know I was ready to pick up my order.  The server said we will be out shortly with your order.  I sat there and watched two other cars who came in after me get there orders.  I sat there approximately 15 mins.  I called back inside to check on my order, and they said it was coming out.  The server was very nice and gave me the order and took my Gift Certificate that I received as a Christmas Gift inside to complete the transaction.  I looked thru the order and noticed we were missing an item.  I told the server when he came back with my receipt that there was an item missing and we went over the order.  He said, he was sorry but they only had down 1 instead of 2 of the appetizers I ordered.  I was on speaker phone with my wife when we ordered and they repeated it back to us when ordering it.  So he says that he will have to charge me for the item since it wasn't on the order.  I have been waiting for 20 mins now and my food is getting cold.  I was not happy about him charging me for their error, but I said go ahead because we needed the item.  After charging me $11.85 for the item, I waited another 10 -15 mins for it to come out.  Now the whole order, which was $70 plus dollars is cold and I have to drive another 15 minutes home.  After I got home and had a limp dinner, I decided that I would call the manager about the experience.  Gretchen, said she was sorry and asked what she could do to make it right.  I told her that I would like a refund for the $11.85 because I shouldn't have been charged for that mistake and that she could give me some kind of gift card for my bad experience.  She offered a $25 gift card that would come in the mail and she would refund my $11.85 on my credit card.  Weeks go by and I received nothing.  I call Gretchen back and she tells me that it has to go thru corporate in California and it takes about 2 weeks to process. A month goes by and I call Gretchen again and tell her I have not received either a refund or a gift card.  She says I can come to the restaurant and she can give me a $25 gift card because it is taking so long.  Now I have to go out of my way, go to the restaurant and get the gift card.  She says that the refund and original gift card are still going to come in the mail.  Now it has been 6 weeks.  I still have no gift card, and no refund.  I speak with Patrick, the General Manager, and he gives me the same story about it has to go thru corporate and he can't do anything about it.  He is not accommodating at all.  I am very frustrated and I ask him, ""if someone has a bad meal in your restaurant, or has a complaint about service, don't you as the GM have the authority to comp their meal an make it right on the spot?"" His response is, ""what do you want me to do to make it right?"" He plainly isn't going to offer anything, just put the ball back in my court. Really?!?  I told him I wanted a $50 gift certificate because I have spent 6 weeks and many phone calls and gotten 0 satisfaction for being a good customer.  He says he will mail me one or I can come to the restaurant and get it.  Again, asking me to go out of my way in order to just be reimbursed for my bad experience.  I ask him to mail it to me and he says he will that day.  Today is 1 week to the day since I talked with Patrick.  I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING FROM CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!!  I call and ask for Patrick and get the 3rd manager I have spoken with now, Reggie, and he says Patrick is not there and he will follow up with him on it tomorrow.  He said he texted Patrick and he got a response of ""already sent it. "" Now I know I have just been lied to by management.  I doesn't take 6 weeks to get either a refund on my credit card, which could have been done on the phone with my information and a credit card machine, or to get a gift certificate mailed to me, even from California! I AM STILL WAITING....... Gretchen could have solved the issue when I called her the first time.  She should have just said, I am sorry for this mistake.  You can have the same order on the house next time you come, or I will personally send you a $75 gift certificate to cover the meal.  That's it!  Problem solved!  DON""T SAY, ""IT HAS TO GO THRU CORPORATE AND WILL TAKE 2 WEEKS!!!!!! NOBODY WANTS THAT AS A RESPONSE!!!!!!!  And then not to follow thru with it?!? Just outright lie about it. Most of the complaints I have read online have to do with poor management.  Maybe the District, Regional, or Head of Customer Relations should take a hard look at this locations' management skills and how customers are treated. Food Good, Management Not So Good!"
Charis S.,"Plano, TX",474,247,470,4.0,6/18/2014,"I'm not a HUGE fan of the restaurant, I'd much rather go to Grand Lux, BUT I won't go there with this review lol..because there ARE good things to say about The Cheesecake Factory! If I'm on my lunch break, I love to sit in the bar area because more than likely they have the TVs on ESPN and the bartenders are very friendly and social.  One thing that you will never forget about this place...their Strawberry Lemonade w/ the sugared rim.  Hands down, the best lemonade EVER. The most recent time I visited, I shared the Hot Spinach & Cheese Dip with my family and it was very good.  Piling the fresh, hot crunchy chips with the dip PLUS the salsa and sour cream was the perfect combination.   Now lately, I've been on my Weight Watchers road, so I always aim towards The Skinnylicious Menu which is AMAZING!  My favorite items, well they're all my favorite so far, are the Veggie Burger, which is seasoned perfectly like a real beef patty, the Soft Tacos which are FILLED with lots of chicken OR shrimp and The Crispy Crab Bites.  The menu is filled with so many options, never boring.  One thing to remember though, if you have a big party with you, get there early, ESPECIALLY on the weekend, because the wait can be a bit long.  Also, I know you were clearly waiting on me to mention CHEESECAKE, but not this time...I don't remember the last time I had one of their huge slices, BUT I know you can't go wrong with the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake.  From what I've hear, the BEST!"
Yvette S.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,1,1.0,5/4/2016,"When we arrived the waiter brought out the bread basket and when we were placing our order he informed us that they were out of steak. So my bf went with the burger, while we were waiting for our order we noticed that there was mold on the sourdough bread. We were so disgusted and when we told the waiter he didn't even apologize he just said ""I'll bring out a new bread basket"" like wtf?? We just got up and left."
Tanya D.,"Dallas, TX",44,74,509,4.0,9/6/2014,So my appetizers and drinks was the highlight of my meal.  Although the food was good it was really nothing over the top fabulous but the bartender needs to be commended because the drinks especially the mojito would bring me back anytime.
Rinny K.,"Irving, TX",392,181,1071,5.0,4/22/2014,This place is a really good place however my only favorite dish here is shrimp and chicken jerk.  Service is always great except today the hostess was in a pissy mood because we refuse to be sat next to the kitchen which is super loud and the restroom.  Really the hostess upset me because it was a birthday celebration and she was not happy or a presentable mood.  Hey if you are working in the front you should always be happy and cheerful.  The menu here is very large so there's always something for someone.  The wait staff is always pleasant here and food and dessert always  perfect.
Giselle B.,"Dallas, TX",78,62,30,4.0,5/21/2015,"It was good as usual today, but the bread, which I LOVE, wasn't that fresh... hope was just today and they didn't change it. My father had the Fried shrimp platter  and he loved it, very crispy and with 3 different dipping sauces. My mom had the grilled beef medallions (small plates menu) and she said it was good and eat it all (thats a lot to say), the crispy grilled veggies and match potatoes looked great, very clean and simple. I  had a beets, feta, rucula side salad which was delicious and the macaronis and cheese side, this time was not crispy and golden on top. Dulce de leche cheesecake amazing. Good experience overall today. Just one small detail I have noticed the last 2 times at this location, waitresses are too much pushing to get the order. They practically gives you the menu and two minutes later ask if you are ready, and then come back every 2 minutes to ask again making you feel very uncomfortable."
Tara D.,"Dallas, TX",265,41,,1.0,10/6/2016,"I placed an order through lash for delivery. None of it was edible. $70 of food and not 1 thing was edible for a human, I would never give such disgusting looking food to a dog. The egg rolls with avacados had brown avacados, the fries looked a month old, soggy bread on the sliders and the corn dogs....  I called lash and someone was supposed to get back with me  nope. 5 emails and 6 calls later. Cheesecake factory stands by their food. Gross. It looks like a good way to get food poisoning and miss 2 days of work. Nothing was even a servable temperature. I offered to send photos before throwing it all out. I should have so I could post them all over the Internet. Clearly I will never go eat at this place. My first experience for this restaurant...  it looks like the health department needs to stop by and check that kitchen out. I was really looking forward to trying this place too. The cheesecake I ordered was over room temp by the time it arrived. Not safe to eat. What a waste of money. No refund issued or anything. Poor customer service.  Best of wished Cheesecake Factory, I hope the health department cruises by soon."
Alan N.,"Houston, TX",42,126,83,4.0,7/2/2016,"The problem with The Cheesecake Factory is deciding what to eat.  Their menu is huge. If you can't find what you want, then you don't know what you want. The portions are huge. We stick with the Skinnylious items. Still more than enough. And they're obviously most famous for their desserts."
Ted F.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Waited 8 min to place to go order never got through  Called back & was told to "" wait a minute"" immediately placed on hold 20 min later gave up.  This was at 4:00 PM -- not busy time"
Renee O.,"Dallas, TX",9,14,,1.0,11/18/2016,Bad service! The hostess messed up and forgot to seat us. We waited and waited to be seated and people that got here after us got in first. And when we asked she just said they're cleaning the table. She's a short woman with dark hair in a pony tail. Would not come here again!!
Russ T.,"Teague, TX",8,34,13,4.0,10/27/2015,"We only came for dessert, but was it the best! I got the Banana creme pie cheesecake. There were seven of us, each ordering different cheesecakes and not one of us had a complaint or left hungry."
Meital J.,"Dallas, TX",72,129,58,5.0,5/7/2016,"Went there with my parents and husband few days ago, the service was fast and nice, the food was amazing, we ordered pasta, salads and appetizers and everything was to die for! And the cheesecakes... the cheesecake were absolutely amazing!"
Aaron O.,"Lexington, KY",23,51,122,3.0,8/6/2015,"I came on a weekday night around 4:30pm to take advantage of Happy Hour which is only served in the bar/lounge area. My date and I were quickly seated and the server took our drink and app order in a timely manner. The app (spinach and cheese dip) was great, better to eat with the bread. However, after delivering our drinks and apps the server was rather busy with other tables and it took a while for her to get back to us.  The restaurant allows you to order some entrees in lunch portion sizes before 5pm and we almost missed ordering before 5pm because it took a while for the server to come back. It also took a while for us to get bread too although I'm not sure if you are supposed to ask for it or if it is supposed to come no matter what so that may be my fault.  Another server delivered our entrees which were huge even for a lunch sized portion. We both got pasta and I wasn't particularly impressed with my pasta. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. The garlic sauce was rather bland. My date got the cheese noodles and it too was alright.  The highlight of the meal was of course the cheesecake. We ordered the chocolate cheese cake with chocolate mouse and it was awesome.  I will definitely make a return trip as I want to try something else other than pasta.. At 5pm it looked like another server arrived and once that happened we received excellent service."
Janeene S.,"Fairfax, VA",80,125,91,5.0,7/27/2015,"Portions are huge! Cheesecakes are out of this world! Favorites are the dulce de leche and the red velvet (think it has 1,400 calories though). I enjoy the shepard's pie, the jambalaya and the chicken dish and there are always leftovers. The grain bread that is brought out for free is delicious. The strawberry tea is tasty, but you can't order all of these in one sitting! Food is great, the wait isn't too long for small parties of 2-4 people, but it can get pretty crowded here."
