Charlie C.,"Cambridge, MA",0,36,,1.0,11/18/2016,"Came here with my wife at 7pm today. Wait was 15 minutes, buzzer went off they said wait 5 more mins, waited to seat. After the 4th couple in that came in AFTER us got seated, I realized they must have forgotten about us, and I asked the hostess what the deal was (who was some short young girl) and she played it off like ""oh yea yea, I checked you in, just a little longer"". Then I saw her scramble to input us into the system, and find a waitress to get us a seat. Clearly she forgot/messed up. She didn't even take responsibility for her error, no apology, nothing. A couple mins later a waitress told us they were preparing our table... ok sure, whatever, I just wanted to eat. But to add insult to injury, while waiting for them to ""prep"" the table... other couples came in and got seated. Like literally walked in the door, and got a seat right away!! I let one couple slide, but once another one just walked in and got seated while our table was still being ""prepped"", it just set me of and we just left. You have got to be kidding me. Terrible person working the front desk, terrible experience. We were really excited to eat here too :("

Karina L.,"Garland, TX",147,66,97,3.0,2/2/2015,"We came here for my friends birthday. We got there a little later than we were supposed to, and our party had already been waiting 45 minutes for a table. After we arrived we waited an additional 40 minutes. They do not accept reservations on Fridays or Saturdays (this was a Friday evening) so I understand the length of time waiting for a table, but I do think they need to change their policy on reservations. People who think ahead to call and make one should come before people who walk in without one."
Ben F.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,2.0,12/6/2016,Ordered a chicken tortilla salad. You would think for $15 there would be more than literally one ounce of chicken. Really not more than a spoon full. Bread was the best part of the experience.
Kirk M.,"Richardson, TX",2,69,,4.0,11/13/2016,"The shepherd's pie was very good and large, too much for my wife to eat.  The burrito grande was good, too; very large, good sauce on top, with guacamole and black beans on the side.  Inside the burrito: one half contained good chicken.  The other end -- 1/4 to 1/3 of the burrito -- contained a large lump of coleslaw, nothing else.  I was surprised; never had seen coleslaw like that in a burrito before.  I mentioned it to our server and she was surprised, too."
Julia W.,"Mesquite, TX",9,13,25,4.0,7/1/2015,"Love the veggie burger. It's made with beets, brown rice, and some other stuff and topped with fontina cheese. Their fries are the bomb! Of course the cheesecake is delicious.  We tried the pineapple upside down cheesecake. Can't wait till tomorrow for my leftovers. Update:  7-1-15.  Cheesecake Factory has changed their recipe for the veggie burger.  Now it's made with grains and no veggies.  OK if you like mushrooms and grains in a ""veggie"" burger.  They have other food that is great.  Check out their salads."
Julie J.,"Lancaster, TX",72,121,18,5.0,1/17/2016,"Went to this location on January 1st with some friends, it was so packed, but we were able to get setting by the bar. Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Our service was fast and food was plentiful and delicious. Will definitely be going back to this location. The drinks: wooo, loaded with alcohol. We definitely got what we paid for."
Ariel A.,"Irving, TX",0,16,1,3.0,11/19/2016,"My husband and I ate at this location for the first time and we weren't very pleased. My husband wanted to order the salad and pizza lunch, but as soon as he requested no cheese on the pizza, our waiter told us that the pizzas are already pre-made with the cheese on top and that there was no way of taking it off. My husband has a cheese allergy, but enjoys their flat bread crust. I would think that since the pizza salad lunch is so expensive, why are the pizzas basically already pre-made? We frequent the Arlington location near the Parks mall and they have never had an issue making his pizza. I'm giving them 3 stars because my chicken Cesar salad came out good and the chicken was nice and well done, as I requested. Unfortunately, we won't be coming back to this location."
Dena P.,"Mesquite, TX",146,24,1,5.0,4/8/2016,"The food, the ambiance and the company is always on point!  We love CCF!"
Keith B.,"Dallas, TX",140,80,282,1.0,12/1/2015,"How did I get fucked on this situation. Small strawberry cheese cake (serves 7) is $32, but is 3 hour wait. Purchased 4 slices (at $7.95 slice).....no wait..."
Shirley R.,"Mesquite, TX",0,6,,2.0,1/20/2016,"Due to our attentive waitress's suggestion, I ordered the Wild Mushroom soup, which did not disappoint. The house salad with Cesar dressing was fine. However, the chicken salad sandwich was sub par and, honestly, quite tasteless. Herb Crusted Salmon was void of flavor. The service and soup were the only palatable items on this visit. We won't be back any time soon."
Raine B.,"Austin, TX",6,30,58,4.0,4/23/2015,"We went on a Wednesday night. I had the da Vinci pasta. Our waitress was prompt and came frequently to check on us. She made sure we were all comfortable and at home! Good was average, although the cheesecake was BOMB! My friend and I shared the Oreo cheesecake....and it tasted like HEAVEN!! Don't leave without trying at least one of their cheesecakes! It's worth the drive!"
Connor C.,"Colleyville, TX",0,101,1,3.0,1/5/2016,"I've eaten at numerous Cheesecake locations and used to visit the Northpark location fairly regularly.  First, I have to say the food at Cheesecake is honestly really good quality compared to other chains. I have heard they make everything from scratch on-site (with the exception of their bread and cheesecakes, ironically). You can taste that it seems better quality than a lot of other restaurants. My favorites there are the spicy cashew chicken, chicken tenders, pizza, Caesar salad (romaine always tastes fresh and plate is cold), southern chicken sliders, and the fried cheese. Really haven't had many issues with the food.  My main issue with this location is service. Often, if I'm heading in for lunch, I will go sit at the bar. For the past year or more, the bartender that always seems to be there waiting on me is just not friendly. I understand not everyone has an overly friendly demeanor, but he just doesn't smile, doesn't seem attentive, like he could care less whether you're there. I tried to ignore it, but it does make you not want to eat there when the bartender serving you isn't at least pleasant like they appreciate your business.  I compare this to the bartenders at another chain - Houston's - and the difference is night and day. The folks at Houston's aren't necessarily overly friendly, but they are always courteous and provide really attentive service, which is all I'm asking for.  I always feel I ask for the bare minimum and always try to tip 20-25%, but doesn't seem to help.  I hope the manager at this location will see this and have a talk with the staff in the bar area about how they are treating the customers. Until then, I will probably go to the Allen location.  Parking at this particular location is also terrible unless you use their valet."
Morgan R.,"Plano, TX",0,8,2,5.0,3/17/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory over all because they have many options, and as a vegetarian I can always modify and change things here with ease to accommodate my picky habits. I also do take out here 90% of my visits. There is a Togo server here by the name of Susan and she is amazing!! Always remembers me by name and always gets my order and all my modifications right. Great customer service is always key to me and they have that here!"
Kimberly W.,"Dallas, TX",161,350,33,4.0,1/18/2015,"I think I need to change up my menu choices. I always order the same thing but the menu choices are vast and great. I love the tropical ice tea there and of course the cheesecake, dulce de leche please."
Orlando F.,"Midland, TX",0,6,10,5.0,4/17/2016,Had the Chicken Bellagio!  Awesome!  Great flavor...ranked #9 on Google; I rank the plate a top 3!  Great service and nice atmosphere!
Jen W.,"Boston, MA",157,189,141,3.0,7/2/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is your classic American chain restaurant...large dishes at affordable prices, with massive options so it's sure to be a crowd pleaser. My hubby and I don't go to TCF often, but I was craving Strawberry Shortcake so we paid a visit.  Since we don't go often, when we do, I always order their Thai Lettuce Wraps.  In the mood for something different, this most recent trip I tried their Pasta Carbonara.  It was just OK.  Even though it had a ton of flavor, it didn't at the same time..it was weird.  And, I know this isn't a ""lite"" pasta dish, but I had awful heartburn the entire next day, and I literally had no idea what it was because I've never had heartburn!   We did order the Strawberry Shortcake though, and finished maybe 20% of it, but the trip was worth it. We probably won't be back from another 6-12 months, but when we do, I'm sure we'll have a decent experience at a very reasonable price."
Clara N.,"Richardson, TX",17,102,7,4.0,1/7/2015,"Came here with a large group of friends. We had to wait a little due to our group size. I  freaking love their bread. I wish that I asked to  bring some home, it'll probably be awhile for my next visit  to Cheesecake Factory.  I had a hard time picking a meal, so I decided to pick a combo, steak diane and herbed crusted salmon? It made me full.. or was it the bread that I was stuffing my face earlier?  but anyhoo the steak diane was alright, I was expecting 1 medium sized steak but it was chunks of steak with mushroom. I'm not fond of mushrooms. but it was alright, The salmon was alright, I'm not a salmon person. I only eat it for its health benefits. ;9 the sauce was nice, It went well with the salmon. and they placed the salmon at the bottom of the 3 asparagus as if it's Wolverine's hand Overall it was a nice experience. I wouldn't pick the combo again though."
Sandor K.,"Dallas, TX",30,336,24,3.0,4/12/2013,"So..... its been a while since I was here - some friends had not been in a long time so we all met up for lunch one day.  Food was Ok... ya know - drinks were too pricey- don't get me wrong - its not that I'm not ever going back - but there was just nothing that stood out here as a ""Dallas must have"".  Service was good - I saw some of the same servers I had seen there for years - food was hot.  Only thing that sticks in my mind was $100 for lunch for 3 - and the food was not that memorable.    So, If had to do it over again, I would have stuck to the meat loaf- Ive had it and its really good.  Its a good place to go with a group - the menu is just too expansive for them to do any one thing really good in my opinion.  Cheesecake on the other hand - they do know how to do and they do it wicked good!  So - chalk one up for dessert here!!!"
Samantha T.,"Dallas, TX",5,101,77,5.0,2/15/2015,Tried the Limoncello cake. They nailed the flavor!  This is a perfect balance of the lemon and cake and cream. I highly recommend this cake!
