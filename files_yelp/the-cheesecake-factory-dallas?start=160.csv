Stephanie M.,"Mesquite, TX",167,2,,5.0,9/24/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time yesterday, Saturday night. And it was amazing ! I have worked in the restaurant industry for a while and the Cheesecake Factory has given me the greatest experience in a restaurant . I know some people do not fully understand how a restaurant works sometimes with wait time, orders piling up in the kitchen and the wait staff doing the best they can to accommodate customers but this location was great! The wait time was around 20-25 minutes , good timing for a weekend. The employees were so nice especially our waiter I believe his name is Jacob. Tall gentleman with long hair . We sat in a small booth opposite of the bar. He was amazing! I give me 100 stars if I could . Very polite and friendly. Always filled up our water when necessary and came to check up on us too. He should definitely get employee of the month !(: I have never experienced a great server until him. Thank you Jacob for making my first time at the Cheesecake Factory a great experience ! Your managers should give you a raise (: haha"
Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",29,249,11,3.0,9/27/2015,"I have a love hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory. While I love their desserts and I'm a big fan of their food, I hate the way this place always gets so crowded and the servers are always so pushy to get you out of here. My friend and I came here tonight in order to catch up and enjoy some dinner, and our over all experience was just weird. Our server brought our bread 3 minutes before our food came out so we couldn't even enjoy that and he seemed annoyed at the fact that we kept telling him we didn't want any cheesecake for dessert. If that wasn't enough, we were given our checks before we even finished eating dinner. Note: being told ""no rush"" when dropping off the checks and asking every 5 minutes if you could take them is rushing us. This experience reminded me why I like eating at other restaurants better. Sorry Cheesecake Factory."
Stephen W.,"Dallas, TX",192,1228,1669,3.0,9/22/2013,"We ate lunch here on a beautiful fall day, the weather was perfect, the food not so much. What I did not like: my Pit Beef sandwich was one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had in my life. The beef was virtually inedible, fatty, tough to chew, and had no ""char"" flavor at all. The horseradish sauce was flavorless. The cheese was not melted. The total sandwich was nothing short of horrible. They need to remove this item from the menu or learn how to make it correctly. I also did not like the fact that I was upsold to the largest size beer without my knowledge. Usually, the customer is asked what size he/she wants.  What I liked: the wife's Chicken Bellagio was delicious--the chicken was moist and tender, really good flavor. The accompanying pasta with pesto was a bit oily but overall it was a good dish. As usual, the portion is enormous.  The winner of the meal was the cheesecake; we got a plain piece and it was so good that we could have made a meal of that alone. It was light, airy, and very flavorful. On the strength of the cheesecake I am giving this place 3 stars."
Demetria C.,"Dallas, TX",401,244,1847,5.0,8/24/2013,"Love this location, service is always good and all of there seafood options are delicious!"
Tiffany S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",388,508,776,5.0,8/3/2014,"National Cheesecake Day. I had no idea that was even a thing until I saw all the advertisements for half priced cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory on social media. Being a lover of cheesecake and deals, I had to check it out. This Cheesecake Factory location is awesome because they allowed customers to get cheesecake to go and still qualify for the half off deal. Awesome sauce! Yolanda M. and I were able to grab our cheesecakes in less than 10 minutes flat and head home. Now that's my kind of National Cheesecake Day."
P H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2110,1595,4321,3.0,7/21/2014,"My party tried 5 different cheesecakes: -Dutch apple pie has the crunch and texture. Sweeter than the Dulce de leche. A close tie  -Mango Key Lime is tart  -Dulce de leche - A classic. Not too sweet. This one has more of the traditional cheesecake consistency.  -S'Mores - good texture and rich -Red Velvet - one of their most advertised and famous cheesecakes. This monster towers taller than most of the other cheesecakes. This thing is super rich too so I recommend sharing this unless you have super fast metabolism Dulce de leche was my favorite followed by the dutch apple, which was a close second."
Giordan C.,"Dallas, TX",69,53,14,4.0,7/28/2014,"First time going to this location but it's basically the same as the others. But the one thing they really do have in common is the unusually slippery floors, idk what they are doing but they are always slippery.  But to the food... Number one make sure you get extra rye bread idk why but it's GOOD. We also tried the buffalo chicken wontons (I think that's what they're called) they gave us a lot of them and I'm glad they did. By far the best buffalo chicken anything I've had in a while, get ranch too(ranch goes with everything FYI) For dinner I got the Cajun Pasta with extra shrimp, it was good not really a stand out meal though not worth getting. But we also got Smokehouse BBQ burger. Now that was good! Burger was cooked to perfection, bacon was thick, and the crispy onion rings put it over the top. Best decision I've made in a while, bottom line next time you go get that! Thank me later."
Brittany C.,"Dallas, TX",135,59,128,5.0,7/26/2015,Fabulous food & service. This is one of the few restaurant chains I'm always up for. Chicken piccata and chicken salad sandwich are my two favorite dishes & you can't go wrong with a slice of cheesecake to share for dessert. The dulce de leche one is supreme.
Van-Anh H.,"Dallas, TX",95,42,,4.0,2/3/2016,"No shame, I love the Cheesecake Factory. I'm a sucker for their cheesecake, but also their farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. I get it every single time. I like to switch up the cheesecake on occasion, but some of my favorites include red velvet, oreo, and kahlua."
Kimberly T.,"Niagara Falls, Canada",363,39,,5.0,7/2/2014,"We went out for dessert, and it was a tough choice to choose a cheesecake to enjoy...there are so many amazing flavors. What...with the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake that looked awesome and had great reviews...Plus, for every slice sold, The Cheesecake Factory donates 25 cents to Feed the Hungry in the USA. We had the Banana Cream Cheesecake complete with fresh bananas and Bavarian cream custard all topped with fluffy whipped cream. Also, we ordered the more classic flavor of Dulce de Leche Cheesecake topped with finely chopped nuts and crunchy toffee with fluffy whipped cream. The pieces were so big that we each brought half of ours home, even after we sampled each other's too! Our waitress was such a sweetheart and so helpful - we were impressed with our service."
Lauren W.,"Galveston, TX",31,169,298,5.0,10/4/2014,"This is a fantastic Cheesecake Factory location! Great service! Food was spot on, seriously suggest the fried mac and cheese balls!"
Mystery L.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,,1.0,8/4/2016,"Let me preface by saying me and my family have been meeting at the Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years. We live in the Dallas Texas area and frequent three of the locations Frisco, Arlington, and Rt 12 / Northwest Highway in Dallas, depending if  we are coming from work, or depending Where We Are while traveling around the city. Northwest Highway Cheesecake Factory over the past seven years has consistently going downhill in the consistency and quality of food. 4:30 today my daughter and I went in to get one of our favorite dishes which is the chicken Madeira. Aside from odd attitude that was on the rude side with the waitress when we asked her for extra butter because three paths are just not enough... gave a dirty look and rolled her eyes. When we received our food the chicken was over done quite rubbery. The potatoes where as if they had been sitting since lunchtime and also tasted like the dairy that was used in it was sour/went bad.. The Madeira gravy was extra peppery. At no time did our waitress come over to ask us how our meal was. Aside from the bad food we had to combat against a plethora of fruit flies that were trying to attack our food  one of which got into my daughter's gravy boat. My daughter got up & spoke to the general manager named Pat or Patrick who she explained all the issues at no time did he show empathy or apologized. He only offered to get us new mashed potatoes and gravy. When he came over to the table we showed him the fruit flies. Still no empathy, no let me remake your food because the whole dish was a disaster. He just completely disregarded  the horrific  quality of service and food  we received as if it was acceptable . OK in the meanwhile I called up the corporate number, took a picture of our receipt, the varioud flies we caught and s picture of the underside of the   show all the food and filth / crime that was stuck  underneath the table. While on the phone leaving a voicemail with corporate since they close at 4 p.m. suffice as to say... if you want a good experience with Cheesecake Factory the Frisco location by far is more consistent, they're serving portions are generally decent and the quality and professionalism is important to the staff.  As one more side note we were at the same location last week and had the same meal. They ran out of mashed potatoes and this time they were soupy and gave us barely half cup portion of potatoes and served it to us knowing full well they ran out of mashed potatoes. Again this is acceptable?"
Shanda C.,"Dallas, TX",6,37,27,2.0,1/31/2016,"It was better than last time. This time at least the food was good but the service was mediocre. Good servers know to always ask if guests want more coffee and always bring a pot to refill not just a cup for one person. What if someone changes their mind? A good server is prepared. Anyway, the plain cheesecake, which I've never had before, was sumptuous, creamy & absolutely perfect! I will definitely get it again."
Kaitlyn K.,"Mexico Beach, FL",0,12,1,4.0,7/30/2016,"Brittany is a great server, very hardworking and attentive . It was very hot outside and she kept those waters coming ! Thanks :-)"
J W.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/26/2016,"I went last evening for my daughters 18th bday and it was terrible. The food was cold, my daughters was undercooked, my sons was overcooked, wait time at the table was terrible, and they weren't all that friendly. $100 spent on 3 ppl for some nasty food. Even the cheesecake wasn't good. I've been to this restaurant chain numerous times in other states and I will have to admit this is the worst experience ever.  My daughter was upset that her b-day dinner was not good and she's even sick today from that food. I will never go back to this restaurant again."
Leigh Z.,"Austin, TX",0,287,135,4.0,10/24/2015,"My boyfriend and I met some friends there for dinner a couple weeks ago on a Friday night around 6. We were able to be seated right away and our waitress was helpful and attentive. Their portions are HUGE and while the food we got was really good it is also very expensive. I wish they did half portions for less price (which maybe they do for lunch.....not sure). I did leave full and again, the service was good."
Anshita S.,"Dallas, TX",121,3,,4.0,1/13/2015,Ehh I heard so much about this place that I was so excited. It was my first time here on a Friday night. Ones we were up next to our table. Our server was nice lady. The chef was great too. Food was overall great. And the cheesecke.. Yumm Yumm :D Made me forget all my worries :)
Trish D.,"Dallas, TX",24,6,,1.0,12/8/2015,"Tuesday went to the Cheesecake Factory for husbands birthday lunch,wow  not sure what had happen but the main meal was horrible. My husbands hamburger was over cooked,and my pasta was not cook. We complained so they took it off our bill. But still the service sucked. And I didn't really feel that they really cared."
Velvet J.,"Dallas, TX",96,17,,5.0,4/17/2016,"I went here with my mom and sister and we had such a great meal! I had the steak diane and chicken medeira..the chicken was moist not dry at all it was great topped with mozarella cheese and mushrooms! The steak diane was awesome! It was tender and cooked perfectly, very flavorful, great topped with the onions and mushrooms! Of course  I had my favorite lemon raspberry cream cheesecake! Mmmmmm"
A.P. P.,"Irving, TX",54,20,34,1.0,9/13/2015,We came here on my birthday last year not impressed at all. The server said they don't do anything special on birthday. Really? Unbelievable.... She had the attitude. The management please pay attention to this story... This is unfair for me. We always love your company and your food.
