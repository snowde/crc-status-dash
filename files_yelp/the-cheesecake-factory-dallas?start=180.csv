Desirae B.,"Omaha, NE",581,621,125,2.0,5/3/2012,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory numerous times over the years, this visit was underwhelming. I was craving spinach dip.....so we decided to make a meal of appetizers and ordered the southwest eggrolls, a sushi app, sweet corn tamale cakes (my fav), goat cheese and beat salad and a spin dip. The first spin dip that arrived tasted crabby....ew. We sent it back and the replacement was just really bitter...no seasoning...bland...it just sat on the table. The chips were better than the dip. The eggrolls were tasty as was the salad....the tamale cakes were mushier than usual.  CF really needs to pair down their menu...it's just too many selections to be good at all of them. Focus on the best of the bunch and perfect those....scap the rest, seriously.....this visit makes me seriously question going back for a loooooonnnnngggg time, if ever."
Laura H.,"Dallas, TX",0,9,1,5.0,1/5/2016,We call in our order and do curbside pick up everytime.  Always quick and easy! The Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic or the chicken Madeira hits the spot every time. Tried the sweet corn tamale cakes this last time and holy amaze-balls they are soooooo yummy!!! My mouth is watering just typing this out! Of course the cheesecake is always amazing and so many options.
Hannah D.,"McKinney, TX",0,10,3,4.0,1/3/2016,I went to go eat at the Cheesecake Factory and the food was excellent and the service was great. My favorite was the chocolate ice cream it was very creamy and delicious. I will definitely come back next time!
Mister F.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/20/2015,"My spouse and I decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory tonight after a debate between where to go with the opposite choice of Joes Crab Shack ... We decided to grab something to go since we also had laundry to do, so we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory, and called in an order.  SO ...Currently sitting and waiting for about an hour now for a meal in which was ordered about 30 minutes before arrival. I had ordered the pork chop dinner only to arrive 30 minutes later and stand in line for an additional 15 minutes to be told that the porkchops are still cooking. Another 10 minutes go by and finally being told that they ran out of pork chops and that I would need to choose another selection ... (55minutes into the order) ...  After waiting an additional 10 minutes after being given a menu, I stepped back to the register and was ignored for another several minutes before I was acknowledged. I ordered a Steak Diane, and requested bread and water to snack on while we waited. After another 10 minutes went by, I was asked how I wanted my steak cooked ... something I felt should have been asked when it was ordered. I requested RARE (#TeamVampire) to which another 15-20 minutes passed ... and I was given what appeared to be clearly medium well ... and to top it all off;  I never did get my bread and water ...  For this to be my first time in all of my 30+ years of life having anything from the Cheesecake Factory - I found this to be very disappointing. They should rename the establishment The Hunger Games because if you ever order from here -- ""may the odds ever be in your favor!"" But in all fairness, the cheesecake selections are plentiful and delicious. Loved the oreo cheesecake ... not recommended for those with diabetic nature."
T L.,"Grapevine, TX",0,5,2,4.0,10/31/2015,"Love this restaurant and come here frequently but had a bad experience here the other night with a waiter in the bar. Had to remind him about my husband's drink order to which he replied ""yeah, I know. It's coming"". Then I watched him go and order it on the computer...he totally forgot! Other than that, good food and extensive menu."
B M.,"Frisco, TX",0,58,6,1.0,12/16/2015,"So I have now been sitting here for 20 minutes solid. I have just received my drinks, after my waitress walked by three times saying ""I'll be right there"" I finally just walked up to the bar. The rice with my chicken was hard and undercooked, the sauce was okay but nothing to come back for.  My biggest reason I will not come back is the fact of my waitress. She was beyond horrible. Took forever to bring any sort of refill and never brought bread when asked twice. She never asked how the food was, another guy brought my refills because he saw I waited so long. My waitress walked away from me mid sentence twice.  I hope jacquelyn finds a job that doesn't involve customer service, because she seriously lacks that skill."
Hannah R.,"Lubbock, TX",1,65,,4.0,8/19/2014,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory! My favorite thing about going back each time is that I can try something new on the menu. This restaurant is well-known for its 15 page long menu with anything from crab cakes to Tex Mex, not to mention CHEESECAKE. I have tried nearly everything and my absolute favorite is the Tex Mex Egg Rolls. They are so flavorful, fried to perfection and come with a fantastically spicy cream sauce.  My only complaint is the wait here- you really need to go during a weird time to get a seat immediately. But considering the area, with the restaurant being directly across the street from the most frequented mall in town, you can't complain about a wait. Especially since the food is so good!"
Jen V.,"McKinney, TX",436,770,113,3.0,10/3/2012,"I try not to review chain restaurants as the review is kind of for all locations. I really wanted cheesecake...cheesecake for days.  So, that is what I got. You get there, seated immediately at about 7p on a Tuesday, handed the giant menu...what is it? 100 pages?  Too much to choose from, definitely go with what you want already in mind.  I ordered a pasta with shrimp and it was pretty good...last night and again for lunch today...and it was still too much food.  Got the red velvet cheesecake to go...still working on that as well.  So large, so good.  My friend ordered the pear mango martini and after trying it had to get one too...but due to my lightweight ways I couldn't finish it, gave her the rest.  Very good though."
Jennifer Y.,"Austin, TX",486,1024,9615,4.0,9/3/2012,"It's a chain restaurant so obviously that means that the food is almost just good for being considered to be ""prepped"" as in , they all taste the same.  It is only a matter of tenderness of meat and freshness and cleanliness of veggies and fruits.  The service was quite nice and they even provided a tiny candle for my friend's birthday cheesecake and wrote out ""happy birthday"" on the plate all nice and decoratively."
Teresa V.,"Richardson, TX",0,4,1,1.0,11/14/2015,Pasta was gross the chicken was spoiled. Kids pizza was not any better. Would not ever go back.
Chricel F.,"Garland, TX",3,12,8,1.0,1/25/2015,"WORST experience at cheese cake factory. Waited for our table for an hour when our table have been empty fo 30 mins. They are out bread, out of steak, out of salmon. REALLY?!! Its sunday! Like really u didnt expect people to come in? Shortage with staff and shortage with food?! = bad management!"
Theresa H.,"Carrollton, TX",27,14,4,5.0,8/31/2015,"I love going here. I tried the buffalo chicken fried wantons. I didn't want to eat my dinner, I just wanted to finish all the appetizers. I'm planning to go back soon."
Chaowei W.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",22,4,2,4.0,6/25/2015,"Great place for dating. As they advertised, cheesecake is fancy. Coffee is awful. Kobe burger is one of the best beef burger I had ever tried. Recommend it!"
Steffanie B.,"New York, NY",249,339,75,3.0,6/27/2012,"Obviously the dessert is what really shines.  The cheesecake, sure but I like the carrot cake and the chocolate tower cake. Not crazy about thier breakfast/brunch items.  As far as lunch/dinner, I feel like their menu is a little exhaustive but that is their thing.  I am a little indecisive, so that is not so good for me....can I have a few more minutes please or what do you recommend.  I always hope for a very patient waiter.  Back to business...here are a few of the dishes that I have tried, and I do mean few. Madeira Chicken ( I used to stick to this one everytime) White Chicken Chilli (healthy, light and tasty option)"
Abigail S.,"Plano, TX",12,16,2,2.0,2/13/2015,Food is good and obviously love the cheesecake but our waiter forgot to put in our appetizer order and when our entrée came and we asked where the appetizer was she just said she forgot it and asked what she wanted us to do... She was very nice but if you forget a customers order it should be comped and come out immediately not let us say forget about the order. Then she continued to hover the rest of our meal which just annoyed us to no end.
Jody O.,"Dana Point, CA",0,11,4,2.0,8/21/2015,"Here is the deal. Adorable hostess. Knowledgeable friendly deli staff which recommend the best chocolate cheesecake. The problem is when we sat down. Not a friendly waitress, Haley, no silverware, no requested water, no requested lit candle, no bread. Food arrived hot. Get the tuna carpaccio! Waitress never returned to ask how we were. Slapped the bill down without a thank you. Oh, bathroom was dirty. Not going back. I've been to several Cheesecake Factories and this was the worst."
Gena R.,"Austin, TX",1,21,8,1.0,9/28/2014,"I had to admit that I liked the sunday brunch (even if it's overpriced) but if you guys want to eat together with COCKROACHES and even worse than they seem to be used to see these incidents often and they did nothing but hide it, then go to this shitty place."
Roni B.,"Euless, TX",337,552,242,4.0,1/5/2014,i'm not a big sweets fan...but my wife & i both wanted cheesecake...why not go here lol walked right in...placed our order...waited about 5 minutes if that long & we were on our way. i had the strawberry cheesecake & she had the blackout cake!! yummy to our tummy!!
Jovanna O.,"Dallas, TX",37,152,79,3.0,4/10/2015,Ordered the Chicken Beligio and it was delicious!  Our server was attentive until we paid the bill.  We were not finished eating and once we paid he stopped paying attention to us!  We had to flag him down to get to go boxes!!
Tom D.,"Lewisville, TX",1,3,1,5.0,9/6/2015,Have been celebrated   with great food! In the pic is a grilled salmon fish with mashpotatos:)very yummy and recommended!
