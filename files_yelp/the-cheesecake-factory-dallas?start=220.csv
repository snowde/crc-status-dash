Neal S.,"Houston, TX",40,54,6,1.0,8/6/2014,Really bad service.  We walked in for a party of 6 and requested the large booth. They said yes but when we went to the booth it was uncleared and dirty. So they said they would clean it up. I said I will be right outside for a smoke and be right back. They said fine. Now one of the party members has a child that does not like to be touched so we had to be specific. No more than 90 seconds I come back and they said oh you are back. I gave the table to someone who was wearing the same shirt as you. How stupid is that. Then the manager doesn't even offer anything in return until I had said you mistakenly gave away my table and and try to sit me at a 5 person table. That is horrible. Keep in mind this dinner was for a big dinner meeting with clients and being squished together wasn't going to work. I got upset and said this is insane that is all you can do. She offers a app and says there is nothing more we can do.  Now I look like a bad host and our meeting starts off on a sour note. I really wish this place was better than I have reviewed but after a bad start you start to distrust the food and service.
Mykie D.,"Valley Ranch, TX",498,898,757,3.0,7/29/2013,It had been a few years since I visited this location. They are super crowded on weekends. The service is just ok. I prefer the location in Frisco.
Karina C.,"Irving, TX",0,3,1,2.0,4/25/2015,"This was the first encounter I have ever had at the CCF and to be honest I was not impressed one bit. To begin with my date and I had over 5 waiters come to our table that by the time we received our bill we had no idea who the tip was going to. Although all waiters were average. Nothing exceptional. I ordered the Tomato basil pasta which was good until my stomach started acting funny. I was not pleased with this. My date seemed to have enjoyed what he ordered. Most likely the first and last time I ""eat"" here. To add it is overpriced, there are restaurants that offer great food and great service for less."
Myia B.,"Dallas, TX",503,698,850,4.0,6/14/2011,"Service is super sweet here.  I have yet to experience bad service.  Blake was our server this weekend and he was hilarious and very personable.   The dishes are tasty, the menu expansive (they likely have SOMETHINGS with an S that will suit your palette).  The ambience is nice... love the lighting.   Favorite dish right now... rotating between the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and the Chicken Carbonara.  Plain cheesecake & the white chocolate macadamia nut. Go."
Rikard W.,"Dallas, TX",108,27,2,5.0,6/18/2014,Absolutely outstanding burgers better than Fuddruckers. The tortilla soup is also wonderful. And the prices very very reasonable for what you get and you get a lot.
Darin S.,"Dallas, TX",45,91,,2.0,7/21/2013,"Went here with a buddy last week.  Went at an off-time - about 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.  Our waiter (Ryan)  was just awkward and inattentive.  My order was wrong and had to be re-done (I had a sandwich and soup) and they got the sandwich wrong. My buddy was almost done with his meal buy the time I received the corrected meal.  Then, there was some confusion on the bill with my using a gift card (my fault, it only had $4 on it!) but the process too so long.  On several occasions during our meal we had to try and flag down other waiters.   The food was great (and always is) but this visit just was terrible because it was such a challenge and took so long.  We ordered our cheesecake to go because we could not stand to sit there any longer with bad service."
Carol I.,"Richardson, TX",1,4,,4.0,3/7/2015,"My waitress was very busy so service wasn't great.  Four cheese pasta was awesome but I wasn't offered fresh grated Parmesan  Ok, the red velvet  cheesecake was OUTSTANDING!!! Definitely recommend!  It's pretty loud and crowded but it's still a great  meal and experience"
Nida D.,"Carrollton, TX",857,134,702,3.0,9/12/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, except I am not a fan of the no reservations policy on the weekends. We came here on Saturday night and it was beyond packed. You couldn't even walk into the restaurant because there were so many people waiting. The wait time was 45 minutes to an hour that night, which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me, because if only they accepted reservations, this wouldn't have been an issue. We decided to just wait, because I was craving some cheesecake. The ladies at the hostess stand weren't friendly, which is something they definitely need to address. Absolutely no customer service skills. Our waitress however was very pleasant, she recommended great items from the extensive menu. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and it was delectable. So much flavor on the chicken and the pasta and the portion size was huge, the pasta can easily be shared by two people. We also ordered two different cheesecakes, the Red Velvet and the Oreo, both were amazing, definitely satisfied my cravings. Overall, I loved the food and dessert and would definitely recommend this place but if you are going on the weekend be ready to wait almost an hour for a table."
Maria F.,"Carrollton, TX",0,13,6,4.0,2/26/2015,"My fiancé and I ate here on Wednesday afternoon around lunch time. Thank God it wasn't packed we had a great experience. Our waiter was Bobby but goes by Bo he was great so mellow, sweet always checking in on us. I first ordered the lunch special which was the crusted chicken with asparagus when it came out I was thrown back because I couldn't believe how small it was I thought I had ordered for a child lol. They need to improve lunch that's why I'm giving 4 stars. I did apologize to our waiter and told him I was going to order something else. He was really gracious about it. I ate the Chicken Madeira which I love it's so good. My fiancé enjoyed his turkey burger he did mention he could of done without the drowning of the onions and mushrooms I thought it tasted good with the combination.  We also enjoy the bread and butter. We ordered dessert to go they were a bit thinner then what I can remember but overall great experience."
Ramon C.,"Flint, TX",22,44,22,4.0,11/3/2014,Enjoyed the Pasta Carbonara. Portions are enormous so take it easy if ordering appetizer. Service was pretty good for them being busy on a Sunday after church services. I'm sure with such a huge menu they can't do everything great but it seems they few times I've been there that they have the pastas on point. They could stand to not put the tables so close in some areas but as busy as they are they are cramming as many people as they can in there.
Sophia G.,"Arlington, TX",66,56,292,1.0,5/25/2013,"This visit was not that great! I usually love The Cheesecake Factory, today  it was not there. I was sitting at the bar and usually it is cool, but not today. The small plate we had, was the avocados , mushroom& zucchini it was awesome"
dean d.,"Dallas, TX",53,844,516,4.0,8/29/2012,I totally enjoyed the Eggplant Sandwich: and their Skinnylicious menu (stupid name but great low cal selections) is longer than most other restaurants full menus. I'm surprisingly impressed.
Kathy P.,"Mansfield, TX",0,2,,1.0,12/21/2014,"Worst food ever, worst service ever! Skip it!  My fettuccine alfredo was ice cold, they took it to heat it and it came back 2 minutes later colder! Not sure what went on in the kitchen! Then asked buss person for our check, our waiter brought it then 2 minutes later The manager brought it - a different check! Who knows!  Please do yourself a favor and skip it. Ohh out of the seasonal favorite pumpkin cheesecake!"
Marilyn M.,"Dallas, TX",463,436,115,3.0,1/29/2010,"This review is a challenge; I've vacillated between 2 and 4 stars, reluctantly settling on 3. Here's why:  Service - 5 definite stars  Atmosphere - 4 definite stars  Food - 4 stars  Price - 1 star  Love the atmosphere. It's both fun and sorta classy, in its own unique way. Just enjoyed the feel of the place with the pale yellow walls, various hand painted murals, mirrors and columns. Yes, it's almost an upscale spot but in a comfy relaxing non-stuffy way. Various seating areas with both tables and large booths.  Also, a very nice fairly large bar area, which looked enticing ! Layden, our server, was at the top of the scale with his attention. Promptly there with a cheerful welcome for drink orders and menus and that delightful bread (oh so good, warm and soft). He gave us just the appropriate amount of time to review the vast, huge (too large IMO) menu before coming back to take food requests.  He was a delightful young man. (AND a very tall one at that; bet my friend he was at least 6'3"", but didn't get personal and ask Layden). When inquiring if he was a college student, he excitedly shared that he was in real estate, with an ""elite"" company. He said he was encouraged that the market was turning around, and at the end of the evening said to be sure and call if we were ever in the market for a home. Since I had instigated the conversation as to his career, didn't feel we were getting a solicitation for his business, but just part of his courteous response to our interest. I digress, back to the food now.  Preface all by mentioning that my friend had a $50 gift certificate which brought us to the Cheesecake Factory that evening. Neither of us had been here in several years, so we were looking forward to something different. He ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta; Penne with Artichokes, Broccoli, Roasted Eggplant, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Garlic, Pine Nuts & Parmesan Cheese. I ordered Pasta Carbonara with Spaghettini, Chicken, Bacon, Green Peas, in a creamy Parmesan Sauce, to which I added fresh chopped Tomatoes.  Food arrived promptly, hot and a HUGE serving. My dish was good; creamy, not too rich and not saturated with the sauce; the chicken was tender and moist pieces of white meat; I really enjoyed the addition of the fresh chopped tomatoes; a perfect blend of flavors with the bacon, peas and garlic. YUM !!! About two thirds of my entree traveled home for lunch the next day.  I tasted the friend's entree, and it was quite good as well. Loved the smoky taste of the sun dried tomatoes and roasted eggplant. He obviously liked it as well, as there was not one single tube of Penne left in the bowl. It looked like he could have licked the bowl clean.  Now, let's chat a moment about prices. We had two pasta entrees, he had two beers, and I had two Merlots. Bill arrives; friend studies it, looks up and says ""can you believe this....$61 for our dinner?"" We are both a little stunned. $61 for pasta and 2 drinks each? Yes, we realize that alcohol often eats up 1/2 of the check, but, really, at the Cheesecake Factory? The food was good; enjoyable, no complaints,  but not off the chart ""best I've ever had anywhere"".   Had this been at Bugatti's, Andiamo's, or other fine (non chain) Italian dining establishments, price would have been the norm and expected. (I've paid much more at those special spots, and worth every $)  But, at the CCF ?  Don't think so.  While we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and the food, and the service, and don't regret dining here, we both agree there are MANY other spots with comparable food and atmosphere that would be less pricey.   Yep, CCF,  we like you, but you are way overpriced for what you are.   (AND, we didn't even have any of your awesome desserts. Perhaps next time, we'll drop by for a glass of wine and some yummy cheesecake!!)"
Robert D.,"Richardson, TX",29,57,,4.0,9/13/2014,Good restaurant.  The menu is huge and it will take you a while to figure out what to get for dinner.  I had the Chicken Bellagio which was very good bread chicken on a bed of pasta.  Also shared piece of Lemon Mirangue Cheese cake which was very good (the dinner plate is big lol).  The ambiance and decorations were also very good.  You could be casual or dress a bit nicer.  Definitely worth checking out and come prepared to eat lol.
Russell F.,"Waxahachie, TX",25,196,48,4.0,7/11/2014,If you have a group that can't figure out what they want to eat bring them here. The menu is huge and has lots of choices. The food is good and the cheesecake even better. This may not be true but I think if you eat your cheesecake there you get a larger portion than if you get it to go. That being said I am almost always too full after my meal to eat my cheesecake there!
Tim C.,"Dallas, TX",97,15,4,4.0,8/27/2014,I have no complaints except for maybe the price. The food is really delicious and the overhead must be high for such a beautiful restaurant. They have a good staff and its a great place to celebrate. Maybe go there once a year for a special occasion.
Robert C.,"Garland, TX",3,31,2,3.0,11/6/2014,I've eaten there a couple of times and last night the waitress was like a hummingbird there one second gone the next. The food is good although how they expect us to eat that much is crazy.
Jose P.,"Dallas, TX",3,63,6,5.0,6/16/2014,"I always love coming here, especially their delicious and tall cheesecakes. The food us great and the bread they give out in the beginning is a +1 for me. Overall a great place to dine, don't forget to save room for a cheesecake. ;)"
M A.,"Richardson, TX",4,30,24,4.0,8/11/2013,I usually like to try small restaurant and cheesecake shops! But in Dallas choices are not same as NYC & SF. I would say that this branch is never let us down! Always good! but if you want to seat and enjoy expect some waiting time! Specially during weekends! The Pasta is good no matter how you will order it!
