Alexa L.,"Richardson, TX",1,6,6,3.0,6/24/2013,"Your pretty typical chain restaurant. Menu with no particular theme but offering everything but the kitchen sink. If you can't decide what you want to eat this is definitely the place for you. My biggest qualm about this place is that everything is just so darn heavy and unhealthy - slathered in grease and butter. I know they are trying to provide a ""skinny"" menu now but not sure if even these items are that healthy... All in all, good chain restaurant but nothing out of the ordinary."
Jodi G.,"Dallas, TX",829,270,2068,4.0,5/27/2010,"I really do enjoy Cheesecake Factory :) I have had cocktails, pasta dishes, chicken, and a mahi mahi dish...& of course their UBER delicious cheesecake!  That's always hard to decide on cause they have SO MANY scrumptious varieties!!  The cheesecake usually has to be wrapped to-go on account of the large entree.  I like how quickly I've always been seated no matter what size group I was with (2-6).  The servers and hostesses have always been very nice."
Sophia V.,"Houston, TX",227,140,652,3.0,7/25/2010,"I ate here today; but I go here frequently, both in Houston & Dallas! The food here never lets me down. As starters, we always order the Spinach Artichoke or the Crab Artichoke dip. Yum! As for the main course, my choice always varies! I've had manyyy dishes here, and to name a  few-- the Club Turkey Sandwich, Thai Lettuce Wraps, the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta, the Chicken Marcel, Jambalaya Pasta,  Garlic Noodles and the pan-seared Salmon.  Of all, I really didn't enjoy the Garlic Noodles & the Jambalaya Pasta. The Garlic Noodle was too bland; and the Jambalaya pasta, is way too oily and spicy. Too spicy to enjoy. Everything else is fabulous!  And you CAN'T forget to have a slice of cheesecake. The have a huge variety which isn't even funny. You name it, they have it! My favorites are: Chocolate Oreo Mudslide and the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. After all, they are known for their cheesecakes. :)"
Ann M.,"Corinth, TX",0,92,2,4.0,6/2/2014,"We arrived at grandma's house to discover that she must have went shopping with her 16 year old neighbor.  80 yr old grandma is wearing a belly baring shirt that says 'Geek' on it, along with very tall wedge sandals and a dragon patterned skirt.  Thankfully she has a button down sweater as well.  The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to take 'that one friend' or 'that one relative' (you know the one) who just can't be trusted to behave in public.  The food is actually quite good and lack of etiquette and class seems to be acceptable or at least not frowned upon too much.  The atmosphere gives a false sense of it being a nice restaurant.  Your 'special' relative or friend will think you're taking them to a nice place.   We entered the door and noone gave grandma's attire a second look.  We were surrounded by a family of nose pickers while waiting to be seated.  Thankfully, we were seated promptly.   The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious and so was the bread.  Our nephew placed his foot on the seat, knee above table, to tie his shoe.  His lack of table manners was overshadowed by the large group of rowdy individuals sitting only a couple feet from us.  Tables are very close and the venue is extremely loud.  We could not hear those sitting directly across from us due to the way sound carries in the restaurant.  The birthday man sitting at the table next to us was blinged out for his birthday dinner.  His pants pockets, which sat well below his butt cheeks barely covered by his underwear, were covered in rhinestones.  His friends/family sang happy birthday to him three different times.  Of course, our nephew had to join in the singing every time.  Grandma joined in on the final song.  My husband and I began calculating how fast we could leave.  Our food arrived which was delicious, as always.  The food is overpriced for what it is.  We can eat at much higher quality restaurants with a nicer atmosphere for the same price, but we wouldn't dare take grandma or the nephew to those places.  Entrees are $14-$20 on average.   We notice our nephew holding his shirt over his nose.  We give him a dirty look and he tells us that grandma farted.  My husband can't take it anymore.  He starts dying laughing.  He orders a shot to get through remainder of the meal.  I'm speechless at this point and attempting to keep a straight face.   When you go to Cheesecake Factory, of course, you have to order Cheesecake.  That's another 10 minutes before we can escape.  Grandma orders coffee afterwards, another 10-15 minutes.  The night is dragging on.  I escape to the restroom to get a break from dinner at the zoo.  The floors are waxed with a substance that must be meant for slip n' slides.  I keep my balance and manage not to fall.  In the restroom someone else is very loudly passing gas and it's not grandma.  At least this person went to the restroom to do it.  Back to the table I go.   After another 15 minutes or so we are finally ready to leave.  Our nephew discovers the slip n' slide floors and runs to slide yelling 'woo hoo'.  We drop the nephew and grandma off.  We survived the night.  The staff at Cheesecake Factory act professional and treat you like royalty even when you bring problematic people.  I feel sorry for them, but I am thankful that we can count on them."
Michael D.,"Garland, TX",3,10,3,4.0,6/19/2014,"Nice for cheesecake factories. Close to NorthPark Mall. I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake factories in general, for some reason I can't quite quantify. But others shouldn't hold that against them, this location is a good one."
Hai P.,"Garland, TX",230,41,29,4.0,4/21/2014,"I been to Cheesecake a few times for various occasions but never for brunch.  Food and service was great, granted it was for Easter Sunday, had the Crab Hash from the brunch selection.  I enjoyed it as the crab tasted like it was fresh and nicely cooked, I would recommend anyone that's in the mood for crab cake eggs Benedict fusion dish.  Traditionally eggs Benedict would be laid on top of a English muffin but it was on top of country potatoes which tasted great.  Go give them a try."
Matt T.,"Dallas, TX",154,446,329,4.0,6/21/2011,Their menu and their portions are comical.  Their menu is like reading a novel and their portions for a regualr entree feed about 2 and a half hungry adults.   The service is really good for a big chain.  The wait can be annoying depending on what time you try to go.  The atmosphere reminds me of a Las Vegas casino restaurant.  The food is across the board better than I would think it should be.  And the price is high per entree but not high at all when you take into account how much food you are getting. The bonus is their cheesecake which is absolutly amazing and some of the best desserts you will find anywhere.
Alicia F.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2015,"Well I have to say I'm fairly disappointed in not only the cooks this evening, but the manager tonight as well at the Dallas NW highway location. Dinner with my family; husband and kiddos meals are fine. I ordered the Steak Diane medium rare. It came out medium well to well done. Our server Amy quickly sent it back and gave me an estimated time of 8 minutes.  About 6 minutes later I got a dish that was RARE. It was seared for probably less than 60 seconds on each side. ONE small medallion was edible.  I gave up. Amy checked on me while she was balancing a tray of what looked like a dozen pink lemonades, however by that time I was pretty much done. My family was finished and I told Amy I'd just eat some of the mashed potatoes. She was more than happy to offer me something else but I just wasn't in the mood to wait any longer.  I did request to have the meal removed from our bill, which is fair at this point.  Well the manager (who I won't name publicly) decided I needed to be charged for a side of mashed potatoes (which I only ate about half of) Incredibly tacky!  I would suggest in the future that if someone isn't able to eat the meal they ordered to NOT charge them a side order.  Bad move management, especially since you didn't even give me the courtesy to show back up at the table and ask me about the second time my meal was prepared incorrectly!  I expect better from you Cheesecake Factory I would give Amy 4 stars on service alone, she was great!"
Mike S.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/6/2013,"Went to the local Cheesecake Factory for a date night with my wife. It started off normally enough. Excessive waits between server visits and long spells with empty glasses, but i've become used to this level of service from the CF. What really ruined the evening is when my wife's omelet arrived. She cut into it, worked towards her first bite and then pulled a clump of hair the size of a grape from the omelet. It was all she could do not to puke right then and there. Unfortunately, the (suddenly) attentive servers wisked the dish away before i could take a proper image, immediately destroying any proof. The manager (at least i think he was. he never identified himself) came up and appologized profusely (which i appreciated!) and asked my wife if she wanted anything while she waited for another omelet. She asked for a side salad.  At this point, i've put my food aside, because i'm not gonna eat while my wife waits. 15 minutes later the salad finally comes back. 20 minutes beyond that, the replacement omelet finally arrives. (My food is beyond luke-warm at this point. Ended up boxing it all up to take home and reheat) It was hair free this time. But then, they charged us for the side salad while she waited and for the omelet. I'm not saying we deserve free food, but c'mon. If i had been quicker on the photo-taking, this would have had an entirely different outcome.  I don't expect anything to come of this, but i felt it was my responsibility to alert other patrons (since apparently hairnets aren't a responsibility of CF). If you're looking to blow $50-$60 on a nice place, go somewhere else. You're wasting your money and time at this CF location."
Rolando C.,"Dallas, TX",23,17,,4.0,5/22/2014,"The food is good, served hot, and with flavor; there's a wide range to enjoy to please the palate. The cheesecakes are centerpiece and if you've never had one, you would be fortunate to enjoy one. The servers are excellent, prompt, and attentive to your dining experience. Host staff, likewise, are amiable and will accommodate seating preferences well enough. While lunch is a comfortable time to visit, it's also a welcome afternoon locale. In short, it is a sweet place for the cakes and a good plate for your day."
Aaron B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,24,,1.0,5/1/2013,"Absolutely disgusted. Me and my date get there, wait 40 minutes for a table, then when we are seated, we wait 10 minutes for drinks. I get my Jumbalaya, and the sausage is frozen in the middle, and the wine was horrible. That last thing may just be me, but I can't be sure. Every once in a while I think that this place just looses a customer down some sort of virtual hole, and it's sad. I'm angry if you haven't figured this out."
Nene S.,"Dallas, TX",0,10,,3.0,7/30/2015,This place gets packed all the time! I always loved Cheesecake Factory cause flavor is the same everywhere. Had the pork chop and it was so well done that you can't even bite it off. Other than that the sauce and potatoes were good
Anushree P.,"Santa Clara, CA",12,21,50,5.0,7/25/2013,"This is one place I would like to go everyday...I just love it.I am a fan of their skinnylicious   surprises me that a burger or a pasta could taste sooo good without cheese on it.The quantity is just perfect,never had to order a to go box.The staff has always been polite,service is   this is the Cheesecake factory..it has to be about cheesecakes-What to say they r simply yummy.The skinnylicious menu helps me to have a guilt free cheesecake..So I am really happy to go there."
Stephanie S.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,6,,4.0,8/22/2013,"I only got a chance to come for dessert, but I must say that I'm obsessed with the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake!! The moist red velvet cake, creamy cheesecake, and sweet cream cheese frosting taste delicious together. I'll have to go find a Cheesecake Factory back in St. Louis just for this cheesecake. ;)"
Fay S.,"Rowlett, TX",1,13,65,5.0,2/17/2012,"My go-to destination!  Casual but sometimes a bit noisy depending on when you go. If you plan on going at prime time... expect a wait... it is a busy and popular restaurant. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times and have never had a bad meal.  The menu is extensive to please anyone's taste, the portions are large (so plan on taking some home or sharing) and the food is consistent and visually beautiful to the eye. The fried calamari are the best I have ever eaten! The corn fritters... wonderful! The salads are fantastic and you can even buy the jars of salad dressing if you wish to take some home to make your own salad. Have never been disappointed here. And if you have room, treat yourself to a yummy piece of cheesecake!"
S H.,"Dallas, TX",57,25,,2.0,12/28/2013,There is 2 things I like here the service and the fact that they serve food late. Besides that the menu is never clean. Always sticky.......Always the baked potato soup seems microwaved. Coming from California Cheesecake Factory had high standards. In Dallas it feels very neglected hate to do it but only 2 stars.
Pamela E.,"Mesquite, TX",5,50,15,4.0,12/16/2011,"Awwww this place is the best.  Not only if your a cheesecakeaholic like my friends, but the food has always been spot on.  I had the chicken Pasta Da Vinci, with onions and mushrooms and a wonderfully rich wine sauce.,  Followed up with their Banana Cream Cheese Cake.  I like sweets but this wa s little rich for me, so couldn't finish it.  I would for sure say bring your friends, co-workers, parents and running buddies, this is a great place to eat."
Jon H.,"Dallas, TX",261,35,1,4.0,3/5/2011,"DISCLAIMER: This is more of a review on their cheesecake than anything else. The carrot cake, if you like carrot cake, is the best deal.  The height of the cake is about double the other cakes.  It also tastes reallly good.  It comes with your standard cream cheese frosting and they also add some cool whipped cream out of their fancy whipped cream machine. The Khalua cheesecake is a tad boring and dry.  It's too much sweetness in serving since the crust is oreo and the cake itself is really sweet already. Finally, the Pineapple cheesecake is the motherf'ing bomb!  It's pineapple upside down cake sandwiched in cheesecake.  Very refreshingly fruity and the pineapples and the pineapple upside down cake add different layers of textures that adds to the experience.   Oh and all the cheesecakes come with the whipped cream from the machine in case anyone was wondering, I don't know why I only mentioned it on the first cake."
Pam B.,"Austin, TX",6,10,,2.0,2/4/2014,"Food is greasy. Cheesecake is great only because it's delivered from their bakery in another, separate location. Hostess that usually that works there is rude every time; she doesn't look at you and it seems that she tries to mumble so that you can barely hear her. The managers always look like they are angry. Maybe they need to do a do-over of management for this location because if I see the staff angry, I know everything else will suffer including your experience. Thumbs down. This Dallas location was known as a great experience but it's gone way down hill. Save your $40+ for somewhere else."
Paul H.,"Dallas, TX",40,216,,2.0,5/1/2011,"To begin, this was my first visit to any Cheesecake Factory location, previously only knowing the chain through sitcom references. Overall, not impressed -- not even as good as some other national chains. The interior looks like some cross between a Disney cruise ship and a Vegas casino: way overdone in every direction. Doing brisk business at lunch, must be popular with a lot of people. The menu is a virtual novella, with pages and pages of anything and everything, which is suspect in a restaurant trying to be all cuisine to all patrons. I went with the daily special, pecan-crusted catfish and sides (soupy mashed potatoes and some veg medley) and ordered a small side salad along with it. Food was not too bad, even though everything was so heavily doused with butter that was all I could taste. I nearly did a spit-take when I got my bill: $26! Guys, it's just a piece of _catfish_, not Chilean sea bass. There is no cheaper piece of seafood, and last I looked the price of butter was quite reasonable. Did not try the cheesecake, but that's easy to find elsewhere. Overall, you'll have a better experience (and cheaper) with almost any other chain like Cheddar's, Chili's, Black-Eyed Pea, or even an Applebee's."
