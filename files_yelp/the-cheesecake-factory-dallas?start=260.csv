Megan S.,"Dallas, TX",223,627,243,2.0,11/4/2010,"Pumpkin Cheesecake was the mission.  Cheesecake Factory had it- but they offered some a disappointing experience. I've only been to Cheesecake Factories maybe 2-3 times.  But they're always located in upper-crust areas, and the reputation is of a nice place.   Our experience didn't hold up their reputation.  It's possible that it was just this particular night, and not this location... Decide for yourself. We got there around 9:30 on a Friday evening.  They're open until 12 or 12:30, so this is hardly closing time.   What happened:  We had to wait to be seated, even though the restaurant looked only about 50% full.  And two parties of 4 were seated before us (just 2).   The floor was NASTY.  First you notice the grease and slippery funk on the floor.  But once you start looking down- there's so much to see.  Stray utensils pushed up against the wall, large crumbs of food everywhere.  Do you not believe in sweeping after the rush, but before closing? An entire row of tables, I'd say about 7 were in need of bussing, with stacked dirty plates covering the table, and some of the chairs pushed out into the aisle. (Maybe that explains the wait to be seated?) Speaking of dirty- As the hostess sat us at our table, she reached with her hand to knock some of the many crumbs off our table onto the floor.  So I guess they cleared the dishes, but didn't wipe the table- there were a LOT of crumbs. One of our water glasses, had a piece of food encrusted on the outside.  Thankfully the outside- but how good of a wash did that cup really get?  Also, one of the forks had the same treatment, good thing they give you 2.   We waited a while for the one piece of cheesecake we were splitting.  Not 20 minutes long- but maybe 15- which seemed silly based on our order. The cheesecake itself: alright.  We got the pumpkin.  Really it just tasted like dense and cold pumpkin pie.  I'm not exactly complaining- I love Pumpkin Pie.  Just thought this would be a different spin on the pumpkin flavor. Disappointed is the best word for this experience.  I would come back, but if it was just as easy I'd pick a different location.  Also- on the hunt to try some pumpkin cheesecakes at other places, as this one was not all it could have been."
Sarah W.,"Dallas, TX",6,2,1,1.0,11/5/2013,I love cheese cake factory and never had issues until I went to this one. Service wasn't vey good and the tables where way to close together! But my problem was having  FOOD POISONING today!  I wouldn't recommend the Mexican salad. Worse experience at CCF!
Nikki B.,"Irving, TX",0,8,,1.0,1/1/2014,Cheesecake Factory-seriously? You can't afford wrapped butter pats and bottles of ketchup anymore? And crinkle cut fries?  Very disappointed. Used to be one if my favorite restaurants and likely won't be back
Caity N.,"San Antonio, TX",1,43,8,5.0,12/28/2013,"Visiting my sister an her three kids, all under the age of 10, with my mom for the weekend. We got a $50 gift card and thought this was a good opportunity to use it. The wait seemed pretty long, but maybe we were just too hungry to wait. As soon as we were seated, our waiter greeted us and was SUPER sweet and patient, especially with the three children. Brought us bread and all that jazz. The three of us adults all got the same thing, the southwest BBQ burger and WOW it was delicious. The kids got kids meals, Mac n cheese, fettuccine Alfredo, and chicken sandwich sliders. They were all satisfied. It was really a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone."
Elvia J.,"Dallas, TX",15,260,143,3.0,7/9/2011,"We stopped by for lunch and ordered an appetizer and a meal for each person.  The nachos consisted of crispy chips, an even amount of cheese and a spoonful of sour cream and guacamole. The meal servings were too much to feed one person; so next time, we will skip the appetizer. I ordered the crispy spicy chicken sandwich and was disappointed because it was dry.   Aside from mediocre food and good service, the fly situation really bothered me.  This is the second time I see flies (small black insects that carry germs) at this location.   It's gross to see a fly land on food when someone is about to eat it."
Camilla I.,"Dallas, TX",250,92,80,5.0,6/10/2013,I love this restaurant! they have a huge menu so be patient but I can assure you that pretty much everything I have tried has been outstanding . I definitely  recommend the curb side pick up as they are always so busy and I usually don't like to wait . they serve this amazing bread with all their meals and sometimes it's hard to no eat the whole thing!. try their stuffed mushroom and their fired artichoke hearts . their bar it's pretty amazing too with a great variety of drinks selections including the national drink of my country : Caipirinha!
Navn B.,"Richardson, TX",14,29,11,5.0,11/6/2013,"This location is awesome  , service time is just right . I come here like twice a month amd was never disappointed . There is ample parking around here and the curbside pick up service is really fast. Just like any other cheseecake factory plus awesome servie."
Julie K.,"Dallas, TX",0,20,10,5.0,2/26/2014,I love this place better than the grand lux!  Its the same company but just love the cheesecakes.  The prices are perfect for the size of the meal.  Always get a bacon burger with a mojito.  Snickers cheesecake is the way to go!
Bianca L.,"Garland, TX",6,186,716,5.0,7/13/2013,"We have been here many times and some of the favorites are Asian taco appetizer, calamari, samosas, and the bang bang chicken. The appetizer prices are reasonable and the entrees are big more pricey. We love the atmosphere, the food, just not the wait. In the evenings, it can take a long time to get seated due to being crowded. I guess that is when you know a restaurant is good!!!!!"
Dena F.,"Dallas, TX",922,1036,254,3.0,6/28/2008,"The menu is overwhelming, I mean it's spiral bound with advertising.  Unless you are selling me those shoes, do NOT put it on the menu.  It really is too much to consider, but luckily I knew what I wanted.  My friend came back from Vegas telling tales of a Kobe burger that actually tasted better than a regular burger, so I was totally game to try it out for myself.  And it was.  It was a darned good burger.   It was a terrific burger for free.  They accidentally gave my first burger to someone who ordered a turkey burger.  Once they bit into it they refused to give it up.  So I was gonna go over and fight 'em for it.  The manager came out and separated me and 'turkey-boy' and said he'd make me a new one...a better one...for FREE.  I said I supposed that would work, brought my gal-machismo back into line and went back to my table to sulk in KT's Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Had cheesecake for dessert.  Split the Dulce de Leche and the Chocolate Raspberry three ways.  The Dulce de Leche was really good.  The other one was kinda stale, too thick, and the fudge on top was on big icky piece that fell over and could not be eaten."
Jon L.,"Addison, TX",197,243,248,2.0,7/2/2011,"This place is going downhill.  Used to have stellar service, but not lately.  Last waiter was insanely neglectful.  Food came out lukewarm.  Portions are huge, for sure, but too much lettuce and not enough other stuff in the salads.  To put a piece of fish instead of chicken on the salad was a wacko upcharge of $9, which I paid, only to get a minnow.  Waiter should have told me it was bite-sized, since patrons expect more at CF.  As always, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake for dessert was great.  Don't skip dessert here - it's the best part!  Better yet, skip the meal and just have dessert in the bar after a better meal next door at Blue Mesa."
Yelp U.,"Dallas, TX",17,227,21,3.0,11/29/2014,"Cheesecake and appetizers were good. But the place is TOO noisy! You can't have a relaxing meal. Always so crowded and too loud, too stressful."
Diana D.,"Dallas, TX",413,693,344,5.0,12/20/2010,always yummy.  i always get my louisiana chicken pasta. delish in every way. also had the white chocolate macadamia cheese cake. DELISH!!!!  spinach dip was also delish.  the brown bread they give you for free is sooooo good. i gained 5 pounds today!!
Zandra E.,"Dallas, TX",667,482,78,2.0,5/4/2014,"I have a real meh/hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory and honestly, we've not been on speaking terms for a long time now. While I never had a bad customer service experience here and actually do like the desserts, the rest of the mammoth menu is a complete fail. Not only is the nutritional info not available on the website, but the food is notoriously unhealthy for no reason. I'm serious! You will be pickled by the time you leave due to the sheer amount of sodium found in their food thanks to people testing them to provide consumers a better picture of what they are eating. Again, I have no problem at all with eating unhealthy foods, but don't bill some things as healthy when they have more carbs, grams of fat, and calories than the worst burger combo you can think of at a fast food chain. Seriously, how do you make salads that high in calories and sodium?! Blah. So, unless you are really hankering to eat two-three days worth of calories in one day without feeling like it was worth it, I say avoid this place at all cost. If you are looking to pick up a quick dessert and are craving cheesecake or strawberry shortcake, this place may not be so bad."
Amber P.,"Garland, TX",1,12,3,4.0,2/6/2014,I love the food there and the cheesecake is always great. My favorite is the pumpkin cheesecake seasonal during fall. But I also love the red velvet or the Oreo cheesecake.
David G.,"Springdale, AR",59,169,180,5.0,7/8/2013,"Its a cheesecake factory, I have probably been to 15+ different ones..they are all fabulous..have huge portions and cause you to gain 2.3 lbs per meal."
Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62,4.0,3/3/2011,"We wound up here by accident a couple of weekends ago... driving around trying to decide where we wanted lunch. Started in Addison, wound up in Uptown, turned around at some point and ended up here at the Cheesecake Factory on Northwest Highway across from Northpark mall.  By the time we finally got here, it wasn't really lunch time anymore: it was around 3.30pm. There was a small wait, but it was just enough time for us to stand outside and my boyfriend to have a smoke.  We were seated at one of the small two-top booths near the front. Our waiter was pretty nice, and brought drinks pretty promptly.  The menu is absolutely gigantic, so it takes awhile to go through it and decide what you want. We thought we'd go ahead and order an appetizer... we were debating between the fire roasted artichokes and the fried artichoke hearts. Our waiter recommended the fire roasted ones, so we went with them. Of course, they were twice as expensive as the artichoke hearts, but there were 3 half artichokes, so it was quite a bit of food. They were delicious! Occasionally, we'd get a delicious flavor of grill and fresh pepper and some salt. Of course, whole artichokes are kind of a pain in the butt to eat, so you wind up with a lot of half-eaten/chewed on leaves on your bread plate.  So while they're delicious, they're a hassle. If you're trying to impress someone or on a first date, I'd recommend getting something else. There's no graceful way to eat half an artichoke like this, and you're going to have SOMETHING in your teeth afterwords. But yes, phenomenally delicious.  For the entree, I thought about branching out, but I wound up getting the same thing I always get: The Crispy Chicken Costoletta. So tasty! Yes, it's $16.50, but I got 3 meals out of it, so I think it's totally worth it. After filling up on the delicious warm bread and the fabulous roasted artichoke, I could only eat one of the THREE chicken breasts that came with my food.  It's three thin chicken breasts, coated in a tasty breadcrumbs (panko, maybe), lightly fried, and served with a delicious lemon sauce. The lemon flavor is definitely present, but not at all overwhelming or gross- both of which can happen with lemon sauce. The dish is typically served with mashed potatoes and asparagus, but I subbed broccoli for the asparagus, which they're always happy to do. The waiter says he does the same thing when he orders it. I really love it.. Even with the lemon sauce, the breaded chicken breast has just enough crunch on the outside, but is still tender enough to cut with a fork. It also reheats really well (and quickly, as it's pounded so thin). The mashed potatoes taste fresh, not instant from a box. The broccoli was mostly florettes- very low on stalk (personally, I'm a stalk lover, but I wasn't disappointed) and cooked properly. Food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time by a food runner.  Oh, one thing I found was super awesome? They brought us warm, wet towels to wipe our hands off with after the artichokes. Super awesome! Also, he brought more for my boyfriend when he ate his pizza.  Boyfriend ordered the Hawaiian pizza, and it was tasty, but not the best... they served it on a plate, and there's a chance that it sat on the plate for a little while before it was served because it was quite soggy in the middle. The crust had a very sweet and yeasty flavor. Not bad, but not exactly what I was expecting. The pineapple was clearly super fresh (not canned or frozen), which added a really good flavor and texture, and the Canadian Bacon was in big slices and not overly salty.  Oddly, even though I like the Cheesecake Factory's food, I'm not a super huge fan of their Cheesecake.. Their Original has a sour cream-type glaze on the top (no likey). Some of their specialty cakes aren't bad, but I don't go out of my way for any of it. Like I said, I know it's crazy. My boyfriend got a Carrot Cake swirled with Cheesecake, which I took a bite of... and it was pretty good. He wasn't enthused, but I don't know exactly why. I got the warm apple crisp thing. It was good, but damn it was huge. I could eat barely half of it-- and even if I hadn't gorged myself on artichokes and chicken/veggies.  I don't come to Cheesecake Factory often, but when I do, I know that the food is going to be tasty. Expensive as hell for a late lunch for 2 with appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts, and a soda... but tasty!  Call ahead on the weekends at ANY Cheesecake Factory to avoid a crazy wait."
Kelly R.,"Dallas, TX",5,10,2,5.0,10/16/2013,"My new all time favorite meal: Pan seared salmon with spinach and mushrooms in a lemon caper sauce and angel hair pasta! O...m...gee, PERFECTION! My taste buds just came alive while enjoying this meal. Portion sizes were large so I'll get two meals out of this. Our water glasses were never empty so it's an understatement to say that the service we received was impeccable. I want to go back for round two just to make sure this visit wasn't a fluke. Rarely would I give a visit 5 stars, but this time The Cheesecake Factory outdid itself and earned every star. Also, they have a new cheesecake: S'mores! I was so stuffed after my half meal but hey, I'm NOT gonna go to TCF and not get a cheesecake. That would just be sacrilegious! So I got the cheesecake to go...more on that later ;-)"
Anabel V.,"Dallas, TX",152,225,195,2.0,8/21/2012,"I don't know what everyone is talking about. Busy place, crowded place, raw chicken.  But the dessert is great.  I doubt i'll ever be setting foot past the dessert counter.  Get my sweets and leave.  Food is not memorable and i really don't feel like risking food poising..."
KayRon T.,"Plano, TX",37,57,2,2.0,7/25/2014,"All I (in a party of 3) ordered @ 10pm on  Monday was a lemon drop martini and a Cuban sandwich at the same time as the other 2 in my party (one of them who also ordered the same sandwich), however my adult beverage came out last. My sandwich order came out LAST and incomplete without my fries which I was told were being fried fresh. The other sandwich came out with fries AND they were hot and fresh. After 7mins I had to ask a 2nd server where my fries were, they came out immediately 1min later. My server who never gave his name ignored me every time I tried to ask for little things like ketchup, water. My check shows his name as Aaron. I understand it can be a thankless job as wait-staff, but if you can't handle it may there is a position better suited elsewhere. We were nothing less than polite, well-mannered and willing to tip VERY well. Cheesecake Factory is ALWAYS too dark to read the menu when it is not a true bistro for that ambiance. Our service at Grand Lux Café the following Weds however made up for it."
