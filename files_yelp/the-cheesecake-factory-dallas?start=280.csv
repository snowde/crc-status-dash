Anne G.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",0,9,12,4.0,9/1/2013,Blue Mesa was packed so we strolled over to Cheesecake Factory. Can't go wrong with the calamari and lunch portion of the Louisiana pasta.
Praveen V.,"Dallas, TX",74,136,27,4.0,12/5/2010,"I am generally not a huge fan of large chain restaurants. But Cheesecake Factory is different. No matter when we go and where we go, one thing is for sure - Consistency. Their food, deserts, and drinks are always great!  We went to Cheesecake Factory last night for dinner with a couple of friends. The place was jam packed as it always is. Cheesecake Factory is a big melting pot of people from various cultures and backgrounds all in one spot. I am not surprised of that since their menu caters to everyone's taste buds. You are sure to find everything from Burgers & Fries to Jamaican to Cajun to Asian to American. Wait, American is burgers & fries :)  I remember the very first time I went to Cheesecake Factory 10 yrs ago and I was just amazed at the sheer size of their menu. The fancy advertisements of high end cars, clothing, etc were always eye catchy, but seems like they have come a long way from that now. Given that they keep adding new items to their menu every year, they have reduced the real estate dedicated to advertisements significantly and focused the space on their top selling items.  Bang Bang Chicken has been on their menu for years but is now called Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta also has been there forever. Last night though, I decided to try their Salmon with Spinach and Mushrooms with Angel Hair pasta. I would not order it again as it was nothing special and was also a bit bland for my taste buds. However, the slice of Peanut Butter Reese's Pieces Cheesecake was worth the visit at the end.  Overall I rate Cheesecake Factory 4 stars for being a great neutral place as it offers variety of choices and serves good food everytime."
Cameron H.,"Dallas, TX",12,16,12,4.0,2/22/2011,"The first thing of note about the Cheesecake Factory: the portions are huge. I like this. I feel okay paying $16 for an entree when I'm able to take home over 50% for leftovers. My favorite dish is the Crusted Chicken Romano. They always get the cheesy ""crisp"" on the chicken perfect. The free warm bread (sourdough and wheat) and butter are incredibly good. I think that it's great that a restaurant named after a dessert makes really good desserts. The Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake and fresh strawberry cheesecake are my favorites. After all the bread and main course goodness, I absolutely must either split the piece of cheesecake with someone or take half home. The slices are generous and come with lots of whipped cream. Free valet is great, because parking is tight. Curbside pickup is available and I'd recommend it if you don't want to wait forever for a table (ask them to include your free bread!). At most dinner times, you'd be better off calling in a to-go order, poking around Barnes and Noble for 15-20 minutes, and taking your food home - you'd be eating your meal long before dining in. By 5:30 on the weekends, the place is CROWDED."
Francesca L.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1400,1391,243,4.0,3/14/2008,"As everyone has already mentioned, it's a chain! haha it's always pretty consistent when I have been. I have nothing negative to say about the place. The menu is huge and all the items unique, so I think that's why most people just stick with the same thing all the time. I love the sweet corn tamale cakes (appetizer), they come topped with onion, tomato, avocado, and sour cream. So delicious..I also ordered the soup of the day which just happened to match--mexican chicken. Lots of pieces of vegetable which did not seem canned or frozen to me, quite enjoyable. It is a little pricey, but the servings are pretty large so you can either share with a friend or have lunch for tomorrow."
Sean H.,"Dallas, TX",127,167,8,1.0,12/18/2009,"This was my third time to this location, and every other time I've promised myself never to return. I hope I keep my promise to myself this time. The food is less than mediocre, it is overpriced, and the waitstaff is overworked. The only redeeming factor is its cheesecake. Maybe it should stick to its name and only make cheesecakes and quit pretending to be a restaurant. My cousin and I arrived around 8:30pm for dinner, no reservation, and it's about a 30 min wait. That seems reasonable for a Friday night. I get the buzzer and we wait around 30 minutes until it buzzes. I take the buzzer up to the hostess, where she asks us to stand to the side a bit and wait to be seated, and we stand there for another 10 minutes waiting to be seated. If you're not ready to seat us, please don't buzz us. I had to ask what the continued wait was for, and then they finally seated us. Our waitress maintained a freneticism throughout the night that clearly was not her fault. She was clearly overworked, and for that I blame management. That being said, I think she was as attentive as she possibly could have been. Kudos. Anyways, we ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps as a starter, and we both get pasta dishes. When the lettuce wraps arrive, the bibb lettuce leaves that they gave us had holes all over them from pests (bugs, worms, or otherwise). Not the most appetizing thing to look at, but fine I can ignore it since it's not going to kill me. We wait a while for our pasta dishes, but then a waitress (not ours) comes by and tells my cousin that they had accidentally served his pasta to a different table and they would need to make a new one for him, so it'd be another 6-8 minutes. Mine, however, was already done, so they asked me if they should go ahead and bring it out or keep it under a warming lamp. This is what you call a lose-lose situation. My preference, of course, would be to have my pasta come out the same time as my cousin's, but this would mean it goes under a heat lamp for 6-8 minutes, and I already know how the pasta will do under those conditions. I would have liked them to make me a new pasta dish so that we both have fresh dishes at the same time. But that would mean they'd probably throw away my original dish, and I personally hate wasting food. So I opt for the 6-8 minute heat lamp tan. They attempt to ""make it right"" by giving us each a complimentary salad. Fine, we say (but my thought was, ""as long as it doesn't have holes in it""). So both our pastas eventually come out, and my penne pasta has of course dried out, and it's just not very good. Even if it hadn't sat under a heat lamp, though, it came across as something I could have easily made at home, and made it tastier. Finally, we get to dessert. Both are very good, but our waitress forgot to give us new utensils for the dessert. So, I ended up taking my dinner fork, running it through my napkin a couple times, and using that. sigh. I have no idea why this place even has a wait; it doesn't deserve that sort of patronage. It is overpriced undertasting food."
JetSetter M.,"Monroe, LA",0,199,83,4.0,7/28/2014,I eat a various Cheesecake Factory restaurants across the country...this is like all the others...super crowded and loud. I love the salads and several of the pasta dishes. The cheesecake is the star for me. I am a lover of the pineapple upside down. This location has very limited parking which is not great but the cheesecake is awesome!!!
Zayda L.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,2,5.0,6/26/2013,"I came here around 5 and I think it was great! The food potions are HUGE. The cheesecake was no exception, and it was delicious!"
Shannon R.,"Austin, TX",380,173,11,4.0,9/22/2009,"I've worked next to the CCF for over a year so guess where we go for office birthdays?  The food is always great and the service is good  but it's always more than I want to spend for a quick lunch. Spicy Ahi Tempura was my favorite thing on the menu until today. I ordered the Buffalo Blasts. They are like little buffalo chicken wontons and you get a ton of them for $9.50. I'm eating Round 2 of my leftovers right now and even shared 2 of them with my friends. Their new items are a hit with me. I can't find the name of my favorite one but it's just like a very good General Tso's chicken. I usually order one of the following: Greek salad Stuffed Dates Avacado Egg Rolls or the Crab Sandwich (Mmmm) but stay away from their nachos especially if you get them with chicken. I threw that in the trash and kissed my $12 goodbye on that one. We had red velvet cheesecake today. I can't stand red velvet cake but I sucked this thing down, at least my portion of it.  The service is always pretty good but sometimes it's too good. We only go for lunch and the staff treats your ""dining experience"" like you're on vacation. That's all well and good but not when you have an hour for lunch and don't have time for some leisurely 10 minute recitation of the specials. It took 15 minutes to get 1 piece of cheesecake to us.  It had a candle and some words in icing on the plate but that doesn't take 15 minutes unless you have to look up the spelling of Happy Birthday To You in the dictionary. Our waitress wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer so maybe she did look it up. Their iced tea is always watered down and I had to return the passion fruit iced tea. Ick! CCF is always a safe bet."
Emily S.,"Lewisville, TX",0,34,8,5.0,10/29/2012,"OMG so good. I love this place. I like how they have a separate 'skinnylicious' menu. Everything I've had is amazing. Their menu is a novel, so there is something for everybody. You can die happy once you've had the Oreo cheesecake."
Sunday W.,"Denver, CO",276,331,317,4.0,5/24/2010,"I had the Jambalaya pasta, my hubby had the baked pecan crusted catfish, mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. My daughter had the shrimp scampi, chicken madeira(?) and mashed potatoes.  Everything was good. The mashed potatoes were a definite hit with the both of them. My Jambalaya dish was good but was more spicy than creole tasting.  Overall though the experience was good. The waiter was very attentive which is a definite PLUS for me. Almost as important as how the food taste.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory for making my daughter's 13th birthday memorable!"
Everything Critic Z.,"Dallas, TX",1,27,,1.0,5/4/2011,"I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory, so I visited one with family. I ordered the Thai Curry dish that came with chicken and shrimp ( I can't recall the actual name). The food was eh, more of a sweet flavor with a hint of curry, not balanced at all.  Not worth the $18 price tag at all. The cheesecake I tried was the Snicker version.  The crust was bitter, as is usual for chocolate crust, but overall it was just eh.  Also, not worth the $8 price tag.   The verdict: A nice experience, but not for me."
Dave F.,"Irving, TX",2823,163,37,4.0,2/28/2010,"On a chain restaurants scale, this one is above average in quality, presentation, and ambiance. If I'm uneasy about anything, there's something artificial about the place. It feels like a New Vegas themed restaurant, where the restaurant is attempting to be classy while lacking real authenticity. It doesn't matter what kind of food you're into, the menu has enough variables on Americana you'll find something worth trying. Multiple pages of mind-boggling selection. I wonder why so many items? The food itself is good. I'd say some of the best for a chain. But here lies the authenticity question; the food lacks personality and flavor. It looks much better than it actually tastes in my humble opinion. My impression is the diners at Cheesecake fall for the superficial glitz of the place (setting and presentation), and fail to question the flavor of the food itself.  It's kind of boring to me. The place is an obvious local favorite, always packed, great location. And I think it deserves more than three stars for the overall execution of the operation. But still, I'm not particularly comfortable there, and I really don't love the food, so why bother? In Dallas, there's real dining authenticity to be had."
Sparkles B.,"Rockwall, TX",12,23,26,2.0,7/24/2009,"Okay... So I took my mother here for a girls night out and she hadn't been here before. We arrived at 4pm to an empty restaurant and were seating immediately. However, it took 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged and asked for drinks.  It then took another 10 minutes to get the drinks at which point we were ready to order. After taking our orders, she said she would bring us some of their ""delicious"" bread. Well.... 15 minutes later and NO bread! She comes over to see if we need refills and I ask if she can bring it. ""I'm so sorry""... The bread comes out with the food and was cold! Grrr The food was very tasty, had the fish and chips. When ordering cheesecake, we asked for it in to-go containers. She brings it out 20 minutes later on a plate. I asked her for to-go containers and once again, ""I'm so sorry.""  I will not be going back here. Not because the food was not good but for $25 a person, service should be a LOT better!!!!"
Tracy M.,"Forney, TX",137,36,1,4.0,5/13/2012,"No brainier. It's a consistent quality chain restaurant, good food with really good service. I love the bread wayyyyy too much, but only when its fresh. Love the smalls plates ESP crab bites or dynamite shrimp. Anything they have is great or they will replace it or make it right.  Again, no brainier and the cheesecake is simply the bomb. :-). Also shrimp and grits small and Reese's cheesecake.  Ask for fresh pasta. :-)"
David G.,"Dallas, TX",258,92,99,3.0,11/29/2010,Lots of Items on the Menu- But not a lot of different items- Food is OK for Lunch or Meeting Friends out at Night - I am not a big fan of Cheesecake So this may not be the best place for me - I was happy with the service and my Cuban Sandwich.
Shubz B.,"Millburn, NJ",1,22,,2.0,9/30/2009,"no no no no! How can you take good old cheesecake factory and ruin it!?! Not once, twice but on three separate occasions this cheesecake factory has been a huge let down! I'm a fan of their Evelyn's Favorite Pasta and drove the 14 miles just for a plate of the sublime pasta. But what a disappointment! They overdid the garlic and did not bother chopping the artichokes (just to name a few). Having had the same dish in 4 other cities, I know what to expect but when the same Dallas branch ruins a good dish over and over again - something's not right there!"
Michael S.,"Dallas, TX",5,24,36,4.0,8/4/2012,Pretty consistent above avg chain restaurant. I put cheesecake factory in the dining genre between a Fridays/chilis and a locally owned restaurant. This location is descent staff is always their with a smile on and the facilities are clean and plant of elbow room. Food B Facilities B Staff B+ Price C
Connor G.,"Dallas, TX",27,58,29,3.0,3/5/2010,"Cheesecake factory has a large, sometimes over whelming menu. I settled on the energy breakfast which is served all day.  It included a 8oz chicken breast with mushrooms, egg whites scrambled (4 eggs) and spinach.  Chicken was moist and tender. For an appetizer, I had the mini corn dogs. 4 to an order. The batter was not too thick and crispy - perfect! Now I don't have to wait for the fair for an excellent corn dog."
Wendell D.,"San Antonio, TX",168,52,81,4.0,1/14/2012,"I love it,,, I had Louisiana chicken pasta highly recommend"
Daniel F.,"Dallas, TX",23,87,36,4.0,9/2/2011,The food is great and so is the cheese cake this place is great for a date the atmosphere has a dim lighting which really helps for an imtimite setting.
