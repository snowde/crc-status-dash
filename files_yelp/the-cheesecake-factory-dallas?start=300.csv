Chris C.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,1,5.0,12/25/2008,"Ordered meals to go, great service.  They bring it to your car, you don't have to get out. I highly recommend the Steak Diane & Shrimp Scampi combo.  Excellent!"
Jay A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,,1.0,12/5/2013,"While the food was good, the service was atrocious.  We were a table of three- After bringing out two of the meals, the manager informed me they were out of the roast beef dish I ordered and that I would have to place another order.  They assured me they would place a rush on it.  After waiting twenty minutes, my substitute order arrived.  The other guests were done and the server had the nerve to offer them dessert, while I was just starting my main course!  Horrible service- won't be visiting this location again!"
alfred i.,"North York, Canada",75,44,2,3.0,8/4/2011,I've been more impressed with other Cheesecake Factory locations. Food was good... but not as good as I expected it to be.
Jonny S.,"Hop Island, Hop Island, Republic of Ireland",95,649,36,3.0,5/13/2013,"Hard to believe I made it to my mid 30's without ever going to the cheesecake factory.  Wife and I ventured out on a Saturday night to rectify that.  She'd grown up loving the one at the John Hancock Center in Chicago.  We passed the 30 minute wait time by snarkily commenting on what passes for ""going out"" clothing of the fellow diners, like we were judge's on RuPaul's Drag Race.  Finally got seated and we decided to just go to town.  I had the pomegranate mojito which was a bit too sweet, but still very tasty.  Got appetizers, mini-crab cakes for me, stuffed mushrooms for the wife, both fantastic...for entrees wifey got the jambalaya pasta which she has sworn to try to replicate at home, I had the Jamaican shrimp which could have been spicier, but was still good.  Ordered some cheesecake which was of course delish.  Is it a bit overpriced, yeah.  Not quite worth waiting a half an hour for, yeah, probably, but it was good food and a good time was had by all, so who am I to complain?"
Z S.,"Dallas, TX",0,27,,4.0,11/21/2011,"Been to this location 4 or 5 times with my wife. Great location, good service... I love their pasta choices. This place seems always busy, so the downside is waiting time can be up to an hour on busy days like a Saturday evening... They have a porch and the waiting time is less if you'd like to sit outside, depending on the time of the year (i.e. in warm or cold weather). Overall, we have had good experience."
Allison W.,"Dallas, TX",190,16,,4.0,12/21/2010,"So yummy and fattening. I can't get enough! I think the waitstaff and bartenders here are especially friendly as well. I love the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, it's delectable."
Jason D.,"Allen, TX",8,28,23,3.0,8/27/2011,Not bad. This is the 3rd one I have been too in the Dallas area. The service seems consistent with the others. Try the shepherds pie.
Nick S.,"Dallas, TX",144,85,1,4.0,6/24/2008,"It is possible to have too much of a good thing.   Case and point, Cheesecake Factory. I get it -- you guys can make any kind of food and then serve it in portions big enough to feed small Eastern European villages.  Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD.   When I was in college in Boston, going to this place was a treat.  I was poor and it meant that somebody's parents were in town.  At one point, there was nothing more exciting than catching the green line from Fenway Park to Copley Station, trekking across a cold, snowy night to the intersection of Boylston and Massachusetts Ave. to the Prudential Center Mall, where you would find the warm, welcoming glow of the Cheescake Factory.  There, you would meet a set of parents intent on stuffing your thinning frame with more food than you've had in the past thirty six hours -- all in one sitting.   But once I moved to Dallas and proceeded to take every single thing in my life for granted, I began to despise their overly large menu and fatty portions.   I tend to lean toward a restaurant that has sensibly filling portions and a menu that guides me through a culinary experience rather than shotgun blasts me with fusion after fusion of cuisine from around the world that have been forced together for the sake of novelty.   Like the Southwestern Egg Rolls.  Gimme a break. But I'm just reaching at this point.  Let's face it, Cheesecake Factory is a good restaurant.  I know most people probably love the huge portions and big selection, but as for me, I try and avoid the place if I can help it, if only for the sake of my waistline. Bottom Line: This place is a Friday's on steroids, but the food is actually good.  Order one appetizer and one entree for your table of four.  Not kidding.  Also -- try to come for brunch.  Four stars."
Kevin S.,"Cathedral City, CA",397,372,136,4.0,7/3/2011,Great Nachos   Great Potstickers. Great red velvet cheesecake :) I love this place. You get TONS of food for your money...if I leave there full....its a hearty portion :)
Mike Z.,"Dallas, TX",386,155,4,3.0,4/6/2009,"I ate here last week and it was a great time. Every time we go here, it is always packed. However, the wait is not long at all. This is a huge location. The wait staff is great and always around if you need anything. My wife loves the apple martini. The food was just like any other location...great. I have eaten at a few different locations across the US and the people here seem the nicest. We will be back...but this time maybe during the week.  MZ"
Jennifer R.,"Dallas, TX",6,19,,4.0,7/21/2008,"The food is fairly forgetable at Cheesecake factory, but oh...the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Yum, Yum, Yum.  This is my one and only reason for going here.  I'll admit we went for a girls night and the drinks were good, too.  That was probably the best food I'd had there, too.   I went again this past week and the cheesecake didn't fail me.  I ordered a crab wonton appetizer (don't waste the calories, go to PF Changs instead).  The power went out in the middle of our dinner, so it made for an interesting evening.  The waiters had to imprint our credit cards.  So...it took a while to get out of there.  But they were friendly and because of the delay started bringing our tickets as fast as they could so we wouldn't have to wait as long.  Not bad food, wonderful cheese cake, and good service."
Ziggy S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,202,11,4.0,5/18/2011,I've been to maybe 10+ locations around the US. I love Cheesecake Factory because of the variety of their food choices. Their menu is huge! Not to mention the selection of cheesecakes... I didn't even know there were that many types. I've never ordered a plate I didn't enjoy. Great chain.
Danny C.,"Dallas, TX",4,70,3,4.0,4/16/2011,"Like this place because I'm pretty local, again standard Cheesecake factory menu. Usually wait times are pretty good."
Rachel W.,"Dallas, TX",35,72,2,4.0,5/5/2008,"I think the cheesecake selection and their drinks are this place's saving grace. The food is always good - not outstanding, but good.  This is, after all, called the CHEESECAKE Factory, though. And sure, they have a massive menu, which would just encourage you to sample from it. But let's keep in mind how the place is labelled. ""Cheesecake factory."" They have lots of cheesecake, and that's what you can buy here. Sure, you might accidentally get dinner along the way - but I don't know that it's fair to criticize just the food. I don't know that I got my point across (judge the CHEESECAKE), but try one of their drinks, and it's not really going to matter, anway :)"
Frederick S.,"Irving, TX",106,109,4,2.0,12/25/2010,"Please go to the Cheesecake Factory in Southlake instead. The quality of the food here, the same dishes I've eaten at the Southlake Cheesecake factory, are poor by comparison. The service is rushed, perhaps because of the fact that they're a higher-volume location. The waiters/waitresses are forgettable, and the lack of an inviting atmosphere and caring servers makes me grateful that more than one CF location exists. I have gone to Cheesecake Factory about fifteen times in the last four months and am grateful that I've chosen to spend all of those visits at the Southlake location instead of this one. You'll feel like your money goes a lot further at the Southlake location."
Randy d.,"Dallas, TX",1,21,1,4.0,11/23/2009,"I am a fan of the Cheesecake factory. The food and service is very good. It is worth noting that the portions are very, very huge. The tostada salad is one of my favorite menu items, sans sour cream."
Aimee Z.,"Wylie, TX",677,661,18,4.0,6/30/2008,"Tuesday at 11am.  12 Co-Workers, including one birthday girl headed to Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I can't begin to remember everything that was ordered on this lunch excersion with my office as the table was much more spreadout this time and I couldn't even see what was going on at the other end.   I will note that the biggest complaint was the TEA issue.  They had Sweet Tea and Unsweet Mango Tea.  But is there any unsweet non-fruit tea to be had at a Cheesecake Factory?  Not, unless you want Green Tea there isn't.  This just doesn't seem like a smart idea to me. As appetizers, we had the Guacamole Made-To-Order and The Factory Appetizer Favorites Combo Platter which had a Combination including: Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, Pot Stickers, Summer Rolls, Quesadilla, Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts and Calamari. The meals that I can remember landing at our table were: Tomato Mozzarella Salad, Soup and Salad. Crispy Chicken Costoletta (x3), Crab Cake Sandwich, Teriyaki Chicken, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (x2), Miso Salmon, and some tomato-based pasta dish that was on the far end of the table I couldn't really see.  Everyone seemed to really love their meal and especially the three that ordered the Chicken Costolettea... when they realized there was enough food there for not only that meal, but a to go box enough for lunch for two more days. I had the Crab Cake Sandwich.  It was awright.  The crab cake was a little mushy to be sandwich worthy, although.. it did have a good flavor. We all skipped dessert because we knew that we had a Strawberry Cake from Aint No MO Butter Cakes (   ) waiting for us back at the office."
Tamara J.,"Rockwall, TX",3,12,,4.0,8/12/2013,Great food & service! And OMG do they have VARIETY!!! Can't go wrong taking a big group... Everyone will love the food!
Juan V.,"Garland, TX",56,101,176,3.0,4/15/2012,"I love this place but the menu is to extensive. I get overwhelmed personally when I see menus this big. I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy it. The menu really indicates that they like Italian food but there are other types of food. I never get salads. Why? I don't care for salads that much unless it's the waldorf salad. You want a salad? go to Soup or Salad. I go to these places to eat what they can create. That's just me. I had the Macaroni Cheese Balls and let me tell that they were worth it. My gosh. My son had their pepperoni pizza and it was just fine. The tea was watered down. I hate that. My wife had the Romano crusted chicken that came with what looked like plain spaghetti in an oragne sauce, not amazing but ok. I had the 4 cheese penne pasta with chicken. It was good and the sauce resembled a vodka sauce and it was  great. For dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cheese cake which was of course delish. Can't really say how soon we'll return but it is one of those spur of the moment type deals when you can't decide, so you choose a  good back up. Happy Eating"
Brooke G.,"Dallas, TX",67,230,59,2.0,4/14/2008,"This is another chain I just can't get into.  The first time I ever dined here, my sister took me out for my birthday and I didn't have a clue about the portions they serve.  They are definitely in the quantity trumps quality bracket where food is concerned. Their cheesecake selection is varied and I do love a good piece here and there, but their food just doesn't cut it most of the time."
