John C.,"Queens, NY",115,41,,3.0,12/9/2007,"It was about 10pm, practically everything was closed and i was craving mashed potatoes.  This was to be dinner and if I didn't catch something within the hour and a half, I'd be going to bed hungry. I didn't think it was possible but whateva, I powered up my computer and checked out some places nearby and I looked up Cheesecake Factory just for the hell of it. I was drooling over the menu when I noticed this icon for Take-Out.  Hmmmm.  It wasn't delivery.  It was call in and you pick up.  I was thinking to myself, yeah, but they're probably closed. I checked out their hours and lo and behold they didn't close till later....they were still open! Niiiiceee!! So I called them up and asked for chicken and mash and they said it'd be ready in 15 minutes. Niiiceee!!! I drove over, they're literally down the street.  I popped into the place which looks awesome for a date by the way.  Got back home and tried the food....it was ok.  not great.  just ok. At the point it didn't matter, i wasn't hungry anymore and I now know they do take-out service so we'll see how some of the other interesting dishes taste sometime in the future."
melanie p.,"Dallas, TX",10,24,,5.0,11/27/2009,"ha, i might get some heat for this...but i love this place! i went away for school... and when i would come back home to visit, a trip to the cheesecake factory was always on my agenda!  yes, it is a chain. yes, it is a bit overpriced. yes, some people say that this place is a ""jack of all trades, master of none."" but i still crave it! most of the appetizers are greatness...buffalo blasts are crispy and served with a chunky blue cheese dressing. the avocado egg rolls are creamy and crispy...and now they have a menu with smaller portions of ""starters"" that work great when you wanna nibble on something other than the free bread (2 types come to your table- both are great) when you order a drink. i normally order the chicken wraps- fresh veggies and noodles with grilled chicken that you wrap in lettuce cups- or a salad. yeah, a salad! but they are really good and have lots of different fixin's in them that give great texture to the bowl of lettuce. i like them all! the navajo sandwich is warm and tasty and the kobe burger is exceptional! all of the food comes in huge portions- but you GOTTA save room for dessert! cheesecake of course! (try the red velvet!!!) but the strawberry shortcake is just as good! seriously... i think i really like this place because i always feel a little classier when i am there (and the price reflects that) but the service is always GREAT! and that always gets my attention- they are attentive, polite and are just really great servers!  go for a snack, dinner, drinks, or just a big ol' piece of the decadent cheesecake!  ps: the shopping center can get crowded and crazy... so watch out for the park cities ladies in their SUV's- the parking spots are a little narrow!"
Erin B.,"Dallas, TX",3,39,,3.0,12/6/2009,"The last time we visited this Cheesecake Factory, we shared one of the huge salads. The waiter brought us am extra plate and let us split the veggies. He said, quote, ""the chef didn't want to split the salad and compromise the integrity of the dish."" I swear. That's what he said. Dude, you work at the Cheesecake Factory, not the Met!! Integrity of the dish. LOL."
Jessica M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",302,206,548,5.0,11/11/2009,"EVERYTHING that I have ever had from this place has been wonderful with the exception of the macaroni balls-or whatever they are called. Yup the dessert of course is amazing but the food is right up there with it! I love that they give you so much food. I like to order the parmesan crusted chicken and pasta-cant remember the exact name but it is so delish! The pizza is good, the steak is good, the burgers are good, the cheesecake of course is and also try the brownie sundae!"
Jennifer G.,"Dallas, TX",344,608,123,5.0,10/17/2007,"I'm sure it's not a huge surprise that I like this place too - given the glowing review I posted for Grand Lux. I absolutely love the Chicken Potstickers here and the Pasta Bolgonese( A Rich Meat Sauce Slowly Simmered with Porcini Mushrooms, Wine, Garlic and Herbs) is to die for. If I can I get them both everytime I go here. Once they were out of the bolgonese and I got the Crispy Pork Tenderloin - not a fan at all. My fiance had the Spicy Cashew chicken and liked it a lot. And every cheesecake I've had here was delicious - and the red raspberry martini is fabulous!"
Lauren T.,"Dallas, TX",589,274,1,4.0,7/24/2011,"I don't care if this place is a chain, I freaking love Cheesecake Factory. Especially this location. Everything I have ordered has always been delicious, and the menu is absolutely HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anybody can find something here that they like. And I mean anybody. The menu is about the size of a novel (I'm sure you already know this unless you've been living under a rock), and I especially love Cheesecake Factory when I am craving two different food groups at one time (for instance, wanting homemade guacamole and chips for an appetizer and then cheesy pasta for an entree). This place makes that dream come true while hitting each food group out of the park. Their fresh guacamole made-to-order is SO AMAZINGLY GOOD, and my favorite pasta of theirs is the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. I always order a side of alfredo sauce to drench this already cheesy pasta in even more cheese, and it is absolute heaven! The portions are big and you can easily split the appetizers and entrees. Other small plates/apps of mention are the fried macaroni and cheese (so addictive) and the sweet corn fritters (yum!). And of course, if you can fit it in your stomach afterwards... the cheesecake. But everyone already knows that. Anyhoo, I just wanted to get on here and give this location credit, because I frequent it a lot and I get so excited every time because I know I am going to LOVE my meal!"
Felice C.,"Duncanville, TX",4,122,29,4.0,5/14/2012,i had a 15 minute wait but it was worth it. great food big portions.i love the cheesecake.
Stephen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,,2.0,5/27/2011,"The interiors are overdone and the food is bland....it's way overpriced for the quality you get.   An attempt is made to compensate you by delivering extra large volumes of food, think super-size on the McDonalds menu.  No intention of returning."
the L.,"Dallas, TX",15,127,1,4.0,5/12/2009,"I like this place even though it's crowded and usually noisey and I don't usually like chains. We sat at the bar and the bartenders are very friendly and cordial. The salads are mostly what I go for, but the pizza is good too (thin crust). Also, the ""to go"" containers are #5 plastic which when rinsed are recyclable, not the norm in the DFW area. Would love to see that everywhere. I had a good time :)"
capriconrulez c.,"Irving, TX",0,29,,4.0,11/26/2011,"Very very nice place. Last year i celebrated my birthday here. I like their enchiladas with cilantro rice, crab cake bites and last but not the least PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN cheese cake. The staff is also friendly and helpful. Their menu is nice and huge to choose from (we like). Also the ambiance is nice and cozy. Also try cashew chicken, if u like taste of soy sauce. Ample of parking around. Situated on very nice place to take walk around after tummy full dinner."
Tracey W.,"Richardson, TX",115,131,,4.0,5/31/2008,"Okay...can I just say that I was not really looking forward to this when it was originally suggested?!  However, I was pleasantly surprised!  I am NOT a fan of cheesecake...or so I thought!  I decided to try the breakfast quesadillas...can I just say I could have split that with someone and still had plenty?!?  I was miserable and knew I had to save room for cheesecake...or some sort of dessert!  It was girls' night out after all!  I decided that I'd try a piece of cheesecake when I saw the key lime cheesecake! OMG!  It was fabulous...absolutely fabulous!  Then we got a white chocolate macadamia nut or something like that...and it, too, was FABULOUS!  I will definitely go back!  My son is a cheesecake fanatic! :)"
Sonia E.,"Dallas, TX",65,96,25,3.0,9/29/2008,Salads are very tasty and so are the lettuce wraps..MY FAV! I almost always order the same thing every time I go. I love to go there for birthday dinners or a tasty lunch. All the desserts will make you chubby but there soooooooooooo good!
Meli E.,"Bastrop, TX",44,117,42,4.0,10/7/2011,wonderful food!  but overpriced.  love their red velvet cheesecake!!!! I always order it to go after lunch or dinner!!!
Lynn H.,"Dallas, TX",6,26,6,1.0,10/30/2013,"My friends and I stop in frequently when attending a book signing at Barnes & Noble, however last Friday our visit was unacceptable even for a Friday in the late afternoon. The restaurant was half empty and we were seated to the left of the hostess stand, we noticed they were setting up for a large party right next to us, and our waitress informed us she would be passing us off to another waitress as they were expecting a large party. The party arrived and let's just say some people just don't know how to behave in public and the yelling and imposing on our meal commenced! We couldn't find either of our waitresses, a cook brought out the food. We finally were fed up(not literally) asked a passing waiter to get our check and left. We did stop by the hostess station to voice our concerns, but the could have cared less....I then called the manager on Monday and of course he was apologetic and promised to investigate and get back to me...after our experience I didn't have much faith in that and as this is Wednesday....my assumption was indeed correct. There are many options for drinks...lunch...dinner in that area and we will choose other options and I suggest you do the same...seems like a simple solution would have been to seat the rowdy party in the bar....or us in the right side which was half empty!"
Julissa E.,"Allen, TX",0,4,5,1.0,7/25/2013,"Went there last week and had good food but horrible service.  We were a party of 8 celebrating a birthday and waited a very long time for a table.  We were told upfront it would be 15 minute wait and it ended up being more than an hour.  After waiting 20 minutes we asked the hostess how much longer it would be and she said the table they were waiting on had just paid their check and they were waiting for them to leave.  15 minutes after that we checked again and they gave us the same story.  Not once did they try to make different arrangement of push a few other tables together.  There were at least 30 other people that were seated while we waited.  Parties of 2, 4 and 6.  Finally we walked around the restaurant and found a table and asked them to seat us there.  They agreed.  Our waitress was Amber and she was not attentive and not friendly.  We had to keep calling her over for refills and she never came by to check on us.  We asked other waiters around for sauces and more bread.  Food was good but that was about the only thing.  I will not go back to this Cheesecake Factory.  Cheesecake Factory Allen, TX it is for me!"
L P.,"Fort Smith, AR",16,68,16,5.0,9/4/2009,Went here for a late night snack. Cheesecake of course! Wait wasn't long. service was awesome! Conveniently located  across the street from NorthPark mall. Will return when I'm back in town!
Van P.,"Dallas, TX",91,278,1,3.0,12/19/2007,It's like a Chili's on steroids.  Expect to wait an hour for a table and to pay $5-10 more than the entree is really worth.  I genuinely like some of the dishes here and there-- the cobb salad and shrimp angel hair pasta in particular.  There's something just obscene about the size of the cheesecake slices.  Skip the sugar concoctions they call mixed drinks.
Meridith H.,"Dallas, TX",115,439,,3.0,7/2/2006,"The food is okay...for a chain.  The service is good...for a chain.  The cheesecake is great, but it is still a chain.  If you do not have a Cheesecake Factory where you live, then it is a good spot to stop.  Keep in mind that the portions are huge so sharing is always an option."
Jerry L.,"Westlake, TX",19,31,12,3.0,10/14/2009,"I'm completely tormented on why I don't rate this place higher. I mean they're a similar restaurant to their sibling, Grand Lux, which I absolutely love. They have excellent taste with the decor. They have giant portions of quality well planned and prepared food. And last but not least they have their famous cheesecakes with an abundance of different and unique favors. What sticks out in my mind with the many times I have been there is that none of the food draws me back to them. Usually if I truly enjoy the food regardless of my surroundings or service, I will always go back. Cheesecake Factory has never done it for me. I'm also disappointed they won't accept reservations considering every time I come here it's at least an hour wait. I also believe that the only reason why I keep coming back is because the girls I date have a high perception of this place. The cheesecake on the other hand is heavenly but I never take more than two or three bites of dessert so that won't justify me to go back willingly."
