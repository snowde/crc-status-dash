Heathe F.,"Fort Worth, TX",105,74,10,2.0,8/25/2008,"I have no earthly idea why I keep going to this place.  Maybe its the fact that I tend to date girls that go ape over this.....could be that I keep getting drug (or drugged) to this place.....regardless I've never had a good meal NOR a good experience.  Recently I took a date (or moreso she coaxed me into going) here and first we had to wait for thirty-five minutes (now the hostess said it'd be fifteen tops).  Once we got to our table it still hadn't been bussed (now I know fridays can be a bit busy, but c'mon) and we had to stand awkwardly amongst the other diners waiting for our table to be cleared.  Well once we finally sat and our drink orders were placed we waited a good ten minutes (does it really take that long to pour a beer into a glass).  Well........I remained calm as to not freak out my date........she decided we should get an app. to split so she suggested fried calamari.  Heres where the straw broke the camel's back..........by all outwardly appearances it was fried, but it tasted rubbery and it was COLD!!!!!!!!  We sent it back and asked for another order of the same (BIG FREAKIN MISTAKE).....came back the same way.....in fact now that I reflect on it I think she sent the same plate out again......well by now my date was aggrivated and suggested that we go elsewhere so I paid out our tab (w/the calamari still on it) and quietly made our way to the exit.  So to those of you who love this place fair warning.....DON'T GET THE CALAMARI."
Oscar S.,"Dallas, TX",1,8,,3.0,10/12/2008,"Cheese Cake Factory, Sunday October 12th 1pm Brunch - the Wait was about 20 minutes not too bad for a Sunday Brunch. There is complimentary Valet Parking which is great, because the mega Shopping Center is Packed with BMW, Lexus's, and SUV's. So we waited at the Bar where we were greeted by a great bar tender by the name of Patrick, Cute guy and very friendly. He did check ID's but I guess he was doing his job. We ended ordering our food at the bar. You can order from the brunch menu, lunch menu or dinner menu. I had the orange chicken which was Phenomenal.  They also have this tropical Ice tea that rocks. Patrick was professional and didn't get distracted when tacking our order when some classless bimbos yelped ""Excuse me can I get a drink"". He kept his cool, told them that he would be with them next and continued right on. I am a service man, and I give Patrick 4 Stars Out of 5. I give the food 3  1/2 Stars, and I give the atmosphere 3 stars, and my total bill with a mimosa was less than $20. So if you're looking for a great place for brunch, and don't mind the overcrowded loudness of families pouring in after church then you will like the Cheese cake factory on North West Highway."
