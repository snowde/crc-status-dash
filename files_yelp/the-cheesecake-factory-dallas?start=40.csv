Paul S.,"Deep Ellum, Dallas, TX",124,6,7,4.0,7/6/2017,"One of my best experience here ever! I've been to this location a couple of times and I am excited to come back soon. I had the chicken and biscuits and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  -the chicken and biscuits were alright, but the sauce is kind of bland it had a good seasoning of only salt but that was it. The chicken had a good texture but was covered in the sauce and the biscuits were actually very good.  - the Godiva chocolate cheesecake was amazing and had an a amazing cheeacakey texture it was fantastic. The service was amazing as well. My server's name was Mark and he was very attentive the entire time and checked on us often. And my favorite thing was that he was not over bearing or hovering. If I ever come back I would want him to be my server. I look forward to coming back and trying something new."
Kanika V.,"Irving, TX",46,6,6,4.0,9/13/2017,"We ordered lettuce wraps, jambalaya and cheesecake ofcourse. I did feel that the food is little less spicy for my taste buds but really good otherwise. A little pricy but really large portions to compensate for the same"
E. S.,"Lewisville, TX",1,17,8,5.0,4/24/2017,"Ribeye steak, mashed potatoes, and asparagus was really good and the service was great. I'll definitely be going back."
Mary A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,14,5,1.0,5/15/2017,"Chaos, terrible service, mediocre food. We went yesterday for Mother's Day. It was absolute chaos upon reaching their doors! I was appalled by how many people were just crammed together as soon as you opened the doors! I had anticipated a crowd and had called before asking if I could make a reservation, I was told reservations were only accepted for parties of 7 or greater. We arrived a little before 5pm. It was my husband, me, and our 2 daughters. We managed to squeeze our way towards their host station. There were several girls there huddled and frazzled. I approached them, NONE of them bothered to acknowledge me nor even make eye contact with me. I tried calling out to them above the chatter of the crowd, mind you I am standing directly in front of them. Finally one notices me, takes our name and hands us our buzzer, with a 45 minute wait.  At 6 pm our buzzer finally goes off. We squeeze through the crowd again up to the hostess. We show her our buzzer, she takes it and tells us to wait on the side...we stood there maybe another 20 minutes until finally our waiter shows us to our table. This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu had a plethora of meals to choose from so it took me a few minutes to decide. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, my husband ordered the Jambalaya, my daughters both had the kids' chicken strip meals, and we ordered the Avocado toast as an appetizer. I am so upset about my experience there that I have taken this time to explicitly describe our visit. Now, to me, this may not be a classy establishment, BUT going out to eat at any restaurant not considered a fast food joint, should take great stride and pride in presentation, preparation, and quality of their meals and service. In the food industry, especially, pleasing your customers is how your business grows and exists in the first place. I digress...so our Avocado toast arrived. For presentation, I would give it a big, fat, thumbs down. Now, we were starving, and after such a horrid wait, we were hesitant to delay eating any longer, so my husband and I both had a piece of the toast. The taste was awful. We ordered the Avocado toast, what we got was guacamole, slathered sloppily on toast. Had it been good guacamole, our hunger would have allowed us to look past that, unfortunately, it was brown and tasted awful. I eat avocados every day, so I know old avocado when I see/taste one. As hungry as I was, I refused to keep eating it. We let our waiter know and he said he would see what could be done since half the toast had been eaten! A manager came by and was hesitant to help. He offered to make us another one, a fresh one, we were still paying for it afterall. A new toast did arrive, no brown, still guacamole. We said nothing. My husband's jambalaya was okay, definitely not an authentic jambalaya but not terrible. My chicken Bellagio was mediocre. It was two halves of chicken breast with some sort of panko crust on it. The pasta underneath is was a tad bland but not awful. Now my daughters' chicken strips were BAD. I can't believe whoever cooked them even passed them along to be served. They were overcooked to say the least. The batter was burnt and had a burnt, salty taste.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake, it was good, turned out it was on the house when we got our bill. After this epic fail, I will never return to this establishment. I don't care if they'll use the holiday as an excuse. It is poor management and poor organization and service of their employees. The place was chaos! Couldn't even distinguish the line for their bakery and the line waiting to be seated, let alone those entering and leaving the restaurant.  They need a more efficient method for seating their customers and definitely an update and revision to their food!"
Nisha R.,"Dallas, TX",168,157,565,3.0,7/30/2016,"I like this place! I do think it's overrated. The menu selection is out of this world. They have everything you can imagine. The food is good, but not great. I think they need to cut down on the menu and work on making the food great. I usually order the Miso Salmon and it's very tasty. Today they brought me a burnt piece and I sent it back as it was unacceptable to eat. They replaced it quickly and he second time it just right. The cheesecake selection is great. My pecan turtle cheesecake is always yummy to my tummy! Overall besides it being pricey it is a fun atmosphere!"
Ricardo P.,"Terrell, TX",69,10,4,4.0,8/20/2016,Love everything about this place! I am an average American & I demand sitting benches for the people waiting outside the building! ;) add them I'll give you 5 stars! *****  Ps. The a/c dripped on my friend...he told me to add that! (The lobby)  Ps. Ps. It just dripped on me too lol no worries though
Misha H.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,3,,1.0,11/23/2017,"I had THE worst experience here. I love Cheesecake Factory but this one was a huge disappointment. I ordered curbside to go it took forever then when I got my meal they completely left the shrimp off both dishes. Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta and the SHRIMP and sausage pasta. Like really??? No shrimp on the shrimp and sausage pasta? So while I went inside to let them know, the waitress bought our second bag of food to the car. My mom realized the fries for my daughter weren't in the bag and the waitress all but accused my mom of hiding the fries to get more. She ""knew"" they were in the bag because she put hem there. Meanwhile when she came in as I was talking to the manager to get my food fixed she says oh I also left their fries out completely my fault i didn't put them in the bag. But you literally just told my mom you did. Finally got my food, three measly pieces of shrimp on each plate that are now pretty much a separate dish bc they don't have any of the dish's flavors, then the fries and then had to wait for the bread we had requested.They offered nothing for the trouble hell not even a glass of water just had me wait the 30 extra minutes and sent me on my way. If you want great service DO NOT go here. They are a terrible establishment!!! Find another one!"
Kathleen M.,"Denver, CO",81,80,150,4.0,8/5/2017,"If you can't find something to eat here you're nuts!! There is everything from light to super rich! Pizza, pasta, Asian, name it. Gluten free. Healthy. Then let's talk about dessert. CHEESECAKE CHEESECAKE CHEESECAKE. The Oreo on top of the slice  of Oreo cheesecake is a real GIANT Oreo. Yum! The wait staff is super nice!"
CJ M.,"Irving, TX",0,9,2,1.0,3/26/2017,"Ordered a ""medium"" steak.. it came out well done.. while the rest of my party ate their ordered dinner, I ate French fries and ketchup. Manager did come out to apologize and said they would get it right, so I gave them another chance, 20 minutes later, another steak comes out, the manager asked me to cut into it.. I did, and with all suspense, it was more done than the first. All I could do was laugh. It's not very hard, I've cooked better steaks on a George Foreman grill on the tailgate of a pickup truck. The cheesecake, to my surprise was good.. lol The bread was by far the highlight of my dinner, the Corona was the 2nd."
Maribel J.,"Dallas, TX",6,31,4,3.0,2/1/2017,"3.5. Came here on Friday and it was the worst mistake ever! The wait time is RIDICULOUS. If you're willing to wait then this restaurant is for you. Luckily, they had the patio open with the heater lamps on so we sat outside.  Our server wasn't friendly, a bit rude in a way. No conversation at all. We still left a good tip because we're used to that. My husband ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables which turned out to be delicious. It's probably one of the best steaks I've had. My chicken pasta wasn't good compare to other times. It was so watery with no flavor. The bread they give you is good specially the brown one. Piña coladas are the best! Strawberry, banana or red velvet are my go to cheesecake. Make sure you get dessert."
Rachel R.,"Dallas, TX",722,938,2737,4.0,8/29/2015,I love the Cheesecake Factory. This is a great location with easy access to valet parking. My husband and I like to come here every once in awhile to enjoy the delicious cheesecake! My favorite is the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. He enjoys the Reese's one.  The food always comes it with portion sizes big enough for two people. It makes nice for leftovers it easy to split.  We will be back!
Adri L.,"Dallas, TX",4,12,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"Such terrible service. My husband and I made a quick stop to pick up some cheesecake. While we were waiting, there were about 5 employees huddled up talking. As soon as the customer in front of us left, they came over to  the cashier who was helping us and started laughing. They had been making fun of the customer's backside. They went on and on about it. On top of that, we waiting for our cheesecake for about 5 minutes before realizing that it was already at the counter....it just hadn't been bagged or given to us. The cashier was on the phone and avoiding eye contact while the 4 ladies behind the counter were just chatting. We finally had to flag one of them down to help us out."
Okon E.,"Garland, TX",124,9,,5.0,8/25/2017,"This was my first time at cheesecake and I had an incredible experience. My Server Starve really took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed at all times. And besides the service, the food was great too. I loved all of the cheesecake, and the prices weren't bad either. Will definitely be coming back soon for my next celebration."
Kyle J.,"Dallas, TX",6,28,8,2.0,4/2/2017,Very disappointed after getting the steak medallion. They came with two cut up pieces so it looks like four. $18 and no real side to speak of. Plus my cheesecake was frozen.
Victoria E.,"Dallas, TX",103,185,292,4.0,6/26/2016,"Great food, service, and lively atmosphere. I treated my friend to a birthday brunch and we had a great experience. Upon arrival we were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter. Our waiter was very helpful, friendly and comedic. He truly contributed to our satisfaction. I ordered the chicken and waffles and replaced the poached egg with scrambled eggs. My friend ordered the bruleed French toast with bacon and a side of eggs. While we waited we were served a basket of bread, the wheat roll is delicious! Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. My meal was delicious!!! The chicken was cooked well and the potatoes that come on the side was well seasoned. We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back."
Chelby R.,"Dumas, TX",76,3,,5.0,8/15/2017,"Friendly service, amazing food that came out fast, and a happy family. This is a have to for anyone visiting Dallas. Our waiter, Richard, did an excellent job of keeping the mother happy and did everything he could to make us feel welcomed. Thanks again"
Vialeta K.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,5.0,8/13/2017,"My order was salmon without oil, without salt, butter and cream. My order was executed very correctly. I am very pleased))"
James S.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,1,1.0,7/30/2017,"We were at this location saturday evening, got a seat at the bar area and the waitress was extremely slow and unfriendly her response to every request was ""it will be a minute"" asked for our table to be cleaned, asked for water, bread, and the main food order,  the water eventually came when a manager stopped by 20 minutes later and asked how we were doing. Lack luster experience at best, cheesecake factory is normally on top of it, but we will definitely think twice before choosing this location again."
Coco Z.,"Dallas, TX",23,167,18,2.0,5/28/2016,Great service  Food is not memorable  Cheese cakes are too heavy for my taste I'm have been here multiple time and never completely happy with dishes I tried
Mike T.,"Addison, TX",0,29,,2.0,9/8/2016,"Cheesecake Factory used to be our family favorite place.  But the quality of food and service has gone down.  This is my experience eating here on 9/8/2016. The food:  3 of us ordered 3 entrees (fried catfish, factory meatloaf, factory burger), 1 appetizer (calamari), 1 drink (passion fruit magarita), 2 cheesecakes (red velvet, s'mores). Total cost $95 before tip.  Sort of expensive for the quality of food. The food: The drink was pathetic.  A lukewarm magarita that tastes like cough syrup and costs $11.25. The bread (pumpernickel and sourdough) was nice.  But the slices were all unevenly cut. The calamari was greasy, The presentation was poor with a wilted piece of parsley thrown on top of a tub of marinara sauce. The entrees were all right. Nothing special but the portions were large.  Enough leftover for a second meal.   The cheesecakes were good.  Presentation was poor.  One piece of cheesecake fell on its side when it was brought to the table. The service: The waitress was unfriendly.  Sloppy to say the least.  Threw stuff on the table.  Refilled water only once.  Put drinks on table without coasters or napkins.  Overall, the experience of eating there was very uncomfortable. The food and experience is not worth the cost.   I would come back if they cut the price in half. ### in response to the comment from business manager of cheesecake factory ### Hmmm.  I think many people are like me when having a bad experience with a restaurant... just end it and move on. Complaining about the food or waitstaff may end up with something EXTRA in my food. ###"
