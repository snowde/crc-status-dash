Avery K.,"Hurst, TX",208,3,1,1.0,4/20/2017,"Had been wanting to try this out, it's been over 15 years since I've been to one, and let's just say it'll probably be another 15 years or never. I have never felt like I was spoken to so poorly at a restaurant before. One of the hosts spoke to me in a very rude manner, thankfully I was getting my food to go. I don't want your business, or your poor customer service. Very disappointed."
DeAndre C.,"Haltom City, TX",161,54,78,3.0,10/26/2016,"The waitress took forever to get me my drink! But the food did come out quick and also the food was good! I will advise you to try the crab and artichoke dip it is so good! I had the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was good but for a Thai food lover it wasn't the right amount of spicy for me! You would almost have to add some spice later on when you get it home or something.... if they had the right amount of spicy in it, it would def be a favorite on the menu more than it already is...."
Glory N.,"Richardson, TX",0,6,5,3.0,6/11/2017,"I come here often for their pasta and cheesecake. However, when I ordered for pick up, the girl on the phone was not pleasant, she didn't repeat my order and sure enough when I came to pick up my order, the girl at the counter was very rude and messed up my order. Also, instead of redoing the mistake, they just cut my food in half and gave it back to me"
Destini O.,"Dallas, TX",2,16,15,1.0,8/13/2017,"I'm come here a lot and I mean ALOT. But today it's obvious that this place has gone way way way down. Came here for a birthday (which was ruined) had a waitress that didn't care at all(Ashley). Our table at sat there for 15 mins without being recognized and then Ashley comes over with a bad attitude. Was told there was no brown bread for the day but the table next to us had brown bread and later found out it was a lie. We ordered appetizers, drinks and food all at once since it wasn't that busy but just to knock it out. We then got a new waiter Justin who said there was a shift change. We never got the appetizers food came out an hour later. And drinks had to be told several of times how to make. The manager came out trying to make things right but didn't said he would get the appetizers out immediately...it took another hour to come out. All in all birthday ruined with horrible food. And out of over $200 dollars for horrible service and food. Done with this place and I will definitely contact corporate about this experience."
Henry J.,"Arlington, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2017,Terrible experience. After waiting over 30 minutes for the food. My wife got a hamburger and I ordered the Steak Diane with shrimp scampi. What a disaster. The mushrooms on the steak were charred to a crisp. It appeared that they had been burned and yet they decided to bring out the dish anyway. But wait there's more......the manager came to our table to address the unappetizing meal. She was extremely insensitive and notified me that it would be 15-20 minutes to get a replacement dish. I declined the offer after my stomach churned from the sight of the disgusting look and smell of the dish they presented me earlier. I ate from my wife's meal. It wasn't just the meal that disgusted me but the actions of the manager who really didn't give a Fuck about the service or food.  This place should close down and find new management. Will never eat here again and I would not recommend you eat there either.
Ivis A.,"Lawrence, IN",152,12,3,1.0,3/24/2017,"Horrible service, unfriendly staff, my food came out 30 minutes later than my dates and it was all burnt. Had to constantly get the waitress attention if I needed something. Not a good experience."
Mickey A.,"Dallas, TX",52,87,90,5.0,2/27/2016,"Great place  Great service Great food Nothing else can be say about the Cheesecake Factory , it's really a  restaurant in my opinion ."
Tiffany H.,"Garland, TX",2,5,8,5.0,4/23/2016,Food:  I got the pasta with shrimp & sausage. It was yummy but I think I still would prefer the Louisiana chicken pasta (I m have gotten this dish in the past). However the pasta with shrimp & sausage was still amazing! Service:  The girl that was waitressing my table was so adorable! She seemed so genuine and happy to help! I didn't catch her name but the service that she gave my table really turned 4 stars into 5 stars! Although we did have to wait an hour and 45 minutes for our table. Which is understandable since it was a Saturday during dinner time.  Overall I had a good time & would recommend this place :)
Best R.,"Dallas, TX",42,34,1,4.0,3/19/2017,"I started coming to The Cheesecake Factory about 15 years ago and I would usually get pizza because it's so delicious and the menu was huge. I now still come occasionally and I love the meatloaf, herb crusted salmon, cuban rolls, and desserts (especially the cheesecake)! You have to love the free fresh soft yet crispy bread. The food is delicious. However, certain dishes could be be better and the menu is so loaded it can be overwhelming. A few years ago for example I ordered some kind of shrimp dish and the shrimp they use is very fishy. I'm a huge shrimp fan, but couldn't handle it, so I simply never ordered it again. The service is good, but could be improved. I love the artistry and design of the restaurant because it's absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere is way too loud just because they are always so busy. I feel like they need to open another location in Dallas."
Chris D.,"Warrington, PA",27,62,,4.0,9/10/2017,"I recently visited The Cheesecake Factory and had a wonderful dinner.  The bacon cheeseburger was excellent with tons of bacon and even pork belly.  It added a real gourmet twist to the burger.  The burger was also cooked to perfection!  I love the Thai lettuce wraps at the Cheesecake Factory as well.  Excellent, friendly, and attentive service too."
Cristina B.,"Dallas, TX",0,9,,5.0,4/28/2017,"This place is the   lol, I love the service each time I visit this place (the one by North Park Mall). The salads (yes all of them) are just plain awesome! Piña coladas are on point  & of course if your a cheesecake lover you must visit this place!!!!!"
Jeremy O.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,2.0,9/4/2017,Congrats for letting me pay $100 and not put the bread in our delivery order you abject losers.  That's the first thing out if you're actually at the restaurant.
Ryan H.,"Dallas, TX",226,129,70,3.0,5/27/2016,"Not worth the _____. That blank can be filled with: waits, price, you name it (and yes I said ""waits"" with an s; twenty minutes after their original estimated wait time, when your buzzer finally goes off, there's another queue, awkwardly in the way of food runners, before you ACTUALLY get seated). If Tolstoy were in charge of making a menu, I would expect it to be slightly shorter than this. Somehow with boundless options, the macaroni and cheese burger seemed the way to go. I expected a cheesy mac to sub for cheese (like the queso in a queso burger I recently had elsewhere). Instead, it was a relatively flavorless ball of fried rigatoni with only a hint of cheese. What it lacked in flavor, the macaroni ball added in sheer height to the burger, making a detachable jaw a near necessity when attempting a bite. Choosing a cheesecake, the very namesake of the entire restaurant, was another dilemma. Should I go simple? Fruity? Chocolatey? I couldn't refuse the  mango key lime. Apparently I also can't assume fruit based cheesecake is even remotely naturally flavored. I think the syrup from canned peaches are more natural than the orange goop on top. The lime flavor was weak too.  The food was satisfying, and it's not as if anyone's saying it's the best restaurant in town, but the hype/price/waitS to quality ratio is too dang high."
Sue D.,"Sparks, NV",0,14,,3.0,1/9/2017,"Staff okay; but they tend to nickle and dine you for extra dressing, sauce for cheesecake, etc. The Shelia Salad only has a little chicken breast on ig; they tend to overcharge for salads; best to get an entree or go to another restaurant for a salad."
Ashley K.,"Dallas, TX",1,31,,4.0,10/19/2016,"Came here on a Saturday night, the place was packed. 15 minute wait, no big deal. That's a Saturday night out in Dallas for you! We chose the warm crab and artichoke dip for appetizer - it was good. No show stopper, nothing out of this world, just good. I had the Chicken Madeira as my entree... It was okay. The cheese just tasted awkward, fake almost. My husband had the Steak Diane, he liked it. Nothing to brag about. The ultimate safe zone for this dinner was the dessert, we had the turtle cheesecake - now that was the bomb! (Surprising? As it is known for it's Cheesecake?) For the price paid, I think we'll just stick to grabbing dessert here in the future.  Service was good - our waitress was extremely friendly. As busy as the place was, she was surprisingly very attentive."
Persia A.,"McKinney, TX",308,397,357,4.0,12/6/2015,"Usually crowded, but that's to be expected in an area like this. Right across from North Park mall and immediately off 75, they do also have outdoor seating, albeit small - but with heat lamps! We had the option to wait 20 mins or sit immediately outfit. We sat outside and had great service. It is a little weird having passers-by stare you down, but I guess that's what you sign up for.  We ordered as an appetizer the assorted eggrolls (forgot the menu name) and although it was good, it was very filling for two people to share.  Here's the rule about The Cheesecake Factory: everything is giant. And fatty. By the time we finished out appetizer, we didn't even out a dent in our entrées. So in retrospect, I probably would have maybe ordered from the Small Plates menu for my ""entrée,"" and we were pretty hungry! Also keep in mind they bring you free breads and butter before the meal.  The ambiance of this place is a nice-casual, a good place to take a date. You COULD go in in jeans, but if you're paying $15 min for your entrée alone, at least wear a nice top."
Lisa T.,"Chicago, IL",243,173,699,2.0,8/1/2015,"Food (3/5) In celebration of National Cheesecake Day, boy and I came in to pay our respects. We had the complimentary bread (shoutout to the phenomenal brown wheat bread!!), entrees, and a slice of strawberry cheesecake. My entree order was the Shrimp Bistro Pasta. Tossed in a lemon cream sauce, the spaghettini also contained battered shrimp, tomato, arugula, and mushroom (though I asked for the mushrooms to be removed). The pasta tasted great for only two bites because it was so stinkin' RICH. The cream felt extremely heavy and ultimately made me feel sluggish and gross for consuming so much. Now, also consider that the portions at Cheesecake Factory are HUGE, thereby making the whole eating process completely uncomfortable. For future visits, I'll probably ask the waiter to box up half my order ahead of time, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like I was going to have a heart attack afterward.  And we hadn't even had the cheesecake yet!! Granted, the cheesecake was a good level of fluffy, so it may not be to people's liking if they prefer the ""harder"" cheesecakes. Crust was delicious but I could probably do without the excessive amounts of whipped cream. I could see it being too overwhelmingly sweet for some palates as well.  Service (0/5) One question can summarize our service experience that entire night: where is our waiter??? We were there for about 1.5-2 hours from initial seating to final payment of the bill. I understand it can get busy, but I would have appreciated a slightly quicker pace and/or more transparency in his slowdowns. Atmosphere (3.5/5) Decor in Cheesecake Factory is the same as all others nationwide. Plenty of booth or table seating in hues of brown and beige. I would have given a 4 for atmosphere but it felt way too crowded and the tables were packed next to each other.  Bottom Line Food is good up to a point but it's extremely heavy and rich so I'd probably try to better portion control next time. Had very bad luck with service so hopefully it's better next time."
Paul S.,"Terrell, TX",20,36,81,3.0,7/11/2016,"We arrived on a Friday night June 9th around 5:20 pm. We got our food around 6:30. Waitress only checked us a few times. Portions were large - we took leftovers home. Food was fantastic.  Crab/ aertichoke fondu was awesome.  White chicken chili was awesome. Has a little kick to it.  Grilled pork chop was to die for.  Add a $10 pina colada, a sweet tea, and tiramisu cake and we spent over $70.  Three stars: long wait and sllloooowww service."
Manali M.,"Plano, TX",19,152,408,3.0,9/3/2015,I've eaten here several times. They have the most extensive menu imaginable. But they manage to make pretty much everything reasonably good! Had lunch here with coworkers recently and ordered the Falafel kale salad. Taste was pretty good but the kale was drenched in dressing and the falafel a were not crunchy like I'm used to. Don't recommend ordering this.
Angela D.,"Dallas, TX",0,10,8,1.0,2/1/2017,"NICHOLE is the worst server ever at this location. I am only giving her 1 star but the location and food is 5. I came here Monday for lunch with the bf to celebrate a BIG promotion for work. We got the fire cracker salmon, Jambalaya pasta and Chicken Bellagio.  When we were done eating the pasta, we waited for 15 mins for her to get back to our table and all she said was ""I'll come back for some to go box"" since we have some left over pasta. She didn't even bother to ask if we need or want something else. Mind you, she passed our table a few times ignoring us for the whole entire time. Well she actually filled our water glass one time and we had to ask her for that. The other server who passed our table was too nice and asked if we need anything else... I asked if I can speak to a manager instead.  We wanted to get 2 cheesecakes and coffeee as well. We came here to spend money and celebrate but she is really not worth my time and my extra tip. She is the worst!!!   I've spoke to the manager and told him about Nichole. He apologized, and then offered to comp our cheesecake (he asked if we can meet him the take out area).  We got our check and went to the take out area to get our cheesecakes and coffee too. The manager who offerred to comp wasn't even there to meet us but it's ok. We were't there to get anything for free anyway but we were also kinda expecting him to be on top of it because I was really disappointed at that point and that server ruined our celebration too. I tipped the server at the take out area because Nichole doesn't really deserve any extra tip from our bill.  NICHOLE is here for lunch and I don't know about dinner but AVOID her at all cost. She doesn't seem like she enjoy this job or she been here long enough and bored about it.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE."
