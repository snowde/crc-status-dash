Diane D.,"Rockwall, TX",323,384,282,3.0,8/21/2014,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory today for lunch with a group of 11. We started out with a waitress who couldn't remember the day's specials and she took one drink order (mine - for an iced tea), and then she mysteriously went AWOL. Five minutes later a gentleman with a loud voice came over and announced over the din that he would be taking over as our waiter. He seemed very capable and adept at handling large parties. A couple of the orders got mixed up and had to be sent back for a re-do but overall the experience was good. I ordered the lunch portion of the chicken carbonera. It was plentiful but I expected the sauce to be a little richer and creamier and not so watery. It's very rare that I've been to Cheesecake Factory and not thoroughly enjoyed my meal, so I would have to say this is a first. Fortunately, I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and I KNOW it will be awesome! Update: I have now dived into the piece of Chris' Outrageous cheesecake that I purchased earlier today.  Oh my gosh, this cheesecake is to die for!!!  Who cares how many calories this bad boy piece of cheesecake is packing!  Not me, at least not today!!!  Thank you cheesecake gods!  I've updated my rating from 2 to 3 stars.  The cheesecake alone deserves 5 stars!"
Ramon O.,"Dallas, TX",103,3,,1.0,3/5/2017,"This place is alright. I ordered a Mac and cheese Burger and it came out more like Mac and Shit looking burger.  All I'm saying if I'm going to pay for a almost 14$ burger at least make it look good. The waitress was great, did an awesome job just the food was shit ! For a somewhat fancy place at least make the food look better !! Probably more then likely won't be back to this place ! Would rather drive the extra 20 mins to go to then one in Allen !!"
Sally L.,"Waco, TX",6,1,7,4.0,1/7/2017,The food is very good as always. My friend ordered a steak as medium rare but the kitchen got it wrong and made it standard. The manager apologized and  got it back and made a new one for her and gave us a free dessert. We are very satisfied about this.
Misty S.,"East Dallas, Dallas, TX",98,8,,5.0,12/18/2016,We always go to the Cheesecake Factory. It's not only at a great location but we love how many choices they have on their menu. We really like their strawberry daiquiri's. I always order one an it hits my sweet spot just right. It's always clean including the bathrooms which is such a positive for me. Their service is always good. Their food is always very pleasing to me and my family. We usually order a slice of cheesecake to go. We love this place!
Nicole Aka Nik N.,"Raymond, ME",9,109,27,3.0,7/1/2017,"The food is always good, but the wait for a table is herendous. It's not as bad as other locations. But 30 minutes stretched to 65 minutes is far too long. Ugh too full and too tired to write a proper review."
Dan L.,"Dallas, TX",79,240,24,3.0,5/3/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a family friendly chain restaurant that is very popular.  I'm torn between giving this place a 4 or 3 star review. Here are the pros and cons as I see it. Pros: - Food was pretty good for a chain restaurant - Good location, close to our house and Northpark Mall but without the crazy parking and congestion of the mall - Our server was ok, not the best, not the worst - Dishes we enjoyed - Chicken Mediera, Chicken Alfredo and Jambalaya.  And the portions were quite generous - The bread they gave us was warm and delicious Cons: - It's a chain restaurant and Yelp can help you so many other great food options that aren't mass produced - Chicken Enchilada was not good, extremely salty - Overall, we enjoyed our food but have you ever checked out how many calories are in each dish?  It's very high! - Our server was ok, not the best, not the worst.  I gave our server a sweet tip even though it was formula chain restaurant service All in all, I think the family enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory.  It was a fun outing.  Lots of calories and nothing exceptional to write home about but once in a while, why not. I will try cheesecake for dessert next time...if I have room."
Bless C.,"Addison, TX",52,3,,4.0,2/2/2017,"Lovely restaurant, I ordered the Chicken Madeira, it was delicious ! It comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes were bomb, the asparagus was great too, just sucks they only give you 4 stalks. This would most likely be my favorite go to meal when I come here now. I'm sure the other meals are great as well!"
Thomas C.,"Dallas, TX",70,14,3,2.0,2/1/2017,So ummmm.... yeah. Ordered the spicy Chipotle pasta... it wasn't spicy but very sweet. The chicken has a honey glaze that greatly over powers the spicy sauce. And the menu doesn't tell you that it comes with tortilla chips on top.  the portion sizes is nice the menu is too much... too many options.. over 20 pages of items. My server was not happy that I returned my dish. Just don't tell me it's spicy and it's sweets. It needs not say spicy Chipotle.
Umesh A.,"Dallas, TX",15,23,12,4.0,12/21/2016,"My wife loves this place, been here multiple times. Food is okay, although I always struggle to order good vegetarian meal but she loves it.  Tip : Always buy Cheesecake Factory gift cards during holidays - it comes with 2 complimentary cheese slices for every $25 gift card (single slice cost easily $7-8 - so you save $14-16 by buying $25 gift card). You can get free dessert with your meal. Cheesecake slices are huge."
Telecia C.,"Irving, TX",79,31,20,4.0,6/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is on my top 5 list of favorite restaurants! I love the variety of options and extensive dessert menu. On Saturday I had the crab cake sandwich and dulce de leche cheesecake.  Shhhh....the crab cake sandwich is not on the menu! The cheesecake costs about $8.50! Yikes! For my family of 4 we spent around $75 which included appetizers, sodas, entrées and 1 cocktail.  The portions here are very huge so you can definitely share with family and friends. Be prepared to wait if you come on a weeknight or weekend!"
Irum J.,"Dallas, TX",108,124,38,5.0,9/5/2016,"A sweet spot for me and hubby - this is where he fell in love with cheesecake! Tons of variety, love the staff and we're regulars in getting out to-go dessert orders. The tropical flavors like mango - lemon meringue is delish, and they also have the traditional NY style for those that want to stay in a comfy taste pallet....worth every penny!"
Autumn L.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,3.0,10/14/2017,So I'm not one to complain but I've been coming here a lot this year and every time I come to this specific location they are all sold out of ahi tuna. It doesn't matter if I come really early during lunch hours or early during dinner hours it always sold out. I don't know what the deal is but if they sell out of it so fast they must not be getting enough of it. I believe if you cannot supply enough of something do not put it on the menu. I go to several cheesecake factories all over and they always have tuna available yet this one does not. I come here specifically for it and it's disappointing when I find out the tuna is sold out yet again. Don't get me wrong the service is great and the food is amazing but when they are continuously sold out of this one specific thing it gets pretty aggravating.  The three stars are only for the availability of food everything else is great concerning this company!
Dave K.,"Lewisville, TX",126,116,35,4.0,7/14/2015,"Steak Dianne and Chicken is off the charts!  Love it, and the bread, one of my FAV.   Server was ""ok"", not super cheerful, but We usually get Great service here.  Didn't save room for desert, but the Cheesecakes are always amazing."
Marissa B.,"Dallas, TX",7,82,1,2.0,2/20/2016,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory but this location was a let down. We waited for our server for over ten min before he came and asked for our drink order. He didn't bring any bread or water, I had to ask for it 10 min later. I then received the wrong sandwich and he took it back, gave me a salad and said ""you get a free salad for waiting"". Haha oh thanks! Wow a free small side salad for my troubles! I got my sandwich and hoped that he comps some of the meal or something on the bill, which he did not. Horrible service last night!!"
Brianna R.,"Dallas, TX",45,10,2,2.0,9/21/2016,"I love the cheesecake here but tonight I was waiting in line for my order and the young, female African American employee at the Cheesecake bar asked the woman in front of me if she was expecting and I just thought that was inappropriate and rude. Maybe it's just me but the way I was raised, you don't ask questions like that or make comments about someone else's body, especially a stranger's. I felt so bad for her and wish that I had spoken to a manager about it on her behalf before I left."
Nesha M.,"DeSoto, TX",73,1,,2.0,7/7/2017,"My husband and I went to TCF on this past weekend while the food was its usual delicious, the service was unusually slow for a Saturday before 5. That wasn't the worse part, a family at a table across from us was having trouble with the salt shaker. It seems that it was too full. Instead of emptying some out on the table, the man decided to use his dirty finger to mash some down into the shaker. However when that didn't work he blew the excess on to the floor. Other people have to use that shaker that you just blew all over!!! That's not Cheesecake's fault! However, since when is it ok to bring a huge trash bag full of trash from the dessert counter, through the main dining room (past my table) to the kitchen area. I didn't need to see that. This was a very unpleasant visit."
Je M.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/6/2016,"We visited this location today and ordered three slices of cheesecake, two water, a cup of coffee and the factory nachos.  Our plan was to eat dessert only since we had just ate dinner a few moments prior at another restaurant, First issue; the red velvet cheesecake consisted of a 2 inch layer of cream cheese icing..that ridiculous.  we sent it back. Second issue: One of the slices of cheesecake was brought out frozen-how are we supposed to eat that.  kept it anyway. Third issue: We ordered one cup of coffee and only drank one cup.  The waiter never asked my mom if she wanted a refill.  I asked him if I could get a refill of the coffee in a to-go cup, and he stated that they don't have any to-go cups for coffee.   We will not be visiting this location ever again."
Kimberly J.,"Dallas, TX",56,18,4,4.0,10/27/2016,*Update..it should have been 4 stars..my bad. I always enjoy myself at the Cheesecake Factory.  I need to insist you try the tamale cakes... That's my favorite appetizer. Also the kale salad. The lettuce wraps are good as well. The peanut sauce is delicious. My favorite meal is either the Cajun pasta or Jamaican black pepper with chicken and shrimp. Please please don't forget either the sea salt caramel or red velvet cheesecake
Cliff R.,"West Hollywood, CA",4,111,7,5.0,12/7/2016,Love all the hot dishes here. Always lots to chose from. My favorite is the skinny burger. Service always great.
Nini N.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,209,607,3.0,4/17/2016,"This is probably my least favorite Cheesecake Factory location. Food was cold, taste was mediocre and the waitress was not fond of us. I could tell since she walked around frequently and didn't stop by our table until we waved at her or until she assumed that we were done. I got the factory Meatloaf and it tasted heavy, I ate about 3 bits and was done.. The chicken Alfredo from the kids menu tasted better than that. The salad was okay, the chicken was awful. Overall it was a tasteless meal. I didn't enjoy it very much. The layout of the building is nice and location wise it's very good for business and close to the mall"
