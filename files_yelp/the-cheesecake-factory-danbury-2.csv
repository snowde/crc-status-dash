Foodie K.,"Irvington, NY",13,230,2250,5.0,8/21/2017,Six of us getting together after a year. We always love everything here and we had a great server this afternoon (also posted it on tips) ALISON R.  Posted pix of food and us. She was kind enough to give us couples separate checks. Appreciate it.  Chicken Parm Pizza Style great!!!
Katie O.,"Mahopac, NY",94,49,29,1.0,7/10/2017,"I counted seven separate problems with our meal yesterday. We arrived for dinner around 6pm and had a 20 minute wait, which we were relieved as we know Cheesecake Factory is usually at least a 45 minute wait. We were able to be seated outside and it was a perfect night to dine outside, so we were pleased with this as well. Our waitress, although friendly, was a total disaster. All went downhill after being seated. We weren't approached for a good 15 minutes after sitting down, so by the time the waitress arrived to take our drink orders we were already ready for our full order. I asked for a sprite and another 15 minutes later she came back with a water (not a sprite), and informed me they were out of spinach dip and threw the menus on our table again. Not a problem, but she then walked away and didn't come back for another 20 minutes to see if we wanted to order a different appetizer and about 35 minutes had now gone by before I could even tell her she got my drink wrong. In those same 35 minutes, we were never brought any bread for the table, despite her saying she'd bring it right out. Once she finally did bring the bread, she never brought any small plates so we ate our bread on our napkins.  Our main course finally arrived a solid hour after being seated (mind you all we ordered for our main course was a salad and a Small Plate??) and my boyfriends steak in his antioxidant salad was dry and cold. (My stuffed mushrooms were very good though). I'll chalk most of this up to it being a busy night, but cheesecake factory is expected to be able to handle a high volume of business with the amount of seating they have. Not impressed even slightly. We arrived for dinner at 6 and left at 8 due to the most miserable dining service we've ever received. Super disappointing."
Cara R.,"Easton, CT",0,8,20,3.0,12/30/2017,The wait time was not to my liking but the servers we had were amazing. I also love the fact that the mall is connected to this restaurant.
Rob R.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,62,71,5.0,11/5/2017,I love the burgers here I know it's not very adventurous but that's what I enjoy most despite the huge menu. Decor is excellent and the service is top notch.  Prices are great for what you get and the quality is consistent I wish one would come to Poughkeepsie.
Laurie K.,"Red Hook, NY",15,50,5,1.0,12/9/2017,DONT GO. FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE. MR.Romance and I stopped in for lunch spent way over $50.00 and didn't even get the Cheesecake. No entrance into the mall. Bathrooms were filthy. NEVER AGAIN.
P M.,"Danbury, CT",1,23,,1.0,12/20/2017,"First off the bathrooms were disgusting, need to be cleaned desperately. Rhianon S. is a subpar waitress at best. After I told her that the chicken in my caesar salad was raw she got the manager Mike. Mike came and gave a comment by saying that the chicken was not raw but instead it was a ligament in the chicken that I had pointed out. No comment was needed."
P S.,"Ridgefield, CT",0,2,,5.0,12/22/2017,Went for an early lunch with my wife.  Service was excellent.  Manager James was very helpful regarding a small issue and straightened it out perfectly.
Nancy L.,"Danbury, CT",0,21,65,3.0,8/14/2017,"The food was good. Had a chicken picatta, but nothing special. Hubby had a chicken burrito (?). Looked pretty, but again just ok. Drinks was another story. I was disappointed with their mojito. First I asked for happy hour drinks (we were there before 5pm) and was told only at the bar. Ok, so i went ahead and ordered the mojito. Found it to be mostly ice and very little liquid. But the kicker is that it cost $12!! As much as my entree! Well, I've now learned to make my own mojitos, with not so much ice and better tasting. Thanks  Cheesecake factory.  Oh, 3 stars because your cheese cakes are really sooo good. Drinks, not at all. And sadly, the hubby doesn't even want to go back just for the cheesecakes (sigh). Oh well..."
Adam B.,"Boston, MA",0,6,,1.0,6/21/2017,Stopped here on a short roadtrip from NYC to Boston. Sat down and ordered after waiting an initial 20 minutes with menus... nothing came and was not checked on by waiter ONCE. At 30 minutes we booked it.
Lisa B.,"Norwalk, CT",81,290,132,4.0,3/6/2017,"I came to the Cheese Cake factory with my Dad last week because we were hungry and decided to give it a try. It is conveniently located in the mall which is awesome! Tons of parking, and a great place to walk off your meal afterwards ! The ccf was a lot fancier inside than i expected! (Considering the only other time I had seen the inside of one before was on The big band theory lol). If i had to describe how it looked it kind of reminds me of an amped up version of a California Pizza Kitchen. The food was pretty good, we both ordered off their skinny menu which is a great option considering some of their meals can add up to almost 2000 calories in one meal! We had chicken pasta and stuffed mushrooms. They also bring out fresh bread with lunch which is great, fewer and fewer places are doing that now which is sad. Our waitress was nice too. I would go back if i was in the area."
DiarrheaC T.,"Danbury, CT",0,21,1,2.0,4/1/2017,"The portions are so large I often worry about over-doing it so I will order a salad when I go there. However, I keep falling for it over and over again, all of their salads are just bowels of cilantro with small handfuls of whatever else is supposed to be in the salad. If you love eating mass amount of cilantro their salads are for you.  -DCT"
Larissa P.,"Carmel, NY",0,8,,3.0,10/6/2017,Mac and cheese balls are effing amazing... so is the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. Must try. Avocado egg rolls... another banger! The wine is over priced
April H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,27,,4.0,9/21/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location usually has great dishes and pastas. Sometimes it's a miss, which I find all CF's to be inconsistent and not at the standard they used to be when first opened. I give it four stars for the quick wait times for a mall location, seems like a long wait but always faster than expected. Cheesecake here is fresh and I love their cocktails. Servers are usually friendly and attentive. My favorite is the bistro shrimp pasta or the sausage shrimp pasta and of course the fried mac and cheese. But if you want a more fresh, organic version and even bigger portions for less, check out Maggie McFly's Brookfield. Similar menus but better preparation and fresh ingredients from local farms."
Rachel S.,"Carmel, NY",51,248,1,4.0,4/13/2017,Always a long wait time.  I enjoy their light fare menu and they have a new beet/goat cheese salad that I am absolutely nuts over and is the reason for my frequent returns.  Service is always good as well.
Giovanni D.,"Danbury, CT",44,3,,1.0,10/3/2017,Ordered take out they said 20 minutes my boyfriend arrived and had to wait another 25 minutes. I asked for extra blue cheese that I would pay a extra charge for it and ended up with a half empty 1 oz ramekin. I'm beyond frustrated with this cold ass 100$ worth of food. Seriously can't stress how pissed I am.
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",672,1862,61,4.0,12/30/2016,"I have a soft spot in my heart for Cheesecake Factories. I would only go on a weekday.  It's not worth the wait. Nothing we had here was bad, in fact it was all quite tasty.  Enough of a portion for 3 people, fattening and very good oreo cheesecake and amazing hot fudge on the sundae. After my 80,000 calorie meal, I left feeling fat and happy... couldn't have asked for much more!"
Kerry C.,"Middletown, CT",23,78,10,4.0,2/11/2017,I've been here many times and I've had excellent food and service each visit. I always get the Chicken Costoletta - my favorite dish there. I really like their menu and how many choices they have. Definitely would recommend! Be prepared to wait a long time if you go on a Friday-Sunday night.
Katie P.,"Danbury, CT",16,40,2,2.0,8/19/2017,Every experience I've had here has gone worse than the time before. If you wish to have slightly below average food while getting to know the restaurant better because your table has been moved three times then this is the place for you. Otherwise have a pleasant night at the many other restaurants nearby.
Will F.,"Danbury, CT",153,55,9,2.0,11/27/2016,"You'd think that this place would be awesome right? Judging by the full parking lot, the huge wait time and how great looking the restaurant actually is.  I was unpleasantly surprised, it was garbage. I don't mind waiting to get in, that's part of the deal and usually a sign of a great spot. Waiting for food forever on the other hand bothers me.  The food is just ok, it's as good as square one down the street which is barely better than diner food.  All said and done, I spoke with the manager, got a $50 credit towards my meal for the obnoxious time we spent waiting. That's great and all, but even if my meal was half the price I still wouldn't go back there."
Laura J.,"Danbury, CT",274,77,32,3.0,6/20/2017,"A frequent guest here with my father. But since seeing that this specific Cheesecake Factory didn't pass their health inspection very well, I'm a bit thrown off by that. It is a corporate restaurant - you think their standards would be higher than private family owned kitchens. The servers are rude - Sam did not offer us specials or tell us about the new dessert that came out (which is why we came there in the first place) but since our neighbors were offered the new dessert by another waiter, and we weren't, shows how some waiters and waitresses work with pride VS. Who is just there for money. Hope to find a better Cheesecake Factory location one day. I'm beginning to doubt it after multiple hiccups and bad experiences here in Danbury, Ct."
Karran R.,"Bronx, NY",32,4,1,5.0,8/6/2017,"My favorite restaurant with my girls.  I love the food and the wonderful service.  My girls love the desert and always look at it while waiting to be seated.  My daughter loved the mango, tropical smoothie."
Christina Y.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/1/2017,"Food and portion sizes are fine,  but the service was awful. The server was incredibly disrespectful. I came with a number of people,  a number of which are diabetics. Each person ordered their own entree, but no drinks or appetizers, because that's all any of them can eat. The server made us feel like we didn't buy enough, never came by to check on us (but constantly did on the tables around us). He came by at the end with with a dessert menu, sort of waved it at us, and when we said no thank you, just the check, he literally threw his head back, laughed, and walked away without saying a word. He never cleared anything off the table, never topped off water, and didn't respond when we tried to get his attention a number of times.  We've eaten at this branch a number of times, and have never had an issue, but last night was unacceptable. We didn't ask to speak to a manager on the spot, because some of the guests were visiters, and we didn't want to make everyone feel more awkward."
Danielle K.,"Austin, TX",19,308,,5.0,11/25/2016,"I met some friends here, 2 of us had pasta and 1 had a burger. Our food was fresh and tasty. Our server was really nice, she spoke with me for a while when waiting for my friends. We finished with desserts....the strawberry shortcake is amazing, don't miss it!"
Atnier R.,"Monroe, CT",18,121,73,4.0,9/27/2016,"You never know with Cheesecake Factory, as their menu is too big to be consistent from time to time, but we decided to give it another try. No wait, able to sit down quickly, but it wasn't at a booth, we were seated at an uncomfortably neighbored little table for two. For entrees, we had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Fish'n'Chips lunch portions.  Despite being lunch portions, they were huge, which was a good thing that we didn't order the regular sizes.  Both the pasta and fish'n'chips were delicious and well-presented.  We followed up with a cheesecake that was good enough, but I have never really been wowed by their desserts, in spite of their name and reputation. At $14 dollars a lunch portion entree, it's not too bad, especially since the food did taste good and was generously portioned, and the location looks pretty inside.  Would visit again at some point. Service was impeccable.  Surprisingly pleasant and extremely attentive.  Definitely felt high-class."
Jeff F.,"Brookfield, CT",0,17,27,4.0,4/10/2016,"Yes, the standard long wait for a Saturday night. One guy was going berserker on a hostess about the wait. Has he never been to Cheesecake before? Finally we got a table. For appetizers my wife and I ordered loaded tots and avocado egg rolls. Very good. The tots were crunchy outside and creamy inside. The avocado egg rolls were great too. Plenty of avocado with a green dipping sauce. Not sure what was in the sauce but it tasted like cilantro.  Dinner: teriyaki chicken was delicious. Charbroiled. Plantains were sweet and caramelized. My wife says one of the best dishes on menu. I got the sweet corn tamale cakes. Spicy and yummy. They are actually listed in the appetizer section.  To go: Apple streusel cheesecake. Haven't eaten it yet. Piece was a bit smaller than they usually give.  Love when the buzzer goes off. You feel so special."
Lori V.,"Naugatuck, CT",42,73,73,4.0,4/26/2017,"My husband and I were in the area so we decided to stop by for lunch. We got 2 appetizers, awesome buffalo blasts and a quesadilla. Both were delicious. I grabbed a piece of red velvet cheesecake to go because I was too full to enjoy it there. Place was busy but they kept up with the tables and the crowd. Waiter wasn't overly helpful or friendly but it didn't effect our lunch. Love the buffalo blasts!!"
Mary R.,"New Fairfield, CT",0,39,,4.0,10/2/2017,"We just ate lunch here. I had the skinny licious burger which comes with a little salad. The burger was excellent cooked the way I asked! The salad was extremely limp , definitely should have alerted the manager . Our server was Stephanie , she was amazing, friendly and attentive ! Really did a great job ! Even asked if we would like a to go cup or iced coffee as my husband didn't finish it , sweet ."
Kyle V.,"Grand Rapids, MI",31,310,421,4.0,9/20/2016,"No wait on a Tuesday night, fast service, bottle of wine was presented well, but it was tough getting water refills. Food quality was great and everything was correct! Snickers cheesecake was very good as well. The only thing I'm not a fan of at CF is that their menu is so large."
Ashley N.,"Brewster, NY",78,9,3,5.0,11/20/2016,"Went there last night for my birthday. I haven't been to this one before but I was still impressed by the awesome service and great tasting food. My waiter was friendly and open to the idea of singing 'Happy Birthday' to me with some of the crew. Me and my tables food came out quick, i believe it's because we went at 11PM. But other than that, I was a little disappointed with the cheesecake. Although I'm not a consistent cheesecake eater or fan, I have had a better cheesecake from elsewhere. Other than that, you'll be satisfied with the service, atmosphere and food."
Kate A.,"Danbury, CT",0,15,1,5.0,6/19/2017,Everything was great! Colin is an awesome waiter- he kept our table laughing throughout dinner.. and on a rainy Monday nonetheless. :)
Paul R.,"Danbury, CT",2,21,4,5.0,5/5/2017,"My waitress was Leah and I sat for lunch at table 39 today. I had the skinnylicous beef medallions, medium rare with asparagus and mashed potato, and as always, it was delicious. I also love that it's only 380 calories and that Cheesecake displays the calorie amounts in their menus so I can stay lean! I've had this dish several times before and only one time was it a bit over cooked, but this time it was perfect as the other 90% of the time. Usually a restaurant is not this consistent but I think Cheesecake Factory has a system in place that really provides consistency. As for my service, it was truly perfect. Leah was friendly, had great timing, and it was just a great dining experience all around, including the attentiveness and friendliness of the host. Normally, I leave a 15-20% gratuity, but I left her a $30 tip on a $27 bill because it's so rare to find such polite, friendly people in the service industry.  I so appreciate this kind of effort and gladly will show my appreciation for it. Thank you Leah, like I told you when I left, ""Perfect Service""! Oh, forgot to mention, the low carb Cheesecake with strawberries was delicious! A great finishing touch with a lower calorie count than most cheesecakes!"
Lily C.,"New York, NY",35,27,17,3.0,4/22/2017,"Nice place to meet up for a date. I don't know what happened to the food here but it is slowly spiraling down to a less impressive quality fine dining. I remember I use to love it here?! What happened Cheesecake Factory?! Your food use to be pretty to look at and taste even better when eaten, now it's splatter on the plate and taste mediocre."
Sara M.,"Poughquag, NY",52,12,9,4.0,6/8/2016,"Very good food. Menu has a variety of different options, portions are big!!! I got the falafel salad when I went and it was very good and filling. Other food looks delicious as well, and their desert is to die for!"
Jim D.,"Danbury, CT",0,26,,3.0,5/22/2016,"Have you ever wanted to go to a place where women wear ties? Well, this place is for you. Fat '90s ties, skinny hipster ties, ties with Paisley prints, ties with scissor decorations, you name it a lady was wearing any tie you could want. As for the food, who cares? Fill up on the neck ornaments."
Marisa H.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,33,5,4.0,7/24/2017,My family and I came here yesterday. We had a pretty good experience while here. All of our food was cooked well and our server was great. We actually had two servers. I don't know why. The one server didn't do much for our table and would just pop up randomly when we really didn't need anything. I hope they didn't split the tip because our main server was amazing while the other didn't deserve any of the tip.
Amanda S.,"St Joseph County, MI",19,104,117,3.0,10/19/2015,"We come here at least once or twice a year, most recently this past February for my birthday.  We're used to waiting at least an hour, but happened to arrive at a good time, early afternoon, and we were seated right away. I  get the caramel macchiato- and it's always perfect.  We also love their factory nachos, unfortunately they seemed to have tweeked the recipe a bit and the cheese was like...glue. And tasted like plastic. Huge disappointment. My husband has never gotten a meal there that he just loves. I get the Sante Fe salad, which is generally a large portion and fresh. The ambience, especially in the evening, is comfortably dim...but always noisy. In general, we have a mediocre experience each time. Good enough to return to, but nothing to write home about."
Brianna S.,"West Haven, CT",129,8,137,3.0,6/10/2015,"We arrived on a random Tuesday evening, just planning on grabbing a couple beers and catching up. Plans changed quickly when we saw the happy hour menu and immediately started salivating. The restaurant offers a wide range of apps from dips to wontons and full on burgers for just $5.50. We decided on the factory nachos, roadside sliders, and fried mac n cheese balls. Of these 3 dishes, we've only tried the fried mac n cheese balls before, which have been AMAZING amaze balls in the past. Tonight, however, was a different story. The balls came out hot and steamy (yes please) with marinara sauce and cheese as garnishes. First bite was crispy and awesome, but then we started noticing a slight plasticky taste. We ate them anyway because, food. We then moved onto the nachos. The chips were stale and the cheese tasted more like cheez whiz. We gave it a good try, but couldn't stomach more than 3 chips each. I know ""unprocessed"" is not the first thing that comes to mind when nachos are on the brain, but these were just disappointing. The sliders, thankfully, were very tasty. The presentation was lacking, as they looked more like McDonald's cheeseburgers, but for the happy hour price we were satisfied. The hostess was very friendly and the bartender was sociable and attentive. She kept the drinks coming, which were also on happy hour special (whoop!). I've had many great experiences at this place both with food and with staff, so I'm hoping our food encounter was just a random flub. I would definitely come back for the drink specials, and to try some different options on the menu."
Jennifer L.,"Peekskill, NY",768,555,818,3.0,4/29/2014,This chain is a favorite of mine. Good food + slow and forgetful server = 3 Stars. This location doesn't really seem to have a sense of urgency.  I wasn't too impressed compared to the other Cheesecake locations I've been to.
Tina K.,"Edenwald, Bronx, NY",22,60,370,3.0,3/6/2016,"1st at this location. Food was good. I had my usual, orange zest chicken and mash potatoes. I was surprised by the chicken blasts, they were very yummy and tender. Only real complaint I had was the bathroom had no tissues. Had to wait so long for an attendant to assist but other than that I had fun. Oh and I couldn't figure out if my Red Sangria had beats in it or not. Our waitress had lil bad timing, she would continuously interrupt us in mid conversation to ask if we needed anything but we did appreciate her service, better to have her around often than not at all."
Ashley L.,"Park City, UT",81,25,,5.0,5/16/2016,"I normally sit at a bar high top to avoid a wait. They have an awesome happy hour meal-deal. But this particular Cheesecake Factory has a really nice outdoor patio that's worth the wait on the nice sunny spring days we've been having.  Wish I could remember specific names, but some awesome waiters here!!!"
