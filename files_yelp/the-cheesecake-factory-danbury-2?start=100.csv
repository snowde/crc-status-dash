Annie O.,"Southbury, CT",2,1,1,1.0,11/16/2015,"I arrived at Cheesecake factory at 12:45 and was handed a pager and told that I would be seated in 30mins. I arrived at Cheesecake Factory and we were seated around 1:30. But this is what bugged me. We sat down and ordered two chicken tostada salads and we waited for roughly one hour+. The manager came over and claims they were apparently ""Backed up on salads"", and she didn't offer us any thing for free, like a slice of cheesecake for example. I would never recommend Cheesecake Factory to any one who wouldn't like to wait for food for over one hour."
Lola D.,"Shelton, CT",58,117,11,1.0,7/27/2014,The wait was far longer than they told us it was going to be... by 30 minutes. The food took FOREVER to come out. Like 45 minutes or more. The kids macaroni and cheese had a random piece of meat in it (oh gee sorry about that) is all the server had to say and not all the dishes came out together. The salads also came out without dressing on them and when we brought it to the managers attention she tried to prove their was dressing on it by showing it was wet. REALLY?!?! Talk about a terrible place to eat. Don't bother!
Ian S.,"Port Jervis, NY",33,163,1,3.0,3/28/2013,"(representing 2.5 stars - I should specify that this PARTICULAR Cheesecake Factory was *fine*, if I were to review the franchise as a whole, it would get 2 stars.) This is my fourth or fifth visit to assorted Factories Cheesecake, and I think I can remove the mask - it's an overpriced, slightly-more-upscale TGI Fridays with impeccable, military-level service. To those who don't eat out much, it's probably palatial. Pretty much everything is overpriced for what it is, but this is justified (depending on your attitude) by the portions being overwhelmingly big - even the salads are enough for three or four people, without exaggeration. The cheesecake wedges you get are gigantic, weighing a good pound per slice. This will please some, I suppose. I'd rather pay less to get a smaller quantity of better product, but I guess I'm insane. I had (half of) a Cuban sandwich, which was decent but not terribly meaty. Fries were somehow simultaneously very salty and slightly tasteless, though they were nice and crisp. My 'dessert' was a $6.50 glass of Sam Adams. I probably should've gotten cheesecake after all, and eaten a tablespoon of it per day for six months. They do have an obnoxiously-named (""Skinnylicious"") diet menu, which is fairly extensive, but if you're on ANY kind of diet, it's probably best to just not eat here. However, as all Factories Cheesecake seem to be sneakily located in places where there is NO OTHER OPTION AT ALL, their dimly-lit pseudo-swank will probably be around for some time yet."
Ashley S.,"Montgomery, NY",9,42,,3.0,3/28/2013,"In comparison to other chain restaurants: 4 stars In comparison to all other restaurants: 3 stars My best friend lives in Danbury, so this is a very convenient place to go for a meal, especially if we've been walking around the mall. It's a typical Cheesecake Factory: long waits if you're going at peak times, good service, a massive novel of a menu, better-than-average cheesecake, and calorific choices. It's DIFFICULT to be healthy here, even with the new ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  My major problem with the place is that my stomach always feels odd afterwards. Whether I attempt to go healthy or not, I seem to always feel like I have eaten a brick. My best friend and I have cut visits short because neither of us felt very well. Why we keep returning, I don't know. Convenience? The mehness of the nearby Ruby Tuesdays and lack of other options? The fact that there's something for everyone? There are definite pros and some sort of magic potion in the food that causes one to forget the last experience's stomach ailments. Next time, we'll probably venture off of mall property."
Karen L.,"Putnam County, NY",12,251,423,4.0,1/12/2013,The food is trendy but very tasty.  I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and it was fresh and flavorful.  The portions are large enough to share and still feel very full.  The wait is ridiculously long so I just order my food to-go sometimes.
Flamur K.,"Waterbury, CT",47,22,6,2.0,6/24/2014,"I was really disappointed tonight, I'm gonna have to agree with most of the reviews the service is very slow me and my girlfriend waited literally 20 minutes just for a drink order and mind you it wasn't even busy. we sat outside which was very nice and enjoyed the live band from brio the food was really good but I'm really disappointed with the service, it's obviously a problem that needs to be addressed."
Onyx P.,"Danbury, CT",0,16,,2.0,8/15/2015,"I don't get to go out much these days, so when I do, it means (sadly) a lot to me.  Today I had a plan to get out for a late lunch and my first well-researched choice was closed for a private event, so I went to the Cheesecake Factory out of locational convenience.  Wish I had checked out the reviews first; the food was not good.  I got the crab and artichoke dip, and I'm usually a sucker for a cheesy artichoke dip, but this one dropping with inexplicable orange oil and served with way over-buttered toasted bread.  Note that it takes a lot of butter to offend my tastes.  The Caesar salad was alright, but not ~$10 good, it's not like they came to the table and prepared the dressing fresh, just some chopped romaine, dressing, parmesan and 3 croutons I'm sure came out of a bag.  The service was great, the bartender who served me at the bar was sweet and attentive, but the meal was highly disappointing for the price and for what will probably be my only meal out for quite some time.  Guess I should have stuck to my (snobby) instincts against mall restaurants."
Pops X.,"New Milford, CT",0,36,,2.0,11/1/2013,"10-31-13 Went here for early dinner. 2- drinks, 2- burger meals, calamari appetizer, and take out 2- cheesecake. OVER $80.00!! With these NYC prices, drinks were small for: $11.50 each, calamari rated 1-10, I wouldn't give it a 5, and half the portion to other restaurants. Also tasted like fried oil!! Service was good, but with the serving prices over $2.00, the average for Ct., just not worth it!!"
John C.,"Danbury, CT",6,1,,2.0,7/20/2014,"Ordered curb side they forgot an item on my order had to call the curbside number 3 times, could have just gone in but followed instructions. Waited an hr to get my food."
Pam L.,"Norwalk, CT",1,5,,2.0,8/5/2012,"We went mid afternoon on Friday, having read the Yelp reviews mentioning long waits. Got seated within five minutes. Waited another fifteen minutes before our server came to tell us they were temporarily out of bread. Not a problem, we wanted only dessert. He took our order for one tea, one coffee, and two pieces of cheesecake. Five minutes later cups for the beverages arrived - one came with a dirty cream ring stuck half way up the interior of the cup. Getting a clean cup only took eight minutes. He had also forgotten the cream and sugar. After our desserts were served, he never checked back to see if we needed anything further. We had to wave at him, down the aisle to get our check well after we were done. When the table of four next to ours emptied, two young bus boys eventually removed the dishes, then used a damp cloth to smear several spots of left behind hamburger grease into a streaky, greasy residue all over the table surface; they set the table and left. The next set of diners located the greasy smears as they leaned on the table with their bare arms. They then had to wait to catch someone's eye to get the table properly cleaned. Two main points will summarize our experience:  1) This is by far the smallest CF of the six I have visited, perhaps, accounting for the reported very long waits. Other locations are multiple times bigger. 2) Cleanliness is of NO concern here. Dirty dishes, dirty tables, ketchup smeared on the menu, even most of the servers' white attire were desperately in need of washing.  Perhaps, this location can coast by on the goodwill built up by their other locations or on the strength of the company provided cheesecakes. But as a stand alone restaurant, the extreme lack of cleanliness and very slow, incompetent service would normally be a death knell. I would rather they improve, if only up to merely mediocre."
G C.,"Anniston, AL",0,25,19,2.0,11/9/2015,"Ordered Steak Diane cooked medium. It was well done. They offered to replace it, but with the very slow wait time and minimal service I did not return it. It was fairly palatable- at best.  Ordered stuffed mushrooms- they were pretty good.  For dessert ordered low carb cheesecake.  I have had it at Cheesecake Factory restaurants all over the US. It tasted old and the texture was also very thick and overly sticky.  I returned it.  Not taking another chance here.  The waiter was nice enough but not around very much.  They must need more servers, or more attentive servers.  Not a very good dining experience this evening.  I hope that it was just an off night."
Maureen B.,"Carmel, NY",36,34,30,3.0,8/22/2014,"When i first walked into the cheese cake factory I was a little overwhelmed. After being seated i got a chance to look around and was immediately transported to a Las Vegas cafeteria; ornate, noisy, high ceilings and noisy, noisy, noisy!     That being said--the service was awesome! I had a mushroom cheese burger that was delicious. The mushrooms were cooked in a fantastic sauce and the burger was cooked to perfection. Instead if fries i had -fried zuccini, portobello mushrooms and avocado-  different but just ok. I will give this place a second chance someday but i am not in a hurry to return."
Delisa E.,"Naugatuck, CT",20,109,26,3.0,1/25/2013,"Pros- Food is good Waitstaff is good Atmosphere is great Clean bathrooms Cons- Long obnoxious wait times, I have waited 45-60 minutes"
Esther C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",138,184,129,3.0,12/24/2012,"This place is great to go with your family or to go by yourself if you're a student. Proportions are ridiculously big and meant for 1 person. If you're going with family grab 2-3 Entrees and 1 app and you should be fine.  While Cheesecake is known to dabble basically in everything on their menu, they execute their pastas surprisingly well. I love Da Vinci! Their country side potatoes and biscuits are great as well  . When I was in university, I used to come here on Fridays and order 1 entree and 1 app that would last me basically the entire weekend.(Sad days, I know) Their cheesecake (of course) is great when you dine in . I like their banana and strawberry one. Don't opt to take the cheesecake for carryout, it's mushy and not that great."
Kong E.,"CANAL STREET, NY",0,9,,3.0,7/4/2012,"Nothing special about this place.  The food was so so.  The wait was long for a table and the service was slow. Ordered the hamburger and sweet potato fries.  Nothing special, burger was so so.  The fries were ok. Service was super slow.  Took forever for them to get the check and for me to get out of there."
Garret M.,"Brookfield, CT",43,14,,1.0,12/5/2011,"I was really hoping for the best from this restaurant. I've visited others and have been truly happy. However, the Danbury location was a HUGE disappointment. I'll spare all the details and give a high-level review.  We waited for 1.5 hours to be seated (45 minutes longer than we were quoted), waited 20 minutes to order only to find out (20 minutes later) they had run out of our appetizer. Our drinks were forgotten, the food took a good hour to an hour and a half to get to us and then was wrong. A drink was spilled on my wife and the only recourse was to comp the dessert. We arrived for lunch at 12:40PM and did not leave until close to 5PM.  I commented on the cheesecake factory customer service site and received a follow up call from a manager who apologized and offered to send a VIP seating card and a gift card to cover the cost of our meal. I was quite glad and grateful for the call.  That was 3 weeks ago and I have not received anything. Its very disappointing, at this point, that my experience has gone from bad to worse.  They've certainly lost my business and I'm afraid I couldn't possibly recommend this place to anyone."
Cherie L.,"Shelton, CT",0,165,201,3.0,11/23/2012,"Yes it's a chain restaurant.. & I do HATE ""chains,"" but I always get roped into this one chaing bcuz of their deserts & they have decent drinks (considering it's a chain).  My kids & I were on our way back home from a VERY long day, w/still a ""good"" amount of driving left. It was one Monday night, when we came here, they were unusually busy for a Monday night..I thought..not sure why?..anyhow there was a wait, we were told 20-30 mins...ended up being more like 45-50...why'd they lie?? I hate that! But by this time we were hungry, & despite the lie...we stayed for dinner. We'd felt like considering the traffic we'd just left on I-84...we weren't going to be very successful finding an alternate this late (5pm) & like I said we were tired. Kids just wanted to eat. Next time I WILL call ahead.  Food was ok, service was ok. We were dying to get home so we ate & ran. My kids & I were too tired to really care. We took desert to go & were glad, as the crowds kept coming in. (Glad we weren't part of THAT wait time!!) ;)"
Jennifer C.,"Seymour, CT",0,10,1,4.0,9/11/2015,My coworkers and I come every Friday-servers are always great and the menu accommodates everyone. We were really impressed with server Justin- he was helpful and patient and genuinely a nice guy.
Murphey D.,"Goleta, CA",0,137,4,4.0,5/17/2015,"The over all experience was good, what made our night was our waitress Kaitlyn. She was funny and attentive, although the wait was long (very busy) the food was still good and I recommend Kaitlyn"
