Kristina S.,"Mahopac, NY",0,1,,5.0,8/24/2015,Just went to the Cheesecake Factory which I go to almost once a week...5 stars because this time my waiter was Devon.. He was by far the best waiter I have ever had !! So nice and attentive... Was so welcoming and sweet hope to have him every time I come !!!
Marilyn B.,"Bethel, CT",73,33,,3.0,9/1/2011,"(Note: they have been open 4 days as of this writing).  Once the opening weeks hinks get worked out, this should be a good place. But there are still plenty of hiccups going on. On the plus side, we enjoyed our food (the one notable exception was my burger was badly overcooked/burnt but the mgr immed. had it re-done). However, the kitchen was a bit heavy handed with the salt shaker.  The cheesecake, of course, was delicious.  The downsides? 80 minute wait (that took 90) for a table on a Thursday night. By the time we were seated they were quoting 2-3 HOURS for a table. Yowsers. The waitstaff was personable but a bit slow--I don't think they have their kitchen and seating workflows quite figured out yet. The booths were comfy, but the room has a lot of hard edges and consequently is a rather noisy space--not the place for an intimate supper. Once they've ironed out the wrinkles, it should be an enjoyable place to eat. Until then,  Save your money and wait a few more weeks before visiting, you'll enjoy it more."
Don F.,"Sherman, CT",91,254,23,3.0,3/9/2014,"Okay food with nice combinations.  Good Cheesecake which is the real reason we all go.  The food is good, but not special."
Patty M.,"Roswell, GA",0,6,,1.0,10/9/2013,"The hostesses are rude and far from accommodating and friendly. They feel that no matter what, you must wait to get a table. They don't even wear name tags not to be identified. There is this young woman long black straight hair and darker skin that is so rude. She should not be at the front of the house welcoming people. After I got my pager and waited all the time she demanded, I still did not get a booth that it was the only thing I requested as a consumer. Terrible!!!"
Amanda D.,"Redding, CT",0,9,,5.0,8/2/2015,"Always a super long late, but completely worth it. Staff is always smiling and extremely willing, and excited to help customers. And to help ease the pain of the wait, their buzzers can be used in the mall and the other surrounding shops!"
Paul F.,"Bethel, CT",19,12,5,3.0,6/5/2014,"The presentation of the place, the food, even the restrooms were great. The food, not so much. The Mini Corn Dogs were breaded in this bread coating that tasted a bit fishy. For the actual meal, I had the Spicy Chicken Pasta. It was good, but just wasn't to my personal liking. And as always, the Cheesecake was phenomenal. But being the first time I've ever eaten anything but Cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't eat anything but the Cheesecake."
Lisa W.,"Wilton, CT",12,78,1,3.0,10/21/2011,"A welcomed chain restaurant addition to what was previously a pretty pathetic restaurant selection at the Danbury Mall.. As of  the time of my visit, the restaurant had only been opened about a week, but it was a good experience. A 20 minute wait in a small space at 5 p.m. on a Thursday surprised me, since the mall itself seemed empty. Well, fortunately it was uphill from there. Staff was still training, so we had two servers, but both were very gracious to us and the baby at the table. He was immediately delivered breads and a sliced banana, which kept him from fussing.   I tried the red sangria, which was fruity-licious but a little heavy on the ice. I chose a basic chicken avocado club sandwich with sweet potato fries. Good stuff, but as somebody else mentioned in a previous review, super heavy on the salt. Brought half of it home in a doggy bag, so serving size is definitely ample. Not sure eating only this small amount of food really qualifies as enough to write a review, but hey, it's a chain, and it meets the typical standards of the chain if you have eaten at one before. Bottom line, once you finally figure out what to order, you'll leave the restaurant satisfied with a full belly."
Jamie L.,"Watertown, CT",69,190,,3.0,8/1/2013,"Ahh Cheesecake Factory. Home of the hour long wait lines and cheesecake bigger than me. I have only been to this location once. It's a little out of the way of where I usually go which is probably why I don't frequent as much as I'd like. When I came here, the wait time wasn't to bad for the time of day, still a good 25-30 minutes. Why the wait time is worse than any other restaurant I've been to is beyond me. I don't get it. Anyways, everybody knows their typical menus, large portions of food and how unhealthy this place really is for you. Given the size of the place, the service was great. Rarely any wait time once we were sat, quick delivery of food and drinks, and the food was also amazing. We obviously took a piece of cheescake to go. I only give it 3 stars because I honestly feel like this place is NOT worth the hour long wait times. It's nothing special that you can't go to another restaurant and get."
Kent P.,"Astoria, NY",121,568,360,3.0,2/13/2012,"Lemon raspberry cheesecake.  That is all.   But seriously, you know what it is.  OD long waits, just get your buzzer, walk around in the mall and come back.  That's what we did and we got a table the moment we walked back in.  Pow."
Christine B.,"Redding, CT",40,79,35,1.0,4/7/2013,"*******This review is ONLY for their ""Curbside to Go"" Service.********* I love the Cheesecake Factory, always did!  I was very happy when they opened this one pretty close to my home.  What I don't like is waiting and waiting which is something patrons ALWAYS do because of the restaurants popularity!  So, to get the food and avoid the wait, I was thrilled that they have a ""curbside to go"" feature.  It's ""supposed"" to work like this.  1) Call in order 2) Time your arrival to their special parking area about 5 minutes after they say 3) Call the number on the sign and tell them you have arrived and 4) they bring your food, you pay them with a tip (usually $5) & 5) Drive home, eat and enjoy!!  Unfortunately at this location it works like this:  1), 2) &3)---Same 4) Wait 10 minutes and no food comes 5) Call again, who knows maybe there was a problem? 6) Wait 10 minutes and no food comes  6) Call again, with a little extra saying ""I've been here waiting 20 minutes!"" 7) Hear them say ""Sorry, sorry someone will be right out"" 8) Wait about 5 more minutes 9) Frustrated, lock your car, go into restaurant in your PJ's and slippers, or workout gear 10) Tell front desk what has been happening 11) Hear them apologize and go see what is happening 12) Finally out comes your ""cold"" food 13) Say something like, ""I've been waiting 30 minutes, you would think I get something, a piece of Cheescake for free..."" 13) Watch them give you a dirty look 14) End up paying full price-tip 16) Walk back to your car, in the snow 17) Drive home saying ""Never again!"".    Now, this scenario has not happened to me EVERY time, in fact up until,12/31/2012, the process worked quite well but since the New Year it has happened to me 4 times..... Moral of the story:  IF you use their ""Curbside"" service, be prepared to wait, then make sure you are not wearing your PJ's  as you will probably end up going into a VERY, crowded lobby!"
Jeff E.,"Stamford, CT",0,3,,1.0,6/9/2015,"HEADLINE...DO NOT GET TAKEOUT FROM THIS PLACE. I am a former restaurant manager of a top rated restaurant.  I write that because I know what to say when ordering so that there is no doubt in everyone's expectation of the customer experience.  Unfortunately, the two times that I have ordered take-out from this location, they missed the mark both times.  If they hit their mark, this would be a 3 star review on the food alone.  The service drops it to a 1 star because that is what I will remember from this experience and NEVER again get takeout from this place.  Both times I called in and ordered for a pickup time that was not in the middle of the evening rush and I ordered with an hour notice from my anticipated pickup time.  Both times I arrived 5 minutes early and paid in advance and tipped.  Both times I waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and was promised it would be just 2 more minutes, and waited and waited and waited and asked for a manager and waited and waited and then a smiling  manager showed up reminiscent of a Saturday Night Live skit. Picture Jan Hooks with an exaggerated smile saying ""How can I help you?""  I am not making fun of the manager that finally showed upit was just how it came off.   Both times, when I arrived at the hospital LATE for my dinner with a long term patient, the utensils that I specifically requested were not there which then required me to make a trip to the hospital cafeteria.  The French Country Salads with Shrimp were fine, The burgers were cold, the cold mac and cheese ball appetizer was more like a mac and cheese macaroon, cold, pasty...which tells me that it was packed into a take out container long before everything else.  I am going to save the $75 and get Chinese takeout next time.  No wait, always hot.     repeat..   DO NOT GET TAKEOUT FROM THIS PLACE."
Margarida V.,"Mt Kisco, NY",2,17,7,5.0,1/26/2014,Every meal I've gotten here so far has been delicious. As well as the drinks. I always get JW lemonade.
David L.,"Brewster, NY",2,5,2,4.0,10/25/2011,"My wife and I were anxious to try the Cheesecake Factory close to home in Danbury CT.  If you have never been to a restaurant in this franchise then you will be surprised or even overwhelmed by their extensive menu. There are plenty of  items to choose from, something to fit every palette and of course lots of different cheesecakes.  The prices are slightly high but reasonable considering the large portions. My wife and I ate there on a Tuesday night, there was no line and the room was 80% full.  Pros * Very good entrees * Excellent deserts * Good service * Big portions Cons * slightly pricey"
Thomas K.,"Danbury, CT",1,7,10,1.0,7/8/2015,"Finally made it here for lunch to see what all the fuss was about. Heard stories about how packed the place gets & 3 hour waits for tables. Got a little nervous when I had to literally walk around a Brinks armored money truck to get in the front door, but it was just busy, not packed. We were seated right away & service was ok. My $13. burger was just ok but the fries were not good & I didn't eat them. The wifes $13. Veggie burger was horrible & she didn't eat it (guess she should have ordered the $17. chicken caeser salad). This place is WAY overprice for food thats nothing special. Still don't see what all the fuss is about."
Tanner U.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",0,4,,1.0,3/25/2015,Waited over 30 min to order. $30 steak came out very over cooked. Waited another 25 for new steak. Pasta dish came out with a black crust from sitting under heating light too long.. Stick to the cheese cake. Nothing more.
Casey S.,"Waterbury, CT",0,15,4,4.0,2/14/2014,"The wait is very long (2 hours). However the nearby mall is worth browsing. I had the Tuscan chicken. Absolutely magnificent. Other than the wait, great food and service."
D M.,"New York, NY",0,24,3,5.0,2/28/2015,"Today was my first time at a cheesecake factory and it will definitely not be my last! The restaurant itself looked very nice and had a nice atmosphere besides the large amount of people there. To start off, they give you a basket of bread that contains warm brown bread and regular bread, both were delicious. I ordered a macaroni and cheese burger, it was amazing and cooked perfectly when I asked for it medium rare, and it came on a buttered bun as well, making it that much tastier. The fries were good too, nice, crisp, and crunchy. I definitely can't wait to come back!"
Lee T.,"Bethel, CT",5,2,,5.0,4/7/2014,I went because I love cheese cake which I didn't get.  Too full from the delicious steak.  A little pricy but a real nice place.  Staff was very attentive.  We were sat right away on a Sunday around noon.
Amanda D.,"Westchester County, NY",122,129,38,5.0,6/9/2013,My favorite chain restaurant. Got together with a friend from graduate school and my boyfriend today for lunch and it was great. Scott was our waiter and was fantastic.
Jennifer C.,"Bethel, CT",2,4,,4.0,8/21/2012,"The wait can be long sometimes, but it is a fun place to grab cheesecake with friends at night. They are also open relatively late for a restaurant, so it is a good place for a night out."
