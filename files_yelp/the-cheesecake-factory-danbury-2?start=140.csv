Vinnie S.,"Waterbury, CT",315,227,510,3.0,9/23/2012,"My wife and I went to the CF for dinner on Sat. 9/22/12. It was very busy and we waited 30 minutes. I ordered the Ahi Tuna and the Chicken Di Pana. My wife had the Carlton salad. The tuna was good and came out very quickly. I wish there had been more tuna though. I felt like it was mostly avacado. My chicken was lightly breaded over a light cream sauce. My sides were broccoli and mashed potatoes. The broccoli was cooked perfectly, a little al dente. My potatoes were a large portion but were luke warm. Overall, the entre had good portions and was tastey. My wife's salad had chicken in it and was a large salad. She also said that it was tastey. We had a slice of red velvet cheesecake for dessert and it was very good. One slice was good enough for two after dinner. The service was good, just when you were wondering where dinner was, it was served. The cost of the meal was about $55 with tip and no drinks. Luke warm potatoes and the 30 minute wait are what's preventing me from giving it 4 stars. In the future it will be hard for me to justify waiting 30+ minutes to eat at a chain restaurant when you can get an awesome meal at a locally owned one. But it's the mall, so if you're hungry, and you don't want to leave you're kind of stuck."
Chris S.,"Bethany, CT",0,36,21,2.0,3/24/2013,The service from our waiter was good.  That is the only thing good I can say about my first experience at this Cheesecake Factory.  I order a simple pasta dish and substituted linguine for penne ... I guess the cooks could handle the change because my pasta was undercooked and loaded with cheese. My wife had a shrimp creole that was up on the lobby board - it was ... acceptable.  (I'm from Baton Rouge originally so I'm picky.)  My daughter had a burger - it was well-prepared.  We went there on a Wednesday night at dinner time and the wait was around 40 minutes.  For the wait and the high price I expect a lot more.
C H.,"Mahopac, NY",1,15,6,5.0,3/27/2013,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a countless number of time and it's an amazing experience every time! The food is delicious and the service is excellent! Collin, Chris and Damien were by far my favorite waiters. Request any of them, and I garuntee the best dining experience you've ever had!"
Ann T.,"Bradenton, FL",0,25,,1.0,8/14/2014,"While the food was good, the service is horrendous. We waited for someone to appear after we were seated only to have our waiter take care of a table seated after us. We finally got 2 drinks with only 1 straw. After waiting over 1/2 hr bread showed up and 1 min later our meals - both orders incorrect!  Lots of better places around to eat with much better service."
Javier C.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,4,3,2.0,2/11/2012,"I love the cheesecake factory. I always get the pasta carbonara with chicken. I've gone many times to the one in white plains, ny. I've gone 2 times to the one in Danbury. Mainly because it's closer. 1st time it was when they first opened. It was good. 2nd time the service was great like always but the food was very bland. No consistency like the one at white plains. The noodles were overcooked. The bacon was burned not crisped. No garlic flavor like it normally comes. The sauce was even watered down. Looked like soup. Not even the same portion size. It was like ordering from their skinnylicious menu. Do yourself a favor. Take the longer drive and go to the one in white plains."
Brenton G.,"Hamden, CT",0,1,,5.0,7/24/2014,"We showed up at about 7:15 on a Wednesday.  The two of us were seated in 10 minutes.  The waiter was very kind and visited out table just the right amount of times.  The restaurant was packed, but we still managed to get our entrees, deserts, and check in a timely fashion.  Faster than other less crowded chains I've been to.  The food is a little more expensive than a typical chain but the portions were huge and very good.  Even the slices of cheesecake were very large.  So in my opinion it is worth the couple extra dollars.  I've been to the West Hartford location as well and this location was definitely more convenient with parking and the mall right next door.  Overall a great experience."
Peripatetic N.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,,3.0,1/12/2013,"Most dinner plates are good and they are BIG.  Cheesecake is good, but OVERPRICED.  Our local area Greek-American Diners make the cheesecakes fresh and are definetely better.  However, nothing beats the variety at the Cheesecake Factory."
Echo W.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",27,311,106,3.0,6/18/2012,I had caramel chicken which was a little bit too sweet. Perhaps I should have been alerted by the word caramel.
Molly M.,"Framingham, MA",0,19,,4.0,1/10/2012,"Came here with my boyfriend not too long ago, it was great. We got lucky and snagged a bar table to evade the hour plus wait. Our waiter was extremely attentive and very nice without being overbearing. We are vegetarians so I can't speak for any meat dishes, but we got lots of veg appetizers and they were all really great, especially the stuffed mushrooms. The only downsides are that you should expect a pretty long wait on a busy night, and the food is a bit pricey but good portions."
Tenisha W.,"Waterbury, CT",0,23,25,1.0,9/2/2012,"After turning away several times because of the long wait times we finally went and waited because it was my daughters wish for her birthday. I was grossed out by the number of flies in this place. There were flies around our table, dead flies in the light fixture and flies on the other side of the glass where the kitchen is. Gross and unsanitary."
Lauren B.,"Bedford Hills, NY",26,40,,4.0,1/6/2012,"Delicious food and drinks, but the wait is 100% unreal, and the battle to get a bar table would make even a trained UFC fighter flinch. I've seen waits of 2-3 hours at this place. I hope the new addition of Brio right next to it might draw some people away from Cheesecake factory, but probably not. If you want it to be empty you have to go for lunch, or at a really bizarre time. I went to eat there once at 3:30 in the afternoon and it was close to empty. However for dinner...I've never actually waited on the insanely long list to get a real table, I always sit at one of the bar tables that you have to fight over like king of the hill. Cheesecake is seriously the best thing I have ever tasted in my life."
Sandra E.,"Danbury, CT",0,24,,3.0,1/5/2013,"I'm sorry - I love this place and the food is ""overall good"" (although I tend to always order the same thing over and over again because every time I order something ""different"", I wish I hadn't), but this place consistently has a wait of about 1 hr.  And that's just too long for my family to wait.... It's kind of a trendy place - like Starbucks, Panera, etc., except that the portions here are actually huge! So if you don't mind the wait, it's good.... And the buzzers they give you don't reach into the mall so you really can't even walk around there.  There is, however, an LL Bean right next door to it that you can go in there.  (P.S.  They tried to buy the space at LL Bean when they realized the space they  had was too small, but LL Bean had already signed the contract... Too bad... This Cheesecake Factory is supposedly the smallest in the country.)"
Samantha J.,"Moorhead, MN",2,103,,2.0,6/12/2013,"Meh describes this place perfectly. This was my first experience at this chain & I don't have much of a desire to go back. I had some spicy pasta, which wasn't bad but not particularly memorable. The service was terrible- We overheard a busboy talking to the next table about how much he hated everything & wanted all the tables to leave so he could go home. We waited an excessive amount of time for the waitress to bring us our check."
Annelise K.,"Danbury, CT",4,25,,3.0,7/16/2013,"if you're a cheesecake lover, I would highly recommend this place. The menu overwhelmed me with so many varieties of flavored cheesecake. the food isn't bad but very pricy. I ordered 3 crabcakes as an appetizer and for three mini crabcakes they charged me $13. I paid more for the plate being decorated with foreign sauces and flowers around the pieces of crab than for what the CRAB CAKES WERE WORTH! I probably wouldn't come back here just because I can't afford spending that much money on food and cheesecake. The cheesecake was very good and they give you a huge piece. Come here for dessert, after all it's a dessert place!"
Derrick G.,"Danbury, CT",0,2,,1.0,7/12/2012,"Just got talked to going here again first time a disaster.this time a close second waited 15 min to order .almost 50 min to get food I hot the Kobe burger have had a lot better quality meat .but iwill say it was cooked to the way I ordered it ..no desert ,waited for ever for a check 1 30 min for a so so burger."
Sir E.,"Bethel, CT",0,26,,4.0,6/8/2012,"best fried calamari in town thin crispy crust, soft NOT rubbery calamari good steak (small for my taste) good pasta (better than some italian restaurants around here) alot of noise portions are small"
Chris B.,"Danbury, CT",284,6,,4.0,11/12/2011,"Typical CF, but small. Long wait - great food."
Michelle D.,"Danbury, CT",1,14,1,1.0,4/16/2014,Went to dinner with two of my friends. I arrived ahead of time and asked the hostess if she had recently sat my friends since I thought they arrived already. She would not let me out my name on the list again insisting that I probably was on the list. It turns out we weren't so that caused us to wait even longer since more people had been added to the waiting list. Over 40 minutes later we finally get seated and our server was Damien D. He was friendly at the beginning then became very snooty soon after his friend was seated next to us in an adjoining booth. The food was not bad. I had the garlic noodles while my friends had chicken piccata and bang bang chicken and shrimp. We knew we definitely wanted dessert so we asked the he wrap our leftovers. Ordering dessert we knew that we also would like that to be placed in a to go container knowing we could not finish it. My friend also ordered a take out order for her husband. He said it wasn't a problem and went on to get our order. Good thing I checked my bag since he gave me the wrong dessert. Upon requesting the correct order he snatched the wrong one in a huff as if having to actually do work pained him. Then in a snooty tone saying my correct order of strawberry shortcake was being prepared. To pay the bill we did ask he break it down with three cards.  He said it was no problem but proceeded with an attitude. Once I received my so-called strawberry shortcake it was in a large container which looked like a scone and three what looked like soup containers. I asked Damien what he gave me and with a bigger attitude proceeded to say it's my strawberry shortcake order to go as if I'm some kind of idiot. Last I checked he should be catering to the customers who in turn pays his salary. His attitude was a complete turn off and would NOT recommend this Cheesecake Factory. Very unprofessional and distasteful. Boo to you Damien and your terrible attitude!!
Paul C.,"Brewster, NY",126,4,,2.0,7/16/2013,"Unfortunately, when this restaurant first opened, every time I would make an attempt to go, the wait time would be so long, I would give up and leave. I'm not really an impatient person, but a two hour wait time is a little extreme. I recently had the opportunity to go out to eat with my mother, and we decided on the Cheesecake Factory. This was a weekday around 3:00 in the afternoon. The positive: The staff: they were extremely helpful. The portions were rather large. The negative: It took a long time to get our food brought out to us, and when it finally was brought to us, it had a hair in it! I called my waitress over, and let her know, she removed it immediately. The manager came over, and addressed the situation immediately. But then it was another half hour to get my replacement meal. Which was just mediocre. They comped the meal, which was thoughtful, but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."
Stuart W.,"Middletown, NY",0,13,,3.0,9/26/2013,"This is my favorite restaurant chain but this particular one in Danbury was very poorly run, very slow to get food, and overall experience was below average for Cheesecake Factory. I will give them another chance someday but not soon."
