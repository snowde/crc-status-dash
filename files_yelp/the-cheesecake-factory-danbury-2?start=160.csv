R Q.,"Bethel, CT",0,3,,3.0,7/22/2012,"Food was fine, slightly expensive.  Menu is huge, yet they only have one type of soup each day.  Also do not have rye read, only whole wheat or white.  Very crowded,but I can't figure out why as there are so many other better places nearby. I suggest you try it once and see for yourself .  Cheesecake very good but expensive."
Lauren V.,"Woodbury, CT",1,28,1,4.0,7/4/2013,"Yum! I love this Cheesecake Factory! The service is great, the people are very nice, and the food is amazing! The cheesecake tastes delicious!  I waited pretty long for my food, but it was probably worth it! Love this place!"
Kristal F.,"Manhattan, NY",47,60,13,1.0,5/23/2012,"worst cheesecake factory i've ever been to. lackluster food at best.  not horrible, but i expect more... will never EVER wait that long for mediocre food EVER again."
john g.,"Bethel, CT",0,28,,3.0,9/4/2012,Huge menu but only one soup to choose from and only white or whole wheat bread for your sandwich.  When soup arrived they had no soup spoons!  Food was good and nicely presented.  Prices are a bit high.  You pay about $12 for a lunch worth about $9.  Nice looking place.  Once a year or so is plenty.
Ann T.,"Mahopac, NY",0,115,23,1.0,8/3/2012,"racial discrimination or really bad service. Every time we go there is the same. Sevice poor. Dinner an hour later. Waitress no where to be found. After spending a 110 dollar for two, I was looking a the slices of cake at the cake bar and the manager tells me it too expensive. Expensive for who? What a lack of manners/ and education. No wonder the staff are clueless. What a bunch of morons at the Danbury,Connecticut locations."
fra w.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,85,,4.0,5/26/2014,service excellent....Kenny was great...had 2 skinny meals....low calories but very tasty....pasta w chicken....chicken Tuscan style......ample portion...good service....well worth the price....the only fault for The Cheesecake Factory is their customer service is below par...much below par in fact...it is horrible....i ordered $150 gift card for my daughter at Christmas and was to get 4 or 5 vouchers for free cheesecake by email....never received and all my calls and emails to them was in vain...the corporate office even promised to email me a Gift voucher 2 weeks ago and it too was not received.....THEY SUCK
Paul C.,"Danbury, CT",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2012,The worst hosttess service i have ever seen in my life.  We have eaten here several times.  The servers are pleasant.  The managers are useless.  The hostess are the most rude people i have come across in my life.  The people who are being hired here are about 18 years old and the training must be about 5 minutes long.  I predict the cheesecake factory starts clsoing restaurants in two years.  Their hayday is over.  This use to be a good chain.  It has cleary gotten beyond their control.
