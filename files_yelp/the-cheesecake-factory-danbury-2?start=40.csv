A S.,"South Salem, NY",0,18,,3.0,9/24/2017,"Ahh, the Cheesecake Factory.  Long have I heard about the awesome cheesecakes and legendary large portions that stretch into a second meal.  Finally got to eat here recently with my wife and 3 small children.  The restaurant inside is comfortable, but has a diner feel to it with lots of mirrors encircling the booths reflecting your image all over the place, like a changing room or hall of mirrors exhibit at some amusement park.  It took awhile for that ''look how many of me there are in the mirror"" trick to become old for my 6 year olds.  Really don't need to see my own image from six different angles while trying to have a conversation with my wife.  The hostess and waiter were very polite and informative as it was our initial visit.  The menu is not exactly light reading, and has the look and feel of a Rand McNally atlas.  It can be a little intimidating to someone like myself who eats just about everything, but I cant fault a restaurant for presenting me with a variety of choices.  Plenty of choices for the kids, and that's not always the case.  We were there for lunch and the burger and chicken sandwich we had were quite good, and yes there were leftovers.  We split a delicious piece of cheesecake and left satisfied.  The extensiveness of the menu alone, and the variety of cheesecakes will warrant a return visit I'm sure, I just hope I get a seat away from the funhouse mirrors."
Michael S.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,8,,4.0,12/4/2016,First of all there is nearly always a wait for this place. Just about every time I've been here there was a wait a least 15 minuets. So this is not a quick sit down and eat restaurant.     Now I'm not taking anything away from the wait staff at all. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Anything you ask for they willingly help please you.  On the down side the food does take quite a while sometimes. When I went the stove and other electronics had some type of malfunction and took more time than usual.  Once the food comes it is mostly worth the wait. I ordered a Mac and cheese burger and it never ceases to disappoint. It's never over cooked.  The price on the food is a little pric but not any more than you would spend anywhere else.   The cheesecake is describable in one word incredible!  I would give it 3 and a half stars because 5 stars is in my opinion for only the top of the line.
Linda D.,"Waterbury, CT",0,5,,1.0,7/11/2016,"Worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant! This was my first and last visit to this location. I will continue to take my business to the West Hartford location. This one was just terrible... from the food, service, wait time, organization, and lack of acknowledgement from staff. You guys really need to step up your game!"
Justin L.,"Worcester, MA",202,20,2,2.0,10/29/2016,Had lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the experience was subpar for an expensive chain. I ordered a beer and two entrees and the beer took 30 minutes to arrive. The waiter assured us after waiting 10 minutes they were changing the keg and I told her not to worry about it and she said no I promise it will be only 5 minutes longer. 15 minutes later the beer arrived..very bad. Our entrees arrived and my salads lettuce tasted like some sort of chemicals and was unenjoyable. Overall poor service and less then desirable food for a $45 bill.
Andrew B.,"Narragansett, RI",0,7,,1.0,7/19/2016,"Not the best place and an embarrassment to the chain.  Service was non existent. There were six of us. We arrived on Tuesday around 5:15, place was not busy.  We were initially offered bread with drinks. There were no utensils.  We waited for our waitress, she was a ghost. We buttered our bread with the foil wrappers from the butter. The utensils came after we ate the bread.  Our orders were taken and the meals were ok with the exception of my daughters dish, which she didn't like and didn't eat.  When the waitress came back to clean our table with the dirty plates, you would think she would ask if there was something wrong with my daughters dish...... Nope, totally clueless.  With so many choices out there, we will not be back even though the cheesecake we took home was excellent.  What a disappointment!"
Michael B.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,75,42,5.0,11/11/2015,"Love the cheesecake factory.... Always a good meal, and reasonably priced for what you get.... My wife and I went all appetizers this time.... The menu is HUGE!!!!  and there are so many things on it that I would like to try.... I usually come back to the Romano Crusted Chicken.... dinner plates leave enough to bring home a meal.... they give so much food, I usually dont have room for a slice of their namesake!!! Always a good experience....."
Joel F.,"Waterbury, CT",79,2,3,4.0,9/4/2015,Bangin food ! Must have the crab cakes and Kobe burger I've been here twice already and the food never disappoints! My kids love it too !
Alfred F.,"Hartford, CT",123,193,197,3.0,9/8/2014,"Came to Danbury to meet my daughter halfway, from NYC. My wife and I decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Danbury Fair Mall. Having eaten at the one in West Hartford a number of times, we were gearing up for a one-hour wait. Even though they were in full dinner mode, imagine our surprise when we were sat within 10 minutes! Our waitress, Caitlyn, greeted us as she ran by with a stack of plates for another table, but returned immediately to take our drink order. The menu at CFactory can be overwhelming. It's more of a composition book then a menu, with page after page of drinks, appetizers, chicken, salads, sandwiches, and several pages of ""specialties."" One of the rules of thumb regarding the size of a menu is, the larger the selection, the less likely they can do it all good. I will say that, in our trips to CFactory, the offerings have met our expectations. The food has always been fresh, and they put a heavy emphasis on appearance, making sure every plate is a picture. My lovely wife had Chicken Marsala, and I had Spicy Chicken with roasted cashews over Brown rice. Both dishes were decent, attractively presented, and very large. If I could find anything to improve, it would be the amount of sauce on my chicken, and its consistency...a little too goopy and a little too much. Otherwise, it was tasty. The highlight of course is dessert, where you have the menu returned, and there you are looking over two pages of cheesecake varieties, and even 2 or 3 non-cheesecake sweets! we each had our favorites - Carrot Cate Cheesecake, and Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Hard to think there was still room in our bellies, but the plates went back to the kitchen empty! This is the kind of place where you can make a date with your friends or family to meet for drinks at their upscale bar, or sit and be professionally served. In either case, you should be able to enjoy yourself."
Brandon W.,"Westside / Home Park, Atlanta, GA",0,1,1,2.0,10/16/2014,"First off for Thursday night football and how dead this place was service should have been top notch. It took this staff 10 minutes to greet us. When my cousins and I were finally greeted it was by a manager who shouldn't have had to even be put in this position to take my order.  I ordered a beer and was asked for my ID which was fine, the manager then came back 2 minutes and asked me for my ID AGAIN because she forgotten birth month which by the im 30. It then took another 7-8 minutes for them to bring me the wrong drink by finally a server. She then asked for my drink order. She was nice though (just glad for a smile at this point). I finally got my beer. Now for some good news! Hats off to the chef because my dish was AWESOME! Louisiana Chicken Pasta was my dish by the way. I have worked in the restaurant business for 10 years+ as a server and as a matter a fact I've worked at the Cheescake Factory in Virginia Beach for years a while back just to add some validity to this story.   I get it though I was with my two black cousins, one with dreads  and no one wants the $100 bill that you have to tip out for at the end of the night when the people only leave the the famous $5 black tip.  My bill was 27.07 and I left $5.41 (20 %) for terrible service as just the standard I feel servers all deserve! I still don't know who my server was by the way. The guy who took the bill was cool though.  Step ya game up!!! *by the way my two cousins who didn't eat play for the NFL. Don't judge a book by its cover!"
Tiffany P.,"New Windsor, NY",0,3,,1.0,3/25/2017,So annoyed that they told us 25-30 min wait and we finally sat an hour and 15 min later. It's not the first time it has happened but it will be the last because I won't return.
Alissa P.,"Middletown, CT",302,13,2,3.0,5/25/2016,I feel like my friend and I were forgotten about. Service was lacking from a fellow server view point. The food was delicious and came out hot. I just wish we didn't have to wait 20+ minutes for our check.
Richard D.,"Ridgefield, CT",3,18,1,2.0,8/19/2016,"Forget about it, after waiting 45 minutes to seat down, our appetizers came out cold, we had to send them back,then burgers some of them were rare that we ordered medium some they were just well done,anyway the service was good but food never again , sorry"
K L.,"Norristown, PA",95,135,191,3.0,9/16/2014,"3.5/5 Conveniently located at the Danbury Fair Mall, this Cheesecake Factory has a pleasant outdoor dining experience.  The entree portions are smaller now so you can finish what you order. The new gluten free menu is greatly appreciated, although I hope to see more than one gluten free cheesecake option available in the future."
Robert J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,,1.0,9/23/2016,Terribly run. Manager is rude and so are the servers. BAD BAD BAD all around. Avoid this place. Poor representative of a once great restaurant from California.
Peter T.,"Brookfield, CT",328,44,166,5.0,6/12/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory was something I really looked forward to opening in the Danbury area. I had been to the one in White Plains, NY many times and was familiar with the menu. In comparison to the NY restaurant Danbury is smaller but equally grand. When they first opened the wait for a table was pretty long. I remember leaving without being seated after almost an hour wait. Now that the newness has phased out I was able to get a seat within 10 minutes on a Thursday night. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal here. Standard Cheesecake Factory favorites like the Steak Diane and the Chicken Madeira deliver with full flavored sauces, tastefully seasoned sides and large portions served on large plates.  The steak came out cooked to order. I tried their Shrimp Scampi which was also delicious. Nice large cloves of well cooked garlic with great balance, low acidity.  The wait staff was outstanding. I thought it was almost funny that we had close to 4 different attendants plus a manager stop by our table but they all introduced themselves, they were truly working together as a team and it was nice to see such a happy, polite and attentive staff ready to serve. They truly know what they're doing with who they are hiring here. Had the signature cheesecake for dessert. Rich and creamy with whipped cream on the side, very good. All in all a great experience and I can't wait to come back soon!"
Frank P.,"Bethel, CT",4,53,9,4.0,4/29/2016,Ok personally I don't like this place... Food is ok drinks are great! The line and wait to get in is crazy!!! It's not worth it! My wife loves it here. That means I have to wait! So I give it 3my wife says 5so I came up with 4???
Ronald S.,"Manhattan, NY",12,50,155,5.0,7/2/2015,Very delicious lunch (avocado egg rolls and Thai lettuce wrap) with excellent service and seats by the window!
Danny B.,"Norwalk, CT",3,162,,4.0,4/23/2016,Cheesecake Factory is a good place be warned tho very busy on the weekends went on a Saturday with my Girlfriend we ended up waiting about 20 minutes or so for a Table at 4:00 for Table of 2 I like how they gave us a little Device that Lights up when the Table is Ready Ours tho had a Technical Difficulties problem and never went off when it was ready when I went to check on my table 25 minutes later Discovered it was ready they were professional about it and seated us right away Try the Resses Peanut Butter cheesecake it is Amazing you cant go to a Cheesecake Factory place and not have any Cheesecake
Sharon M.,"Mahopac, NY",0,5,,2.0,12/8/2016,They gave us the wrong cheese cake for thanksgiving so they said they would credit the card nothing yet and I been calling them and they keep tell me they will call me back.  I'm up set they we didn't get the cake we order and now we have to fight with they about the credit  So if you order a cheese cake check it before leaving the store.
Amanda M.,"Mahopac, NY",3,2,2,4.0,9/1/2014,The Cheesecake Factory Was very yummy and I recommend this as a dinner or lunch. Our server named jake was very helpful and nice. The appetizers came out a little late but the people that worked their apologied and was very professional about it. The burgers are very good and it comes with French fries.  The Mac and cheese balls were very good as a appetizer. The cheesecake is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!
