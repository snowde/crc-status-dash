Gonzalo E.,"Danbury, CT",0,3,,5.0,11/23/2016,This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. Food and service are very good. My family and friends always enjoyed the food and the cheesecakes are to die for.  Highly recommended.
Caitlin G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,77,9,4.0,3/22/2016,Good service. Standard Cheesecake Factory. They have a lot more healthy options on the menu now than in the last. The ultimate margarita is very good.
Quisha E.,"Stratford, CT",34,15,7,1.0,3/11/2015,"I called in to place an order and was placed on hold for 20 minutes...4 minutes after they opened......I called back to speak to a manager and was placed on hold for 5 minutes....I called back to get the corporate number and was placed on hold for 1 minute and 2 people then picked up the line....didn't give a damn what the problem could have been....needless to say I never got my lunch. I guess it does not matter weather your on the phone or in person, your time is of NO importance to them!"
Julian M.,"Mahopac, NY",0,26,13,5.0,5/7/2016,people always talk about the wait but i always just walk in for lunch the staff is supper nice and the selection of food is A1... Chinese to pasta to pork chops to Mexican lol u can't go wrong with this place
Kirstie S.,"Woodbury, CT",36,55,5,2.0,3/5/2016,"Gargantuan menu and portions do not fine dining make. Depressing ""factory"" like experience. Excruciatingly long wait with throngs of people."
Jimmy W.,"Greenwich, CT",15,23,135,4.0,4/4/2015,Collin and Andrew were Rockstars. Exceptional service and upbeat. Great night. Thank you. Good luck Collin. #ServiceExcellence
Greg K.,"Southbury, CT",25,48,53,4.0,7/12/2013,"It is what it is...  and I enjoy every visit.  Big menu and I've never been disappointed with my choices.  Drinks equally as good.  Service is consistently good, despite what seems like high turnaround.  All of these reasons are why I keep wanting to go back, why I choose it over neighboring competitive establishments.   Cheesecake is always very good - but it's the Cheesecake Factory.  They just don't disappoint."
Adam B.,"Brewster, NY",0,17,22,1.0,6/25/2016,No longer one of my favorites.  Ordered crab dip and deep fried mac balls.  Crab dip was complete garbage which almost caused me to get sick on the spot.  The Mac and cheese balls were cold in the middle.  Let our waitress know about both complaints.  She said the only option was to talk to the manager.  Manager never came over.  I am putting in my sell order for all of my CAKE shares on Monday.  Stock is going to tank based on what I have seen.
Logan G.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,93,14,5.0,11/29/2015,"The food was great as ever. But our server was the best! Vee, you could not have provided a better dining experience. It was probably the best part of the chain I have ever been to."
D K.,"Winter Garden, FL",0,13,1,2.0,6/22/2016,Awful. Just awful. It took the server a full 10 minutes to even realize I was seated and waiting to have my order taken. I never received any bread and when he realized this he acted like it would be such an inconvenience to get it so I said not to bother. I had to ask for water and it too was met with an attitude. I guess they're rationing water and ice since there were only 4 cubes in the halfway filled glass. The food lacked flavor as well. So disappointed.
Courtney B.,"Monroe, CT",1,4,,5.0,3/6/2016,"We recently went for my birthday on a Sunday night. The wait was not bad at all, and the service was incredible! Our waiter was Dave, and he was so sweet, funny, and attentive. He's extremely personable and he made our dining experience that much better. I've been here before, but no one has provided me with such the impeccable service. The food was amazing as well!"
Holly A.,"Mount Kisco, NY",54,22,,1.0,8/11/2015,"I hate writting a bad review but I wish someone would of told me before I went,  It was my mothers Birthday on August 8, 2015, the wait was 20 minutes which was fine, then as we were seated to a dirty table that had to be cleaned, the music in the place was so loud we couldnt hear each other, but being it was her birthday we just kept trying to have a good time,  We order one soda one milkshakes, and I just wanted water, to start, when our server brought them mine didnt have a straw when I asked her for one, she remarked, It is our Policy that people who order Water do not receive straws, I had never heard such a thing, Like I wanted to put my mouth on that cloudy mug it was served in, she finally gave me one.....  When our food came my mother's dish came with fries which were cold and we told the server before she left the table, my dish which I had a burger, I had asked for no secret sauce that was on the menu which I found out was russian dressing because they forgot to not apply it and it came with it on, Both the fries and the burger bun were replaced,  They knew it was my mothers birthday and told us if you do not order dessert you get one free for her birthday, but we all order a slice of cheesecake, and were charged for all three,  I dont understand why you are not aloud to have a straw if you order water, why you get a free dessert if it is your Birthday unless you order one, in anycase between the music, dirty table, cold fries and the one request on my burger to please not apply what the secret sauce, I say that because that is how it is written on the menu burger with ""secret sauce"", the dinner was a flop, we left with a headache and unhappy,  We ordered one soda, one milkshake, one water, hamburger, sandwich, chicken dish, and 3 slices of cheese cake and the bill was $97 dollars, It was totally not worth that, I will never go back, and they can keep everything including there STRAWS !"
Helen L.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",1,7,6,5.0,1/10/2015,"Ryan is the BEST waiter ever.  The kid is young & adorable,  but probably the best waiter we ever had. Here tonight (w 7 relatives) celebrating my husband, Philip's 50th b'day. Ryan was efficient, friendly, fast & amazing.  Did not get anything wrong.  Rattled back our orders w ease & was exactly accurate.  They don't take reservations & we had over an hour wait (we spent it at Brookstones & the Danbury Fair Mall).  Normally I would have been pissed about the long wait, but Ryan & the delicious food made it all worthwhile! Come before you're hungry because you'll have a one hour wait minimum. But come. And ask for Ryan .  You won't be disappointed. :)"
Laura S.,"Carmel, NY",0,2,,1.0,8/18/2016,"Had an awful experience last night.  At least a 45 minute wait for a booth (on a Wednesday after 7:30pm).  Then our waiter told us he requested our appetizer be remade because it exploded (buffalo blast).  Then our food came out and my burger was rare (requested medium).  The waiter came over and knew the burger wasn't right so he took it back.  Kept asking my husband if his food was cooked right.  Then I get the burger back and my waiter and a waitress both ask me about the burger.  At this point, it's just bad.  We want to leave (it's now 10pm).  The waiter tells us he takes off 2 sodas from the bill.  We should have been offered something more than 2 drinks for such a miserable experience.  I don't know who dropped the ball, but we woke up this morning saying we won't be returning to The Cheesecake Factory."
Danielle L.,"East Haven, CT",44,237,161,3.0,8/18/2013,"I feel like I don't need to review a place like this because everyone knows and everyone loves it. To me, it's nothing more but a SLIGHTLY classier Applebee's, Chili's or Friday's. I hate those type of restaurants and Cheesecake Factory isn't much better. And I'm not into dessert or cheesecake so that doesn't pursued me either.  Came here at 9pm on a Friday and there was a 30 minute wait so we decided to eat in the bar - first come, first served. The food is good. Slightly expensive for what it is, I like the ""skinny"" menu personally. I can't argue that it's not good, but it's a chain restaurant and nothing that I can't make at home myself. It's middle of the road but I can't change the minds of people that are obsessed with it. Not to mention there aren't many places to eat at the mall besides the food court, chipotle, etc."
D. C.,"Wilton, CT",0,64,2,4.0,6/10/2014,"Here's the deal. Cheesecake Factory, no matter the location, has two problems that will annoy you: long wait times for a table (unless you go on an off hour) and the service is SLOWWWWWW.  Once you accept that, things are good. The food is pretty good. But us dessert fanatics go there for the sweet stuff. And, honestly, I can think of few things that compare to the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake. No joke. In fact, every time I've had cheesecake there (no matter the flavor), it's enough to make me dizzy. My kids shared the chocolate layer cake (the one with chocolate chips on the outside) and it was equally as good. My 5 year-old proclaimed it the best thing he's ever had in his life. :) And he's a pretty picky eater.  Had the herb crusted salmon salad for my dinner and wife had the Americana. Both excellent dishes. Oh, and the sweet potato fries are done perfectly here as well. Staff is very friendly. But, they need to hire MORE. We were there on a Sunday evening. The place was slammed. And we waited well over a half hour for our dinner. They simply can't handle the volume here. Our waiter was ""replaced"" mid-meal. He was forgetful and overwhelmed. Not sure if they fired him on the spot or he was off-shift. I guess they don't feel the need to change this, due to the fact it's been like this for a decade at any location and people still pack the place.  Why? The darn desserts are too good to pass up!"
Jaz Z.,"New York, NY",0,11,1,5.0,12/22/2015,I loved everything about this place. I just went recently with my boyfriend and the service was great. The food was amazing and so delicious I ordered the chicken Madeira and omg!! yummy!!!The dessert was great also. Definitely coming back in the future.
Craig T.,"West Bronx, NY",52,85,122,4.0,7/5/2013,The cuisine is above average. Definitely love the Popcorn Shrimp and Buffalo Blasts. Sit at the bar in these restaurants for faster service. Buffalo blasts and popcorn shrimp are phenomenal. The ambience is stellar. Service is lackluster but that's relative.
Jose C.,"Stamford, CT",11,230,332,5.0,8/30/2014,Excellent place. Great customer service. Food is awesome. Sitting outside is the way to go ( weather permitting). Employess are trained very well.
Mandie M.,"Jacksonville, FL",482,376,925,3.0,1/9/2013,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory long before the chain came to Danbury and in all honestly, it's nothing special. While the food is good, it is extremely overpriced even with the portions being as big as they are. It's just another big chain restaurant trying to make a name for itself. I've only been to this particular location just a few times, but it is always always always packed with people. If you're not a fan of overly loud restaurants, you won't like eating here. For some reason, the decor includes a lot of mirrors. I'm not quite sure why the interior decorator thought that giving the ability to watch someone from around the corner to be a good idea, but it's another turn off for me."
