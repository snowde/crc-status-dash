Alyssa B.,"New York, NY",0,5,2,1.0,7/12/2014,DONT EVEN BOTHER GOING TO THIS DUMP OF A PLACE!!! I COULDN'T BELIVE THIS WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING!! 1) Salt and pepper shakers and table covered in gross butter. When we told the waitress she got all pissed off and never came back to the table.  2)When the manager came over to try to smooth things over. Set are table made sure we had water. There was A PEACE OF HAIR ON MY BREAD PLATE!!! The only good thing that I can say about this was he was very nice.
Steve N.,"New York, NY",92,555,19,3.0,1/9/2013,"The GF loves, loves, loves this place, and that's fair. Nothing's stellar, but everything's interesting. The crowds are a buzz-kill though. The place manages them roughly and maybe that's to encourage everyone to think this is something that exceeds what it is. The crowds also diminish service, which was earnest. We shared a competent , tasty kale salad (sale priced at $6) The GF had the lettuce wraps, I had some pasta dish called ""Evelyn's Favorite,"" that was drowned in olive oil, which was really too bad. The GF's chicken seemed overdone. The dessert, the 30th anniversary chocolate and cheesecake, was what you'd expect. The bill was $50 with tip; no alcohol.  TIP: Lunch portions available; it's what I had, and it was reasonable TIP: Crazy crowds all the f'n time it seems TIP: Crowd management probably underestimates wait times; just sayin' TIP: Wait space uncomfortable TIP: Parking's a grind, even though it's in a mall"
Brittany W.,"Woodstock, GA",11,44,42,2.0,2/15/2015,"Paid $26 for a steak dinner and received 2 pieces of asparagus, room temperature smashed potatoes, and over seasoned steak. The restroom facilities were filthy, and service was shoddy. For the amount of money you pay, for not just food, but beverages, too- not satisfied. I've been to The Cheesecake Factory before, not this location, and wasn't so dissatisfied. Tonight I'm leaving feeling like I just went to an overpriced Applebee's."
Dl N.,"Redding, CT",0,30,1,1.0,3/1/2016,"Inconsistent meals served here! Ordered the same thing as another person eating dinner with us and her meal was completely different than mine. Asked for some sauce, received a bland dish of ""God knows what"".  Asked for two pieces of cake to go, received one!  This place has gone completely down hill when on a slow night they cannot provide a small cover...AVOID this chain who needs a great deal of help!"
Budd V.,"Hyde Park, NY",14,5,,3.0,11/25/2015,"Went on a Monday afternoon. Several empty tables but none clean. Waited 10 minutes for someone to clean a table for us. Drink orders taken quickly. I ordered an Americana burger, well done , my wife ordered tuna salad. My burger was so rare it was inedible. After several minutes the server asked us if we loved everything, I told him my burger was much too rare and his response was, I'll go yell at the cook. No offer to fix the problem. My wife loved her tuna."
Mia A.,"Enfield, CT",0,17,22,4.0,4/30/2014,"I think The Cheesecake Factory's reviews haven't really been all that fair. It's honestly one of the most consistent places around- with tons of options for both food and drink. It's really good food at a reasonable price, and the size of it gives you a surprising amount of privacy and comfort. I'd definitely say it's much better for lunch than dinner though. My favorite thing is that if you're ever unhappy with your food and send it back, it comes out cooked to perfection. Every single time I've done this, the dish comes out flawless. To be honest, it's made me a little pickier with them than I probably should be haha Make sure to stop by on a Thursday for lunch if you can. The tortilla soup is definitely a favorite of mine, as is the dynamite shrimp and shrimp and angel hair pasta. Enjoy!"
Sandy S.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,31,7,3.0,5/25/2016,"Let's start off with the good stuff. The food was deeeee-lish, as usual. I'm a fan of the fried macaroni and cheese off of the appetizer menu. Additionally, we got an ample amount of bread fulfilled each time that we asked. (However, the waiter did lie to me about what type of bread it was) The patio area is also lovely during the warm weather season.  However, our waiter was almost nonexistent and often left us feeling forgotten. The patio was about 70% full, with 3-4 waiters watching tables. Our waiter seemed to be the one that was never around. It took a solid 10 minutes for us to even be greeted after we sat down. There was a 20 MINUTE window between when our desserts were delivered and when he returned with the check. Though our waiter was nice, we felt neglected and were antsy to leave by the end.  Overall, I would return to The Cheesecake Factory for the food, but would question this location due to service."
Diplomatic M.,"New York, NY",0,82,4,1.0,10/25/2013,"Came here for dessert with my hubby.  Can you believe my cheesecake was frozen in the middle! When our server came around and I told her she said ""oh sorry I saw then nuking it in the microwave and thought it would have defrosted"".  WHAT??!!! Sorry CF I thought at least your desserts would be the best but I guess your restaurants are just another fast food chain looking to push food out without a care."
Javier Q.,"Chicago, IL",70,70,1,5.0,4/28/2014,"I came here during Easter weekend with my mom and sis.. I live in Chicago and I also worked for the Cheesecake Factory here in downtown Chicago so I was curious to go to another Cheesecake factory somewhere else. The waitress was so awesome, I forgot her name, but she is expecting a baby....She was a definition of great customer service.... I wanna say thank you to her for being awesome!  That's all! =]"
Reinhard L.,"Hilden, Germany",4,187,7,4.0,4/27/2015,"A very good place to eat cheese cake, really. It was an embarrassing experience for us: The first time in our life we didn't manage to eat up the piece of cheese cake, even that it had been really delicious. A good place, but not cheap. Anyhow, strongly to recommend!"
Tj C.,"Ridgefield, CT",0,3,,1.0,1/2/2015,I've been here a bunch of times since it's around the corner from my house but I just got food poisoning from there. I ordered the Americana burger. It will take me a long time to go back there. I'm very disappointed.
Barbra Z.,"White Plains, NY",0,17,5,4.0,6/13/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always a hit with our family and friends. The food and service is consistent . There is so a large selection but something for everyone . Lots of favorites! Lunch , dinner drinks after shopping , the bar have all been great ! The downside is there is a wait. So you really have to plan ahead. We leave for shopping and get our name on the list when we arrive if this is where the kids want to dine.  We shop first then the wait is not so bad. They screwed up our reservation once . It led to an additional hour wait. My kids were starving but wanted to wait so we went to the bar. When my husband inquired about the wait rather than my 13 yr old daughter, it moved faster and the staff was helpful. Always a good choice for us!"
Stephanie C.,"Boston, MA",15,4,1,1.0,3/22/2016,"Had the worst experiences ever. Friend and I went for dinner where we waited an hour for food. First I  was told a dish could not be made with avacoda. Ok no big deal so they  suggested a more expensive dish...ok fine. Next I was told I could not get the entree I ordered because they were out of buns and the delivery would be 15 minutes. I asked if i could get another dish for the same price. The manager said no. I decide to wait the 15 minutes.  That turned into 30+ minutes. No refills on water, nothing. So an hour with only an appetizer. At that point we asked for the check. The waiter was so kind and embrassed but the manager was very nasty and just offered to have me more food. But you can't even bring me what I ordered. .. NOPE. I  am from out of town  and just wanted a nice dinner out. I have been to many restaurants and this was a horrible experience. I would not suggest anyone go to this place of you are hungry."
Grace C.,"Bethel, CT",0,34,45,4.0,4/26/2015,"Service is great. Attentive and food serves in good timing. Food is delicious. I have the fish tacos, and it was amazing. reasonable pricing will definitely come back again."
PJ V.,"Newtown, CT",0,79,81,3.0,3/22/2015,Went to lunch at Cheesecake Factory entrees were good however the cheesecake and chocolate cake seemed old and dried out.. obviously plated hours earlier then refrigerated.
Rochelle C.,"Stamford, CT",36,303,1211,3.0,3/6/2012,"Come when you are not hungry (yet) because by the time you are seated, you will definitely be starving. This place is small compared to the other locations - about half the size of the White Plains and Palisades locations. We came here on a Saturday, around 1ish and was not seated til after 2. We were craving their calamari so we endured the wait. Good food as always but what stood out the most was our server, Jaime - he was friendly, funny and fabulous  I don't think we'll ever be back (anytime soon) due to the wait time; probably will do a curb side pick up next time."
Liam M.,"South Salem, NY",0,55,,4.0,4/7/2016,Pros. The cheesecake here is probably the best I ever had. The severs are kind and friendly. The wing and fries are great!    Cons. The service can sometime be slow and the wait is usually long but worth it!
Mimi K.,"Southbury, CT",13,93,273,5.0,7/7/2013,"I love this place.  It is very unique. It gets 5 stars for being in a class by itself.  It is not your typical chain like TGI Friday's or Outback, but it is also not a NYC steakhouse.  The prices are higher than a Ruby Tuesdays or TGI Fridays and honestly, you can't compare the food.  The sauces and dishes at the Cheesecake Factory are very good and do not have that 'packaged' flavor that  is sometimes found in chain restaurants.  It feels fancy yet offers a casual atmosphere.  You can eat at a table, in a booth, outside or at the bar.  All the workers are friendly. There is usually current music playing in the background. The lighting is on the darker side unless you eat outside during the day.  The decor is trendy and unique. I've been there in jeans and have also seen many casual dressers dining after a day at the mall.  I've also seen other folks dressed very fancy.  Anything goes - as long as its presentable.  The menu has a huge offering. . .  Everything from salads, pastas and steaks to lettuce wraps and numerous offerings from their 'skinnylicious' menu. They have two pages of cheesecake offerings.   My absolute favorite meal is:  deep fried macaroni & cheese balls for an appetizer, Hibachi Steak and the strawberry shortcake.  I also like the plain cheesecake. The deep fried mac & cheese balls come four (4) to an order and is served on a red-sauce.  It is outstanding.  The hibachi steak is a marinated strip steak served with onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts in the sauce alongside smashed red potatoes and breaded asparagus.  The sauce is very flavorful. The strawberry shortcake is so big is is ridiculous.  It is a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream in-between a buttermilk biscuit that is surrounded by fresh strawberries and topped with whipped cream.   Too much food for one person. The portions are huge so plan on sharing or bagging it up."
Jim T.,"Brewster, NY",21,8,2,1.0,6/24/2015,"Place is absolutely ridiculous. Got there at 4pm and was told that it was an hour and a half wait for a party of 8. Ended up being closer to 2 hours. Will never go there again on the Weekend with any amount of people and will never go there again with more than 3 people, regardless of the day. Food was very good & so was the Service. The wait was unacceptable."
Amanda T.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",6,73,169,4.0,2/9/2014,We had a party of 9 and arrived at 7:30- we were quoted an hour and a half- we weren't seated until 10. This restaurant is very small unlike the cheesecake factory in palisades mall. We were very inpatient and hungry at this point but luckily we had the greatest waiter I think I have ever had. He had no problem splitting our check and catered to our every need. He recommended the pasta dish with tomato basil and mozzarella cheese which was fantastic. The cheesecake was delicious. Besides the long wait the rest of the experience was delightful!
