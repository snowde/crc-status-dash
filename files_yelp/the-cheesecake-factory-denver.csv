Sankriti K.,"Aurora, CO",0,22,2,4.0,10/23/2017,"Decent..can be hit or miss due to service and when it's busy..boy it can be busy I love the tiramisu more than the cheesecakes lol..must try! and the bbq pizza amazing.. But maybe serve coffee in ""regular"" cups."
Ellen K.,"Littleton, CO",88,61,,1.0,1/8/2018,"I hate when restaurants LIE, which is EXACTLY what The Cheesecake Factory has done. I should sue their asses off. Corporate and two restaurant managers told me that the Korean BBQ cauliflower wings were VEGAN.  Well this morning someone sent me the recipe for their BBQ sauce that goes on the cauliflower. IT CONTAINS HONEY. It effing contains honey.  I will share this lie on every single website that recommends restaurants and it'll go viral if I have anything to say about it. Bastards."
M J.,"Fresno, CA",1,60,2,2.0,12/28/2017,"This was a very disappointing visit to CF. My boyfriend and I were seated right away by friendly staff. We got our drinks and put in our order right away, but that's where it all goes down hill. We ordered an appetizer and our main lunch meals and received our plain bread. (Where did the dark bread go?? Other tables had it?) While waiting for 35-40 minutes, our drinks were not refilled and we didn't get our appetizer but instead, our main lunches arrived. Without any warning regarding the hot plate, my boyfriend burned his arm on his plate twice. Finally, our waitress came up to ask us how our food was. We expressed our frustrated with her regarding the delayed food arrival, lack of appetizer, burned arm, and asked for a manager and more ketchup. Once all of these things arrived (minus the appetizer), we were almost done with our food. Waitress admits she never put in our appetizer order and that she would put it in right away, we told her just don't even put it in at that point. We were starving 45 minutes ago.  Manager came up to talk to us and didn't really seem to have much concern, just a business type ""here I'll comp your one dish and a dessert, we are sorry this happened"" kind of thing. Cool. But we weren't looking for a ""free meal"". It shouldn't have happened in the first place as the restaurant wasn't even busy. After walking by us several times, the waitress should have at least asked if we needed a refill on our drinks or checked on our food since we had been sitting there twiddling our thumbs for over a half an hour. My boyfriend's meal shouldn't have been sitting under the heater for however long it takes to burn someone via plate.  To make things even better, we received the check with a charge on it for our ""comped"" cheesecake slice and were told we had to pay for it because we were comped the appetizer... which we never received.  Once all was said and done, an hour and a half later for a burger and a salad, we finally ended up paying for my meal and our drink, which was great. But left frustrated and with a headache.  Birthday cake cheesecake, however, was the best part of the whole meal."
Frank L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,29,1,2.0,11/26/2017,"I was in Denver for Thanksgiving.  I have not been in Denver for close to 30 years, so my experience at the restaurant becomes emblematic of dining in downtown Denver.  Perusing the many comments on this CF location I know I am just going to repeat the obvious:  uneven food, uneven service.  We had a large group, 10+ people.  Food at one table was brought out 10-15 minutes before the other table.  Our other table was ready to go and I was shoveling food in my mouth to keep up.  My salad was supposed to feature avocado.  It became a game to identify the small chunks of avocado in the salad; maybe there was a slice.  Food at both tables was below standard.  Two meals were comped by management.  All of us received free cheesecake as compensation.  The cheesecake was good. So I can established that my experience was not good, and I can read through the reviews and see that other folks have experienced the same problems; uneven food, uneven service. Beyond blaming the operations of the kitchen the way our server did, I'd like to know what CF is doing to correct these deficiencies, and not just some corporate platitude statement extolling the goals.  Really, what is changing.....?  I would start with slimming down the voluminous menu.  Way to many options and something gets lost when you offer too many selections. So for downtown Denver dining, my one experience is at CF, and that really was not too choice.  Is that representative of dining in Denver?  If so, I head to my favorite places in Tucson or Phoenix."
Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3791,2015,5525,3.0,10/3/2017,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a 30-something birthday than a trip to REI, followed by a slice of Cheesecake Factory. That's right, folks, this is what happens when you're one step closer to 40.  This was my first visit to the Denver location, but I've had many a Cheesecake Factory experiences before: Palm Springs, Boulder, LA, St. Louis, SF Bay Area, Waikiki... They're all pretty much the same. Large portions, rich food, and A-OK drinks to boot. My personal favorite cheesecake is the raspberry white chocolate truffle. But I also enjoy the lemon raspberry cream, Reece's, or tiramisu. Who am I kidding? Cheesecake is one of my favorite foods -- you could put any slice in front of me and I'd go to town on it. I've never had to wait for a booth/table because eating at the bar is where it's at. Chat it up with the bartenders and watch them sling ridiculously large, sugary drinks to go along with the big ass entrees. Recommendation: Raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake + split bottle of sparkling wine. Happy birthday to me!"
Casey D.,"Denver, CO",1036,274,2130,3.0,7/17/2017,"Great Servers - Pricey Food The Cheesecake Factory is Americana on steroids. You'll find all of the national favorites, from burgers to fried catfish. And the portions are quite hefty. The servers are really wonderful as well. That's the good news. The bad news is the price. Your wallet and/or purse will not be happy with you after eating here. You can spend upwards of $80 for two people on a meal that really isn't worth that amount."
Chris S.,"Denver, CO",0,12,1,1.0,1/7/2018,"This will be the last time I ever order from Cheesecake Factory. Only dish I liked was lemon herb chicken. No longer chicken on the bone- it is now small cutlets- very dry. They didn't have order ready for delivery driver and it took a really long time. When it finally arrived, food was cold. Mash potatoes were like a brick - worst I've ever had. Called manager to see why it was delayed and he said they forgot to sauce it. He said there was nothing he could do for me since it was ordered through Door Dash. Food was terrible for the price. CF won't stand by their product."
Tara T.,"Denver, CO",273,85,150,3.0,8/10/2017,"Update 8/10/17: We went here last Sunday afternoon around 3:30. They were out of some flatbread my BF wanted. Not a big deal. He ordered a margarita that was served in a wine-looking glass. If he had an ice fetish he would have been in cloud 9, but no such luck. The drink was completely FULL OF ICE. He had literally 4 (normal) SIPS and it was gone.  The service was absolutely horrible. I'm not a serial complainer but damn.... and the place wasn't even busy! I get the Tuscan chicken when I go here- I finished my leftover breast today and there were about 8 spots of gristle in it that I had to spit out. Pretty disappointed with this visit, Cheesecake Factory.  __________________________ Tuscan chicken!! Do it. Very healthy and flavorful.  Service was good but my green beans weren't brought out until the end of my meal. Not a dealbreaker though, and we'll be back."
Fadzai M.,"Denver, CO",146,74,111,5.0,3/19/2017,"Delicious food, amazing service, and ridiculously affordable prices in the heart of downtown Denver!!! I'm surprised this place doesn't have 10 stars. I've been coming to cheesecake factory for a couple of years now and they never let me down. The wait on a weekend is about 30 minutes but well worth it. The inside the decor is classy, they have a cute little section to shop for what seems like hundreds of different flavors of cheesecake, and a very romantic and hip dinner setting. They also have the option to dine outdoors on the patio on warm days.  Without hurting your pockets you can enjoy a nice date night, a happy hour hangout with friends, or a birthday celebration which they LOVE to do here (they always make you feel special with a cheesecake on the house). Definitely on my top list of places to go!!"
Hanan G.,"Denver, CO",98,105,721,4.0,6/24/2017,This place hit  the spot. I didn't get my drink and food that quick but it was worth waiting. Maybe I'm just spoiled.  I was just informed that the food came out at the proper amount of time.
Sara E.,"Castle Rock, CO",9,88,26,3.0,7/21/2017,"3.5. This was a good meal, even though I had to ask for the second sauce they forgot to put on the dish--not a big deal. Our server was kind and pretty much in the ball. We had the chicken Bellagio and it was very tasty as always. Their bread was soft and warm. The Oreo cheesecake was luscious. Shared everything--the portions are too large to not share unless you want tomorrow's meals taken care of too. We will always come back to The Cheesecake Factory."
Peng X.,"Denver, CO",0,1,4,4.0,11/13/2017,"That's nice,chicken sandwich is good, I'll try hamburgers next time with my friends,everyone is enthusiasm here."
Shaurica C.,"Denver, CO",834,421,299,5.0,12/11/2016,"What can I say, I love a good cheesecake and a good martini! Stopped in here one afternoon to just treat myself. I walked in and was greeted right away, and made my way to the bar, where I sat for the duration of my visit. My server/bartender, Leah was great! She greeted me right away, answered every question I had in detail, and was just super friendly overall. I ordered the lunch portion Margarita pizza with an Asian Pear martini. What a refreshing delight that was! Once I finished that one, Leah and her fellow female bartender suggested a drink that turned out to be an absolutely perfect finish. Really enjoyed my visit here!"
Parker B.,"Denver, CO",39,120,144,1.0,10/30/2016,"TIME TO GO IN!!! Let me start by exclaiming I would never in any circumstance choose to come to The Cheesecake Factory. This place was in high school one of those places highschool kids took their dates cause it looked classy (inside), and the food was decent (not great, but okay).  My girlfriend while recently out of state tried another location, and found a dish she was recently impressed with, when she came back to CO she tried the dish at a local location on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver and was at that time equally satisfied. The dish I'm referring to is the hibachi steak, Wasabi mashed potatoes, with fried asparagus.  We arrived at the 16th Street location around 430pm 10/30/16 and everything just seemed off from the moment we entered the building. To start the ladies waiting to seat people were off in the middle of the restaurant. So when you walk in you're waiting for someone to ask you to be seated at the Desk right near the door, but no one is there, so you just wait. Then if the two ladies aren't too busy talking to one another or looking down from the middle of the restaurant they FLAG you over, just to walk us back the direction we just came from to be seated.  (I saw two people standing there at the front door for so long they, and they were never approached about seating so they just walked out.) We order two plates...  Coullette steak (rare), mashed potatoes, and green beans (my plate). My girlfriend ordered her favorite, and literally the only reason for visiting this restaurant the Hibachi Steak (extra mushrooms) medium, Wasabi mashed potatoes, and fried asparagus (tempura).  My plate comes and I immediately notice that my steak is medium to medium well (if you're a steak lover, this is a major turnoff). Charred as hell on the outside. Mashed is fine, green beans are hard as rocks. Literally, how can you ruin a RARE steak I decide I'm starving, and don't want to send it back as it seemed to take them forever to bring it in the first place (watched my girlfriend polish off the entire damn near basket of bread we were brought waiting for our meals.) I was so hungry I would have literally ate cardboard at this point.  My girlfriend starts to dive into her meal, and notices that the steak she was given in her meal is mostly gristle and fat, she informs the waiter (Dan) and he proceeds to take the entire plate (not just the cruddy steak), we've both been starving while waiting for! Now, all of a sudden a complaint over the steak translates into take confiscate the entire dish... (Thanks Dan!) While she waited another 35 minutes or so for them to fix her another meal (I'm completely done with my food at this point!!!) supposed to be a different cut of steak from a different steak plate, but they were supposed to plate it the exact same way (Hibachi style, same sides).  Didn't really go down that way at all! We received a second server halfway through our meal named ****Stephen****, he was awesome, and offered to try and rectify the situation some (comp'd cheesecake, Thank you for that!), but between the long waits, bad food, and crappy service from the first waiter we were both over it. The manager had came initially and spoke to my girlfriend after the first plate was messed up, but basically encouraged her to just choose another plate ""as he had no way of being able to tell the quality of the other steaks"" for the meal (he had no idea, that this woman was not interested in anything else on their menu).  The manager never revisited the table to see how the replacement meal turned out. I've had better service at Dennys from managers. The second steak was a better cut, but hardly had any mushrooms whatsoever(let alone extra as she had ordered originally), had no tempura asparagus, etc.  Like when you have your appetite set for something in particular and they mess it up, you kinda just want to leave. We waited so long for our check to come we contemplated walking out of the restaurant at least 7 times. Stephen, later gave the issue back to Dan to fix cause I think he was wanting to get away from the issue. I'm almost happy they ruined my girlfriends taste for this spot, maybe I will never have to come back to this God forsaken place again!!! I'm not sure if the kitchen was just off, or what the hell it was going on with the staff, etc. but people don't want to pay their hard earned money for bullshit. Eat here at your own risk, I could think of at least twenty places in this area I could go for a better meal and service."
Kevin M.,"Denver, CO",89,2,,1.0,10/31/2017,"Original review 10/20/17  I have to say that it was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant.  I ordered a MEDIUM RARE steak and actually saw it sit under a heat lamp for over 30 minutes... Can you imagine the shoe leather steak they tried to serve me?  After a 45 minute wait my wife and I told the Manager to send the steak back to the cook and let HIM EAT IT!  We will NEVER RETURN! UPDATE.... If I could give a NEGATIVE 5 STARS... I would!  This is a followup to my previous post regarding the Medium RARE steak that sat under the heat lamp for 30 minutes and served to me looking like shoe leather.  Well today I got the most pathetic apology letter with absolutely NO RESOLUTION AT ALL!  They didn't offer jack ""S"" to try to keep me as a customer!  My wife and I have eaten there on many occasions, as we both work downtown Denver.  It will be a cold day in hell before we go back..... Carrie S. is a poor excuse for a manager, lacking in customer service and support to say the least!  Do yourself a favor and go to ANY other restaurant.  Either The Thirsty Lion or Maggiano's would be a far better choice!"
Kuku K.,"Glendale, CA",4,11,,4.0,12/8/2017,would def. come back here to eat. Great staff great service and food :0)
Debbie L.,"Wilson, KS",22,23,38,4.0,10/16/2017,"Stopped in for a light lunch and of course a piece of cheesecake. We had the Chicken Potstickers. I had the Banana Cream Cheesecake and my husband had the Celebration Cheesecake. I thought the potstickers were okay. The Banana cheesecake was the best. But the Celebration cheesecake was good too. It had cream cheese frosting that was a little dense and too sweet for me. Next I want to try the lemon torte cheesecake,  so yes I will return."
Argelia A.,"Denver, CO",35,57,,1.0,12/5/2017,"Not really impressed.  It is a chain restaurant after all.  Food is pretty ""basic"".  We ordered takeout.  French fries were cold and bread was burnt.  Just bad all around."
Brian K.,"West Hollywood, CA",2087,103,678,5.0,10/22/2017,Does the Cheescake Factory need another review? You know it's great. You know the food is awesome. Just go already.
Cece P.,"Arvada, CO",105,26,4,5.0,12/10/2017,"My guy and I went here for Prom, and we got very good service and the food as usual was delicious! I love the Cheesecake Factory, we will be back! :)"
Allie G.,"Englewood, CO",96,24,171,5.0,2/27/2017,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. We opted to sit at the bar where Jordan was our server/bartender. We ordered LI Iced teas and they were awesome. For the 2nd round, we wanted something different. Jordan was quick to throw out some suggestions and even made me a customized drink which was AMAZING!!!  The food we ordered was very fresh tasting and hot! The Nutella cheesecake was to die for. We will definitely go back."
Fe F.,"Denver, CO",12,41,11,3.0,11/27/2017,"The cheese cake factory is very overrated. Ive been to this location and feel like the best thing is the dessert. Ive had the food. The spaghetti is always good and mac n cheese, potatoes au gratian delicous. But ive had better chicken and steak. The last time I attended my chicken was unseasoned and very dry that I had to ask for a side of pasta sauce. I had potatoe skins and mac n cheese which were delicious. I also had a steak with mushroom that was a bit over cooked and needed the mushroom sauce...i am of sauces but you cant tell me that the best place to get a burger would be at a sushi bar? Over all i love the Banana and peanutbutter cheese cake. Delicious."
Bridget C.,"Centennial, CO",27,3,,5.0,12/29/2017,"Amazing service . Food was out extremely fast and never needed a refill on my drink , it was always taken care of. Been to other Cheesecake Factory's but this was by FAR the best. Very happy with the food and the staff here!! Very impressed!!  If your looking for a good place to eat I HIGHLY recommend!"
Brett H.,"Travelers Rest, SC",57,187,490,3.0,8/5/2017,A coworker and I were taking a customer out to lunch and they suggested the Cheesecake Factory.  The service was prompt and attentive and everyone enjoyed the food.  For a quick business lunch this was ideal as its on the same city block.
Kennan B.,"Cortez, CO",45,10,,1.0,10/15/2017,This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The service absolutely sucks. Do yourself a favor and don't come here.
Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",171,15,19,1.0,10/1/2017,"I debated about posting this, but the more I talked to other Yelpers about it, I decided I need to. A few weeks ago, we sat at the bar just to order dessert and watch the end of a football game. I only ate half of my slice of cake and was looking up at the TV when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye. I looked down to find a roach running around on my plate. I immediately grabbed my phone to document and the bright flash in the dark space caught the bartender's attention. I told her there is a roach on the plate and she immediately took it. When she came back she simply said ""I didn't see a roach."" Well, here is the video of the roach crawling on my plate on September 7th."
Chris B.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",47,313,25,4.0,1/19/2017,"I was not prepared to like this place. I usually hate these big chain restaurants but I was pleasantly surprised. For one, we had  breakfast, not the over the top, pseudo-ethnic mess they serve for dinner.  Breakfast was great, well done traditional fare. It did take forever to get from the kitchen but we just had extra bloody marys... maries... mary-s."
Suzi N.,"Aurora, CO",1,8,3,1.0,10/28/2017,Never like this place. I don't like the food n expensive. I would rather go somewhere else. My friends like coming to Cheesecake Factory I don't know y.
Jeff L.,"San Marino, CA",130,337,833,5.0,10/28/2016,Came to The Cheesecake Factory on a Wednesday afternoon as we were on our wait to another restaurant.  The weather was too cold to us weak Southern Californians so we found refuge inside this restaurant.  We have all been to other locations before so this was somewhere we could all agree upon. Food was great.  We shared the guacamole and our waitress offered to put chilis on the side since we couldn't decide between non spicy - mild - spicy.  What a great solution to our problem.  I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it was wonderful.  Service was wonderful and the servers were very attentive and they were constantly refilling our drinks.
Manoochehr S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,1.0,4/18/2017,"I just waited an hour on my steak, but when it comes, its dry and cold. Don't eat at this place ."
sara l.,"San Diego, CA",3,35,8,3.0,10/8/2017,"Came late one night just for dessert and were seated in a roomy booth and had an attentive server who offered to make a fresh pot of decaf when I ordered coffee.  As expected, dessert portion was huge and after our fill, had the remainder packed to-go. I'm not a huge fan of chains, let alone visit CF often, yet the experience was what I expected.  The bathrooms we're clean and offered hand lotion, which is fancy!"
Beronica C.,"Dallas, TX",6,3,,1.0,7/4/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and normally this is my go to place when dining out of town with the family. We were seating very quickly which was nice but our service was beyond terrible!!  The waitress failed to refill our drinks, bring the alcoholic drinks, or even bring the table silverware. We waited for more than an hour for our food while the people around us got their food fairly quickly. The food was cold and pasta was hardening up from sitting for a while before getting to us. One of the seafood plates was undercooked. I spoke with the manager which offered to bring another plate for the undercooked one. We didn't bother making more complaints as everyone was tired and frustrated and ready to leave.  Worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory!"
Westin G.,"Aurora, CO",1,23,12,4.0,4/14/2017,"Decent food. I came here for lunch with co-workers on Friday 4/14/17.  I tried the Nashville nuggets which were surprisingly delicious. The appetizer came out quick but our server did drop one of the nuggets.  Also had the lunch pizza and salad.  The pizza was decent but not great.  The crust was crunchy and the middle was soggy.  Not particularly how I like my pizza.  My co-worker ordered the pot stickers which were sitting in a soy sauce that made them too salty. I always have liked the Cheesecake Factory and have been to various locations across the US but I must say, this is the worst looking interior out of all of the ones I've been in.  It just didn't look impressive inside like others locations I've been too. Overall, even though I'll definitely go to CF again, it most likely won't be this location. If you like this franchise, this location probably won't make you any more enthusiastic about the restaurant."
Audra D.,"Middletown, DE",419,4,,1.0,10/12/2017,"Food is decent depending on what you order, any chicken option should come to your table on time, every other time I've ordered anything other then chicken (flatbread, burger, red meat, fish) it's taken longer then an hour and a half. Only reason I'm giving two stars is because the chef behind cheesecake has good recipes and seasonings. Most of the food I've gotten here is not bad but drenched in things. The manager is very rude, rushes around not caring about anyone in his pathways as well as yells as employees instead of taking them to the side or back room... (very unprofessional and not something anyone would want to see from the manger). The floors are very slippery as well, surprised they haven't had anyone fall. After evaluations I have to give this place a one star review."
Ashley R.,"Aurora, CO",119,12,5,1.0,2/11/2017,"Vegetarians beware!!! I ordered a pasta dish, that ordinarily comes with chicken, without chicken. It came to my table, with chicken. I returned it immediately and a few moments later the same plate returned minus the chicken (or so the kitchen thought). I took two bites and then found a large chunk of chicken.  They had literally pulled the pieces they saw out. DISGUSTING!!! I would never have wanted a bite of anything with meat having been laying in it moments before. Poor judgement and training! Manager apologized with a very typical reply. But I no longer trust this place.  I guess if I am looking for positives, lots of space in this place, lots of seating. The wait was quick (30 min at 7:30pm) for a Sat night."
Anthony B.,"Denver, CO",4,8,,1.0,9/19/2017,"TL;DR - Don't order Cheesecake Factory off of Postmates. Let me preface this review by saying we ordered from Postmates, and having worked in the food industry for several years, I'm well aware that you can't judge food from delivery, as you're removing it from it's natural environment. However, I've had both positive experiences with Postmates *and* other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past, and my last experience was not something that left my girlfriend and I wanting to return.  We ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, a classic dish that so many people have grown to love. Being a former chef and having made this regularly, I reached peak lazy when we resorted to ordering from Postmates at 10pm on a Saturday night. (our first mistake? As I could have whipped up an amazing concoction if I had the materials necessary)... But that's beside the point. Anyway, the first thing we noticed about this dish was that it was not typical of a Cheesecake Factory portion. Normally when I go to Cheesecake, I can leave with more than enough food for two people. Not this time. The next thing we noticed was that our pasta showed up cold. Like really cold. This is one thing I can forgive, as I made the decision to order delivery. However, the chicken was stale, the noodles were barely cooked, and the sauce was non-existent. This pasta, as a born-and-bred Italian, made me want to give up pasta forever and become a leaf-eating vegan. Because I know that this stuff *happens*, I'm going to give Cheesecake another chance to wow me. Whether that's in a year, or 2 weeks, who knows... But I'll surely update the review then."
Than N.,"Biloxi, MS",0,4,2,1.0,8/13/2017,I give this place zero star they are prejudice if u ain't white don't go there it take us 30 min to get a drink but the white people came after us got there drink and appetizer guess wat the manager claim he watch this table from now on then we got more drink take them ten min to get straw then I ask bout our wine he say oh I forgot then I got mad I say I ain't tipping but we still tip guess wat the dick head prejudice white guy say in front of the manger I don't need yur tip threw it on the floor in front of the manger didn't say anything so if ya ain't white don't go there period I was force to put one star up Wat kind of franchise wat let them act the way they did guess that manger is prejudice too just like I said if ya ain't white don't go there Beronica u are right cause we not white white Yea u gotta be like trump white to get service there
J M.,"Clovis, NM",5,219,277,5.0,4/19/2017,Lovely location. Sat outside and it was perfect. Service and food were wonderful. Shrimp scampi abd cajun chicken pasta..delish! Also got smores cheesecake..yum!
Kateland F.,"Lansing, MI",22,11,4,2.0,4/25/2017,"Came here for lunch and the restaurant was very dead with maybe 3 tables in the entire dining room. The hostess seated us quickly but was not friendly and extremely curt. Service from then on was extremely slow... from start to finish, the entire process took over 2 hours. To top it off, I have a pineapple allergy and enquired about it for one of the desserts. The waiter reassured me that there was no pineapple after asking me if it was an allergy and after he ""checked with a manager"".  Needless to say... there was pineapple juice in the dessert! So disappointed. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the entrees and apps ordered were fresh and very good."
Vilma S.,"Denver, CO",429,714,2458,5.0,12/31/2015,"Attended a private seminar with my sister and were very pleasantly surprised with the food since I had never been to the Cheesecake Factory. Started off with a very tasty salad and then I ordered the salmon entree and my sister the steak medallions entree. Everything was cooked to perfection and very tasty. The wait staff was very friendly, professional, attentive and efficient. We had a great dinner and since we couldn't eat another bite, took our cheesecake and chocolate cake home (huge portions and so yummy!!). Will definitely be going back again! They also have validated parking if you park at the Tabor Center Lot."
