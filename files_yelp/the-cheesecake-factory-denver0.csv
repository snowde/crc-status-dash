Elle H.,"Denver, CO",2,76,,4.0,10/3/2015,"You know what, this is comfort food. If you don't like comfort food and HUGE portions, then don't come here! Their shrimp scampi is one of my favorites. Wish it didnt go up in price, but inflation is REAL. I like their happy hour! You can get a good deal on DEEP FRIED COMFORT FOOD. Their Chicken Fried Wonton crisps are soooo good. It's the best of hot chicken wings without the bone.  DO NOT ORDER their sliders. They are so whack. You know those microwave white castle burgers you might have had as a kid from the frozen section? You might as well call it that. Presentation and bun quality is whack for this one which is so weird for a place with comfort food right? Their southwestern eggrolls are tasty! Their cheesecake is good too, but I rarely get it since I dont have much of a sweet tooth. I dont know what else is good here. Lemme know! I want to know! I've also had their chicken lettuce wraps and it was enough to share between two women and we were happy afterwards!"
Heather G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",45,298,23,4.0,8/21/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. We almost never have to wait to be seated and our waitress is also prompt and helpful. They have a huge menu which is easy to get overwhelmed with. Also their portions are HUGE! Either go hunger or go with someone to split with. The Cheesecake Factory is also on the worst for you list and with their portions I can see why. They wouldn't be all that bad for you if you didn't eat the whole entree.  The cheesecake is to die for. I have tried just about every cheesecake they offer and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry. I always take mine home, because there is no way I can eat cheesecake after my monster meal."
Anna C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",89,417,256,4.0,3/24/2011,"Ok... Cheesecake Factory in general is no biggie. It's expensive, fattening and pretty standard. You can get 3 days worth of calories all in one meal. With that said, I am a fan of their HAPPY HOURS available only in the bar area!!  Mon-Fri from 4-6 you can get a lot of stuff at $5 and I believe its full size because the portions looked pretty big to me. I came here with a group and each of us ordered about 2-3 things. Everyone got to try a variety of stuff at a fraction of the price. For example, I ordered the Chicken Pot Sticker, normally $9 but only $5 during HH. Que awesome! The Sweet Corn Fritter was pretty delicious too. The Fried Calamari I really liked also ~ que yumm for $5 dollah per item.  I think all Cheesecake Factory have the same HH but call ahead if you wanna double check."
Victor B.,"Lodo, Denver, CO",22,208,9,4.0,8/31/2014,"Come to think of it....I think I've only ever eaten at the Cheesecake Factory once for their dinner/lunch offerings....the other visits have been strictly for cheesecake.  With a menu this expansive, it's hard not to find something that appeals to each individual in your group.  Yes it's a chain establishment but they definitely do their desserts right....."
J A A.,"Denver, CO",0,140,2,3.0,9/13/2013,Weekday lunchtime only (no kids) Bar area only (no kids) love the oriental chicken salad and a glass of wine
Emily J.,"Chicago, IL",357,663,457,1.0,8/20/2010,"I think that the Cheesecake Factory may be partly responsible for the nation's obesity crisis. Their portions are gargantuan, and the sad thing is that people actually enjoy this food. I will give them this, their service is great and the staff is always friendly. The patio does offer great people watching on 16th Street Mall, but these aspects don't outweigh that you will end up eating your own weight in un-flavorful, generic food. Walk around the corner into Larimer Square for some truly wonderful food that won't force you to change into your buffet pants after your dinner."
Aimee L.,"Denver, CO",120,169,236,4.0,3/27/2014,"We went here on St Paddys day for a quick bite. We got a seat pretty quickly sitting in the bar area.  Same menu as the restaurant just not the long wait for a table.  Huge menu with plenty of choices.  I had the lunch portion, a pizza and salad.  The salad was fantastic..the pizza is just okay.  My friend had the Pot Pie and said it was wonderful.  Great service and we were in and out on a super busy day! Worth a try but you aren't gonna get anything here you haven't had before."
Taylor D.,"Smithfield, RI",2,31,,2.0,11/15/2015,"My friends and I were in town for a convention at the Colorado Convention Center. We decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner one night, and we certainly wished we had chosen elsewhere. We waited about an hour for a table, but there was nowhere for us to wait comfortably. We hung out up against a wall, but continuously had to move out of the way because the staff needed to get through with dirty dishes. Once we were sat, our waiter (Russ) came right over to greet us, so it seemed to get better from then on. Wrong. It took over 15 minutes for our glasses of wine to come to the table after we ordered them. Then, once our food finally came out, two of my friends orders came out wrong. One of my friends asked for a side Caesar salad with her burger. Her burger came out burnt and with a small salad of mixed greens and no dressing. It took about 20 minutes for us to get out waiter's attention just to bring her some ketchup so she could attempt to eat her burger. My other friend ordered the steak dinner, which is kind of hard to mess up. She is allergic to wheat, and her dinner came out as steak tips cooked with noodles (which it does not say in the menu)? Again, it took 20 minutes just to get out waiter's attention in order to explain that she could not eat the meal if the noodles were cooked with the steak, in order for him to take it back to the kitchen. He said a new one would be right out. About a half an hour later, when the rest of us were done eating, her replacement meal came out, where we had to ask for it to be boxed because we did not want to stay there anymore. A manager never came over to the table, and they didn't even take my friend's meal off of the bill or offer her anything else. I've worked in the restaurant business, and I typically give the wait staff the benefit of the doubt, but our waiter never apologized for the mix-up and took forever just to bring us our bill. It's safe to say, I would not recommend dining here if you are looking for quality service."
Carol T.,"Denver, CO",52,150,178,4.0,3/16/2013,"Wide variety of options and dependable food and selection that everyone can find something. if it is not too windy, ask for a table on the patio to people watch.  The salad choices here are worthy of return trips - as much so as their cheesecake variety."

Caroline D.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,10,2,3.0,2/20/2014,"Although I do like the Cheesecake Factory, I still wonder why people wait one or two hours to get a table at this restaurant on any given day.  Even though the food is pretty decent, the first question I have is whether the wait is worth it.  Anyway, I was there with my friend and since we were close the to restaurant we decided to have dinner.  My friend got a martini - I was impressed by its size and I started off with a Margarita.  Drinks were good and arrived to the table in less than 3 minutes.  For appetizer we order calamari, the waiter told us that it was his favorite.  It was not bad, especially after dipping it with the sauce that came with it.  For main course we had a Chinese Salad which we felt it was average and we also had Mahi-Mahi, which was too fishy.  We told the waiter about it and the manager stopped by our table and let us choose another dish and he bought the Mahi-Mahi.  We replaced it with a Miso Salmon that was way better.  For dessert we had the White Chocolate  Raspberry cheesecake and it was delicious.  We also got coffees, one decaf and one regular, they were both cold.  It was interesting because I would assume that they are kept in different containers so it was strange to see that both were equally cold.  Anyway, service was good so I won't complain, I'll give them another chance, especially since we have been at this restaurant in several occasions and we have experienced a much better time than our last visit; it was not too bad but we have simply had better experiences at a restaurant that has the potential to average four start but due to inconsistency is sending a mix message."
Alicia H.,"Arvada, CO",77,515,320,5.0,10/11/2010,"Pumpkin cheesecake, don't mind if I do.... and George (female) is awesome! Female vs Cheesecake.... 0 to 1"
Abby Q.,"Broomfield, CO",98,287,8,2.0,9/25/2012,"I really don't understand why people love this place so much. The cheesecake is obviously delicious, but I think they make too many dishes to really be good at making any of them. They put SO much food on a plate, and it's all so rich. Any time I go here I leave with a stomach ache that lasts for at least a full 24 hours.  MEH. There are much better restaurants on the mall."
Becca R.,"Denver, CO",66,332,107,5.0,1/21/2013,"I went with a party of 2 for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. If you've ever been to cheesecake factory, or if you've read the Yelp reviews, you know about the portion sizes. This is a double portion, so make sure to split your entree in half and box it before you blow your pants out.  The service was literally some of the best I have had in Denver. Trudy, our waitress, kept our drinks completely refilled and even brought us strawberries with our cheesecake because that is one of her favorite additions. The food is delicious and comes out piping hot.  The only negatives I would have is: -It is always packed. -The seating is very cramped. They tried to stick us in a tiny table elbow lengths away from another couple and we just requested a different table, which they took care of right away. -This place is loud. I think it's probably due to all of the marble used throughout the decor, but expect to have to raise your voice. -Parking. Though this isn't a problem for me, as I walk, anyone that drives into downtown is going to have to street park or find a garage and pay while you eat.  -It's so pricey. You're looking at $50 for 2 entrees and 2 cheesecakes. And, while I really wanted a drink I just can't do it at $10 a pop. But, if you do what we did and eat lunch and then take home half of everything for dinner, it's not horrible. Definitely worth a splurge in my opinion, as this is one of my favorite chains."
Carolyn H.,"Mesa, AZ",471,352,91,3.0,6/20/2012,"I absolutely love the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes here, which is why I always return to The Cheescake Factory and this particular location is close to the performing arts complex, so it's become the place we go after a night at the Buell or Ellie Caulkins, etc. My last experience here wasn't the best, with the exception of our server (and the tamale cakes).  The restaurant was very under staffed, considering the influx of guests that came in at 10pm on a Tuesday.  There was no one at the check in dek when we arrived, and there were already 12 people waiting to request a table.  When she did arrive, she had to individually seat us, without any other assistance, which meant we waited about 10 minutes before we even put our name down. Then, our poor server got 6-7 tables at the same time and he was definitely rushed and feeling overwhelmed.  We had to wait quite a while to get our food and when it did arrive, the order was incorrect, so it had to be sent back, which increased our wait time (and we were starving!). The food was average that night, and the portions at Cheescake are huge, so that always means two meals for the price of one!  Our server, however, was very attentive, all things considered and he was very apologetic and quick to make things right for us.   The cheesecake itself here is always a great choice, so you can never go wrong with any of their selections.  My personal favorite: Banana Cream Cheesecake.  It's really light and fluffy and not overly sweet.  Oh!  and they do brunch on Sundays.  The waffles are very very good."
Joel F.,"Denver, CO",22,123,14,2.0,10/22/2012,"To be fair, I am not usually a fan of a place with a 12+ page menu, and this experience was inline with the expectation. Four of us went for lunch on a Saturday. Our server was nice, but once we ordered we did not see hiIm again until the food arrived, about 20 minutes later. That is a real 20, not an exageration. When your hungry and waiting, and the restaurant is at half capacity, that is a long time. The industry tries to keep it under 8 minutes.  I ordered the burrito. It looked very nice, and it was huge, but it was very bland. Perhaps I am spoiled being in Colorado, where burritos and green chili are great. I ate about 3/4 and left the rest. In the end for all of us, it was what we expected but hoped to avoid. Lots of options that sound good, with little flavor and mega portions. Not terrible at all, but I won't go out of my way."
Danielle C.,"El Paso, TX",0,18,2,1.0,8/1/2015,This place is disgusting and dirty!! I never seen a cheesecake factory soo nasty! The waiter took our drink order and disappeared for 15mins and got an attitude when my husband asked for cleaner utensils. It doesn't smell clean at all...This place need to get shut down asap
Branda D.,"Broomfield, CO",4,20,,1.0,8/29/2015,So today is my kids birthday we are right now at the cheesecake factory. I will never come back it took over an hour to be seated. It is 8:39 now we were seated at 7:55 after hearing a bunch of different  stories  about why  it was taking so friggin  long. We have 3 little kids in tow and the baby is about to have a meltdown. These people have to be the worst. I have spoken to a manager to no avail  so sitting here with the kids done eating  and the baby crying  makes for a fantastic  fucking birthday
S M.,"Denver, CO",12,321,39,4.0,8/6/2012,"Yummmm.....review for yummy cheesecake only! We arrived late after dinner and were seated on the patio for a round cheesecake and some people watching.  I ordered the turtle and my hubby had the Khalua.  Both were great, super sweet and large enough portions to take home. Service was quick and courteous and not once were we pressured to leave when it came to closing time."
Kelsey S.,"Broomfield, CO",0,4,,1.0,9/24/2015,"Terrible service. When I asked to speak to a manager about my waiter only filling our water up once when we were there for almost two hours, they gave me the ring around. Finally after the manager came over, he was a complete jerk and did nothing to accommodate my group and I."
