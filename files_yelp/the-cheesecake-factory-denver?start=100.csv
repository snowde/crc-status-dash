Lori M.,"Crested Butte, CO",0,6,9,1.0,9/25/2016,Thank you Cheesecake Factory for responding.  Not sure what would happen if I responded in you general mailbox and how you could fix my unhappiness.
Courtney H.,"Denver, CO",38,119,509,5.0,9/17/2015,"Let's begin by saying that cheesecake is my absolute favorite dessert! I have honestly only eaten the food here a handful of times, but I am a frequent cheesecake patron. I have this tradition where I buy a whole cheesecake from here every year for my birthday and I try to get a different one every time. I love the chocolate cheesecakes, the red velvet cheesecake is to die for, and the Reese's one is so sweet I can only stomach half a piece of cheesecake at a time. But my absolute favorite cheesecake is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. It has just enough chocolate brownie cake and equivalent amounts of regular New York style cheesecake. Looking back at the picture of the cake I got last year, my mouth is drooling as I'm typing this. No matter your preferences, there IS a cheesecake for you here; they have so many incredible flavors. Most people hate growing older, but I'm looking forward to it, as long as I'm scarfing some cheesecake while I do it."
Michael P.,"Aurora, CO",104,389,21,4.0,11/7/2015,"I really do like this location with excellent service and great food!  Parking is tough to find downtown, but this is worth the wait.  The price for food is a little steep, but the dessert is outstanding.  Entrees, not bad.  Steak seems to be one thing that they do as well...usually a little underdone.  Still, I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory."
Anna T.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,2.0,9/9/2016,"The good stuff: The service was really good, fast seating, good flavors. The bad stuff: Outrageous pricing. Ended up spending $77 before tip on 2 entrees, some nachos, 1 slice of cheesecake and a cocktail. They don't put prices on the drink menu because they know people won't buy a watered down mojito for $13. Nachos were $14 and were supposed to have chicken but there were maybe 5 pieces in it. Small portions for $20 pasta entrees. Completely not worth the money, especially when there are better restaurants in the area where you'd spend half the cash on twice the food.  Overall- skip it. You'll find better food, atmosphere and pricing elsewhere."
Khampha K.,"Broomfield, CO",80,196,674,4.0,11/15/2014,"Scrumptious, delectable, creamy, flavorful cheesecake... To die for!!! So many different cheesecakes to choose from. I usually go with the original strawberry with a side of hot fudge. Never disappointed. Their menu is rather large but everything I've tried in there is so good. The price is decent, too. I would rather pay for quality but the quantity and quality is on point. We had their shrimp scampi, Shepard's pie, kids spaghetti and meatballs ( which was as big as an adult entree) and cheesecake, of course. Their cheese cake us actually so good that I went back the next day just for dessert and drinks. So sinful but so delightful. They will also validate your parking in the tabor center which is a plus because I dread downtown parking"
S S.,"Pueblo, CO",0,35,,4.0,8/19/2016,"Been here a three times the past couple of months~~always just get cheesecake~~first visit: awesome server, awesome cheesecake~~second visit: awesome server (happily moved us to a better table w/no complaints), awesome cheesecake again~~third visit: ""okay"" server (seemed to forget we were there--btw, reason I'm not giving five stars), awesome cheesecake again~~~we will for sure go back! Btw-love the fact that on a hot Summer day, the air conditioning is cranked up and seems to slap you in the face~~a good slap of course!"
Elizabeth S.,"Aurora, CO",1,12,2,5.0,12/29/2015,"Love coming back here! I haven't been here in ages but every time I do come back the food is always amazing. I had the macaroni and cheeseburger just because I was like ?? How would that work and it was really good. It's pretty massive- I only ate half of it, and I had the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake. Yum!"
Michael L.,"Denver, CO",16,48,1,5.0,6/19/2016,"Came here to give myself a nice relaxing birthday dinner. From the minute I sat at the bar, to getting my drink, bread, dinner, and of course, my cheesecake, it all went spectacularly well. The whole meal was amazing. I could not find one thing wrong with anything. Well done, folks."
Jamie L.,"Broomfield, CO",307,908,1148,1.0,6/26/2012,"Completely Incompetent. I have to drop my rating for this location of the cheesecake factory based on consistently sliding service and food quality coupled with complete lack of response from management. This last incident culminated with paying, yes, PAYING, for a dessert to go, then being held hostage for OVER 20 MINUTES.  No dessert.  No sight of our server, or ANY server.  It got to the point where, about every 4 minutes, we deducted a dollar from the tip.   Then it stopped being funny when I grabbed the check proving that we'd paid, stomped up to the bakery bar, and demanded my damn cheesecake (that I'd PAID for a half hour ago) so that we could leave.   Naturally, I contacted the Cheececake Factory.  About a week ago.  Have I heard ANY sort of reply from them? Nope. Sorry, CCF, but you've slid down into AppleBees territory.  As in:  Next time, I'll hit McDonald's, because I know it'll be better. See ya."
Rilakkuma R.,"Portland, OR",630,59,34,4.0,10/13/2015,Was going to give this place a 5 star but he didn't bring us out bread. Other then that service  was good. And food was good for being a chain. Got my self a bbq burger
Andrew N.,"Austin, TX",38,165,1381,3.0,7/15/2015,Outdoor seating is nice as long as you don't have drunk people walking by on a Friday or Saturday night. Indoors it's super crowded and loud. They should get some sound padding for the walls. I just wasn't impressed by this location.
Tim S.,"Monument, CO",64,584,22,4.0,7/21/2015,"Beautiful interior, friendly service, I assume the food is fantastic.  The bar service is top notch and he didn't miss a beat last night.  My wife and I just stopped in for a drink and some cheeescake and now we're itching to go back and really give the place a test drive.  So far so awesome!"
Madison A.,"Parker, CO",113,55,18,4.0,5/17/2015,"I came here today for brunch with my family. I've been to this Cheesecake Factory many times before, but that was before I started Yelping. The Cheesecake Factory is normal sooo crowded because of the good food, but luckily we beat the rush. There was a marathon going on downtown so we were scared it was going to be pack, but it was surprisingly not. Our server was nice, not bad not great. She checked on us during the meal which was nice.  I love the Cheesecake Factory because they bring out bread and butter before the meal. Very good, very fancy. The prices here are a little high, but there are added amenities with that extra cost. The bathrooms were very clean, and so was the restaurant.  I got the brunch combo to eat, which was two eggs, bacon, and two buttermilk pancakes. I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes with that. It was so good. The Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed me with the food. It's always brought out the way you ordered it, and in a timely manner.  Before you go, make sure you're ready to wait to be seated if you're planning on going during any rushes. This place can get packed! Excellent place to eat. I will be back!"
Kayler H.,"Widener, AR",97,87,774,4.0,7/13/2015,Been here several of times but decided to do a review since I was here! Didn't get any cheesecake but I am tempted! Great place to get dolled up with the girls!
Alex T.,"Littleton, CO",50,34,41,4.0,9/7/2015,"When it comes to food (not desert), the cheesecake factory rates as a simple three. However with the 16th St. view and people watching it gets a one star bump. Recommended to all who pass looking for a nice place to sit and watch people."
Demitri R.,"Lynnwood, WA",324,1594,806,5.0,11/15/2012,"Ive never sat down in here and ate the food. I always come in hit the Cheesecake display order a slice or two and go home.  Ive never been disappointed. And they always have a sample tray out. This time was the Pumpkin Cheesecake. Delicious.  I grabbed my Keylime Cheesecake with whipped creme and headed home.  Friendly employees quickly taking to go orders for Cheesecake and Actual Food. Who knew their was such a thing.  And when i devoured the Cheesecake at home it was delicious. And the fork they put it was a plus, meaning I didnt have to dirty my own silverware."
John L.,"Denver, CO",9,18,10,4.0,10/8/2014,Try the Mac Cheese Balls . Outstanding. I also had the fish tacos. Very tasty.   The only con is:The price for Alcohol drinks are a touch high.   All in all. I have never been disappointed with the Factory. Food is always good. Plan on some time looking over the menu unless you already know what you want.   Lots to chose from. And as always the service is very good.
Teresa H.,"Denver, CO",75,159,264,2.0,6/26/2015,"About the only thing good about this place is the take-out bakery.  Order a piece of cheesecake.  It's over-priced, the piece is too large and can feed probably 4 people.  I recommend taking it home and eating it over the course of a week.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the neighborhood and wanting a sweet something late at night, then this is probably as good as it's going to get.  Personally, I would not eat dinner here as the wait is always too long  and the food is not that great.  I'm not sure why people eat at this place.  It's an over-priced Chili's or Applebees, in my opinion.  blah.  Don't waste time and money with this place when there are plenty of local restaurants downtown with much better food."
Jenn D.,"Westminster, CO",85,114,54,4.0,7/21/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! I absolutely love the avocado egg rolls, but ended up having them as my meal. The don't offer a smaller portion, so to pay $10.95 and then another $10.95 for a salad seemed a little excessive for lunch. Had the Reeces Peanut Butter Cup Chocolate Cake Cheesecake and it was amazing. Service was good. Atmosphere is good."
TJ A.,"Denver, CO",109,70,6,3.0,10/2/2016,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory. I've frequented locations in several different states.  Last night,  my husband and I came to this location for the first time.  We expected a wait but we also requested first available open seating on the patio.  When we were starting to be escorted to a seat inside,  my husband asked what happened with the patio seating. She looked flustered but she apologized and looked for available seating.  When she said we would need to wait my husband told her waiting was out of the question so please go ahead and just seat us.  She responded.. ""well I don't want to seat you if you are angry"". We didn't know how to process that so we took a seat and tried to deal with it.  It went downhill from there. We were sitting next to an obnoxious group of ladies and their waiter leaned over our table to take a picture of them without any heads up.  He didn't even ask us if it would be OK.  It totally interrupted our conversation and quite frankly it was pretty rude. We had to sit there and back up so that he could take pictures of them.  I hate when people lean over me and I really hate it when they do it at a restaurant. My husband spoke with Connor who is one of the managers and he was very professional and courteous.  We decided to stay and eat... until my husband realized that his steak wasn't cooked. He has to have his steak well done.  This steak was red on the inside.  Completely unacceptable! On a positive note,  once we voiced our concerns with Connor, he immediately apologized and made it right. He is really an asset to that establishment and because of his actions we will definitely try this location again."
