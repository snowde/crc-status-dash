William H.,"Broomfield, CO",75,1,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Worst service I have ever experienced! The only time our waiter was prompt was when it was time to run the check. Don was an awful waiter and our dinner took 2 hours! He didn't offer a new fork when he witnessed it drop on the floor, he spilled wine on my girlfriend, he brought out the wrong desert and it took an additional 20 minutes to get the correct one and no apology was given, once we finally got our desert he forgot to bring a fork so we could even eat it, and last but not least as we were finally leaving we see our waiter outside smoking and ignoring all of his tables! Because the service was so bad this dinner took so long we ended up missing the event we intended to enjoy downtown and I had to run back to the car to feed the meter. This location doesn't even deserve 1 star! We will never be returning and I would avoid this location if possible. Don you are awful!!!"
Joshua S.,"San Diego, CA",198,486,234,4.0,4/21/2015,"Overall pretty good. Nothing extravagant that would make it stand out from any other CF but as usual the food was great. Chicken and Biscuits are amazing. The ambiance is dark and pretty quiet compared to other CF's that have one huge dining room, such as in Orlando. I like the setup here."
Kevin M.,"Logan, UT",0,16,,3.0,5/26/2016,This place is awesome for my wife and I since she has Celiac and has to eat gluten free. Our waitress was very accommodating and was willing to go and ask the cooks about anything we had concerns with. The food we ordered was very tasty and typical of other locations we have eaten at. This location gets three stars because: 1. My glass of water came out with some good sized white mass stuck to the inside of the glass. 2. Our food took a while longer to get to us than I would have expected. 3. Parking in there area is limited and will cost you money no matter where you end up.
Zeke S.,"Slidell, LA",0,26,3,1.0,3/21/2015,"So I'm a big fan of CFs and have been to quite a few all over the US. This one doesn't pass muster.  Arrived at five, was quoted 30 minute wait. No problem, we expected that. This restaurant is smaller than the CFs I've been to and it's especially crowded up front by the hostess stand. Waited outside in the street and was buzzed back at around 5:40. Fair enough. Then was told to form another line where we waited another thirty minutes while harried employees struggled to get organized and seat us. Seriously. Thirty more minutes. We soon realized that there was no rhyme or reason to when people were being seated and noticed that people who approached the desk were seated next. We did the same and the hostess just shrugged, grabbed menus and took us to our table. Wtf.  Service was spotty. Yes, it was busy, but all CFs are, and the well managed locations still provide excellent service.  Food was good.  Disappointing experience. Never again."
Steve R.,"Bishop, CA",0,5,,3.0,11/17/2016,"We were in town visiting, met an old friend here for lunch. Service was good but the food was kind of bland. I had the Cubin sandwich which was okay, I also had one of the deep fried avocado's our guest was having both of which were lacking in flavor. Atmosphere was pleasant. Probably will not dine here again."
Osei T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",38,2,3,4.0,2/14/2015,Servers were very friendly. I had the pork chop w/Apple sauce. Meat was cooked and seasoned well. But was quite fatty. Mash was great as was the Apple. Price was a bit pricey for what type of place it was but nothing too crazy. Lastly the Red Velvet Cheese cake was amazing.
Carlos P.,"Denver, CO",15,55,5,4.0,3/29/2015,"I met this place back in Miami and loved it immediately. The food is really really good, the attention is also good and the ambience is definitely different. If I can think of a not so good thing about this site, it may be the noise level. For obvious reasons these franchises are so damn popular, so wherever you go they'll always be packed."
Hortencia C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,21,57,5.0,4/3/2016,"Excellent food and service.  I recommend the Asian Chicken Salad and the fried mushroom, avocado, and zucchini appetizer.  The lemonade is a little too sweet for me though so just go with a water."
john W.,"Denver, CO",98,662,21,4.0,12/18/2013,"We go once a year on Nicole's birthday. The menu is a 57 page monster. If you can't find something here you want to put in your face, well go outside and chew grass. That said, I don't enjoy the place much myself, not for lack of choices, mainly just because it's a gigantic chain full of suburbanites. You get downtown from your earth-toned suburb and eat here? Well that's fine, at least i know where to find you. The food is good enough the JW Lemonade is quite tasty and makes being there tolerable as only the best alcohol could."
S. Q.,"Aurora, CO",4,40,4,3.0,10/18/2014,"WTF is up with all the ads in the menu? TACKY. We were undecided between Cheesecake Factory and Maggianos downtown.  I'd never been to the Cheesecake Factory so we chose here, however we probably won't ever be back.   We almost left after being bombarded with ads in our menu and given plastic cups with no straws to drink out of - if you're going to go for that, go for it and charge less for the food.  I asked for a glass to drink out of and they did bring me one.   The reason it gets 3 stars is because the food was alright.  I ordered the Tuscan chicken off the ""Skinny"" menu.  I was relieved ""skinny"" meant low refined carbs not small portions since it was about $17.  It was a very acidic dish with balsamic vinegar and lots of cherry tomatoes, but I thought it was very tasty."
Daniel L.,"Cordova, Memphis, TN",14,12,2,1.0,3/18/2016,Worst experience with a CCF. Won't do reservations for a party of 15 and yet it's an hour to two hour wait for an available table as they seat everyone who comes in after you in rows of tables that are together in sections.
Tony K.,"Aurora, CO",4,138,3,2.0,8/3/2016,"This place is an absolute rip off. We stopped in for lunch and a cool day in the city and what we got was a cold shoulder and an old fashioned hold up. The service was very slow and the wait staffs ""git up and go had got up and went"". Then my wife ordered a Mojito from the lunch menu. It was our fault that we did not ask the price up front since it was not listed on the menu. I ordered a margarita under the same circumstances. When we got our check we were floored. The Mojito was $12.50 for what could not have been an 8 ounce glass. My Margarita was $9.50 and it was served in a modified and small wine glass. (And to add insult to injury, after lunch we set out on 16th street and 3 doors down a restaurant was advertising their Mojito's for $5.00.) The food was equally proportioned and pricey. There is nothing about the food, staff or drinks that makes this place worthy of the pricing. Overall, it really kind of ruined what was otherwise a nice day in the city. There is no way we would ever return."
Darya M.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",2,10,6,4.0,4/29/2015,"Today I 've had best ever cheesecake in my life! It was first time in cf, so I decided to try their classic cheesecake. Classic never gets old! I don't like too sweet desserts, and that was exactly what I wanted. Another one red velvet cheesecake for my husband was also good, but too sweet and more dry than mine."
Katie F.,"Denver, CO",1007,856,646,3.0,5/13/2013,"While most of you know I not the biggest chain restaurant fan, I find the Cheesecake Factory to be A-ok. Here's why: 1. The service is always friendly and my water is always filled. 2. The prices are decent for what they offer and the food is always good :) [minus my cold salmon on my salad....psshhh] 3. Location is perfect...right across the street from the office! HOWEVER.... 1. Their menu is so extensive that it makes it hard to choose one thing. i found myself overwhelmed with page after page of food, drinks, apps, desserts and the like. oye! Overall, this place is just fine for what it is :)"
Marie C.,"Aurora, CO",1,36,3,2.0,2/28/2015,It can be an hour to an hour and a half wait to get seated. The parking validation only lasts 3 hours. This has been frustrating every time we dine at this location. Over 50% of the 3 hour allowed time is waiting for a table. Pease change your parking policy to cover 4 hours durning prime time weekend dinner hours when you wait time is long. Or maybe offer reservations so we don't have to wait over an hour for a table.  On a more positive note - The service was exceptional and the manager at this locations was very kind in helping us at our table.  We always love the food!
sara a.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,1.0,6/8/2016,Sad to say it's the first time I have been subjected to racial profiling:-( no one should ever be profiled due to the colour of their skin! I am aghast at what awaits us in the future. I live across from Cheesecake and have often stopped by over the last 10 years! A new fairly well dressed gentleman assumed I was Mexican and questioned my credit card. No earlier individual was subjected to this. After scrutinizing my ID he accepted!!!! Trump - you have your people!!! To add insult to injury the manager Holly Weaver was pathetic in her meagre  attempts to apologize!!!  Tragic!!!
Anne F.,"Sioux Falls, SD",11,127,107,4.0,9/15/2015,"Sitting outside. Haven't seen my server yet, but another server waited on me without me prompting her. She is very friendly.  Had the farfalle with garlic cream sauce and ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. The pasta was enough for two and had good flavor."
Ricky M.,"Gilbert, AZ",197,632,23,3.0,10/21/2014,I had never ate at the Cheesecake Factory before but always heard people ranting and raving about it... Well I finally got to try it and I must say the food is good and the cheesecake is better. But...... Seriously do they need to have a 20 page menu? That thing is way overboard especially for people like my self who already have a hard time trying to make a decision this can cause some problems as it took me about 15 minutes to decide what I wanted to eat. Besides that avocado egg rolls were very good and the red velvet cheesecake is to die for. I also tried the mac and cheese burger which was totally unhealthy but well worth every calorie!
Steven S H C.,"Denver, CO",745,646,1874,4.0,8/16/2014,"no matter where you are, they always deliver consistent food and quality.  you can order from downtown location and expect to be presented exactly the same as ones in honolulu.   parking was free on sundays so that was added benefit.  sever was doing his best and food was good too."
Paul V.,"Denver, CO",1,14,,5.0,4/18/2015,"I pig out every time I'm here, my favorite is the environment reminds me of Atlantis. Overall awesome service been twice with a party and have been treated like royalty. They really know how to please a party. I would like to make a small complaint too long of a wait for the ticket, it's like they expect us to order more and more. Cheesecake is too good it's almost unreal. And the flavor variety uhhhhh it's VERY STRESSFUL DECIDING hehe"
