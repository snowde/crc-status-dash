Scott W.,"Aurora, CO",95,146,51,3.0,1/18/2016,"I just wanted to update and say I did get a gift card to make up for the experience, and Shannon Venturo did return my call and promise to review service levels at the restaurant among Eduardo, other waiters and Ben the manager."
Shemae I.,"Denver, CO",14,25,7,3.0,1/1/2016,"The food was delicious and the banana cream cheesecake ease divine. Both not only met, but exceeded my expectations.  The service, however, could use improvement.  We were greeted at the table by a female server who was obviously not pleased with her job or just unhappy that day. Then another server brought our drinks and explained she would be taking care of us.  The first server came back, telling us there's confusion over the sections that day.  Then the second server came back and completed our dining experience.  The attention to our table was appropriate and we were never left needing any items, but there was just a lack of positivity.  Maybe they were just upset they were working on New Year's Day and we order hot water to drink."
Tanya L.,"Hollywood, FL",34,114,213,4.0,8/11/2015,"Yes this is a chain but I still love it.  Great cheesecake and so many flavor options.  I like my cheesecake to taste like cheesecake  so I am not a fan of some of the crazier ones with a ton of stuff in them.  The chocolate coconut one was too chocolatey for me and not cheesecake-y enough.  The key lime, vanilla bean and dulce de leche are my favorites.  On my last trip I tried the seasonal lemon merengue and it was fantastic.  Love the fresh whipped cream that they top each piece of cheesecake with.  On to the food.  The menu is huge and it is so hard to decide on an entree.  I always seem to order a pasta, I love the chicken bellagio and the chicken madeira is great as well.  If you don't feel like looking for and then attempting to parallel park your car they offer free parking in the parking garage under the cheesecake factory.  You will get parking ticket and bring it to the front desk and they will validate it for you.  I believe the validation is good for 3 hours.  Expect a wait, especially on the weekends."
Raven L.,"Aurora, CO",1,17,,3.0,2/22/2016,Fantastic food. High prices but worth it. The cucumber ice tea is amazing! Service is really slow though and the man who seated us kept going on about how horrible the movie we just saw was when we liked it so that threw us of a lot. But overall great.
Nesrin A.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,1.0,2/17/2016,"Service was excellent, but the food was very poor at lunch time. The Skinny menu is attractive, i ordered the Skinny Chpped Salad and most of the ingredients on the menu didn't make it to the plate. My coworker's order was not served today at lunch so we had to wait for another 30min for her order. Its so sad that the quality of the food was really poor because this place used to be fantastic."
Ashwini C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,30,3,3.0,7/7/2015,The cheesecakes are pretty huge. Two people can easily suffice on one. However too expensive.
Michele L.,"Florham Park, NJ",1,32,1,2.0,8/1/2015,"Dirty dirty dirty!  Not what I expect from the Cheesecake Factory!  The napkins & silverware were filthy - looks like they were washed in chocolate cake & the plates were not cleaned! Food was ok, but not as great as other locations! Not returning here.  I told the manager and he just said thank you for thanking him!"
Jamie S.,"Denver, CO",1,12,2,3.0,8/4/2014,"The cheesecake is good, but pricey.   Our server was very good & attentive.  The food was average, but the price was ok.  The cocktails are over priced and not worth the money.  Even a house bourbon Manhattan was $10.50.  There are better places in downtown Denver that won't kill your wallet."
Angie O.,"Fort Carson, CO",0,1,,1.0,8/16/2015,Food tastes decent. Kinda pricey. Came here for the first time with a group totaling 4 people... One girl NEVER GOT HER FOOD! We ended up leaving after 2 hours with free meals for the rest of us (thanks) but she never got to experience the food! Not happy with this place. Manager was even laughing when she came to apologize. So not worth it. Not this location anyway.
Dave C.,"Denver, CO",27,235,588,1.0,6/26/2012,"Yeah so it's time to update this. We came back back for a nice anniversary dinner.  Everything was going well.  We were seated in a nice dark corner in the back away from the noisy dinner crowd and rug rats.  The appetizer of chicken croquettes was good and so was the bread.   I had the pasta and meat sauce which was just meh.  Seriously, Olive Garden's is better.  I ate about half and decided to get a take home box along with a slice of tiramisu cheesecake to take home. He (Randall I think his name was) brought out the boxes and the check and then we waited. And we waited... And we waited... 5 minutes.... 10 minutes... The overly generous gratuity I had left him for mediocre service gets scratched out and we begin deducting a dollar for each passing minute. 20 minutes goes by.  No cheesecake. Finally we'd had enough and it was evident that our waiter (Randall) just completely and unprofessionally neglected us after bringing us the check that included the charge for the cheesecake we'd PAID for and was not delivered.  We got up and marched directly to the bakery and demanded our cheesecake that we were never served. And to think I gave them another chance. Strike two for Cheesecake Factory. There WILL NOT be a strike three."
Poornima B.,"Denver, CO",25,46,10,5.0,9/27/2015,"I don't always go to Cheese cake factory but when I do, I order Jamaican spicy black beans shrimp with fried bananas. I love this. It makes the Indian in me very happy. Super spicy shrimp curry is just awesome! Nice and friendly staff too even though it was too late and too crowded."
Gigi D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1036,660,3188,3.0,6/3/2013,"People always talk about how HUGE the entrees are at The Cheesecake Factory... However, if that's the case, then WHY did I have to order 2 entrees?!?!?!?!?!?! Either I need to enter into a food eating competition ASAP, or The Cheesecake Factory is stingy when it comes to serving up HEALTHY GRUB! I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad (seared tuna with leafy greens and a sliced tomato) along with a side of grilled asparagus and a side of olive oil dressed green beans. The dish was delicious but, it definitely felt like an appetizer portion.  My dining companion ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the Steak Diane. She was served a MASSIVE dish that was mostly filled with EVIL MASHED POTATOES (a low-carbers nightmare, not that she is a low carb eater or anything)... And a sprig of basil. She was HOPING there would be far more greens on her plate, but nope, the soupy potatoes were the vegetable of choice. She proceeded to not finish the potatoes and instead ordered a side salad.  As for me, I wolfed down my tuna in literally a minute and proceeded to complain that I was still HUNGRY. I have a wolf in my stomach eating the food I ingest... I swear. So I discussed with the waitress how I might be able to get some salmon with more green beans. She was nice and tried to figure out the most cost effective way for me to fill my trap and it worked! I got the grilled salmon and green beans, just the way I wanted.  Of course... I was STILL hungry, but I am just a freak so I decided to slap my baby wolf and asked for the check when I was done eating.  I always remember the Cheesecake Factory being absolutely delicious. It was good but it wasn't ""run around pants-less through the restaurant screaming how much I love the place"" good. I don't think I will be going back. There are far tastier places on the 16th Street Mall. Sorry CF... I don't think you'll miss me though, there were millions of people in there shoving their faces with your gluttonous meals!"
Paula I.,"Denver, CO",0,11,7,5.0,1/7/2016,"Everytime we dine here its always so freaking good. Their portions are quite big and food is on point. Also, besides their cheesecake.. Their stuffed mushrooms are the best!"
Aimee K.,"Castle Rock, CO",9,7,,1.0,9/25/2015,Terrible service. The waiter obviously didn't care about her customers and wasn't very knowledgable when we asked her questions on how things tasted. Took us a solid 15 minutes just to get our drinks. I had the fried mac n cheese and it was absolutely terrible. There was barely any Mac n cheese in the actual ball itself and was way too fried. If I am going to pay that much for a meal it better be some of the best damn food of my life! On top of that three hours after I got home I got food poisoning. Never going back.
Andrew M.,"Denver, CO",16,173,,3.0,2/15/2014,"Oh man I'm wading into dangerous waters here. All I can think of is Marilyn Hagerty's Olive Garden review. Look, this place is as corporate as it gets. They are one step away from having cliff divers and a pirate show. That said, if you want a sit down lunch at the Tabor center, and don't want to leave the building (ahem, SNOW), it's not the worst option ever.  The menu, I""m sure you know, is absolutely insane. The few times I've been there, I've gotten the fried chicken salad. It is fine. End of review. (breathes easy)"
Steve B.,"Lodo, Denver, CO",1,8,,1.0,9/20/2015,"I walked in to place a take out order of cheesecake, shake, and ice cream. It took 50 minutes to get my order! I mean everything but the shake is ready to go already. 50 minutes to make a shake??? Had a ask the the heck was going on several time. It's like this nearly every time I go in there. Get it together."
Morgan C.,"Denver, CO",1,9,,4.0,4/16/2014,"Having serving experience myself, I'm picky when it comes to being the customer. I guess it's a good thing that I generally go out to eat for the food, not the service (which wasn't phenomenal). I'm a vegetarian, so my food choice is limited and I'm usually skeptical about veggie burgers. There wasn't a whole lot on the menu that I could eat without sifting through some sort of shrimp or chicken, so I went out on a limb and ordered the veggie burger with a side of sweet potato fries (I mainly came for the dessert, mind you.)  Fortunately, I was not disappointed. Far from it, in fact. This veggie burger was easily the size of my entire face in circumference and half of my face in width, making for an exceptionally messy meal. But exceptionally delish nonetheless. Best burger EVER. I've experienced an actual cow burger back in my day and never favored them, but this will definitely be my 'usual' when I go out for some grub. And I've never had a usual, I like to change things up, so that's also saying something. Oh yeah, and the Oreo cheesecake was pretty great."
Emily W.,"Littleton, CO",375,129,38,5.0,3/31/2014,"The biggest problem I have with this restaurant is really not even a problem, it's my problem being indecisive. The menu is SO large and has nearly every type of cuisine you could be craving. It's a book, so if you don't like to read, you may have issues. They have a great variety of different types of cuisines and the cheesecake menu is off the chain! Super delicious, mouth watering just thinking about it!"
Connie W.,"Liberal, KS",0,2,,1.0,6/18/2016,The service was very slow. Both mine and my friend's meals had food missing. When I did get me food it was inedible. Not recommended.
Gary M.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",5,103,124,4.0,4/8/2014,"This place gets a lot of harsh reviews and I can understand certain peoples points but not others! It's the cheese cake factory not a top notch restaurant. The service is always great, the foods reasonable and The cocktails are nice. It's a casual place to go get drinks and eat. The food is decent and a lot better than other rival chains."
