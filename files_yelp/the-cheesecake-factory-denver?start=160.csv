Stacy P.,"Denver, CO",81,668,1091,3.0,4/21/2012,"When I was a teenager, I thought The Cheesecake Factory was the best place ever... now that I'm just a bit (ahem) older, and realize that a 20 page menu isn't necessarily a plus, I think that it's A-OK.  No, the food here doesn't blow me away. But, they certainly do have something for everyone. They have also taken a good shot at identifying ""healthy"" dishes (note that at TCF, ""healthy"" qualifies as under 600 calories). Also, the service here is actually pretty good.  Finally, the location is great - it's right on 16th street, so you can eat here and then walk pretty much anywhere you want to go downtown. They also do very well with groups - even did separate checks for our lunch group of 20."
Jacqui Q.,"Denver West, CO",0,65,,1.0,5/22/2016,We were one of the first tables in this morning. Took over 10 mins to get greeted. Fb ordered omelet and I ordered Bfast sandwich. 40 mins later I got my sandwich and they brought wrong omelet to bf. It belonged to table behind us. Server was incompetent. We left without my bf even eating due to the fact we declined his food when it came out 15 mins later--55 mins after we ordered. The table behind us did the same thing. Horrible experience. Manager very rude and dismissive
Aundrea L.,"Denver, CO",7,19,2,5.0,11/16/2015,"Best dinner I have had in so long! We just celebrated our Anniversary and decided to have dinner at the Cheese Cake Factory. Do your self the favor and order the herb crusted salmon or the chipotle chicken pasta. So delicious! In addition, the service was top notch! We had a great server and an overall great experience."
Nicole F.,"Denver, CO",144,7,,2.0,4/27/2016,"Never had a problem with Cheesecake Factory before this visit, which took place last weekend. My coworkers and I arrived around 1:15 pm, before a lunch rush. We saw people who were seated after us receiver their food before us. When we finally got our food, 2 out of 3 had issues and all of us agreed that it seemed like our food had been sitting in the hot plate for a while. My coworkers both got burgers and both said the bottom buns were tough and quite warm. I ordered a salad which was honestly not very fresh looking or tasting. The lettuce was wilted. Half way through our visit our waiter transitioned us to a new server (evidently so she could leave). The second server seemed to have forgotten us and we had to flag her down for everything, including our check. What should have been a one hourish lunch took 2 whole hours. We declined to order dessert because we were annoyed and late getting back to the office - even though our original purpose in going there was specifically to get cheesecake! I could have forgiven the slow service if the food had been ok but it was just not acceptable. I wouldn't serve food like that a guest in my home; not sure why they served it to paying customers."
David B.,"Commerce City, CO",9,142,95,3.0,5/31/2015,I had a late lunch today service was good as usual food was also very good I recommend the imperial chicken and shrimp. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was restroom was nasty and they were slow also the booth we were seated in was dirty.. sort of ruined my visit.
Dana D.,"Denver, CO",14,11,1,5.0,9/8/2015,"The avocado egg rolls, and chicken lettuce wraps always hit the spot. I never leave enough room for cake and I always say I will but the food is so good it's hard. Also the four cheese pasta is pretty good too. Very creamy and I had to split it with my boyfriend because it was just too big for me. And the mash potatoes are always good too. One of my favorite places to eat."
Howe Q.,"Denver, CO",20,26,44,4.0,1/17/2014,"Our server was extremely quick and the food was great. The lunch menu was a bit overpriced for the size. I chose a dinner option instead. Also, for dinner, especially during the holidays l recommend coming here because they make reservations differently. On short notice, this is definitely the place to be because they don't take reservations over the phone."
J B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,209,110,2.0,7/5/2015,"Disappointing.   The Cheesecake Factory usually produces consistently good food. Not this time.  Maybe it was a second crew cooking on the 4th of July.  We ordered nachos with chicken to start. It looked like someone had thrown it on the plate then realized we'd ordered chicken and grabbed a handful of the closet chicken in the kitchen, smothered in a horrible dried orange sauce. Yuck! The white chili was okay, but when there is twice the amount of rice than chili, it looks like they're going cheap, while still charging $$.  The spicy chicken sandwich was tasty, but again thrown on the plate, with most of the chicken, smothered in sauce, missing the bun. The most disappointing was the chicken and biscuits. The chicken was black on the bottom (not burnt but black from a not clean grill,) then covered in a bland, lumpy sauce with soggy vegetables. The biscuits were overcooked and dry. We had this boxed up for our dog.  We thought we'd have dessert, but decided against it given our experience. Disappointing!"
Boulder G.,"Boulder, CO",1,22,9,5.0,6/30/2015,I am not a big fan of cheesecake and I pretty much stay away from restaurant chains. But the Cheescake Factory was the only thing open late one night. My family has been coming ever since. Great high quality food. Attentive service. Full bar. Food served after 10pm. What more could you ask for?
Brittany B.,"Denver, CO",39,301,35,4.0,1/19/2012,"Apparantly these folks are tired of getting thrown under the bus for their lack of healthy options, because there is a new ""Skinny Taste"" menu out with quite a few options under a few hundered calories.  And the portions are still quite sizable!  (My friend ordered a chicken meal that she took half home)  Also, if ordering from this menu, the servers are not to bring bread to the table, so that should help with watching caloric and fat intake. I love their food (something for everyone), love the cheesecake (though it's much better to share a piece without whipped cream if you're trying to be relatively good), and service is pretty consistant.   Also, if ordering off the regular menu, realize that you don't have to finish it all in one sitting.  You're likely an adult who should know when to stop eating and can make a $15 meal last for three... just sayin'..."
Paul H.,"Los Lunas, NM",0,9,1,5.0,9/13/2015,"Had a pleasant experience here at The Cheesecake Factory with mom. Our server was friendly, down to earth, and always kept our drinks full without asking. Rarely do I ever give a 5 star, but this place earned it!"
Shari P.,"Anchorage, AK",113,33,148,4.0,5/15/2014,"Clean, excellent customer service, great variety of choices, and great atmosphere! I always line visiting the Cheesecake Factory when I get a chance because the service and food quality is consistent."
Joel K.,"Fruita, CO",87,39,2,5.0,6/16/2015,This was the first time that I had been to the Cheesecake Factory. My son had gone before and highly recommended it. The service was great and the waitstaff was always available for our drink refills. I ordered a salad and the portions were great. The flavor was wonderful as well as I got a mexican flavored dressing with tortilla chips. We would definitely go back there again. My family really enjoyed this restaurant.
Alice Q.,"Denver, CO",2578,1627,6800,5.0,3/6/2015,"Good golly this place was heaven and a pleasure to try out! We stepped inside and the place is huge, and very fancy. This place is great for a romantic date and a large party of friends and family. We started off with an appetizer of bread sticks with a soft, creamy buttery filling which was mouth watering and flattering. The server brought a large circle of bread with sesame seeds on top, which left my mouth a fan of their bread and pastries. The menu has a large variety of items to choose from, that I'm not sure it's possible to try everything on the menu! I eventually ordered a Blue Cheese B.I.T. Burger topped with their crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion rings and lots of blue cheese! The burger was so fancy, that the top bun was not even placed on top of the burger. The Blue Cheese burger was also a tall burger with lots of onion rings stacked on top the delicious beef patty. I was very much in love when I tried my first bite and enjoyed the beauty of the art that this burger very much provided for me.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have an amazing time with a date, friends or with family. The Cheesecake Factory comes with so many items on their menu, that this place is perfect to try new things. I know I definitely will when I come a second time around. Cheers!"
Kim B.,"Denver, CO",0,35,,1.0,12/12/2015,"Yeah. This place pretty much sucks except the cheesecake. The food is terrible. My beer was warm. I got the philly cheese steak and the meat was  so chewy I had to spit it all out. Our waters never got filled. We sat there for an hour until I finally asked. For a beer, meal, and cheese cake slice it was almost $40. The waiters switched mid-shift and never really checked on us. What a waste of money for terrible food and service. The only way I would come here would be to pick up a cheese cake slice to-go, but I would rather give somewhere else my money."
Cubby R.,"Denver, CO",30,107,55,2.0,10/12/2015,"the wait for a table of 4 was way too long, so we only wanted dessert and we took it to go, at almost 8 bucks a slice for dessert, i dont think they should be serving frozen items,  i kid you not, the point was fine, but as i kept eating, it was crystaled and hard frozen. if i wanted frozen over fresh, i would have went to costco for a cheesecake factory box of slices."
Amanda S.,"CBD, Denver, CO",9,6,1,1.0,5/16/2015,"Went here for my bachelorette party. The food was ok. We had two servers and didn't see either of them. One of the bridesmaids got the wrong food. They forgot one of our cheesecakes. Didn't take any of the mess ups off of the check, and nothing was offered to me for my special night. We've been here for 3 hours now, and STILL don't have our check. We had others plans tonight! We even called a manager over and told him about everything that happened. I'm sorry but, ""I'm sorry"" isn't good customer service."
Greg O.,"Rigby, ID",0,5,,3.0,6/28/2014,"Food: I ordered a sandwich for lunch.  The bread was toasted a bit much as it was too hard, and I had a difficult time biting into it.  It also lacked much flavor.  The fries that came with it were average.  However, the cheesecake was absolutely delicious. Service: The service was fine.  I didn't have to wait for refills, and my server was pleasant. Ambiance: I didn't like the long booth seat because it felt like I was dining with the people next to me.  The restaurant seems like a decent place for all ages though. Cleanliness: The dining room and the bathroom were quite clean. Price: I thought the price was quite reasonable.  The cheesecake was on the higher end, but I thought it was worth it. Overall: I would definitely stop in again for dessert.  Perhaps I would give lunch another try, but I would stay away from the sandwiches."
Becky S.,"Seminole, FL",0,155,,5.0,10/15/2013,"We arrived in Denver and my husband was sick with a sinus infection.  We go to 2 places on 16th street for the beer fest and Broncos Game .  This is one of them.  As he was not feeling well, I called in an order from the on line take out menu.  They had id ready in 15 minutes. He got his usual Tuna Tataki Salad and I got my usual, Pasta with Shrimp.  Both packaged well with sauces separate and spill proof.  They also portioned out one huge slice of cheesecake into two smaller containers as I didn't want to catch my husband's cold sharing a dessert with him. I have eaten here over a dozen times in the last 2 years and never been disappointed."
Ryan M.,"Vilonia, AR",2,36,4,4.0,4/8/2015,"Arrived around 7 pm and didn't have to wait, due to friends already being there, so I can't comment on that. Parking is horrific, but that should be expected with the location. The food was amazing, and the service was surprisingly quite even though it was packed! Definitely expensive, but you are in downtown Denver, so it's expected. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the waitress decided to interrupt our conversations multiple times to explain what was on the menu that we all had readily available and had already read. Will be back, but I'll not have the same waitress, hopefully."
