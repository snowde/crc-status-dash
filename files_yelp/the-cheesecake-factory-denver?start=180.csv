Ryan V.,"Arvada, CO",17,33,6,4.0,3/10/2014,"It was not what I expected when I first sat down, tables were a little too close together for a good date night in my opinion, but after that everything was amazing. We were seated almost immediately on a saturday night and we ordered the calamari for an appetizer the portion was huge! Definitely need two people if you plan on eating an entree! The entree portions were also very big! Not too expensive considering you practically get two meals out of it! The chicken marsala with mushrooms were great, very tasty wine sauce. And then came the cheesecake. We had to try it and wow! The kahlua cocoa cheesecake was wonderful! We will be returning once a month for cheesecake. Bravo!"
ElizabethAnn B.,"Denver, CO",103,281,249,3.0,7/29/2013,"Yeah what is the appeal for overpriced food and bad service...  Yeah I get it the menu is a book but I don't know as an answer to many questions is honestly obsurd. And I come to find out they have gluten free entrees they can offer....wow. grabbed dinner because we ordered a cheesecake for pickup.  THAT was delicious!... hence the three stars The meal and service were not.  And the waiter seemed unaccommodating to my gluten questions and honestly not great at his job.  Easy check with apps, salad, drinks, and a desert and he couldn't get it right."
Jastesh S.,"Centennial, CO",4,38,5,3.0,3/14/2015,We like this place because of how late it's open and of course the desserts are just phenomenal. Tiramisu (not tiramisu cheesecake) is a must have here. Their service is definitely lacking a little but it's not benough to keep us away.
Sarah P.,"Temecula, CA",101,293,23,4.0,1/8/2014,"The cheesecake factory is great, and I like this location. We came in with our baby and they were very accommodating. Our server was prompt and kind. And our food was delicious. I also like that they have a ""skinny"" menu with items that have less calories. And this menu is very extensive, especially compared to other restaurants.  The only thing I wish they had is a vegan cheesecake. Then it would be a five star place."
Colin R.,"Denver, CO",0,19,,1.0,5/27/2015,"Incredibly bland food that's reheated from frozen meals made off site (talk to former employees if you want to lose your appetite). Ads in the menu. For the price, you could go to any number of far better places. If you enjoy food, stay away."
Kelly M.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,12,,5.0,5/9/2015,"My friend and I visited the evening of 5/8/2015. I've been here many times and have always had a pleasant experience. The avocado egg rolls are to die for! But I'm not writing a review for the food. I'm writing a review today because of our amazing server. If I remember correctly (and I hope I do), her name was Elizabeth and she was exceptional. She not only attended to our needs but anticipated them as well, she kept our water glasses filled, had perfect timing on knowing when we were ready to order, and made us feel like we were at home. She genuinely wanted to ensure that we had a great dinner. She was definitely one of the best servers I've ever had!"
Renee W.,"Littleton, CO",161,617,12,4.0,4/6/2013,I like this location; it's been years since I have been to a Cheesecake Factory but to be on the 16th St. Mall is nice! The menu has a wide variety of dishes and tastes and their cheesecake (of course) is decadent and delicious. I had the lunch portion of pecan crusted catfish that came with succotash and mashed potatoes. The mash were good - rich and buttery and I only had a few bites of that to avoid a food coma. The fish was also good but I missed that pecan nutty flavor coming through in my bites. Looks like a good place to people watch if you sit outside.
Shae K.,"Denver, CO",1,21,,4.0,2/4/2013,"This place has a massive menu, it feels less like a menu in your hand and more like a novel.  I've had a few different things, over the different Cheesecake Factories I've been too and they've all been pretty tasty. That being said, I feel like some of the items are a bit overpriced and given when you go you could potentially be waiting in an obnoxiously long line.  That's hardly their fault if they're getting a lot of customers, it's just something to take note of. I'd also like say while I am not much of a dessert person, the cheesecake here lives up to it's namesake and is quite delicious.  It's probably one of my favorite desserts I've had, and it the primary reason I'll stop in to eat."
Tracy B.,"Verona, Italy",6,3,1,5.0,9/17/2014,"Not only is the cheesecake to die for but the food is so tasty, the restaurant is beautiful and in downtown Denver, what a great mixture!! I loved taking my Italian husband there so he could see that the food in America is also delicious :)"
Kayla C.,"Quincy, IL",1,25,5,1.0,6/29/2014,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! The kitchen appeared to be backed up as my husband and I waited 20 minutes for table bread and then waited ridiculously long for our food to arrive. This place was not busy and we arrived after lunch hours. The waiter seemed nice but he rarely came to my table for refills, etc. As we paid for our bill (that also took too long to accomplish), the waiter charged us the total amount from another's table order. We had to stay even longer in order to correct their bill mistake. Over two hours wasted for a simple, middle of the day lunch. Would not recommend this restaurant!"
Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",514,2583,7,4.0,5/18/2013,"Surprisingly, this strip of 16th in Denver offered far more franchised, restaurant powerhouses than I expected, at least with all of the gypsy activity going on all on the streets and sidewalks. But, the Cheesecake Factory appetizers can never do you wrong, especially for happy hour. Our waitress cared for us in a very genuine way, refilling our water and expediting our dinner for the sake of us catching the Rockies game. All this took place despite us sticking to the cheap $5 appetizers in the bar for happy hour. Guacamole: $5 Crab and artichoke dip: $5 Spinach dip: $5 Food coma and 3 piles of chips for less than the cost of a drink at some penthouse nightclub? Priceless. And don't forget to get a slice of cheesecake on the way out... that is the main reason I suppose the high school program groups and fallback date nights would like to come this way--not judging, just pointing out some of the true demographics! I just like cheap munchies."
Jessica D.,"Denver, CO",34,37,32,5.0,3/10/2013,"I love that the restaurant is open late night. I have always been a fan of this savory shrimp and noodles dish in a creamy lemon sauce. This last visit though I decided to venture out and try something new. Usually when I find a dish that I absolute crave, I always get it on return.  I chose to go with the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Burger with a side of fries. I read the description and never looked at anything else. I was not disappointed. they always have the tastiest french fries, cut to perfection and crispy all around. This burger was so flavorful. I like a well done burger, and this was cooked as ordered but still juicy. The fried macaroni was so tasty, and I was worried it would be too battered, but just the opposite. The macaroni was creamy and complimented the burger perfectly. To add another dash of sin to the dish, they give an additional splash of a cheese sauce over the fried macaroni.  The hamburger was huge, so half was plenty for me, and the leftovers were just as delicious. In the end, everyone was too full to even consider a piece of cheesecake. Next time perhaps."
Joe C.,"Fullerton, CA",3,29,7,2.0,5/11/2015,"Now I truly feel bad giving Cheesecake Factory a 2 out of 5, but I call a Spade a Spade. The service is usually on point but I'm going off the Brea, California location. Our server didn't tell us she was going on break and some guy just introduced himself to us. Now I get if that's the way they do things, I don't mind. However my dish came out wrong twice and my lady was already finish with her meal by the time mine came out.  Still wasn't mad but the management team dropped the ball by 1. Not comping at least my dish. 2. Saying that they'll buy us desert. I was so pissed I just tipped them and left. The experience happen a few months ago so I don't know if it's the same management team. I get it, stuff happens but theres a certain and proper way to take care of your guest"
Ran T.,"Denver, CO",101,461,190,2.0,1/6/2013,"We came here last night after ice skating. We had to wait for 20 minutes for a table for six. Well, we had to sit in bar stools at the end and push two tiny tall tables together. The thing is that they had plenty of empty tables in the back but nobody was sitting there. I didn't feel like eating a large meal so I ordered some hot chocolate. It was $4. Everything here comes in large portions and higher prices (guess that's very American like). My friend ordered a regular slice of cheesecake but it was so sweet that he barely took a couple bites off it before he asked for a box to take home. Judging by the look on his face I would think he was eating his 8th or 9th slice in a cheesecake contest. LOL.The services was fast and friendly. That's about the only highlight."
Ken K.,"Denver, CO",4,19,1,4.0,11/24/2014,Menu way to big.  Steak was good a little overcooked. Cheesecake was excellent. Even with a party of 9 we only waited 15 min. for our table. Only downside is it's to dark and reading the menu was hard to do
Frxa M.,"Commerce City, CO",3,12,2,5.0,3/3/2015,"Amazing atmosphere,  friendly and attentive staff, the crab and artichoke dip is fantastic! My wife had the shrimp with angel hair pasta, and i had the steak dianne with herb encrusted salmon. Everything came out in a timely manner, and my meal was not only delicious, but my steak was cooked to a PERFECT medium rare temperature!!  If your looking for amazing food and a fun atmosphere, with medium+ prices, i HIGHLY suggest you bring everyone to the Cheesecake Factory! We will definitely be back!"
Lulu S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",34,8,1,3.0,7/18/2014,"$80 for our dinner meal plus tip! The food was okay but the cheesecake was yummy. Service was to be expected - not too bad, not super great either.  What prompted us to try this place was the location; it is in the strip area so it was convenient plus the fact that there were a lot people going in. There are other restaurants out there to try though."
Steve W.,"Englewood, CO",4,91,15,3.0,12/19/2012,"I ate at the Cheesecake Factory with a large party on a Sunday around 5:00.  We had to wait about 20-30 minutes to be seated because the large party that had the table before us was camping for about 20 minutes after they paid the check. Overall, the service was good.  Drinks were kept filled, and our large party (about 10) was accommodated quite well.  With appetizer, entree, dessert, and the pre-added 18% tip, the total for my wife and me was around $90.  It wasn't too bad, but it also wasn't what I'd call a $90 meal.  The spinach dip was a bit bland, as was the house-made guacamole (no lime).  I had the Salisbury steak.  I ordered it because it came with a vegetable and with potatoes unlike the regular steak which comes without a vegetable for abut five dollars more.  The wife had the spaghetti which I have to admit was the best restaurant spaghetti I've ever had. Cheesecake was good, but again - was it $7.50 good?  I just can't say it was.  For my dime, I would have taken a smaller portion at a slightly lower price. Overall, it was a good experience, but the wait, the price, and the fact that for that price the food didn't knock my socks off made it less enjoyable. Recommendation: for a tasty meal at a similar price, I recommend heading south to the Park Meadows area and trying J Alexander's.  But, if you absolutely must have a huge menu with over a dozen different kinds of cheesecake, I suppose  you should go to The Cheesecake Factory."
Buddy L.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,4.0,2/14/2015,"Seating was very unorganized, and crowded. After we finally got seated service was good. Food was awesome, and desert was even better!"
Shana H.,"Denver, CO",24,516,253,3.0,1/29/2011,"Cheesecake Factory has always been bourgeois to me so I have  never gone there of my own volition. Well, I mean, I've never said, ""Hey, let's go to Cheesecake Factory"".  However, I have eaten food from the restaurant or dined there at least three times in 15 years. The food is good. There is no doubt about that. The staff is knowledgeable but I wouldn't call them 'friendly'.  I have had one of their chicken and pasta entrees and their simply grilled salmon which were both delicious. I'm a big fan of cheesecake and key lime pie so that is my cheesecake of choice when I visit.  Will I go back? Sure, as long as I'm not paying."
