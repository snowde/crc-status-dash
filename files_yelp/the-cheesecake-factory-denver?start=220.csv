Doug T.,"Loveland, CO",0,4,,2.0,9/22/2015,"Took my wife, two daughters and a son-in-law before the CO symphony last Friday night.  My wife's salad had quite a bit of old, smelly smelling greens (she is trying to get over ordering salads out...), the bacon on the son in law's was burned and half the crust of the daughter's pizza was burned.  The salmon dish was fine as was my meat loaf.  But too many things wrong for $150 including tip. I wish people had spoken up but since we had to keep moving due to the concert, no one said anything!!  Pretty disappointed...  Dessert was good - shared one slice...  DT"
Lisa J.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/18/2014,Very good place for cheesecake and large food items. I like everything from the food to desserts. I'll be back!
Alexis D.,"Madison, WI",30,94,9,4.0,8/17/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints me... I LOVE their cheesecake and I LOVE their drinks. Their strawberry daiquris have made it on my Top 3 Strawberry Daiquiris list. I'm very disappointed with their selection of vegetarian options. They have something like a 15-page menu, and only a few vegetarian options, most of them pasta. I've gotten sick of getting the same old thing every single time, so I'm not as excited about their actual food.  I love the ambience and the atmosphere. The waiters are always very friendly. If you go on the weekend, you will have to wait a while, so just prepare for that. I don't think they take reservations, which seems silly.  Best place to go for just a slice of cheesecake after a show, play or dancing."
Vicki C.,"Denver, CO",14,19,1,4.0,6/25/2014,"Went here for lunch today and sat outside. The wind started to pick up and the umbrellas had to come down, it started to sprinkle and sitting outside no longer was an option. Our waitress was great and ran over, grabbed our food and led us inside for cover. Had the light chicken tacos for the first time and YUM! They lost a star because it was high noon lunch time and they had one person seating people and we had to wait 10 minutes due to this."
Cody C.,"Denver, CO",202,175,35,4.0,5/25/2012,"Classic cheesecake factory! The food is ok and the last time we were there, our server was AMAZING! He was so informative and you could tell he had a passion for the food he was serving."
Mai N.,"Aurora, CO",0,15,5,2.0,8/30/2014,"Slow slow slow service. No attention to drink refills, have seen out waitperson once. At least the food was good."
Jennifer S.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,11,3,1.0,8/14/2014,Terrible service! Sat for 20 minutes without any server even acknowledging us. It started to rain and while 3 servers stood at a podium drinking sodas and talking my husband had to drag the umbrella over to our table to shade us while the servers watched!!!! Food was bland!! The only thing we actually enjoyed was the avocado egg rolls!!
Tracy B.,"Denver, CO",20,6,,5.0,7/27/2014,"This is one of the few places I can eat with my allergies to preservatives.  Complain all you want about it being a chain or too corporate, I appriciate restaurants that use real food.  The vegetables in the salads are all freshly cut, not from a bag which are treated with preservatives.  They are accomodating with replacements and always happy and helpful.  Going there tonight for my birthday dinner :)"
Cleo S.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,19,,4.0,6/6/2014,"This is such a great Cheesecake factory restaurant! I'm something of a Cheescake factory addict, and have visited many locations in several different states and this is one of my favorites. The wait times are usually reasonable and the wait staff are attentive & friendly. The food is classic Cheescake factory fabulousness which will always keep me going back."
Claire C.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,5.0,7/23/2014,"I went to Cheesecake Factory with my friend this weekend as part of our girl's getaway weekend. We ordered a slice of Carrot Cake to go, and asked if getting extra frosting on the side was possible. We were told it was, but when we got back to the hotel we realized it was COVERED in whipped cream and not frosting.  My friend called the store and spoke with the restaurant manager. Since it was already pretty late the manager said he would bring us replacement slices (we only bought 1 slice so he replaced the one that was ruined and also brought us another slice!) and delivered it to our hotel! We were incredibly impressed that he went out of his way to make things right, and for that you get 5 stars!"
Jennifer B.,"Denver, CO",1026,1320,1786,4.0,7/29/2011,"A friend and I enjoyed a nice lunch on the fabulous patio at the Cheesecake Factory.  What better way to enjoy a Friday then a nice lunch on this beautiful day.   Typical Cheesecake Factory, huge menu, good service, great food.  My friend had the lunch size portion of fish and chips and I had the BBQ Grilled Chicken Salad (lunch size).  Everything was great.   No cheesecake today as we needed to get back to work and not fall asleep.   Come on Y'all you know what you get when you come here....we all do!  LMAO"
Trish R.,"Seattle, WA",118,173,3,3.0,6/5/2011,"Pondering between the Cheesecake Factory and an over-priced place we knew nothing about for lunch, we opted for familiarity. As we entered the door, my friend whispered, ""Giant serving sizes, giant serving sizes."" She wasn't kidding. I have a few questions for the Cheesecake Factory higher-ups. Question #1: if you have a menu the size of a bible, why aren't there any gluten-free options? When I asked the server if he could recommend any GF menu items he replied the Factory doesn't have a gluten-free menu (didn't expect one) but they could make most of the items GF. After inquiring about the tamales, I was told the tamales didn't have gluten but the sauces did, so the tamales would need to be served dry. I get it. The way to make stuff gluten-free is to omit some of the primary ingredients that define the dish. Looks like another salad for me. Question #2: if you offer a salad titled, ""Pear and Endive,"" why are there not more than five or six teeny-tiny pieces of pear in the pound of food in the bowl? Question #3: if you offer portion sizes that could feed a family, and you park your place near a convention center where out-of-towners have no place to refrigerate leftovers, why wouldn't you reduce food waste by offering smaller  servings at smaller prices? In the end, the food tasted fine, and the service was friendly, but I hope the amount of food remaining on our plates made someone besides me feel guilty."
Leighanne A.,"Laramie, WY",1,6,,4.0,7/17/2014,"I will start by saying I was very appreciative when they were able to accommodate our large party an hour earlier than our reservation time. I also greatly enjoyed the fried catfish, and the wine was reasonably priced. Service was a tad slow, but this seemed to be an issue at the bar and not our server's fault. The women's bathroom was appalling, though. Overall, I would go back, but I hope it's a little cleaner."
Trent G.,"Westminster, CO",32,14,5,5.0,5/22/2014,"Great food. Prompt service. Go here if you are on 16th St and want a nice meal with some delicious desert. I will say, it is hard to eat an entire slice of cheesecake, so either plan on sharing or taking some home."
Nancy F.,"San Diego, CA",128,599,308,4.0,1/19/2012,"Cheesecake is the best here.  I love the brownie sundae cheesecake.. Yummy!  Share it, as it is like 1500 calories or so.  They have a happy hour in the bar only, from 4-6 p.m. m-f.  Drinks are less, and the appetizer menu is really reasonable and portions are the regular size.  My only issue with the Cheesecake factory is their menu is way to big, and a little overpriced, and the food has never been outstanding, outside of the cheesecake.  I love the downtown location though.  It is big and always busy and fun.  The bar is kind of tucked in the back, so you have to go look for it a bit."
Megan S.,"Arvada, CO",75,14,2,2.0,10/11/2013,I got the Caesar salad for an appetizer and it was very bland.. Or maybe not enough dressing on there. The Cajun shrimp jambalaya was very good. Too bad there were 4 pieces of shrimp and the rest were chicken. All the other entrees that my friends ordered were not very good.  The plates were huge!! You can definitely share with someone and be full. But cheesecake needs to work on quality instead of the quantity.  2 stars for the good service.
Kristin H.,"Golden, CO",14,15,,5.0,5/8/2014,We went there after work on May 5th for my birthday!!! The staff was very nice.. and the Lisa fudge cake was freaking amazing! The drinks were very good! Never been there before but for the first time I really enjoyed it!! And I will be going back.. and I really hope for the rest of my life to eat the Lisa fudge cake on my birthday!!!  YUMMY!!!
Kaitlin B.,"Casper, WY",0,2,,4.0,6/7/2014,"Well serviced. And great food. I got the chicken and biscuits. Delicious. Came with potatoes, biscuits, gravy, veggies, and chicken. There was a few too many onions in the veggies for my taste but still good. I wish there had been more gravy, wasn't enough for all all chicken, biscuits, and potatoes. Also the strawberry lemonade was perfect.  However, it was pricey. Almost $5 for the drink alone.  A restaurant I would go to on special occasions not all the time."
Cassandra F.,"Aurora, CO",86,782,62,3.0,2/25/2009,"I went to the Chessecake Factory for lunch a while back. I have to say the California Club sandwich and avocado eggrolls I had were really excellent. So for food this place is fantastic.  If you're on a diet (I do weight watchers) though, it's kind of rough. They have some salads that are kind of healthy, but they don't post any of their nutrition facts (I had to find them from Washington where they legally have to). Not the healthiest food ever, just delicious.  The service was good, and they're great about bagging your leftovers up for you.  Good location down on 16th street too."
Ai Ling C.,"Brighton, CO",87,199,48,3.0,2/15/2012,"Hubby and I stopped in for a bite to eat after getting out of a symphony performance.  It was my birthday, and we mentioned it to the server, but I didn't want people singing to me in the restaurant.  The server said he'd bring me cake and skip the singing, which sounded good to me. The food was great, large portions as usual, and because we were taking the light rail home, we decided not to have dessert.  The server forgot to bring me my birthday cake, which was a pity, since I'd have made room for that.   Overall, there are better places to eat (Larimer St being one block away) but it sufficed."
