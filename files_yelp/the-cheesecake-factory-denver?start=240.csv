Kmberly B.,"Denver, CO",116,136,14,1.0,1/14/2011,"Not sure where to begin with this bad situation. I know Cheesecake Factory is a standard chain, but it would have been nice if they were up to standards.  We had a brief 10 or so minute wait, which was only weird because the place was empty. As we followed the host to the table I quietly let her know it was our friend's birthday and if they could come embarass her it would be great.  We were seated, and our server was mediocre at best seemingly slow when again they were relatively empty. Our glasses were less than half full or empty most of the night and she messed up our order. It took me almost 15 min to get her attention to ask her if she could fix the order. She apologized and said she would put in a new correct order. Another 20 min went by and my correct order finally showed up, after everyone else had already finished their food. Not only that, but my food was completely bland and it irritated me further knowing I waited for bad food.  More time went by and finally our server returned. Rather than showing up with a slice of cheesecake a birthday song (which we had seen 4 other groups of people partake in that nihgt) she just came by and said ""I heard there's a birthday, you guys should order some desert."" Well, not only did this ruin the fact that we were trying to surprise our friend, but by that point we were ready to leave.  Needless to say, we will not be returning."
Nyl P.,"San Diego, CA",67,29,,3.0,5/20/2014,"With the many other choices in the same area, I think Cheesecake Factory is surviving on their name alone, not necessarily because they have amazing food. Service was solid, food was ok..but nothing special here. Our flatbread was burned on one side so that was disappointing."
Andre W.,"Englewood, CO",0,19,1,3.0,3/8/2014,The Cheesecake factory is always a pretty safe bet. This is a good location and the food was great. I had the beet goat cheese salad and orange chicken. The service however has suffered. Many employees playing games with each other instead of taking care of customers. We never did see a Manager during our entire visit. No supervision that we could see.
J T.,"Denver, CO",251,283,445,4.0,8/22/2013,"So, of course I love this place! Love the chain, love the downtown Denver location.... Love that they are open late. Love everything about the Cheesecake Factory, but the cheesecake! Funny, right? It's not that I don't love their cheesecake,  i do (Drool) it's just that after eating one of their gigantic meal portions, shoving a piece of cheesecake into your gullet seems a strange and unusual punishment.  I digress, I love the Cheesecake Factory, though, truth be told , I've only ever tried one thing on their menu- I've been here a million times. Their menu is like 60 pages long- they've got a huge selection of delicious eats and I've only tried one thing! I just can't seem to stray from their garlic noodles... With scampi tails, it's a great dish- consistently good, prepared with sundried tomatoes, shiitake mushroom and asparagus on a bed of spaghetti, It's what I always crave when I'm here. Actually as an update: I've strayed from my regular dish and sampled their happy hour specials- it's an awesome place to go for happy hour- they have awesome cheap eats ! I love their cheesecake but budget space in your belly, or, I guess you can always take a slice home ;)"
Jeffrey E.,"Knoxville, TN",40,177,18,3.0,9/27/2011,"What I had?  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce) Food review:  So, this dish caught me off guard at first as I was expecting  the chipotle bit to make this more of a southwestern type of spicy.  It actually was a sweet and spicy dish.  After digging into it a bit more, however, I rather enjoyed it.  No complaints about any of the ingredients involved.  Everything was pretty solid Service?  A bit on the slow side due to being understaffed.  I imagine they were probably thinking it wasn't going to be that busy on a Tuesday night at the downtown Cheesecake Factory.  I certainly thought that.  :-s  Probably would have gave the experience 4 stars if they had more staff NOTE:  Would like to note that I went here for dinner this go around.  I think that makes a difference.  My Cheesecake Factory experiences at lunch time have been decent to just not good."
Nicole W.,"Denver, CO",254,1723,580,5.0,12/19/2008,"I LOVE this place. I know it's a chain. I know it's always busy. I know it's always loud. But gosh darn it, I LOVE IT! I don't get here very often - there are just too many other wonders of the taste buds to experience... But I do tend to lean in the direction when my birthday comes around and i want to go someplace ""special"" with a group. I never branch out - even with the 1800 page menu - I always get the Thai chicken pasta and I love it. I always have left overs - this time enough for 3 days of lunches! Ooofa! I love the JW Pink Lemondade - seriously how can you go wrong with sugar on the rim?  :) I also adore the avocado egg rolls. And the sauce for dipping... Mmmmm!  The one thing i do bounce around on is the cheesecake. So much yummy, so little time! This time i did the Kahlua something or other... mmmmm! The one bummer was no reservations. I showed up 1/2 an hour early to ensure my group of 6 would be able to be seated at 7pm! I guess they are used to having tons of people, so why hold a table. I like the bar. The waitstaff has always been great. The service wonderful. And 16th street mall venue - lives up to all my expectations!"
Daisy P.,"Avon, CO",0,4,,5.0,9/25/2012,"I LOVE CHEESE CAKE FACTORY RESTAURANTS. I've been to 5 differen locations all over the states. I write a review for this one because I've been there over 10 times. Great food, I love their menu,so many choices of every kind of food and i love the opening hours. You can go any time and have great food and service. Huge selection of desserts, coctails, salads ( Cobb salad- the best )..... This place have everything that you can think of and you don't have to wail till 5pm to open.  it's not expensive and their meals are so big so you can share and try more of their delicious food."
KD S.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,174,32,3.0,10/9/2011,"You can never go wrong with a cheesecake factory restaurant if you are out of town.  I always order from the small plate menu, since I don't eat a lot.  Yes, I am weird-i don't eat crab-legs but I eat crab-cakes which is one of my favorites here as well as the fried zucchini sticks. Eating half of each and drinking the passion tea which tastes like the tea I get from Hawaii, is the bomb. I only get cheesecake when I am at home, because eating it while on the road isn't so great for my stomach. Since note this place was cold as hell, I was freezing."
Katto R.,"Princeton, NJ",0,32,2,2.0,2/8/2014,They put wheat bread croutons in a salad that's ordered from the gluten free menu.  One person in our party had ordered rib eye steak and it came out cold.  However the manager tried to make up for it by heating the steak up and fixing the salad
Brooke F.,"Denver, CO",20,48,,3.0,11/10/2011,"The cheesecake here is good, the food all right, and the service leaves something to be desired. I have been to this location on a few different occasions, and each time it's about the same kind of experience. The food isn't all that great, and the servers usually take a while to bring food and drinks to the table. In the front of the restaurant by the bar, I feel like they crammed as many tables along the wall as possible because you practically have to stick your butt in another diner's face to get into the seats. While, for a chain restaurant, this is a pretty decent place, it could still use some work.  However, the cheesecake is pretty much delicious. Maybe next time I'll just buy a whole cheesecake and skip the restaurant part of the experience..."
JJ S.,"Littleton, CO",0,11,1,3.0,3/15/2014,"Pretty good food. Huge portions, but kind of lacks the charm of many of Denver's smaller restaurants."
Heidi W.,"Chicago, IL",2,21,,1.0,9/5/2010,"Do you enjoy savoring your food, truly enjoying it? Would prefer a small world-class meal over a mediocre trough full of food?  Well then, you have found the wrong place.  Against my better judgment (I was out numbered by far inferior palettes), I had dinner from there. I knew what I was getting myself into...read: teeny-booper fri/sat nite out: highschool date night: trashy weekend warriors - so perhaps my review shouldn't be SO harsh? Too bad, I'm feeling saucy, they're catching a ration of $hit.  Facts: ungodly sized menu, literally a short novel, main characters and all - thus, that lends itself endless food options. Don't bother going on Fri/Sat nite, apparently CF has been doing some serious push marketing in Tiger beat, litered with whiny-barely-there-dressed pre-teens and their boy toys [thank mom & dad for lending us the money!].  I digress, food is at best a C-, I will give them a B+ for consistency. There's something to be said about managing expectations, and, well, they manage low expectations quite nicely.  Ok - There must be at least 5,000 restaurants in Denver, why here? On second thought, should you find yourself in the Hey-I-actually-really-like-Cheesecake-factory mindset, then do us all a favor and keep going there; I don't want to see your Coach-carrying, Aeropostale-wearing, make-up face complaining about your Pinot Grigio at one of my favorite establishments.  So, requesting a fly-by? Negative ghostrider, the pattern is full."
Steve O.,"Denver, CO",42,22,2,4.0,3/31/2011,"Regardless of the fact Cheescake Factory is a chain, I still love this place.  I've made impromptu lunch, dinner and late night desert runs that have all led to a satisfying experience.  I like the 16th Street location as well, great people watching if you sit on the patio. I'm a fan of large portions, I have a major sweet tooth, and I love fresh warm bread... it's a ménage à trois of deliciousness and Cheesecake Factory is the eHarmony of cuisine.  It's hard to not find at least one thing you enjoy from their novel-like menu.  I feel like I've just read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy after ordering my entree.  In all honesty, the food is moderately priced considering the portions, and I'm a rather frugal individual.  The drinks, however, not so much. Next comes my favorite portion of the meal... dessert.  I've even ordered it first then had dinner - give it a shot to mix things up if you're so inclined.  I'm a huge cheesecake fan and have probably tasted at least half of their cheesecake menu (30+ selections in total) with my favorite being the Caramel Pecan Turtle.  Depending on your tastes they're all quite phenomenal; as they should be if it's in the name of the restaurant. I'll admit one major flaw is the typical long wait you'll experience on weekends or holidays.  So if you're looking to get in and out without enjoying your food, then by all means stay clear from the Cheesecake Factory.  Otherwise, kick back and enjoy the wide selection of food, good company, and relaxing atmosphere."
Christine P.,"Mesa, AZ",344,448,25,4.0,5/30/2011,"This was a great cheesecake factory. The eggplant sandwich was huge and great, lots of cheese :) The tiramisu was perfect, espresso was not burnt, just right, The four cheese pasta was great. A person with us said the salmon and the navajo sandwich were awesome. Overall it was a great meal with friends and a great atmosphere. No complaints!"
Victoria S.,"Denver, CO",36,31,,1.0,11/8/2010,How can any restaurant that has this large of a menu with this many items be able to make even one single dish WELL??  Nasty food every time I've been here.  I imagine a huge freezer of frozen things and tons of cooks flash-frying or microwaving every dish. No thanks!
G M.,"Denver, CO",0,48,,2.0,1/18/2015,Had guests in town for the weekend and they wanted to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. We stopped in for lunch on a saturday. It was crowded as always but we only had a half hour wait. Our sever was pleasant but had trouble remembering our order and for some reason would not write anything down. After a couple of errors we got our food. Everything looked great but everything was also cold but we ere so busy talking that we didn't mention to each other that the food was cold. Probably be o point in complaining though. Lunch for four came to $163.00 without the cheesecake. Hope I don't have to go back.
Bridgette A.,"San Clemente, CA",81,270,,3.0,3/11/2011,"If I could give this place 3.5 stars, I would... but I just can't give it 4 based on the quality of the food. If there is one thing I took away from my meal here it's that people in Denver are REALLY nice! We came here in our break between hotel check out and our flight home from DIA. Luckily they seated us somewhere where we had space for our luggage--big plus! We ordered an appetizer (boneless wings) and my husband got a salad, while I got their soup and salad lunch. Unfortunately, our salads (and my soup) came out... before our appetizer. A few seconds later, our appetizer came. I was annoyed, but I wasn't going to push the issue... it is what it is, whatever. But the guy who delivered the appetizers apologized to us. Then our waitress came, and she apologized as well. And THEN the manager came over, and he apologized. They felt really bad! Unfortunately, my food was not very good. The salad was very bitter, and the broccoli cheddar soup tasted like thick broccoli water. Bummer. My hubby's salad was better--a staple of ours when we visit other cheesecake factories. Overall, it was mehh.  But then the bill came. And wouldn't you know it... they comped the appetizer! Unnecessary, but amazing! And, in sum, people in Denver are SO NICE!!"
Kate G.,"Silverthorne, CO",802,981,172,3.0,7/19/2010,"Most things about the Cheesecake Factory are a little more meh than a-ok but for my dinner last night I will go with three stars as follows... + 1 star for a huge patio with misters that was somehow comfortably cool on a sweltering near-100-degree Sunday afternoon. Much better than the frigid ice chest inside. The people watching is pretty hilarious...both the patio patrons and 16th Street. + 1 star for the extensive menu options featuring ahi. For some reason I was in the mood for ahi and not having eaten at the Cheesecake Factory more than twice in my life, I wasn't sure if their huge phone book of a menu could deliver. But it did! Ahi tartare, ahi carpaccio, ahi tempura rolls, wasabi crusted ahi and an ahi salad almost all made it onto my plate. I went with the salad and it was fresh and light with avocado, tomato, mixed greens, ginger and a soy drizzle. Nothing earth shattering but fed my craving. + 1 star for our friends who suggested dining here on their dime...thank you for saving up years of gift cards! Because otherwise I wouldn't have been tempted to come here. The portions were even more disgustingly huge than I remembered. My husband's cobb salad could have easily fed all four of us. The ads in the menu book are as off-putting as the 1500-2000+ calorie count on most dishes."
Natalia K.,"Denver, CO",4,17,18,1.0,12/23/2013,"I wish I could put 0 stars here. Well, 1 star for a good waiter, I guess. We came with a family for pre Christmas dinner for 4. 2 dishes with pasta and shrimp were not good $18 each, i ordered steak coutlion with asparagus $20 was like a rubber impossible to chew ( and I have all my natural teeth). The steak was on the plate with its sauce and inside that sauce there was a dirty cast iron pan with asparagus which they pulled  out of the oven. Ther was no salt or spices on any of them.  My husband ordered chicken with busquits and gravy. Chicken was ok but the rest was not good, not enough gravy. We ordered 2 appitizers. One was calamari and another one was mini crabcakes. Crabcakes fell apart when we tried to pull them put of the serving plate. Calamari were separate from breading - most part of it.  3 margaritas were full if sugar not tequila. $10 each! Our bill was $140, we had to leave $30 for tip. $170 for a dinner which didn't even worth it. Never, never go there!"
S. D.,"Broomfield, CO",0,5,,1.0,2/8/2015,"We came on a quiet Sunday afternoon around 2:45, our server was prompt and helpful.  After she took our order, it took 30 minutes for my husbands food to appear, 10 minutes after that the rest of our table's food started to trickle in slowly.  After 15 minutes the manager came out and said my food was undercooked and would be out in 5 more minutes.  At no point during this time did anyone offer to do anything helpful, by the time my food actually arrived my family was done eating.  Their menu is too big and full of ads, the food is mediocre at best, and the management is unconcerned with keeping business.  Unfortunately, our server was great, but is subject to the poor kitchen service and their inability to send out an entire tables food at one time.  Save yourselves, buy their cheesecake from the grocery and eat at any of the 100s of delicious restaurants in Denver."
