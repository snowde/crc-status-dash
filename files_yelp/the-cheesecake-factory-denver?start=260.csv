Bo B.,"Arvada, CO",0,75,6,3.0,9/3/2013,Food was tasty though they got my order wrong and when I told the waitress she didnt seem to care much. S'mores cheesecake was delicious and so was the raspberry lemonade. And our silver ware was really really dirty.
Nephi W.,"Brighton, CO",9,8,2,1.0,6/28/2010,"Everything is made of marble, so it was very loud.  I could literally hear forks being placed on tables across the restaurant.  Nearly every table had kids at it... I brought my girlfriend to celebrate having dated for 3 years and we were sat next to the worse possible table.  Two women discussing how awful men are and how they are unable to get one, while their two kids screamed and ran around, literally falling into me. The meal was mediocre at best.  This was the second time I have been, and the second time the food has been more of a disappointment.  I don't think I will return."
Amanda M.,"Denver, CO",190,257,334,4.0,6/6/2010,"I have never had a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory in the 10+ years I have been going. Their prices do seems to creep up a little bit every year, but I guess you get what you pay for. This is the type of restaurant that I fall back on when I can't think of anywhere else to go, or if I need to accommodate a wide variety of food preferences-- steak, fish, pasta, salads, Mexican, Asian, burgers, sandwiches, meatloaf.... The patio is so fun for people watching. I once was seated outside right after an undercover police officer (dining at Cheesecake) tackled a suspect walking by him on 16th street mall. Or maybe the suspect was eating at Cheesecake... either way, talk about dinner and a show! The servers at this particular location are ALWAYS really friendly and attentive, and they don't judge you if you order cheesecake to eat there... and another piece to take home. Chocolate Tuxedo is my favorite cheesecake... but their carrot cake is something that I crave ALL THE TIME. One time I thought about buying a whole carrot cake, but I used better judgment and decided not to (but I would definitely win in a Cheesecake Factory carrot cake eating contest).  Definitely go here if you can't decide what you're in the mood for, you'll find something here. If you don't, you're weird. And I judge you."
Michael W.,"Springfield, MO",0,14,1,4.0,1/3/2014,Pricey but very tasty. I had the Moroccan Chicken which was not spicy at all but very good. I also had Wild Blueberry cheesecake and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. Both are great non wild flavors. Free bread to munch on before the food comes too. I have had dinner there twice the last few days. First time was great service; the second time was poor service. Just depends on the server I guess. Fun atmosphere and dining.
Cherry L.,"Boston, MA",149,196,240,5.0,8/16/2010,FANFANFAN! i was never much of a Cheesecake Factory fan.....but takeout for a large group who were working obscene hours--they were EXCELELELENT!!!! sooooo on point with allllll the orders/sides/drinks/bread/desserts. I would recommend it!
Emily B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,17,,4.0,12/2/2013,"Our most recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory was no disappointment. Although it was very, very busy, we got a table for two right away. The service was very prompt and the wait for our food was quite short. They customized my husbands plate with no upcharge. He had sesame shrimp with cashews that was out of this world. Their skinnylicious plates are fantastic. I had the beets and goat cheese salad along with the bleu cheese and pear flatbread. Yummy!  We took a piece if chocolate cake to go that lasted us two days. It was just as delicious as it was large. And it was large!"
Debbie G.,"Monte Vista, CO",119,26,70,3.0,2/21/2013,"The place is beautiful but the lights are so dim you can barely read the menu. It was also very noisy.....we must have heard at least 15 dishes break just while we were there.  The menu is 20 pages long and a bit overwhelming.  I would expect to see Italian and American food but I don't usually associate Mexican, Thai, Chinese and Irish food with cheesecake.  The cheesecake was delicious though!"
L.T. G.,"Denver, CO",8,22,,5.0,3/14/2013,"When you can't figure out where to eat, this is the place to come because they have such an extensive menu. I always order something different and it is always great, not to mention all the different cheese cakes to choose from. My only complaint is that I always overeat when I come here, which is my own doing, but I can't help myself."
Luke K.,"Longmont, CO",97,24,7,4.0,7/30/2012,Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  We sat on the patio and it was great.  Our waiter (Conner) was great at suggesting new items and they were great.  I had the Miso Salmon and my wife had the Macaronni Cheese Burger.  Of course we ended with a slice of cheese cake.  Everything was great.   I will definitely be back.
J H.,"Summit, CO",1,13,4,2.0,11/16/2014,"I've never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory, so I had a group of about 15 friends who met up there for my birthday. We called ahead in planning and I heard my wife tell the server it was a special night for my 30th birthday, but the server / staff didn't seem to care. They were rather dull actually. We were a fun bunch so we still had a good time -- definitely more fun than our wait staff. The food was good as usual, but no birthday song, no dessert with candles (certainly not cheesecake), nothing special. If you're looking to celebrate your birthday w a group of friends someplace else might be more fun. We did hear other tables receive such favor, so maybe it was just our server?"
Jenny G.,"Denver, CO",42,121,,2.0,2/17/2010,"I've eaten at multiple Cheesecake Factory locations across the country - this one is the worst. The food tends to taste like it came off some kind of conveyor belt, which considering the price makes no sense. Do yourself a favor: come here for dessert only."
Greg H.,"Aurora, CO",72,334,81,4.0,10/25/2010,"If you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect. If you don't, then this is for you. You can generally expect to have a good wait time to get into a seat because the food is awesome. Do not mistake this wait time for poor service because it's generally anything besides lacking.  At this one in particular, you can also sit outside. Even on a brisk spring or fall evening it's comfortable because they'll crack up the outdoor heaters just for you. It's very nice as long as there's not a breeze. They'll start by bringing you a little bread, and all of it is worth trying out and making sure that they've got more coming for you. The drinks that they'll offer are pretty varied, from general bar items to very specialty drinks, but sometimes the beer selection is lacking oddly enough. Appetizers are delicious and as you can expect to find throughout the entire menu, it's all over the place. You can get a dozen kinds of pizza or chicken or a delicious pasta for that matter.  The main event though is of course.....the cheesecakes. I try to order a different one each time that I've gone in, but I've been to different locations dozens of times, and I haven't eaten the same one twice yet.  Enjoy!"
Shane A.,"Denver, CO",73,41,,1.0,4/5/2013,"Jack of all trades, master of none. That is all I can think of when I come to this disaster of a chain restaurant. Ended up here because of a birthday so I didn't have much of a choice. So many options and they are all terrible, got the fish tacos if you're interested. It was sitting so long under a heat lamp that the bottom fell out of all of them and I had to eat them with a fork. Service was equally terrible especially for a Thursday night. Did I mention it was overpriced? Not that i'm in love with chain restaurants, but if that is what you're looking for Yard House is a little further up on 16th street. That is a much better option in my opinion. I can't hate on the cheesecake and lemon cake. That was the only highlight."
kent l.,"Denver, CO",1,2,1,5.0,11/9/2013,"WELL worth ANY WAIT!! avacado eggrolls to die for. Fave is the Sheppard's pie, but you can't go wrong with anything one the menu. And it's the season for pumpkin cheesecake"
Danika L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",431,155,56,3.0,1/9/2013,"Great place if all you're looking for is cheesecake but they have no clue how to make 1/2 of what's on their menu, the carpaccio was awful! It was more like chunks of raw steak rather than thinly sliced beef."
Monica Thomas T.,"Arvada, CO",0,34,10,4.0,9/9/2014,Cheesecake factory is always good.  Service this time was excellent.  Waitress Catalina is amazing. Working her way through school request her. Food was good steak diane and lindas fudge cake...
Meagan W.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,5.0,10/22/2014,"I had my daughter's first birthday there.  They let me bring cake and decorations and even let me come in a bit early to set up (after I begged a bit!).  The result was a beautiful, family friendly dining place that made for a lovely, memorable birthday.  I could not have picked a better place!  They were so patient with all of us and we aren't the easiest bunch!  Friendly, but not the easiest!"
Beau W.,"Denver, CO",27,159,8,5.0,9/3/2014,"This has always been one of my favorites since I was a child. It was my first choice for my annual birthday dinner along with The Old Spaghetti Factory. That one has went quickly downhill over the years, but not Cheesecake Factory. It serves high quality everything. I have been all over the menu. I have yet to find something I don't like. As a child. I would always get the Four Cheese Pasta. Penne Pasta, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan Cheeses, Marinara Sauce and Fresh Basil. Also served with Chicken. This is one of the reasons I weighed over 300 lbs. Around 15 years old I realized what carbohydrates are and stopped eating it til I lost some weight.  Anyway, this is a decadent and rich plate of unhealthiness. With 30 grams of saturated fat, 1900 milligrams of sodium and 134 grams of carbs, this is one of the worst things you can put in your body. I don't care. It's delicious.  I recently went with my girlfriend. She ordered the teriyaki chicken. I rolled my eyes. ""Really... Teriyaki chicken. We have all these great pastas, steaks and seafood, and you choose teriyaki chicken."" I said. I'm not a huge fan of any teriyaki. I thought it would be a waste of a trip to order an out of place item like that. Boy was I wrong! This was the most amazing piece of chicken I have ever had. From the grilled pineapple to the perfect char on the chicken to the tender and moist inside of the meat. It was a masterpiece served with steamed rice. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. It was fantastic. Creamy and savory. A dish with perfect harmony. I was surprised by the cheese sticks. Obviously made in-house. Not your typical cheese sticks. Very good. I've been there many times and had many dishes. I wont describe all of them . Just know, they are all good. Of course I have to mention the cheesecakes. As Eugene Struthers would say. They take it to a whole nutha level. (google it if you don't remember Madtv) Always rich (very rich) and sweet. Sometime it's hard to save room with the ginormous portions of the entrees. Very generous. They do have smaller/half portions available for some items. All in all, a great place. Good for a casual lunch while roaming the mall on the weekend, a shnazy date  or a special occasion like an anniversary."
Meghan A.,"Thornton, CO",58,32,3,1.0,11/22/2013,"The food was okay, but the server ripped me and my family off. We had a large party and paid on two credit cards with a couple hundred in cash. The total we paid was enough for the bill, the 18% gratuity they added in PLUS another $10 because our family always tips at least 20%. Even with our generosity, they added another $10 to each credit card tab and processed it even after we crossed off their addition and wrote in the correct total. Giving yourself a 30% tip is fraud. I wouldn't recommend that you to there with a large table and pay for any of your bill with cash unless you also want to be stolen from."
Justin A.,"Denver, CO",131,121,1,4.0,9/5/2012,Incredible atmosphere for parties of all sizes from intimate dinner for two to a big birthday party group! I personally love how the variety of table tops to choose from including a great patio right along the 16th Street Mall. Pricey... for sure but servings are plentiful so expect to take leftovers home regardless of what you order. And don't hesitate to order the lemonade which is very delicious!
