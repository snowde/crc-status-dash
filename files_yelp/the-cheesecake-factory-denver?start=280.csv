Meredith G.,"Denver, CO",285,655,1552,3.0,7/22/2010,"Needing a lunch spot downtown I popped in here with a client yesterday. We were seated right away and brought water and then the server disappeared for nearly 10 minutes. That's to long for lunch vs a leisurely dinner.  So we ordered and the food came quickly. I had their chicken salad sandwich with a side salad. It was very good and enough for 2 meals. I just ate the 1/2 half.  Overall, ok, but the server was just a little weird."
steve c.,"Denver, CO",2,95,,1.0,10/14/2009,"GLUTTONY FACTORY Nutritionally, Cheesecake Factory is calorie hell because of the ""Big Gulp"" theory: huge plates of food drowning in fatty sauces and/or cheese. This appeals to the American ""more for the money"" theory. There are smaller portions available for just a dollar or two less. Cheesecake Factory hides their nutritional information under lock-and-key, as does Quiznos (also known for excessive fat and sugar content and high calorie products). A slice of the basic CF cheesecake has 1,150 calories, and 74 grams of fat. 317 minutes of walking, anyone? Carrot cake's healthy, right? Not at 1,560 calories and 84 grams of fat per slice. A cook at   recreated the Pasta Da Vinci, and came up with 3,736 calories and 165 grams of fat. The Weight Management California Salad, which has only -- only? -- 43 grams of fat. Read all about it in the article ""Calorie Pusher Comes To Town"" HERE'S THE REAL REASON TO STAY AWAY: The Cheesecake Factory is a charitable disaster. Speak to any development officer at charities in Denver and you'll find out the CF doesn't pump one dime, one in-kind gift certificate, one slice of fatty/fuffy/pasty cheesecake into Denver's active charitable community. BUT after the Breast Cancer Walk, the place is packed. Go figure. On the other hand, when Maggiano's moved into town, their PR machine cranked out letters to all the major charities letting them know when to submit their requests for participation, rules for sponsorship, and the amount of cash and in-kind participation available for the year. Maggiano's is a community-involvement powerhouse and has much better food. The kids at Cheesecake Factory are pleasant and hard working. I just can't recommend that corporate culture and unhealthy slop."
Hayden N.,"Portland, OR",163,591,501,2.0,3/23/2014,"Worst food and service ever experienced at a Cheesecake Factory!  On my visit to Denver, my friend wanted to go here for his birthday since they didn't have any in his hometown or where he currently lives.  All our Canadian friends were excited because there isn't one in Canada either.  I had the lunch portion Miso Salmon and my rice was very undercooked.  Asking for more miso sauce to moisten it so that I could choke it down didn't help.  I ended up asking for them to remake my order and they just brought me a side of rice, which was equally undercooked.  My friend had ordered the chicken tacos and they gave her fish tacos--after eating one, she realized that it didn't look right or taste the same so they took it back and brought her the right order.  Another girl I was with ordered a southwest chicken sandwich, they had set a chicken salad sandwich down in front of her and called it the southwest.  She took a couple bites and noticed it wasn't spicy nor did it have avocado in it.  Everyone received their food and my friend's little sister never gotten hers.  Guess what?  She had ordered the chicken salad sandwich so they rushed her order and offered to make the other friend a southwest chicken sandwich, but she didn't want it and had them take it off the bill.  I know there was about nine of us, but get your shit together Cheesecake Factory!"
Lauren H.,"Cherry Creek, Denver, CO",2,73,27,4.0,8/5/2010,Went back to the cheesecake factory for my bachelorette party.... our server was the BEST i have ever had. Compared to my last visit here it was night and day. Our server learned everyone's names... very impressive. Food was great and service was better then expected. Our server made our experience relaxed and fun.  My conclusion: who you get as your server here makes all the difference!!
Marie R.,"Chesapeake, VA",25,269,202,2.0,3/3/2012,"First off let me say I do love The Cheesecake Factory.  I am just not fond of this particular one.  My fiance and I went here not too long ago.  It gets very crowded as you wait for a table and the waiting area is very small, so you are kinda forced to go outside and wait for your turn.  Once we ordered, it seemed like it took more than the usual amount of time for the food to come out (BTW we ordered 1 appetizer and 2 entree's, if that helps. This is what we order usually at ANY restaurant).  Now, granted the place was busy, but I have been to other cheesecake factories where they were just as busy if not busier and our food still came out in a decent amount of time.  Also, the food here just tasted, well, bland.  Not the taste I had expected at other Cheesecake Factories.   I was looking forward to cheesecake when I first arrived but decided against it because of the amount of time it took for us to receive our food and the entree'st just disappointed us. But it's whatever.  The service was ok, nothing extraordinary.  All in all, I will not let this experience ruin my fondness for The Cheesecake Factory.  I just won't come back to this location and hope that the one in Park Meadow's offers something a little bit better."
Kathryn B.,"Parker, CO",0,3,,3.0,2/12/2011,I went there last night with a gf. Niether one had been there in awhile and really love the food there. We started out with a Martini each. Wow they were good but h*&^y cow really $12 each???  Skyy Vodka was used and again it was good but not $12 good.  I had the Vietnamese Tacos which were excellent. Soft bread with pork you should never go wrong. My gf had the sliders. Ha ha enough said as long as the beef is cooked.  Service was okay. Had to ask for bread and water which is unusal.  I will of course go there again but skip the expensive drinks and spend it on the food.
Cobra K.,"Singapore, Singapore",64,1257,5727,4.0,4/25/2012,Love the cheesecake. I don't eat anything else here!   Servers don't seem to have a problem with people just interested in dessert.  Tipped 2 bucks (one for each cake) and left after about 20 minutes.
Patricia A.,"Aurora, CO",68,39,59,4.0,7/22/2009,"Hard to find parking unless you want to pay more for it than your meal.  1 star drop. Now onto the best cheese cake and fettichini ever.... Love ya, just think you should validate parking in your building.  If you do talk with the rude security.   Will give another star......"
April M.,"Seattle, WA",3,50,,5.0,5/10/2010,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!! I have been to quite a few throughout the country and have been coming to this location for years- it is wonderful! The menu is extensive, the food is always awesome, the staff is friendly and the cheesecake... oh the cheesecake!  I wouldn't have thought to that it was a place to go for drinks, but their drinks are really really good! They are mixed well and pack a punch.  The only downside to this location is that everyone else loves it too- if you go anywhere from 5p-9p on a Friday or Saturday, be prepared to wait for a bit, although they usually tell you that the wait is longer than it actually is. Always a great experience!"
Jason M.,"Westminster, CO",66,158,3,1.0,3/9/2009,"Our party of 4 stopped off for a slightly late lunch, and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. 20 minutes later, after noticing that people behind us had been seated, we checked in and were told it would be ""a few minutes more"". 10 minutes later, after seeing a party of 4 (just like us) walk in and be seated almost immediately, we took our name off the list and were out the door. As a rule, I don't review places I've never visited. Technically, I visited this place, although I have never eaten there."
Dan T.,"Arvada, CO",1,11,,3.0,9/14/2011,"Great atmosphere and great staff. The food is good but this is a ritzy place that just didn't cut it for me. Our waiter put up with a lot of crap from my dinner guest and did so in an awesome way, that was my highlight. Food was good, but not stellar and that's kind of what I expected from almost $200 for 4 people. As for it being my first visit, I was as amazed as I thought I was going to be. I'll go back, but only when I feel like dropping even more money to see if they can amaze me then! Overall...good stuff"
Y. P.,"Seattle, WA",22,163,17,3.0,2/23/2012,"This place is very pricey and not-so-healthy but it certainly is great to go to for a good time. I love cheesecake and it's not so hard to make but there is something about looking at all the choices they offer. The food itself is fine, just a bit oversized and really, you come here for the cheesecake."
Evey M.,"Denver, CO",101,335,51,1.0,12/30/2009,"I remember going to a Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and it was on par with the one in Denver. The food is mass-produced, the cheesecake is ridiculously sweet to the point it hurts the teeth  and frankly there are so many better options in the area."
Kam D.,"Denver, CO",124,70,6,2.0,2/8/2014,The Cuban sandwich is solid.  Steaks are huge. And there's cheesecake. That's about it.
Jamie Y.,"Fountain, CO",0,4,,3.0,10/20/2012,"Stopped in for Lunch and even though the place seemed busy we were seated quite quickly .  The menu is always a chore to work through, although when you finally decide what cuisine you are going to order the food is generally good and you get a lot.  Be prepared to eat about half, or share  so you can save room for the cheese cake, which is why we go in the first place.  Good food and service.  Can satisfy various pallets.  Kid and adult friendly, nice place to go if you just want good."
Alden C.,"Tacoma, WA",4062,3492,716,4.0,11/3/2009,"I am not so much into Cheesecake like I used to be. I prefer to try to eat lighter things these days. Therefore I don't go to this place too much, however the pasta dishes and the cheesecake that I did have from here I always enjoyed."
Phil G.,"Denver, CO",7,196,1,4.0,3/26/2012,We celebrated my moms 60th birthday saturday. We had had over 20 family members. The restuarants staff was amazing. Everyone from hostess staff to the busboy was great. The two waitress's we had were unbelievable. Thanks for a memorable birthday for my mom!!!
Dylan S.,"Denver, CO",16,25,8,2.0,2/5/2012,"The food here is okay, just okay. The prices are a little overboard for what you get. I know a place call The Cheesecake Factory should have amazing cheesecake but in reality it's mediocre, especially for the price ($25 for an eight-inch?!). All in all this would be a place to avoid there are much better options around if you have the time or desire to look."
Carissa W.,"Denver, CO",2,5,,1.0,3/25/2012,"I came to lunch with 2 of my friends today, literally still sitting here waiting or the bill...all of our food came out at separate times- mine 15 minutes after the others came out. Too bad I wanted to have lunch WITH my friends! Instead of an apology I was told 5 times ""it's coming!"" I'm extremely disappointed! Im in the industry and understand that things happen but this is ridiculous! Never offered any resolution, just excuses! Still waiting for that tab...."
Brian R.,"Denver, CO",2,8,,1.0,2/5/2012,"Absolutely terrible. Made reservations 2 days ahead for a birthday dinner at 7. Arrived at 6: 45, manager informed us the table would be ready in 20 minutes. 30 minutes later 2 tables in the open seating bar area opened up, but we were informed we could not sit there even though we had enough people to fill the seats. An hour later our original table was finally ready. Service was ok. However, our fries came out later than the meal, and were cold at that. After asking for our checks, the ' mandatory' 18% gratuity was even applied. To top out off, our parking ticket that was ' validated' required us to still pay for parking. Will NEVER return, and will advise others to avoid as well. At least 25 better dining alternatives within a 100 yard radius that would be a much better choice."
