Gregory A.,"Denver, CO",9,86,38,3.0,12/31/2008,"What is up with all of these other negative reviews? I don't get why there are SO many negative ones and the two most popular complaints are the portions are too big and the menu has advertisements. Lame.  The food is yummy like all restaurants in the chain and the wait is long here due to it's location. The ambiance is raucous do to the location and tourists. I noticed things didn't look super clean.  Oh by the way - to the 90% of Colorado residents who were not actually born here - don't whine about tourists and out of town guests. If you don't like out of towners move to where they don't have any, I don't want to hear about it. New rule: Don't review restaurants when you are hungover. Blyuuaack! Gosh I am cranky! Don't take it personal. This CF falls short of the better representatives in their chain (Palo Alt, CA) so they miss their max of 4 stars by one."
Monika K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",494,978,1105,4.0,8/8/2011,"late night sunday night after a hard weekend wedding, outside patio table in the nice denver summer night, brocolli and asparagus cheese soup, thai lettuce wraps, high quality h20, fresh bread , friendly server."
Daniel M.,"Waltham, MA",95,344,,4.0,8/17/2009,"Most of the Cheesecake Factories I've visited are on the East Coast and based on a rather unscientific survey I'd rank this one at the top. Food was good...there were four of us, and we started with the yummy potstickers as appetizers. one of whom had the chopped steak, another who tried a whitefish dish, another with a 12 oz steak over rice and me who had a lightly dipped batter fried chicken over pasta with pesto. While my dish was a bit oily I heard raves about the fish and chopped steak. Portions for all of us were very large - we all ended up taking something home. For the desserts...one of us had Linda's Fudge Cake but required the assistance of the other three to finish. The rest of us partook of the Dutch Apple Caramel Struesel variety, rich and tasty and a perfect complement to our meals. Food was clearly above average and a better than what I've found in most of this chain's restaurants. What really distinguished this one, though, was our service. Generally the biggest knock I have against the Cheesecake Factory is its very slow service; however this one was a welcome exception. Elizabeth W., our server, was impressive in every respect, from her promptness, to the way she anticipated and answered our questions, to her knowledge of the menu. The entire company could take lessons from her. Very impressive."
Melanie L.,"Albuquerque, NM",83,149,5,4.0,2/22/2013,"If you're not in the mood to make decisions, don't eat here. The menu is extensive and I already have issues deciding what to eat when it's limited! The issue with such a diverse menu is that it tells me the restaurant doesn't specialize in anything. It just makes large amounts of food. Quantity doesn't always equal quality. However, the one thing this place does specialize in is their cheesecake and it doesn't disappoint! The pasta meal I ordered left something to be desired and had the typical olive garden, this sauce is too heavy for this meal type feel. The avocado egg rolls where a new venture for me and I liked them more for their novelty than for their greasy taste. They do offer over 50 options for cheesecake (decisions, decisions). I went with the white chocolate macademia nut (the waitress suggested it), and while it was yummy, it was also super rich. The tuxedo mousse cheesecake my friend had looked divine. The prices are what you'd expect for one of these trendy chains but at of all the chain restaurants we visited in Denver, this was my favorite. The only thing I'd like to add is that this place was dim. Infact, I think this was the darkest restaurant I've ever eaten in. It's like the kind of place you take your mob associate or the person you're having an affair with. If you want to see the people you're with--or your food, this isn't your bag, baby. Yeah."
Nova S.,"Aptos, CA",11,58,8,3.0,1/5/2012,"I ordered the crab cake sandwich last Saturday and it tasted great.  Unfortunately, I got really sick that night with diarrhea and vomiting.  Bummer.  The atmosphere and service were great.  Next time I will purchase nothing more than their cheesecake's."
Juana R.,"Denver, CO",18,4,2,5.0,1/27/2014,Food was amazing ! Service was great ! Had the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken and it ws great ! Have always had a good experience here !
Pamela R.,"Littleton, CO",26,21,7,3.0,1/16/2011,"We could not get into Ocean Prime restaurant so we decided to stop in here...very busy for 8:30pm on a Saturday night. We were seated at 9pm and diner was served at 9:30ish. Daniel R was are server and was running his butt off keeping up with how busy every thing was. The inside of the restaurant is huge and must seat a few hundred people! My husband ordered the beef sliders and I had a giant Caesar salad and the Chicken Bellagio, way too much food but very tasty. Our server seemed like a good guy so no complainants there.  I love going down town however I think The Cheesecake Factory in Park Meadows is better."
Lisa O.,"Denver, CO",73,89,2,3.0,7/9/2011,"Good for cheesecake, obviously. Having never been to the Denver CF, my boyfriend and I stopped in one night while strolling down 16th Street Mall for dinner.  Initially we sat outside on the patio, but opted to move in as soon as the equine crap stench wafted over us, as the horse-drawn carriage strolled by. The waitress was busy, but accomodated our request to move, even as our appetizers were coming to the table by another server.  We split a cajun shrimp jumbalya entree, and it was tasty with big, fat shrimp and spicy sausage.  The ahi tuna tartare tapas plate was decidedly good, too. The asian pork taco tapas things on sticky, thick buns - not so good. We sent it back because the pork tasted dry and cold, and the buns were thick and sticky, not light and fluffy like they should be. That aside, our server (both of them, since we moved inside to another section) were friendly and mostly attentive. We had a great cheesecake dessert, although I don't remember which it was. Tiramisu or carmel something - anyways, it was great. All in all, an OK dining experience."
tal n.,"San Francisco, CA",38,115,,4.0,5/30/2009,"This started off with an extremely targeted trip over to cheesecake so that we can celebrate a holiday that's all cheese.  And what can I say... the cheesecake wasn't great. So why the four stars? Because the service was amazing. It really was. We had to go back for an extremely special request and everybody, especially the manager, really went out of their way.  It actully makes me want to give the cheesecake another chance."
Ambra G.,"Denver, CO",8,69,1,5.0,8/29/2013,"Hands down, the BEST restaurant for those times when you're like, wtf do we want to eat for dinner!! Excellent ambiance, great service, casual yet sophisticated.. Excellent menu or all sorts of different anythings you can think of. The favorites of mine are: most of the salads, especially the tostada one, I get portobellos grilled instead of the chicken as I am vegetarian.. So big and so damn good, I never finish it, especially with that awesome bread n butter they load you with, the avocado egg rolls, SO good, oh my god!!!! And the tamarind sauce to dip in is superb.. Brilliant.. The Thai lettuce wraps are so awesome.. Fun to eat as you assemble them by hand and do not need silverware, comes with carrots, noodles, cabbage, I get portobello, but it normally has chicken, cucumbers, sprouts, etc and those awesome peanut and tamarind jalapeño sauces.. The fry bread sandwich is EXCELLENT! The burgers are excellent, the fries, just everything is excellent, honestly. I love the painted ceilings and walls. The cheesecake is of course amazing, I love the crazy ones like the cookie dough one or the pineapple upside down cheesecake. Only drawback is there are no reservations accepted.. And the line is always super long so, we go during off hours like 2 pm, or 3pm. A true mainstay for me. And it's all over the world, so I'll never have to go without, lol."
David F.,"Denver, CO",1,19,3,2.0,3/2/2012,Aside from the cake itself this place is a bust. The food at this place is weak and you really leave wanting something good. The building itself on the inside is very nice but that is part of the problem as when you see it you expect the food to be really tasty. The service is good and thats a plus but falls short all together. The big downside to this place is the amount of want to be yuppies go there. This place is filled with people that think they have a lot of money.
Megan L.,"Denver, CO",7,42,15,4.0,9/14/2010,"typically, i go to the location in park meadows mall, but i've been to this one a few times as well. i never remember a difference between the food/service between the two locations. my family is a HUGE fan of this place. i however, am kind of meh about it. the menu is huge so no matter what you're craving, you'll find something (they even have some lighter options for the calorie conscious). of course, the cheesecake is yummy. i remember when i used to eat beef, i was in looove with their burgers.  i've been coming here since i was a little girl and i've only been 'disappointed' about twice. first time, i ordered a philly cheeseteak and it was just boring. blah. but edible. second time, i got the bbq ranch chicken salad. decent & somewhat tasty, but not what i was in the mood for (so why did i order it? i'll never know) but i definitely made up for it when i ordered dessert. of course the cheesecake is always delicious, but the black out cake - OH. MY. CAKE. we ordered our desserts to go and when i got home, my slice was HUUUUUUUGE. i got sick forcing myself to finish it off! seriously - a lotttta chocolatey cake. mmm mmm mmmmm. i've also had their club sandwich - yummy, typical club sandwich. nothing spectacular. their garlic noodles are pretty good as well, and the appetizers never disappoint no matter what we get. my mom raves about the cajun jumbalaya. the service has never been BAD - they get pretty busy though.  so if you don't mind spending money, go here for some pretty good food and delicious desserts."
Kathleen A.,"Denver, CO",460,610,3,2.0,3/28/2008,"What makes this place so popular? I just don't get it. The food sucks. I mean, really really sucks. And they give you a TON of it also. I came here on New Years Day because nothing else was open and I needed something to nurse my hangover. (Yes, I know I'm a bit late on this review).  Sadly I felt sicker leaving then I did coming in.  The only redeeming quality of this place is the cheesecake. It is phenomenal. Next time, I'll just take that to go."
K.M. M.,"Castle Rock, CO",5,140,33,3.0,3/29/2013,"What can I say, it's a chain.  The overall consensus between the three of us was: ""I'm so full""...painfully so!  Thus, the portion sizes are rather large.  The deception was when the waiter said, ""I will bring you some fresh bread from the oven in just a few moments.""  Warmed in the oven, maybe.  Fresh-baked, not!  The drinks were good, the salmon great, chicken ok, burger great.  There were a few mishaps with our orders (i.e., the rotating salad that kept coming back to our table) and the wait on wine, but otherwise, everything was good, especially the cheesecake!"
Heidi M.,"Denver, CO",0,24,,5.0,7/27/2011,Excellent food.  Most variety on a menu I've ever seen.  Every time I've been I get something new and it's always delicious!  And the cheesecake is scrumptious!!!
Mozza R.,"Boulder County, CO",2,116,27,2.0,1/22/2010,Over priced food. Mediocre quality. Only things I like are the cheesecake and ultimate margaritas.
Laura G.,"New York, NY",110,95,1,1.0,12/15/2007,"ATTENTION: one one star is not a mistake. Just writing this review makes me cringe with awful thoughts of my meal. The experience itself was pleasant, waited at the bar for my crew, had a glass of wine (not a good idea while sick, oh well) while only waiting probably 20 minutes for a table. Once sat,our waitress impressed us all by memorizing seven different dinner and drink orders. But, I still rate it one star because of the meal. Blame it on the cold if you wish. I ordered ""Renee's Special"" which consisted of: 1/2 a turkey sandwich, soup of the day (broccoli and cheese) and a salad. After about 20 minutes, our meal finally arrived. Never again am I going to order ""Renee's Special"" what's so special about it? The soup was unbelievably salty, so salty I only ate about 3 bites of it. The sandwich was ok but not that exciting - I could have made it. The salad was actually pretty good but there was too much red cabbage. Not fun. I can say the Snicker's cheesecake rocked. That's it. Next time I'm ordering a cheesecake TO GO. This place is not my cup of tea."
Ron B.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,5,,1.0,9/24/2013,"The Tuna was grey and the manager a over weight dark haired woman told me the Tuna was fresh, Grey enough said. Go to outback and order the app. That's real tuna anywhere in the country, red and fresh. BLOOP GAME over"
Becky S.,"Wolfeboro, NH",210,448,21,2.0,7/26/2007,"My theory is that people read the hundred-page menu and see the advertisements for things they'll never be able to afford and think ""Hey, rich people must eat here because they advertise in the menu... I'm fitting in with the upper-crust!"" when in actuality the place is bogus and overloads you with food that's just on the better side of okay.   I've never made it to the dessert round because I tend to fill up on weak drinks trying to catch a  buzz so I can get philosophical and come up with a good reason why - again - I'm eating at the Cheesecake Factory."
Amanda T.,"Denver, CO",3,1,,2.0,6/6/2013,"I usually don't write reviews, but after my experience at the restaurant & then when I tried to heat up my leftovers, I felt the need to voice my opinion. I'm super easy going and don't expect a lot, but I seriously had the worst service I have ever had in my entire dining out life. I was there on Sunday evening, it wasn't too busy because it was about 10, The two of us, showed up and requested the patio, there was wait which was totally cool, the hostess was super friendly and we headed to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. The bartender was on it. Very nice and made us feel comfortable. Then we were called to our table within 5 min of getting a drink. We went to the table it took about 5 min for the server Neil to come over, he didn't introduce himself, if appeared annoyed that we already had drinks, He said "" are you going to eat? what do you want?"" We didn't even have a chance to look over the menu. So we asked him to give us some time and then the service just got worse from there, I saw the other waiter go to his tables way more than I even saw our waiter, After about 15/20 min wait, we ordered our food, then didn't see the waiter again until we were about 1/2 way thru our meal. I ran out of wine and wanted another glass, I had to as the other waiter to find our waiter so I could order another glass, then he seemed to be annoyed, then when he came back out to the patio, he didn't even bring the glass of wine, then about 10 min later I got my glass of wine. My friend had finished his food and I needed a box so I asked to have him box up my leftovers. The night was ending, he didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. I wanted cheesecake to take home, so since he wasn't going to ask - I asked for a slice of cake and the check. I don't know what his issue was but he was extremely unprofessional, his appearance was not up to par (his pants were halfway down his butt), and he just didn't seem to want to be there. Oh and to top it all off, I went to heat up my leftovers today and he threw in the ramekins for the sauces (from the restaurant) no lids, they spilled all over and were dried out. So ridiculous! I know you have to go containers. I love the food, the hostess & bartender were perfect. I wish I had just stayed at in the bar area. I know I would have had a much better experience."
