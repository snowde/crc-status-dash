Dustin G.,"Denver, CO",74,410,293,2.0,5/3/2007,"Hm... You know I don't think I would dislike this place as much if it weren't so damn popular and busy at every instant. This is one of those places where your out-of-town relatives that don't quite know your tastes well enough want to take you when they want to do something nice for you. Instead, what you get it is...well 1:Long wait 2:Cramped tables 3:Long wait again for your waiter/waitress 4:A huge menu with...........ADVERTISEMENTS?!! wtf... 5:Food is mediocore but priced like it isn't 6:And well the cheesecake? They give you so much food that it seriously hurts to try and fit that last fat and sugar block down your throat. Ouch."
TC W.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,62,4,3.0,11/5/2010,"I wanted to review the specific Cheesecake Factory I went too in Florida, but the meal I had on 16th street matched in quality. I've actually ate here many times and have never had a bad meal. Ever. Doesn't mean they are the greatest, but they know what they are doing. I usually go w lettuce wraps, but have done Thai noodle salad, fettuccine alfredo, and chicken parm. All great. Its a corporate spot, but holds it down regardless. Solid 3.5"
RUSSELL G.,"Arlington, VA",9,110,,5.0,12/5/2010,Went there after the Parade of Lights. The place was absolutely swamped.  Normally I would not wait for a table but was there for a party.  Amazingly we did get a table within the time they said.  The service was great and the food great.  Amazing how they can operate with a place so absolutely crowded its hard to even walk there.  Great job!
Dave H.,"Denver, CO",16,64,,2.0,8/4/2007,"I can't imagine anyone reads reviews for chain restaurants, but here goes anyway. The cheesecake is obviously good, if not awesome. The dinner menu is huge and disappointing.  The bar is nice but small. Patio is very attracted to the homeless element."
Christina H.,"Denver, CO",54,147,3,1.0,10/30/2009,I still think The Cheesecake Factory is awful! And I doubt I will ever return. But on re-reading my review I think my tone comes off overly aggressive and I sound like the kind of person who would be pissed off now matter how well you treated me. I have to reiterate that everything I wrote happened and that my girl-friend still huffs at the mere mention of The Cheesecake Factory. I just want to put it out there that I was very pleasant to the server/manager and all my anger was belated by shock. I think I'm a pretty pleasant person who is easy to please and late to complain but The Cheesecake Factory remains to this day the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.
Sheena J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",106,37,3,4.0,10/3/2010,get the dulce cheesecake!  it's always busy so be ready to wait about 15 min.  food and service is awesome!!
FX H.,"Broomfield, CO",6,134,1,3.0,3/27/2010,"Went there for a lunch. One host sitting people. Other host, a girl was on the phone for long time, not ackowledge us.  Host is not paying attention. was got the phone chating with friend and ignore us for few minutes. Good thing, other host was helping. Request for a booth table and we willing to wait for 10 minutes. Of couse, the time e need to be seat, the ignorance girl host is the one who seat us. Food was great, service was good. Overall, is good."
Elizabeth H.,"Denver, CO",3,72,,1.0,9/23/2010,"They drag their feet about posting nutritional information, and there's a good reason, everything is insanely unhealthy. I can't get behind that."
Sarah Z.,"Littleton, CO",2,12,,1.0,9/3/2010,"Came in for dessert only. We tend to really dislike the food here so we came in for dessert. 30 min after asking for it to go and ordering something they claimed they were out of we got our cheesecake. Subpar service, cheesecake is ok, but the food sucks. Stay away!!! Eat anywhere but here."
N l.,"Denver, CO",0,54,44,4.0,12/4/2010,"I love going here with my friends. Just to relax and have a good lunch/dinner follow by a yummy piece of strawberry cheese cake. I love their chop salad here. It is huge so you need atleast 4 people to share it with. My favorite here is their steak with shitaki mushrooms. Overall, their food is good, portion is humongous and priced right.  Their cheesecake is to die for. I love their orginal cheesecake with fresh strawberries. They have many other cheesecake flavors to choose from."
Sara H.,"Lakewood, CO",44,142,3,2.0,1/26/2009,"I used to love Cheesecake Factory.  I always got the chicken picatta.  It is tasty, the cheesecake is awesome.  However, I recently got the chance to dine here again and I spent quite a bit of time afterward puking!  I can not recall ever being so sick before, or at least not for a very long time.  I don't know if the chicken was bad or undercooked or what. Perhaps I ate something prior that did it.  All I know is that if you puke up all of your dinner, chances are you won't want it ever again.  Sorry Cheesecake factory, if I ever go there again it won't be for a very very very long time."
Miguel V.,"Miami, FL",93,436,92,4.0,4/6/2009,"Pretty good overall. I got the seared ahi salad, which was pretty small for $16, but it was very well-cooked. My wife ordered some sort of chicken farafalle that was very delicious. Of course they had the bread, which is amazing as usual. I ordered a nice big 22oz. beer for about $6, which was a pretty sweet deal. A friend ordered a delicious looking burger and another ordered some very nice looking cheesecake. I really like this place and they are pretty consistent. I've been to this location once before about four years ago."
Luis U.,"Denver, CO",7,20,1,5.0,8/23/2009,"i really liked the food, service, and ambient. The prices are fair, and the dishes were served just like they look in the picture. well organized and real sized servings. i will definitely come here again."
Robin H.,"Denver, CO",167,397,28,4.0,1/15/2009,"OK, chain restaurant aside, the Factory is great.  A little hard to get a quick seat but the food is worth it.  I have to admit that I usually get the same thing when I come here.  The Shrimp Scampi, if I could dive headfirst into the plate I would!   The cheesecake selection is well, large -try the Chocolate Chip Cookie-Dough cheesecake or the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake - YYYUUUMMM!"
Raj R.,"Denver, CO",4,36,12,4.0,11/29/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory at Denver is extremely busy. So if you go on a weekend night be prepared to wait. It took us almost 30 minutes to get seated. But luckily its on the 16th street mall and so you can walk around as they provide you a pager. It might not look it from the outside but the restaurant is huge and goes pretty far into the back. So dont look for an intimate setting - the restaurant is very busy and so noisy too. The reason I liked this restaurant is that they have food for everyone. They have a few chinese dishes, american fare as well as italian. The prices on most dishes range from $15 to $20 and the portions are huge (you will most definetly have to take some back home). The waiters were nice, though a little busy and so running around a lot. But we never had to wait for a very long time. Finally, if you go to this restaurant, you must definetly have one of their cheesecakes. The Tiramisu cheescake is definetly awesome. These range in price from about $6.50 to $8.50). Again the slices and pretty big and you will most probably be taking some home. The alcohol was a little on the expensive side (a beer was $6.50) and so were their cocktails. On sundays, they are open for break-fast. I would definetly go there once again, but only as a group. Definetly not a romantic place for a couple. The desserts make it extremely kid friendly."
Sierra K.,"Parker, CO",13,43,1,5.0,12/14/2009,"I love this place! The food is good and I always have excellent service. The place is pricey, but if you can get in before 5 and get the lunch special you still get a ton of food for half the price. Their Sun Dried Tomato Chicken Fettuchini is to DIE for! I just love it! :)"
katy b.,"Fort Collins, CO",52,117,,2.0,11/20/2008,"go to the cheesecake factory for the cheesecake. they have an extensive EXTENSIVE menu with EXTENSIVE items of food. however, i've rarely been impressed. and for not being impressed, that food is daaaaang expensive. i do like the environment however, and the fact that it's on sixteenth, so i say stop in for some cheesecake. eat your dinner elsewhere, or, if you're like me, have a meal of cheesecake. and then try to go eat dinner later, and probably end up way too full. it is called  cheesecake factory, not extensive menu of food factory."
Lara W.,"Littleton, CO",12,55,22,2.0,10/18/2010,"In a town FULL of exceptional local eateries, it is simply a waste of time, money and tastebuds to eat here. I'm not a fan of chains for the exact reasons this place exemplifies! Overly large portions of butter and salt, a lack of creativity and maudlin servers who are only thinking of when their shift ends. Unfortunately, my daughter chose The CCF for her birthday lunch spot since her favorite restaurant was closed. Although she relished the monstrosity of a cheesecake slice she was given, I was unimpressed by the slow service and bored expression in our servers face, even when I asked if we could do something special for her birthday. My shrimp pasta dish was nearly coagulating in butter sauce and the shrimp were tough. The overly-descriptive and novel-esqe menu may promise great expectations...but it's all window dressing. The reality is that the food is mediocre and all this place seems to have going for it is it's prime people-watching location on 16th Street Mall!"
P. S.,"Denver, CO",1,104,,3.0,7/15/2012,"I really want to give them 4 stars, but the quality has gone down.  Even though I eat at the CF often, it is just not the same anymore.  I have ordered items that have been just down right salty and inedible.  The cheesecakes have been the only items where the quality has not changed."
Steve O.,"Boulder, CO",39,99,18,4.0,8/31/2009,"Had their Greek Salad and their fried Mac & Cheese appetizer the other night. Greek was good, but the M&C was UH-MAZING!"
