Joseph C.,"Denver, CO",37,273,184,4.0,6/4/2009,"A group of friends and I decided to take in the Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch, mostly consisting of appetizers while doing some people watching in the outdoor seating area. The service was good as we were promptly seated and our orders arrived in a short amount of time considering the amount of food we ordered. Each item we had was very good, from the potstickers, to the Tex Mex egg rolls(my favorite), etc. I didn't have the cheesecake, I'm sorry to report, but maybe the next time."
Mia S.,"Denver, CO",19,90,14,3.0,1/3/2011,"Cheesecake..what happen to you?!? You used to be my favorite place to eat but on New Years Eve, you were terrible. The calamari was bland. I didn't finish it. And the Caesar salad was terrible! how can you mess up Caesar salad?!?"
Chelsea S.,"Arvada, CO",5,11,,2.0,10/26/2008,"I do love their cheesecakes...that's about it.  My boyfriend and I went there for a quick lunch..it took an entire hour for our entrees to be served. An hour! The cooks either forgot our order or the waiter did....salmon should be pretty fast to cook..no? It was not busy in the dining room, either. I hate their seating arrangement because you are literally 2 inches away from the next table. I want to eat lunch with my boyfriends..not with 2 other couples on both sides of me. The salmon.....an hour later..was dry and overcooked. Blah! A chain is a chain....but 2 stars for their cheescakes. I'll get it to go next time."
Green Eyed G.,"Denver, CO",304,8,1,1.0,7/13/2010,"I have to start off by saying that I am always optimistic and ambitious when dining out. As one who is in the service industry in the downtown area, I know what to expect for the type of crowds at various places, and am always excited to support local business. Going to a corporate chain however, always leaves me with an experience I could have done without. This last visit was the perfect example of why I dislike anything corporate. It leaves very little to the imagination, and MUCH to be desired. I have always loved dessert here, and was excited to have my favorite chocolate tuxedo cheesecake. We started off here for a friends birthday dinner. She had called earlier in the day to reserve a table for 12, which they didn't do because ""we wouldn't need a reservation. Just come on in!"" This was just the beginning. We bellied up to a busy Thursday, and a 50 minute wait for a table. As we gathered round the bar, service was decent. I was unimpressed by the liquor selections and all I found was a list of over sugared concoctions, and even less to be admired with in the liquor department. A beer was sufficient. Our bartenders however, were pleasant and kept our group occupied and happy.  When we DID get our table, our waitress was pleasant, but did take 20 minutes to get just water on the table (1st priority in my book), and when I ordered a vodka press, had no clue what it was. Really???? Ok, so lack of knowledge doesn't make her a bad person, but in this industry, it's ALL about your service knowledge! So another 10 or so minutes goes by before cocktails hit the table, and sadly enough some drinks were even forgotten. When we tell her that we want separate checks to avoid a hassle later, she says she will split them later (Oh, boy). So we finally ordered, (after reading our novel of a menu), and all seems to be picking up. What saddened me is the amount of staff running amok, looking miserable, and clearly not doing much for one another. Even the obvious floor manager passed our table with empty waters, bread baskets and cocktail glasses without as much as a 2nd thought or offering to help his staff in clearing as something as simple as an empty glass or 2. When our food did finally arrive, it literally came out 2 plates at a time, since our waitress clearly had not much support staff to back her up, save for the one gentleman who helped her with 2 plates. I wish I had our server's name, because she was nice, but really...after waiting almost an hour for our table, and waiting for things to pick up to a relatively decent pace, things just never got past so-so. When I went to make change at the bar to pay my bill, another server was more perceptive in the 1 minute at the bar, than any other service we had all night. If I had thought that the manger seemed concerned, I may have asked to speak with him. Oh and adding 18 % gratuity to a table that you give virtually no service to, hardly constitutes as acceptable. Had you given proper service and attention to begin with, you would have received a hell of a lot more from a group who eats, sleeps and breathes in Denver's nightlife. Thanks for bagging our food to go, but with portions like that, it's probably pretty routine. Long story short, spending 3 hours here just to get over-sized portions of mediocre food, left none of us wanting dessert, which was the main reason we came in the 1st place. I'm pretty sure that unless I get cheesecake to go, or have to attend another event here, I won't be spending any more time here."
Viviene W.,"Denver, CO",44,72,4,3.0,12/2/2008,I enjoyed the special chicken dish. I don't remember what it was called. My boy-friend's bang-bang thai shrimp dish or something which wasn't all that great. I love the cheese cake!
Shiho F.,"Carmel by the Sea, CA",4971,2834,2440,3.0,11/29/2007,Usually pretty busy and the service is pretty good.   But other than that nothing too special about this particular Cheesecake Factory.
Penelope W.,"San Francisco, CA",61,385,95,4.0,2/15/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory is an especially coveted Colorado eatery, but why?  Well, good 'ol fashioned American cuisine.  Huge portions, and...cheesecake of course.  Notorious.  I am tellin you.  If you have been in Coly for any amount of time, surely you have heard of this joint.  No complaints...well, watch out for calories.  Larger than life!  Good food though, my Dad likes this restaurant."
Daniel T.,"Denver, CO",16,242,7,2.0,1/23/2007,"Not my favorite, but not the worst. The food was ok, and they do pile it high. This place is busier than it should be and would an ok place to stop if you were in the area, but you can usually expect a wait so... eh. I don't mind going with friends, but I don't suggest it either."
