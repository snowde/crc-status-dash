Ryan M.,"Dillon, CO",0,30,3,5.0,9/21/2017,"Excellent service and experience. On top of everything from customer service to quality of food. . .  Richard was our server, he was very helpful and professional. I will be coming back with friends and family when they come to visit"
Arantxa A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",144,11,13,4.0,5/8/2017,"I got the 2 eggs with breakfast potatoes and bacon, not bad! But their chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake was SENSATIONAL."
Alex S.,"Loveland, CO",0,6,,2.0,9/13/2017,"So the food I had was pretty good, Thai coconut Lime chicken... minus the fact that they garnished it with spicy hot peppers and do not have a warning about this what so ever on their menu, this was not even a listed ingredient. So yeah, had an unpleasant surprise that made me choke on my food. Once removing the garnish the food was pretty good. Service was fast and friendly."
Lu M.,"Gillette, WY",76,14,11,4.0,1/29/2017,"Last night my lovely friend Priscilla and I had two great chicken dishes.  Her breaded chicken bites were so tender, juicy, & just the right amount of seasoning.  My chicken & pasta dish was sliced very thin, seasoned perfectly, covering a warm bed of pasta.  We both had leftovers so we had enough food for two meals for the price of one.  The mango mojoto's were nothing short of amazing."
Robert G.,"Littleton, CO",144,175,206,1.0,10/15/2015,"Mmhmm... Cheesecake Factory has always been a solid dining choice for me when downtown, but this time wasn't so great. Was here on a Sunday night for a family dinner with the in-laws, so a total of 7 people. Overall, I don't think anyone of us thought the food was any good. It took about 45 minutes to get our food and it was cold when it arrived. The managers came to personally apologize, but nothing beyond that.  I went with Chicken and Biscuits with extra chicken. The gravy has a ""crust"" on the surface when it came and looked more like slop than gravy... The biscuits seemed to come straight out of a bag and the chicken ""breast"" was a flat piece of chicken, probably frozen.  It was a disappointing visit..."
Jenn H.,"Perth, Australia",32,454,912,3.0,1/31/2016,"Situated right on 16th St - Great place for a quick bite. It's spacious & very busy on a Sunday arvo but we were seated within 10 minutes.  The service was prompt & efficient.  The menu is massive & comprehensive. And if course the cheesecakes! There are so many to choose from. The serving size is pretty generous & it's served with a giant dollop of cream. The bread came first - The brown bread was delish! The white bread was a bit too hard.. The chicken  enchiladas was tasty. It was served with black beans & rice. The Renee's lunch special was average. I had the turkey sandwich, salad & chicken  soup. The soup tasted more like melted cheese with chunks of chicken.. The greens were fresh. Sandwich was ok.. The serving sizes are pretty big so make sure you leave room for dessert!"
Jill L.,"Loveland, CO",91,60,112,5.0,2/2/2017,"Service was excellent,  friendly.. kept checking on us and refilled water as needed.  The Chinese chicken salad was flavorful as usual.  Tried the sweet corn tamale cakes, my new favorite.  Sweetcorn bread covered with green chili sauce, tomatoes and sour cream, with a perky Chipotle sauce.  Yum, you've got to try them."
Miriam K.,"Orlando, FL",31,61,70,4.0,12/26/2016,"This place is always ALWAYS packed.  Cheesecake is obviously very good with over 20 options to choose from. Food is ok, it's a chain with options for all. Good service, tends to get a little loud and the wait line outside is intense."
Josh G.,"Denver, CO",5,8,1,1.0,7/23/2017,The breakfast here is a must stay away. The food is very bland and boring. It's called the cheese cake factory for a reason!
Andy H.,"Denver, CO",144,114,3,2.0,11/12/2016,"Walked in after a nearby show at about 10:30 for a quick dessert. Proceeded to see two other groups seated ahead of us who definitely arrived after we did. Finally got seated and had excellent service thereafter. Definitely need to work on their late night seating process, as I surmise there are a lot of lucrative dessert & cocktail patrons to be served then."
James Elijah D.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,5,,5.0,7/24/2017,"Amazing! Great service, food came WAY fast,  cool food design, I like the gluten free.  My sis loved it too.  Good portion of food.  I ordered spaghetti and meat balls,  gave me a huge bowl. Cheese cake was amazing! Fancy, medium good price. Lots of thanks 2 our waiter.  Thanks Saun!"
Alex M.,"Denver, CO",50,37,26,3.0,10/8/2016,The cheesecake is very tasty and very sweet. The service was slow and the wait staff was visibly rushed but at least everything was clean. This is a good sport for desert but I would t make it a regular dinner place.
Neal S.,"Evergreen, CO",30,52,52,4.0,8/3/2016,"Beware, this menu is the size of a small book.  The Cheesecake Factory is a downtown Denver classic that everyone needs to experience. I have been several times now and I am always taken back at the incredible service and the high quality and quantity of food. The cheesecake here, of course, is marvelous. There must 100 different flavor same assortments of it, and all of them are delectable.  From birthday parties, to romantic dinners, the Cheesecake Factory promises to satisfy."
Carrie W.,"Navarre, FL",53,26,24,5.0,5/4/2017,Always love the factory.  Haven't had it in awhile so my husband and I made the 15 min walk from hotel for Sunday brunch. So glad we did and we could walk it off on way back lol.  Took a few cheesecake slices back with us.
Allie R.,"Denver, CO",537,405,946,4.0,11/8/2015,"I mainly like the cheesecake factory because its consistent. Eventhough they have a million dishes to choose from, their chicken piccata and the crusted chicken romano are my go to entrees. These dishes are perfect for sharing. Every time they are perfectly cooked. Also when you share one of their incredibly huge dishes you can save room for some of their incredible cheesecake. If you like carrot cake try the carrot cake cheesecake. My new favorite."
Ricky W.,"Denver, CO",24,37,11,4.0,5/16/2017,"It's cheesecake. You can't go wrong with cheesecake. The menu is huge, the cheesecake is bomb. Your kids will be happy and so will you. The serving staff is always quick and responsive. Never had a problem with efficiency or order accuracy."
Chad H.,"Austin, TX",755,234,296,2.0,12/22/2016,I generally give good reviews. Hard here. Food came out not together 10 mins apart a plate. My steak medallions came out last and ice cold. Manager was nice and compd my dessert. I dont send food back. Desserts came with no forks but check immediately dumped with them. It was sort of a mess
Frank F.,"Central, Denver, CO",38,4,1,1.0,5/5/2017,"Their cheesecake counter is beside their dinning counter (indoor n outdoor). We wanted to enjoy the cheesecaske in the comfort of their place. We be more than willing to pay a fee if needed. Was told to wait 10mins for both indoor n outdoor seats. However we could see lots of empty seats in both areas(indoor/outdoor), really cannot understand why do we need to wait that long for a seat. I believe they do not want cakes customers to take up space for diners who likely will spend more money. While I went to take a call, staff was rude to my wife, was told to take the cake n go. We won't come back again."
Dominic D.,"Florham Park, NJ",221,165,43,3.0,6/19/2016,Standard! Huge menu but just another CF. it was busy and my kid was starving so we ordered his chicken strips right when we sat down but they were not delivered until when all the main courses came out.
Jay J.,"Seattle, WA",0,22,14,1.0,4/29/2017,"I have been a long-time customer at the cheesecake factory for over 20 years, and visited this particular restaurant over 100 times and this was the worst service and most disrespectful service I have ever received! We went in the afternoon with a handicap individual and ask for a booth to accommodate her that is easiest to get in and out, less pain for her and the hostess said that was only one booth in the entire restaurant we could sit at or its going to be over a 45 minute wait for our small party of three even though when you looked around there must have been only 20 customers in the entire restaurant itself, obviously they're short on staff and the hostess said most of the sections were closed..They gave us a table that was completely circular very difficult for the handicapped individual to get in, and the hostess did not care nor the waiter when I asked them about the poor table  accommodations. Already not getting typical cheesecake factory service we sat down 10 minutes later bread came out and the waiter and then another 10 minutes past before the drinks arrived at 20 minutes after sitting down I am astonished because there were hardly any other guests in the restaurant! When the bread arrived it was not properly wrapped in a cloth napkin for some reason it look like they were disposable and napkins set on top of the metal with the bread touching the basket everywhere pictures are displayed to show this disgustingness lack of sanitary conditions for the bread. The waiter was very rude would not explain anything on the menu and only came to the table twice in the hour and a half we were there and he also clocked out of his shift before our table was gone we asked for help and they said he already went home for the day I cannot believe to be so disrespectful to your table while leaving them and also being rude to them while rolling his eyes at our table when we were asking questions. Our table wanted to talk while we ate that is why we came in early knowing that there would not be a lot of people unfortunately we could not talk or catch up because the table was never cleared it, it was disgusting there was a sauce on the table even and the waiter came by and said oh my and walked away never cleaning it pictures are displayed also how awful the table locked at this not clean Cheesecake factory standards. I was embarrassed that I took my guests to this establishment and I will be letting everybody know how bad the service has declined at this location!"
