Sumi A.,"Southeast, Denver, CO",16,109,37,5.0,8/1/2016,"I cant get enough of the cheescake factory, i always order my favorite "" di vinci pasta"" and no matter how packed it is service is pretty quick and even if it gets a little slow they always make up for it with a smile. I recently came in and after dinner ordered my cheesecake to go but when i got home i realized that the slice given to me was really small compared to the usual, so i contacted management letting them know that i was dissatisfied and they didn't disappoint me, i received a letter in the mail with a gift card! Awesome management and customer care. No wonder i visit it in every country i find it in!"
Taungporn C.,"Denver, CO",1,5,4,1.0,2/28/2017,"Had dinner here a couple of times but had never written the review. The restaurant itself looks good, servers have quite slow service and response. Food is ok.  Here is the real bad thing that happened to me tonight which convinced me to write this such bad experience. After finished my meal, I provided 2 gift cards as I bought from this exact restaurant location at the end of last year to pay for the meal. Ten minutes after I checked, the server came back and informed me that one of the two cards didn't go through. I showed her that I just checked the gift card balance at their cashier just right before I got seated (I also provide her the paper that I received as an evidence of gift card balance checking which was clearly stated everything they need to know to prove that I really had that amount until the server took my card for check). The server then left my table again (about 10 minutes) and came back with acted manager. The manager told me that after he tried every single way to check my gift card on their computer, it still came out that this gift card cannot be used because it had 0 balance in it. He also asked me (not very polite manner) whether I used it after I had checked the balance at their cashier. Wait!? Is that what the manager of the well-known restaurant should ask their customers? It's like I knew that I have already used that card and I still used it to pay for the food. Come on! even little child knows what should he do in this situation. The manager still tried to find out if I misunderstood or I lied by trying to check the balance of the gift card online. Absolutely, he couldn't find anything but the balance was zero. I spend almost 30 minutes at that time to wait for the checked out process and that made me missed the bus to my home. I then tried to figure out by myself that what's really happen to me. So, the first thing I did is to call the gift card department. The gift card representative informed me that the gift card had been charged for the left amount during the period of time that the server brought my card to check. I let the GC representative talked to the manager. Thank god that he didn't accuse me whether that was the real cheesecake factory gift card representative. The truth came up that I told the truth even I didn't know what's really happen to the charging process, I guess it's because of their system or human error. I had never experienced this bad service before since the problem came to the manager, his reaction disappointed me a lot. The manager who suppose to have power and knowledge to manage the situation like this professionally but came up doubting his customers. Such an unprofessional habit of the restaurant manager. I could say that I was very angry at that time. I felt like someone slammed their hand on my face because I want to eat for free. Someone might ask 'Why don't you just simply provide another card for them to charge?'. I will just ask them back 'Why would I paid more since I had already paid them for the gift card?' Was I impatience enough to give them a chance since they already spend more than 30 minutes of my time fixing the problem?"
Judy N.,"Greenwood Village, CO",66,46,5,5.0,2/5/2017,"This place has the best food and desserts, you have to try the fire cracker bites and their amazing cheescakes"
Josiah L.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,1.0,8/22/2017,Honestly the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. We decided to go here when we were on vacation in Denver. Back home we never had any problems. Unfortunately it was a little but different here. The food was cold and tasted a little bit old. When we asked for the manager he was very unapologetic and acted as if we were incompetent. Although our server was great!
Farah B.,"Denver, CO",56,55,1,4.0,6/23/2016,"Amazing food, service and atmosphere. The patio is the best place to enjoy your meal, while people watching 16th street. I would give it a 5 star but the drinks are insanely overpriced which put a wrench in the evening."
Rodrick T.,"Lubbock, TX",1,6,10,5.0,3/20/2017,"We tried some of their new special menu items tonight, and they were pretty good.  Party of 2 was seated fairly quickly for a busy Friday night.  Drinks were good, food was good, service was good - and best of all the CHEESECAKE was AMAZING (as always).  I have been to this location a few times on different visits to Denver and have not had a bad experience."
R. Tony S.,"Denver, CO",471,169,272,3.0,10/2/2015,"Who knew?! Felt like a tourist in our own hometown of Denver and it was fun! Received a gift certificate for this place and made a Friday night date night and it was perfect.... TIP: sit literally at the bar; makes for a more authentic experience, not to mention quicker service! Surprising is the ""skinnylicious"" menu, and I had the Ahi tartare ...raw tuna with avocado and and a soy-ginger sesame sauce... Great taste, presentation and fresh... 390 calories, and entree was the Fresh vegetable salad... Green beans, roasted beets, edamame and bunch more veggies topped with a unique pomegranate vinaigrette...490 calories! Nicely greeted, awesome service, great ambiance!"
MusicLover J.,"BOWLING GREEN, NY",1,12,21,5.0,8/13/2017,"We were seated right away even though it was dinner time. The waiter came right over and was happy to take our order and not wait since we knew what we wanted. We were only ordering 2 appetizers and he still offered us bread, which was nice. The fried mac n cheese was amazing like usual. The avocado egg rolls looked different which worried me, but they tasted just as amazing as they do in other locations."
Mike L.,"Henderson, NV",0,6,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Thanks for ROYALLY screwing this up! My daughter is attending college in the Denver area, first time away from home, and we had arranged for her 18th birthday(we could not be there as we don't live in Colorado) to be celebrated at this Cheesecake Factory with classmates.  40 minutes to be seated(even with a reservation) and another 40 minutes without so much as getting anything to drink!! The girls were informed that the CF would not place their cake in the fridge while they were dining. Thanks Cheesecake Factory, that wasn't a cheap cake!! Eventually, having been ignored, the group left and split up!! Needless to say, my daughter was BEYOND disappointed and depressed that the event went so horribly and she was spending a special birthday away from her family! So, thanks for completely screwing up a special event in a young ladies life!!! I've seen the other reviews about your horrible service.  You MAY want to look into that, but you will NOT be getting my money when we visit her in the future."
Lily S.,"Denver, CO",146,622,3464,4.0,8/6/2014,"This is just going to be my thoughts on the landmark dessert: always stick to the single layer cheesecakes! While the super tall, multi-layered cake-cheesecakes are tempting and great looking, you're not getting that much ""cheese"" in your ""cake""! Case in point: The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake has a nice tangy cream cheese frosting but the red velvet cake part was very average. And the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Brownie Cheesecake may look decadent, the brownie layer was an overkill, and not even that exceptional. The Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake? Too syrup-y and too ""confectionery"", if you know what I mean. Note to self: always look at the cheesecakes at the counter before deciding. On the menu, the new Lemon Meringue Cheesecake did not sound good at all. But after we're done and I stole a peek from the counter window, it looked so simple yet classic, and pure!"
Eric W.,"Parker, CO",8,10,,4.0,3/21/2017,Went there for lunch today with my Dad.  Our server Mikayla was phenomenal! She was knowledgeable and very attentive! Food was delicious and the strawberry lemonade was great!  Hope to have her again during a future visit!
John M.,"Denver, CO",31,70,17,5.0,7/10/2016,"Great food and cheesecake. Good service and knowledgeable staff.  Will recommend to all of my family and friends.  Validate parking but you still have to pay 1.00. ? Overall, good."
Samantha G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",19,111,131,4.0,10/3/2015,"Busy place, and I know why; great food! The atmosphere is visually pleasing, but louder than I prefer. The service is friendly but a bit slow. The food, however, is excellent!"
Jason D.,"Denver, CO",0,29,12,5.0,7/25/2016,I'm giving it a good review because it deserves it. Out of towners really enjoy going there and so we take them and everyone is always pleased with their food. Not sure why people hate on this chain so much.
Brian L.,"White Sands Missile Range, NM",1,2,,1.0,1/27/2017,The service sucked! The waitress always seemed to be inconvienced when I requested anything! This place is definitely not a place for families. Everybody around us was wasted and we could barely have a conversation at our table because of all the drunk bastards in here.  Not coming back! Go to another location if you want Cheesecake Factory.
Cara H.,"Amarillo, TX",2,16,,3.0,12/27/2016,"We took family from out of town out for dinner.  We were told an hour wait.  Our buzzer went off at 30 minutes. When we took it to the hostesses, they took it but didn't seat us.  When we inquired about the wait, they said it wasn't our turn.  No apologies, no explanation.  We had to beg for another buzzer. Then, while waiting in the waiting area, the manager announced people could go sit at tables around the bar because it was too crowded, so my mother in law went to sit and was told by the waitress she couldn't sit there. They were out of the food I ordered but my replacement meal was delicious.  The saving grace was our excellent and attentive server. I'd be hesitant to go back again."
Chloe C.,"Denver, CO",0,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,"If I had written this review a month ago, they would have gotten a solid four stars. I've been coming to Cheesecake Factory for literally decades, and always met my expectations (decent meal, nice atmosphere, fair prices for the portions). Tonight however, I ordered the herb salmon and received a blackened, totally burned fish that was inedible. I apologetically sent it back, and 20 minutes later the manager personally served me completely raw fish. Of course the manager came back, said he was so embarrassed, and we walked away with a free piece of cheesecake and paid a $70 bill even though one person in our party didn't even eat dinner. Manager looked at the floor when he walked by our table while we finished our wine.. total slap in the face. Never, ever again."
Joel W.,"Northwood, OH",10,21,8,2.0,11/27/2016,The only saving grace was the cheesecake and decent service. The food and drinks way too pricey. I've been to many Cheesecake Factory's in my day and this was by far the worst.
Devorah R.,"Denver, CO",199,262,1247,4.0,3/26/2016,Amazing chain resto. I've been to the one at Redondo Beach for dinner and Breakfast Brunch here as well as lunch and dinner. Great food and service and their mimosas... Yum! Great for brunch!
Gabriel S.,"Denver, CO",12,117,150,4.0,6/24/2015,"Love this yummy place! I go once a year and am never disappointed. Staff are excellent and love to help out customers. Parking is a hassle, and the lines are long. But hey, it's downtown at a wonderful restaurant. I recommend this place."
