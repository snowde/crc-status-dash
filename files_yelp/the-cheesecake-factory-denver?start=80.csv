Robert V.,"Denver, CO",0,11,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Ran out of salad?!! Ordered something else, 43 minutes and counting. Waiter has no clue as to when. Why bother?"
Jeff C.,"Denver, CO",0,11,,1.0,5/31/2017,"I had the Asian Salad last night and it was bad.  I absolutely don't recommend it--it should be taken OFF the menu.  Take lettuce, carrots, and 1 oz of chicken and drizzle olive oil over it--no taste what so ever.  The cheese cake dessert was fantastic."
Erika R.,"Plano, TX",11,28,17,4.0,5/5/2016,"First time at this location. As always, great food and great location! I had the lettuce chicken wraps which are always amazing! Great service l! The Long Island Ice tea was over priced and really ok, not great. Disappointed with the drink. Overall, very good food."
Brielle G.,"Aurora, CO",121,65,69,5.0,2/14/2015,"I've been here a few times now for late night dessert and wine! The cheesecake is incredible each time! I'm a huge fan of anything chocolate so I have tried the anniversary cheesecake which is exquisite and I recently tried the tuxedo cheesecake which has a mascarpone layer which makes the cheesecake even more creamy and delicious! Topped with whipped cream you can't go wrong with this especially if you are a chocolate lover like me! Paired with a glass of rose wine this was just what I needed! The white Zinfandel wine is also a great dessert wine that goes great with cheesecake! If you're in the mood for something sweet check this place out as they have a huge variety of cheesecakes to choose from! Ask the waiter what their favorites Are and they always give great recommendations and never steer you in the wrong direction! Besides the delicious dessert offered here, the service was good. They had a table for two ready for us in about ten minutes which was great, because it gave us a little time to look at the cheesecakes before we sat down so we had an idea of which ones we wanted. Great dessert spot if you're around 16th street you will never be disappointed!"
Honest O.,"Denver, CO",0,40,,1.0,5/25/2016,"So I tried the Denver location and they SUCK! I had a reservation and still waited for an hour for a table. Then we waited for an hour and a half for our food. We never got a refill. We also ordered appetizers that came with our meal.  We told the manager about our expiprernece and he said, ""sorry."" After a $500 tab for my family.... And it was special occasion.... ""Sorry."" Considering we watched people at tables around us be served and come and go..... He really should have done more than saying, ""sorry.""  My take away, the Cheesecake Factory is SORRY. I will NEVER go back. They are nothing what they used to be- they are a high priced Chilies."
Brenda J.,"Denver, CO",0,14,,1.0,11/30/2015,"One of the worst experiences we've had recently!  Busy, the wait wasn't long though. Server came brought drinks.  Came back for our order and that's when things went downhill at warp speed. Botched my daughters order completely and brought exactly what we did not order. Then they tried to fix it, and brought the same wrong order a second time!  I ordered a quesadilla and the first thing he asked was, do you want chicken in that. I responded yes because that's that only way I ever eat them. He said ""great, I'll get the order's put in.  Well you can probably guess all I got was a sticky cheese quesadilla. I showed him they error and he says, Oh, you DID want chicken in that??  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was speaking English when I said that and you confirmed what I said. Later 2 employees scrambling to fix my daughter's order and they leave in a rush. At no time did either them, or anyone for that matter ask if we needed our drinks refilled. The service was just sad and disappointing all around. Prices are over-inflated, and on top of all that I'm pretty sure it was the shrimp that were likely undercooked that made me a bit ill last night. No way we return to this place.  No way."
Haley S.,"Denver, CO",0,17,,4.0,5/9/2017,Always really crowded but that is to be expected and even with the crowd I've never had to wait more than 5 mins for a table. The food is always good the portions are huge but every time I go I always feel like our host/waiter/waitress hates their job.
Chance H.,"Denver, CO",421,170,1840,4.0,12/20/2015,Great place for large groups downtown. Plus I also like stopping in for just dessert. Large portions and great cocktail menu!
Ryan N.,"Denver, CO",78,57,68,3.0,12/6/2015,"Every part of me wants to give this place a higher rating but overall this place is average food at best. However this is the ""cheesecake factory"" and their cheesecake is amazing!! Over the years I've had the fortune of trying over half of their flavors and let me just say every single one is a slice of heaven (Especially the Peppermint bark) if you love sweets, this is the place for you! Sadly the life changing cheesecake simply cannot make up for the service and food. I've been here numerous times and (other than dessert) have left disappointed every single time. The staff is one of the most unorganized groups I've ever seen, the moment they become somewhat busy they turn into a group of chickens with their heads cut off... Additionally the food is very bland and does not offer anything that stands apart from a red robin, olive garden or Applebee's. Every dish is very simplistic and could honestly be made at home.  Overall I highly recommend coming here for dessert only!"
A O.,"Gillette, WY",0,24,19,4.0,4/2/2016,"The wait to sit was long and taking name system outdated. Watched a hostess walk around restaurant for 3 minutes looking for someone who was already called. They need to get beepers or something to call patrons when their tables are ready.  On to the food. The comp bread was good, a little stale but ok. Butter for the bread was frozen. Too hard to spread.  The loaded potato soup was fabulous. Best soup I've ever eaten. Creamy, with chunks of potato, chives, and bacon added an explosion of flavor.  The bacon bacon burger was cooked perfectly. Medium, lots of juices and flavor throughout. The ""secret"" sauce complimented the burger. Any more sauce though and it would kill the burger. The bun- way to big for the meat. Did not care for all the extra bread.  Overall, A-"
Amber V.,"Westminster, CO",20,71,72,3.0,3/7/2017,Stopped in on a busy Saturday evening around 430pm.  They were able to get my party of 2 seated within 10 minutes and our waitress had our drinks and fresh bread within minutes as well.  I did notice the couple next to us ordered some alcoholic beverages and that took about 15 minutes for them to get.  My husband ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger that cake with fries and he had no complaints as it was not greasy and a pretty big portion size.  I ordered the lunch size Herb Crusted Salmon since we got there before 5pm and it was amazzzzing!  So fresh and tasty.  Just the right about of herbs to not make it overbearing.  My only complaint was that the Asparagus was basically raw.  We ordered our usual Banana Creme Cheesecake to go and that was yummy as well and came with Whip Cream and a sliced Banana.  I think this place serves portions worth the value.  It's clean and has a good atmosphere whether you are on a date or having a family dinner.
Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",227,850,,4.0,11/18/2015,"The almond-crusted salmon salad is terrific if you like kale.  My friend thought the dressing on the vegan cobb salad was bland, so I'd recommend you get a different dressing if you order that particular salad."
Pamela M.,"Little Rock, AR",3,39,19,5.0,2/6/2016,"I've been here twice and will continue to return when I visit Denver. I'm not sure if all CCF are the same but this one knocks the ball out of the park. It's not just the cheesecake that makes this place special, the entrees are superb. The menu is so large that there is something for anyone. It can be a little pricey but they offer plenty of inexpensive choices, also."
Lan V.,"Denver, CO",177,205,179,5.0,11/23/2014,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to with a big group. Although they don't take reservations, the wait is worth it. We had a table of eight and they sat us in a corner booth that was spacious and comfortable. The service here is great! I love the complimentary bread that comes with the meal. The sourdough is my favorite and they always give you plenty of butter for the bread. I ordered the cuban sandwich and it was amazing! The bread was crispy and buttery, and the ham and pork belly was seasoned well and not too salty. I'm watching my calories, so I asked for no cheese and the mayonnaise on the side. But the sandwich was still really good. I definitely can't wait to visit again.  Tip: They have a low calorie menu, so you can order something under 500 calories if you want. :)"
Sasha L.,"Denver, CO",268,436,388,2.0,9/3/2014,"I know two people that have worked here. I have also eaten here a few times and at different locations as well. Pros: - You feel like you are eating in a palace. - They have alcohol here (but it's expensive!) - National cheesecake day, bogo cheesecake (Often a 2 hour wait) Cons: - Overly abused staff (look at the life come out of their eyes as they recite the hundreds of specials they just had to memorize). One of my friends referred to this place as ""Slavecake Factory."" - Very high calorie density, 2 days worth of calories packed into one sitting at this place. - High prices, low quality. This food ingredients sound fancy, but it is corporate, be honest with yourself. Don't come here. Denver has so many impressive local restaurants nearby, just walk a few extra blocks. You will pay less, and your wallet and stomach will feel much better. For people complaining about slow service, keep in mind these poor white crayola crayons with the tie have to run through a palace to retrieve what you need."
Martin D.,"Reno, NV",0,24,,2.0,12/3/2015,"So we had the crab cakes and the artichoke.....DELICIOUS! Then we each ordered different cheesecakes.......................I imagine eating sweetened MUD might be the same. Heavy, paste like, not-very-good-tasting, stick to the roof of your mouth......... Cheesecake is part of their name and the signature dish should be MUCH better. Maybe they should call the place the Crab Cake Factory."
George L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",75,137,141,2.0,12/18/2014,"Arrived at about 1130 and had a short 10 minute wait to be seated.  Taken all the way to the back and seated along with 2 other groups at the same exact time.  Not sure why they insist on doing that when they could wait 5 minutes between groups to give the staff time to get a drink order from each.  I can't be upset at our server as we were one of her first three tables and she was immediately overwhelmed. Sunday Brunch, Brûlée French Toast and a side of extra crispy bacon. The French Toast is a large helping with a couple of strawberries on top and the side of sweet brûlée to pour over the toast.  The bread was slightly crispy on one side where it had been on the griddle but was cooked throughout for the size of the pieces used.  Overall it had good flavor and was plenty for one person to consume. On the down side, I've gone to a number of CCF in the past and the overall experience I had with my party on this day was much like all the others.  Pretty sub par.  I will probably just stop going to the Cheesecake Factory as a whole due in part to the combined poor experiences I've had over the many years."
Denise R.,"Aurora, CO",650,491,905,4.0,2/6/2016,Came out for dessert tonight ....but this place is always so busy.    which is good.   the food is good.   so we had to get are cheesecake to go but so worth it
Melissa W.,"Golden, CO",0,4,,4.0,10/3/2016,"I love everything about The Cheesecake Factory: You have a lot of meals you can decide from, the water does not really taste like chlorine (which is a huge plus!! We don't have water that tastes like chlorine in our home country and I don't want to get used to water that tastes like chemicals), the cakes are heavenly good, the waitress was the most nice and patient waitress I've met so far, you get free bread to snack on while deciding on what you want to eat. The only downside is that the meals are on the pricier side. (Burgers around $13, pasta around $16) When I went there this weekend for an early lunch, my friend and I were the first people at the restaurant and could save a good table on the patio. The restaurant fills pretty quickly, so we were lucky to have such a good table. As it was our first time there, it took us longer than usual to go through the menu, because they have so many options. They even have a smaller menu with low calorie meals, which I find is pretty nice. The waitress was very patient with us, because even after 20 minutes of sitting there, looking through the menu, we still couldn't decide on what to eat. She even offered her help to find a meal for my friend, after asking if she's in the mood for burgers, pasta, sandwiches, etc. I asked for a mix of the ""skinnylicious veggie burger"" and the normal veggie burger and without she took my order without questioning it. We both enjoyed our meals and ordered  some cheesecake for dessert. The Oreo cheesecake is heaven on earth! The slices are worth the price of $6.95-7.95! I hardly spend a lot of money on dessert, because I'm pretty specific when it comes to pastries, but I can 100% recommend that cake! We also had the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake, but that one was too heavy for me, even though I love Reese's. I'm not giving 5 stars, because I think the prices are too high, but you definitely come here every now and then when you want to have a good time with great food! :)"
Kento O.,"Golden, CO",19,3,,1.0,2/4/2017,"Poor management. Came here with a party of 8. Took us 2+ hours to get seated. Even if they were waiting on a table to open up, you would think they can put tables together. Apparently that isn't a thing."
