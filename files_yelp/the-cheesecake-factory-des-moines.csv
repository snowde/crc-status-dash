Charles S.,"Iowa City, IA",8,85,2,5.0,10/9/2017,"Okay, so maybe there isn't a new chef as I'm unsure of their turnover.  However, there was definitely a positively delightful new experience at the West Des Moines, Iowa location of the ever popular Cheesecake Factory! For the first time, in a very long time, the Cajun chicken littles were not over cooked.  They were just simply scrumptious!  A delight to eat.  This is my all around favorite at CCF to enjoy when visiting WDM to get away from the frantic football ""hot mess"" in Iowa City. The waitress was super polite and attentive.  The bread/butter service was super-duper.  The new way to do the butter (slice instead of individual packets) was a homerun.   Yeah!  Go Team CCF!"
Michaela E.,"Winterset, IA",0,8,7,2.0,1/2/2018,Wait was forever to get a meal that was over priced and less than great tasting. If you are looking for cheesecake to go this would be fine. For an actual meal you would be better off to go into the mall and get something.
Rachel L.,"West Des Moines, IA",5,174,235,4.0,10/19/2016,"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants! I always go for the pasta dishes. The chicken bellagio is one of my favorite menu items they have for around $15. The whole menu has a wide array of everything though.  The waitstaff is really good about giving recommendations if you can't decide. And they are quick at knowing when you need a refill or anything else. This place has great food dishes with healthy servings and recommended if you're in the Jordan Creek area. The amount of food you get with each dish makes this place even better. Expect it to be fairly loud during peak business hours. And they pack you in pretty tightly. If you decide to re-arrange to a different table, because you don't want to be touching elbows, they are usually pretty good about it.  Tucked into the Jordan Creek Mall, this place has many people come through the doors. No reservations of course because what's the point in that? The wait during the week nights is about 15-20 minutes but you'll have plenty of chances to look at the menu while you wait. If you arrive on the weekends plan for a longer wait. You'll leave with a full stomach."
Florence N.,"Des Moines, IA",0,12,34,1.0,6/13/2017,"Today's encounter will be my last at Cheesecake Factory.  My meal started out with a blue cheese salad, which had no blue cheese flavor.  It had an extreme about of garlic in it that dominated it. The menu described the pasta  I ordered as being in a rich tomato sauce; instead came out charred.  The sauce was dried out and tasted burnt.  When I said something to the server he was annoyed and expected me to know exactly what else I wanted to order right then.  When I did figure it out, I ordered their lemon shrimp pasta but asked to have linguini or spaghetti instead of the angel hair. He said ok but still brought it out with angel hair. I asked to speak to a manager,. The manager immediately knew what was wrong so the waiter had to know he was giving me the wrong thing. The manager apologized but was not genuinely apologetic.  He offered to remake the dinner with linguini.  After about 20 minutes my dinner arrived but the shrimp was over cooked. I ate it anyway. They  probably  used the same shrimp from the pasta that was wrong,  and therefore they were dried out/over cooked. Overall a waste of $20+ and therefore I will not be back!"
Mark H.,"Ames, IA",4,143,8,4.0,10/7/2017,"My wife and I live in Ames and don't get down to Des Moines all that often, but we had some errands to run there today and decided to visit this restaurant while there, since I had never been there. Based on our experience, I think it likely that in the future we will make a special trip to Des Moines just to eat here. Soon after being seated, our cokes came along with a basket of very good bread and butter. I had the crusty French bread, which appeared to be part of a bagette, and my wife had what looked like some kind of oat bread that she thought was very good. A second basket was cheerfully provided upon request at no extra charge.  I had the chicken parmesan ""pizza style"" (it should really be spelled ""chicken parmigiana"") , which is an unusual dish: chicken is pounded until it is very thin, shaped into a disc, then breaded and served with melted cheese and tomato sauce. It comes out looking like a pizza, with the ""crust"" being the chicken, with a large ball of pasta sitting on top of it. It was delicious, and didn't suffer from a problem that I have had with chicken parmigiana in the past, which is too-thick chicken. The portion was huge; the disc covered an entire plate. My wife had the chicken Riesling, which she also loved: this was chicken with Riesling white wine cream sauce, along with bacon, onions and mushrooms. I had a few bites of her meal and agree that it was excellent. I'm not a mushroom fan and was glad to see that it had more bacon than mushrooms; my wife would have preferred it the other way. Her portion was also generous, though not as huge as mine; we both took about half home for leftovers.  We also splurged and split a dessert, Linda's fudge cake. Chocolate cake lovers will enjoy this: multiple layers of excellent chocolate cake with fudge frosting on top and between the layers, served with an extra-large dollop of whipped cream. Although we both loved it, we also couldn't finish it and wound up taking about half of it home, too. We both agree that in the future, given the quantity of food that is served here, we'll probably skip dessert, but we were curious about it and wanted to try it this time. Photos of our entrees and dessert, courtesy of my wife, are attached. On the basis of the food and waitress quality alone, I would likely give this restaurant five stars, but three circumstances conspired to knock the rating down one star. First was a timeliness issue. We arrived a few minutes after the restaurant opened and although there were still many open tables, we had to wait about four or five minutes to be seated. (A word to the wise: when we left at about 12:30, the place was already mobbed; this was on a Saturday afternoon and perhaps the restaurant is not that crowded on a weekday.) The brief wait to be seated was not that big a deal, but, after ordering, we also had to wait quite a while for our meals, to the point where our waitress told us that she would check to see where the food was. My second quibble concerns the size of the restrooms. They seem too small for a restaurant of this size and mealtime population, and indeed the ladies' room had substantial lines when my wife used it. I suspect that people from Jordan Creek Mall who were not dining here were coming in to use the restrooms.  Finally, there is the price. Our entrees ($14.50 for mine, $13.95 for my wife's) were not cheap but did not seem unreasonably expensive, but our dessert seemed a bit high at $8.50 and our cokes, at $3.25 each, were probably the most expensive beverages I've had in any restaurant in recent memory. All told our lunch, with tax and tip, cost almost $55, which seems rather high for central Iowa. But, given the quantity and quality of food that we had, the price will not deter us from eating here again."
Sean B.,"West Des Moines, IA",182,64,67,4.0,12/11/2016,"For a late-night, after-show place to get consistent food, The Cheesecake Factory is all right. I seem to end up here after concerts, plays, and some early evening event. I only order Tex Mex eggrolls and a piece of cheesecake to take home. The service is consistently good, and food arrives hot, and the cheesecake is always good. Currently they have the peppermint cheesecake and it's seasonal so I definitely had to make a stop. It's a chain, the portions are huge, it can be a bit pricey, but when it's easy to get two meals from your order, really it's a decent deal."
J B.,"Kauai County, HI",12,523,13,4.0,9/20/2017,Amy was awesome at the bar. Pleasant demeanor with a cheerful and welcoming disposition. I was able to get in right before the end of happy hour and she took great care to present the good eats and best deals. Great employee and there should be more like her. Bravo!
Nathan C.,"West Des Moines, IA",3,30,17,4.0,10/19/2016,Cheesecake Factory has an amazing menu and the food is just as good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they pile you in there. The tables are way to close together. Other then that the menu has just about everything you can think of and of course there's cheesecake! Yumm
Holly K.,"Windsor Heights, IA",41,10,117,4.0,1/27/2017,"Fiancé and I got back in town from Vegas yesterday and decided that - you know what? We needed carbs. Could have had something to do with coming home to snow. After brief discussion, we settled on the caloric tastiness that is Cheesecake Factory. Our server, Javier, was both friendly and good at his job. Always appreciated. Waiting on our appetizer, the brown bread was delightful and lightly sweet, like always. We started with an appetizer that we were both craving, the Cuban Rolls. As usual, they were delicious and the sauce to dip them in hit the spot. We both ordered our usual - for me, the pasta carbonara with mushrooms instead of peas and extra bacon. For the fiancé, the chicken Bellagio with extra sauce. Both did not disappoint - smoky bacon, tasty mushrooms. There's been mistakes in the past, but this visit was nice! I recommend."
Angel H.,"Round Rock, TX",24,42,20,1.0,8/31/2016,Great cheesecake!!!! TERRIBLE FOOD.  the manager was a total jerk.  My nachos came out burnt and was told that's  normal because of the grease??? I won't be back.  This was only my second time there. I had the same experience besides the burnt nachos. Terrible food and good cheesecake.
Mark C.,"West Des Moines, IA",21,113,22,4.0,11/5/2016,"Came here for my birthday dinner, and have to say I was pleased. The wait was only about 15 minutes on a Saturday night, which for Cheesecake Factory standards is phenomenal.  Ordered a Modern Old Fashioned, which contained Knob Creek, Orange, and Blue Moon. Went together quite nicely. For my dinner choice, I opted for the Steak Diane which was topped with a peppery mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. It was well prepared and tasted delicious. My dessert choice was the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, which had a great combination of flavor and was very nice sized piece! (Almost) enough to split. I would return here in order to try one of the million other things I can try on their epic menu."
Jaimee J.,"Des Moines, IA",26,101,85,4.0,1/24/2016,"Maybe you guys are sick of me talking about gluten-free food. You shouldn't be, it shows how much a business cares about all of their customers.  Their GF menu is off the charts, and they'll generally make everything to fit your needs - whether you have allergies or not. Extra sauce? Sure. Cook with oil instead of butter? Definitely. Generally the staff is really friendly and knowledgeable, but if they don't know, they'll ask.  My normal choices are the 4 cheese pasta (without cheese), or the old fashioned burger with a gluten free bun. They toast the bun and it is fantastic. Their burgers are large and really filling, with a few interesting choices. Fries are a good choice, because any substitution is charged ala carte (not the best business, IMO...), but you have to ask them to dedicate a fryer. Celiacs- remember that. As for the rest of the menu, they've got what seems like hundreds of choices that are all made well and my husband likes most of them. Would not go here for a steak or seafood, save that for some of Des Moines' local joints. If you're craving lots of carbs, fat and sugar - Cheesecake Factory is your go! What could make this 5 stars for me? More professional staff, maybe another GF appetizer and definitely a little more light in the dining room."
Mark S.,"Ankeny, IA",34,51,188,4.0,5/1/2017,"Always a great break in the Jordan Creek Mall complex. The Restaurant is very large but the kitchen must be scaled to handle the usual large crowds eating here on the weekend. Food is always on the spot with great flair and great taste. Menu is huge which makes for hard decisions but I've been before so know the good sections; appetizers, Salads, Burgers, and Tacos. The fun of this place is to scope out the cheesecake counter before hand to get a slice pinpointed to follow a great meal. A favorite of ours is the Aloha Chopped Salad that towers high and makes for a good shared dish followed by the Mango Key Lime Cheese Cake and can't forget the many flavored egg roll appetizers ahead. Since the first time I at at Cheese Cake Factory in Chicago I have been a loyal fan of their efforts to treat every customer with  the best they have and it always stands I will be back for Lots of memorable meals."
Morgan M.,"Newton, IA",17,3,1,3.0,8/14/2017,"Normally love the Cheesecake Factory--the salads are amazing and huge, and I've never had a bad slice of cheesecake. But wrote this review to warn people of the fettuccine alfredo. Tastes as though it's one of the $1 stove top pasta dinners that you add just milk and water too. Chicken tastes as though it was canned and microwaved before being mixed in with the pasta. Not trying to be dramatic! Just a alfredo lover, who was disappointed. Loved the service, drinks, bread and cheesecake though!"
Jay B.,"Paducah, KY",8,2,,3.0,8/6/2017,"The food is wonderful and the brown bread is to die for. My only concern is the service. I have gone there several times in the past couple months and every time the service has been horrible. One time my waiter was hitting on the hostess and told me he would be right back with my check but it took 20 minutes. Again, great food but the service almost makes it not worth the food."
Dmitriy N.,"Waukee, IA",20,226,490,5.0,3/10/2016,"I love this place.  Every single time I come here I have a good time.  The food is good, the drinks are awesome (but kind of expensive), and the cheesecake is to die for. My favorite is the Godiva cheesecake.  It is heaven in the form of a slice.  And not a small one!   The environment is very nice.  Dim lighting, nice décor, and just that good warm feeling of satisfaction. Only complaint is there is always a wait.  But that's to be expected here because it just that good.  Yes, its a chain, but it's a very very good chain!"
Nathan S.,"Story City, IA",4,22,,2.0,8/15/2017,"First time ever trying Cheescake Factory, and likely my last.  Had the meatloaf lunch.  It tasted similar to what I remember the TV dinners were when I was a kid.  Definitely overpriced, and very disappointing.  The service was good and attentive, but food quality was poor."
Kristyn M.,"Des Moines, IA",78,460,1289,3.0,11/25/2015,"Sat fairly quickly considering it was a weekend and just after the lunch rush. Is this a good sign or a bad sign? Its not always my first choice for restaurants out in the Jordan Creek area but this wasn't my turn to pick.  The waitress took little to get to us but once she did.... well... lets say I wish I remembered her name. She was overly sweet, helpful and cheerful. She made us all smile and kept a close eye on us. Any request was quickly taken care of. Kudos to her! She was one in a million with really good service on her part. I think they needed to rethink the design of the restaurant. The arched ceiling make for a louder than needed ambiance. I felt like all the sound echoed and carried more than it should have. The radio could be turned down so I didn't have to raise my voice or the waitress struggle to hear my order. I decided to try and eat decent. (ha) Skinnylicious Caesar Salad: Romaine Lettuce, Croutons, Parmesan Cheese and Our Special Caesar Dressing. If you are a light eater - ASK FOR THE HALF SIZE.  I didn't realize that this thing would come out on a plate bigger than my head. I hate to waste food. I had to box over half of this salad up. Waitress said even on this menu I would have had to requested a lunch size.. HOW is this Skinnylicious at this monstrous portion? Just saying.  Somehow my lunch buddy got a half size on hers, ... which was the same thing.. without the chicken. We could have shared the salad.  However she ONLY got the salad cause they were out of the Turkey Burger (fail) . My other lunch buddy got a pasta with shrimp. I cant remember the name but she really enjoyed it cause it was inhaled and gone!  Last of course, we left room for cheese cake. The only down side is they have just ONE choice for gluten free cheesecakes on the giant list. Good news it was the Godiva Chocolate Cheese cake. Holy mother of chocolaty goodness. It's so rich that the three of us could not finish it and, oh darn, had to take it home too.  So my feed back overall: 1. Service from this waitress: excellent- again wish I remembered her name.  2. Louder than expected atmosphere 3. overly HUGE menu full of advertisements (which I don't get) 4. Does have gluten free options on normal menu.  5. Do still enjoy the warm bread they bring out."
Lauren A.,"Waukee, IA",10,45,113,4.0,3/5/2016,"Came here on a Friday night at 8, waited half an hour for a table, and then another half an hour for drinks. It seems like anytime I come here I always have to wait. Which is okay. Their cheesecakes are to die for, and that's coming from a person that does not like sweet. The food is pretty much up there too. I had their kobe hamburger, it was juicy and everything you can ask for in a hamburger.  It's a good place for a date night, but expect to spend over $100. :-)"
Hil H.,"West Des Moines, IA",26,178,76,2.0,10/4/2015,"The service is generally pretty good and the food tastes good.  But if you eat here, the food will probably kill you due to its nutrition, and this place is horrible about giving that information out, answering questions about the content of the food, and adds things to your food that you simply don't want and don't know to tell them not to add (why was there powdered sugar on a mint leaf on top of my maker's mark)? I can't feel good about recommending this place to anyone."
Peter H.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,13,4,3.0,7/3/2017,"Disappointed!! I live in LA but from Iowa originally and have been to plenty of Cheesecake Restaurants. Our waitress seemed tired. I ordered a glass of wine, only for it to show up with finger prints and lip marks on the glass. I mentioned it and she just walked away. I had to take the glass up to the bar myself and have it replaced. Then told her later and she didn't seem concerned. Just I'm sorry. Then she took our food away to box it up while my daughter was still eating. Not the usual for this restaurant."
Jon W.,"West Des Moines, IA",22,240,696,4.0,2/19/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times and it's usually pretty good.  There will most likely be a wait if you go between 6-8pm, so plan accordingly.  The menu is huge so it should satisfy all your cravings.  From American food to Chinese to Italian to Mexican.  It's a smorgasbord of culinary delight!  The food won't blow your mind, but it will fill you up and you'll probably finish it the next day cause the portions are ginormous!  The staff is friendly and the food comes out pretty quick. The best part is that they have a ton of cheesecake flavors, so save some room for dessert :)"
Kaitlyn R.,"West Des Moines, IA",10,44,9,4.0,11/12/2016,"Okay let me just say, if you have never tried The Cheesecake Factory, you are missing out! Even though it is a chain, I still really enjoy it for the variety on the menu, the upscale dining experience and of course the cheesecake! It is a HUGE restaurant so if they look busy, their wait probably still isn't very long. I really recommend anything on the menu as it all tastes really fresh, my favorite is the Chicken Bellagio, it is two huge chicken planks on a bed of pesto spaghetti yum!! On top of that you get a basket of bread and of course you can't leave without trying some cheesecake! Portions are huge, food is great, service is good sometimes but the food and atmosphere does make up for the service!"
Jimmy A.,"Washington, DC",307,88,434,4.0,3/5/2016,Choose your cheesecake slice of adventure! Food (4 Stars) - Typical CC food Ambiance (4 Stars) - located at the end of the mall near food court so minimal things to do while you wait. Service (4 Stars) - courteous  Jimmy's Hacks - park near Barnes & Noble that stays open later than mall Note... reviews maybe updated after future visits. If you find any of my hacks or reviews helpful pls follow & like my review for more. Thx -----
Drew N.,"Orange City, IA",0,4,,2.0,10/7/2016,"Overall, the food was good. We ordered the mac and cheese cheeseburger, and I was a BIG fan of the cheese sauce they put in the burger. Much better than a slice of American cheese in my mind. Before that, we ordered the tator tot bite things as our appetizer. I know the texture is supposed to be mushy, but the mushy combined with the crispy fried idea clashed a little. The bread was very good, but inconsistent with its temperature. We got one piece of warm, soft bread and three or four pieces of cold, hard bread. I would have loved some more warm and soft bread, with spreadable butter, not frozen butter! Similar to the food, the drinks were tasty. I got a whiskey sour, and OH BOY! It was overly sour, but I think it was mixed by a newbie, so that's ok. The drinks were INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED! I should never have to pay $22.00 for two drinks at a restaurant. That was ridiculous. We also passed on the actual cheesecake as well, because of their outrageous price per slice. $7 for a slice of cheesecake??!! Very disappointed with their menu prices. If you are going to pride yourself on serving delicious cheesecake, then make it reasonable for people to purchase it."
Dipti S.,"West Des Moines, IA",0,23,,5.0,9/11/2017,"There are numerous choices on be menu. Too many, in fact. The ambience is nice and the derive professional. The servings are massive. They exceeded our expectations for sure. Food was great, service was very nice and friendly. They never disappoint!"
Angelika K.,"Winterset, IA",17,10,2,4.0,11/4/2016,"I really enjoyed my dinner tonight. The Cheesecake factory has an amazing variety of food, even for vegetarians/vegans! The chardonnay was wonderful and we were seated out on the patio with the heated lamps. The ambiance was lovely. The menu items are a bit pricey (98.00 for 3 people) and the inside of the restaurant had an odd odor when we first walked in, but other than that, dinner here was a great experience. I do recommend it!"
Morgan S.,"West Des Moines, IA",0,1,,2.0,9/18/2017,"The past few times I have eaten at this location the service was lacking. On my most recent trip our server forgot to bring bread out, which was fine, but then almost all of our meals were messed up in some way and this has not been the first time. When we asked to see a cheesecake menu our server brought us one menu for four people to share. The cheesecake was amazing but that's hard to mess up when all you have to do is thaw it. Will not be returning for a long time."
Jennifer G.,"Des Moines, IA",121,201,880,4.0,1/24/2016,"Mmm! I came in around 5 and there was plenty of seating in the bar area so I bellied up and ordered a Whiskey Smash. I would order it again... And again. I was tempted by the bourbon and honey as well as the old fashioned but what sold me in the whiskey smash was the passion fruit. No disappointment here. I ordered a side greek salad and the blue cheese and pear flatbread. This was a delicious, light choice. I did indulge in the red sangria for dessert. I saw the bartender make it... It was 95% soda... Umm no. If I'm paying $10 for a drink, I want most of it to be booze. Not a big deal, I just won't get it next time. My bill total was $36. More than I was trying to spend but.. It was yummy and I always appreciate the pretty decor and fancy feast ambiance when I come in here. This is a great pit stop before catching a flick at the movie theater."
Bizie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,40,69,1.0,3/18/2017,"Ordered Shrimp and chicken gumbo.  No shrimp came with it. Had to wait 15mins for shrimp to be added. Family had to wait with me. Food got cold. Manager was inconsiderate, even asked ""oh,did you want shrimp with it?""had to tell her it was unacceptable. And wanted to be compensated. Bad service! Sux! Ruined and wasted a good evening."
Brian W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",1372,184,1537,1.0,10/12/2014,I was super excited to dine at CheesecakeFactory as I have not been in almost a year but this location left me never wanting to go again.  1.They tried to see us in the bar area and we said no- we asked to be seated in a booth- with hesitation they seated to the other side of the restaurant.    2.The silverware was dirty- I ignored that. 3.We waited for a good 10 minutes to order- after we were ready.  My dates salad was brown- I started to eat and we waited and waited to complain- but by the time they came around I was almost done with my mediocre  chicken enchiladas.  Are the glasses now always plastic here?  More soon-
Tasha C.,"West Des Moines, IA",0,7,30,5.0,10/16/2016,"I've eaten here several times. I love their brown baguettes served when you're seated. The menu is huge, so look at one ahead of time to narrow your choices. The portobello, avocado, and zucchini fries are very yummy, especially when paired with the dipping sauces. The fish tacos are one of the best things I've ordered here. The pasta dishes are always huge servings and well prepared, one of my favorites being the Louisiana chicken pasta. The atmosphere reminds me of an Italian palace, and the service tonight (and every time I've gone) was very prompt. Our waitress was definitely attentive. I'm not a huge fan of lemon flavored things, but the lemoncello cream torte is VERY good. They also have a great classic cherry cheesecake."
Ashley B.,"Des Moines, IA",46,50,43,5.0,8/14/2016,My husband and I find ourselves here almost every Saturday because it's right by the J-Creek Theater and their food and service never disappoint. I love that they have the light menu that has food beyond just salads. I love the shrimp tacos and my husband (who normally prides himself on trying something new) always goes with the Cuban. Chain or not it's just so good!
Tom C.,"Charlotte, NC",0,77,,5.0,7/23/2016,"Impressive! As a rule, I shy away from chain restaurants when possible.  There wasn't much else in the immediate area, so this was Hopson's choice.   I confess that everything from the time we entered until we left that there was nothing that I could fault.  Hostess was politely perky, took us straight away to a table (5 of us).  Waitperson was there in an instant, took drink orders, talked about a special or two, was back with drinks.  Food came quickly, cross service was definitely in play, as 3 waitpeople brought our entrees one after the next, our waitperson checked back after the first few bites.  Drink reorders were taken and delivered.   My entree was as close to perfect as I could have asked--salmon was done exactly right, crispy hot on the outside, hot and juicy inside.  The steamed broccoli might have been a little over salted, but was hot and tasty.  And the mashed potatoes were too good to resist.  Other entrees at the table also got rave reviews--chicken marsala looked awesome, fettucini alfredo was a generous creamy portion. Highly recommended."
Emily T.,"Newton, IA",11,130,44,4.0,5/3/2015,"This is one of the few chain restaurants that my husband and I enjoy.  He always gets the same dish, chicken bellagio, which is delish, and I like to sample the menu.  They have a few fab items (most small plates, french country salad), some good ones (jamaican shrimp dish) and eh, I've had better (glamburger and lettuce wraps). Just a couple examples of what I have tried over the years.  The larger menu items are enough to feed two or have leftovers to bring to lunch the next day and make your coworkers jelaous. Along with the menu items, we have both tried a variety of their cheesecakes.   This is the hardest part, which one to get each time.  My husband's fave is no longer offered, coconut cream pie cheesecake, but we are both chocolate fans and there are a few to choose from under that category. Godiva and s' mores may be my two faves. You would think with such a large offering of items that the quality would suffer, but generally speaking we have enjoyed our experience.  The one down side is probably it's popularity and long wait times, but well worth it as long as you don't get hangry."
Sam J.,"Spirit Lake, IA",0,28,,4.0,1/27/2017,It never disappointed! The menu is huge! We can always try something different. I love their pasta dishes. And there's always enough for me to bring back some for my next meal.  Cheesecake: vanilla bean is my favorite.
Steve G.,"Waukee, IA",4,73,16,3.0,6/4/2016,"My family and I have eaten here on a number of occasions. I never have been super impressed with the food. The breakfast is better then the dinner menu and you can get some of the breakfast menu all day. I have never had bad service on any of my visits, but the last trip was well below average. My soup was cold and the sauce my wife requested be left off her sandwich was piled on. Also we ran out of butter and after two ""I'll bring you some more butter"" we never saw any.  Over priced for what you get."
Dora H.,"Des Moines, IA",55,24,3,4.0,12/24/2016,"I love there extensive menu. You can anything at any time. It is an anchor to a mall so parking can be a pain if the mall is busy. The food is always good and consistent. The cheesecake... oh the cheesecake.... and did I mention the cheesecake? Red velvet is my favorite. Pumpkin a close second. The slices are huge, the decadent factor 11 out of 10."
J G.,"Robins, IA",0,3,2,5.0,6/9/2017,Oh my is this place good.  Beautiful restaurant and Derek was a professional quality server.
Emma H.,"West Des Moines, IA",0,4,,3.0,12/26/2016,Yummy food. And usually is good but... I have had several mishaps. One time my mom found a razor blade in her pasta and almost swallowed it. And one time me and my sister had clumpy bits of pasta in our dish. Besides that food is very good.
