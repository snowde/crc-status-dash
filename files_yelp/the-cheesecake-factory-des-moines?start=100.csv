Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,5.0,7/1/2011,"We visited this location Tuesday June 7th 2011.  We were down on a business trip to World Pork Expo and were looking forward to this location.  Our closest Cheesecake Factory location is Buffalo New York, that location is tiny compare to this one.  We were happy to get in with no wait! I enjoyed the Southern Chicken Sliders, with the great tangy ice team and Cheesecake for Dessert.  Service was quick, and the food was perfect."
A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",845,1249,8,3.0,12/29/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a great chain, and this is the only location in Iowa, I believe.  It's nice that this is part of the mall - it makes for a good place to take a shopping break.  Service was pretty sloooow during our recent trip, however.  We were there during the post-Christmas shopping rush, so I'll give them a break for taking awhile to get us seated.  But even once we got seated, it still took quite a long time to get bread, drinks, our order placed, etesc.    Prices at this location seem to be very similar to or exactly the same as prices in California and the East Coast, which makes this quite an expensive dining option for Iowa, where meal prices are typically quite a bit lower.   Keep in mind however, that most meals are 2000+ calories, not even counting their delicious bread + french fries, so you should be sharing them or bringing half home, which makes it a much better deal."
V S.,"San Diego, CA",9,69,62,3.0,7/25/2011,"the place is really clean, the waitress was tooo over bearing on the appetizer menu, and her way about presenting the menu and specials was far from genuine. the cheesecake is very expensive, and the portions were pretty small. we did enjoy the patio, thats why i gave them 3 stars instead of 2. not horrible, but really far from great."
