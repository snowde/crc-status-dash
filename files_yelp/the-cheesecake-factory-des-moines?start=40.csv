Nick R.,"Urbandale, IA",2,44,,5.0,10/14/2016,"I know it's a big chain and people like to hate big chains. It is a little on the expensive side, particularly the drinks. But I really like it. I do! And I'm not ashamed to admit it. Time and time again they have been super consistent for me in both food quality and service. I love the decor and I could stare up at the ceiling for hours. I prefer booth seating and they have plenty available. There is an outdoor section where you lose the classy architecture but gain a view of the parking lot. Not the biggest fan of that. The menu is HUGE and very tasty. My favorite item here is the Romano encrusted chicken with pasta. All of the cheesecakes here are fresh and fabulous and you must try them all. The cocktails are incredibly good. I love the semi classy vibe and the atmosphere. This is a repeat on my playlist a few times a year. Read about the history of the chain in the menu. I thought it was somewhat entertaining. By coincidence I happened to have been to the store in Beverly Hills, their first chain location."
Patrick H.,"Urbandale, IA",43,45,85,5.0,12/18/2016,Great place to eat be here before always have good food. On the menu& Drinks to.the waiter staff is great
Ashley M.,"Des Moines, IA",120,59,166,3.0,2/14/2015,"I mean, its a chain restaurant. But not bad for a chain! Came here at 11:01 on a Saturday and there was already a line to get seated. They have smaller portions of their pastas for a cheaper price for lunch, and about 15 pages of food you can choose from. Food is average, but the cheesecake is to die for! I'd go again, but not a place I would frequent more than once every 8 months or so. I think there are better, more authentic places in Des Moines to go to for the price."
Jo-Jo B.,"Pella, IA",6,25,172,3.0,9/26/2015,Noisy background! The music is too loud and horrible! You hardly cant hear your conversation with your friends! I requested the front desk lady to turn it down. But they never did! Ambiance of the entire resto is too noisy. Not good if you are wanting to have a calm and peaceful dinner. Food is very good! We ordered penne pasta meal. And I strongly would recommend their Shepards's meal. Their serving sizes is huge! One order can be eaten by 3-4. We order these two dishes and just requested for 3 plates. The server is very good and helpful too. Meals were served probably 8-12 mins time frame. Their mango lime cheesecake is ok. Almost to perfection but they put coconut stuff as based layer of the cheesecake. It doesn't taste seem right. Blerk.
Bill L.,"Ankeny, IA",215,690,899,5.0,2/28/2014,"*Duplicate Review* There is another page already for this restaurant.  I've been to Cheesecake Factories in different states and my experience here is similar to the other ones. They have a nice atmosphere with beautiful decor. It is a great place for a casual date. Their food is good, but nothing I would say that stands out from the crowd. Their cheesecakes are obviously amazing, sometimes I would just come to order cheesecakes to go.  This location is always busy when I go, but we managed to wait it out. The staff is very friendly here. It is slightly pricey here, but is worth the eating experience here."
Jewel P.,"Des Moines, IA",104,178,287,5.0,12/24/2015,"So many options, entrees or cheesecake! I love the variety of the menu, but I usually just order flatbread and their sweet potato fries with amazing ranch on the side.  While I keep it simple, the menu does offer anything from Italian, Mexican or asian. Just depends on what you are in the mood to eat! The cheesecake of choose is a must, I usually order the smores one because its amazing!!"
Jessica R.,"Waukee, IA",77,94,207,4.0,6/30/2016,"I love this place.  I don't even like cheesecake but I've never had a bad meal here.  The bbq chicken salad is to die for (I get regular ranch, not the bbq ranch) and their alfredo pasta dishes are great.  The caprese salad is very refreshing and the teriyaki steak is good (albeit a little sweet for my taste)."
Eric L.,"Dubuque, IA",52,65,51,4.0,1/16/2016,"Hard not find something for about anyone with such a big menu but very limited with kids options. Tried the fish tacos this time and they were very good and just the right amount. Potions here are usually way too large for one person. Which is great if you like leftovers. This makes it difficult if you try and save room for cheesecake. Service is always very friendly.  One draw back is the wait can be long. Thus, not a place for a ""quick bite""."
Dianath R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,,1.0,6/26/2016,Got my salad wrong and had to be replaced My wife's burger was undercooked and had to be redone Waited forever for them to fix it Received the check with no apology.  Won't be back.
Timothy S.,"Ankeny, IA",145,14,,5.0,7/4/2015,"Always something new to try! Three of us stopped in for appetizers, drinks, and cheesecake. I had the best pineapple mojito that had so much flavor in one drink that made my taste buds dance with joy. For my appetizer, I went with the southern fried chicken sliders that were an interactive dish.  I found it very fun to try different combos of sauce, pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce on top of the 4 sliders that came with the order.  It left just enough room to enjoy a slice of cheesecake. I ordered the raspberry lemon cheesecake that tasted like a slice of summer.  The best part of the cheesecake was the raspberry soaked ladyfinger crust with delicate layers of lemon cheesecake with a fresh raspberry drizzle that just added the right amount of tartness to the whole dessert"
Simone F.,"Coralville, IA",166,9,32,5.0,7/4/2014,"I love this place, LOVE IT. The atmosphere is so... I can't think of another word... Fancy! It's easy to forget that it's connected to a shopping mall. My main advice is to there HUNGRY because the portions are absolutely insane.  When my mom and I go to Jordan Creek for a shopping day (usually an annual occasion) the Cheesecake Factory is the only restaurant we even consider anymore. (In the past, we have given PF Changs a chance, and the Italian place that I can't even remember the name of, but these always leave us with an emptiness that only CF can fill.) As for the food itself, there are great options, but keep in mind this is not a ""light"" choice. Even the salads are ginormous! But overall you really can't go wrong. I LOVE the ahi tuna salad! It was delicious but didn't leave me ""sick to my stomach"" full. Honestly, that's the cheesecakes job. Ah the cheesecake. Seriously, even if you eat lunch somewhere else (shame on you) I highly reccomend that you stop here for dessert. I DONT EVEN REALLY LIKE CHEESECAKE. But this, this is a whole new level. There are so many flavors to choose from, you really can never go wrong! It is also great to share since they are so rich. My mom and I always struggle to finish a slice together, it takes teamwork for sure! I love the raspberry chocolate mousse, but there is always another on the menu that is on my list to try next! Overall, if you are looking for an upscale dining experience with great food all around and something for everyone, Cheesecake Factory won't disappoint!"
Anne V.,"Cassville, WI",0,5,,3.0,8/6/2016,"Had an okay experience, food was good, but I'm 99.9% sure my waiter was wasted or hungover, also, asked a question about something and he just assumed I wanted it."
Bryant L.,"West Des Moines, IA",0,9,3,5.0,3/26/2016,We love the Cheesecake Factory! Have never left disappointed no matter what we order.  My wife and I often get the combination plate to share because the portion size is more than enough for both of us!  We especially love the Adamst peanut butter cheesecake. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
Ross B.,"West Des Moines, IA",19,12,16,4.0,11/26/2015,"Their stakes are good. Their cheesecake is amazing. It's a good place for a date, but don't bring a whole lot if yourself is paying. Lol. Their drinks is expensiveeeeee. If getting drunk is a goal, go to a bar or spend a lot of money here. Service is good and very attentive. It meets my expectation.  Their location is at jordan creek mall, and its easy to find!"
Mynameis H.,"Toledo, IA",0,3,,5.0,11/17/2015,"My absolute favorite place to eat.  Extensive menu.  I have tried many things and every single one of them were delicious.  The cheesecake is phenomenal, also! Fast service.  The waiters check on their guests timely.  Perfect atmosphere for a first date, wedding anniversary, bday, etc. However, if you are tying to watch your figure this is not the place to be as the food is jam packed with calories.  But, it's expected as the portions are large and the food has so much flavor."
Rhiannon S.,"Waukee, IA",9,86,35,4.0,7/26/2015,The food was great. I went there for my birthday and they sent out banana cheesecake that said happy birthday to you.  For appetizers we got amazing buffalo wings. I had a burger with fries. My friends had a steak and chicken. The portions are very large so the price is worth it.  My mom and brother sat at another table and apparently my brothers burger didn't get there till 40 minutes later and they say them at a table that didn't have a waitress assigned to it. That was the only bad part.  The service was amazing and so was the place.
Joy B.,"West Des Moines, IA",60,33,,1.0,12/1/2015,"Always a ""25 minute"" wait.  The hostesses act like they are doing you a favor by acknowledging your existence.  I think not.  Go elsewhere."
Zane V.,"Des Moines, IA",16,1,7,2.0,8/13/2015,"The lettuce was not fresh there were many pieces with brown spots on them. The ends of the lettuce were black. I would have expected some tomato and  cucumber in the salad, but none were to be seen.  The hamburger which I ordered medium, was very pink (red?) inside I would have classified the meat as medium rare. I was surprised to see shredded lettuce as well as shredded cabbage on the hamburger. The hamburger was very runny and messy to eat.  The fries were excellent and hot! We didn't order a desert and I was dismayed to learn that the only diet beverage served was a diet coke."
Darleen N.,"Des Moines, IA",4,7,13,5.0,3/23/2015,Although it can be a bit noisy and not have the best lighting it's a great place with great food. Can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory.
Cara H.,"Overland Park, KS",0,5,,2.0,4/23/2016,"Was visiting from out of town and was very disappointed with competence of staff and service. Waited for over 45 minutes while several people who arrived after us were sat before us. Honestly, this Cheesecake Factory was despicable in comparison to the one in Overland Park."
