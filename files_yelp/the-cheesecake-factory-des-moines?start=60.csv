Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,3.0,10/1/2014,"We arrived for Sunday brunch and opted to sit outside in the patio area. Unfortunately service was slow. When our food arrived, the dishes were delivered separately and not together.  Out of the three of us, only two of us received our orders. We had to wait 15 minutes for the last dish to arrive.  Our server was not very attentive and barely checked on us after we all got our food. He didnt seem at all apologetic that we had to wait so long for the last dish of our table to arrive. This place is getting 3 stars because the seating was comfortable and the food was good."
Bonnie M.,"Washington, DC",0,21,2,1.0,7/25/2015,"Harrlie, you need to lose the bad attitude and learn what good customer service is. Normally, I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory restaurants around the U.S. and take visitors there because everyone can find something they like on the restaurant's extensive menu, but Harrlie ruined my last visit and hurt the restaurant's image. During a trip back to DSM, I stopped in to pick up a couple pieces of cheesecake and chocolate sauce to go after shopping at Jordan Creek Mall.  Before I could even get the second flavor of cheesecake out of my mouth, Harrlie said, ""Is that all?""   Me:  Yes, did you get the second one. Harrlie:  Yea, is that all? (Again, on the heels of what I was saying.) Me:  And, I'd like a small container of chocolate sauce. Harrlie: Is that all? (Once more, cutting me off.) Me:  Yes. Ok, so this might sound standard, but the way she spoke to me was condescending and hurried, as if she had better things to do and I was getting in her way. After I had received the cheesecake and was walking to my car in the 90-something degree heat, I noticed that Harrlie had forgotten the chocolate sauce.  I went back inside to get it and she made me wait until she helped the 5 people in front of me to ask me what else I wanted - again, as if she had better things to do than to take my order. People in Iowa are thought to be exceptionally nice and friendly, but not that gal.  I have never had such a sour experience at any of The Cheesecake Factory's around the U.S., the last being in Miami just a week ago.  They were slammed with guests, but no one showed their stress and, certainly, not a single person snapped at me or anyone in our group. Harrlie, be thankful that I did not complain about you directly to the manager.  No, I wanted a much larger audience."
Kelsey A.,"Sioux City, IA",0,6,,4.0,2/28/2016,"Great food! I got the baja chicken tacos and the chocolate truffle cake for dessert. Huge servings, but it is a pretty pricey. For three people (including dessert) our bill was $75. For a nice treat, it was worth it. Our waitress was very nice, helpful, and attentive. I took off one star because of the 40 minute wait. It is a very large restaurant and it was 1:30 p.m. in the afternoon, but it was still a 40 minute wait. Once we got to a table (finally) the food came very quickly. Overall, a pretty good experience."
Sherry B.,"West Des Moines, IA",1,15,2,4.0,4/13/2015,"This is one of our favorite places to go in the area. The food and service are generally very good. They have good selections for lower calorie meals as well. This is a great place to go for a nice evening out, or a relaxing lunch or dinner on the patio. And of course there are the desserts, which don't consist of only cheesecake. Their strawberry shortcake is amazing, and one of my personal favorites is a simple bowl of strawberries and whipped cream. The negatives: Avoid the table/booth combo seating if you are on a date or want any kind of privacy. The drinks aren't very good so don't waste your money.  I don't care for their coffee. They are a little more expensive than some of the other places in the area. The menu is huge and overwhelming, so if you haven't been there before be prepared to spend a little time looking."
Erica A.,"Old Hickory, TN",45,121,,1.0,4/23/2013,"Absolutely awful experience for a Cheesecake Factory!  First of all, the waitstaff was rushing around so fast, we had to dodge them to take our seat.  Later, our waiter bad-mouthed a busser to us and then we saw a manager scream at a worker right by our table. BUT, the worst was our food.  :-(  My Mom and I ordered Cobb salads on a recommendation of a friend and they were just a huge pile of lettuce.  There was less than an ounce of greasy chicken, a tiny amount of bacon and tasteless cheese and tons of tasteless shredded eggs.  Overall, the salad had no taste and cost $15!"
Karrissa A.,"West Des Moines, IA",186,64,44,5.0,10/8/2014,"You really can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge, but everything that I've had so far has been  cooked to perfection. My boyfriend and I like to go almost every Friday night after the gym. We have to get our items specially ordered without butter, lower carbs, etc. and the staff is always willing and happy to accommodate our needs. Over the course of my visits I've had the skinnylicious tacos (both chicken and shrimp; I prefer the chicken), baja chicken tacos (which are amazing especially with their black beans), hibachi steak, kids Mac & cheese (pretty incredible) and my favorite dessert: Linda's fudge cake. You cannot go wrong with Linda's fudge cake. It is rich, succulent, the best tastebud party your mouth will ever experience....I'm sure of it!"
Abdelaziz E.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,15,3,5.0,7/31/2015,The restaurant is fancy. The food is delicious and very big portions. The prices are very reasonable. The service is good. I enjoyed it multiple times and certainly would go again with my family or friends
Marvic R.,"Daly City, CA",16,62,80,1.0,12/3/2015,"I just wanted to say I used to love this place when I first came to Iowa and that change after going to some of hidden gem of Des Moines. Few times that we came here, there was always a long wait which we thought that it might be a good thing. Few more visit, it was just plain horrible and one time we just decided to just leave and go somewhere else. One time we came here for one of my friend's birthday since there were more than 6 in our group, we tried to see if we can make the reservation but no luck. The most recent visit was a few weeks ago since we were all craving for cake, we came here to get some Craigs carrot cake, Red Velvet cake, or whatever they have really. There was no line at the take-out area. We have told the guy what we wanted to get and to our surprise it took them 20 minutes to put a cake in a box. Yes, it was 20mins and we not even exaggerating. When we ask how long will it take we always get ""in a bit"".  That was 20 minute for something that I was looking at through refrigerated pastry case. My daughter asked to go to the bathroom and came back, still no cake. When I was about to leave the lady called out my name, paid for it and left. It was just horrible. To be fair, we did like their Louisianna Chicken, though they put way too much sauce. We came home and ate the cake. It was not the same carrot cake that I like. I don't remember it being too moist or tasting so differently. The cake was not fluffy as well. Same as with the red velvet. We just  threw it away coz it tasted nasty. I mean Village Inn would probably be better just get something from the grocery. Yeah, I don't see us coming back here anytime soon. Bring some flashlight to see your food as well. I know cozy or romantic ambience, but this place is saving way too much"
Sally J.,"Des Moines, IA",0,29,,1.0,3/20/2015,"Prior to Monday, I had lukewarm experiences at The Cheesecake Factory the very few times I visited. On Monday, I picked up a piece of cheesecake to celebrate a job promotion.  The first forkful had one short white hair in it, like the kind you would find on a cat or a rat. I pulled it out, and didn't think much more about it. Two forkfuls later I found three more of these hairs! Ick! So at that point, I torn the piece apart and found many more of these cat/rat hairs!!! I emailed The Cheesecake Factory to voice my concern. I then got very, very sick... at work. I have yet to hear from The Cheesecake factory. It is obvious, by their lack of response, that they do not care about quality or their customer. Thanks, but no thanks. I won't be back."
Lim K.,"San Diego, CA",0,374,177,5.0,7/19/2014,"My husband and I have been dining at CF every Sunday after church, unless we are out of town, for the past two years.  However; I have never thought of writing a review until now.   Before we became a regular customers we have eaten there several times.  Each time we had a different server but they were all excellent.  Then one day we decided to sit at the same place every week and our server Rachel took very good care of us until recently she left to take a job closer to her house.   Out new server is Chad and he gives us excellent service every Sunday morning... always with a big smile.  My favorite food at CF is Asian lettuce wrap and I love the warm dark bread.   My husband orders different dish each week.  Every dish we ordered has been pretty good so far, including hamburger, turkey burger, Moroccan chicken, taco salad, fried zucchini sticks, hummus dip, omelette, sweet potato fries, etc.  This is one of the few restaurants in town we really enjoy."
Mark G.,"Iowa City, IA",507,1037,646,4.0,1/27/2014,"100 page menu and delicious food. Ill give it 4 stars. They have everything under the sun here, I would love to see the kitchen in action. The menu is like a college text book, I love it though. Dive in a few chapters here over time to try their menu. They do a great job all around, the cheesecake is good as well."
Patrick T.,"Des Moines, IA",1668,1246,4839,3.0,12/3/2013,"I had my first ever lunch at The Cheesecake Factory and I was actually quite impressed with the Veggie Burger! It was mostly made with beets which was different and pretty good!  The bun the burger left a little to be desired but not horrible!  I also dug the side salad and presentation of the food.  Service was good too, I would go back again."
Samantha K.,"Saint Louis, MO",36,31,33,4.0,5/29/2014,I stop here every time I'm in West Des Moines for work. Love it! A little pricey-but the amount of food makes it worth it.
Erik Y.,"Lincoln, NE",93,251,307,3.0,1/9/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is excellent but I have a few issues with this location.  First, its small for Cheesecake Factory standards.  The one in Omaha is bigger, and the one in Kansas City is more then double this location size.  This would not be a problem if it wasn't so busy all the time.   That said, the food is good and everything is consistent with every other Cheesecake Factory around the country I have eaten out.  Typical Lunch + Drink will cost you at least $15 a person on average.  Add another $8 if you add a cheesecake so its not exactly a cheap place for Lunch, and even more for dinner.  They do have a huge menu with a lot of good options.  Most of the items are carb heavy though, so if your on a low carb diet you have to hunt a little for something.  The portions are huge.  Its not uncommon for my wife and I to split 1 appetizer and 1 entrée and be full by the end of Dinner. And now for the cheesecakes.  Yes I have tried nearly every flavor at one point or another over the last 20+ years visiting a cheesecake factory someplace in the country.  In fact I visited my first one in Newport Beach, CA back in 1990.  I'm not even sure if its still there!  But, over the years I have developed a taste for a few of them, and can rank them in what I believe is their worst, to their best.  Here we go: 32. Low Carb Cheesecake with Strawberries  - Yuck 31. White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut  - Not a fan of white chocolate with caramel. 30. Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake  Coffee in dessert is not my thing.  Yuck. 29. Tiramisu  I'll stick with the original, and I don't really like coffee in my desserts. 28. Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake  Not very good 27. The Original  Boring 26. Chocolate Mousse  Not a fan of mousse. I want a better chocolate. 25. White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  This one is ok, but again, not a fan of white chocolate 24. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple  Not bad, but they have better 23. The Original with Cherry Preserves  The original is good, and cherry makes it a little better 22. Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake  I like carrot cake, but this one is a miss 21. Key Lime  I like it, but it's a weee bit tart 20. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake  Getting better on the chocolate front but they have better 19. Mango Key Lime  This is a good option for tart and sweet. 18. Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake  This is a good one, worth trying. 17. Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake  Reminds me of banana cream pie, but better 16. Pina Colada Cake  Different take. I feel like I'm in the islands 15. Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake  Love me a turtle in any way. This is a good option 14. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake  For something so simple, it works.  Tastes like rich vanilla ice cream. 13. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel  Apple Pie Cheesecake.  It is good 12. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake  This is the only white chocolate cheesecake I actually like 11. Chocolate Tuxedo Cream  Vanilla and Chocolate twist.  Very good 10. Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore  This is one of my favorites.  Worth getting for sure. 9. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake  If you want chocolate, this one is great, but almost TOO much chocolate. it's fairly dark chocolate. 8. The Original with Fresh Strawberries  A classic, and very very good. 7. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake.  The best peanut butter cake I have had in some time.  Great if you don't want a cheesecake 6. 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake  Probably the best chocolate item they have.  perfect flavors 5. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough  I am so partial to chocolate chip cookie dough anything, and this cheesecake is excellent. 4. OREO Dream Extreme  If you like Oreo's, you will love this cheesecake.  I do. 3. Lemon Raspberry Cream  When you are sick of chocolate, this sweet and tart cheesecake is perfect.  My favorite fruit cheesecake they have.  2. Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake  This is also probably the best chocolate item they have. Honestly, this and the 30th aniv chocolate cake are both fantastic, but this one is readily available everywhere. 1. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake  This is the best of the best.  German Chocolate, coconut, pecan frosting, omg, this thing is the bomb."
Hunter B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/17/2015,"Wow!! Talk about outstanding service. I have never been to a restaurant in Iowa that was more accommodating than this one. Angela the manager got my large party seated immediately and went above and beyond to serve us any way possible. As for my server KEELI. She deserves some sort of award. This server was so calm the whole time, split ten separate checks all for us without batting an eye. She was so sweet. Angela and Keeli represented Cheesecake Factory well. I will come here every time I'm in Iowa simply because of the experience I had there tonight for dinner. It was truly a signature moment that makes Cheesecake Factory stand out as a great establishment"
Denise C.,"Holly Springs, NC",59,19,40,4.0,2/23/2014,The portions are huge!   I ordered the lunch size soup and salad and couldn't believe how  large and filling the portion was.   The servers were very attentive to our large group.   We ordered several varieties of the cheesecake and all were fantastic.
Marilyn R.,"Des Moines, IA",18,70,217,3.0,4/17/2015,I was very pleased with the Skinnylicious Chicken Enchiladas and the accompanying salad.  All of the food was flavorful and looked just like it was pictured in the menu.   It is great that the Cheesecake Factory has lower calorie options available for people who are watching their weight and want to enjoy an evening out with friends.  Our waiter was very nice and the service was good.
Gerald Z.,"Ankeny, IA",16,173,348,2.0,10/15/2013,"its good, just over priced for what it is.  Brought my daughter here on date night, the burgers are great and so is the steak.  It's a chain restaurant with decent food, maybe two steps above applebees at 4 or 5 times the price.  Meh...."
Mark O.,"Coralville, IA",73,339,356,3.0,11/30/2014,"First time here, went with my usual two dining companions.  The interior decor is very classy and it makes you forget that you're at a chain restaurant.   We stopped in at 6 PM on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately;  curious for a busy area at a mall during the Christmas shopping season.   Our server promptly brought us water and a couple miniature loaves of bread.   Bread was good but the butter provided was frozen.   I ordered the chicken di pana.  This particular dish came sided with mashed potatoes and broccoli.   I didn't ask if sides could be substituted but the menu didn't give the impression that doing so was an option.  The chicken came exactly as described but there was only a minimal amount of the sauce.  Food was plated nicely but seemed to be overpriced.   I ordered key lime cheesecake which was covered in whipped cream.  Total was $23.  Not outrageous but also have had better meals at this price point.  The server we had was very patient when we were contemplating our decisions.   She was also efficient refilling waters and clearing the table.  Wouldn't object if friends wanted to go here again but it wouldn't be something I'd nominate."
Lorraine N.,"Minneapolis, MN",398,1570,1066,4.0,2/8/2013,The husband and I met up with an old friend and his SO here and had just a lovely time.  We all enjoyed our meal and the portions were huge.  They have a very large and expansive menu so it is a great place and I am sure you can find something to please just about anyone.  The quality of the food is great and service was awesome.  Of course I indulged in Cheesecake--I purchased a couple pieces to take with --peanut butter chocolate and raspberry white chocolate....yeah baby...
