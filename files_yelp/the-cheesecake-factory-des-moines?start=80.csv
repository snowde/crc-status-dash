Suzanne M.,"Key West, FL",0,16,,2.0,2/18/2016,"This was predictably mediocre. The service was fair. We had to get our waiters attention more than once. The staff were all aloof except for the kind busboy who showed me to the restroom!  Food was good but nothing really special. The menu is just way too big, like they are trying to be something for everyone.  This is a chain that does not really stand out."
Amber B.,"Middleton, WI",34,9,1,5.0,2/18/2015,Wonderful for a date or family event. Love their food and they have so many options to choose from. Great service at this location.
Amy P.,"Norwalk, IA",0,9,,5.0,2/12/2016,"Delicious food, great service, and friendly professional staff. I have never had a bad experience here and we are now going more often since there is now a kids menu and a menu with healthier options."
Cornel F.,"Wynnewood, PA",19,94,6,3.0,10/19/2013,Always good food here and the portions are huge. We always finish off with a piece of the eponymous dessert
Alexa K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,2,3.0,5/26/2015,"Went with friends Sunday 5-24-15 in the afternoon. Very noisy for only being 1/2 full. Our server was quite the jokester which was OK at first but then it was actually more arrogance. He had a smart comment for every issue or question. Brought me a drink $8.00 that was an inch from the top of a glass. Brought very little bread for 4 people and when we asked for more he never brought it and never said it was baking. 10 min later after still not bringing it, he was reminded again. His response was ""they are baking it fresh"" I said still? He then precedes to show us a phone pic of no bread on a tray in the kitchen. I thought that was rude as his snide comments were getting old. Then the food came and still no bread (15 min and still baking and ridiculous)  and it never came. Purposely not brought as any server who went to such an extreme to make a point that he even took a picture of an empty bread tray doesn't just forget. My cheesecake was the smallest slice I'd ever gotten at a Cheesecake Factory, it was a little luke warm and melting. Told him I wanted it in a to go container as I would take a couple bites first though. He had it all packed away in a sack so we had to dig them back out. So, Food taste 4**** Price 3 ***  Service 2** I deducted from his tip for arrogance and no bread. His loss. One more thing according to him, they have nothing for kids beside some food choices, no fun menu, crayons, nothing."
Rob P.,"Des Moines, IA",39,177,654,4.0,10/8/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a hit!  From their sandwiches and lighter fare, to the steaks and pasta, everything comes out wonderfully!  And of course, who can leave without a luscious piece of cheesecake?  I'm particularly enamored with the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, but the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan is another amazing choice.  The chocolates tend to be so rich you can only eat part of one piece at a setting. The staff tend to be nice and all smiles, though on our most recent visit they didn't hear or understand us well and the order didn't come right."
Tommy M.,"Vienna, VA",102,220,181,4.0,9/22/2012,"I recommend the Chicken Bellagio.  The chicken is flattened, baked breast meat with a crunchy crust, on a bed of pasta covered with a pesto sauce, and topped by a liberal covering of arugula.  A good mix of flavors and the preparation was excellent.  Had the buffalo wings as an appetizer - good but nothing out of the ordinary. The patio seating seems nice on a pleasant day, but be forewarned that there seems to be a horde of flies out there at this time of year. Wait service is par for Cheesecake - first rate."
Andrea B.,"Des Moines, IA",189,167,132,3.0,11/9/2012,Everyone says their portions are huge but I haven't found that to be true. Their menu itself is pages and pages long though. Still pretty expensive. The food is above average but not out of this world. The wait is usually ridiculous (to be expected w/ a popular restaurant). A decent place to go if you need to feel fancy or eat overpriced small pieces of cheesecake.
Kennedy P.,"Ankeny, IA",0,16,1,3.0,7/18/2015,"The cheesecake is delicious which is what really matters, the food on the other hand is overpriced for what it tastes like."
Jayden F.,"Lincoln, NE",143,4,2,4.0,3/18/2015,Pretty good food. The menu is so huge that it's tough to make a decision though!  Always a great atmosphere though
Jim V.,"West Des Moines, IA",1,9,1,2.0,9/7/2013,"Good service, mediocre food and high prices. They are slipping fast. I do not recommend until food service improves."
Jennifer P.,"Des Moines, IA",10,5,,3.0,12/14/2013,"You definitely don't want to come to the mall around Christmas - luckily we snagged a high top table in the bar within minutes of arrival, otherwise it was an hour wait for the dining area. The food is pretty average here - my pasta was slightly heavy on the garlic and I needed to add salt. But the cheesecake is always spot-on and I keep coming back so it must be good enough."
Meghan S.,"Milwaukee, WI",47,67,,5.0,3/6/2012,"A friend and I went on a Saturday and the wait was almost 90 minutes! We hung in there and finally got seated. Our waitress, Maci was awesome! She was personable and funny which added to our fantastic experience. I had a sandwich and she had pasta...both were extremely good. Though I recommend coming hungry because the portions are HUGE!!"
Avonni H.,"West Des Moines, IA",18,25,139,3.0,4/5/2011,"Cheesecake factory is a hit or miss game.  I frequent the establishment when I'm at the mall for lack of better choices and I consider it mid-range as far as quality of food and customer service.  On a good night the ambience, customer service and food are at least 4 stars I gave it 3 for the lack luster Vietnamese tacos I had on a recent visit.  The pickled cucumber slaw makes the entire dish.. The pulled pork was as rubbery as a deflated bicycle tire and even the most carnivorous homosapien would have rolled that flat tire back from whence it came!!! How dare u cheesecake factory?  I think the problem these days is that they just aren't as passionate about the food they put out.  Either way u slice it. It all boils down to one thing.  Cheesecake Factory is a crap shoot if u go there I hope you don't come up snake eyes."
Chris C.,"Allen, TX",11,58,3,3.0,8/25/2012,"Typical for a chain place, but it's open till 11pm.  The bar tender was helpful on what to do in Des Moines."
Donald Y.,"Norwalk, IA",12,255,13,4.0,1/18/2011,"If you're looking for huge portions then Cheesecake Factory is where to go.  Their menu is massive, they have over 40 different entree options to choose from.  I personally like the Thai Chicken Pasta which is a fettuccine based pasta tossed in a Thai peanut sauce and mixed with grilled chicken, green onion, carrots, peanuts, and bean sprouts.  And with a name like Cheesecake Factory, you have get a piece of cheesecake to follow the meal.  They have over 20 different varieties to choose from.  Personal favorites of mine are the Godiva cheesecake and the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake."
Jonathan D.,"Seattle, WA",6,6,,4.0,11/11/2010,"Great place for the hungry, this place has a huge menu. Highly recommend the miso salmon. The calamari appetizer is also great. Fairly good selection of wine and beer, mixed drinks good as well. The peach bellini is great too. As for cheesecake, it definitely lives up to its factory name, there are at least 25 varieties! Definitely four stars for this."
Nathan B.,"Churdan, IA",25,54,81,5.0,2/26/2010,"How can one say no to eating at The Cheesecake Factory?  That's right...nobody can!   This Cheesecake Factory is located in the beautifuly sculpted corner of Jordan Creek Town Center on the western edge of West Des Moines.  From the minute you walk in to the minute your satisfied stomach is full you will enjoy this restaurant! Let me say up front that this restaurant is not for the carb-consious or the weight watchers...this is splurge city, folks!  The Cheesecake Factory doesn't display their nutritional information for good reason...I bet my jaw would drop if I knew what my total calorie intake was for the evening...but who cares...it's worth it! Ever since the first time I visited this place, I wonder, ""WHY didn't I start eating here when they opened in 2004???""  The bread they serve is great, the Cheesecake is VERY rich, and the portions of food are monstrous!  It's great! The Cheesecake Factory is a great way to wind down from a day of shopping at the great Jordan Creek Town Center.  A nice piece of cheesecake with a cup of espresso is great!   When people are staying in town on business or for leisure, this restaurant is the one i recommend (even if it's a chain, it's THAT good) The Cheesecake Factory.   Keep doing what you do best, Cheesecake Factory!  I love you!"
Luc B.,"West Des Moines, IA",86,25,,3.0,1/17/2010,"I have had bunch of meals here, but it's hard to forget the time that I found a ""eyelash"" in my seared tuna takaki salad. My wife and I weren't so sure that it was an eyelash - but the manager insisted that he knows his bodily hair and it was indeed a eyelash. It left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended)  Other than that I have always had a blast and eaten some tasty food. I like the fish tacos and the kobe beef burger. not too shabby. Plan on spending a couple bucks. Also, it's hard to make a decision because the menu is huge."
Y M.,"Ankeny, IA",0,14,,5.0,9/2/2012,"I have been to this location for several times in the past year, usually for brunch with out of town visitors since I get cooked out all weekend, and the food has been outstanding. The wait-staff is very friendly, accommodating, and very professional. And obviously, the menu choices can satisfy just about anyone - I will definitely come back here again."
