Olivia M.,"Herndon, VA",0,13,215,4.0,11/30/2017,"My second visit to an outlet from the Cheesecake Factory chain and it was as good as the first except for the service again. Too many guests and not enough servers. Food and cheesecake however is the highlight of the visit every time. We ordered chicken samosa - sort of an Indian appetiser. Wheat flour , deep fried (triangle shaped) wrapped minced chicken mixed with spices. Filling was a bit dry. chicken burger - served with yummy French fries the burger was absolutely delicious and quite filling. Shrimp scampi - Succulent fresh juicy Prawns  cooked to perfection sautéed in lemon  and garlic butter  served with Angel  hair pasta  and asparagus  The Chef who invented this tantalising combination gets a big hug from me . Moreover this was from the skinilicious menu, only 590 calories  Dessert - Chocolate truffle cake  wow  this was so Chocolatey and delicious  a must have for all chocolate lovers  chocolate  Our server was warm and good with suggestions but since the restaurant was crowded he wasn't able to give us a lot of attention. Prices are a bit high. But food quality makes up for it. Waiting to visit my next Cheesecake Factory outlet to explore even more from the amazing dishes on the menu."
Billy L.,"Falls Church, VA",19,36,12,1.0,12/19/2017,"I've been here a few times a while back & never had any issues. Recently though, I went with my wife & son and the service was a disaster. After being seated & waiting for about 10 minutes with NO ONE greeting us despite multiple servers walking by, so I took it upon myself to go to the bar to get everyone drinks. Finally, our sever comes over. I've worked in restaurants/bars for over a decade & I know that things happen, so I'm expecting an apology and/or explanation as to why we had to wait so long & run our own drinks. Nope. A quick, listless hello & ""Are you ready to order?"" was our greeting. Alrighty, then. We order, have to ask a DIFFERENT server for some bread since our server was nowhere to be found, get our bread, & a runner brings the app. When our entree comes, my wife's dish was missing a sauce. After waiting for a few minutes with the server again nowhere to be found, I went to the host stand to see about correcting our order. Finally, as we're finishing our meal, the server comes over to see how everything is going. I'm pissed at this point, so I just say ""fine"" to move things along so we can leave. I figured my critiques would fall on deaf ears, so I'll fill out the survey later.  Skip ahead a few days later, post-survey, I get an email from the GM, Shawn, which is a nice, quick response. He apologized for the problems we had, offered a gift card, & even called me to discuss and get details on our visit. We chat for a bit, I give my two cents on things, & we end the call. A few weeks later, it dawns on me that I never received a gift card, so I send Shawn an email inquiring about it. I felt weird doing it as I didn't want to appear to be complaining to try and get something for free, but the feeling of being slighted overwhelmed that weirdness. He replied back that the gift card will be ""mailed from our corporate headquarters in Calabasas, California. Usually takes 5-10 business days"". THAT reply was a couple of weeks ago, so I'm doubtful I'll see it. That weirdness I was talking about earlier makes it awkward to broach the subject with him AGAIN, so I figured I'd vent my frustrations here.  TL;DR - Good food, crap service. Oblivious server & zero attempt made at recovery. General Manager didn't follow thru on promise."
Britt D.,"Fairfax, VA",151,186,362,1.0,9/6/2017,"Worst experience ever.  I ordered a few sugar free cheesecakes for pick up and waited for about 10mins in the 'To go' area. It was so crowded loud, and the employees behind the counter could have cared less. If I wasn't getting these for someone, I would have left but I waited to be greeted.  Finally someone looks up and helps me, br co to use on with their task for another 5minutes before I get the cheesecake I had already ordered.  Upon return to the house there was a fly. a FLY on the cheesecake. I wasn't going to drive back there because I was treated so poorly. Horrible quality control.  I'll never go back."
M.C. P.,"Washington, DC",84,32,11,2.0,12/28/2017,"I like the restaurant,  cheesecake factory ave habe eaten at plenty across the States.  This one at Dulles Town Center is slow.  The bar isn't packed but you have to wait some time for acknowledgement and to receive something as simple as utensils.  It was very annoying..."
Judy L.,"Washington, DC",185,345,1815,4.0,7/30/2017,"I frequent this Cheesecake Factory the most. The service is consistently quick and the food is always delicious, and BIG of course! There always seem to be a wait when we come for dinner and lunch. But we usually don't wait more than 25 minutes and our servers are pretty good. We had limited dining time this past visit as we were in a hurry to the airport afterwards. Our server was very mindful and made sure our food arrived to the table at a reasonable amount of time. She also took initiative to package our cheesecakes ahead of time.  The Cheesecake Factory was one of those chains that I dined at back in college. It's burgers, pizza, salads, pastas, entrees, fusion foods, and cheesecake at reasonable prices with huge portions for now and for later. We eat here now because the food is still delicious and there's a little bit of something for everyone. My husband likes to bring his coworkers from Mexico and Europe here. The Cheesecake Factory is a sensation in other countries and what's more American than burgers, pizzas, fusion foods, and once again, huge portion sizes!!"
Ruth G.,"Broadlands, VA",207,76,49,5.0,8/8/2017,This Cheesecake Factory is located at Dulles Mall. It's pretty good and upholds their standard like at all other locations. The ambiance is always nice and the staff are friendly and accommodating. I went here with my brother and his niece. The server was really nice and funny. My niece laughed at his jokes.  The food was good. I ordered the Southwestern Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. My niece had the Kids Cheese Pizza. My brother had some Mexican Corn Tortilla Salad (don't quote me on that title). And of course we had shared a slice of Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. Oh myyy gosshhh Cheesecake is just so good..!  I would definitely come by again for more Cheesecake!
Wes M.,"San Jose, CA",603,484,1625,3.0,12/27/2016,"I know it's shortly after Christmas, but Cheesecake Factory was severely understaffed. How understaffed, you ask? There are close to a dozen open tables, but the wait is still 30 minutes because they don't have enough waiters to go around. Management needs to figure out what it's doing. Regarding the food, the sweet potato fries weren't bad. The cheesecake is also good, but very overpriced. $7-8 for a slice? I would also live more actual cheesecake, than soft cake. The Reese's PB Cup cheesecake I got have very thin layers on cheesecake."
Eddie B.,"Ashburn, VA",88,77,1362,5.0,10/17/2017,"We absolutely love the happy hour here. It's only at the bar area which has high top tables a few regular tables. The servers are usually friendly. The happy hour includes 2 or 3 draft beer options for about $4. They bring out a bread basket of tasty white and dark bread. The happy hour food menu is one of the best ones around when it comes to options. There a quite a few things you can order for a very good price between $5 and $8. Some of these item include guacamole, spinach dip, southwest egg rolls, mini chicken sandwiches, tuna tartar, foot long hot dog, hamburger, chicken lettuce wraps, pot stickers, flat breads, fried Mac and cheese balls and more. You can add fries to the burger and hot dog for like an additional $2 and it's totally worth it. Everything tastes very good. We always have a good experience here for a fairly good price. The cheesecake is not on the happy hour menu and is about $8 but it's delicious. It's one of the tastiest cheesecakes you can get around here. The whole cheesecake menu is huge and very creative."
Katelyn H.,"Inwood, WV",79,82,92,1.0,5/22/2017,"What is worse waiting 30 minutes for your drink or an hour for your check?  I should've read other reviews before coming in here, I know..my mistake. The hostesses wasn't very welcoming or friendly sadly but I easily over looked that because she wouldn't be the one serving us.  Once we got seated a woman took our drink order - strawberry lemonade & a sprite. About 10 minutes go by, no drink, no waitress, but yet a different girl comes up and asks for our drink order.. okay ""Strawberry Lemonade & Sprite"" again. We finally got our drinks and the first girl, she finally took our order. We got cheesy garlic bread, Caesar salad, & two lunch pasta dishes.  Now, we wait again. 20 minutes go by we finally get our appetizer and salad. Our waitress didn't even bring it out, it was yet again a different girl. By this time we've had 3 different waitresses.  We also got bread with our meal which wasn't very good at all. The best part was the cheesy garlic bread. About 10-15 minutes after our appetizer, our main meal finally came out. Meanwhile the people beside us who got there after us had already ate and left. The food wasn't anything to brag about. I got the four cheese pasta. It was honestly kind of bland and lacked salt. I also wasn't a fan of the huge ball of ricotta cheese just slapped in the middle. It wasn't very appetizing. The pasta was cooked well though I thought, it wasn't too mushy like a lot of places cook their pasta.  Once we were done eating my husband wanted a box for his so the other girl who wasn't our waitress came by and asked if we needed a box & I also told her to get our check. We had already been waiting 20 minutes for our original waitress to bring our check at that point. Our original waitress comes back and says I'll get you a box & the check. I told her someone else already went to get it. She rolled her eyes and said well I will get it too just in case. The other girl came back with a box & the check. Then right after, our original waitress came and acted surprised we got the box and check. Like HELLO we just told you someone else was getting it. She rolled her eyes and walked away. Not even a have a good day, nothing.  Needless to say we paid with cash because we weren't waiting for another 30 minutes to get our card back. I don't understand the hype for this place. I definitely didn't enjoy having 3 different people acting as our waitress. It wasn't worth all that waiting either. This place is not that great and we won't ever be back."
Burn S.,"Alexandria, VA",0,36,2,2.0,12/9/2017,"Our waiter, Jason, either was unhappy or didn't like us or didn't like that we had kids. But he wasn't attentive   We had to ask other waiters to help us. When he did help, he dropped off whatever we needed and quickly left. Dang! Can we get a- "" Do you need anything else?"" Or a ""How's your food?""   Won't be returning to this Cheesecake Factory. Service was terrible- and food was just ok! It's a shame; I used to love Cheesecake Factory Dulles."
Nicole H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,39,23,5.0,8/13/2017,"Delicious! I expect the cheesecake to be amazing (and it is), the food, my expectations aren't so high because after all they are the CHEESCAKE factory. However, the Jamaican blacken shrimp dish is delicious. Just the right amount of spicy (I don't do spicy). The plantains were sweet, the black beans were..ok. But the chicken and shrimp were really good. The food came in a decent amount of time and the waiter was knowledgeable and nice. Would I go there again. A resounding yes. But then again, they are the cheesecake factory, you should want to go again."
Lauren M.,"Frederick, MD",43,124,81,2.0,1/10/2017,"Oh, dear! Cheesecake Factory, I want to love you! I visited this location after work with a few friends. We were promptly seated, provided with water and bread, then it all went down hill from there. The service was inexcusably slow. We waited what felt like for-ev-er for our orders to be taken and then forever-and-a-half for them to arrive. I ordered the crabcake sandwich with fries and a mint cucumber lemonade. The mint cucumber lemonade was wonderful. So much so that I bought the ingredients to recreate it at home. The crabcake, however, was under cooked - basically a pile of crabby goo. I would've said something to our waiter, if we would've actually seen him. I ate a few nibbles and called it quits because I knew we didn't have enough time for them to redo it (and I didn't want a stomach ache). Yay for bread and fries for dinner! I don't even think it was the waiters fault, as the restaurant seemed severely understaffed. We gave ourselves a little over an hour and a half to eat before our evening activity (paint night nearby) and ended up having to rush to finish our meals and get the check. Once the checks arrived, they were almost all wrong! To save time, we worked it out among ourselves.  It was overall a very poor experience and I would expect better given the Cheesecake Factory's reputation."
Jenn K.,"Reston, VA",92,465,59,4.0,1/30/2017,"Good service, great food- as always. We sat here a long time while talking and our server was very patient and pleasant with us"
Pookie L.,"Emerald Isle, NC",2,3,,1.0,10/22/2017,I have never had a person be more rude to me over the phone than I did tonight with who ever was working the calls. I love the food here but on customer service alone I am giving this place 1 star I can't stress how unbelievable disrespectful this employee was and how unhelpful she was. Very unprofessional in my opinion. It makes me never want to eat here again
Shankoo A.,"Norristown, PA",0,2,,1.0,10/25/2017,"Worst restaurant in this area, food and service both are poor.. ordered Buffalo blast, too salty to eat. Also ordered stake n grilled salmon, both served cold n tasteless..ordered strawberry cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake, they were ok."
Angela K.,"Ashburn, VA",99,93,270,4.0,5/19/2016,"I've been to this location multiple times. Most recently, I went for Mother's Day weekend to treat my mom.  The service is always great, and they are always so helpful when I can't decide what to get. The calamari is absolutely delicious! I love the aioli and marinara sauce that comes with it. The batter isn't too heavy, or overly oily. My family and I get it every time. The Seared Tuna Tataki Salad is AMAZING! The perfectly seared tuna, arugula, avocado, slices of fresh tomatoes, and dressing all go together perfectly. It's extremely addicting. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta is always on point! The sauce has just enough spice and creamy-ness to make this dish irresistible. The pasta is always perfectly cooked, and the chicken, peas, and crunchy tortilla toppings all compliment each other very well. I have never had any problems with this location."
Kimberly J.,"Chantilly, VA",814,1667,23046,4.0,4/19/2016,"Their menu is like a book. It always takes me some time to figure out what to get here. So many options! Came to this location awhile back and just recently once again. Both times, service has been good. Our servers have been attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Love their complimentary bread basket, it's fresh and warm. We always enjoy our entrees and no matter how full we are, we always have room for their cheesecake. Yum!"
Jessica M.,"Ashburn, VA",1,27,3,4.0,10/13/2017,Great waiter Sunday afternoon very friendly and attentive. I will be coming back.  Will have to say their hostess wasn't very approachable (she may be having a bad day) other than that it's a great place to be on a Sunday.
Scott G.,"San Diego, CA",5,129,63,3.0,9/15/2017,Cheesecake Factory never disappoints such a wide variety on their menu you really can not go wrong I have been with large and small groups and everyone always finds something they enjoy.  The cheesecake selection is out of this world as well.
Nurzhan A.,"Herndon, VA",56,33,5,2.0,6/23/2017,I ordered kobe beef burger. The burger was super oily and greasy. Tastes like it was not just fat beef but they tried to make it fat using oil. When I pointed it out to the waiter he responded that it's a sauce they use. He brought me other bun but it didn't change the situation and the waiter didn't check on me if that helped. Beer wasn't cold as well. Disappointment.
AJ A.,"San Diego, CA",0,22,62,4.0,11/22/2017,"I have dined here several times with my family and always had a good experience the food is great, the portions are large and the cheesecake is what makes it the best. The reason for four stars is because of the wait time and for the limited menu options for seafood."
Ken C.,"Ashburn, VA",0,16,7,5.0,11/29/2017,"This 5 star goes out to the great server Shakira Shakira. Girl when you bring food like that, you make the tongue go mad. I'm ready. To eat more. Waiting on my southwest egg rolls. I would go back tonight but I'm still fool from biscuits and gravy. Whenever, wherever I need comeda Ill be there if you are there and thats the deal my dear. 20 percent tips dont lie."
Kimberly R.,"Leesburg, VA",64,8,,5.0,9/28/2017,"The staff is always friendly and we've never waited over 30 minutes for a table. We typically pick from their wide variety of pasta dishes, which have been delicious every time. The cheesecake is yummy but my favorite is their whip cream!! It is one of the only big chain restaurants I actually enjoy eating at. They also have a cucumber mint lemonade that is to die for!!"
Susan H.,"Reston, VA",451,633,1111,2.0,12/28/2015,"We went to the mall to shop the after Christmas sales.  Before going, I asked my husband where he wanted to eat.  He said, ""The Cheesecake Factory"".  This was a surprise considering our recent visit to the one in the Tysons Galeria was a rather lackluster experience.  He explained that he wanted to have a turkey club sandwich and when we went to the Tysons one, they didn't have any turkey but figured they would have it here. We were there shortly after 5 p.m. on a Sunday.  The place was busy but there were still empty tables.  We were lead to a booth by the friendly hostess.  Our server came along shortly, before we even had time to look at the menu.  We asked her to come back in a bit.  When she came back, I gave my food and drink order.  I ordered a glass of lemonade plus ""Renee's special"" which consists of: 1/2 sandwich, salad and soup.  The soup of the day (and the only soup they have) was sweet chicken soup. So far, so good...then my husband ordered.  He ordered a glass of Yuengling and a turkey club.  They didn't have any turkey.  I asked the server why that was and mentioned how Tysons didn't have it either.  She said they hadn't had any turkey in a long time because there was a turkey shortage.  Then I asked her why they didn't remove turkey items from the menu or at least clip a note to the menu.  She said because they expect to have it again at some point.  My husband then told her that he would need more time to pick out something else. Meanwhile, we figured that we, at least, would get our drinks...but no.  People who came in after us were getting their drinks.  The server came back to take my husband's food order.  He ordered the old fashioned burger and didn't want a side with it. Then the server made herself scarce---still no drinks.  Finally, I caught her eye and asked about the drinks.  She apologized and blamed the bartender (really?)  but she then got the drinks It took less time to get our food to us.  My husband was served a burger and a roll with no toppings.  He asked the food runner about that and the runner offered to bring him some lettuce, tomato and onion.  That came quickly but instead of lettuce, there was shredded cabbage. My dinner was okay.  The 1/2 sandwich was chicken salad with almonds.  the salad was mixed greens dressed in a vinaigrette.  The sweet chicken soup wasn't too bad as it was creamy with a generous amount of chicken in it.  The lemonade was actually good---more on the sweet side and with a sugared rim on the glass. The whole experience left us feeling annoyed.   If they don't have any turkey items at any Cheesecake Factory, at least fix the menu in some way to reflect that.   As we were leaving, my husband said to me, ""Remind me to never go here again.""  I most certainly will do that."
Ali E.,"Arlington, VA",36,25,7,1.0,8/27/2017,This was the worst experience I've ever had at a cheesecake factory. We were seated immediately and given waters and a bread basket. It was 35 minutes before our waitress returned to ask if we wanted something else to drink and if we were ready to order. The tables around us that arrived at the same we did we're receiving food while we ordered. Our waitress never refilled our drinks or asked if we needed more bread. 50 minutes later we received our food and refills. Our food was warm but not hot. We waited another 20 minutes before spotting our waitress to flag our waitress down to request the check. If the waitress had been friendly or apologetic for our delay I wouldn't have minded the wait so much. Unfortunately our waitress acted inconvenienced by even having to take our order.
Randy M.,"Frederick, MD",1,41,29,4.0,3/9/2017,"I've visited the CCF in Baltimore Inner Harbor and it was abysmal and I wrote a review of the horrible service. I took my wife to the CCF in Dulles and the experience was 100% better. We knew it was going to be a wait (it is always a wait) but surprisingly it wasn't that long..about 20 minutes and the restaurant was packed. The wait staff was quick to greet us, take our order and serve us our order. I was amazed by how timely the food came. No complaints about the food because it was fantastic as usual. I'd return to this location over the Baltimore location 100 times over."
Rhys D.,"Bristow, VA",0,30,2,3.0,1/3/2017,"We were told 30 minutes for a wait. Ended up waiting 50 mins for a table. Waiter brought bread 5 minutes later but no water. He was very apologetic although there have been at least 5 open tables that were not cleaned off sitting for the last 20 minutes of our wait. No manager in sight. Hostess kept disappearing from the stand. Drinks (water, soda and wine) took another 20 minutes to be delivered. Our waiter mentioned that they didn't schedule for the holiday (January 2nd) but according to other reviews this is a recurring issue. Baked loaded tots were awesome as an appetizer, mom enjoyed her house red wine. Bread was actually fairly cold sadly. Our waiter, Dominic, was really nice and apologized for everything. Always had refills for us in hand, kept our to go cheesecake in the fridge until we checked out and boxed my food for me. I hope management figures the scheduling out because it was obvious to me as a server that they were not expecting a rush. Just in our section alone our server had a party of 10 to himself plus an additional 7 tables of 2 to 5 people each. I shouldn't have to feel bad for my server! Especially on a noted federal holiday - of course it's expected to be busy at the mall, why management is out of touch with this is beyond me."
Mike D.,"Fresno, CA",1,1,,3.0,10/18/2017,My wife's meatloaf was over cooked(burnt) and we had to send it back for another one. I'm only writing because I would have expected the manager to offer some type of discount (5%?).
Michelle h.,"Frederick, MD",28,37,32,5.0,3/4/2017,"Came here for part of my triplets birthday weekend of fun! We had tons of appetizers and of course CHEESECAKE!!! So yummy! Was told the wait would be 45 mins, but in reality we waited about 15. Food was great. Cheesecake was amazing. All in all a great night!!"
Doris Y.,"Reston, VA",147,266,837,4.0,11/10/2016,"For dinner, I would always suggest a couple to have one appetizer and one entree because their entrees are HUGE. Plus, you gotta save room for some cheese cake...Right? Always pleasant to eat at Cheesecake Factory- friendly staff, consistent quality of pods. Try to avoid weekend though because the line is long."
S H.,"Leesburg, VA",0,73,12,2.0,8/19/2017,"As with all Cheesecake Factory locations - great menu - but too commercial.  This location needs alot of work.  Service has been horrible both times we visited - both servers appeared miserable - no smiles.  Appetizer came out with dinner, had to ask for water, cheese wasn't melted in our burrito - was my son's bday and had to remind the server 3 times for the happy birthday.  Oh - please turn on the AC, never eaten in a place so hot."
Karla M.,"Purcellville, VA",0,2,2,1.0,2/15/2017,Ended up at the doctors. I went to have a meal with my girl friend yesterday and I had the carbonara. I took 3 bites and I advised the bartender (that's where we were sitting) that my food had no sauce the bacon and the chicken tasted raw. He went to the kitchen and grabbed more sauce. I told him I would not like to eat it anymore as I was already this gusted. His attitude the whole was so bad towards everyone that he even charged me for my meal but honestly is not about the money I paid regardless I don't like causing scenes. I woke up this morning at 0900 with bumps on my arms and legs rushed to the clinic in rite aid where they advised me it was food poisoning.
Nitika K.,"Sterling, VA",0,14,4,1.0,12/7/2016,"I'm so super disappointed with Cheesecake Factory today for the first time. Took my daughter for her 9th birthday to . I told the lady at the counter as well as our server that we were celebrating her birthday. And they did NOTHING. I even ordered a slice of cheese cake thinking that at least they'll put a candle on it for her but NOTHING!  In the end I paid and called for the manager and all he said is sorry. His attitude was like ""go to hell...I don't give a shit about your daughter"". Thanks! I wish I had taken her to Olive Garden where she had asked me to anyways. I thought I was making it special for her but apparently not."
Paul D.,"Sterling, VA",105,259,148,4.0,1/7/2017,Over all it's a good place to get a variety of food.  We enjoy their happy hour which has somoe great appatizers for about 1/2 price. It's like from 4 to 6 M thru F.  They also have drink discounts and you can eat with tables and booths on bar sec. Over all a good deal.  The only challenge is the wait and they don't have call ahead. It's worth the wait most of the time.
M A.,"Ashburn, VA",0,11,,1.0,10/20/2017,Ewwwe. Saturday brunch: chicken waffle with potatoes were disgusting. Potatoes were old and hard to chew.
Anton P.,"Leesburg, VA",64,1,,1.0,5/21/2017,Ive had one of the worst experiences. And I didnt even eat. All started of at the host stand that looked abandoned. Staff running around and not paying attention to me. Finally Ive got someones attention. When I got to my table I was shocked. An average meal price is around $18 but the silverware weren't polished and my fork was bend. After a 15 minute wait for server to come and take my order Ive decided enough is enough and left. I will never come there again and will strongly advice everyone else to stay away from there unless you like overpriced food and horrible customer service
Daniel L.,"Ashburn, VA",5,9,1,3.0,7/30/2017,"On Sunday morning, my wife and I went to the cheesecake factory at Dulles mall because of the promotion they are having today. We went straight to the cheesecake counter and were greeted nicely by one of the employees. The questions we had at the time were answered with great pleasure by this employee.  Then when we went to check out with the cashier, Lan Chi L, my wife had another question. ""What are all the new cheesecakes?"" This question was answered in a hurry and not completely answered, followed by a rude ""are you ready?"" Once we ordered one cheesecake, we felt rushed by Lan Chi L, although there was no line. We also had a family member from out of the country with us and we wanted him to get a cheesecake. We ended up ordering 6 cheesecakes and then were told they all would not be half price. Only one per person. Because we were unaware of that we decided to order one cheesecake each. We were all rushed to order and were asked if that was all, after each item we ordered. Not great customer service.  Lan Chi L clearly did not want to be at work this morning, but she did not need to be rude to us. When you work in a business like this, you should be prepared to deal with all situations. Plus, what happened to ""the customer is always right"" I wanted to speak to a manager but didn't have the time. I really like this location, however today we got waited on by the wrong person."
Carmen R.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,69,29,4.0,4/15/2017,"Excellent service from our friendly server Johanna. We had the Tex Mex eggrolls, BBQ ranch chicken salad, macaroni and cheese burger, and the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. My son loved the macaroni & cheese burger- he said its the best burger he's ever had. My salad was HUGE for the lunch portion. We're all leaving full and happy"
K R.,"Manassas, VA",0,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. THIS PLACE IS ROACH INFESTED! So, my family and I were sitting at a booth where we killed two roaches crawling on our table. We had already had appetizers by this point so we were trying not to throw up. Right next to our table, a waitress was folding silverware.... CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IS ON THE SILVERWARE?? Our food gets to the table and before we could eat it, my dad kills YET ANOTHER roach! WE WERE DONE! I call a manager to our table, and these are his exact words: ""I apologize for this guys, we are roach infested and we clean every Monday, but it is the time of year. You know how it is right? We spray every Monday and the problem won't go away."" UMMMMM MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS: WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER HAD ROACHES! I mean, are these people serious? By this point, he is still expecting us to pay for our meal that we DID NOT TOUCH! This place is not for those who are of caliber! JUST SAYING. DINE HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK"
John S.,"Tyler, TX",10,87,3,3.0,11/22/2016,"I sat at the bar as I often do when I go to a Cheesecake Factory. I was the only one at the bar, but it took about 10 minutes to get my first drink in, and another 10 - 15 to get my food order in. I don't really feel like I can blame it on the bartender, but the restaurant's management. The bartender was too busy filling orders for the wait staff and didn't have the time to check on 1 guy at the bar. I'm sure the lack of a second bartender was why the bar was completely empty when I walked in. The food was good and tasted like it should coming from the Cheesecake Factory."
