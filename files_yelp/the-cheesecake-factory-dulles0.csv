Wayne S.,"Edinburg, VA",1,252,,2.0,8/19/2012,"I'm not sure why I go back to these places.  I've eaten at several now and have never left happy or satisfied with my meal.  The servers are always nice and the decor is different.  We ordered the Dynamite Shrimp appetizer and it was ok at best.  I had the Sheila's Chicken Salad.  It was musty and bitter tasting.  Our server disappeared for a long time so I ate some and left it.  Once he finally showed up he asked how things were and he did remove my salad from the bill. One thing I really hate about this restaurant, and similar restaurants, is the noise level.  For those wearing hearing aids the noise is amplified to a very uncomfortable level.  It's like restaurants make things as loud as possible to get people to leave in a hurry."
Sheen A.,"Ashburn, VA",0,1,,2.0,5/31/2014,"I love CF overall. I love the food and everything about this place but unfortunately upon my last visit there I had really bad experience with the server. I asked her if i can have complimentary bread which they serve once u arrive at your table, she told me that they didn't have any ... and i saw other people who came after us are having some... I was really disappointed."
Gina T.,"Sterling, VA",946,27,4,1.0,11/21/2008,"If I could give them zero stars, I would. We just went for  dinner. Family of four, Friday night 7pm. Wait time was average. Food was ok. Service was terrible.  It started when two meals were brought out and then several minutes passed before the other two showed up.  One wasn't what was ordered. It was reordered and appeared after we were finished eating (sharing food with the person with the missing dinner).  Then they dropped the check off. Only it wasn't ours. And had someone else's credit card in it. After a few minutes of staring at an unfamiliar VISA card - we asked for the manager. Twice. Finally I picked up my cell phone and called the manager. He came over to our table.   He was not in the least sorry or apologetic.  He asked if it was our card that was sent to the wrong table - when it wasn't - he didn't care. He did not care about the service.  He did not care about the security of his customers.  He just plain didn't care. No apologies. Nothing. For added fun - when they did give us our bill - the pen didn't even write. If you are looking for a miserable experience and an overpriced mediocre burger - head to cheesecake factory.  Otherwise save your money, time and identity by going elsewhere."
Family L.,"Ashburn, VA",1,21,3,4.0,2/23/2014,"They have added a tremendous gluten free menu. Cheesecake factory may be a chain, but they are a good chain, at least, and they offer the most GF options of any chain restaurant I have seen. Looks nothing like the Cheesecake Factory on Big Bang Theory. I really wonder how BBT got permission to use the name, when the restaurant shown on the show looks so much worse than the real thing."
Julie P.,"California, MD",0,21,,1.0,1/18/2014,"Wait staff is barely competent and everything takes FOREVER even when they aren't busy. Over two hours to order, eat and get the bill. Not a big deal sometimes but when you have 3 toddlers its frustrating as heck. The food was barely ok but the service situation is what assures that we won't be back."
Daniel B.,"Laurel, MD",2,177,274,4.0,7/2/2011,Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but it's been about two years since I visited this particular location because of quality and service issues. I'm pleased to say the quality of the food has greatly improved. The service is still lacking. I ordered the Thai chicken pasta and snickers cheesecake. The Thai chicken pasta was excellent. The snickers cheesecake was good but I still like Adams peanut butter and chocolate raspberry truffle better. The service started out slow even though it wasn't busy.  It took a long time for the server to take my drink order and the bread barely beat the main meal to the table.  The service did improve towards the end of the meal.  I'll definitely start visiting this location again.
Joel P.,"Washington, DC",90,140,60,3.0,6/7/2011,Same as every other location but on this particular instance our waiter was SLOW. Never a good thing especially when you're ready to pay and leave instead of sitting there in limbo.
Nikki B.,"Ashburn, VA",34,39,14,2.0,11/20/2010,"Went on a Friday night.  Of course the place is packed.  Best time to go is 5:30-6.  My friend and I went directly to the bar, grabbed a seat.  Service was slow and the waiter forgot us a couple of times.  i.e. our drinks and food.  Definitely, had better..."
Kit F.,"Herndon, VA",67,14,7,3.0,8/11/2011,"The menu is h-u-g-e. It takes me 45mins to order! Instead of a tri-fold typical type menu, its a spiral bound 8 pages, with advertisements....seriously!? The food is good, but who cares lets just get to the cheesecake part of the meal. Putting on my Gordon Ramsey hat for a moment, I would suggest that they get a smaller/simpler food menu with a focused identity and expand the cheesecake menu (if that is even possible!)"
Kelly K.,"Hopewell, VA",7,5,,1.0,11/3/2012,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory at several different locations.  This by far has been the worst service I've received thus far.  The management neglected to make a visit to the table after I found what seemed to be hair (pubic what it seemed to be) in the bread.  I completely lost my appetite and although I am not one to make a scene or be dramatic/demanding, the waiter simply looked at the bread and said ""eww yeah gross"" and took the bread back.  He returns and mentions to me that he had told the manager and continued on with business as usual.  Needless to say I was ""full"" and ate very little of my meal, which may have contributed to the loss of appetite.  The manager never showed up and their was no other mention or compensation of my experience and a bill that was not worth it.  I went ahead and paid the $80 for the meal that was charged in full for 3 and requested to speak with the manager on my way out.  He came out and simply made excuses saying that there must have been miscommunication as another manager had left work.  I was not looking for a free meal, but really at the very least wanted to be heard!!  Long story short, this location lacks service and has very poor management."
Rich P.,"Loudoun, VA",0,17,3,5.0,11/28/2010,"Consistantly great food and service. Huge menu. Of all the large national chains,  Cheesecake Factory is at least in my top three!"
Chris D.,"Seattle, WA",190,528,538,2.0,12/6/2010,"I managed to go 32 years of life without eating at one of these bastions of mediocrity... but alas, that streak is over. I'm really just writing this review to thank my boss publicly for treating us (shhh... performance review time is approaching). Thanks boss! You're the bestest!!"
Wisam A.,"Aldie, VA",1,38,18,1.0,6/6/2013,"Very bad customer service, I went with my family and friends on Thursday June /6th at 6:15 pm , they didn't let us to sit because we have a baby stroller for my 2 months age baby the weather is was rainy and very windy , the manager is very arrogant and rude .bad policy ,I used to go with my friends at least twice a month ,but we decided no to go this miserable place any more"
Chad H.,"Bethesda, MD",2,36,4,2.0,4/13/2008,"Generally speaking, I can't stand this chain. This weekend on a night out in Sterling my friends chose this place to eat, and I didn't have much choice but to come along because I was pretty hungry.  I have to give it to this place that it looks pretty nice, but right off the bat I can't stand the noise level in here. I felt like I was at a rock concert. The lighting... way to dim. I wear glasses for God's sake, and I was still struggling to make my way to the table.... AFTER the 30 or so minute wait to get the table. During this wait I suggested IHOP, which has never failed my late-night 24/7 cravings, but some of the high-class whiney pricks that tagged along with one of my friends wouldn't let that happen. So Cheesecake Factory it is. Once we finally got our menus, I didn't know what the hell I was supposed to order. I love Chicken Salad, so I got the Chicken Salad Sandwich. After 20 or so minutes, our food came out, and by this time I had gone deaf and couldn't hear my own voice so I didn't bother asking for a refill of my water for fear I would just be making inane blabbing noises. The Chicken Salad Sandwich came out with huge portioning. It was actually 2 sandwiches cut in half, stuffed to the max, with some wierd nasty salad on the side made up of tasteless greens from my neighbor's backyard, smothered of course in a sour vinaigrette. The bread was so overly toasted that I nearly choked per my lack of water. The Chicken Salad itself was more like Mayonnaise with bits of chicken and whatever else in it... NUTS. Almonds I think? Or some annoying crunchy nutty thing. I'm not gonna lie, those nuts were pissing me off.  Despite my bad experience I still tipped well, which is just general courtesy that I've gotten accustomed to. But honestly this damn chain of restaurants is so over-hyped. I doubt I'll ever willingly go back to any of these places again.  I HAVE heard good things about the cheesecake, but I'm afraid it's made of mayonnaise so I'll pass."
L O.,"Avon, OH",1,91,5,4.0,2/25/2013,"We enjoy The Cheesecake Factory, we've dined there a number of times, and it is consistent.  Always good service, great food, love the atmosphere, and have yet to have a bad experience."
Courtney R.,"Arlington, VA",351,489,30,1.0,3/24/2008,"I echo Nadine's sentiments--the only thing worth wrapping your mouth around at this place is the cheesecake. At least they get that part right. Worst CCF I've been to, usually order the crab won ton but even they were barely passable the last time I ordered them (Baltimore Inner Harbor). My sister said her meal was disgusting too. I ordered the BLT salad, half of which I immediately boxed. It was so nasty, twin, I left the box at the table."
Heath A.,"Boston, MA",38,113,1,2.0,7/18/2007,"One of the worst Cheese Cake Factory's out there.  I'm not a big CCF eater but whenever I've got family visiting or friends from out of town and I need to pick a spot where everyone can find something to eat and eat due to their gargantuan sizes I pick the CCF.  Well I had relatives in town again and went to this new outpost in Loudon  due to the closeness it was to them. Big mistake.  The wait wasn't bad to get the table but I have a feeling how the restaurant is set up that if your table isn't in the center spots closer to the kitchen the service would take just as long if you were basically in outer Mongolia. The service here was awful. Our spacey server sent our salad out to the wrong table and then took over 20 minutes to replace it, asking if we wanted a cup of soup in the meantime. How long does it take for one of these salads to be made? My fish and chips were cold and soggy, not one of their better attempts for when I do get this meal.  The Tons of Fun Burger looked like a monster and my cousin loved every bite of it. The Chicken Madeira is always good but don't get caught up eating the two pounds of mashed potatoes that it comes with. The Miso Salmon is another favorite but what gives with the 4 snow peas and the mountain of rice.  Still the CCF is a good to have for guests but making a habit of eating here will expand your waistline faster than the growth rate of Loudon county."
Enver A.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,2,3,4.0,12/6/2012,It was quite OK. For appetizer we got nachos with chicken which i did not quite like. For entree i got tacos with chicken it was great and service was great as well.
Tyler I.,"Ashburn, VA",12,26,,2.0,12/15/2009,"Oh dear god. Let me start off with, the portions were gigantic. Now, that being said, in order for me to decipher what I wanted to eat, i had to read an encyclopedia of  dishes they can make. I wish Dr. Jones was with me to venture through the fucking brick book that is their MASSIVE MENU. Does it really need 40 plus pages?  After taking notes and plotting a hunger graph, I calculated the slope of my ass would result in ordering a Chinese salad. I felt rather full after visually ingesting three years of culinary dishes offered as electives, at your local University. what I'm having trouble saying is that the menu has way, way to many pages.  Getting there, I walk upon the host and a server eye fucking the shit out of each other that I was embarrassed. Embarrassed what her mother must think her daughter has become. In public?! Have ye no shame? After karate chopping through them to get her attention we get sat at a lovely booth, right between the kitchen and the server station. Not only do I love to hear other patrons bitch about how their server didn't do something, now I get to hear the servers talk about what type of excrement they put in our food. No, that's not fair, I'm simply kidding but they complain just as much!  Our server was sweeet and very quick. The lunch portion match the menu, how did my lovely Ashley A put it? ""Fat bastard"" size portions. My plate weighed as much as my head. My plate was plentiful with chicken, crunchy things and mandarins? It was great and I would definetly like to try more of their food but I'm done reading while hungry. Decrease the menu and this place would get one more star."
Armando Luis C.,"Arlington, VA",0,16,,1.0,3/11/2013,I took my father and my family here before he had to catch a flight. The waiter brought my dad the wrong order. The manager came over and she was so rude I couldn't believe it. The waiter did the right thing and brought him his order while the manager couldn't figure out what to do at all. She made it so much worse.It was so embarrassing. We will never return.
