Melanie B.,"Sterling, VA",3,44,1,4.0,8/3/2015,"The food is delicious, but a bit pricy. I ordered the Sheppards Pie, which was delicious. I also had the stuffed mushrooms. They were good, but very small, not worth the price.  I got the Salted Caramel Cheesecake. It wasn't as good as I was hoping for, don't get me wrong, it was good, just not what I thought it was going to be.  Overall good experience with Curbside to Go, but again, pricy!"
Jey J.,"Washington, DC",217,150,20,3.0,3/4/2014,I'm torn with this location. wait times are always really long and the service is terrible. I typically only get 3 things off the menu and never have any complains about those dishes. I will say their fried chicken salad is by far my favorite salad. it is to die for.
Zbigniew T.,"Hedgesville, WV",37,32,7,4.0,2/23/2016,"Lettuce wraps,  both Asian and Mexican are our regular far here, followed by another taste of the cheesecake..."
Lynn S.,"Alexandria, VA",151,817,268,4.0,8/19/2013,"Good place to get carry out. Aside from the tempting case of cheese cakes representing every possible combination of flavors, I noticed a full bar and admired the open feeling from the high ceilings in the restaurant. The decor is so attractive that within minutes guests would never believe they were dining just outside the Dulles shopping mall (near Nordstrom's). My lunch-sized Cobb salad with slices of avocado and fresh turkey was just as I hoped. They put a container of balsamic vinegar dressing on the side, but if you prefer another dressing, just let them know when you order. This is a well run, reliable restaurant and best of all, the food does not disappoint! They also cater."
Mike R.,"Sterling, VA",93,235,431,2.0,9/5/2013,"Not really a fan of this place.  I've had a couple good experiences, a couple bad experiences with the food, and I'm just not sure it's worth the calories, sodium shock, or the wait. So... I had the meatloaf sandwich once -- WAY too salty and too mushy on the texture.  The bacon jelly jam stuff was good though. I had the Shrimp BLT once -- which would have been good, but they MURDERED it with way too much dressing.  I'm talking KILLED it.   I tried the Shrimp BLT again -- without the dressing.  Damn, wish I had a little bit of dressing, now it was too dry.  I don't like Cheesecake.  Crazy, I know! I had the Orange Chicken once -- it was okay, but I'd rather go to a chinese restaurant for it. I had the Kobe burger once -- that one, I actually enjoyed. I have tried several bites of random other things from other people's plates and none of it really impressed me.  It's usually too salty or too rich for my blood.   I could maybe put all that aside if there wasn't always a huge wait to eat here...  Like an hour or more when we've gone... (if it were just me, I would have moved on.... but I guess its really worth the wait to some)  so, I guess I'm alone in my struggles with this place. If I go again, its either the Kobe burger or Shrimp BLT (sauce on the side).  Damn, I really want that Shrimp BLT to come out right.  I think it would be good."
Sakita D.,"Loudoun County, VA",103,95,294,4.0,8/11/2013,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory numerous times and each time I've had a pretty decent experience. It can be a bit pricey but they give very generous portions. I always leave with a doggy bag; enough for a full lunch the next day.  We never usually order appetizers because we get trashed off of the honey-wheat bread they bring out and by the time the food comes I can only eat like 4 bites, then it's in the doggy bag. This time we ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. They were pretty delicious. It comes with julienned carrots, beans sprouts, grilled chicken (which honestly they could've given us a little more of for 3 people), noodles, and three different sauces: Thai chili, which was sweet but missing the spicy. A green sauce which was sweeter than the thai chili sauce and peanut sauce. The wraps were very good and a light appetizer to start off with.  I ended up getting my usual, BBQ salmon. The salmon is always juicy and the amount of sauce they put on it is just right. It comes with a side of corn succotash but I always swap that out with steamed broccoli. Nom! The roasted red potatoes and thin crispy red onion straws just complete the dish.  And last but not least I got a slice of chocolate cake that I can't remember the name of, but it was delicious, to go.  Overall I rate them a 4.5"
Henry C.,"Sterling, VA",0,12,2,2.0,12/22/2014,"I am at the place writing this review... Ordered a White Chicken Chilli with brown rice, was asked by the server what kind of rice.  It came with white rice and the rice was not cook through.   The chilli probably raised my blood pressure 10000Hg or more  given that I can tolerate high sodium and I stopped eating about 1/3 through.  I ordered a mint green tea and they served me with ice tea.  I ordered an appetiser and that was eatable so I did not go hungry.  Don't meant to be a prick but the food quality just wasn't  there.  So I think unless someone drag me here like today would stay away."
Balquiria V.,"Sterling, VA",7,33,26,2.0,11/24/2014,The food is good but service isn't so great.  We usually order food to pick up (work) during our lunch and 7 or of 10 times they will get our order wrong.  Unfortunately a lot of our business partners like this place so we keep coming back but I hate spending money here.
Diana M.,"Oakton, VA",14,29,234,4.0,2/16/2015,I love this place. They have a great happy hour. Five dollar appetizers from 4-7 pm. My favorites are the fire roasted artichokes and the guacamole. The burgers are really good too. Especially for five dollars. Lindsay was a fabulous bartender. We will definitely be back to see her.
Navit S.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,3,,5.0,6/28/2015,"Visited there yesterday and as always was very happy. Food is fresh, tasty and dishes are biggggggggg. I love the huge menu with all the many options to chose from. One of good things they implemented is that you can reserve the time, go to the nearest mall and return few moments prior to the table be ready. I recommend this place to anyone I know."
Issa U.,"Sterling, VA",0,10,1,5.0,3/11/2016,Typical from Cheesecake factory (That being high quality food with amazing waiters/waitresses). There food is delicious and it's pretty much average...
Melissa J.,"Frederick, MD",9,55,111,4.0,11/3/2013,"The food here is always excellent. There is so much to choose from including a wide variety of ""skinny"" options that are great for those who can't possibly eat the ridiculously large portions on the regular menu.  The service here could be a lot better. For example, I ate here for lunch today with a group of 5. We were told there would be a twenty minute wait and there was which was fine. The restaurant was by no means packed, so when we were called to be seated we assumed we would be placed at one of the many tables that were open. The hostess led us to a dirty table, realized it wasn't ready, and asked to go back to the waiting area for five more minutes. We then watched this happen to two more groups. Not the end of the world, but kind of annoying. Still, delicious food here."
Jen J.,"Vienna, VA",0,6,,2.0,10/26/2015,"Cheesecake Factory  Went there for dinner with my husband since we have never gone there together for a meal. We only went one time to get cheesecake for dessert.  I ordered the combo dinner: the Herb Salmon and Steak Dianne. Hubby ordered the huge chicken burrito dish. First off, both our meals were cold. The chicken in hubby's burrito was tough.  As for my meal... Let's start with the steak. I ate a small piece and thought it tasted weird. I figured maybe it was the sauce. I asked hubby to try a small piece. He spit it out and said it was spoiled. So, I spit out the second small piece I just put in my mouth. The salmon came with mashed potato and asparagus which were actually okay except that they were cold.  Our server came to our table and asked us how our meals are. We told him about the steak. He went to get his manager.  The manager came and he took my plate away with the spoiled steak. We decided to just go with the Herb Salmon when he asked us if I wanted the same dish. He said he'll get me a fresh order of the Herb Salmon.  My husband decided not to say anything about his burrito. He probably ate not even a quarter of the the whole thing. The chicken was that tough for him.  They finally came back with my salmon. I wasn't a big fan of the lemony sauce that came with it. We ended up just taking our food home. We ordered our cheesecakes to go, which they gave us for free.  Hubby ended up throwing the leftover burrito the next day.   It's nice that they have a huge variety of dishes but if you're starving, you better know what you want before you go there otherwise, you'll get a headache from hunger trying to figure what to order from their novel-like menu.  Their cheesecakes are always great. After this experience, I think I'll stick with the cheesecake again next time."
RMthree M.,"Sterling, VA",3,137,37,3.0,12/28/2014,This location is a rather popular location. I've been a handful of times and it's been busy and crowded everytime. I wasn't too happy with the last time I was there. I ordered the fish tacos and they were well under seasoned and I could tell that my dish had sit under a heat lamp because the rice and beans along with the tortilla had been completely dried out.  The only thing that saved this review and raised it to three stars was the fact that our waitress was AMAZING. She helped with our drink decisions and was attentive...couldn't hold the horrible food against her.
Jared J.,"Ashburn, VA",2,132,8,5.0,6/27/2014,"Cheescake Factory is truly phenomenal. It was clean, and the atmosphere was welcoming. Our server was the best of the best. He had a great personality, was very attentive, and made us feel welcome. The food was incredible! One of the best burgers I've ever tasted! It was like heaven on a bun, no joke. This is, without a doubt, a great establishment! Totally worthy of a five star review."
Katie H.,"Chantilly, VA",0,18,2,1.0,1/31/2016,"What is the point of having curb side pick up if you don't offer it on cheesecake orders?? My boyfriend wanted me to pick up cheesecake on my way home from work. When I called to place the order, the girl who answered the phone was very rude and said I had to come in and could not do curb side pick up ""because most people don't show up to get their orders"". Stop hiring people who have no sense of customer service! They are ruining your restaurant."
Sean P.,"Ashburn, VA",70,180,65,4.0,7/30/2014,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory (even if I never really get Cheesecake). It's not perfect, but it's always reliable and there's definitely something for everyone on the menu. Speaking of menus, that's exactly the strength and weakness of the Factory. There literally IS something for everyone, but there are so many menu options, choices, variations and choices that if you're even remotely decisive you may ultimately have an aneurism just trying to figure out what you want. Not only that, but every other page in the menu is an ad. What's with that? I'm looking for food, not perfume. Stop that! Further, I don't want to ""accessorize"" my meal with Diet Coke. The wording is very irksome to me for some reason, BUT that's a pet peeve/personal issue. How's the food? Great! Love it. The food is solid, and I've never had anything bad there. I think my favorite dish is the chicken and biscuits. It's massively feeling (and very rich) but I love sharing it with my wife. The flat breads are pretty good, too. The pasta carbonara is also a favorite of mine, too. Again, it's a heartstopper and rich as can be, but delicious! There's so many amazing options that trying to pick one is (again) half the problem. And yes, the cheesecake IS good (though I rarely get it). The portion sizes are so large for main courses that, between the bread, apps and main course I barely make it half way through the meal before I start getting full. All in all: It's pretty good. I'd give it four stars, but the overwhelming menu and the constant advertising is really distracting/frustrating for me."
Maria M.,"Herndon, VA",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2014,"Waiting to be seated: Terrible service. My boyfriend and I, in a group of 20 people, came here for homecoming dinner. Granted the size of our group, and the fact that we WERE NOT allowed to book reservations, we were told there was about an hour wait, just outside the restaurant. It wouldn't have been so bad being that we were with our dates and could take pictures, but it was 2-1/2 HOURS before we were seated! Noisy atmosphere, sluggish service: The atmosphere was faux-classy. Very noisy and crowded and busy. Our orders were taken as quickly as one could expect for 20 people I suppose, but it was still slow. We waited an hour for our food, I'm not sure if that's normal for them or not. It came in generously large portions on nice platters, I'll give them that. Very sweet food! (Not in the good way): I ordered the cashew chicken, thinking it would be spicy as stated, but it wasn't at all! It may be that I'm used to spice, but I think even someone with mild taste would not find it spicy. Much less ""very spicy"" as described in their menu. It was more sweet than anything but it wasn't ""bad"", just not my preference. I couldn't finish the portion even on an empty stomach and I didn't box it up. My boyfriend ordered teriyaki which was even sweeter! Seems to me there is an odd pattern in their menu. Neither of us were ecstatic about our meals. Even MORE waiting!! I think this was the worse part. The service only continued to slow down. my boyfriend and I waited for the check for at least half an hour, waited for it to be collected for another 20 minutes, and he didn't receive back his card and receipt for another hour! This was notorious. I had other things I wanted to do with my night. Even among friends I was growing antsy. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to pay a bill! In conclusion: We were there for a total of FIVE HOURS! At least three and a half of those were from unnecessary waiting alone! I understand 20 people is a lot but that gives no excuse for their slow slow slow service. We could've at least been given a discount or something. And the food wasn't good enough to be waiting that long. I will not be returning to this location any time soon, or at least not with as many people. Granted I would like to try a couple more menu items, I may be retesting their serving skills after a year or so. One more waiting session or sweet meal and I'm done. Thank goodness I had the company of friends to endure this with me."
Tim A.,"Great Falls, VA",1,14,,1.0,12/16/2015,"I got turned away at 9:15 PM, I thought they were open until 10 PM. I know the kitchen needs to close, but I'm pretty sure its open till 9:30, I can order quickly if you say its closing. Or you could offer me take out. Instead of just saying that I can't order."
Karen M.,"Ashburn, VA",54,261,10,4.0,2/13/2013,"Cheesecake Factory...yep I'm a fan!  Lots of salads and California cuisine.  I've had a few different types of their salads at various locations and the quality is pretty much the same. Their menu is huge, so almost everyone can find something.  Pizza, Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers, Pasta, desserts, chicken and fish dishes...its a good casual place to go when you're hungry especially when you aren't sure what exactly you want.   The Sterling location meets the same standards as other Cheesecake Factories. The only complaint I have about Cheesecake Factory is that their tables are soooo close together, its a bit awkward.  (they all are like this, this location is nothing different)   I had the ahi tuna appetizer and arugula salad for dinner the other night. The tuna tasted a bit too fishy, but otherwise was good.  The boyfriend almost always gets the chicken parmesan sandwich, so I'm guessing its a winner!   Decent, large menu, you can always find something to eat!"
