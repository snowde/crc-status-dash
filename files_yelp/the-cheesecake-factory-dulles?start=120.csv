Cindy U.,"Sterling, VA",0,9,,3.0,7/15/2016,The menu always overwhelms me at this place. I worry when I see such a variety (Asian and Mexican) of food on the same menu that it all can't be made well. I've tried many different dishes and the pastas usually turn out right.
Lyna L.,"Leesburg, VA",1,29,24,5.0,1/24/2015,"The food here is absolutely delicious, but the portions are a bit insane. Not in bad way though, I suppose because more is better than less, but it thus requires a higher price. You will likely have to pack most of your order if you want to save room for their tasty variety of cheesecakes. The 5 stars are for the food, timing, cleanliness, and ambience. However, I would give 2 stars to the service. Although the service was responsive, my group's waitress was especially rude. For example, one of my friends asked for change ($4), and after the waitress saw the amount and came back, she sassed, ""Do you *really* need change?"" Even though $4 isn't that much, as a waitress, it was not her place to say that."
Kim S.,"Herndon, VA",0,1,,1.0,4/22/2016,"They've got a scam going.  If you split the check the suggested tips on your receipt are for the WHOLE bill, not for your own food.  SO SNEAKY!  My friend and I weren't paying attention and gave our mediocre server a double tip.  Now I've got to come back in and fix the bill.  WATCH OUT!!!"
Julie S.,"Herndon, VA",0,8,,4.0,8/18/2015,"A bit pricey, so we only go on really special occasions. They offer a free sampler appetizer platter for my toddler, which is fun. The big downside for me, has been the service/wait staff. I've only been once when I had a good waitress. All the other times I had the wrong food brought to my table, been given someone elses check, slow service, two different waiters because one went on break, etc. Not ideal, and certainly detracts from an enjoyable experience."
Matt H.,"Ashburn, VA",9,296,20,3.0,4/1/2013,"Pretty good food.  I had the burrito, which was huge, but it was light because there are a lot of vegetables in it and it was pretty good.  I also had the Oreo Extreme Dream Cheesecake...  OMG!  It's a little cheesecake with a lot of mousse.  I couldn't eat the whole thing because it's very rich, but it's oh so damn good! Our waitress was pretty good and the restaurant was very clean.  The hostess who sat us was cold and seemed irritated for some reason.  I didn't exactly enjoy going through the 21 pages of the menu and the waitress seemed irritated when I asked her what sodas they had.  Sorry, I didn't make it to that page yet.  WTF?!?! Whatever, it's not like we go there often (once every 2 years or so)."
Steven S.,"Loudoun, VA",36,8,4,3.0,10/27/2015,"Crowded. But decent menu options. Food is fairly good but sometimes wonder if offering less items would yield a better overall menu. My wife has often ordered dishes that were best described as ""meh"". Not terrible, but not great. We often stick to the same items and are very satisfied when we do."
Julie N.,"Chantilly, VA",43,8,2,3.0,9/21/2014,"I usually go to the one in Fair Oaks but my boyfriend lives out close to Dulles and he had a gift card so.. Anyways, we came for brunch and we both ordered the Baja Chicken hash which was actually quite good.  I have to say the service was a little not up to par.  Usually we receive bread after we get our drinks at Fair Oaks or even after our order is taken but unfortunately we had to ask another waiter way after our order was taken which I hate doing because I feel like I'm annoying a server who isn't even our server.  We barely saw our server and we didn't get refills on water at all.   One problem did happen which my boyfriend found a curly black hair in his food. We flagged down our server when we did see him and he took it away and brought the manager who comped it off and also offered free dessert which was great!  Definitely a solid three stars. The food is good but the service could definitely be improved."
Vivian D.,"Reston, VA",64,144,434,4.0,4/7/2014,"This place has a wonderful drink menu ranging from cocktails, mojitos, wines, margaritas, beers, specialty drinks, etc...you name it, they've got it!!! The factory peach bellini (peach puree, peach liquor, simple syrup and ice) is absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it. The bartender even showed me how to make it hehe!!!  As for food, we ordered the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, tuna tartare and the BBQ salmon. I really enjoy their tuna tartare appetizer. It was absolutely delicious! Ohmygosh, I've had tuna tartare at high end restaurants in D.C. that don't even compare to the one here. I'm serious guys. As for the Vietnamese summer rolls, four words of advice: do not get it. It was unflavorful and gross. The rice paper wrapper was hard and cold...like it had been pre-made and was waiting in the fridge for us to order.  We sent it back and received another one with the same issue which makes me think it's how the food is made. For our entree, we got the BBQ salmon that I thought was just okay. My boyfriend though enjoyed it very much. It was served over a corn salsa and a side of mash potatoes. The corn salsa wasn't flavorful, and the mashed potatoes could have been better replaced with some seasonable vegetables instead.  Andddddd of course we didn't leave without ordering some cheesecakes to satisfy both of our sweet tooth."
Nikki B.,"Leesburg, VA",0,5,2,1.0,4/16/2014,"The service was horrible. We literally stared at wait staff standing around while we waited for bread and our orders to be taken. When it came, the bread was cold and tasted stale. The waiter said he would have one put in the microwave and it would take 2 minutes. It finally arrived after the meals. Prior to that, we requested new silverware and plates as ours was dirty and the plate had crumbs in it. One of the men picked the dirty silverware up and began shining them and put them back in use! When our meals arrived, they had no flavor despite the sauce and TONS of salt and pepper we added. We had this dish before and it should be loaded with flavor. Instead it looked great and tasted watery. Finally, we waited so long for the waiter to come so I could ask for the check, I put my coat on. We will likely not be coming here again. You've been warned..."
Michael M.,"Leesburg, VA",0,48,,1.0,9/24/2015,"Just called to see if they could take the meatballs from their appetizer menu/sides menu and make us a meatball sub.  Hostess was nice enough to check with a manager but apparently the manager said ""no, we don't have a way to ring that in"".   Really - you can't ring in open food, modify something or figure out a way to accommodate a customer?  This is why we don't frequent these lousy chains and it shows that there is no training for mgmt. other than how to turn the key in the door, count the till and make an employee schedule.  Customer satisfaction - not so much on the important side right guys?    I can only surmise that dinner would have been just as indifferent and lousy so it's a good thing we were told ""no we can not accommodate you Sir""."
M. L.,"Washington, DC",0,65,13,1.0,8/18/2014,"My fiance and I went here over the weekend for a late lunch/early dinner. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of service at this location. Our waitress was very unfriendly. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day, but her greeting had no eye contact or smile. She was sick of us before she even took our order. We ordered two alcoholic beverages, which took way too long to come to the table. We also ordered an appetizer that took 20 minutes to get. Our waitress said she ""is not sure what is going on with with kitchen today"" but she let her manager know that we had to wait  too long for a single appetizer. The appetizer was good (chicken potstickers); however, I cannot say the same for my Salmon Salad. The salad was grossly overdressed and the salmon was in one huge chunk slapped on top. Not very appealing. When our entrees came we requested from the food runner that we get some bread (our waitress never brought us any). He said enthusiastically ""Sure! No problem!"" He was never to be seen again. We would have asked our waitress, but we didn't see her again until after we finished our meal (at which point she filled our empty water glasses with warm water). We noticed that the tables around us were also getting poor service. The table next to us had to order another round of drinks because their first round of mojitos were wrong. The waitress immediately blamed the bartender saying ""he is new"" and took no personal responsibility for the mess up or the wait time. They finally got their drinks after they closed their tab and finished their meal. We were going to order dessert, but really we just wanted to get out of there. I usually enjoy the Chessecake Factory, but I will not be back at this location. I did not encounter one helpful employee here, and will be sure to not recommend this place to anyone I care about."
Kelsey C.,"Poquoson, VA",27,15,,5.0,9/9/2015,Kale salad and their well mannered martini with blue cheese olives are the way to go!
Mark M.,"Sterling, VA",0,5,,4.0,5/11/2014,"Went for brunch on Mother's day. Could only do reservations between 9a -9:45A.D.(??) I always said their menu was too big--took 20 minutes for my dad to decide what to order (then he couldn't remember what he got). My Elvis-style waffle was incredible--light and crispy with bananas and bacon worg a melting peanut butter sauce.Yummy!  Service was a little bumbled, not our waiter's fault, food for next table kept coming to us. And a couple of the steak + cheese's were on really tough bread. But management was on the ball and comped us the two, again thanks to our waiter(tnks,Nick). Overall, food was great. Service was even better. And you can't beat the choices for cheesecake. We'll definitely be going back."
Arushi T.,"Ashburn, VA",71,69,46,1.0,12/19/2015,"Horrible horrible experience second time with takeout! Menu is super overwhelming, food is pretty good but come on guys?!?! How is service lacking and you guys aren't paying better attention to detail? Still awaiting a call back/email from Jared....still waiting a week later on my refund!"
Kalie R.,"Reston, VA",0,4,,2.0,10/23/2016,"I've only had the cheesecake once. I got a few slices a couple months back for a farewell party for my favorite co worker. She loved them, I loved them, the cheesecake is definitely good. I thought the prices are worth the huge amount. However I went in today to treat myself to a slice after working over 24 hours in 48 hours. Online said they closed at 11 this Sunday and I rushed from Reston to get there at 10:30. I came in and saw lights on, people inside, people leaving, doors were open... After a few steps in the to go cashier looks at me and with such disgusted she says we're close. I couldn't hear and she said we've BEEN closed in such an awful attitude. As a manager of a restaurant, I would be APPALLED to hear any of my employees talk to someone like that!! ""At closing hours the machines stop working."" Ive never heard of this at any restaurant myself or friends have worked at. If someone who works here can confirm this I'll add another star and edit the review. Just stick to ""we're closed."" She needs to be retaught decent customer service. There was a much better way to go about saying you're closed and she doesn't know how to say it."
Tristan S.,"Romeoville, IL",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2015,Ordered miso salmon to go. When I realized that I didn't get at least a side of broccoli with such a small portion of rice. Spent a good bit of money for a disappointing meal. I am currently sitting at Outback Steakhouse as I type this review.
Robert C.,"Sterling, VA",88,33,,3.0,6/21/2015,"The food is pretty good.  I went there on Saturday at around 5pm and it was really busy.  It might of been because of fathers day weekend, not really sure.  The service was good, and the food was very good.  I have not been there for quite a while but I would go back again.  Good experience."
Jessica G.,"Reston, VA",69,95,28,4.0,3/2/2014,The Cheesecake Factory has the most impressive gluten free menu I've seen at any restaurant! I've been to this location numerous times and have never had a bad meal. Service is usually pretty great too. They also offer a GF chocolate cheesecake that is to die for. Ridiculously tasty! I definitely recommend this location.
Jennifer M.,"Kissimmee, FL",14,78,73,1.0,4/19/2015,Worse Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too. Hostess was great but the service was awful by our server and the food was cold. Only thing that tasted great was the cheesecake.
Heather G.,"Minneapolis, MN",763,400,205,4.0,5/29/2012,"I went late last week and wasn't too impressed with the edamame beans.  It was missing salt.  Even though I didn't go there for edamame, I needed something to coat my stomach while I downed my alcoholic drinks.  The beans didn't cut it, so I ordered the fried macaroni and cheese balls.  Sounds disgusting, but those things are delicious! The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is the largest, I have ever seen anywhere.  Overall, the food is always good. The portions are huge (always enough for two additional meals) and the HH is always on point for my pocket.  I just wish the HH had better hours.  Back in the days, the cheesecake slices used to be larger.  My favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake."
