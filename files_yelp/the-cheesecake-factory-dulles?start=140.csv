Lola C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,39,,4.0,3/1/2016,"Went there for lunch. With the exception of a little grit in my salad, the food was delicious. The staff was very professional and attentive. I will go there again."
s U.,"Burlington, VT",4,10,1,3.0,1/31/2015,"Middle of the road on both service and food.  I would come back again just not on a Sat at lunch rush,"
Allie B.,"Sterling, VA",0,9,1,5.0,4/13/2016,"Cheesecake, humongous portions, nice atmosphere.....what's not to love? I can't even finish a plate in 3 days!!! That's what I love about this place!!!! My favorite plates: chicken sliders, penne pasta, and the Oreo overload cheesecake. The staff here is also so nice!"
Joann B.,"Fairfax, VA",162,428,133,4.0,7/3/2013,"I think this chain restaurant has been very good across the board.  It boggles my mind how the cooks/chefs there are able to have such an enormous and varied menu and keep the food good.  They've got Asian, Italian, American, steaks, salads, sandwiches, etc etc etc.  This is definitely not a place for someone on a diet, even if you order from the skinny menu! The appetizer dishes are even sized like regular entrees here, so if you want to leave room for a cheesecake slice or two, beware.  Since the menu is so large, I've been trying not to eat the same thing twice, SO, I can only say that I've never been disappointed.  I wish I could describe my favorites to you, but really, you just have to go and see for yourself.  This place isn't some 'out of this world' restaurant, but it's a definite stand by, especially if you're craving cheese cake.   The cheesecakes I've tried:  banana cream, red velvet, chocolate mousse, dulce de leche, vanilla bean, pineapple upside down, caramel pecan turtle, carrot cake.  That's quite a list!  They're all good and of course it all depends on what you're craving but the banana cream cheesecake ranks high up there for me.  :)  They're creamy and really FULL of flavor.  They're so sweet your teeth are likely going to hurt after one bite.  I don't think I've ever finished a slice due to the richness. The service is good, I've not had bad service here yet and I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factories.  They don't have call ahead seating or even take reservations, so be prepared to go there for an early (before 7) or late (an hour or two before closing) dinner; if not, you might be in for a long wait."
Don D.,"Sterling, VA",0,21,,2.0,10/6/2013,"The food is always great -but- some of the wait staff are the reason why I will take my $$$ elsewhere.  Another contributor stated that take out is good - I agree, the food is spot on but have had problems with service.   Recently went there for lunch, after placing orders, waited over 40 minutes with nothing - our meals were salads.  Waitress stood by the POS station, fanning herself with a menu.  Men's bathroom was pretty rough - no soap in dispenser - makes you wonder how the staff were washing their hands before handling your food... Spoke with manager, did not seem to care about the situation - we left w/o getting our food.  Too many other restaurants in the area to visit."
Alex P.,"Longmeadow, MA",83,36,1,5.0,7/6/2015,"Excellent experience.  Our server, Lyndsey, did a great job.  We ate there on July 4th around 6pm.  My wife and I have a 16 month old and usually need to order fast, eat fast and run.  Our server did a great job following our schedule and got us in and out in just over an hour.  We sat in the booth right by the kitchen which most people probably hate, but that table was perfect for us.  Food was delicious, but the attention from Lyndsey made the meal.  Thank you!"
Mike B.,"Leesburg, VA",1,18,,2.0,5/27/2015,Menu selection is good but food doesn't really come out as presented in the menu. The wait service is terrible.  I had to ask for a wait person after sitting at a table for more than ten minutes. This was further exacerbated by having to wait even longer for the mediocre food to arrive.  Don't understand it as they were not busy at the time. This establishment has achieved the apogee of mediocrity.
Chad C.,"Trenton, NJ",2,4,,1.0,2/24/2015,"Food made me sick, decor is putrid, server had an attitude. The only redeeming quality was the margarita."
Rami S.,"Great Falls, VA",174,69,1347,3.0,2/15/2013,"We go there very often as it is our 10-year old son's favorite restaurant. The service is always good, prompt and friendly. The Menu on the other hand is extensive and often confusing to choose from. The corn fritters and the chicken samosa are delicious. I also liked the Pizza but not being a fan of Cheesecake the wrong person to grade their signature item. Overall, a good experience and a nice bar."
Mike F.,"Washington, DC",83,150,60,4.0,7/7/2013,"I stopped by here at 4:30 PM on a Wednesday.  Normally I find this place a tad overpriced but if you come before 5PM it's HAPPY HOUR!  We had three different appetizers for $5 each and I had a decent Mojito for $5.  Started with the potstickers (average, just like Costco's), the factory nachos (decent and huge platter with guacamole and good chips), and the crab wontons (decent, great sauce for dipping).  I also chowed down on the chicken and sun dried tomato pasta which is also at a reduced lunch price of $11.50.  After the waitress added some parmesan cheese it was delicious.  It was not crowded at all and the service was great.  Overall we saved at least $30 and that;s what makes this 4 stars.  I will be going back for happy hour in the future!"
Jessica M.,"Herndon, VA",16,6,,3.0,11/30/2014,"Food was fine. Service was ok too. I don't understand what the issue is with Cheesecake Factory floors. I always feel like I'm going to slip and fall. Bathrooms were gross. Wet floors, toilets not flushed, etc."
Sam C.,"Ashburn, VA",2,52,43,4.0,8/18/2013,"This is not haute cuisine; rather, think upscale diner with an expansive menu to match! I like it that no matter who's with you, everyone can find something they like.  We love their summer rolls and pot stickers, and the their meatloaf hits the spot when you want comfort food!"
Wai T.,"Cupertino, CA",18,127,31,3.0,8/5/2013,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars.  In one hand it's good enough to have 4 stars but not really worthy of the extra mention due to the overwhelming same-ness with other Cheesecake Factory. Quality, food, decor, price: Same as any other cheesecake factory throughout the country.  Same pretty delicious over-portioned food.  Same overpriced virgin drinks.  Same awesome cheesecakes. Very safe bet if you can't find anything else."
Nitin S.,"Reston, VA",27,64,47,5.0,11/5/2014,Been there lot of times for dinner but last visit was for brunch and it was great. Please try GODIVA CHEESECAKE PLEASE PLEASE
Kimberly T.,"Bend, OR",0,198,146,3.0,10/11/2014,A standard Cheesecake Factory with quality  servers but slow and infrequent attention as is common at other locations.    The initial wait was short only 15-20 minutes.  The interior is nicely decorated.  The volume was not too loud.  The quality of food was good and the menu offers so many possible choices that there is something for everyone   Better than most chain restaurants
Faith C.,"San Diego, CA",58,251,49,5.0,6/13/2013,"Good food! I ate at the bar and enjoyed glass of Pinot Grigio - Campanile, Crispy Wrappers Filled with Spiced Chicken. Served with Cilantro Dipping Sauce, Boston House Salad, and Chicken sliders.  I forgot to take home a piece of cheescake - shame on me and it was my Birthday!  I like this restaurant and the type of music they have pumped it."
Pao M.,"Centreville, VA",0,1,,1.0,1/26/2016,"Customer service was so disappoint at the front. This Asian lady didn't know how to greet us, and didn't wanna helps us with a birthday cheesecake.  Definitely lost 3 customers!"
Ashley G.,"Washington, DC",285,199,75,5.0,2/26/2011,"Being a national chain, I'm not about to write an extensive review on the quality of their food and/or service.  There are standards just like at every McDonald's and you like the concept or you don't. Personally, it's one of my favorite restaurants along with CPK. I just want to point out something my waitress did last time I was there---something most servers at any other restaurant always fail to do. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich (so delicious) and asked for it without tomatoes. Our waitress asked me if I wanted the side salad without tomatoes as well. And for that, I am so appreciative.  Everywhere else I go (ie: Red Robin), I order whatever without tomatoes and then get a side salad that turns out to be full of chopped up tomatoes that are too plentiful to pick out and taint the lettuce with their gross taste/guts. I always forget to question tomatoes on salad so I'm so happy that someone at Cheesecake can put together that if I don't like it on my sandwich, I probably won't like it on my salad either!! Thank you so much! Even the little things like that deserve the recognition in my book. I was very impressed and you made my dining experience at Cheesecake even better than it normally is...a stand out from the normal (good), expected service at the chain."
Henry R.,"Leesburg, VA",4,58,2,2.0,1/17/2013,"We came here 30 minute before they close on a Friday night. Been here several times and the foods ranged from good to below average. Service was okay; our server disappeared from times to times and had to ask him to refill our waters. The calamari appetizer was pretty tasty and was never disappointed with it. Our favorite entrée has always been the chicken marsala pasta. Their cheesecakes were pretty yummy as well.  However, our entrees this time was very unappetizing. My girlfriend got the wasabi crusted ahi tuna and I got the hibachi steak. My girlfriend said her ahi tuna was very mushy and wasn't fresh. My hibachi steak (which I have had numerous times and was delicious) was missing the sauce, it was just the steak itself and I had to ask for the sauce separately later. Maybe we caught them on an off day and near closing times. We really liked their mojito though."
Scott L.,"San Francisco, CA",76,560,262,2.0,3/23/2012,"I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time and I was reminded why.  I had the Lettuce Wraps and it was OK, but nothing special.  I then had the Firecracker Chicken and it wasn't spicy and all and overly sweet.  I just couldn't get very excited about any of the food.  The portions are huge and I'm sure there were tons of sugar in my entree, which may appeal to some people, but it's not for me.  The service wasn't very good and our waiter seemed to forget about us on a few occasions.  There's plenty of other good food choices in the area and I don't think I'll be going back here anytime soon."
