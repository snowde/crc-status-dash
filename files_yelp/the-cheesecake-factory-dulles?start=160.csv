David L.,"Vienna, VA",37,176,50,4.0,12/27/2011,"My wife loves this restaurant. We eat here a lot but at the Tyson location.  We normally order our favorites - Diana steak for me and Louisiana Chicken pasta for her.  I tried something different this time, Hibachi Steak, and it's very good.  Their dumplings are very good also for appetizers. We also love the Mojito here.  My favorite is the mango one.   You really can't go wrong eating here.  Their menu is very extensive and there bound to be something that fit your taste. Oh, did I mention the cheesecakes here are really good? :)"
Robert L.,"Live Oak, FL",0,37,3,3.0,11/14/2015,"Went during happy hour 4-6. Prices on the happy hour menu were the same as on the regular menu. My server Andrew was fabulous and very attentive. I sat along barside at a small table for four. Menu was quite extensive making my choice very difficult. Had the sliders for my appetizer and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which was off the chain! I mentioned that not only was it my birthday but I was also active duty Military. Do you think they would offer some sort of discount? Not a chance, as they join many that are more concerned about their bottom line than those who protect the freedom of this country. If there is one thing that often bothers me it is the fact that they will give discounts to senior citizens but not to members of the armed forces. Though there are many establishments that appreciate our service to this country, this is obviously not one of them. This will affect future patronage."
Lisa R.,"Purcellville, VA",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2015,"Went there this evening arrived around 5 place was empty, young waitress brings us to the first table. I stop her and say the table is dirty as the benches.  She proceeds to take us to another booth that is in the beaming sun and just as dirty.  She attempts to clean off table.  We mention the sun and she shuts blinds, next we are looking at menu and the shades start going up so now the sun is beaming on us again.  We ask the waiter to shut the blind he says the table next to us wants it up and we are basically sol!  We get up and leave, stop at desk tell them and she smiles and says thanks for coming!  Are you people that stupid you let paying customers leave?  Never again!"
Paul B.,"Dallas, TX",176,241,2,4.0,3/22/2012,"I know it's a chain. I know that the food is exactly the same at every restaurant, and that should lead me to question if it's really made fresh, or if they're just microwaved bags of food, BUT I can't help it. I like the Cheesecake Factory. I've liked it ever since the first time I went there back in like 1999 or whenever it was. I've liked every single one I've been to, including this one in Sterling. My wife and I go here about once every one or two months, and we always have a good time. The food is good, the service is good, the ambiance is good. I usually get the Jambalaya Chicken Pasta or the Pasta Da Vinci, or the Chicken Marsala. But really, almost everything on the menu is delicious, and it's always more than enough food.  The Cheesecake is five-star delicious every time. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle are two of my favorites, but I have yet to have a cheesecake there that wasn't really delicious. The Key Lime is good, but a little overpowering after the first couple of bights. That might be a good one to get for a group if everyone's only trying a little bit."
Nya A.,"Washington, DC",24,138,142,4.0,5/22/2014,"I love this place...great for groups, the food is delicious, the price is reasonable and above. I love there strawberry salad. The servings is a lot for me so it's nice to share w/ your kids. Great location. Friendly service."
Rita M.,"Tallahassee, FL",232,174,9,2.0,8/18/2012,"For as celebrated of a chain as it is, I am not sure I understand the Cheesecake Factory hype. The dinner menu is extremely monotonous. I went with the chicken alla panna and it was kind of tasteless and dull. I enjoyed the heaping side of mashed potatoes it came with but that should hardly be the high point of a dish. The cheesecakes were extremely tasty, albeit so dwarfed by mountains of whipped cream that I had to scrape off some of the topping to enjoy the actual cake. I wish they would add a fruit element to the vanilla bean cheesecake because it gets super sweet and one-dimensional after a few bites. Two stars off because out waiter looked like he truly hated his existence on Earth and was sweating uncontrollably. I understand that working on a Friday night is no easy feat but a smile goes a long way."
Burcu B.,"McLean, VA",2,13,14,1.0,3/6/2014,Wait times are always really long and the service is terrible! I have been tried other chains and had no issues with others. But this one is terrible! I would not recommend anyone to go there. Try somewhere else!
Wilson C.,"Rockville, MD",0,7,,3.0,9/25/2015,Service and food where great but it took awhile for our food to come out of kitchen.  We went in at 11:15 on a weekday and didn't expect a 1.5 hour meal...we have a little one and wanted to get in and out.
Grace D.,"Leesburg, VA",0,5,,1.0,12/28/2014,"RUBBER BAND cooked into my husband's enchilada!  Seriously, a black or navy colored rubber band cooked into an enchilada that is very light in color.  Wondering how poorly the kitchen is run for this to happen.  My salad, the barbeque ranch chicken was very watery.  There was about 3 tablespoon of water at the bottom.  Needless to say, this salad had NO flavor.  This is my favorite dish at the Cheesecake Factory and have never had any problems at the Fair Oaks location but the Dulles location is horrible.  Not only was the service terrible, they had to expedite my husband's food because of a snafu, perhaps the order was forgotten?  Anyway, worst experience ever at a Cheesecake Factory.  I will never go back to this location."
Ashley A.,"Hamilton, VA",84,115,81,3.0,10/27/2009,"You need to set an appointment to ensure adequate time to examine their menu/next Great American novel.  The portions are ""Fat Bastard"" sized, even the lunch ones.  The service brings to mind lyrics to that Katy Perry Hot and Cold song.  The hostesses and servers give off that ""Blind Date"" kind of vibe; spending lots of time flirting and giving each other the 'come hither' look, complete with off-color thought bubbles and inappropriate under-the-breath remarks.   Other than that, the food has been mostly decent.  Cheesecake is overrated and will blow your entire weeks' worth of calorie allotment.  Stuffed Garlic Rolls = glorified mozzarella balls with enough garlic to offend Edward Cullen.  They really should watch some Chef Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares episodes about what happens when you have a ridiculously large menu of food ranging from random ethnicities spanning one end of the globe to the other."
Peach P.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,14,,3.0,7/26/2014,I love the concept and idea of Cheesecake Factory. I love the ambiance. I love the cheescake but the food is always hit or miss.  The menu is so big that even if you order the same thing twice it always ends up being a different dish.  I think they should scale back the menu and put more focus into fewer dishes. Have 20 or so really great options instead of having 200 mediocre ones.
Nor C.,"Manassas, VA",0,109,7,1.0,12/15/2014,Went on a Monday night place was empty we got drinks and app in the first 10 mind then we sat for 40 mind until the manager came over to say sorry for the delay after another 10 we left
Dino L.,"Sterling, VA",0,9,,4.0,8/25/2014,Cheesecake Factory at Dulles town center is my favorite Restaurant . I always choose  Cajun jambalaya dish and really it always good choice this dish also big enough to share I love it and customer services is great
Greg M.,"South Riding, VA",70,215,,4.0,8/3/2013,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory?  Apparently some don't reading the reviews.  Whenever I come in here I realize this is the cool place for the young teenage set, just like whatever that place was wherever that was back when I was a teen.  BTW, that someplace was somewhere a heck of a lot cheaper.  In any case, I've come to the conclusion that you can generally count on good food at the Chez' factory, and normally good service.   On our most recent outing (out of five or so to this location), we celebrated our 9 y/o's birthday - we did not ask the waiters to do anything, did not ask them for a show, just brought along a couple presents from the family for her to open.  She had such a good time and the waiter made her feel special despite his struggling with English.  He provided excellent service and provided her a nice treat as well.   We really enjoyed this latest trip to the Chez' and  will return for sure.   Specifics:  The Carlton is outstanding when you're in the mood for a filling salad - lots of cheese and fruit to add plenty of taste to your meal.  The feta isn't plentiful - do the waiter a favor and ask him to add some extra feta - will be better that way.  The oranges are a little disappointing (canned?), but the pear, pecans, and everything else is outstanding.  This is my favorite item for sure on their menu.   Again - it's a filling, salad-in-name-only sort of thing, so if you're a dude who just feels that need for roughage, this is an option."
Amber B.,"Ashburn, VA",0,35,,3.0,8/10/2015,Always such a long wait. Food is warm but not the hot temperature I'd prefer. Prices are going up but the portion size is getting smaller.
Aileen B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2488,894,5857,3.0,5/26/2009,"We needed a nightcap after Girls' Night Out (Fri, 5/22) and some birthday shopping for baby sister, so my two sisters and I stopped by for some sweets and a calamari app (what a combo, I know).  The 30th Anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake is a dessert not-to-be-missed!  It consisted of layers of their original cheesecake, chocolate ganache, and moist chocolate fudge cake.  I also detected lovely crunchy chocolate pieces (""chocolate pearls"" according to the online menu) embedded in the fudge cake... mmm!  We also had the Tiramisu cheesecake- always a delight!  I've noticed that TCF has significantly reduced the portions of their cheesecake slices.  The difference is quite remarkable as I clearly recall buying single serving portions to go, which used to take up the entire to-go container, which is cleverly shaped in the form of a dessert slice; the homemade whipped cream used to sit atop the dessert.  The dollop now has its own side of the container, no thank you very much, since you now get half the original size, yet pay original-slice prices.  Boo! Calamari was awesome!  My lithmus test of great calamari is when I don't need to add anything else to the appetizer but a squeeze of lemon juice (and sometimes, not even that!).  Simple, yet divine. Ordered a to-go slice of Fresh strawberry cheesecake for Mom, which no one touched until three days later, and not by Mom, either (you three know who you are!).  Judging by not seeing a single crumb on anyone's plates 60 seconds later, I'd say the cheesecake slice with its two small, glazed strawberries tasted fantastic!  I could be wrong... (I should reiterate that the new serving slices are much smaller than they used to be!) TCF: this easily could've been four stars, but thumbs-down for halving your dessert portions yet retaining original prices!  You could've at least knocked the serving price down one or two dollars..."
Michelle B.,"Clifton Park, NY",2,28,,4.0,5/8/2014,"Met colleague for a drink. We both ordered mojitos - classic. First time I've tried one and I loved it. We also had the Asian chicken wraps, calamari and edamame. All were very good.  Server was excellent and attentive. A bit pricy - $11 for each cocktail."
Mike R.,"Sterling, VA",0,4,,3.0,6/5/2015,Despite what their website says they do not take reservations or do call ahead seating.  Food acceptable.
George N.,"Manhattan, NY",149,172,17,4.0,12/22/2011,"Ive never been a fan of this place, but this time they got everythign right and I was full, just came along for the ride. got fresh squeezed orange juice and it really was server was polite, friendly and knew the menu and delivered his promises two words...velvet cheesecake! kept it for the next day and it was a delight to enjoy slowly, almost got the pineapple upside down cheesecake, the portions were large. ordered a burger medium done and it and the fries were just right, I was satiated, thats all she wrote or cared to write"
Kara M.,"Leesburg, VA",57,105,10,2.0,1/6/2012,"I've been here twice. First time was during the summer. We sat outside. Waitress was super nice. My usual cocktail and louisiana chicken pasta was awesome. The bf got filet also delicious.  Last night we visited because I desperately wanted some avocado egg rolls. From now on I will definitely be requesting a booth from the get go, so we don't have to walk to a squeezed in tiny table next to randoms (at which time I say oh actually we'd like a booth thanks...)  Sooo when our waiter came he seemed all rushed even though we hadn't been waiting long. He wreaked, obviously having just come back from a smoke break. Fab.  I decided to be adventurous and healthy so I ordered a barbecue chicken salad. Every ingredient in this thing looked and tasted like it came from a can. I know the portions are gigantic but that just made it worse... because this salad sucked.  The cheesecake slice that I always end up taking home was good though... Anyway from now on I will be less adventurous and may just end up getting take out to save all the hassle.  Oh and whatever other yelpers have said about parking in the take out spot seems to be true, because I watched someone walk out of LA fitness last night and over to their car parked in the Take Out spot. Nice. Parking sucks because everything noteworthy in this craptastic mall is crammed into the same area."
