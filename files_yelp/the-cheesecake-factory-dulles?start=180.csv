Vitaliy S.,"Reston, VA",0,4,,1.0,4/7/2015,"I do not expect 5 stars from Cheesecake Factory but I don't expect the complete failure either. Food is good but horrible service ruins the experience. Server forgot our drink order so it took 10 min to have it on the table. Forgot one of the dishes we ordered, my wife had to sit with her food getting cold waiting for mine to arrive and finally when it gets there - we still don't even have utencils on the table. 10 min later both items are cold we just getting our silver wear  and now our server is MAD at us....... despairs for 20 min. Dessert? - No thank you! I didn't really care about any of that until when my wife was exiting the padio with the stroller and one of the bussers runs out of the restaurat and slams the door in front of her..... You have a wonderful location cheesecake factory and u have business coming in no matter what just because u are next to the mall. But Luck of good service will take away that extra dollar you can make on the pretty competitive market.  Worst dinner I ever had for my birthday - thats the only resin I'm writing this.  I should just go to the food court in the mall."
Christian S.,"Reston, VA",0,5,,2.0,3/22/2015,"We normally like CCF but the last couple of times it wasn't great. I just expect CCF to have a bit more sophisticated taste. Just greasy nachos, greasy vegetables, and dry bread doesn't make a great meal."
Jeanie M.,"Herndon, VA",37,56,16,4.0,7/16/2013,"I simultaneously love and hate the Cheesecake Factory.  Their food is always fresh, hot, and good, but their portions are huge and the menu is so extensive that by the time I get to the end I can't remember what I read in the beginning.  I find I have to go there with an idea of what I want in mind (burger, pasta, salad, etc) and stick to only those pages. I think their GlamBurgers are second to none. I also really enjoy their selection of small plates because I like to try a little bit of a lot of things.  Recently we went and tried out some of the new menu items they have.  The Parmesan polenta fries are auh-mazing!  Do yourself a favor and get them.  You won't be sorry."
Caroline W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,18,,3.0,2/24/2011,"Like I saw in another review - you should absolutely try to share your entree with someone else! The portions are family sized. I've tried a fair amount of things here, most are just pretty good. Nothing is usually amazing, and some things are just downright disappointing. A lot of their salads are bland, or coated in so much cilantro you can hardly tell the difference between them. The appetizers are just okay as well, such as the avocado rolls. It was almost difficult eating four of them, plus I was full afterward. Stars of the menu? BBQ chicken pizza (rivals CPK, the master). It's great at lunch because you get a reasonable sized pizza paired with a half salad. It's only about $13 because its the lunch menu, yet its still enough to feed two people. They also have some good pastas, but you feel like you've shortened your life by a few years after eating any of them. And of course, the desserts are amazing. It goes without saying that the cheesecake is good, but they also have a cinnamon apple dessert that comes with ice cream that is so delicious you don't know what to do with yourself. The size of it varies, but once I ordered it to go and I swear they gave me at least a pound of food. It lasted me a full weekend, just reheated the apples in the microwave and saving the ice cream in the freezer.  Downsides of the whole place would be that its always packed and lunch and they don't even do call ahead seating unless you're in a big group, and the bread they serve while you wait is just pitiful. Oh and parking isn't fun since its right at the mall (which also provides zero views), but at least its convenient if you have other things to do."
Brian M.,"Ashburn, VA",67,47,19,3.0,2/17/2013,"Cheesecake Factory always impresses me with their consistency.  If you have been to one, you have seen the best they have to offer.  The food there is always good and the staff is very well trained and attentive.  Last time I went I just had an appetizer, the lettuce wraps.  Very good!  the prices are a little up there and the drinks are way up there but every once in a while it is a good place to go for the ambiance.  As I said this one in Dulles/Sterling area is the same in consistency as the one I grew up going to in Jersey.  Over all good chain though!"
Katie M.,"Leesburg, VA",1,29,17,2.0,10/24/2015,"I would not recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone who dines out with their young children or infants. I went last week on a Monday afternoon with some other friends who were moms and their infants. I had called ahead before they even opened to give them a heads up that we would be in with 3 adults and 4 infants (my friend has twins) to be sure they could accommodate us. I was told they would ""figure it out when we got there"". Well when we got there the restaurant was hardly busy and we were made to feel that we were very much an inconvenience. The hostess was extremely short with us as we tried to figure out where to store our strollers since we couldn't take them to the table with us. When we got to the table they had 2 car seat slings available for us to use and then told my friend they couldn't bring any other slings and to just put her twins in the double open ended booth in their car seats (not exactly the safest option). Food was very average, they messed up the portion size on my friends meal, and service was pretty slow for a Monday afternoon. Overall a poor experience."
Justin D.,"Ashburn, VA",435,11,1,3.0,4/12/2011,Decent food at a decent price.  I have noticed the prices creeping up the last couple of years.  Our kids love to go here for the cheesecake.  The menu can be hit or miss depending on what you order.  The service at this particular location has never been very good for us.  We always wait forever to get our food. I usually get the Spicy cashew Chicken as it's safe and pretty good. I've tried a couple of the the other specials like the Crispy Beef and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and was not impressed at all.  The Greek Salad and Fried Calamari are also pretty good if you combine both for your actual meal. Forget about trying to order take out Fri-Sun.  I have tried to go in and pick up my food several times only to have to wait 20+ minutes to pick up food that was already ready on the counter.  I walked out without my food 2 out of three times.
Brooklyn B.,"Manassas, VA",0,40,,4.0,10/22/2014,Great food! OMG the appetizers alone will fill you up. Go there starving. It's a bit pricey but so worth it. My only negative is the terrible seating. You are always nearly elbow to elbow with strangers. They need to redesign the seating seriously but if you can look past that then you'll enjoy your meal. The staff is young and pretty nice also.
M B.,"Boca Raton, FL",71,231,7,4.0,7/20/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet when going out to eat in a larger group. I really love the  food, it's always really good and I find that each dish has a bit of a unique spin to it. The menu is massive-- anyone can find something they like. The desserts are phenominal. I'm not much of a cheesecake fan, but I do reccomend Linda's fudge cake. As long as you're sharing it with someone or taking most of it home in a to-go box. The atmosphere is awesome. It's classy yet casual. The service is usually decent, although I did recently have a lousy waitress. Definitely a safe bet. Good place to go with friends, your family, on a date, etc."
Joe V.,"Ashburn, VA",0,14,1,5.0,7/30/2013,"I've never visited Cheesecake Factory without an excellent dinner and good service.  It is incredible how they are able to have almost every type of food (American, Asian, Italian, and there may be more!) on their menu.  Although I've never ordered off it, I like the edition of the Skinnylicious Menu for anybody on a diet or just does not want to have too much for dinner.  I really recommend the Four Cheese Pasta as a dish; it was so amazing and big a portion I was surprised I was able to finish it (in a good way though!).  It's basically a bowl of penne with Romano, ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses mixed together with a handful of basil leaves.  I had to say it was an incredible pasta and probably the best I've had near where I live!  Of course, the bread basket they give at each table is amazing too, with both white and brown bread together (I usually have the brown). Hence the name Cheesecake Factory, if you're hungry for one of their exclusive cheesecakes, I recommend the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  My family and I have tried a few others, but none of them are like the Oreo Dream Extreme, with layers of fudge cake and Oreo cookie mousse, topped with milk chocolate icing and an Oreo cookie!  Not only that, for every slice of Oreo Dream Extreme you have, 25 cents is donated to Feeding America.  Imagine enjoying yourself for dessert while helping hungry families in America. However, Cheesecake Factory does tend to fill up quickly, so I recommend that you get your name on the list (they don't take reservations) before it's too long a wait for a table! All in all, I would have to say it is my favorite chain restaurant to eat at!"
Leachim S.,"Nashua, NH",125,137,33,5.0,7/15/2013,Fast Friendly Service!  This is one of my favorite restaurant chains and the staff at this CCF was excellent.  The wait was not long at all and the entire experience was great.
Nadine F.,"Brussels, Belgium",347,1076,5,3.0,7/23/2007,"The food here is disgusting, but I really like the cheesecake!  If you're forced to go here for dinner, the only decent thing I've had is the Chicken Madeira, and I would get it again if I have to go.  It's roast chicken on mashed potatoes, which is pretty hard to screw up.  Lord, even the appetizers suck.  How hard is it to make quesadillas?  The salad is terrible too.  What really bothers me is how extensive their menu is.  They have at least 100 different entrees on their menu, and I've only had one thing that didn't suck.  I would really just prefer for them to find 5-10 things that they can make decently, and just serve those.   I know it's a giant chain, but I still love the cheesecake. The tiramisu cheesecake is my favorite, and I think it ties with the plain cheesecake with strawberries on top.  The coffee is pretty good, and even better with the cheesecake."
Taylor K.,"Sterling, VA",3,75,4,3.0,6/2/2014,"I have lived in Sterling my whole life and have tried every restaurant in the area. I have eaten at Cheesecake at the Dulles Mall many times and finally decided to write a review. If you are looking for a wide variety of food (I think they have 260 menu items) and amazing cheesecake then definitely check this place out. The service can be so-so and I wouldn't say they do any 1 dish amazing, out of this world, 5 stars, but everything I have ordered has been decently solid. I'm a simpleton, so I usually get the burgers, pizzas, or pasta dishes; all are pretty good. They have Brunch of Sunday and the breakfast food is very good; Monte Cristo sammy is on point. For cheesecakes, I would recommend the Ultimate Red Velvet or the Tuxedo Cream. It can be a little pricey, but its definitely worth a visit; bring your appetite!  Food is 3*, cheesecake is 4*"
Matt N.,"Ashburn, VA",29,21,2,1.0,8/1/2009,"Why. do. they. serve. so many different types of food?  I don't think I've had anything that would make me want to go back, with exception to the cheesecake.  And my damn cholesterol won't allow that very often.  I agree with the sentiment of a previous review stating they should grab a handful of things from the menu and try to make them taste less like salt and overbearing sauce, more like something you can identify some flavors from. I also don't get why one portion is big enough to feed three of four girls from the Facts of Life--Natalie can tackle her own plate I'm sure.  Even the side salads are massive...why?  At the risk of sounding un-american, it's just a grandiose waste of food.  I can't imagine how much food is trashed by the end of an average day, whether it's by the restaurant or people who take leftovers to go. The service is hit or miss... I never actually feel like going to Cheesecake Factory, it's usually because someone else decides that's where they're going and I'm tagging along.  There is too much good food in the NoVA/DC area to waste time, money and toilet paper on this one... If you just want cheesecake, by all means....otherwise, fuhget it."
Dwayne H.,"Ashburn, VA",71,67,2,2.0,3/17/2010,"Giving it two stars because the Buffalo Blasts are freaking awesome. The cheesecake is pretty good too...the rest needs work. If you have any food allergies, I would suggest immediately asking to speak to a manager.  Show him your Epi-Pen and make sure he realizes that if you eat something you're allergic to, you might die.  Apparently, that's the only way to get them to take a food allergy seriously.  Our server actually had attitude when we asked if something contained eggs.  God forbid that she would have to walk to the kitchen and ask a simple question.  In the time that it took her to roll her eyes and scoff, she could have asked...the manager did accommodate us, got us a new server and made sure that my wife's dishes had no eggs.  Still, I just don't understand why people aren't more accommodating or accepting of food allergies. All of that aside, some of the appetizers are good, the cheesecake is pretty good...they have beer and TVs...and some of the 6000 entrees are OK.  All in all, hit or miss, if you have allergies, hope that you get a server who cares."
Karen S.,"Danville, CA",13,52,1,4.0,4/16/2012,"This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory and I was impressed.  We were greeted and lead to a table right away.  Our server was helpful, made suggestions that were good and kept checking in on us. I had the Steak Diane and sauteed spinach. I'm not sure if it was because I was very hungry, but the spinach was some of the best I've tasted. We finished up with a slice of red velvet cake, which was truly divine!"
Mandi H.,"Washington, DC",1,23,1,1.0,10/11/2014,Tonight was bad from the start. A waitress pushed me out of her way while I was holding my baby just to get to the cheesecake counter while I was waiting to put my name on the list to be seated. The obviously annoyed manager couldn't follow the lines order and put anybody's name on the list that pushed to the front. I will say the only pleasant part of the night was our patient waiter Noah P. He took his time while taking our order. I ordered something that wasn't on the printed menu and my husband had questions about his meal. He never seemed unwilling to help even though the place was slammed and his other table was obviously giving him a hard time about canceling their order after their food was already made. You would think yummy cheesecake would make the night better until we got in line and witnessed the cheesecake server eat the carrot cake crumbs with his gloved hand and then prepare someone else's cheesecake while wearing his saliva coated glove and chomping his gums. We got out of line after that. I've worked in the food industry before and I get it. Things happen but you NEVER put your hands on a customer and you NEVER break food safety/public health laws!
T B.,"South Riding, VA",0,16,,4.0,5/23/2014,"First time at this location. Loved it!!! As usual, you get a plate full of delicious food so loosen your belts, sit back, and enjoy. Ordered the enchaladas and couldn't finish it all, so it went home with me. Wait is a bit long, but worth it."
Kim M.,"Washington, DC",11,57,11,5.0,1/27/2012,"Really good.  We had one of their specials, mahi mahi with artichoke and caper sauce, and their baked chicken.  Both excellent.  Good sized servings for a very good price, I'm looking forwards to my tasty leftovers for lunch.  Will definitely go there again."
Dee C.,"Gainesville, VA",38,48,16,5.0,2/22/2012,I love love their Santa Fe salad. Good service and tons of healthy options.
