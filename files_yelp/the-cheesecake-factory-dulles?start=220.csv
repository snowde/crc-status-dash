M T.,"Washington, DC",0,29,,1.0,9/11/2012,"For a chain restaurant, the selection is ok... but the review here is for the horrible manager that served us tonight.  I don't know why she's working at a restaurant... let a lone wears the title as MANAGER... if she has trouble with large orders??? She was fumbling with the plates and had a terrible attitude with us when she couldn't remember who ordered what dish. Even with 3 extra servers helping her, she was completely incompetent and downright rude as we tried to assist her with the orders.  Seriously... I couldn't believe how unprofessional and inept she was.  I would never come back to this location again... as long as she's managing the place."
Tasos V.,"Herndon, VA",49,12,121,5.0,1/13/2011,"We like coming here as a family once a month due to the nice atmosphere and great portions.  The waiter service is always friendly and we always leave full.  Their menu is a little too large though, sometimes it feels like a book but everything is good and needless to say, great cheesecakes!"
Brock S.,"Sterling, VA",0,7,,4.0,2/13/2013,I love Cheesecake Factory.  I only gave it four stars instead of five because the food is too rich.  You need to be extremely active to be eating this type of food on a regular basis.
Pamela E.,"Purcellville, VA",40,49,,4.0,6/5/2012,"Fantastic food- which is sort of the norm for the Cheesecake Factory. Portions are pretty large though, particularly the kids menu items. We ordered a ""cup"" of soup and it came out in a bowl! (We asked the waiter if that was the cup and he said yes, so we did confirm that we ordered correctly.) Also, we sat outside and after the sun went down it got chilly, so we asked them to turn on a heat lamp- none of them worked; so we had to move inside. Staff was super-friendly, attentive and fast.  Overall a great dinner experience."
glori b.,"Orlando, FL",45,83,5,5.0,1/11/2009,"I have been here a few  dozen timesso so depending on who you get the staff seems overwhelmed.The food makes up for it and its always got a crowd. I think the service is  touch and go but the food is great.The ambience is beautiful .I love the architecture  and lighting here. Everyone I know loves it here.I am often alone or with  my baby so I dont get to go here much as I would like as they frown on strollers in the restaraunt at the table. ,.I like the shrimp scampi and the chicken  maderia combo.The grilled chicken w cheese and mushrooms is DELICOUS.My party ordered mahi mahi and miso salmon.I love the avocado eggrolls.I like the buffalo appetizer.I like the tamale corncakes.I like the calamari.I like the quesadillasI love the fries..I ordered a bottle of the cheesecake factory wine its only 30 and delicious for such a low pricde,My martini was very strong.The sangria is outstanding.I ordered a combo with steak diane and shrimp scampi once and second time shrimp and chicken and salad .I also have had the tex mex tacos.Great food, service. and sauces.They were  out of two things I asked for to order  and coffee  so manager came by apologized and comped my moms dessert not even asked. The second time I ate here I had same eggrolls,a dirty martini and a burrito dish.The cocktails are divine.The appetizers are tantalizing.The salads are fresh.The service is fancy and prompt .The cheesecake is of course fabulous.This place is always hopping.Its pricier then some casual places but its very classy and medium upscaled /casualish but I think its fair priced and consistent.Never disappinted,I RARELY find coupons or deals here but if you dont have to discount to get people to dine I guess I wouldnt either! I have eaten here before by myself at the bar.I always order the avocado eggrolls they are outstanding really truly original unlike so many chains they have excellent orgininal appetizrs not just wings, spinach dip and fried cheese.I also normally get salad .I  normally dont order dessert but taste other people in my party and its speechless delicious.Which is why eating alone sucks.I could just eat eggrolls and drinks and be happy.The cakes and cheesecakes are drool worthy so many varieities.Last time I was here I had white raspberry choc latte to top my meal Outstanding best latte I ever had.Amazing!And if you like dessert try to come here just pick one!Recently I went here April 23 09 and the service was self seat and slow in the bar,confusion on who was waiting , we had to ask for a menu, but the food was OUTSTANDING.The shrimp scampi knocked my socks off as usual its undescribably good. I used the sauce for my fries its really delicious and consisently good.My party ordered pork chops and did not care for them overall I lked my food more.I am adding Cheesecake for lunch to my menu of places I really enjoy  as I noticed they have nice lunch entrees."
Gem S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",97,116,36,5.0,8/28/2008,Food was excellent.  They have a very big menu which I love.   We had a very big family gathering here and our waitress was so friendly and was able to take care of my 15 family members on her own.  Needless to say...she got a $200 tip that night.
Janice Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,62,10,1.0,7/29/2013,"My family and I came back from the Cheesecake Factory tonight and I have to say this dinner experience has been one of the worst service we have ever had at your restaurant.  The dinner service started out well...we were seated within 10 mins of arrival and the server provided us with our drinks and bread.  However shortly after taking our order, the service went downhill.  Our menus were stacked up high on our table and left there for approx 15-20 minutes.  Our empty water cups were never refilled (even though the server had the water pitcher in his hand at one point and refilled water for another table).  We had asked for more bread while we waited for the main course to arrive. The server acknowledged the request but the bread never came.  We had to flag down our server 25 minutes later while we were already half way into our meals and made a second request for some bread.  The server nods and came back with a basket of bread 10 minutes later (to which we had just finished our meal).  Not once did the server ask how our meal was.  We had to flag down the server to order our desserts.  The dirty plates were left on our table for a good 15 minutes until our desserts finally arrived.  We also had to wait a long time to get and pay for our check.  While the server is a nice guy, he seems inexperienced and very preoccupied which made it very difficult for us to enjoy our dinner.  Being a family of three, we had expected to be in and out of the restaurant within an hour however we ended up sitting in the restaurant for over 2 and a half hours, mainly waiting for our server.  We are extremely disappointed with tonight's dinner service at the Cheesecake Factory and wished we had chosen another restaurant for dinner."
Justin S.,"Washington, DC",270,301,27,1.0,7/23/2007,"This restaurant epitomises my distaste for humanity.  When I moved to the area, I'd meet people, they'd invite me out, and I soon realized that people who turned out to be boring, thoughtless zombies all picked The Cheesecake Factory as their favorite place to eat & meet.  The menu items, like the people who love them, are bland, over-salted, dull imitations of much better products found elsewhere. High prices, giant portions, syrupy mixed drinks, and a pseudo-cultural facade round the place off nicely.  The cheesecake's pretty good."
Rebecca J.,"VA, VA",23,31,,4.0,2/9/2007,"I would give the Cheesecake Factory at Dulles Town Center a five star rating if it weren't for their slow service.  I have been to this location three times and have consistently received extremely slow service.   They have a delicious frozen drink called a Peach Bellini - good luck getting one though!  It takes an act of God to get one in less than 10 or more minutes after ordering it.  I've had different waiters each time I have dined here so I really don't understand what the hold up always is!  No wonder they have a 30 - 45 minute wait on weeknights, they can't turn any tables!  The waiter just sort of disappears for a few minutes at a time... Now on to the food, I have to say that their menu is huge and extensive and so I like to try something new each time I go.  Entrees and appetizers I have thoroughly enjoyed include the chicken tenders, chicken piccata, chicken caesar salad, crab wontons, and the house salad with vinaigrette.  Last night I tried the new California Salad which is one of their new ""weight management"" salads.  It was huge and came with a low cal mustard vinaigrette.  Usually, I do not enjoy low cal salad dressing, but this one was actually really good!   The Cheesecake Factory has awesome food and it's a great dining experience, and they have a huge variety of cheesecake for dessert, if you can save room for any, because their portions are HUGE!  I have to say, I love cheesecake, but I don't really enjoy their Cheesecake - makes no sense huh?  So, I usually skip dessert when I go here.  Enjoy!"
Sarah S.,"Mountain View, CA",0,344,,4.0,7/13/2011,The portions here are so big we just order appetizers and eat them for our meal.  Food tastes good too.
Mary L.,"VA, VA",55,297,2,4.0,4/15/2007,"Four stars only because the wait is easily 70+ minutes on the weekend. Aside from that, the food is DELICIOUS. I recommend ANYTHING on the menu. Additionally, it's a good idea to share entrees because they usually give you enough food for a small village of Children. In America, that means that it will probably satisfy 2-3 people. The appetizers are also amazing and they could be meals in themselves. I would recommend splitting them between at least 4-5 people. Oh and, if you go here, make sure you round off the marathon of food with a slice of their famous cheesecake. I've tried 5 different kinds and have liked them all. I've never considered myself a fan of cheesecake until I had some here. They have tons of different kinds but my favorite have been the Khalua Coffee, White Chocolate Raspberry, and Godiva Milk Chocolate Cheesecakes. And yes, those combinations ARE humanly possible! :)"
Katie M.,"Lansdowne, VA",46,292,12,3.0,9/5/2009,"3 Stars for a recent visit to the bar for a drink and a snack. They had a nice wine list ('spensive for someplace that prides itself in a dessert item), a few beers on tap (22oz was 7 bucks...holy what batman?), and a nice offering of small plates and appetizers (we missed happy hour by 20 minutes, but that wouldn't have helped much, as they only have food specials, no deals on drinks. The bartender was prompt, nice enough to understand that we really weren't into eating a whole meal, and made some recommendations of a few of the smaller plate items. We settled on a pizzetta (a small flatbread-like thing- a little too small for 5 bucks), and it was super tasty. They were also generous with the house offering of bread. We followed up with a piece of ""adam's peanut butter cheesecake"" to take on the road (which did take forever for the bartender to go and get....should've picked it up myself on the way out). So, a few beers, pizettas, and loafs of bread later, we left carboliciously fat and happy....by the look of the entire menu, I guess that's what's supposed to happen??"
Hannah M.,"Frederick, MD",0,65,,5.0,8/26/2010,I met my daughter here for dinner the other night. We had a wonderful table with no wait.  The two appetizers we had were great (stuffed mushrooms & fried zuchinni.)  We each had an entree which were both very large so we brought them home for lunch the next day. The cheesecake was fabulous!  We had no issues with the service. We were well attended to and left very satisfied.
Merce Jacqueline M.,"Annandale, VA",0,4,,2.0,12/14/2007,"The food here isn't great and worst of all, it's SO FREAKING EXPENSIVE!!!! I only come once in awhile because of the cheesecakes. I've tried their Cheesesteak sandwich once and it was disgusting. It was dry and the bread was insanely hard. The fillet mignon was pretty good though. But it's WAY too expensive for my taste! I'd rather go to Outback or Silverados and get my money's worth.  The service isn't that great either. The waiters and waitresses are not so friendly. They don't seem to care too much for the customers.  The restaurant's atmosphere is pretty nice. It's very romantic and classy. Too bad the food sucks!"
Jason K.,"Henderson, NV",0,13,1,4.0,8/11/2010,"Food was good, but it took almost an hour for a couple sandwiches to come out. The manager was nice and offered a free bowl of soup, but when i declined offered nothing off the bill. The cheesecake as always was delicious. Overall still great."
Star H.,"Arlington, VA",0,22,,1.0,2/21/2010,"Only went twice--once when it first opened and then one time later to see if they'd finally gotten their act together.  Nope, they hadn't, so won't be back.  Hate the seating arrangements--feel like I'm sitting on top of the other people at the next table.  Menu is way TOO extensive to have anything good.  Also makes me think they just heat up food--don't do any real cooking.  I ordered the things that I normally like and they were just very bland, mediocre...bleh.  I don't understand why there is always a line here, cuz the food is bad--except for the cheesecake, of course."
Rick B.,"Sterling, VA",0,12,,2.0,5/22/2010,"As noted by many others, the size of the menu is gigantic, as are the portions. Um, but after that, it goes downhill fast.  Everything I've tried has been appalling, not in a ""Oh my god, this is nasty"" way, but in the ""this has no finesse, no taste at all"" kind of way.   For example, I tried their ""Shepherds Pie"", and the vegetables (carrots, onions, etc) weren't cooked, they were raw, or blanched at best.  Think about that for a second - in making a pan sauce, what kind of flavor can be extracted from uncooked vegetables?  I had to douse it in salt just so I could tell I wasn't eating (crunchy) library paste - just hamburger in water ""sauce"" with raw shredded carrots.  There was another entree (so unmemorable I can't remember what it was) that was identical, raw vegetables rather than cooked, and no flavor as a result.  I tried roasted chicken (was overcooked and dried out before I got out of bed that morning), fish tacos (same, dried-out fish, no taste) - seriously, every entree I've tried just had no flavor.  Maybe just bad luck / bad choices on my part, maybe there's goodness to be found on that vast wasteland of a menu.  But I've given up trying - I don't feel the need to go on such a fishing expedition when I have to pay for it, and have been disappointed with every previous attempt.   The cheesecakes are mostly quite good, and on occasion, I'll just go in, (torn between pity and contempt for all those waiting for tables), and buy a slice of cheesecake to go (they're no bargain, but you only live once; you gotta indulge once in awhile, right?)  As noted, they *have* reduced the size of their slices (but not the price.)  And I did get Red Velvet cake that was definitely not fresh.   Which brings me to a second point, mentioned by another reviewer.  Invariably, the servers behind the counter are far too busy flirting with each other, or talking about their plans after work, to actually provide any service.   I mean, I get it, I was a teen-ager once, (admittedly, back during the last Ice Age), but you're working, or at least, are theoretically being paid to work, so put the hormones on ice once in awhile - space it out, you know?   Try to work 5 minutes, take a 2 minute ogling break, then back to work.  And what's particularly irritating is that they all have this attitude that they're runway models, just there to look good, and actually working isn't required.  I've got news for you kids, you're high-school students, the job you're working isn't particularly prestigious,  and frankly, you're just not that hot.  So keep it together, work the register, and just bring us our dam cheesecakes! Table service isn't usually something to complain about -- but when it's consistently unprofessional, it has to be mentioned.  And so it is - consistently sub-par and unprofessional.  Funny, someone mentioned an issue with the bill - twice I've had problems there, once when I was brought the wrong table's bill, and once when I was charged for an item we hadn't ordered.  And, of course, the waitress was miffed with *me* for pointing it out.  And I've also had the experience of overhearing servers complaining about patrons, and other servers, and other misbehaviors. I guess the ultimate description of how I feel about this place is this - once I was invited to attend a birthday dinner for a co-worker, with the tab being picked up by my company,  I feigned illness, and bought my own dinner.  That's right, I passed on a free dinner here to pay for my own somewhere else. If you order anything more than coffee and cheesecake, you're probably making a mistake."
Iced V.,"Fairfax, VA",51,48,,1.0,11/21/2008,I didn't expect much but CF disappointed me again.  I would've like a meal at Wegman's over this.
Paddy D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,149,1,2.0,8/23/2008,"I used to work here, the portions are great but the food is just average americana, and at this particular one, the service is horrible."
Kate R.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,263,1,1.0,3/25/2008,"the ice cream was pretty good. the food was awful.  the salad was yuck, the burrito was yuck (i went with my sis, she loves this place, but not the sterling location), but the ice cream was decent.  but really, ice cream is like pizza, you can't mess that up (unless of course you are ceecee's)"
