Kiran K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,5,1.0,6/18/2017,Took over an hour to get out order out still waiting on drink after an hour. Always have RUDE employees . Finally I get my drink and it's made incorrectly. I get more attitude for saying something. Then I get told it's not this one until I show the employee the ingredients from the menu and then get more attitude. Won't be back not worth the rudeness!
Melissa H.,"Arlington, VA",1,7,9,4.0,7/11/2016,Our go-to spot for special occasions.  A bit pricey and always crowded but - what can I say - the family wants to go there. Burgers are awesome.  So is the meatloaf. Portions are so big we usually have to take our cheesecake desert to go.
Candice K.,"Hamilton, VA",122,35,72,5.0,5/17/2016,"I am giving 5 stars solely because the waitress I had on my bday yesterday was perfect. The hostess not so much, she had an attitude towards us because we did not want to sit in this side corner area that honestly is probably the worst seats in the restaurant. We didn't care about waiting we were here to celebrate my bday since I am a cheesecake fanatic. BTW there was only 4 of us not very challenging to find better seating when available.  Back to the server. She was awesome, so upbeat and on top of everything. One of the best servers I have had ever. I don't really know how to describe how great she was but she made our experience even better. 5 stars for her!"
Diana S.,"Tucson, AZ",8,32,19,2.0,2/7/2017,"First off let me start by saying I love Cheesecake Factory. However the one in Dulles has 3 times now been disappointing! First visit my salmon was ""burnt"" so they had to remake it. We were on our way to work and don't get to eat our food because it took so long. Manager did say sorry and brought us the new one. We were just beside ourselves like it was no big deal. Sidebar- they weren't busy. Oh well can't win em all.  Next time I was by myself came to bar and had stuffed mushrooms (Delish) and 2 drinks. The bartender a light skinned guy with long braids was bar tending. He seemed less than interested in serving me or the other patrons aside from two younger people who he clearly knew. My thought was what bartender has this much attitude with out even talking to you. I asked for check and left without finishing my second drink. Tonight I am sitting here and the same bartender is here. I walk up and the bar is cluttered with empty glasses and trash. I go to the further end and ask if the seats are open, he states no I think they went outside. Now the signed CC slip and the empty glasses told a different story. So I squeeze oddly between two young men  and another woman sitting by herself. Needless to say the seat I wanted was empty no one ever came back and sat. Back to story. He asks what I want to drink. I get a tea he sets it down and walks off. Just an attitude like I am lucky he is serving me. Never offers me a menu. So luckily I wanted my foto miso salmon. So as he ignores me more. I finally say excuse me may I order the miso salmon. It comes he never asks how it was. The brown rice was undercooked. It made me sad 2 times now I came in for my favorite dish and 2 times I didn't eat. I say may I get this boxed up and he says I can give you a box. So I packed up my salmon and began to write this post. Who ever this bartender is he should learn that a job in customer service means you have to offer customer service... talk to your customers... smile.. if he is too talented for this position maybe he should move on instead of making my dinner unenjoyable. I think I will stick to the fairfax location as they have never let me down... sorry folks but if you are looking for the consistent delicious Cheesecake Factory you are used to don't go to the one at Dulles mall...."
Julie H.,"Reston, VA",132,99,382,3.0,1/14/2016,"I like Cheesecake Factory but this location isn't as good as the one located in Tyson galleria mall. The service is decent, they take your order, bring your food, checks up on the customers needs maybe once and after that you gotta look for them for anything else you need and to get you bill. Because of the food I give them three stars...if the food was good as the tysons location I'd give at least four stars. My favorite is chicken bellagio. But every time I order at this location, it's either really salty or pretty bland. Portion is always same which ever Cheesecake Factory location you go to. Chicken enchiladas was ok too.  Most disappointing entree was shepherds pie. It was so salty. Another dish that was disappointing was their orange chicken. I was hoping it'd be more crispy with tangy sweet spicy sauce. But it was bland and slightly soggy. I've ordered avocado eggrolls, which was ok. Not as crispy as it should be. Their fried calamari was pretty decent, crispy as excepted."
Kelli A.,"Ashburn, VA",350,91,44,4.0,8/25/2016,"Once you've had one Cheesecake Factory, you've had them all. So, instead of talking about the food too much, I'll comment on the customer service.  Briefly, the food is okay. Extremely ""heavy"" and filling, but also a million calories, so yeah.  The service is great. I had my first ""issue"" a few visits ago where the salmon had an awful taste--not normal for this location at all! Steven, the manager, quickly came over and apologized. He offered me another meal and also a slice of cheesecake."
Melinda K.,"Herndon, VA",27,1,1,1.0,5/5/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight with my boyfriend. We sat in the bar to avoid a wait. The waitress took our drink and food orders. When the drinks came, the waitress set my boyfriend's beer down on a plate causing it to fall over and break the glass. Glass and beer went everywhere, including all over my jeans. The waitress asked if she did that, attempting to take the blame away from her, but barely apologized. She offered to move us to a different table, but for whatever reason, she made us wait for a table to be cleaned when there was an open one right next to it. We sit down and she asks if we need more silverware...we had used the napkins to try to wipe down the beer and she asked after everything had been already cleared from the table we left...so unless we plan on eating with our hands, yes we do. We waited several minutes, but she did not come check on us or bring over bread. I got the attention of the manager and told him what had happened. I said that we are waiting on our bread and I would like them to take care of the cost of the beer considering I was wearing it. He said he would take care of it. As I expected, the bread came out seconds before the food. I hadn't even buttered my piece before having to make room for my plate. The waitress wasn't attentive, even after spilling beer all over me. The bill came and the beer was on there. Glad that I had to sit through dinner with wet pants and the manager couldn't even do anything about it. Worst experience and I will not be going back."
Lee M.,"Mineral, VA",0,2,,1.0,5/4/2017,"After I found a piece of a used band aid in my iced tea, you want me to contact you. Let me guess, your sorry it happened,  you think I have a right to be upset, you've spoken with the staff, and please give us another try."
Amanda G.,"Herndon, VA",219,279,8,2.0,5/31/2016,"Not a fan of that ridiculously large menu. For someone who has a hard time making decisions, it's very daunting.  Our waiter was strange...he had a VERY sharp, brusque personality that could have been almost joking, but nobody thought he was. He gave an air of pure impatience and annoyance, each time he spoke to us we were left speechless with his demeanor, not sure if he was making jabs at us or if that's just the way he is. It made me feel pressured into making a decision and I made some that I sincerely regret. I would have had a much better review to write if it weren't for his attitude...we thought about asking to be moved to a different section but we really loved the seat we ended up in so we thought we could deal with it. I regret not moving. Drinks: I got the Pineapple Moscow Mule which for some odd reason came in a large glass instead of a mule mug, and it was watered down by all the ice within mere minutes and I had to chug it to get my money's worth. It was tasty but would have been much tastier with an actual mule mug, if you don't want to spend the money on the right drinkware don't offer the drink! They also don't list the prices of their drinks which I'm not a fan of.  Food: For an appetizer I chose potstickers (a rushed decision because I felt I was taking up our waiters time) and they were mediocre at best. My friends liked them but I was not impressed. They got some kind of avocado egg roll which was really a guacamole egg roll, they enjoyed it but I thought it was too much. We came in seeking brunch which they did not offer on a Monday, I kind of figured that would happen, but found it odd that they didn't just include the brunch menu items with their breakfast menu since they already offer a ridiculous amount of dishes. Their breakfast menu was almost all omelettes and a sandwich, which I got (again, not really in the mood for it but the waiter was putting the pressure on for me to decide) and it was a big waste. The sandwich tasted fine but it was ENORMOUS (I learned all of their dishes are extremely over portioned) and I took two bites before just giving up. It was just not what I wanted and was terrified of asking for something else because of our waiter's extreme personality. It was partially my fault for not having the, er, gumption to ask for more time to make a decision but the times he did come back he would say something to the extent of ""did you FINALLY decide on something??"" how can you expect anyone to make a snappy decision on a menu with hundreds of choices?!"
Jeff C.,"Alexandria, VA",426,837,912,5.0,9/24/2015,"Ok, Ok, It's a chain, and if you have seen one, you have seen them all, but this Cheesecake Factory seems to be better than most. Perhaps it is the friendly service behind the bar, or the yummy $5 dollar appetizers that make you forget they serve cheesecake, but whatever the reason, I'm down with this cheesecake castle. Yeah, that's right, I'm going to rename this one the castle, because every time we come here, I feel like they give us the royal treatment. Another thing I love about their appetizers is that just a few plates can make a pretty tasty meal for two people; A plate of Cuban egg rolls and fried calamari and you're good for the day. In many ways, The Cheesecake Factory's appetizer roundup is simply the tapas bonanza that any foodie needs...fried macaroni and cheese! be still my foodie heart."
Cameron H.,"Sterling, VA",4,918,1,3.0,7/31/2017,Service is a bit slow even on the non peak times. However they are very nice. The calories at this chain is thru the roof. One meal is almost your daily nutritional intake. The skinny menu does taste good however
Shaz A.,"Herndon, VA",0,17,10,2.0,2/15/2017,"Why do I come to this place? The service is truly an ongoing issue at this establishment (quite a few issues in the past). The server forgets my order, and when I brought it to his attention he didn't apologize or offer anything to fix it. My kids were done with their meals so it was really frustrating. I wish I had the energy to contact the manager but was exhausted. I hate I spent my money here. Thumbs down."
Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",120,400,592,3.0,10/25/2014,"As usual, I came to the Cheesecake Factory fully intending to only order a piece of cheesecake and a coffee, but somehow got talked into ordering food, which I knew would probably fail my taste buds and my wallet. I'm not sure why I keep coming back here and eating because the food is so overpriced for what winds up sitting on a plate in front of you. It's really quite tragic. As for their cheesecake, it's stellar, you could probably talk me into buying a single piece for $15. I wish the Cheesecake Factory only sold cheesecake and did away with the rest of the menu. Maybe they can keep their appetizers, but their novel of a menu could definitely be downsized quite a bit. I know I've said this before, but this time I really mean it. I'm only ever coming to this restaurant for dessert."
Christine T.,"Reston, VA",66,674,203,4.0,9/4/2015,"I think they changed the menu again as the hostess alluded to. But honestly the menu is still pretty big I don't ever recall the last dish I had when I was there before. They have stuff to please just about anyone. Tonight I had the southern fried chicken sliders which I love. It comes with lettuce, tomato, and pickles on the side so you can add them to your sandwich if you like. For a Friday service was good the wait staff was attentive."
Joe C.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",4,31,6,2.0,8/28/2016,"Food was good, no big complaints. The problem was the condition of the bathrooms. Particularly the family restroom. Empty toilet paper rolls, trash on the floors, overflowing trash can etc... Not acceptable for a place producing $160 bills for a family dinner."
Mel J.,"Ashburn, VA",1,48,85,4.0,7/27/2016,I like this location personally. Sure the wait is long but when is it ever not long? Lol but food is usually good and the service is pretty decent. I recommend the strawberry short cake or Apple crisp for people who aren't a fan of cheesecake
christine s.,"Clifton, NJ",1,15,,1.0,8/4/2017,We sat near the kitchen where they set the food out and there were flys and gnats all over the window to the kitchen. Disgusting!
Amy R.,"Herndon, VA",14,151,35,4.0,11/18/2015,"Usually dine here for lunch since near where I work.  Always quick to get seated and service is usually good.  Menu is large and overwhelming so it's best to zone in on the Skinnylicous menu or just the lunch menu and forget the rest.  Too much to look at and it just gets confusing. Today I had the Skinnylicous chopped salad.  It's always a good standby salad for me.  Has some chicken, apples, bleu cheese and chopped lettuce and veggies with a tasty dressing.  Most of their salads are good.  I recommend asking for the dressing on the side.  They tend to overdress their salads.   They are usually okay with special requests - one in our party picked off certain ingredients of her salad and added others from another she saw she liked and they were happy to accommodate so don't hesitate to ask for what you really want if you don't see it on the menu!"
Rick R.,"Great Falls, VA",382,183,351,2.0,5/5/2016,"I generally like their food -- until this carryout order.  (I'm a regular lunch carryout because my office is so close.) Grilled chicken on Fettuccini was the choice for today.  It was about as expected, except for the horrible chicken gristle in every bite.  It completely ruined my lunch experience. Other meals here have been fine.  Nothing to glow about.  But not bad.  So why only two stars?  Because I think their prices are a tiny bit too high for the quality.  And their menu is definitely WAAAAAAAY too big, in my opinion. I'm just jilted, because I had such a horrible chicken experience today."
Lauren L.,"Purcellville, VA",165,27,9,2.0,5/17/2016,"Love the food at the cheesecake factory, but the service here is DEFINITELY lacking. I went the other evening and while the food service was prompt, they totally forgot to bring us drinks despite us asking several times. The waiter came to our table once, and that was it, so we had to ask another poor waiter to bring us our drinks (I always hate doing that to them)! Then my friend asked for extra sauce for her grande burrito, since it came out dry. She specifically asked for the sauce to be warmed up, but alas, when they brought it out it was SUH COLD s she couldn't even eat it. Totally ruined her burrito.  Ah well. Good cheesecake though."
