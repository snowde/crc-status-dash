Catherine R.,"Fort Washington, MD",41,7,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Was told the wait would be 30 minutes, it was actually 60 minutes. Sat down and wasn't waited on for another 6 minutes. My husband ordered chicken parmesan, it came out as grilled chicken (wasn't breaded at all). The waitress was quick to have it remade. Overall it felt like an over priced TGIFridays. Not worth the 56.00 for two entrees and 2 drinks."
Sabrina P.,"Sterling, VA",0,9,21,3.0,2/4/2017,"I love the place but, honestly after waiting for our waiter for a good while is not impressive at all, it's disappointing."
Al C.,"Leesburg, VA",0,42,,4.0,1/26/2017,"My son and I visited this location for dessert, and really enjoy our time, this one of the nicest places you can dine in, in this area, not too mention that the Cheesecake options are amazing"
Orefor O.,"Vienna, VA",0,54,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Once again this place has gone from bad to worst!  Customer service absolutely poor, the wait staff non existence, even when the manager proclaim to fix the wrong, yeah right!  Even Chickfilet know how gets things right without making you wait,  perhaps they should take some lessons from them!  Don't go there expecting exceptional service cause you ain't gonna get it, food expect to wait for it LONG TIME!!"
Keisha L.,"Woodbridge, VA",79,142,607,4.0,4/22/2016,"I had lunch here yesterday and it was fantastic!! My Dynamite Shrimp hit the spot and followed by the Louisiana Pasta!!! If you are in the area and decide to eat here, see if Sergio is working. He was very attentive responsive. I will definitely be back!"
Steve N.,"Albany, NY",163,381,696,4.0,3/18/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has it's detractors. Ignore them. The naysayers don't know what they're missing out on.  Yes, it's ostentatious with it's circus like decor. Yes, the portions are titanic and the calorie counts for some dishes stratospheric. Yes, the menu (sorry, the THREE menus), are encyclopedic.  But here's a dirty little secret it's critics are too proud to admit. THE FOOD IS GOOD. The kitchen at Cheesecake Factory can sometimes be slow. But that's good. It's slow because they're making real food back there. This is not Applebee's, or Olive Garden, where most dishes are produced in a factory (pardon the pun) and reconstituted upon your request. No, the food is made with fresh, quality ingredients. They use fresh vegetables, real butter and real cream, and lots of it. I LOVE BUTTER AND CREAM! And I love Cheesecake Factory. You should too."
Sandy S.,"Ashburn, VA",4,11,,4.0,5/31/2017,Always reliable and consistent. It baffles me how they can make so many things and make them all very well.  We had orange chicken and fried chicken sliders for entrées-The orange chicken was so massive I brought it home and had two more significant meals.  Everything was hot and fresh and just delicious-so many choices so little time!
Sharar P.,"Sterling, VA",146,1,,1.0,6/13/2017,"***DO NOT EAT HERE*** *May 28th* my birthday! My best friend brought me to cheesecake for lunch. I honestly wish after the both of us being hospitalized for server food poisoning we would have just gone to McDonald's!  When we walked in the host were anything BUT pleasant. Also their clothing was a bit much it's not a night club.  Our waitress was an older woman who talked so much she forgot to put my order in! The appetizer (pot stickers) we got were terrible! 20 mins go by and my friends food comes out. Then 10 more minutes go by and the waitress comes over and asked how everything was... then quickly notice she didn't put my food in.  All I ordered was grilled chicken, broccoli , and mash potatoes! Another 10 mins go by and she ask if carrots are okay instead of broccoli, which shows she clearly didn't attend/pay attention to their pre-shift. I also had a Cesar salad that just tasted like romaine tossed with water.  My food finally comes out! The chicken is burnt on the outside but one taste and it was clear it was STILL RAW! The mash potatoes were cold and the carrots were hot but lacked flavor. Lastly our server had an attitude when my friend asked for a birthday dessert for me. We then ask for to-go cups and get plastic ramekins  I felt like I was being punked  At this point we're annoyed with the serves and the food was garbage! We express this to the sever and she gets a manager to comp my friends salad. We thought maybe the manager would have come by the table but no one ever did.  After we paid the server NEVER returned. We were trying to get to-go cups so we asked the host, who told us to go to the pastry counter to ask for cups.  We go there and the cashier had such a nasty attitude, she slammed 2 plastic cups down without lids. Clearly we had asked for to-go cups but she was bothered.  We finally locate a manager who said that she had just walked in at 4 but the funny thing is we saw her on the patio talking to serves when we walked by to come in (90mins prior) We expressed our issues and all we got was an ""I'm sorry""  On the 30th I woke up at 2am vomiting and had a fever of 103 I was so weak to the point my husband had to pick me up and carry me to the car and get help moving my body once at the ER! I'm 5 months pregnant and it was terrifying to be that sick and not being able to eat for days to nourish my baby broke my heart!  I contacted my friend to see how she was and she told me she had just been released from the hospital because she had food poisoning!  So I call a few days later to inform the managers and I got yet again another attitude, the female manager said ""well no one else got sick so"" and I told her I have the paperwork from the hospital and so does my friend. I was told corporate would be calling us within 24 hours and now it's June 14!  I've been a server/bartender for years and I've never seen such horrible customer service from the host all the way to the manager!  I will be calling the health department tomorrow!"
Barbara L.,"Sterling, VA",19,210,457,5.0,2/15/2015,"What?! I've been coming here for YEARS and haven't written my review? Can't. Be. Possible.  Better late than never I suppose.  I always seem to pick this place as my ""special me celebration"" location several times a year. Each birthday, Valentine's, Mother's Day, etc, the honoree picks where to go and this is usually mine. I save it for special occasions because of the pricing (just a little higher than I'm totally comfortable with) and the fattening choices!! (High calories and carbs).  Yes. I know. They have a lighter menu which I've experienced and have not been disappointed with yet but come on...the other foods are too dang yummy to choose healthier all the time.  So I save my high calorie favorites for my special occasions.  This latest checkin though, I sat at the bar with our friends. I didn't see the tab because hubby always takes care of me but I can only imagine what the bill was.  Our bartender was super nice and attentive. I've become accustomed to sitting at the bars these past few years just because the service is more pleasant and much quicker. Not that they're slow here because I've never experienced slow service before.  So the question I always pose to myself afterwards ""would I be back?""  Well, duh. Absolutely."
Sondra K.,"Harpers Ferry, WV",153,147,228,5.0,2/7/2017,"So, we were having one of those I'm angry because I'm hungry and I don't know where to eat moments- pulled in and decided this would have to do. Being new ish vegans were not really sure about who serves what and how the heck you're supposed to eat out when everything seems to be smothered in cheese or butter. Turns out this place could very well be vegan paradise. At first glance we had our choice of basically 6 salads- sans cheese and croutons. But on closer look- this menu is super easy to navigate and lots of leave the meat off options are available. We got the flatbread with basil and tomato no cheese for an app, it was small but delicious. The fresh table bread came with butter which our waitress happily subbed with olive oil- for lunch I went with the vegan salad, cliche but delicious and so huge I couldn't finish it it had asparagus, cooked radish, lettuce quinoa, spinach, sunflower seeds cashews- oh lord it was a mountain of nuts and veggies drowning in some delicious house balsamic vinaigrette that was so good you could wipe it on your face and not be mad! - So the fries we ordered were awesome but the meals were so big they're coming home with us! Ok so, hub ordered the veggie burger which was suspect we weren't sure about the egg dilemma on this one- it's clean! No egg! It was FREAKIN HUGE! Delicious and I was kinda jealous that I didn't order it. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a vegan meal that's going to offer you more than just a side salad of ice burg hold everything else that comes on it at that place you usually have to go!"
Boo Y.,"Crozier, VA",0,85,1,1.0,5/3/2017,Same problem in a second visit more than two months apart.  Really bad customer service at the bar.  The bartender has horrible interpersonal skills.    The manager must be an idiot or blind not to see the problem.
Jaz M.,"McLean, VA",33,11,,1.0,1/8/2016,Poor Customer service. I took my daughters there for lunch during the week. We sat in the one of the high tops in the bar area. The server walked right by us and did not acknowledge us.(The restaurant was not busy)  We ordered drinks and they never came. I spoke with the manager.. He apologize but the service did not improve. So we walked out and enjoyed lunch elsewhere. I thought the servers made there money from good Customer Service!??  How sad. We used to eat there quite often. We will no longer support this restaurant!
Donald F.,"Ashburn, VA",318,155,124,4.0,10/19/2013,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory numerous times and I have absolutely enjoyed my visits. I mean I have been to this place well over ten times since moving to the NOVA area. What I like most about this place is that they are pretty consistent. There has only been two or three occasions where my wife and I didn't have the normal standards that we are accustomed to during our many visits. However this wasn't as bad as most places because the service and management are willing to do whatever they can to resolve any issue with our respective meals. For instance they would either subtract that meal item from our bill or prepare a fresh order. I have tried many different food items here but a majority of my visits I find myself defaulting to the Famous Factory Meatloaf which is hmmmmm hmmmm good. Also just a heads up for you health conscious folks that the portions are huge so be sure to pay attention to what you're ordering.  However on this particular occasion I decided to be a bit more healthy so I ordered from their skinnylicious menu. I ended up ordering the Skinnylicious Grilled Salmon with assorted vegetables and let me just say that I enjoyed every bit of the meal. The Cheesecake Factory is always a choice I can default to if nothing else comes to mind. I mean the service is typically good, the food preparation is pretty consistent, and the meals are fulfilling and tasty. I mean with so many pros why wouldn't someone want to give this place a shot."
Tamira T.,"Culpeper, VA",270,47,1,3.0,7/6/2016,"Took the hubby here for a date. We hadn't been in awhile. The menu is vast and I like that. I settled on the skinnilicious veggie burger. Loved the salad that came with it, but they really need a vegetarian or vegan chef to develop their burger. If I wanted a burger that tasted like packed grains, which I don't, I'd probably just make my own. Most vegetarians and vegans don't eat meat for the animals sake. We'd like our veggie burgers to approximate a real burger experience. This didn't. The hubby's fries were very good. He said his burger was average. I really like the atmosphere. Hope they work on their veggie burger. Take note of the veggie burgers that are taking the world by storm. They're out there and they taste more and more like the real thing without the cruelty."
Lyn L.,"Burke, VA",225,707,2414,4.0,2/19/2014,"I've been to 2 Cheesecakes in the last 2 weeks!  I love their food.   Last night we headed out for a late night dinner.   We were near the Dulles Town Center and had a couple of gift cards in hand, so naturally we ventured over to the Cheesecake Factory.    I must admit I order the same thing every time I come:   Fried Zucchini sticks and the Chinese Chicken Salad, not at the same time, but those are my go-to foods.   I thrive on their bread!  Give me your dish of individual butters and a basket of your bread!   Their bread is consistent at every Cheesecake location EXCEPT last night!   I know this bread and last night it was stale, cold, and I'm wondering if it was someone's leftovers.  Seriously the bread was that bad.   BUT, our salads arrived quickly so we just ignored the bread.    Their Chinese Chicken Salad is full of everything (fried won ton skins, mandarin oranges, chicken, almonds/nuts, green onions, and those white stringy crunchy things.  There is so much in that salad and unfortunately it doesn't pack well so it's a marathon of eating.    Service last night was awesome, and that's the reason for the 4 stars.   We typically sit at the bar, because we are usually ravenous and want to chow down.   The bartender made a nice Long Island to complement by super huge salad.   She was attentive, and made sure we were ok.    The hubby didn't want me to mention the bread because he thought it was fine.  Hmmmm"
Berryanne O.,"Sterling, VA",0,6,,2.0,4/22/2017,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory before, the fairoaks location that is, which I've had good experiences at for the most part. My boyfriend brought me to the sterling location for our one year anniversary today. They sat us in the middle of a party and another couple, not only was it extremely loud, but no one came to our table for 10 minutes. Finally when someone did come, she brought us bread which rock hard, then took another several minutes to bring our drinks. I asked if she could move us to another location that was quieter, which I asked for when they first sat us and they told us that all the other tables were reserved, but also told us we cannot reserve tables which was really confusing. She ended up taking us somewhere quieter which I appreciated. Later on another server came to our table to take our order. She wasn't very friendly and didn't greet us, just took the order. We got our food later and there was bones in my boyfriends chicken tortillas, and my chicken was hard. My boyfriend and I asked if there were suppose to be bones and she said no, asked if we wanted another one, we said no thank you, then she just walked away and didn't say anything. So more than less our experience wasnt the best. Do not recommend it."
Rai P.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",0,20,4,1.0,6/27/2016,"As many times as I eat at this place this visit has left a poor taste in my mouth. After the kitchen incorrectly cooks my steaks order Manager Chris comes out to tell me there are no more of those steaks available and is there something else I wanted. Well no, not really. I asked if I can get the same meal but made with another steak. We went with the filet. Well after waiting another 20 mins for food and upon receipt of my bill, do you think there was any accommodations to the guest for inconvenience. Nope. Manager Chris declined an adjustment and wanted us to pay for the other steak made. It took a head manager to offset the bill and we paid the original price. Very poor service today. But kudos to head manager (didnt catch his name) for stepping in and providing reasonable customer service."
Nora N.,"Redwood City, CA",6,14,,1.0,7/27/2016,Service and food at this particular CCF  is horrible!  Don't waste your time dining here!
Darby B.,"Sterling, VA",50,3,1,5.0,3/26/2016,They have the worst policy on seating but great food and I love Cheesecake Factory and again I recommend the margreta pizza
Jordan L.,"Chantilly, VA",25,14,,1.0,12/2/2016,"WORST FUCKING SERVICE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!! If you wanna eat at Cheesecake Factory, go to the one in Fairfax/Fair Oaks mall. I ordered curbside 20 minutes AHEAD of time over the phone and when I went to pick it up, I waited ANOTHER 30 MINUTES!?!?!?!? For two simple dishes AND the complimentary bread was solid as a rock. The packaging was atrocious. I work at Cheesecake Factory at Fair Oaks mall and I've never EVER given such poor service. Dulles isn't even close to as busy as Fair Oaks gets. No excuse for the shit service. FUCK DULLES!!!!!!!!!!"
