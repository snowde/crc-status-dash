Nadia D.,"Leesburg, VA",0,4,,5.0,3/20/2017,"I don't think I've ever had a more pleasant dining experience. My fiancé and I are both in the hospitality industry so we know how to appreciate excellent service. Erica, our server, was the most incredible server we've ever had. She truly delivered an excellent dining experience, and we will be sure to ask for her the next time we go back."
Tom L.,"Chantilly, VA",0,7,,4.0,2/12/2017,Last time i was there it was super busy waiter running around barely saw him but he was busy. Food was good as usual not bad not amazing. It came out fast. Left with salted Carmel cheesecake the main reason I go. Never had bad experience here never had amazing either. Good when you have a craving for cheesecake. 4 stars for the salted Carmel cheesecake hopefully they never get rid of it.
Miatagal B.,"Morgantown, WV",0,7,,4.0,9/27/2016,"Good meal, nice atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, clean restrooms. A little too high on the food prices."
Thomas K.,"Leesburg, VA",0,11,,4.0,8/25/2016,"Like most chains, I'm guessing that if we went here 10 times, five would be a hit and five would be a miss.  Today was a hit.  Our server was AWOL when we needed her (order, refill, check), but the food was very good.  Not just chain-restaurant good - I mean good period. I had the shrimp sandwich (so good), and my wife had the flatbread (yum!).  The side salad was crisp, and the food was cooked well and presented nicely.  I could see in the kitchen and I didn't see an expediter checking for quality as dishes went out, so the chef must be on her game.  I'm not normally a fan of chains, but this CF has earned another visit from us in the near future."
Marisa M.,"Reston, VA",62,70,62,5.0,11/15/2015,"Came here on a busy Saturday during lunch when I was in a rush. Instead of waiting 10-15 min for a table, my husband and I decided to head to the bar area and grabbed a high top.  After a few minutes of not being greeted, I started to wonder if cheesecake was a good choice while in a rush. But at that moment, we were saved. A very nice server greeted us and was very prompt. After looking around the entire bar area, I realized he was the primary server for the whole bar area (~5 high top tables & 10 small booths). This made me feel terrible! After he greeted us, our food came out quickly and we were provided with great service. Thanks, Henry L!"
Sarah G.,"Herndon, VA",63,190,63,4.0,10/18/2015,"If I'm ever here it's for the cheesecake, my favorite so far has been the s'mores cheesecake. Chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow, a perfect combination. The atmosphere is like any other cheesecake factory, fancy-ish, dark lighting (supposed to be mood lighting? who knows), and staff dressed in white shirts and black dress pants. If you're looking for a place with a lot of cheesecake some here. I usually never get dinner here because of the price of the entrees and the amount of food you get (is simply too much if you ask me especially if you want dessert) and if I had to choose I would get cheesecake. Depending on the kind of cheesecake you get it can be very rich, so choose wisely."
Sarah D.,"Loveland, CO",0,16,,4.0,8/8/2016,"Have eaten here several times with friends. Although the menu is large, I like that it seems to have something for everyone so it makes it an easy choice with a small group. You just have to figure out what type of meal you want and go right to that page of the menu - if you try to read through it you'll be there for hours. Food and portions are so good, I'm sad we never save enough room for the amazing dessert!"
Karina A.,"Lansdowne, VA",23,1,,1.0,1/29/2017,This is my third time at Cheese Cake. I think this has been the worst experience. Server was slow. Ordered kids food and appetizer. They were served before drinks. When the food runners delivered our food they looked like they in a bad mood. My philosophy is if you do like your job then move on. Food was average like always. Husband ordered filet muñón. He got served ribeye. Will not be visiting there again. All the times I have been there it has been a disappointment.
Andrea A.,"Burke, VA",1,17,54,5.0,8/28/2014,"I LOVE their brown bread!!  Why is it SO ADDICTIVE?!?? Add the butter, and you have something I can NOT resist!!"
Emma H.,"Fairfax, VA",0,25,,1.0,7/24/2016,DO NOT PAY THE SUGGESTED GRATUITY ON RECEIPT--more than DOUBLE  for 20 percent!!! food is good but when my friend and I discovered that the suggested gratuity were WAY OFF --even 15 percent on receipt was more than the real amount for 20 percent.  SAY WHAT?????? Maybe there is a problem with the suggested tips when you split the check???
ginny k.,"Olympia, WA",0,7,,1.0,1/13/2017,Horrible service. And does anyone ever think about WHY it's so dark in that place? Seriously... what are they hiding? Left and went to a locally owned Greek restaurant with friendly service and great food. I guess the lousy service that made me leave Cheesecake was a favor.
Ryan C.,"Leesburg, VA",0,6,,2.0,1/2/2017,"Service here is pretty consistently bad. Came last week and received probably the worst bar service I've ever experienced. Server tonight was better but still slow and somewhat rude, walked away before we could even finish ordering. But the food is great, will probably just stick to ordering cheesecake to go."
Beheshta B.,"Reston, VA",110,31,26,4.0,5/11/2015,Took my mommy here for Mother's Day!!! She loved the Chicken Madeira and Shrimp scampi. Even though they were super busy the wait for getting seated and for the food wasn't long at all.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.
Charlotte L.,"Aldie, VA",1,99,36,1.0,5/6/2016,"WORSE SERVICE EVER. Went here today and I think I saw my waiter twice. When he seated us and when he gave us the check. First off he couldn't even get our order right. Secondly we ordered a cheesecake that never even came. And when we were so pissed we decided to cancel it he laughed.  He's like oh I can get it for you guys it takes like a minute. Boy where were you 10 minutes ago when I ordered it. Its already made he should have had it by my table already.  Also, the bathroom was horrendously disgusting. There were tampons on the ground and the trash was overflown. They need to clean it more regularly.  Go to the fair oaks one instead. Absolutely do not recommend this particular location."
Joshua D.,"Sterling, VA",150,655,71,2.0,4/16/2014,"I used to think Cheesecake Factory was the bombdiggity, but over the years, it's certainly lost its luster. Yet, despite being a mid-tier chain restaurant that doesn't specialize in anything, CF tries to act like a super-classy hotspot for cuisine. In reality, it's become not much more than a place known for an OK happy hour and oversized portions. Don't get me wrong, there are certain dishes I find really good -- such as CF's orange chicken. But it's not worth dealing with the CF 'experience' for when several actual Chinese places do it better and cheaper. And of course, the main event, the cheesecake, is amazing -- but that's a once-a-year treat no one's waistline dares have regularly. On my most recent visit to the Dulles location, I was instantly annoyed. Despite half the restaurant being open (it was a Tuesday night after happy hour for crying out loud), the hostess quoted a 10-minute wait. is that supposed to make CF seem fancier? Because instead it just makes it annoying and inefficient. At least hide the empty tables from my view. Don't have enough people to staff them? At least let me go ahead and sit down with some bread and a Coke. (Oh, and plan better.) The service was fine. The food was fine. I'd never had pizza from CF (have had just about everything else and wanted to mix it up). The pizza reminded me of a DiGiorno. The crust seemed to indicated a previously frozen dough, and the cheese and sauce had that cafeteria-quality flavor. The toppings varied slightly from what was in the menu description, and the mushrooms and veggies were seriously underrepresented. The meats, however - pepperoni and sausage -- were piled high. I could almost give CF three stars, but it really does fall more often than not these days in the, ""Meh. I've experienced better."" category."
Rati P.,"Sterling, VA",10,48,,3.0,2/28/2016,"My go-to place for late night dinners.. I really love the ambience, the seating and the service over here..Their cheesecakes are good definitely.. Their pastas are my favorite.. A nice place to hang out with large groups or with love one.. I like it.."
Megan C.,"Herndon, VA",532,659,554,4.0,3/5/2014,"I'm loath to reward a ""big chain"" like Cheesecake Factory with a full 4 stars, more details on that to come, so let's just settle at 3.5 and call it a draw.  Location-wise, this particular copy is great. It's convenient to all things related to Dulles Town Center and Sterling, with tons of easy mall parking, and it's standalone, so you don't have to deal with the throng of people inside the mall itself. We've always experienced friendly, efficient, and accurate service here, which is much more than I can say for the Fair Oaks and Tyson's Corner locations. On our last visit, during one of the many ""polar vortex"" nights of 2014, when most restaurants were closing doors early, CF remained open, and even though they were short-staffed, our waitress, Amy, was great.  For those who have a geographic choice as we do in selecting among the Dulles/Fair Oaks/Tyson's locations, we always choose Dulles, especially on the weekends. They just seem to run a tighter ship here all-around, and waiting times are either non-existent or shorter than other nearby locations. Helpful to know if you run with a ""hangry"" bunch during weekend meal times. That's ""hungry""+""angry"", FYI :) Okay, so more detail on my ""beef"" with Cheesecake Factory as a whole, if you're still reading (since we've gone over the nuts and bolts of this particular location). In 2014, it blows my mind that there is still a chain restaurant that REFUSES to publish their ingredients and nutritional information. That irks the hell out of me, as an 80%-of-the-time very health-conscious eater and having a member of my family with an allergy to a certain ingredient, it's irritating to say the least. We want to enjoy CF, as their food is pretty tasty, prices fair, and menu expansive, but it's almost as though they have ""something to hide"" in not disclosing their full modus operandi.  I realize they offer the (deceptively) ""Skinnylicious"" menu, but only offer that the items are ""under XYZ calories,"" but what about fat/carbs/sodium/etc.? They would probably attract even more folks such as myself who would seek out a special ""healthy"" menu if they were to disclose ingredients, portion sizes, and full nutritionals. Okay, rant over. I remember eating at CF for pre-Prom dinner one year in high school, and although my days of carelessly indulging in their cheesecake are over, I do enjoy their breakfast/brunch items and salads, especially the Tuna Tataki Salad."
Lauren S.,"Purcellville, VA",0,20,,3.0,10/14/2015,"I have a pretty severe gluten allergy but servers have always been diligent about bringing about the proper menu and informing the manager of my situation.    I always get a Salad and it always lasts 3-4 meals which is fantastic. Occasionally, I'll have to send back my salad if it it has croutons or dressing on it, but generally speaking, the food is okay for the price and I am willing to go here as a splurge."
Bob s.,"Herndon, VA",0,17,,2.0,4/29/2016,"Disappointing service tonight. Came in after the dinner rush 8:40, plenty of open seats, yet we had to wait 10+ mins on drinks, then were informed after a lengthy wait that our appetizer order was misplaced; its 9:32 now as I type this. Our dinner was presented to us just now, but we sent it back to be kept warm til our appetizer arrived. 9:34, appetizer arrived. To our waitress' credit, she brought us clam chowder n extra bread and apologized for the delay. First time I've seen the CCF so discombobulated though."
Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",385,337,279,4.0,10/16/2013,"Despite being a chain restaurant, Cheesecake Factory is a good choice for a large group and seems to have something for everyone!!       In my two experiences here, this location seems to have very competent management and waitstaff which keep things moving along even when there is a formidable line.  My favorite is the Ahi Carpaccio--thinly sliced, buttery sweet tuna drizzled with wasabi aioli, paired with shaved green onion, pickled cucumbers and soy.  I try to get a bit of each ingredient on each and every forkful and wait for the flavorful explosion in my mouth.  The menu is huge and everyone in your party can usually find something to please them among the offerings!  I recommend the Thai chicken wraps---deliciously nutritious with whole, fresh ingredients are huge hits with adults and kids alike!!"
