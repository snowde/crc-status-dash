Briana H.,"Durham, NC",302,188,1599,5.0,12/23/2017,"One of my favorite date spots in Durham. Located at The Streets at Southpoint, this Cheesecake Factory is always popping but the service has always been great!  The dining experience is always pleasant. The food is always great and the cheesecake - the best ever!  My favorite dish is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. If you see another dish that you want you can always ask for a sauce from another dish. You can mix and match. The menu is very long but the food can be custom, made to order."
chaz t.,"Durham, NC",11,99,32,2.0,11/18/2017,"Vegan and vegetarian community: Veggie burger fell apart and was not something that we would try again.  Eggplant came with five small medallions and was quite tasty.  The fettuccine alfredo always is a crowd pleaser and be sure to get the lunch portion as it is huge! The Cobb salad was a big hit. It was actually large enough to share for the entire table of four.  Good variety and fresh options on the Cobb.  The nachos were quite tasty as well.  Unfortunately, we all wanted to try the cauliflower steak on cous could with spinach and fontina. Alas it was sold out.  Leave off the fontina and it seems like it could be a very nice vegan option.   Of course the cheesecakes delighted all!! Awesome service by Ryan and Missy.  Perhaps the best we have ever had here!!! November 2017 update: they no longer even offer the cauliflower option. Also, they are either unable or unwilling to price adjust their salads when the meat is removed. Perhaps they don't realize that vegans and vegetarians are a growing and significant segment of our country.  We need more options not less.  We can't live on (cheese) cake alone!"
Joe B.,"Durham, NC",19,31,,2.0,11/6/2017,"Went to this location last night ahead of a movie, with about 75 minutes to eat and get to the movie with a comfortable amount of time to spare.  Went with my girlfriend and her kids, and their first question was ""why is it so *dark* in here??"" I know a lot of restaurants maintain a dim atmosphere for... reasons? But it was stupidly dark in the restaurant. Asked the host, and they were just like ""um, because it's on a timer?""  We were seated quickly, but service was silly slow. We told the server that our movie was at 7, and they even mentioned it later so I know they didn't forget. They just did a terrible job of returning to the table. Very pleasant, but not really attentive. The restaurant was busy, so maybe she had too many tables - but we were irked that she mentioned she knew we were on a timetable, but didn't drop off the check in anything like a timely fashion.  Asked another waiter, they dropped off the check - and then sprinted away before we could hand a credit card to pay! Host said they couldn't handle money, so they paged our original server.  Food is OK, not fantastic. I will say Cheesecake Factory does pretty well with their food given the diversity of the menu.  Previous visit, I went for brunch and the service was terrible then as well. Doubt we'll be back. The food doesn't make up for the terrible service."
Kristin E.,"Washington, DC",205,63,28,3.0,11/2/2017,"Most times I eat at The Cheescake Factory, I don't have a problem. However, I did at the Southpoint location. When first arriving, the hostesses asked my sister and I if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We were going to sit outside until we were told there would probably be a lot of flies on the patio. My sister and I were sat next to a huge window where there were still flies buzzing around. I saw one dead on the window seal next to me. The hostess explained that the windows have a treatment on them that kill insects.  We ordered a couple of appetizers including the Dynamite Shrimp the Factory Nachos. We sent the shrimp back because it was overcooked. By this time, the flies became absolutely unbearable so we asked the hostess to move us. She told us that more than likely there would still be flies wherever we sat, which was a huge problem in itself. She moved us near a booth closer to the inside of the restaurant and near the kitchen. There were still flies but not as many.  Our first waitress was pretty inattentive, but the second was pretty great."
Abrahan S.,"Chapel Hill, NC",77,7,30,3.0,12/23/2017,"Not Impressed, the service and food were average! I don't understand why so many people like this place. It was packed"
B G.,"Durham, NC",0,2,2,1.0,1/1/2018,Last time I eat here.  I was served a burnt fly with my appetizer. Good thing I caught it before eating it. Ask to speak with the manager and he acted like nothing was wrong. Not looking for a free meal but a sorry would be helpful and a free appetizer. Manager acted as if this was a regular and could happen at any time. He could have handled the matter better than he did. Food is overrated anyways for the price.
Evan F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,362,113,2.0,9/18/2017,"I like Cheesecake Factory but I made the mistake of asking our waitress her opinion of a speciality menu item (curry chicken). Baaedbon her opinion I ordered it. After eating a small portion I found it very disagreeable.  Waitress cleared table with my nearly full plate. No offer for a different choice or remove it from the bill. It really was awful. In fact I had to throw up shortly after dinner.  I was looking forward to dessert, but for this meal I only was looking for the closest route back to my hotel. Disgraceful that this horrible item was on the menu.  The restaurant itself was very nice and comfortable. Our wait for seating less than a minute. But I'll never return to this location. My experience we as just ""that bad"" ane I know not to trust waiter/waitress opinions."
Doug G.,"Lincoln, CA",242,268,356,4.0,4/17/2017,"Stopped for lunch a few days ago at the Cheesecake Factory in Durham.  I like this restaurant chain and my first visit to the Durham location was no expectation.  Nice, upbeat atmosphere augmented by interesting decor. Helpful, friendly wait staff who work fast and efficiently. The extensive menu always include several healthy choices. Reasonable portion sizes and better than average presentation for a chain restaurant.  On this day I started my ordered with a sparkling water and a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon (what a surprise). After due consideration, I selected the Seared Tuna Salad that was on the SkinnyLicious menu.  This salad is / was really delicious. It is one of my favorites on the Cheesecake Factory menu. Mixed greens, avocado, tomato tossed with a wasabi vinaigrette. Generous amount of fresh, tender, lightly seared Ahi Tuna.   Positive experience and good food."
Z A.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Where can I start! Well,when you go during weekend expect to wait at least an hour and half. And after setting  you have to wait about 30 min to see ur server. then after you place ur order you have to wait another hour and if you lucky you will get what you ordered a lot of times they bring the wrong order. Horrible experience!  horrible service! Rude manager!"
Chas P.,"Creedmoor, NC",2,132,,3.0,12/9/2017,"Busy busy-sat at the bar and the two bar tenders were hustling  wow   Could have used another   Ordered two burgers, they were ok,  not sure burgers are their speciality  but  not bad"
Brittany L.,"Sanford, NC",26,5,,5.0,10/28/2017,"Great service, great atmosphere! The food was fantastic! Had the baby bang shrimp and chicken, love curry. It was amazing! Fried calamari as well, yum! My husband had the normal burger and he said it was the best burger he's ever had. I was shocked! We also had the oreo cheesecake to go, but when we ate it, it was to die for. I'm not exaggerating here! Will defiantly go back! Great bloody Mary's too!  Our server defiantly knew what she was doing, so sweet and friendly."
Jessica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,290,726,3.0,4/16/2017,"Solid 3 stars. Went here for dinner with my colleagues and shared a kale salad, also had the filet mignon and caramel cheesecake. Loved the salad and cheesecake. The filet did not have much flavor and we requested a variety of sauces to help with that. Also the asparagus was an upgrade but this was simply steamed asparagus, no flavor or seasoning at all. A little disappointing. And also the wait for our food was a little ridiculous--we came on a nearly empty Sunday night but it took sooo long for our meal. The server was extremely apologetic and we appreciated it, but just never wish it happened in the first place. So, not bad but not great either."
Matt G.,"Morrisville, NC",36,630,,4.0,3/30/2017,"Grand interior all around, nice colors, huge pillars, high cielings and such, the mirror walls make it appear larger than it is though. I like the colurful cieling paitings. Plenty of nice outdoor seating. Our table was a bit dirty, when we asked our server to clean it he just wiped it off with a napkin from another table as opposed to cleaning it properly. There are too many menu options on three different menus! It would take me an hour to properly read through the menu. Two types of complimentary bread served before the meal. The dark bread is good.  The chicken and shrimp dish with pineapple and light honey flavoured batter was very good, mixed with snow peas and shittake mushrooms. But for a dish with pineapple in the name, there probably should have been more pineapple pieces. Everything else was great about this dish and the portion was so big I took half of it home, which I hardly ever do. Unlike others, I don't think Cheesecake Factory is overpriced, depending on what you pick from the menu you can find some affordable options around 12 dollars. The burger bun for the turkey burger was burnt, badly on one side. A little bit dry meat and the mushrooms were missing. Mayo was good and the fries a lot better than the average fries.  For an angel hair pasta dish, asked for bacon to be removed and replaced with mushrooms instead. The server charged 1.50 dollars extra without informing us. Not cool. Mango Key Lime Cheesecake (with vanilla coconut macaron crust) had lot of flavour. Soo good! I counted the types of cheesecake on the menu and found a total of 33 different cheese cakes. Double espresso took a long time and came only when I was half way done with my cheesecake. Cheescake Factory is a good spot for groups, dates and any other occassion in between."
Andrew C.,"Durham, NC",99,9,,2.0,12/11/2017,"I really try to make sure that I am fair with my reviews and I do positive ones when they are earned. That being said I had a horrible time at this place. First off the lights are so low that you can barely read the menu. Then there is way to much on the menu...its like a novel. The waiter who served us was not very friendly or personable. I ordered the fried catfish with double mash. I was very disappointed with this dish. The catfish was bland even adding salt did not help. It was also greasy, very greasy. I sent the dish back and just ordered the sliders. To be fair the sliders were great. Also the runners who actually brought the food to the table had great energy and personalities. I would not return here for anything other than cheesecake."
A F.,"Durham, NC",0,2,,2.0,1/5/2018,"Do not use the curbside pick-up. I called my order in and arrived at the time they said my order would be ready. When you pull into the reserved space there a number to call so they know you have arrived. I called the number and was told, ""Ok great we will be out in just a minute"". I decided to check my email and do a few things on my phone while I waited. I noticed a few people come out with bags but thought oh they were just ordering carry out. After a while it dawned on me I had been waiting 20 minutes. I thought at least someone would have come out so that I could pay and say it will be a few more minutes but nothing. I went in and waited in line for to go orders. When it was my turn I told the guy I placed my order an hour ago and have been waiting at curbside for 20 minutes. He said, Oh I'm sorry nobody told me. At that time a manager walks over lifts the ticket on a slice of cheesecake that's on the counter and says what's up with this (my name) order. I said oh that's me I've been outside waiting for 20 minutes. She says, ""Oh I'm sorry I was wondering why it was still sitting here."" She then walks over the the other register so in my mind I'm thinking maybe she will at least take the slice of cheesecake off of my order but no she says next in line and begins to take the next persons order. When I get home I had to warm my lukewarm pasta and room temperature cheesecake."
Nicole W.,"Columbia, SC",124,42,38,4.0,10/10/2016,"I typically love The Chessecake Factory, but this time I tried to get something new and it was pretty underwhelming. I ordered the Steak Diane & Shrimp. Next time I'll just stick with my tried and true pasta. This is also a great place to go out for drinks and dessert!"
Marc L.,"Durham, NC",692,250,1,4.0,7/29/2017,Went today with a friend and the food was delicious.  service was wonderful too.  Will definitely be back....
Em H.,"Greensboro, NC",94,212,1624,5.0,2/26/2017,"My husband, brother, sister-in-law, and I visited this Cheesecake Factory today for brunch. The place filled up fast, showing how popular the food is! We had buttered brown oat bread while waiting for our food. After a 15 minute wait, our server Kate, advised us the food was en route. My (poached) eggs Benedict were phenomenal. They had a kick of flavor that Hollandaise sauce doesn't normally have. It was really good. My side of fruit was strawberries, pineapple, blueberries, & grapes. I tried my husband's ""skinnilicious chicken pot pie"" and it was very flavorful. Once we completed our meal, we ordered the low carb cheesecake with strawberries to go. It was really tasty! We can't wait to return."
Koko P.,"Morrisville, NC",0,1,,1.0,11/17/2017,"They served bread with mold on them, and the kitchen manager didn't handle the situation well. She couldn't give us her sincere apology. It was my daughter's birthday and she basically ruined my daughter's birthday!"
Brandon J.,"East Bend, NC",152,1,,2.0,11/6/2017,"Although I have come to The Cheesecake Factory multiple times and have been satisfied with both the food and service, my experience on November 6th around 9:45pm was rather disappointing to say the least due to the sheer lack of professionalism of a rude waitress and an equally underprepared manager. We had accidentally ordered a cheesecake to go but wanted to dine in. We simply asked for a glass of water but we were given a bad attitude for the simple request. The waitress glared at us spitefully continuously throughout our stay and said ""just the water"" and left angrily implying that further service would not be given, even though we were considering ordering more food. The owner and top management should be far more  selective in its hiring process when the manager herself lacks the etiquette necessary to uphold basic customer service standards."
Yesha P.,"Concord, CA",6,29,68,4.0,10/29/2017,"Brunch at The Cheesecake Factory is a seamless process. They have what you would expect on a typical menu. As a vegetarian I always get the lemon ricotta pancakes and it's become my little tradition. It tastes good but can be sweet at times, which is why it's more of a treat than a regular spot on my list. The portions are big and it hits the spot when in the mood, but these pancakes are done best by Bottega Louie!"
Jace W.,"Clarkston, GA",20,1,,4.0,10/29/2017,Service was great short wait for a sunday evening. Waitress was friendly and answered questions. i ordered the meatloaf as usual but tried the buffalo blast there delicious took no time to get yhe food and cheesecake is always great
Jaehee Y.,"Chapel Hill, NC",369,107,249,3.0,6/19/2017,"I've ate lunch/dinner at different Cheesecake Factories before, and they were OK. A bit overpriced but big portions. I only really come here for the cheesecake for dessert now! They have a great selection but I always go with the original or the one with strawberries. Each cheesecake contains A LOT of calories so I try to limit myself, but they are really delicious! I also really like coming here for their drink ""Georgia Peach"", which is very fruity and refreshing. But again, it does a bit more $."
Andrea S.,"Town N Country Alliance, Tampa, FL",2,12,6,4.0,10/19/2017,I have not been to Cheesecake Factory in a while but went the other night with a large group. I was pleasantly surprised with the pasta I ordered 'Emily' s Favorite Pasta' which was full of grilled veggies pine nuts with a rigatoni base and very fresh and delicious. Service was a little slow but I attributed that to being with a large group.  The high point really was the pasta which tasted like a dish I would have received in an exotic bistro.
Kathryn W.,"Irving, TX",127,13,12,2.0,9/30/2017,"I've been waiting to go here for awhile because of memories from over 10 years ago. Memories are always better than reality! Saturday late lunch service was busy but we got a table quickly. Bread was good just like I remembered. Should have just stuck to bread and strawberry lemonade. Boy is that refreshing! We went with the avocado egg rolls on the recommendation of our waitress. They were ok. They are very salty and the sauce is very sweet. Kind of a rollercoaster ride for the tastebuds. Due to the preparation of them, the ends stay way too hot for a long time and the other side will be cold by that point. We had fun with the crispy rice noodles that garnished the plate though.  Entree was where I went horribly off track. I went with the chicken maderas based on internet reviews and seeing that it is the most popular chicken dish. This dish was very bland unless you had a bite with the cheese. The mushrooms were flavorless. The mashed potatoes were gummy. The chicken itself was nicely pounded and battered. But the sauce lacked salt or any depth really. I was disappointed! We ordered cheesecake to go so that should be a nice treat."
Cindy G.,"Apex, NC",144,518,2696,5.0,9/16/2016,"Great experience for me as I met someone here for dinner on a Tuesday evening at 6 PM. We were seated right away on the patio and it was actually quieter than indoors. The server was friendly and attentive. I liked their super foods menu section as well. They have quite a selection of mixed drinks and, obviously, cheesecake. I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake because 25 cents went to feed the hungry. My falafel salad was amazing. I was expecting falafel crumbs over the salad however there were six falafel balls surrounding the salad. It was delicious with the lemon yogurt dressing. A very relaxing evening and did not feel rushed leaving the restaurant. The patio is a beautiful area to hang out and people watch as well."
Chris M.,"Durham, NC",38,3,,5.0,10/11/2017,"Had awesome experience last night, supper was great and the cheesecake even better. What made the meal perfect was our Waiter Ryan N. Best waiter I have had. Thank sir for the great service"
Nisha D.,"Charlotte, NC",1,53,118,5.0,4/3/2017,Superb customer service from the moment we walked in the door! Waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about menu items. This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory and I was very impressed. The interior was nicely decorated but most importantly it was CLEAN!!! Food was delicious! I chose the bang bang chicken and shrimp with turtle cheesecake for dessert.  Prices are a bit high but I knew that before I went. Will definitely be back...
Barbara A.,"East Bronx, NY",1,12,28,4.0,5/28/2017,"Cheesecake Factory , despite my previous review, is still one of my favorite restaurants. Different experience each time, but overall food won't disappoint. I ordered my usual Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo with white rice. My sister ordered tacos off of the Skinny Licious menu. Waiter was professional and we enjoyed our dinner."
James R.,"Durham, NC",0,10,,1.0,11/12/2017,Horrible customer service. Good cheesecake if you wait 20 minutes to even be acknowledged for the privilege of ordering from the kiosk. All while listening to the black shirt (manager?) loudly joke with staff just standing around.
Joshua W.,"Hillsborough, NC",0,11,,1.0,3/9/2017,"Tonight my fiancé and I decided to have a lovely date night and discuss details for our upcoming wedding. My fiancé arrived early first to get us a table and have our appetizer and drink ready as I was working late and on the way. He requested for us to have a booth table, however the hostess then informed him that there were no booth tables available and we could be seated either at a bar high top or at the happy hour table. Disappointed, but understanding, he selected the high top bar table only to discover that many booth tables were available.  He was able to identify a manager and asked why he was told no booth tables were available for our preference and sat at a small bar high top. Right when I was arriving, the manager was surprised and happy to accommodate us to our preferred seat. She was glad to help.  The hostess began expressing much attitude and physically gesturing toward us while talking about us to a group of employees causing us to feel uncomfortable and quite frankly unwanted for our service. The manager came over and we kindly asked for her to please correct the situation as it was beginning to escalate and cause discomfort. The manager did pull her off the floor but eventually came back.  Silver lining, our waitress, Ifey, was an amazing superstar and make sure we were happy entertained and comfortable donating the night. We could not have been happier with her attention to us.  The reason I am providing a review of one star is because the manager never came back to check on us after the situation happened. There was no courtesy discount provided, though we did not expect to have one.  It sends us the message that the hostess' behavior was acceptable. It questions our loyalty as frequent diners to our favorite restaurant moving forward. We're not happy with the hostess or the manager.   The food was good--I had a Tuscan Chicken which I would say was better the first time I had it, but very savory. Roasted chicken and vegetables was the plate my fiancé had and was very good!"
Victoria K.,"Raleigh, NC",5,28,20,4.0,10/24/2016,"Beautiful, elegant atmosphere! So far the service has been very good! Huge selection of entrees and desserts to choose from! Amazing waiter and great tasting food!"
Brittney R.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,2,1.0,7/25/2017,"I've been to this location on two separate occasions and each time the dishes, glasses and/or utensils have been filthy. During my first visit there was a fly in my mother's iced tea which the manager didn't seem too concerned about however they did replace the drink. I figured it was a one off situation. My second time visiting the silverware given to us was dirty with pieces of food stuck to them. Then I had to keep asking our waitress to bring glasses of iced water to our table because within each glass there was old dried up food floating in the bottom of the glasses. I've been to a couple of Cheesecake Factory restaurants and the Durham, NC location is by far the worst one. This location just isn't up to par with the others."
Genaro G.,"Fort Bragg, NC",46,84,190,5.0,6/8/2016,"Yummmmm!  I recommend the coffee and limoncello torte to START, yes... Start.  Then order the chicken costoletta  salad, and skinnylicious chicken tacos w veggies... The wife ordered her Godiva chocolate cheesecake to go because she was full! Lol... But that is why I always , since the beginning of time eat dessert first."
Roger K.,"Raleigh, NC",461,308,3422,4.0,2/21/2016,5 star restaurant. However the fifth is missing here due to the length of time it took to get our fish. We've been to this location several times. It can take a good little minute to get your food (on Sunday). Also our waiter didn't do a good job with checking on us. The table beside us waiter came about 4 times during the 25 minutes we waited for our food (party of 2). We saw our wait or once!
Isabelle M.,"Clemmons, NC",0,7,,5.0,7/12/2017,"We have been to different locations for this restaurant many times but at this location we had the best experience. Let me start by saying that our server Ryan was OUTSTANDING.  Every single time he addressed someone in our party of 5 he always said ""ma'am"", ""sir"", ""young lady"", ""young sir"", ""my friend"", etc. That was very polite in our opinion. He didn't write down our orders but every single order came out 100% correct and our drinks never ran even close to empty. We were all very impressed with his wonderful attitude and service, especially on a busy Friday night. He even shook my dad's hand when we were standing up to leave.  The food was wonderful. It came out in appropriate time and it was delightful. Very tasty and all of us has enough to take for leftovers."
Cliff C.,"Durham, NC",9,59,100,5.0,12/18/2016,Sunday pancakes. The best around. It's like eating cake. Eggs are also great. Go try this. They only serve pancakes on Sunday.
Lauren R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,121,204,3.0,3/12/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always good, but if you ask me it's a little overrated. It's location is ideal at Southpoint Mall, and it is one of the better options to eat at the mall. The inside is huge and dark, and the outdoor seating is perfect for the warm spring and summer nights. Beware of the wait times here on the weekends. I'm pretty sure every time I have been, there's always a wait. Depending on how big your party is, the waiting time usually goes by quick and there's plenty to walk around and see while waiting at the mall.  The menu is huge. This is definitely one of those places where I stick to the same order every time, simply because I do not want to look through the menu. My usual is the Asian chicken salad, which never disappoints. The salad is HUGE. I usually have enough left over to last me for two more meals. They give a lot of chicken and peanuts, and the sesame Asian salad dressing is delicious.  Last night, I went with an order of the avocado egg rolls to share, and I changed it up with the chopped Cobb salad, without the bacon. The avocado egg rolls are delicious. A must order appetizer. They're crunchy, and the avocado is fresh and tasty. To make it even better, they serve it with an avocado dipping sauce dressing that was so good. My salad was good, but I liked my usual Asian salad better. It had a lot of apples and blue cheese in it, and the lettuce was shredded which I liked. The chicken pieces were small and there wasn't that much meat in the salad.  The service here isn't the quickest. The waitress was nice about it though and said the kitchen was a little slow several times and assured us the food would be out soon. However, a salad is so quick to make so I'm not sure what took so long.  My favorite part of dining here is the bread. The brown bread they serve is delicious! I could eat the whole loaf before dinner is even served. Save some room for some cheesecake to make the meal even better. The cheesecake menu is endless, and the cheesecakes are all good."
Jacquelyn Y.,"Durham, NC",0,3,,1.0,6/4/2017,"The last three times we have ordered to-go, we were put on hold for 15 mins and had to call back to get our order placed.  They need to implement online ordering or get a better system.  Don't waste your time."
Samantha K.,"Raleigh, NC",229,105,63,3.0,4/30/2017,"Went here for brunch after church and had an okay time here. While there was no wait to seat (unheard of at Cheesecake Factory), the service was slower than usual and was not as personable as it usually is. The menu is very expansive and you can find many things to eat here, so that is always a plus. I enjoyed my brunch and my wife enjoyed the veggie burger (as did I!). This place is expensive for our wallets but I am happy to go with a gift card. I do enjoy the experience overall but it is nothing to rave about."
