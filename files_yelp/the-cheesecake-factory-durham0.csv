Chrisy J.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",0,18,2,3.0,6/4/2013,Two words: Godiva Cheesecake! I really enjoyed myself. A friend and I went on a Friday night. The wait was about thirty minutes or so but it was certainly worth it. The service was great and the atmosphere was too. The kind people that I sat next to suggested that I try what is now my favorite flavor cheesecake...

Mark R.,"Wheelersburg, OH",0,87,19,4.0,6/15/2010,"A little pricey, but the service is usually very good and the portions are great.  In fact, usually too much to eat.  I have the tradition of eating my cheesecake (chocolate coconut cream!) before the meal, but I am going to have to stop.  Either I am going to have to take it with me or just go for the dessert."
Matt R.,"Durham, NC",3,11,,4.0,12/30/2011,"Really like the Cheesecake Factory.  Did not give 5 stars cause it's a bit pricey, esp for drinks and boy, they really think their cheesecake slices are the bomb, don't they?  However, we're always amazed that a place that has a menu as ENORMOUS as this one can create all those dishes so deliciously.  I love a number of their dishes and their sauces are really tastey.  And, yes, the cheesecakes are always decadent.  Can't go wrong, esp with a larger party of people having different tastes.  They have American, Italian, and Asian flavorful fare."
J L.,"Eutawville, SC",34,130,50,2.0,4/13/2011,"Came here just after lunch. Friendliless felt forced and the service was not that great. They were quick to give the check, though. I am a huge Queso Cake Factory die-hard fan. I am particularly fond of their fish tacos, but they have recently changed how they are made. I do not like them as much as I did before. This time around, I had the chicken tacos, which tasted great, not exceptional, but great. I don't know, this was my first time here. I usually go to the one in Raleigh and two in California, which all are waaaay better than this one. This place just didn't have the same feel as the other Cheesecake Factory's and I think the waiter had a lot to do with it. I am definitely not a demanding customer, in fact, I hardly ask for anything, but the server just seemed so fake and unmotivated. I wonder if it was the way we were dressed? Casual, jeans. Maybe he assumed he wouldn't get a good tip out of us. It was a high end shopping area after all. Hmmm....makes you wonder."
