Samantha L.,"Potomac, MD",1908,1022,9453,4.0,11/30/2015,"After the mall closed for the night, my parents and I stopped by The Cheesecake Factory for some desserts. Our server Ryan N. was very friendly - he always ended everything he said with ""my friend"". For dessert, we shared a slice of White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. It was a brownie crusted filled with rich and creamy cheesecake swirled with white chocolate shavings and raspberry puree. It was served with flavorless whipped cream. We could never go wrong with this selection of this cheesecake. I liked how it wasn't too sweet. For beverages, my dad ordered a hot coffee while my mom ordered a Frozen Iced Mango and I ordered a Tropical Smoothie. It was nice that they offer complimentary refills on coffee. The Frozen Iced Mango consisted of mango, tropical juices, and a hint of coconut blended with ice, swirled with raspberry puree, and garnished with a strawberry. Similarly, the Tropical Smoothie consisted of mango, passion fruit, pineapple, and coconut blended with ice and garnished with a strawberry."
S L.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,2.0,3/27/2016,"Don't order take out without verifying the contents of your boxes before leaving.  We had the right number of boxes but the contents were incorrect.  We got back home after a 30 minute drive with a fried chicken sandwich and plain sliders instead of Steak Diane and a chicken dish. To their credit they refunded us for these items - but we were very hungry and didn't want try drive back to get more food. Needless to say, we won't be frequenting this restaurant very often."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Janice M.,"Summerfield, NC",183,121,168,2.0,9/8/2014,"First time at this chain and was a bit disappointed. Let me start by saying the space is beatiful! We had the friend mac and cheese balls with creamy marinara sauce, SkinnyLiciousAsian chicken salad and the grilled shrimp and bacon club. The mac and cheese was very good, The salad was mostly shredded greens with little of the other ingredients evident. The chicken was bland and a bit chewy, liked the dressing. IMO, this is WAY overpriced. The grilled shrimp club was basically two sandwiches, HUGE, but again overpriced. We spent $47 on lunch without drinks. Nothing wowed me so doubt I will be returning."
Jessie P.,"Chapel Hill, NC",31,3,,5.0,7/16/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is so good. This is our go to restaurant for special occasions. It's perfect for me because I like to try new things each time and their menu is huge. It's also perfect for my boyfriend because he gets the same thing each time (Bacon Bacon Burger) and it always tastes great.
Toune G.,"Durham, NC",62,14,29,5.0,2/21/2015,"We go here at least once a month. The variety of food, the wonderful service, beautiful lighting &  ambiance, and if course the cheesecakes always brings us back. This is a very family friendly restaurant. The kids menu has wonderful choices that always brings smiles &  happy bellies to my boys. Every dish we've tried has been great but we have hardly scratched the surface of their diverse menu."
Jamie R.,"Angier, NC",0,23,,5.0,1/29/2016,Now this place is amazing ! The food was really good and the customer service was great ! Very friendly place for sure. The shrimp and angel hair pasta was so good and I'm not even a sea food person ! Of course the cheese cake blew me away also. Can't wait to come back here but it is pricey...worth it though ! Wonderful place for a date !
John M.,"Durham, NC",0,1,,1.0,4/14/2015,"GLASS IN MY DRINK!!!! If you value your health don't go here!!!!! I ordered a frozen drink there and was informed that when they put it in a warm glass it exploded. I was told that a new drink would be made and brought to me. When the ""new"" drink arrived I took a sip and crunched down on what I thought was ice. And to my surprise shards of glass exploded in my mouth. This ""restaurant"" has made no attempt to make a amends for this. I guess they feel OK about this and glass is now part of the 5 food groups. Don't go here they DO NOT care about their customers!!!"
Kate S.,"Atlanta, GA",498,71,85,4.0,7/17/2014,"The menu is huge, which makes ordering such a troublesome experience for indecisive people like me, but it's a good excuse to frequent this place and try out more things on their menu! Their portions -entrees and desserts- are similarly massive! I went to this Cheesecake Factory in Durham for a celebratory dinner with friends. The manager came over and offered me a complimentary soup or salad after apologizing and saying my chicken was overcooked. The waitress was also really sweet and refilled our bread whenever she saw that our basket was empty. The ambiance was really nice, but the wait for seating was excruciatingly long (we found out later that the kitchen apparently got backed up on orders). I went in the evening and their lights dimmed mid-meal, which created a romantic date setting for couples around us but made eating with a bigger crowd feel less inviting. I think the dimmed lights also increased the speed at which I entered a food coma."
Katie C.,"Bracey, VA",43,28,55,1.0,3/6/2016,"I would give this location more stars but we received poor service.  Our waiter decided to stand behind our table and tell the customers that their table and the table beside them were his ""best customers"".  As we were waiting to give him our order... Finally he decided to come take our order. And that was last time we saw him for 30 mins.  Another friendly server brought our food out and made sure we were okay.  Our waiter only checked on us one time in the entire visit.  We were a table of 6 with 4 kids.  I feel we were discriminated against because of our race.  He and his ""two favorite tables were of a different race than my family and I.  I will not visit this location again.  The food was good but the service was horrible.  Although we did  leave him a tip my husband decided to write him a little note on the check explaining to him why his tip was not bigger.  God bless the ignorance of racism."
Marvin S.,"Durham, NC",9,40,3,2.0,5/7/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory, the halllowed halls of the world renowned cheesecake. We've all heard the stories of their fine cuisine and their better-than-sex desserts. I used to go to the one in Raleigh (Glenwood Ave locale) and it was decent, not bad. So I was in the neighborhood at Southpoint last night, date night with the wife. Dinner and a movie, thought we'd start at TCF. I read reviews prior to goingm as I was curious, this being my first time at this location. One reviewer mentioned that their waiter never smiled. So after we arrived and waited 15 minutes for our table, we were finally seated. The person who escorted us, some goofy six foot tall lug of a guy with the personality of a potted palm and never smiled. For a matter of fact, as I watched the employees... sunnuvagun, there were few people who smiled. I know there were easily 10 waiers/servers, a few busboys, and a manager who seemed to look through people instead of smiling and greeting the customers in passing. No smiles... dangnest thing I have seen, So anyway we were seated at our table. First thing I noticed was the table as dirty. No no, not dirty plates on the table, I mean grime and filth on the table! Encrusted with the last ten people's food or whatever. That was gross! I took some of the water from my water glass, dipped my napkin in it and cleaned the table myself. But I wrote this off as them being busy. Afterall, this is THE Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the burger, but I wanted something else but was afraid, due to our time crunch, something beyond a burger may through the kitchen in a panick and delay my food by half an hour. So I did a burger and mashed potatoes (can't stand greasy fries!). My wife ordered the salad with grilled chicken. I should take a moment to spotlight the only bright spot in my experience... Jazmine. She was a delight. Smiled, very personable, she was the only reason we did not just get up and leave. IMO, try to get in Jazmine's area when you visit, she and one other waitress were the only ones who seemed to smile and was pleasant. And believe me, I was watching! We were there for 45 minutes, and of everyone there, only two peope... sorry, I was going on a tangent. My burger was a crispy critter when it came out (24 minutes after ordering). It came on a wheat bun, which was ok. All of the necessary condiments and accrumon was right. My wife's salad was wrong....how do you mess up a grilled chicken salad? They forgot the chicken. So tack on another minute or two for the lovely and takented Jazmine to go back there, kick their rocks to get some chicken as ordered! We also got the dessert... and one would seriously hope they couldn't muck up their signature dish. We got the low carb cheese cake, with a side of strawberries (fresh) and whipped cream (made there?). All delicious as it should be.  As I was paying the check, i Noticed the guy at the next table left and the busboy came and cleared off the table before resetting. But wait.... one tiny little thing was missed. He never washed the table, not a single wet rag, spray bottle, nothing. Just took the plates and such away, then set it back up with another set of plates, glasses, etc.  No wonder our table was cruded up... unclean.... because they do not clean the tables! GROSS! Upside to the experience: Jazmine The Cheesecake Downside... everything else! Change management, because obviously management is unaware or just dont care. They set the standard, they set the example and from what I saw from the management, they need to clean house... Literally and Personnel-wise"
Israel H.,"New York, NY",522,572,165,4.0,7/15/2012,So update.. The food seemed much better this time.. it seems that it depends when you come.. the chefs have shifts and if you get the right one.. the food is really good.
D B.,"Cary, NC",3,52,33,5.0,5/11/2015,Cheesecake factory is always consistent with a huge menu and of course great desserts. We haven't been here in a while and forget how much we enjoy the place. And the decor is pretty amazing as well. Next time toy walk in the front doors look up at the atrium ceiling. Attention to detail is really nice.
Danielle D.,"Morrisville, NC",0,20,1,5.0,11/24/2015,We went to this restaurant on a Friday evening around the busy 6:00 hour.  We were told the wait would be 20 minutes but were seated in about 15.  We had our 15 month old with us and the server was fantastic in ensuring that his food came out right away!!  It was a very positive service experience!
David B.,"Durham, NC",1,9,,1.0,5/1/2015,"Very bad experience. Food was horribly prepared and cook did not know difference between plain pico de gallo and plain tomatoes. After pointing this out to the server the item was taken back, had the tomatoes removed, then added more cheese and stuck in a broiler until burned and served as such. Horrible experience, would give 0 or .5 stars if allowed to."
Kurt H.,"Raleigh, NC",19,107,68,3.0,5/6/2014,"It's the Cheesecake Factory.  A massive menu with portions to match.  My wife enjoys eating here. And I do not.  It's not that the food isn't acceptably good to very good, depending on the entree (and by that, I mean only one entree: The Hibachi steak. A big hand for the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Marinated Hanger Steak...one of the few entrees that's good,even if you take home leftovers). The ambiance is cold and uninviting, the seating is uncomfortable, and the clientele can tend toward the juvenile. We were lucky enough to be seated next to a bratty party of 13-15 year olds whose parents either didn't know/didn't care that they weren't ready for presentation to the general public yet. Or maybe they did, because all ten of them were there without adult supervision. The service is OK to meh, all around.  Combined with the price, there are other places that I'd rather eat, even if their menus don't resemble a large, hardbound novel. The cheesecakes are very good. The Mango and the Red Velvet cheesecake deserve special mention here. Just get it to go, though. It's not worth the wait or the cost, unless you are just in love with a chain. Better options exist for adults in the immediate area."
Adrienne P.,"Carrboro, NC",6,15,,3.0,7/17/2015,"So, it's a chain. There are definitely some good menu options and I like the variety, but you have to be smart about what you're getting. Like, it's the Cheesecake Factory, probably don't order the seafood. The cocktails are not great, but the bartender was nice! After his game of heads up...can't hate."
Laurie V.,"North Canton, OH",502,980,462,2.0,11/1/2013,"Usually I don't frequent, nor review chains, but I can't not. Look, I'm not trying to sound snobby or elitest, but quite frankly the cost of sub-par chain food is way more expensive than the flavorful local-grown stuff. My friend has a 3 year old, so she wanted to go somewhere close to the mall that offered a kid's menu.   I'll just make a list of things that annoy me about this place: 1)  The ""buzzer"" went off, indicating our table was ready.  We proceeded to the Hostess Podium.  Our table was not, in fact, ready, so we were left standing there.  Right in the way.  And trying to keep a 3 year old still is like keeping 40 corks under water all at once.  It was awkward and agitating.  2)  It smells like a wet dish towel in there.  3)  Crumbs on my seat.  Host made no effort to wipe them off, so I did so myself with the extra linen sitting on our table.   4) Portions are ridiculously huge.  Not practical at all.  5)  Our server was pretty good, but the food runner ""auctioned off"" the food.  Unprofessional.  I was a server for years.  You know which plate belongs to which person.  Pretty unpractical to put a jumbo Ceasar salad in front of a 3 year old.  6) ""Jumbo"" is the best way to describe the ""lunch"" portion.  7)  Food Runner #2 showed up with ""kid's portion"", which was also jumbo.  She put it in front of said kid with a ramekin of mayonnaise on the side.  Inevitably the mayonnaise falls off the plate and onto the floor.  8)  The food runner didn't offer more napkins, nor anything else to wipe said mayo off the floor, so of course yours truly steps upon it.  9)  Overpriced 10) Loud 11) This one may qualify as hear-say, but I've heard that they have downgraded their ingredients as a cost-saving measure.  It tastes like it.  12) I hate their ""sister restaurant"", PF Changs too.    This place sucks."
Susan P.,"Durham, NC",6,131,9,3.0,6/28/2014,"To be fair I'm not a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  In NY, they had to put the calorie information on the menu and it was really eye opening.  We went in a group for dessert and I knew it wasn't going to be anything I'd want. Had a small part of my husband's brownie sundae.  Giant mounds of whipped cream larger than the Edy's ice cream.  The ""brownie"" was really more like fudge or cheesecake it was so thick!  One of our friends got the lemon tart thing, but when it came out it looked like a cake instead of a tart, she said it tasted lemony, but barely touched it.  Her and her husband finished his chocolate chip cheesecake without complaint. The service was alright.  I know we were just having dessert, but the water refills were slow and after we paid the check, they didn't touch them at all.  This location is also really loud on the inside.  We had to sit outside to have a conversation."
Rebecca T.,"Durham, NC",1,2,,1.0,4/5/2015,"Really unimpressed with my dinner this evening. LOADS of flies infesting the place, cold food, waitresses MIA and disinterested management. My niece and I stopped in for an early dinner around 4pm and were ready to order almost immediately, but the waitress kept inexplicably walking away. I asked for water, and was about to give our order, but she walked away to get the water. While she was doing that, my niece said she wanted a cherry soda. When she got back with the water, I asked if they had cherry soda. She offered a Shirley Temple, which was fine by me. Then she walked away again before I could order the food we wanted. THEN when she got back with my niece's drink, I asked if that could be considered the soda for the kids' meal. She said yes, and it came with refills - great! I ended up switching my order to the Miso Salmon on her recommendation, which was just okay, definitely not great. The food took a really long time to arrive for such a non-busy time, especially given how little time it takes to  cook salmon. My niece actually fell asleep while we were waiting, after trying unsuccessfully to shoo several flies away from our table. My fish was lukewarm at best when it arrived at the table, though my niece loved her (huge) serving of mac & cheese. I asked our waitress for an extra order of snow peas on the side because I'd assumed the notation ""with snow peas"" in the menu meant a serving of snow peas, not five peas for garnish, as it turned out. My peas never came. Neither did I get a chance to ask for a lemon wedge for my fish, which was a little bland in addition to being cold. My niece's drink had also been empty and awaiting a refill for some time. I was practically standing up on the bench looking for the waitress, who was nowhere in sight, though I saw other waiters appear and disappear a few times. We actually ended up leaving our table because the flies were getting more numerous, and I heard other diners commenting as well. When she finally came back I just asked for a box and the check, though I'd planned to get a cocktail and share a dessert with my niece when I walked in, and even just that took a while. I asked to speak to a manager as a left, who gave me lip service and took off the price of the kids' meal as a courtesy, though I noticed afterwards that the Shirley Temple had been charged in addition to the kids's meal instead of being counted as the drink. I did not feel that she really listened to my concerns about all the flies or the non-attendant service, and just fed me a whole bunch of canned lines like, ""I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am"" with a tight smile and glazed eyes. I've had okay experiences here before, but never a great one, and this was my first REALLY BAD experience. I won't be going back for a worse one."
