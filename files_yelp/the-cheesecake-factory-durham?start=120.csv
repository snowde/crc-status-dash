Meerkat R.,"Charlotte, NC",0,108,4,5.0,6/12/2016,I don't normally review chain restaurants.. The food is ok.. Nothing special.. Portion sizes big enough to feed 4. 2500 calories in any given entree.. Whatever. I'm writing this review for the service.. I've been here twice and had two of the best servers I've ever had. Keep up the great work.
Steve M.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,13,,5.0,8/19/2015,"THIS PLACE IS DOOOOOPE. CHRIS' OUTRAGEOUS CHEESECAKE IS DANK. Spaghetti and Meatballs is pretty good. Service is as good as you can expect. Yea, prices are a bit high for the food, but the star of the show at Cheesecake Factory is, well, the cheesecake. I recommend Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake for people who like coconut, chocolate, and pecans. Tiramisu cheesecake is dope too."
Lucky 1 3.,"Carrboro, NC",99,425,71,4.0,10/9/2013,"I'm definitely a fan when you don't have to wait...which was the case yesterday and really the only reason I decided to eat there.  I don't like cheesecake but I like options and this place has that in spades.   I expected this place to be bigger but I think the mirror make it look bigger than it is and the seating is a little compact which considering the size of the portions you'd think they'd have larger seats. The service is excellent and friendly.  Turn around is quick with drinks and the entrees came out at a reasonable time.  I had a skinnyliscious salad with added chicken.  The calorie count was about 650 with the chicken make it over their usual caloric amount they advertise.  But there is no way you could eat that in one setting and I'm a big, messy eater and even I had leftovers.   I did try the cheesecake and nope, I still don't like cheesecake.  I think it is the cheese part I don't like.  NO, I'm sure it's the cheese part I don't like  But the red velvet cake part was scrumptious so I just ate around it and had leftovers. I'd go back and try some of their other skinnyliscious entrees.  That menu sounded better than their regular menu in fact."
Bethany A.,"Evanston, IL",312,315,50,3.0,12/29/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is by no means my favorite restaurant at Southpoint, but I've had... fairly okay experiences here. Their pasta dishes are fine, not the best but not awful. I came here with a large party for my cousin's birthday and our waitress was very accomodating. Dishes that were a hit include the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and the Santa Fe salad. I had the lunch portion for the Cobb salad and it was a little disappointing. There was a lot, but some portions were underdressed and then the blue cheese chunks were a bit big so in some bites that was all I could taste.  My brother ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles and was disappointed because they tasted like burnt McNuggets. The fish dishes were fine and my cousin enjoyed his Louisiana pasta.  Cheesecake was decadent as usual."
Joshua S.,"Lillington, NC",36,48,,4.0,5/8/2015,"its a pretty good cheesecake factory, haven't been to a bad one yet. It does get crowded so you may have to wait. The only think I don't like about The Cheesecake Factory is that you have to sit so ridiculously close to the people next to you unless you happen to get one of the booths or you sit outside."
Sara V.,"Jacksonville, NC",74,52,,4.0,4/4/2015,"The farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic does look and taste pretty good. I ordered it without the mushrooms, pancetta, and caramelized onions. It's very flavorful, a party in my mouth. The only thing is is that the bow tie noodles are a little underdone. It is due to the kitchen being rushed since they were backed up from being busy. The sourdough bread and the honey wheat bread is addicting. The waitress is friendly, smiled a lot, and checked up on us a good number of times."
Monica B.,"Durham, NC",7,11,4,5.0,5/2/2015,"On Thursday April 30, my Department went to have a goodbye  luncheon  for our CFO. Our waiter/server Mark C was wonderful!!! He made sure that we had our drinks. Our glasses were alway full and our food came out in record time!!!  I had the ""Crusted Salmon  Salad and it was ""AWESOME"" if I must say myself!! While the salad normally is served with the cold  salmon,  Marc allow me to change it to hot salmon.  I had not eaten at the Cheesecake Factory in a long time but, I must say I will be back and will ask to be seated in his section!!! Oh,  when we finished our meal, we all ordered cheesecake, however, I ordered tye Reese Peanutbutter cheescake for my hubby and HE LOVED IT!! The food was fantastic  and  MARK C is a keeper!!! Please visit the Cheesecake Factory!!!!"
Johnny L.,"Lafayette, CA",116,496,410,3.0,1/10/2013,"Pretty tasty cheesecake, went after a movie next door.  Each piece of cheesecake is as caloric and bad for you as it is tasty, which in lay terms means if you eat an entire piece, you will die of a coronary within minutes. Ya feel me?"
M S.,"Rocky Mount, NC",12,15,3,4.0,4/9/2014,Definately a redo!! I can't get enough of the Tiramisu cheesecake. Service was great at this location too (:
Terry W.,"Pittsboro, NC",86,709,1995,2.0,12/16/2010,"I have been to numerous Cheesecake Factories across the USA. I have always had a above average meal and service here. Of course the Cheesecakes are the prize.  I suggest you have desert first, then if you have enough room you can order the main course. This works better for me because I usually order just a appetizer afterward instead of the main course. I do not have to walk out feeling like a stuffed well you know. Oink Oink.  I have always loved  the decor. It feels like I am in an Egyptian Tomb spending the afterlife with all the Gods. That would be after the third GG and tonic.  The Miso Salmon was excellent. Our friend from Hawaii said it was  delicious also.  If you just stop in for a drink at the bar , desert, or a meal. Cheesecake will deliver an excellent experience. You can not go wrong.  Be sure to eat desert first. Recent visits . 2015 poor service, order was wrong. This Cheesecake has lower standards than the others. Second time in a row this has happened here. Will not return."
Daniela S.,"Durham, NC",0,7,,2.0,5/1/2015,I have been there a few times and I like their Oreo cheesecake (that could deserve 4 stars) but every thing I eat there (besides the cheesecake) gives me a terrible stomach ache
Ms W.,"Mebane, NC",1,27,10,1.0,2/21/2016,"Tried to make reservations on a Tuesday night at 6:30. They said they didn't take reservations. Completely understandable, but they told us to have someone arrive at 6:15 and they would hold tables for us. We did so for a party of 20.  They were waiting on a certain table to leave to sit our party.  At 7:20 they agreed to partially seat our party because there were several children with us. At 7:45 we had to flag a server down to order the children's food. Our drinks were always empty. We had to ask or remind them the adults hadn't ordered.  Took over 30 mins to get our cheesecakes we ordered and check.  I understand it was our choice to eat at a place with a large party without a reservation but the poor service and the lack of any ""service recovery"" for this horrible experience is inexcusable. The only redeeming factor is that the food was good. They were however out of ribeye steaks and captain Morgan so a couple guys in our party were even more upset than I was."
Naomi K.,"Okinawa, Japan",432,1824,4621,3.0,8/1/2013,"The good thing about the cheesecake is it's consistent. That's probably why people like chain restaurants. I like non-chains because I think there's a  lot more variety. You go to a restaurant for their specialty. This place- well, obviously their desserts. But they did a decent job with their bbq salmon, paired with mash potatoes and a sprinkle of colorful veggies (very tasty, but I wish there was more, not just for color presentation). The patio on the mall strip is perfect for people watching on a warm summer day, as long as it doesn't rain. Open air conversation can be liberating. Inside it was over-airconditioned and the loud voices reverberated to a deafening sound. Definitely sit outside while the summer lasts."
Angella L.,"Durham, NC",0,16,2,5.0,3/20/2015,"Dined in almost every time because the experience is worth it. All the servers I've had were good to amazing, friendly and attentive. I would recommend any of the pasta dishes, and for appetizers, the avocado egg rolls, and mac and cheese balls. Also the free bread is nice."
Bill P.,"Chapel Hill, NC",21,24,,2.0,6/12/2015,"Let me first say that I have been to Cheesecake Factory several times and I am always pleased with my meal, the service, etc.  I normally would give them 4 stars.  Last night was different.  Service was poor and, more importantly, the food was horrible.  We order the Thai lettuce wraps and fish tacos -- thoroughly disappointing.  We've had the lettuce wraps before and they changed the recipe.  Everything lacked taste and was incredibly bland.  We left very disappointed and might not return given the prices are still quite high."
Andrew R.,"Durham, NC",55,88,,1.0,8/14/2012,"I'd give it 4 stars for the atmosphere and the way the food tastes, but, every time I've eaten here, I get sick.  I get violently sick.  In all likelihood it's just me. Like I said, the food tastes good, and I'd give it 4 stars without thinking twice if my system would just agree with it. I honestly suggest checking it out, with the understanding that it's a known quantity, and it will please most palates.  But, if you, like me, get sick afterwards, you might consider avoiding the chain altogether."
Chris H.,"Cary, NC",4,117,1,4.0,8/31/2013,Really enjoyed my Warm asparagus salad.  It is a new menu item and it was very good as I was freezing that evening.  I also had Irish coffee (very good) and the soup of the day - can you sense a theme here.   My husband had one of the Salmon Salads which he enjoyed but next will get the normal meal as he felt like there was just too much lettuce. Our server was great -she was very attentive and very sweet.  We went late on a Friday night (10PM) and did not have to wait at all - however we did get seated very close to another couple. The place is decorated very nicely and everything is very clean.
Sarah B.,"Durham, NC",87,44,31,5.0,11/7/2014,"My husband took me here to eat after a tough week. It never disappoints. Our waiter, Ryan, was amazing, attentive, and incredibly kind. The food was incredible. I had the fish and chips for my entree and it was delicious. I also got a tasty peach Bellini. I got a slice of caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. It's my favourite and always amazing!"
Danielle R.,"Greensboro, NC",46,381,145,5.0,4/15/2013,Thai lettuce wraps..that's all I can say. I get them EVERY time I go because they are so good and I have leftovers too (or I share them with someone else). The bacon lentil soup is also fantastic! I just wish we had this place in Greensboro!
Vicky C.,"Durham, NC",2,17,1,3.0,1/26/2013,"I like The Cheesecake Factory primarily for having a ""skinny menu"", it's hard to eat out and eat healthy but here you can do both.  Last week Saturday we were looking for a late dinner as we just flew into town from the west coast. Because of the generous hours we managed to get seated and have a lovely dinner just after midnight.  I can only give this location 3 stars because twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner, I've had a chicken salad with crunchy rice. It must have been old and dried out. Not tasty. Otherwise I like the atmosphere and the menu, and the late hours, and the occasional  (shared) cheesecake."
