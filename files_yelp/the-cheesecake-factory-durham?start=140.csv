Dan M.,"Wake Forest, NC",1,13,8,1.0,6/17/2014,"Was only able to make it to one star because I never got a chance to try the food. Arrived with the family (4), it was quiet not very busy on a Tue afternoon. However, we were asked to wait while a table was prepared and were given a pager. We proceeded to check out the cheesecakes. After almost 10 mins we started wondering what was going on, when we noticed people walking in and getting seated right away. It appears that the hostess forgot all about us.  We opted to walk next door to Firebirds, a much better decision. Customer service was MUCH better there."
Tiffany R.,"Durham, NC",31,63,73,3.0,3/17/2013,"The wait staff can be a little lackluster at times but it's the Cheesecake factory. I like to call it tried and true, whenever i have no where else in mind to eat i'll always go here to get something.  Weekends are insane, but the wait time isnt as bad as the location at crabtree.  The cheesecake is definitely the staple feature here. My current favorite is the oreo cheesecake :) Oreos are everywhere!  I say when in doubt, go here, the menu is so huge I'm sure they'll have something you like."
Barbara B.,"San Francisco, CA",264,269,61,3.0,5/23/2012,"Had a business lunch here yesterday with 8 co-workers and was pretty satisfied. I shared a Thai Lettuce Wraps app with a couple of people and it was absolutely delicious. It was recommended to me by a friend who goes to the Cheesecake Factory a lot as the one of the best appetizers and she was definitely on the money. There were enough wraps and ingredients to make 6 wraps and my manager had it as an entree just to give you an idea of the portion sizes.  I had the Rib Eye and Mashed Potatoes for an entree and unfortunately I was very very underwhelmed by the Rib Eye, hence the reluctant 3 star rating. But the Mashed Potatoes were absolutely heavenly. I'm sure it's because it's loaded with butter but I would definitely recommend it. The portion was also big enough for 3 meals. I got the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake, but I think the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake or Tower Cake is better. From previous experiences, I'd also recommend the Herb Crusted Salmon and Chicken Madeira.  The Southpoint location was very empty for lunch, but it definitely gets crowded at dinner time. We got excellent service and our waiter was funny to boot. The bill was pretty high for lunch but I always think that the portion size at the Cheesecake Factory justifies the price tag. Overall, pretty satisfied, but I have to ding them for the entree."
Sue W.,"Raleigh, NC",660,128,340,3.0,4/1/2014,"I ordered ""bang bang chicken""  it was good but of course I was at the Cheese Cake Factory not a typical asian restaurant.  So for the american restaurant taste it was pretty good for asian food."
Lys L.,"Fayetteville, NC",1,57,3,1.0,6/19/2016,"Let me start by saying CF is my favorite restaurant chain. I went here every week when I lived in Hawaii. I moved here and tried this location and was very very disappointed. My cousin was in town on vacation and it was her first night. We want here. My husband and I got our food and then 5 mins later she got hers. She asked for a medium well steak, cut into it and it was pure blood . The waiter asked if he could take the steak and go cook it more. It was already burnt on the outside but the inside was blood. She need a whole new steak . He seemed he had an issue with trying to get her a whole new steak done the right way and she wanted new sides as well(so they would not get cold) It took 30 mins. My Hubby and I did not want to eat our food while she waited on her new plate. Our food was then cold waiting for her food. There is. I reason why it should take that long. It should of been on the fly. We wanted a nice dinner and they ruined it. But that's not the end . My husband ordered the Jamaican plate and it was missing the platanos (my husband told the waiter, he didn't even know ) my plate came out with Coleslwa when I told the waiter not to include it, but I still got it.  The waiter did not ask if we even wanted to speak to a manager after all this, so I had to ask. She came to apologize and it was not really sincere in my opinion. I guess she apologiez for the food, but she didn't realize that they ruined the whole night. She took off the steak plate off the Menu and gave my husband a free cheesecake . I feel that my whole meal should of been free because this was the worst team restaurant experience of my life and that sad part is is that it was at my fav place to eat. I hope this goes to corporate. If not I will just email them myself . The waiter should have gotten a manager immediately so they could fix the food and it not take 40 mins ."
Jim N.,"Winchester, KY",22,498,13,3.0,5/28/2012,"Met two other couples for dinner after the movies last evening and had a really nice experience.  We were seated quickly, even though they were really busy.  Drinks came quickly. Menu was vast....around the table, we had salmon, a salad, soup & sandwich, pasta, fish tacos, and flat-bread pizza, followed by cheesecake and coffee. Great food....a bit slow; but, not when you consider how busy they were, and besides, they left us to enjoy ourselves in a large corner booth which was nice.  Everyone was happy and the prices were very reasonable.  They remain a good place for lunch or dinner, especially when you're already out at the Streets of Southpoint shopping or people-watching, or at the theater. Oh, and this time they had what we wanted to drink, so drinkers were happy too!"
Tim W.,"Cary, NC",139,3,1,4.0,8/3/2014,"One of my favorite places to eat, menu is so diverse. Found something in my salad this time but the manager handled it superbly."
Joe P.,"Greenville, SC",4,8,,3.0,4/10/2014,Food is ok but does anyone really need THAT much food on one plate!?! Also - probably the most unhealthy food on the planet.
Tejune K.,"Manhattan, NY",291,33,6270,4.0,4/2/2012,"usually way too crowded for it to be worth the wait.  i usually get the chicken madeira and avocado eggrolls.  hard to go wrong w/ those choices!   eat the bar, fastest way to do it or even order to-go and food will be much faster.  turtle cheesecake if i still have room."
Chelsea G.,"Sanford, NC",0,2,1,1.0,10/3/2014,"While the food was excellent, the experience was so horrible I doubt I'll ever go again.  We went on a Wednesday night, hoping it would be less crowded, which it was. We were told it would be a 15 min wait- no problem. 25 mins later, our pager went off so we went to be seated, but between the 3 hostesses no one seemed to actually be seating people. We had asked to sit outside, but after another 10 mins of waiting they finally put us at a table inside. It took another 10 mins for a server to come to our table, and it was another 40 mins before we got our food.  Maybe I'm crazy, but when my meal is costing $60 for 2 people, and it's a Wednesday night, it seems a little ridiculous that I'm waiting 1.5 hours for my meal, with rude service in between. Even though the food was great, I sure will not do it again."
M D.,"Morrisville, NC",0,12,,2.0,2/25/2014,"Terrible experience!  I thought Cheesecake maintains its quality no matter when and which location you go to; I must say I was wrong.  I came here today with my wife for a quiet outing at 11:45 am for an early lunch, I tell you their daily soup special - Mexican Tortilla Chicken Soup was served cold, not kidding.  The server brought me the fresh serving, it was still cold.  Pathetic!! Let's talk about my lunch order of Herb Crusted Salmon with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus; overall terrible.  The presentation killed my appetite there and then.  Mashed potatoes were stale and ugly looking and asparagus was hard and half-cooked.   I guess only Salmon saved the rating to 2 stars.."
Alan S.,"Calypso, NC",0,3,2,2.0,4/4/2012,"After hearing both my wife and brother rave about the restaurant I decided to check it out.  Both my wife and son enjoyed their meals... And the cheesecake was delicious!!! My choice of a bacon burger with blue cheese was a HUGE mistake. My wife, then later my brother, said it was a bad choice on my part - ""I wouldn't get a burger unless the place was known for them...etc"" to which I replied ""Anyone who charges $12 for a burger should make one worth it or take it off the menu"". It was twice the cost of a Hardee's burger and not half the taste of one.  The service was less than stellar. Aside from being slow the concept of silverware & napkin for all guests was a concept lost on the waiter..."
Sarah K.,"Kernersville, NC",61,209,17,3.0,3/19/2012,I always go here expecting more and end up leaving a little unfulfilled. I tried the skinny sangria and it was not good at all. I should have just got the normal one.  Our waiter was super friendly but the bill was high(to be expected). I got the red velvet cheesecake which didn't disappoint.
Hank D.,"Holly Springs, NC",42,96,10,2.0,4/12/2014,"The food is your basic, institutional, Cheesecake Factory fare.  Got seated pretty quickly , however, waited at least 30 min to get our food.  Food was acceptable at best, however, you can probably tell I am not a Cheesecake Factory fan.  My two stars are generous since I avoid these places if the choice is all mine!"
Lisa M.,"Durham, NC",1,10,1,1.0,6/17/2014,The service at this location was atrocious. We were treated so badly by the host we ended up walking out before we were even seated. I know the food is generally good but I would skip this location and try the Crabtree Mall one instead.
Ellen C.,"Falls Church, VA",130,380,219,4.0,5/14/2011,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory since my grad school roomie introduced their yummy avocado eggrolls to me. This place is my go-to spot if I happen to be shopping at Southpoint Mall and need to nosh in a casual environment (e.g. with baby in tow). The menu is extensive, portions are huge, and the service is typically fast and friendly. Despite my best intentions to be adventurous, I can't stop ordering the delectable avocado eggrolls with cilantro dipping sauce. Other great dishes are: the Luau Salad, Chicken Bellagio, and Portabello Mushroom Burger. On the other hand, the turkey and beef burgers are fine but nothing to write home about. Dessert is a whole other subject-- the best cheesecake I've ever had in my life, I've had here. Do NOT pass up the seasonal mango lime cheesecake with mango mousse and purée if you enjoy tropical flavours. Yes, it's a chain. However, its convenient location, large portions of great food and amazing cheesecakes can't be beat."
Jon L.,"Miami, FL",776,22,6,3.0,9/2/2013,I feel service at TCF is slipping.  Consistently long wait times with so many closed seating sections puzzles me.  Limited options in the past might have given them a false since of security.
Jake P.,"Washington, DC",31,76,59,4.0,3/4/2011,"1. I hate chain food, not as much as buffet (aka. The trough). 2. I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.           But make sure you go to the one at the southpoint mall (ie.- this one). Because the other one is horrible and you will be sorry!!!      The food is always good here and the service is better, the only problem is the wait time, but I don't mind waiting for something good.      Word to the wise, watch out for their top shelf margarita.... It'll sneak up on you!!!! Lol"
Dawn B.,"Durham, NC",174,57,20,3.0,2/26/2013,"I heart the mango key lime cheesecake.  i just went to the bar for cocktails and cake, so I didn't experience the whole sha-bang. BUT I did have three different cheesecake flavors (split with my best girlfriend, of course) and that one was hands-down delicious."
Kathryn E.,"Greensboro, NC",78,224,,5.0,2/19/2011,"One of my favorite things about the Triangle area is the plethora of ""non-chain"", local places. The CF is one of my exceptions to this rule.  Things I love about this restaurant: 1) Consistently delicious, huge-portions 2) Fabulous unending bread basket, wheat bread is best 3) amazing variety- you never get tired of the menu! 4) luxurious-feeling interior with (usually) great service You can't go wrong with this restaurant! Love it!"
