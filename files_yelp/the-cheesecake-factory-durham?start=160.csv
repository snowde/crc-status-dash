Derecka H.,"Clayton, NC",19,18,2,4.0,12/26/2013,"The quality of food seems to have lessened over time. Not how I remember Cheesecake Factory from years ago... service was just fine and even got help finding a dish i liked through the looooong menu. The portions are large but im happy with that considering the price. Overall i would go back but im disappointed at the ""chain"" type vibe i get from them now..."
Adam B.,"Durham, NC",154,337,1027,4.0,9/26/2013,"So you know what you're getting when you come here, but consistency is a good thing. It's especially impressive that they manage to be so consistent with such a huge menu. They're not breaking any new culinary ground obviously, but they're doing the basics right. Aside from reliable food and a menu that will provide something for any diner, the two highlights here are location (just across from the movie theater, so great for a pre-show drink and snack) and a great staff, especially at the bar. They seem to have low turnover, so you'll see the same friendly folks often. I've tried lots of the dishes on the menu and they've all been good to very good. Particular favorites are the (unhealthy) Mexican egg roll (on the appetizer menu, but it will make a meal) and the pear and endive salad off the Skinnylicious menu. I didn't feel especially manly ordering the Skinnylicious salad, but it was really good and knowing that it was under 600 calories was a plus. In addition, it was a nice portion, which is a change from some low-cal menus where you get an ounce of food. Oh and best of all, they have Stone IPA on the beer list."
Melissa I.,"Denver, CO",34,292,38,4.0,9/5/2011,"Again, I usually prefer non-chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory remains my favorite of all the chains. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable. And, of course, the cheesecake is to die for. At this location, expect long waits and a very loud atmosphere."
Mario G.,"Manor, TX",0,67,,4.0,1/19/2014,You have been to one CCF you have been to all.  I travel all over the country and this one will be just as good as your local CCF.  Enjoy!
Susan Z.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,16,,1.0,2/5/2014,The wait was horrendous. Over twenty minutes what we were told.... ended up waiting an hour... the cheesecake doe
Tina W.,"New York, NY",399,896,1164,3.0,7/17/2013,i love their cheese cake
Jenita M.,"Lumberton, NC",89,412,1402,5.0,12/8/2010,"I was out of town and decided to stop through after leaving the mall to get a cheesecake to go.  After looking through the menu and glass display, I wasn't sure which delicious cake to choose from.  After talking to a baker, he told me about a lot of them.  I've had the red velvet and Kahlua before.  I decided to go with texture this time and chose the ""White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake"".  That cheesecake was well worth the stop.  The whip cream didn't even smelt or side during my hour drive back home.  The crust was AMAZING! The staff was eager to help you in every way!"
Eric H.,"San Jose, CA",320,516,149,4.0,6/5/2010,"What is it about eating way too big a portion of good food that makes you feel drunk afterward? I like coming to any Cheesecake Factory, this one is especially nice being at the streets mall, that way you have a chance to walk off the food comma afterward.  The food was a good as always, the waiter service was OK but that is pretty normal for a Cheesecake Factory.  All in all I recommend this place to anyone looking to stuff themselves until they are about to explode, then have some dessert."
Grace B.,"Durham, NC",56,90,19,4.0,9/4/2012,"I hadn't been here in years, and when a friend  suggested going for dinner I was hesitant ... but caved, and we went.  It was busy for a Monday night, probably due to it being Labor Day weekend. We waited 15-20 minutes and were seated & greeted by our server promptly.  She was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable of menu items on the extensive menu. Speaking of menu, it's overwhelming!  I ordered a draft beer, and had I known they charged $5.75 I would've thought twice about it. Ridiculously overpriced for a Fat Tire, if you ask me.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps (Asian style) from the ""Skinny-licious"" menu, and was very impressed with the flavor. It was a big enough serving to fill me up, it was well-prepared, and something I'd definitely order again. My friend had a few appetizers and seemed happy with her meal. We passed on the cheesecake, though I'm regretting that decision today! Based on my experience, I'd go back - which is a big improvement from last time I went. Sure, it's a chain restaurant, but they seemed to care more about preparing their menu items this time around ... which is the reason I'd return."
Joey P.,"Richmond, VA",358,27,1,5.0,8/6/2013,Delicious !!!!!   Try the Reese's PB Cheesecake and the Fried Mac N Cheese !  Pure heaven !
Eve P.,"Durham, NC",28,191,4,2.0,6/4/2010,"I was with Rhea C. who reviewed right below me, so I don't need to go into detail on the recent very poor experience we had at Cheesecake. But I couldn't resist echoing her disappointment. I've worked for a chain restaurant before, so I know they usually give the staff lots of standardized training - and our service was remarkably bad, particularly the situation his taking FOREVER for our checks and wasting time to complain to US about the process when he could have been spending that time hurrying to do it as quickly as possible.  That said, I am certain I will still have my Cheesecake Factory cravings. Unlike Rhea C., I drool over the very long and detailed cheesecake menu, imagining bites of each one until one sounds just right. So I will be back - but I hope the management reminds the staff that there are LOTS of good restaurants in Durham. So without good service, the wait at Cheesecake is going to get much shorter. Oh - and we went to Champs across the way for cheesecake after the movies, and it was pretty darn good...so there's even competition on that front, folks!"
Serena S.,"Miami Beach, FL",75,202,155,4.0,3/20/2010,"I'm usually not that big on chain restaurants, but how can you resist those 1500 calorie slices of heaven?  If you're counting calories, don't bother coming here. I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factories over the years and I've never been disappointed by their food.  The only thing that turns me off about this place is the fact that they don't do reservations and the wait is always long unless you come at odd hours, and even then, it can still be a long wait sometimes.  However, I think the long wait is a good testament of how good their food is.  I used to have a friend that worked at a Cheesecake factory, so I had the opportunity to try every cheesecake there.  Well, 30 out of 32 at least.  I didn't bother trying their low carb ones because like I said, if you're counting calories or counting carbs, why  bother?  I'm a big fan of their banana cream cheesecake and I don't even like bananas that much!   I think the dessert that doesn't get enough attention here is their strawberry shortcake.  My significant other isn't much of a cheesecake person like I am, so he usually opts for that instead.  Believe me when I say that it's the kind of dessert you need to share.  It's a mountain of strawberries, shortcake, fresh whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  Deeeelish! Out of all the dishes I've tried here, my favorite is the bistro shrimp pasta.  It's phe-nom-enal!  Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce....need I say more?  For those of you who love avocados, the avocado eggroll appetizer is really good.   Don't be scared of the long line when you come here, it's worth the wait, I promise :)"
Joel S.,"Durham, NC",8,6,,2.0,9/18/2013,"This place is overrated. I took my wife there for mother day. Something happened with our order, 30 minutes pass the waiter did tell us anything. So it took about hour and half to get our food. The manager knew it was there mistake and the only thing he said was sorry for your wait. I was going to ask for anything since I was with my wife and didn't want to be rude but I could tell they could careless. They gave me another reason not to spend my money there."
Mark G.,"Livermore, CA",6,182,6,3.0,12/13/2010,"They're open and I'm hungry - my original quick tip. Pros: Open later than other full service restaurants. Wide, expansive menu. Big, open seating. Fair, if not pleasant service including bread at the table. Of course, their desserts. Cons: Meals are formula.  Prepared, not created. My meal of shrimp pasta tore my intestines up creating a fog of death 24 hours later.  I must remember to avoid. This isn't the cheapest on earth.  I have fond memories visiting in cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, and Atlanta.  Its certainly a once-every-two years type of place to visit.  Just avoid the shrimp!"
Keith C.,"New Haven, CT",52,172,,4.0,2/16/2013,"This was my first outing to a Cheesecake Factory, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I figured since it was a chain, it would be so-so, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had one of the special chicken dishes, which must have looked pretty good since someone from another table asked us what I had ordered. I wish I could remember what it was now, but I really enjoyed it. Even though I was pretty full from dinner, I still ordered a dessert. Overall, filling and tasty. Worth the trip."
Kevin R.,"Clyde, NC",0,13,1,1.0,11/30/2014,I ordered the big burrito but it came with chicken only so they charged me $6 to change it to steak.  There was maybe 4-6 small pieces of steak in the rice filled giant burrito.  I voiced my displeasure with the waiter but he really didn't give a crap.  Worst $13.95 + $6 burrito I ever had.
Jaimey H.,"Durham, NC",104,163,27,3.0,1/26/2012,"I tried the skinnylicious turkey burger since I am on Weight Watchers, but the only complaint i have is that they don't provide the nutritional value of their so-called healthier menu.  If Cheesecake Factory is trying to make an effort to be more health conscious I think they should provide more options and list what is actually going in your body.  Overral the food was decent and the wait wasn't that bad.  Would I go there again? Sure, but I don't think it would be my first option."
Leomaris M.,"Hollywood, FL",167,55,56,3.0,12/17/2012,"After my last review of this particular store, I got a phone call from the GM to apologize for the inconvenience of my experience and I was told a gift certificate was there for me. My boyfriend came in from Miami to visit so we went shopping and stopped by to give it another chance. I introduced myself and a manager gave me 2 $25 gift certificate TO BE USE IN ANY CHEESECAKE FACTORY....(?)...I looked at my bf since we are both GM's from restaurants and we were in doubt of staying there or taking them back to Miami where service and food are always great. We decided to stay and give them another chance anyway. The server was very nice this time but she messed up my order one more time. I did not get sick but I will never return regardless of gift cards or invitations, they already prove me they are not in the CHEESECAKE FACTORY game."
Amy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,71,,4.0,3/25/2010,"My BFF took me to Cheesecake for a little early bday treat, and I left disgustingly happy and full. It had been awhile since I indulged in this dieter's nightmare of a restaurant. We ordered sangrias (white, which I had never heard of) which were served with fresh orange and apple slices. So refreshing! After devouring the bread basket, we got another one with just the wheat rolls. Drool. With so much delicious dipping to do, the bread comes in handy. I ordered a shrimp pasta dish (grilled instead of breaded). My friend got salmon with these dangerously fantastic smashed potatoes. I took half of my dish to go (yay!) because we then split a decedent apple crisp. I had to unbutton my jeans to let the belly roll hang out afterward.  Cheesecake Factory is great every once in awhile to indulge. Any more than that and I would be a contestant on ""The Biggest Loser""."
Luis A.,"Raleigh, NC",42,267,18,2.0,8/6/2012,It's a chain... A big chain with a HUGE menu. Can they even really cook all of that food fresh every day?
