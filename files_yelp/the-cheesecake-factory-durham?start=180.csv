Gaby V.,"Durham, NC",0,8,2,1.0,9/8/2015,"In all honesty if I could give this place a zero I would. I took my sister here for her birthday and it was a complete disaster. The food wasn't cooked properly the service was horrible. It took them 10 minutes just to get our drinks ordered, not to the table but to tell them what we would like to drink. We finally place our orders for then 15 min later be told that they are out of the appetizer to order something else. Our pasta entrees were not cooked completely, bland no flavor what so ever. The table next Us Barely ate anything and left most of their food behind. Our waitress barely came to our table had to wait a while to ask for our checks and wait another while just to pay, but another table next to us had a different waiter got their checks and paid   While we were waiting to pay. I asked for the manager, it took a while for him to come over to our table as well. After we explained how horrible everything was he though that giving us cheesecake would make everything thing okay. We paid and left only to meet my cousin outside who also brought her children for one of their birthdays. She explained how she as well experienced horrible service."
Zondra M.,"Durham, NC",196,11,2,4.0,2/20/2013,I love all of their food!  The dessert menu is awesome.  This isn't the best place to go have a drink at the bar with friends.  It's a bit pricey!
PT S.,"Chapel Hill, NC",46,19,5,2.0,1/19/2012,"Look, I know you feel cool leaving the restaurant with a cheesecake factory doggie bag, but there's a reason why four out of five people leave with those.  The menu is too damn big!  $20 for Alfredo?!  $3 for a coke?!  And what's with the lighting?  You want me to actually read the menu right?  No?  Oh, okay then, I'll take random dish."
W K.,"Cary, NC",0,5,2,2.0,1/10/2013,"We ate out yesterday at Cheesecake Factory. Like always the ambiance was good. Food choices were great. The Cheesecake and the crab-cakes are simply awesome, as always. The server would also get a 5 star. Problem from last night: The dinner plate I was served in was cracked! and the shrimps (Jamaican black pepper Shrimp ) were overcooked. I did not point it out at that time as I did not wanted to ruin everyone else experience last night but I am writing it here to get it out of my system."
Tom K.,"Durham, NC",401,91,1,4.0,3/13/2012,"It's hard to go wrong with any dessert selection here.  Some of the best cheesecake you can get.  Menu selections are good, too.  Bar is well stocked and the wine list is good."
Dan P.,"Durham, NC",1,7,,4.0,3/28/2012,"Was in a time crunch to get to movie but wanted something to eat before. Went for a quick appetizer here and really, I cannot describe how quick it was. The bartender was very helpful in expediting the situation and we had the first two apps in front of us in minutes. The third came soon after. Had the tuna tartar, fried artichoke hearts, and beet salad-all great.  I have to go back to the bartender--she was friendly, engaging, and actually seemed to care if we made the movie on time."
Jen W.,"La Crosse, VA",23,36,8,5.0,4/30/2014,"I LOVE this place. This restaurant usually has less wait time than the Crabtree location which is nice. The ambiance is always relaxing and inviting. Very elegant decor. We enjoy the complementary bread basket and the pumpernickel bread specifically. You must try the avocado eggrolls and order double tamarind sauce for dipping. It is amazing and we order this every time. I skip around the menu as it's so large and there are so many delicious choices. The pasta carbonara is my favorite pasta choice. It's huge! I have to say though, my all time favorite dish is the hibachi ribeye! It is beyond perfection! Medium rare, seasoned flank steak, covered in marinated and sauteed mushrooms, onions, sprouts and cilantro. Sweet Asian inspired sauce and mashed potatoes with wasabi butter on top. It is mouth-watering! This is one of my and my husband's favorite date spots. Kids are welcome but we opt not to bring ours. We normally don't have room for cheesecake but the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake is amazing. The chocolate torte (not sure that's what it's called... chocolate cake. Maybe?) is my favorite dessert here. It's thick, moist, creamy and huge! It's not fluffy cake, it's more like a torte. Delicious! I'm hungry now!"
Andrea W.,"Durham, NC",37,23,38,3.0,6/27/2012,"Cheesecake is always awesome. The food is alright, no need to go here for dinner. Just hit em up for dessert."
David M.,"Hillsborough, NC",0,43,,2.0,7/5/2014,"I am glad to see they now have a skinny menu.  But unfortunately, the South pointe location still has a lousy waitstaff.  Asked for lemon with the water, 3X's.  Bread took forever.  Our hamburgers came without Ketchup, asked for same, waitress again was invisable.  finally got up and asked another waitress.  The management needs to better supervise."
Alison B.,"Denver, CO",0,25,,4.0,10/17/2012,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints.  There is literally something for every taste on the menu and even more. As typical, there was a wait of 45 minutes.  But the wait staff was very attentive and the food came out pretty quickly!"
Laura N.,"Carrboro, NC",0,4,,5.0,7/1/2014,"Love it here- their cheesecakes and bread are amazing. The main dishes are also really good, especially their pastas, though the prices may be a deterrent ($13-19 per dish, $7-9 per cheesecake)."
Caroline S.,"Durham, NC",41,376,127,3.0,3/23/2011,"Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, I mean I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.  But on a recent visit I was really impressed by their service and surprisingly their food - had their BLT salad which for $9 was a big salad with great presentation and fresh ingredients.  The cheesecake I tried was also great, but that's to be expected!  I still think Cheesecake Factory is a great place to cater to various tastes (given their 15 page, ad laced menu), it's not the place for me, but a good option to please a picky group."
Mark A.,"Durham, NC",50,24,1,3.0,1/20/2012,"I went for brunch on Sunday of last week. The service was good and like always, the food tasted great, but like always, it made me feel awful until  Tuesday. I really only go here when I am with others that want to go there. In this area, I would choose elsewhere."
F. K.,"Durham, NC",0,19,1,3.0,7/4/2013,"I eat here every know and then, it's convenient, and the food is sometimes a hit and sometimes a miss. I've had more luck with the appetizers."
Patricia P.,"Raleigh, NC",7,6,,3.0,3/9/2012,"I'm not fond of cheesecake, and even for those who are, I think the servings are way too big.  But I did learn today that they have delicious milkshakes.  I just don't want to know how many calories are in it."
Ruo Z.,"Houston, TX",1,35,7,3.0,12/28/2011,"This was my first and only time eating at Cheesecake Factory, so I'm no authority on the quality of this particular restaurant, which may be better or worse than others of this chain. But I don't really get the hype. Maybe I didn't order the right thing (something off the Asian part of the menu...go figure), but I found the food to be just ooookaaaay. I was there with a group of friends, and every person's portions were HUGE. Oh, but do you know what IS good there? MAC AND CHEESE. I don't even like mac and cheese, but someone at the table ordered it, and a bunch of us stole bites of his. If there were such a thing as gourmet mac and cheese, this would be it. And their guac was good too. I don't know if I'd go back though...It's a bit pricey and a bit rich for my palate."
Chas F.,"Tampa, FL",22,268,41,5.0,11/9/2011,Just a regular old cheesecake factory! Who doesn't love this place!!
Kinjal P.,"Atlanta, GA",54,76,,4.0,7/14/2011,"The best part about this Cheesecake Factory is the location.  It's right near the mall and there is always a crowd in and out of the resto.  The food was standard Cheesecake Factory quality.  Only gripe I had was the slow service because of how busy it is.  But, I'd probably still go back since the location is so convenient to the mall."
Rhea C.,"Newton, MA",6,10,,3.0,5/29/2010,"I know it's a chain, but I usually get soooo excited to go to the Cheesecake Factory! I mean, who doesn't love the bread basket and the insane portions?? Although kind of a nightmare for dieters, I really enjoy their Chinese Chicken Salad and Barbecue Chicken Salad, and the lunch size portions are fairly reasonable, calorie-wise. I love dessert but cheesecake is actually NOT my favorite (gasp!) so if I'm going to splurge I order the strawberry shortcake, and it's amazing. A real, honest-to-goodness biscuit, ice cream, whipped cream, and of course, fresh strawberries. It really does remind me of the shortcake my mom used to make.  Despite my long-standing love, recent experiences at the Southpoint Cheesecake have led to some conflicting feelings. They seem to be cutting corners - like using mostly iceberg lettuce in the salads, and skimping on the strawberries in the strawberry shortcake - so wrong!And THEN I had a  terrible experience with a waiter there. I'm still a little shocked at his attitude. He was rude to us, right from the beginning, and really slow. My friend and I split a salad, and we had to ask three times for an extra plate. Then the process of getting the bill was a debaucle. He knew we were trying to get to a movie, and yet everything was so slow it was almost as if he was trying to make us late. We told him we were ready for the checks, and he went off, presumably to get on that . . .  but no - 10 minutes later, he wandered by and asked if we needed separate checks. Another 10 minutes went by, and when we asked for an update, he informed us, in a clearly annoyed tone, that separate checks took a long time, and we were just going to have to wait. Um, I'm not really looking to be scolded by a 23 year-old waiter on my girls night out! I'd have to say I'm still a fan of the Cheesecake fare, but I'll probably think twice about the Southpoint branch, especially since there are so many options in the area. I would say, if you've got a severe Cheesecake craving, go for it, but otherwise, spare yourself the 45-minute wait!"
Kevin D.,"Raleigh, NC",4,14,,3.0,8/23/2012,"I feel like the Cheesecake factory neither garners high praise, nor elicits any hyper negative comments. You get what you pay for, it's always solid. If you want to spend a little more for a chain restaurant experience, than this is a good place to go. The recipes are always solid, they may not be super high quality, but they are always well prepared. Also, you can never go wrong with their wide selection of cheesecake, I mean, they ARE the cheesecake FACTORY."
