Jocelyn Y.,"Chico, CA",183,148,1032,3.0,9/30/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory was the most disappointing one I've been to. It seemed very unorganized and slow. There was a line of people at the front asking how much longer their wait would be while I waited in line just to put my name on the list.  It took forever for our waitress to come by and we didn't start eating until more than an hour after we were seated. In the mean time, in between time, we asked for bread three times because we were starving. The food was good tho. I got one of those combinations that came w the steak and herb crusted salmon. Portions were super small compared w the action dishes so I probably wouldn't get a combo ever again but I suppose it was nice to try two things. It was REALLLYYY dim in this restaurant. Like I could barely see my menu or what I was eating. SO who knows if my steak was cooked how I wanted it and who knows what I was actually eating. While waiting for our food I had a nice little view of the kitchen where food sat forever before people would bring it out to the tables. Probs wouldn't come back to this location but I do crave the food at Cheesecake Factory from time to time."
Ashleigh B.,"Hubert, NC",0,10,2,1.0,1/28/2017,"I'm sure the food would have been great if the hostess staff would have correctly quoted the wait time. Quoted 55-70 min... added another 15 min to to the 70... then said it would be another 5-10 before we were sat after that extra 15. I understand being busy, but over shoot the wait time so we are happy when we are sat earlier, not angry that we wasted over an hour and half waiting for a table we didn't sit at. Then to top it off, I go into to talk to the hostess and she barely looked at me and was focusing on the screen. Worst experience ever and I didn't get past the hostess stand! Good luck getting us back to this one. I'll gladly drive to Crabtree for a better experience!"
Chevon C.,"Thomasville, NC",19,71,138,5.0,3/21/2016,"Why have I not been here before.  I had always heard that this place was good but wow it was really good.  We do not live in the area and was dropping a friend off at RDU for a return flight. Discussing dinner on the way back my husband suggested we head here since he had been and I had not. So glad we decided to go.  Started with the crispy crab wontons. The dipping sauce was light and tangy which paired great with the crispy fried crab wontons.  They had great crab flavor.  I got the chicken and biscuits which is the most comforting dish. It was like the insides of the best chicken pot pie ever with the best buttermilk biscuit ever on top. Out of the world decadent comfort food and MASHED POTATOES. Carb heaven.  My husband had a pesto pasta. I don't recall the name but it was a crispy chicken with prosciutto and an arugula salad on top. Simply Devine.  Of course we saved room for cheese cake.  We actually got our own piece!  We always just share dessert but not today! I had the lemon raspberry. It was so refreshing, tart, and creamy.  Hubby had the salted caramel-OMG good.  Going back soon. Worth the 1 1/2 hour drive."
Branden R.,"Morrisville, NC",0,8,,3.0,9/4/2017,"Feeling disappointed that they changed the Crispy Cuban Roll sauce, the new sauce is not good and doesn't compliment the Cuban spices and taste.  Bring back the mustard/pickle sauce..."
Michael B.,"Raleigh, NC",30,11,3,4.0,4/23/2017,Really great food and service. A bit of a wait to be seated. And careful they lock the mall at 9PM. So you can't walk back through to get to your car. Great signature cocktails.
Jerry M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,10,1,3.0,4/22/2017,Pretty solid food and great cheese cake of course. Biggest drawback is cost for the food quality.  Little pricey for what it is except for a few dishes. The menu has too many options.
Eddy A.,"Carrboro, NC",1,11,64,5.0,5/4/2017,"I went to Cheesecake Factory on two separate occasions recently. Once was for dinner and we were waited on by Ashley. The restaurant was super busy so I went in expecting the service to be on the slower side but my expectations were totally exceeded! Ashley was fast, kept our drinks refilled, was attentive but not overbearing and was very personable and sweet. She did not once appear flustered or in a hurry due to how very busy the place was. We were so impressed that a few days later we went in for Sunday brunch. We requested her section but she was not there and instead we got a different Ashley. This Ashley was JUST as amazing of a waitress. She was prompt, sweet, funny, and attentive and very quick. The next time you go to Cheesecake Factory ask for ashley, either one of them will not disappoint! 100% recommend"
Jen L.,"Durham, NC",119,2,2,5.0,3/30/2017,"The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp Entree is delicious. One of the closest authentic Caribbean Jerk recipes I've tasted in a while. It comes with steamed rice ( white or brown), plantains, pineapple and beans. We had a great server who was very helpful with choosing a selection. We sat outside and she assisted with wiping down our area that was full of pollen. Great Service! I also had a Pineapple Moscow Mule which is my favorite cocktail when I'm there the Cheesecake Factory. They did discontinue the Khalua Cheesecake which broke my heart so I'll have to find another favorite."
Krystle H.,"Durham, NC",14,33,60,5.0,2/20/2017,"We were greeted well and seated quickly. We ordered the Macaroni and Cheese burger from the menu and the Truffle Honey Fried Chicken from the limited time menu. He gave me a bite of the fried mac and cheese that tops the beef in the burger and it was delicious. My chicken was delicious. If you've never tried honey chicken I recommend this, especially if you have a sweet tooth. I would say each meal is pretty filling so come with an empty stomach and be prepared to maybe take some home. These are leftovers you'll be craving later. My boyfriend also ordered a mango frozen drink which was yummy as well. Our server was very nice to us and provided excellent service. The ambiance is comfortable and enjoyable. The venue is clean and smells like food that makes your mouth water and let's not forget the cheesecakes! I had the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and recommend it as well.  Overall the experience was very pleasant and it's perfect to go with that special someone who likes to try new foods."
Cameron G.,"Durham, NC",4,2,,4.0,7/24/2017,"Always love the Cheesecake Factory.  Huge selection, very kind and helpful servers, delicious food.  Can't go wrong."
Yvonne C.,"Nashville, TN",203,229,86,3.0,9/2/2015,"As far as chain restaurants go, this probably fills the bill for your average one. This Cheesecake Factory is huge, seats a lot of people, has outdoor seating, and yet is crazily packed during peak times (weekends, holidays).  I eat here out of convenience whenever I'm shopping at Southpoint, waiting for a movie, or if friends want to eat here and it's never been disappointing, but nothing awe-striking. Like all CFs, the menu is EXPANSIVE!! You could go for days in that menu, and if you're indecisive like me, then oh boy, buckle up. There is literally something for everyone.  The bread that comes out before your meal is actually really good! I tend to fill up on the bread by accident here, ha!  I usually go for the bowtie pasta with the chicken (don't remember the actual name), because I know it's good and it's cheap. It's a very heavy dish because it's drenched in a creamy sauce. The portions are huge! I usually split a dish with my BF. If you have room for dessert, then please do get a slice of cheesecake. And one slice is perfect for 2! All the ones I've ever tried are so delicious and dense.  The service here is alright, it can get a bit slow and we've had a forgetful waitress in the past. We ordered a beer and it never came out, which the waitress repeatedly apologized for. If you're just curious about the cheesecake or having a craving, you can order slices at the counter by the entrance. Each one is about $7.95, so it's not cheap but it's definitely tasty."
Kandi F.,"La Vergne, TN",0,7,5,3.0,9/4/2016,"Came here on a Sunday evening around 6pm. Husband and I sat on the patio and it took forever for the waitress to take our order. We had to flag her down after sitting there for about 15 minutes. The waitress was a tall blond older lady that was somewhat pleasant though not overly nice as if she were distracted. Since we had so much time to go over the menu we went ahead and ordered our drinks, appetizers and entrees at the same time fearing we wouldn't be able to track her down again. Drinks came pretty quickly but the bread took another 15 minutes and then the appetizer of the sampler egg roll plate came about 10 minutes after that. After another 20 minutes our entrees came. Husband ordered parmesan herb crusted chicken and I ordered the combination plate of chicken madeira and steak diane. The egg roll sampler was great with 4 different types with sauces. The parmesean chicken was hot and flavorful and huge. My combo plate had a good taste but was only lukewarm. I didn't send it back for fear it would be another hundred years to get it back. Overall a decent meal if you don't mind waiting forever. Would like to give it another shot when it's not so busy to get some decent service."
Charles W.,"Vancouver, Canada",41,16,3,3.0,5/15/2016,"[6:40] seated  [7:15] Need more staff ASAP. It is a Sunday night and I know it is busy but Jesus it took us 45 minutes to get the bread and another 5 minutes on top of that to get a set of cutlery and plates for my girlfriend. For the Cheesecake Factory this wait time is unacceptable. Future patrons COME ON A WEEKDAY. Let's hope the food is good [7:27] Food has finally arrived. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - it's decent. The flavor is very evenly balanced and it is not very spicy for something that on the menu reads ""very spicy"". Love the blend of sauces and it keeps my mouth hot. Falafel salad is quite good - loving the falafel balls especially. Food is in a large quantity. But is it worth the wait?  [7:40] our waitress switched out our lemonade for strawberry lemonade free of charge. Nice of her to do! [7:53] got our cheesecake. 6/10"
Scott W.,"Ashland, KY",0,88,92,4.0,2/26/2017,"Really good service. I ordered their Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, which I've done on several occasions, but I don't know why. Just isn't that great. And very pricey ... almost $20. Definitely not worth it. But the cheesecake ... 5 stars!"
Crystal H.,"Raleigh, NC",49,27,21,4.0,3/27/2016,"Everyone knows that The Cheesecake Factory is awesome...it's a well known fact. The menu offers a wide array of choices and the cheesecakes are to-die-for.  I like this particular location at The Streets of Southpoint because of its convenience to shopping and other entertainment.  The movie theater, right around the corner, makes this an ideal date night spot. The only negative I will offer about this visit is the service received  from my server, who was attentive enough, but didn't offer a single smile the whole evening. Even still, I prefer this location to the ever crowded Crabtree location."
Marjorie J.,"Burlington, NC",22,3,,1.0,10/14/2016,Took my son here for his bday dinner and had to wait 1hr and 15mins for our food....f***ing ridiculous....won't be coming back to this location hopefully the one opening in Greensboro will have better service....the manager on shift was a moron....I guess u don't have to have common sense to be a manager for a restaurant....SMH
Michael B.,"Cary, NC",0,7,5,5.0,7/26/2016,Great Food!  Friendly staff. Great service! The avacado egg rolls are the bomb!  The mojitos are fantastic! And the cheesecake is terrific!  What more do you want??
Rita H.,"Thomasville, NC",94,19,158,5.0,4/16/2015,"Pam-seared salmon with tomato, green beans, artichoke hearts, & almonds on couscous with pesto sauce. Incredible! ""Michelle"" provided excellent service!"
S S.,"Kitty Hawk, NC",1,115,28,1.0,3/6/2016,Tried to take my wife out to dinner since we are always on the go and felt like spoiling ourself a. Well that was a mistake.  We were seated in less time then the hostess said which was a positive for sure since they were busy. But it went downhill from there.  After being seated it seemed like it took over 10 minutes for our server Kenneth to come acknowledge us. At that time we placed our drink order and an appetizer order to help move things along and prevent longer delays. After Kenneth returned with out drinks he took our order.  A while later a food server dropped our appetizer off for us to enjoy which actually was good. We had the fried mozzarella. Then we never saw our server for a very long time. Our drinks needed refills and we had been finished with our appetizer for quite some time and started wondering where our food was. After another 20 minutes we noticed a table that was sat after us received their meal. Since our server was not attentive to our table we couldn't inquire what the holdup was.   Finally after almost 30 minutes a good runner came to deliver meals to the table to our right which they had been finished and we're waiting on the same server to bring them their bill. I heard the order and said I ordered that and she said no it's for this table. They advised her she was wrong they were waiting on their bill and she proceeded to drop the order on our table when they got my wife's order wrong. So she picked up the order and said she would recheck where this was going but asked what my wife ordered.  Finally Kenneth showed up to the table finished eating and we inquired about our order and explained the mess up. He was like oh let me check on it. I also asked at that time for refills and Said the people to our left already received their meals and said not sure what's up. Then it fell apart from there.  Kenneth started to make smart remarks to me and I said you can bring the manager over and one was walking by and he called the gentleman over. I advised him that Kenneth hasn't been doing his job and attentive to his tables. The manager said this was the first he heard of this and would check on our order. Kenneth came back to refill our drinks and said you must be thirsty and he was here to refill our drinks since he hasn't been doing anything tonight. I said you can find us another service and to watch his smart remarks I was out to enjoy a dinner not have poor service.  Needless to say our night was ruined by poor customer no service at this location. My wife enjoyed her meal I can't say the same. The manager never came back to apologize or offer anything to us. We paid our bill and will NEVER eat here again.
Quinn N.,"Greenville, NC",4,26,3,3.0,9/4/2015,"As a disclaimer:  I'd like to say I'm not a snobby eater but chain restaurant like these really never makes me leave happy...I think the last time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was a couple of years ago. Someone said their menu changed a bit so I went. Overwhelming amount of choices on the menu is a decoy. Chicken takes up 75% of their menu..anyways overall, pretty okay.  Pasta is a safe choice while steak was not the best idea.  Their cheese cake is goooood. We had the chocolate s'mores. Yum yum"
