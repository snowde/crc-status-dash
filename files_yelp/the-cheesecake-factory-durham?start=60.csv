Janis H.,"Jefferson, NC",0,18,,2.0,6/24/2017,"My husband and I stopped by the Cheesecake Factory in Durham on Saturday, June 24 at 2:00 pm to purchase two slices of cheesecake at the front counter. After getting our order, we asked an employee if we could sit at a table to eat it. Even though there was no one waiting in line to eat and there were empty tables available, we were denied access. The female who denied us a place to sit said that we could not eat at a table because we purchased the cheesecake ourselves rather than having a waiter/waitress bring it to us. If my husband and I had known we would have received such poor service, we definitely would not have stopped at this restaurant. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the overpriced cheesecake was good."
Jordan P.,"Carrboro, NC",1,61,1,1.0,1/26/2016,"I tried to eat here a few days ago on a Sunday and never made it to a table because the line was so long. The hostess quoted ""5-10 minutes"" but after waiting 25 we gave up. They blamed it on the fact that they only had two bussers for the tables...well guess what? Somebody (a manager, server, one of the useless hosts standing around) needs to go bus tables if you want to keep your patrons. But honestly, we all knew that was a lie, right? Next time be upfront about the true wait time so people can make an educated choice (not that I'll be coming back)."
Jenn B.,"Durham, NC",4,40,1,2.0,3/11/2017,"So disappointing. I've been to several other locations of this restaurant and I always appreciate the consistency, flavor, service, and portion sizes (too big actually but that's kind of the point). Unfortunately, my family's experience at the Durham restaurant the other night was really disappointing. My mother and I both ordered salads and hers was TINY and barely had any meat in it. Mine was missing corn, black beans, and DRESSING. We had to stalk down the waitress to tell her what was happening and then she asked if she should just bring me a side of black beans. Um, no? I sent it back, which is unusual for me, and the salad I got back was much larger and much more delicious, leading me to think that the particular chef who made our salads the first time just sucked. Won't be returning."
Tiffany L.,"Peachtree Corners, GA",34,102,38,4.0,12/17/2015,"Do you love huge portions?  Have no idea what you want to eat? Have a large group? Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place for you.  The menu ridiculously huge.  It always takes my husband forever to order because he always changes his mind at least 5 times before making a final decision.  I generally stick with the pasta dishes (garlic noodles, 4 cheese penne, or carbonara), which are consistently good.  I wouldn't say they do anything particularly well, but everything is acceptable.  I do like their avocado egg roll appetizer.  Service is good here. The atmosphere is just like every other cheesecake factory you go to, which is kind of comforting."
Crystal R.,"Denver, CO",112,273,773,3.0,5/8/2014,"I've been here for both lunch and dinner and each experience was okay. The service has been hit or miss at times and the food is good overall.  There is definitely a lot of hype over this place which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars. They have a pretty large menu, but too much is really too much. As an indecisive person, it already takes me awhile to decide what I want and the pages of menu items is a bit overwhelming. Their drinks aren't that great considering the cost, definitely not returning for their drinks. I did, however, enjoy their skinny menu--not necessarily because I'm watching my weight but because they're smaller portions of food which is nice and leaves room for their cheesecake! Definitely save room for the cheesecake! I'm not really a fan of cheesecake to begin with but they have different flavors which helps to please all different taste buds. Overall, I'd go here again if I was shopping in the area, but it's not really a destination restaurant for me. In my opinion, there are better restaurants in the area."
Amy F.,"Durham, NC",4,103,42,1.0,9/16/2016,"I just had the worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory in my entire life. We were stuck there for literally an hour and a half, for no freakin reason. Our server (Bonnie?) was so bad that we had 2-3 sets of different people get seated around us, served, and checked out (after we placed our order) while we were still waiting for our food! We were a table of two people! I had to go find the GM because they were actually going to charge us for our order... which was incorrectly made, TWICE. I guess it's really hard to make medium steaks? Terrible."
Shadi H.,"Raleigh, NC",95,56,231,3.0,1/22/2016,Their food is just okay and overpriced if you ask me for some categories like pasta. And their cheese cake too rich and sweet not that great for a place called cheese cake factory.
C P.,"Durham, NC",0,161,7,4.0,5/7/2017,"Great as always.  Expensive, but you know you won't be disappointed with the quality.  Just make aure you leave room for dessert....i forgot."
Ted E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,137,121,5.0,6/6/2015,"The menu is huge, and it's hard to believe, but all the selections are great. We love the bar. The bartender are friendly and responsive. Same menu, even better service. We prefer the ""Skinny"" menu for the food and drinks. The Skinny Mojito is the bomb, Asian lettuce wrap tacos and the Ahi Carpaccio."
Logan G.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,93,14,5.0,9/2/2016,"With the service and food being great as ever, this location is another beginner in the Cheesecake Factory chain."
Michael G.,"Seattle, WA",7,285,,1.0,12/9/2016,"Typically consistency would be one of the primary expectations I would have for any Cheesecake branch within the large national chain.  Well, this branch has ruined that expectation.  Two visits ago, my wife and I both came down with stomach trouble the early evening after eating lunch at this restaurant.  I suspected a linkage because we always shared our dishes at this restaurant. Then, on our last visit, one of the meals served from the kitchen was absolutely hideous in terms of really poor meat quality that was way oversized and not cut anywhere close to the usual standard size for the dish.  It was extremely gristly and unusually overloaded with large chunks of fat.  We both were lucky that we did not choke on the gross meat that we ultimately had to spit out onto the plate.   It was totally inexcusable, disgusting, and it has completely destroyed my trust in the kitchen there, to serve something so obviously bad like that to customers. I have never seen such large variation in quality at a cheesecake factory branch before.  I am very sad that I will have to stay away from a chain I have liked for many years due to the very poor kitchen performance and substandard quality at this branch.  The disappointment in the poor food quality was actually so big that we could not even accept any offers to try to fix it.  When a restaurant messes up so bad, I just do not want to even give them another chance.  I care too much about my health and well being.  I also share the disappointment in the management of this branch like other customers, as they did not seem to adequately listen to me or meet my expectations in handling the very unfortunate quality issues."
Jesse Y.,"Durham, NC",123,1,,5.0,10/26/2016,"Been coming to this location for years, and it's by far the best place to eat at Southpoint! The Manager Norm, is the one of the most professional managers I have ever met!"
Ahmad H.,"Durham, NC",26,36,9,5.0,5/18/2016,I have been here a few times and I can say their food is very good although the menu is huge and I only tried a few dishes . The service is very good overall. Expect to wait on Sat nights. Try Chicken Madeira!
Ebony G.,"Durham, NC",47,6,,1.0,10/1/2016,"Went here today. From the time we were seated until the time we ledt without receiving our food was 1 hr and 13 min. Our server Bonnie helped the other tables she had a lot faster than our table. I always say everyone has their day but this was ridiculous. My 7 yr old had to wait 16 min for a kids apple juice. The only time ahe cane back was when ee were fed up and decided to leave. We ordered 2 waters 1 Arnold Palmer and one kiss apple juice. My husband left a $7 dollar tip, he is kind like that. The manager and the server appeared not to care to much that we didn't get pur food. So we left with our 2 hungry children. I still can't believe this happend. My children were excited, because this is one of their favorite restaurants. The couple sitting next to us received their food and finished it and we still did not get our food. Oh and we were seated 7 min before them.    The couple apologized for us not being served. It wasn't their fault and they seem to care more than the manager and server. We will not be going back to this location."
Jillery Ellen S.,"Durham, NC",21,365,125,5.0,10/13/2015,Asian chicken salad with coolio noodles...  Always dressed perfectly.... HeavenlyHeavenly. Service super. Anything I've ever ordered has been very good but the Asian chix salad my fav!!
Kristin D.,"Fayetteville, NC",3,39,4,5.0,2/8/2016,Although the location is overcrowded with people the order was quick and fresh! I only wished we had a location near Fort Bragg. Love the Truffle Tower and Godiva  Cheesecake! You can't go wrong either with the Original Cheesecake.
Ronald A.,"Clayton, NC",0,1,,1.0,9/18/2016,Worst service I've ever had at a cheesecake.  Took 20 min to get someone to take drink order and be greeted. App came out before the drinks. Only bread available was white.  Asked about wheat and was told it will be out later.  Got it as we finished. Too peoples orders was missing fries and had to ask after they finished on the fries.  Came out and we're not too hot.   I didn't get a steak knife for my pork chip.  Used my normal knive to eat. Asked repeataly for manager.  Waiter poorly apologized about service and said we did  not have to give him a tip. Manager finally came after running to find him.  He got someone else too help us. Waiting to order cheesecake now. Worst time ever.
Dennis D.,"Williamsburg, VA",1,21,1,1.0,8/20/2016,"Worse service of my life.  Here I am more than 2 hours into dinner, if you can call it that, and my waiter has not given me a dessert menu. I can't imagine if they were actually busy.  I can't even discuss the rest of the dinner.  Abysmal!!!!"
Lyn M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",116,109,128,4.0,7/25/2014,"As most others have pointed out, their menu is extensive! We came here in all honesty after intending to go to California Pizza Kitchen and not finding it, then being bombarded with a random quick heavy downpour.  Don't get me wrong, their food is good, and I was glad to find their skinnylicious menu, only because I know their normal plates REALLY pack the calories if you're not careful. We had a 15 minute wait initially, which we spent browsing next door at lululemon. Once seated, our server for the rest of the evening, Ashley, was incredible. So courteous, attentive, friendly, smiled, interactive, and cracking jokes. She was always on top of refilling our drinks - we never saw the bottom! I had the Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos, the husband had their skinnylicious chicken pasta. The lettuce wraps were delicious. I preferred the sweet and spicy sauce over their peanut ginger one. Good crunch from the veggies, the lettuce wrap didn't fall apart, and the grilled chicken was flavorful. The husband said his chicken pasta wasn't anything special, but he said it at least had the tang he was looking for. The house brown bread is amazing. If I wasn't watching calories, I easily could've had two loafs by myself! It's got a sweet hint in it that just makes your mouth water. Good ambiance, a little loud, but nothing we couldn't handle - they were busy and honestly having an infant in tow, it masked her cries for toys."
Amber R.,"Waynesville, NC",114,4,2,2.0,8/15/2016,"Food is always great and consistent.  I wish I could say the same for service.  We opted out for the patio tonight and our server took 10 minutes to greet us.  She was an older tall blonde waitress who seemed confused and out of her element so we tried to be patient with her.  We orders our drinks from a colleague of hers, and our food from her. Drinks came out quickly, meanwhile our avo egg rolls we ordered as an app never came.  20 minuets after we order our drink she came back to the table and asked us if she took our order and what we had ordered.  At that point we knew she forgot about us.  Our drinks were finished at the time and she never offered us to order another pina colada.  Another 20 minutes go by and she asked us what our app was again and if it had come out.  10 minutes later our food came, no appetizer.  10 minutes into the meal she finally came around and asked if our food was ok and I mentioned to her our app never came.  She apologized and blamed it on the back of the house.  Asked me if I still wanted it and made us seem like it was an issue to take it off.  (WTH) at this point I wanted to speak to the manager but none were in sight.  We ask for the check and she says.  Just want to let you know I took your Mac and cheese balls off... I never ordered those. I ordered avo rolls.  Seriously terrible.  Next time I'll order take out. Update: I would have spoken to a manager if I could have found one.  Secondly I had my impatient and tired 4 year old with me and was unable to wait for another 30 minutes to speak with said manager.  I worked at a CCF in college so I know how my experience should have gone and I was appalled that ticket times were unmanaged and lack of responsibility taken from the waitress.  She should have notified her manager that she made the mistake and asked for a rush. Then had her manager come speak to us and assure us our meal was priority.  She would have saved her tip and kept me from Yelping."
