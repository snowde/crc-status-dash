Janiesse B.,"Harrisburg, NC",79,6,4,5.0,5/5/2016,"I love this restaurant. I'm pleased every time I go. My favorites are the brown bread, the meatloaf, the Mac n cheese, the shrimp, the salmon and the mash potatoes. Not to mention all the cheesecakes lol, especially the Lemon Raspberry!"
Stephanie S.,"Durham, NC",4,10,,4.0,9/19/2016,"Very pleasant experience in the Durham location.  This location is extremely busy and yet they provide excellent and timely service.  The food is very good considering it is a chain restaurant.  They provide a great ""healthy option"" menu.  Great location - walk across the the ""Streets"" and take in a movie!"
Radhika S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,,1.0,2/25/2017,"In the past, I have gone to this Cheesecake Factory and it has been really good. However, the last time I went was two years ago in December and the appetizers, cheesecake and some of the entrees tasted excellent however there was a problem. The problem was I had ordered a chicken and pasta dish (I can't recall the name) and the next day I woke up at 3 am and I was throwing up. I vomited constantly and I did not get any sleep that night. THE WORST PART WAS THIS WAS ON THE DAY OF MY BIRTHDAY! No one wants to spend their birthday with severe food poisoning.  I believe something had gone rank with the chicken and I called the restaurant and they did not even apologize. The lady just said, ""thanks for letting us know"" then she hung up. How rude? I have been to other Cheesecake Factory chains and I have had better.  I am never going to this Cheesecake Factory chain again."
Brenda C.,"Wilmington, DE",138,267,1963,4.0,10/20/2014,"I suggest the cheesecake as your appetizer to make sure you have room for it. Maybe even have a couple of slices and just skip the rest of the meal. The Red velvet cheesecake is heavenly! I've tried a couple of other and they were all good, but red velvet is by far my favorite. As far as food goes, this is the kind of places that has so many options, but yet nothing is particularly appealing to me. The menu is a pretty thick book, I've been here a couple of times the only thing things are favorably memorable are the Chicken Madeira and the Gumbo (I enjoyed, though it wasn't like authentic gumbo). I once had this Asian salad that came with a very greasy wonton and was drenched in dressing, would've been better off eating a burger. Aside from that, the food is okay overall, not great, but not bad either. They bring you warm bread with butter when you sit so, I always look forward to that brown bread. It's a nice place to visit with a group since they have something for everyone on their menu and it's right by the movie theater. That being said, you can expect at least an hour wait on  Friday or Saturday night."
Terry H.,"Euless, TX",43,437,221,4.0,10/15/2015,"Very good salads today.  Jon our server was very good and professional. Thanks Jon.  We were seated very quickly during a busy time because they have tables for two, and that fits us.  Drinks were tasty and quick."
Grace H.,"Fayetteville, NC",367,29,19,3.0,7/24/2015,"Environment: If anything, I come here for the interior and service. The restaurant is huge and somehow always has a minimum of a 30 minute wait on the weekends (during dinner time). There were flies in the restaurant which was distasteful.  Food: Best thing is the bread that comes out for a starter. The last few times that we've been here the food has been a miss. My go-to is the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combination and the first time I'd had it, my mouth was watering for more. Recently, it just hasn't hit the spot. My family reacted in the same manner to their dishes (Tuscan Chicken and Fish Tacos). The Tuscan Chicken was dry and not marinated well, although the balsamic vinaigrette sauce is well-made. The fish tacos were not impressive at all, I'd recommend you don't order it at all. Hardly any fish, you're paying for lettuce and tasteless mini tortillas.  Service: Service is attentive but nothing spectacular. For the price I'm paying for these entrees, I expect a more professional and engaging service. Our table was missing silverware and small plates that all the tables should already have ready.  Overall, I honestly won't come again. I can get better service and food over at other places for a cheaper price. The only time I'll be coming here would be for their cheesecake but only if I'm actually willing to pay $7.95 for a single slice."
Emily L.,"Thomasville, NC",0,11,4,5.0,7/11/2016,"I thought it was super expensive at first, but then when I actually tasted the food, I paid their prices happily. Service was great too. I will note that the restaurant is very loud, but that's not easy to control. I loved this place."
Tori H.,"Charlotte, NC",502,523,290,4.0,7/26/2012,"You know, I know it's a chain, but I like it. I always get the same thing, and it's ALWAYS delicious! The service has always been decent to outstanding. We took my brother last night for his 18th birthday. Our server, Ebony, was fantastic. Always refilling our drinks promptly and she was very friendly (but not in a fake-waitress kind of way).  I got the chicken madeira and the cheesy goodness and the sauce with mushrooms...aaaah so good. The garlic red skin mashed potatoes were great too. So tasty. I can't imagine how much salt is on their food..........but whatev's.  We all got cheesecake and they sang happy birthday to my brother and they draw ""happy birthday"" in syrup on the plate. Nice touch. I always like places that take any extra step for someones birthday- especially when you are paying $$. The only thing that sucks is really the drink prices. I always want to get a few yummy cocktails- but that would be like a meal in itself for the cost. Not worth it. I can make a MUCH better authentic pina colada at home (and stronger ;) ) for a fraction of the $8-$10 you spend on one there."
Adam S.,"Charlotte, NC",15,361,3,3.0,8/31/2015,"I find this Cheesecake Factory to be consistently worse than the one in Charlotte. Our most recent experience was on a Friday night, so naturally Southpoint was a total nightmare with people all over the place. The wait for Cheesecake was 40 minutes, and it took that long, maybe a little less. Once we were seated, our waitress came and took drink orders. I got up to go to the restroom and almost fell down because the floor was so slippery (not in the bathroom--in the restaurant itself!). Understand that I'm pretty in shape and don't usually fall, but I found myself walking very cautiously to avoid a fall. Not cool. Anyway, we got our bread after asking a few waiters, and our appetizers shortly thereafter. The ahi tuna was phenomenal, and the guacamole was good as well. I will say, though, that the heat was not spread in the guac evenly, so one bite was hot and the next wasn't. My meal was the SkinnyLicious steak with some veggies. It was pretty darn good. Not too much food, which was perfect for what I was expecting. I'd get it again. Service was really slow but very kind. Our waitress was so sweet but a little forgetful. The people at the cheesecake counter were great. I got the new Salted Caramel Cheesecake which was pretty good (I think red velvet is still better...). I'd probably still come back to this Cheesecake just because it's an easy thing to get, but it's really below the standard that should be set."
Pam G.,"Winston-Salem, NC",1,22,1,1.0,7/21/2015,Sorry I love the Cheesecake Factory but not this one!!! It is in such a lovely mall to bad it is not living up to it's standards! Service slack and our food inedible !!!! Someone needs to clean that place up and replace some chefs and staff! What a shame!!! Will not be back I this location !!!
Carrie L.,"Raleigh, NC",0,65,9,3.0,5/8/2016,"This place is so overrated. I don't understand why people eat anything other than cheesecake here. I got the roasted vegetable salad, which had about 5 vegetables on a massive bed of iceberg lettuce. It's not worth the price - eat cheesecake here and have a better meal elsewhere, with better service too."
Yeshanth J.,"Cary, NC",30,231,155,4.0,3/30/2015,"Cheesecakes and milkshakes are awesome. For those who like some alcohol in their cheesecakes, I would recommend the Kalhua Coffee Cheesecake. They serve the best Stuffed Mushrooms. I also like their Fresh Basil,tomato,cheese flatbread. Their dynamite shrimp is a meme attempt at PF Chang's Dynamite shrimp. Chocolate milkshake is just awesome ! Once you are done, drop an do 50 push ups and squats to not feel guilty :) I find this location better than the one in Crabtree valley mall. Better service and waiters with agreeable demeanor. Bottomline: Choose this versus the one in Raleigh !"
Lara T.,"Winston-Salem, NC",54,39,1,4.0,2/20/2016,"Cheesecake factory is expensive, but the portions are large and the quality is high. Service tends to be very good, but there's almost always a long wait. I've eaten here a couple times and a few other times swung in to grab cheesecake to go. So delicious! Anyway, the atmosphere is great, it's a very comfortable, high-end experience. Wish I could eat here more. :)"
Jamie R.,"White Post, VA",0,5,6,2.0,3/21/2015,Horrible. I would never go here again the person who got our take out of cheesecake stuck the white chocolate raspberry on something and left fingerprints in it. And then the strawberries for the shortcake had weird things mixed in and they were really overly ripe. All in all our service was horrible. The only thing that was good was the Oreo cheesecake.
Jennifer H.,"Durham, NC",72,164,92,3.0,1/17/2016,"Hhhmmm so to be fair, I was not excited about going here for dinner, but I was out numbered and their menu is huge so I feel like something would be totally wrong if any human being wasn't able to find something to eat on their menu. Personally, I don't understand the draw to this place, but boy was it busy. I was the first to arrive for my party, checked in w the hostess and was told there would be a 30 minute wait-ok-not bad for 6pm on a Friday-but it was jam packed, people and servers everywhere. Standing room was very limited. After two minutes my buzzer went off and I was totally confused. Once at the hostess stand I said there must be a mistake I just got here and was told there was a 30 min wait and it's going off. I was told that an opening became available-um ok...texted my friend that was driving around looking for parking that I was already seated. I tell you all of this bc my initial thought was, y'all are unorganized! Once seated, our server was prompt and attentive, but not gonna lie, became annoying very quickly. It may be a good think that I forgot her name. From the second I sat down I felt like we were being rushed right out the door-not a feeling I like to have when I'm hoping for some r and r with a friend over a good meal. I find the menu to be a bit overwhelming. I ordered eggplant parm which came w a side of pasta w pesto. It was like Christmas in a plate because of the red and green contrast. The food was alright. Our servers constant checking in was beyond annoying-wishing that I could recall her name because I wasn't impressed with her. Our banana something or other cheesecake that my friend and I shared-wow!! In the future I'll be stopping by for the cheesecake only as the food and the service were just ok."
Adam W.,"Durham, NC",40,6,,5.0,1/21/2016,Everybody drops the ball once in a while. Tonight they actually did twice. I ordered the filet medium rare and I will pretty much never send a steak back. I actually had to do so twice tonight. The manager and our waitress were more than awesome about it and totally took care of us. It's not always easy to take my lovely wife out with our one and three year olds but they were exceptionally accommodating and more than made up for the trainee in the kitchen. We had a great time thanks to the fantastic staff who were clearly glad to have the whole family there.
Jenny R.,"Durham, NC",0,11,4,4.0,4/27/2016,"This place is great. Me and all my co-workers love to go here to celebrate birthdays. Their menu is slightly too large and overwhelming, but at least there is something for everyone. Something you may not know, is that their Caramel Macchiato is absolutely amazing. One of the best I've had. You usually don't expect that from sit down restaurants. Oh, and obviously their cheesecake is the bomb too."
Tresa W.,"Raleigh, NC",50,276,112,4.0,2/14/2015,"Better experience this time then in the past, food came out fast and hot. Better than expected and on valentines day. They were so busy. Don't like the advertisements for local dentists in the middle of the menu, too weird. And no prices on the beer menu. $4.50 for Coors light. Other than that , everything was awesome. Fast,friendly service."
Shauna G.,"Henderson, NC",4,80,3,4.0,3/25/2015,"Very tasty dinner made up only of appetizers. Also, their sangria was pretty delicious - they soak their fruit in alcohol separately!"
David L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",292,80,,4.0,9/4/2014,"It seems cheesecake is cheesecake wherever you are in the U.S. They have the same super-long menu and the same extensive cheesecake and drink menus. If you're indecisive, you will find yourself completely overwhelmed by the choice you have to make. Hopefully I can make your decision a bit easier: First of all, if you want some appetizers, definitely go with the fried calamari. DELICIOUS! My favorite pasta here by far is the bistro shrimp pasta: white sauce, with shrimp. My second favorite is the jambalaya: red, spicy sauce with different seafood. My friend got one of the salads here, and we were surprised to find that his dish was larger than any of the other dishes. Also, the steak diane is actually pretty good for a $20 steak dish. Cheesecakes are obviously good here: take your pick. They have pretty much every flavor you can think of for a cheesecake. Everything else is pretty self-explanatory. Overall, exactly what I expected: pretty good pasta and food, price is a bit high. David's VPP (Value Per Price): 6/10"
