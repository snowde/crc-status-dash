Nikki M.,"Minneapolis, MN",642,53,131,4.0,7/26/2017,"Leaving the famous Cheesecake Factory a 4, ONLY because I go often and usually have a great experience there. Though in my last visit, I would've ranked it a solid 2.5, and that kills me 'cause I love CF. Went last night for the boo thang's early birthday dinner. The breakdown of last night's shenanigans: Drinks: - Asian Pear Martini: Yuuum! This more so felt like a dessert than anything. It was sweet, smooth, & delicious. Only complaint is that it felt like there was barely any alcohol in it (granted it's supposed to be a sweet drink). If you're looking for something boozy like me, this might not be the drink for you. Apps: - THEIR BROWN STARTER BREAD: That sweet, delectable, soft, brown goodness that they serve before every meal. Just... wow. I think I more so come just for that than anything else really. If I could start my days with that bread, I couldn't pasta-bly (ha) ask for more. - Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls: probably should've expected this 'cause... I mean... it's a pasta restaurant... but the their take on Vietnamese spring rolls were a huge no-go for us. We were pretty sure they pre-made it and left them in the coolers all day. Wasn't fresh AT ALL. Entrees: - Farfalle w/ Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Pasta: Now THIS was bomb. You'd have to order it to see what I'm talking about. Normally comes with chicken, but I switched and paid the upgrade for shrimp. Only complaint is again- last night being the weird variable- I was pretty sure they forgot about us 'cause the food took way too long to come out, and it also came out barely warm. Normally a great meal though and still highly recommend. - Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp: the boo somewhat liked it. Huge portions which was a plus and had a colorful variety on the plate. First time ordering it so perhaps if it came out hotter, we might've enjoyed it more. Overall- though last night's experience was off, in general, they're a great place to eat. Didn't get a chance to eat their cheesecake last night, but note that it's one of the best!"
Kimberly P.,"Brooklyn Park, MN",49,1,,1.0,12/10/2017,"If I could give this place a zero I would. I am from Chicago so I do frequently visit the Cheesecake Factory and love it. However I do not get the same feeling about the Cheesecake Factory here in Minnesota. Here's my experience: Last night me and some coworkers visited this establishment in edina for a Christmas celebration. Being a Saturday, we knew there would be a wait on getting a table. However, at check in the hostess said it would be an hour wait. So we went over to partake in a drink at the bar while waiting. We saw that the high top tables were available and was told we could eat there and they were open seating. So we took two high top tables and the waitress brought us our menus, water, and bread. 15 mins later she came back and took our orders, I order the Fish and Chips and there was 10 of us. So it took about 30 mins for ""our"" food to arrive so multiple people brought our food but not our server. Any who after the last waitress showed up with a plate I still was missing my food. Waiting 5 more minutes my food still didn't arrive and nor did our waitress come to make sure everything was ok. So midway through my party eating my waitress final shows up, which was about 20 mins after the food was served. It was clear that I had an empty place in front of me and I had not received my food but she went to the other side of the table with the people who were eating to ask if they were ok. So I motioned her to ask her where was and asked her where was my food. Her answer, ""oh you didn't receive your food, I don't know what happened well what did you order I'll have them remake it for you."" So I said, ""remake, what do you mean it was never made, and what do you mean my coworkers were almost done eating."" I proceeded to say just cancel my order because at this rate I cant enjoy my food because my party was done. So as she brought the checks she came to me first and tried to tell me the reason I didn't get my food was because I sent it back. So I said why would I do that, that makes no sense, then she told me the wrong item I ordered. I was so distraught, I couldn't eat with my coworkers, I was really hurt and to have my coworkers sharing their meal with me because I was hungry. This is totally un acceptable after being there in total for about an hour and a half I had to go to wendys to get a chicken sandwich because I was hungry. The entire experience was horrible."
Karen S.,"Billings, MT",41,14,1,3.0,10/17/2017,"We live hundreds of miles from the Cheesecake Factory so when we're in the neighboorhood, we stop by! We'd had dinner so just stopped by for... you guessed it, dessert! Hubby had White Chocolate Raspberry and I had Oreo. Both were just okay.  However, we both got a slice to go for the next day's breakfast. Clearly a vacation move. In any case, I got the Cherry Cheesecake (traditional with cherry topping) and hubby got a chocolate mousse (?). Both were fantastic! I don't know if they're just better flavors or if it was being able to eat cheesecake for breakfast in bed with no children clamoring for a bite, but both were A-Mazing!"
Chuck S.,"Logan, UT",35,87,109,5.0,1/8/2018,"Love the Factory and the extensive menu. No one has the depth and variety of menu. From Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Cajun, to meatloaf, where else can you get that variety. But the high end presentation at incredible pricing is the best. Oh, I forgot to mention the cheesecake. That's for another review."
Lin B.,"Minneapolis, MN",19,11,17,4.0,12/19/2017,Really great Thai lettuce wraps. The best I've had and the dipping sauces were excellent.
Layan A.,"Minneapolis, MN",92,246,374,3.0,11/23/2017,"Been to plenty of Cheesecake Factory's before, was disappointed in this one. It was a busy weekend lunch, as usual. They don't have a good vegetarian/vegan selection, even with this extensive menu. Whatever we did ask for, they were already out of! Baked artichoke, spaghetti, etc you get the picture. I ordered an vegetarian pasta recommended by our waitress, it was super chewy and not edible. They were gracious enough to take it off the bill. The fried Mac n cheese balls are delicious but super unhealthy. We got a couple of cheesecakes to go and those were ok. Red velvet cheesecake is overrated. All in all, I wouldn't come back."
Kearim M.,"Saint Paul, MN",17,2,,2.0,1/1/2018,"I went here for my birthday celebration. I got seated at a booth. It took the server Richard over 5 minutes or longer to come over and say hi and take my order. The lunch rush was over a long time ago, this was at like 2:45 and there was hardly any people in the lobby or waiting area. Our main course took a long time to come out. And Richard hardly came over to check in and ask if we needed anything. We had to keep looking for him and flag him down. He said the chef walked out and a manager was cooking one of the courses, I think it was the teriyaki chicken. A manager never came over to our table to say anything about this. Food was good but bad service overall. Not a good birthday experience, definitely disappointed."
LULU S.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,6,1,1.0,12/28/2017,Yesterday we went to have dinner At the Cheesecake. Apparently the kitchen was backed up and added 1 hour to the already long wait to be seated. They got every order wrong. Burned food and had the audacity to serve by 5 yo raw sliders!!! Today she has a terrible stomach ache; praying it's not food poisoning.
Hei N.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,30,32,4.0,11/9/2017,Came here for the sangria. It was some of the best Sangria I've had in the Twin Cities metro area. Some of what we ordered didn't come with our food and the server took a while to check after the food was delivered. But other than that we had a pretty good experience.
M. H.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,124,38,1.0,12/3/2017,"Very disappointing location. No one seems happy to be there, the food quality has gone downhill, and it's not an enjoyable experience lately, especially in the last few years. We recently went to the new location at Ridgedale and it was a completely different experience than at this Southdale location. I'm amazed at the difference, but I do know Ridgedale will be our new location to visit."
Ann B.,"Solon Springs, WI",0,16,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Long wait for food. 4 children & 6 adults. Children's Mac & Cheese was large elbowroni with watery milk at the bottom of tbe bowl that didn't stick to noodles. I asked the waiter if this is the usual and he said sort of. Children did not eat. Chicken fingers fried too dark. Most of the adult food was sub-par. Tomatoes green and tasteless, avocados hard, pasta not enough sauce, salads tastless, etc. I had not eaten here for 5 years. Live out of state now. I had good memories of this restaurant. Too bad it has changed. I hate to pay for food that is not eaten. In this time of so many restaurants in competition, The Cheesecake Factory needs to make some changes. Wish I had read the reviews before bringing my family there."
Rebecca L.,"New York, NY",0,135,46,1.0,11/25/2017,Don't even bother using their curbside pick up if you're planning on having them bring the food out to the car. I ordered curbside because I was unable to leave 2 small children plus one big dog unattended in my car: I called 3 times and waited 30 minutes only for them to never come outside. I will never come here again
Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",308,1266,1214,4.0,5/12/2017,"This place continually delivers. Met a friend for lunch on a Friday afternoon. He hasn't been for an entire meal, just dessert. After perusing the menu he settled on a personal pizza with a good size Caesar salad. He commented that it was quite a hearty portion. I had the lunch size chicken and avocado salad. We washed our lunches down with a few beers and a bloody mary which was subpar. Nothing too special about that bloody mary. Service was great as always. Lunch time conversation, gabbing with my friend in the back booth was a perfect combination of food, great service and fun and we didn't have to wait to be seated."
Anabelle C.,"Blaine, MN",71,63,261,2.0,5/29/2017,"This place is widely popular and I hear many people hype about it. The interior decor must be what people are hooked on about because the food left me less than impressed. Everything we had was subpar. The chicken wings were burnt...I couldn't believe they actually brought the wings out like that. My friend asked for light sauce in her alfredo and it still came out drenched. My omelette was good, but you really can't mess up an omelette. My side potatoes were burnt. I didn't even take any leftovers home because I don't want to eat it again! The waitress was nice and understanding, that's why this is a two star review. My friend was able to have the wings taken off her bill. Unfortunately would not come back here :(. Also the menu selection is huge which probably contributes to subpar food. They include everything from American, Italian, to Vietnamese and Chinese. I was just overwhelmed."
Jimmy W.,"Minneapolis, MN",5,49,6,5.0,6/19/2017,"It's been a while since I came here but hey, the menu is huge and Ashley is awesome! Too bad you can only find her 1 day a week. Here is the deal , if your gonna go here it normally would suck due to the children, crabby Edina moms who are done shopping, wierd people who want to hang in Edina. But tonight , it was the perfect experience for me -and I was treated fabulous and loved my food and drink"
Kristin G.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,6,2,2.0,10/7/2017,Always disappointed in the price and size. Except this time my husband's piece was a good size. Mine ....not so much! They probably gave him a big piece because of the ridiculous kind he chose.
Vashion M.,"Minneapolis, MN",24,105,100,4.0,3/5/2017,"I like the Cheesecake Factory and have been here many times before.  The food and drinks are okay, and as far as my own personal experience goes, the service has always been on point. I met a friend today at the Factory for brunch and arrived right as they were opening, so there was no wait and I was promptly seated.  It had been almost a year since I was last at the Factory, so when I went there today, I was surprised that the amount of calories was listed next to almost each item.  The calorie count of certain dishes and slices of cheesecake that I had eaten before shocked me a bit!  One certainly does not go here if one is on a diet!  ;)  At any rate, the server was polite, courteous, and attentive.  I ordered avocado toast, which was OK, and some coffee.  I felt the avocado could have been slightly more well seasoned with a little extra lime and salt, but that's just me.  I did enjoy the multiple fresh sprigs of cilantro but not sure why there were radishes included.  My friend ordered an omelette with ham.  She assumed the ham would be cut up and incorporated into the omelette, but instead, she was brought a whole slice of ham on a plate.  She told the server about it, returned her plate, and the problem was promptly rectified, and she seemed to enjoy her food.  The serving, of course, was huge, so she wasn't able to finish it all.   As an aside, one of the fun things I like about coming to the Cheesecake Factory is, if it's your birthday, they will give you a special plate with ""Happy Birthday To You"" written on the plate in chocolate sauce as well as receiving a free miniature sundae with a candle. Bottom line is that I will return here but mostly for special occasions and occasionally meeting people for brunch/lunch. Tip (that most may already know):  When planning to go to CF, go right at the time they open or during an evening weeknight, as it will be less busy."
Kurt M.,"Minneapolis, MN",277,230,3,4.0,8/18/2016,"The impulse to look upon chain restaurants with disdain is understandable. Too often they tend to live down to already modest expectations. That said, on the multiple occasions I've enjoyed lunch or dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, I find them a cut above average. Ordinarily a menu as voluminous as the one offered by CF would be a bright red flag. No place can be all things to all people. Right? While this may hold true in general, and while CF may have an occasional miss, I've found the majority of items that I've tried to be hits. I particularly like the Chicken Piccata (I substitute mashed potatoes for the angel hair pasta). It probably has more sodium than a family of five needs in a week. But it's rich, savory and chock full of mushrooms and capers. It invariably makes for two meals since I end up taking about half of the serving home with me. The other day I ate here with my daughter before a visit to the Apple Store (my next review). She ordered the Vegan Cobb Salad described as ""Crisp Lettuce Topped with Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa, Almonds and Sunflower Seeds with House Vinaigrette."" It was bright, crisp and filled with fresh veggie goodness. She can be quite critical of commercial salads but pronounced this a winner. She added to it an order of falafel. We both found them to be appealingly crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside. I've never experienced anything other than cordial and professional service. Iced Tea and water are promptly refilled without asking. Food arrives in a reasonable time frame and is typically at the proper temp. There have been some longer wait times for a table but nothing too onerous. Most recently (on a Tuesday evening) we were seated immediately. This is not a hipster, foodie destination. Nor does it aspire to be such. It really is one of those relatively rare destinations where in my experience everyone should be able to find something much to his or her liking. Finally, of course the cheesecake is very good. I especially like the Dulce de Leche Caramel and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. I also enjoy a very occasional slice of the Chocolate Tower Truffle cake. Extremely indulgent? Yep! Excessively caloric? You betcha! Completely over the top? No doubt. But I rationalize the dessert overload by noshing on it for a few days, pulling a huge slice out of the frig for a few bites at a time."
Meena I.,"Savage, MN",1,8,6,5.0,9/27/2017,"Great food, great service! And they give you loads of bread and butter. Pricey but it's fancy! The average wait is normally 30-45 minutes! But it's definitely, definitely worth it. It's also a great atmosphere to be in. I love it!"
Vidur P.,"Minneapolis, MN",4,30,50,1.0,9/16/2016,"I just wanted a latte. I couldn't order because the official excuse given was ""I am sorry we are out of cups"". Ridiculous!! otherwise the place is quite neat"
Sarah S.,"Plymouth, MN",26,56,10,4.0,3/14/2017,Good restaurant for a chain. Good food for a chain it takes forever to get seated but once you get seated it goes quick. Food came a lot faster than I expected for how busy it is. The prices are kinda high but the portions are huge. I wouldn't come back but that's only because I don't like chains but this chain wasn't bad at all.
Liz H.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,16,,5.0,9/3/2017,"I love the food at this place! It's a go-to for me for celebrating with my girl friends. We had avocado egg rolls and crispy Cuban rolls for our apps, both of which were hot, fresh and tasty. We had a slight wait on the bread because it came right out of the oven, which is OK by me! My savory Chicken Madeira hit the spot, although I also had a bite of the Chicken Costoletta, and I would definitely order that next time because it was light on the breading and the lemon was fresh in a tangy but not overpowering way. I was told the chopped salad was also excellent. We had cheesecake, of course! I branched out from my favorite (White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle) and I was not disappointed with my Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. My friends highly enjoyed their very chocolaty cheesecakes, too, of which there is quite a variety.  The server was fun and friendly, but also gave us our space. We enjoyed the outdoor patio setting, which was much quieter and pleasantly warmer than the air conditioned interior, though this was my first time on the patio and I've had equally pleasant experiences on my previous visits."
Tarra G.,"Bloomington, MN",384,101,7,5.0,5/30/2017,Does it bug me that they don't take reservations? Yes. Does that stop me from going anyway? Nope. I've been coming here a long time and can honestly say we've never left feeling like the food or the service was bad or even just meh; it's consistently so good. There are even apps that will do delivery from CCF when we don't want to leave the house and still have an amazing meal.
Danny G.,"Rosemount, MN",4,5,,2.0,3/17/2017,"Food was good, service was slow as hell, lunch bill was messed up (double charged me on lunch entrees and deserts). Overall bad customer service, slow service. Food was great."
James V.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,16,,3.0,8/26/2017,"I'm always intrigued by this place. No matter when you go...it's always packed. I've been to a couple of locations and this one is just like the rest. Food is average but you get huge portions. They also have tons of staff... yet always seen to offer very poor service. Maybe the staffing model needs tweaking? Our table, and the ones around us, seemed forgotten about as servers whisked by to other areas. Will I go back? Probably. But the experience is never memorable."
Donna S.,"Minneapolis, MN",58,27,11,5.0,12/13/2016,"It's always a treat coming here because there is only one location in MN. Not only that but the drive from Arden Hills to Edina isn't always ideal.  I love coming here, the brown bread is the BEST with butter .. mmmm .. the white bread is great for dipping in pasta sauce if you choose to order pasta.  Every time I come here I order the same dish and cheesecake. Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta --extra spicy. IT IS SOOOO GOOD, even if you don't get it extra spicy it is still spicy. I love the sauce, the chicken is always cooked perfectly, the noodles .. goodness I never loved penne noodles so much.  I always get the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake, it is so delicious and rich with chocolate. I used to always get the German Cheesecake but they no longer have that .. they actually haven't had that for years.  I have had their lettuce wraps, they are tasty. They egg rolls ... pretty dang good, their mushrooms ..mmmmmmmm yum, calamari is always good. Those appetizers are pretty good.  Their fries are good, chicken bang, bang, is delicious, fish and chips are good and crispy, their Diana steak is DELICIOUS too. They have good food but i prefer their pasta."
Solomon N.,"Eden Prairie, MN",36,143,228,3.0,5/22/2016,"The ambience is as usual what you expect.. the place is bustling with the crowd n its great to be getting the cheesecake factory experience. So talking about he food, I had the Chicken Madeira which was ok. The chicken was tender n mashed potatoes were fine. My wife had the miso salmon which was ok as well. The desert my friends is to die for, we had the Chocolate Tuxedo cream cheesecake which is our favourite n as always, it's great."
Catherine C.,"Northeast, Minneapolis, MN",169,205,1132,4.0,6/22/2015,"Quite possibly THE unhealthiest restaurant in America, but man, some of the dishes here are done extremely well, have quality ingredients and are tastefully presented! My favorite being the Chicken Bellagio on their Specialties menu. Angel hair, basil pesto sauce, crispy fried chicken breasts and my favorite part, the prosciutto and arugula on top. Wow.  Their Chipotle Chicken Pasta is also good, and their Avocado Egg Rolls are delicious for an appetizer.  Having a husband who does not eat avocados, they are all mine! Yay. Their hamburgers are good, probably similar to what you would find at Applebee's, not Red Cow. The Mac and Cheese burger is a yummy choice if you are looking for something different. Their French Fries are thick and fresh! Probably some of my favorite restaurant fries ever. The bread they serve with the meal is a French baguette and a Wheat Oatmeal loaf. Very good. For dessert I would recommend their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, Godiva Chocolate, Lemoncello cheesecake and this seasonal one I tried yesterday, the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. Everything about that last sentence screams incredible and you should try them all if you are a cheesecake lover! What this place does best is utterly behemoth portions that last 2-3 days in the fridge and you can get lots of leftover meals from it. Cheesecake included. It looks like Vegas inside, with lots of ceiling decorations and painted walls. Reminds me of the Luxor and Caesar's Palace, very pretty. You will probably need your stretchy pants and a nap when you get home. It's the only Cheesecake Factory in Minnesota so enjoy in moderation!"
Ruth M.,"Eden Prairie, MN",60,118,7,5.0,4/17/2016,"Atmosphere: Warm, elegant, and inviting. Service: Depending on when you go, service can take a little while because this is such a popular restaurant. Everytime I have gone, service has been pretty quick for a full house. Everyone also seems friendly and checks on the table often. Food: Holy delicious! The menu is HUGE so there is something for everyone. Plus each item is bursting with flavor. Save room for a slice of cheesecake, I recommend the Dutch Apple! Price: $$$ Although a bit spendy, it's worth it. The food is really good and the portions are large so you will definitely have leftovers. I'm not sure how this place only has 3 stars, I'm really surprised! If you can afford a nice night out on the town, The Cheesecake Factory comes highly recommended."
Victoria D.,"Osseo, MN",0,8,26,3.0,11/5/2016,"Let me just say they have a huge menu with lots of options for any eater. Depending on what you get the food is tasty. The cheesecakes are also good. We got the pork-chop with mashed potatoes and you won't be disappointed, very flavorful and moist. We also got the vege egg rolls and those are very fresh and food. I gave this 3 stars bc of the service we received.  The lady was nice but terrible at managing her tables. We got no silverware so had to eat the porkchop with a spoon for the first bite or two. We didn't receive our dessert and it was given to a different table. It definitely was not her night."
Kim G.,"Cloquet, MN",0,57,56,5.0,12/22/2016,"We had a very delightful holiday lunch last Friday at the southdale Cheesecake Factory. Lovely decor, very delicious food, and great service. We had a veggie burger and a Chinese chicken salad . No room for cheesecake though. Always have had a very enjoyable experience here. Bring money."
Corey H.,"Minneapolis, MN",290,263,378,3.0,3/30/2016,"I took two sixth grade girls here to celebrate spring break. We had lunch sized portions of fish and chips, herb salmon, and they had cheesecake. Last time I liked my meal better, it was an almond crusted salmon on a bed of kale and it was all chopped up and really delicious. This time the salmon was OK and it was even what he recommended as the most popular salmon. The girls seem to like their meal, but for $65 before tip and us all having water to drink, it was pricy for just being average meal."
Joe H.,"Pierre, SD",0,22,2,5.0,1/28/2017,This was my first time eating at the Cheesecake Factory. My girlfriend loves it and brought me for my birthday.  The menu is huge. Anybody should be able to find something they like.  The staff was very courteous. The waitress stopped back frequently to refill our drinks and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a place to eat and am sure I will be returning in the future.
Faustina C.,"Mansfield, CT",137,18,3,5.0,6/16/2017,Happy Hour is super affordable. Great drinks (especially the margarita and mojito). Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 4-6pm in the bar area. Come early it gets busy.
El Hombre G.,"St Cloud, MN",3,25,4,5.0,12/12/2016,"Still one of our favorites, always tasty food and drink and desert with enough to take home. And the service always superior. Special commendation for Nicholas P, he is giving Scott a run for his money for the crown for best waiter in the Twin Cities! Obviously a well-managed restaurant."
Scott D.,"Minneapolis, MN",527,3,4,1.0,2/26/2017,"Excruciatingly bad and slow service this evening. Food took forever to be served and was cold upon arrival. Appetizer never arrived. Special requests forgotten. Dessert ordered to go, added another 20+ minute wait before we could finally get out of there after almost 3 hours. Very frustrating and maddening."
Luke G.,"Excelsior, MN",173,1,1,5.0,7/31/2016,Very disappointed with the size. They only cut down the whole Amazon rainforest to make this salad. THERE WAS NO CHEESECAKE IN MY SALAD AND THEY CALL THIS PLACE A FACTORY. AS IF! Also the weather was bad so I blame them. Never coming back.
Keri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",107,87,,3.0,3/12/2017,"Went last night to pick up a few slices for a girlfriend and I. I can't complain about how delicious the dessert is. But the restaurant was chaotic. It was hard to figure out where I needed to go, what line to stand in, and what the process was. A sign or two would help immensely. Service was okay - maybe even good for the amount of pressure the worker was under to keep things going."
Ellen C.,"Oakland, CA",148,710,23,4.0,1/2/2016,"One of the greats when it comes to chains. All Cheesecake Factories deliver consistently on service and food. There always seems to be a wait for this place, but unlike in SF, the wait is generally around 30 minutes to an hour. Ambience is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory, strangely pleasing despite being a chain, they've really got the design and experience down pat!  We got the grilled salmon (comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli) and the chicken bellagio (lightly crisped chicken breast on top of pesto spaghetti, prosciutto, and arugula). I've never been let down with any of the dishes I've had here, their pastas are always delicious (if you're not expecting hand made pasta), their avocado egg rolls are amazing. I've never had anything sweet or savory that I regretted here, so it's a safe choice and a great place if you just want a good, reliable meal without figuring out where to go.  This is located in the Southdale Mall, so if you don't want to wait you can try the other restaurants they have in the same mall (PF Chang's, Rojo's, an Italian fast food place) or you can go catch a movie @ AMC. There's always shopping! But remember that their buzzer doesn't work anywhere outside Cheesecake.  The only thing they could do a little better is to have a bigger bar area to have a place for people to hang out before they get their tables - it gets way too crowded in there."
Kundan P.,"Plymouth, MN",27,27,20,3.0,5/10/2017,It is a fancy restaurant with lots to choose from but food tasted like an average restaurant just expensive. They could do better if they put a little bit of focuse on food rather than decor. Visiting once is okay.
