Jennifer Y.,"Rogers, MN",121,93,29,4.0,4/14/2011,"The...Best...Cheesecake...Ever!  I seriously can't eat cheesecake from anywhere else.  Their cheesecake is so rich & creamy, and you can choose from over like 50 flavors.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The food is good, just expensive.  I love the Buffalo Blasts & the Chicken Picatta!"
Laine D.,"Winnipeg, Canada",43,39,3,4.0,10/27/2010,"Great dinner overall. Was busy as usual so we opted for the lounge.  We couldnt wait for food (starving) so I got a chocolate milk from the bartender.  Very willing to help my quasi diabetic request..lol.  Got a table in the lounge in 5 mins.  Server was friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Rib-eye - ~13oz.  Rare.  Cooked perfect.  Great seasoning.  Good size.  Subbed out the fries for mashed.  Great mashed potatoes as I dont normally like mashed. Hibachi Steak - Cooked perfect.  Great marinade. Cheesecake was amazing as always."
Deborah N.,"Osseo, MN",0,6,1,1.0,9/25/2014,"Went here for my moms birthday. All our food came except hers. Waitress never checked back. Loud restaurant, hard to hear.  They ruined a nice birthday dinner out. Waitress was rude and impersonal."
Anthony N.,"Round Rock, TX",121,46,381,5.0,1/22/2011,Still the best.  I was away on a business trip and when to my most favorite chain restaurant.  The service is consistent with any other Cheesecake Factory.
Liz B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,38,,1.0,5/26/2013,"I have eaten at this chain restaurant in many cities (Boston, Houston, LA,). this was the worst experience: my salad was so obviously not fresh (cucumbers should never be cut 2 days ahead of time!), the enchilada was cold, and my mom's filet mignon was just acceptable. the cheesecake was just ok, nothing remarkable either. of course, the service was slow"
Kimlinh B.,"Eden Prairie, MN",29,101,12,1.0,11/25/2009,"Disclaimer: I have never liked the food at the Cheesecake Factory, and I've eaten at locations in Raleigh, DC, Atlanta, Milwaukee and now, Edina. My sister wanted cheesecake for her birthday, so I'll admit I was dragged to this dinner.  I went in with low expectations, but hoping to be pleasantly surprised. It's been a few years since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory...  The decor is nice, the booths comfortable, the hostess stand was well organized, the cheesecakes in the case looked appealing, and the place was so busy on a Tuesday night I figured it couldn't be that bad. Then I looked at the menu. First warning sign: It's about 20 pages long. If the menu is unfocused, the kitchen is unfocused. That tells me they do a mediocre job on a variety of things - a little bit of Asian fusion, a little Tex-Mex, alongside burgers, seafood and steak. Second, the prices are high for what you're getting. Sure, the portions are large, so there's a high perceived value, but do we really need to stuff our faces? I'd rather be given the option to order half portions or simply go to a better restaurant and get quality food for my money. Ahi Tartare: small dices of tuna on avocado, plated in a ring mold and served with 4 crispy wontons and pickled ginger. Totally unoriginal, but the flavors were good.  However, the avocado was cut in huge unwieldy chunks, rather than diced the same as the tuna. I'm not just nit-picking on an aesthetic point. It makes eating the dish easier, and shows attention to detail on the part of the kitchen. This looked like someone scooped avocado chunks from the sandwich bar. Beets with Goat Cheese: not enough beets, not enough goat cheese. The candied pecans were good. Crispy Chicken Taquitos: bland, bland, crispy, bland. And I don't even like that much salt. The salsa was bland; the guacamole was bland.  Wild Mushroom Soup: I liked the large chunks of mushroom, and even though it was a little on the salty side for me, it was very creamy and tasty. It was too thick, though. I ordered soup, not porridge.  Chocolate-Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake: disappointing. There was a vague aroma of raspberry liquor, but no actual fruit or raspberry glaze or sauce to provide the necessary tart, fruity tang to balance out the overwhelming creaminess of the chocolate cheesecake.   I used to think Cheesecake Factory had fine cheesecake and bad food. Now I just don't understand the appeal at all. However, every location I've ever been to has always been hopping, there's always a wait, and apparently people are willing to pay their outrageous prices, so there must be something I just don't get.  The only time I'll ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory is if someone else is paying."
Dennis L.,"St Paul, MN",30,42,,4.0,9/12/2010,"Love this place. I think it's the only one in the state (but i could be wrong). I wish i could tell you more about the other items on their menu unfortunately the first thing I had was their meatloaf and now i can't dare to try anything else when i'm there. It's too damn good and i would feel like i'm cheating on the meatloaf if i were to try anything else!  I did, however, try one of their appetitzers and the Avacodo Eggrolls were scrumptious. Wait...i did dig in on one of their delicious cheesecakes too. Though how can you choose which one? They have so many options it's hard to say which is the best. One thing to note: their portion sizes are crazy big. If i skip the app and dessert, i could finish the main course, but then i feel like exploding afterwards. Fun times!"
Julie A.,"Shakopee, MN",2,30,,4.0,8/26/2014,"Service is a tad slow, which is a bummer. It's always busy and is a chaotic mess at times...Bringing in large groups also is a headache. If you do plan on going, be prepared to wait. The wait can last 5 minutes or an hour. However, the food is good (I encourage the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta) and the cheesecake is delicious. Been there a handful of times and can't complain too much."
Blessed A.,"St Paul, MN",0,25,,1.0,3/6/2012,"oh man. Am i ready to give Cheese Cake factory a review. *(cracking my knuckles)*  food was ok. Cakes were good. no complaints there. NOW... let me begin halfway through our dinner with my loved one. the waiter comes over with a smerk on his face. i could tell he didnt want to be there by the look on his face. or maybe moms just dropped him on his face one to many times while watching Oprah with a pack of Full Flavored Kool 100's in one hand while juggling him and the bottle of Scotch in the other? so....... he comes over stares at me with a David hasselhof look and says anything else. We said No thank you. he reaches into his pocket and pulls out some sort of stick, leans up and over into my food and starts to sweep off some of the pepper that i accidently got on the table. Shocked with disbelief in my mind i was like WTF yo?!? he takes a step back, this time gives me a ""The Apprentice"" your FIRED!!! Donald Trump look and walks away with this peppered up glue stick in his hand. Seriously is this normal at the ""DontSpillAnyFreakinPepperOnYourTableOtherwiseYouG­etTheGlueStickCakeFactory""    if it is then my apoliges. If not, Management seriously needs to hire and properly train their staff.  Zero Stars in my books."
Jackie R.,"Nokomis, Minneapolis, MN",117,184,8,4.0,11/4/2009,"My friends could not believe that I had never been to the Cheesecake Factory, so when we needed a place to go out for a multi-birthday celebration, this was the choice.  We went on a Tuesday night and we still had to wait about 25-30 minutes for a table. Popular place.  The server was nice but it was very hard to hear her. I also thought it was a little dark in there. The menu is HUGE, it's almost ridiculous. It was hard to choose what to get. We ended up sharing the big appetizer sampler thing, and I also got a salad.  The brown bread they brought out was great. The salad I had (Boston House Salad) was delicious. Most of the appetizers were pretty good. I didn't care for the spring rolls and didn't try the calamari or the avocado rolls (whatever they were called) but everything else was good.  The best part, not surprisingly was the cheesecake. I ordered a piece of red velvet cheesecake and a piece of vanilla bean to take home. I kind of regret getting the vanilla bean, even though I haven't tried it yet, because the red velvet was SO DAMN GOOD. I'm not even exaggerating when I say it might be the best thing I have ever eaten in my life."
Pat S.,"Rochester, MN",14,22,,4.0,1/24/2013,"I am very much a fan of cheese cake factory.  I have been to several in my travels and they are consistent with food, speed, pricing.  Waiter/Waitress speed has never been that great at any of the resturants. I not eaten anything I don't like.  Yes the sizes are huge but my family and I always plan for take home and you have lunch for the next day.  The stuffed mushrooms are awesome, crab cake sandwich, meatloaf dinner, veggie wraps etc.  Yum!!!  Drink prices are terrible. As for the desserts, we skip them."
Margaret O.,"Minneapolis, MN",83,107,113,4.0,4/4/2010,"This is a standard ""dinner and a movie"" place for us, since it's right next to the Southdale theaters. And if you want a ton of food, the Cheesecake Factory is the place to go.  I always leave completely stuffed, so stuffed that I hardly ever get to ordering any cheesecake! Tonight I got cream cheese crab wontons (yummy, but dipping sauce not my fave), and a burger. The burger had more muenster cheese than I've *ever* seen on one piece of food, plus avocado and a nice, tart mustard sauce. It was excellent and so large I could hardly finish it.  Side salad with the burger was quite good too, although a little wilted from being ""drenched"" with dressing (but the dressing was good). Usually, I get the ""small plate"" endive salad (yum!) except I like it with Ranch dressing more than the vinagrette it normally comes with.  Then, I'll order an appetizer like the avocado egrolls and call it a meal."
Mike C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",16,131,11,3.0,4/12/2012,"Visited the Southdale location yesterday and was mildly impressed. Upon entry I was pleasantly surprised by the decore. I don't know if I have actually ever been to a Cheesecake Factory and if I have it has probably been a while, so it is completely possible that subconsciously definition of The Cheesecake Factory has been slowly built through the many episodes of ""Big Bang Theory"" that I have watched. The floors are white marble, the booths and tables are constructed of some sort of dark wood, and the lighting is a bit brighter than dim which helps make this place seem more classy. I ordered the Chicken Marsala which was served on a bed of bow tie pasta and one stray tube of penne pasta. Chicken Marsala is typically one of my favorite Itallian dishes as it offers the perfect balance of sweet and salty with the nice Marsala wine flavor. The portion that came was fairly large and came with a good amount of chicken and mushrooms and a nice brown gravy. If presentation were the only catagory I was judging this place on they would have certainly earned at least one additional star. After the first few bites I noticed that the chicken did not really have any flavor itself, and the Marsala sauce resting on the chicken was the only thing giving the dish any life at all. This immediately made me think of a large metal tin resting gently on a tub of hot water, in the kitchen, piled high with chicken breasts and ""chefs"" pulling from this pile, throwing them onto a bed of (insert pasta type here) then going over to the sauce bin, slathering the plate with (insert sauce type here), right before being served. More or less your high end production assembly line type of food service (for clarification: high end for this catagory is at best 3 stars). The Marsala sauce had nice initial flavor, unfortunately the back end tasted a bit watered down. I don't like wasting food, so I finished the chicken and mushrooms, but the pasta and watery sauce was too much for me to be able to put it down. Being that we were at the Cheesecake Factory and that I love Cheesecake, this made for a very nice arrangement! If you are an avid Cheesecake lover such as myself they basically have every variety of cheesecake you would ever want. Fruit toppings, chocolate toppings, candy bar toppings, Orea toppings, combinations thereof, the list is endless and one should literally decide by throwing a dart into a board. We ended up with the Snickers Cheesecake and it was delicious! Had we just come here for dessert, easily 4 stars. It tasted like the whip cream was made in-house; it was nice and cold, thick, and paired very nicely with our cheesecake, and I can easily see it pairing well with fruit topped cheesecakes as well. Overall the experience was enjoyable, I just wish the food tasted better (especially for the price), and that the server came around a bit more frequently. Their long list of cheesecakes will probably bring me back sometime in the near future, but unfortunately probably not for dinner."
Donna N.,"Oro Valley, Tucson, AZ",8,78,,3.0,10/31/2009,"First Time I ever ate at the Cheesecake Factory was in Scottsdale Arizona (next to my hotel).  Well I could see the appeal immediately. The only thing I ever order is the Chicken Madeira....it's magical and addicting...can never eat the whole dish (and soooo excited for the left overs). Just like a bar cashs in on drinks, this place must subsidize it's self with the cheesecake bill.  I'm not a cheesecake lover at all, but the godiva chocolate cheescake can send anyone to heaven."
Rachel G.,"Minneapolis, MN",165,150,10,2.0,8/18/2009,"Not original and kinda cheesy.  Everything about this place screams - over fed, over indulgent Americans.    Menu gave you way too many choices.  How can a kitchen be good at THAT many dishes?  Food was HUGE, too sweet, and too salty. Best thing was the service."
Maria M.,"Minneapolis, MN",8,14,,4.0,8/7/2010,"My mother would always take me here, and we would always share a meal and split the bill. They are pretty pricey... (I have also heard that the movie theater and this restaurant are the main things keeping Southdale mall alive)  Anyhoo... This is the first and only restaurant I have ate calamari at and loved it. It was wonderful!! I also will only eat fish and chips from two places, Here, and Mystic Lake....  The bread is here also to die for. The place is pricey, but it's pricey for a reason. Good customer service and great food!!"
Cari S.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,27,1,2.0,3/26/2015,"First off, I love being seated between a group of women in their late 40's having a wine themed birthday party and two women on the other side who judged everything they could. I was lucky enough to share the long booth bench smushed between such a perfect group on a date for my anniversary. The waiter couldn't give a damn to really help us, never gave us the specials ( heard him tell others as they say down) and could rarely be found. What was going to be a nice three course dinner to celebrate we quickly (I say that liberally because of how long it would take before we saw our waiter each time) decided on an appetizer and cheesecake to go and went back to our hotel and ordered room service (probably better food anyways). This was my first and last time there. Not to mention our cheesecake to-go was just thrown in the boxes with no plastic silverware. When I go somewhere with such a reputation and higher prices I expect a little more."
Aaron H.,"Northeast, Minneapolis, MN",376,32,16,4.0,4/7/2012,"Trendy, fun, and relatively unique for a chain. Great cheesecake. Nice date place. There is a patio in the summer."
Sherrie C.,"Burnsville, MN",0,27,,3.0,5/13/2012,"We loved the decor of The Cheesecake Factory,  and we only had to wait about 20 minutes to be served on Mother's Day.  Our waiter was very friendly, efficient and helpful.  The brown oatmeal bread was delicious. Now, on to the other food.  It was just okay, and we all ordered different items.  Nothing stood out exceptionally except for the prices which are extremely high.  A beer was over seven dollars?  Are you kidding me?  Our bill came to over one hundred dollars.  The best part of the meal was my pineapple upside down cheesecake, it was yummy!!!!!!!  Probably had three thousand calories though!  It's not a bad restaurant overall, we would probably go again, but it is overpriced."
Corey C.,"St Paul, MN",39,93,10,3.0,6/19/2009,"If you can look past the over zealous Stepford wifes eating what they think is fine dinning its not that bad of a place. Consider a sports bar without the TVs in every nook and cranny, throw some gouda cheese on the burger rather then American, dress the waitresses in white, hike up the price and you have The Cheesecake Factory. (if you don't tip here, but tip at the sports bar, its the same price) Its good for what it is, the price isn't the best, but they have a huge selection of entree's guaranteed to please everyone!"
