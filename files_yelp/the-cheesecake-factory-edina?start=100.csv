Katie L.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,21,5,3.0,4/3/2016,"Not impressed. If I pay 120$ for 3 entrées, 1 app, 2 drinks & 2 desserts I expect way better. Service was slow. They got our order wrong twice. Tip to wait staff: if u r refilling a drink, 1st bring the new one THEN take the original away. Don't take my drink to remember what to bring back. Wait staff left fallen dirty utensils on the floor. Bathroom (ladies) was dirty, garbage overflowing. We left our app plates at edge of table when we were done. Waitress left them there as she walked by sev x. I left my credit card on edge of table for many minutes trying to get someone to take our dessert order and get our bill bc we were late for a movie. Ok. That said food was REALLY good. Way too many restaurants to try close by. Don't bother w this one."
Sarah K.,"St Paul, MN",43,94,90,4.0,12/23/2013,"So those reviewers who talked about how you should go at an odd time to avoid the wait? Yeah, do that. 'Cause if you don't, you're gunna have a bad time. I mean, I imagine you might. We didn't, 'cause we went at like 4 pm. Smart! I got the chicken madeira and a lemon drop martini, and my bf got the smokehouse bbq burger with a long island iced tea. I'm really glad that we decided against an appetizer, because zomg big effing portions. I was so stuffed and couldn't finish my chicken, which btw was delicious! I had asked the waiter to recommend some stuff to us, since their menu goes on forever (it truly is out of control), and that was one of the things he recommended, so I took a shot. It comes with mashed potatoes, a whole mountain of them, and two flattened chicken breasts breaded with....something, covered in cheese and asparagus, and then there's this sauce....idk it's like some kind of gravy that involves crack. All I know is that it was really really good. This could also be the lemon drop talking...I'm not sure. It's entirely possible that they booze you up before the food comes so you think it's amazing. We got cheesecake to go. That tuxedo business...it's got a lot of chocolate in it, so it's probably going to be good.  I can DEFINITELY see how annoying this place could be on a busy night, though. For as much as we enjoyed the atmosphere and the lack of other patrons (although their decor features a repetitive ""eye of sauron"" theme), by the time we left the annoying mall people and their tiny, loud children were arriving. Don't get me wrong, I love kids, I just don't like dining with them. So, I guess what I'm saying is go. Go during lunch time...maybe around 1 or 2 pm, and bring a lot of people so you can all get different dishes and then eat off each other's plates. Then get cheesecake to go. The end."
Amy W.,"St Paul, MN",2,8,3,5.0,3/8/2015,"Great experience every time!  Great meals, and of course, great cheesecake!  Red velvet is my fave"
Ron J.,"Shakopee, MN",37,9,,5.0,3/20/2016,Love the shrimp scampi & combos...happy hour aps are great deals and food  comes out always PERFECT.....Love it!!!
Topsy K.,"Minneapolis, MN",4,52,12,4.0,2/12/2015,"Went here last night and sat at the bar area to the left for a change of pace, never sat there before.  I've been here probably 5 or 6 times, but this time was awesome. Our bartender (according to the receipt) was ""Ashley P."" and she was one of the nicest people I've ever encountered in a restaurant atmosphere.  I would give her 6 Starts out of 5 in terms of service, no joke.  She seemed to have exceptional bar tending skills, and was really knowledgeable about food - she made really good food / dessert recommendations for us. Would have given it 5 stars, but I've always been a little bitter with this place since I called to inquired about an application I submitted there (this is probably a few years ago now), and the manager that I spoke with on the phone was a complete d**k.  He was a male, and that's all I remember from that experience.  Hopefully he has been fired or has fallen off the face of the earth by now. Both the Red Velvet Cheesecake and triangle-shaped mozzarella stick things I ate were ""mouth orgasms"" to say the least.  Thought that it was really cool that the kitchen staff knew which people the food went to without us even saying so, very impressive!"
Sarah M.,"Issaquah, WA",260,1036,,2.0,8/8/2013,"Our server totally ruined our experience in my opinion. I would have given this place a much higher rating had she not been such a b*&%h. She had no emotion, was pretty rude, obviously didn't want to be there...and made it really obvious. When we said goodbye to her, she didn't even say anything even though there's no way she couldn't have heard us. RUDE. Anyway, the food here was fine - we came for chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake and appetizers. The cheesecake was really good and a generous sized portion but really, really rich. I'm not sure my stomach can handle this anymore.  My Mom had the potstickers and my Dad had the chile rejos (have no clue how to spell that) and they both seemed to like them. Like every cheesecake factory, this place has an impressive selection of food and is generally pretty consistent. Just don't sit in the bar with the totally rude server.  $25-ish in total plus tip. Standard for this kind of place."
Amy X.,"Twin Cities, MN",56,22,15,5.0,4/29/2014,"First time here, for lunch. All the staff were friendly and helpful.  I got the Lemon Herb Chicken, and loved it but was a bit too sour with the lemon touch, but was still super amazing!"
Chandler W.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,1,,2.0,7/4/2016,"Food was adequate, but certainly not worth the wait of over an hour. The waitress deliberately avoided our table once she saw others seated after us getting their food, and then later came over and provided a lengthy and overly complicated story of how the kitchen staff was being finicky and our food still wasn't ready because ""You know how they are.""  She was awful. The management staff was incredibly awkward and unapologetic."
Michael N.,"Folsom, CA",18,41,4,3.0,1/10/2016,"This place is always packed since it's the only one in the city. I think of it kind of as an upscale family restaurant, that's neither really good at one thing or the next. We waited 40 min for our entrees on a Sunday night. Food portions are decent, but overall you could probably find better versions of their items at different restaurants, ie pasta at an Italian restaurant"
Chris H.,"Stratford, SD",7,3,1,5.0,3/6/2016,Service was absolutely amazing and fantabulous. The Thai glazed salmon was the best seafood I've ever had. Love it.
Andrew B.,"Saint Paul, MN",4,40,,2.0,5/20/2014,"I'm truly at a loss on how to rate this place.  It's one of the most bewildering restaurant experiences I've had all year. By the time I left, I had experienced a number of emotions: shock, sadness, horror, anxiety, embarrassment, contempt, and apathy to name a few. My first observation on walking in is how vast the space is, with it's large booths, presumably to better service it's large patrons.  As I took my seat I was given a menu the size of a novella. The sheer amount of choices was immediately overwhelming. For the first time of many that evening, I was forced to face some of the worst traits of American culture. How could a kitchen possibly handle such a hyperbolized variety? Only if your goal is to flame the culinary vanity of a mundane crowd. It seemed like mere minutes after I ordered when the food arrived. Apparently in America, you're not supposed to order slow, and have a relaxed multi-hour dinner with camaraderie. The dining experience here has been reduced to an inhuman mechanical action: get in, eat, get out. In addition, the portions are offensively large, often achieving a caloric density not previously thought possible, perhaps even hitting the upper limits of physics.  I felt as if I was being grasped at the back of the head, forced to gaze upon America's disgusting gluttony, to revel in all the waste, to force me to contend with the obesity around me. The worst part? The Cheesecake Factory has no shame; it offers no apology. It accepts this cultural degeneracy, and happily promotes it. There is no noble goal to skirmish with the ignorance of it's customers, but further raises the curtain. There is certainly no complaint from the eaters, as they stuff their bloated faces.  Of the things I tasted, they ranged from okay to bad--expected given the size of the menu. The best thing I tried was this delightful little salad that came with my tacos. A tiny paradise amongst the sea of butter, cream, and grease. The disturbing experience left me enervated, leaving me to ponder my existential place in this country, and the future of our people. Let this review be a warning to all: if you have any decency or respect for yourself, go somewhere else."
Rajesh M.,"Hopkins, MN",7,203,159,3.0,11/30/2015,Average appetizers and entrees.. Great dessert options. Service is hit or miss Always crowded and a bit cramped for space
Tim S.,"Sioux Falls, SD",19,51,6,3.0,12/6/2015,"Food was good, but not for the price. Really expensive, for two adult meals, one kid meal, non-alcoholic drinks, and two pieces of cheesecake, bill was about $80. I've had better food at Applebee's.  Service was good though. The wait was long, but that was expect used since it is a popular place to visit. The restaurant was clean and neat, bathrooms were also clean."
Cheryl B.,"Chanhassen, MN",0,4,,4.0,9/6/2016,Love their menu.  Everything we have had has been good and consistent.  Even when its busy we can usually sit at the bar.
Stevie P.,"Eden Prairie, MN",0,41,2,1.0,2/12/2016,What happened to this place?? Service is so slow!! Bar is so slow!! Kitchen is so slow!! And the Kitchen can't seem to get the orders right. A real disappointment. Been there 30 times and it's really gone downhill.
Michael P.,"Brooklyn Park, MN",109,20,1,1.0,8/15/2015,"Usually the restaurant does a good job. Servers are nice and the food is great. Today, my server was not very attentive. She seemed to avoid her tables, didn't bring bread out until 30 min after we sat, we asked the host for water refills and the two tables next to us had empty beverages. Someone at our table didn't get her salad."
Michelle H.,"Wyoming, MN",0,4,1,1.0,8/15/2015,"Service was slow and server was distracted and inattentive. We waited 40 after ordering for the food and missed our movie. When we finally received the food, it had been made incorrectly and had to be sent back. The manager seemed unwilling to do much about it."
Natalie M.,"Apple Valley, MN",191,10,,5.0,2/1/2016,It was a little busy but we found a place at the bar. And boy are we glad we did! A young man by the name of Patrick was our bartender- he was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu- thank god because there was a lot to choose from! I had the Ruby red sunrise and my partner had a Pineapple Moscow mule. It was a special visit for us mainly due to the outstanding service! Great job Patrick & the Edina Cheesecake Factory!
Wang C.,"Lakewood, WA",4,298,122,3.0,10/21/2015,"Bartender has good service skills. He even caught my bill mistake before I had a chance to say something to him. My food got skipped, and he personally checked to see what was going on. Unfortunately the food isn't nearly as good as it used to be. And it is more overpriced that it used to be."
Drew W.,"Minneapolis, MN",16,119,1,3.0,8/30/2015,Life in a restaurant inside a mall. Hmm not much my scene. Standard chain restaurant food. Excellent service here on two occasions! Really awsome happy hour! I think these places will do ok with all the new apartments going up around southdale.
