Joshua P.,"Lake Crystal, MN",15,13,20,4.0,12/17/2015,"Great food, quick to seat.  Cooks slow and waitress said they were new. Crispy crab Rangoons looked liked it had burnt ends but was tasty."
Steven J.,"Savannah, GA",6,6,1,4.0,11/3/2015,"White chicken chili was quite good, though more like a chicken gumbo than a white chili."
Amelia M.,"Carlos, MN",44,53,,5.0,10/29/2015,This is definitely my go to restaurant for any special occasion. Always a great experience and great food. They literally have pages and pages of options for you to choose from so your sure to find something no matter your mood. Tons of Oh em gee Cheesecake flavors too of course. Nice atmosphere and pretty decent staff that always hustling to bring you a nice dining experience :)
Lauren S.,"Minneapolis, MN",16,204,,3.0,8/18/2014,Why a 3 and not a 4. Not sure. I haven't been here in about 3 years. Happened to be shopping Southdale. Put our name in- it was a 40 minute wait. We took the buzzer and walked the mall. We knew we wouldn't get beeped out of range. Came back and when we checked in they took us off hold. Some restaurants would have said too bad and put us back at the end of the line. Points scored! We ordered the chopped salad and the veggie burger. Both were good not amazing but really good. What surprised me was how attentive and good our service was. I poo poo chains but this one isn't bad!
Jason B.,"Sidney, MT",6,67,17,4.0,7/25/2015,"First time eating at this location. Restaurant was clean, the service was excellent and the food was awesome. The desserts were hard to pick from because they all sounded good.  In the end we tried an Oreo and Smore  cheesecake along with a Stawberry shortcake. I would eat here again for sure."
Rich R.,"Mankato, MN",0,11,,1.0,5/14/2015,"Good grief, I have gone to this location maybe 8 times for dinner with the family, it has gotten worse each and every time to the point I have said never again. Last time was 3 disgusting glasses with stuff floating in them and one with what appeared to be chocolate chunks in my scotch along with a few dirty utensils. Tonight was crazy dumb. My chicken and cashew was not good enough for crows to eat. A gross unflavored breaded and deep fried chicken (the same chicken in one of my kids Orange chicken) with a sauce you couldn't make that bad if you tried to make someone sick, no spice and flavor of dirty leather. One had the catfish and liked it, one pasta (which is always fair) the other Sheppard pie ( better than mine but thyme and burger I can make at home in 4 minutes) . Service from our waitress Alex was well below normal, with virtually no concern of what anyone  thought of the food and two dishes taken away, eventually, with no questions as to why we wanted no boxes and nothing was eaten -gross. Desert only if you go and make sure you plate, silverware and glass is clean. We have had some super sweet servers over the years here but tonight's was crazy bad."
Adam K.,"Minneapolis, MN",19,12,23,1.0,2/25/2014,"So my family and I went here the other day... That was a horrible decision. Even though they have like 1 million things on their menu it doesn't seem like they can even perfect one. I was highly disappointed and over spent way too much money and wasted time here.  It was the equivalent to having food from a frozen bag.  It was not clean I was overcrowded and the food was subpar by all means.  The only thing that was satisfying was the beer, which I might add the waitress delivered the wrong one the first time.  I don't want to say I hate it but I have a had some great times at CheeseCake when I have gone in the past.  I don't think I will be visiting here again."
Heidi H.,"Minneapolis, MN",53,4,,2.0,6/27/2016,"Last Tuesday I went to dine here at 8:30 pm. The waiter seemed very nice and we got our drinks after a few minutes. I ordered the raspberry lemonade and it was so incredibly sour I could not drink it. I asked for the hibiscus instead. It took 30 minutes for that to come out.  When our food came, it was not what I ordered. The waiter who brought out the food told me he would have the manager come talk to us, that never happened. The waiter came back after 10 minutes and I told him the order was wrong and he said ""Oh yeah those 2 are right next to each other in the computer, I'll get it changed"". This would've been fine if they just re-fired the food right away. I know, working in the industry in the past, that you need to let the kitchen and manager know when you mess up an order so they can get it pushed to the front and it won't take long to make. I ordered the chicken picatta and it took ANOTHER 40 MINUTES for me to receive my food. By this time my date was done with his food (I told him not to wait).  We only saw the waiter during these couple times and he never came back to check on us and we never  saw the manager. Finally, the bill came and we were charged for BOTH drinks I had ordered even though I did not even drink the first one! He said he couldn't take it off the bill since it came to the table.. WHAT?!  For all the time we wasted (it wasn't even busy) this was not worth it. We weren't offered a discount or even free cheesecake or anything for all we went through. Luckily the food is good, but next time I am ordering to-go and won't dine in."
Sue L.,"Shakopee, MN",0,3,,2.0,5/31/2015,"Noisy, slow service. Quality of the food was poor. Saturday night is definitely not the time to go. So dark it is hard to read the complex menu. We had to wait n hour to be seated."
Kassi J.,"River Falls, WI",11,19,,2.0,2/21/2016,"I only gave this place 2 stars because the cheesecake isn't the worst that I've had. I have had better, even made better. Let's start from the top and work our way to the desert. Waited maybe 20 minutes, which was a relatively short time compared to other places (which were way better to eat at) that I have been to. Sat down and started looking over the long menu of 200 something items. I'll stop you at this point, that's a list of 200 disappointments to choose from. While everyone in our group had something different, not a single person was impressed with their meal. Ordered a couple of things to try off the snacks/sides/appetizer sections of the menu. Was not impressed really with ANY of it. Placed our main order in and half of the table's order came out. Waited several minutes before our waiter realized that only half the table got their order. Waited a few more minutes to get our plates. I had the bacon-bacon cheeseburger. There's nothing I love more than a good classic. This was the complete opposite. Bacon was BURNT to a black strip of what had appeared to be bacon. I almost cried for the bacon abuse! Started conversing with everyone else and their thoughts about their meal. Not a single dish was really worth the cost nor taking more than a couple of bites worth and feeling sick. Fries were salty as BLEEP! Had a glob of what appeared to be the 2 different cheeses on top of my burger. The special sauce really isn't a sauce, but more like some random ingredients pureed to a disgusting blob on the bottom of my burger. Everyone pushed their plates aside and waited, for what seemed like an eternity for our waiter to return. Ordered some deserts and was hoping at this time in the night that our horrid experience would make a turn for the better. Was let down yet again, and wasn't surprised. A hot fudge brownie sundae was ordered, was nothing more than some mere few pieces of brownie (that tasted old) and ice cream with-get this-Hershey's chocolate syrup that was cold served up. Whip cream? More like whipped milk! Even their so called famous cheesecakes were a joke! Over sugary, old, hard as a rock icing, thrown together mess of a desert better describes it! I would have had better chances eating at Chipotle's and chance getting Ebola or salmonella than going back to this place!"
Travis D.,"Minneapolis, MN",69,100,41,5.0,2/19/2014,"I was so glad to finally be able to eat at the Cheesecake Factory! I had stopped in a few times to just get cheesecake, and was definitely not disappointed!  -the red velvet is my favorite, by the way- I went with four friends, and none of us had been here before and it was amazing!  I had the Chicken Madeira, and loved every bit of it! It's highly recommended!  I cannot wait to go back again!!"
Mickey C.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,1,1.0,1/1/2016,"PLEASE READ: AN HONEST AND IMPORTANT REVIEW!!!! I have never, in all my years, had as horrible of an experience in a restaurant as today. The female manger was completely rude and unprofessional and our food arrived far beyond late. I live in California and came to Minnesota to spend the holidays with my family. Needless to say, our time was rather precious, so imagine our huge disappointment with the atrocious service we received. Sit tight because there is quite a story to tell! First off, our server was a really nice guy, but he did put in the order for our appetizers late. We get it, it's New Year's Day, it's going to be crowded, but after waiting for an hour to get our table, we were not expecting this.  Even with the late order, the appetizers arrived exactly 50 minutes after ordering. Our appetizers not only took this long, but came one by one! Our first appetizer (the avocado egg rolls) was brought by a man who, after hearing about how long we waited, rudely responded by saying ""do you want it or not"". Our appetizers soon followed after 2 hours dedicated all to this restaurant. Oh yeah, the food! The two tables sitting next to us all received their food even after coming at least twenty minutes after us. One of our family members had to leave because he had to work!!! Our food came and it was fine, but at this point, we lost our appetite honestly. The manger, Jennifer, was INCREDIBLY RUDE. She took two appetizers off out of an order from a group of seven people and made far too many rude comments. She said that she would take care of the food of my family member, but we didn't realize she would take it off completely! When we asked to order it, she said that she would have to charge us. Really?!? He left because we had waited far more than an hour, and know we have to pay?! At this point, we were livid and wished to speak to the general manager. As Jennifer left, she said that she had been here for 12 years and was experienced for the job. She has been here for 12 years; that doesn't mean they were good years! Absolutely horrible. Anyway, in short, the general manager came, but none of the ""reductions"" could fix this horrible experience. I will certainly be contacting the main facility as this was beyond absurd. The food was fine, but the process to get it was beyond crazy. The manager was absolutely rude and the length for food arrival was absurd. On a side note, the general manger was nice (he came after Jennifer) and did compensate us, but like I said, this was a horrible evening all together!"
Andrew O.,"La Crosse, WI",7,4,1,1.0,4/23/2016,"The food is always on par! They try to do the best they can to feed a person with quality 5 star food. The seating issue and not having a reservation system at all times is ridiculous and such a cry for help for a restaurant that has maybe 100 tables and is one level unlike most Cheesecake Factory restaurants. They have people waiting for an hour or two for a table when they wouldn't have angry customers if they did reservations. For a restaurant that is as popular as it is and has the patronage that it does, it does not go anywhere near 5 stars on seating and wait times. And their hosts or hostesses are horrible at giving good time frames according to tables leaving and such. For the Twin Cities Cheesecake Factory, they have two issues that need to be resolved...a fully active reservation system with better seating arrangement with the strong thought of expanding! Also, either expanding the one restaurant or building one or two more in a metropolitan area this size!"
Katie K.,"Saint Paul, MN",65,21,,5.0,4/14/2015,"This is definitely a beautiful place inside and out. This place is great for large groups and a place to take people from out of town. The service is always outstanding. They have something for everyone but on downside to that the menu can be overwhelming it is actually a book. Great happy hour specials on apps and drinks. This is definitely a place that I will always go back to. Avocado Eggroles, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and Dulce De lecha Carmel Cheesecake, so so good, and Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake I don't really even like bananas but the banana is not overpowering. Very good. I have also been wanting to try breakfast/brunch I bet it will be awesome."
Whitney G.,"South St. Paul, MN",128,407,56,3.0,6/8/2014,"I know this is a chain, so forgive me since this is the only one in the Twin Cities.  This location is adorable and classy on the inside.  I will say that they don't take reservations for large groups and it can be difficult trying to squeeze everyone in (we ended up being split into adjacent booths).  I prefer heading in for lunch, but not always in the area to do so. The cheesecake is pretty badass."
Alexander M.,"Minneapolis, MN",5,72,5,2.0,2/7/2015,"I get that the identity is their cheesecake, but the pasta tasted like play-dough covered in salt sauce. I vowed never to eat here again but I keep getting pulled back in by someone craving cheesecake, and even when I try to explain that their cheesecake is average, they don't listen! Seriously most of the variations of cheesecake they have are just gross and excessive, even the standard is nothing special."
Rachel P.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,26,6,2.0,2/15/2014,"I'm reviewing purchasing cheesecake to go from the counter.  I have eaten here before, but I hate the food.  Everything I've ordered has been terrible.  I think they should stick to cheesecake, but anyways... on to my actual review. I've ordered cheesecake several times to go from here.  Cheesecake is good, and the Cheesecake Factory does it best (most of the time).  I picked up two pieces for Valentine's Day - Cookie Dough and Kahlua.  One old favorite and one new flavor, which is how we generally do Cheesecake Factory takeouts.  The Cookie Dough we had tried before and LOVED.  This time, it had walnuts all over the top.  We do not recall that from last time, and for me walnuts kill it.  I thought it was actually nasty with nuts on it.  Very disappointing.  The Kahlua was good though.  Cookie Dough I'll never order again now. The biggest downfall this time was that I left with two very small slices of cheesecake and spent $18.  They've halved their slices and increased the price.  They have good cheesecake, sure, but they are bordering on robbery at this point.  It ain't THAT good, guys.  Maybe tone down the ripoff factor before you're charging 20 bucks per chew."
Andy M.,"Edina, MN",5,27,31,3.0,11/30/2013,"Emphasis was on ""Factory"" that night (11/26), especially with a party of 8.  It started off odd. We had been told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. We were standing around (all seats/benches occupied with other wanna-be diners) for about 5 minutes when the pager went off. Excited that the wait was shorter, I showed others in our party and turned around to the host stand. Some host/manager guy said, hey, it's going to be about 15-20 minutes. I didn't know how to process the information, so I just said, ""um, yeah, you already told us that."" I thought about it and the people behind me that thought we were going to sit down and said, ""really, you paged me over here to tell me that? I thought our table was ready."" If it was a huge change in wait, I could see that, but it was more just odd. The food was mostly well-prepared, but the service was uneven. Any time you have people at the table going, ""oh, you guys go ahead and eat,"" you know there's trouble because enough time has elapsed that everyone's wondering where everyone else's meals are. There was about 5-10 minutes between the first plate and the last plate getting laid down. And no, no one ordered anything unusual or wanted special modifications. It was a weird night service-wise. The server was very personable and attentive at the table, but it took a while for drinks and bread, then we'd have these gaps of time where we wouldn't see him for a while. Their drink menu has a section of martinis - but none of the drinks on it are martinis, they're just these weird made-up sugary concoctions of bizarre flavor combinations. There was - honest to God - not a single martini on the page. I had to manually order a martini, specify an actual gin, and ask for olives. Sheesh! And it basically sucked. I hate that word, but it fits in this case. Made me feel like a idiot even ordering it. Oh well. Oh well, and about the menus, this is rich. These guys are so hard up for money, that they actually put ads for other stuff inside their menu. Not some food tie-in, just other stores at the mall (Southdale). So while I'm looking over the ridiculous non-martini Martini section, on the opposite page, I have some model leering at me with tacky-looking jewelry from some store in the mall. Ha! Another pet peeve - I ordered one of their burgers with fries. The fries came in a little metal bucket with a paper liner. The fries were just luke warm. Everyone that wanted to try one did what I did - ate 1-2, then no more. They're just gross when they're not hot. Oh, and if you're serving a burger with fries, you bring ketchup. Don't make me ask for it. That's another few minutes of waiting right there. They didn't even bring a bottle, just a little dressing bowl with a dollop of ketchup in it. Boo! Okay, soapbox mode off, but it was a strange dining experience. Oh, and yes, they do serve cheesecake."
Marisa P.,"Minneapolis, MN",193,91,52,5.0,12/4/2013,"I guess you could say I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory. I have never had anything here I didn't like. Their menu is a little out of control with all the options, but everyone should be able to find something they want.  The wait staff is great, they have always been very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable of the 20 page menu.  The food is always fantastic, and you can't leave without a piece of their cheesecake. If you like chocolate, I would suggest the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, it's like having chocolate silk in your mouth.   Parking at Southdale is annoying, and sometimes you have to wait, a long time, but if you plan it right and don't come during busy times, you'll be seated right away."
Jolene j.,"Watervliet, NY",50,2,,1.0,2/1/2016,I ordered the pear and endive salad with NO blue cheese to pick up. When I got home it had blue cheese all over it. My husband drove back to get a new salad with no blue cheese. I was so disappointed. The chicken was cold and tasted like it was out of a can and the pears were soggy and also out of a can.  I can't believe I not only paid for this but drove twice to get. Horrible job Cheesecake Factory
