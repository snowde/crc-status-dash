Lee G.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,58,,2.0,10/2/2015,"You get 2 stars just because of lunch price. I ordered a lunch salad and pop.  Cost me $22 with tip.  Really?  I just think you need reasonable lunch prices.  I asked waiter and was told there was even a bigger salad served at dinner.  What?  That salad I received was big enough for 2 people that I was served.  Let's be serious about portions Cheesecake Factory.  No room for cheesecake with those size portions. For lunch hour, I should have left paying no more than $15 with tip for a simple salad w/a little chicken on it. ugh."
Jordan M.,"Hugo, MN",6,9,,3.0,12/29/2014,They have great desserts which most people know about. Beyond that there is not much to venture out for. The place is loud and difficult to hold a conversation.
Helen K.,"Lakeville, MN",0,9,,1.0,8/4/2015,"Took a family group of 12 there, spent a lot of money only to find that 2 gift cards that had been purchased at Target as wedding gifts for us had been hacked for $11.xx each.  Asked the manager to make good on it and he wouldn't.  Their cards are being hacked at point of sale places and they won't honor it or make them less hackable?... won't go there again.... or buy their gift cards.!  AND THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS... WTH!!!"
Mollee F.,"Chaska, MN",80,191,,4.0,3/17/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has been around forever, and yet, is still popular enough to encounter a 40-minute wait at 1:45 p.m. on a Saturday. Crazy.  I usually dodge requests to go to the Cheesecake Factory because I've never not encountered a wait, but I relented over the weekend. The upside to waiting is that you can head into the mall and do some shopping as you wait for a table to open up. The buzzer won't work, but staff are good about letting you know an appropriate time frame for coming back.  The menu here is just obscenely huge. Whatever you're hungry for, they probably have it. I ordered just a basic hamburger and was pleasantly surprised by how perfect it was. No frills, just cooked to order and tasty.  My dining partner got the club sandwich and was also happy with her order. We split a piece of white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for dessert and while it had an excessive amount of whipped cream decorating the top, it was delicious.  Wait staff here are very good - attentive and friendly. If this place took reservations, I wouldn't hesitate to head back soon."

CliffordJayson C.,"Singapore, Singapore",0,38,17,3.0,7/21/2015,The pasta are nice. My friends took steaks and they finish it flawlessly so its good. The staff are very nice but it took long timw to cook the dinner. Outside placr are quite a lot of flies.
Lina H.,"Rochester, NY",445,173,548,4.0,4/15/2012,"If you're looking for a place that is open after midnight then you found it. Yea, I was surprise too! They are open till 12:30am on fri and sat.. regular days till 10pm I admit, I'm a fan of this chain. the service is always satisfactory and the price is very reasonable. Because this is the only cheesecake factory in the state of minnesota, it's always busy. Expect to wait 40 mins during dinner hrs BUT only 10 mins during the late weekend. Like I've mentioned on my tip, I'm a devoted  lover of their Fettuccini Alfredo w/ chicken. I've been ordering the same dish for the past 12 years. It's so rich in cream and the sun dried tomatoes definitely adds a zest to the taste. I also would recommend their miso salmon- the glazed salmon and rice goes perfect together. i tried to mimic their garlic noodles at home- mission failed. I'll stick to ordering from cheesecake instead. as far as cheesecake goes, i like their white chocolate truffle and the Oreo one is great too.... but if you like red velvet like i do, skip the cheesecake and go for the ultimate red velvet cake instead!"
Louise L.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,13,19,5.0,4/13/2016,"I only ate there once, and I enjoyed it very much! But I mostly do cheesecake to-go line. And I always enjoy buying it from them, the staff's are wonderful at the register. So I can't say more about the food area, but I know that the line is a long Waite."
Sumit S.,"New York, NY",1,3,4,3.0,5/11/2015,"I didn't realize the big menu and took me awhile to read through the ingredients. Finally settled with Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. I don't think I am ordering that again, nothing wow about it. My friend had spicy cashew chicken which was good but still plain. I have been there few times but I love their cheesecakes, they don't fail to amaze me."
Karen R.,"Stillwater, MN",0,7,,3.0,4/3/2016,"Lots of Choices;Lots of customers! Food was okay. Like the healthy salad options. Sent fries back because they were so salty we couldn't eat them. Took forever to get a new order. Would love to see vegan cheesecake offered made with cashews. Most food has cheese or cow's milk or cheese involved, so if you are dairy intolerant or allergic, it is challenging to find a food choice."
Eswar P.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,1,,1.0,4/1/2016,"Food was OK, but service was very bad. I would not recommend unless you wanted to buy cheesecakes."
Steven B.,"Eden Prairie, MN",1,8,,5.0,3/6/2015,"Excellent quick bite to eat. Awesome food and excellent service.  We had an app, two small plates dining in and cheesecake to go!"
Tara B.,"Minneapolis, MN",31,8,9,2.0,12/12/2014,"Curbside pickup to go service is horrible! I love the food at the CCF. Decided to try their curbside to go since we had two kids in the car and couldn't wait for an hour for table service. I called them an hour in advance to put in my order. It rang 100 times with no answer. Called back, same thing. Called back again,she picked up and said ""let me transfer you to the bakery"". Then it rang another 100 times with no answer. Called again, finally got someone. Placed the order for an hour later. When we arrived at the exact appointed time, I called the special number again with no answer! Called again as I was angrily walking inside to get the order myself, then someone finally picked up. They told me my order wouldn't be ready for another 5-10 minutes! Aaarrrgg! I may give this another shot and hope it's just a fluke but be forewarned."
Lisa M.,"Saint Paul, MN",99,470,221,2.0,6/7/2011,"I can't even believe I went here.  I was at the movies with some friends and we wanted lunch. Walked in around 1:30ish on a Saturday, it was very quiet.  I hadn't been there in years and now I know why - to me, it's nothing special. I wonder who would wait for a while to get a table, but then I realized it takes so long to even get a grasp on the menu.  We were seated at a fairly large table, which was good and we ordered some drinks, which came fairly quick. What isn't quick is trying to decide what to have. The damn menu is just too big! Do I want a regular sized salad, an appetizer size salad, or a salad and something combo? Do I want an appetizer or a small plate? Ahhh. Too many decisions.  I settled on a Coors Light, a small arugula salad, and a sausage and ricotta pizette. Our group ordered various items and I can say for sure, the fried mac and cheese balls (I know, what am I eating those for?) with marinara were the best thing we had. I had 1/4 of the large ball and that was enough. My salad and pizette were the perfect size for me considering the pizza and salad combo was gigantic.  My bill was around $16 for the beer and snacks. I thought the price was fine, I guess I'm just not crazy about the place.  The service was good, she was pleasant enough, but a little hover-y, the price was right, although I'm not sure a Coors Light bottle should be $4.75, the menu too big and nothing is spectacular. I would not go back if given the choice.  PS - I don't really like cheesecake, so I didn't even try it,"
Evan D.,"Osseo, MN",0,4,1,4.0,11/4/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is really good! I love the Four Cheese Pasta. It has all these different cheeses in a pinkish sauce with penne. Then there's ricotta cheese in the middle. It was AMAZING. Literally. The service is very good but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the wait. Didn't expect a table right away and I guess for this restaurant 1 hour 10 minutes isn't that long. The cheesecake is really good, and I don't even like cheesecake. Very good for birthdays or special occasions."
Joshua W.,"Fargo, ND",0,8,,5.0,5/8/2015,"Great restaurant, great service, and great food! Everything on their menu has been awesome that I have tried, particularly their burgers and fish and chips. The burgers are cooked perfectly and had great toppings on them, my personal favorites are the mac and cheese burger and the americana burger.... their BBQ ranch sauce is awesome as well!  Cheesecakes: gotta try the red velvet and the white chocolate blueberry..... oh and also the caramel apple streusel! Service was fantastic, the two waitresses I had were Brittany and Kelsey and they were both very friendly, helpful, and attentive. Overall, probably my favorite restaurant I have ever eaten at."
Tamera B.,"Plano, TX",196,214,174,2.0,6/18/2013,"We're from Chicago and visited Minneapolis for Father's Day weekend. My husband and I couldn't agree on a ""new"" restaurant to try, so we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory because in Chicago it's always a solid choice; food is always good and you know what you're getting. Sadly, this wasn't the case at this location. We ate here twice on this trip and we were disappointed both times.  The first meal was dinner. I ordered the Ne Orleans Shrimp, which is a dish I've had frequently at Cheesecake Factory's all around the country. On this particular occasion, it was cooked with the wrong sauce (it was yellow) and it had a curry-like taste to it. This ruined my entire meal and it was really late, so I didn't have the energy to complain and wait for a new meal to be prepared. The next meal we had here was brunch on Father's Day. We ate here mostly be use of convenience. Every other restaurant had a long wait and we were trying to make it to the Twins game. Anyway, my husband ordered egg whites, ham, and toast. My son's ordered ""crispy"" bacon with their meals. So, all of the food came out except my husband's. The waitress said that the cook forgot to only cook egg whites. So, about 7 minutes later, my husband gets his food with steaming hot eggs and cold meat and toast........yummy!!! Next, they only brought bacon for one of my sons and it was no where near crispy. We requested crispy bacon again and the waitress attempted to take my 4 year olds entire plate of pancakes back to the kitchen, just to get crispy bacon. The distraught look on his face was all she needed to sit the plate back down and she said she would just bring a side of bacon. So, she shows up about 1 minute later with some COLD crispy bacon. I imagine this was pre cooked bacon used to top salads and/or soups, because it obviously wasn't cooked that fast. We were tired of going back and forth an my son starting eating it so we just left it alone. My other son's bacon was never brought out, but we just told our waitress to take it off the check. So........on future trips to Minneapolis, we now know that Cheesecake Factory IS NOT an option and we would NOT recommend this place to anyone. PAY ATTENTION TO THE LOW STAR RATING ON YELP!!!!"
John G.,"Saint Michael, MN",0,1,,1.0,3/5/2016,"Worst lunch experience ever!  Taking my family out for my daughters birthday.  Two meals out of four were brought out. 10 minutes later the third. My wife's lunch never arrived. The waitress apologized but was unable to get her lunch. I spoke to the manager about it and after another 15 minutes he brought her lunch. When we told him to just box it up since we were out of time, he gave an eye roll which was even more irritating. Will not EVER go back to this place.  JG"
Michael K.,"Seattle, WA",299,631,40,4.0,12/12/2012,"I know and understand the complaints about the Cheesecake Factory and the fact that this restaurant is trying to cater to Edina residents with its' decor while catering to the Sumo Federation of America with its' portions, I really can't complain based on the fact that huge portions make me happy.  It's overwhelming to look through the menu with no idea what you're feeling like so I would suggest picking a genre of food before showing up or you may find yourself in desperate tears while the waitress looks at you with a knowing condescension.   It really is lovely inside and the food is better than PF Changs.   What - it is."
Matthew K.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,17,,1.0,7/9/2014,"The first time I came here, I was blown away. The menu is huge, there are endless choices, and they really live up to the cheesecake part of the name with a wide selection of expensive slices. Unfortunately, they also live up the ""factory"" part of the name, which is really not a good thing. Their portions are generally large, which is sometimes a good thing, and other times you wonder how you are going to get rid of a plate full of subpar, bland food. If you plan on drinking, make sure to ask for prices. They don't have a price list, but they will ""guess"" how much each drink is. Mixed drinks run around $10 and up (and aren't very impressive), and beer runs around $5. Happy hour is only at the bar.  I also feel it's my civic duty to warn any non-meat eaters: STAY AWAY! I have had meat in my meatless dishes not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. Each time, staff was apathetic. The first time, there was chicken (small shreds, everywhere, so at first it wasn't completely apparent) in a non-chicken fettuccine. The manager came over and said, ""oh, well, someone in the kitchen must have used the same tongs for chicken as they did for the pasta."" Basically, he shrugged it off, didn't offer to replace our dinner OR compensate us, and said, NO BIG DEAL. JUST CROSS-CONTAMINATION IN OUR KITCHEN.  Actually, it is a big deal, and it literally made me sick. I had to email the company and they gave me a gift card, which I used to buy their portabella and zucchini fries. Nearing the bottom of the batch, I poured them out and found, guess what? FRIED CHICKEN SKIN. I gave one to a meat-eating friend to verify, and she said it was definitely chicken. I had to stop there and laugh, but I also quickly got the check and got the hell out. I really want to love this place. It has so much potential, but between the apathetic staff, the long waits, and the subpar food, there isn't a whole lot to love. Not to mention the whole cross-contamination problem, which for some reason doesn't seem to phase the managers or servers. To be honest, the only saving grace of this place is their bread baskets. Seriously, so good, and so far I haven't found any meat lurking at the bottom."
