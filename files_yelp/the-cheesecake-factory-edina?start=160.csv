Kimberly B.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,3,,3.0,3/18/2015,"We were sat within 5 minutes which is quick for a table of 6. We had two small children with us, and we had to ask our server for the children's menu rather than him asking us if we needed children's menus. The food was alright but nothing outstanding. The cheesecake was delicious as always."
Jason N.,"Shakopee, MN",31,79,2,5.0,6/21/2013,Lots of food for the price and friendly service.  A young adult hangout spot that isnt in minneapolis. Ive had a ton of stuff on the menu and its always great. Get here early on friday or saturday nights. Waits can sometimes be 1-2 hrs.
Amanda S.,"Minneapolis, MN",5,27,,2.0,5/29/2013,"Went here for date night. Partially because it was only 1 of 2 places we could actually find in a mall over-run with people just 'hanging out' before seeing the new Star Trek movie (Awesome). Place was packed so we sat at the bar, next to a 3 year old. Is that even legal? Maddie and Tasha were very attentive and chatty, probably because they were 2 of 5 employees behind the bar. Drinks were reasonable but found the food nominal and over priced. Overall it would have been a better deal to stick to my neighborhood places (I live in downtown Minneapolis) but they closed the movie theater in Block E."
Eric S.,"Waldorf, MD",23,96,68,5.0,6/19/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. What more needs to be said?! Realistically, it's probably only a 4-star joint, but because my wife and I live in Fargo now we have to drive all the way here for a Cheesecake Factory or P.F. Changs. We miss living in a real city, and this place makes our visits all the more special."
Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",89,315,21,4.0,5/27/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. If you've never been to one, the menu is a bit intimidating with its large selection, but I enjoy this restaurant. The service has been consistently good. The portions are large, so you'll either be having leftovers or sharing. The food is pretty tasty and of course, you probably should have dessert if you are treating yourself to this restaurant anyway."
Doug G.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,19,6,2.0,8/18/2015,"Way to expensive! $8 for a slice. Cafe latte in St. Paul has better taste and half the price!  Slow service, ordered 2 slices to go and wAited over 30 minutes to get served.  Should of went to Cossettas...."
Lindsay H.,"San Diego, CA",67,258,2,5.0,2/9/2013,"A restaurant chain I would probably never have intentionally walked into to have dinner at back home in Cali..... became my birthday dinner spot.  I hear this is the only Cheesecake Factory in Minneapolis?  Or.. Minnesota??!!! Well, nonetheless, I had a great meal!  I had their chicken something... it was crispy on the outside and served with asparagus and mashed potatoes!!  The mashed potatoes were my fave and their rye bread, of course! One of my friends ordered the kobe burger, but since they cooked it wrong, it took another 15 minutes or more for her dish to come out.  The rest of us were almost done by then.  The manager was extremely kind though.  He came out himself to apologize and made sure that her meal was on the house and a free cheesecake too. For a ""family restaurant"" though, I found it a little awkward how they were playing baby-making music when the restaurant already had some dim lighting........  Haha Had a great meal."
Denise D.,"Minneapolis, MN",19,27,,2.0,8/7/2012,"I went here for dinner with my boyfriend tonight.  It's always so busy when I go there and this was no exception.  There wasn't a wait to get seated which was nice, but it was so loud inside.   I ordered the arugala salad and fried zucchini.  While waiting for our food, we both noticed how incredibly cold it is inside.  We were hoping our server would offer us a blanket with our meals.  No such luck.   My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and fries and our server said his fries would just be a minute.  He was half done with his meal by the time the fries came.  My salad was delicious.  It had raisins, almonds, and lemon.  It was really zesty and yummy.  The fried zucchini was alright but I couldn't eat very many of them.  These would be better shared with a group.  You get around 9 pieces, each about the size of a wedge cut fry.   The fries that the boyfriend ordered were extremely salty.  I tried the fries and I could only eat two, and that's not like me.  I tried to wipe off the salt, but they were still too salty to eat.   All in all, this wasn't my favorite visit here.  Next time I'll stick with what I truly went there for - the cheesecake!"
Johnny P.,"Maple Grove, MN",1,127,,4.0,1/30/2013,"I am a gluttonous man and I don't care if you judge me. Bring out an extra biscuit, because I will mop up the gravy all day long. It's not chalked full of character here, but you get consistently good food and service. The food is high quality and the restaurant is clean. Those two things alone put this restaurant in a very elite category.  Great variety on the menu and awesome desserts. The only negative is the wait... They could build  second Cheesecake Factory next door and you'd still have an hour wait on a Tuesday night. Otherwise, we love this place."
Karen H.,"Minneapolis, MN",29,147,27,4.0,8/2/2014,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday evening in July. They quoted a 45 min wait time, but we were seated in about 20 mins. Waiter was friendly and very efficient. Love their bread-- definitely one of the highlights of coming here. Split a pasta with my mom, hubby got the Cajun pasta and I snuck many bites of mac and cheese from my 6 yr old's bowl. Ordered a couple of slices of cheesecake to share for dessert and we had enough to bring some home. Had the s'mores cheesecake (soooooo sinful) and the traditional fresh strawberry cheesecake. Overall, a good experience at this chain restaurant."
Mere W.,"Minneapolis, MN",37,172,12,2.0,4/12/2012,"Sigh.  Yes, the cheesecake factory has the largest menu in the Twin Cities.  It is probably a great spot to go if you have a group of people that all want different cuisine.  You can get breakfast, Mexican, Asian, burgers, and pasta all at the same place.  However, the food is only okay.  And the wait is worse!  They do not take reservations and the wait times are crazy.  Furthermore, I have never had good luck with the hostesses.  They always seem really annoyed to be working that particular day.   I will not deny that the cheesecake is huge.  They do have a take-out counter specifically for the cheesecake.  I say use that counter if you must and otherwise try to avoid the wait times here.  There are so many other unique and delicious spots in the Twin Cities - go to these spots!"
Montessahall H.,"Paris, France",12,165,2,1.0,3/18/2014,"There are several entrees that are worth the trip on the menu. However, overall presentation leaves a lot to be desired.  Hot entrees are consistently served at room temperature.  Sometimes if you are lucky parts of your entree may be hot while other parts are not. It doesn't seem to matter if one complains to the manager. This restaurant really operates like a ""factory"""
Monica B.,"St Paul, MN",4,47,1,2.0,1/25/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, I absolutely love it.. BUT--I hate that it is a 50-50 chance that i will get bad service when I go. I have never gone twice in a row and had good service both times... NEVER. This visit the waitress just seemed to be sidetracked. I dont know if she was close to getting off or what, (or maybe she was just an airhead) but we had to repeat EVERYTHING we said, because she was never paying attention. I asked her if the Mac and Cheese was baked, she didnt know, so i told her that if it was, and if it came with Bacon (because it usually does when its baked) to leave the bacon off. 10-15 minutes later, a chef brings me out Mac and cheese.. and annouces they removed the ""breadcrumbs"" as i requested!! What? no, no i wanted my breadcrumbs!!!  At this point i was so hungry i was just like screw it, so i didnt even ask if they could fix it. I just hate going here not knowing what/who i will get. And its the only one in the tri state area i think, so im out of other options when it comes down to it"
Sue T.,"Toronto, Canada",2,23,2,4.0,8/13/2014,The food is delicious and the staff are generally nice. We noticed that they don't employ only young kids which is a nice change. The older waitress we had was fantastic. Very polite and engaging. The food was so good and then choices were endless. Ive been there twice and have yet to be disappointed with my choices. The only problem..which isn't really much of a problem is that they don't have WiFi.
Katie R.,"Stoughton, WI",50,129,,4.0,7/19/2014,Mmmmmmmmmm.   Very tasty.  Good service.   The kids were all over it.   We all had pasta.  So good!  And yummy warm bread before our meal. Tasty!!!!
Jane E.,"Boston, MA",3,437,32,3.0,8/24/2012,"Oh my god all I can say is portion size and menu!!!  It took me more than 30 minutes to get through the menu and then I had no clue what I wanted.  Its massive - review it online ahead of time. The food when it arrived was ginormous.  I swear that the two entrees we ordered would have served up to six family members.  I got a chicken parmesan sandwich and it was so large that it seemed like six sandwiches in one.  The other speciality dish had four chicken breasts!!! If you go, do not order more than one entree for two people.  If you are big, then go for it. Also, please please try the red velvet cheesecake.  If there is a heaven then it is that cake.  You may reach heaven soon after eating it too, but it was amazing. I will likely not go again as it is not my type of place.  But for the cheesecake I will be back."
Diane G.,"Belle Plaine, MN",1,3,,1.0,6/29/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory USED TO BE a great place to eat.  We loved the large portions, great food, and cool atmosphere.  The decor was fun to look at.  The service was very good and snappy.  The food was simply delicious.   But in the last 3 years; my husband and I have been watching this restaurant go downhill in its cleanliness dept. My husband, my daughter and I went back last night 6/28/13 in hopes ""maybe"" they have pulled it together but, nope... it's become worse.  We were seated and could not help but notice (from sliding) that the floors were filthy and greasy, the tables and booths same thing (food dropped from someone previous down below our table) and that's when we really started to check things out... The drinking glasses were even dirty!  They brought our food out all at separate times, gave me the wrong Ribeye steak (dry/over-cooked) and by the time we were done; we decided that it will be our very last time at the Cheesecake Factory which is sad because we used to LOVE this place. I am sorry, but Mc D's is cleaner then this place and if I am going to pay a pretty penny to eat out at a semi-fancy restaurant, I want to know that the cleanness is priority on their list. If this is how the outer part of the restaurant looks, I sure don't even want to imagine what their kitchen looks like."
Claire B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,1,,4.0,9/20/2014,Their corn cakes are delicious--flavorful and soothing at the same time.  My favorite dish here.  I actually craze it sometimes. I also have enjoyed their lettuce wraps. Service on the slow side.
CJ T.,"Sioux Falls, SD",3,31,,3.0,2/18/2013,"I've been a fan since 1990, but, this time was slightly disappointing for me.  I had the Sunday Brunch Green chile carna(something or other).  The pork was extremely dry and the tortilla chips were all soggy when the dish arrived at my table.  I was hungry so I ate a bit of it and decided to just save room for the good stuff!  I had the Adams special cheesecake (Peanut butter cups/Butterfinger/OMG). The waitress was super sweet, attentive and got a nice tip out of it!"
John R.,"Winnipeg, Canada",21,448,137,4.0,10/2/2012,"OK better server, still good food and finally got to try the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake, it was worth all the guilt people get around food.  We will come back another time"
