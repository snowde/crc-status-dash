Danielle G.,"St Paul, MN",15,80,29,4.0,5/11/2014,"Food is generally good, portions are HUGE so plan to either be super full, have leftovers, or share a dish between 2 (or 3) people!  The happy hour is amazing though!  Tons of great food dishes for $5 as well as drinks and beer specials.  Love it!  I get super full for $10."
Dwight C.,"Minneapolis, MN",76,106,4,3.0,1/7/2014,"This place is a gold mine. It's alway busy and the wait is always 20-30 minutes. If your prepared for that then fine..if not..your experience will not be the same. I think there menu is way to large with way to many choices...but when you get the food...all is well. Wait staff at times can be very inattentive and overwhelmed with the number of tables they serve. I'd go back, but at an earlier time of the day."
Cari S.,"Onalaska, WI",0,3,,4.0,8/31/2014,This place was hoppin' at 9:30 pm on Saturday! We had a 20 minute wait but it was worth it! Large portions and delicious food. Took cheesecake to go. Yum!
Kade K.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,110,106,2.0,1/20/2014,"Their menu has everything. You have a friend that only eats pasta and one that only eats burgers and one that only eats eggs? Cool, go to The Cheesecake Factory! However, you probably shouldn't go if you have a friend that doesn't eat meat, because some might sneak in, no matter what they order... Also don't plan on coming here for drinks unless you have A LOT of money to spend, because they will not give you the prices."
Stephen L.,"San Diego, CA",1,28,3,4.0,6/3/2014,"Went for late dinner (after 9pm).  Hostess was welcoming and friendly.  I sat at booth in bar area.  Server (Amber) was attentive, and order was prompt and accurate.  Food was very good and drink was refilled before running out.  Bill was brought at appropriate time and was quickly processed.  Great experience, no complaints."
Kelly P.,"Rochester, MN",0,23,7,3.0,1/3/2016,"Food is always good and they have big portions and love their cheesecakes. But me and my boyfriend came in a Saturday knowing there would be a wait, so we came at 5pm. We were told that the wait was going to be 1 hour and 10 minutes, which we were fine with waiting. After waiting 1 hour and 35 minutes I decided to check to see where we were on the list (which I never like to be the person that always does that) and the girl looked at our pager number and looked on the computer and told us we were next up. So we stood closer to the host desk, so we were ready to go. After a table of 5, then a table of 2, then a table of 3, then another table of 2 got seated, I was getting confused and annoyed. I asked a different person why we haven't been seated and that we've been waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes at this point when we were told it would only be 1 hour and 10 minutes and he quickly sat us and told the other hostess that the pager wasn't ever working. While we were waiting, we saw the hostess sometime go out and call for peoples name and we have never heard our named called, even when we were told that we were next up. So I wasn't furious for waiting that long, I was furious that they gave us a pager that didn't work and didn't attempt to call our name. After we got seated, I assumed that someone told them to put our orders on rush since we waited so long, because there was a couple that got seated 5 minutes after us and we had already gotten all of our good before they received their appetizers. We felt rushed to eat our 2 appetizers to have room for our entrees. Other than one bad experience, the servers are always friendly and the food is always good."
Raedean F.,"Minneapolis, MN",29,82,3,3.0,8/14/2012,"I enjoy cheesecake and I can always get a good piece from the Cheesecake Factory.   The menu is HUGE but each item I've ever tried I really like.  I recently had the Skinny Shrimp Tacos and they were A+++ w/a little spice :) My server was knowledgeable and friendly!  Her recommendation on the Asian Pear Martini was stellar!  Because it's located in the mall, you have to deal with mall parking."
Rachel S.,"Otsego, MN",7,160,106,4.0,5/11/2012,"If I want to be sure I really enjoy everything about my meal and my experience I go here. I don't even hesitate to bring friends and family because I am confident it will be terrific.  Why only 4 stars?  Almost always a ridiculous wait, they took my favorite dish off the menu, the portions are extreme. Pretty small list compared to all the things they've done fabulously every time I have visited."
Jacqui L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",201,173,420,4.0,6/23/2011,I refuse to write a review about the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake Or the Mango-Key Lime Cheesecake Or the Lemoncello Cream Torte Or the Red Velvet Cheesecake Or the Warm Apple Crisp Or the Strawberry Shortcake Or the Black-Out Cake  Or the Kahlua® Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake Or the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake Doing so would be like admitting I've tried every single one of these desserts....and that's just not going to happen (again!) - bbuuuuurrrrrp!
Leigh G.,"Saint Paul, MN",20,57,,1.0,2/28/2011,"The portion sizes here are insane. You could feel your whole family with one dish. Instead of a menu they give you a book. Anything you can think of they probably serve, but its all pretty lame and over-priced. The decor is hideous. Some things look like they are trying to be Egyptian, other things look kind of Roman, and the light fixtures look like the eye from Lord of the Rings. Maybe they wanted the design to match the menu- lots of random stuff thrown together but none of it done particularly well.  All dinner I was looking forward to the cheesecake. Since its in the name I figured it had to be good. I went with the classic cheesecake with strawberries on top. It was ok but nothing to write home about.  To be fair, I'm not a big fan of huge chain restaurants so if thats your thing you may like it here. I for one won't be back."
Cindy D.,"Minneapolis, MN",215,321,1835,5.0,8/11/2011,Absolutely my favorite place! I had my bday there many years ago. I love all their appetizers! Amazing cheesecake! I know they don't take reservations after a certain time on weekdays or weekends....i waited for an an hour one time and i didnt mind at all because i was craving for their food! They have the best long island!
Ashley F.,"Minneapolis, MN",191,388,34,3.0,7/8/2011,"I am almost embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed my experience eating at the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered a Southwestern salad, and it was really good.  That said, lower your prices, you are The Cheesecake Factory, and $8 for one slice of semi-decent cheesecake is highway robbery. Also, $9 for my glass of Sangria? You are The Cheesecake Factory. So much botox in this place that I felt I like I got botox by association."
Julie R.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,15,1,2.0,3/27/2011,"I wasn't very excited to try this place, but I wondered what all the rage was about.  When I got to the restaurant we were asked to wait 2.5 hours!  Seriously? Who in their right mind would wait 2.5 hours to eat food that is off a Sysco truck? Ok I'm a snob, I like food that is fresh, in season, and local,  so I waited for awhile to see if a table would open up. Meanwhile I got to watch some poor girl put whip cream on nearly 30,000 cheesecakes.  I wondered if this girl would ever eat cheesecake again? Then I wondered if these cheesecakes were made on location or if it came frozen from some factory thousands of miles away? All I could wonder is why would someone be asked to wait 2.5 hours?  The greeters at the door seemed nervous that the angry hungry people waiting might create an uprising.    Sadly enough I couldn't wait 2.5 hours.  I left."
Amy B.,"Savage, MN",10,29,27,4.0,12/3/2011,"Oh my... My mouth is watering JUST by thinking of the Cheesecake variety here! Well, after all, it is The Cheesecake Factory! The times that I have been here, I have wanted to try something new... Because if you look at the menu, there are pages of delicious cheesecake for your taste buds to enjoy! That being said, I have stirred from my goal a few times... I have had Linda's Fudge Cake about 3 times. Whoops! But it is just SO good! And the last time I went there, I had the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. The slice was so big, I had to take it home! And found a couple hours later that my entire family thought it was delicious, too! My advice to those who do NOT want to share: Order, eat as much as you can, bring it home, and HIDE it very well in the refrigerator!!! Cheesecake Factory, you know how to bring a hungry customer back for more!"
Joe T.,"Saint Paul, MN",2,17,,5.0,4/17/2014,"Been here twice. Food is delicious, service was okay, price hurt my wallet. Had standard food like the filet mignon, chicken alfredo, salmon, lasagna, mozzarella sticks. The filet mignon was the best I ever had. I would go again."
Ia V.,"St Paul, MN",0,13,5,2.0,1/3/2013,"Dined here on 12/31/2012, for my BF's birthday!  -During lunch hour- Busy but took about 7 mins for drinks to be served and 30 mins for the entrees to come out, decent timing for service -The BF ordered the  over the top meatloaf sandwich and I ordered Evelyn's favorite Pasta -Food: Evelyn's Fav Pasta consist of Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts.  Penne Pasta was very dry! It was so clumped together..Broccoli over-cooked, Artichoke was not fresh (chef claimed to be fresh, taste like canned) and Roasted eggplant was not cooked all the way through lol..I am no Chef Ramsey but I love food and I want food to taste like it should... I received my entree and took a bite and I was disgusted, but did not want to complain to the waitress because she seemed to be having a rough day but she was really nice, waitress saw my reaction from afar and came to see what was the issue and offered to bring it back and bring out a new order but the BF and I was on a time crunch and said no thanks, minutes later ASSHOLE manager comes and tell me, ""Ma'am, I heard you don't like your entree? Now let me tell you something, I am willing to bring out you a new entree because NO MATTER WHAT, I AM GOING TO MAKE YOU PAY FOR YOUR MEAL or I can give you two slices of cheesecake on the house"" What an asshole, I was NOT looking for a free meal nor did I complain to the waitress about how dry my pasta was and how disgusting the dish was! Then I told the manager no thanks i'm in a hurry, I appreciated but if you insist I will take a house salad with vinaigrette dressing...10 mins later the same waitress comes back with the salad and APOLOGIZES for her RUDE MANAGERS behavior!  I will def come back if I get the same waitress but as for the ASSHOLE manager no thanks! I feel bad that she haves to work for someone like that!  Overall, Food was not great but will come back again to give them a redeeming chance, Service was great minus D-BAG manager."
Tina W.,"Paducah, KY",1,247,6,4.0,10/11/2013,"THE BEST chocolate cake anywhere (blackout cake).  We have had some stellar meals here, and a few screwy ones.  Overall, it's a favorite for ""special"" meals.  It's HUGE....but still be prepared to wait."
Brian K.,"Newport Beach, CA",73,15,1,4.0,11/20/2011,I had the cajun jambalaya pasta which was a phenomenal entree and for a desert the red velvet cheesecake was delicious as usual.  My favorite appetizer from any restaurant is the chicken lettuce wraps with the peanut sauce!!! I highly recommend this restaurant
Sarah S.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,107,2,3.0,2/19/2014,"An all-American chain restaurant, but it is pretty good! Huge restaurant, with large bar area and ample booth and table seating. The portions are also very large, even the lunch portions! Lunch prices are a little on the high side (including tax and tip I spent $17 for a sandwich and side salad). The cheesecake is good, and lots of choices. There's nothing unique or different about te Cheesecake Factory, so if all you need is safe, stable, good food and service and to just go on a routine out to eat lunch/dinner, this will have you covered."
Wenkai Y.,"Pittsburgh, PA",22,21,,4.0,1/8/2014,Actually their pre-meal bread is awesome. :) Cheesecake of course. Pineapple one is good.
