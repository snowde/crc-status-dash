Nicole P.,"Minneapolis, MN",70,261,61,2.0,6/29/2009,"Eh.  The cheesecake was good, we had the Turtle sunday cheesecake and it was really very creamy and nice. but expensive $7 for a slice. My boyfriend and i each had a salad, he enjoyed his (a spicy chicken avacado ranch salad)  I had a low cal salad with blue cheese, there was plenty of blue cheese (which suprised me) but i dont eat chicken so i substituted shrimp.  i got 4 shrimp, and they upcharged me $4!!!!. It's a chain and i didnt expect to be WOW'ed."
Jean R.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,66,,3.0,9/12/2009,"I had a normal dining experience here.  The food was good and service was fast.  I did not enjoy the $20 tab when I only got a coke and the lunch  pizza and salad combo.   Let's talk about this combo though.  They claim it is a lunch combo, but it was huge portions.  I got the caesar salad and it was definitely a dinner sized salad.  If it would have had a protein on it, it could have been my whole meal.  Secondly, the pizza was very large for being a lunch size..  I won't complain about having left overs, but I was surprised by this. The air conditioning was really cold and made the whole experience kind of uncomfortable. Our server was very nice and attentive."
Olivia H.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,22,,2.0,7/8/2012,"Raspberry lemonade was good, portions are big, good service, and good atmosphere. However, food was not that great. Nothing really stood out to me. Cheesecake is good if you like unusual flavors, but for a plain cheesecake it's just average."
Chris G.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4,78,,2.0,9/5/2012,Food was very greasy and salty. (Fish and Yam Fries).  Pineapple upside down cheesecake was great.
Michael P.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,79,2,3.0,3/29/2014,over-crowded and no real system for people to follow or 'over flow' room for waiting patrons to use.
Angie G.,"Minneapolis, MN",18,9,1,5.0,1/11/2012,"Had the Mexican tortilla salad, under 590 calories and super, super good and big!"
Ryan J.,"Duluth, MN",22,21,2,3.0,5/20/2012,"According to Chef Ramsey there are 2 rules to a great restaurant.  Rule #1 fresh ingredients.  Rule #2, keep it simple.  The Cheesecake Factory has never seen ""Kitchen Nightmares.""  The menu alone contains 19 pages.  It covers just about every type of food you could possibly order.  And the interior matches the overwhelming menu.  For how extremely busy it always is there they do a great job of keeping up with the insanity.  And the food was good, better than what I was anticipating.  If the presentation wasn't so messy and the prices were a little more reasonable I would have given it 4 stars.  Recommended for tourists in the area and fans of, SURPRISE, cheesecake."
Liz V.,"San Jose, CA",85,197,40,2.0,1/25/2009,"I've always loved Cheesecake for a variety of reasons, mostly the food: 1. the soup and salad combo 2. the lettuce wraps! 3. steaaaakssss and shrimp 4. the piece of cheesecake i can never finish 5. the flying gorilla of course, extra liquor plsss 6. the brown bread WITH butter, mmm i love bread the only sad part about this rating is the service my friends and i experienced at the Edina location on a Wednesday night. sad sad sad... it took an hour to get a table (which is fine, I guess, because we had a big group), but the fact that we found empty tables EVERYWHERE as we were walking to our table. what happened there? i don't know. and the time it took for the lady to take our orders? aye.... sorry Cheesecake, you're gona have to deal with my 2/5 rating for this one."
Steve U.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,118,,1.0,9/19/2010,"if the amplificatIon of your ass is the objective then the place deserves 10 stars.   the portions are large enough to feed a reasonably sized village the menus are chock full of adverts and I wouldn't be surprised if they actually piped in additional crowd noise while you're dining.   i've seen people order a salad (appetizer sized portion) and then cancel the order for the entree when the app salad arrives.  this is all about excess and it feels cheap and then you get the bill and then you realize, you really did have a weeks worth of groceries on your plate. so in terms of mass it was actually a good deal.  good for groups, horrible for dates. think chilis with more noise, italian food, more ads and a wide range of tangential dishes all of mediocre quality.   that this place is in edina should surprise no one."
Sarah R.,"Seattle, WA",79,320,37,4.0,6/13/2008,So I am reviewing this location because it was the last one I went to.. but obviously this is a chain restaurant and it seems to be about the same everywhere I go. What I like  - Nice decor.. not so fancy that you can't dress casual.. but not so casual that you feel strange if you look a little dressy. - The classic cheesecake with strawberries is amazing - I have always had decent service here - The menu is extensive What I don't like - I STILL after being here more than 10 times have not found a dish that I love. I have tried something new almost every time. The food has been consistently mediocre.
Joy H.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,35,,5.0,6/19/2009,"Say what you will about chain restaurants, but I like everything about The Cheesecake Factory and would tell anyone it's one of my favorite places to eat. The menu is extensive and varied with a lot of veggie options, the lunch combos are great, the food is fresh, the service has always been friendly and efficient, and the passion fruit iced tea is so good, I actually get cravings for it. To start, you're given wonderful sour dough and brown bread and they are happy to provide olive oil instead of butter. The edamame appetizer ($4.95) is perfectly steamed and salted, and a good portion of pods. The avocado eggrolls ($9.95) are delicious and decadent with chunks of avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro in a crisp wrapper with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. If you eat shrimp, the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls ($8.95) are as good as those I've had in any authentic Asian restaurant. Also offered is guacamole made-to-order, sweet corn tamale cakes and a fire roasted artichoke with dipping sauce. The appetizer salads are abundant, colorful, fresh and easily a meal by themselves. The tossed green salad ($6.95) is the perfect house salad with tomato wedges, sliced cucumber and julienned beet, zucchini and carrot. I highly recommend the peanut cilantro dressing, but the Asian plum dressing and balsamic vinaigrette are also very good. Also tasty is the French country salad ($8.95) with beets, grilled asparagus and pecans (can hold the goat cheese) and the vegetable chopped salad ($8.95) with edamame, green beans, asparagus, cucumber, tomato, roasted beets and apple in a pomegranate vinaigrette (can hold the white cheddar). Lunch combos and portions are served every day until 5:00 p.m. and range from $7.95 to $10.95. My favorite is the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza with Japanese eggplant, artichoke, red and yellow pepper, Kalamata olives and tomato, paired with the tossed green salad. (Vegans, ask them to hold all the cheese on the pizza since there is parmesan in addition to goat cheese.) The Santa Fe entrée salad is simple southwestern goodness with greens, corn, black beans, tomato and tortilla strips in the spicy peanut-cilantro dressing ($9.95 for lunch portion; $13.95 for entrée size). You can hold the chicken and cheese and add avocado. The grilled portabella on a bun ($10.95) is a huge mushroom cap flavored with herbs topped with lettuce, tomato and grilled red onion (can add avocado and hold the cheese and the spicy mayo) served with fries, or they happily substitute any side. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich is also great - again, I recommend adding avocado if you hold the cheese and mayo. A number of nice vegetable sides are available including broccoli, corn succotash, asparagus, sautéed spinach and snow peas with veggies, ranging from $3.95 to $6.50. Vegetarians can choose from more than 25 flavors of cheesecake and numerous other stunning desserts. There are no vegan dessert options, other than a pricey bowl of strawberries. The Cheesecake Factory is home away from home for my family as we've been eating at the Southdale location in Edina at least once a month since they opened and we've been to locations in other cities. Even after many visits, we've yet to try all the veggie options available, we're always pleased with the staff's willingness to accommodate our veggie requests and we always look forward to our meals there knowing that we'll leave happy.

Karen S.,"Minneapolis, MN",31,457,,2.0,6/12/2010,"Look, I don't normally seek this place out, but I went for lunch with two friends today. I remember from past visits the food being OK, and most big chains will at least be able to get you lunch without much problem. Not here. Our service was incompetent. It took about 10 minutes just to get drinks, and another 10 for someone to take our order. We were given silverware, bread (which was basically stale), and a tablemate received her side of salad dressing for her salad. About 20 minutes later our server came by with dessert menus. The hell? We reminded him we ordered food and had not received it. 15 minutes later, were told food would be out ""soon."" It came after about another 15 minutes. The guy was in a daze the whole time, and just appeared clueless. We were told that if we wanted to order dessert it would be comped, so I guess that's sort of redeeming. So we each ordered dessert, just on principle. It was noon on a Saturday, and the place was about 1/2 full of people, and there were plenty of servers.  Anyway, the food is meh, but there is a lot of variety (almost to a fault.), and you'll get an OK meal."
Becky L.,"Minneapolis, MN",20,160,88,3.0,2/10/2011,Perfect for stopping after the movies.  We had appetizers and mojitos.  Tried the chicken croquettes (croquetas de pollo) and they tasted like the real Spanish croquetas!
Nicole N.,"Apple Valley, MN",3,54,5,5.0,10/30/2011,I can't believe this place is lower on the star list I am a huge fan! For the amount of food you get the price is just fine and the cheesecake oh my God in heaven it's very good! Sooooo many favors to pick from and the menu for dinner options is the same way. It can be hard to pick! My husband doesn't even like cheesecake and he loved the Oreo one! I have had many flavors but I think the vanilla bean is fantastic! Get the cheesecake to go though since I promise you'll be to stuffed to eat!!!!
Chrissy S.,"Eden Prairie, MN",4,1,,4.0,5/19/2013,"I went there for my birthday dinner with my fiancé. My first time there but not his. For a Saturday (5:00) it was quite busy. Patio was full and we were anticipating a long wait but when we got in there, they said 10 minutes, and they weren't lying. :) The menu is HUGE! I got an overpriced Long Island that wasn't that great but his Stella was only $5. We ordered pot stickers for our app and I had the chipotle mayo chicken sand. He ordered the smokehouse BBQ burger. I am disappointed in the fact that our entrees arrived before our appetizer (meaning she forgot). We should've cancelled it because it wasn't worth the $8.95 they charge. But the portion size of the entrees is definitely worth the price. Service was what you'd expect and I would return (just to try one of the other 100 items on the menu). Oh, and the red velvet cheesecake is alright. :)"
Alison T.,"Saint Paul, MN",32,91,130,4.0,8/8/2010,"My sweet Cheesecake Factory, it pains me that we live in separate worlds - you, many moons away in the galaxy of Southdale Mall, and me, in the galaxy of eastern Twin Cities suburbia.  How am I supposed to survive on cheesecake from your great institution only every other month at best?  I have tried to find a closer replacement, but no one can compare to you.  You keep on making those heavenly Red Velvet, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and Pumpkin Pecan cheesecakes and I will keep dreaming of you morning, noon, and night."
Jean L.,"Rockford, IL",3,6,,1.0,3/27/2012,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. I was traveling to MN and discovered this location. The food of course was amazing but the service was absolutely horrible. As I walked in there were a few girls standing at the hostess podium. It wasn't until after they were done chatting did they acknowledge my party. As we were waiting on our food, which took FOREVER even though they weren't even that busy, I witnessed 2 waiters picking at their nose without ever washing their hands or removing themselves from the floor to go to the restroom. Absolutely every employee that worked there looked miserable. Not one employee was happy or even pleasant to talk to. Our waitress never refilled our drinks and I had to sip on my boyfriend's until we left. She was so rude and seemed like she absolutely hated her job. I feel the $3 tip we left her was way too much."
Ralph B.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,17,,2.0,4/11/2011,"The food was good, but only decent service. The price isis WAY to high for the quality of food and not personal servers. Not worth it unless you love the cheesecake itself."
lokesh y.,"San Francisco, CA",5,20,,3.0,5/12/2010,"I went along with my girl friend to this place. It was on monday evening. We ordered chicken and steak, it wasn't that great, but good"
Kathy C.,"Minneapolis, MN",24,165,52,4.0,11/9/2007,"I like the Cheesecake Factory's food.  Everything is made to order (with a few exceptions, ie app rolls, goulash, and that's about it actually) My favorites are: Cobb Salad, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Miso Salmon, C&A, Pesto Pizza, Thai Wraps, and Tamale Cakes.  There are more but I am too hungry right now to think about it.  :)   Come in on a Saturday, the soup is the BEST: Cream of Chx with Artichoke Hearts and Mushrooms.   Something most restaurants don't do:  You can sub anything for fries.  Yes that means a tossed salad that is normally 6.50, or mashed potatoes, or broc, or whatever..for the SAME price.  Killer!!   (asparagus is an upcharge, however, fyi) Also, bro, sorry about your server not being attentive.  Boo on them.   Yes it's a chain but if your idea of dining out is Applebee's *(don't laugh, there are a lot of people like that.  Why do you think AB's etc are still in business?) Come check it out for a nice dinner out If you're a local dwelling-independent business type?  Go to eat street.  :)"
