Steve W.,"Andover, MN",15,100,,5.0,8/1/2007,"This was one of my favorite places to go when I lived closer to one in Arizona, but it's worth the occasional jaunt down to Edina just for lunch.   As a vegetarian it's rare that I look at a menu at a national chain and have a hard time picking what I want; there's usually only 2-3 items to choose from.  But The Cheesecake Factory is different.  First off, their menu is a book....literally.  Granted it has plenty of ads, but there's a lot of food to choose from regardless of your dietary preferences! My personal favorites are the avocado egg rolls and the grilled portobello on a bun, but be careful when you order.  Unless you can EAT, it's hard to get through an appetizer and an entree, even when sharing.  Portions are large and filling! One of the things that stands out about The Cheesecake Factory is actually just a little thing that means a lot to me.  Anyone that dines out with children knows that the most stressful time is the time between sitting down at the table and the point at which the food arrives.  Kids tend to get restless during this time and chaos can ensue (which is why Mexican food, with chips and salsa, is always a good option with kids!).  The Cheesecake Factory solves this problem by bringing out a small plate with some banana, orange and Cheerios that the kids immediately latch on to.  It's a great idea that is most appreciated by those of us with kids, not to mention those sitting nearby that might get some peace and quiet. And of course there's the cheesecake.  The only bad thing you can say about the cheesecake is that it's just too rich.  But that would be a stretch of a complaint! There can long waits for lunch and dinner so plan on spending a little more time waiting, but I can assure you that the wait is worth it!"
Gabriella P.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,11,,4.0,6/23/2012,"Two words: Avocado Eggrolls, they are fantastic, and the sauce is delectable, I always start any meal at the Cheesecake Factory with the eggrolls, and I usually go for the Miso Salmon for my entree, it gets pricey in the dinner portion, but the lunch portion is super cheap and way more than enough food, even for those of you with hollow legs. They always have great food presentation, the service is generally superb, and their drinks are pretty great, the passion fruit mojito is really really good, the bellini is terrible. There is generally a wait so I would call ahead and put your name on the list just to be sure. ON the whole, this place is affordable and they have  a very large selection of foods, ranging from asian to american to meican to a delicious fusion. I am usually skeptical of a restaurant that tries to do too much with its menu, but I have to say that they do a wonderful job with all of their menu items, I have onlyonce had a bad experience, the food was cold, and the waitress switched our meals when she boxed the food, we didnt find out until it was too late to swap.... i took a trip to bummer town that night bc i was really looking forward to leftovers for lunch the next day... oh well! The cheesecake it pretty good, and they have a large varriety of choicess, but honestly, their entree menu is the only reason I stop in."
ricardo m.,"Eagan, MN",23,58,,3.0,7/8/2009,"Im really not that big of fan to be honest with you, we went there for dinner and the food was passable, the real reason to come back would be the deserts. Just to say, the sign says cheese cake factory, not ""super Italian and some foregin cheese on a burger with white shirts kind of trying to be an upscale macaroni grill but cant factory"" That wouldnt fit the building and would cost a small fortune to light up. Go there for the cake and then leave. As we all know though, a chain never is as good as a one off."
Jen B.,"Minneapolis, MN",95,195,4,3.0,1/5/2009,"I went because I had a gift card. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have gone.  And well, I am torn on the rating.  I will start with the positives-  -The cheesecake is knock your socks off orgasmically wonderful. I don't care if ""orgasmically"" is a word or not!  The ok's-  -The food. It's alright, although it's difficult to say a club sandwich is worth $11.95. It should never be more than $5.95!  -The service. It was alright. Wasn't bad, wasn't wonderful.  The negatives-  -Location. Southdale is always packed, for whatever reason. It's tough to find a convenient parking spot. Which can be a plus I guess, to work off the 5 billion fat grams on the hike back to your car after eating a piece of cheesecake!  -I don't like Edina, but that's just me.  -Seating....we were seated at a tiny little table that was about 6 inches from each table beside us.  It was like dining with strangers.  Not easy to have a private conversation when you have strangers a foot away.  Who, by the way were fine on the right side, but weird as hell on the left.  They actually started questioning us about our food choices right as our food was brought to the table.  I was like, bitch, I am hungry, shut up so I can eat and mind your own business.  I didn't say this out loud, but it felt good to say it in my head. -A little on the spendy side (see above comment on the $11.95 club sandwich)  So, whatever. I got a kick ass piece of cheesecake. I also could of saved the trip and the money on the rest of the meal and picked up some Cheesecake Factory at my local Super Target where they sell it in their bakery."
Heather P.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,15,10,4.0,4/7/2008,"There was a thirty minute wait on a Sunday night, with limited seating for waiting customers. We also could not wait outside because the buzzer would not work outside the front door to the restaurant. Our server was very soft spoken and did not know the menu. When preparing to take our order for our cheesecake, he said there were a few cheesecakes not featured on the menu, but after hearing his description of the dessert, we realized that they were indeed on the menu. The Shepard's pie was very big and very filling! The Shrimp Vietnamese spring rolls were not good. They had too many chives and only a few pieces of shrimp scattered throughout the whole dish. I had to cut the spring roll apart just to enjoy some portion of my meal.  The restaurant is nice, as they usually are. The cheesecakes were the best part of our dinner!"
Sam O.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,146,,5.0,11/21/2008,"Probably one of my wife's favs, and I enjoy it as well.  I don't think I've ever had anything bad here, and overall most of my meals were really good.  expect to take some home.   The only downside is that there is typically a wait during peak times, but that's pretty normal with good, no reservation restaurants.   And yes, it is a chain, but who cares.  It's good, and has something for everyone, and almost all the food is made from scratch. and did I mention the awesome cheesecake.  The other deserts are so-so I suggest going later in the eve (after 8:30), and stay away during the holiday season."
Allison K.,"Circle Pines, MN",0,14,,5.0,12/16/2011,"I have to tell you about the most amazing meal. It is called the Spicy Chicken Chipolte Pasta and it is AWESOME! Never before have I tasted something so amazing. Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce... What's not to love?"
Melissa B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,3.0,10/17/2009,"First, the decor...what?  We couldn't figure out the theme, and decided that they must have gotten a deal on Vegas strip leftovers.  Quite the hodgepodge.  There were way too many options, and the portions were almost comically huge (which could be good or bad, depending on your mood.)  Service was decent.  Nothing really stood out.  I guess it would be a good place to go if a large group of people who couldn't agree on one cuisine were getting together.  Meh."
Grant G.,"Minneapolis, MN",46,22,6,5.0,5/16/2007,"I don't know what Mike is talking about. I've been to this location about half a dozen times and all of them have been winners. I generally go out later on weekends and always have to wait up to 45 minutes. The food is terrific, the atmosphere is dark and classy, and the cheesecake is easily the best I've had. I say this having been to the Elli's Cheesecake Factory in Chicago...they've got nothing on the cheesecake they make at the Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The food is great Italian food and the list of cheesecakes is long. The food and desserts aren't cheap, but wow is it worth it. You'll want to make sure you save room for dessert here and it's okay to to a box home because it will still be great tomorrow."
Angel H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,15,,5.0,11/26/2009,"The food are very delicate and delicious. From appetizer, entrees, dessert, they all excellent! The price is reasonable too, I always want to come back."
