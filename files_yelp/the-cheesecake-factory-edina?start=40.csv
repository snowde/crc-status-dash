Brendon S.,"Minneapolis, MN",31,3,,1.0,2/10/2017,"I have always been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but my last experience made me walk out. First off, when we entered, it took the host staff nearly ten minutes to acknowledge our presence. Walked in at 8:50 and didn't get acknowledged until 8:58. Then once we were at the table, it just went downhill. We were seated for well over fifteen minutes with no waitstaff to grab us drinks, bread, or water. When I did ask, which was twice, I was told snidely that ""this isn't my assigned section"", and they walked off. I was livid. Meanwhile, the same two which I asked were having casual small talk by the restroom hallway for a good amount of time. I hope management reads this because I love the food and the experiences in the past, and I want to be reassured this will not happen again so I can keep coming back for great experiences."
Megan D.,"Fargo, ND",0,19,,4.0,4/20/2017,"Love the atmosphere. Could use some more options that aren't over 1,000 calories. My salad was good but my boyfriends mashed potatoes were excellent!  We got the avocado fried wrap as an appetizer which was very unique and good. It is pretty dark in there lighting wise but I like that, think it adds to the ambiance."
Granpa T.,"Saint Paul, MN",70,62,311,2.0,3/4/2017,Went to eat at the south dale location service was good quality of food poor. Most likely would not return based on poor quality food.
Jody M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,13,,2.0,6/15/2016,"I've been hesitant writing a review of this Cheesecake Factory as the overall experience has been so inconsistent. However, my last experience, made me see life through Gordon Ramsey's eyes.  The first thing I will say is that the avocado egg rolls were amazing. So excellent job. Most appetizers I've had here have been great.  Yet, unfortunately the main course was anything but. I'll keep it short in saying we ordered our daughter buttered noodles, a nice simple meal as long as it doesn't sit under a heat lamp for too long. By our estimates, the buttered noodles were under a heat lamp for at least 20 minutes. The end result is severally brown, and hard noodles, you can't put a fork in. I am not joking when I say this. Even the person helping our server looked at the dish when they were putting it on the table, paused before putting it down, looked curiously at the dish and then layed it in front of our 2-year-old. A piping hot plate, and dried food.  I thought maybe it would have ended there, but by order of enchiladas were dried too, the sauce was entirely baked into the tortilla meaning: no sauce. The beans had a cooked layer of dryness, and the cilantro rice was so baked on the top layer, I could practically remove the entire layer as it's own cover. I tried one, bite, but it was hard and I couldn't finish it.  My son said his spicy chicken sandwich was okay, except that the spice was inconsistent. One part of the chicken had almost no spice and the other was way too hot for him to eat. While this is an opinion of his, I would agree with him that there shouldn't be so much disparity on a single piece of chicken.  Our server was friendly when she took our orders, but never brought the bread she said she was going to bring, and only showed up once after we received our order. That was to give us a check. When she asked if I wanted a box for the pasta we didn't eat, she looked down at the bowl, and said, ""Oh. Probably not."" I thought about saying something to management, but frankly I've had similar experiences, and was just tired of saying anything.  The cheesecake was of course very good.  End result of my many experiences here: Appetizers are always amazing, service can be great, or shoddy depending on the server, main entrees are wildly inconsistent. Cheesecake is always very good.  Overall, the inconsistency is very difficult as I don't know if I am going to have a nice meal, or a bad experience. I've yet to have an overall good experience, but I'm hoping it does happen. I keep rooting for them!"
Kevin A.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,2,,5.0,5/21/2017,Presentation A1 food AMAZING service like no other! i recommended coming here if you're looking for amazing food at a cheap price!
James F.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,11,,3.0,9/2/2017,It's hard to see why this place is so popular. Service was decent with a packed house. Ambiance was nice but a bit loud. Everything on the menu is overpriced. Food was slow to get out and poorly prepared. The cheesecake is the only reason is I'd come back.
Sarah A.,"Minneapolis, MN",765,110,383,5.0,3/12/2015,"I love the decor! It is stunning. It kind of reminds me of the mall in Las Vegas with the painted sky ceiling and the dim lights.  Happy hour drinks: J.w.'s pink lemonade: Skyy Citrus vodka, raspberry licqeur and lemonade $5.50 - tasted like watered down lemonade but maybe it's a good thing it didn't taste strong. This is a popular drink that many people enjoy. Margarita: Classic margarita with gold tequila, triple sec and fresh lime $5.50 - this was strong but not too bad! Happy hour appetizers:  Soy glazed edamame $4.95 - I'm not sure why they give you the option of having it plain or with soy sauce. Most restaurants offer edamame with soy sauce on the side. I wish that was the case here but it was good. If I had to order it again, I would take it plain. Portobello mushroom avocado and zucchini fries $6.95 - I liked the texture of it except the fried avocado was not my favorite. I think it was too soft for my preference but the batter was fried perfectly and it tasted very crisp.  Entree:  Miso salmon about $19 - delicious! I only ate half of it and saved the rest for lunch tomorrow. The sauce it as glazed in was sweet. This meal came with a few vegetable peas but I wish it came with broccoli or more. It comes with white or brown rice. I'd recommend this dish at least once to try.   Dessert:  Lemon raspberry cream cheesecake - hands down light, fluffy, smooth, and all worth it! I'm so glad I tried this and I would get it again. It was mostly cheesecake with a lemon cake type of crust.. At least that's what I think I tasted :) Waitress: Tara - hands down the best service I've had in a long time. She checked my birth date on my ID and noticed that my birthday was a couple days ago. So she gave me the cheesecake with happy birthday decorations on it. She recommended everything that I ordered, and she checked up on my table every once in a while. If you get her as a waitress, you will enjoy your dining experience!"
Reid D.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,13,6,1.0,5/20/2016,I had an awful experience here. We called ahead for a larger group. They told us no wait. We showed up and the manager Diego acted like we were lying. He told us one hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. When we asked after waiting 1:15 they lied and told us they said 1:45 in the first place. We ended up waiting two and a half hours and left for Snuffys. We had 5 kids under 10 years old and feel upset and mistreated. This experience was bad enough that I will never go back. Granted I would never have picked this place in the first place. Never trust a restaurant that has a book sized menu with ads in it. :)
Tyler T.,"Hopkins, MN",0,16,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Overpriced. But I seen that a lot on here and I had a gift card, so I had to use it eventually (don't typically go to eat at places connected to a movie theatre)  had about a 3rd of my meal dumped on me by whoever brought the food out. Her only response was ""this happens all the time"" and then she ran off. When the waiter came back and asked how was everything, I told him it was ok despite a large portion being dumped on me, his response even better, ""how rude"" as he hurried away."
Paige T.,"Rochester, MN",4,54,3,2.0,4/26/2016,"I just. Don't know. First of all, get their Bloody Mary. They make their own mix and they are FAB. But I'm confused. I don't get the theme of the restaurant. The menu is too huge to comprehend. And the food tasted...weird. I got the chicken and waffles Benedict which is like all my favorite things rolled into one and I just couldn't get past the hollandaise. That can make or break a dish and it definitely broke it.  I'll probably be back though for a bloody."
Michelle C.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,65,17,3.0,7/30/2017,"The food is medium - their salads are large in size and delicious, but some of their other items are basic. I highly recommend the luau salad and the avocado egg rolls. I also love the brown bread - it's one of my favorite things even though the basket comes with every meal."
Kathleen G.,"Bloomington, MN",0,2,,5.0,3/8/2017,"Love this place, very classy, we went for lunch, great food, good size portions. Our server was very friendly, offered a variety of choices both for meals and cheesecake!"
Hannah C.,"Glenview, IL",17,43,68,4.0,6/4/2016,"This place is very spacious and buzzing with groups of people-- it's cheesecake factory located at a mall. I always get spicy chicken chipotle pasta (when I want to splurge) or Chinese chicken salad. Their portions are hugeee. The wait was over an hour long on a saturday night-ish (7-8pm). Great place for groups, drinks, and american food...after all, it's quintessential suburban family restaurant :)"
Jessica K.,"Minneapolis, MN",189,227,10,2.0,6/19/2015,"I don't get it! This place is not always busy, but always has a excessive wait time. Saturday nights it's not uncommon to see a wait time of 2 hours.  The menu is huge. But it is so big that I think it creates the long wait time since you have to go through the book trying to decide what to order.  Every time I've eaten there, I feel like the food is the same as a Applebee's, but why did I wait so long for it? I just don't get it!  Is there a page I'm missing from the menu for delicious awesomeness? Because I feel like I'm missing the reason people wait so long."
Corie H.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,8,1,5.0,5/14/2016,"We came on a very busy Saturday night. First off, our server was outstanding! On top of everything, friendly, accommodating etc.  my husband had the ribeye and said it was one of the best he's ever had in a non steakhouse setting-done Medium Rare to perfection, juicy, & tender. I had the Chicken Di Pana. Very moist, flavorful, and very generous proportions!  The white Sangria was also fantastic..& strong! ;-)  We will be back again.  Menu is huge-something for every taste palate. Wait is always long because everyone realizes how great this place is, so I suggest putting your name on the list then doing a little shopping and calling to check in around the time your quoted wait time is up."
Cheayne C.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",19,10,2,5.0,1/4/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory never gets old! Love this location. The night was EXTREMELY busy but our food came out fast (We got the Teriyaki Chicken, Alfredo and Cookie Dough Cheesecake). Our server gave us nothing but smiles our whole stay even though we could see she was a little tired already. Will definitely be back!"
Katrina O.,"Minnetonka, MN",136,282,492,3.0,6/9/2015,"Entrees are very lacking flavor wise so if you've never been and are wanting to try the place out, I suggest going for a couple appetizers and then dessert of course! Can't go wrong with any of their cheesecakes...Out of the few i've tried including oreo, and s'mores, the mango key lime cheesecake is by far the best! If you're into fruity tasting stuff than this will hit the spot! I'm tempted to stop by tomorrow on my way back from work to get a slice! It is that good!"
Mikołaj S.,"Edina, MN",46,131,198,3.0,6/23/2015,"We stopped in tonight for a single slice of cheesecake; let me tell you, they had a ton of options which well made me indecisive (as a piece of cheesecake is a huge commitment to someone with lactose intolerance). Anyway, I made my decision selecting the lemon raspberry with a raspberry drizzle. Overall, it was delicious had I been able to taste anything other than lemon; it was extremely rich which can be nice, but this was overkill. I could have saved myself the 7.50$ and just squeezed a lemon into my mouth.  Even with my lactose, I am a sucker for cheesecake and will definitely return; just not for the lemon raspberry."
Bailey Kay T.,"McCook County, SD",0,10,3,5.0,10/17/2015,"Luke was our waiter tonight and he was fantastic!! We ordered drinks, apps, entrees and last but definitely not least cheesecake.  Wait time was 40 minutes and seemed to move quickly.  I ordered the avocado egg rolls, chicken Madeira, salted Carmel cheesecake and a Georgia peach. Everything was perfection. I actually split the children Madeira with my friend.  My mom got meatloaf, crab bites and salted Carmel cheesecake. Said her food was delicious.  Sister got loaded baked potato bites and apple crisp for dessert. Apply crisp was bigger than each of our plates.  I only got a picture of the chicken Madeira and one lonely egg roll.  Cheesecake Factory is always a favorite. Thanks Luke for being so much fun tonight!! Your sense of humor was necessary for the evening!!"
Johanna W.,"Spokane, WA",7,2,,5.0,12/26/2016,We went with the family and the server was great. He did so good. My brother in law was happy and is very very hard to please him. Great job. I love the fettucini alfredo. Will come back again.
