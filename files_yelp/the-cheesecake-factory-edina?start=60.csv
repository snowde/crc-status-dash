Kimberly C.,"Minneapolis, MN",73,207,301,4.0,1/26/2014,"I've been here several times and I'm just getting around to writing a review.  As usual they were pretty busy and waiting on a table for three was going to be a while.  Luckily we spotted a table in the bar area which was vacant and made a mad dash to it as it's first come first serve.  The menu includes tons of choices for starters, salads, small plates, entrees, sandwiches, etc. It's actually too much (for me) and a bit bit overwhelming.  Therefore I tend to stick with the massive burrito big enough to feed four.   This time I ventured out and went for: - Buffalo Wings:  Delicious!  They're breaded, not super saucy or extra dry, and have the right amount of spice.  Therefore no need to worry about your mouth burning.  -Beet Salad: I loved it. Includes apples, goat cheese, pecans and arugala dressed with balsamic vinaigrette. It's on the ""skinny"" menu for those to eat a ""healthier"" at Cheesecake Factory.  I didn't go for the Strawberry Lemonade which is so good, but hopefully next time."
Jane C.,"Saint Paul, MN",3,15,3,3.0,10/28/2016,"The service was excellent. The one problem I had was one of the pasta dishes. Tomato basil pasta, it was good,  but there was too much garlic. It pretty much overpowered the dish. I left with a horrible nasty taste of garlic.. I am choosing a different dish."
Shoshana M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,15,2.0,6/5/2016,"I've been here twice before and loved my meals, however tonight's dishes were a major disappointment. I ordered the Jumbalya and it was so soggy and watery I sent it back after one bite. The waiter didn't apologize or ask what was wrong, he simply asked me what I'd like instead. I then ordered the Gumbo, as I've had it before and remember really liking it. Something must've been off with the kitchen, today, though because that was horrible as well. I asked for a to go box and threw away my $18 meal when I got home.  While my meals were bad, what was worse was the service and our waiter's apathy toward our experience.  If you go here, steer clear of the chicken dishes (unless they are deep fried) otherwise, you'll get chewy, soggy, fatty meat for a minimum of $16 a plate.  I will say, my boyfriend's dish (the Habachi Steak) was delicious as were the buffalo wings we split."
Mark J.,"Maple Grove, MN",12,77,,3.0,2/27/2015,"I've been here once and it was very recent.  Parking was difficult even for a weekday.  Was expecting to wait for a table for 2 and the wait wasn't too long.  They kinda pack you in here if you are not sitting in a booth.  The table next to you is within arms reach which isn't really my jam. When I saw that the menu was as thick as a Clancy novel, I decided I should try a safe option that's hard to screw up so I went with the Chicken Alfredo.  It was somewhat bland but edible.  The bread they served before hand (and that our server kindly refilled during our entree) was delicious.  The service was great overall. I would go back and try the breakfast or brunch as that part of the menu looked very intriguing."
Walid S.,"Davenport, FL",86,125,698,4.0,3/31/2014,A twist on every day's comfort food with a blend of classic cafe varieties.  The menu has more chicken dishes than there are grains in a silo.
Angie O.,"Minneapolis, MN",31,147,247,2.0,2/19/2016,"The menu is overwhelming, the wait is ridiculous.  Food is salty as heck!  Ya I said heck, you better get the soap. Overpriced."
Vy B.,"Minneapolis, MN",828,269,469,4.0,11/11/2014,"Yes I am reviewing the Cheesecake Factory which is the chainiest restaurant ever but it has good food. There might be thousands of calories in one single meal but I have yet to order something that turns out to be average. Their happy hour deals are awesome with the app specials so I would highly recommend stopping there between 4-6 on weekdays.  Here are my go-to items:  -Avocado eggrolls (creamy, sweet, salty, rich) -Buffalo blasts (chicken in buffalo sauce wrapped in a wonton wrapper deep fried in batter i.e. a super fatty app but delicious) -Pasta bellagio (angel hair pasta served with pesto cream sauce, fried chicken, and prosciutto served over bed of arugula) -red velvet cheesecake (amazing cake and cheesecake hybrid, not too sweet) So just because I am recommending this place, does not mean you should go here every day!!! The portions are huge and the meals are very rich...moderation people!!! Side note, the menu has way too many items on it and sometimes I feel like I am reading a catalog when all I want is a quick bite to eat. I know, #firstworldproblems."
Nestor R.,"Skokie, IL",75,1,,2.0,5/15/2016,"I've been here 3 different times and what up have found is that the Food over priced, It's always crowed the wait times are ridiculous. Silverware tends to be dirty..... The cheese cake is there only thing that is good."
Cameryn L.,"Saint Paul, MN",12,59,34,4.0,1/3/2016,"I love this place! I live 30 minutes away and always make a trip to get some of their red velvet cheesecake. The service is average but the food makes up for it. Some of my favorites: fried zucchini, Louisiana chicken pasta, and brown bread (free). The menu is very large and it is easy to get overwhelmed."
Shannon L.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,1,1,4.0,5/11/2016,Very very very upset that the Chicken Scampi was taken off the menu.  I went there for Mothers Day and told my mother for days how delicious it is only to find out she wont get to try it.
Kelly B.,"Milwaukee, WI",280,530,528,3.0,12/1/2014,"I always have my go-to pasta dish when I go here that is consistently good - and that is no doubt thanks to the creamy buttery sauce that comes with it.  Mom and I went on a Saturday evening, but thanks to our early 5:30 arrival we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Our server was a young guy who was very excited about everything. We were both a little irked that neither the drinks nor the cheesecake listed pricing on the menu. Mom was more than a little shocked to find out at the end of the meal that her chinsy watered down sangria was $9.50, especially compared to my $5 Sierra Nevada. When I asked him what the price was, he admitted he didn't know. I wanted my Farfalle pasta with sundried tomatoes, roasted garlic, peas, and pancetta. It is so delicious that I do NOT want to know how many calories I just ingested.  Mom asked the server for a recommendation and he had raving reviews for the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish. When they arrived, hers was a huge mountain of rice surrounded by the meat/shrimp. While the flavor was good (mostly just the coconut), she did note that there was no essence of ""bang-bang"" to be found. He got very defensive and snapped he never said it was spicy, and that white people don't understand what spice is. Odd... Our food was good, we were full with little leftovers, but somehow two drinks and two meals added up to over $50. He dropped the bill off with three other tables' tabs also in there which was odd.  While I usually enjoy myself here, I find that the health/quality of the food and beverages just simply do not measure up to what the charge for them."
Jess F.,"Minneapolis, MN",80,176,187,2.0,1/24/2015,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory quite a few times, and the quality of food has always disappointment me.  That isn't to say the sauces they use to coat all the food in fat, salt, sugar, and other natural flavors it's fun and mostly tasty, but I just like crisp lettuce, hot fries, al dente pasta, tender chicken, and strong drinks.  Call me a snob? On other notes, service tends to be good, parking is Edina, and they don't let you make reservations in advance.  Boo."
Linda L.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,73,122,5.0,3/28/2015,"Great restaurant, good service and good Food! I loved their cheesecakes!  So many different flavors to pick and I am still trying out different flavors.   Very nice environment!"
Kaprice W.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,39,23,1.0,8/17/2016,"So disappointed on my engagement day!!! My boyfriend suprised me and took me here for the first time after he popped the question last weekend. I ALWAYS wanted to come here but never had the chance. First we waited 40 mins to get seated WITH a reservation. Second of all they brought me the wrong food! I ordered farfalle chicken & garlic which had tomatoes in it and I told the server I am allergic to tomatoes when ordering and on top of that they did not include the mushrooms in the dish which I love mushrooms. I had to send my dish back due to the tomatoes and was told it would be 30 mins to get it remade. Instead of waiting my fiance shared his chicken Madeira which was good but Luke warm when they brought it to our table. The best part of the meal was the calamari, the banana cream and white chocolate rasberry cheesecake. The service wasn't that great either we had to wave down our server for drink refills and waited 30 mins after we were done eating for the check. Sadly this is not what I would of expected for a nice restaurant. As much as I wanted to love this place they did not deliver on a very special, memorable day."
T. Allan P.,"Winnipeg, Canada",0,28,4,2.0,4/3/2016,"We only had to wait 30 minutes for a table, but once we were seated (in uncomfortable wicker chairs in the lounge...at a high bar table), it seemed our server was either too busy or uninterested in serving. It took nearly ten minutes just to come over and take our beverage order.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken off of their 'skinnylicious' menu. When it came out, it looked like a couple of grilled chicken breasts in a soup-like sauce. And there were SO many baby tomatoes, it was almost overwhelming trying to find the dish. On the menu, it said it came with a 'green salad'. I can only imagine that that was smothered somewhere in that sauce. I ate the 3 pieces of chicken and tried to eat the tomatoes but they were just so soaked in sauce that I couldn't bear to finish it. For dessert, I ordered the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore cheesecake. It was good - obviously very rich, but just good. The whole ordeal to have our leftovers brought back to us and the bills taken care of us nearly added 15 minutes to our experience. It was just so slow. Food was alright, service left something to be desired."
Mark R.,"Denver, CO",0,16,,5.0,3/4/2017,Never had a bad meal at a Cheesecake Factory.    Quality food at a reasonable price and good service.
Karlynn S.,"Minneapolis, MN",56,11,1,3.0,7/29/2015,"The hostess' and manager were terribly rude, we waited over 40 minutes to be seated...people that came in after we did were seated immediately! We had originally asked for a booth but we're told they had no wait staff for booths, we said a table would be fine then and we still were not seated! The manager said we could call corporate to complain but that was all he could do for us. Our waitress however was wonderfully pleasant and knowledgable. She bought us coffee because of the way we were treated when we first arrived. I will say my food was good and so was my cheesecake. I don't know that I'd ever visit this location again though..."
Rachael S.,"Watertown, MN",0,5,,5.0,3/27/2017,"My mother and I stopped in for an early dinner recently. Both hosts were very pleasant and greeted us with a smile. I was pleased we only waited about 5 minutes for a table (although even if we had waited longer, it's not the businesses fault that they are popular!). Our waiter was James F. He was extremely nice and prompt when we needed something. He had the perfect server personality, charming but not so charming that you can tell it's fake. He seemed genuinely concerned with making sure we were taken care of and enjoying our meals. The drinks from the bar were excellent and beautifully presented (they used all fresh mint, fruit, etc.). Food was great, including the pumpernickel bread or whatever it was that came free. We got the Cobb salad as an appetizer. The vinaigrette dressing was light but still flavorful and the avocado was soft and ripe. Will definitely order it next time. The cheesecake we took home was also bomb! One thing I appreciated was that we were there for almost 2.5 hours and James never made us feel like he was in a hurry for us to get out of there. I've worked in the service industry for a long time and understand the pain when tables ""camp out"" in your section. I even apologized to him but he assured us that we can stay as long as we want. Granted we did continue to order drinks and dessert so it's not like we were sitting there sipping waters for an hour or anything. I briefly chatted with someone who i assume was a manger of some sort, and he was very personable and outgoing. Overall I was super impressed with our experience! I was shocked to see The Cheesecake Factory only had 3 stars on Yelp, so I wanted to be sure to leave a review. The only thing that i was less than impressed with were the bathrooms. It was a bit unkept and most stalls were out of toilet paper (something that's understandable at 7:30pm mid dinner rush, but like I said it was like 4-5ish). I will definitely be back and will probably request James F!"
Jim L.,"Farmington, MN",774,351,8279,4.0,6/29/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to eat.  Nice portions, great food, cool atmosphere.  The decor is fun to look at.  The service is very good and snappy.  The food was simply delicious.   The down side of this place is it is the only one in Minnesota and it is in the Southdale Mall in Edina.  It is difficult to find a parking place close to the restaurant so plan on walking.  Ladies don't wear the uncomfortable fancy shoes that will kill your feet by the time you get there.  The other thing is there is NOT a call ahead or reservation system in place so you have hoards of people crowding the place to wait an hour for a table.  The crowds block the entry, hallways and make this a tough place to go during the prime time eating hours. They definitely need more of these around the Twin Cities.  The food service and decor is a draw, but the lack of parking, long waits and crowds are a real turn off.  Try to plan you meal earlier or later than the normal times and it will be a better experience.  I would stay away on Friday and Saturday nights, it is just too crowded, expect a long wait."
Sharifa H.,"Long Beach, CA",6,1,,1.0,8/2/2016,"Worst service ever! I called for take out and over an hour and forty-five minutes later, still no food. They were very nonchalant about the entire thing."
