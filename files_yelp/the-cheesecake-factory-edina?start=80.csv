Tony P.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,21,7,1.0,6/13/2016,"When going in the evening the lights are down low to the point you have to literally use your phones flashlight to read the oversized menu. I have definitely had some good tasting dishes and cheesecake but the Alfredo Chicken Pasta is horrible. There is literally no flavor whatsoever. I'd never waste 19.99 on noodles, can sauce, and a tiny piece of charred chicken. The cheesecake is also overpriced. $18 for 2 pieces? Come on!"
Ryan S.,"Lakeville, MN",0,39,,2.0,6/25/2015,"We normally love The Cheesecake Factory. The food and the service are usually great. This last time we were very disappointed in the temperature of the plates and the food. After the food runners brought our two kids meals and set them down in front of the children, they told us the plates were pretty warm and to be careful. I immediately moved the plate from in front of my 2 year old toddler and was astounded by how searing hot the plate was. I couldn't even manage to slide it over in front of me without using a folded napkin. My wife and I were both shocked that they would even consider serving children food on a plate that hot. It's weird because none of the food on the plate was very hot. It could have all been eaten immediately if it weren't for the ridiculously hot temperature of the plate.  Shortly after that our food came out, and again the plate was molten red hot magma temperature, but the food was barely above warm.  Seems like a silly thing to get worked up about, but the part that really made us mad was the manager Jennifer Madison's reaction to our concern about the plate temperatures for the kids meals.  She basically insinuated that we were terrible parents for not cutting our children's food and letting it cool before giving them the plates. (Even though HER runners are the ones that placed the plates in front of the children.) She stated that it was either company policy or a health code issue that required them to place all plates for service in the food window before being brought out to customers regardless of food type or age.  (Horse crap. I've eaten at PLENTY of restaurants where I've been served food on room temperature plates... and the food was actually hot to boot.) She gave off an air of indifference. I don't appreciate spending 90 dollars in your restaurant and then being told that our concern was not valid."
K S.,"Burnsville, MN",0,17,3,3.0,10/28/2015,"We have been here once before and the food was great! My husband and I went out to lunch today and decided to get a loaded tater tots appetizer. We were happily munching on said tots until my husband found a bolt/screw in the one he just popped in his mouth. Thankfully he discovered it before biting down too hard. So we flagged down a manager, just wanting for them to be informed of what we found in our food. He was very apologetic, took away the plate and asked if we wanted a new one, we declined. Our meals came and as we were eating the manager came and told us our whole bill will be comped. We didn't tell him about the screw to get a free meal, we actually felt bad eating for free so before we left we put down a generous tip ($20) for the server, because it wasn't his fault. We were about half way to our car when the server chased us down to tell us what we put on the table didn't cover our bill so Aaron said ""Talk to your manager. I found a bolt in my food and he said we didn't have to pay"" so my husband followed the server back in and told the server to get the manager. Unreal that the manager didn't communicate to the server what happened. That is the first thing that should have been done was to show the server the plate with the screw on it and to zero out our bill. That way we wouldn't have been chased down like dine-and-dashers. I told my husband  after we left that he should have asked for the tip back."
Sokim V.,"Minneapolis, MN",49,99,119,5.0,12/10/2015,"Such an advantage to have it minutes from the airport. We stopped by for calamari, Thai chicken wrap, filet, and cheesecake. It was delish!"
Deb A.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,32,,2.0,2/2/2017,"Was here many times before and this is the first time that the food both for my grandchild and for myself was barely ok.  I had fish and chips and both were meh warm.  I'm used to hot, right off the stove quality.  My grandson had hamburger and fries and they too were just warm, same quality. Both as if they had been sitting for awhile. I went Wednesday.  Disappointed. :("
Sarine J.,"Indianapolis, IN",211,147,86,4.0,8/17/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. I love the decorations, how large the portions are, how unhealthy and delicious everything is, and that the desserts are as big as my face. If you get the apple crisp, it is bigger than my face. When I go to this restaurant it is definitely a treat. I usually order from the skinny menu because I can't get myself to order from the regular menu. Well, that's also because I would rather eat dessert than the main dish anyway. During this visit, I shared the apple crisp and strawberry cheesecake with a few people. As mentioned before, the apple crisp was HUGE. I do think they have cut down on cheesecake slices. I remember them being so huge a few years back, but recently they are quite small and possibly not sharable. I'll be coming back here to treat myself from time to time. Everything is so delicious!"
Jerry M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,5,,3.0,2/19/2017,The first time was the best with excellent service and food. The other times weren't so great with how the food quality declined. Not sure if chefs struggle during busy hours or communications isn't up to standards. Regardless the Cheesecake Factory is still an amazing place to dine.
Rachel B.,"Minneapolis, MN",59,126,89,2.0,6/4/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains I really enjoy. That said, the Southdale Cheesecake Factory is lacking. One problem is simply that this is the only Cheesecake Factory in the state, so the place is always crazy crowded.  You absolutely have to eat here at an off time or you'll be waiting for an hour. The other problem is the service. For the most part, the hostesses and the servers treat their jobs like they work in, well, a factory. They see the customers as products to churn out on the production line as fast as possible before their shifts end. No friendliness or warmth, and they spend as little time at your table as possible, which means that orders get messed up.  Also, one server gave us an extremely nasty look when we ordered a lunch portion to share, even though everyone knows perfectly well that their lunch portions are enough to serve at least two people.   As for the insanely sized portions of rich food that everyone complains about, well, I'm not so put off by that. Yes, I realize that this place is almost a satire of American gluttony, but use common sense, people!  There's no Clean Plates Club at the Cheesecake Factory. Share a dish family style or bring home the leftovers. I did eat an entire slice of cheesecake once, but I was seven months pregnant, and unless ths is the case or unless you are having a VERY bad day, do not engage in such foolishness. Share. Also, order the avocado egg rolls before Michael Bloomberg tries to make these illegal.  These may be more decadent and joy-inducing than the cheesecake, and that's saying quite a bit."
Danielle J.,"Bloomington, MN",14,5,,5.0,1/12/2017,very good food and service despite how busy it was.  we waited an hour even tho they said itd be almost two. had the biscuits and gravy and it was amazing comfort food.  one could have fed two of us though!! yum!
Mike A.,"Rockwall, TX",18,33,,2.0,6/22/2016,"Good was good, I mean it was just lunch. The crappy part was we went there at 1136 for, you guessed it- lunch and they couldn't sit us...? So I asked why not and I was told that the servers were not there yet...whaaa? Didn't you guys open up at 1100? Then she mentions that a couple just came in and to wait five minutes. Screw that. The bartender was there and doing his thing so we sat at the bar and he was great. Maybe Gov Christie screwed with them coming to work. I know bad joke but seriously!"
Jared B.,"Minneapolis, MN",10,16,,2.0,3/22/2015,"Ugh. This is the ONLY Cheesecake Factory in all of Minnesota, so I guess we won't be going to Cheesecake Factory any longer. We ordered the following: Sausage and Ricotta Flatbread: Solid, although I wish there was a finer balance of sausage to cheese ratio. The sausage looked more ground up than what I'm used to (more like chorizo form). There were large chunks of ricotta, which was nice. Ahi Tuna Tartare: Also solid. I feel like Ahi Tuna and Pork Belly are falling into the same category. Sad day. But, I digress. It's a solid eat. Kale and Apple Salad: Again, solid. Light and airy. I would've preferred a few more of the fruit notes to come through. Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta: Meh. This is what my wife ordered. It's one of her favorites here. But, as we've come across better offerings, like Zelo, it's hard to say this is ""good"" anymore. Large chunks of tomatoes, four shrimp, and some angel hair pasta with a few chunks of garlic. Eggplant Parmesan: Sorry for the person who searched for this on Yelp expecting to find a review of it. I was excited to try this. Placed my order, and was told 15 minutes later that they ran out. The manager apologized but I was bit puzzled why it took so long to tell me. I was set on the eggplant. I couldn't really find anything to replace it. Ever notice that the cheesecake factory menu is mainly just chicken and cheesecake for the most part? I wasn't in the mood for chicken. So I went with fries. You know why I went with the fries? Because our server was just plain bad. She was nice, but just not good. Perhaps she was new? I don't know. Our appetizer plates were sitting on our table for a long period of time, no napkins, no straws, the issue with the eggplant, and the 15 minutes it took for us to actually pay our check. She asked another waitress to clear our table but didn't communicate to her that we had just had appetizers and they took all of our silverware away assuming we were moving on to dessert.  The table next to us complained about her when we sat down. Thought they were blowing it out of proportion. Nope."
Abhijeet A.,"Bellevue, WA",7,12,,4.0,10/3/2015,"I liked their Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta with lots of grated cheese on it. By my recent visit I had stopped eating meat so I asked the server to replace chicken with Broccoli+Mashroom that tasted even more awesome ! And the salted caramel cheese cake was amazing,"
Ariel L.,"Manila, Philippines",79,70,966,5.0,8/21/2014,"This place has not disappointed me even before I was yelping. Make sure you leave room for their great selection of cheesecakes and by the way, the only Gluten Free option is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake ... how awesome is that! They also have a full menu of low calorie options collected in a separate menu. There are a huge selection of options so make sure while you're waiting to borrow a menu. There are long waits during weekends but it's also by the mall so you can window shop while waiting. If you have kids, they even decorate the desert plate with a happy birthday written on chocolate sauce! Again, an awesome place!"
Carla A.,"Fayetteville, NC",34,5,,3.0,7/10/2016,The restaurant is nice.  The atmosphere is great but they cut your cheesecake thinner then other cheesecake factories. I feel like if I'm going 2 pay $8.50  for a slice of cheesecake then cut me a decent slice. Customer service was decent.
Elikia J.,"Minneapolis, MN",71,11,,5.0,12/16/2015,"We love Ashley!!! Best bartender ever !!!  She is kind, educated about the menu and always has amazing recommendations. It's like she can read your mind as far as what you desire and don't on the menu.  My boyfriend and I go almost every Monday for date night. We love sitting at the bar. The passion fruit margarita is fabulous. My boyfriend loves the coffee selections.  The Cheesecake Factory has a very extensive menu and something on it for anyone ! I enjoy the salads and I special order the Chicken Di Pana with extra broccoli.  I believe that, if you want to search for the bad in something you will find it. Fortunately the worst thing I have to say about the staff and menu at the cheese cake factory is that it's amazing. That's it guys ! Check it out with an open mind and make sure to sit at the bar and have an amazing experience with Ashley or Ivan."
David C.,"Chanhassen, MN",0,11,1,1.0,1/30/2016,"We called in the morning to make  a reservation at 5:00 for a birthday gathering for my wife's father, but Cheesecake Factory said that they wouldn't take reservations. My wife and were told there wouldn't be any problem getting in at 5:00. We arrived at 4:45, and there was a one and a half to two hour wait.   Needless to say, our plans were ruined. They shouldn't have told us that we could get in; we could  have made other plans. My recommendation: don't go here on a weekend evening unless  you're prepared for, and don't mind a two hour wait."
Sam V.,"Chippewa Falls, WI",0,24,,2.0,3/10/2016,I would like to say to food taste was great Great job kitchen staff. But have to say this restaurant has gone down hill like a lot of the establishments here in Edina Mn .I am not sure how these restaurants get away with serving dirty dishes to the customer and management and the health department thinks it's ok . I have been a professional Chef for over 10 years and that would not fly in any of my restaurants. Accidents happen but to have five count it three forks a plate and food in the water glass that I never drank out of. That should tell you how many people our eating with dirty utensils at this establishment . I would warn the public beware someone is going to get sick and the manager does not care .  SO PLEASE BE SAFE IF YOU TAKE THE CHANCE AND EAT IN EDINA MN YOUR MAY BE SORRY LATER.
Carrie P.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,3,,1.0,3/6/2015,after being on hold for 15 mins. I called back and asked to speak with a manager...(Jen) who was quite snotty herself took my order and said 15-25 mins... 50 mins and $60 later my food was ready - finally. BTW my car was running in takeout parking. I finally get home and it literally looks like some thrown together slop....  never again cheesecake factory edina. I'm so disappointed.
Celeste H.,"Eden Prairie, MN",1,9,,3.0,6/8/2016,"The wait time was incredibly long, but sometimes that happens. The food was great, however our waitress was very snappy and did not care to give us the time or the courtesy to take our time to decide on what we wanted. She mainly just wanted to get us out as soon as possible to bring another group in. Other than that experience, we enjoyed the food and the environment."
Christine M.,"Minneapolis, MN",119,4,,5.0,6/6/2016,"Had an amazing dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, the Thai lettuce wraps for an appetizer were amazing, and so big! The food came right after our appetizer. The whole experience was fast and delicious and our serve was perfect! Our drinks were to die for too!"
