T L.,"Pflugerville, TX",4,53,2,4.0,1/9/2018,"There's usually a wait but wasn't too bad this time.  The warm bread was good, so was the soup of the day. The pasta with shrimp and sausage was great. The portions were big so would be great for two people to share a plate."
Alcohol U.,"Chicago, IL",208,31,3,2.0,12/29/2017,"Not sure why I bother to review a place that is loved by so many who wouldn't dream of giving less than 4 stars, well not this bloke. I'm giving them 2 and that is being generous. Not sure what staff and managers think at the establishment. Maybe they think Mall traffic, so shitty service and behaviour is ok? That could be one possibility. Food is ok. I'll give them that. Service and attitude needs to change. Clearly. Just imagine, if they weren't at the local mall, what would it be like? Oh, and if you're thinking about ordering a slice of cheesecake to go, make sure you scream as loud as you can because people behind the counter are either deaf, or blind. I'm thinking both. I was always under the impression common sense was a common thing but as time goes by, I tend to think it is all bunch of hogwash! You could be standing there with a credit card out in the hand ready to be swiped trying to order and person behind the counter stares at you like you're there to inconvenience them. My final thought- It's not called mind reading, but more like paying attention to visual cues. I bet they don't teach that at the Cheesecake Academy.  That's all I got! Thanks for reading!"
Esther C.,"Moorestown, NJ",176,21,10,2.0,12/19/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Usually the staff are quick and kind whenever I go but here they are kind of slow to be honest. It wasn't busy at all when I was here yet it took like 10 mins for someone to ask us for our drinks and another 10 to get the drinks and then another 10 to place our order. Utensils were dirty/water marked on top and the bases were handled by someone who's fingers were definitely greasy. Our waitress was an older lady and she was rude. Every single time we needed something she just ran past us while we asked and she gave us a ""yup!"" Or ""okay!"" I was honestly giving three reviews but I dropped a star just for her. We finally needed the check and while we just said ""excuse me?"" And she was like ""give me a minute"" while she brushed us off. A young group of college students yeah sure but we are paying customers. We are polite and respectful and actually tip a decent amount wherever we go but this lady brushed us and tossed us to the side and it was obvious. All brushing off and you'd think that she would be running around being busy but nope she didn't even bring our food out to us. The two gentlemen who did were kinder and more accommodating than she was.  10% not because we are college students, 10% because you were bad at your job."
Jackie S.,"Staten Island, NY",110,148,489,3.0,9/3/2017,"This location is on the outside of Menlo Park mall and it's always busy! The wait times can be hours before being seated. However , we were seated right away on a Friday afternoon. My friend and I were seated at a small two seater table that was almost on top of the next table. Felt too close for comfort as I thought the next table could hear our whole conversation. So I asked to be switched to a booth. The waitress then seemed bothered by that. We were off to a good start - we got our drinks promptly. However, the waitress seemed frantic with too many tables to attend too. We had to ask for bread, water, and silverware. She was not attentive at all. Maybe all of three times- to get our drink order, to get our lunch order, and to deliver the food. It seems they may be lacking in staff or could use a few bus boys.  To start we ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes which is topped with sour cream, salsa, avocado and salsa verde. I really wish we didn't order this because I felt like absolute death the whole day after. It's so filling and rich I wouldn't order it again.  From the skinnylicious menu I ordered the ahi tartare which is raw tuna with avocado and a soy-ginger sesame sauce. This was good but it could have used a few more of the chips it came out with. There were only 4. My friend also ordered from the skinny menu she got the chicken lettuce wrap tacos in the Asian style. She loved those.  I used to love Cheesecake Factory but it seems like it's going downhill. The staff is inattentive and seems as though your bothering them. Also the food is lacking in all aspects. It's a no from me Cheesecake Factory."
Maria B.,"Colonia, NJ",0,11,,4.0,1/8/2018,The food is awesome ! The wait is pretty long but so worth it ! I recommend it the corn tamale as an appetizer ! Sooo good ! The bread is also awesome and i love that it's warm !!
Puneet D.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",205,15,12,4.0,1/5/2018,I've gone here many times and usually the wait time is long on weekends. I like to call ahead and order some cheesecake and pick up for takeout. Never had any issues with this.
Katrine R.,"Bridgewater, NJ",234,63,120,4.0,8/29/2017,"I'm less inclined to write reviews on chain restaurants, but I felt like this one deserved a review. I had lunch here last weekend and since the weather was so beautiful out, I requested for outdoor seating. You could tell everyone had the same idea because the place was getting more and more crowded after we sat down. Our waitress (forgot her name) was super nice - she took great care of us. Despite the abrupt change of pace, she still managed to accommodate us. I ordered the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken while my brother ordered the Macaroni & Cheese Burger. First off, let me say that after reading the description for my dish, I didn't really think anything of it. I just knew I was hungry and needed food ASAP. Luckily for me, the food didn't take long to arrive. Looking at my dish, (let's be honest) I'd say it wasn't really an eye-catching type of dish. Presentation could have used some work, but after my first bite, I was taken back!! The flavors on this plate was phenomenal. The portion size was huge! This could have easily been a dish for two people but no complaints here. I took my leftovers home, only to have it for lunch the next day. My brother definitely enjoyed his food as well, he basically inhaled his food to say the least. I wish all my prior visits to Cheesecake Factory were as pleasant as this one. I'm sure all other locations are good too, but I have a feeling I'll be visiting this one more often than the others."
Jeannie C.,"New York, NY",1,12,29,5.0,1/8/2018,"I love this place. I never have had a bad experience here. The food is good the atmosphere is nice. The waits are expected. You are going to have a wait on a Saturday night, if you don't want that this isn't a good place to go. The cheesecake is so good it takes me so long to pick one! The Mac and cheese balls are a must have. Without a doubt the best thing on the menu."
Markisha W.,"North Fort Lauderdale, Tamarac, FL",0,4,1,4.0,1/8/2018,Cheesecake Factory menu overall is overwhelming so many pages of food. I stick to my shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta one of the best places to have scampi from their breaded shrimp is everything !
Amber B.,"Hudson County, NJ",625,277,749,3.0,6/9/2017,"I like the Cheesecake Factory and despite my review (sadly) I would probably visit again (perhaps just not this location). I came here with a party of 7 on a late Friday evening. We got there about 9 and we were told that it would be a 30 minute wait, cool no big deal. In about 40 minutes we were finally seated. Our waitress took longer than usual to come and introduce herself and that was a bit annoying because it was already late. When she finally decided it was time to show her face she only asked us what we would like to drink (and you could imagine she took her time with that too) Also, the famous Cheesecake Factory bread wasn't delivered until we asked.  Our food just as you could imagine took all night just to get to us. Very mediocre to say the least. I ordered loaded tots and they were not at all how I imagined them. The wings were also a let down. If the service was better I would be able to justify some things but the service was a very big let down on this particular night."
Tiffany M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",248,121,230,4.0,6/15/2017,Hi Yelpers!  This place has been my go to place for my birthday since I turned 21! Though this year finally broke the stretch since I went over to Kona (sorry Cheesecake!) however I still adore this place because of the quality of the food.  Always fresh and very tasty. I'm a huge fan of their pastas! I guess this place also has sentimental value because of my birthday but its a great place. Downside is that it get crazy packed with parking. Terribly. It's shared with the mall and people love this place so never come here on a Friday or a Saturday. Thankfully my birthday has fallen generally on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Also the cheesecake is BOMB! I just had the coffee swirl something and it was amazing. Perfect combo of creamy cheesecake and coffee---definitely something to sip with espresso.
Natalie W.,"South Plainfield, NJ",331,71,525,3.0,4/26/2017,"Came out to the Cheesecake factory for my Sisters Birthday Dinner. I want to give the place a 2 But our Server (Carlo) and Host make it hard to do that because they were awesome.  It's been said to always start off with a positive so I will do that. GOOD- The house Chardonnay is crispy, not very Oaky, $36 a bottle and Wonderful - The server Carlo was very professional -Cheesecake was heavenly AWFUL - When we sat down to dinner all the Cutlery was wet and My 2 Forks had Wet Lettuce on it and Murky water. (HAIR RAISING SCENE), Someone actually set the cutlery in order and missed ALL of that detail  . It was so dark in there someone could have easily not seen the filth  (a child) RIDICULOUS- Immediately asked for the manager (LEO) and after they couldn't find him for 10 mins  (they said he was outside) He approaches us abruptly and in super defense mode .  He looked annoyed took my cutlery and had someone else send new clean one's  over in less than five minutes.  Normally when there is a problem the manager personally comes back to make sure everything is well . Nope not this guy he never returned and passed us several times with no regard. Most of our food came out Room temperature and they have the audacity to have done a recent price increase which is fine if the EXPERIENCE matches the cost. Shame on Menlo location.   Cheesecake and Wine for me only if I return  Thank God for our server who did his best to make up for the lacking experience"
Shanda D.,"Marshfield, VT",66,106,151,3.0,12/6/2017,"I don't really like chain restaurants, but this one seems to be okay.  I haven't had any issues with service or food, but think it is a bit overpriced for the theme.  However, what I like most is the ambiance and the huge open feel of the restaurant.  I really like the way it looks fancy, but is moderate for the money.  I just have to say that this is a chain restaurant that is really just good for dessert ( Cheesecake and ice cream, cookies, ) and sometimes live entertainment.  Last I knew they had karaoke on one of the week nights and they awarded prizes!  I remember having fun  :-)"
Maricia H.,"Caldwell, NJ",141,199,418,3.0,5/21/2017,"I have avoided cheesecake factory since I had a bad experience at another establishment, but I really wanted desert and I knew that their cheesecake is always on point.  The visit was short, but overall pretty good. We ordered fried zucchini, which we had to send back because it was not cooked. The server offered to redo it, but when chose not to and to just have coffee and cheese cake. After all, that is what we originally came for. It was great. Whip cream is everyone and the caramel coffee was a great compliment to the salted Carmel cheesecake.  I will say that they need to work on keeping the place tidy. I step on butter rapper that was on the floor and I was almost down for the count."
Kathy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,66,517,1.0,12/3/2017,"I was dying to come here since i heard many good things about the cheesecake factory. I came with my coworkers for lunch during a conference in NJ. I was so excited to finally eat at ""THE AMAZING CHEESECAKE FACTORY""...WOW My dreams were utterly crushed. I was very disappointed with my dish (bang bang chicken). It lacked flavor and just plain ole bland. My coworkers did not enjoy their dishes either. It varied from a dried cubano to flavorless shrimp. The service could also use some help. I still can't believe that all the hype was unreal. I dont think i will be back anytime soon."
Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",194,488,2568,3.0,9/4/2017,I have been to this place a few times. It was the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant that I have been to. They were normally pretty crowded. Food wasn't bad overall. The quality of cheesecake was better than other locations.
Tania M.,"Elizabeth, NJ",2,22,,4.0,1/3/2018,"So good !! I always enjoy the food here - the portions are huge ! Good pricing ... only bad thing about this particular restaurant is - the seating ! If you're not lucky to get a booth , you might get stuck sitting reallllllllly close to a stranger ."
Mike M.,"Manhattan, NY",237,424,309,5.0,3/11/2017,Ive grown to love The Cheesecake Factory. It wasn't immediate but now its real. You too may not immediately come to love this place as there's a hangup that you need to forgive/forget in order to truly appreciate the factory. Be prepared to wait 1 - 2 hours to get a table during a typical dinner rush on a Friday or Saturday which is why I now only go during the week and get a table instantly each time. You may think that its not worth the wait for a corporate franchise type restaurant but I kid you not this place is the $hit!. Ive been to this place well over a dozen times and always leave pleased and extremely full. Their portions are YUUUGGGEEE. My Tip: Sunday through Thursday for dinner. I recommend nearly everything on the menu.
Amy S.,"New York, NY",7,53,74,3.0,12/3/2017,One of my fav places to dine if I'm at the mall. Stopped in yesterday just to pick up my $25 gift card so I could get the free slice of cheesecake.  The free slice must be redeemed between 1/1/18 and 3/31/18.  Also sampled a peppermint cheesecake. Very rich and minty.
Jennifer D.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",1994,646,2274,2.0,2/27/2017,"I really cannot understand why this place is so popular, especially this location. My friend had received a gift card (again) for Christmas so hey why not enjoy a free meal :) We went to see a movie and came here after. The wait on a Sunday at 6pm was 40 minutes. We sucked it up because of the gift card and waited. I've been to this location before and there is always a similar wait. There really isn't a great place to wait. There are a few benches but not enough for all of the people waiting.   When our table was ready we were seated by the bar. For some reason the floor was really slippery and greasy. I ordered a coke and was told the bar was out of coke. They had a few new dishes on a special menu so me & my friend decided to order the salad. Our waiter said we couldn't change anything about the salad off the menu. No removing anything!  Not even dressing. So instead we just ordered off their regular, 345 page menu.  We both chose the avocado salad and added chicken. Instead we got a salad with guacamole on top. Not quite the same but nice try. This is the third time we've ordered a dish with avocado and either received little or no avocado. I'm not sure why they don't just stop trying to sell dishes with avocados.  On top of everything from the start of our wait until we finished dinner was almost 3 hours!  For a 40 min wait. Two people ordering salad and 1 dessert. You do the math with all the waiting.  The only reason we keep coming back is because my friend keeps getting gift cards. This place is probably one of my least favorite chains. Not sure what's worse...the poor, SLOW, service or the misrepresented food."
AMANDA R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,46,82,3.0,8/22/2017,"Cheesecake factory is one of those places I go to when I don't know what i want to eat but want to eat good amounts of food. It's sort of a hit or miss. Some meals are great and others not so much.  The good thing about this place, is they have everything under the sun. You want it, they have it. All tucked away in their somewhat of a 20 page menu.  Although I give it three stars I do still dine here from time to time. Some tips: -Try and look over the menu online so you have a better idea of what you'd like. Looking at the menu for the first time seated is overwhelming  -if you're thinking of going Friday to Sunday at night be prepared to wait about an hour. Reccomendations: Garlic cheesy bread to start! It is one of the best I've had it comes out as a loaf of Italian bread and you get to pull it apart and watch the cheese and garlic spill out The Cajun chicken and French fries. It's basically chicken fingers and French fries but it comes with so much. It can be shared between two people for sure and it only cost about $14 The chicken fetucce is very good and tasty.  The burgers are always good I do not recommend: The cheesecake, I know I know that's the whole point. It's not my favorite cheesecake to be honest, it's dense and heavy and doesn't seem to taste fresh. I've given it a few chances but doesn't do it for me. This is for the plain cheesecake I have yet to try other flavors. Although I give this place three stars I do come dine here from time to time, as long as I avoid the long lines during busy hours and know what I'd like to eat in advance then it's usually a good time."
Anthony G.,"Edison, NJ",242,48,650,2.0,7/31/2017,"I stopped by last night after Point Pleasant to grab dinner. I was greeted by a friendly host and was told it would only be 10-15 minutes before I would be seated outside on the patio. I joked around with her about free cheesecake considering it was National Cheesecake day. She told me it was half off slices for dine in (no limit) and even joked around about how people should just get a table but are ordering takeout slices and are allowed one slice at 50% off. My table was finally ready after only ten minutes and I was lead to the patio by another host.  After a couple of minutes at the table I was introduced to my waitress and she asked me if I knew what I wanted to drink and if I wanted to order an app. I ordered a water to start off and needed a few minutes to look at the menu. A couple minutes passed and my server was back to take my order; I decided on a side house salad tossed in vinaigrette and the Tuscan Chicken off their Skinnylicious Menu sub brown rice instead of the farro.  She advised me that the serving of rice was going to be small and suggested she bring me an additional side of rice but I was ok with the size of the serving.  About five minutes after she took my order, my salad and fresh bread came out but as I was ready to dig in, I had no silverware or napkin. I eventually flagged down another server, since mine was no where in sight, that rushed to get me utensils and a napkin and he apologized even though it wasn't his fault. So I start eating my salad and not half way through it, my meal comes out. I feel like the timing between the courses were input correctly hence the overlapping. I like to finish the app and then the dinner come out after I've finished.  I'm enjoying dinner but wish I had some more water. 3/4s of the way into my dinner my server comes back and tells me she is going to refill my water and then asks me if I am enjoying the entrée.  At the point I didn't feel like a welcomed guest. To make things even worse as far as the service went, I finished my meal and, no exaggeration, waited 15 minutes before she appeared to ask me if I wanted dessert and/or coffee but she didn't even stop at the table. She acknowledged me in passing as she was heading to another table.  I declined and just asked for the check. Another 10 minutes go by and another server brings the check and at this point I was completely unsatisfied with the service.  I can't believe it took 30 mins after my meal just to settle the bill. I was generous with the tip and come to think of it, I shouldn't have left one."
Armiyela T.,"South Plainfield, NJ",1,31,115,3.0,11/5/2017,"Came here today at around 2pm for late lunch. Of course it's packed especially today was a sunday. The wait wasn't bad for 2 people, 20 mins which was shockingly fast! Ok for the food part. Ordered calamari and buffalo wings for appetizers. Calamari was good but the chicken wasn't so tender and no spice whatsoever at all. For the main course, ordered a steak diane and herb crusted salmon combination. The salmon lacked flavor in my opinion. As for the steak diane, I ordered it medium well and it came medium with the obvious blood coming out of the pieces of steak.  So i sent it back. By the time I got the steak back, I was already full so I just got it to go. Last time I came to this location I ordered the steak diane alone and I ordered it medium well and came to me as super well done! I probably won't be back to this location for awhile."
Marissa Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",739,1111,1531,3.0,7/26/2017,I think this place is just okay the ones in Las Vegas are a lot easier to get into since we have three locations and so many other options to eat at this is usually just a place to stop in last minute but for a lot of people I noticed that this is the special occasion type place Although I do think that the food portions are large in this establishment period and my favourite dish is the miso salmon know that you can get a lunch portion for cheaper but the server that you have what always give you the larger one Tonight we had dinner at seasons 52 and it was wonderful my bill was literally $32 and we came here for desert to go and I swear to God it was over $16 just for two slices of cheese cake to go I think that's an astronomical price to ask You can get better cheesecake at the Coachouse diner in North Bergen This is why I get upset because you give me a bill for $16 for two slices of cheese cake and when I get home the slices are so tiny it makes me hate this place But whatever to me this place is not something that fancy I just don't like being ripped off
Scott S.,"Hoboken, NJ",104,213,,2.0,1/6/2018,"I've always been a cheesecake factory fan - fun, pretty good food, awesome cheesecakes...although I'm so curious...why does every single Cheesecake Factory have this unbelievably slippery floor not found at any other dining establishment in the continental United States?  Anyway, back to Menlo Park... I was excited to hit up the factory after doing some holiday shopping - Naturally the place was packed but grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartender was so friendly and fantastic. Good start....However, once my lettuce wraps app arrived and i grabbed my little utensil pack, there was like a big piece of lettuce or cabbage or something stuck on the fork that didn't come off in the wash.  ew.  not the end of the world, but still, a bit gross...don't want to be reminded of the mediocre cleaning process that plates and silverware go through before i use them. I ask for a new fork and we are back in business. Everything went well after that - my guiltless tacos made me feel like i was in Puebla, Mexico (well not really, but they were still good). So, after the meal in the holiday spirit, we decided to give our server a cash tip (over 30%) and the rest of the bill on the card. Well well well, what happened next was my real issue with this establishment. Now, if you are someone who views Yelp as just a bitchfest for disgruntled venting customers, look no further, you've come to the right place. So some sneaky little devil at the restaurant decided to add a credit card tip on to the bill, thinking I wouldn't notice it. This obviously annoyed me, but not as much as what came after. We contacted the restaurant to ask for a manger. Manger came on the phone and couldn't give two shits....said he would find out about it and call back (not really caring about the criminal behavior or how this upset customers). After not hearing back, we called again - this time an office manager handled it and said there was no record from the prior manager, and offered a $25 gift card (which would be net $10 after the fradulent tip). okay, just buy your customers satisfaction. anyway, she at least made it seem like she cared..something to the tune of ""im sorry this happened to you"". Needless to say, a gift card never arrived (which i don't really want anyway), because with management like this, it's a reflection of the management of the corporation as a whole, and this lack of integrity probably spills over into other areas, lets say, cleanliness for example.  sooo i'll probably still eat at the factory, but certainly not this one."
Victor C.,"Linden, NJ",0,2,5,4.0,10/8/2017,It's a great place to eat and have fun. Just a little tip-go early since it gets packed really quick. If you like steak and shrimp I got the perfect combination STEAK DIANE AND SHRIMP SCAMPI with mashed potatoes.  Prices are ok if you don't go every week. Food has always been good quality and we have tried other dishes as well food is always fresh and plentiful enough to share
maria r.,"Hazlet, NJ",9,166,325,5.0,11/4/2017,"Love love love this place. It took me a while to get past the name...lol, but once you eat here, you realize it's not just cheesecake. Their fresh bread is my favorite. Their soups are tasty and filling. Their dishes are always large portions ( great for sharing ). And of course their so many cheesecake and other desserts to choose from. Service is very attentive and the space always feels cozy for such a huge restaurant. Sadly they are always located by a mall, so not always near to my home. But one of my go to places if I want to be sure to get a great filling meal."
Maulik M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",189,210,541,2.0,1/2/2017,"This place is part of Menlo Park Mall and it's always crazy busy. The wait time on weekends or even some weekdays can turn into 40-60 minutes to get a table for large group. After a disjointed start where the hostess and waitress didn't communicate well, we had to wait 40 minutes for four people on weekend brunch. We finally gave up on waiting for table and got a seat near bar area. Our food arrived quickly and we felt like we were rushed to eat and get out.  Last but no least, Parking lot issues. It's not their fault that the lot is always packed, but maybe they could learn a thing or two from NYC stackable parking lots (up to 5 cars hoisted one atop the other). noisy atmosphere. cheesecake size was large but at $7.00 a piece it should be. None of us will return for a while. I have had much better and at kinder prices."
Olivia M.,"Herndon, VA",0,13,215,4.0,11/30/2017,"OMG! I love this place  and it's so much more than just cheesecakes. I've been to 3 Cheesecake Factories in Usa already and I always return with a happy and filled tummy  So my first visit to this chain was a wonderful experience and looking at their expansive menu I knew I had to keep coming back coz I wanted to savour every delicious dish  Friday afternoon lunch time and my colleague and I waited over 20 mins for a table. The restaurant was so crowded, service did get affected. We were brought the bread basket but with only 2 pieces of bread  since they were not able to bake enough to keep up with the demand and guests pouring in. My colleague ordered a drink which was delicious   I ordered the steak Diane and herb crusted salmon combo since I wasn't able to chose between the 2. They did goof up my order and served me shrimp scampi instead of salmon. I realised after 5 minutes and informed another server, they did get me my salmon after 15 mins but by then I was done. Beef steak was so tasty specially with the mushroom, I finished it before the shrimp though seafood is my first love. Shrimp was well cooked but only 3 small sized shrimps were served. The salmon  which I had later at home was delicious  My colleague ordered a veg pasta carbonara which was really tasty.  Their portions (other than combos) are pretty large. To finish off the meal I ordered a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake  wow! This gluten free cheesecake will make you fall in love with chocolate all over again  Overall a good meal though service could've been better. Prices are on the higher side. A slice of cheesecake is 8$ and above including tax. Our meal cost around $ 60."
John L.,"Edison, NJ",0,22,6,2.0,11/22/2017,They screwed up by bringing my entrée out BEFORE my appetizer. Very poor management here.
Carrie H.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",230,242,398,2.0,6/11/2017,"Arrived this morning at 10am opening with party of 6.  Made waitstaff aware that we were meeting up after several years so our visit would be lengthy Waitstaff we dealt with seemed clueless.  Had to ask for water...waited and waited.  Had to ask a bus boy.  When we asked for straws from another because we didn't see our waitress again they looked at us and said ""straws?"" Like we were speaking a foreign language It seemed like each thing we asked for took forever and waitstaff always had an excuse.  Ordered peach bellinis and waited 30 minutes and was told oh sorry the bar is backed up.  They came Frozen... I didn't ask for frozen. ... that's all we have.  Well why didn't the waitress say they're frozen, is that okay?   All I could get was ""I'm sorry"". How about can I get you something else?   When our brunch came there was confusion over what it was.  Who got which one etc.    waiting for our waitstaff was painful and had to ask for every single thing twice.    Can definitely write this place off!"
Ammara T.,"Bellevue, WA",63,104,56,5.0,10/5/2017,"This is my favorite place for any pasta cravings or homestyle meals. The service is always amazing even though there are long wait times on the weekends, but it's worth it for the  quality. The free fresh bread is always a plus to keep you going before the main entrees. We came here on a Wednesday night so luckily no wait and were taken straight to our table. I ordered the Miso Salmon with Mashed Potatoes and green beans which is an absolute refreshing delight and healthy in some ways minus the creamy potatoes. The best part about Cheesecake Factory is you can customize or substitute almost anything and they're accommodating. My husband got the Parmesan Chicken which is also delicious with Mashed Potatoes and green beans on the side. For our appetizer we ordered the chicken samosa's which are filled with flavor but are quite pricey for $7 for only 4 small pieces but overall yummy! I would come here again in a heartbeat with the extensive menu there's bound to be something to please anyone."
Megan E.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",10,131,20,4.0,5/17/2017,"This was my first time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is quite large and spacious. Since it's at a mall, it was definitely busy but we were seated right away at 6:00 PM on a Wednesday night. As we left, the restaurant definitely became more occupied. Our server greeted us within minutes with the soup of the day and took our drink orders. She gave us plenty of time to look over the menu ourselves after offering help. She remembered our orders without even writing them down and repeated to us exactly what we ordered (which I always find impressive of a server). I noticed her do the same thing to a table of 7!  Food was prepared very well. The darker bread (possibly pumpernickel) was fantastic. My dad had a medium rare filet mignon which was perfectly tender and juicy. I had a salmon and steak combo with mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked asparagus.  The cheesecake menu is a little overwhelming only because there are so many! But they did not disappoint! A different server came and took our dessert orders. She was really fun!  Overall, it was a great dinner & I'd come again."

Alessandra D.,"Flanders, NJ",158,67,15,4.0,4/10/2017,"Cheesecake is my favorite restaurant of all time but I was so disappointed with my experience last night. The wait was only 20 minutes so I went to the bar which wasn't overly crowded at the moment. I apologized to the patrons sitting at the bar eating because I had to go in between them for my drink. I asked the bartender for the check to pay because my buzzer was going off to be seated, and I stood there awkwardly waiting to pay in between these women just trying to enjoy their meal. I tried getting her attention to pay but she was running back and forth taking care of the service tickets, and I did not want to leave cash there, so I took the check and asked my server if he could transfer the balance to the bill. He questioned why I did not pay at the bar and I explained what happened, handed the check and money to him and he took care of it for me.  The server was great, I apologize I forgot his name (John or JR maybe) and he effortlessly took care of us with exceptional service. Thanks for the enjoyable night out :)"
Veronica G.,"Linden, NJ",7,12,1,3.0,12/14/2017,"I have tried this place three times and personally, i don't really understand the hype about this place. Like it's a nice place but really all they got going for them is the cheesecake, which is very good. As for the food, nothing special, way too pricey for nothing special though. However i must say it is very filling, especially the burgers. Customer service could've been better in my opinion. Only thing i would be beware of is they don't take reservations ! However, if it is a dinner party they MAY make an exception to holding some seats for you at a specified time, depending on the manager and the occasion. (Also be careful because the floors are very slippery and it is dark in there!)"
Alicja P.,"South Amboy, NJ",4,14,38,4.0,6/4/2017,"For me, The Cheesecake Factory is a consistently pleasant experience. The food is always good with options galore for every type of foodie, they have lot of drinks to choose from and of course, the dessert menu is a highlight.  This location is busy but huge so seating is rarely a problem. This time around, I waited 2 minutes for a Sunday night dinner for two. Our waitress was extremely pleasant and attentive despite the many tables she was waiting on and the food was as good as I expected it to be. It was my friend's first time at a Cheesecake Factory and she loved it. We ordered the Eggroll Sampler for an app - such a good selection. Entrees are very big and I always end up taking leftovers home.  Cheesecake Factory is a classic with constantly good food and service."

Rangy A.,"Sayreville, NJ",4,10,6,2.0,3/23/2017,"I was here last night and ordered my usual entree which is Teriyaki Chicken. After eating half of the entree, I decided to bring the other half for lunch at work. I have noticed that the chicken was not fully cook --- so I have been eating a raw chicken last night?!! why I didn't notice this when I was at Cheesecake?!! UPDATE: C'mon Cheesecake Factory - you never learned from your mistakes. Ordered a teriyaki chicken to go and guess what - not well cooked. I still ate it but it's disgusting."
