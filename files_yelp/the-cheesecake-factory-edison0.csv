M T.,"New York, NY",9,46,37,3.0,4/24/2016,"Long waits, average food quality, and only a few wait staff members are attentive to customers. On some of my visit there with some friends we were not given any napkins and when we asked for it we were told that they had run of napkins - I had to ask if they were also out of paper napkins (an attentive server would have given paper napkins without being asked)."
Steve L.,"Staten Island, NY",2,25,68,5.0,4/15/2016,"Nothing compares to this gourmet chain. Their food, chain wide, is always consistent no matter if you order it in New Jersey or California. I've traveled all over & know what to expect no matter which location I'm in. I can honestly say I love almost everything on their menu. The portion size is alway huge. You get a lot for your money. I've found that if you'd actually like to order dessert, the best thing to do is share an appetizer & a main course with someone. My family & I love the fact that this chain constantly changes out items on their menu to keep the choices fresh, and also to improve already successful dishes, where as other chains stagnate with the same boring menu for years. For starters, we've narrowed down the appetizers to the Factory Chopped Salad, Avocado Eggrolls, & lastly the Buffalo Chicken Strips. We order them without the spicy Buffalo sauce, dry, but love the extra chunky Blue Cheese dressing & the celery with it. For the main courses we always love having the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. It's wonderfully done with a light lemon zest that really sparkles. It's served up with their mashed potatoes & asparagus. A second dish that's a must for those pasta lovers is the Tomato Basil Pasta , it's grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, a touch of garlic and penne pasta that's cooked to perfection, al dente, WOW !!! If you've left some room, any dessert is incredible. You can't go wrong with any choice. In my family (4) of us, we all have our own favorites making it a very hard decision to just pick 1 or 2. Our favorites are: Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, my wife's favorite. Oreo Cheesecake & the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake are my children's favorites. Lastly my favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae. It's a fabulous Godiva chocolate brownie, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds with triangular slices of chocolate. Absolutely to die for. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to any location. The decor is wonderful at all locations, making a nice place to go with friends or family."
Jim B.,"Middletown, NJ",0,19,,5.0,4/10/2016,"There is a reason for the long waits each night, the place is fantastic.  Had the fish tacos and it was great.  All of the portion sizes were generous and the flavors were spot on.  The service was excellent.  Finally, the price was reasonable given what we received.  if you have the time to wait it is well worth the visit."
Susan W.,"Downtown, San Antonio, TX",276,16,1,3.0,10/31/2015,"I have been wondering on a 3 or 4 star review.... I decided to go with 3.  I used to LOVE cheesecake factory. A few years ago I would've given it a 5. But quality in food has gone down, in my opinion.  I would get the factory loaded nachos, with chicken. The last few times I went, the cheese had a different t consistency. It doesn't taste like real cheese anymore. Now it taste like cheese wiz (yuck). I'm not spending $15 on cheese wiz. You shouldn't either. Everything else has always been satisfactory. They are a little pricey, but the menu selection is amazing! So many things to choose from!!! Alcoholic drinks: way too overpriced and not strong, like at all. I don't even feel like I had an alcoholic beverage when I leave. Not that I am looking to get 'smashed' when going, but you know!!! Service has always been great. One waitress specifically stands out. Her name is Lauren. She is attention, super friendly and adorable (no, I don't like girls lol)."
Michael M.,"Union County, NJ",2014,134,823,4.0,11/6/2014,"I am not one for chain restaurants, but this is cheesecake factory, exceptions can be made. The food is always prepared well and  tasty. Portions are Very large. So be prepared to leave stuffed. Menu has a very wide selection such as the XL salads, filet minion to fish dishes. Make sure you save some room for the cheese cake. That in itself has its own menu. Only down fall is the wait for seating on the weekends. Be prepared to stand-by anywhere from 30 to well over an hour. Weeknights are never a problem. Staff is very helpful and very attentive for the most part."
Pooja K.,"Auburn Hills, MI",46,282,136,3.0,4/7/2015,"Walked in on a tuesday evening and were seated immediately. Our server ( i forgot his name, ashamed..) was very friendly and provided great service, always came to check up on us and fill up our waters and sodas. Food: I got the lemon shrimp pasta from the skinnylicious menu. It was technically under 590 cals ( somehow it  tasted like it was more). I think thats my only problem with this place: despite having a huge menu ( where each item is over 1200 calories) and adding a ""skinny"" menu, their skinny alternaltive isnt necessarily 'healthy'. They dont have enough healthy options. Anyhow, my friend ordered their tex mex spring rolls and they were good- slightly spicy.. served with an avocado sauce and salsa. We shared the godiva chocolate cheesecake- obviously heaven. I think the cheesecake was served a bit too cold, should have let it sit out a few min longer so that the cheesecake was smoother. Anyhow, its clean, attached to the mall for further entertainment if necessary and has a bar. Generic cheesecake but a nice place for a date on a weekday ( packed on the weekends) Parking can also suck. But def hit or miss."
Tracy U.,"Parlin, NJ",136,55,16,1.0,1/15/2016,I hate this place. It's dark and noisy. They told us it was a 45 minute wait but it was almost 2 hours and they gave us an entirely too small table. Now we just ordered and they have no turkey. What kind of sorcery is this?
Michael B.,"Staten Island, NY",1,1,1,5.0,8/26/2015,"This place is great. Prices reasonable, The service is wonderful. I had the Shepherds Pie,Wow De-Lish! The Cheesecake was off the charts. Clean Friendly Restaurant, great Atmosphere, fun was had by all. I can't wait to go back. I think I'll go next weekend, save room at the end for the creamy decadent Cheesecake."
Lee G.,"Union, NJ",8,68,100,3.0,4/15/2015,"I normally stick to what I know in this place. The small plates for pretty good, my faves are the fried mac & cheese balls, avocado egg rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps. As far as a bigger fish their bbq ranch salad is good also. It's packed 90% of the time, service is usually fast & friendly. Decent place as far as fast food chain restaurants go"
Sagar S.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",150,63,113,4.0,3/1/2014,"Great atmosphere and a very lively place. Always filled with people the Cheesecake Factory is a great location for any sized group. The food is decent for the prize, taste is pretty good and portions are filling. Its all about the dessert though and it is delicious! Waiter was alright but could have been a little more attentive but due to the sheer size of the place its forgivable.  As a vegetarian there are many options, I had the eggplant sandwich and it was pretty good. The chipotle pasta can be made without meat and also tastes excellent!"
Shirley C.,"Bound Brook, NJ",2,2,,2.0,11/11/2015,"I always came here for their Thai lettuce wrap it's was filling. Now after years of going here, their chicken are six miniature chicken piece and a whole bunch lettuce for the lettuce wrap. Which is a waste of 13 dollar."
Brian V.,"Staten Island, NY",0,124,23,4.0,2/28/2016,"One of families favorite places to go to eat. Went there for dinner at 4pm on a Saturday and still had to wait 50 minutes. The place is always mobbed and for good reason. Had the avocado egg roles as an app, it was delicious. For dinner, the chicken billagio and chicken corn tortillas. Both were very good. Topped it off with a carrot cake which was a xcellent."
Shawn J.,"Miami, FL",1,7,,3.0,1/14/2015,"Mushroom soup - salty. Ask for a lot of water to drink. Kale & Quinoa - heavy handed with dressing and grated chese Crab Cakes - crispy on the outside, semi-under cooked. No flavor at all Fetuccini Alfredo w/Shrimp - pretty decent"
Natalie S.,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,12,7,4.0,3/8/2016,"Great variety of food. Great cheesecake! Great restaurant! Long wait,but it's all good!"
Marilyn W.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,15,,2.0,11/21/2015,"Stopped by Cheesecake Factory today for lunch before a movie. Apps came out quick and we waited about 40 more minutes for entree. At this point we asked for our food to go, and the waitress stated that the long wait was her fault. We got everything to go and the manager Mike comped our cheesecakes. When we went to eat it, there were multiple problems with our order. No fries with our three burgers and chicken in the salad when specifically requested no meat and repeated it twice. When we went back, we were told nothing could be done but next time we come they'll give us a salad. Not really going to go back and ask for a salad months down the road. Not really worth the $."
Will S.,"Rahway, NJ",43,31,2,3.0,6/29/2016,It's a great place to meet with friends and reunite over overpriced food. Food is good and there is a wide variety of cheesecake options. The service was average.
Alice S.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",2,42,9,1.0,10/2/2015,We have eaten here many times since opening many years ago. Until now we have been happy and satisfied. Today tho they were not busy we found the service to be very poor. No bread after asking. Waited a very long time for our meal and were not acknowledged in any way. This is poor customer service. We ended up leaving before our meal arrived due to ridiculous wait time and no acknowledgement/explanation/apology. Ended up at a neighborhood Pizzaria and Restaurant where we had a delicious meal and felt acknowledged NOT ignored. Waaay too many options in this area to receive this type of service. Not certain if/when we will return to this location.
Lauren P.,"Staten Island, NY",54,3,1,1.0,10/3/2016,"@Cheesecake I have visited the Cheesecake Factory since it had opened many years ago and had one of the worst experiences there last night. First of all my fiancé and I ordered a kale salad as an appetizer to share.  It was served to us with zero dressing which caused us to basically choke on the dry kale leaves. But we were hungry from being outdoors apple and pumpkin picking all day so we just attempted to eat it. My fiancé ordered Everlyns favorite pasta without mushrooms, as he despises them as his entree and I ordered the Factory Burger on wheat loaf cooked medium rare. First of all his pasta did indeed have mushrooms in it. But because we have both worked in the food service industry and did not want to make a big deal out of mushrooms we figured we could just pick them out. We are both very compassionate nice people. When my burger arrived , before it even hit the table, I could tell it was severely undercooked. But with further inspection my burger was RAW. I even put my finger into the meat and it was cold and bloody, basically still mooing. I immediately called our lovely waitress over and she took it away and apologized profusely. I told her it isn't her fault but can she please have them remake this because I was completely turned off. She came back several times still apologizing and even said that her kitchen manager exclaimed ""omg no that's not right"" when he saw the severity of how my burger was undercooked. To make matters even worse my side salad that came with my burger was rotten and slimy and contained what looks like a worm or some sort of creature with further inspection of the photo I took of it. We did receive 2 slices of cheesecake on the house but I feel like the Cheesecake Factory company needs to know that something is a wry at this Menlo Park location. A few years back there was a cockroach in my food at this same location. But I believe in second chances ..and I think this past experience was my last visit to Cheesecake Factory. I am disgusted and turned off. Shame on the cooks and kitchen staff at Cheesecake Factory. I fear that in the near future customers could contract food poisoning and/ or Ecoli due to the nature of the ingredients and the rotten not fresh food. I will not be returning."
Rob B.,"Staten Island, NY",0,76,1,5.0,8/22/2016,"This place is heaven, I've always enjoy the food and the service. I like to take my dates here because they appreciate the quality of the service and the food. My favorite is the chicken madiera with mash potato, but everything in this place taste great. I never like calamari,but one day I was hungry so I tried it and now i'm hooked, this is the only place where I will eat calamari. The portions are ridiculous, it takes you two sittings to finish the main course. When I want to be treated like a king, I go to the Cheesecake Factory."
Ryan J.,"Elizabeth, NJ",1,5,3,4.0,10/23/2014,You can't go wrong with the cheese cake factory the menu is filled with a variety of different items and something is bound to catch your eye staff is always very attentive and very courteous I've tried a few different things from the menu all of which were good oh and the bread they give you before your meal is always hot and fresh !
