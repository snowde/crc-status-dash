Sandy S.,"Springfield Township, NJ",0,10,,2.0,8/3/2017,The food was good that was the reason for any stars. My husband and I went for lunch yesterday afternoon. There were open tables but we still had to wait a fair amount of time for a table. When being  seated we asked the hostess if we could have one of the open booths instead of being squished against the wall in a small 2 seat table and was told no that those seats were for 3 or more. We than proceeded to watch 2 women be seated next to us in a 4seat table and 2 people being seated at all the booths that were open. Hopefully management will review with the hostess since customer service is a large part of the dining experience.  This experience is probably why we will not return to this location.
Ann I.,"Edison, NJ",3,12,4,4.0,7/30/2017,"Pricy but tasty options available. My go-to orders are pasta da Vinci and the tuxedo cream cheesecake. Delicious!! Usually this location has wait times, it's very popular and you see people of all ages and occasions here. Parking can be hard to get close to the entrance but since it's located within a mall, you can just park at any mall parking lot and walk over."
Zee S.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,1,,5.0,6/3/2017,"A great place to hang out with friends and family, The food is great and you will love the cheesecake."
Chet B.,"Edison, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/21/2017,Went there today (Thursday) for lunch with my elderly Father.  We were seated quickly but the wait service was terrible.  I had to go find our waitress and had to wait for 25 minutes for food and when it arrived the plates were hot and the food was cold.  Doing the food court from now on.
Victoria B.,"Metuchen, NJ",209,12,2,4.0,10/19/2016,"Great food overall, huge menu. I did have to send back a veggie melt I originally ordered because it had goat cheese on it which tasted like a zoo animal's gooch. I'm still having ptsd when I think about the taste of it. I replaced it with a Philly cheesesteak and it was good. Honestly cannot understand why people would create goat cheese if that's actually the way it's supposed taste. Anyway, all the other food was top notch."
Bonnie P.,"NJ, NJ",163,25,27,5.0,5/27/2017,"Went with my sister, mom and 3year old niece on a Friday evening. Place was busy (which is the norm) but they staff still provided awesome service. Food was great, you can tell it came just as it was ready in the kitchen. Our server Iryna was very efficient and super nice. She was very attentive and friendly, esp to my niece who is Afraid of people she doesn't know. We all took our cheese cake to go, which was a great delicious treat once we were home. I will definitely be dining here again."
Ela D.,"Parsippany, NJ",0,1,,2.0,2/4/2017,Sooo disappointed...we waited 30min for a manager to come out and tell us that they ran out of the soup for the evening. We ordered a steak Diane which was cooked too much and they had another manager  (Brian) come out and tell us that what looked like and tasted like a well done steak was a medium temperature.  Needless to say that I don't think I'll be  going back  Thanks Brian!
Karen K.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",52,140,320,5.0,12/5/2015,"You can never go wrong eating here. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta which is always amazing! Creamy sauce full of flavor and not spicy at all, which is great. My husband ordered the Pasta Carbonara. His pasta had a strong garlic flavor so if you love garlic,  this is the dish for you. Afterwards, we were too full to fit cheesecake so we just ordered 2 slices to go. The Tuxedo chocolate cheesecake is one of my favorites. It was our first time ordering the smores cheesecake but it did not disappoint."
Alexander H.,"Scranton, PA",1075,586,6680,4.0,11/4/2015,"It's time for a revamp, and my rating will stay the same.  We came on a Saturday night, which was Halloween. Initially, we had plans for dinner somewhere else with a reservation. However, after hearing that there was a 10-15 minute for tables that night only, we decided to cancel our reservation somewhere else and dine here instead. We did that because this place never takes reservations, and waiting times can reach 60 minutes or more on a Saturday night, just like my previous experience back in 2013. After a 13 minute wait, we were seated at a booth. 5 minutes later, our friendly server approached us to take our drink orders. We all ordered water, but I also ordered a ""Flying Gorilla"" (go ahead - laugh) for my specialty drink craving. After a 10 minute wait, our drinks came, along with a bread basket filled with miniature loaves of Honey Wheat Bread and one mini baguette loaf. The ""Flying Gorilla"" was a chocolate-banana milkshake SPIKED with a REASONABLE AMOUNT of Dark Chocolate and Banana Liqueur. I was much more impressed with this shake than the one at Bill's Bar and Burger of Harrah's AC. The shake wasn't too thick, the sweet flavor was great, and the liquor sensation was STRONG. But if that wasn't enough, a mound of whipped cream was placed on top along with some chocolate chips. Be sure to scoop out and eat the chocolate chips when you're finished with this tasty treat. Hey Bill, THIS is a PROPERLY SPIKED milkshake, unlike yours. Highly recommended. The Honey Wheat Bread was topped off with oat pieces. The honey flavor was sweet, and it tasted hot and fresh. The baguette also tasted hot and fresh too. Butter was included with the basket, which enhanced the taste of the breads. Five minutes after we finished our bread, our entrees came out. I had the Chicken Madeira. This was a sauteed chicken breast that was topped with melted Mozzarella cheese and covered with a mushroom Madeira sauce. Also placed on top was asparagus. Mashed Potatoes was served on the side. I could see and taste why this was one of their popular entrees. The sauteed chicken itself tasted great with the seasoning, and the melted cheese and mushroom Madeira sauce only enhanced the flavor. The mashed potatoes had a unique flavor, and it was good. The asparagus tasted fresh. An older woman approached our table and asked me what I ordered. After I told her what it was, she thanked me and said that looks good. I said that it was worth trying.  My dad ordered the Spicy Orange Chicken entree. This consisted of fried pieces of chicken breasts smothered in a sweet and spicy orange sauce. This was served with a side mound of white rice with seasoning on top, and vegetables (snow peas, carrots, etc.) mixed with the sauce. He liked his entree. I tasted the chicken, and it was quite good! My mom had the Hibachi Steak entree. This steak came with Shiitake Mushrooms, onions,  Wasabi flavored mashed Potatoes, and fried asparagus. She ordered her steak cooked medium. She enjoyed her entree. I had a taste too, and the sauce that was utilized for the steak was tasty.  Of course, this outing wouldn't be complete without, well, cheesecake! We ordered two slices to share. The first one was the seasonal Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore. This consisted of Hershey's Creamy CHOCOLATE Cheesecake (without the chocolate cake layers) topped off with a chocolate GANACHE.  On top of that slice was a melted toasted marshmallow, a graham cracker, and whipped cream. An additional mound of whipped cream was added on the side. The flavor was really rich! I recommend this flavor to chocolate lovers.    The other slice was the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. This cheesecake contained white chocolate and macadamia nut chunks, and on top of that was a swirl of caramel syrup and more macadamia nuts. Whipped cream was also placed on top of the slice and on the side. This was good, but a little too sweet.  As what another C.J. Yelper posted in her classic review, eating this by yourself in one sitting can be overwhelming, since the slices are quite big. It's best to share the slices with your friends or family members. If you're alone, just take the unfinished portion home for early future consumption. I keep the rating the same due to the service being on the sluggish side. Maybe you can't rush perfection on spiked milkshakes and entrees, but a 12 minute wait on the cheesecake slices was puzzling.  Overall, this was a very good dining experience. Our server was pleasantly kind throughout the evening. We may consider eating here sometime later on in the future. Even if we don't come back to eat, we'll still grab some slices to go later on."
Atiya T.,"Far Rockaway, Queens, NY",20,14,4,1.0,1/16/2017,My First time ever in a Cheesecake Factory and I get stuck with the waitress from hell... she ignored us after she placed our drink order and we had to flag her down for service .... once my order was given she proceeded to tell me they were sold out and walked away as if I didn't want to order anything else. She then dropped us off bread and disappeared yet again. When I tell you I watched her go to every other table as well as sing happy birthday to a table right next to us! This place sucks if I could give them a zero I definitely would. Because of the service here I will never go to another Cheesecake Factory! There's no way a company can employ someone like our waitress!
Jeff Y.,"East Brunswick, NJ",80,49,19,4.0,9/16/2016,"This one off my regular places to go in town and I love it huge menu, nice service and good food.    Make sure if you going out to eat on the weekend to make reservations unless you don't care to wait for an hour or so."
Virginia Y.,"San Francisco, CA",1562,1444,4563,2.0,12/14/2014,"If it wasn't for the gift card I wouldn't eat here. I've had their cheese cakes before, they're usually really sweet and too filling.  Since I haven't had their foods I decided to give this place a try. I had the Ahi carpaccio, salmon rolls, Portabella mushroom, avocado & zucchini fries and Godiva chocolate cheese cake. Service was kind of slow, their bread was good compared to other restaurants where we had eaten before. The food was okay, nothing spectacular. Portions are pretty big. I liked the ahi, but their sauces were too salty..  The salmon roll was meh, I didn't really taste much salmon. The cake was way way way too sweet. I had 2 bites and couldn't eat anymore.  Overall it's just another chain restaurant. It's almost like TGIF or Olive Garden but a little bit better.."
Stephanie R.,"Sewaren, Woodbridge Township, NJ",77,1,,1.0,7/14/2017,"This used to be my favorite place to go out to dinner until today. My family and I arrived there at 7 pm and was told it would be about an hour to an hour and fifteen minute wait. We waited TWO hours to be seated after asking multiple times when our table might be ready and we were given the run around. After being seated we waited over an hour for our food to come and my husband received cold, hard pasta. Our server had an attitude and the manager seemed uninterested. You would think that after such a lengthy stay (with 5 kids) the staff would be empathetic and want to provide excellent customer service but nope, nothing. Not even a dollar off of our bill, not an apology, NOTHING. Needless to say we will never go back to this restaurant."
Riyanka P.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",253,130,956,2.0,5/25/2016,"This place gets 2 stars for quality of food on my latest visit. I got the kale and quinoa salad and it didn't have any quinoa in it at all. I had to ask for quinoa. It was also underdressed so I asked for more dressing. Luckily I was there for awhile meeting with a friend, but if I was in a rush I wouldn't have been happy with the service at all. Also for almost $11 the salad wasn't worth it. It didn't have a whole lot going on in terms of ingredients, and it wasn't too filling. Imagine if I didn't ask for the quinoa! Honestly I would've been better off going to Saladworks for a better and bigger salad."
Damian U.,"Watchung, NJ",0,3,,3.0,8/23/2017,Nothing special. The food quality is the same or similar to Friday's - not worth paying extra money
Paul V.,"Metuchen, NJ",0,11,1,1.0,7/9/2017,Overpriced do not go here. Waited at bar for five minutes bartender did not even look in our direction. We were the only ones there. Never again Cheesecake Factory
Orlando D.,"Newark, NJ",0,2,,1.0,7/8/2017,"We came in to eat, our device rang and we watched as other people were seated before us. After about 3 minutes we decided to speak up and we got seated at 8:23pm and it was 8:31pm when we walked out and no one came to our table. Manager saw us walk out didn't even bother apologizing or acknowledging that we were walking out. First and last time ever coming here to eat."
Anita B.,"Staten Island, NY",0,8,3,1.0,11/11/2017,"Had a scary experience here today. My boyfriend and I went for lunch and he almost choked on a large piece of plastic that somehow got into the bacon and cheese balls we were eating.  The manager did take the food that almost choked him off the bill (wow thanks, for taking plastic contaminated food off the bill)  plastic inside food should never happen.  I feel they definitely could have been more concerned and apologetic. We stayed because we were initially in shock to be honest, he was very  shaken up  (it was huge mistake...... to stay after that.....) the service went down hill from there. If you can believe anything more below almost choking on a piece of plastic. We then waited 30 minutes or more..... for the waiter to pick up the money for our bill and a piece of cake. Worst experience of my life, felt totally disrespected and mistreated as a customer. I will never go back into that place again and will be calling the corporate office and the NJ board of health  first thing in the morning. Plastic in food could kill someone. Imagine if it was a child who ate that? who wouldn't have the sense to know it didn't feel right and swallowed it? My boyfriend almost  swallowed it, let alone a child..... and I saw plenty of children  in there.  Thankfully my boyfriend  started coughing so it delayed him swallowing it  and he realized there was something that didn't feel right before he swallowed it and choked. This wasn't just a simple  mistake, it could choke someone. Extremely dangerous situation. Be careful in this place!!! I worked in restaurants many of them and I'm 32 not a kid, been to tons and tons of restaurants and have never in my life seen plastic cooked into food, with a completely noninterested or concerned reaction from the staff and manager."
Alekcia C.,"Union, NJ",0,13,10,5.0,8/12/2017,"This place is so delicious!! You can be sure you will always have a great experience. Nice staff, variety of food, and awesome cheesecake."
Sam S.,"Clark, NJ",0,10,,5.0,8/30/2017,"Thai glazed salmon is amazing...so clean tasting. They have brown rice if you prefer (i do)....love this place, and the multi-grain bread!!! Heaven."
