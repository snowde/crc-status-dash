Eliza P.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",42,28,1,4.0,8/9/2017,I like them. Food is good enough. Cheesecake is amazing. Staff is friendly. Go early to avoid wait.
Heather F.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,1.0,6/10/2017,We were basically invisible the entire experience we had here... they told my party of 3 it would be a 20 minute wait that turned into 40 minutes. Once our useless toy they gave us down went off vibrating we were still waiting. Another hostess even asked a couple that got here way after us to be seated before us while we were standing right there. Oh and there were 5 tables open when we finally got walked by the rude hostess to our seats outside so we waited for 40 min for nothing... this service is awful don't waste your time and money.
Leslie C.,"ASTORIA, NY",190,139,28,3.0,5/22/2016,"Food: 7/10 Staff: 6/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 I'm still on the fence about Cheesecake factory and feel like I always start the same way. If you're going to have such an extensive menu, some items are just not going to be great.  Last night, case and point, do not get the grilled fish tacos. They're simply not good, and very cheap with the amount of fish.  The side of broccoli was plain, steam broccoli, also not very good.  I got the BBQ cheeseburger - delicious if you're a burger fan.  We also got a kids pizza, not bad, but not great. My biggest complaint: We ordered an appetizer that the waitress completely forgot.  She was very nice about it, but still..... Atmosphere is like every other cheesecake factory, not a complaint at all. Overall, personally I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake factory, but if you stick to their better dishes (for me, it's burgers) then it can be a good night out."
Jade S.,"Rahway, NJ",0,19,13,4.0,1/20/2016,"So I went to the Cheesecake Factory for drinks the other day and I have to admit my experience was good! Our drinks were excellent, made by Jeff the bartender. The only issue was that they forgot about my quesadilla which I wasn't angry about however when they finally brought it out the manager (Ralph I think, I had a lot of tequila so I'm not sure) came over and apologized and he also comped my food. Thanks Ralph, and if that's not your  name I'm sorry"
Christina L.,"Manhattan, NY",240,147,112,4.0,8/19/2015,"I have come here several times because the food is phenomenal. It gets busy and they don't take reservations, so the wait can get long.  I had one incident with the service, but I'm trying very hard to not hold grudges.. at least for the CAJUN JAMBALAYA #drool"
Adriana F.,"Staten Island, NY",251,30,2,5.0,10/1/2016,Went for my my dads birthday dinner and the food was really good.We had the avocado egg rolls and the fried mac and cheese balls for an appetizer.I love the egg rolls and I always get them.For my entree I got the veggie burger and a side if potatoes.The burger had great flavor and well seasoned.The service was fast and great and our waiter was wonderful.She gave my dad a complementary ice cream and they sang happy birthday.Very kind and sweet.I definitely reckoned the chocolate hazelnut cake.It has Nutella at the top and I love anything Nutella.We had a great dinner and really enjoyed it.
Kimmy N.,"Bulls Head, NY",6,16,3,5.0,8/13/2015,"I love this place! I came here on a Wednesday and my group of friends and I, were seated right away. Our waitress was amazing, she was so nice and attentive. She kept asking if we needed help with anything. She was a doll. Which is mostly why I am giving this place 5 stars.  The food is always the same here. Their quality is constant and they have such a large menu, so there is a lot to choose from, and there is something for everyone. We had the nachos as an appetizer which was delicious, and I other the smokehouse burger which was also good. The cheesecake here is pretty classic. There is possibly any cheesecake you can think of having. Now its not the first time I've been here and I know on the weekends its very very chaotic, so come at a time when you are borderline hungry, because the wait is almost about an hour long. This place is great for families and children, especially if its for their birthday, they will treat you amazingly."
John F.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",0,6,,3.0,8/31/2016,"I have found the food and service at this location to be very good. It is a chain, so of course I don't need to go into details about specific dishes. They are great with substitutions, which is important for me as I'm on a low carb diet, so it's always nice to be able to swap pasta or potatoes for veggies. My only issue with this location is the front desk when there is a wait, which is usually the case on weekends. On my last visit, after asking for a booth for two, we waited and were eventually shown to a table. I said I would be willing to wait for the booth I requested, as we don't like having people taking flash pictures or have screaming babies right on top of us, and asked to be put back on the list and get another ""beeper"", but I was told that wasn't necessary. Then we waited a half hour, and apparently they had completely forgotten about us. My diabetic friend was starting to have a low blood sugar episode, and they forgot about us again. What was supposed to be a pleasant last-minute dinner out turned into an ordeal with a friend feeling ill and in tears. The visit before that had a long wait, and an apparently malfunctioning beeper, so we were never aware that our table was ready. There is a person calling names that are ready to be seated, but at such a soft volume, you can barely hear him even if he's right next to you, let alone among the crowd. Again, I was told I didn't need another beeper, that it would just be a few minutes, and they forgot about us. I don't usually go to chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is quite good and has a lot of dishes that I like. At a quiet booth, the atmosphere is festive and pleasant. But I will probably not return to this location on weekends, or when there is a wait, until the chain finally begins to accept reservations for dinner."
Sara M.,"Edison, NJ",0,6,,3.0,5/13/2017,"So I used to love this location because the food and service were more or less consistent. Lately, this place has been letting me down. The staff change shift mid service without even letting the clients know. Last time we didn't see our server for 30 minutes only to find out that she left for the night. On the plus side, food is good and lots to choose from. It would be nice if they updated the menu more often."
Melissa D.,"West Orange, NJ",1,10,,2.0,3/27/2016,"My wife and I were very excited to discover that Cheesecake Factory had a wide array of Gluten Free options since she has Celiacs. However, this location in Edison has clearly not educated their staff on the allergy or maybe the seriousness behind it. My wife is not gluten sensitive- it is not a choice- she has celiacs which means she can not have it.  On three separate occasions she has gotten sick. The first time she ordered the gluten free Ceasar salad, we found out later the Ceasar dressing was NOT gluten free. The second time they brought her salad out with croutons, when we pointed this out they removed the croutons but clearly did not redo the salad. Tonight she ordered a salad again, with a different dressing that was supposed to be gluten free. After dinner we had purchased tickets to a movie where she begin to have an allergic reaction which left her in the movie theatre bathroom throwing up the majority of the movie. It is now 6 hours later and she is still throwing up and breaking out into hives.  So we wasted money on dinner and a movie and now have to monitor her in case she needs to go to the emergency room. When will this be addressed to the staff? Most restaurants who offer gluten free dining do not even allow a waiter or waitress to touch the dish, a chef hand delivers it. This is not a diet fad, this is an allergy that can cause stomach cancer. This is an allergy that can lead to reactions such as hives and difficulty breathing, which is what she is experiencing right now. People with this illness should not have to worry about this every time they try to have a nice night out at a restaurant that claims to understand and offer Gluten Free dining."
TaketotheRiv R.,"Paramus, NJ",9,20,,5.0,5/24/2017,"Theres usually a wait, and theres a reason for that. Sometimes I go here twice a week. Been going for months. Have yet to have one single bad experience. Every freaking thing on the menu is great. I commend the management at this place. Simply the best."
Shirley S.,"Kendall Park, NJ",0,4,,1.0,5/10/2016,"Never had such poor services, ice cold food served one dish out a time for a party of 7 20 minutes from first plate hitting the table to the last one, oh and by the way all served cold and missing items. Management was worthless and said the discussion was over. I would never step foot into that location again."
Aj P.,"Edison, NJ",4,30,4,2.0,12/14/2016,Had Spicy cashew chickens was tasting sweet  My wife enjoyed her Guacamela  Salad.  I didn't like the place we were made to sit.. You want to sit peaceful and quite place when you go with your family..Not  next to the bar ..  there was sufficient vacant places in the whole floor.. Cmon guys .. I really didn't like it..Please do better work next time Anyway will expect Cheesecake Factory admin to see the seat preferences arrangement Thanks
Lisvette V.,"Jersey City, NJ",184,24,14,4.0,11/29/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I'm sadly here at least once a week because it's one of the best spots (in my opinion) to get a quick meal & dessert in the area. Fairly new to middlesex county-I'm still looking for some good spots to grab a yummy treat and I find Cheesecake Factory to never disappoint me. The menu is fairly extensive although I stick to my favs (arugula and beets salad, four cheese pasta) .. guests that I have been with have ordered other dishes and haven't been disappointed. It's not a fancy schmancy restaurant but it's definitely good for gettin something in your belly with a nice ambiance .. and not to mention their cheesecakkkkeees!!! Mmm. *drool*"
Nat M.,"Fords, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,72,,4.0,6/10/2017,"Nice ambiance, great service, delicious food ( the Baja tacos were wonderful ), and fantastic drinks. The only reason I docked a star on the rating is because there was visible oil, butter, and water covering the entire floor. It wasn't just in one spot. My party and I were slipping and sliding, all the way, to and from the table. The hour that we were there, no one cleaned it up. Dangerous for customers and the wait staff ( serious liability issue ), and frankly, kind of gross. Since everything else was terrific, I would go back, and hopefully, the floors will be clean and safer to walk on next time."
Randall O.,"North Miami Beach, FL",93,10,6,2.0,11/9/2016,"Problaby the worst experience on a Cheesecake Factory. We order Nachos and they came out with the chicken cold on top, then after we send then back, they brought them just warmed out the plate. The rice was horrible and no fresh. The pasta was really good, and the server was ok."
Alexis W.,"Sayreville, NJ",72,133,640,2.0,11/2/2016,the cheese cake was ok.  the wait wasn't bad and i went at 2pm on a sunday.  the service is always slow but the food was good. they are in a prime location because of the mall i would totally go back again.  service does need to improve significantly/
Christine N.,"Iselin, NJ",69,27,64,4.0,4/17/2016,"I stay away from this place during those expected crowded time slots and aim for early lunch or early dinner. This is a place where I can bring my 5 kids and my parents and everyone can easily find something they want to eat. Even my most selective eater (13yo) enjoys it here. I'm not too thrilled about the low lighting. We prefer the booths over the seats that are in the aisles. Some of our favorite dishes include: Chicken Madeira, Bacon Blue Cheese Sweet Dates Pizza, Shepard's Pie, and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake is SICK! Their cocktails are nice too. The bar doesn't make any drinks with ginger ale. Jameson and Ginger for example, you would get two glasses. Jameson from the bar and Ginger Ale from the kitchen and together it would be around $13. And you'd need an empty glass to essentially make your own drink. Not worth it."
Syra E.,"Parlin, Parlin, NJ",0,7,2,3.0,3/5/2017,"Came for my friends birthday just two of us on Sunday night. It was packed but we knew that coming in. Once we were seated the waiter took 15 minutes to our table. We were seated in a cute area, he was able to wait on 3 tables before getting to us, he saw us and never once said I'll be with you shortly or anything. We were able to order drinks apps and entree since he took a while.  He hardly checked on us which wasn't that bad. What peeved me off was he got my cheesecake wrong! He put them in the containers and put on the table then quickly put it in the bag. I asked for the chocolate truffle cake and he gives me raspberry cheesecake. Thank god I didn't leave a huge tip. Unsatisfactory...."
Tamr A.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,71,,4.0,6/20/2017,This particular location has a great staff and the food always comes out fresh. This place can get rather busy so I usually try to go during times when it is not as busy.
