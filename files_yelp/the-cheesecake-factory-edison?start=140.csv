Rich H.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",0,1,1,4.0,12/16/2016,Went for lunch today. I ordered nachos for my lunch meal and my wife had a salad and lettuce wraps. We went at about 11:30 to avoid the probable lunch crowd. We were successful in avoiding the crowd but the food took over 20 minutes to come out.  Once it arrived the nachos were cold? How in the world does that happen.  The only other cooked component of our entire meal was a chicken breast. Obviously an issue on the line.  Our waitress took them back immediately and returned quickly with them piping hot.  They were delicious this time.  Except for the sour cream and guacamole that they left on when they heated them.  My wife had the beet and goat cheese salad and like I said the lettuce wraps.  Loved them both.  Will definitely give them another shot.  For dessert this time.
Robert A.,"Rocky Hill, NJ",5,42,14,2.0,1/19/2016,"I want to thank the staff for the memorable experience this past weekend.    The 40 minute quoted time for a table allowed me to spend 85 minutes with friends standing and having to learn to dance around the folks moving from the bar or those coming in for to-go service.    Thank you to the server who allowed 30 minutes from the time we were seated to the time we had our drinks.   If it wasn't for the long wait for the sub-par unsweetened ice tea I would actually think about how bad it was. I've waited so long, I can't help but feel how amazing this tastes and how thankful I am to have it.  Sweet and Low please?  Thank you to our server to stop when I asked him to as he was busy running from table to table.  ""Appetizers will be out shortly"" code for - once we get them in the over / fryer that is.  Clearly 40 minutes after we place the appetizer order you would think they would be out shortly.   Thank you for the kitchen staff for promptly giving us our meals and for our server to not check on us once they were brought out.      Not wanting to choke on my dried rice, I am still holding tight to my ice tea, as I know it would not be refilled any time soon.  I could have died and the server would not have noticed. Asking for to go containers required a 20 minute wait. Are they so eco-friendly that they physically make them as needed in a separate rood in the back? Containers are they as sacred as the eternal spirit of a enlighten cow in a foreign eastern country.   Let us pray they come out quickly.  Planned Cheesecake.... in which you eat 1/2 in the restaurant and 1/2 a later time requires a sacred to-go container.  In which we were told no we can serve the cheese cake you plan to eat only half here in to go containers.  Okay make them to go and we will just eat them here anyways and save the 20 minute wait for the containers.   The Land Before Time - in which would-be orphaned dinosaurs seek food and nutriment so they can reunite with their families, only to be told by the guardians ""I'll be right back"". No Cheesecake Factory I don't think I will be right back.  Your mediocre food presented in a dimly lit room of dust covered dated opulence doesn't mask the greed of corporate. Servers costs a restaurant $5 per hour, bus boys cost $8.  They were quick to clean our table to get the next group seated once we left.  I'm confused by this logic.   More servers orders go in quickly and delivered and we spend less time at the table."
Becky F.,"Manhattan, NY",96,141,69,3.0,5/24/2015,"There is nothing great or awful about this Cheesecake Factory. They have a wide selection of cheesecakes and the food is ok, not too pricey. The only MAJOR downfall for me is the wait. I have always had to wait over 30 minutes (usually 1 hour or more on Thursday-Saturday nights) for dinner on any night of the week. You also have to waste 15 or more minutes just looking for a parking spot. Otherwise, the service is ok and it's not too loud so long as you're seated away from the entryway. The food comes out at a reasonable rate depending on how busy it is. In general for CF, I recommend the Kahlua Cocoa chocolate cheesecake!! So good!!"
Loretta K.,"Staten Island, NY",0,5,,2.0,2/24/2017,"This place used to be good, but it isn't anymore. I had a Super Antioxidant Salad. It's supposed to have lots of healthy ingredients. They skimp on ingredients like blueberries, grapes and avocado, and give you lots of kale. It made me physically ill, and I was sick for the rest of the day. Their service has also declined. The waitress disappeared for a long time. It's overpriced, with poor service and subpar food. Avoid it."
L.S M.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2/23/2017,"Very bad experience.. Dirty place, bad service and not worth the price. Too many people serving you with a very impersonal experinece. Bathrooms are dirty, the floor has food and the menus are sticky.  Paid 15 for fish tacos that didnt have more than 2oz of fish."
Inez H.,"New York, NY",0,11,,4.0,11/30/2016,"Came here after a long day of shopping and even though it was busy, we were immediately seated and didn't have to wait long for our food. I got the Vegan Cobb Salad - ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND! Even to the carnivores among you. It was listed in the ""Superfoods"" section of the menu and really had lots of different ingredients. Super tasty and the portion, as always, huge. 5 stars for the Vegan Cobb Salad minus 1 star because there's no vegan cheesecake ;-)"
Richard C.,"Groton, MA",84,135,42,1.0,12/26/2015,"Worst restaurant management ever!  We waited over 40 minutes for a table only to have them attempt to seat us at a table with no chairs.  They then spent 10 minutes running around the restaurant trying to find chairs and did not return.  During that time we asked the staff if we could sit at the just cleared booth across from where we were standing.  The staff we spoke to said is was okay for us to sit there.  So we moved to the booth. Then the manager, Andrea, came over and said that we were not allowed to sit at the booth.  She said that we needed to go back to the table that they attempted to sit us at originally.  She then accused us of just seating ourselves and said that we were not allowed to just seat ourselves.  Keep in mind we asked her staff and they said it was okay. Having a manager come over and attempt to undo something that her staff had done to rectify a serious mistake on their part is unbelievable.   Probably the rudest thing I have ever seen.  She then acted like a dictator and said that her staff is not allowed to make these types of decisions and that we needed to come to see her.  I said that we informed her staff that we had an issue and that they said it was okay for us to sit in the booth. If their staff are unable to make those decisions they should be told that they cannot do anything like this without checking with the manager.  We would have been happy to wait for the manager to come and rectify the situation if their staff had informed us.  That is not what happened though. The problems continue when the manager returns and starts arguing with us saying that we didn't accept her previous offer to move back to the original table.  She then offers to move us to a different booth and saying that if we wanted a booth that we should have just asked and just not taken the booth.   This person obviously doesn't get it!  We didn't care about the booth.  We just wanted to be seated and not be standing at a table in the middle of the restaurant for ten minutes.  She then continues to accuse us of taking the seat and arguing with us over details rather than trying to rectify the problem. We asked for her business card and we informed her that we would be writing to the CEO.  She said fine!  Of course she does not return with her business card.  She returned with her general manager's card, Raymond Day, and then said that he stands by her and that it does not matter what I say.  Really! I hope the CEO of Cheesecake Factory sees this and reprimands their management.  If they don't, they will see the letter we will be sending them."
Tatyana R.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2/5/2017,"Food? Not bad. Service? Awful. I wasn't even sure I wanted to eat here when I walked in. I stood at the front desk where I was at first ignored, and then told to wait by a woman who didn't look at me or answer my question about wait time. I tried to ask for the wait time a second time, and she just asked for my name and said I would be sat shortly. Everything was a little pricey, but I opted for a pasta lunch special that was 13.95 and my server asked if I wanted shrimp or chicken, so I said chicken and my food was out shortly. Basic alfredo, nothing special. However, when I got the bill my food was 16.50. I asked to see a menu and my server immediately knew why I was asking, and said it was odd it had come to be so much (it was also a very small portion). Nothing on the menu said there would be an upcharge for chicken. My server had not told me beforehand. And when he went to go speak to the manager, he just came back saying the manager said there had to be an upcharge for chicken even if it wasn't listed. I was mad at the woman at the front for not wanting to speak to me like a normal person. I was mad at my server for not knowing and letting me know when I would have an additional charge. And I was mad at the manager for not coming out to explain and at least apologizing for the inconvenience. I paid, I tipped, and I left, but I won't be coming back."
Sherra L.,"Brooklyn, NY",327,188,557,5.0,1/8/2015,"When I'm craving for a cheesecake, I always come here to order it! I love how the cheesecakes tastes and made here! Big slice, great smooth texture! I never get enough of cheesecakes! Next step is trying their other flavors of cheesecake and desserts!"
Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",820,1466,1100,4.0,1/20/2015,"Yes this is a chain restaurant so you already know what to expect. The menu here is pretty much a college textbook with so many choices but whatever you go with you wont be disappointed. I have had many dishes here from pasta, salads, chicken and steak.  Everything here its really good and the portions are huge.  This is not the place to get an appetizer and an entrée unless you have a very healthy appetite.  They also give you delicious warm bread to start.  If you are coming here come with plenty of time since they do not do reservations and there is always a long wait."
K P.,"Edison, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2/1/2017,My mom got food poisoning from the bang bang chicken and shrimp after we ate here last week.
Dottie L.,"Manville, NJ",0,10,1,1.0,10/22/2016,"Seating took forever, food took forever, got my order wrong and insisted it's what I ordered. Hated every part of the experience and will not be coming back. Too expensive for the average food and shit service."
Enza F.,"Staten Island, NY",15,21,15,4.0,8/2/2015,"My first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I had done my homework and had a pretty good ideas what I wanted to order.  With that said, lets get down to the nitty-gritty. One less star was for the long wait between our appetizer and dinner order. In addition some missing ingredients and it was FREEZZZing where we were seating. 4stars is generous coming from me.  We ordered fried calamari and the sweet corn tamale cakes. Both dish phenomenal.  The calamari was so tender. Truly amazing! Then I ordered a Cobb salad which is supposed to have the crunch of bacon bits and hard boiled egg. Those two ingredients were surely missing. I could not see, taste or smell it! lol Other than that the salad was good but I would not call it COBB salad. The kids had burgers and they were quite happy so were we, that they were happy. Finally, the kids shared a chocolate moose slice which when I tasted it was also delicious.  What would be the point to go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting a slice of cheesecake which we took home to have it with our espresso on Sunday morning. I have to say it sure was good to have it this morning instead of last night! I enjoyed it immensely with my espresso.  I'm impressed with this high end fast food restaurant! The prices are fair for the amount of food they give you. I don't think the online menu prices are the same. They were slightly higher at the place. I will definitely be going back to try out the Thai lettuce wrap!"
Nury G.,"Washington, DC",118,131,195,4.0,4/9/2015,"I lived in Middlesex County, NJ for 10 years and this place is still a go-to when I'm craving pasta or cheesecake and I'm in the area. Not the healthiest of cravings, I know, but they have ""skinny meals"" under 500 calories for those who are not looking for a carb overload. Located in Menlo Park Mall, it can be a little difficult to find parking, specially on weekends but when you do, it's worth the time and money spent. I was visiting NJ this past weekend and came here to catch up with my best friend. The wait time was a little long but we sat by the bar and our experience was great. Our bartender was very nice and made me me a pretty tasty and strong cucumber-tini that was not in the menu, my best friend had mango-martini that was just as good.  When it comes to the menu, I think their entries are a little pricey but then again they also serve a very generous portion of food-- so generous that I am never able to eat the whole thing. Fortunately, they have a lunch menu that is served until 5-- it's much cheaper and the portions are just perfect. I had the pasta Davinci-- sauteed chicken with mushrooms and onions with Madeira wine sauce. Yumm!!"
Hulya H.,"Staten Island, NY",0,31,64,4.0,5/8/2016,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory. I get that there would be a long wait becuase it was an early Saturday evening, but it was too long of a wait. We opted to sit outside even though it was chilly so we wouldn't have to wait too long with the kids. Thankfully they had heating lamps, but it was still too chilly. I asked to sit at another table on the end since we have kids. The host said that that section was  closed, however within five minutes, both tables were filled. The clips on the high chair were broken so I couldn't strap my daughter in, but she was a good girl so I didn't need to exchange it. I ordered a blood orange mojito which tasted good, but the tips of the mint leaves were brown. So much for my first time experience."
Michael D.,"Edison, NJ",0,15,9,4.0,5/6/2017,"First time here. 25 minute wait, but it was 6:15 Friday, so we expected that. We sat close to the kitchen area therefore alittle noisy. Alot of menu choices. Had Vietnamese summer shrimp rolls as an appetizer...very good! We ordered hibachi steak and spaghetti and meatballs. Steak was delicious and meatballs were very tasty. Our server was attentive considering how busy it was.   Overall we enjoyed everything. Looking forward to going back and trying other menu items. Tiramisu cheesecake was outstanding!"
Natalie A.,"Clark, NJ",48,201,448,4.0,2/12/2015,Always have a consistently good experience here. Food is always good and portions are larger than expected. Service can be a little slow but overall it is a good spot. Dessert is a must (although it is usually to go)! The Hershey's cheesecake is beyond delicious and one of my favorites there!
Scott H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",1,15,,2.0,12/27/2016,"Cheesecake Factory included a link in their reply to contact them. I did, sent an email asking them to call me..never heard a word from them.  My wife also contacted them, they called her and left a message and she called back. Left them a message and never heard back..been almost a week and half since...Terrible Customer Service in HQ..seems to trickle down to the restaurant management."
Anthony W.,"Somerset, NJ",2,2,,1.0,10/6/2015,"The service was generally bad. All staff was rather inattentive.  My waitperson was rude and pretentious.  I would have left after the first rude comment but I was with friends.  Being rude and sharing unsolicited information made the experience almost unbearable. The large fly in my friends drink was accompanied by a patronizing comment instead of an apology. I had the avocado egg rolls shish were the highlight. They tasted good though they were over priced.  I tried the spinach dip which was terrible.  My entrée was the meatloaf which was a little disappointing, but many dishes you can get at home end up being that way.  It tasted similar to a highschool lunch.  I switched the mashed potatoes for sweet potato french fries which did not disappoint. I expect a lot more for a $60 meal.  I will most likely never return.  I wouldn't even recommend it to people I don't like."
Liz L.,"Clark, NJ",1,20,,3.0,3/17/2017,"Service was okay, food was alright, very large menu. I prefer other locations. Nothing special"
