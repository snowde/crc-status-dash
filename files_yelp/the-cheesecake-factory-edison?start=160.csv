Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",878,671,797,2.0,8/14/2015,"I cannot comprehend all the love for the Cheesecake Factory, especially this particular outpost, which fails in almost all categories relative to its peers in other cities. In general, the Cheesecake Factory is a glorified diner, only more fancy-looking and expensive. You can definitely get a decent meal here, but the food is hardly anything to jump up and down about. I generally only come here because its convenient when we get the kids together with their grandparents. I can't think of any diners that can fit 8-10 people in a single booth. Maybe it's because I don't like cheesecake. Maybe it's because I don't care for the decor. Maybe's it's because, despite having a 20-page menu, I can never find anything to order that sounds appealing. I can tell you what it was on my trip here the other day: this location's complete inability to deliver on what I would normally say would be a 3-star experience at best. First off, the place feels worn down relative to other locations. Secondly, all of the food we ordered was served cold. Thirdly, the food we ordered was just not good. This was probably the first time anyone in our party ever ordered a flatbread pizza here, but the margarita version was terrible. Served cold and on a cracker-like bread, the fontina cheese blend was broiled until it was crunchy, and the fresh mozzarella was sprinkled on cold. And ironically we were told that's how the recipe calls for it. Awful. Skip it. I had the spicy chicken soft tacos, which were neither spicy nor were they served even close to warm. And even the sauces and accouterments couldn't save this dreadfully dry and bland dish. The pickled vegetable salad on the side was so bad it was offensive. I could go on, but I will spare you the grief. I try to avoid one and two star reviews as much as possible, but this is just one of those restaurants I've been forced to endure for years and I still don't get why everyone loves it so much. Your best bet here is to order something really unhealthy that comes out of the fryer. In my experiences, this has always been the highlight of their incredibly mediocre offering. Or better yet, skip this chain restaurant and go eat some real food somewhere! I am soooooo done with this place!!"
Tracie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,106,115,2.0,8/1/2016,"Huge , intensive menu. Took us awhile to go through it all, and I think we still didn't see everything. We ordered the portobello, avocado, and zucchini fries app..and I have to say that was the best part of our meal! The salad was good too , definitely huge and filling ..tons of toppings and good amount of meat on it too. The fish and chips was sad ... 3 measly strips and totally lacking in any seasoning. Fries were gross and stale. Cheesecake is really the only reason we came here . Service was not great. Didn't have napkins even after our app was served. Took awhile to flag down our waiter.  Don't expect much if you decide to come here ."
Ashley G.,"Providence, RI",33,107,24,3.0,1/11/2016,I don't quite think The Cheesecake Factory deserves a 3 but I also don't think it deserves a 4. It is a 3.5 in my book!! I don't mind coming here when I am in town on business. The bartenders are super friendly and I'm surprised how great the cocktails are. They have a great selection of spirits and when I am staying away from alcohol I really enjoy the strawberry lemonade! YUM! For a chain restaurant they are extremely consistent. I ordered off the skinnylicious menu. I had the shrimp summer rolls along with the Asian chicken tacos. I enjoyed both! With a lot of restaurants on Route 1 this one is a go to where I can be sure to have a good meal.
AL J.,"Staten Island, NY",43,81,112,5.0,9/24/2015,"Their service is outstanding, full team effort! I only really come here for one dish, the Chicken Madeira! I effing love it, always made to perfection. .."
Joseph S.,"Edison, NJ",0,2,,4.0,9/28/2016,Must try the guacamole wok-rolls definitely an appetizer every time I go with my wife she always gets the chipotle spaghetti I'm always trying new foods at cheesecake but the fish tacos are delicious.
Mary F.,"Staten Island, NY",61,41,75,3.0,1/15/2015,"The place has a wide range of food to choose from.  There's something for everyone on the menu.  They are known for the cheesecake of course, so be sure to try it when you go! There is always a crowd and   it gets more packed later in the day.  They don't take reservations, to avoid the long lines try to get there before 7:00pm especially on Friday and the weekends.  It's good to eat here when you have plenty of time and not in a rush to go somewhere after."
Jacob P.,"Union, NJ",6,90,107,2.0,7/26/2015,"This is not my first time here and i've here so many times. This place is always busy and sometimes you have to wait for a while. The food is always good and very reasonable price. I desided to write a review today to address the management. I think its unfair for me as a guest that everytime i come to this place i never get good service. Most of the time i need the server they always not around and there was a time that i asked 3 differrent servers to get me menu back again not of them came back to bring it. What i got from them is the answer give me one second, and the reason why is beacause the table i have is not their stations thats why they don't care. After a while of waiting the waiter finally show up and guest what i couldnt event talk to him because his smell pure cigarette, we desided to get the check and leave. My 2 stars reviews is for the food and 0 stars for horrible service."
Joe C.,"Staten Island, NY",13,20,,4.0,6/11/2016,"Food is always good here. My only issue is with the bathrooms , they are always a mess. My Girlfriend always complains on the condition of the restroom every time we eat here. I don't understand how a restaurant as big and busy as this one cannot have one of its many employees  Keep on top of the restrooms. It makes you think if the restroom are not kept clean what else is not clean."
Sheem S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,4,3,3.0,3/23/2015,"I been here a couple of times. I always order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Love Love Love. Today,  I did try the crab cakes. They were ok, but not worth $13.95 Every time I come here, the floors are soo slippery. EVERY TIME. What is up with that? Very Noisy. Overall the place is fine. The food is good. I will be returning."
Jennifer S.,"Roselle, NJ",10,67,75,2.0,5/30/2016,"Beautiful decor...i have never had a meal that I like here though. I also don't like cheesecake. I keep going back because it isn't horrible, but I definitely don't love it."
A F.,"New York, NY",42,66,,3.0,4/30/2016,"Good appetizers, less-than-average entrees, expensive prices, but killer cheesecake (especially the banana cream cheesecake). What's good about this place is that it has a great vibe if you're going out with friends for dessert. This restaurant is large but, since it's sandwiched between a mall and a Barnes and Noble, it can have a long wait for lunch and dinner. Overall, I'd say have dinner elsewhere, and come here for dessert."
Tarah T.,"American Canyon, CA",169,176,140,4.0,6/3/2014,"this is my first time back after going on like a 5 year hiatus and i must say im glad that i came back.  i went on the hiatus because i just felt like the portions were ridiculously big and just over all fatty.  Well i heard that they have a new skinilicous menu, which is perfect because I am trying to lose weight right now.  i absolutely loved their new skinilicous menu! All the items are categorized and each category would state that all the items would be below 200 cal or 400 cal etc...the food was delicious! we ordered the crab balls, tomato n' basil flat bread, soft chicken tacos and chicken mexican salad.  the salad was still huge of course and the tacos were 3 in a plate and very flavorful.  Im not really sure if they meant 1 taco was 400 cal or all 3 are around 400 cal? but oh well it was so good...its alright if it was sinful.   i came out of there not feeling overly heavy and stuffed, but very satisfied.  i will definitely come again to check out the other items in their skinilicous menu. our server Nancy was a doll.  she was attentive without being annoying and we didnt have to find her when it was time to get the check."
Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,241,74,5.0,10/20/2014,"I have gone to this place many of times and I love it every time I go! I love to stick to foods I know especially when they are so good I become obsessed. But this restaurant definitely has variety, one of the largest menus I have seen. However, It is NOT overwhelming. Very well put together.  FOOD: As mentioned above, there is lots of variety. I usually stick to the Four Cheese Pasta, which for cheese lovers it is amazing and definitely accurately named! They have cajun dishes, cold appetizers, hot, almost anything you name they have it. DRINKS: Their drinks are AMAZING. They are not always strong but I definitely enjoy drinking them. My three favorites are Georgia Peach [MUST TRY], JW Lemonade, and Strawberry Banana Daiquiri.  PRICE: They are not too bad! Expect to spend about 20-40 a person with a drink, entree, dessert/appetizer. Their cheesecakes are definitely some of the best around.  OVERALL: Decently lit. Good for groups and there is definitely lots of room. Sometimes you can wait an hour to be seated but I was seated right away when I went last night. Definitely worth the wait regardless."
Queen H.,"Iselin, NJ",2,42,4,5.0,7/7/2016,"Food is great in taste & portions. I recommend the louisiana chicken pasta and chicken bellagio if you like pasta. And the lemon chicken pasta with the mashed is amazing I had an issue today with my togo ordered i encountered two managers (danny and alex who were very pleasant and quick to help me out! Which is the only reason this is 5 stars) Also ive dined in several times, never had problems but 4/4 times ive had issue with to go so dine in if you can, worth the wait!"
Alan S.,"Long Island City, NY",13,28,31,2.0,11/27/2015,Food is good.  Service eh not so much.  I mean Mindy orders a peanut sauce with her salad and they forget and then tell her there was no more peanut sauce.  Mindy says but they used it with the appetizer and the waitress says yes but that was only a little bit of sauce.  Mindy says but don't you also sell that stuff by the bottle and the waitress says but we can't use that for you.  By the time this convo is over I'm pretty much done eating and ready to leave.  I mean is it my fault?  Why should I be forced to hang out. Bottom line here is eat what they give you and don't complain because you may not have anything to eat. FYI we had lettuce wraps as an appetizers and I had taco salad.  Both were good.  But Mindy said the visit stunk so only 2 stars this time.
Derek P.,"College Park, MD",28,8,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Came in on a Monday night after shopping. Lost my wallet and I am 100% sure it was on the table and I forgot to take it. Whoever was manager that night tried to help and recover wallet. When questioning the integrity of his employees, manager got so defensive and rude. Decides to hang up on my girlfriend who called several times. I am pretty sure I left it right on the table and asked about cameras at the restaurant. Only cameras they have apparently is on the cash register. Seems like that's all they care about. I lost all my identification, tuition money in cash for my summer class, and other cards in my wallet. They act like we have to just take their words for it when I have heard rumors about their employee in general."
Diana T.,"Rahway, NJ",1,3,,5.0,7/26/2016,Favorite place for cheesecake and dinner with hubby!Bought a lemon cheesecake for my hubby  and everyone loveeee it! The ambience is romantic yet fun.

Melissa L.,"Iselin, NJ",59,10,,5.0,8/15/2016,"Favorite restaurant, good for anytime of the day after brunch, service is always fabulous"
Douglas G.,"Great Kills, NY",25,8,,1.0,5/7/2016,So this location is terrible. A wait time is fine but I put in for a table and they told me to wait for a buzzer. Meanwhile the people that came in behind me were given a buzzer immediately. So I went back up to the counter to ask for a buzzer again and they told me that I'd have to wait longer. Sooo ... Why are the people coming in after me getting a buzzer immediately? Like I don't get it. Definitely go to a different location where the servers aren't completely unhelpful.
