Kimberly J.,"Chantilly, VA",814,1667,23046,3.0,7/17/2012,"After shopping at Menlo Park Mall we decided to chow down at The Cheesecake Factory. Usually I'm a fan of this chain but the service at this location wasn't the best. We had to ask for drinks, menus, bread, etc.  The food was great. We really enjoyed the Vietnamese Tacos as a starter. At first we thought they'd come in a Taco shell but instead it was a fluffy bun. Loads of crisp veg in there. Loved it. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was my favorite Entree. Creamy sauce with a slight kick to it, crispy chicken, and mushrooms. Yum.  No matter how full you are from all the complimentary bread and your Entree. You can't leave The Cheesecake Factory without trying their awesome Cheesecakes. Gotta love all the variety. Not a fan of Cheesecake? No problem, they have a variety of other desserts too."
Camille A.,"Staten Island, NY",0,14,2,5.0,2/5/2017,With much anticipation visiting The Cheesecake Factory was a top priority on my to do list. I was not disappointed at all. The menu was vast appealing to all different tastes. I ordered several appetizers and several entrees each one totally delicious. Service was as prompt as possible given it was a weekend afternoon. Despite the chaos of the crowds the staff displayed an air of professionalism that was very refreshing. This is a casual restaurant I will definitely visit again.
H A.,"Levelland, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2016,"Where should I start? I usually don't post reviews but this was so bad I signed up JUST TO POST THIS AS A WARNING TO ALL. I was looking to host a dinner for about 35 people last week for my 2 children's birthday party, so I went through the proper channels to see if I can make a reservation. They agreed since it's such a large crowd that we can have reservations at 7pm, which worked perfectly for us. They asked us to send in our orders in advance so the kitchen doesn't get backed up the day off, which we did. We have all these communications via email.  Here is where things get messy: I get a call a day before the party and turns out someone messed something up and they couldn't host us anymore. I argued that I have already invited 30 people for a party less then 24 hours later and I can't change everything. They told me the manager would call me. You would think it wouldn't get bad but it gets worse. Joe, the manager, called me back later that day. Talk about unprofessional. He says there's nothing they can do, it wasn't ""his"" fault. I asked if there was anything, maybe even split tables to accommodate. His answer: I can give you a table at 4pm. I asked him who has dinner at 4, and he had the audacity to tell me he has ""dinner at 4pm all the time"". The whole conversation was rude and downright disrespectful.  Long story short, I had to cancel the party. I tried to find other places but with the limited time I just couldn't do it. On behalf of my 2 kids, who just turned 3, thanks for nothing. Cheesecake, if you're listening: train your management team to have some customer service. This whole situation has left a bad taste and I will encourage anyone I come across not to eat at your establishment."
Cassandra H.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,107,31,2.0,9/3/2014,"I was too excited to visit this place and it was almost a complete fail. The first mishap, there were rice noodles in my ranch dressing -____-. Imagine pouring your sauce onto a plate (I was sharing) only to see a long string of a noodle pour out. Second mishap, there was something floating in my cup =(. However the manager did fix things by offering me a piece of cake on the house. I appreciated this because it was my birthday and I probably would not have ordered any cake after the first two incidents. The cake was delicious and the high energy from the staff during my happy birthday song pushed aside my irritation from the previous incidents. I would consider buying a cake from the cheesecake factory at another location however I will no longer return to this location for any reason."
Suzanne R.,"East Brunswick, NJ",246,46,61,5.0,6/28/2015,My waiter was absolutely amazing. He was honest with me when I asked him if something was good or not and if I was torn between two he told me the better option. I had the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club and it was mouth watering. For dessert I had Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and it was so good. Tasted so much like peanut butter I loved every bite of it!
Lily L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",1,4,19,5.0,7/25/2015,"My mom and I ate here for the first time on a weekday afternoon. We had to wait maybe 20 minutes, but the time passed by quickly. We sat down comfortably and just used our phones and occasionally stared at their food slideshow on display. The food was delicious! We shared the calamari appetizer (mmm delish!), garlic noodle entrée (mmmmm!!) and we each had our own jug of coffee! We were very pleased with our meal and the nice and comfortable atmosphere. Will return again when craving a rich tasting meal with the family!"
Luis M.,"Iselin, NJ",5,28,17,4.0,8/2/2014,The food is ok at this place. Women and kids love it though. The only grudge I have is in terms of capacity. Way too many people come at the same time and the wait time is huge. I like going at off hours on off days (like Saturday at 3:30 pm) and then you don't need to wait for anything  Drinks are good. Bar looks good.
Fiona L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",426,347,1581,4.0,8/31/2014,"I've been here quite a few times already, and I enjoyed the restaurant's great variety of food, drinks, and cheesecake!  It has all sorts of cuisine such as sushi, Thai lettuce wraps, avocado tacos, Italian pasta, American burgers, and Asian sesame chicken!  It's always fun to eat here when you don't know what you're in a mood for because you'll always find something at the end!!  It can get busy at certain times of the day, but the waiters are very well trained! They're very observant. Last time, we didn't have anymore water in our glass, and he would acknowledge it and then take some customers orders. And he'll come back with water.  I've tried several cheesecake here before and I could never finish one. The best is to share one with a friend cause a slice by yourself can be pretty heavy."
Jarrett R.,"Keansburg, NJ",0,13,,4.0,6/20/2015,"Ok. So I have never been to a CF before this visit. I was so impressed with my experience that CF might be my new favorite chain eatery. The service was great, especially for this part of Jersey. The hostess was pleasant,  our waitress, Meghan was terrific, and the whole staff seemed to be really enjoying their jobs. The food was absolutely amazing.  My wife and I eat out often and rarely rave about chain food, but this meal was actually astounding. The plating was expert and the flavors were pure science. We ordered the sweet-corn tamale appetizer O...M...G. Every single flavor just melts together to create the greatest app you have ever ordered! I recommend this place to anyone who has never tried it."
David Y.,"Edison, NJ",172,5,3,4.0,7/28/2016,"The food is alright, but the service is just awesome. I went here about a handful of times but the staff was always accommodating."
Shirley C.,"East Brunswick, NJ",201,25,4,4.0,6/14/2016,"I alway have a great time at Cheesecake Factory! Although the wait time at dinner is annoying, it's worth it. The portions are huge and usually I can't finish my entree! There are options for those who are gluten free which is great! I recommend the ahi carpaccio and the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic! For cheesecake, you can never go wrong with anything chocolate! The tiramisu cheesecake is amazing too!"
Belinda L.,"Rahway, NJ",131,153,179,3.0,4/26/2015,"I had been super excited about Cheesecake Factory since my first visit at the San Fran outlet and tried their wonderful red velvet cheesecake. Since then I have also brought my parents to Cheesecake Factory. My dad really liked their pork chops, and their pasta is also great. More importantly my mum loves cheesecake so this is the place to take them.  I was in town recently and stopped by Menlo Park Mall just for some cheesecake. We had wanted dinner here too but they were always busy and on that occasion we didn't have much time to wait. After looking at the shelf I decided on the vanilla bean cheesecake. For some reason the 'wow' feeling is no longer there. The whipped cream was still good, I'd always love their whipped cream, they have a generous swirl with every order of cheesecake.  The worst part was that I got sick after that, and only got better 2 days later. That was the only food I had that my bf didn't for our trip thus far. When some time has passed I would be ready to go back again, probably to try their chocolate cheesecakes. Even though those are really rich, I think they are also better."
Lisa P.,"Kenilworth, NJ",30,120,208,5.0,4/23/2016,Great place.  Gets very crowded on a Saturday night but worth the wait.  I had the smokehouse bbq burger which was huge but delicious.  My son had the kids pizza and he loved it!  Fries are good too.  Got the toasted marshmallow smores cheesecake to go.  It was amazing!  Will be going back!
Jessie M.,"Edison, NJ",95,1,,5.0,6/23/2016,The chicken with couscous is amazing and my bartender Maggie is always my favorite!! So personable and she makes my day...
Christina L.,"State College, PA",471,33,61,3.0,8/17/2015,Lights were too dim for food pictures. Wait was too long and became full on bread. Too many birthday songs to enjoy food. Sad day.
Sefali P.,"Avenel, NJ",156,104,95,3.0,2/25/2014,Recommend: Cuban rolls (special of the night; plenty to share as an appetizer or perfect as an entree for one) Also recommend: pasta carbonara (massive serving)!
Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",259,730,78,3.0,12/3/2013,"3.5 stars. I've always been warned about the mediocre food at Cheesecake Factory and now I have experienced it firsthand. Let me preface this review by saying that this is my first time trying CF and that it was still a great dining experience - just nothing to rave about. The ambience here is really nice. My boyfriend and I were seated quickly, as were most parties of 2. The booths looked cozy but instead we ended up in a row of two-seat tables that were squished just a little too closely together. Even speaking at a low volume, there were definitely no private conversations to be had. I didn't expect for the menu to be so... long. There are a TON of choices here but I found myself still having a hard time stumbling upon something I really wanted. I was in the mood for pasta and was surprised that they only had spaghetti dishes - no lasagna, ravioli, etc. I ended up with a lemon chicken and angel hair pasta dish.  We started with a baked potato soup, which I highly recommend. Note: the portions here are fairly large and a ""cup"" of soup could actually be considered ""bowl"" sized elsewhere. My chicken and pasta dish was really tasty but not all too memorable... it was just your typical, average restaurant meal. Ended with the tiramisu cheesecake. As we all know, the dessert at CF is really the star, so no complaints here. I would come back just to eat try every cheesecake on the menu and nothing else.  Service was extremely prompt and friendly - probably the best I've had at a chain restaurant."
Paul W.,"Peru, NY",45,7,,1.0,1/17/2016,"""I'll be right back"" over three hours for dinner with 4 friends.. Quoted 30-40 minute wait which turned into over an hour- manager Jeff was full of excuses and not very sympathetic - service was slow and the waiter kept saying he'd be right back- drink refills if u could stop him. D never checked back after food came- 15 minute wait just for water and soft drinks being brought to table- love this chain but will not be back . Not the first time with this issue at this location!"
S G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,2,,2.0,12/4/2016,"It's extremely annoying to call to place an order then be ""transferred to the bakery"" & then be placed on hold for 10 minutes. I actually got to the restaurant before someone picked up the phone; so i kept the call going. When I entered the restaurant I didn't hear a phone ringing so I continued to wait to see when I would be answered. Only to then witness the host at the host stand answer my call; again after 10 minutes of me holding. If you are going to provide a take out service there needs to be a more efficient way to take orders; because this is not the first time this has happened."
Adele P.,"Bayonne, NJ",217,568,168,3.0,5/4/2014,"Decent food, large portions, good place to meet up with friends. It gets way too crowded, though. I went down to meet up with friends. For a Thursday afternoon, it was really busy, and it wasn't quite dinner time. I think the worst part of the meal was the other patrons. Yeah, maybe I'm getting crotchety in my old age, but I really didn't need to see the 20-somethings at the next table sucking face during the entire meal. It wasn't just simple kissing, it was full-on, on the table, her in his lap face-sucking. Ick.  Three tables away from them we had the woman who decided to change the diaper of one of her twins - at the table! Double ick. Management really needs to get these Walmartians under control and remind them of acceptable public behavior. I had the catfish. It came with a tartar sauce, not a remoulade, so I don't know why it said it was a remoulade. One friend had gumbo, the other had a steak and shrimp platter. Both seemed happy. Desserts are ridiculous at this place. One was shared by all three of us & there was some left over. I'm not a fan of chains but this wasn't bad. I just prefer my restaurants without wacky floor shows."
