Ben Y.,"Edison, NJ",1,81,19,4.0,3/3/2015,"Was truly surprised by the vast selection of entrees and appetizers, I'm one of those who thought of this place as primarily focused on dessert, with food available on the menu as well, but it's far from that. I enjoyed a good meal, and can recommend the lemon herb grilled chicken as quite nicely done. There are a few things I could mention that have made this review be 4 stars not 5, but it's not worth getting into. They are a big operation and that means many hands on deck, and yes things aren't going to be smooth when you're so big."
Rita T.,"Union, NJ",0,15,,2.0,9/15/2016,"Disappointed on my last few visits.  Food still good, however, portions are getting smaller.  Worst part was that the cheesecake slices are smaller by quite a bit...my favorite Linda's Fudgecake slice was also much smaller.  Not my favorite go-to place anymore.  I would be less upset if they raised the prices by a little bit rather than by reducing portions.  When you change expectations, you change the entire experience.   P.S. Restrooms were horrible.  Management and staff should be ashamed."
Tara S.,"Roselle Park, NJ",147,270,59,3.0,10/8/2013,"When you can manage to get a table (preferably a booth so you're not sitting on top of other patrons) without waiting for 45 minutes, The Cheesecake Factory is a great place. They have a dedicated menu for dieters, including drinks, and they have about 6 pages dedicated to desserts. The menu can be a little overwhelming at first, because it is so huge. I've found a regular dish there, which has become my go to. I no longer look at the menu.  I get the chicken costoletta, which comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes. This most recent time I went, the asparagus was a little undercooked and the mashed potatoes weren't mashed very much - it was more like potato salad.  The service isn't great, so when you manage to hunt your waiter down be sure to say everything you might need to tell him/her. You don't know when you'll see them next."
Andrea M.,"Keyport, NJ",42,16,4,4.0,1/14/2016,"Love their buffalo blasts!!! came here on a sunday with my nieces --- the pumpernickel bread is so yummy and we ordered buffalo blasts, lettuce tacos and mozz sticks...i tried one of my nieces buffalo blasts and must say they are delicious! I would totally recommend them as an appetizer when youre there!...the lettuce tacos were good too... :)"
Elda C.,"Edison, NJ",0,9,,2.0,9/12/2016,"Disappointing.  I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and all the lettuce was wilted!  Hubby had the Madeira Chicken, which he enjoyed. We ordered my very favorite dessert, Strawberry Shortcake. We have it almost every birthday. Big disappointment. They'd changed the shortcake, it was lardy-tasting and heavy. Additionally, the strawberries seemed to be frozen and the restaurant skimped on them. We didn't even finish it.  No desire to return although it used to be one of my favorite restaurants."
TJ D.,"Franklin Park, NJ",97,189,178,3.0,9/7/2014,All my life I had stayed away from CCF and I was proud of it. Somehow I ended up going here today for lets say lack of options. Its an OK place I don't have ANY complaints about the place neither do I have any compliments. I really fail to understand why people line up for hours to get into one. Ain't NOTHING special about CCF. Maybe I am missing something I don't know but I'll tell u this I don't even want to find out.
Niyant S.,"Collegeville, PA",29,162,96,4.0,1/23/2013,"What more can I say about The Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said?  Great place to eat, highly dependable for a good meal, whether it's brunch, lunch, dinner, or dessert. Biggest problem is the annoying amount of wait time there always is here. A place like this, with the kind of wait they get, they should do reservations, or at least call ahead..."
Deesha S.,"Edison, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Excellent food. But LAZY and INCOMPETENT people work there.  Just posting this after a bad experience a few mins ago. TO GO orders suck here! This was my 5th TO GO order and 3rd bad experience. They just dont answer their phones. They make incorrect orders. God help you if you have to call them again to change your order or to add to your order. Curbside experience is even more pathetic. I was at the curbside 20 mins. I refused to go in cause the service was offered to me!! If the manager of this place reads this review, Please throw out your TO GO team and hire a bunch of people who actually want to and can do their job. Food is great SERVICE Pathetic."
Kim G.,"New York, NY",116,298,860,1.0,12/28/2012,"We came here for my bf's little daughters birthday dinner. We were told the wait  was 30 mins. We Waited an hour.  Got a booth thank god. We looked at the dictionary i mean the menu. When they developed the menu were they so indecisive and said hey lets just put everything we can think of on the menu?   Anyway we finally figured out what we wanted to eat and drink. The drinks came and our sodas tasted like seltzer TWICE. she kept blaming the bartender.  Waitress was terrible kept forgetting sodas. Never came to ask if we needed anything. The food took forever but when it came we ordered meatloaf and 4 cheese pasta long story short, food was mediocre wasn't worth the wait.  Half hour later we were all sick. We def wont be going here again."
Nera P.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,5,,4.0,8/25/2016,I have been here few times. The food always tasted delicious. The menu is way to large in my opinion. Too many items on it. Ask for a booth if you do not like sitting practically on top of another guest. Some of the tables are wwwaayyyy to close to each other.
Krina P.,"Maywood, NJ",0,6,,3.0,8/24/2016,"Love this place. Just wish they weren't so much in a rush to get us out. My hubby and I enjoy our date nights and he loves this place. Too bad, they are always in a rush since its a very busy location. We got our entrees even before we can finish our appetizer ( and we are not slow eaters) ..hate being rushed through the dinner"
Jolene N.,"Staten Island, NY",56,49,73,5.0,11/9/2014,"Avocado eggrolls, chicken potstickers, sweet corn tamale cakes - just some of the incredible appetizers. Thai lettuce wraps! That's all that needs to be said, they're delicious! Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple and red velvet cheesecake are insane! Cheesecake Factory also makes some of the best mojitos you could ever get. Great place to go on a date or with a group. Always a wait but just walk around the mall to kill time."
Rodney W.,"Union, NJ",28,46,7,4.0,8/7/2014,"I like this place, ..real talk. Yes it's big box but they do a good job and they are pretty consistent. Im really impressed that they have such a big menu and everything I have tried taste pretty good. If you haven't check them out already given a shot"
Inês L.,"Henderson, NV",1,400,370,4.0,2/15/2013,"I think by now we know that you will have to wait. That all of the waiters look like Pillsbury Dougboys. That, sometimes, you'll have to be elbow to elbow with strangers and that there will be mediocre bread placed in front of you. SO! What I will share are some really amazing (vegetarian now vegan) meals that I've had and consistently went back to.  From the apps: Fried Mac and Cheese Balls AVOCADO FUCKING EGGROLLS!!!!!!!  Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (holy shit) Thai Lettuce Wraps  (w mushrooms) And the roasted vegetable pizza is TO DIE FOR. I try to go on off hours, though, to avoid an hour wait so it's only 10mins and the service is good, the food is great."
Ern M.,"Newark, NJ",13,189,847,3.0,10/20/2014,"I really wish we could rate for 1/2 stars because I would be at 3.5 for this place but 4 was just pushing it. I have probably been to this Menlo park location about 20 times since it's opened. It's a pretty good spot to eat even though it's a chain and I am really not a fan of them. The atmosphere is actually pretty incredible. If there weren't a sign on the wall and people weren't dressed like they just came from shopping in the mall it could probably pass for a high end restaurant. Super high 30-35ft ceilings and great lighting make it very enjoyable to dine here. Appetizers/small plate:  Soy-glazed edamame is a super light fantastic tasting dish, it's sweet and smokey with just a little spice. Fried Mac and Cheese is always consistent and one of my favorites, if they made a normal dinner portion of this I would definitely order it. Tex Mex Eggsrolls, I have had them twice and although the one time they were excellent the second time the chicken was bland and tasted like it was boiled. Pasta carbonara, a very filling and heavy dish. It tastes delicious however it sits in your stomach like you filled it with cement. Chorizo and Avocado omelette, I have had this several times and it doesn't disappoint. It's made with a chicken chorizo. Chicken and Biscuits were delicious although super filling (as expected) the buttermilk biscuit in the middle was pretty fantastic. Cheesecakes: I'll let you be the judges, some are extremely sweet to the point where it made me cringe lol but they are very good. Drinks: depending on when you go you may wait for your drink for a while, the bar gets overwhelmed."
Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1731,1526,245,4.0,8/20/2012,"Do I really need to review a cheesecake factory...well yes I do!  *3.5 Stars*  Pros: Menu is the size of a phone book (remember those?). Service was really good. She was attentive and had a great sense of humor. All of their cheesecakes are ridiculous. You cannot go wrong with any. Burgers are good. They have so much to choose from that whatever you are feeling like, you can order it. Meal prices are moderate. Wish they had a tasting menu...mmmm Cons: Prices on their cheesecakes (what they are known for...duh). Always a wait no matter when you go.  This particular location I have never had a problem with. Enjoy!"
Food T.,"Annadale, Staten Island, NY",2,50,31,4.0,7/25/2015,Nice casual diner with the family  real comfort food kale salad was very good kids ate double bacon burgers cooked perfect Cajun chicken was very good will be back
Dhyan H.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",12,16,74,3.0,11/23/2014,Brunch and lunch menu is great. Try chicken Baja hash for brunch. Belgian waffle is great.  Getting table is the worst experience though.
Alexa A.,"Woodrow, NY",163,118,72,4.0,10/24/2015,Love it here so much. Has such a wide selection on the menu and coming for happy hour is alway a great advantage to with small dishes being around 5$ each. Im never disappointed when im here. Always happy with everything.
Rachita B.,"Jersey City, NJ",52,220,188,3.0,9/6/2014,"I am reviewing solely based on a weekday happy hour. I was pretty blown away by the affordable food options and the well priced drink options. On top of that, the service was good and the food was actually tasty. Three stars only cuz my drink was on the weaker side!!!"
