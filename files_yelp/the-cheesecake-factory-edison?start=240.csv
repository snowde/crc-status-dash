Raina G.,"Edison, NJ",3,17,29,2.0,3/25/2016,"their food is decent.. nothing special, other than the fact that their portions are pretty big. I've been here many times before having no issues, however today just ruined my whole perspective of this restaurant. We were told 45 minutes, and after 1hr 30mins we asked them how much longer we would have to wait, and they said about 10 minutes and that they were just setting up. 30 minutes pass and we ask again pretty angrily and so they give us our table then.. the 2 hour wait was not worth it."
Ahmed A.,"Jersey City, NJ",663,359,566,4.0,4/25/2013,Great food and great service. I ordered the shrimp and steak Dante combo and was cooked fresh as to order. Our server was pretty attentive too and we didn't have to wait long to be seated; keep in mind it was a weekday. My favorite cheesecakes are the Reese's peanut butter and Godiva chocolate. But all the cheesecake is awesome just depends on your preference.
May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",432,575,457,4.0,4/7/2013,"One word: LOVE. The only one negative thing I can say about it is during the peak dinner hours over the weekend, it's very hard to get a table. The best thing to do is make a reservation beforehand or stalk the bar and wait for someone to leave. I did that the last time and it saved my boyfriend and I an hour wait for a table. So, plus 1 for being 21 and older! The ambiance: Very nice. Overall, place looks great and has a nice feel to it. It is rather dark in there. At first, I thought it was to hide how their food looks, but I've sat in the outside area a few times, and I must say, with or without light, the food looks and tastes great. The food: Delicious, just delicious. They have a HUGE variety of dishes to choose from, so I can't speak for the entire menu, but everything I've had their is magnificent. To start, their best dish is Chicken Bellagio. It's a tasty pasta dish with breaded chicken, arugula, prosciutto and angel hair pasta dipped in pesto sauce. I must have died recently because this dish tastes like heaven. Their Penne Vodka is also very good. Sauce just hits the spot. I've had their Country Fried Chicken Sandwich here and man is that sandwich big! It was hard to eat, but the chicken was fried perfectly and the chipotle sauce was just the right amount of kick. As for the dessert, the cheesecake is amazing. It's rare that I usually get it because I can't even finish my entire entree, but when I can fit it in, I give it an A+. The price: For the amount of portions they give you, it is totally worth it. As for their drinks, a bit on the pricey side. I didn't try any of their signature drinks. I stuck with a classic Blue Moon, but it costs me like $6. A Blue Moon is not worth that much, in my opinion.  The service: This depends on what time you're going here. When it's not as crowded, they come by more frequently to ask about your meal or refill your drink. However, when it gets really busy, you might see them once throughout your entire meal (not including them taking your drink/meal orders)."
kenji s.,"Saint Charles, MD",2,2,2,3.0,12/24/2015,"The only thing that saves them is the fact that I like the food but the drinks cost almost as much as the food!!! Has to be a NJ thing, def not in MD/DC....never again!"
Abelle N.,"New York, NY",557,1097,516,4.0,2/19/2013,So this is the second time Iv been to the cheesecake and the food has still been amazing as always.. ..The server was super polite and the atmosphere is awesome! For appetizer i order the guacamole spring rolls...best appetizer! Yummy Then for entree I  order the steak with mash...was tender ...mash was very filling... With a side of mushrooms... Cheese cake factory is known for there Big portion! Ordered two cheese cake slices... Got the banana cheese cake and the pineapple upside down cheesecake.... I really enjoyed the banana cheesecake! it was creamy and tasteful.... but the key lime cheesecake was wayyyy to sweet.... I couldn't even taste the creamy cheese cake part... Or any kind of key lime flavor...yuck...don't order it!  Didn't like the fact that you can not make reservation before hand...  i had to wait 30 mins for a table but at least the Cheesecake Factory is inside the mall... which is awesome so I guess the wait is fine :)
Karl K.,"Los Angeles, CA",291,374,3668,3.0,6/6/2010,"Welcome to Americatown! ---------- This place is crazy busy.  It's been Packed to the brim both times I've come in the past month.  I'm not sure who gave them design tips, but who decided to design the place with Roman columns next to a Pharaoh's head, accompanied by random frescos? Completely reminds me of the episode of Simpsons when the family travels to Japan, and they eat at...Americatown :P Anyway, on to the review - the menu: B. reflects their schizophrenic nature. It's 20 pages long, covers multiple cuisine styles, and has ads on the back of each page.     - Nachos: B+. LARGE. A bit oily. I heart nachos.  - Sonoma burger: B-. This is mostly because I didn't like the honey mustard dressing they put on it. I mean, come on! The only place I like honey mustard is in chicken mcnuggets.   -Smokehouse burger: B+. This is much better. Perfect smoky BBQ sauce, with a topping of crispy onion strings. The fries are perfectly crisped, but a bit too salty. I personally don't think it's worth $10.95, but I guess someone has to pay for their interior design fee.   - parking lot: C. It's not their fault that the lot is always packed, but maybe they could learn a thing or two from NYC stackable parking lots (up to 5 cars hoisted one atop the other). - yes I know it's cheesecake factory, but I can get their whole pie from costco at a fraction of the cost. (each slice is $6.95) Overall grade: B."
Vic P.,"Brooklyn, NY",2563,156,1264,4.0,9/28/2012,"Mmmmm... Cheesecake... I always get my cheesecake from here but today i decided to sit down and have dinner. When i first walked in i was greeted by the hostess and was told she would take us to our table. We waited about 2 minutes until someone else showed up and took us to our table.  Our server then came and handed us the menus and asked if we would like something to drink. He never stated his name or made any recommendations or spoke about the specials.  I ordered wings as an appetizer and the chicken tacos as my main course. The wings were zesty and flavorful. I really loved the chicken tacos(4 pieces) it was tasty and pretty healthy. It also came with a side of rice and beans.  Of course for desert i had a slice of heaven, um i mean strawberry cheesecake and it was yummylicious. Overall the waiter was ok, him and the hostess need to practice better customer service skills. The food was pretty good and the cheesecake was awesome. I will definitely be coming back...btw parking is bad around 7/8 pm."
Kevin H.,"Union, NJ",13,84,28,3.0,10/3/2014,"Good place to get cheered up not great for families or dates.  The ambiance is just too noisy, dark, crowded, and has the feel of a night club without the strobe lights. The wait sometimes is frustrating even if you're here early there are already parties that showed up way ahead of you.   Food wise, I think the place needs to give some freebies because the apps are pricey almost as much as entrees.  The entrees also leaves out a lot of things such as bread, salads, or complimentary sides.  You gotta pay for all of that so in the end it cost a lot to eat at this place and you don't really get that much in terms of value. Steaks here are ok, maybe mouthwatering because you waited like over an hour just to sit down, order, and you're starving by the time the food gets here. Some other dishes like pastas are a waste of money here, had better for less nearby. So come here when you lost your job or just broke up because all of the noise and people will keep your mind off of bad things."
Shonila A.,"Keasbey, NJ",0,3,,4.0,6/17/2014,"If you live in central Jersey, this is the place to eat.  I eat here almost every weekend. Love it!  The only bad thing I would say is waaaaaay too long of a wait.  Always 1 & 1/2 hour waits. Then when your buzzer vibrates, another 15-20 minute wait.  All of the waiters/servers are warm and very welcoming."
Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",92,642,796,4.0,1/15/2013,"I've always enjoyed my meals here, from their pasta dishes with pesto sauce to Chicken Milanese (back when that was on the menu), or their chicken with biscuits, or burgers with pesto/mayo sauce.  Not unhappy with anything yet. It does get crowded, but not obnoxiously so. It's conveniently located next to a big mall, and a Barnes Noble, which I appreciate."
Fico P.,"Staten Island, NY",5,36,4,1.0,5/8/2015,"- we went last night for dinner 6 people the restaurant was practically empty and all I have to say is THAT THE SERVICE SUCKED!!!!!!! We help ourselves with spoons from the other table , I have to get up multiple times to ask for damn mustard and ketchup, no plates for the appetizers!!!!  The bread came to the table when we were finishing the appetizers!!!! ONECE AGAIN TERRIBLE SERVICE  on a $225.00 dollar table. SHAME ON YOU !!!  - Sharon H 5/7/15  23:21. Rec 572"
Alishka L.,"Rahway, NJ",77,17,1,1.0,1/2/2016,"So I thought it was just me but my fellow reviewers have proved that it isn't.  I find Cheesecake Factory to be a joke and this location doesn't prove otherwise. Actually, it may make it all a bigger joke.  The largest menu I've ever encountered and yet still, I can't find anything appealing enough to order. I pick something to pick at and a cocktail. The cocktail was great, the food was disappointing to say the least. Not to mention it took forever to come.  It was graduation day and while busy, not busy enough to justify the poor service. I was also inconvenienced by groups of other customers who kept taking constant pictures in the restaurant lobby, blocking the maitre'd who refused to say anything.  Went with a friend and we were mortified at the whole experience. Never again!"
Sawan T.,"Edison, NJ",0,6,3,4.0,11/14/2015,"This is like our second home... Each time we shop in Menlo park over the weekend this where we end up for dinner... Stopped counting cause been that many times. This gets really busy but it's okay to wait for some yummy tummy time. My favorite is calamari, stuffed mushroom new to the entry is crab artichoke dip..."
Stephanie W.,"Elmhurst, NY",18,84,56,5.0,4/5/2014,"A couple of great reasons to visit this particular location...Can Shop at great stores while waiting for your table, Great Food and Great service. We had a large group of 15 and I was extremely impressed with our server.  Despite one really tall male waiter who help serve a couple of dishes (He seemed like he was not happy and was a little rude).  But our main server was super attentive and nice.   Had me a Georgia Peach -Skyy Vodka, Peach Liqueur and Peaches Swirled with Raspberries. Next time may ask to switch the Vodka to Grey Goose. Food: So they fill you up with unlimited Sour Dough and this Yummy Sweet Brown Bread with Oats on top.  MMmm The Brown Bread. My Favorite.  You can't help but to order appetizers, even though knowing that your entree would be too much for you to even finish and you know you would want to have um... Cheesecake? As for appetizers we ordered to share... *Fried Calamari - Perfectly Cooked, Crunchy and not too heavy on Flour. *Fried Mac & Cheese Balls - Crunchy, Creamy, Yummy *Stuffed Mushroom - Probably the best Stuffed Mushrooms I ever had. Perfect Blend of Cheeses and Herbs.  Didn't empower the mushrooms. Good Balance. *Tex Mex Egg Rolls - Fried Good -Sour Cream to Dip - Good - Chicken & Corn - Good *Avocado Egg Rolls - I didn't  eat, due to Allergies with Pine Nut or Sun Dried Tomatoes.  Now Entree... I finally ordered something else besides the Rib Eye...I tried the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and loved it!  Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula  Tossed with Spaghetti and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. But only was able to eat 1/3 obviously cause I was so full from eating apps and brown bread. Yummm. And did my best to save some room for Cheesecake of course.  My better half always orders the same pasta but he loves it... The Chicken Bellagio. Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad. The Fettuccine with Sun Dried Tomatoes and Chicken was just ok my brother said and wished he ordered his regular Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. Luckily I sat next to my friend who ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club.  That sandwich looked so yummy.  She said that the chicken was not dry and she was very happy with her selection.  I was very happy with her selection of Sweet Potato Fries too..lol Dessert... Somehow we manage to stuff some dessert... Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake - * A must order Red Velvet Cheesecake Banana Cream Cheesecake White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake Having my leftovers for lunch today! =)"
Hunny M.,"Staten Island, NY",1,61,7,2.0,8/11/2015,"I've been to this place several times & the food is your typical chain restaurant fare, all salty & greasy as hell. Very limited options for anyone trying to eat even moderately healthy.  The service is usually not too bad, but I've always gone before the big dinner crowd hits.   I recently went on a Monday at about 430 pm, with a party of 3.  At that day & time, the place was less than 1/3 full. I asked the host for a booth & he seated us at a table. When I pointed out the many available booths, he replied that those are for larger parties before walking away. I got up, went back to the front and asked a different person to be seated at a booth. For her, it didn't seem to be an issue, aside from a slight eye roll. Once seated however, the service was fine.  As for the cheese cakes--this restaurants claim to fame--they are ok. Just ok, you ask? They have many different varieties, all very appealing to the eye, but my experience has shown that the fancier ones are very disappointing. One example is the key lime cheesecake. It combines two of my favorite desserts, so I was really excited to try it, but it was a huge let down--sickeningly sweet & not much other real flavor. Ditto for the Oreo cookie variety.  If you do get cheesecake, I think the simpler the better.  This place also gets super loud, even during times when it's not packed. Not sure if it's the acoustics, (high ceilings & marble tile through out) but if noisy places are an issue, be mindful.  For your typical chain restaurant grub, I find the prices pretty high. I don't mind paying for high quality food, but the food is on par with a TGIFs or a Chilis. Dinner for 3, no alcohol & a shared appetizer ran us $90."
Sushovan M.,"Middletown, NJ",2,2,,1.0,4/20/2015,Worst experience. I don't even want to give a rating.  Two major things that went wrong:  1. Our order was given to some other table and manager came to our table after 30 mins that it will take another 2 mins.  We finally got our order after 15 more mins.  2. My credit card was over charged.  I called them up after three days and I provided all the details to Ashley ( manager) she said for sure in three days I will have money reversed in my account.  I thought that would be it but it never got reversed.  I called them again.  This time Ashley wasn't there so call went to senior manager (Ralph ) he again took all details from me and said in couple of days he will get it resolved.  I called them after two days and got to know he didn't come to work last two days and no one knows about it.  I don't know when I will get my 20 dollars back.  I have called them 5 times already.  Everything they say couple of days but so far nothing has happened.
L G.,"Edison, NJ",0,2,3,1.0,12/6/2015,First time since I've been coming that the food was cold. If u can't do it right the first time what good is it microwaving it.
Anthony R.,"Little Elm, TX",5,3,,2.0,12/3/2015,I'm sure not all locations are represented At Menlo Park franchise.Most have been a lot better.But My experience at Menlo Park was a letdown Walked out due to dirty silverware on table If silverware is a representation of kitchen I'll pass
Elizabeth H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",24,76,36,4.0,7/5/2014,"The good: there was absolutely no wait on Saturday night at 6:30pm because it was a holiday weekend.  The Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, my favorite appetizer was perfect.   Not so good: We ordered salads but they did not come out right and I blame the kitchen not the waitress.  My luau salad was supposed to have no onions but I found a few in there. The Chinese chicken salad my husband ordered was supposed to have no dressing but it was served with dressing and he had to wait until I was halfway done to get his salad. The manager came over but did not offer anything as an incentive to return such as take a salad off the bill."
Stephen H.,"Cheltenham, PA",14,3,,4.0,5/28/2016,"The Kobe burger was ok, the chicken stuffed burrito was great,the grilled salmon was a little dry"
