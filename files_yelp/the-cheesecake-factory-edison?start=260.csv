Roxie J.,"Blue Bell, PA",39,5,,1.0,10/8/2015,Not all Cheesecake Factory restaurants are created equal. The one in Edison has terrible service! Long wait for a table..... Then a longer wait for the waiter to show. My son ordered a well done burger with cheese and bacon. Burger came RAW!!! (Seriously-- raw inside) with no cheese or bacon. Manager is not very helpful.
Erina W.,"Brooklyn, NY",152,268,117,3.0,5/8/2014,"The few times I've been here, the service is lacking. In addition to that, the last time I came, the food was super salty. With that being said, I really do enjoy the atmosphere that the Cheesecake Factory offers and the menu selection. However, I don't really like this location."
Sudhir M.,"Rahway, NJ",44,52,223,1.0,5/6/2015,"Went there at about 10pm for dinner. The service was very slow even though there were less number of people and enough servers. I literally had to search for a server and call one. Then had to ask for the bread after not getting it for over 15 mins. They made a mistake in my order and brought the avocado rolls instead of the tex mex eggrolls. And then to top that, the server gave us the check and disappeared.  After 20 minutes of waiting, I had to walk around with the check myself and search another server to take it."
James T.,"Edison, NJ",0,2,,1.0,5/5/2016,On May 5th I ordered takeout dinner and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes. I arrived at the restaurant in 30 minutes and saw two orders waiting to be picked up. I assumed one was mine but the cashier gave both orders to the customer in front of me. I payed and waited. 45 minutes after placing the order (just standing being ignored by the cashier) I asked him to check on my order. He came back telling me the order is being packed up. After an hour I again asked about my order. The cashier then informed me that someone took my dinner so they are redoing it. The manager did offer me a complimentary piece of cheesecake but I refused. The whole experience left me with a bad taste.
Jessica P.,"South Plainfield, NJ",80,15,6,4.0,9/22/2015,"This particular location gets very crowded and sometimes checking in with the hostess on the weekends can be very unorganized. However, the servers and the food is always great and I've always had a good dining experience here. My advice is try to get there a little early to put your name in otherwise you can wait an hour on a Saturday. The parking lot also gets crowded so be prepared to have to park in the mall parking garage. Otherwise you won't be disappointed!"
Charlene R.,"Keyport, NJ",0,8,,3.0,6/8/2016,Love me a California Whiskey sour and some avocado rolls. Especially if you sit outside in nice weather.
Odalis B.,"Plainfield, NJ",8,5,,4.0,9/14/2015,"Great place just not the one in Short Hills Mall location, dirtiest kitchen behind the scenes, employees are so careless, not always wear gloves or change gloves when sneeze, cough etc. Also not very clean behind the scenes. Their Paramus location is cleaner. Good food very affordable prices do not make you wait long to get food too bad always packed and waiting to eat can get tiring."
Annie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,19,12,4.0,6/4/2016,"I love coming here when I'm shopping around here. I have been here too many times to count. The food is usually pretty consistent, price is great, and portions are huge. My favorites are the garlic noodles (optional with chicken) and hibachi steak. Their Parmesan bread is good too, but make sure when they bring it out to turn it over and check the sides, (70% of the time, it's burnt and we have to tell the server to bring it back). This location is better than the other locations I have been to. The service is great and they usually try to accommodate any special requests or substitutions you need/want. Only reason it's 4 stars is because although their food is always consistent and on point, their service and cleanliness is sometimes not. The napkin(s) at our table were dirty and filled with lint and dust, that was very disturbing to look at. We shared a waitress with the table next to us, and for some reason they were offered Parmesan with their pasta, but we weren't asked, (first time it had happened, and not sure why) the server might have been too busy running around and forgot to ask or might have thought the runner had already offered it. But regardless, I do recommend this restaurant and will return."
Lauren E.,"Iselin, NJ",87,14,,3.0,10/24/2015,"I love their food. Can get very crowded and the wait can get very long. Also they are alittle expensive, especially if you want to get drinks. But I usually have a good time when I am there. I can say the last time I was there, the server barely talked to us, we basically only saw him when we put our orders in  and when we checked out. And it wasn't even busy that night. So that's why they only got 3 stars. Otherwise I may have gave 4."
SG S.,"South Plainfield, NJ",0,51,7,3.0,8/31/2015,Your average Cheesecake Factory... Line is always out the door with a really long wait time... Food is always good staff is nice!! Great dinner atmosphere... Not sure if the food is worth the large bill which surprisingly is always somehow large...
Trish R.,"Fords, NJ",10,9,4,2.0,8/29/2015,"I have eaten here a few times & had to go orders. Today was a to go order. I could see my order sitting on the counter & when I am second in line, I don't expect the staff to wait on those behind me before you see what I am there for....good food.....awful would customer service"
Melissa D.,"Matawan, NJ",399,501,699,4.0,9/21/2011,"Love Cheesecake Factory! Consistently delicious food (even if you're a picky eater, there is something for everyone in their huge, extensive menu), large portions, and good prices. I've eaten at a few of their locations and have never had a bad experience with the food.  The last time I ate here was for my bf's bday, we ordered Wings and Calamari for appetizers and for our entrees, we had the Five Cheese Pasta and Chicken Mediera. Everything was delicious! We had so many leftovers that we each had good lunches the next day at work.  Minus one star for the service. Our waitress didn't check up on us much and therefore my glass was never refilled."
Aggie N.,"New York, NY",107,153,128,4.0,1/3/2015,"Long lines, good food. This is a very popular place for dinner, if you don't want to wait in line, come early. My friends and I were enjoying dinner. It's does take a while to receive the bill and even more time to wait for our credit card to be returned. But hey, we are not complaining . Another guest complained to us we are takin long, that she waited two hours for our table. The manger came to appease her-  told her not to dispute other guest (us) and his record showed that she only waited for 30 minutes. He came over and apologise for her behavior. Good service on his part."
Vincent L.,"Staten Island, NY",69,115,353,5.0,9/9/2013,"Please be advised...  If you wish to have cheesecake, DO NOT finish your entree.  You will not make it to the finish line... Finish line being cheesecake (fat people race).  It does not matter if you starve yourself all day in preparation for this meal.  You will be a victim of ""my-pants-too-tightus"".   For starters,  I had Fried Mac n Cheese and Stuffed Mushrooms which are both highly recommended, on top of the soft warm bread and butter.  for the entree, I had the Pasta  Carbonara.  Highly recommended.  A tall glass of Blue Moon to wash my meal down.  Half way through my Pasta Carbonara, I told myself ""Let me stop.  I'm full already. I'll doggy bag this and have it for lunch tomorrow.""  My lack of self discipline got the best of me as I ended up finishing the whole entree.  It proved too much for me to handle as I got hit with the ITIS.  Game over..."
Christina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,42,32,5.0,3/4/2015,I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory. An amazing selection of items to choose from and the best cheesecake I've ever had in my life. The only issue with this particular location is how busy it gets. Sometimes the wait time can even be up to 2 hours. I try to come when it's less busy. For the most part the staff is pretty accommodating.
Tiff H.,"Metuchen, NJ",7,27,10,3.0,6/1/2015,"The service here sucks.  I love their salads but whether I'm doing take out or ordering in, there is always something missing or just wrong. Last night I had take out and my order was ready (well almost, something was missing of course) but the line was so long and while 5 people stood around the front desk having a conversation and the poor guy in the bakery was trying to take orders as well as ring people up.  He needed help and no one offered.  Their management sucks.  They need to fire every manager and start over."
Jessi D.,"Staten Island, NY",25,170,1079,4.0,1/5/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory in Melo Park Mall is a great restaurant. I recommend on busy nights as Thursdays-Saturdays can be a little harder to get a walk in table and may have waits from 30min-1hr 1/2, but it will be worth the wait.       The design is amazing, having large cathedral ceilings w/ excellent paint work. To the wood used on the bar, table and chairs. The restaurant is good for all romantic, family, or friends. Whether its a birthday, anniversary, or just a night out this restaurant has it.       The extended menu options is one reason I continue to come back to Cheescake Factory. I can recommend many dishes I have tried but can honestly say haven't tried something on menu that didn't come out perfect, juicy, or flavorful. The drink specials the Mojitos are a godsend. (Pomergranite is three thumbs up if I had an extra hand). Appetizer would say Avocado Egg rolls definitely need to try and Entree I can say you can never go wrong w/ chicken Romano. Dessert people you came to the Cheesecake Factory and they will not disappoint from traditional to over the top with over 23 styles for the pickings.       The service depends on the waitress/er there have been some over the top and some were subpar. This time around my waitress was perfect catering all request and constantly checking up on drinks. She never let the well go dry nor an extended wait for refill.       I can only give 4 stars cause I do believe they are starting to diminish on food quality  but not quantity."
Arlo D.,"Colonia, NJ",56,148,121,4.0,9/4/2011,"Great food and big portions!! You'll definitely leave here with a big stomach and still have leftovers! Been here a dozen times since I live really close by and never been disappointed once! Great staff and service! Once you get seated you are given two warm rolls of bread, one white and I believe the other is pumpernickel (brown bread LOL). The white usually stays in the basket!  I usually get the calamari for starters! Nice crispy fried calamari with marinara sauce and the other I like to believe is garlic aioli. I've had many dishes from here. My fave is the Chicken Madeira, sauteed chicken breast with asparagus and melted mozz cheese with mushroom Madeira sauce and mashed potatoes, mouthwatering just thinking about it. Lemon Herb is good, Teriyaki Chicken is good, The Four Cheese Pasta is good! Dessert is awesome here too! Over 20 different cheesecakes and other stuff!"
Kyujin K.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",19,14,1,5.0,7/18/2015,"Came here on Friday night around 10 PM and to my surprise, there was no waiting time! The restaurant is huge and very well decorated. There is a cheesecake (bakery?) to the left as soon as you enter the resraurant, to quickly purchase cheesecake if that's what you want. However, be mindful that these cheesecake are hefty in price. Around $8 per slice! The food was great. As soon as we were seated, the waitress brought out a bowl of bread and butter. After looking through the thick menu, my girlfriend and I got the basil pasta with chicken and the smokehouse BBQ burger. The pasta was delicious and the chicken was amazing! The chicken breast was so soft I couldn't believe it! Though for me, the whole pasta was a bit on the creamy side. The burger was also delicious, but the BBQ sauce was a little too sweet to eat with the side of sweet potato fries. As college students, the pricing was a definitely on the higher side compared to our regular meals, but it was nice to treat ourselves at the cheesecake factory. Definitely would visit again!"
Kaylan A.,"San Francisco, CA",9,9,6,1.0,3/27/2016,"I used to enjoy this place, but after developing a gluten allergy I have come to realize it is yet again another mindless chain. It's been difficult for me to find places to indulge without worrying about my allergy so when Cheesecake Factory game out with options, I was so excited. If an establishment goes as far as to boast about its allergy accommodations, one would assume this would be a monitored issue. The staff is clearly uneducated in gluten allergies because I have been there 3 times in the last 6 months and have had an allergic reaction each time. It is the responsibility of the manages and corporate to educate the serves. Allergies are a serious issue, and as someone who suffers from food allergies, this negligence just won't do. So to anyone who wants to eat here, if you want food that is made without thought, or flavor, this is your spot! For the brighter crowd, go somewhere else!"
