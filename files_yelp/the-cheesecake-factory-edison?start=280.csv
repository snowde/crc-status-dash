Bruno F.,"South River, NJ",201,312,56,4.0,4/23/2012,"Yay! Im a fan  Ive been coming here for a few years now, not often but enough times to keep enjoying it.  I had the chicken special. Everything was perfect about the dish. Group of 4 people, so we shared the appetizers. The corn fritters are amazing and I didnt want to share them. The service was quick and our waitress was always watching our table like a hawk. Waiting to be seated took awhile but what do you expect on a weekend.  The cheesecake was amazing!!!! Pricey but worth it"
Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1698,31,3.0,7/10/2013,"Pretty typical Cheesecake Factory with decent service, okay food, and HUGE portions.  My shrimp creole was flavorful with plenty of shrimp, peppers, and garlic in a rather mild, tomato-based creamy broth.  They were more than happy to substitute a mixed greens salad for the rice, so I left comfortably full and not overstuffed.  The fish tacos were also pretty good, and southwest chicken salas (even the lunch portion!) was huge but had a great ranch dressing and a good balance of toppings.  Overall, a good spot to grab a bite while shopping at menlo Park."
J P.,"New York, NY",0,17,1,1.0,3/15/2016,"Wow this place literally just robbed me. Ordered a to go chopped salad with an additional serving of chicken. 17$ , came out PATHETIC. i guess they assume people wont look at the food they order until its too late, which was my case. No avocado no bacon not even half a serving of chicken. Im in complete disgust to have spent all that money on a horrendous salad they made me. Will never eat here again!!!!"
Varun S.,"Mountain View, CA",293,30,,3.0,6/8/2014,"Long wait times for food that is only decent. On occasion, they make you wait a long time if you call them attempting to place a take-out order. Food-wise, they are hit or miss for the most part. However, they do have a wide array if vegetarian, which I appreciate. Their Evelyn's pasta is the best vegetarian dish on the menu. The cheese quesadilla is also pretty good. As a caveat, I am indeed a regular and I equate 3/5 = Good. Just nothing ""send your taste buds to heaven"" fabulous."
Johnny P.,"Plainfield, NJ",1,37,,4.0,7/22/2014,Love me some Cheesecake Factory .  Some of better items in my opinion . Appetizer- Fried Mac N Cheese !! Yum The Beef Pit Sandwich is amazing with the horseradish sauce ! AHHHH! The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp is DELISH!! Did not like the Spicy Cashew Chicken ... Thats personal preference . I'm sure some people love it !! Waiter is hit or miss .. Most of the time GREAT!
Ellen H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",2,8,,5.0,7/18/2015,"Only negative is the long wait time sometimes but I love their food, decor, and generally good service.  Good drinks esp the Mojitos.  Our favorite dishes are the avocado egg rolls, chipotle pasta, and the factory grande burrito.  and of course, can't forget the cheesecake!"
Zhanna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,22,9,5.0,5/31/2015,"Obsoletely great food for the price. My boyfriend and I were invited to the restaurant and were not disappointed. I have to mention, we ordered chicken wings for appetizers, and didn't find them to be anything special. But the main dish made up for the difference. Our server was very attentive, despite being very busy. And the prices pleasantly surprised us. I have a feeling we'll be coming back."
b w.,"Port Monmouth, Middletown, NJ",6,14,2,5.0,7/15/2015,Great food.  This particular location is clean and the wait staff are very experienced.  I have never had a bad experience there.  I love the cheesecake.  Expect to wait awhile to be seated during prime times.  Definitely worth the wait.
Licelot D.,"Newark, NJ",10,1,,4.0,4/11/2015,Good place...We didn't have to wait long but we went on a Wednesday night. Our waiter Miguel was nice. I love the cheesecake factory
Alana M.,"Oxford, United Kingdom",30,105,117,5.0,9/12/2014,Great happy hour from 4 p.m. - 6 p.m. There is a happy hour menu with drinks and food.  The portions are huge for $5 bucks.  I got the quacamole it literally was 2.5 avocados (obviously didnt finish it lol).
Via G.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,137,8,3.0,1/25/2015,"Ordered the lunch portion of salmon genovese...very nice portion! I was satisfied and the salmon was seared nicely. I told them no added salt and they complied. Couscous was plated but looked large almost like pasta..but i ate it anyway. Good service and lunch portions are big enough to feel satisfied. Oh, and i did not have cheesecake :("
Viet T.,"Manhattan, NY",178,16,14,4.0,3/7/2015,Great food.... 20 minutes wait could be up to 40 minutes wait... Make sure you come way ahead of time before you are hungry especially on the weekends.  I wish they would take reservations.
Jason Y.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",470,316,2,4.0,12/4/2013,"One of my favorite chain restaurants around.  The wait staff is very friendly and quick, even though they were extremely busy.  I ordered the Spicy Navajo Pasta that I thought was average.  The others at my table ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo and the Chicken Marsala that I thought was spectacular.  The portions are generous and the bread is pretty good compared to other restaurants that serve bread.  Also, ordered the Thai Lettuce Wrap as an appetizer.  It was solid but there was nothing special about it.  It comes with three dipping sauces (soy based, peanut based, cilantro based) with portions of chicken, noodles, carrots, cucumbers and bean sprouts. Overall, this place is great and would come back in the future."
Christine H.,"Staten Island, NY",11,15,,2.0,1/31/2015,"They only get 3 starts for their drinks and cheesecake. Their food makes me sick. I keep trying it hoping it will get better, but never the less before I leave I am sick to my stomach and vomit all night. The table less and bathrooms were gross and not to mention. .... if you have any kind of anxiety.... Do Not Come Here!.... unless for cheesecake!!!!"
Daniel C.,"East Brunswick, NJ",64,5,,5.0,3/19/2014,"Came when it wasn't nearly as busy as it usually is. It's so much nicer this way. The service is great. The food, while expensive, is extremely delicious and well prepared.  Plazé was a great server. Always catered to my needs. Also, can't complain about their cheesecake selection. Finished my meal with a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake. :)"
Elvi V.,"Avenel, NJ",0,30,,4.0,2/11/2015,Went for lunch on a Saturday. It was half full. We got the southern fried chicken sliders and they were delicious. I got the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries which was also delicious and huge portion. My husband got the burger and he enjoyed it. The service was excellent I would definitely recommend this location.
Ranee A.,"South Plainfield, NJ",20,39,,2.0,4/4/2013,"The food is decent and the service can definitely be better.  My husband and I ordered a burger to be cooked at medium-rare but the burger came out prepared well-done.  We informed our waiter, he apologized, but did not seem to care at all.  When we asked if the 'skinny' cocktails were prepared with Splenda or Equal our waiter responded with, ""probably"".   Pros: Convenient for proximity to the mall Decent food with a wide variety Full bar Healthy menu options Fairly big portions Cons: Wait staff needs to be better trained Does not take call ahead seating or reservations Always crowded"
Cez R.,"Palisades Park, NJ",4,23,,1.0,1/18/2015,"I will not come back with this branch the staff is b### S###, my friend & I come to grab a cheese cake & loaf bread, we waited 20 mins just for the brown loaf bread and when I asked the staff Nicole she said just wait when she comes back she drop the bread into the floor & throw the other one at the counter I was surprised & pissed me off, it seems like she do it intentionally for us to wait again and to control my self I said just cancel and refund the payment but they did not anyway it's just $7.40 keep it guys"
Troy L.,"Edison, NJ",2,7,2,4.0,2/14/2015,"Wow first time here in years and they have not missed a beat. Despite the long wait (Valentine's rush, not at all upset) the staff was still spot on and food was up to par. Finished off with a key lime cheesecake and left full and happy."
George S.,"Manchester Township, NJ",2,40,41,5.0,10/13/2013,"The ultimate venue for cheesecake of almost any flavor/combo.  They also have a great selection of appetizers & main courses. Prices are reasonable, wait staff is friendly, & atmosphere is lively."
