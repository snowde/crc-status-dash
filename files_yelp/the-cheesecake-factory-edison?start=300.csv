Roxana J.,"Metuchen, NJ",169,128,65,4.0,5/20/2014,"The wait time to eat here is definitely a deterrent when deciding on places to eat but the food is consistently good. My favorites are the buffalo blast appetizer, the thai lettuce wraps app, the shrimp and steak Diane combination, Evelyn's favorite pasta, the meatloaf, and the miso salmon. As for desert, I like the original plain cheesecake with a cappuccino. I recommend doing the very convenient parking spot takeout during peak hours."
Sonia P.,"New York, NY",4,25,3,3.0,12/27/2015,"I am assuming this location gets a lot of customers just because they're located within a really big and busy mall, but waiting for over an hour? Come on. They really need to start taking reservations. We pulled through though and the food was mediocre as well as the service. The place was PACKED and I understand that there were a lot of tables to tend to but our waiter was basically MIA. I ordered the quesadilla without sour cream and the quesadilla was meh, okay... by the time it had arrived, it was getting cold and the cheese was not melted, nor was the wrap crispy. It looked like it had been thrown together last minute, to be honest. I ate all of it though because I was really hungry and then ordered a chocolate cake (I forgot the name) but I took it to go because the restaurant was starting to get reaaaally crowded. The cake was AMAZING, perfectly moist, gooey, and just overall chocolate goodness. I was so happy I took it to go because I had it with some milk and in the comfort of my (quiet) home. I'd definitely go back to Cheesecake Factory... just not this location!"
Sarah T.,"Cranford, NJ",89,10,,5.0,1/28/2015,Had a great lunch here! Started with the avocado egg rolls which are amazing I'm not sure what the sauce is called that they serve it with but it's extremely tasty! For my entree I ordered the lunch portion Santa Fe salad which was still huge but delicious. Finished with a piece of peanut butter cheesecake and added some raspberry sauce too soo good! Staff was friendly and very attentive. I know that this location often gets very busy and has long waits so try it for lunch you will not be disappointed!!
Liz J.,"Caldwell, NJ",220,162,110,5.0,7/2/2013,What is not to love. Its the Cheesecake factory. My favorite chain and my favorite location. They have not fallen off yet. Great drinks and great service. I love Sunday's brunch menu. Across the board the brunch menu should be expanded.
Barbara S.,"Metuchen, NJ",0,68,,1.0,1/19/2016,Worst. Food. Ever.  And the worst service. Plus incredibly unhealthy.
Joshua S.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",128,26,286,5.0,8/31/2013,"As with the other cheesecake factory in bridgewater, this cheesecake factory is on par, great cheesecake and just as great service, will come back."
Anne P.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",48,33,11,5.0,8/30/2013,We had a fabulous experience eating lunch here today! I had the luau salad and my mom had a burger. Both entrees were delicious. Also tried the s'mores cheesecake - super rich but very tasty.  This is one of the few chain establishments I will frequent.
Katherine T.,"South Burlington, VT",5,13,3,4.0,3/16/2013,"Always have good experiences in any Cheesecake Factory location! Food and drinks from the bar are always great! Waiting time for food at this particular location is a little long but worth it. Portions are a bit over sized, great if you like leftovers, not so great if you don't. Went to this location while on business in NJ. I personally ordered the Garlic Buttered noodles with shrimp. YUMMY! Was so awesome! Coworker 1 ordered the same but with chicken and shrimp. She loved it. Coworker 2 ordered the jambalaya (and she's from KY) and thought it was very good. Coworker 3 ordered a Cajun pasta dish and liked it as well. Overall, I only have good things to say, other then the wait time for the food. :)"
Dave B.,"Reinach, Switzerland",0,41,11,1.0,6/29/2014,"What a sh*t hole.  Tables were filthy, I asked for 3 separate silverware servings - all had baked food and Guk on them.  I walked out.  Too bad- I like CCF normally."
Masooda S.,"North Brunswick, NJ",0,13,6,4.0,11/19/2015,"I've had a few bad experiences here in the past where we've had to deal with really rude waiters and burned food, but recently I've been coming here quite often and have been pleased with the food and service. My favorite dishes here are the grilled chicken tostada salad and the Louisiana chicken pasta. Both are excellent every time I order them. Oh and the cheesecake is always on point."
Crystine W.,"New York, NY",753,1201,281,4.0,3/17/2011,"When you're tired from shopping Menlo Park Mall & you want to eat a little better than the food courts, Cheesecake Factory is always a pleaser for everyone.  They have an extensive menu with different items and cuisines, plus their chefs have basically mastered making all of them so your  Their customer service is amazing - the servers are always extremely tentative to our needs.  I have had different servers each time I went there & always had a pleasant experience.  Oh, and the white uniforms really flatter majority of body types :).   I love getting their Thai Lettuce Wraps or their Cobb Salad for my entree.  Their pastas are excellent as well, but I generally don't like to eat something so heavy after walking the mall & shopping for deals.  Their cheesecakes are mmm-mmm-good!  Definitely in love with their Dulce de Leche cheesecake - and that mound of whipped cream they give tastes really good too, idk what's so special about it, but it's different than what other restaurants offer."
Dana R.,"South Plainfield, NJ",0,57,19,2.0,11/16/2015,The food was horrible. I had to send the steak back it was burnt. Also the Sangria did not taste right. The person didn't know how to make it. It was missing stuff. Won't go back!!
Cassandra G.,"Avenel, NJ",8,49,30,4.0,10/21/2014,I like this restaurant. Definitely a date night restaurant. I feel under dressed walking in here sometimes. I definitely try to look more appropriate when I know we're going here. The food is good. There's lots of options to chose from.
Suzy K.,"New Brunswick, NJ",163,3,2,5.0,2/2/2015,"Everyone must already know this place, but I just wanted to recommend the avocado eggrolls! I think that is what they were called. Anyways, they are part of the appetizer menu, and I fell in love with them! I wish I knew the recipe so I can try to make some at home as well. I've been craving them for a while now. I'll probably be going back soon for more."
Lucy H.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,3,,2.0,7/28/2014,"Always a great restaurant but notoriously long wait times. Went at 8pm on Saturday night and was given a wait time of 60-80 minutes. Waited 60 minutes, went back to the counter and was told that it would be another half hour. Also, the pagers don't work outside of the restaurant so we had to stand inside the cramped waiting area. Waited the half hour, at this point it is 10:30. Went back to the counter to point out the empty table for 5 that had not been filled for 20 minutes. The hostess turned around, pressed the button to call our pager and then told us that we were being paged right now. Our waiter and food was perfect. When giving a wait time, the time given is supposed to be the maximum time the party may wait. Very disappointed that we waited longer than originally quoted. Usually a big fan of this restaurant but will probably just go to Champs or the new Seasons 52 next time."
John R.,"Warren, NJ",152,1133,296,3.0,2/23/2011,"Cheesecake Factory? I never thought of ever going here based on the name but I am glad I now know it is much more than dessert. The offerings come from a very large menu and seem to cover almost every desire. My favorite menu item for lunch has become the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club - Charbroiled Shrimp, Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato with Our Special Dressing. Served with French Fries or Green Salad."
Gina R.,"Kensington, MD",42,107,87,3.0,8/29/2014,I stopped here on my way home from CT. As usual the food was good but the wait time was longer than any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to and my waiter seemed very busy. He barely checked on me and I never even got a refill on my drink. Since I was traveling and anxious to get back on the road the length of time waiting for food and lack of attention from the waiter was frustrating.
Alex F.,"Roselle, NJ",71,57,31,5.0,8/11/2012,"Man this place gets busy at times, but it doesn't change my mind about this place.  The food is delicious and the prices are $$-$$$ I recommend the teriyaki chicken along with a Pina colada. Oh boy, dying of hunger just thinking about it. I always finish a meal and this i can never finish. The flavors are intense and i get it every time. The Cons: I don't like the non booth seating because i feel like I'm rubbing elbows with the group next to me, kinda awkward. Overall: A+ & staff is very polite and engaged in conversation"
James K.,"El Cerrito, CA",231,467,155,3.0,5/30/2010,"I come here quite a bit. The food is not always delicious but there is a large selection so I never feel bored. They have many kinds of cuisine such as pasta, Thai, Mexican, grill, etc. Every plate is large, so I could never have an appetizer, an entree, AND a dessert. Two out of three is a good amount. The dessert menu is also quite extensive, although it is mostly cheesecake. My favorite cheesecakes are the Godiva, key lime, pumpkin (only available in the fall), and vanilla bean. It's quite sizable and comes with two scoops of whipped cream.  I've tried many things on the menu, although I can't remember most of them now. The dishes weren't very memorable, but none were too terrible either. One of my favorites is the tuna tartar salad. Also recently I ordered the steak diane, which came with a mushroom sauce served with onions and mashed potatoes. I thought the mushroom sauce was delicious. The service is usually quite attentive and nice, and a specific part of the decor reminds me of Sauron's eye, which amuses me. Also, the wait here is generally quite long, but there is a Barnes and Noble right next door good for killing time."
Nando J.,"Somerset, NJ",1,5,4,4.0,8/16/2013,The only issue I have is that the menu is waaaaaaay too large. It's like reading a thick magazine. Too many choices just makes it longer to order. Menu Overload!!! Also I don't like the plastic mugs they use for water. They look like the ones you serve Root Beer Floats in. Portions are very large and I always find myself getting my meal to go because of it.
