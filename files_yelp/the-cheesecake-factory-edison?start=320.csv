Claudette Y.,"Elizabethport, NJ",2,15,3,4.0,10/23/2014,"To start off, the wait time was amazing. Just walked in and was seated immediately. Waitress brought out drinks and bread right away. Now I'm eating the delicious Asian lettuce wraps and my salmon, maybe not the best but it's still delicious. Everytime I come to CF I'm always trying something new in the menu and I have not been disappointed so far. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Great location as well, right next to the mall! Wish there was one close to my house so I can order every now and then but this will do! Love this place :)"
Douglas M.,"Elizabeth, NJ",16,13,,2.0,9/25/2014,"Food is good, as is the service. Seating arrangement is horrendous and noise level is through the roof. I could barely hear myself think never mind my girlfriend. I was so close to other people I could hear everyone else's conversations. I was in half an arms length of the next table. For what I paid I definitely would've expected a better experience. I will not be coming back here."
J T L.,"Edison, NJ",65,66,22,5.0,9/10/2014,"Get the avocado egg rolls!!!!! These suckers are amazing. The sauce/eggroll combination are something my wife and I crave frequently. Aside from that, this location is like any other Cheesecake Factory. They always have a large variety, great food, inexpensive happy hour, and of course cheesecakes that'll melt in your mouth. I like the wait staff as well."
Tara W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",458,565,130,3.0,1/12/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is my guilty pleasure. I have eaten at some amazing restaurants so I should know better than to like a mall restaurant that blares muzak and has a catalog interlaced with their menu. But they really do make big, delicious, creative salads so I keep coming back."
David P.,"Montclair, NJ",130,81,44,3.0,5/31/2012,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the cheesecake factory? Nothing. But ill give my quick thoughts anyhoo. Love it or hate it the cheesecake factory will be around forever, the proof is in how extremely busy they always are. Food is decent (hey with such an expansive menu there's gonna be something for everyone) and the service is just okay. Staff seems friendly but a little too busy, bordering inattentive. I give three stars because it's cheesecake. You'll get a solid meal of decent food, big portions and the ambiance is pretty nice. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's a safe pick, and sometimes I'd rather live a little :)"
Nad Z.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,24,4,5.0,12/28/2014,Best place for dining in. Great food. Had the spicy cajun chicken and it was delicious.  First time but definitely wont be the last.
John D.,"Naples, FL",1,38,,3.0,5/7/2014,"Food is very good. Drink prices are to high. Waiters & waitress' are great but the hostess' crew are the DUMBEST on the planet, they actually think there job is difficult, their attitude should get them fired so they can go make french fries at burger king. We go late at night because we will not wait, ANYWHERE, to eat at a chain restaurant. Plus, we dont enjoy eating near people and their loud children who act like savages in public places."
Amanda D.,"Newark, NJ",344,245,42,4.0,4/9/2012,"I've eaten here many times and never had a bad experience.  There is so much to choose from on their menu. Even if you're a picky eater, there is something for everyone in their huge, extensive menu.  I don't think I've ever tried something on the menu that I haven't liked. Portion size is big and prices are pretty reasonable. The Menlo location does get crowded, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, but they usually manage the wait efficiently. Service is quick and attentive. Our waitress constantly came over to our table to check up on us. Between 4 people, we shared the chicken samosas, sweet corn fritters, and the guacamole as appetizers. Everything was delicious! I had the Fettuccine with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes as my entrée, which needless to say, was really good. After we were done with our entrees, there was still a lot food left over.  How can you come to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake for dessert? There are about 26 different types of cheesecakes you can choose from! I always order the same one (Key Lime)  all the time. Overall, it's a great atmosphere..."
Carmella L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",39,78,2,4.0,9/3/2014,"Yes, I know this is a chain restaurant but The Cheesecake Factory has never let me down. I went here with a group of friends for breakfast and ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and they where very good. Very light and fluffy and not rubbery which is what you get with some other chain breakfast places. Plus, their salads are pretty awesome. You get a lot of salad for the price, and it fills you up afterwards. Also, I'd suggest the vanilla bean cheesecake. It is by far one of my favorites.  I have never been here for dinner but, I'm sure it's a good bet to at least give a shot being that they have so many menu options."
John B.,"Metuchen, NJ",1,9,,3.0,12/15/2014,"Generally great though I've had some issues with quality of service (for example, last visit I made my drink came in a dirty glass). Overall - I really enjoy the food and that's enough to get me to go again.  That said, I'll be a little more cautious with overall quality in the future."
Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",251,682,365,5.0,11/22/2012,"I continue to love this place.  New favorite appetizer is the avocado rolls with a chutney sauce for dipping.  Great!  For the first time, in a non-Italian restaurant, I ordered a pizza.  I had the vegetable pizza with goat cheese.  Not only were the toppings delicious but the crust was exactly how I have been unable to find it in NJ; thick and very crispy.  I love my pizza crusts very crispy.  Who would have thought that after all these years in NJ, I found a pizza place I love and it's the Cheesecake Factory?"
Joseph M.,"Matawan, NJ",5,31,,1.0,8/23/2015,"If you want to starve go to this restaurant. Service is poor, we had to wait 15mins before server took our drink order. Also food is not as good as before. I used to order shrimp scampi with steak diane. $21 for 3 pieces of shrimps and 3 small steak cuts plus mashed potato. It used to be great years ago. I dont know what happened maybe its just the Edison branch in NJ."
Shannon L.,"Hayward, CA",1,71,,4.0,8/22/2014,"If you know anything about the Cheesecake Factory you should know that you will have a 30-60 min wait MINIMUM. Once you get past that, their food and drinks are always good and the Cheesecake Factory menu options are enormous!"
Freddy F.,"Edison, NJ",0,15,2,1.0,9/13/2014,"This for the Menlo Park location. Waited in front of host desk for several minutes while girl had head buried in computer, after some time she looked up and said ""I'll be with you right away"" after few more minutes she just disappeared into restaurant, we waited for few more minutes then decided to leave for food court."
Angela A.,"Linden, NJ",15,4,,4.0,9/12/2014,The food here is always consistently good and the service is good also. However my date and I were supposed to have a wait time of 15 minutes and an hour had passed by and we still weren't called. I thought that maybe our buzzer was broken and so my date brought it to the front desk and sure enough it was broken. It was annoying but we were seated immediately after that and put in front of everyone else in the line to be seated and I appreciated that. Overall not too bad of an experience and I will continue to come here.
Jesus M.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,19,508,5.0,9/4/2012,"It was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. My fiance and I would always mention that 1 day we're going to eat there.  OMG! we had no idea it was so beautiful!  I was in the mood for cheesecake and figured why not The Cheesecake Factory! It proved to be the best decision of the week outside of dinner at Ricardo's steakhouse!  While waiting for my slice of heaven I glanced over the menu. Wow! I cannot wait until this weekend!  I'll definitely have something to say about the food,  until then so far they're a perfect 5!"
Jeff M.,"Jersey City, NJ",2245,700,6117,4.0,2/13/2010,"If you love big portions at a great price and very good food. You have come to the right place.  Their calamari comes with two amazing sauces which you have to try.  Roadside slider burgers are very good.  They give you two types of warm bread with butter while you wait.  My complaints is that the butter they give you is hard and cold...Id rather have them give me whipped butter!  Entrees I usually rotate whenever I go here, because i can never decide, they are too good! 1. Lemon Herb Chicken 2. Crispy Beef 3. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, I usually give the shrimp to my wife. For dessert: over 20 different kinds of cheescake! and other things! Im definitely a fan of cheesecake factory! Oh yeah another thing its busy all days of the week. So come early!"
Judy B.,"Rahway, NJ",0,6,,1.0,11/14/2015,"Horrible experience! I understand on a Saturday night over an hour wait so we changed our minds and decided to get dessert and eat somewhere else. Bad idea, very disorganized and that alone took over 20 minutes then she gets my order wrong because it's so loud she could t even hear me!! I was so frustrated I walked out without getting the cheesecake I wanted!!! Never again!"
Christine D.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",72,7,3,2.0,8/20/2014,"This used to be my favorite restaurant in the entire world. My favorite dishes were the Pasta DaVinci and the Veggie Burger. The past handful of times I have been here the service has progressively gotten worse and worse. Servers not waiting on you as fast, not bringing you bread, etc. I came here so often that I knew exactly what they were trained to do each time they had a new customer. Not only has the service gone down, but the food has also changed drastically. Apparently they changed the veggie burger, but made no notation in the menu whatsoever that it is now spicy. I just don't get it. This certainly isn't my favorite place anymore and the food is not worth the price. :("
Shaun T.,"Middlesex, NJ",46,99,23,4.0,1/31/2014,One of my favorite chains. The food is great and the portion control is great. They have the tastiest appetizers and they are plentiful. Their menu is like war and peace. Their salads are awesome. As different as their menu is I think that their beer menu can change. They have special girly drinks for the ladies but their beers on tap is small. Would love to see them mix it up with some microbrews and maybe some diff tap beers.
