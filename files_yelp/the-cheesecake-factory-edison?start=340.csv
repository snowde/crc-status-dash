Taylor E.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,9,1,4.0,10/27/2014,Went for my friends birthday. Everything was amazing. Service was a bit slow but you could tell it was busy so it was understandable. Food was good and they sang happy birthday for both of my friends. Will definitely be going back
Erduan H.,"Iselin, NJ",0,5,,1.0,9/5/2014,Cheesecake factory was my favorite plac I went For dinner with my kids. We order some of the Appetizers We wait 35 minutes !

Alexis C.,"Hazlet, NJ",149,8,1,2.0,8/30/2015,"Very disappointed with my service tonight. I have dined at the West Palm Beach Cheesecake Factory  location many times and had wonderful experiences there. My boyfriend had never dined here so tonight I decided to take him out for my treat. Sundays is our day together so we always go out to eat and see a movie. I am a server myself so I know better than most how difficult this job can be. Our server tonight was Juan. He did greet us promptly but when I asked if they could serve a Miami Vice cocktail, which is just a combination of two drinks already on their menu, he said they couldn't do it even after I explained to him what the drink was. I ordered a Pina Colada instead and my boyfriend ordered one of  their margaritas. Instead of bringing our drinks together,  he brought my drink out and then my boyfriend's drink five minutes later. He took our order when we were ready. I then informed him that we only had one setting of silverware for the two of us. He said he would be right back with it. Our app came out but we still only had one set of silverware so we had to ask our food runner to bring us a set, which he did right away. We finished our app and recieved our dinner. All the food came out fantastic. While eating my boyfriend finished his first drink and put it on the end of the table. Juan passed by his empty glass three or four times and proceeded to sit with another of his tables directly behind us. He sat with this table and talked with them about how boring his job was and how he didn't want to go inside because "" then they will make me work."" This table then asked if he had any other tables to which he responded ""no, i don't really have any other tables."" All this while my boyfriend sat there with an empty drink and would probably not even have gotten silverware if it had not been for Juan's coworker. Finally my boyfriend called him over to ask if he was still our server and if he could have another drink. Without any apology my boyfriend recieved his second drink fifteen  minutes after finishing his first. The rest of our dining experience felt rushed; Juan came over a few times to ask if we wanted our food wrapped even though our drinks and plates were still 3/4 full. In the end, our bill was $108, I left an $18 tip for our horrible service and called it a night. Should have gone to McDonald's instead. Very disappointed tonight, especially from a fellow server's standpoint. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt which is why I still left a decent tip but in my opinion I would have been better off getting take out. Management needs to make sure their servers are happy and want to be there. I found out this server has been there for about a year and that blows me away. If you are not happy and don't want to do the work that your job entails,find another job more well-suited for you, Juan."
Matt M.,"Staten Island, NY",2,4,,1.0,11/20/2011,"So we just got back from dinner,I  ordered the meatloaf . it was absolutely in eatable. I sent it back and asked to have it removed from the bill. When I got the bill the meat loaf stated ""comp serv"" underneath which would lead anyone to believe that it was deducted. Good thing I did the math, just cause it said ""comp serv"" didn't mean a thing. I was still charged . How many times has this happened and others paid for something that they believed was taken off the bill.  Spoke to the manager, his costumer service skills are lack at best."
Sophia C.,"Marlboro, NJ",222,121,110,3.0,10/1/2012,"I had avocado rolls, which were and always are fantastic. Fried cheese pieces (sorry I forgot what they were called) they tasted mostly like fancy mozzarella cheese sticks in triangle form. They were yummy, but then again, it's not hard to go wrong with that, right? Then I had the wasabi-crusted ahi tuna entree that the waiter recommended. I loved the wasabi crust, it had a mild taste of wasabi, and was fried crispy good. BUT THE FISH. :( What a let down. I really enjoy eating cooked fish in general, I enjoy salmon, tuna, tilapia, deep sea bass, flounder...and also eating raw fish, I enjoy most sashimis. BUT, this fish had a very strange flavor and texture. I don't know, maybe I just don't like ahi tuna...or they cooked it wrong? Hrm. Who knows? I just gotta try it again somewhere else.  The water with lemon was surprisingly bad. I know that most restaurants use tap water for their water as it is free and the ice usually hides the ""tap water"" taste, but nope. Not here! I get water at almost every restaurant I go to unless I am craving a specific drink. I would think that cheesecake factory, since it isn't a cheap restaurant, would at least make sure their water tastes okay. The onion ring was not good and the fries were mediocre. Now, onto dessert! MMMM! I got the kahlua cocoa cheesecake and my friend got the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. DELICIOUS! I have absolutely no complaints about these cheesecakes. We also got nice large cappuccinos to go along with them. I appreciated the cappuccinos because they were frothy, in between warm/hot, and huge. I was very satisfied with the dessert.  The server was friendly and quick to serve.  So all in all, I give this place a 3 out of 5."
Christian F.,"East Brunswick, NJ",185,52,1,2.0,4/6/2013,"I haven't had a REALLY bad experience like some of the reviewers here but it's not exactly the best food you can get in Edison (or even Menlo Park Mall). The waitstaff is actually sort of nice but they're not very prompt...it seems as though they rotate experienced servers with new hires commonly. Their salads are great and most of the sandwiches are good as well. I wouldn't go for any of the main entrees, though. And, unless you're planning on getting a drink that's not watered down (i.e., a Grey Goose martini up with olives, in my case), don't plan your night out there."
Kyle G.,"Princeton, NJ",8,9,,1.0,1/25/2013,I'm going to make this short and sweet.  $2.95 for a soda... two people.. Total bill was roughly $30.00 AFTER tip.  This being said: I'm glad that when my two sodas encompass around 25% of my total bill I sit there from start to finish with 0 refills.   Way to be on top of things.
Ben R.,"Blue Bell, PA",2,6,,1.0,1/13/2014,Ugh! I always associate a restaurant's cleanliness with the way they maintain their bathrooms.  Went this past Saturday night and the men's room was unusable. One urinal had a plastic sheet over it and the other had wads of paper stuffed in it and water had flooded the floor so the only toilet was unusable and the room smelled of urine. As wonderful as Cheesecake Factory is this caused me to lose my appetite. I hope the wait staff and kitchen have their own restroom facilities and it is cleaner and functional.
Al L.,"Monroe Township, NJ",0,12,5,5.0,8/7/2014,"If you are looking for a great menu loaded with variety, this is the place for you!   The menu is almost too big, but it provides a huge variety for every taste.  Whether Asian, Italian, American, or Vegetarian - everyone is sure to find something they like.  For a chain style restaurant, the food is always fresh and expertly prepared.  I'm always pleased with the speed the food arrives at the table, considering the number of patrons.  Well done!"
Ganlin H.,"Hicksville, NY",3,28,1,4.0,9/16/2014,"As a foreigner, come as a TBBT fan."
Nancy K.,"Austin, TX",27,105,41,3.0,9/26/2011,"I usually don't review chain restaurants but I remember when they built the Cheesecake factory at Menlo Park Mall and I've been enough times to memorize the menu. A few years ago, I would have given this place 5 stars. I loved the ambience, loved the huge food selection, loved the taste of the food. Recently, the quality has just gone downhill. Last time I came, I ordered the Chicken bellagio and it tasted like someone accidentally spilled an entire salt shaker on it. I also ordered Avocado eggrolls (still a personal favorite) and they were sold out. Asked for a mango smoothie and the waitress forgot about it for an hour so we just nixed it but she put it on our check anyways.  The wait here is usually quite long and despite the worsening quality of the food, the ambience is still very nice for a group of people. If you don't want to take a buzzer and wait an hour, you can always look over at the tables near the bar where you can seat yourself."
Anthony C.,"Holmdel, NJ",9,80,,4.0,8/29/2012,"Very classy interior as most cheesecake factories are. It wasn't all that busy, since I went as a group of four during a weekday lunchtime. I really love the pumpernickel bread (the brown colored bread with oats on it), the guac and chips were ok, everything pizza was ok, and the farfalle was good. Main reason why I added an extra star is because of the cheesecake. It's a bit pricey, but I really adore cheesecake, even though it is a bit pricey. Over the course of the day, we had 2 of the special oreo cheesecakes, the coconut chocolate, and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, all of which were rich and fluffy :)"
Ashley O.,"Edison, NJ",0,15,13,2.0,7/8/2015,"I wasn't impressed by the Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess who greeted us was rude and the restaurant itself wasn't very clean. The floor near where we sat had bow tie pasta on the floor and there was still food stuck to the fork I was given. There wasn't really any wait time, but I went on a week night (Monday). The food was average. We ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms, which were small but tasty, and Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, which was good but VERY garlic-y with rather large chunks of chicken."
C G.,"Stowe, VT",3,110,16,4.0,6/17/2012,"We ate here before going to see a movie.  As usual, it's difficult to make a decision as what to eat because the menu is extensive.  If you can't find something to eat here, you're way too picky.  I had the New Orleans Shrimp with brown rice.  It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was good.  My wife had a salad and one of the small tuna plates.  She is a picky eater and she enjoyed it.  The waitress was attentive and asked if I wanted a refill on my soda.  That was good.  She brought the check when she brought dessert (red velvet cheesecake, which was excellent!) but there was no pressure to eat and pay quickly. We ate outside, mainly because it's too noisy inside.  Outside was great except there was a water drip from the gutter on the building (it hadn't rained in a while).  Since there were only two of us sitting at a table for 4, I was able to move.  However, if there were 4 of us dining, I would have asked for a different table.  There was food on the ground, so I guess they only clean at the end of the night.  It wasn't too bad, just noticeable."
Alana P.,"Staten Island, NY",42,22,1,4.0,9/7/2012,"I've been here a few times before but this time I went for just dessert, as the portions are always so filling that I never want dessert. I had the banana cheesecake and it was delicious. It was light and creamy and had a lot of bananas on the side. Cappuccino was OK. I did miss my Usual order of Mac and cheese balls - so good!  Service in this place usually seems a bit slow to me... I often tell the waiter/waitress I'll be ready in a few minutes and then they come back, bring me my drink and walk away without asking if I'm ready. Then they take another 10 minutes to come back. That's really my only complaint though..."
roderick A.,"Jersey City, NY",188,768,308,3.0,6/15/2009,"This was the official opening of Roderick's 2009 Chain Restaurant Tour, and what an opening day it was. This was my very first time at a Cheesecake Factory and what a way to break my cherry (more on that later).  The great thing is that Cheesecake Factory takes reservations, so hopefully that will help future diners. And good thing we had one, because when we got there, on a lazy Saturday afternoon no less, the wait time was an hour.  So we only waited about two minutes before we were seated.  Before ordering, I got text message upon text message suggesting what I should order. I got Baja Chicken Tacos, a Crabcake sandwich, Shepherd's Pie and other ideas. Instead I ordered the ""lunch sized portion"" crusted chicken romano, which is breast of chicken coated with a Romano and Parmesan Cheese Crust, and served with Pasta in a Light Tomato Sauce.  I can't even imagine what the regular sized portion looks like, because my entree was so huge it would make Oprah Winfrey full - that's how big it was.  And of course, since this is Cheesecake Factory, I ordered a cheesecake. But not just any cheesecake, mind you, but the Oreo cookie cheesecake. That's right, because a cheesecake just isn't enough for me I had to get one where every bite contained at least 200 dozen Oreo pieces, it seemed. Need I say it was the best part of the meal? No, I don't think I do. And yes, it had a cherry on top, thus my breaking the aforementioned cherry. And because this is located at Menlo Park Mall, you can walk off all the calories you just gained by shopping inside one of the better malls in the Dirty Jerz. Oh well, I think my days of being a chain restaurant snob are slowly but surely coming to an end. See y'all at Chili's!"
Stephanie M.,"New York, NY",4,160,183,5.0,3/30/2014,"Always love it here. Food is amazing, the wait is average about 30 to 40 minutes. There are so many seating options, bar seats, bar tables, booth, half booth, or table. There are so many choices for food. Before 5pm they have specials, and on Sundays before 2 they have brunch. Love the Mac n cheese, crispy crab wontons & the desserts too. I would definitely recommend it. I've been to this one and freehold both are very good."
Patrick C.,"Woodbridge, NJ",0,86,,5.0,8/6/2015,"I am a huge Cheesecake Factory fan and this is the only one I know of. There menu is huge and all the food and cheesecake is good. I've been many times. Good for a first date, a little bit fancier than the average restaurant."
Georgia C.,"New York, NY",0,6,,1.0,6/15/2014,"Had to wait for 30 mins to get seated, not the 15-20 mins as expected. The hostess claimed I was paged, but my pager never went off. Then she told me I would be seated next. Never happened. I brought it to her attention and then she finally decided to seat me only b/c her manager was around.   I will not come back here. Very overrated restaurant."
Bumble B.,"New York, NY",19,233,33,5.0,8/24/2013,"My hubby and I went here for lunch for my b-day a few weeks and we were pleasantly surprised at how pretty and fancy the restaraunt was. We were expecting to look more like Olive Garden. We were seated right away. Because it was lunch time, it wasn't extremely busy. I ordered the lunch parmesan crusted chicken w/ spaghetti and my hubby ordered the orange chicken with veggies and white rice. We shared the appetizer- fried mac n' cheese. OMGGG! @ the mac n' cheese. It was delicious. Tge rest of the food was really good too. We were too full to try their cheesecakes but at $7+ per slice, it's all good! lol A great experience!"
