Ryan M.,"Westfield, NJ",2,15,2,4.0,6/13/2015,"What else can you say, really? The food is always awesome. I will say though, that the waitstaff could probably be a little more attentive and personable. Otherwise, I've never had a bad experience with the food. Definitely recommend and love the Louisiana pasta."
Roshan D.,"Edison, NJ",0,14,,3.0,7/22/2014,I love the hospitality and the welcoming environment. Of all the delicacies my favorite is the Avocado Eggrolls. Its mighty filling and satisfying! However the wait times are discouraging. Always 1+ hour in waiting time makes me think twice.
Stephanie G.,"Weehawken, NJ",93,177,1,4.0,8/1/2011,"I very recently came here in celebration of National Cheesecake Day with my boyfriend. Every time I've been here for dinner, I've never been disappointed with the quality of food, or the portions (which easily feed a family of four, no joke.. ) We both ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles, which was spicy cajun chicken with honey mustard and BBQ sauces on the side, with sides of mashed potatoes and succotash. It was all very tasty and filling, and I particularly enjoyed the seasoning of the succotash. Now for the best part...we were here for the cheesecake, but we only managed to share one slice between us both- the Dulce de Leche cheesecake. I highly recommend it-- not to sweet, not too heavy, and very fluffy and delectable. And for half off, it tasted that much better!"
Anthony A.,"New York, NY",0,6,,1.0,7/15/2015,"I went on a Saturday night, waited about 40 minutes for a table which wasn't bad but once seated the floor by my chair was all sticky and slippery.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla and hibachi steak.  The hibachi steak tasted like boneless spareribs someone would order at a Chinese take out restaurant.  The steak was smothered in some kind of sauce which was loaded with sugar and the steak was disgusting.  The waitress was rude, i left $20.00 on the table after charging the meal and she did not even ask if I wanted change, just took it upon herself to assume the whole $20.00 was meant for her.  Later in the night I started feeling sick and of course I had food poisoning. I was sick for 48 hours, stay away this place is disgusting."
Karen D.,"Sayreville, NJ",160,7,1,4.0,8/14/2015,"I meant to review my experience last week, but anyway last Wednesday (8/5) I stopped by this location to grab dinner with a friend, and there was a lot of miscommunication with what came with our order. I guess you can say we misunderstood the menu. Any who, we were both disappointed with our meals since we were expecting something else. BUT, thanks to Josh, I'm assuming the manger, came to the rescue! He explained to us what the typical order comes with and even mentioned he made the same assumption with the meal description, and understood our concern. He quickly grabbed both of our dinners to the back and flew back to us in 3 min with our orders fixed! He was super kind about it, and didn't waste time to argue, but rather explain so we'd understand for our next visit. I always have an amazing experience at this location! Even though I'm still upset I spent $17 on a Caesar salad, I'm a happy customer! Thank you Josh! :)"
Syed F.,"Edison, NJ",8,9,,3.0,7/7/2014,"Cheesecake Factory continues to draw outsize crowds.  It never makes sense.  They don't take reservations, wait times are often long, food is nothing to write home about and service is often just ok -- but we end up going there anyway. One answer to this puzzle is their very large menu.  Everyone can get something they like, from salads to pizza to seafood to steak.  When you have a family of people with eclectic tastes, this becomes the choice that no one really objects to and we end up going there. It is totally redundant to say the reason to go there is their cheesecakes.  They are excellent.  Except when you're trying to watch your calorie intake.  Go there for their cheesecake, compensate by having a lunch-sized salad and come back happy.  Better yet, share the cheesecake with someone you love!"
Karrin P.,"Montclair, NJ",299,318,74,4.0,8/16/2013,"Great location! We went there on a Friday night and expected the worst regarding the wait. They told us 40 minutes but took us after only a 20 minute wait! We were thrilled. The atmosphere is modern and clean and the wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. In other words, it's consistent with the chain brand. I particularly love that they have an extensive skinny menu that includes alcoholic beverages and food. I ordered the skinny  turkey burger and the skinny Sangria. Everything was absolutely delicious with the perfect portion size! Overall, a great success. I would definitely return."
Joseph L.,"Edison, NJ",2,42,35,3.0,4/12/2014,Was five stars and over the years the service level steadily decreased. Though the food tastes good with great portion sizes the service team need revitalization.
Nucky T.,"Java Village, NY",24,259,1,2.0,4/11/2011,"Interesting. In all the times I have been forced into the Cheesecake factor[ies] in the past all over the country, the food remains average to poor.  You can always guarantee 2 things from this place.  1. A long wait at any hour of the day [ why? ]  2. Sub par to piss poor food.  You can ALWAYS guarantee that from the C.F.  Why on god's green earth do people flock here like it's the last restaurant open? Why? There are 10,000 items on the menu. [ never, ever a good sign ]  Eat at the C.F if you live in a dump like Charlotte, NC, where you are punished if you are looking for a quality place to eat. Not, in NJ though, with all the delicious restaurants where you could eat. Save your money and drive 2 blocks north, south, east, or west, I am sure you will find something better."
Greg R.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",15,18,23,5.0,4/6/2014,My fist time there and the food was great! I had the four cheese pasta with chicken. Service was good and very friendly I would be going back very soon....
Cliff F.,"Bradenton, FL",0,15,7,3.0,4/6/2015,"After a disjointed start where the hostess and waitress didn't communicate well, we were finally seated after watching the wait staff scramble to clear and clean our table. The food arrived quickly. The salads were large and tasty.  An added bonus was that we there was no long wait for a table at lunch hour.   Consistent food."
Jessica M.,"Woodbridge, NJ",40,71,21,5.0,7/4/2013,"Good lunch specials and the portions are just as big as the dinner pretty much.  I know it's a chain restaurant, but this is really the best.  No matter what i've gotten, it's always good.  As a vegetarian, there are also a lot of vegetarian-friendly meal options which is always a plus.  I've had the portabella  burger, eggplant sandwich, and veggie burger just to name a things that I've tried."
Kate R.,"Lake Wylie, SC",32,93,27,4.0,2/8/2014,"I have always had great good at the Cheesecake Factory. A++ for consistency, for sure. My new fav is the SkinnyLicious chicken tacos... Not too filling, and under 600 cals. I'm not normally one to care about calories,  but the SkinnyLicious menu is where you will find the normal human size portions that items off the regular menu know nothing about.  Husband had the white bean chili... Also fantastic!"
Claire C.,"Edison, NJ",3,5,,4.0,3/30/2014,"EXCELLENT SERVICE! Came here for my fiancé's birthday & the service is the best I've ever had in a restaurant! As soon as we were done with a plate, we would put it to the edge of a table & a manager or any server would take it off your table. The food was great. A little pricey but the food is really good! Def recommend the buffalo blasts, crab cake bites & Dulce de Leche Cheesecake! Omg to die for. All in all, great service & will be coming here again soon."
Jai S.,"Mercer, NJ",27,131,35,1.0,5/6/2013,"Brunch here sucks... Something is seriously wrong with the breakfast/ lunch staff as a whole. But the manager ""Chris"" is cool. He had my bill taken care of."
Benson Y.,"New York, NY",370,1191,874,5.0,5/14/2009,"Some may consider it wrong to enjoy (heck, LOVE) a ""chain restaurant"", but screw it - Cheesecake Factory rules.  This particular one is located right next to Menlo Park Mall, and in fact you can go right from the mall into the restaurant, which is super convenient. The decor is the standard dark, wood and pastel deco you'll find across the chain.  The facilities are maintained really nicely and you always feel like you're in some place grand. And grand it is!  Everything about this restaurant screams excess.  Their serving sizes are made for armies to eat and they do not skimp on their cheesecake slices!  My favorite dishes are their eggroll appetizer and the Thai Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp.  I never thought a place like this could pull off good curry, but they do that in spades.  It's spicy and sweet at the same time and the chunks of chicken and shrimp they give you are meaty and huge. Be warned that this place is very popular, so you'll wind up waiting a bit if you go at a peak time.  Good thing is that there's a nice bar/waiting area where you can chill with a drink while waiting.  The waitstaff is always courteous and often engage you in friendly conversation in addition to serving you."
Arrol X.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,6,1,3.0,6/5/2014,"The food is ok.... Nothing special, too many things on the menu, didn't know wit to order, lots of ppl, the cheese cake was ok, little sweet, very creamy, I think I won't go back again, but good for experience"
Jen M.,"Kearny, NJ",47,20,18,4.0,2/5/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants! Although the wait sometimes can be a little too long, it is worth the wait! There cheesecakes are always fresh, but the portion sizes have become smaller! Food and drinks are great aswell!"
Maria V.,"Dongan Hills, Staten Island, NY",1,9,4,4.0,3/12/2014,Love the Cheesecake Factory because this is the place my fiancé propose 1 year ago not the same exact location bt same chain so I came here for my birthday dinner craving my favorite plate chicken Marsala and this night they ran out of it like really uhhh this never happen to me so i ended up up gettin the chicken Madeira and it was good too bt because they did not have my favorite meal the day of my birthday I give them a less rating over all it was great though the drinks kick in got me feeling all tipsy
Scott Y.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",359,471,270,4.0,4/17/2011,"I came here after going to sign my new lease in New Jersey.  The thing that really got my attention was the service.  It's hard enough to find the hallmarks of good service in restaurants in which the owner is present, but it's virtually impossible to find it in a chain restaurant.  This Cheesecake Factory location seems to be the rare exception to that rule.  I was first struck by the fact that our host took a piece of silverware from our table as he sat us.  Chain restaurants tend to be so focused on upselling and gimmicky themes that they rarely teach their employees simple things like checking the silverware for spots before seating people.  Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about the food; and made sure that our water glasses never went below half full. I had tortilla soup, which was different, but very good.  I also had a Thai peanut pasta, which I really liked. At the end of the day, it's a Cheesecake Factory.  So you know whether or not you're going to like to food if you've ever been to one before, but what puts it in a category with the better locations of chain restaurants is that this location has very well trained servers."
