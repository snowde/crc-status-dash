Rebecca A.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,71,8,4.0,2/20/2015,"As far as chain restaurants go, this one is better than most.   However, reservations are almost always necessary, unless you want to wait.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Husband got a Shepards pie, which he liked, but was more like a beef stew with a circle of mashed potatoes on top.  I got a chicken dish (breaded cutlets with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus).  They were a little skimpy with the asparagus.  But otherwise the meal was good and well flavored . Friends got a chicken/pasta dish, which they liked.  Overall, portions are big enough for two meals.   Cheesecakes were all good.   Dinner for four (including 2 beers, two glasses of wine, and a glass of sangria was over $200 with tip).  A bit pricey for a chain, but at least the portions are big."
Frank S.,"Staten Island, NY",0,4,,5.0,5/9/2015,"Good service, excellent entrees and the cheesecake is simply to die for! Worth the trip from Staten Island!"
Rich B.,"Staten Island, NY",43,228,63,2.0,8/9/2013,In a nutshell even bad cheese cake is still pretty good service is ok food is mehh....I had the spicy chicken and walnut dish and it was the worst thing i have even eaten. Asked server to take it back they did without a problem. Took it off bill offered to compsomething else i declined.
Giovanna A.,"Staten Island, NY",130,511,211,3.0,10/14/2013,"We were luckily seated within a reasonable time for a weekend. We ordered the avocado rolls, buffalo blasts, chili and sweet potato fries. The avocado rolls were good, but a little too much cilantro. The buffalo blasts were salty! I was only able to eat two pieces because it was too much. My fiance` liked the chili and we loved the sweet potato fries. Our waiter even brought us out more because he thought we weren't given enough. We explained we had eaten some before he came over, but did not believe us and brought the fries over anyway. Our drinks kept getting refilled and our waiter was pleasant."
tom p.,"Staten Island, NY",58,40,,3.0,8/15/2012,"Food is good.  A bit pricey, very clean and overcrowded.  45 min wait. phooey! Dont think I would go again.   It a great place but not that great."
Rich L.,"Fairfield, CT",0,62,,1.0,10/9/2012,"Waitress was slow, rude, and had an attitude. Ordered the fried mac n cheese balls and potstickers for an appetizer, the potstickers came out cold and had to be remade. When my main dish came out (orange crusted chicken) the chicken was extremely hard and dried out and missing the extra sauce I asked for.  I hate going here and only went because someone got me a gift card, I hate chain restaurants and I've had a negative experience both times I've been to this location. Won't go back."
Jenny S.,"Cambridge, MA",21,78,1,4.0,12/18/2010,"to be honest, i am an Asian food fan.... However, Cheesecake factory is one of the few western restaurants i will go to.  When there is something to celebrate, i will go there to have some romance and taste the delicious cheesecake.  i cannot wait for the dessert to come, so i try to finish my entree as quickly as possible. like a little kid, isn't it?"
David M.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",2,16,6,2.0,1/1/2014,"Good at best. Have been back numerous times and food is continuously mediocre. It seems to me that most people that rave about this place hold a sincere liking for Applebees, tgi Friday's and the like. I wouldn't avoid it but definitely not a choice destination"
Sanna P.,"Fords, NJ",0,3,,1.0,3/3/2015,Worst customer service ever. Poorly run establishment. Mangers have no idea what they are doing and run around panicked everytime there are more than 2 people waiting.
Jason C.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",79,488,10,3.0,8/3/2009,"First of all - CALL AHEAD FOR A RESERVATION. There is ALWAYS a long wait. 30 minutes at least, and regularly well above 1 hour. Parking can take a while. Sometimes they offer valet. Food - generally I find their food tasty. Pasta dishes come in big servings, others are average to above average. I think the items are on the expensive side. Pasta dishes in the mid to high teens (and usually come with some form of protein) and protein centric dishes reaching up to the high 20s. They do have some cheaper options in the low teens, and some of their burgers start below 10$. I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here.  The cheesecakes - are expensive. About 7$ a slice. They're big and heavy enough to split with someone else, but you might not want to. They have so many different varieties that you will want to try more than one.  Specifics: Carrot Cake - very good. The carrot cake and the cheesecake is swirled together. It's very most with the right kind of carrot cake spice going on. Special Edition Red Velvet Cheesecake - layer of cake/cheesecake alternating. Cream Cheese frosting. Very good if you like red velvet cake, nothing special if you don't care. Avoid - appetizer - buffalo blasts. They kept falling apart and it felt like you didn't get much chicken under all that fried stuff. Just go with their regular boneless buffalo chicken. dessert - godiva brownie sundae - the ""brownies"" are super dense, cold, and not very sweet or tasty at all (this is from someone who likes his chocolate on the dark and bittersweet end of the spectrum). Atmosphere - this is one thing that consistently annoys me. It looks nice enough with it's high ceilings and dark wood decor. I have never been when it was not very noisy and crowded + some of the booths have very wide tables making it hard to have a conversation. Finally, the thing that makes no fucking sense whatsoever, is that at night they turn the lights WAY down. It's difficult to see your food, let alone the people across the table from you."
Kedar K.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",2,27,7,4.0,3/29/2013,Just order appetizers and dessert :) .. Appetizers are yummy and plentiful and cheese cakes are to die for.. so by all means skip the main course..!!
George M.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,178,17,4.0,9/4/2011,Remember the scene in Richy Rich where he had a McDonalds in his Mansion?  If that movie was remade today he would have a Cheescake Factory in it! The dishes are fantastic with pretty good size portions and the atmosphere is great!  I love the large ceilings.  Whenever I go their I feel like I'm in a castle. My review looses a star because of the bar.  It's really small and their isn't a lot of wiggle room to socalize and hang out.   Other then that it's Aces!
Joe M.,"Newark, NJ",24,52,4,5.0,1/10/2013,I mostly come here for the lunch and happy hour since its alot cheaper and the portions are still large. My fav is the chicken romano or the mediterrean chicken tacos with a passion fruit ice tea
Jillian R.,"Staten Island, NY",7,63,3,4.0,6/10/2013,"The food was typical of any chain, it was good but not great...however the cheesecake was amazing. I had the 30th anniversary Chocolate cake cheesecake and I have no words on how yum it was."
Helena B.,"Westfield, NJ",0,11,,2.0,4/3/2014,"First time at this location.  Tables are wayyy too close to each other, kinda loud because it was busy, and too dark.  Ordered an avocado turkey sandwich - they didn't have it. Went for a veggy burger - it was disgusting!  By god replace brown rice with chickpeas!  Also never got our bread or water while other tables were getting them ... Drinks had nil alcohol in them.  Not going back if you pay me."
Helen L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",8,30,46,2.0,5/24/2013,"Alright this place may have a big selection of cheesecake which I could see being the mecca for cheesecake lovers but considering other things this place is not that great.  My friend and I came here to have a late lunch thinking that the food was going to be amazing...now that I think about it I don't really know why we has such great expectations. Anyway, to start off they had very few vegetarian options besides the typical veggie burger which vegetarians get tired of real quick. I opted for the huevos rancheros and asked if there was any meat involved even though the menu didn't mention meat in the entree. The waiter did come back and informed me that the black bean were prepared with chicken broth. The black beans were a big part the entree but I still ordered it without the bean because there was nothing else on the menu that appeared to be appetizing without being overpriced. I was not paying $18 for a salad!  It may have been because I had no bean on my eggs but my meal was only OK. The salsa was pretty bland. Before we got our food the waiter did inform us that it taking a while because they overcooked my eggs...at this point I knew what I was going to get wasn't going to be great.  My friend ordered some salad off their low calorie menu and asked for salmon as the protein. She nothing to rave about her food. It was nice to look at though... The slices of cheesecake were huge so we decided to split a dulce de leche. That was pretty good and satisfying.  I have to say that our first waiter was a sweetheart! But we didn't even have him for our entire time there because he got switched into the dinner service. This place may be good to come just for the variety of cheesecakes but for me it's just not worth the trip. As far as the food goes, save your money and just stick to the cheesecake."
Kristine M.,"Fords, NJ",18,38,152,4.0,2/4/2011,"I would give this location 5 stars just for the Customer Service we experienced today, however, there are items on the menu that could be improved. We arrived at the restaurant at 4pm on a Friday and there was no wait. The server Brittany was excellent. She had a very pleasant demeanor and since we ordered a drink we've never had she offered a replacement if we weren't satisfied with it. She came over and apologized when the complimentary bread was delayed being served and checked on us frequently enough that it was appropriate and wasn't intrusive.  Menu choices range from American, Southwestern, European to Asian inspired fare. There are numerous choices on the appetizer list and entree section that it may be a chore for someone with simple and less adventurous tastes. My suggestion for an appetizer is the Tamale Cakes topped with avocado and salsa verde.  The artichoke dip was tasty, but could be creamier and the chips could be softer. The Avocado Chicken Club is my favorite sandwich with buttered and toasted sourdough bread, grilled chicken, melted Swiss cheese, avocado & BLT. It's my go-to choice if I don't have the patience to be disappointed with a ""new to me"" dish. The sandwich halves are large enough that you have to open your mouth like a snake unhinging its jaw and as an improvement the chicken slices could be thinner. The Passion fruit iced tea could be sweetened since it is a bit bland.  The restaurant also offers a new combo Red Velvet Cake topped with Cheesecake which is tasty. However it could be improved if it did not just have white chocolate shavings and instead topped with icing similar to that of a traditional red velvet cake.  As with any restaurant there is always something that could be improved depending on individual tastes, but at the Cheesecake Factory there are enough choices to satisfy the pickiest eater."
Dieter V.,"Solon, OH",65,247,76,4.0,7/13/2013,Another solid link in the chain. High quality food and selection. The service is prompt and professional. Parking can be difficult because of the Menlo Park Mall.
Chaicharn S.,"Tampa, FL",81,154,659,4.0,7/13/2011,"I haven't tried Cheesecake Factory in a few years and was a bit surprised when told a business dinner was arranged there. I recalled with some trepidation from previous experience that the wait time could be quite lengthy. But, with reservations and the fact that this Southern boy got a bit confused on Northern road design, our party was already seated by the time we arrived.  The portions for the Cajun Shrimp Jambalaya Pasta were gastronomically hearty, even the side salad could've been consumed as an entree dish. Nonetheless, trudging through the meal, the consumption left us fully sated. Thank goodness the hotel was only a few miles from this location. Overall, it was a pleasant and friendly atmosphere. Very family-oriented and catered to our large party (15+) without noticeable waitstaff interruption."
Aaron P.,"Edison, NJ",47,41,34,4.0,8/21/2011,"Pretty much good food all around. It is very loud though and there is almost always a pretty long wait at peak times. Portions are large, better to share one entree and then enjoy a cheesecake at the end."
