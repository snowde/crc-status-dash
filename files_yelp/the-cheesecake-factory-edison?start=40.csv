Lauren G.,"Princeton, NJ",0,48,1,4.0,12/8/2017,Came here on Sunday for dinner. Got the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer based upon a friends recommendation. I never had anything like this before but it was so good! The house red wine was excellent. I got a delicious salad to try and balance the cheesecake that I of course ordered. Exceptional experience and will come back!
Chelsey S.,"Carteret, NJ",110,20,3,4.0,11/25/2017,"The food is good/ok, not as many good options as you'd think since the menu is long, but the desserts are amazing!! the drinks are also delicious! This is a place I would suggest going out at night for drinks and desserts. I had the Strawberry Shortcake yesterday for the first time and I fell in love. IT WAS HUGE and really phenomenal. best dessert I've ever had!! i took it home because i couldn't finish it. I was surprised that after refrigerating it and 24 hours later it's just as good as when i got it fresh."
Lola L.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",49,33,157,5.0,1/13/2017,"I love this place!!! I usually get the same old because it taste amazing. Jamaican blk pepper shrimp ...you can get it all shrimp or half shrimp half chicken, i get all shrimp. It is a very hot plate, it comes with a side of mango sauce to cool your taste buds. My bf loves their buffalo chicken blasts its an appetizer but he gets it as a entree and pairs it with mash potatoes, another very good choice."
Karema A.,"South Plainfield, NJ",25,95,277,4.0,3/17/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory...and that's not a bad thing! If you come here for dinner on the weekend, expect to wait. They do not take reservations.  After many visits to this location, I only had one bad experience with the food. I ordered a pasta dish which was incredibly salty. The waiter and manager both came up to me to profusely apologize and told me they looked into the issue (apparently they went back into the kitchen to see if the water used to boil the pasta was too salty or if some other mistake had been made). They suggested another dish for me which turned out great. I couldn't have been more pleased with their customer service.  And you can never go wrong with their Cheesecake for dessert.  Very ample parking as this restaurant is connected to the mall. That's right...I said it's next to the mall. You can go get yourself a cute outfit, go take some selfies with your friends outside, and have a nice dinner and some cocktails with your girls. Yes gawd!"
Jeffrey C.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",51,11,20,5.0,9/13/2017,"Despite it being a chain restaurant I actually genuinely enjoyed the food, the service, and overall experience.  I went with my family of four for a Sunday afternoon lunch and, as per usual, there was a line, but I've come to expect that of a busy restaurant. It wasn't a long wait, we got seated after 25 minutes and we got a very courteous waiter who patiently took our orders and answered our questions. We got the buffalo blasters (pleasantly surprised me)  and fried mac and cheese for appetizers, and I myself got the chicken Madeira for my main course. All of which were spectacular and of course very cheesey (always a plus). I do remember my dad getting the hibachi steak and I tried this- also delicious, sweet and tender. My side from what I remember was mashed potatoes and it had a nice texture. We finished off with a slice of caramel white chocolate macademia nut cheesecake ($8 bit pricey but...) delicious! No complaints! The bill came to around $150 for the 4 of us but if you're looking to impress a loved one or have an elegant evening you don't have to look far."
Allison C.,"Glen Allen, VA",87,285,302,3.0,8/22/2016,"Where do I begin? I was going to be in the area with my family and planned a brunch about 3 weeks out.  I called into Cheesecake Factory to see if I would be able to host a bruncheon there.  I was told it would be fine because I was planning to come in right at 10am (when they open).  I called back the day before to confirm.... I was told there was no reservation under my name at all that morning. The person I was speaking with asked me who I made the reservation with.  Luckily, I had written down that information.  Surprisingly enough... the person who took my reservation was the person I was currently speaking with on the phone!!! I was told they switched the books and may not have effectively transferred existing reservations.   Nonetheless, we arrived and were seated about 10 minutes later.  It took us awhile to get our food which is expected with a large party. Our waiter was switched out which actually may have been a good thing.  Our first waiter was asking if we wanted the potatoes and toast with our breakfast combo (ONLY comes with pancakes, eggs, bacon).  Weird  I'm not sure he actually knew the menu (Who can blame him?  It's like 40 pages!!)  A few of the meals were mixed up but the food was good and overall, my family enjoyed their brunch. Word to the wise:  Double check your reservations if planning more than a few days out!"
Nadine B.,"Bensalem, PA",101,248,140,2.0,6/16/2017,"Cheesecake factory is a chain, and we already know what to expect in terms of food so this review is based on the service. We came on a Friday afternoon for lunch. While there were a decent amount of people dinning, it was nothing crazy. Our waiter did not show up until 10 mins after we were seated. He was very slow with cleaning up our table as well. Our entrees came out and we still had our appetizer plates on the table. My sister and I just started placing all the plates on the table next to ours...which was also not cleared off from the people that had finished dinning and left."
Terrance B.,"Somerset, NJ",0,2,,1.0,12/26/2017,The worse experience I ever had at a restaurant I would give zero stars if possible. They put me in a corner seat I guess to try and accommodate for the holiday time. But at least allow me elbow space. Then I ordered what I felt wasn't that complex of a burger and steak tacos. Took well over a hour to get the food as others around us got their food. Just for the manager to come over and offer to re cook my cold food that would of taken longer. I fuck with cheese cake factory just not this one every again. Straight TRASH!!! Waiter kept vanishing for what I think was on purpose. Good luck at this place.
Da Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,32,51,4.0,3/11/2017,"Thai Lemon chicken, Bacon cheese bread thingies and cheeseburger sliders Great stuff, this place caters to all ages and has neutral but great mix if foods and desserts.  They are getting better by the year."
Vinny U.,"Staten Island, NY",178,172,1353,4.0,5/7/2016,"Decided to come here instead of a non chain restaurant 1-because those were all booked because of mothers day weekend and 2- because we figured it was alot more kid friendly since it is a chain lol We sat outside because it was alot shorter of a wait and plus they had heating lamps at every table which worked really well to keep us warm  The menu is Ginormous with ALOOOTTTT of options from apps to desserts and everything in between , drink menu is also full of great creative options .  Food was very good and considering the portion size the prices a very fair too . Service was nice and prompt considering how busy they were and the waiter was very patient and helpful  I would definitely come back , the wife , my mom, the kids and i all enjoyed our meals and were stuffed ."
Vincent P.,"Edison, NJ",9,29,28,1.0,5/27/2017,"Umm thanks @Cheesecake Factory but I shouldn't have to go out of MY way to explain to you what happened. You can clearly read my experience here. I don't want anything free, nor do I want a manager contacting me weeks later at this point.. I think people should know what a very fair critic has experienced in your establishment. That's enough explanation isn't it?"
Nick P.,"Linden, NJ",4,11,,2.0,6/18/2017,"- Father's Day - I have it a second star only because it was busy.  I ordered their version of the French dip.  The meal landed in front of me and I was perplexed.  Two halves with a beef slab attached to both.  I needed a steak knife to cut it off.   Meat was dangling off the sides. And the bottom piece of bread on one of the halves was sideways.  Huh.  It fell apart after dipping it i the au jeus.  Chewing for a while to get the first bite down.   Tough meat.  Terrible presentation.  While eating I heard a manager scream at a cook with, ""You're done!"""
Mark M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",214,58,28,5.0,11/20/2016,I come here for the cheesecakes and I'm never disappointed. It's amazingly shocking how many different varieties of cheesecakes that they have. If you love cheesecake then this is a solid choice.
Katie D.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",0,8,1,5.0,7/28/2017,This Cheesecake Factory is by far the best in the area. Excellent! Fast and mindful service. The experience is consistent. I eat here once a week. Their food at this particular location is SCRUMPTIOUS.
Elle S.,"Kew Gardens, NY",3,20,1,2.0,12/14/2017,"The ambience is good .. Greek or Romanian temple .. Spacious ..Colorful bar ..the cheese cakes looked pretty and chocolaty how I like it .. The service ok .. But the food was a disappointment , my high expectations unfortunately fell to the ground . Nothing special here my kale quinoa salad was less then average in presentation , creativity and taste. It was supposed to have grape and red pepper I saw red dotsI guess the sweet red pepper may be sweet I don't know was literally cut in a dot size I had 3 halves of grapes ..!!!the rest was a lot of really weirdly cut kale some quinoa also barely there Parmesan cheese ..unattractive and dull .. My mom's shrimp were tasteless ..I will give it another chance as my daughter loved the cheeseburger and then that's it ..!! Today's conclusion: it is not a foodies place although it was packed; no idea why ..:0 Update : we just had the cheesecake we got for takeout  chocolate tuxedo tastes like any chocolate mousse you would get from quick check or something.."
Eric M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",135,134,107,1.0,10/15/2016,"Below was a comment from the Cheesecake Factory, I did contact them and they didn't bother to respond. They make themselves look good on yelp and do nothing to correct the situation.  Leo the manager should be fired, as well as his boss! They have no idea how to talk to customers and threatened me because myself and the party I was with was concerned that they wouldn't let my wife who is pregnant with twins sit down. The corporate office would be disgusted with the managements actions. Very sad, and I hope the general manager reads this and contacts me. There was more harassment that is to shocking to even mention on this post. Food wise everything was fine."
Nancy G.,"Pleasantville, NJ",11,3,,3.0,11/6/2017,"First time Ive been here... was not impressed.:( We went early like 4:15pm heard it can get quite busy with the mall people so anyway checked in needed table for 4. Told 15 min. Not bad. 25 minutes later called up, we went up to desk with about 12 other people waited there in that spot another 5 min. Until our server came up for us. They placed us in a very noisy bar table/booth music was way too loud. The menu has something for everyone maybe to much, we all found something to enjoy the food was good except my pasta that came with my chicken riesling so cold I didn't bother. I had no chance to ask the others at my table because quite frankly I couldn't hear them. We all decided to try the cheesecakes for dessert I had the carrot cake/cheese cake it was Awesome! My coffee was horrible.  So here's what I've learned... Go in to the the cheese cake factory make a b-line for the refrigerated counter it's right there as you go thru the doors..buy your cheesecake to GO make your own coffee you will thank me for that tip. I did want to mention the Server seemed rushed, but he was a good server."
Andrea Q.,"Clifton, NJ",138,89,258,4.0,4/9/2017,We had to come here because Fox and Hound was incredibly packed with no seating but we were happy because it wasn't as loud and we were able to sit at a table at the bar section right away. Our waitress came almost immediately so we didn't have to wait too long. The only thing that took a decent amount of time was actually getting our beers/riesling. Bread was hot and fresh!  My friend ordered the Chicken Riesling and I ordered the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic Shrimp which is supposedly 590 calories or less. Both dishes were paired with angel hair pasta. It tasted delicious. We both ate our food slowly so that we could savor it. Not sure if it's really 590 calories or less or not but it was still really good. And I was full off of half a serving to save the other half for lunch next the next day. Overall good experience coming here at the Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday night around 8:30 PM. It's nice that they list all of the calories for the menu items which makes it hard to decide which cheesecake is the best one to get since they are all 1000 calories and upwards lol! So i decided to get the banana cream cheesecake to go and spread out eating it over one week. Sooooo good and so happy I got that one! There is a cheesecake which is made with splenda and it is only 600 calories. But I think the funniest thing on the menu at Cheesecake is that you can get a bowl of strawberries for 250 calories for like $7. I guess if you just want strawberries you can get them here!
Jade S.,"Linden, NJ",10,5,2,1.0,5/26/2017,"My husband and I went here to have lunch to celebrate our wedding anniversary and when we were called to be seated at our booth we found that it was not clean so we had to awkwardly stand in the aisle hovering over other patrons and blocking servers from walking to and fro. We then decided to walk back up to the entrance so that we wouldn't block or disturb others and we asked to speak to the manager. When the manager arrives I explain my dissatisfaction and how I hoped this wasn't indicative of how the rest of our time would be at restaurant. He then says that he doesn't understand my question. I had to then explain that it wasn't a question, I was informing him of our disappointment and told him we were leaving. He then stated that he hoped our next experience would be better. There will be no next visit. We then went to Havana Central and had the best time! Way better atmosphere and the service and food were great!"
Jamila C.,"Somerville, NJ",151,217,981,3.0,10/3/2016,"I really want to give less stars, but I would be lying if I didn't say I don't enjoy the food. So many years after their grand opening, and there is still a ridiculously long wait on the weekends especially. Just so many people standing around in their lobby, and I couldn't believe I was one of them. Finally getting a seat was a bit of a challenge, but the drinks and food were good, except for the cheesecake. I did not enjoy their extremely soft lemon meringue cheesecake. Matter of fact, it was disgusting. I was expecting something close to the taste of a lemon meringue pie, but I got something wrong instead, and those small pieces of inedible lemon zest (I'm guessing that's what it was) that is topped on the whip cream is also in the cheesecake.  The chicken madeira was very good, as usual. And the Passion Fruit Margarita was delicious, also.  Ladies, be careful, if you are wearing heels. The floors are so slippery."
