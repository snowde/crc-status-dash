Warren N.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",6,25,,1.0,4/4/2011,"This place is always swamped, and there are always people everywhere between their door and the Barnes an Noble next door.  Food is average, totally unmemorable American flare. I've tried various menu items, and none of them have ever blown me away, and as a rule I avoid this place because for some reason, people love waiting for average. Comically, even the Cheese Cake hit me as being ordinary, ever I dare say bad. They have oodles of varieties but for some reason they all taste the same to me, like eating a brick of cream cheese with about the same flavor. I'd have given the restaurant two stars, but the location and people overflow drags it down to one for me..."
Dhara S.,"Cliffwood, NJ",2,10,,4.0,3/8/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory was in a great location; within Menlo Park Mall. The food was reasonable for its price. We ordered the nachos and the Eggplant sandwich, both of which were delicious. For dessert we tried some of the Godiva Cheesecake; normally I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but the Godiva  cheesecake was the best cheesecake I've ever had; it had a triple layer of chocolate.  There were several vegetarian options and you could also get the non vegetarian options but without the meat; unlike other restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory is very accommodating. The service was decent, but that could have been because it was busy. The mood and environment of the restaurant was cozy and comfortable. It's a great place for dates or for larger parties as well!"
Ki J.,"Newark, NJ",0,13,,3.0,3/7/2015,Happy hour drinks and appetizers are great!  The desserts get smaller and smaller bit the price stays the same. That is disappointing because that's why I go.
Shoma P.,"Atlanta, GA",9,37,,5.0,10/20/2013,I love this place!! I usually don't mind the wait as my anticipation is already making my mouth water just thinking about the wonderful food that will be in my tummy in a very short period of time. I have to warn most of you that on any weeknight and especially weekend expect to wait at least an hour or more without a doubt. Now onto the food.. I always get their stuffed mushrooms and vietnamese basil rolls for my appetizers and Cajun Jambalaya pasta for my main and I have to say I have yet to be disappointed!! Their cheesecakes are to die for although I cannot remember which ones I had =/Their alcoholic drinks are a little on the pricey side but hey the food is a tradeoff for that! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
Zenas A.,"Manhattan, NY",168,140,5,3.0,5/6/2013,This is an A-OK restaurant in a nice convenient location. You can eat and then burn all of the calories off by walking around Menlo Mall
Samantha S.,"Clark, NJ",501,462,,5.0,9/11/2010,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a lot because it's 10 minutes from my house, but the last time was really exceptional.  I went with my family on a Sunday around 4 - the six of us were seated right away.  Our waiter was wonderful - really excellent service.  The two different kinds of bread they give you are yummy.  We ordered edamame to start with - it was pretty good.  I had the Tomato, Basil and Cheese pizza for my meal - it was presented well and was really delicious - I brought half home with me for dinner the next day.  I had the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake for dessert - it was great and huge! I've also had the Fried Mac and Cheese - that's really good...and I also like the Carrot Cake Cheesecake.  My dad and brother swear by the Shrimp and Bacon club sandwich."
Xaria C.,"Newark, NJ",3,10,52,5.0,7/30/2013,Just stopped by because I was in the neighbor but found out it was half-price on cheese cake Tuesday.  Did I luck out!!!!!!  Love the Oreo and Vanilla Bean Cheese Cake.  What a way to end the evening.
L M.,"New Brunswick, NJ",5,23,,3.0,2/24/2014,"Went in on a Sunday around 3, didn't expect it to be so packed. Had a 10 minute wait, sat very close to two other tables. Waitress was really nice, prompt and calm. The steak with the mushrooms is really heavy on the mushrooms and not on the steak, and the boyfriend's steak and shrimp combination had a grand total of 3 shrimp on it. We took some cheesecake to go, which was clearly great. The food was just ok though. Service was great. Probably won't be back except for cheesecake."
V V.,"Edison, NJ",1,38,,4.0,1/15/2014,"Having been here quite a few times, I will say this place is very good overall.  Pros: + The ambiance is always nice and fresh, giving an upscale yet approachable vibe to it.  + Love the ceiling decor and comfortable seating + Very diverse menu, including options for those who are watching their weight. For the health conscious I recommend the flatbreads (yum!), for the more free-going/cheat nighters their pastas and sandwiches are awesome.  + Cheesecake. Lots of different kinds of cheesecake in lots of different flavors. Need I say more? + Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. Deserves it's own spot and own post lol. It's THAT good and highly recommended for Cheesecake Factory noobs ordering dessert for their first time. Very delicious.  + Service has always been quality when I've come. Attentive, friendly, even the hosts are great.  + Clean bathrooms Cons: - Always a wait to get in, especially during holidays, nights and weekends. Be prepared to wait at least 20-45 minutes for a table - Some of the seating is crowded. You may wind up sitting right next to another family if its particularly packed - You will gain weight coming here. Cheesecake Factory is generally focused on upscale comfort food. Not a place for dieters unless you order specifically from the light menu - Pricey. Yeah."
Mango J.,"Manhattan, NY",866,230,164,1.0,4/9/2012,"Worst service ever,, the only high point was when the manager came over and I snitched,because our waiter jerk of a waiter flubbed the table adjacent to us' dining experience so the manager had already been  called on him. The manager accidently came over to ask us about dirty silverware , but our issue was the not being given appetizers we asked for and were left starving empty table - not even bread  for 45 minutes .. not the silverware (they gave the other table dirty utensils and then didnt come back) but obviously that waiter was serving so many tables insuffieciently and leaving us all hanging. I saw him zip past me several times to take birthday photos for some one, serve others  and people had such a hard time getting his attention. When he finally came he told me that he hoped the service didnt affect his tip and that it was the kitchen's fault. At that moment it became apparent to me he must have cheesecake for brains.. DONT ASK ME FOR A TIP.. BITCH!!! I understand its nice to tip and always do, but I thought it was extremely tacky to ask.It was also lame to throw his team/establishment under the bus.. he should have held it together in front of the customer  which was me. And gratuity is optional depending on service. and I always tip genrously anyway..But my waiter was such an iresponsible excuse making bull$@!^ artist and nah..  I wont go back..I dont like when the waiter forgets me then messed my food up, and then asks for a tip while im still eating.. I was really afraid to ask for anything else, because they messed up everything else so far, and he seemed unproffesional enough to tamper with my food.  fuck them! oh and the decor was really nice"
Marcus A.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,2,4.0,10/8/2013,"This is one of my favorite places to go on date night with my wife.  The food is good (big portions), the atmosphere is good, the prices are good and even when crowded the wait is not that long.  The longest I have ever waited on a Friday or Saturday in the summer time is about 35 minuets.  So don't don't get discouraged when they tell you 45 minuets or an hour, it usually isn't that long.  If I had to say anything bad about the experience is that the menu is too long. Sometimes too many choices is not good. Overall it is a good place for the whole family or just for the 2 of you... Happy eating."
Becky L.,"Staten Island, NY",343,38,14,4.0,7/29/2013,"Almost everytime i come, i have to make a mad dash past all the incoming customers to try to get to the hostess first. There is always a wait because there is so many people. The hostess was very friendly and smiley. She told us the wait would be at least 50 mins.  Our waitress was great and gave us excellent service. She was patient and quick. The warm bushman (brown) bread is delicious with butter. We were able to get a second basket of them!  For our appetizer, the buffalo wings were dry and did not taste good. I would not order them again.  There was 7 of us and we ordered 4 entrees. This was more than enough for us! I really enjoyed the ranch chicken salad. It includes a pile of chicken, diced tomatoes, sweet corn, ranch salad, black beans and topped with fried onions. Bang bang chicken and shrimp was a hit. It is a thai influenced dish with your choice of white or brown rice in the center surrounded by coconut curry sauce and chicken and shrimp. The 2 misses were the fettucine pasta with sundried tomatoes and fish tacos. The pasta tasted very bland and needed more sauce. The corn tortilla was stale but the tempura fish was ok.  Even though we were all stuffed we had to try there cheesecakes! We ordered an original slice. It was velvety and smooth. Pretty pricey at 7 bucks a slice.  Overall it is a good place to dine in when i want a fancy meal. I have been here twice and probably won't come back unless for a special occasion."
Justin E.,"Hoboken, NJ",73,119,154,4.0,12/7/2010,"The only time that I have been to the Cheesecake Factory was one night last year where my two friends and I were looking for a place to watch an NBA playoff game with alcohol and without a cover. We had first tried Fox and Hound, then Champs, but finally ended up at the CF... not the traditional factory experience I'd say. My first real time to try any of the food was this past Memorial Day. I'm never really sure about the crowds on holiday weekends, but I was happy to see that there was no wait to get seated at 2 in the afternoon for a late lunch.  I was enthralled to find a specially priced lunch menu that is available until 5pm. Cheesecake Factory is famous for it's LARGE portions which are proportionately priced. The lunch menu offers some of their most popular dishes for the fraction of the price, so instead of spending $20 or more per entree, you can spend an appropriate $10-15 for a lunch sized portion. ... I know what you're thinking. Lunch sized portion!? I am not a child! I want to eat! Trust me, I thought the very same thing. However, I decided to save a little here, and if I was still hungry, hit up the food court in the mall adjacent to the restaurant. However, their smaller portions are actually the size of a normal serving, so I found myself plenty satisfied at the end of the meal. HUZZAH! I ordered the chipotle pasta while my date had ordered their shepard's pie. Both dishes were of the quality that I had expected from the Cheesecake Factory, which was very good. All in all, I had a pleasant dining experience that left me too full to even try the cheesecake. I guess I'll have to save that for another time!"
Rob P.,"Verona, NJ",33,56,4,4.0,6/3/2012,Happy hour spring rolls with the sauces are a good pick for a fresh summer app
Jenean B.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",12,65,,3.0,8/3/2014,"While the food is good, the takeout process needs work. We ordered curbside to avoid the wait we knew would be long for dine in. We were told 25mins on the phone and arrived 35mins later just in case. All of the curbside parking spots were filled by cars/people that were not using the curbside amenity. I called inside to let them know we arrived and was forced to circle the parking lot several times until I saw a waiter in site with my order 15mins after I arrived. For anyone who lives in this area you know the melee in this parking lot since they are located in the mall. That being said...if you are going to advertise curbside service you need to enforce the signage telling people they will be towed if they park there and are not using it. Obviously you are not being taken seriously! When I brought it up to the server who delivered the food to the car he laughed and stuck his hand out to be paid. I did not find any humor in the experience and made that clear in his tip. Even though the food is above average the process is way to lengthy for takeout and dine in if you ask me. Now I remember why I haven't eaten here in a long time. And it will be a long time before I go back. 3 stars for failure in workflow and sarcasm from customer service."
Chunky M.,"Cranford, NJ",1,19,2,3.0,12/12/2013,The factory is a chain restaurant but at least they have friendly and personable staff. Stopped in at the Edison location after a day of Christmas shopping and was served by a friendly bartender.  He was knowledgable about the menu and let me know that the happy hour was going to start in 20 minutes. He put my order in so I would get the special rate.
Alexis A.,"Staten Island, NY",526,409,393,4.0,1/21/2013,"I'm obsessed with this place! My boyfriend doesn't get it but supports me ha ha! I love everything about it from the scenery from eating outdoors to indoors to the decor to the nice floors and how pleasant the staff is. I love there food its always fresh and always so good. I enjoy the red sangria and also the JP drink which is like a bubblegum flavor which is great. The bread is always fresh, soft and smells great too. I think I always get the roasted herb chicken with the vegetables but I have tried other things thanks to my boyfriend ordering different things. Its great and I enjoy coming here for lunch or dinner any day or time. And of course the best part is the CHEESECAKE!!! you must try them all and enjoy every bite with a nice cappuccino !"
Michael M.,"Neptune, NJ",20,49,9,4.0,5/11/2013,"I've never been to this Factory when there isn't a line of people waiting to get seated.  And rightly so, the food is delicious.  The menu is varied (a little too varied) and there's something to please every palate.  Service is uniformly good.  One suggestion: why not have a smaller half-portion of the famous cheesecake?  Or offer two smaller but different kinds on one plate.  Its so hard to decide!"
Cliff M.,"Hazlet, NJ",223,25,8,3.0,5/5/2013,The food was good but the employees have indifferent attitude.  The server was never around for drink refills.
Kathy M.,"Parlin, NJ",1,20,,5.0,11/14/2013,Went to the Cheesecake Factory with family and friends...true.. it was noisy in there and tight fitting.  I did the ambiance and the food.. but the cheesecakes we split were out of this world.
