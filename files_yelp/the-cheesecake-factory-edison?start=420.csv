Tom L.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",140,379,3,2.0,10/13/2012,"We were craving cheesecake, so decided to stop here on a Friday night. Extremely packed and a lot of people waiting, but the wait wasn't terrible (around 20 minutes). I was looking to order a couple drinks, but noticed there weren't any prices next to the drinks (one of my biggest restaurant peeves). I asked the waitress and the cheapest beer would be around 7 dollars, and the cocktails were even more. I decided to scrap that idea and just go for the food. The waitress very nice but was a bit absentminded (never brought us our bread until our food came, gave the wrong change for the bill), but she had been there for 12 hours and was obviously very tired so I don't blame her at all. I like how they give you both complimentary wheat and white bread. As for the actual food, my nachos were very cold, where the cheese was past the melty consistency and was just solid chunks. There was very little topping so most the chips just ended up uneaten. I tried the fried mac and cheese which was okay. The cheesecake choices, just like the menu choices, had plenty of variety and ours (chocolate tuxedo?) was a pretty solid choice. For two appetizers and a slice of cheesecake, it came out to $30 plus tip. Not the cheapest chain place and in my opinion, not worth it."
Dan B.,"Manhattan, NY",582,475,309,4.0,11/5/2012,I like The Cheescake Factory concept and their menu.  I normally eat here when I shop at Menlo Park Mall.  I recommend this for anyone who wants to grab a quick bite after shopping around.
First L.,"Edison, NJ",0,35,20,4.0,9/5/2013,"Ah, the abuse of us! Tasty food and LOTS of it. It's a chain that makes you forget it's a chain. Huge menu, so everyone can find something they love. And boy do they push that cheesecake! (High margin!?) Been there few times (this location and others) and haven't been disappointed by food. Service is meh everywhere, it seems."
Kristina B.,"Trenton, NJ",4,55,2,5.0,5/21/2012,"This is pretty much the only chain restaurant i LOVE!!!I would recoment the thai lettuce wraps,buffalo blasts,spicy ahi tempura roll,chicken madiera,bang bang chicken and shrimp,mini pizzette with pear blue cheese arugala,luau salad,chicken samosas,carmel chicken,vietnamese shrimp summer rolls,avacado eggrolls.I could go on and on.I have had burgers from here but a burger is pretty much a burger.I like that they have food that is different.Everything is so fresh tasting.I can`t wait till they open the one in quakerbridge mall this fall."
Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1309,1836,312,1.0,6/7/2007,"Why oh why do I continue coming back to this establishment??  For whatever reason, I decided I wanted cheesecake, and the factory was down the street from my cousin's house.  Seven people got cheesecake to go, and it was $60.  DAMN!!  It's like they're holding the cheesecake hostage and you have to pay this high ransom to set it free.  We could have bought four cheesecake factory cheesecakes from Costco for the same price.   It was a sad, sad day.  And no one finished their dessert.  Boo! The service at this location sucks the biggest butt hole I have ever seen!  We ordered our selections, and literally two minutes later, my cousin's friends says to the counter person: ""hey, is it too late to change my order?"" hostile counter person: ""yes"" cousin's friend (misunderstanding him): ""I'd like to get the tres leches instead"" a-hole counter person: ""I said yes, it's too late."" friend: ""oh, so you can't change it?"" barely disguised demon: ""no.  I can't.  I'd have to call a manager to override the order."" friend: ""oh, okay."" WTF?!??!  No you can't?  But you'd have to call the manager??  Then you can, you piece of crap.  All of us were too surprised by his surly and dismissive attitude to actually response with anything intelligent or helpful.   When we got back to the house and recapped the situation to everyone, another one of their friends got all mad.  He didn't hear the exchange and wanted to go back to kick the a-hole's a-hole.  But we didn't.  Too bad."
Felicia K.,"West New York, NJ",73,346,17,4.0,10/16/2010,"The ridiculous wait that you will frequently find at locations in this chain almost makes me downgrade their rating to a 3, but I guess this last time I went the experience was otherwise quite good.   Yes, we had to wait for about 45 minutes.  But their quote of 45 minutes ended up being exactly correct, so our going over to the next-door Barnes and Noble for a half hour was not a problem.  Yes, the tables are not spacious and you will feel a bit crammed, but the seats are comfortable.  The menu is enormous, which is one of the things I like about this place.  Almost anyone, from the most non-adventurous to the most easily-bored, will be able to find something they like here.  Lots of Mexican, Southeast/East Asian, and Italian.   We split the fried tuna sushi roll appetizer, which was incredibly delicious.  My main course was off the special menu insert - crispy chicken in a sweet caramel sauce with white rice and veggies.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste (although it did say ""sweet"" on the menu), and the white rice a bit unexciting, but the chicken was crispy and the veggies (green beans, slivers of peppers, onions, and carrots) tasty and not overcooked.  It was kind of like idealized Chinese food... what you wish you could get from the take-out place, but you always end up with something resembling that yet vaguely nauseating and a bit gross.  My boyfriend enjoyed his fish.  Some of my favorites in the past have been Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (a good one for vegetarians with an interesting variety of flavors and textures) and the avocado spring rolls appetizer. The service was excellent... our waiter was courteous and attentive without being overbearing.  We never had to look or wait for him.  He seemed to be doing his job pretty damned well. Didn't go for the cheesecake, but I've had it many times before.  It's good of course.  They had seasonal flavors of pumpkin and pumpkin pecan. I think that one of the highlights of this place are the appetizers.  I've gone a few times in the past and done it tapas-style, and left quite happy.  Good way to go if you want to get cheesecake, as you won't end up quite as stuffed. Yes, it's pricier than a Fridays or Chilis, but there's a reason for that.  The quality of the food and service is significantly higher."
Raquel G.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/21/2015,"If your child has any severe allergies to nuts, BEWARE!!!! I witnessed some of the employees at this location touching cheese cakes to give customers with their bare hands with no hand washing in between. Being a mother with a child who has a severe food allergy, I was appalled. Also,  the fact that they may be spreading their germs during the current flu season-disgusting!!! I watched one employee while on line waiting for my 'to go' order for a good 10 minutes- not once did she wash her hands or put on gloves. My conscience would not let me leave that place without notifying the manager. What a disgrace this manager, Andrea, was. This was not your typical ""my food came out cold"" complaint, this was a ""you're violating code"" complaint. No apologetic tone from her, just that she told the worker to put gloves on. I asked for the district manager's number given her unenthusiastic response. Called the DM, Raymond Day, 3 days ago and still waiting for a response. Guess there are defects all around with this company's management. Because of the laziness of some of their workers or perhaps poor management in not making sure their employees follow code, they are setting themselves up for a big liability. Warning to Cheesecake Factory: Not sure if you read the news, but kids DIE from anaphylactic reactions EVERY DAY, mainly from throat swelling from nut allergies!!!! The fact that your employees may be transferring nut proteins to other cheesecakes that people order when they think it doesn't contain nuts is a HUGE liability. Beware!!!"
Rye M.,"Franklin Park, NJ",1,9,,4.0,5/22/2010,"Cheesecake factory is a great place to eat, but you need to take your time. The menu is like reading a Bible; if you come wanting asian, there's asian; if you want BBQ, there is BBQ, etc. You will certainly find something to appease you. The prices are fair too. You'll pay upwards of $12 dollars for a plate, but the portions are very hefty. You will certainly not feel cheated on. When I went, I ordered a pulled-pork sandwich and my better half ordered a Hibachi Steak. The pork sandwich came with BBQ sauce on the side and LOADS of fries, enough to take back home. The sandwich was flavorful and moist. Very tasty. The Hibachi Steak was very tasty too. It came served with a baked potato side. Drinks are a little pricey at Cheesecake Factory, but not much more than average. I asked for a Ginger Ale and it was almost $4 for it. I was somewhat surprised. However, the food, service and friendliness of the staff is not to be surpassed. My only qualm is the long lines. On weeknights expect a wait of less than 20 minutes. However, if you plan on going on a weekend, expect to wait at least a 1/2 hour or more. Call ahead and make a reservation. You'll thank yourself if you do so."
Peter S.,"Colonia, NJ",22,59,48,4.0,9/23/2013,"We walk in to The Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday evening with nine people in our party and were seated within 10 mins, I was impressed with that to start. There was a slight mix up on where they seated us apparently the server in that section had gone home, but one of the servers stepped up to the plate and said she would take care of us I was impressed once again all of this took maybe 20-25 min all together so no big deal. I order the Boston house salad and it was out of this world and I finish the whole thing and the portions are huge after that I had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which was recommended by our server (she was awesome) it was a great call too cause I loved it and my brother had the same thing and he said it was outstanding also.Out of the nine people in our party including three children not one complaint was heard overall I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory to family and friends"
Moshe B.,"New York, NY",13,35,,4.0,9/20/2011,"This location is located at Menlo Park Mall in Edison. Edison has wonderful restaurants, from Italian to Japanese to Indian. Benihana, Kona Grill, Uno, Houlihans and others are within a few minutes of this establishment. The Cheesecake Factory is great. The decor is gorgeous. The place is pretty big and also has a bar area. For appetizers we had the stuffed mushrooms. My oh my, the cheese sauce was simply delightful. For entree, I  had the veggie burger. It was the biggest veggie burger I have ever eaten. And it was delicious. For desert, who can skip a cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory? I ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. Absolutely heaven! And the service was attentive, refilling the soda as needed and checking in to see if everything is okay."
Melissa C.,"Staten Island, NY",1,90,10,5.0,4/4/2013,"I usually don't enjoy franchise restaurants, but this was an exception for me.  The wait was very short, even though it was crowded.  Not too loud, even though it was crowded lol!   I had a roasted artichoke that was to die for.  I really don't even like artichokes but my husband wanted to try a different appetizer.  Boy I am almost sorry I tried it because I crave it all the time now!  Delicious grill-roasted flavor with a lovely dipping sauce that was not too heavy or overpowering.  My mouth is watering right now.  Service was good and I liked that they had non-alcoholic beer on the menu as I am pregnant but felt like having a cold beer.  What a treat!  As for the cheesecakes, I am not a fan of over-doing desserts.  I think simple is best, but they have a huge assortment, something for everyone."
Kat M.,"Bridgewater, NJ",64,158,,4.0,6/11/2012,"I like you Cheesecake Factory. Your food is good, your desserts are good, but the wait on weekends is redunkulous. But you're worth it so it's ok."
Angelo C.,"Port Reading, NJ",31,110,79,2.0,11/29/2012,A bit overrated. The wait staff appeared rushed and overworked. Food was okay but have had better.  Should be renamed the Shitcake Factory.
Emily T.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",3,24,,3.0,1/16/2011,"If you have never been to the well known Cheesecake Factory, then I recommend you go there for the actual cheesecake rather than the food.  The cheesecake, of course, are extremely delicious and also pricey as one would expect.  I usually just go for a slice rather than a whole cake as one cheesecake will fill me up pretty quickly and satisfyingly.  They have a nice range of cheesecake to choose from and the flavors will not disappoint. As for the food part of the restaurant, it is just average.  Sure when you walk in, you are immediately in awe of the fancy decor and wonder if you are actually in a restaurant.  The decor hinges on some Egyptian theme but it is not cheesy, no pun intended.  Anyways I have been there quite a few times.  For appetizers, I had the ultimate nachos with spicy chicken and a small plate of stuffed mushrooms.  These two are straight up yummy and I love the tang of the spicy chicken.  The stuffed mushrooms, while are tiny, packs a hefty punch and you won't feel them giving you 8 little mushrooms is a rip off of your money. For the entree, the portions are huge and one plate is more than enough for two people.  I do not recommend ordering more than one plate per two people unless you haven't eaten for days and have been left in the desert with no food or water.  If the aforementioned criteria applies to you, then by all means, please eat your heart out.  I have not tried too many plates of pasta but I have tried more than a few to know the pasta dishes are average at best.  The only common thing they all have is they are all very heavy handed and leaves you feeling bloated and stuffed after having just half of the dish.   Of course, the dessert course is self explanatory right?  I vote just aim directly for the desert! Overall, it's a decent restaurant.  The food is ok at best but it's a place you should try if you have never been to the famous Cheesecake Factory.  The cheesecakes are great and it's the only saving grace to a so and so meal."
Brandice H.,"Staten Island, NY",342,261,3,4.0,11/8/2009,"Came here with the boyfriend last night.  He was smart enough to call in a reservation.  Who thought that a restaurant in the mall would be so crowded but it was. However, we were seated within 15 minutes. For the appetizer, I ordered DELICIOUS stuffed mushrooms and for the main course I ate the basil and tomato pasta. The Portions were HUMONGOUS. The pasta was so-so though. For dessert we ordered a chocolate moose cake. (I've Had better). Inside, the ambiance was lovely.  When I go again, I will just get 2 orders of stuffed mushrooms."
Amber G.,"Edison, NJ",0,11,,4.0,6/4/2013,"Amazing food & great service.  Food is always fresh and tastes amazing for eating out, better than a home cooked meal.  However, drinks are overpriced.  Food is reasonably expensive for what you get but drinks are def overpriced which makes it an expensive visit."
Joseph M.,"Edison, NJ",9,19,31,1.0,9/8/2012,"Didn't make it to the cheesecake (desert). The food is absolutely terrible. The samosass tasted like pure salt with hints of chicken.  The Kobe Burger? Hints of decently cooked Kobe beef drowning in pure butter. Chicken picatta - copious amounts of salt with very little other flavor.  In hindsight it seems as though they belive that by overdoing elements that make food decadent they'll achieve excellence - nothing could be further from the truth. On a positive note the ambiance is nice (esp. considering the number of customers)...and I've heard great things about their staple - cheesecake.  The principle function of a restaurant is, however, the food (namely appetizers and entrees)...and if you can't deliver that then you can't be rated well as one."
Geraldine T.,"Hillside, NJ",151,157,76,3.0,6/26/2010,"I've gone to this place several times too many this past season and last. It's really the only decent restaurant to dine at Menlo mall (NJ isn't as fancy as NYC ;p). Thousands of dishes to choose from and it's cheap. I don't even like cheesecake but their red velvet cheesecake was pretty amazing. The service is always friendly and I've been lucky every time to avoid long waits. Weekends have rough waiting periods especially, so it's best to go later when there aren't too many families in line. I've had their pasta almost everytime I've gone. It's so hard to make a choice. The farfalle with chicken, four cheese pasta, and some other pasta with chicken and pesto pasta are all yummmy. And the negatives! Besides the fact that this is a chain restaurant (nothing spectacular about it), their Raspberry lemonade is too sour."
Joey T.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,12,,4.0,6/30/2014,A lot of the food is unhealthy and the portions are plentiful. I have gone here many times and will return in the future. The service has always been good. Recently I had the avocado egg rolls which were good. The happy hour special is nice.
