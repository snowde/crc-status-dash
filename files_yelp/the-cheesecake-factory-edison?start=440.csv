John E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,,1.0,3/19/2013,"Food is great and thats is not the issue here, the issue is the total disrespect for your time. The mall that this is part of should kick this place out, any enjoyment you have from the mall will vanish once you are told there is a 20 minute wait and you end up standing there 1 hour to get seated, mind you when the 20 minutes are up they wont tell you its another 40 minutes but rather they string you along, another 5 minutes another 10 so you cant even go do anything. The amount of people that do this to is unreal, go take a look, it's terrible! My advice is, if you cannot get seated right away do not eat here, don't do it, I don't care if they tell you its a 5 minute wait DO NOT DO IT! They need to be more honest with people, I call on everyone to boycott companies who have no respect for your time, 0 respect!"
Beth K.,"Middletown, DE",20,132,40,3.0,6/26/2012,Wow. What an attitude from the waiter. He should probably get his hearing checked. Food was good. Ketchup would have been nice
Dave C.,"Union, NJ",0,9,,4.0,3/10/2013,"Today was the first time I've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory and I was so happy I went.  We were slightly concerned about wait time,  went on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm, but the crowded line moved right along.  We were seated with a friendly waitress, who gave us drinks right away.  Everything we ordered was fantastic, the cheesecake was out of this world.  Reasonably priced for a family outing, I'll certainly be going back."
Sadaf S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",17,34,11,4.0,5/19/2012,"Always a great meal here, especially the brunch.   The wait  to get a table is usually long, as expected for places like this.  TIP: if you're coming with young children, give them a snack or small meal beforehand, otherwise they are going to get very cranky  waiting the usual 1 1/2 hours for a table.   But once you get seated, service is good and the food is always delicious. This is my go-to place for birthdays, mother's/father's days, and special occasion meals."
Holden W.,"Stamford, CT",17,134,,2.0,1/8/2010,"You know that your relationship with a long-term client is becoming more of a friendship when they suggest an inexpensive place out of concern for your expense account. We had an intimate and marvelous dinner but it was not because of CF's ambiance and food.  Amusing rather than memorable and size as opposed to quality would be another reminder on why I won't ever leave Manhattan for suburbs. Why have Egyptian-style columns in a place with such name, did pharaohs like cheesecake? Why portions are twice the normal size, is obesity not a concern in Central New Jersey? Why menu includes american, mexican, italian and french fare? Some questions I guess better not to be asked.  However, if you care for value as opposed to quality/ambiance, CF is a safe place to go, service was quite friendly, and surroundings/people seem civilized."
Cinthia G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",12,80,33,4.0,5/23/2012,"What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory that everyone doesn't already know?? It's a huge menu and if everyone in your group is craving something different, then this is the place to go. Sometimes the wait can get ridiculous, but for the most part, I enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory."
Richard T.,"Plainfield, NJ",0,9,,1.0,5/17/2009,"Went to this location with high hopes from friends urgings about how great this place is.  Wife treated me to birthday dinner, so chose this restaurant.  First things first, Sunday night at 8pm had to wait almost an hour(made my anticipation even greater).  Finally get seated at cafeteria style tables, crammed together like sardines, dark as night, could barely see the menus.     Lots of choices on the menu, first thing noticed is the prices are higher than comparable items at other chain restaurants.  Ordered Calimari appetizer to share, lots of bodies few rings and dry as heck, strike one.  Entrees were Jambalaya and Shrimp Scampi, was expecting huge portions from things I have heard.   Jambalaya was OK, portion was normal, but wifes shrimp were so salty and garlicky that my wife could not eat it.  I tried some thinking  she was being overdramatic, but low and behold I could not bear to eat it either(tasted like the salt jar fell in the pot).  Called waitress over to complain, she says ""oh yeah, they make it like that here""????   HUH, they make it uneatable?   Strike two. Service professionism was non existent, attitude was: we have plenty of people waiting to be in that seat you are in.  strike three.     We eat at alot of chain restaurants, this experience ranked at the next to bottom of all of them.   P.S.  Cheesecake was good if you don't mind paying 8 bucks a slice, some advice, go to Costco and get a whole Cheescake brand cheesecake for 15 bucks and its just  as good.  Never again will I go here."
Rad B.,"Dayton, NJ",76,214,9,4.0,5/1/2010,"Although their menu is extensive, you have to be quite careful when ordering. I ordered a burger which was excellent and before that I ordered the caramel glazed chicken with vegetables and jasmine rice which was also excellent but my boyfriend was not so lucky in his choice of shrimp linguine. Their peach fuzz (or something like it) drink and pomegranate margarita were quite yummy although the drinks are quite pricey (at $10 each) meaning not really worth the price.  I decided to take some cheesecake home (got the Godiva and the Tiramisu) and they were so yummy! Took us 4 days between 4 people to finish the cake since they're extremely rich.  Long story short, be careful about what you order and you'll either really love or really dislike this place!"
Sam B.,"Santa Clara, CA",194,818,933,4.0,3/16/2012,I have not been to cheesecake factory for many years because I hate waiting 30 minutes for tables and eating in a dark and noisy restaurant. My co-worker was craving for carb free cheesecake and he want me to try it. We drove 30 minutes from Newark and I was very hungry by the time we get there. I guess we were lucky and there is a table for 2 of us. I had the skinnylicious salmon and they are very good. The low carb cheesecake are not very sweet and very light. Service was fast and excellent.
Jo Z.,"Rahway, NJ",0,5,,1.0,5/10/2015,"Just HORRIBLE!! We made a reservation 3 weeks ago by phone for Mother's Day Brunch and were told they were taking reservations for only 7 people or more. We were going to be 7 people and were told we had the reservation at 12:00 Noon. We got there with my 92 year old mother after walking all the way with her from the parking garage and when we approached the hostess desk and gave our name, we were told there was no reservation for us?? The hostess said ""We don't take reservations"" and when my sister responded she had made one 3 weeks ago the very rude and unprofessional male manager who had his back to us the whole time, turned around and said ""We only take reservations from 9:00am-10:00am!! None the less it was an hour wait! I have been a restaurant manager for 13 years and have never seen such unprofessional and rude behavior. Apparently they don't care being such a big busy chain restaurant but I disagree! Whoever we spoke to on the phone was obviously not trained properly as to the guidelines of the reservations for today. Not even an apology from this manager for their negligence. I have never been there before but I can assure you I will never go back! If you can't handle the volume of a busy holiday then don't open. Customer satisfaction is key!! Since every other place was already booked with reservations we ended up at TGI Fridays where the service was excellent and everyone was friendly!! You should take a lesson from them!!"
Kara T.,"Albuquerque, NM",50,195,124,3.0,1/9/2012,I like Cheesecake Factory! The shrimp bacon club is amazing and I'm always going back for more. They make a mean shirley temple and the bread you get as a appetizer is excellent. The prices are fair and our service has always been acceptable. Oh also have a slice of cheesecake!!!!
Susan B.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",0,72,,1.0,5/11/2011,"Each time I eat here it is worse than the last time. Got takeout last time and it was a disaster. Called at 11:25 and was told that I was calling ""too early"" and that I should call back at 11:30! Ordered at 11:35, was told the food would be ready in 25 minutes. Got there at 12:00 and paid and then waited and waited. Food was finally ready at 12:20. When I got back to the office it was packed badly and they had forgotten the cutlery. If you want lunch go to Nordstrom Cafe instead. Far better choice!"
Tammy L.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,1,,2.0,11/2/2012,"What can I say my daughter wanted to try The Cheesecake Factory for the first time, and what a horrible experience.  My daughter ordered a simple blue cheese burger and was told 20 minutes later that some ingredients for this burger was not avaliable.  WOW a burger, I ordered pasta the chicken undercooked, and the noddles swimming in butter.  My friend order fish tacos and the fish tasted bland and dry,  I was so disappointed and the bill was $90 what a waste. After tasting this horrible food  I did not want to waste anymore money on the cheesecake.  I sooner go to Pinhos Bakery for a real cheesecake treat.  Do yourself a favor go home and cook avoid wasting money.  BYW avoid the Rainforest the decor is thing  working for this place."
n b.,"Monmouth Junction, NJ",27,65,34,2.0,3/28/2012,This review is soley based on the cheesecake. I've had better at the local diner. Just a step up from the box recipe. Definitely not worth $7!!!
Ricki T.,"West Orange, NJ",0,29,,5.0,6/27/2012,the food is amazing here! the portions are huge and so delicious. The menu is extremely long so there is always something for everyone. The service has always been great when i went and the place is beautiful. Only complaint is that sometimes it gets really loud because its always packed but other than that... definitely one of my favorite places to eat in the area.
Warren H.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",3,21,,4.0,1/31/2010,"I'm never a big fan of going to chain restaurants like this and Applebees.  But, their food is delicious.  Be warned- the entrees come in epic proportions. Towards the end of my meal, I have decided to order a slice of cheesecake.  I mean...why not?  As the restaurant's name implies, I would think they specialize in making it.  Unfortunately, when the server brought the cheesecake, I wasn't impressed.  The cheesecake was frozen rock-solid.  So much for freshness.  I did take a bit of it (as it slowly defrosts) and it was good, but not great.  Maybe, I'll just bring my own cheesecake when I return."
Red G.,"Mountain View, CA",6,38,7,5.0,2/20/2009,"I love this place.  I don't know about the negative reviews especially about the complaints about the long wait times.  I mean, what to expect? This is a chain and the food really is that good that some people are willing to wait hours to eat it. The portions are huge and filling. I always have to take half of it home.  The service is what I expect considering it's a large restaurant. Try the following: Chicken Madeira Chicken Picatta Louisiana Chicken Pasta Avocado Eggrolls I recommend this place, but be prepared for the long wait if you go here for dinner especially on the weekends.  Note: They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is already there."
Efrain J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,4.0,3/19/2014,"Best cheesecake in the county!!  ...though expensive.   Also, good appetizers and nice ambiance.  Love the mac n cheese balls and avocado eggrolls!"
Andrew Lee H.,"Newark, NJ",23,46,38,3.0,4/24/2009,"When you are in an establishment that everyone else thinks is cool, it usually isn't.  It's like Webster Hall (ok, that came out of? somewhere? i'll probably end up reviewing Webster Hall for kicks).  And the wait time at this Cheesecake Factory in Edison sucks.  However, you and your date will feel special when you actually get to sit down.  The place just looks cool with its high, factory-like ceilings and dark-wood paneling.  Other than that, there is a lot of commotion and havoc with the customers jumping and screaming.  I can tell that the waiters are working purely off of adrenaline, and some of them look stoned off of their own endorphins and sweat. NOT for Groups (unless everyone hates everyone)... I really don't think its a good idea because there is just so much noise and activity, and there is no room for conversation or time to think about what to get.  Everyone should just get a cheese-burger and a cheese-cake... maybe have everyone share some Port wine to wash it down with, not that there's really a need to swallow your food."
Tendrement C.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,57,6,5.0,4/26/2014,"Got there around 12.30 and got a booth straight away. Our waitress was attentive even though very busy with all her tables to attend. The frozen strawberry daiquiri was perfect and smooth. We got the factory nachos as appetizer and we couldn't get enough of them: fresh, crisp, with a good amount of melted cheese and guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. We devoured it. For our entrées we got chicken enchiladas, very tasty and a lunch portion of chicken parmegiano with angel pasta and marinara sauce: everything tastes fresh and delish! As it was expected, we got almost all of our entrées to go! We indulged in two portions of cheesecake that we brought home too: the oreo one and for me the caramel macadamia... Well, what could I say about it that you don't know yet?! Yeah, it's called cheesecake factory for a reason! We'll go back, as often as I can!"
