Annie V.,"Piscataway, NJ",0,24,,4.0,8/6/2010,"Loves: Food and drinks are amazing. Dis-Likes: There is always a wait for a table, inside is usually really loud, outside is right on the street so you have car exhaust fumes in your face and tables are very close together."
Katie M.,"Woodbridge, NJ",65,6,,5.0,4/19/2014,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. The food is delicious and the decor is very fancy. However, it is quite pricey. I have not tried to cheesecake yet -- perhaps next time. Drinks are expensive but all in all it is a fantastic place to eat. I would definitely recommend."
Karina C.,"Elizabeth, NJ",2,19,,4.0,12/23/2011,Really like this place. Food is good.. Service is good.. And rigth on menlo park mall.
Avi N.,"Edison, NJ",6,39,,1.0,12/5/2011,"We went there for a birthday celebration. The beers are 6.50, only 3-4 choices on tap and quite average like Yeungling, etc. not Sam Adams, to justify the steep price. My wife's Mojito was wimpy which is intolerable at 10.95 a pop.  I did not see any fresh mint in it either. The worst part was my fish tacos entree. Tortillas were a little dried up and the fish was limp and soggy. The whole thing was quite tasteless, no cabbage in it. I fail to understand why people go to throw away their money at these high priced places. This proves my firm opinion that Mexican food is still best at Baja Fresh at any price. I wish I had made a complaint right there but I did not want to ruin the occasion."
S A.,"Honolulu, HI",101,91,21,3.0,9/22/2011,Got there and was immediately seated. Ordered the Cajun Chicken and shrimp pasta. Bread came out fast and it was great.  Pasta came out like 30 min later. I was getting a little annoyed because the waiter kept checking but no food. Finally got it and it was good. Pasta was cooked perfectly. The chicken and shrimp were both tender. I gave it 3 stars due to service. I have never waited that long for 1 meal.
Wilfredo R.,"Staten Island, NY",4,21,,5.0,2/9/2012,"Every experience is unique and never had a bad experience, very professional clean and the food is always on point.  Their menu is 15 pages long with everything imaginable.  There is no reason to go to applebees or chilis to spend an arm n a leg for mediocre small portion food when here for the same price you get twice the experience for same price. And their specialty of cheesecake is the worlds best from traditional cheesecake, to tiramisu to hershey or godiva cheesecake."
Christine J.,"Port Richmond, Staten Island, NY",201,371,257,4.0,3/29/2013,"For a chain this place is great. There's always an extremely long wait but the bar area is free reign if you can grab a table.  They give you buzzers to let you know when your table is ready so you can walk around the mall a little while you're waiting.  I love the warm bread they give you when you sit down especially the pumpernickle bread with oats.  The menu is at least 10 pages with a huge variety.  I've tried a lot of different things; the mac n cheese balls being my favorite appetizer and the Chicken Romano (parmesan crusted chicken) as my favorite entree.  They've recently changed their caesar dressing and it's much better now.   Another salad that's good is the BLT salad, two big wedges of iceberg with bluecheese, bacon bits and tomatoes.  They have really good lemonade flavors and lots of great cocktails.  Of course there is a lot of cheesecake but I love the plain with the sourcream topping.  I can keep rambling on because there's so many good things to try but I'll just leave it at that."
Jessica K.,"New York, NY",0,17,,1.0,1/28/2013,Food is standard fare upscale fast-food. Service is dreadful. Servers don't always notice your existence. I suggest going elsewhere.
Toni W.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,64,,2.0,10/12/2013,Only giving two stars because the bartender was great (don't know his name but he is asian...other bartender Jayana is rude)  The food was terrible!  I recommend coming here to drink and don't waste money on disgusting food.
Kim R.,"Canton, ME",23,84,,4.0,7/26/2011,While cheesecake is a chain I think of it as an upscale one...to get best experience go at an off time or around lunch. I came here w my bf for lunch on a Sunday and we got seated right away..time before a 10 minute wait for a table for 8 not bad? On a Thursday evening...my favorites the chicken avacado club the bread grilled on butter and garlic aoili plus fresh veggies n avacado were perfect plus their fries are ymmo. Also new favorite bbq ranch chicken salad lunch portion for 8$! I thought it was going to eat me. It was soooo good!...a large menu which they make everything very good..guacamole made to order is good surprisingly! Oh and you prob won't have room but the banana cream cheesecke is devine!
Kevin R.,"Staten Island, NY",27,96,,4.0,11/6/2008,"I've been past many Cheesecake Factories in recent years and I never had a chance to venture into one. After a night after devouring ribs at Big Ed's - I decided that I had enough room for dessert so a visit to Cheesecake Factory was at hand. First things first, as soon as you see this place you think: Way too fancy for just cheesecake. As you walk in, you still think the same. This place looks and feels like it should be on the Las Vegas strip in Caesar's Palace or something. My group and myself decided to just go for dessert so we didn't get to taste anything else besides cheesecake, but I took a look through the menu. Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu, besides cheesecake they have burgers, pasta, salads, Asian dishes, and much more.  I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake and it was just as delicious as I though it would be. I also tasted the Cookie Dough Peanut Butter Chocolate something something cheesecake and that was way-way too rich. It was good, but if you like something that rich you should order it. Factoring decor, the menu, and that huge bar of theirs, this will be a good place for a date.  I will eventually head back, to see how the rest of their menu shapes out so I can get a good feel for this chain, but based on my love of cheesecake alone, this place is a go."
Ray-John C.,"Union Township, NJ",1,6,3,4.0,1/18/2014,"My date and I had the pleasure of being served by one, miss Jennifer C. She was a delight to deal with and her suggestions/pairings were spot on with what we were craving."
Jerome Espinosa B.,"Manhattan, NY",227,658,191,3.0,8/7/2010,"came here for late lunch with 2 friends, Emily & Abby, on a weekend, after we realized we didn't make it to nearby Ichi Umi by 3pm. prior to this visit, i didn't realize this place offers food-things other than ""cheese cake"" ----we had our lunch al fresco, as the weather was just excellent. appetizers were served in big portions on equally huge plates, too, as we seeped our drinks. i like the calamari, & those 2 other types of finger foods that had artichokes and those that looked like dumplings(actually). so when we're ready for the main dish, i was kinda full. but being a food lover, i just went on gulping my food (shrimp plus beef steak). i have to say their mashed potatoes tasted great--just like those we make at home. the 3 of us friends enjoyed our (really) long (but fun) conversation, we had coffee, and a piece of their famous velvet cheese cake---yummy yummy yummy!  service was OK, though i thought the guy who attended to us was kinda shy --- he just talks so rapidly, i barely could hear him clearly, until he realized he had to switch his pace he he he.  on d overall, it was worth the trip! btw, interiors inside looked like those we see in movies featuring tuscany-italy (or something similar).----this place can easily accommodate a very big party anytime...."
Sanjeev K.,"Edison, NJ",10,31,6,5.0,5/21/2009,"A link of a chain restaurant. This link is as good as the others. I have been to some other Cheese Cake Factory restaurants in other cities but being local to Edison, i frequent this one.  The art and decor is great. high ceiling and comfy booths.. The food is exquisite particularly the Chicken Madiera.. yum yum.  And lets not forget the countless options of deserts. I am a food junkie so i like to try different desserts and believe me all deserts are fabulous so can't really say which of them would be on the top of the list.  The one and only drawback is the wait time . Usually have to wait for nearly an hour before getting a table. but then since it is at Menlo Park Mall one can take a stroll in the mall before getting buzzed  for a table. ( The buzzer won't work in the mall so its better to get back to the restaurant about 15 minutes before the wait time is over. Don't forget to ask how long is the waiting time :) ) Enjoy"
john l.,"Somerset, NJ",0,7,,4.0,7/2/2011,"Chain that  caters to everyone.  The food here is just okay, but they have added a small plate menu which is wonderful!  They now offer small individual salad plates, and small meals.  I ordered the Greek salad, which was a perfect size.  i had room for a mushroom pizza (also from the small plate menu) and plenty of room for their great cheesecake.  What's the point of going here if your not having a slice of their cheesecake? Perfect meal, and at a reasonable price!  Service was fast, and the wait staff very pleasant."
Jack N.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,352,129,3.0,5/19/2008,"Average food ekes out a 3 cuz of cheap prices Well, cheap for the food anyway. You probably end up waiting at the bar like I did cuz the wait time is ridiculous. You might as well eat at the bar. For some odd reason, my friends and I only come here for special occasions (usually b-days). If it wasn't a special occasion, we would have ate at the bar, which require no wait, except that a mix drink (the Platinum Mojito) cost $12+. Umm, this is Jersey, not midtown NYC. That price is like 2/3 the price of most of the dishes here. The food is not great, but not terrible either."
Jonny M.,"Scranton, PA",7,50,2,3.0,3/26/2008,"Just like any big franchised eating establishment: don't go there at peak hours if you want to enjoy it!   Yes, on saturday afternoon it's packed, what do you think???  Staff is busy and runs around like a bunch of teens in an Orlando Bloom store, orders are messed up and it's extremely noisy and has a cafeteria feel to it. But go there on a Tuesday afternoon and the experience is much better, staff was friendly and food was OK.  Some of the cheesecakes are pretty good, but it's no Junior. Why only 3 stars??  Because it's still fast food... if the food is pre-prepared, even if you charge $15 for it, it's still fast food.. Huh, wazzat? You can't leave work on a Tuesday to have lunch with your family? Sucks to be you!"
Steve G.,"Union, NJ",540,808,,2.0,12/21/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory makes some of the best commercial grade cream cheese cheesecake out there,  with flavor choices abundant.  But, ""you don't get dessert if you don't eat your dinner!,"" and here is where things begin to complicate.  In a chain built around merchandising cheesecake, everything else is also over hyped.  Look at the many menu pics and read the descriptions; you would think that you were in a 5-star fine restaurant.  In truth, very little on the plate will resemble what you read on the menu.  It isn't that the food is bad; it isn't.  The portions are large and the food, meatloaf in particular, is good.  Their kitchens definitely do simple dishes far better than they do the finesse which predominates their menu-- the smoke and mirrors of merchandising aren't edible.  When they're busy, service can get very sloppy and forgetful-- well beyond reasonable accommodation.  Cleanliness can sometimes be an issue; there seems to be more hair on plates and dirty silverware than in most chain restaurants.  What Cheesecake Factory is-- a fun place with great desserts-- shouldn't be downplayed, but don't expect a whole lot more."
Kiet L.,"Jersey City, NJ",64,273,5,4.0,11/14/2010,"The key to enjoying your experience at Cheesecake factory is to get a buzzer 1 hour before you are hungry, shop at the mall, and then come back around 10 minutes before the said time.  That way, you won't have to wait forever. As with other locations, this place is crazy crowded. They provide large servings of American cuisine that I find pretty decent. You will be plenty full and have a doggy bag to enjoy for the next day."
Lala A.,"New Brunswick, NJ",39,303,101,4.0,9/30/2012,4 star chain restaurant. Huge menu. Never had a bad dish. Service is hit or miss. Decent wait during peak hours.
