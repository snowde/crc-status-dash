Mocha P.,"New York, NY",0,12,,1.0,4/17/2011,"Worst experience at this Cheesecake factory. In general the food is good but this location has really bad customer service. My friends ordered a tea, it literally took them 25 minutes for them to bring out the hot water. I ordered chicken hash and it had crab meat in it. The manager comes with no apology or compensation for their mistake. Everything was off with the service."

Diana N.,"NY, NY",73,646,,3.0,9/1/2008,"This is the first Cheesecake Factory I've been to outside of Boston and DC.  My review is pretty similar to the ones for the Cheesecake Factory in Boston and DC.  After all, it's a chain!   The restaurant is huge and good for groups.  Service is slow, in part because the restaurant is huge and the servers cover a big section.  The food is decent, but the portions are huge, so expect to take leftovers home.  The cheesecake is yummy and they have a huge selection.  I like the Oreo Cheesecake and the Chocolate Mousse cheescake. If you come here for someone's birthday, you can get a group of people to sing happy birthday for you or your friend. Overall, prices may seem expensive, but you are getting two meals worth of food for the price.  Also, they have a lunch menu until 5pm everyday (available even on Sundays!)."
Erik D.,"Staten Island, NY",20,16,24,4.0,9/20/2010,"Came here yesterday to celebrate a friend's birthday, the night was ultimately a success. The portions were huge, as always, which makes one feel better about how high the prices can be, depending on the dish. Personally I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but the restaurant makes itself easy to enjoy, even without consuming it's namesake. The experience in this Cheesecake Factory was much the same as it was in every other one I've ever ventured to, which is probably the aim."
Anne T.,"Metuchen, NJ",83,6,,2.0,3/9/2012,"so overrated. I had heard amazing things about this place. went with 4 people. all our orders were eh, ok. not worth the money. the portions size was generous but the quality of the food stunk  fish and chips has cheese inside of it - disgustung. service was ok. decor was beautiful. noisy atmosphere. cheesecake size was large but at $7.00 a piece it should be. None of us will return. have had much better and at kinder prices."
Undercova A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,392,178,3.0,8/16/2010,"Not fine dining, but a huge menu.  There is literally something for every picky eater.  The appetizers are great (fried mac & cheese, chicken lettuce wraps) and the entrees are very generous.  Loud, boisterous, and packed.  This is a place to pig out.  Come with a group (as I did) and have a blast!"
Sheesh S.,"Maplewood, NJ",2,139,,2.0,11/19/2010,"I tried this place out with my girlfriend.  I had a chicken dish and she had a salad.  After being seated we waited over an hour for food to arrive.  I got my chicken, she did not get her salad.   The salad came almost 30 minutes after my chicken and our waiter was nowhere to be found.  The manager offered us a free slice of cheesecake which we declined.  Haven't been back since.  My chicken was dry and her salad was very watery."
Kristen S.,"Union, NJ",7,47,2,3.0,8/13/2010,"Okay, this is kind of obvious, but the cheesecake is great. The rest of the food is...good. It was loud and to get in I had to wait awhile. The decor is really bad. The service is nice and the bathrooms are clean, which is a plus. I hate dirty bathrooms. Suggestion: Oreo Cheesecake :D"
David L.,"Princeton, NJ",1,18,,3.0,4/2/2013,"The wait was horrible. They said 2.5 hours, we asked  the hostess after two hours for a table she made sure we didn't get our table early.  She looked at the computer and told us we had to wait  another 1/2 hour according to the system.  Food portions were big for pasta and salads, but taste was only average."
Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",211,369,687,4.0,5/6/2010,"After hearing about this place, I finally went. The place was packed and the wait was around 40 min. Ick! I had their white clam chowder soup which was pretty good and their steak. Since, I don't normally eat heavy foods, their dishes filled me up quick from all the fat and oil. To my disappoint, by the time I finished my food, I was too stuffed to try their cheesecake even though I had already picked out what I wanted. Overall, it was pretty good. I will def. have to try their cheesecake in the future."
G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798,4.0,4/2/2010,"I come to this CF quite often and it is always terrific. For a chain, I think Cheesecake Factory really delivers on all levels- food, service, ambience. It is a really fun place and the food is tasty, affordable, delicious. Eaten my way through most of the menu n u can't go wrong whatever u decide. My particular favorites are the Beef ribs, Cajun chicken Littles, Ranch House burger (now off the menu but all their burgers are great and they actually cook rare), Chicken and Biscuits, Fish Tacos, Tons of Fun Burger, Burrito Grande, Steak diane, Corn fritters, macaroni and cheese on and on and on.  Cheesecakes are all incredible too- chocolate tuxedo, banana cream cheesecake, brownie, vanilla bean, white chocolate blueberry cheesecake, etc."
Ernie D.,"Edison, NJ",0,24,,3.0,10/3/2012,"Service could be better, but my meal was delicious, I ordered the Romano crusted chicken. My wife ordered some chicken dish which was very dry the waitress took it off the bill but got no apology. I will probably go back."
Derek F.,"New Brunswick, NJ",21,208,1218,4.0,4/9/2010,"Heaven is the Coconut Cheesecake Topped with Coconut Cream Custard, all on a Chocolate Macaroon Crust. Outstanding & heavy. Also had the overpriced &small portioned Spicy Chicken Salad which was tasty. The ambiance & service are top level for a major chain, thought I checking in the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas w the attention given on a packed nite."
Michael D.,"Fort Lee, NJ",4,34,7,4.0,8/25/2009,"Ah yes... the legendary Cheesecake Factory.  While some complain it is hit-or-miss and a tad expensive, I consider it to be the McDonald's of casual dining: they aren't reinventing the wheel, you know exactly what you're going to get, and generally with those expectations they deliver. The drinks are well made and don't skimp on the liquor, which is good considering you are paying restaurant prices.  The outdoor seating in the summer is a plus.  Though perhaps the most delightful aspect of the Cheesecake Factory is taking a date there for some drinks and dessert... preferably later in the evening.  It can get LOUD in there and most of the indoor seating is not very intimate... but if you bring a date the bar area seating is better and outdoor seating when in season works as well. If you go during the evening rush or on weekends, be prepared for up to an hour wait, which is why this is my favorite 9pm + late dinner joint.  But at least there's a Barnes and Noble right next door, and even though the hostesses claim the buzzers do not work in there, they do. All in all you get what you get, I'm more patient than most."
Dan O.,"Denver, CO",0,56,1,4.0,1/22/2011,"Sunday brunch baby! French toast stacked to the ceiling! I got some kind of Fiesta Burrito that was absolutely ridiculous. I think its on the regular breakfast menu, but make sure you get there after noon if you want to order drinks ;-) I can honestly say I've never seen any burrito this size in my entire life.This thing was enormous. It was stuffed with eggs, cheese and all sorts of goodies like chicken chorizo, potatoes, peppers oninos, tomatoes, etc. It was slathered in a tomatillo avocado cream sauce to top it off and served with a side of black beans. I was really impressed with the quality and of course quantity of food served. (The frozen belinis were awesome too). I've got to come here for dinner one night!"
Maome S.,"Emerson, NJ",28,209,4,5.0,9/1/2007,"Wow, so many negative nancies....  my 5 stars are here to balance out the low rating. Honestly, I don't know why there are only 3 reviews so far and all so far are negative.  Cheesecake is a chain establishment and it seems like the reviewers were expecting a boutique patisserie that caters to the lifestyles of the rich and famous.  Yea this place is loud because lots of people eat there (more than 20).  And it's a fun place for groups. Where else do you get such an extensive menu selection?  I've been to Cheesecakes all over the US and this one in Edison is JUST LIKE THE REST OF THEM.  sheesh people... anyway, some of my favs: herb crusted salmon cajun chicken littles banana cream cheesecake craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake key lime cheesecake pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal) iced green tea (new item!) tropical iced tea raspberry and strawberry lemonade"
Stefan S.,"Jersey City, NJ",34,39,11,3.0,3/30/2011,"As far as chain restaurants go this is probably my favorite in the area. My only gripe is that every time I've ever been here there is a hella long wait to be seated. The restaurant is connected to the mall so I'm sure it is busy all the time.  Food is what you'd expect, nothing crazy. I've had really good service every time I've been so that is a plus. Great option when I want to go out for a low-key local dinner."
Tony F.,"Staten Island, NY",0,7,2,4.0,8/5/2010,"Good food, huge menu selection and awesome cheesecake. Expect to wait 30+ mins on a Friday or Saturday but worth it. Prices are reasonable and the portions are good. It's pretty loud so great for families."
Kent W.,"New York, NY",73,307,9,4.0,11/29/2008,"Ok. Another chain restaurant. Ticker symbol: CAKE ---- This is my 5th time at a Cheesecake Factory. It is phuckin' legit man. That's it! The burgers --- good as any place in the area. It's double patties w/ the works and the bread is buttered up. (order TOP FUN). The other delight was the ""habachi steak"" That bad boy just melts in your mouth. Ok. Alright. Good job Cheesecake Factory. Prices: good bang for your buck."
Michelle S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,59,,4.0,4/21/2012,"My favorite ""go to place"" when I meet up with friends. I love the calamari and the white chocolate truffle cheesecake. Servings are huge."
