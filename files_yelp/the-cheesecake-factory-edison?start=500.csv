Geoff Y.,"New York, NY",64,173,14,4.0,7/9/2008,Pretty expensive.  Dubious to okay quality.  Sweet corn tamale cakes are the way to go for an appetizer.  Cheesecake is probably more of the main attraction here.  Be prepared to take food home.
Sunny M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,78,,4.0,1/21/2010,"Very efficiently run chain restaurant, despite being located in a busy shopping mall.  The food is always satisfying and the menu selection offers a wide range of dishes. * I recommend the sashami-style Ahi tuna entre!  It's mouth-watering goodness! :)"
CJ C.,"Atlantic City, NJ",5,10,5,1.0,8/3/2009,"Cheesecake factory is not what it used to be. Last visit I found dirty tables, dirty silverware, dirty glassware, lukewarm food and cold service. Obvious cost cutting due to slow sales. Also the whole experience of waiting for a table only to be shoved near others like sardines is getting old."
Bryan  J.,"New York, NY",126,134,24,2.0,3/10/2010,"i don't eat cheessteak, so that may cloud my low regard for this place.  most everything is overly greasy.  the one high point, their guac & chips appetizer was ruined for me last time i ordered takeout.  not only was it not served spicey, as i requested, but it was served with french fries.  french fries and guac?  who does that?"
Chloe-Lynn O.,"New York, NY",30,84,6,2.0,1/28/2008,"Eh.  When we didn't have a Cheesecake Factory in NJ and the only place I had ever seen it was by Roosevelt Field Mall in NY, I definitely appreciated it.  Maybe it was because of the fact that it was far and it just seemed like a place I wouldn't come around to very often (sorta like a PF Chang's.. still never ate there). However, since the one at Menlo Park Mall opened, I can count how many times I've been there and how many times I've been disappointed by what I ate on both my hands. First off, let's talk about what a ridiculous wait.  Maybe if you got there for lunch on a weekday it wouldn't be so bad, but if you want to be there for diner?  Expect a wait, anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half... depending on the size of your party. I usually don't mind a wait, and it's not that bad if you can walk around the mall while hanging onto that vibrating light up thingy they give you, but they claim it only works inside the restaurant.  LIE!  You can take it to Barnes & Nobles if you'd like.  But aside from feeling the need to stay in the restaurant, the place is usually swarming with hungry people, all just standing around waiting for a table. Finally you get seated and you get the menu and WTF?! Why is it so dark?  I always find myself squinting and turning from page 13 to 4 to 7 to 18 back to 2, still not sure what I want by the second time the server comes around. Service could be better, I'll admit it's gotten worse since they've started opening up all over the place.  I used to hear that Cheesecake Factory servers were the best paid, cause they WERE the best.  I used to be a server, so I know how it rolls.. but when I leave a restaurant unhappy 8 out of 10 times its the food and the service.. so as of late, Cheesecake has not impressed me much.  (i.e. this happened today... a HOT plate [aka a plate that your server has let sit under a heat lamp much longer than they should've) gets brought out by a person holding it with a cloth napkin.  Instead of putting it on the table in front of you, why is this person handing it to you?  Or better yet, why are they expecting someone closer to them to hand it to you?!  Isn't it their job?!  To serve you your food?  What is the purpose of tipping them, if they're just going to burn you or your dining mate instead?) I'll give them points however for the huge glasses they give of soda (it better be huge, i'm paying $3 for it), the huge portions of food (though I know spots where I can get more for much, much cheaper) and for giving the pages in their ridiculously long menus, numbers to navigate by."
Joey V.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,18,5,5.0,5/26/2008,"OMG! Me and my family love TCF and GLC! They have reasonable prices with big food portions! My favs are the house burger, and the buffalo tenders! Their dessert is famous, but not amazing! Try the Banana Cheesecake! DEEEE-LISH! Their Mango Iced Tea is awesome 2! Service is great! Plus, its in one of my favorite malls. Go here!   Cons: Their bathrooms are HOT as hell! It's like an oven in there!"
Farah C.,"Iselin, NJ",0,21,,3.0,7/18/2010,"This was great when I first moved to the area, but after all these years, I guess I've gotten too used to the food.  I still love love love the brown bread and mango iced tea.  My friends and I just order from the small plates menu and don't even bother to look at the regular menu anymore.   This is the Monday ladies lunch standby.  Or my husband and I grab a small plate or two if we are stuck at the mall on the weekend.  I still hate how they won't seat you until your entire party is present which is difficult when going there with a toddler and waiting for friends to show up.  We've been passed up on the waiting list a couple of times and had to complain to the manager."
Lauren P.,"New York, NY",38,169,292,3.0,8/18/2008,"way over rated.. youre paying for the experience.. the food isnt bad, and the portions are large, but its not a place my friends and i like to go to often"
