D C.,"Edison, NJ",0,6,3,1.0,5/14/2017,"We used to like this place... till this happened with my brother on law.. this was second time...he found a big cockroach in his pasta...just this location should be called ""cockroach factory..""! Called the manager immediately...to our surprise, the manager said.."" I am sorry but there are similar complaints recently...they have complained to the Simon properties but they are not taking action..!"" ...Just said he can replace the plate but who would like to eat after what he said.."
Syed R.,"South Amboy, NJ",51,23,8,1.0,12/17/2017,"waited 45 mins for a table, finally got seated on a small wobbly table where dwarfs would not even fit, went back to the front desk to see if we could be sat at a different table was rudely informed you will have to wait another 20 - 30 minutes,,,are you kidding me? walked rite out"
David L.,"Nottingham, MD",11,211,1529,2.0,10/16/2016,"One hour waiting for the seat and the food was too salty, you even can't swallow it ! Never come back to this location for dinner ! What happy to the kitchen? The SALT on sale ?"
Brittany P.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",145,23,5,4.0,10/22/2017,"Have been here a few times a great meeting up location. Service was great, I got the Sheila salad, which was good but not the best thing ever. Always love the bread they give. 4 stars just because I wasn't too excited about the food this time"
Alyxes N.,"Redlands, CA",44,86,70,1.0,8/23/2017,Asked an employee about the cheesecakes for take out and one employee stared at me and walked out behind the counter for her break. The cashier was believe it or not VERY MUCH worst. Even without her disrespectful side comments you can just tell she would rather be anywhere but on the clock.
David V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",127,7,6,4.0,4/10/2017,"The portion sizes definitely live up to the name. It was pretty packed during a Sunday afternoon when we went, but the 20 minute wait was well worth it. The food itself is delicious which the Louisiana chicken pasta and buffalo blasts hit the spot. What impressed me most, even more then the cheesecake, was the waiter service. They were kind, friendly and attentive without being too overbearing. Definitely recommend for a nice place to eat with someone or a group of friends"
Stephy S.,"Holmdel, NJ",137,559,45,4.0,3/19/2017,"I always enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. This is a nice location since it is within the Menlo Park Mall, so you can wander around a bit before waiting for your table (since there is always a wait weekend nights!). Food is always good, cheesecake always better."
Amber S.,"Lancaster, PA",182,128,183,3.0,11/2/2016,"I have heard so many good things about this restaurant and every time we try and visit one, the wait is at least an hour. For once we were by a location on a Monday and they only had a 5-10 minute wait, which was a great start.  After being seated, it did take awhile until out waitress came over to take our drink order. She was very friendly and did get everything we ordered correct, which is a plus. However, when it came to getting drink refills, and the time it took our food to come out, that was a different story. We saw our food sitting under the heat lamp for at least 15 minutes before it was even brought to our table by another employee. While I know our waitress was very busy, since she was running from table to table, maybe they should have less tables, or more help? The food itself was mediocre. While it had a decent flavor, there was nothing special about it all. The fact we got pasta, and it was sitting under a heat lamp for so long, the top already had the dried-out-ness to it. For this being a first visit, it did not leave the best impression, and I am not in hurry to return."
Marina G.,"Bay Ridge, NY",54,29,2,5.0,8/25/2017,"Always great service, always delicious food. Never have any complaints. Love coming here"
Julie M.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",4,4,2,2.0,3/26/2017,"I've been here before and service and food is usually very good. Waiting for a table is to be expected.  Reason for low rating has to do with my experience tonight.  After waiting for over an hour we finally get squeezed into a booth. As stated before, to be expected...after all it's a weekend night.  I order my usual meal, the bang, bang chicken and shrimp. What did I get? Over done chicken and blackened shrimp. Portion, half what is usually served. When I tried to eat it, I couldn't. The shrimp was so spicy it was inedible and nothing like its ever been. I told server what was wrong and she said she would take it back. So far no complaints.  Where it went wrong was when both the server and the manager kept trying to tell me that the food was fine and I was wrong. When I told them it's what I always get and it was not made correctly they kept insisting the problem was with me.  Finally resolved by making me a new plate which I opted to take home since by this time everyone in my party was done eating.  So what did I get? Did I get a full portion? NO I got what looks like leftovers.  The only reason I'm not giving them one star is because they at least chose to pull dish from the bill, which by the way was $250.  For the amount of the check and the fact that I had to insist that the problem wasn't me but their bad cooking, the least they could have done was given me a full portion."
Stephanie N.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,21,,1.0,8/7/2017,Today there was a roach in my food. Alive. Crawling on the plate. Please check your food before you eat it. The manager took it off the bill but I feel that my whole meal should have been free. I'm so disappointed and disgusted. I was offered another meal but who can eat after seeing this?
B L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,114,3,2.0,2/13/2017,Ok went for a  bday for a quick thing with the kids had a bad waitress some Hispanic women with a accent that she couldn't get our orders right we asked for a manager he nvr came  We had ask another waitress for help 3 times we nvr got asked if we need refills  The kids got sliders no condiments where offered just horrible service  When we got our order right it was good  But quickly after we left we had to use the rest room a couple times ?? Very strange beware  Okay I been here twice now cheesecake was almost frozen not fresh ???  Service is still slow. I guess if I every go back to a cheese cake factory I should go to another location maybe that would help.
Nick S.,"Colonia, NJ",0,3,,2.0,10/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory To-Go experience: I was patiently waiting for a good 3 min because I understand that To-Go is a busy job to work. However, the To-Go person, Corrin M, refused to acknowledge my existence for an extra two minutes and just kept using the computer. As someone who has worked To-Go at a restaurant before, I understand it's overwhelming but you have to be hospitable to your guests and at least let them know that you will serve them shortly.  Once she finally greeted me she took my order of a slice of Oreo cheesecake and then I waited 15 minutes for it. During the last 5 minutes I saw my slice in the To-GO box on the counter with a receipt on it, just waiting to be put into a bag. I finally got my slice of cheesecake and walked out.  I'm not expecting excellent service from a chain restaurant but I at least want to be treated like a guest. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 4 years, I just find it disappointing because I would never be rude like that to a customer. -Nick"
Kim R.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",108,69,21,2.0,2/12/2017,"Sat at the bar for brunch today. Georgia peach blended cocktails were on point.  I ordered the ""giant Belgian waffle"" with bells and whistles, i.e. Strawberries pecans and ""Chantilly cream""... aka whipped cream, insert eye roll. Friend ordered eggs Benedict with sweet potato home fries. So giant Belgian waffle sounds awesome right? So wrong, I typically am not a harsh critic but this waffle looked so sad. It wasn't crispy, had zero pecans, and some of the worst looking I guess Chantilly cream I've ever seen... plate was dirty. Just unappealing I was too hungry to complain or take a crappy pic. Eggs Benedict... hard poached eggs like just unacceptable. No runny yolk..no.  The bar service was decent and polite.  Definitely the most disappointed I have ever been at cheesecake. Boo"
S W.,"Manhattan, NY",44,66,63,1.0,7/22/2016,Terrible terrible service!!!  Came here 10 years ago and had a bad experience and tried it again today and the same thing!!   Sat at a table outside.  The food came and it took at least 10 minutes to get utensils and napkins.  Our food sat there while we had to ask the waiter twice.  Took about 20 minutes to get the check and had to ask twice again.   Ended up going to the front to ask for the check.  Terrible terrible service
Lee C.,"Cranford, NJ",96,179,827,4.0,9/10/2016,"We have been here a few times before and you always know what you're going to get here. Very consistent. Huge menu with dozens of options. Service today was excellent- ""Catherine J"" was our serve . I just wish this place was not as noisy and had a little better lighting. Having less than a 45 minute wait would also help but again, it is a Saturday night. We also like the free bread they offer before the meal."
Denise D.,"East Hanover, NJ",0,2,,1.0,1/10/2017,"What is going on with the Cheesecake Factory???  My friends and I have been coming here for years and it's always been excellent.  NOT TONIGHT!  The bar doesn't have ingredients for drinks,  and the mixed drinks that were finally served,  were filled with mixers and very little alcohol.  Also the kitchen is sold out of standard ingredients.  Luckily the manager came over to apologize and try to fix the drink problems. Let's see how it goes. To continue the sad dinner story,  the servers twice brought us the wrong food.  The manager replaced two of the bad drinks with more bad drinks.  We received three dessert folks for four people.  And nothing was comped on the check.  Not even our birthday girls dessert.   I used to recommend this restaurant,  not after tonight."
Frank B.,"Fords, NJ",37,114,,1.0,7/10/2017,went the other night with my wife...i have a gluten allergy and ordered the farfalle with chicken and garlic sauce....it was so bland i didn't even bother finishing it....it used to be so good but something changed and will never order that again... my wife ordered the buffalo blasts as her meal....they were so salty she could not get past two bites....yes they took it off the bill but that was it....customer service was lacking... in addition there were 10 tables lined up that were all open yet they put us on the end where the servers hang out and we got to listen to all the gossip and all their complaining.... thanks but no thanks....will not be back again.....
Sara H.,"Englewood, NJ",12,205,740,3.0,2/28/2016,"After few hours of shopping in the menlo mall, my friends and I wanted something cheesy. We ended up visiting cheesecake factory to grab some fancy pizza and some spaghetti.  Although it was Friday night, we were seated fairly quickly. Unfortunately, there wasn't anyhing in particular to recall about the service. Just as any other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants: various selection of food choices are available. They have a huge portion, so dont over-order! We ordered one pan of pizza, spaghetti, and a avocado -containing appetizer. Overall the foods tasted great. Giant in portion, and a great flavor! However,  I wish the foods were served bit warmer. The foods didn't seem like it was cooked/served right away. Maybe our foods were placed in the kitchen for a while? Other than foods not being served ""warm,"" we had a decent dinner."
A B.,"Colonia, NJ",264,22,33,2.0,11/7/2017,"Well, I'm back on another disappointing  cheescake factoy experience. Yesterday, my cousin's brought me to celebrate my Birthday. Our waiter... can't remember his name.. was great. Was listening to our conversations... agreeing with what's good.. what's bad. We liked him. However, when our dessert came, everything went downhill. He brought out a Chris's Outrageous cheesecake. It was definitely delicious until i ate wax/plastic. Supposedly, they use some type of wax to separate the cheesecake on their platter. Well, there was a long strand mixed into the bite I took. When showed to him, he explained what it was and that he would get the manager. No manager came. We atleast thought that it would be taken off the bill... nope. We didn't make a fuss or anything as the lights were turned on and it just seemed like they were waiting for us to leave. But it all comes back to how I really don't like coming to cheesecake factory. I don't blame the waiter at all because he was good and friendly. I blame the management and their consistency with ruining experiences for people."
