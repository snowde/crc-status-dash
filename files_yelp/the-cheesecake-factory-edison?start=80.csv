Melissa L.,"Sewaren, Sewaren, NJ",56,6,,1.0,5/16/2017,"Used to love this place. My family and I made reservations for Mother's Day brunch.  What a terrible idea!  ALL of our food came out ice cold. There were 8 of us.  My brothers waffles were burnt, but cold and his bacon was underdone. Mine and my sisters eggs for my eggs Benedict were Ray.  My mother and father couldn't get past how cold their food was so they couldn't even eat it. To be completely honest, most of the food was inedible.  Unfortunately, we will not be back. :-("
Rhonda D.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",0,21,2,3.0,7/20/2017,"I had the ""Beet and Goat Cheese"" salad, which was delicious,  just missing beets and goat cheese.  It is basically a plate of Arugula with a few pieces of beet and a few miniscule dabs of goat cheese.  It should be called an Arugula salad with beets and goat cheese."
Michealene R.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",0,4,,2.0,6/22/2017,Service is failing big time! In the beginning it was a great place to go ..now forget it..you can go any where for lousy service ..seems like no one cares any more
Jeff S.,"Northampton, PA",9,17,9,2.0,7/3/2017,"Every Cheesecake Factory that i have ever been in, i have loved. Not this one. Foid is good as usual... service was absolutely ATROCIOUS! Our waitress didn't even come to the table unit 15 minutes after we were sat. It only worsened from there..I asked to speak to the manager...waited 20 minutes..never came over.. says a lot!"
Nina S.,"Hillside, NJ",0,4,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I would certainly give this establishment 0 stars but the lowest I'm allowed to select is 1. We walked into this place at 12:30 and were promptly seated by a manager. We thought ""wow! great no waiting"". Guess again! We then waited and waited for the server who was less than thrilled to be working that day to ""serve"" us. To make a long story short we were never offered bread, we had to ask for it... our food never came out after 30 minutes of waiting.. the server never even bothered to stop by to even suggest when the food would be coming out nor did she apologize for the delay when we asked her where the food was. Instead the server walked away from our table without even saying a word. I would recommend that this young lady learn some common courtesy, you get tipped based upon your attentiveness! The manager was very apologetic but by the time we got to speak to him we were over this and headed out the door. Save yourself the over priced meal and the crappy attitudes from their servers."
Jana S.,"Union, NJ",5,7,,1.0,5/31/2017,"This place is horrible. We went here for my birthday and it will be the last time that I will eat here. The staff here don't seem to know how to keep things clean! Okay so first of all, they make you wait 30-45 mins to get seated. I don't really mind that because I am very patient and I know they are packed especially on the weekends. Anyway, when they finally got us to the table, the table and seats were still wet. So we told the receptionist that the table was still wet and she called the cleaning staff to wipe it dry. The unhappy cleaning staff took a dirty cloth (with stains and all) hanging from his apron and wiped the table, then the seats THEN THE TABLE AGAIN. The table was still wet. Obviously he was rushing with all the other tables he has to clean. Then he took the utensils out from his apron pocket and started laying it down on the WET table which he wiped by his DIRTY towel. Then he left. So we gathered all the utensils (that time we noticed some chunks of food on the utensils too which was gross), put them on one side and when the server came, we asked for new utensils. So she got us new ones and I told her not to lay it on the table and get us napkins. She did what we asked but the second set of utensils were still dirty. It also had some pieces of food in between the forks. So we  returned only those that looked dirty and asked for replacements. I wanted to leave but my family was already hungry and it was late so I said okay give them another chance but one more mistake from them and we will walk out. Good thing our server was too good (too good for that place) that she made the rest of our time there okay. The whole time I was paranoid about how my food was prepared and if it was clean. But upon visual inspection, it seemed okay. We didn't get tummy aches after so I guess food was clean or we just have tough guts. I just hope they improve the way they sanitize their tables and utensils and at least wrap their utensils in napkins before they put it on the tables. It's so disgusting. It's disappointing that a reputable establishment doesn't know how to keep things clean. So never again cheesecake factory."
Jincy V.,"Old Bridge, NJ",1,10,10,1.0,6/30/2017,I usually love going here and have been a long time customer but NOT anymore. Took a bite out of their happy hour Burger and PULLED out a strand of long black hair from my mouth. The hair strand was mixed in the actual burger meat. I spit it out and lost my appetite completely. The GM and shift manager didn't offer any incentive to return for future services but instead  just gave a typical apology and we had to pay for our drinks. All we ordered were 2 burgers and he took that off the check but good customer service would've covered the ENTIRE check and offered an incentive to come back for future visits. Poor customer service I think. Will definitely not be returning even though I did love that place initially.
Ali Z.,"Edison, NJ",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2017,My waitress was black and she was being racist against me and my family my mother who has  a headscarf  asked for olive oil with the bread and since then the waitress started acting rude I am so close to walking out of this restaurant
Mai L.,"Sayreville, NJ",126,2,1,5.0,8/5/2017,"I don't live to far from the Cheesecake Factory and so my friend and I come here every Saturday night. We request Santino, he's the absolute best waiter we've had! He remembers our order and how we like our water/coffee and bread. He's so nice and will get you anything. If you had a bad experience here, I recommend you coming back and ask for Santino. You won't regret it"
Robbie P.,"Manville, NJ",23,33,3,1.0,5/6/2017,"Not a good location. This place isn't run well. It was so noisy inside with kids running around. I was told there was going to be a 10 minute wait, then 20 minutes later as im waiting I saw a couple who came in after us being seated. Being offended by this I gave my buzzer back to the hostess and decided to grab cake to go. I placed my order and it took 15 minutes just to get one slice togo. They took everybody's order before serving anybody so I had to wait for ten people to order before anyone even started handing out the food. The cake is not worth waiting for a half hour. And I would not return here after being pushed down on the waiting list like that. This was my first time at cheesecake factory and probably my last."
Betty L.,"New York, NY",29,23,30,4.0,6/1/2016,"Man I love this place. The interior decoration is so nice. And there's that upside down cheesecake decor above the front desk too.  I'm glad I got here when it wasn't too packed. Wait time was less than 20 minutes. Our server was really courteous. I also love the bread there. My boyfriend and I ordered the coconut curry rice and jambalaya pasta. We were given a big portion each so definitely worth the money. Not too loud for a place that has a ton of customers either. Now about dessert. We ordered the strawberry shortcake because my boyfriend isn't a huge fan of cheesecake. It was quite disappointing - the cake part tasted pretty stale so we just picked out the vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Honestly though, the cheesecake probably would've been better because that's what they specialize in, but oh wells! I just wish the non-cheesecake desserts are on par as well. That's the only reason why I took a star off."
Sage J.,"Woodbridge, NJ",3,34,36,5.0,1/8/2017,"I really like this place, always good service from the servers & the food is always sooo good! Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp is bomb, love it"
Irena E.,"Cranford, NJ",0,2,,1.0,7/9/2017,"SHAME on you The Cheesecake Factory, we hair left and the manager on duty tonight who decided at my damn birthday dinner they couldn't comp my sisters meal after as a VEGETARIAN, there was a chunk of PORK in her cauliflower steak vegetarian dinner!!!! He goes oh my god so sorry let me get you something else and then charged us $20 for it and refused to take it off. Disgusting. Never in my life. They should be ashamed!!!"
Lilia S.,"Linden, NJ",11,89,141,5.0,11/13/2016,I'm coming here for a few years. I was never disappointed with food. Always fresh and delicious. Worth waiting 20-40 minutes for a table. The waiters are friendly and very well informed about the served dishes.
Gizelle S.,"Edison, NJ",46,9,2,1.0,3/19/2017,"Who doesn't love this place! Anything you want to eat is on the menu. Unfortunately curbside orders are a bit of a disaster. So next time I'm craving white chicken chilli, I'll just dine in. They simply don't have their to go act together. After the wait, confusion I went in to get it and left with cold food. Not worth the aggravation"
Sonia A.,"Linden, NJ",0,2,,2.0,10/8/2017,This place used to be my favorite until we had dinner one night and saw a roach crawling on our table and quickly dissapeared in between the booths. It's so dark in there that they come out of hiding. We quickly told the waiter and we asked to be moved outside. We were so disgusted that when the food came we didn't even eat it. It's a shame because we love the food. Now we have to be worried about bringing those bugs home. I'm sure it could happen anywhere. This place will never be the same again.
Carlos D.,"Iselin, Woodbridge Township, NJ",12,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I wish I can give them 0 stars! Had a horrible experience with my family. If you don't like waiting 40 minutes for your meal, or having the rude  waitress rolling her eyes at you because you asked if the food was coming soon, don't go to this restaurant!! It's the worst! Horrible waitress she was rude and never even came once to ask if we needed anything and told the manager we where waiting for our food only for 35 minutes not 40. Horrible place, don't waste your money or time!"
G B.,"Kenilworth, NJ",12,674,4853,5.0,9/2/2017,still one of my fav chain restaurants. we had great service and the food is always good. i had the chicken littles. i love it! chicken is fresh and i love the mashed potatoes and corn!
Tania B.,"Edison, NJ",0,18,,3.0,5/29/2017,A good everyday place to go too ...  lots of variety which I like and enjoy but the wait is always long for the weekends  The cheesecake are definitely awesome  The staff is nice as well
Jennifer S.,"Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico",1,1,,1.0,9/28/2017,"Was there yesterday night. Sat in middle booth and had roaches crawling on the table and against the wall/booth. Gross! Never going back. Manager said they can't control what people bring in to the restaurant. Wow! Really? Blame it on customers. We refused to pay a dime after finding roaches crawling at our tables, yes tables, they moved us over to the next booth and saw another one."
