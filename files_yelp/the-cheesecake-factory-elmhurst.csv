Liam C.,"New York, NY",175,137,216,3.0,12/12/2017,"The thing with the Cheesecake Factory is that they know no matter what, people will still come here, likely myself included although in recent years the crazy wait times has made me steer very clear of coming here. Â This location opened last year when I was still living nearby and back then, it wasn't unusual to have 2+ hour wait times for a table for two. These days, things have slowed down a bit but the wait times are often still bizarre.  So why despite everyone's love for chain restaurants, do I want to write a review? It actually came down to one instance. While I feel I've always had a 3/5 star experience (not just this Cheesecake Factory, but every Cheesecake Factory location), given the long wait time, servers in the past forgetting to bring silverware, coming back to tell me multiple times what I ordered is unavailable, etc, I came here recently ahead of my larger party to put my name down for a table and was told 20 minutes despite the restaurant being pretty empty. My party came in soon after through a different door and didn't see me already waiting and asked for a table as well and they were seated immediately. (WHAT?!) I don't understand why I was told to wait by one hostess when another hostess sat the same party immediately. This makes me think that the wait times are often disproportionately exaggerated and you want us to wait just for the sake of waiting. The food is good and the cheesecake is obviously what we all come for, but I'm going to be skeptical of these alleged wait times now for sure."
Wei H.,"Flushing, NY",64,90,213,1.0,1/9/2018,"Came here tonight for a celebration dinner. Upon walking in the place looked huge and well done, but the seating(booth) and broken tables became a dead give away that this Cheesecake Factory will be a disappointment. We were quickly seated by one of the nicest waiter who quickly bought some water and bread for us. After spending 5-10mins browsing through the menu, we decided on: 1. Beetroot goat cheese salad 2. Guacamole and chips  3. Factory meatloaf  4. Seared ani tuna Pros:  Beetroot and goat cheese salad was amazing  Cons:  1. Old chips, guacamole was poorly seasoned  2. Meatloaf had sauce that tasted super artificial and was extremely sweet 3. Ani tuna was a complete scam! I got served 5 pieces of see through tuna placed on top of 2 cups of brown rice for $21!! If your out of tuna then do not say you have it. Those 5 pieces added together equals to one slice of tuna sashimi  Overall this place did not meet my expectations at all. The one in Long Island is much better, great service, and properly prepared food!"
Lilian Y.,"Sunnyside, NY",158,180,34,1.0,12/29/2017,"Check my Yelp profile-- I rarely ever give any restaurant a 1 star but this Queens Center Mall location is the exception. I am beyond upset with the manager at this establishment. I was seated promptly and then told by the hostess that I ""took a table that wasn't mine"" after she called me, took my buzzer, sat me at the table and distributed the menu to my party. She said there was a party of 7 ahead of me that our table was originally meant for them and I calmly told her I will not get up as this was an error on their part and we are already seated and I'd be happy to discuss this with a manager, thinking that a manager--- you know a well trained staff member in customer service would see this as an opportunity to quickly resolve a small issue. The manager who came up to me did not want to disclose her name to me but she was a woman with dark brown shoulder length hair. She was automatically defensive and condescending telling me that I should have known the table was not mine if my buzzer wasn't vibrating and as soon as I responded with, ""well if that's the case, the fault is on the hostess who is an employee and trained to know the buzzer should have been vibrating when she received it from my hands and proceeded to sit our party at the table."" I didn't even finish my sentence when she literally walked away from me!! Everyone at my table was shocked that this was a ""manager"". The worse part is that this was my birthday dinner (which I somehow managed to tell her before she left me mid-sentence).  The only reason I stayed was because the server was mortified, she came over to our table to apologize on behalf of the managers behavior. She listened to me, told me she didn't really know what to do but she'll bring us some water in the meantime. I appreciated her validation that this was totally crazy. I even asked her to call the manger back so we can finish our conversation and I literally watched her go back and the manager refused to come back to our table. She made our server wait 20 minutes before taking our order but in the mean time our server brought us bread and refilled our drinks as needed. I will say this again, the server ELENA was amazing and if it wasn't for her we would have left with my Birthday dinner completely ruined.  I will be sharing this review on every forum and Cheesecake contact because this ""manager"" who refused to give me her name and tried to refuse me service should not have a job much less a title as a manager."
Alex F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",2,20,12,1.0,12/27/2017,The most terrible Cheesecake Factory I have ever been made me wait 2 hours to be seated when they told me 1 hour. Spaghetti wasn't even cooked it was row! When I called manager and asked him will he eat that. He replied Never!
jackeline v.,"Manhattan, NY",83,78,264,4.0,10/5/2017,"Pretty friendly staff. Wait times are predicted once you enter the restaurant, and you choose if you want to stay or go. Service was too fast, and the busboy brought our main course when I had just received my app, and he had to take it back. Waiter was kind enough to have chef make a new one...(or so he said!). Anyways. Prices are decent, and portions are huge.  They have a pretty decent HH as well, so if in the area and in the mood for some unhealthy apps and drinks, def pass by!"
Khaye P.,"Forest Hills, NY",30,6,36,1.0,11/25/2017,I am so disappointed with the cake I bought today... You guys are cheating your customers why are you putting a good nice cake on your cake display and the one you are giving your customers is not the exact same thing. that is CHEATING!!!! And not really nice... You were charging way too much for a piece of crap! So disappointed and very mad! I will never ever buy from your restaurant anymore never ever and I will tell my friends of my bad experience so they won't experience the same thing. This is like an old cake not worth the money you paid for if I could put a zero star that's what I'm going to do right now.... I usually put a good review for a restaurant but this time it's a different thing. CHEATERS!!!!
Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",298,185,195,4.0,11/27/2017,"Just had a feeling of eating something disgusting, and getting all my calories for the day in one meal so came to the cheesecake factory. We had to wait an hour, but we just wandered around the mall for a bit before coming back.  Pretty standard cheesecake factory fare here. The bread was warm and amazing. Beers are ~$7 here. We got the spinach and crab dip, and it was delicious. I ended up getting the truffle honey fried chicken. Very moist and had a great flavor.  The thing that separates this from the other cheesecake factories is the service. I came here twice and both times I was greeted with exceptional kindness. Our drinks were never empty, and we were always checked up on."
Melanie R.,"Corona, NY",25,75,127,1.0,8/28/2017,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE TAKE-OUT Came here on a Monday night at 5:30pm. I ordered a pasta carbonara without chicken ($16.50) and a slice of cheesecake (7.95). It took about 20 minutes for me to get my order. When I got home I found that there was barely any sauce on my pasta. WHERE IS THE SAUCE? (See picture below) It was so bland and dry. I used to love their carbonara but I didn't expect to receive this kind of treatment when ordering take-out.  The lady who helped me was extremely rude and probably hated her job. I couldn't decide between cheesecakes and I ended up wanting a different one after placing an order. When I asked to change, (the cheesecake was the same price) she rolled her eyes at me, changed the order and handed me the cheesecake without even properly bagging it. I'm sorry did I offend you? Please take your misery out somewhere else. Disgusting."
Jane L.,"Queens, NY",395,506,1253,1.0,8/16/2017,"One star is on this experience and the food preparation Wait staff service and General Manager response was a 3 star.  My golf buddy is a Cheesecake Factory fan and goes to the one out in White Plains and wanted to try this one. I been here like when it first opened 9 months ago and so much has changed. No lines at all on a Sunday at 12 PM? The place was relatively empty. It was not busy at all and no wait time whatsoever. The hostess sat us in a small table for two and we wanted a booth. She found us another table which was a booth by the entrance to the bathroom. **Tip #1**-Watch out walking towards the bathroom for it is very slippery. Walk slow do not run.  Couple of things happened which is why I gave this place a One star. My friend ordered the Bruleed French Toast which came out hot on the outside but the inside was cold. Was it just reheated or left over from the day before? The waitress was really good and said she will get another one. It took a while for the order to come cause it was being prepared. The other Bruleed French Toast look like it was freshly made and had sprinkled powder. I ordered the French Chicken & Waffles Benedict. There was a piece of hair. I am mortified. Then flagged down the waitress and she was busy with other tables for her area was busy. She looked at me and said it was being prepared. Did not come over from the other table. Guess she coming over when the food was ready to brought over to the table. So I waited till she came over with the French Toast. Informed her about the hair, she went to get the General Manager who apologized that these type of things do happen. Said that they can make another one or I can order something else. I lost my appetite after that and stuck with coffee and water. Even heard plates dropping and stuff smashing at the kitchen which made me think of not getting anything. The waitress came back and asked if I wanted a piece of cake and I said no Thank You. Maybe I watch too much Hell's Kitchen and you would imagine they would check every plate before it goes out to the table. **Tip #2**- Regarding you bill. They will post a suggested tip amount. BEWARE- Read carefully. The Tip is added to the whole bill after taxes. It is not on the food/drink bill alone.  Will not be back again. The novelty of this place has worn off after 9 months."
Tara M.,"Queens, NY",66,127,1241,4.0,11/9/2017,"Im not usually a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I'm a sucker for this place. Lots of choices in terms of appetizers, mains, drinks, and desserts, pretty good food, and yummy cheesecake! The wait can be obscene during peak times (think weekends, holidays), and their waiting system leaves something to be desired compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations, but the bartenders and waitstaff are actually super attentive, friendly, and professional, which is awesome. This is a much-needed addition to the Queens Center Mall!"
Shani A.,"Brooklyn, NY",251,95,330,3.0,10/22/2017,"I would start by saying that I'm addicted to their avocado egg roll , bread and banana cheese cake butttt and there's a big but , this place is crowdy , noisy , the dishes are not that clean at all , but I understand why so many people love coming here , the prices are honest , the portions are huge but it really bothers me that you can barley hear yourself ."
Millie R.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,135,497,4.0,7/29/2017,"I don't often do chain restaurants but there is something I really like about the Cheesecake Factory perhaps, it's the plethora of desserts, noooo the food is pretty decent too, and usually the dishes are so grand that you will have leftover for lunch the next day. You definitely will get your monies worth.  This time we arrived during happy hour, oh what a way to unwind with half price apps and delicious cocktails. I believe happy hour is from 4-7 don't quote me on the exact time. My husband and I were actually hungry so we kept our appetizer basic. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread that was paired with seasoned olive oil and marinara sauce. It had a Â perfect crunchy yet chewy texture. We had cocktails as well, the cosmopolitan here is on point so is the mojito. Shout out to whoever is the mixologist.  Following our dishes arrival, my husband had the taco meal that was accompanied by rice and beans.  I had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and I swapped out the angel hair pasta for linguini. It was not bad it was a mixed linguini, I believe It was a basil mixture.  The staff is attentive and sweet.  We were so full, we opted out of dessert. Now that's crazy, no cheesecake, maybe next time cheesecake to go."
Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,937,15249,4.0,10/2/2017,"Time to update my review for Cheesecake Factory. I always said when I die sprinkle my ashes over Cheesecake Factory. I changed my mind. I decided on a Green Burial instead. I'm digressing!  First: Going to Sunday Brunch was on our bucket list for years. I'm certainly glad they decided to offer it on Saturday too. Not that a weekend trip either day to this mall is enjoyable. The train ride is always over an hour these days. That being said, my daughter is happy she can have the brunch menu at Lunchtime. I'll stick with the lunch menu. Brunch is 10-2 Saturday and Sunday now.  Second: Service has greatly improved. We were greeted at the reception by a lovely young lady with a beautiful smile on her face. After quickly being escorted to our table, within minutes our server was at our ready. She also was lovely and smiling in addition to friendly. I finally felt welcome and at home at this location like I had at other locations! I think they finally got the CCF vibe down on their customer service! Third: Food preparation was timely. The food came out hot and portions are huge as always. I am always on the hunt for a decent pancake. Forget CCF on that one. I really wolfed them down. Some bites were light and fluffy while others were thick and heavy. I didn't know it was poor blending of the Ricotta into the batter until my Yelp Friend told me. Oh well. I'm not lowering my stars this review because I was the one that made poor food and drink choices this visit! Â I'll know better next time! My daughter was really pleased with her meal. Naturally she had enough to take half home. She has self control that I lack!! She had Chicken and Waffles. She said the Chicken and the Waffles has a very nice taste. The potatoes were just the way she likes them. Drinks rated poor on my daughter's side. She didn't like her ice tea. She said it was weak. I made another poor choice. I had a Strawberry Smoothie. I thought I had gotten it before. I may have had a Strawberry Frozen Daiquiri without liquor. This smoothie was more like having desert. Very filling. I couldn't get cheesecake after that. I wasn't in the mood to take it home. Maybe if my daughter had split her piece. Fat chance!  Finally: They do have good perks some times. We had a coupon from our last visit good for a free piece of cheesecake when you spend $30. My daughter wanted to try what I had last visit. She got Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme to go. With her will power she'll eat it a little every day all week. I need to learn to be that good!  Conclusion and recommendations: They are getting their act together at this CCF location. The food preparation is still hit or miss. I've missed out two out of three meals so far. Remember my burnt Cuban Sandwich? I'm going to keep going. Maybe no more frequently than once a month. Preferably on a weekday for lunch!  If you're as big a fan of their cheesecake as I am, you will enjoy. I'm really there for the cheesecake!  And a word of warning: Don't look at the calories on the different cheesecake flavors. Forget any of the regular menu items calories too for that matter! I may stick with the Skinnylicious Menu now."
Tyler L.,"New York, NY",333,840,1147,3.0,10/10/2017,"This place opened last year near me. Decided to finally try this place since I had never been to one. The menu is very large and is basically a mix of American, Mexican and Asian inspired dishes - stuff like grilled steak tacos, thai coconut-lime chicken, and eggplant parmesan. All in all, it is not much different in variety or quality than you would find in other big chains like Applebee's or Friendly's. The two big positives I would give Cheesecake is that they have a much nicer atmosphere. They are super clean, have super high ceilings and spacious seating with booths. The portions of the food are very large as well too."
JiHae L.,"Sunnyside, NY",78,80,279,2.0,7/11/2017,"Went at a strange time to have a lunch/dinner. Â Not sure why the service was so bad. The waitstaff decided to keep switching off. We were like uh whose our waitor or waitress?? We didnt know who to ask for our bill or water.  First off when we got served our bread they forgot a plate. I had to ask twice since I had to ask different servers. Once again wish they would've stuck with one person.  We ordered a lunch special which was huge which I'm not complaining about, but my friend ordered the combo platter which was tiny compared to my lunch special. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my friend ordered the Steak Diane Scampi Combo. For dessert we ordered the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. The food was good, but took forever for us to get our food. The portion size didnt make sense. Not sure, I would go back since the service is so bad. It was also, strange how they decided to sit all the Asians together. Felt like we were segregated. It seems suspicious."
Tonya J.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",69,338,4501,3.0,5/14/2017,"I never thought I'd see the day I give Cheesecake Factory less than 5 stars of glory. However this location is barely 3 stars.  They fail on food mainly and end results in service 2nd to that! I can't understand how the menu offerings are the same across most locations and yet they fail! But fail they do here easily. If you've ever experienced other locations you would totally get what I'm saying once you've dined here. Both my family and I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory as a franchisee no matter the locations usually but somehow that one team one dream action plan doesn't come in to play at this location. While the dishes we ordered weren't the worst they failed to be the very best, maybe I should've never veered from what was tried and true but that really shouldn't ever be the case! The Mac~n~cheese balls in my opinion were God awful, fried hot on the outside but luke warm Â on the inside and sitting in a disgustingly sweet base that had the consistency and taste of Chef Boyardee sauce from the 70's early 80's. Yet our server swore this was the best. What a bold lie as I completely disagree these are clearly the worst thing you could order from here, those are my thoughts.  Other dishes were Ok. But again not great. I really feel the problem here are the cooks. My company ordered the pineapple chicken & shrimp dish which certainly sounds and looks tasty however something was just off tasting with a hint of spoilage in the dish.  My Seared Tuna dish was fresh and tasty so no complaints on this.  Tex-Mex egg rolls while fried hot sat in grease a bit too long, never experienced this before at any other location. Yuck. The cocktails were a standout among the menu as well as the Cheesecake variations which remain awesome. Your never going wrong with any of these.  The promised 2 hour parking validation that goes awry and never really comes to fruition since Â they harbor a faulty system and take no responsibility after having a detailed conservation with management all to no avail but for management to place blame on the parking facility for Queens center mall really left me disgusted! Management advises me to walk the entire length of the mall to get my parking validated for the 2 hour limit for having dined there because their card readers obviously aren't working properly after I had to return to advise them that the parking ticket isn't reflecting the validation.  How lame is that!  Truly the food wasn't cooked right, the servers aren't that great, management lacks resolution talent and the overall end result will leave you sorry for having come here. Best bet is to head out to Old Country Road in LI or any other location throughout the Tri-State area where you'll be completely satisfied and thoroughly pleased on every level for the parking, seating, service, quality of food and departure."
Susan C.,"New York, NY",46,166,554,3.0,6/4/2017,"Pros: friendly service, large portions, delicious cheesecake options Cons: ridiculous wait time, mediocre savory food, the number of calories posted on each cheesecake which is required by law, but certainly doesn't make me feel wonderful about eating them  At 3:30pm on a Saturday and the wait time was 1.5 hours. We expected the off-peak time would be less crowded but either everyone else thought that too or the lull between services doesn't exist at this Cheesecake Factory.  Being that the nostalgia of eating at other Cheesecake Factory locations in my college years overcame my normal sane conclusion of not waiting for over an hour for a table, I decided to walk around the mall for an hour before coming back to the restaurant to wait 20 more minutes. I felt a bit bad for the staff bc it seemed there was nothing they could do to alleviate the wait time, and as wait times progressed you could see impatience creeping into the faces of customers in line, reflected in the furtive hungry glances directed toward the host station.  Once we were seated the service was friendly and responsive, our waiter greeted us with a smile, explained the menu, and answered our questions. After we received our food, he checked in on us a couple times to ask how we were doing and if we were enjoying our meals. We ordered the jambalaya and a pasta and nibbled on the house bread before both entrees came out after about 20 minutes. The portion sizes were generous however I wasn't feeling any finesse in the flavors or technique. After dinner we didn't have much appetite for cheesecake, and for me the labels of 2000 calorie per slice left me a bit scared of a dessert I may have otherwise indulged in on a less full stomach. Because let's face it--the cheesecake here is pretty good. So at the end of the experience I left full but without a strong impression positive or negative."
TylerRose A.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",29,26,16,1.0,9/30/2017,"I'll start by saying the staff was fine. The woman at the desk who took our name and gave us our vibrator thingy was efficient and cordial. But the system for seating people is cluttered and inefficient. She took our pager and told us to wait around the other side of the huge column, which is a convergence of people coming to the door to leave and had us feeling like we were in the way. It's far too loud. My husband and I could not talk without shouting. We're getting old. We don't like to shout at one another to have a simple conversation. It's also way too dim. I almost couldn't read the menu, which seriously needs to be edited. Cut out 150 items and do the other 100 well. Our waiter, while service was slow, was polite and answered my questions about the Blood Orange Martini. The drink was between $12 and $14...but you only got the drink in the glass. You are not served the shaker with another drink and a half, like you get at Applebee's for about the same price. So I laughed and did not get anything more than a soda.  But we never got water. Do they not bring it automatically? Were we supposed to ask for it? We decided to try the truffle bacon cheese sticks. Basically, it's a grilled cheese with bacon that is cut into four strips. I couldn't tell you what the cheese was because it had no flavor. The bacon was the only part of it that did have flavor, though it was toasted nicely. The tomato dipping sauce tasted like straight tomato paste. Not even cooked tomato paste. And it was unseasoned. Tasted like it came directly out of the can with nothing done to it. Some restaurants don't understand that tomato paste needs to be cooked to get rid of that canned paste flavor. I had one stick out of four and a small taste of the tomato paste. I ordered the Carne Asada Steak Medallions, ""Covered with Sauteed Peppers, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Creamy Ranchero Sauce, Fresh Corn and White Rice"" the menu says. Well, the peppers and onions need to go another four or five minutes to begin to be called sauteed. They were warmed but largely still crisp and uncooked. I also found a mushroom slice. So it's a good thing my mother wasn't with us and didn't get that plate, because she's allergic to them. That's careless prep.  My rice was dry as a bone and CRUSTY. The corn was there. It had these salty bits of what I imagine is a queso. The steak itself is underseasoned but the sauce with it had this mysterious heat to it. No real flavor to speak of. Just heat. It went away quickly with a bite of the bread that had been brought at the beginning of the meal. There's always this quandry when you order steak at a place you've never been before. Do I order it medium and hope they go under and I get it rare? Or will they overcook and it comes to me well and I have to send it back? Do I order it rare and maybe they go over to a medium, which I can usually deal with, or will they under and I get it blue? Well, I took the risk. I ordered rare. I got blue.I actually had to get out my phone's flashlight to see just how blue it was. I should have sent it back, but I do enjoy a well-prepared rare/very rare steak sometimes.  I'm now regretting NOT sending it back, as supper has not been sitting well ever since (for either of us). From my entire entree plate, I ate the meat, a couple bites of corn, and one single bite of rice. I almost stopped at Burger King on my way home, but my stomach has been so upset I just came home and popped an antacid. I did tell the waiter about the rice when he picked up my plate. He took $4 off the entree, which I do appreciate. My husband ordered the orange chicken. His rice was also bone dry. The vegetables on his plate were barely past warmed, not much cooked. The chicken itself was not a crisp deep fry. The sauce was not spicy, as the menu describes, and there was this odd flavor on the back end of a bite. Like grated, burnt orange peel. It wasn't very pleasant. Panda Express in the food court does a MUCH better and FAR MORE REASONABLY PRICED orange chicken. They also have much better rice. The table next to us, who had been seated, with alcoholic beverages AND water before us, were brought their entrees after ours, btw, so I hope they weren't upset about that. A very serious suggestion for the restaurant: Make miniature versions of your desserts and offer a ""Flight"" of 3 or 5 flavors, so that customers can have a taste of several desserts. I seriously counted 17 different desserts I wanted to try. If I could get a flight of five and my husband could get a flight of five, that's ten desserts we both could share and try. We settled on the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. That was seriously the best part of the meal other than the bread at the beginning. The toasted meringue on top was quite tasty. It's not a sickly sweet lemon, but a nice, tart lemon. It was terrific, and the reason our trip gets one star and not a ""wish I could give half a star"" notation."
Catherine S.,"SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, NY",14,87,8,1.0,4/9/2017,"My family and I came here on Sunday to celebrate my cousin's 20th birthday. We ordered brunch and waited over an hour for our food!  We ordered French toast and waffles, all which were delivered with no butter or maple syrup. Instead, we were given Smucker's sugar free syrup in a take-out container which was cold (picture included). My cousin, who ordered chicken and waffles, was only given HALF a waffle. To thwart this discovery, they placed some over fried potatoes in the space from the partial waffle.  We requested a manager and Eric came over to the table. He heard us but did not listen. He promised maple syrups but thirty minutes and a withered waffle later we were informed that there was no maple syrup. My cousin also never received a complete waffle.  My aunt and cousins did enjoy the cucumber lemonade. Pedro was also a very pleasant waiter who made up for the lackluster management.  It's also worth mentioning that after waiting thirty/forty minutes for syrup and being told they did not have any, we saw a waiter walk past with a searing cup of syrup.  Nevertheless, we won't be celebrating another birthday here and unless you are on the mood for drama that makes you leave hungry, I suggest you also avoid dining here at all costs!"
Marcin G.,"Queens, NY",35,87,305,1.0,9/2/2017,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love cheesecake. So it's a no brainer that I like The Cheesecake Factory. I've had the pleasure of going to several different Cheesecake Factories now, and for the most part, it's been a pleasant experience overall. However, it's so sad to say, that this specific Cheesecake Factory, one that just opened a few months ago, failed on so many levels.  Upon arriving, we were promptly seated, and IMMEDIATELY approached by the waiter asking if we wanted anything to drink. We didn't even have a chance to put down our phones yet, forget even looking at the menu. We ordered some basic drinks. It took quite some time for the waiter to return with the drinks, at which point we were ready to order. We ordered the Truffle Bacon Grilled Cheeses for appetizer and Fish & Chips / Cuban Sandwich for entree. At some point, the waiter came up to the table, grabbed my half empty lemonade and walked away without saying a word. Came back 10 minutes later with a full cup. Appreciate the service, but why take my unfinished cup, and make me wait 10 minutes without saying a word? The appetizers came out about 20 minutes after placing the order. Nothing special about it, but it was the best part of the meal. About another 30 minutes later, the entrees came out. We asked for new utensils (because the ones provided were not properly cleaned), but the server never returned with ones. The food was disappointing. Barely seasoned, and felt like they were sitting on the counter some time before being brought out, as they felt just warm.  The table next to us wasn't pleased with their experience either. Additionally, when they asked for their check, the waiter brought them an empty check holder, he forgot to put the check in it.  Service was non existent. No welcome, no small talk, just what do you want and here's your check.  Very disappointing from The Cheesecake Factory and from a newly opened restaurant. Won't be back."
Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",500,332,1619,4.0,3/26/2017,"I for the longest time believed that this restaurant was only for cheesecake!  The ambiance and the decor is pretty upscale and pretty well done.   They not only have some great itens for lunch and dinner but they also have a skinny menu for those who are watching their calorie intake.  The regular menu and the skinny menu have the calories listed next to all items and that made me really happy as i can be aware of what i am ordering.  They also have some great drink options like mojitos with different flavors and skinny drinks as well. Just be aware of the bottles of beer as they do not serve them very cold, if you are a beer drinker that can be a bit upseting.  We had items from the skinny menu, i had a flat bread and a salad, the flat bread was amazing and only 280 calories. As the salad was a little more caloric 400 cal but it was great and it had some oriental inspired dressing that made the dish that more special.  We went all the way on the skinny mojitos and they were great! I had a couple cause i couldnt stope as they were so yummy. For dessert we had to have one of the cheesecakes, we shared the banana cheesecake and 3 ppl could share one slice with no problems, so if you have a couple of good friends sharing is not a bad idea it is plenty for everyone.  The prices can be sneaky so be aware of the prices if you are on a budget.  I will definetly come back here for more cheesecakes and yummy skinny food. They portions are pretty fair for the price, the cheesecake options are endless, just be careful with the drinks as their prices can jack up the bill."
Dimple K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",56,103,4,1.0,8/10/2017,"I've been here quite a few times and each time it has downgraded. But today has got to the be the worst experience I've ever had here. I ordered their Louisiana Pasta. The noodles were not even al dente. They were freaking raw.  I had the Chinese chicken salad. I could taste the dirt/ sand in the salad. They are not washing their lettuce good enough! So upsetting! I also ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta with no peas, guess what there were peas. I had to send it back. I also ordered the margarita with less ice. The whole cup was filled with 3/4 ice. My server had way too many tables to keep track of. I felt bad for him. This place needs to be well staffed. It is impossible for one waiter to have 5-6 tables. One of the servers by the bar was really nice enough to cater to us thankfully. For a Thursday afternoon, this is unacceptable. I'll give some points for the waiters on trying, but poor guys are so understaffed and its so busy that your food will be fucked up."
Ashly S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,20,12,2.0,1/2/2018,"I'm giving 2 stars for the actual food there but the cheesecake was about a 4. I loved the cheesecake. I ordered a Smores cheesecake. The service is excellent very friendly staff. To start off they gave us water and 2 different kinds of bread. The whole wheat bread was great. I also had a coke. There were 3 of us so we had 3 appetizers to share. Factory nachos, fried mac n cheese balls and southern fried chicken sliders. So all of the food in general tasted like frozen food. Very greasy too. The mac n cheese was a little too cheesy and I couldn't eat more than half of one piece. The nachos were bad. It tasted very oily and the actual chips were deep fried. Horrible. The southern fried sliders were just okay. Did not come with any sauce and had a bad smell to it which put me off. It tasted ok but smelled like the chicken had been fried in fish oil. Now the cheesecake, Really good, nice chocolate taste and smooth. The graham crackers were great too. The wait time was 35 mins at least. But the staff was very nice and willing to answer my questions. They checked on us a few times too. These portions were huge for apps in my opinion."
Judy F.,"Forest Hills, NY",144,347,152,3.0,2/9/2017,"Came here at 10:30 am for Sunday brunch. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict. I asked them to scramble the eggs and put the Hollandaise sauce on the side. They got it right. I have full confidence in staff, I have no reason not to. Our hostess was pleasant, our waiter was cute and pleasant too.  The chicken pieces reminds me of chicken tenders. Strips of chicken battered and fried. No sign of grease though. The waffles were golden brown, crispy and light. Also, the home fries wasn't like anything I've eaten before. Home fries were like air puffs, crispy brown exterior and not fleshy in the center.  Okay, this experience makes me want to return to TCF. I'll aim for happy hour in the near future."
Chiara D.,"Avon, CT",74,78,35,4.0,11/1/2017,The menu is huge and the ambiance is loud but awesome. Â They have a late night delicious menu and a wide array of drinks. You will drop a pretty penny but the size of the dishes is enormous. Â Be prepare to bring home a Doggy bag. You HAVE to save room for a piece of their cheesecake as it is awesome and so worth waiting for.
Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",92,642,796,2.0,1/15/2017,"Chain restaurant, so I don't expect fantastic quality or even very original/unique food.  But the takeout service was excellent, considering most people wouldn't bother making effort for Â to-go orders. But the young lady manning the dessert section and taking orders was very efficient. Not friendly or pleasant, but clearly doing her job and wanting to do it well.  Gets busy very quickly -- I was there right around when it opened, no later than 11:30 if that, and people were already steadily coming in. I overheard from the Host stand that they don't take reservations.  The food: Fish Tacos -- really enjoyed this! Had them grilled, and we liked the sauce. It's described as chipotle sauce, but it has a heaviness to it that tasted like a tangy/zesty mayo. Overall, good!  Factory El Grando burrito -- OK, this should NOT be classified as a burrito. You envision a rolled up tortilla stuffed with food that you can hold with your hands? Yeah, this is laid down flat, and not even rolled that well. So kind of seems like a giant Enchilada. A bit disappointing. Need to reevaluate the description. Lemoncello cream torte Â -- Didn't care for it, a bit too tangy for me, and the middle pieces of cake seemed hardened. I initially thought it was lady fingers but that didn't match the description. And never been a big fan of streusal on top of any dessert.  Fudge layer cake -- Very rich cake. Fudgy ganache like icing on the outside, and in between the layers of cake a sweet buttercream frosting. And chocolate chips on the outside icing as well.  Tiramisu -- gave a giant square piece! Was much bigger than I've gotten anywhere else. This lasted me days. Would come back here for takeout, probably those fish tacos. Nothing else on the menu really stood out to me."
Jedsada Y.,"East Elmhurst, NY",275,440,1382,4.0,2/2/2017,"I've never thought Cheesecake Factory would have such good food. Since we missed lunch special at Applebee's, which was a good sign, we found CF that offers lunch special until 5, plus the happy hour starts at 4! Our server, Domanic S (sp?) was very attentive. We ordered Renee's Special and Salmon with Thai curry sauce. Both dishes came in big portion and were good, surprisingly! We wrapped up our lunch with Long Island Iced Tea Happy which cost only $6, and, man, it was strong! I will definitely come back to try their other lunch specials. Anyway, their beer selection was just alright. ;-("
Cyndi L.,"Flushing, NY",85,7,9,1.0,11/9/2017,"When the food came it was disgusting. The ""banana"" has the barcode sticker on it and the chicken tastes bitter. When we told the waitress about it she was like ""oh you're not suppose to eat the skin anyways."" And when we asked for the bill she asked if we want to pack the food and once we said no she gave us an attitude and asked why. Why? Because the freaking food is disgusting!!!"
Andrea C.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,65,138,5.0,8/9/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday, no wait needed. Our waitress was so nice and patient. And food was as expected. I always order the seared tuna salad and of course it was delicious. Had the mushroom cream soup and it was pretty good( first time trying it) atmosphere was casual and very airy (on the count of it being at the mall it felt very spacious)"
Sabbii G.,"Maspeth, Queens, NY",68,42,3,2.0,10/30/2017,Horrible wait time The food arrived cold And no flavor . Only the cheesecake is fresh .  Go somewhere else for lunch or dinner.
Kat R.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",68,249,188,1.0,6/16/2017,"DO NOT go to this cheesecake factory. This is the WORST one I've ever been to. Just my luck and what I get for being lazy & settling for the closest place to eat. Â But since I've been to several Cheesecake factories, I didn't think it would be bad. Where do I start?? We ordered Hibachi hangar steak with onions & shiitake mushrooms, Â with wasabi mashed potatoes, & tempura asparagus, and Carbonara pasta. I'm so glad we passed on apps and just stuck with the bread. Â The only positive was the fact that they did give two mini loaves of the brown bread that I do like.  First of all we asked for water she brought the water out and didn't even provide straws. I looked over at other tables and noticed they didn't have any straws either. So we didn't bother asking for any. Â But I'm a little OCD and I don't usually like putting my mouth on the glasses. Ok fine I dealt with it. Â But we drank our water, and after she took our order we weren't able to flag her down for more water. Â It wasn't crowded in there, waitresses need to be a little more attentive- like look over and see if the glasses need refilling. Moving on from the water situation- our food took forever to come out & I get the fact that it's steak and needs to cook to order, however, if that's the case then when it comes out it should be piping hot, Â no? OH my freaking goodness! It was cold and my steak was purple!!! I asked for it medium. I specifically told her I want it pink inside. The mushrooms and onions were a joke. Â I had a huge piece of onion skin in my dish. The mashed potatoes were cold, with huge chunks of grey potatoes, so cold that the butter they put on top would barely melt & wasabi??? What wasabi?? There wasn't even a hint. Â My asparagus was cut into little pieces. Â On to the carbonara, it was super watery.. & I know that when you make pasta you usually have to put it into a sautee pan with some pasta water and sauce to coat the pasta well. Â Obviously they added too much pasta water in the process. Now on to the service. The black girl with the platinum blonde shoulder length curly hair was the waitress who started us out (sorry not to offend anyone, I just forgot her name and if someone from the restaurant reads this I want them to know who she is) she practically dropped the plates of food down onto the table, she never checked on us except right when she walked away after ""dropping"" our plates off literally 3 seconds later. Â She didn't refill water, nothing!! Â We then were told by another girl while talking over her back that she was going to be taking over. We never saw her again. Again, it wasn't that crowded. We had to flag down blonde girl to ask for water and then after another long while flag her down again to ask for the check because the other girl who was supposedly taking over never came to us. Finally blonde girl brings the bag and container and practically dropped it into the carbonara. We then flagged down second girl to take the credit card. I was so disgusted. I'll never step foot in that place again. I always get cheesecake to take home. I didn't even do that. Â But then again none of the waitresses even asked if we wanted to order desserts."
Macy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,131,80,1.0,9/29/2017,"I am a fan of the cheesecake factory, but not this one. Not only did they refuse to seat us because our party wasn't all there when the table was available they made us wait another 90 minutes! They have no clue how to seat medium sized Â groups, and we were only 6!! Â 2 which were young children! Â You don't know how to move two adjacent tables together!? Seriously wtf!? Â  If you are a party of two you have quicker seating.  By the time we sat down we already knew what we wanted cause we studied the damn menu for 90 minutes! Â You think cause the server knew we waited so long she'd Â expedite our order cause the children were starving. Nope. Another 45 minutes. Well how about some of that free bread to hold us over? One basket! For 6 mouths. Our basket was empty in 60 seconds. No refill. Let's talk about portion size. I ordered the chicken maderia and steak Diane special. It was 3 pieces of steak and 1 palm size chicken breast. You bet I'm upset! I was already Hangry! Â From that long wait and half piece of bread! Did I mention we arrived well past lunch. It was 2pm. We weren't eating until close to 4! Â I would never ever dine at this location again. I'll take my cheesecake to go!"
Meri L.,"Plainview, NY",443,264,1257,5.0,12/6/2016,"Had a great lunch with my friend on a Tuesday afternoon!  Went on a Tuesday afternoon around 1pm. No wait, we were seated right away.  Bread basket came out fresh and hot. Everyone loves Cheesecake Factory bread!  Drinks came out cold and quick! Beer and mixed drink were both the perfect temperature! Nice and cold.  I ordered the skinnylicious turkey avocado sandwich! It was so good!!! Bacon was nice, thick and crispy! Turkey was flavorful. Avocado and tomato were fresh and delicious.  My friend ordered the pizza and salad lunch combo. No complaints from him. He devoured both.  For dessert I got a bowl of strawberries and he had a caramel cheesecake. No complaints here. Both were very yummy!  Our server, Jessica, was amazing. Very attentive, and made small talk with us. Kept coming back to our table to make sure we had everything we needed. Such a sweetheart!"
Rich W.,"Queens, NY",825,990,4069,5.0,11/15/2016,"Two weeks after our first visit, we are back for their Brunch menu which is only serve on Sunday between 10AM-2PM. So we strategized and planned our brunch like a military mission! The four of us met before 10:30AM and got in quickly to avoid the possible crowds. Wait time- none!  Everything went like clock work except for the parking which was just a 15 minute sacrificed by the driver. There are 11 brunch selections with one kids brunch dish of French toast, bacon and strawberry. I tried the: +Bruleed French Toast- delicious warm crispy bruleed French Toast is almost perfect; a couple of pieces of fruit on the side of the dish would have been ideal. Rate 4/5 +Fried Chicken & waffles Benedict- fried chicken is very good. Waffles are crispy but egg was just over cooked; yolk was not runny but good. Rate 4/5 Brunch here is definitely a great treat at Cheesecake Factory.  The service is great; no rushing us out like other brunch places I have been in Astoria, LIC and Williamsburg. These other places have great brunch too but the seating are elbow to elbow cramp with uncomfortable chairs and tables, Service is by part-time waiters and we are rushed and over the top loud music; not a pleasant experience. Families are better at the Cheesecake Factory. Note: if you came after 12 noon expect long wait time! Pay parking at the Target/Best Buy Mall is recommended to avoid the crowded streets this section of Queens Center."
Arshiya S.,"Woodside, NY",68,123,124,4.0,1/21/2017,"First time coming to this Cheesecake Factory. We came for lunch and were given a beeper with a 30 minute wait. Luckily for us it started buzzing within 10 minutes. After we were seated our server didn't come to our table for a good ten minutes. This was the only negative for me.  After he came and we put in our order the food came out pretty fast. Service was decent. We had crab cakes, avocado egg rolls, cheese pizza, salmon, and black pepper shrimp. Everything was good. Dessert was the strawberry shortcake with vanilla ice cream. Omg so good. My favorite dessert here. This place does look smaller than most of the other CF's we have in NY."
May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",432,575,457,3.0,11/19/2016,"Came here with a few of my co-workers and we had a blast! It was the opening week and it was hell trying to get a table. The waits were ridiculously long, but we did end up finding seats at the bar after half an hour of stalking the high tops. The service was pretty quick given the amount of people there for opening week. Our bartender always made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that the food and cheesecake took FOREVER to come out. I'm sure they were overwhelmed with orders, so I understand, it was just tough because we were all so hungry. If you're looking to get a drink here, get the pineapple moscow mule. It is delicious and has a gigantic slice of fresh pineapple in your drink. For dinner, I had the chicken bellagio (which is my go to dish here) and the tiramisu cheesecake. The chicken bellagio was smaller in portion size than at some of the other Cheesecakes I've been to, but the quality is better. It was also decorated very nicely. I really enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake. It was light an fluffy, but it made me so thirsty afterwards. I had to chug three glasses of water just to feel slightly hydrated. Overall, had a good experience here. Good company, good food and good drinks! Just wish the ticket time was a bit shorter."
Anna H.,"Queens, NY",225,692,8138,5.0,11/6/2016,"This is my very first time in any of The Cheesecake Factory establishment. I am so happy that they open one finally inside the Queens Center Mall and convenient from the Woodhaven Subway Station. I walked into the restaurant at 10:40am and barely anyway for a table though. I told the hostess that it was a group of 4 and I wanted a booth so she suggested like patio sofas.  One of my friends showed up and the other hostess seated us in an area next to the main dining which seems quieter. I guess it was the adult area with less screaming kids and crying babies lol I do love some cushion under my tushy =) I had the servers pulled down the blinds because it was way to sunny and going to ruin our #foodporn pictures  Two of my friends has been here for the Grand Opening so they picked a great spot for Sunday Funday Brunch today! My other friend has been to another location establishment as well so they definitely popped my Cheesecake Factory cherry hahahaha Our server Alisha B has a great personality, very attentive and provided excellent service! She brought out these yummy freshly baked wheat bread with oats and butter spread. I do love bread and I should've stop myself because I did get a bit full on it before my food came to the table.  Sunday Brunch Menu:  Rich: Bruleed French Toast with a side of Canadian Bacon (huge and thick slab of meat on the plate mmmmm)  Sally + Jane + me: Fried Chicken & Waffles Benedict was a popular dish at our table hehe mmm hubba hubba in my tummy...the benedicts had a nice flow but I wish it was a streaming of yoke onto my crispy fried chicken strips though. Pour some sugar on me oops I meant some maple syrup over my fried chicken strips and those crispy waffles. I hardly ate my potatoes but took it home in a doggy bag =)  Sadly I didn't have any room for dessert and really, really wanted to try the Pumpkin Cheesecake =(  Definitely will be back soon!"
Cynthia D.,"Queens, NY",432,764,5472,4.0,11/6/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is truly amazing! Like many other Queens peeps, the nearest one for me was all the way in Long Island. I have been waiting for their grand arrival to Queens Center Mall since I first read about their plans to open here. The day we have all been waiting for is here - first store in New York City is open! This store is very elegant and grand looking! I mean look at those details from the doors to the ceilings! It's beautiful! There is a take-out section, huge bar with displays of endless bottles of alcohol, a fairly big dining area, more seatings in the patio section, and the huge kitchen towards the back.  My companion and I waited a week or two after opening because we already know how popular this place will be. We slipped in around 11:00 am on Sunday - table for 2 was available immediately! Win for us! However, when we walked towards our table, almost the entire restaurant was filled. Come early! My go-to dish here is the Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta dish. I always get it off the regular menu and you bet it is a huge portion! Angel Hair with large shrimp, garlic, lemon, herbs, and diced tomato. Although the dish I had today was a tad dry, the combination of flavors made it so delicious!  Fried Mac & Cheese. Four giant balls of mac and cheese inside of a crispy deep fried layer with marinara sauce then topped with cheese. They arrived to my table piping hot! So good! A nice starter for the table. Â  Oreo Extreme Dream Cheesecake. Oh yes baby, come home with me! Layers of fudge cake, oreo, and chocolate mousse. This is so heavenly delicious that you will dream about it for days to come! GET THIS!  Arnold Palmer. Lemonade and iced tea mix. Always a great drink to get! It comes with a sugar ring here!  This particular location has a bit of a wait for service and food that I can overlook for now. Be patient and bring good company, the food and cheesecake is worth it!"
Aranious F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,21,9,3.0,7/2/2017,"We came here for my daughters graduation/birthday dinner!! Im hoping all goes well, as i continue. First off, the place looks very nice inside and out. We walked in and said table for 3, she asked my name and when I asked how long is the wait she replied no wait. To me no wait means someone is waiting to seat me, now I know why she asked for my name and oh by the way there was a short wait. The waitress came after about 5 minutes to get our drinks and appetizer order. She seemed very nice and accommodating. Her happiness somewhat makes up for my wait/no wait when we first came in. Drinks and appetizers came. My virgin pina colada could have been better, but it was just ok. My daughter liked her raspberry lemonade and her father just had water, which is hard to mess up. Appetizers, fried calamari and crab puffs, again ok, but tasty. Now to main course, which was the stars of the show, pics below. Everything hot and delicious, thank GOD! I have no complaints on my salmon, and everyone was happy with there food! Lastly, the reason people come.....the cheesecake!!! We had different cheesecakes, different flavors, all what we expected! No pics because we dug in and forgot, lol! It was good though. Overall, pretty decent experience. Unfortunately I have to take a star off for my no wait/wait when we entered and the slightly rude sarcastic waiter that tried to apologize and another star for the waitress Pricilla. She took the orders fine, but didn't really check on us and how the food was. I would give 3 1/2 stars if i could, but Yelp doesn't work that way!"
Jasmin O.,"Jamaica, NY",8,116,349,4.0,7/12/2017,"I give it four stars simply because the food and atmosphere overall is good. We just made some bad appetizer choices. I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in about 5 years and it hasn't changed much which is a plus for me. I liked the food then and I enjoyed it now. The drinks were weak, needed more liquor but was good but not for $12.50. The server was very nice but not attentive at all. Over it was a good experience and I will return eventually...lol"
