Gayle B.,"Elmhurst, NY",113,4,3,1.0,2/26/2017,"I came here once before for dinner and waited over an hour for service. Thought I would give it another try for brunch today. TERRIBLE.  We got here early to avoid the rush and ordered our brunch at 11:15am. By 12:00pm we still had no food and no contact from our waitress, our coffee and tea were cold.  So I flagged her down and was told ""we're waiting for eggs"".  Confused, we asked, ""what do you mean you're waiting for eggs?""   She didn't really give us an answer and walked away and the manager came over a few minutes later to tell us they don't have eggs, They are waiting for them. :|  So I lost my appetite and was about to leave so asked to speak to the manager again to ask her HOW she would not let her people know to tell us they didn't have eggs.  She had no answer for us besides ""I'm sorry""  I've been in the management position, as well as the server position many times and tried to empathize, but couldn't take it anymore. So was going to leave.  Right when we were about to go, they brought one of our dishes, which was cold.  The time was now 12:20pm. The manager said she would comp the meal. Big deal. They lost my business."
Jagjit K.,"Manhattan, NY",92,3,,1.0,3/15/2017,"Let me start off by saying that I have been to The Cheesecake Factory at the Long Island location on so many occasions that I can't remember however, this was my first time at the Queens location. The female Manager and staff were rude and borderline offensive. I won't get into too much detail but I will NEVER eat there again. Sub-par service and disgusting food. The Cheesecake Factory at The Source Mall on Long Island has never disappointed me in service or food. I feel sorry for what this location has done for the reputation of the establishment as a whole."
Natalia M.,"Downtown Core, Toronto, Canada",350,1,2,4.0,12/31/2016,"The wait is fucking ridiculous. But the food is very good for the price. Our waiter was very polite and helpful. We had the clam chowder, steak Diane, and spicy chicken chipotle pasta. All very good"
Ricky C.,"Queens, NY",46,9,5,1.0,1/21/2017,Wait time was 30 min on a Saturday.  Not bad at all.  Waited 15 min for all our food (table of four).  I personally ordered Buffalo strips which came cold.  Took 30 min to to have a manager come (which I never requested) and he told me my food would be here in 5 min.  I told him I did not want it any longer and to remove it from the bill.  He said he will wrap it up to go as if insisting I not have it removed from the bill.  I told him it makes no sense and is unfair to have me wait 35 minutes for food and eat it at the table after everyone has eaten their food.  He offered nothing else except a forced apology.  When the bill came I was charged twice for something I did not have in addition to something that the new waiter put by accident.  We were never told of a switch in waiters either.  Will never come here again.
Nissa H.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",3,25,31,3.0,12/30/2016,"The wait is the worst part honestly. Came here on a Friday night. My friends and I arrived at 6, and did not get seated until around 8ish. The wait for the food wasn't nearly as bad as the wait for the table. Everything came in a timely fashion and tasted pretty ok. In my opinion I can skip the entrees. They don't taste all that great to me. I can be completely satisfied with just apps and dessert. My waitress' name was Charlene and she was very nice and helpful."
Zarifa G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,11,10,2.0,7/2/2017,Do not go to this spot please go to the other spot in Nassau County. I went here with my family and the waitress only attended to us once or twice someone else brought our food and she expected to get a very good tip. She was complaining about her tip. First of all we had to wait more than hour secondly the waiter was very rude. I highly recommend the other location
Sory C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/2/2017,Stay away from this location. Great food but the customer service is the WORST! Never going back to the Elmhurst location again!
Junior S.,"Culver City, CA",84,79,98,3.0,4/17/2017,"The Service Was Rough, The Food Took About 35 Min When It Was Slow. The Staff Is Friendly!"
Yuhong Z.,"Jamaica, NY",52,2,,2.0,8/31/2017,Was excited to check this place out but the food here really isn't great. They taste just like Chinese takeout but in a fancier plate and twice the price. Two star is for the atmosphere of this place. I wouldn't recommend this place for food ...
Namita M.,"Rego Park, NY",0,5,4,5.0,11/16/2016,Our first visit to the Cheesecake Factory was amazing! Menu is impressive with variety of options. Our server was very attentive.  We ordered  1. Fried mac and cheese : Omg!!! So yummy! Must try. 2. Fish tacos 3. Chicken Madeira: One of the must try dish in chicken. 4. Chocolate Hazelnut crunch cheesecake: Yummy for tummy! The only negative aspect is that they don't take reservations through phone calls. Waiting time was around an half hour.
Christian R.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,1,,2.0,5/11/2017,"When we first got there, our waiter gave us a moment however he seemed to have disappeared for 20 min, after we ordered our food but we didn't have any utensils and again our waiter was gone for a long time, I ordered a pasta and spilled sauce on my white shirt, after I did laundry the stain is still visible sadly, also we wanted to order desserts but again the waiter spent about 30 min to follow his dreams or something, wasn't my best experience but maybe I'll try it again"
Carlos M.,"OZONE PARK, NY",45,52,4,2.0,2/15/2017,"The wait is ridiculous! I waited 2hrs to be seated, went shopping to kill time and still wasn't enough. The drinks were weak, food was not what I expected from what I was told from my buddy that goes to the Cheesecake Factory in Long Island"
A J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"The worst experienced ever! Don't waste your time and money here! Terrible service, cold food, and on top of that, they charged my credit card 3 times with 3 different amounts from other tables ""by mistake"" ....let's start saying we had to wait over 1 hr to get a table, then they served us the food 30 minutes later and it was cooked the wrong way as what we inniatly ordered..... Then they brought us the drinks (wine, sangria) AFTER we finishied eating. 10 min later the rude and NOT professional manager Amamda brought us the Pina Colada that we had ordered over an hour ago, and that of course we refused to accept!. We finally ask for the bill and when the waiter comes back he charged a different (higher) amount to my credit card. I told him and decided to go with him to the cash register kiosk to make sure I have a refund receipt and when I he charges again my card, he charges it with another higher different amount! This was unbelievable!! I ask to talk to the manager and to my surprise is Amanda, the lady who was rude and unprofessional when they decided to bring us the Pina colada like 10 minutes later after we finished eating!! Simply ridiculous!!! I'll never go back there!!  And Noone should!!"
Francis L.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,3.0,12/21/2016,I had a good time here the food was great. I had the orange chicken and a coke. The venue itself is pleasant. It took us a about an hour to get our food.  This place would be great if the service was faster
Lisa R.,"New York, NY",41,46,19,3.0,3/31/2017,"I've been trying to come here since it opened but they always have a ridiculous wait time. We finally made the trip on a Saturday around 1 and waited about 35 minutes which wasn't to bad because we got to walk a round the mall a little. They sat us in a area that was a bit closed off and towards the street and my husband and I loved the secluded feeling. Our server was friendly and the food portion was huge!!. My husband and I both couldn't finish half of our salads, and he even ordered a appetizer and took half of that home too. The best part about the Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake and they have LOW CARB cheesecake! I was so excited and you couldn't tell the difference. All in all the food was good with big portions and I love the low carb options, but there is always a outrageous wait time so be prepared to wait. Call ahead to find out how long the wait is beforehand."
Charles D.,"New York, NY",76,11,4,2.0,1/31/2017,Terrible service and long waits for food as we asked for gluten free pasta. My meal came out cold and server was bossy and rude. Wouldn't come back again
Che R.,"Jamaica, NY",0,7,2,5.0,11/27/2016,Went here on a Sunday! It was packed 80min wait i was able to look around the mall and come back.. WORTH THE WAIT!  Food was awesome & waiters was nice! They need a larger space until they rent the rest of that side of the mall be ready to wait..
Daniel K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location was the worst dining experience I've ever had. We waited over 15 min to be asked what we wanted to drink. When people who came in after us were already being served. After were seated, and the appetizers that we ordered were cold. After sending it back, they had brought over another one which was no different, it was also cold. We had never even received plates for the appetizers. We had asked for a knife 3 times and it was never brought over. When the entrees came out, they were also cold. It was disgusting. I asked for honey mustard when my entree arrived and received it towards the end of my meal. Never coming back here again. Very disappointed with the service, the waiter was no where to be found half the time. When we received the bill they had actually charged us TWICE for the cold appetizers. If I can give half of a star, I would."
Karen J.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",8,23,190,1.0,3/13/2017,"So I've been to the Cheese Cake Factory before,  With much delight! This Factory was close to home so after a few hours of shopping I thought I would give it a shot! Ok so basically my daughters and I waited for about a hour! Not bad ok we waited!! After we where seated a nice waitress came over took our drink orders, brought them to our table quickly then disappeared! After almost 30 minutes more another server came over and ask if the 1st server took out order so she explained it was coming out! Not explaining to us that she was the new waitress cause the 1st one went on a break! After another 30 minutes I casually walk over to the manager and ask what was the deal! Cause we waited for a full hour for freaking appetizers he walked to the kitchen and came out with one order from the four, then 15 minutes later we were all eating and they also brought out My to go order! to think it was such a disappointment, cause at that point we were to tired to eat! When the bill came it was a whomping $97.00 I then ask the waitress to tell the manager he need to adjust the bill..just for us waiting so long he did! The bill was adjusted to $40.00 our drinks and to go order was free...plus I still gave the waitress a $10.00 tip! Even if she didn't explain! She was the new waitress! Oh yea! And while we wait the fire alarm was blasting for almost 15 minutes with not even an explanation to as why? This establishment is good for those who live in the neighborhood and have no car to travel else where!"
Matyia H.,"Manhattan, NY",140,4,4,5.0,4/1/2017,"Lovely staff. I was greeted and seated rather quickly. Since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory before but not this particular restaurant I ordered my go to, which is the fried Mac N Cheese and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. Everything was great! I would go back."
