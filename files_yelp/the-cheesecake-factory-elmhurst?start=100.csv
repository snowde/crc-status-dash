Tita O.,"Ridgewood, NY",1,11,2,1.0,4/23/2017,"I love Cheesecake  Factory in general. This particular location, however, is an absolute mess! Avoid at all costs! And if you MUST dine at queens center mall, choose any other spot.  You will WAIT.... WAIT.... and WAIT... some more!! The wait times are ridiculously long and the front desk staff has no concept of time. I was given an hour wait for my party and ended up waiting OVER 2 hours... When we finally got called there was a small scuffle between a server and a hostess. The hostess had a long metal spoon that she was waving around trying to provoke the male employee into hitting her first.  She then ran up and down the aisles yelling expletives and shouting about being disrespected. It was all a bit too scandalous for my taste. At no point did any staff member apologize for the disruption or the long wait.  If you are hungry and time is valuable to you, avoid this place."
Wailana W.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,244,889,1.0,4/14/2017,"My prerequisite for our late dinner was fast, easy good and not too expensive.  I got none of the above.  In the past, when I have been to a CF, it's been in Jersey at the mall and while not fine dining, the experience I recall was not too bad.  Here at Queens Center at 10:30 pm, there's no parking on the street so you have to park in the mall garage (and pay for parking) and have to come back outside to the street because there's no access to mall entrance during its closed hours, in order to enter the restaurant.  With a half hour to closing time, there were still about a dozen tables still eating.  Ordering is no easy feat with their extensive menu with all the calorie counts.  Psychologically, it works, at least for me that I am not apt to order something that is 2000 calories and then a cheesecake for another 2000 calories.  It definitely works as a deterrent and reminds me how fattening dairy and carbs are.  The appetizer of fried calamari was good, fried, yes but if shared, not horrible but a bit salty for my bf's taste.  I opted for the chilled grilled ahi tuna with the wasabi aioli on the side over white rice and veggies.  What I got was tuna that looked like it was cut with a butter knife, a little rough around the edges which I honestly don't mind.  Tuna prepared this way is really rare or raw and it was correct for the temp but it seems they followed the same protocol for the rice and veggies.  The first mistake was they used long grain rice which is incongruous to the dish since medium or short grain would be better match.  That's not even as important as the fact, the rice was underdone and cold.  That was my main turn off.  I noticed CF has quite a few dishes with white rice so they should have a better handle on how to prepare and serve it.  The veggies also, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and snow peas were neither raw nor cooked.  It had an undercooked taste to it.  I appreciate the fact that they were probably striving for a quick Asian stir fry but they should continue striving  a little more as it wasn't cooked.  My aioli that I asked to be put on the side was not present at all but that was okay.  I am not a big fan of mayonnaise-y dressings any way.  They're also laden with extra calories.  I made a relatively low caloried dish even more low caloried as I couldn't eat the rice and didn't have the dressing.  The veggies had they been cooked a little more would have been finished.  My bf's go-to dish other than a steak, is a pasta alfredo mixed with a pesto sauce.  They accommodated by giving extra pesto on the side which he mixed in himself in his Alfredo.  From what I saw and tasted with half a strand of fettucine, he was more successful than I was in my selection.  His strawberry cheesecake was light and fresh, probably better than the iconic Junior's.  He ate half the cheesecake and brought half home which he later finished. All in all, there's only half a success story.  The service was also uneven, with no plates or utensils on the table even after the appetizer was served.  We finally flagged down another server to get a set and then our server comes later with another set saying she had to find the plates, etc. intimating that's why it took so long.  A proper resolution to this awkwardness would be, apologize and take back the second set of plates and utensils in hand.  But no, she proceeded to put down the second set so now our small 2 person table had  8 forks, four knives, 4 napkins.  That was insensitive and lazy on her part to not bring back the unnecessary sets.  Similarly, when I first sat down and as I was taking off my coat, with my hand half in the sleeve, she hovered over me to hand me the menu.  Our server needs to learn how to adjust to the customer's situation and not go through the mechanical motions.  She needs to be more intuitive.  It should be about satisfying the customer and not about her.  Let me spell it out in case management reads this and is open to some customer service advice. If the customer has no hands available to take the menu, the server should place it down on the table rather than force the customer to take it with her hand still in her coat as she taking her coat off. If the table doesn't have plates and silverware, get some quickly but if the customer already got some while you were away, don't give them the extra set in your hands for no reason other than the fact you don't want to feel like you wasted your time ""looking"" for them.  So the clincher is the meal cost us nearly $90 for 2 people.  Next time, if we need fast, good and inexpensive, I would go to the neighboring Joe's Crab or Shake Shack or even Burger King.  I am not adverse to chains but this reminds me how bad things could be."
Anthony O.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",10,23,5,5.0,11/5/2016,"Because the restaurant is new I decided to go early to avoid the madness. Thankfully I did. We decided to sit at the bar area.  Drew and Lindsey were awesome. Very attentive to our needs. They made the experience pleasant.  I got the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and they were amazing. Great portions for the price.  No more driving to Long Island, Upstate or NJ to go to Cheesecake Factory. Although, it being walking distance now may be dangerous to my waist line."
Nuzhat S.,"Jamaica, NY",168,12,2,2.0,4/18/2017,"I was so completely disappointed which is a shame because the first time I came here, everything was wonderful. Our server was this blonde woman whose name I forgot but was sweet and attentive and made our meal there a great experience.  I raved about it to my best friend so we went back with our boyfriends and the server just seemed angry with us. She avoided eye contact and would just toss things at us and practically sprint away. To be fair, we had said we needed 5 extra minutes twice to place our order but that's still not an excuse to mistreat a group of people. She even went to the table right next to us and laughed and smiled at them and then would get to us and drop the niceness and just do everything but sprint away from us.  It was honestly so insulting when she flat out ignored my boyfriend who was trying to get her attention to let her know she had made a mistake with the bill. So not only was Erika Mae rude and neglectful, but she couldn't even be bothered to bill us properly!  When Elise momentarily took over her shift we had a much better dining experience but then Erika Mae was back and we were literally taken aback at how poorly we were being treated. It was as if we had hurt her long ago and she was getting petty revenge.  I don't know what crawled up her ass and died but I know I'm never going back and if anyone gets her as a server, they should request someone else because she cant even claim to have been having a bad day when she was treating everyone else nicely but us."
Mera V.,"Jackson Heights, NY",1,7,1,2.0,7/8/2017,"Conveniently located in the Queens Center mall with plenty of free parking around when you're lucky, The Cheesecake Factory has a very friendly staff. The wait time is long but you have the luxury of shopping around while you wait. They call you when your table is ready which is really nice. The food is low in average because it lacks flavor. I ordered the lemon garlic shrimp which came out very garlicky and buttery. Maybe the lack of flavor is because It came off the skinny menu.  The shrimp was rubbery. My friend's got the California salads but the tastiest was the Detox salad.  The appetizer we ordered were the mixed egg rolls which were  delicious especially with the sauces.  This place is fun for the experience and the atmosphere. Food is not satisfying. I didn't try the cheesecake but many of the tables around me had it coming to the tables non-stop so I'm sure it is delicious."
Maggie C.,"New York, NY",5,16,46,4.0,7/7/2017,"Great service and atmosphere! Our waiter was super friendly and patient. The food took a while to come, but it's understandable due to Sunday's busy brunch schedule. Loads of food options on the menu :)"
Kristina C.,"New York, NY",109,21,7,3.0,3/31/2017,"Four stars for the food. It's a chain, so you already know what you're getting. One of my favorites is the garlic creamy pasta - it is sooo delicious and hearty. And, of course, the cheesecake is amazing. The wait for our food was just insane here! On a Wednesday afternoon, after the dinnertime rush, my party of three waited over an hour for our meal - two pasta dishes and a chicken sandwich. Appetizer came out right away, but it just took absolutely forever for our food to come. There was really no apology from the server or anyone else or even any update while we waited. I would have loved to be comped for my Cheesecake for the extremely long wait, but alas, no."
Peter C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,6,,1.0,4/29/2017,"Went there for dinner, it was ok, nothing too special, just the basic classic franchise restaurant. Service was ok, the waiter checks up on us every now and then. Food was also average, I personally like the jambalaya noodle they have. The only reason I rated this with one star was because I ordered takeout after dinner for my dad, the Thai chicken lettuce wrap, and when I got home and gave it to my dad there was no chicken, just lettuce... and I live in Brooklyn so no way am I going back there for the chicken. TL;DR: make sure you double check your take out before leaving just to make sure they have everything."
Reut D.,"Queens, NY",26,3,1,4.0,10/28/2016,"I had the farfalle pasta, it was very good. The problem is that I have made changes to the dish that the Kitchen agreed to, but when the dish arrived, it was missing some key ingredients. It was still very good, could have been better. The staff was welcoming and nice. Our server was missing at times and the other servers took our requests. Very professional on their behalf.  Another nice moment was when we first set down,  we were 4 adults and my baby boy.  We asked for a high chair and it was ready by our table and the hostess was so nice, she brought me some warm bread and a sliced banana for my baby without even asking...  Will definitely come back again."
Stev G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/16/2017,Let me start off by saying I never would write a review like this in my life until now. My experience at this location is a disgrace for this franchise and management seriously needs to step in and observe and record whats is happening at this location and take notes and get rid of the cancer.  Tonight October 16th I decided to call to place a order for take out and while waiting on the phone 15plus min driving in; i arrived at the restaurant was told to wait in person while my phone call was on hold and the hostess not doing anything was watching my on hold call. After waiting 8min in person and the 15 min time on my phone while being on the phone i finally was helped and the phone call was ignored i then asked does anyone answer the phone and take orders. By the way it was 10pm and empty and plenty of workers were just standing around. Lets be honest its writing down a order not preparing the meal or packaging it. I told them next time you should pick up the phone cause you just lost my business.  Also someone saw me and said the service in this location is bad.
Jen Z.,"Flushing, NY",0,46,81,4.0,11/23/2016,"Came to eat dinner before Thanksgiving with my fam. It was around 5pm and luckily we got seated after waiting for 20min., which isn't bad. The food we ordered... 1. Pineapple Moscow Mule- really good! Can barely taste the vodka. It was like pineapple juice. 2. Fried Mac and Cheese- loved it! Crunchy on the outside and cheesy inside. 3. Steak Diane (medium rare)- it was a bit overcooked at some part but it was still pretty good. Mashed Potatoes was pretty good as well. 4. Chicken Marsala and Mushroom w. Bowtie Pasta (forgot the name)- more to the sweeter side but still good.  5. Southern Fried Catfish- The catfish was really soft, which is great! Mashed potatoes ofc was good.  The only thing that I didn't really like was how slow the service is. It takes a while for them to serve all the food out, so expect that to happen. Either the chefs gotta learn how to cook faster or they gotta hire more chefs.  Overall, the food was pretty good so I didn't mind about the long wait. We were too full so we didn't get the chance to try some cheesecake but next time. The total was about $88 including tax, not bad. Had to bring some leftovers home since we couldn't finish it."
Rose B.,"Portland, OR",0,4,2,4.0,6/23/2017,"Went here with my mom for dinner before a show. Thought we had some time to kill and ordered steak tacos. Right after we order mom checks the tickets again and realizes our show is at 7pm rather than 8pm.  Cue panic. We suddenly have one less hours. Thank god Tim was our waiter. We explained the situation (having only order moments before) and he hopped to it. We got out right on time. I so appreciate his attention to detail and care in handling our needs. I know how much it must suck to have a table suddenly have very strict time constraints but he was so sweet and wonderful about the whole thing. My only wish is that they made reservations, I called today so mom and I could have a less rushed experience here and apparently seating is on arrival. Maybe it would drop the wait time some of there were reservations available. Also, the steak tacos were INCREDIBLE. They deserve their own review!"
Hannanatu S.,"Queens, NY",181,18,14,5.0,3/29/2017,Came here with my family for my birthday dinner and had a great time. My server was attentive but not over bearing and the food was delicious. I look forward to coming back and would definitely recommend coming here.
Queen R.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,489,7,5.0,5/1/2017,"Delivery service was done in 30 min. When an item was thought to be non-stocked, I received a call asking if I would like anything else. When the item was delivered (shortly after I placed my order) they called in to inform me.  Food was delicious, all my vegetarian samplings were phenomenal.  Colour me impressed."
Agnes W.,"Briarwood, NY",21,23,118,3.0,4/14/2017,Came here for lunch. I use to love going to their location in Long Island. I didn't like anything I ordered. Everything was too salty.  Best thing about the whole experience was the passion fruit margarita and service.
Mike V.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",1,13,,1.0,2/19/2017,"Very slow service here. I am a fairly patient person but if you're not putting 2 hours aside for this dining experience, you're in trouble.  Also, I have twice ordered a burger and asked for no mayo and both times the servers messed up it.  Both times they made some excuse. The first time I sat and waited 20 minutes for my server to even take it back.  Get your service working there, people. I think I got one more try here and then I say adios to the Cheesecake Factory."
Jaclyn G.,"New York, NY",0,134,112,3.0,4/9/2017,"Had dinner here last night we got avocado egg rolls, nachos, fried cheese balls and fish tacos. We waited over an hour on a Saturday. The nachos were really good recommend them not a big fan of the other things . Also fish tacos were good. I thought it was a overall good experience but the wait was unreasonable."
Adonis C.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,3,,1.0,2/3/2017,"I was advised not to go to this location, but I had to try it my self. It's a new location so as expected the Decor is beautiful, but today for the first time I ordered my normal take out choice ""Jamaican black pepper shrimp"" and when I got home to my surprise these cheap bastards gave me half the shrimp I usually get at the Westbury location. It's like they went over they're budget so know I have to sacrifice with my portions. I swear they're isn't a shortage of shrimp in New York so I can't figure out a logical reason for this. What's worse is when I finally decided to eat the food, it was over cooked. First and last time. So disappointed."
Kathie M.,"Flushing, NY",288,5,31,1.0,2/28/2017,Thought I'd give this Cheesecake factory another try after waiting 40 minutes food last time.  This time waiting for a table only took 30 minutes but my food took 1 hour after I order which is terrible.  Then the waitress told us since we are waiting so long we have a complimentary cheesecake on her. Well its was nice of her but this is by far the my worst experience at cheesecake factory. Even for coming here on a Tuesday. The food wasn't too great either.. very dry.  You probably have better luck eating at the food court downstairs or driving to Long Island to eat at Cheesecake Factory.  I wouldn't recommend you to come  here.
Jay Infamous L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",150,493,35,3.0,8/1/2017,"First time going to the Queens Center Cheesecake Factory...have had their food very few times several years back and from what I remember it was fairly good. Came here specifically though for National Cheesecake Day the other day and got the Tiramisu Cheesecake which was really good. Can't really comment on much else about Cheesecake Factory here but they can use a little bit more organization how they have their take out line be more separated from their line to just order cheesecake. Other than that, that's about it...will come here again some other time to actually sit down and partake on the food."
