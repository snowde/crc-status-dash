Jose T.,"JAMAICA, NY",62,30,35,4.0,9/1/2017,"We went here on a Thursday night. I had the whiskey smash. It was really good I had 2 of them. We had 3 appetizers. Stuffed mushrooms, mini crab cakes and a stuffed potatoes i think they were. All were very good. For my entree i had the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp. Reeeeally tasty. You can have it with white or brown rice. Their portions are big. My kids had to take some home. The nachos is definitely enough for 2 people. We will go again. The service was good. Im bad with names but she was very nice"
George C.,"Corona, NY",34,3,1,4.0,11/5/2016,"As expected the cheesecake was very good. While there, you gotta try the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, it's exceptional. The restaurant and team is still new so it's not yet the well-oiled machine that it could be. The estimated wait of 15 minutes turned out to be 4 times longer than expected, and as for the wait staff, I'd rate them a B. With a little time I'd hope to move that up to an A grade."
Kat D.,"Corona, NY",6,21,,2.0,8/16/2017,Just drive to one in LI or Yonkers! Ordered the nachos and they were soaked in oil. Soggy too. Pizza was bleh. Soft like it had been microwaved and tasted like out of a box. Our server was cool and of course the Cheesecake was good. Those are what my two stars are for!
King C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,39,1.0,9/30/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory before but this time is the worst by far and last straw. Never again will I want to go to a Cheesecake Factory. 1. Waited a while and no water. Since I was thirsty I asked the waitress again for water. Waitress said will be right back with water then proceeded to take orders for the table next to us, enter the orders, and not show up for a while. 2. The appetizer arrived before the water and drinks. I had to wait another several minutes before water and drinks arrived. Ended waiting for like 20 minutes for water and drinks. That is just ridiculous! 3. Waitress forgot to place our entree orders. Realized it when she came back 10 minutes later to ask what we wanted to order. 4. Overall, long wait for the food. Appetizer came on time then waited over 30 minutes for entrees.  5. Calamari appetizer was kind of good because of the marinara sauce but nothing memorable or worth getting again. 6. Shepherd's pie was very bad in taste and looks. It looked like a dark mess and was appetite ruining to look at. Tasted odd and overly salty. It was more like a marsala. There were burnt bits in it, of I don't know what. Most of it was not finished. 7. Shrimp scampi was 40% good 60% bad. The shrimp was very good, cooked just right, nice crisp, and just right flavoring. The pasta tasted like lemon+sugar and nothing else. Half the pasta was not finished. 8. Gumbo was 50% good. Broth base taste was good and mixed well with the rice. The chicken was overcooked and dry, with most of it left over. The shrimp was also overcooked but edible. Also found burnt charred bits of I don't know what in it. Half of it was left over because no longer had appetite to finish. Really was looking forward to have some cheesecake but not going to happen after the terrible service and food we had.  We arrived at 9:40ish pm, waited about one hour to be seated, and finished about 11:50pm. Overall, about two hours spent for the meal and it was almost a complete waste of time. ."
Sebastian T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",31,4,2,4.0,3/16/2017,"Went one saturday afternoon with my girlfriend and best friend. The three of us had a wonderful time! The food was very good and out waitress was super nice and attentive. Only downside to this place is that the wait can be fucking brutal. We got lucky on our first visit having only a 40 minute wait time. Our second visit, we were told it was going to be 2 hours for a table. Sadly had to walk away from that and order some cheap takeout instead."
Hajara M.,"Queens, NY",15,1,,1.0,12/8/2017,"I came here for the first time with my husband. Yeah, never again. If you're given a table located semi-outside and not completely in the restaurant, the half-hour wait for your food will be a freezing one. Also, there's no light except the streetlights outside your window. So you're pretty much eating in the dark. That wasn't the worst part of the experience though. Out waiter, Valerie, was insanely rude. Her actions were completely uncalled for. Since it was our first time at the restaurant, my husband and I wanted to try out several things--one of which was the mushroom burger (a friend has been pushing me to try one for months). The menu said nothing about it having beef, so when a mushroom burger containing a beef patty came to our table, as vegetarians, we wanted it sent back. Valerie, with her nasty racist attitude, decides to tell my husband and I that, ""Here in America, mushroom burgers have beef in them."" Um, no, not true at all. You can easily find restaurants where the patty of a mushroom burger is made out of mushroom, which is what we thought we were getting. Even more, not that it should matter, my husband and I were born and raised here in the US, she needs to be fired for her discriminatory behavior. Valerie then lies and says the menu says the mushroom burger has beef so when I ask her to bring the menu over, which she does so fearfully because she knew she was lying, we both see that the menu does not mention a single inkling of meat or beef in its description. Feeling defeated, Valerie says, ""Well what do you want, because you guys already have three other things?"" Is that the way to promote the restaurant you're working for? Rather than asking if there's something else we'd like on the menu, she pretty much told us we do not and should not be ordering more food, as if that's any of her business. I'm never coming back to the Cheesecake Factory. again. And I'll make sure that none of my friends and family members will come to this Cheesecake Factory again until the issue is resolved. I really hope the restaurant owners see this review and have Valerie fired for her nasty attitude, who knows who else she may be discriminating against. Oh yeah, the food? It was mediocre anyway."
Lashaun B.,"Queens, NY",0,10,3,1.0,7/20/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory located in the Queens Center Mall is an embarrassing representation for the franchise. We started with drinks and my fiancé ordered a passion fruit mojito and I ordered the peach Bellini. Both drinks were really good but I liked my fiancé mojito a little more because I could actually taste the alcohol. My fiancé ordered the chicken bellagio which our server, Jordan discouraged him from getting because he said it did didn't have any flavor and recommended the parmesan chicken. I ordered a favorite of mine the chicken stuffed tortillas.   At least 30 minutes had passed and Jordan hadn't checked on us or asked us if we wanted more drinks and we still didn't have our food so my fiancé ask for him to check on it. Jordan brings my chicken stuffed tortillas first then my fiancé chicken Bellagio. My fiancé food looks right but mine looks like it's missing something. I noticed the sweet corn cakes are missing from the plate. I ask our server, Jordan Where are the corn cakes. He looks at me with a confused expression. He said that is what you ordered. I said I know, but it's missing the corn cakes that give the dish that sweet with savory balance. The waiter just kept the dazed and confused look, so I asked him to bring me a menu. He comes back with the menu and starts trying to look through the menu to find it. I told him to give it to me because I know exactly what page it was on. When I turned to the page and pointed to the details of the dish where it list what's in it, the waiter doesn't even look at the menu instead he walks away... yes you read correctly. I point to where it says corn cakes and this guy just walks away. There happens to be another waiter, Tyrone cleaning up a table beside us and I ask him if the chicken stuffed tortillas comes with corn cakes and he said yes it does. Tyrone is the star of this story because he apologized for our bad service even though he wasn't even our waiter. This restaurant doesn't deserve you.  A manager I want to call Jessica comes out and says sorry we don't have any corn cakes would you like something else. Wtf? I wouldn't have ordered this dish if I would have known that. She said I'm sorry I just found out. She said I can give you a minute to think about it. It had taken so long just to get the food I didn't want to wait in that cold restaurant waiting for any more disappointment.  Our waiter, yes that idiot that lacked social grace came to my fiancé and asked if he was keeping his food. That's how it is Jordan,really? First you was recommending food then something goes wrong with my dish and you don't even say I'm sorry the meal wasn't complete or I'm sorry I didn't check on you guys before we got the food or after. The manager comes back out, I tell her I don't want anything just take care of my fiancé meal. The managerJessica by the way is not rude, but she is basic. Basic customer service, basic concern with a lot of basic staff. (She first was just going to offer me cheesecake for my trouble) lol.  We asked Jordan for a box for my fiancé food and this fool actually said I thought you said you didn't want it. Now I'm pissed. We explained the manager comped his meal and I said it's not your concern anyway seeing as you didn't do anything to resolve the situation. He looks at me and says how come, I didn't make the food I just brought it out. I told him that it's not that there was an error that makes him responsible it's because he never admitted there was a mistake, he walked away when I showed him there was something missing and didn't say anything(weird) and he walked around us like I did something wrong even though my meal was wrong. I said in the future instead of trying to give your unsolicited advice on food we should order make sure you learn how to effectively communicate to customers their order will be incomplete and learn strategies in how to best resolve issues when problems arise. At the very least most waiters will say I'm sorry we didn't have what you ordered correct or I apologize that you were disappointed with your meal.. See Jordan, simple. This is by far the WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. From the wait time to get the food, bad management, to incompetent servers, this Cheesecake Factory location is a fail. Also the other manager Katie who describes herself as a second tier manager... yes sweetheart you are definitely second tier. Your sarcastic tone and unfriendly disposition fits quite perfectly in this second tier establishment. Tyrone even though you were not my waiter nor management you showed more professionalism and class than all other parties mentioned above. Yes, it did mean a lot to us  that you apologized for the bad experience."
Yvonne L.,"New York, NY",12,1,,1.0,8/29/2017,"I went there with family for the first time last Sunday noon. The food is great but the service is terrible! It was 2 in the afternoon and the place is half empty but the stuff makes us wait for like over 30min for the table. Today I decided to give it another try but I think I'll just put it in my ""never going again"" list!!"
Rey W.,"White Plains, NY",2,121,,4.0,9/21/2017,Went here today service was fast and reliable..I had the salmon with mashed potato and broccoli then I had the pumpkin cheesecake..the waitress was good and cool would go back
Isabel N.,"Great Neck, NY",339,12,6,5.0,5/2/2017,Great place to have lunch but dinner gets really busy with sometimes a two hour wait!  So get there early if possible. Great food with a very large menu with tons of selections and great service.
Candace S.,"Queens, NY",71,48,102,3.0,1/16/2017,"I went to the new location attached to the Queens Center Mall. The atmosphere was great on a Thursday night. Half hour wait but I was catching up with a close friend so it's all good. Restaurant and bathroom were clean and relaxed. Service was very good. Very nice waitstaff, not pushy and gave us space. The food was mediocre; truly just ok. I had mozzarella sticks which were squares as well as zucchini sticks. Greasy and reminiscent of bar food. I looked forward to dessert. I had Chris' cheesecake which was chocolate, coconut, and chocolate mousse. In reality it was German chocolate filling on top of cheesecake with a dollop of chocolate mousse- mouse was very sweet. Food was quite underwhelming, however,  if I was drinking it would be perceived as better. I will go back bc it's close to my house and is a cool date spot."
Mark T.,"Ashburn, VA",2,18,2,1.0,4/9/2017,"Went to the Northern VA Dulles Town Center Cheesecake and we ordered 2 Santa fe salads 1 half and the other full size.. Both salads came the same small size compared to the usual full size. Ordered another dish, Filet Mignon medium well. We received a mystery cut of beef that was less than 1/4 inch in thickness and it was well well done..... asked for a manager and he proceeded to tell me this was ""The Cheesecake Factory cut of Filet Mignon"" that some are thin and others are thick... complete nonsense..... I am not sure whats going on with the CF but their maybe just about average food is failing fast... been coming here for years and years... sad to say but there are too many choices to waste time at an establishment that is dishonest...."
Eduardo F.,"East Elmhurst, NY",5,33,,2.0,2/20/2017,This place is whack. The servers are nice; but the service is slow. I've noticed that they run out of several items on their menu; despite the fact that those are their most popular items. How does one run out of their more popular items that frequently? Then; there is the portion size of the meals. I once ordered a Factory Burrito; and I was surprised to find out that it's tiny. It pretty much looked like a small fat wrap. Recently; I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Damn; the serving was tiny. It was served on a side dish platter. Perhaps this place is best suited for take out. Honestly; I rather go to the Factory over in Westbury.
Alexander C.,"Corona, NY",1,1,,1.0,1/4/2017,"First and foremost I would have to say that you should avoid this location. The hospitality here is subpar. It took almost 10 minutes for us to get water (we didn't receive refills for the rest of our stay), another 5 minutes after that for our cocktails and ultimately a server who didn't even bring us shared plates or resetted the table.  We received our bread at the table 2 minutes prior to getting our appetizers. For appetizers we had guacamole and calamari. The guacamole was very refreshing whereas the calamari was VERY salty. If you're a fan of calamari, refrain from ordering it here.  For my entrée I had the garlic noodles with chicken, it didn't have asparagus or mushrooms as it stated on the menu, but I had no time to even let my server know because he was never anywhere to be found. In addition, the noodles were very bland, dry and needed more sauce. By the time I saw my server I was already done eating and mentally checked out. I've worked in the industry for years and this has to be the one of the worst restaurants as far as hospitality goes. Whatever happen to adhering to the steps of service or the MOD touching a table to ensure their guests are fine?  RECAP Appetizer: The guacamole was refreshing whereas the calamari was almost inedible.  Entrée: Subpar and isn't a direct reflection on what's on the menu description.  Hospitality: The server was nowhere to be found and our table wasn't resetted with shared plates. Don't expect to get what you pay for or read on the menu. VERY inconsistent."
Stanley C.,"New York, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2017,"I wish there is review for no star. The reception desk just does not respect large party. Even the manager also can not provide how she will handle a party of 8. Party of 2 , the waiting time is 25 minutes but party of 8 after wait for two hours, still hand on the air. We move to Longhorn , the management is totally different."
Josie M.,"New York, NY",0,10,14,5.0,5/22/2017,"Was in the neighborhood yesterday with my family looking for a place to have breakfast and my 9 year old son who loves The Cheesecake Factory suggested we go for Sunday brunch. The food was amazing as always and our server Chantel was a pleasure. She recommended the brûlée french Toast so both my husband and I had it. So glad we took her advice, it was heavenly. Our 4 kids really enjoyed their brunch as well."
Yumi L.,"Elmhurst, NY",0,8,1,3.0,12/26/2016,"The three stars is for the foods only. I am very disappointed with my waitress, very impatient and rude, name starts with N. When she first came over to the table, we want to start ordering the drinks first, we took a few seconds to discuss an alternative because they don't offer what we request. Then she got impatient and said we need more time she will come back, she just left and without giving us any recommendation on the menu. When we told her we are ready to order, she just said ok and left us waiting for another 20minute. That's been 30 minute passed since we sat down. Finally the food came in another half hour, it was two other different servers who serve the food, and they are very nice. When we finished, our waiter came back, we asked for desert, and she started to take the plates away, she took the first plate, and then she have her hand there and waiting for us to hand her the other plate. I'm have never been to a restaurant that a customer have to serve the waiter/waitress. I understand it's a Holiday, and it is busy. But the waitress make me feel like I'm not welcoming at the place, very unprofessional. We still give a 15% tip, only because we don't know if they share the tips. But I really don't think she deserve it."
Natalia R.,"Woodside, NY",2,32,1,2.0,7/18/2017,"Pros:  -The cheesecakes -Beautiful lay out and decor Cons:  -Wait time is always ridiculous -There are definitely not enough servers for how many tables they have. Our server clearly didn't have much time for us or any of the tables around us. All the servers just constantly look like theyre running and can't be bothered because theyre soo busy. And I don't really blame them, they were very sweet, they just all seemed very stressed and overworked. -Several of the minor things we asked for we never got like extra lemon or dressing for the salad. -So hectic. One of the staff who just brings out food kept literally stomping in our area and shouting everyone's orders and dropping them so loudly on everyones tables and stomping back out. Constantly. Again I know its because theyre so busy but its disturbing and causes a scene.. please slow down and quiet down a bit.. this isn't like a fast food cafeteria where you just shout peoples orders and plop their tray down on the table -None of us really loved our food. Salmon was a bit dry. Orange chicken was mediocre. Chicken cesar salad was HUGE (like too big. nobody can eat that much salad.) but super bland. The fish tacos, although they didn't taste so fresh, were actually the most decent."
Meesha H.,"Astoria, NY",82,8,13,1.0,1/7/2017,Cheesecake Factory has good food. That cannot be disputed but the service at the queens blvd / queens center mall location is HORRIBLE !  Three different times of horrendous service. To he point where I could've and should've walked out !!  I think I will just take the drive and head to Roosevelt field and go to grand Lux !
Hans B.,"Queens, NY",0,3,,1.0,12/15/2016,"I am so mad, I felt obliged to open an account and share my experience. Today, December 15, 2016 at 5pm I went to this location of the cheesecake factory yo buy a whole cheesecake. It took them 40 minutes! FORTY MINUTES, to be able to give 1 cheesecake. The exact same cheesecake is half the price at the Costco which is 300 feet away! So,if you want to wait 40 minutes to just get a cheesecake to go (I wonder how many weeks would they need if it was a dine-in order) feel free to go. I will continue buying Cheesecake factory's cheesecakes, but I will never go back there. 40 minutes for a cheesecake, do not get surprised when you run out of business. Because with that attitude, you won't last long..."
