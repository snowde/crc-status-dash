Johanna B.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",1,5,2,1.0,3/26/2017,Place an order to go (pasta yambalaya ) pasta is overcooked cold and nasty portion is so little . trying to call the restaurant. To speak to a manager they put me on hold for 37 minutes and they hang up the phone. .
Jackie d.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",5,28,10,1.0,3/11/2017,This place sucks.  The one by Roosevelt field mall is much better.  We came here for lunch at 12pm. The waitress came right away and took our orders. It took over 1 hour to get our food. The waitress didn't even come by once to see if we were ok. We were starving at this point. I ordered the chicken Madeira which i always get and absolutely love. It came and the sauce was like water and it was very bland.   Very disappointing. The one by Roosevelt field the sauce is thicker and tastier. We all got served our food and 2 people did not. We were almost finished eating when the food came out for the two people in our group. We could wait to get out of there.  I will NEVER go back there again to this location.   It wasn't even busy. Poor service and the chef sucks.
Clara S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,52,5,4.0,7/5/2017,"You all must be horrible tippers or something. I always get good service here. Next time I come though they better not put me in the outside patio area. I'm gonna DEMAND a booth!!! Service is pleasant really though. Obviously waiters are busy and they can't be stopping by every 32 seconds asking you how you're doing. My waiter seemed a bit...quiet, like he had a lot on his mind. But he made sure to be my breads, refill of breads, and refill of waters fairly quickly. I'm a very reasonable and patient person.  RECOMMEND: Cheesecake and all of their burgers.  STAY AWAY: Fire cracker salmon rolls. Cheesecake Queens, please get it together. This and the sashimi appetizer thing. I get this all the time whenever i'm in San Francisco and it is SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD. Maybe call the 4-1-5 up and ask them how they do it. I grew up on these two appetizers. Being this is the only Cheesecake in NYC, I'm gonna need them to STEP UP their appetizer game."
Melissa B.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",86,2,,1.0,8/10/2017,Omg I been to the Cheesecake Factory and this was the first time here. Omg worst service no plates no water and the food is so salty. It's not even a busy night on Thursday and it took an hour for the food. Wouldn't come back here.
Layla C.,"New York, NY",2,64,3,5.0,2/12/2017,"came here with a hungry tummy, left satisfied and happy. Wait wasnt too bad for 6pm time, i ordered the carbonara pasta was so so delicious best pasta dish ever! I finished every bite. The bread and butter was amazing too. I enjoyed this location the seating was great. My server was so nice and kind. Will come back for a hearty meal.  Wish they would open more locations, this business is a success."
Ramelle L.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",111,40,3,2.0,12/16/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is hands down one of my favorite restaurants but I was hesitant to go to this one because the city ruins everything but my mom was craving the Godiva cheesecake so we went.   The wait was 50 minutes. At the entrance of the restaurant someone had spilled frozen yogurt but no one cleaned it up. There was only one bench for people to sit and wait and someone was begging for change in that area. We were seated in this add-on area to the restaurant where the heat did not reach and had to sit with our coats on.  The waitress was extremely slow we had to look for her several times. After waiting 15 mins for silverware to butter our bread the server informed us that there was no silverware available in the entire restaurant.  The food was amazing. But again I had to wait for the waitress to bring me the condiments for my burger. My mom enjoyed her salmon salad.  Be sure to ask for your Cheesecake either in the beginning or middle of your meal so you can have it by the time you finish your food or so you can take it too go.  My conclusion was too never step foot in there again and stick to the one in Long Island, but my mom says we should give it another try... We will see."
Dianna P.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",5,2,,1.0,12/12/2016,If I can give this location half a star I would !  This has to be the worst service I have experienced at any of The Cheesecake Factory locations! Not only did my party and I wait for 2 hours while waiting we heard servers complaining about customers! Everything was just COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED! When we were seated our service was horrible we had to ask for utensils more the 5 times. Our food took about 1 hour then when I received my food it was cold. This wait staff and management were literally a shit show. Being so close to my home I really hoped for this place to be as amazing as the other restaurants have been ! Big disappointment !
Jerome W.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,"This is the worse Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. To start we were not offered any bread upon sitting down. When we asked for bread we were told none was ready and it would be brought out soon as it was done. Over 30 minutes later, we received our appetizers, still no bread. When the waiter came to remove the appetizer from the table she had bread, I excitedly said, ""Bread, thanks so much"" to which the waiter replied, ""oh no, this old bread, I picked up from another table. I will check on the bread for you"". 30 minutes later she returned and informed us that they would not be making any more bread. The food came out shortly after and it was cold. At this point we asked for the Manager, Ron. The Manager Rob informed us that the bread was a courtesy, it is only if it is available. To save cost they only make a certain amount and unfortunately there was no more for the evening. Ron continued with the nonsense of why they did not have any, I asked was cold food also the standard because he failed to address that issue. He at point said no and offered to bring out a new hot steak. However when the food came back. It was same steak sent back. SMDH!!!"
Denisse C.,"Corona, NY",0,10,4,1.0,7/19/2017,I'm going to keep it simple...no flavor in their food and the service was horrible. You better off in shack shake !
Cheryl L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,5,1.0,1/20/2017,"First time to this cheesecake factory the wait its 1 hour ... i understand its new and all but really? We got this waitress taking our drink afterwards never return with order our meals. Have a different waiter take our order but never comes out. 45 min still NOTHING!! First time your meal will be here shortly, 2nd time just look, lastly ask us your meal not here yet? I was wow table its nothing but the drink"
Bon'Hed T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,2,1.0,12/26/2016,"Went to the Queens Cheesecake Factory for the mac & cheese burger but they were out of Mac & cheese ... As disappointed as I was, that's not why I gave them the 1 star, my server brought the dirtiest most disgusting eating utensils I was ever served in a restaurant in my life. ... Not only were they not wrapped in a napkin, he held them in his bare hand. & I mean they were sticky & visibly filthy with gigantic food stains!  ... I asked a different server passing by if I could get clean utensils, she came back and just dropped another dirty set on the table with her bare hand as well. ... It took a THIRD server to finally bring a clean set wrapped in a napkin."
Aisha D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,14,10,1.0,1/20/2017,"JUST AWFUL!  I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations in Long Island and NJ and this by far has to be the absolute worst. This was my 3rd time at this location. 1st time, 2 hour wait and the food was just ok. 2nd time,  an hour long wait, I got the Steak Diane which literally tasted like someone dumped a gallon of salt on it .. and my 3rd, yesterday.. I ordered the chicken & biscuits (had this dish a least 10x before) ... My biscuit was hard and burnt, you could here the clacking sound if I hit my fork on it, then the mash potatoes (if you want to call it that) I had 3 HUGE potato chunks that were not fully cooked ( size of my biscuit) and hardly any gravy. Our waiter who was extremely nice and friendly didn't really try to resolve the problem. He apologized when I showed him everything when he came to collect the plates, but came back with no manager and the full bill. I barely touched anything on that plate. Extremely disappointed and this location is tarnishing the Cheesecake Factory brand."
Calic C.,"New York, NY",0,3,,2.0,12/3/2016,"I hope this experience here it's all because they are relatively new.  Order came backwards, meaning main plate first and then appetizers. Asked for Thai wraps with extra chicken. The extra were none. Had to ask for a manager, then got our extra chicken.  Gave us the San Pellegrino water bottles on their own, no glasses. We do not sip straight from the bottle, PLEASE! Had to ask for water glasses. Came back with a hock wine glass, really?!?! Waitress seemed sweet, everything we asked for her response was ""sure"", but failed mostly on her delivery. Has to get better. Although I'm 10 mins away, I think next time I'd rather go to the Long Island one."
Linda W.,"New York, NY",108,480,131,2.0,11/29/2016,"With the exception in Honolulu, I really can't say much for all other locations. The quality of food and service has really declined from the last time I visited the chain. My daughter was very excited upon learning the grand opening of a Cheesecake factory in NY! What 4 yr. old doesn't get excited over sweets & desserts?  The opening week was in late Oct. That was a major disappointment. It was chaotic with expected wait times to over 2 1/2 hrs. The host was overwhelmed and end up telling customers to come back next week. We end up grabbing a cheesecake for our daughter to go. And, that was a total nightmare! A single line form for ordering and another one for pick-up. Two cashiers were ringing all the customers while the pick-up line crammed all customers into the back and front of the exit doors. This push into the other line where customers were waiting to be seated. There was no management or structure whatsoever. Staff was flying all over the place. It was a zoo! We made the trip and return in the next two weeks. We ask for a table for 3. The host told us it would be a 40 minute wait. It turned into an 1 1/2 hr. wait. After you're called in when signaled on the device, you have to wait on another line to get seated. Once we were seated, the assigned waitress disappeared. As we approach one of the waitstaff for a manager. The waitress returned and gave us menus and ask if we want to place our drinks in addition to a bread basket. After our drinks were placed, she disappeared for over 20 minutes. The table across from us got seated after we did. They already got their order in with the bread basket and drinks. When she returned, she offered no apology for the wait. She hurriedly asked if we were ready to place our order. Once she took our order, she was gone! We had to flag her twice to ask for utensils and bread. Regular utensil was given to our daughter that is 4. She could barely manage with the big silverware.  The food was ok. I had the salmon. The sides were drenched in butter. My daughter had the chicken sliders with the fries. The sliders were less than appetizing. The chicken seem to have been left in the fryer for awhile. My husband had the burger with a salad. He was given fries instead. Normally, we would had asked to speak to a supervisor/manager on the side. Unfortunately, no one appears to know who the manager is as staff frantically runs back and forth. With our waitress disappearing half of the night, it was nearly impossible to address anything. We placed the last order for dessert- an ice cream sundae for our daughter and a cheesecake to go. Our waitress again hurriedly put the check on our table. We did not ask for the check since we were waiting for the dessert. The ice cream sundae had 3 scoops of vanilla and huge dollops of whipped cream. There was no hot fudge or cherry on top that kinda thing for a kid. We concluded this visit was the worse that you can possibly get from a waitress. I don't think we plan on returning!  A side note to management: please slow down the pace with the staff in the restaurant! It causes the environment to be more hectic and frantic than it really is. There are enough tables to seat everyone. It has to be addressed and organized better. It would nice for the waitstaff to remember and check in their tables once in awhile. The front has to be managed better for pick-up orders. Form a line to the side and have another cashier pack up the order so that it's ready instead of ringing customers back and forth. And, the wait times have to be managed better, give a more accurate wait time to the customers. This gives customers a false pretense that it's this amount of time when it's closer to 2 hrs. or more."
Joy K.,"Hollis, NY",449,6,2,1.0,7/18/2017,Gotta be the worst service I have ever had in my life. We wait a hour for our food and a hour and a half on silver wear. Absolutely horrible. Go to the one in west bury and I work in this mall never coming back
Amber P.,"New York, NY",37,8,5,3.0,1/27/2017,"Got in at 8:15. Seated by 9:15 - 4 people Friday night.  Water took about 15 minutes, so did the bread. Drinks were good! But they did take another 15 minutes. I personally ordered the herb Parmesan crusted chicken. Food took about 45 minutes to come out, the manager stopped by and apologized for the wait. My chicken was cold as were the mashed potatoes and string beans. The flavors were spot on but the service and wait times really hampered the experience."
Michelle R.,"Staten Island, NY",10,7,3,1.0,8/1/2017,"Horrible service. I arrived at 6:30 pm with a party of 8 to celebrate my mother's birthday. We weren't seated until 7:30. We didn't receive the appetizer until 8:15 and the entrees came at 9:00 pm   Our server Lamar forgot to come back and check in on us. He saw me struggling to get a selfie group photo and didn't even offer to take a picture. My daughter's chicken fingers were burnt. My mother's food was served cold. My step father""s steak was medium rare not medium well the way he requested. We had to wait so long for water refills. It seemed our waiter had too many tables. It really was the worst Cheesecake Factory experience we have ever had. And today is my mother's birthday. The worst experience. Oh, to top it off, we saw a roach crawling out of the booth. I told the manager and they comped the meal. We left. No birthday cake. Just left."
Jianna M.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,33,22,2.0,8/6/2017,"I don't understand why so many people in line for this, I know this is the only fancy restaurant in the neighborhood, but the food, service, and long wait for everything is totally not worth the time. If there is another option, I can already see the future of this."
Janice W.,"Bellerose, NY",1,60,23,1.0,12/22/2016,"Service here is atrocious. Our waitress was very nice but very absentminded. My friends and I placed our order only to have her come back 25 minutes later to claim that she would check with the back to see what was going on. The thing is that we ordered the Seared Tataki Tuna Salad, which shouldn't have taken incredibly long to make. Nonetheless, we watched as other people who came in after us receiving their orders before us. Mind you, we came in about 15 minutes after they opened! The salad was pretty good and refreshing, nothing to write home about but satisfying enough. The menu is crazy long, practically like a book but I immediately flipped to the cheesecake section. My friends and I went for the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and that was honestly the only highlight of our visit. That one slice of cheesecake could be split between 2 people!! It was just so creamy and the salted caramel layer at the top balanced the cream cheese portion nicely. I loved that the crust was nice and moist too! And the fact that there was little flakes of salt to provide that extra crunch was the cherry on top. A little side note: I asked the waitress to bring out the cheesecake as soon as she took my plate away because we were running late on time. She came back to the table to collect everyone else's dishes 10 minutes later and asked if we had placed an order for the cheesecake already.  Service is definitely lacking here. Such a disappointment. Come for the cheesecake but be prepared to be very patient if you order entrees too."
Kevin V.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",125,89,170,3.0,1/16/2017,The Cheesecake Factory was a decent visit. The service was ok and the menu quite extensive. The wait was quite long for a chain restaurant. The seating itself was a little Close to Other people's tables it kind of felt like you were sitting with other people it was so close. Maybe it was the time I was there I'd like to try it once more at a different time to see if it's a better experience. It's definitely worth another try just for the food.
