Adriana I.,"Binghamton, NY",283,7,5,5.0,11/1/2016,"I had an absolutely wonderful time here with Matt and Andrew! Both bartenders were extremely attentive and made sure our glasses were never empty! My mom and I had the guac which we absolutely loved! It was fresh and flavorful! We also had the potstickers, chicken sliders and shrimp spring rolls everything was amazing!! We were hesitant to come since Cheesecake Factory is new to our neighborhood but I have to say I was impressed! Thank you for the great time!!"
Jia C.,"Manhattan, NY",5,22,,1.0,12/20/2016,"This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory ever. Let me just say the service was great. I think my server's name was either Isis or Iris and she was awesome and accommodating. She made honest recommendations about the food when asked and brought us multiple fresh bread baskets. So, why the one star review? The food left so much to be desired. Honestly, the tuna tartare we got was over seasoned and that detracted from the quality of the fish. Also, the lemon garlic shrimp pasta and steak medallions were very under seasoned. The only saving grace of the meal were the fresh bread and few bites of mashed potato under my steak.  I wish I was less underwhelmed by my experience but... suffice to say, I don't think I will be dining here again."
Herbert F.,"Woodhaven, NY",0,22,,2.0,3/30/2017,"Annoyances that have nothing to do with the quality of the food: 1) You have to pay for parking here. Pretty much $5. 2) At 4 p.m., they were out of both of our first choices. 3) They were out of my wife's second choice. They are open from 11:30 till 11:00, so 7 hours to go and they are out of God knows how  many things. 4) Once served, five different staff members came by within the first 7-8 minutes to ask if 'everything is ok?'.  Really annoying. 5) They have a ridiculous amount of different types of cheesecake, but no pineapple cheesecake, which is a staple here in NYC. Blueberry, strawberry, pineapple, cherry and plain are the norm mostly anywhere. Come to think of it, I don't remember seeing blueberry either.... THE FOOD Philly cheese steak was extraordinarily greasy. I LIKE a greasy chees steak, but this was dripping in grease. There was probably no more than 2 ozs. of steak on the sandwich. For $13, I expected more. The steak did taste good though, what little there was of it. My wife's salad was ok, nothing to write home about, but acceptable. Haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in 10 years, just reminded myself why."
Anjellica P.,"Queens, NY",76,3,,5.0,11/30/2016,"This was my first experience going to any Cheesecake factory. The location is so convinent and easy to get to. Expecting a long wait, it was only 30 mins for 2 people and a manager walked up to us and said if we want there are two spaces open at the bar. So we were immediately seated which was great! The bartender Terri was really sweet, attentive and courteous. Our long island iced teas were DELICIOUS and she made them with obvious expertise. We were a bit annoying, asking for things like napkins, the menu back and utensils but she got them to us right away. The decor and amtmosphere was really really nice for a chain resturant. I was expecting an applebees type of vibe and it was more of a fancy 5 star in manhatten type of place. The bar was stacked and gorgeous. The mashed potato tots were delicious and the firecracker shrimp was just tiny fried shrinp w a delicious chipotle aioli. I ordered the southern fried catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, green beans and remoulade. Amazing!!! Very large porportions! I got three pieces of fish a healthy serving of mash and the remoulade was fantastic. The absolute star of the night was definitely rhe mac and cheese though!! Me and my friend were raving about it all night. It was cheesy, crispy and flavorful. Honestly AMAZING. The whole experience was really awesome. Great food, service and atmosphere. I will definitely go back."
Alvin G.,"Douglaston, Queens, NY",1,12,23,1.0,12/17/2016,Waitress forgot to put in our order and we had to wait additional 20 min on top of the 30 min we already waited. My shepherd pie was so salty and burnt. Even a wait for the drinks were long..something is wrong with this service.
Sandra D.,"Queens, NY",184,60,1149,5.0,11/15/2016,Great atmosphere large menu selection you can order just about anything. Comfotable setting fast and friendly service. Don't forget dessert Cheescake to die for.
Beatriz M.,"JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY",4,51,6,1.0,10/31/2016,"Horrible experience! Waited 1hr to get a table, 1hr and half to get the food and 20min to get cheesecake to go. When we were asking where was the food after 40min they kept saying it will be ready in 10min. No one came to us to apologize the long wait we had to ask for the manager which he only said ""it not your fault I will go get your food right now"". Frozen cheesecake, burn food and long wait. So unprofessional, absolutely no sense of costumer service. Everyone here need more training. Never again!"
Vicky C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",5,72,5,4.0,10/26/2016,"The gods have answered Queens residents' prayers! My friend and I came for lunch on opening day, and we were very impressed with the service and the neatly organized layout. We were told 20 minutes but seated in 10 minutes. Our server was on point and courteous. We didn't want to eat huge entrees, so we ordered 3 small plates/appetizers: chicken samosas, crab bites and the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls. All were great but I liked the crab bites the best. We shared the pumpkin pecan cheesecake, and it was divine. Complimentary warm bread and butter were great too. Yelpers, we no longer have to trek to Long Island."
Vicky M.,"Green Brook Township, NJ",134,13,2,1.0,1/15/2017,"We are still sitting in the restaurant. I ordered the skinnylicious shrimp, angel hair pasta and asparagus. I understand the pasta portion is supposed to be smaller, but it was barely two bites worth. The ""sauce"" was watery and the presentation was not appetizing. I sent it back and did not want a replacement because the rest of my party was almost finished eating. The manager cocked her head to the side like a dog and basically looked like my concerns were not valid. My husband's mashed potatoes were raw. They came and took the plate and gave him new mashed potatoes but they were also raw. His chicken was cold, but he ate it anyway. I included a picture of a massive piece of raw potato. I would not recommend this location. The wait staff ignores you and doesn't make eye contact. Drive to Long Island."
Andy Y.,"Pearland, TX",80,24,12,4.0,1/24/2017,Ordered takeout.  Had a good experience -- but had a very long wait time. The wait time for sit down looked to be over an hour judging by the size of the line...crazy!! The cheesecakes were on point as always though.
Nakeeta W.,"New York, NY",22,96,8,2.0,7/5/2017,"So we were looking for something to do during the holiday and decided to stop in to Cheesecake Factory in the Queens Center Mall.  We had never gone there so it was exciting to be in the area.  Lots of families, shopping and smiling faces.  My partner quickly went in to try to get us a seat.  There was a 20 minute wait which is very usual for this entity.  When we get called, we go to the table and the hostess stopped us short, ""oh it hasn't been cleaned...please wait here"" so I waited with my 2 year old itching to get free, standing behind a family of eight(8) who had just been served trying to eat their food. ""look away"" I tell myself....its rude..Anyway - the hostess returns, 3 minutes or so later and says ok - its ready.  So we plop down and wait.  Maybe 5 minutes or so a server appears.  ""hey, has anyone acknowledged your table?"" , we look ""uh- no"" ; he deep sighs ""okay, then ill be your server""  like he was doing us this favor.  We emphatically replied ""OK!"" Im going to cut to the chase with this, story.  He was clearly overworked with too many tables then started calling my partner ""brother"" toward the end...I was thinking ""is this for the tip""  lol  he doesn't have to do all that.   He was truly a NICE guy and good server too (ok fine yes he was also hot looking), but he was also new and the restaurant was busy.  He forgot my flatware, napkin, my babys entrée, my drink, the plates for bread, the bread, to offer dessert..but he got it together.   Its not totally his fault - he didnt have a backing him up.  Ultimately -  Slowly but surely he took care of us  - and even provided a sample of cucumber lemonade.  I will say - in Washington, DC the Wisconsin Avenue location is much bigger and much if not more busy and this has NEVER happened.   Still in all  the absolute worst part of this entire experience was - THE FOOD!  The firecracker  salmon rolls were greasy as I don't know what, they served it with a head of regular cabbage eh....they ran out of fried shrimp so my partner had to figure out some other dish..(we learned this wayy after we put our order in). the mac and cheese I ordered for my baby had no cheese in it.  It had some cheese coating at the bottom of the bowl...I had to stir it up and it was still dry.   I asked for grilled chicken strips on top.  They provided chicken chunks (about 6) in the mac and cheese.  I was not paying for that.  The server didn't argue.  My salmon and asparagus was good, but the mashed potatoes had a piece of potato that wasn't properly boiled inside..My partner had the Jamaican Black Shrimp.  All that money TCF makes and they didn't put large shrimp in this dish? Weird...and cheap.   Did I mention we had to wait an extra five minutes to eat because my babys food wasn't served with ours? Cucumber lemonade tasted (great).  or that the bread ""was in the oven"" and we had to wait.  All the while im thinking - cmon man, at least have the bread ready. During our meal a Hostess came back to seat someone next to us when our neighbors left.  Same thing happened. (table was dirty)  But instead of being ushered off to the side they stood over the table while she wiped the table off onto the floor...again no flatware...nothing......I also noticed  many tables complaining to the manager.  In fact - when  I went to the bathroom I could see in the kitchen someone was wearing a dangling chain preparing food (hows that for unsanitary) I hate to present problems without solutions so I will give my highest recommendation that TCF corporate get in there and retrain the house staff or change the managerial staff completely.  The back and front of the house is a mess.   It is very poorly managed and it shows in daily operations and in the food.  Ultimately degrading the brand so many have come to love. Do not eat here."
David L.,"Bronx, NY",13,110,5,2.0,11/7/2016,Basically: 1 hour+ wait for 4 people. Sit down. Just ate cheesecake cuz we went to Shake Shack next door in the meantime. First time. Lunch Sunday. Okay Godiva. Not my favorite but definitely downable bite by bite even by a person who don't like chocolate mousse. Chocolate in the middle pure heaven.
Nav S.,"Queens, NY",0,3,1,5.0,10/25/2016,"I am so happy that this place has opened up close by.  To start off the staff is wonderful, like the best customer service I have ever experienced. Everyone is super friendly and courteous. The place was nice and clean. The food was just perfect. The portions were generous and filling. The chicken madeira really was extraordinary...soft tender and delicious. The appetizers were really large almost a meal by themselves. Overall wonderful experience and so happy such a wonderful restaurant has opened here. From service to food everything was spot on."
Sofie S.,"Shippensburg, PA",4,114,26,3.0,11/25/2016,"Usually go to the long Island location. Decided to try this one since it's closer and just opened.  The wait was long and the entrance was too crowded so we decided to eat at the bar.  The food is the same as the Long Island location.  The waitress and bartender who helped us were extremely personable. They ran out of some things which left us disappointed. Also, the chicken pot stickers had way too much garlic and were almost inedible.  Overall I'd really recommend going to the Long Island location as opposed to this one. The space is significantly smaller with an equal if not larger clientele base.  There is absolutely no direction upon entering ; it's a literal clusterf*ck. I learned only later from the servers that as you enter, pickup orders (from the app) are to the right, reservations are directly ahead, and something else is to the left. When entering, you're literally in a giant, overcrowded space wondering what the hell is going on. The Long Island location has clearer directives on where to go and not nearly as crowded when you enter; they've also never ran out of things I've ordered so I assume they're run better.... Just go there if you can and avoid Queens Center Mall altogether"
Mo A.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",0,12,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Service was terrible, gave us bad drinks, and food was awful. They were so slow overall. Has the nerve to ask for tip. Don't recommend this awful place! Updated review: Forget this place completely. This location brings shame to Cheesecake Factory in other places. They don't have any appetizers or entrees we want and when we ordered other entrees and appetizers they were oily and tasted old. The drinks are seltzer water basically. Close this place down for the love of god."
Victor L.,"Queens, NY",43,7,13,5.0,12/17/2016,"This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and it will not be my last. I enjoy the food,drinks and service. The waitress was very helpful, she showed my girlfriend and I the best service we have ever had at a restaurant. The drinks that we ordered were perfect, strong and enjoyable. I would recommend this place to everyone."
Kiesha B.,"New York, NY",5,131,58,1.0,11/18/2016,Never thought people who work in restaurants could be so malicious to other human beings. Went here with a guy last night to have dinner. Orders garlic pasta with shrimps. As i am eating my food I bit down on something hard. Don't know what it was. Then I ask the waitress to package my food to take home. Here I am about to dig in to my cheese cake and look WTF I see.. a big portion of cheesed cake dug out . I am so disgusted and confused. Like why why would you want to do something so evil and wicked to someone who you don't know. Who has never done anything to you. I promise you I will never go back here. Trust and believe the manager will be hearing from me.
Steven L.,"Queens Village, NY",108,28,54,3.0,10/22/2016,"I came here to experience a pre opening dinner. The sever was very attentive but he can work on meal placement. Don't place the drinks on top of the meals and if the appetizers are not finished don't bring the entrees. I had the buffalo blasts for my appetizer which was a different take on a buffalo wing. I recommend having the boneless option. For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo it wasn't bad but the rice was hard. The beer that I was served had a lot of foam, but overall it was not bad."
Amina-Louise J.,"San Diego, CA",94,145,403,4.0,12/22/2016,"APPETIZER  The Thai Lettuce Wraps - were simply amazing! We cleared the plate but left the purple cabbage leaf ""boats""! PASTA Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta - this was very hearty and satisfying. And yet again I cleared my plate.  SERVICE Friendly but a tad slow with bringing out the dishes. This is a popular restaurant so I can understand they must be busy. Our waitress was lovely and attended to us with second helpings of bread!  Overall, I always really like coming to the Cheesecake Factory and I'm sure I will be visiting this location soon, except on a weekend because the wait is an hour!"
Simmone L.,"ASTORIA, NY",7,7,5,1.0,5/29/2017,"I ordered the SALMON and instead I got served SALMONELLA. I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the FIRST and LAST time today, at this specific location and I ended leaving LIVID. I came to this establishment in which I ordered the ""The Herb Crusted Salmon"". I expected my entree to be FULLY COOKED but to my SURPRISE, my entree WASN'T even FULLY COOKED. First and foremost if it wasn't for ME being as attentive to my food and being an individual who actually picks through their food when they go out to eat, I wouldn't had caught this DANGEROUS problem with my food. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should a customer be served  RAW/RARE/ UNDERCOOKED food especially POULTRY & FISH. I came to this establishment ordering and expecting FULLY COOKED SALMON not SASHIMI. I understand that sometimes people make mistakes but seriously NOT THROUGHLY cooking SALMON is RIDICULOUS and a very DANGEROUS mistake to make indeed. Imagine the HELL I would've been going through within 24-48 hours because of someone's careless mistakes. Possibly could've ended up in the ER for food poisoning and I already suffer from a gastrointestinal disease. Consuming improperly handled food with my disease can make me 10 times sicker then the average person if I would've consumed it. This is the EXACT reason why I pick through and I am attentive with my food. Even the waiter the agreed that the Salmon wasn't ""COOKED"".  Salmon isn't even all that difficult to cook, also chefs should be THROUGHLY inspecting the food that is being prepared before putting it up to the pass to give to the server for the guest. Although the waiter did give me the option to re-fire the entree I refused because for one it's salmon, it shouldn't have to be re-fired it's not a steak that wasn't cooked correctly and also if you couldn't cook correctly the FIRST TIME how can I expect you to cook it correctly the second time. I CAN'T TRUST THAT. Moving forward I will NOT be returning to this ESTABLISHMENT."
