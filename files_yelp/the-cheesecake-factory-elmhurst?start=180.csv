Anacelia G.,"New York, NY",110,9,14,5.0,1/7/2017,"We had an hour wait at the cheesecake factory which was not bad. We were given an alerting device that would let us know when our table would be ready. And it works only on the same floor as the restaurant. Luckily, the mall is huge with alot of stores to see so we just walked around the store for about 50 minutes. The last 10 minutes we came back to the floor and the device went off right on time.  I ordered shrimp and chicken with mashed Potatoe (can't think of the name) and my cousin got the 4 cheese pasta-super good. We enjoyed our meal and would definitely come again."
Rasha J.,"Manhattan, NY",37,45,131,3.0,11/8/2016,"oh boy, I'm rating this by service.  As usual, the servers are new and training, understandably, but below par!! asked for coffee twice, kids chicken strips came last and late. the chicken strips should've been the easiest to get out to the table.  we spent almost two hours in our meal, which waiting time is spent the most out of those hours.  i think management is the problem. they are the ""promising"" things like' this n that is coming', but nothing. seriously!?! hopefully they get better....... ok the manager came at spoke to us and apologized for the late kids chicken. she insisted to take the strips out of the bill. good gesture."
Julie T.,"Queens, NY",7,56,16,4.0,4/3/2017,"My first time to a Cheesecake Factory! For a Saturday night, it's a brutal wait. We were told about 10 minutes, but it was much, much longer. I want to say nearly an hour - but you can't expect much when you're relying on customers to finish and leave. It's nearly 8pm and they're having a good time. It's a good sign when the guests don't want to leave! But they should provide a more realistic wait time. It was very helpful with the hostess updated me with how many tables were ahead of me when I asked. That gave me a good idea of what I was in for. We were seated in the outer section, street view. It's closed off from the main dining area, much quieter, kind of loved it.  I forgot our server's name, but she was the most pleasant. Whoever you are with your Star Wars tie: you're wonderful and don't change.  The food is certainly better than what I expect from a chain. Their loaded potato tots are like miniature baked potatoes in your mouth. The burger buns were perfectly toasted and so fluffy. I think that was the most impressive of the burger. Love a good bun. Now for the cheesecake. We ordered to go because the way I feel about cheesecake should not be displayed in public places. With that said, their Oreo Extreme cheesecake is so delicious. Adam's Reese's is also great, but it's much heavier, probably because of the caramel. If you want to try their cheesecakes, go all out. No need to play it safe with the classic. These signatures are signatures for a reason.  Bring your patience, plan ahead. If you look them up on Google Maps, it'll show you the busy level by the hour. For a weekend night, though? Be prepared to wait OR go earlier."
Jennifer V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,,2.0,2/20/2017,"Disappointed, we approximately spent 3 to 4 hours in there. To just get our food took an hour if not more and when we finally got our food the plates were extremely hot and I burned my hand. It was not what we were expecting. The server that took our order came to our table literally 3 times didn't even offer us water or came to see if our food was ok. The only good thing were the cocktails.  P.s bathroom lights are way too low it was so hard to do a diaper change."
Linda B.,"Bronx, NY",193,14,3,5.0,5/29/2017,"I was super shocked and disappointed to say the least when I read The Cheesecake Factory got two and a half stars on average, but I take reviews with a grain of salt, and I am so glad I did. I had to write my review today. I had a FIVE STAR experience! This location is the newest of the chain, and so beautiful and spacious. My best friend and I went for my post birthday lunch earlier today when I told her The Cheesecake Factory had opened in Elmhurst a few months ago. This was a big deal for many who enjoy The Cheesecake Factory, but there aren't any locations near where we live, until now! HOORAY!!! We reached about 12:15pm, and were greeted very friendly and were seated right away, They  have an enclosed outside portion and that was NICE!! I was so excited as we  got to see outside. Our server was Lajae C. and she was very pretty and awesome, and attentive to being our server.  She highly recommended the grilled Salmon with the mashed potatoes and broccoli, and I love salmon, but what a menu, it was so hard to decide on what to eat, it looked all good. I liked the fact the menus were smaller in size than a few years ago when I last ate at The Cheesecake Factory, and so many choices to choose from. They also have Gluten Free options. Server after server were passing by with huge platters for other guests. You couldn't help but stare and ask what is that?? I decided on the salmon, and my friend had this massively huge burrito which was delicious! My salmon did not disappoint, it was cooked very well, tasted as good as the salmon I had when I was visiting the Dominican Republic last month. My mashed potatoes were nicely seasoned and flavorful. The broccoli was also nicely steamed, firm and tasty. The description on the menu didn't do the sides justice. I wish I took photos, but I will next time. Their tea selection was also impressive. I had the chamomile Lemon tea and she also let me take another tea, the Orange and black tea flavor. I also had the strawberry lemonade that was SWEET and delicious, I had to water it down a few times, but was able to share with my friend. There was sugar on the rim also which was a cool touch!  Then dessert time came, my friend didn't have dessert because she was full with the amazing burrito and had some to take home too! But I had to have a cheesecake, move over delicious salmon in my tummy!! Lajae recommended the Dream Oreo Supreme, but I wanted to take a look at  my other options since I haven't had their cheesecake in a long time, and OMG, OH BOY, they all looked decadent! I chose the Dream Oreo cheesecake and it was to LIVE for!!!! They have actually whole Oreo cookies inside of the cheesecake layer. Is your mouth salivating yet? Lol!! It was so yummy, and they even put Oreo pieces in the whipped cream and a giant Oreo on the side. I had ordered it to go, but had to have some while I was there. Boy that was GOOD! They even have a Happy Hour, so I got to go back and check it out.  I was very pleased with our experience! and recommend this location. Yes, this is The Cheesecake Factory, so you should expect a wait to be seated, we didn't have that today, but this location is worth the wait. Would you eat a restaurant that was empty and only sound you hear is the sound of crickets? Seriously? I would definitely and absolutely go back to The Cheesecake Factory in Elmhurst to try the other dishes. The prices are reasonable and the value you get with the food and large portions are fantastic. The ambiance was great. I really enjoyed sitting in the outer space as it was not as boisterous as inside, and they have a cool window that actually tilt open to let the air in, but that's expected when you have happy guests eating delicious food. That's awesome Feng Shui in my book, and I should know, I am a Feng Shui Expert (wink wink, shameless plug!). Thank you Lajae, I hope to have you as my server again, and keep up the great work! Thank you The Cheesecake Factory for a wonderful meal and time with my friend, you have a grateful customer and fan. God bless!!!"
Alyse S.,"Rego Park, NY",91,30,2,1.0,4/29/2017,"OK where to begin.. I would give 1/2 a star if I could. First they tried to seat me where there was no air conditioning on an 80 degree day without asking. They move us to another table. Fine. We get greeted by the first waitress 1:10PM. She takes our drink order. Within minutes, she brings over another waitress. She explains that her allergies are bothering her and she is going to take a break. Not a prob. The 2nd waitress asks what we would like to eat. I ask her a couple of questions and explain that I can not eat any spicy food as well as explain my food allergies.  I ask if the BBQ Chicken Pizza was spicy she answers not to me but then again I am Mexican so nothing is spicy to me. Uh really?? Anyway I said how about the Pepperoni Pizza? She answers oh no that is not spicy at all.. I ordered that as a lunch special with a side salad. She tells me that it is a garden salad but for $1.00 more, I could upgrade to a Caesar Salad. I said sure, sounds great. My son orders a pasta dish. It is now 2:00PM by the time the food comes. I take a bite of the pizza and the pepperoni is spicy. It took 10 minutes to get her attention. I tell her I am sorry but this is too spicy for me. She asks with attitude if I would like something else. I tell her no because I do not feel like waiting almost another hour for food. She says OK I will take it off the bill I said great.  At this point because of her attitude, she just really started pissing me off so I asked for a manager she's like OK I will get one for you. I wait 10 minutes nothing. Now the original waitress comes back to me and said is there a problem I said yes I would like to speak to a manager. Another 10 minutes goes by. Finally I asked someone else I'd like to speak to a manager. By the time the manager comes to the table it is now 3 o'clock. He apologizes I tell him everything that happens and he offers to take it off the bill. I said yes absolutely that would be great. I get the bill and now they are charging me $10.95 for a side Caesar salad. My head is a back to explode at this point from all the incompetence and I'm experiencing. I asked for a manager again and he comes over and he has taken it off the bill. Then he offers me something else and I said no I don't want anything he said maybe a piece of cheesecake on us I said sure. I get the bill back and now the waitress has charged me for the cheesecake which was supposed to be free as per the manager.  I finally started yelling at the original waitress that came over and said really this is all ridiculous the service was horrible, the food was horrible and I want the bill corrected. She sends back the original waitress with the corrected bill. I ask the waitress for a copy of the voided receipt and tell her please don't take forever. She says to me be patient with an attitude. Finally another manager comes over to me with the corrected bill and a copy of the original receipt. I said to her your staff is rude, the food is horrible and I will never be back here. It is sad because I have been there before and I used to like it. Eat here at your own risk.. Just know that you will not be served on time, the staff is rude and don't expect a manager to come over right away if you have a complaint. I will never ever eat here again!!!"
Michelle M.,"REGO PARK, NY",120,12,5,5.0,10/29/2016,"Great food, and most importantly the service was wonderful. All though the wait was an hour and 20 min, but it was expected. Great place , definitely worth going. You don't want to miss out! Food: Greek Salad, it was great.  Fried zucchini was alright, not the greatest, the smell of it irritated me, but it was okay. Margarita pizza, delicious. Alfredo pasta, it was alright."
Ester C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,29,67,4.0,7/1/2017,"Service was slow but food was good. The California salad surprised me so much, it was without a doubt the best salad I've had in my whole life for a strapping 800 calories. The guacamole was great and the veggies were nice and fresh. Although the coffee was absolute trash and was very acetone tasting, I'd definitely go back for the food but leave out the drinks."
Tatyana N.,"Rego Park, NY",37,73,25,5.0,6/25/2017,The food here is amazing but very expensive. Drinks are so overpriced. Like 12$ for a cocktail. I'm only rating it five stars for the amazing food.
Liliana C.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",9,26,12,5.0,11/5/2016,Service was good the food was pretty good drinks ok no crazy about it. ...but they do deserve 5 start
Cindi S.,"Flushing, NY",122,24,33,3.0,11/23/2016,"Very nice location, but I don't dare think I'd try my luck at getting a table in under an hour. The cheesecake is divine, and usually takes 15-30 minutes to get a to go slice depending on the day and time you drop by. A valid tip for those who are planning to visit; do expect to wait, and don't blame the staff for how long it takes to seat! they can't rush patrons out, so when they apologize and say they're doing their best, don't be rude and hasty because it's not their fault. I've been here about 6 times so far for cheese cake pick ups for my coworkers, and each time there's an argument about something inevitable. Everyone's excited about this place, so expect the wait that comes with it!  Also, to the woman who says a piece of her slice was eaten, it looks like a tiny piece came off a connected slice lol. I don't think anyone would go through weeks of training to blow their job over something like that."
Derek M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,29,,1.0,5/3/2017,"I called to place an order for takeout, and I was placed on hold. I remained on hold for 15 minutes, which gave me enough time to actually arrive to the restaurant and stand in line for takeout. When it was my turn to order, the individual behind the register walked away, and I remained standing there for a couple minutes until I decided to leave and go elsewhere. I understand that the takeout server was very busy, but as the phone was ringing, I didn't notice anyone attempting to answer, and I wasn't impressed by the hostess on duty bc not only was I not greeted, but I also had to interrupt her socializing with a waiter to ask a question, and she directed me to stand in the wrong line to place a takeout order. At the end of the day, this is a reflection of poor management, and it's a shame bc it's a beautiful restaurant and I've dined here many times in the past. Y'all, get it together."
Erica D.,"Oviedo, FL",66,13,2,5.0,4/11/2017,"Let me tell you something Jenny the bartender is AMAZINGGGG!!! My best friend and I came here for happy hour and she hooked us all the way up!!! She deserves a raise!!!! Food was great and she was professional, personable. Definitely coming back again"
Zad K.,"Queens, NY",68,21,57,4.0,11/29/2016,"Exquisite ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"". My all-time favorite! What I come for each time. They don't do it wrong here. They really strive for perfection. I also had the ""Avocado Eggrolls"" for appetizer. It was certainly fresh and tasteful. They use avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper. The tamarind-cashew dipping sauce adds a flavorful touch to say the least and I would add that it's just right with its saltiness. The atmosphere here is intimate and relaxing! Service is commendable. It's high time NYC got its own Cheesecake Factory spot. I'm very grateful. Good job, guys!"
T E.,"Manhattan, NY",3,28,9,2.0,5/20/2017,"I was so excited to eat here after hearing everyone I know talk about the food. I decide to have lunch here with my husband for a belated Mother's day meal. His Bacon Bacon burger was really good(according to him), but the Bang Bang Shrimp and chicken left a lot to be desired. I've eaten this dish at an actual Thai restaurant and it was much more flavorful. Cheesecake's version was bland. The Blood Orange mojito was on point, though. The service was ok so if I go back I'll get the burger he had."
Annie R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,3,,1.0,8/31/2017,"My overall experience was terrible. There weren't a lot of customers so I was seated fairly quickly. While waiting for the waiter, I noticed that both my fork and spoon were dirty, it wasn't clean and there was food stuck to it. I also asked for ginger ale but they said they ran out. They also said they ran out of bread and they were making more, therefore the bread came out after the main dishes. The main dishes were okay, I had the hibachi steak and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. When I asked for the check, the waiter billed me for the ginger ale that they ran out of and when they fixed it, they also gave me someone else's check with my check. I wouldn't recommend coming here."
R S.,"New York, NY",7,15,4,1.0,1/16/2017,Well unless you want to wait 1:30hr to be sitting.  No enough seat to wait. Them place is 2 small n dark.  2 many restaurants around to  waiste time n this one.  Good luck.
Sid S.,"Manhattan, NY",12,7,,1.0,4/14/2017,"Ok , not a place for steaks , not a place for Italian . I think this place has an identity crisis. Serves everything but nothing . We ordered steak , I like them Medium , got a burnt steak , messed up my side as well . Ordered corn got beans ... funny , they don't even rhyme to make a mistake . They redid my steak , mind u I had to wait another 15 mins n nibble from my family's dishes . The steak was perfectly cooked thins time but I have to say , it was the most flavorless steak I be had in my life !! My wife's chicken Marsala was the same story , dry , with no sauce , flat pieces of chicken . My daughter ordered lemon garlic chicken , equally bland . My mai tai was a saving grace . Margaritas forget about it . My wife who happens to be a margarita aficionado hates her top shelf ultimate margarita as well so much so that she ordered sugar syrup lol .  Buy their cheesecake to go !! Go home n enjoy , don't waste your time here !"
Kat L.,"New York, NY",0,25,5,5.0,1/14/2017,"Visited this location today, really nice, everyone was courteous and very sweet.  Food was excellent!!  Loved the Shrimp Scampi!! Wait time was very reasonable - will visit again!!!"
