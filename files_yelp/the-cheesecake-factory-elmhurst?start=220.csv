Evelyn C.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",20,16,15,3.0,3/19/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory but why they discontinue my favorites? ....still good though...always busy from open to close. Love their food and service but i don't have patience waiting super long. Just saying....
jeanie s.,"Richmond Hill, NY",0,2,,1.0,5/14/2017,"We were very excited to try this place but experience was totally NEGATIVE!! Not only that Waiting time was sooo long, the service desk staff was nasty!! Despite all that we ended up taking take out only to find out that food was just average, in fact below average taste!  Only good thing was staff at take out desk, at least they were helpful vs the service desk where they were not just nasty but visibly discriminating!!!!"
Justin D.,"Woodside, NY",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Long wait time, with an even longer serve time. The food is decent with a jumpy waiter.  Ordered with 5 people and couldn't seat us in about 20 minutes. And this isn't even in peak hours. Although everything else was mediocre, the cheesecake was something to look forward throughout the dinner."
Chevelle W.,"Long Island City, NY",2,19,6,1.0,1/30/2017,This is my second time visiting Cheesecake Factory and it was messy the first time but I said this is a new opening. But this second visit put the nail on the coffin. The waitress and waiters are not pleasant portions was smaller. I was sitting in the booth where the waiter and waitresses do the billing transactions and heard all of their conversations over my mom conversation smh very loud . Then I went to get my slices of cheesecake and the girl who was serving the cheesecake to go was touching the cheesecake and everything else never changed her gloves and at the end she rubbed her hands on her pants like a dirty chef . I will not be returning I will just drive further out to Long Island for better services. Also cheesecake was old I told my mom not to eat it .
Mattheo K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",66,1,,1.0,5/11/2017,Service was poor..fiod was mediocre at best and the experience was overall frustrating
Leela K.,"Queens, NY",0,4,,4.0,5/8/2017,Crowded but good food. Pricy but huge menu. Some time there's a long wait. Other than that friendly service. Clean location. If you love cheese cake it's a must place to visit. But for me I also like there full menu and other desserts as well. If the prices were a little bit more reasonable I would have visited there more often.
Sassy P.,"New York, NY",0,9,,5.0,5/5/2017,"We love this restaurant. Its been a few years since we've been to a cheesecake factory restaurant.  We will definitely come back . We had 2 appetizers, the eggroll sampler and the hot spinach & cheese dip. These were both over the top delicious.  I had the Thai coconut-lime chicken. This was so good I was licking the plate clean, no shame. lol. My daughter had the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. That was delicious as well. The wait time was literally 5 minutes then we were seated. The waiter was so friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu. We grilled him extensively because it had been so long since we had been to this restaurant. But he was very gracious and accommodating. I cant wait until our next trip to this wonderful and beautiful restaurant"
Mel M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,2.0,9/18/2017,"I've been to the one located by queens center mall before and I've had great experiences in the past, but the last time I stopped by was just annoying. There was a change with the server half way through our visit. Our waitress' shift was over and we were given this other waiter. He wasn't very nice, but that's beside the point. I've always paid credit, but decided to pay cash this time. I gave a $10 tip even though the total came up to way more than I expected, but I still think he deserved a tip.  When my parents and I got up to leave, the waiter told us to hold on. He counted the money and said the tip should be $22 more than what we gave him... $22 is more than a meal there. It was just ridiculous. He didn't deserve a $32 tip, but he made it seem like it was mandatory.  The 15% suggested tip on the receipt is a suggestion! I don't think I'm going back there anymore. We're actually very upset about everything. He made the whole afternoon awkward and uncomfortable after we'd just had a nice meal."
Julie C.,"New York, NY",80,3,,1.0,1/29/2017,The service was just plain horrible. We had to ask for bread 3 times. We also had to ask for cutlery which took forever so we had to spread the butter with our hands. When the cutlery finally came it was covered in food and crusty. We had to ask THREE people for cutlery to the point where our food had come out and we had to wait to eat it. The fish was cold and we had to wait for the fries. The fries didn't even come until after we were done eating. Horrible service.
Erin S.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,39,38,3.0,2/25/2017,"The food was good however being that I came in the early afternoon (prior to 5pm) and was told that you ran out of calamari and ICE CREAM, this visit didnt get 5 stars. This is my first time here and it isnt acceptable that you run out of something as simple as ice cream prior to the evening crowd when you open at 11:30am. Will i visit again or recommend this location? im not sure because when people go to a restaurant and look at a menu, they have an idea of the food they would like to have."
Nelise V.,"West Bronx, NY",2,9,1,5.0,3/8/2017,My boyfriend and I went on a weds afternoon perfect day. No wait. We we're attended immediately. The waiters were super friendly! So engaging checked on us every here and then.I think the first waiter that was attending us shift was ending and she introduced us to the one that was gonna take over was also great! The steak diane was soo good with the shrimp! Delishhh!!!!!! No complaints! Also the advocado egg rolls were bomb!!!
Eric E.,"Manhattan, NY",14,21,,5.0,3/6/2017,"I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, and didn't expect much, but our party of 6 came here during a packed Saturday night for an informal birthday celebration. From the moment we sat down, our server Jewel made us feel like we were at a mom-and-pop neighborhood restaurant in the best possible way, everyone in our party remarked that she provided some of the best service we've ever had in NYC. We had planned on just having cocktails and apps, but because of Jewel we settled in and didn't leave for hours. The food was way better than expected as well, but it was Jewel that made us stay. I hope Cheesecake Factory knows what a stellar employee they have, we'll be returning soon solely because of Jewel's amazing service."
May C.,"Manhattan, NY",56,100,91,4.0,8/15/2017,Can't here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. It was pretty empty. Ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage which was pretty good. Food took a while even though there weren't that many people. Pretty inexpensive for lunch specials.
Nicole Z.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",7,7,4,2.0,1/2/2017,"Granted today was a national holiday, so we would experience a wait time anywhere we went. Originally we were quoted a 55-70 minute wait time (at 3:10 pm) so we walked around the mall for a bit and came closer to the door around 55 minutes later. We checked with the hostess to make sure we hadn't been called and she said the wait would be about 20 minutes later than they said. She was really nice and we were willing to wait. Finally we had a seat around 4:30.  Once we experienced the service, we realized why their wait times to even get a table are so long! While nice, our server was just absent most of the time (and we really don't like overly attentive servers, just reasonably prompt service!). It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks and we ordered food once the drinks came at 4:45. In the meantime, another couple was seated next to us and had a very attentive server who immediately greeted them with bread and water. They ordered food about 10 minutes after us. Their entrees arrived about 20-25 minutes later and our food hadn't arrived yet. For reference, we ordered the lunch BBQ chicken salad and lunch Louisiana pasta while they each had more complex meals that should take longer to prepare. They were finished with their meal when our server finally came over to tell us it would be about 5 more minutes, they were just waiting on the pasta. Finally we got our food at 5:35, 50 minutes after we ordered it. The food itself was good, completely consistent with every Cheesecake Factory I've visited before. Our waitress was nice and got every part of the order right, but the wait times for everything was abysmal. I didn't even consider waiting for cheesecake to go because we didn't have another hour to kill. Maybe we'll come back in a couple months when they've ironed out some kinks in the system."
Matt W.,"New City, NY",0,18,,1.0,8/14/2017,Horrible experience. Came in for a very late lunch and sat at the bar this past Sunday. My order was taken quickly but it was all downhill from there. I was offered bread which never came even after asking a second time. The restaurant was not busy and all I ordered was a Cuban Sandwich with no mustard. After more than an hour my food finally comes out cold and of course with mustard. I tell the only bartender working the bar and after 10 minutes someone else finally came over to offer to replace the meal with what i wanted. That took another 30 minutes to get the correct meal. Never again. This location is poorly managed.
Jazmin S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",41,3,1,5.0,8/13/2017,"so far it's been twice I've gone to the cheesecake factory and i ate everything on my plate each time... this year was the first time iver ever ate here too, for years ive wanted to try it out but there wasn't ever a close location unroll this one!!! Perfect for after shopping hunger stress lmao.. they also served me Big plates which left me full and satisfied. Though  i dont remember the names of the plates I've had so far I can say i have a habit of (because im so picky) always asking a waiter, ""whats the best in the menu"" and both times at the cheesecake factory I got something different that they preferred (staff was very honest as well)  and I fell in love with it just as they said I would.  Oh and the bread was super yummy... soft and warm....ugh I can't wait to go again.. next  time I will take pictures of my meal and write a better helpful review for anyone else out there that wants to know what to eat and how good it really it.."
Nick W.,"Jamaica, NY",0,13,15,2.0,3/13/2017,"Very nice restaurant but they are always running out of something like bread, turkey bacon,etc. it's just sad that such a big establishment like the cheese cake factory can run out of ingredients smh..."
Rudy E.,"FAR ROCKAWAY, NY",41,11,6,1.0,2/15/2017,On a Wednesday you have to wait over an hour for food. The place is understaffed. Definitely would not recommend to friends. The one on Old country rd better than this place.
Tara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",43,250,220,3.0,11/21/2016,"Being a local, I was super excited about having a Cheesecake Factory close by. For starters weekend wait times will cost of about 1hour plus. If you are able to grab a seat in the bar area do it as there is no wait time for this area. Be warned it could get a little over whelming having ppl stare at you to see if your almost done eating so they can zero in lol. Service was good, just good. A bit of a wait to get our table cleared and there was a noticeable wait for our appetizers. The shrimp tempura to start was soooo yummy. We always get Buffalo blasts as well which was also very good. The Cajun jambalaya with chicken and shrimp, my bf had was actually really really good. I had the steak Diane minus the onions. My food had a hair in it at first but the got me a new one shortly. Shortly was about another 15 20 min- but I will say my food came out, tasty & hot. Originally when the bill came we did not receive a comped entree or discount. That was a lack on managements part. The initial manager didn't even check back on us when I did receive my food again. The waitress made it her business to get us a comped entree which was more then what we expected (a little acknowledgement of the hygiene issue in the kitchen and wait times would've been fine , 10 percent off or something from management). Would we go back? Def not on the weekend. On a weekday? Maybe. Westbury is still more appetizing esp when it comes to service and space."
Ruby K.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",310,225,117,3.0,11/16/2016,"waited an hour for a table for 2 on a saturday afternoon.  we ordered: -chicken madeira with mashed potatoes (very good, but was a bit cold when i got it) -steak diane with mashed potatoes (steak was okay, but i asked for it to be medium and got it well done) -miso salmon with sauteed spinach (no complaints, fresh fish) -mac and cheese side (best part of the meal) we also asked for extra bread. the multigrain brown bread was nice and soft and slightly sweet, and the white bread was crunchy and great with butter. we were too full for dessert, but i was eyeing the chocolate cake the entire time hehe"
