Amanda P.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/8/2017,"Tonight was a Tuesday night and there weren't that many people in the restaurant but we still received horrible service. We waited an hour for PASTA that was both too spicy, sour, and stale while the table next to us received their meal within 30 minutes of ordering. The service was unacceptable. Our waitress forgot to give us our bread at the beginning of our meal. When we began to voice our displeasure, the manager came over in attempt to make things right but he approached us with a terrible attitude. Despite this there was still no change in the service we received. Near the second half of our meal our waitress didn't even bring us our food. She stood far away socializing with her coworkers. We payed the bill and walked out with half our meal left. Never coming back !"
Anna J.,"Elmhurst, NY",154,77,148,3.0,10/31/2016,"I went here over the weekend. I was told the wait would be 21 mins. My group was buzzed over around 30 mins. As they were about to seat us the host walking us over to the table realized that table was not yet available. About 5 mins later they found another available table and seated us. We were seated near where the entrance door from outside the building, which by the way is the most pointless door ever as that door should just be an exit door considering the front desk is really by the entrance inside the mall. We ordered drinks which took a few minutes to come. The food took about an hr to arrive. I've been to cheesecake factory before in other locations but this had to be the longest wait for food. I didn't mind it so much but I doubt it will make me want to visit again. Food was as I remember it to be... Decent. I highly recommend my order of Grilled steak tacos it's under their specialties. Drinks are usually what I like from here and maybe dessert. I was also told I should note that in the men's bathroom they had 2 urinals and one stall. So for you men who wants to do a number 2 here... Know that there will be a wait."
Raul A.,"Woodhaven, NY",85,75,164,5.0,1/18/2017,"First time going to this location had the Kale salad, and Grilled Fish Tacos. Staff was friendly did not had enough room for the cheesecake took it home with us. The wait time was 20 mins on a weekday will go definitely go back soon."
Geneva S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,1.0,10/30/2016,"The service was awful! The wait was over an hour long, which wasn't the issue, and the waiters and waitresses had no idea what they were doing. After being seated and assigned a waiter, Ian, I placed my order. I waited over 55 minutes to receive my order and in the mean time there was no sign of Ian. Some random guy came over and said my food would be ready a little while longer and thanked me for my patience. 2 other random waitresses delivered my food and again there was no sign of a waiter thereafter. I had to find someone to request my bill. She disappeared after I got my bill and another woman picked up my bill. After sitting for  25 minutes to get my card back I asked the woman who took my card to return it and she was confused as if she had no idea who i was. She left to find whomever had my card and I left after being there for 3 hours!!! I would NEVER go back there!!!!"
Jorelle Mae B.,"Corona, NY",105,13,,1.0,4/20/2017,"There are a lot of empty seats but they kept us waiting. This was our 2nd attempt, same thing happened. Also, the service is so slow!!! Just checking out for the cheesecake, and still so slow although there's only a small number of customers. Please fix your service and think of your guests."
Pat A.,"Manhattan, NY",3,13,6,2.0,12/16/2016,We were seated in the addition by the window and we froze our tails off on the first coldest night of the season. The manager was useless and asked us why didn't we ask to move. Can't put anything pass that Sherlock. We in fact did request to be moved on site but was told there were no other available seats. Although the manager did give us a free slice of cheesecake after we suggested that something needs to be done for sitting in the cold. Our food was cold we did not finish our meal. Drinks were watery no alcohol and tasteless food. Surprisingly for a factory I love them.
Tabitha J.,"Queens, NY",0,5,,1.0,2/24/2017,"Very bad service. Went there on Thursday and my friend and I received no forks, spoons, knives, anything whatsoever. I had to walk up to a waitress and ask myself. The waitress took forever to take our orders. That wasn't even the worse part. We ordered Pink Lemonade that took the longest to arrive, although I thought the food would take longer..  Lastly, ordered two cheesecakes (Snickers and Reece's) as a dessert wrapped to go, and they placed our cheesecakes on someone else's table...  Disappointed.."
Carrie A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,,5.0,8/19/2017,Friendly staff great food amazing cheesecake my personal fav cheesecake is either original or chocolate moose not super sweet 10/10 recommend
Shardae J.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,1,,1.0,1/19/2017,Worst experience ever!!! We did not have to wait to be seated but once we sat down we were greeted from one of Joe's roommates...a nice healthy roach!!! We asked to move our seat and the new table had a dirty fork on the floor underneath.We had to wait over 20 min to place our order and then another 20 or so min to get our food. The manager never came back to see if we were ok after our extra unwanted guest at our 1st table. Definitely will not be going back to this location EVER.
Judy P.,"Queens, NY",0,6,7,1.0,3/22/2017,The worst Cheesecake experience ever food was dry and nasty Service was horrible I rather drive to the one in west bury then done here
Laur S.,"Long Island City, NY",0,2,,1.0,2/19/2017,"I usually LOVE the Cheesecake Factory but this location is horrible!! Very unsanitary and very rude service. Employees are very unprofessional and needs better service. Family warned  me about this location, but I doubted them because I have always had nothing but great experiences at the Cheesecake Factory. Very dissatisfied and disappointed in my most recent experience."
Vanessa E.,"Queens, NY",0,10,25,1.0,12/18/2016,"The only reason I am giving one star is because the drinks deserve some credit. The flatbread and spinach dip were good, but my parent's steak and mash potatoes were cold. Then when we decided to order dessert, they took about 20 minutes and gave it to us to go, even though we wanted it to stay. Few minutes later, they came with the cheesecake that was plated. We were highly disappointed. After waiting more than an hour, the service was horrible. Im not sure if I would want to go back to this location."
Tracy C.,"Long Island City, NY",35,62,8,1.0,11/29/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to! First no bread, second no utensils, third learn what medium rare is and chicken pasta was so salty!"
Jasmine R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,2,1.0,11/17/2016,was looking forward to having a great experience here to only be let down. The service is horrible I sat for 35 minutes before they remembered that they still hadn't bring me my beverage. The food was okay could've been much better I won't be returning
Anna C.,"New York, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Went here on a Friday afternoon. I came here with 2 other people and were almost instantly seated. Food came out in time, and was overall pretty good. However, the utensils we were given were EXTREMELY dirty. One of the people I came here with tried cleaning off his fork with the napkin and by the time he was done with it, the napkin was BLACK from just how dirty it was. I could clearly see dirty spots on my fork and spoon, it was definitely off putting. In the end, we asked for our food to be put into to-go boxes. I opened one of them just to check, and there was a half used plastic straw cover thrown in there. It definitely didn't come from us, since we only had water. Completely gross, and makes me wonder how they handle their food back there in the kitchen."
Lorrie G.,"East New York, NY",8,19,,5.0,7/30/2017,"Arrived and the wait was 15 mins.  Love the decor of the restaurant.  No issues with the waiter and the food is excellent and you do get a lot.  Came to celebrate my daughters birthday and today is National cheesecake day, so slices of cheesecake 1/2 priced.  They validate your parking for 2 hours if your bill is over 30 per person  - nice incentive."
ERica E.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,7,,3.0,1/15/2017,The service was slow. The wait time was long . The decor is very nice and the food was good. I would recommend the pork chops or the steak.
Tye M.,"Manhattan, NY",78,7,,3.0,3/4/2017,"I've been here a couple of times, once for my nephew's birthday, and the second for a casual dinner. The first time ended up being a pleasant experience. Food was great and so was service. Wait time was pretty long but it was expected. The second time wasn't as good as it pretty much took too long for the food to arrive. It was cold. This place has so much potential for a chain and I hope management fixes these kinks soon because it does have a great ambiance, good food when served hot, and friendly service."
Av J.,"Queens, NY",0,49,18,5.0,10/25/2016,First time eating in here the workers were very helpful and courteous to me and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the fried Mac and cheese wow  and the steak Diane also a winner very delicious I definitely will be back and recommend this place
Shatima P.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/18/2017,"The service there is horrible , The waitress didn't even come back to the table to make sure everything was ok. I really was 2mins to walking out and not paying for my bill!! I will never go back to that Cheesecake Factory ever Again I'll stick with the one in Old country road Long Island"
