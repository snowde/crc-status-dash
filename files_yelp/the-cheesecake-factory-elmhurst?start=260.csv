Karron W.,"New York, NY",0,2,,4.0,1/27/2017,"Me and the Girlfriend had dinner twice and both times were amazing. Great food and staff were very nice, and I can't wait to go back"
Yolanda J.,"Jamaica, NY",1,9,14,5.0,7/21/2017,It a chain of restaurants that I regularly go to be because the food is always consistence wherever I go. I will definitely go back again and rob the waiter was friendly and  professional.
Christopher S.,"Richmond Hill, Queens, NY",393,19,31,5.0,11/30/2016,"Outstanding. I'm not ever sure where to start .. should I start with Teri's outstanding service or the cute little personal table we had at the end of the bar .. or the Mac and cheese side; the shrimp or the loaded tater tots app?! Ok I'm rambling. So my best friend and I decided to give the Cheesecake Factory a go after debating where to eat on this rainy Wednesday night. We show up and are told it's a 30 min wait--not so bad. All of a sudden a man in a black shirt tells us we can sit at the end of the bar if we'd like. We agree and it is the cutest little drop down table from the bar (but is still connected to the bar) Teri greeted us within seconds of sitting down. Napkins menus and utensils were brought over a few moments after. We ordered 2 Long Island Iced Teas. For $11.50 each l, we agreed it was probably the best L.I.T we ever had. For starters .. firecracker shrimp with some sort of aioli sauce, and loaded TaterTots that also came with an aioli type sauce. The shrimp were cooked to perfection .. not too overly breaded. The TaterTots were just jaw dropping.. it was a creamy bacon cheese mashed potato like filling inside a crunchy shell of a TaterTot.. amazing !! I ordered my usual .. spicy chicken sandwich, but this time with a side of Mac and cheese !! Oh my the Mac and cheese .. like no other !! HANDS DOWN best I've ever ate in my life. I kept having to shoo my friends fork away from it.. my mistake was to let her taste one bite .. but one bite and she had been hooked !!! The spicy chicken sandwich was great as always with the chipotle aioli and delicious French fries. My friend Anjelica had one of the specialties, the catfish, and absolutely loved it. 3 overly big fluffy soft breaded slices of catfish with mashed potatoes and string beans... Amazing. Teri made sure everything was up to par as our night went on and we ate away. First time at this location but definitely not my last. Have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years and now there is one right in my hometown. Thank you for the excellent service, Teri, and thank you to the Cheesecake Factory for the amazing food; atmosphere; staff and ALWAYS HITTING THE SPOT !! Let's end this with saying if I could leave 10 stars instead of 5 I would !!! --From a happy happy customer !! Chris"
Steve A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,2.0,2/19/2017,"Not worth the hour and 30 min wait time. Not kid friendly seater gave us attitude for having a baby carriage. Order filet mignon well done, they gave me medium rare. Mash potato was cold yet plate was warm??? Not worth the time, for that go across the street to Longhorn steakhouse."
Carlos C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,557,36,4.0,12/6/2016,"Cheesecakes always impressive.  The Sunday line and craziness caused them a star. But it recently opened, and I had high expectations of them. Will revisit soon."
Jane Z.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",33,13,14,1.0,8/1/2017,"they ran out of a list of their appetizers and it wasn't even 7pm yet. on a tuesday night too. the food was very unflavorful and not enjoyable. he also didn't shred parmesan for our pasta. our waiter was never there (and he went on a ""10-15min"" break and didn't come back until we finished our food). i went in a group of 4 and we wanted to split the appetizer price between us, and he said we couldn't. i was able to do that back in my cheesecake factory in Edina, Minnesota. he was very frustrated in the end because he didn't split the checks between us and we never asked to pay together. he brought one check and i said i want it separate, and he defended himself saying that's what he was trying to ask earlier (no. that was when i was asking about splitting the appetizers). he didn't apologize but left angrily. it took like 20 min to get the checks completed. he also did not say ""thanks have a good night"" at the end. instead, we got a cold shoulder and a glare. i would not come to this TCF again."
Jimmy P.,"Farmingdale, NY",3,18,4,1.0,2/17/2017,"Food was inedible, barley any chicken in my Chipotle  Chicken pasta dish. The kitchen crew should be fired. My friends food was also burnt shown in the picture I posted. The Manager should also be fired this is the 2nd time i came here and the food was cooked inproperly , cold or burnt and very greasy. Ive been to other CCFs and they made this place look worse than a fast food joint. I couldnt even finish my disgusting overpriced meal. The only thing nice was my waitress. . Fire manager, fire the cooks and keep the waitress."
Angela L.,"Woodside, NY",182,16,31,2.0,12/11/2016,Wait time was almost an hour for the food to come. Crab Hash from the brunch section was a bit burnt. Waiter forgot our bagel. I feel like the environment of the place with all its decorations is better than the food and service combined haha~
Kiran S.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",0,6,,1.0,12/28/2016,First of all.. the wait time here is absolutely ridiculous.  The host lies and claims to say a shorter wait time than it really is.  The workers are all chatting instead of serving customers.  There is no silverware.. no bread.. the waitress didn't know what beers were on tap. I will never return here again.
Yamii N.,"Queens, NY",165,8,2,4.0,2/15/2017,"I came here the day before Valentine's day around 9ish so granted,the place was full. The wait on tables was about 10 minutes so it wasn't so bad. The interior decoration is lovely and the cocktail list seems well put together. Our food was pretty good,the Filet Mignon was so tender,it was like butter in your mouth! However,we had to wait long for our food and the mash potatoes were undercooked. Our server was so understanding! She was a bit overworked but she still found time to be attentive and ofcourse,the cheesecakes were amazing!"
Jasmine A.,"New York, NY",3,101,83,4.0,11/20/2016,"I never truly realized how rude and obnoxious New Yorkers are. They find any reason to complain about restaurants when it's not even the workers fault. So I came here yesterday on a Saturday night and we all knew the wait would be long. It's fine though, we went shopping, the mall is literally right there duh. I don't get why people complain about the wait when they have a mall, literally footsteps away! Talk about common sense. And then these people hound all around the entrance and block the way for others. Anyway, everything was good and our waitress Elsa was very attentive and told us exactly when our food was coming out. The service was really good!  Food: I started off with a piña colada which was good and the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders which were really good 5/5. My favorite appetizer from here! As for entree, I got my favorite Chicken & Biscuits which was good, however I wish they poured more sauce over the gravy and it was slightly warm when it reached the table. Regardless still good. And for dessert, I ended up taking a Strawberry Cheesecake to go, which was delicious!  That concludes it all folks! Don't believe in half of these ridiculous reviews. The food and service was great. A huge thank you to Elsa as well!"
Keli P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,6,3.0,12/25/2016,"Great service from waiter, but noddles to my shrimp scampi weren't fully cooked :( besides that everything else was great."
E'liza B.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,19,7,2.0,6/9/2017,"I was so excited that a Cheesecake Factory finally opened up near me. So I was relieved when there was literally no wait! And the ""patio"" area is nice and comfy. Our waiter Kaz was bubbly asking us immediately what we'd like to drink. Came back and we ordered appetizers. Came back again after a few to ask us how the appetizers were and then we ordered entrees. Everything seemed to be going really well right?... we were completely done with our appetizers, we even asked for a refill on our sodas but as 30mins pass we are wondering where our entrees were. We even joke about Kaz forgetting our orders. Another waitress overheard us and said she would check our meal for us. We then see Kaz running over to us and apologizing because... HE FORGOT TO PUT OUR ORDER IN! At this point we are completely dumbfounded simply because dude you gave us refills on our soda after you took our entree order. It never rang a bell? I'm mostly disappointed that he didn't try to rectify the situation by any means. He just simply asked if we wanted to continue to wait for our meals or get the check. He even said do you want to order cheesecake, if not with me you can order in the front. OH WAIT! It's not free? At least give us something to show us that our time spent patiently waiting didn't go to complete waste. But a las, we are just another table to be forgotten as soon as the bus boy wipes down. Basically, my whole experience tonight at cheesecake went completely downhill. So I have given two stars, one star for seating quickly and the other star for yummy appetizers. But as far as your customer service is concerned... zero stars."
Nina L.,"Flushing, NY",0,10,4,5.0,2/11/2017,This place has very good appetizers. I came here and I didn't like one of the entrees and thankfully the manager handled it well and took it off my check. This place also has nice desserts!!
Diana G.,"Jackson Heights, NY",4,6,5,2.0,11/6/2016,"It was my first time eating at the infamous Cheesecake Factory, it does not live up to the hype. The wait is ridiculous, 2 hours minimum! The hostesses are absolutely clueless. I was taken to three different booths that were either dirty or had people sitting there. They had no clean linens so we were given utensils with no napkins which to me is unsanitary. They were sold out of meatloaf & about a dozen cheesecakes. Get it together people! I'll give it another try in a couple of weeks when the craziness dies down."
Kristy D.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",0,8,3,1.0,12/21/2016,"We called in advance to let them know that a party of 10 will be coming in 10mins. The hostess said she will note it and since they don't take reservations maximum wait if anything will be 5-10mins. Went there and it was packed, was told the wait is 20mins. but after 20 mins has passed and we were still not seated we just left. Do not go there if you have to go somewhere else after. It's packed and so disorganized"
Joy W.,"Berlin, MA",1,3,3,1.0,12/20/2016,"We try to avoid long wait and arrived at door open, still take them 15 minutes to seat us. The waitress is really slow, took her 20 minutes to come to our table and take simple 3 orders. Took another 20 minutes for her to bring us bread. Finally one hour later, we have to request to rush out our order,  the food is not as good as other cheese cake factory, and it took us total 2 hours to grab a lunch. Totally disappointed and will never return again."
Rorukaroma R.,"New York, NY",2,17,3,5.0,10/27/2016,"We came to visit during lunch hour and was immediately seated for two. Normally in LI, it would have been a 10-15 min wait so this was really nice! The bar and top tables are for walk ins and were full (you can tell it was mostly the employees of the mall which is really great since the food court can get pretty boring) Our server Jessica was AMAZING! She made us feel right at home and was attentive throughout our dining experience. She started off with the specials and even some recommendations. We ordered two types of Rolls (Avocado and Tex Mex) which were sooo good! And two entrees which we were so full, we took home left overs (which we did not mind at all!)  I also took home the Pumpkin cheesecake, which for each slice sold proceeds went to the local community to help feed the homeless. So it was extra yummy! Definitely will be returning and hope to see Jessica again!"
Ron H.,"Jamaica, NY",0,23,26,4.0,1/7/2017,"Went in a group of six and it took forever to get in (popular time and during the weekend). Once we got in the staff was really friendly and were always refilling our drinks and asking what we'd like. The food we ordered was alright but i was really just there for the desert. I had the oreo cheesecake and it was really nice. It had an amazing taste and the presentation was great although that doesn't really matter as much to me. Everything is a little bit on the pricey side and there were a few issues here and there that cost us a lot of time, but at the end of the day we were all pretty satisfied. Anytime we're in the area and want to have some dessert we enter from the side and order some cheesecake to go. Overall I like the place, but wish it wasn't so expensive or that there was a better waiter/waitress system because it was pretty hectic in there until the end."
Mai A.,"New York, NY",0,10,3,2.0,7/8/2017,The service is extremely slow. Took forever to get the food. The food is good but it takes forever to get. I got the sheilas avocado and chicken salad. It is very bland. I wouldn't get it again. I recommend the California guacamole salad and the chicken madeira. The super antioxidant with chicken was bomb!
