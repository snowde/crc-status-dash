Katherine R.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",58,31,8,1.0,5/23/2017,"I've been to the location a few times . But today on 5/23/15 I walked out after finding myself arguing with the most incompetent server I have ever met . My friend and I walked in 40 minutes before closing time so we ordered pretty quickly. Appetizer was served along with my drink (skinny mojito) . Now This mojito had to be the sweetest mojito I've ever had in my life . I'm talking unbearably sweet. So i stopped our server and expressed to him that it was too sweet and jokingly added that it was like there is no alcohol in it . To which he replies well if I change it it's not like they are going to put more alcohol . I can get you a shot and you can pour it in yourself . Well after hearing that response my friend was irked Because  never have we heard such a ridiculous thing . My friend lifts up my drink looked him in the eye and said ""bring her a new drink "" That is what any experienced waiter working in decent place would know to do . Never in my life has someone suggested a shot of alcohol . They always take the drink and bring it back tasting like it won't give me diabetes. So what does the waiter do ? Brings me back the drink with the shot of alcohol ! I look at him and tell him that I am not a bartender and that usually i don't sit there and pour a shot to fix my drink . This guy tone of voice goes ten octaves higher while waving his hands as he speaks saying that ""clearly I dont understand that they won't add more alcohol to my drink unless I'm charged for it "" He clearly didn't understand how badly I wanted to throw the drink in his face for the way he was talking to me . At this point we are going back and forth Arguing to which he says I'm walking away . So In return i put on my coat and also walked away and left . And I promise I won't ever be back to this Cheesecake Factory . Unless they hire servers that know what it's like to make every dining experience a pleasant one. I've never been so annoyed and dissatisfied with a server the way I was with this man . Over a drink ? How can the Cheesecake Factory employ people with such poor communication skills and overall rude behavior ? I know I could've alerted management but frankly walking away was all the energy I had left in me for that day . I'm glad I didn't stay. I don't know someone that would stay and wait to pay to get served by that insolent inexperienced and incompetent person ."
Shirley W.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,31,,2.0,2/22/2017,"We came back a month later. And we were told the wait was an hour and a half. We left again. I hope that management can run this business more efficiently. It is a huge space. And people are thrilled to have this as a dining option. But nothing is worth that wait.  We came on a Monday night for an early dinner. Bad idea. Crowded. Horrible service. We were told we had to wait an hour for a table for our party of 6, so we took a booth instead.  It wasn't about the seating...everything took an hour. Appetizers. Main course. I left before dessert came. We ordered ice cream. It took 20 mins for us to find out that they were out of strawberry shortcake.  It is a huge restaurant w a huge kitchen. I don't understand why the food would take so long.  So- go if you have time to sit around a dark and loud restaurant w great bread and butter."
Cynthia J.,"Elmhurst, NY",0,1,,4.0,1/1/2017,"Nice restaurant , good services, great environment, and delicious food.  However, the cheesecake is too sweet to me."
Amy M.,"Flushing, NY",19,5,7,5.0,12/9/2016,"Went there for my birthday with my family and had a fantastic meal and a spectacular dessert, it was a Monday and totally packed but after my meal I understand why"
Richard E.,"Fairfax, VA",6,3,,2.0,11/26/2016,Extremely long wait times (2+ hours) factored heavily in this review.  Food is just ok despite the large portions.  Wait staff was friendly and helpful.  If only they could do something about the wait time.
Joe R.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,38,,4.0,1/16/2017,"This new spot in Queens has great food and very good service.  Everything that you order there you'll likely love!  The only drawbacks to the place is the space is too small to accommodate the masses of people who want to eat there and the wait for service on a busy evening is atrocious - nearly 1& 1/2 hours.  Otherwise, go when it is not busy and enjoy!"
Jeff O.,"Hillcrest, Queens, NY",0,3,1,5.0,10/25/2016,Came for the launch and was well worth the wait. Menu has endless tasty possibilities and that's already before you even get to dessert menu. Don't cheat yourself treat yourself!
Liz S.,"Flushing, NY",0,1,2,1.0,1/12/2017,I ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad. Took over 30 minutes to get the order filled and this is what I received.

M. L.,"Jamaica, NY",0,3,8,5.0,12/9/2016,"Took my friend for her Birthday on Friday for lunch. Nice and fancy restaurant. We ordered Special of the day Grilled Salmon, was really good. Cajun Jambalaya pasta was very tasty and full of flavor. Calamari was excellent, crispy on the outside and soft inside. Shepherd Pie was Ok.. Our server Bryan is super NICE. He and his team sing Happy Birthday for my friend and bring the Cheesecake with candle..."
Jrad C.,"Bronx, NY",40,3,,1.0,3/13/2017,"all caps turned on , strap yourselves in .  this was my 1st visit to any cheesecake factory anywhere ever. so naturally since this new location popped up literaly across the street i thought would finaly taste what the hype is all about . i placed an order over the phone and was placed on hold the 1st time for 15 minutes , i should have saw that as a sign ( sign #1). i then called a 2nd time and long behold another extended waititme . combing for a whopping 20 min. they say 3rd times a charm i finaly got ahold of a young lady willing to take my order , she proceeded to tell me that she is not familiar with the p.o.s system sign #2 i should've have just said no.  after taking my order . 1 chicken madera,  1 orange chicken , 1 strawberry lemonade . i go to pick up my items to only to be ignored by the cashier after stating my reason for arriving to the pick up counter . delaying my process another 10min . i finaly recieve my order. it was placed extremely close to the front door where in nyc it's currently 20°. needless to say i touch the bnoottom of my togo orders plate and it's unbeivebaly cold . at this moment , this moment right here in time i realize i need to speak to a manager. i am directed to a young lady name katie .after telling katie my whole ordeal from beginning to current she had the nerves to tell me to take it and reheat my order ..... let that sink in. i spent 60$ just on two meals and a single beverage and your telling me i need to reheat it when i'm back at my work site.  jesus christ . i'm usualy the gentleman to say fuck it and walk away . (which i ended up doing) i told her she can be serious as to seeing i paid 60$ to not have to heat a meal up . smh . after bieng taken out of my way by more than an hour i finaly had it . i proceeded to ask for a refund , i was met with why don't you give me 10 minutes i can have put on priority,  excuse me ??? 10 minutes to make my order ....i dont want rushed food i want food that had been properly handled and not put thru the express line . smh . not to mention i walked 15 min. to and from . in 20° weather . overall. i will never be going or setting foot in a cheesecake factory knowingly,  i will screenshot this and plaster it over social media so that everyone in the queens , bronx , nyc area will see what poor service and disheartening employees this location has. i have been 100% in every way  thunderstruck by my visit into this glorified hell hole which is known as the cheesecake factory"
Dian M.,"Flushing, NY",0,5,,3.0,12/7/2016,Medicore food. Very close to where i live so yes i will come back maybe once a year. The cheesecake are ok as well. Servicd is great though.
Bb J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,1,3.0,1/6/2017,Cheesecake Factory had great free bread but the wait is terrible I had to wait about 60-90 minutes to get seated and 40 minutes to get the food. On my half I suggest just go for the cheesecake and not the food. And they have excellent service
Sean S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3,7,,5.0,12/7/2016,"Went here with a friend and the food is absolutely good, the best place to go eat. The service is really good and the workers are all very kind. Definetly worth coming back! :)"
Michelle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,31,1,1.0,9/14/2017,"Very disappointed in the dining experience I had while visiting this establishment. I went there with a party of 13 and called ahead of time to find out if a reservation was needed and I was told they did not take reservations and we should be seated rather quickly upon arrival since Wednesday nights around 7pm was not a typical busy night. Imagine my frustration when things went from bad to worse while there. We were told the wait would  be up to 90 minutes as there were not enough seats to accommodate my party. (The restaurant was not packed at all) . I was there to celebrate my son's birthday and we had three smaller kids with us and I did not want to wait that long to be seated so I asked if we could at least be seated next to each other and that request took about 40mins itself. We were given 1 waitress for both tables and she told us any adult beverages would take some time to come out since there was only one bartender making multiple drinks for the entire restaurant.  The first table had such a horrible experience a manager was called since the food never came out in a timely manner the kids fell asleep, the drinks were not delivered to the table, and the service was just slow, they should have at least had two servers tending to a party of that size. Beyond annoyed a manager was requested  who came to the table and gave out false information as to what the delay in the bar and kitchen was just to appease our party because the information we received from someone else was totally different. However, there was one other server not even working with us who came over to assist and after hearing how bad our experience was she spoke to someone who was able to remove a couple of the appetizers from the bill and gave us with three free desserts for our trouble.. As for my second table, two of the orders came out very late and at this point we were just over being there and wanted this experience to be over. We were there for about 3hours just to get mediocre food and subpar service. The busboy was actually very helpful and tried to make the time we spent there as stress free as possible. I don't believe a service of this magnitude warrants a tip however, I think the waitress may have been burnt out and could only do so much with what she was given by management. That being said I still left her a tip only because it's the right thing to do not because I had exceptional service. I doubt I will ever return to this restaurant again unless I  hear there has been major changes in  management and the way the place is run."
Mike P.,"New York, NY",1,21,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Served us main courses and appetizers at same time..wtf?  Those 4 plates wouldnt even fit on our table..Told them to take back main dishes until we ate appetizers..They come back with main dishes and food was barely warm and mashed potatos looked like a peice of plastic like one peice..Could pick up whole mashed potato with a fork, like a peice of steak...Terrible experience gave back our food spoke to manager..manager did get us 2 new dishes ..after 2 hrs we finally were finished eating..Not cool for an expensive place to eat.."
Tracy G.,"Corona, NY",0,5,12,1.0,1/1/2017,"Happy new years everybody, I was very excited for my brunch at Cheesecake Factory until I ordered the the eggs Benedict. The presentation was nice but my eggs were not poached - there were fully cook the Canadian bacon was on the side and not on the English muffin. My party ordered 3 orders of eggs Benedict, We had no runny yolks to fall on our food which is the best part. However the waffles had the right amount of fluff with the perfect buttery taste. I do not recommend Cheesecake Factory for a brunch. I do recommend lunch and desserts #chessecakes  Happy New Year"
Kat C.,"Forest Hills, NY",15,6,2,2.0,4/13/2017,"Our family was excited to come because we liked the Cheesecake Factory in Long Island.  We waited about an hour to be seated, which was ok.  However, by that time, the 1 year old fell asleep.  We asked if we could keep him in the stroller until he woke up.  Guy said ""No"", we cannot have our stroller in the dining area...""let him sleep in the high chair.""  ""No thanks,"" I said, ""I'll have him sleep on the bench.""  I ordered 4-cheese pasta, sister got lemon-herb roasted chicken and substituted mashed potatoes for cilantro rice, my partner got pasta with shrimp and sausage.  30 minutes later, food arrived.  My 4-cheese pasta was ok.  There was a white blob on top, which I assumed was ricotta, since that's what it said on the menu, but it tasted more like herbed cream cheese?? Pregnant sister's rice was hard and raw.  She asked server to ask the kitchen about it, and server said that batch of rice would be fully cooked in about 5 minutes, so she happily brought my sister back cooked rice after 5 minutes.  Now for partner's pasta... I really wish I took a photo.  His food was more expensive than mine, yet it was 1/3 of the size.  There were 3 pieces of shrimp on it.  What the fuck?  AND it was cold.  We had already waited too long, and our son was starting to fuss, so partner didn't bother complaining.  He left the restaurant hungry and angry.  The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is that our server was very pleasant despite the fact that she works in a crap hole."
Patrick P.,"Queens, NY",7,52,2,3.0,1/22/2017,"A cheesecake spot in New York that doesn't make their cheesecakes on sight and no one at the restaurant is quite sure where exactly they are made.  Florida, maybe?  Then again, what do you expect at a chain like this?  Go elsewhere.  You're in New York.  If you're here, get the Reese's peanut butter cup cheesecake slice.  It's good.  The Shepard's pie is pretty good too."
John R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/2/2017,Horrible experience.. very long wait for seats very long wait for waitress very long wait for drinks/ food .. food and price definitely overrated..
