Kerrie A.,"Maspeth, Queens, NY",84,20,21,4.0,10/28/2016,"Went here tonight to eat. An hour wait but that's not bad considering it opened four days ago. Food was great, server was great. Started off a bit slow however it is opening week and that's expected. Michael was our server and he was wonderful. The hostess sat four people in his section at once but another server came and helped him out. I'm happy to have one of these in the neighborhood! Great start."
Fat B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,2,1,1.0,5/11/2017,i dont know why people eat here.  this place is expensive for a mediocre food.  the plate is huge but the food is small.  $9 fo a freaking 1000 kcal cheese cake that is unhealthy for you i wont recommend it.  i ll stay with olive garden thank you.
Karissa C.,"Flushing, NY",166,5,2,5.0,6/30/2017,"Just had dinner with my family here and I must say the food was great. The wait was no more than 20 minutes and the customer service was even greater. We were greeted by our server Noelia (I hope I spelled her name right) who had a beautiful smile and was lovely the entire time. She stepped away for a short break, introduced us to our new server who was also great. Our food came in about 20 minutes and even though we didn't get everything all at once, the manager came over to our table, apologized and reassured us that the rest of our food was coming shortly. Once the rest of our food arrived she came over to check on us. She made a really great comment about how time was passing by so fast and it's most likely because she enjoys her job which is hard to believe on a Friday night at a busy restaurant but she was amazing. Keep up the great work Noelia and the positive energy, it was contagious!!"
Dornell S.,"Elmont, NY",70,10,10,1.0,11/27/2016,This is the worst experience I had with the Cheesecake Factory . I usually go to the one in westbury Long Island . The wait was two hours long . So I proceeded to go shopping and came back with in the waiting time to then being told  there additional 20 min extra wait .  Waited some more and was finally seated . We order our food  the waiter then disappeared  for 20 mins we had to ask for utensils. I then called for the manager after waiting for a hour for the food to come out to only be told the order would take longer because I order a steak middalion and salmon combo . The steak is usually a hockey puck sized I told her I usually go to the Long Island Cheesecake Factory and have never waited for a hour and 20 mins  for my food even on the busiest holiday exp Mother's Day  and Valentine's Day . When my order finally came my salmon was extra small  portion  and my steak was luke warm by that time after all that wait I lost my appetite . Their portions of food is nothin in comparison to Long Island.  the service is horrible I went to other steak houses and got bigger steaks rib eyes t bone and porterhouse steaks and the wait was never that long I explained to the manger but it fell on death ears because you can tell all she wanted to do was go home . Would not recommend this Cheesecake Factory just take the extra time and drive to westbury. Forgot to add  that they said it was free parking they would stamp my ticket the waiter took my ticket and never stamped it !! Went to  leave parking lot had to pay  smh so it took a total of 3 and half hours to get bad service. Bad food  not worth it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ana P.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",1,12,,1.0,5/7/2017,"We knew there would be a wait however Cheesecake FActory is what we wanted after a full day. What we did not know was how unprofessional the hostess would be. She said it was a 40 minute wait and we inquired about the bar and someone said it has horrible service and the hosted stayed well that has nothing to do with me. And I said yes it does - you all represent the Cheesecake Factory, you don't bash your peers. We decided to eat at the bar and our barmaid,Lindsay, was Awesome."
Marzia S.,"Queens, NY",0,2,5,4.0,12/21/2016,"My friends and I had a great experience! We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated for a party of 3, however that's most likely because we went during a non rush hour. Our waiter Dre was awesome and the service was great as well. Just expect your food to take long to come, it's so crowded and it's understandable. I ordered the bistro shrimp which was burnt the first time it came, so the manager replaced it for me. My friend got the eggplant park which was amazing! We also tried a bunch of cheesecakes the turtle pecan is amazing and so is the Oreo dream. I would go again, the portions are large and service was great."
Allen G.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,105,107,5.0,11/21/2016,I love everything about this place the sliders are awesome and waiter was great - ribeye cooked to perfection and the cheesecakes were amazing!!! Don't forget to try the Hibiscus lemonade.
Arta S.,"Queens, New York, NY",201,8,,5.0,6/22/2017,Today I walked inside the cheesecake around 4;40 and Steve one of the hostess had told me my wait time was 30 mins. Which isn't so bad since every is always saying they wait so long. I had asked Steve if I can actually pick my waitress because boy let me tell you my waitress Sharlynn I think that's how you spell it is an amazing waitress. She's fast quick and very funny. She knows how to speak to her costumers and always came back to the table checking up on us. I had the chicken park with French fries boy was that Yummyy 13.95 for that too was worth it. Also I ordered some nachos they weren't all that but they were still pretty good if they had filled up the nachos it would've been a perfect night. But besides al that I had an amazing time today at the cheesecake and I will be coming back every thursdays just for Sharlynn so please make sure Sharlynn is there ever thursdays:)) best waitress ever
Kaitlyn V.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",105,3,2,4.0,5/20/2017,"Went on a Thursday night for dinner, seated right away and service was excellent! My bf ordered steak. We've eaten at Longhorn, Peter Lugers, Ruth Chris and this steak was cooked amazing! On busier days service is not as great-small location. Great for off-peak meals!"
Veda I.,"Corona, NY",0,4,,4.0,11/12/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has an extensive, mouth watering menu! From appetizers, small plate bar foods, salads, entrees, etc. I thought I could not go wrong. I ordered the grilled pork chop and was impressed when I saw the beautifully plated meal.  Unfortunately, the chef did not know PORK IS NEVER SERVED RARE, AND THIS WAS RAW! I cannot imagine how he or she could allow that to leave the kitchen! And mind you, I had asked for WELL DONE! So now I had to send it back and wait another 20 minutes or so.  I must say it was delicious when it was finally served, well done and still tender and juicy."
Tiffany R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,,1.0,5/9/2017,"Not accommodating for families with a stroller. Told the waitstaff that we are a family of 3 adults, 1 child and 1 stroller (infant was sleeping in the stroller). We were led to a table, and after seating were asked to leave so that they can sit a 2 person table. We waited 22 minutes for water. We ordered 3 sandwiches and one pizza - took 50 minutes to come out of the kitchen. The waitress was very unhelpful. We were done eating and waiting for dessert is when the waitress asked us to move the stroller even though the baby was still sleeping. Would never go back. It is right across the mall but I would recommend going somewhere else. Staff are not courteous and the food is far from satisfactory."
Paul R.,"Sunnyside, NY",0,1,,3.0,12/4/2016,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time on Saturday at around 3:45.  There was over a 60 minute wait.   Once we were seated there was another 45 minute for the meal.  The food was good, but not great.  The restaurant reminded me of Junior's in Manhattan, which is our place to eat before or after Broadway shows.  The difference is the wait was longer, the service was not as good, and even the Carrot Cheesecake was not as rich and thick as Juniors, although it was very sweet.  Our 3 hour experience to have an early dinner ended up being nothing really special. I'd think twice about bringing  your family there and spending over a hundred dollars for average service and maybe a little bit above average food, with an above average wait time."
Becky F.,"REGO PARK, NY",0,35,,2.0,5/4/2017,"I like the cheesecake, and the food isn't bad for a chain, however, the service at this location is consistently bad. At first I thought it was opening pains but now believe it is the norm. I have been to other locations and have never had issues so not sure what the problem is here. Diners beware......"
Farhana H.,"Queens, NY",0,17,2,2.0,4/14/2017,"I was waiting for this branch to open for a long time. But was quite disappointed at the service. I already knew I had to wait to be seated so the hour wait was not a surprise. But after my cousins and I ordered our food it took a very long time, so the manager came out and apologized. And we appreciated that. But when we went to order dessert most of the cheesecakes were finished and we all ended up ordering the same items. But the disappointing part was that I paid tip in cash and when I went back and checked later, I was charged tip again on my card. I just felt that the management should be informed because I know this is a great restaurant."
Jennifer F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,6,4.0,6/3/2017,"Satisfied my sweet tooth!  It was sweet and fulling! The cheesecake was such a good dessert. Forgot the name, need to go find that out!"
Anna B.,"New York, NY",0,26,2,3.0,5/28/2017,"The food is really good, just like any other cheesecake factory, but the wait is ridiculous! Avoid weekend dinners. Me and my husband went there around 5:30 and waited an hour and a half just to get a buzzer and had to wait another hour and a half to get seated. Best time to go is during lunch time or early evenings on weekdays. The food and service is pretty good if you have the time and patience to wait over 2 hours for seating."
Brad S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,,5.0,11/20/2016,"You can't go wrong with the cheesecake factory, the food is amazing, dessert is to die for and very fair price. Chicken madeira and shrimp scampi are my favorite dishes. Can't wait to go back."
Deyaniry B.,"New Lots, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,4/21/2017,Ordered a chicken bellagio to go. First of all when i called i had to wait like 10 minutes for someone to take my order. I pick up my order and when i got home noticed the dish is completely bad. The chicken bellagio is a pasta in pesto sauce with chicken cutlets and prosciutto and arugula on top. No prosciutto no arugula amd the pasta had absolutely noo flavor in it. Not even a himt of pesto. DONT COME HERE
Philip H.,"New York, NY",0,1,,2.0,11/18/2016,"first off they nailed it with the design of the restaurant, Great acoustics, large spacse broken up into smaller which is pleasant. having worked and managed restaurants I know how challenging and opening can be. Especially hard for the staff to be fully familiar with such a huge menu. Visited thursday and they were out of ginger ale, really guys; you couldn't just go to the store across the street and pick up a case?Waiter was pleasant but stumbled on answering questions. avocado spring rolls  were good. burger and carbonara pasta just so so. next time will eat at shake shack and come for a cheese cake."
Michell H.,"Queens, NY",0,3,6,2.0,11/17/2016,"Like many, we were excited that a Cheesecake Factory was opening up in Queens. However, was very disappointed when we were finally seated (about an hour later). We received one waitress and I guess her shift was over so we received another waitress. The orders that were taken from the first waitress was correct, however, when finally received our orders two of dishes were not prepared nor delivered. Take in mind the time was also late after 9 and on a Monday. One of my guests were starving because both orders belong to this person (appetizer and entrée). The manager comes over to apologize, but by this time it does nothing as the food is still missing. Finally when the orders do arrive, they aren't prepared properly. Three of the orders did not taste good either and it was cold. By the time we paid the bill, there was nothing on the bill to compensate the frustration that we incurred, but because the fault was not of the waitress, she received her deserved tip. I do not think we will be going back to this location, but I like to give people another chance, but would like to stress that we were highly disappointed in the service and food quality. Would not recommend the Shrimp with Angel hair pasta (very bland), chicken marsala (which is normally good, but it was sweet and something was off) and spicy pasta with chicken (just wasn't good) Almost forgot to add we also ordered cheesecake which is the highlight of the place, but the cheesecake was semi frozen! After writing this review, I am second guessing on ever returning to this location."
