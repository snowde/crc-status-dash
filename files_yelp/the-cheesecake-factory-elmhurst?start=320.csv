Chris W.,"Charlotte, NC",75,1,1,2.0,11/15/2016,Server didn't know I was his table. Offered bread. Came back and offered bread again. Asked for wine and water. Took 15 mins for both. No straw given or offered. Gave me wrong glassware for water. Didn't offer my guest who came before they delivered the wine anything. I ordered a drink for her. Took 10 mins for is to both get straws. Ordered all food. Appetizer was made incorrect but we weren't told. Ate a whole app before second came. Entrees came too. Manager came to fix but didn't do enough listening and lacked empathy and urgency.  ordered round 2 of drinks with manager but that took 15 mins.  Food was good. That's the second star here. In the end the experience was very subpar. Despite the manager being aware of the issues the ending was mundane and all he offered was a single free app. It wasn't about the money; it's how they made us feel. Our experience was not valued and the cheesecake brand was not shown to be as good as advertised.
Gina B.,"Forest Hills, NY",38,2,1,2.0,11/14/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory as I have frequented a few locations in the south. I was very excited when I heard about the location opening at Queenscenter Mall. Two of my girlfriends and my self decided to meet up for dinner, I was told the wait is 30 minutes which ended up being 1 hour. When we were finally seated we ordered drinks and appetizers and that portion was pretty fast. The waitress assured us our entree would be out in approximately 20 mins, we did not get our entrees until an hour and twenty minutes later. She came out once and explained that there was a mix up with their computer and our orders. We then asked to speak to a manager because it took another 20 minutes after her explanation and our food still didn't arrive at our table. We had to make a complaint before it happened.  At that point we just wanted to leave but we ordered desert to go and made it clear to them that we had to leave since we spent all of our time waiting. Our cheesecake didn't come out until 20 minutes after they made our to-go bags. That was absolutely the worst experience I ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I am not going back until they have been opened for another 6 months. They need to train their staff properly and also educate them on the menu and it's contents. Our server didn't know there was sausages in the gumbo. And she didn't know how to grate the cheese. Half of it landed on my phone and the table. I am not one to complain even if my service was bad but I do believe that experience should not have equated to us paying."
Achi A.,"New York, NY",24,28,3,3.0,11/12/2016,"Food is so so. Cheesecake is what people usually come here for. I ordered steak and asked for medium, but they served me a very well done and dry steak. Stay away from the steak. Chicken is more appetizing."
Cesar G.,"Queens, New York, NY",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,Well where do we start !!! My daughter and I walked in for a late snack at the bar ( such by the way is first came first served ) sat at a table and waited for 15 min to be told by the server that he has been closed for 30 min ?? Ok well he moved us to a different table .. Sat there with menus and been ignored by the server ... 15 min later another waiter came and introduced him self and ask what will we like to order.. In the middle of all this the table that we sat first was sat and served !!!! This branch is a disaster I been to others CCF's around the United States but this one at the queens center mall is just horrible ... The food took long the drinks took ... Second and last time ...
James O.,"New York, NY",2,14,1,5.0,11/5/2016,Finally got to visit this new location. The experience was awesome. We got there just a little before opening time to beat the rush. The hosts were fast and friendly getting the large crowd waiting sat quickly. We decided to sit at the bar. Drew and Lindsey were amazing. Very attentive. Drinks made fast. Got our order in right away. Both very personable gave us great suggestions on the food. We got the buffalo blasts. They were delicious. The food runner was friendly. Over all this was the perfect Saturday lunch to start the weekend. Definitely coming back!
Larry L.,"Queens, NY",0,28,,5.0,4/4/2017,"We came here on a Friday night at around 6pm, and we were quickly seated. No waiting at all, which was extremely surprising. We ordered our meals and it did take awhile for it to arrive. The manager kept checking in on us and kept us updated. I have been to several Cheesecake Factories and this is the first time any manager checked in on us. 5 stars just for the manager!"
Amy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,5,5.0,10/30/2016,"Food was good, atmosphere was great, wait time was a little long but worth it. The server TJ was awesome I absolutely love love love him. Will come back again and again if for nothing else for TJ..."
Tim S.,"Akron, OH",0,1,,2.0,4/30/2017,Food was good but I ordered the fish n chips. It was good but the menu picture shows 5-6 pieces of fish and when the dinner was brought out to me it was only 3 little pieces of fish. So disappointed for the cost to get so little.
Andria A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,39,14,4.0,2/11/2017,"Came here on a Saturday evening around 4:45 and was told it would be an hour wait for a party of four. And boy did they mean an hour we were called around 5:34 or so. The wait was a little frustrating not because of the time but because their pager only works as far as JC Penney on one side of the mall and only on that floor. I recommend they get a text system so you can enjoy the mall and come back when your table is ready. Nevertheless we were seated, I have to say that the restaurant is dark you really have to struggle to see the menu. We were served sourdough bread that was a little hard and didn't taste good. They also never bought us plates so we ended up with crumbs everywhere as did the table next to us. The pumpernickel bread was much better and served warm. We didn't order  drinks just a couple of waters with lemon, for our entree I had the white chilli chicken it's on the skinnylicious menu it was nice and flavorful. My cousin had the mashed potatoes with the pork chop he said the pork chop was flavorful and the mashed potatoes were excellent. My mom had the Louisiana pasta which I had a taste of. The chicken was well breaded and fried. Lastly my cousin said her steak was wonderful and lean. We also ordered the cheesecakes personally I prefer Juniors downtown brooklyn but their variety is welcomed. Overall they did a good job and our server Lamar was nice and attentive."
Diana B.,"Queens, NY",0,9,,1.0,12/18/2016,"I honestly want to make this review because I felt disrespected as a customer at Cheesecake Factory queens center mall...i am making this review becoz as a a loyal customer of cheesecake for many years, I never experienced such a bad customer service in any of cheesecake restaurants...unfortunately, I did experienced it today at this location...i came to order a cake for our moms 65th bday party today..I specifically ordered a Godiva cheesecake since it's our moms most favorite cake..I went to the counter and asked the lady if they have the 7' inch Godiva cake..she said they don't have in stock..so I said, how about the 10' inch..she said clearly, yes we have it..I was so glad and relieved..coz that's the only cake our mom wants...I waited a long time for the cake since it was a lot of people ahead of me and they were so busy..I didn't mind waiting..they finally gave me the cake..put it in a plastic and I left..my husband and I drove all the way to Yonkers, close to the Bronx to hurry for our moms party..we opened the cake infront of her..to find out it's a red velvet cake...I was so embarrassed coz we know she doesn't like red velvet cake first and foremost..we were apologizing to her coz we know it was a mistake, which ofcourse mom doesn't mind coz it's the thought that counts..so I called the restaurant and told them about it..they transferred me to speak to the manager named Kaitlin...I told her how disappointed I was in a nice manner..then she hold me on the phone for few mins to ask the lady and guy who made a mistake..the manager comes back on the phone..not very accommodating and seems to be in rush..she clearly said.."" I spoke to my staffs and they said u changed ur mind and they showed u the cake and u agreed to switch from Godiva to red velvet cake""..I was stunned...first and foremost, they did not show me the cake before putting it inside the bag..so without hesitation, I told her to pls review ur camera to see who is making up stories...she said, I will call u back and see what I can do..for the meantime, I passed the phone to my husband to speak to the manager..my husband wants to know when is she calling back..the manager (whose name is Kaitlin) was in a rush coz she said it's a busy Sunday for them..didn't give any importance to our complaint..she said she won't know what time she is calling us back..not very friendly and clearly doesn't listen to our sentiments...we decided to drive back to queens from Yonkers just to personally speak to her..she put us on hold for another 20 mins and she got back saying..""ur wife was right, we reviewed the camera and they didn't show the cake to her""..it was fine with us, we were ready to pick up the cake..as soon as we enter the restaurant, we looked for her..we were already calm..she walked towards us, with a very unfriendly face..no charisma..no sincere apology..she just said, ""I got ur Godiva cheesecake""..her apology was not sincere at all..she said, ""it was miscommunication""..I told her, ""look, there is no miscommunication in the first place..you know that your employee lied and you trying to cover them up and made ur customer become a liar""..She was holding the cake while we were talking..I told her, ""I'm sorry I will still call the corporate about this coz I felt disrespected as a loyal customer of cheesEcake factory""..she suddenly said, ""oh, ur still going to call corporate???"" With a raised voice..I told her, I want to speak to ur staffs who made up stories that I was liar and they owe me an apology..she said, ""sorry, I dont want my staffs to talk to the customer""..that answer didn't feel right to me..the next thing we know, she left the cake on the table and turned her back on us..she said, she is very busy and she needs to leave.very disrespectful manager and does not know how to handle upset customers and does not know how to handle pressure at all...another manager came up to us named Eric..he was great..he listened to us and gave his time...i told Eric the same thing that I am going to call corporate..and his response was great..he said, I respect ur decision and u have the right as a customer...I wished I would have spoken To Eric earlier, than the useless manager named Kaitlin..I am going to file my formal complaint to the corporate and I want to make sure that actions will be done..this kind of manager should never be hired in a great company like Cheesecake Factory..she does not deserve the position...and the two staffs who lied should also be reprimanded...I work for patient care and I make sure I respect each individual...coz everybody deserves time and respect at all times... I don't want to give any star on this review..but I'm giving it becoz of Eric manager who was very nice to us..I hope they hire more managers like him I know people would think, damn, it's just a cheesecake...but for me, it's more than just a cheesecake...it's really the respect, service and importance we should give to each person when it's due..thank you"
Mercy C.,"East Meadow, NY",0,2,,1.0,4/4/2017,"I ordered the spaghetti carbonara. All I can say is, I should have stayed at home and made it myself. That is how disappointed I was. I am not a chef and could make it so much better. This dish had no salt and the sauce was terrible. The sauce tasted like they put 10lbs of margarine. It did not taste like butter. It was pure of oil with no favor. What ""chefs"" are cooking at this restaurant that do not even taste the food they make. Definitely not going back."
Tracey L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",54,74,34,1.0,1/4/2017,"The wait is way too long and they expect you to wait within the vicinity of the first floor in order for the buzzer to work. Where do they expect you to wander to when it's 9pm and most stores are about to close? I've never been to any locations before and this was my first time trying it. The Cheesecake Factory is known for their generous portions for their entrees. I've seen it on YouTube and I've heard about it from friends, but the proportion was comparable to portion that they would give you at a fine dining restaurant. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi with Linguine, there was only 3 bites of pasta on my plate. If you pushed the food to one side it would take up 1/4 of the plate. My friend was surprised at how small my plate was when I definitely did not order the small plate option. I wonder if they only give a bite of pasta for the small plate size. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I think my experience would've been better at a different location."
Flo C.,"Orlando, FL",86,24,80,1.0,11/14/2016,"Service is terrible.  Don't come here if you don't have at least over 2 hrs to get your food. We waited over 1h45 on a Monday night to be served. We received our drinks, which took over 20 mins to get, but no bread. We had to complain about how hungry we were after being seated for 45 mins before the waitress finally asked if we would like bread.  Shouldn't bread come right when we are seated?!  The food is nothing spectacular, to endure the wait. At the end of our dinner, we received the wrong cheesecake from what we originally ordered, and our waitress insisted that it was the right cheesecake. Does she think we can't tell the difference between coconut and carrot?!  Then she stands there saying that it's hard to remember what all the cheesecakes look like. If you're not sure, then don't tell us we are wrong. Management needs to retrain their waiting staff because service like that is unacceptable!  And the waitress had the nerve to say ""wasn't the wait worth it?  If you go to any grand openings, there is always a minimum 2 hour wait.""  Wow... this waitress is absolutely ignorant and does not have proper customer service training."
Christine P.,"MASPETH, NY",73,151,3,3.0,1/12/2017,"Based soley on buying cheesecake (to-go) last night, hence the 3 stars. The variety of cheesecakes is amazing especially with the specialty ones that you can get at certain times of the year. The girl was SO sweet at the counter. Although they were busy she was so patient and gave me her opinion on the different cheesecakes. I really wish I remembered her name to include in here. Initially I thought ""wow this is the first time I see they don't have a line. Guess it's cause it's a Wednesday""...*NOT* I walked in and there were a good amount of people waiting to be seated...lol..I will say that I've NEVER been to a cheesecake factory and not had to wait to be seated. It's typical to see a line of people standing and sitting outside of the doors due to the wait, but you gotta do what you gotta do! I wasn't there to dine, but to get a fix and for almost $9 I gotta say my salted caramel cheesecake was bomb when I got home! Oh I also saw someone come in that ordered their cheesecake ahead of time. That's awesome to know! Will update my review when I dine in."
Aya T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,1,2.0,3/27/2017,"I've heard a lot about this place. So I decided to dine there with my boyfriend. When we arrived the host said we need to wait a little bit. Seems like crowded place. And we ended up by waiting an hour outside. We were very  hungry and made order right away. The waiter was nice and tried to do his best. But we had to wait our food another hour. The food wasn't so good. Pasta was dry and not fresh (taste like it was in the fridge forever).  Diane steak was good though but  too small portion(even for me, I'm skinny and don't eat a lot) finally about cheesecake! I ordered mango-lemon  cheesecake which was too sweet and impossible to eat. I would recommend to order the plane one. I've tried vanilla cheesecake at Barnes noble bookstore which is only 4.99$ . Definitely not gonna visit the Cheesecake Factory again. It doesn't worth money and time."
M L.,"Queens, NY",2,12,3,3.0,3/26/2017,Just okay I think the food is not as fresh during lunch time. The fried fish isn't that crisp. Iced tea was not good. We also ordered pasta but the noodles seemed to be overcooked and soggy. I would advise to go at night BC the food was better when I came at night
Jennifer L.,"West Hempstead, NY",4,174,1,5.0,4/18/2017,"This place is great. The bread here is very good, I got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which was delicious. The strawberry daiquiri was excellent. The Lemonade was nice and refreshing. The waiter was nice and friendly.  I can't wait and go back and try their cheesecake."
Lielani L.,"Bronx, NY",37,47,33,2.0,12/7/2016,"I rarely ever get to TCF bc of course up until now we don't have one near by but what I love is of course the cheesecake and their bread!! Lol our server who was the most UNATTENTIVE I've ever experienced informed us they were out of bread....what???? What restaurant anywhere in the world runs out of bread? Anyway... food took about 20 mins to come out, he didn't bring our drinks till about 10 mins after we got our food and my order was wrong. Food overall was ok and the cheesecake of course was great but when I asked for a recommendation as I usually get the same banana cream all the time, he had no clue how to answer or offer ANY opinion- YOU'RE A SERVER AT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY...SERIOUSLY?? Then we had to track him down for our check-20 mins go by. I asked for the bill to be split a certain way, did calculation and even made it easy writing the specific amounts and the last name for that card and he comes back with the bill split in half. So pretty much someone who only had cheesecake had to pay 25 bucks out of pocket bc our server was incompetent. I will be sticking to once a year when I get to travel and come across one, this place was not to standard on overall operations at all."
Arianna Y.,"Queens, NY",48,62,10,3.0,11/8/2016,"Not going to lie, I've always had good experience when I trekked out to the one on Long Island, and was super excited when I caught a glimpse of this place on a recent trip to QC Mall. My only problem is trying to settle on what to order. When the menu is damn near 10 pages long and everything looks amazing and you're the most indecisive person ever - ordering becomes anxiety-inducing! Came for lunch, and they have amazing lunch specials with a lot of options, served until 5. Trust me, if you've never been here before and see JUST the lunch-sized portion - you're mind is going to be blown by what a normal dish looks like. Alas, that's what this place is known for. I ate half of my meal, and still had a whole other large portion to take home. I ordered the meatloaf special, which was two large chunks of meat, along with mashed potatoes and gravy, and a corn succotash. I really enjoyed it, though my dining partner said that he felt that it was too breadcrumb-y and wished he could taste more meat. He ordered the ribeye steak, which I only had a quick bite of and was indifferent to, but he said it was tasty. Waiter situation was a little strange, had a guy approach at first and something was a little off... about him, then after serving us for like 10-15 minutes, showed up with another server that he claimed he ""told us about"", that she would be our new server, and he disappeared. They were pretty attentive, though, on top of checking in and refills, etc. Now, to the important part - the cheesecake. Yes, I'm that basic bitch that's all about the seasonal stuff   once fall rolls around, so you better believe that I ordered that pumpkin pecan, and it did not disappoint. Basically a layer of pumpkin cheesecake sandwiched between a pumpkin pie crust and topping. The crust was kind of hard to get through, but yummy nonetheless. My only gripe is a general one, and it's that they go way overboard with the whipped cream, which isn't even needed to begin with. Also tasted the white chocolate macadamia nut blondie one, which I had before a long time ago, and while you can't go wrong with that combo, it is excessively sweet, so be prepared for that. What can you really expect here, it's The Cheesecake Factory! It serves it's purpose, and that's all that matters."
Miguel P.,"Richmond Hill, NY",0,23,10,4.0,2/15/2017,Would give 5 stars but the drinks suck. Foods always awsome tho! For two people figure youll spend a cool hundred bucks. One drink each. Customer service is good too
