Natalya F.,"South Richmond Hill, NY",1,1,,1.0,12/11/2016,"I usually don't write reviews but this is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. My waitress was inattentive, our food took forever to come and all we had was breakfast.  By the time our food came it was cold, my boyfriend ordered waffles we never got any syrup. And the best thing on my way to the bathroom I saw a piece of chicken lying on the floor and several associates walked by without bothering to pick it up. Coming to NYC was the worst decision TCF has ever made, this is a terrible look for their brand. I will never come back here. Oh and BTW the table next to me found a piece of hair in their food. Disgusting!!!!"
Mei C.,"Flushing, NY",0,1,,1.0,1/24/2017,"This review is for cheesecake only... and it was major disappointment.  Called ahead to place an order for two strawberry cheesecakes for pick up, told I would be transferred to the bakery, placed on hold for several minutes, decided to hang up and called back again.  Same exact outcome, placed on hold for some more, hangs up again.  Thought I would call back one more time, better luck this time a manager picks up, takes my order and told me it would be ready for me in a few minutes. Arrived to no order placed under my name. At this point, I think whatever, orders again and waited.  Long story short, after all that incompetency and inefficiency, I figure the cheesecake would make up for it... WRONG.  Cheesecake was old and stale, with top half inch dry and tasteless and bottom crumb soggy.  While I love the Long Island location and have always looked forward to going, this new location near where I live was unfortunately a major disappointment."
Oriana R.,"Queens, NY",0,1,1,1.0,11/5/2016,"The worst service ever after a two hour wait I never got served. They failed in queens that's why Long Island is always better. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! Food is shitty,drinks water down, waitress needs more training and host need to change their attitude. You are working at an all America restaurant not a high-end place."
Farhana R.,"Woodside, NY",28,28,11,1.0,1/8/2017,"Service is horrible here, waited an hour for food to come out, then comes out so cold that its been sittinh there. Servers are not attentive at all. I rather drive an hour to the long island location then to come to this one again."
Aileen C.,"Orlando, FL",160,150,306,1.0,11/15/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory with a group of my friends yesterday and we had Wendy F as a server. From the second she took our drink order, my friend made a comment, I don't like her. I didn't notice anything from the first interaction with her, but after waiting 15 mins for just our water and drinks, we notice not only did it take us 1 hour to get seated, it took forever to get WATER. Then we were expecting us to be given bread... but 30 mins later, nothing. We had to complain to ask how long out food is going to take and Wendy finally goes, ""since you're so hungry, do you want some bread to hold you over?""  Wow... talk about horrible customer service. Many more things went wrong that night but I don't even want to type it out because it angers me so much. The management is horrible here. Train your staff better or you guys might as well shut down. I rather drive to Long Island for the Cheesecake Factory then to eat mediocre food in queens."
Sara P.,"Hollis, Queens, NY",14,3,,1.0,3/1/2017,"I arrived at the Cheesecake Factory at 9pm this evening to experience one of the worst services ever.   The waitress came to our table 30 minutes after we sat down and without introduction she placed bread on our table - no water, just bread.   Another 15 minutes later she asked us what we want as appetizers.  We did not want to wait longer so I let her know the appetizers we wanted to order and also the entrees.   25 minutes later the appetizers came and 30 minutes more and the entree arrived.   The only quick thing she did was give us the bill without even asking if we wanted dessert.  Of course we wanted dessert -  this is after all the Cheesecake Factory!   We walked up to the dessert bar and were informed that they were closed.   Really nice looking place but needs a lot of work on the staff.  There is little awareness of customers.  Disengagement is a recipe for failure."
Jenny W.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",0,8,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"Terrible wait and service, especially one Indian female receptionist is absolutely clueless. She keeps messing up wait time (forget to register customers in computer), and yet lies about it, totally incompetent. I will go to the Cheesecake Factory in Long Island, better service and more organized."
H H.,"Queens, NY",0,11,6,3.0,1/2/2017,"Glad to have the option in Queens! The food is as you would expect it, more or less. Only complaint was that we got a pick up order and they forgot some extra utensils, butter, and bread that we had requested. Parking is pretty much a pain unfortunately due to its location in the mall but it's a Cheesecake Factory."
Vanessa C.,"Woodside, NY",3,63,29,3.0,12/20/2016,"80 minute wait for okay food and super slow service. The waitress, Amanda P., was awesome! Super nice and very helpful. That's the only reason this place gets 3 stars."
Ronald R.,"Forest Hills, NY",99,5,,2.0,1/19/2017,Today was the 1st time we went to this location we got seated right away wasn't to busy for lunch but we sat there for almost 15 minutes before deciding to leave because no waitor came at all.
Jacob A.,"Jamaica, NY",100,1,3,1.0,12/24/2016,"Hot mess hot hot mess. I preordered a cheesecake and the person on the phone was nice and said it would be ready for me by 11:30am. I got there waited in line and when I got to the register they said it wasn't ready and that they haven't even started working on it. That was 12:24pm. They told me it would take 10-15 minutes to prep. 45 minutes later and after asking a few times I finally got the cheesecake. When I spoke to the manager he gave me a lame excuse and said the person on the phone should have not said it would be ready by a certain time. They had no system behind that counter and I feel bad for them back there because they looked overwhelmed and over worked. I don't like to complain on service, but this was a unique situation. The manager did not even apologize for the wait time. Overall I did not have a pleasant experience and I hope they improve moving forward."
Anthony M.,"Jamaica, NY",69,17,,5.0,12/23/2016,Great service not a bad wait time they said an hour and we waited 30 minutes Ayana took great care of us happy holidays
Angel S.,"Bronx, NY",95,3,4,1.0,1/2/2017,"I don't usually write reviews because I know the industry so well and let many things fly by; but not this time. The wait was 40 minutes for 2 people. Not a problem, it was New Year's Day night and expected it to be packed! Half a star for very accurate wait times! We were seated at 9:55 and 10 minutes later my waitress came and took our full order. 10 minutes isn't SO bad, I understand you guys are SOMEWHAT busy; it happens, and based on the waitress's bland and robotic introduction I figured she was new.  Appetizer came out in 5 minutes, it was a salad so that made sense. Half a point for that. Everything was ordered at 10:05... appetizer came out at 10:10... but here's what really pissed me off; we got our food at 10:55! 50 minutes for a medium steak and some al dente pasta with shrimp that takes 20 minutes tops to make? Me and my girlfriend waited and waited and waited... I was patient up until about 45 minutes in and asked to speak to a manager. I had to ask a hostess because there was NO MANAGER MAKING THEIR ROUNDS TOUCHING TABLES, SO NO ONE WOULD NOTICE THAT WE DIDNT EVEN HAVE OUR ENTREES. The hostess informed a manager and said someone would be with me; but guess what, no one came until the food came out another 10 minutes later. The manager himself ran the food and apologized because the kitchen was backed up (I appreciate the apology) but let's be real, your kitchen wasn't backed up. To be honest, you guys weren't even busy. I know what busy is, I actually manage THE MOST BOOKED AND VISITED RESTAURANT IN THE CITY; so yes, I'm very familiar with the industry. I really don't expect anything for minor mess ups in restaurants, but then the bill comes and I'm charged for EVERYTHING including the MEDIOCRE food that took about an hour for me to get. Seriously, not even desert as an apology? Being from the industry I sure damn would NEVER charge a person who waits more than 25 minutes for their entrees, NO MATTER HOW BUSY MY PLACE IS. It seems like you guys don't know how to keep your guests happy and need to teach your management team how to properly be proactive and handle situations before they get worse.  Recap:  Food mediocre Food took an hour Still charged me Not worth it at all: this is coming from a manager of a much busier and bigger restaurant, so yeah you know it's bad."
Teresa C.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,107,7,5.0,11/8/2016,"I came to the Cheesecake factory Friday October 25th the first weekend that they were opened. I already knew that it would be crazy. But I went. It was about a two hour wait. I got there after six. My boyfriend and I gave our name. Walked around the mall. When we came back we got the buzzer . No problem as we just talked until we got called. We were seated in the outer area. Quieter then the indoor. Our server Richard was really nice. Ordered. We got our drinks and had some bread. They had difficulties. I could understand that it just opened and got hit hard. After a very long time. I was not counting but seemed like 45 minutes over a manager came over and took care of us. She had us bring what we asked. Then our food came. We ate, ordered dessert. When we got the bill they really were good about the whole thing. They took off not only my meal but an extra amount for the inconvenience. I will be back after the holidays or when they first open in the afternoon when its a little less crazy. Thanks for making us feel welcomed and for making sure we will come back!"
Eliza F.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,53,,1.0,12/16/2016,This place is disgusting. We always go to the Long Island location and never have an issue. Waited two hours to eat they messed up my food twice. My son got two chicken balls not fingers. Sangria tasted like watered down Kool aid
Ana C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,,1.0,1/14/2017,Avoid this location. The hospitality at this location is  really bad. The Manager was very unprofessional and rude. And the waiting time @4:45pm was THREE hours.
Naomy H.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,,5.0,11/21/2016,Amazing food. The Lunch specials are great and very affordable. The portions are very good too. Our server was Isis. She was great from start to finish. Amazing people skills and very good server. Ask for her if you go!
V T.,"Queens, NY",0,9,7,4.0,12/22/2016,"Delicious cheesecakes, no doubt, but now it is 10:10pm on a Thursday and it takes literally 30 mins to take out. I mean a ""ready to go slice cheesecake"" but takes 30 mins from the time you order to leave. Management need improvement. Extremely unorganized."
Luis V.,"Woodside, NY",100,1,,1.0,12/20/2016,If i could give this place 0 stars i would. We went to this place for my fiances sisters birthday. We where one of the first people to arrive at the cheesecake factory and still waited 1 hour. It was 4 of us we all ordered differents foods. My fiance ordered the filet mignon and her sister ordered the gumbo with brown rice. I ordered a kobe burger with fries and my fiances brother ordered the burger as well. After waiting for 40 mins the waitress brings over my fiances filet mignon and her sisters gumbo (The food was cold). She then tells us that our burgers should be out soon that after 40 minutes our sweet potato fries where not ready. (40 minutes for french fries?). The waitress then comes out with one burger saying my kobe burger still isnt ready. I didn't know it took over 40 mins for a burger and fries. After waiting another 10 mins i finally just asked for the manager (which also took her bout 15 mins to even come to my table) I cancelled the burger and sat with no food. Overall horrible experience i do not recommend eating here. The food wasn't even good so save your money and go somewhere better where they know what there doing in the front of house and back of house.
Michelle C.,"Bayside, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/22/2017,"We had a party of 6, got there at 12, and waited over 2 hours to be seated (8:00). Fine. But then the waitresses were giving us a lot of attitude, unattentive, and looked downright annoyed. Took our order half an hour later and we finally got our food at 10:00. I got the Shrimp scampi and Steak combo (22$) and asked for a medium rare. I got three pieces of steak that were the size of chicken nuggets, well done, and three pieces of shrimp with a small scoop of potato mashed in the center of the plate. I'm sorry, but seriously? For $22?? The waitress was still giving attitude after she messed up my order. The manager came by and did nothing. No apology, nothing. I asked for a pasta instead, who which she said ""better late than never"" when she handed it to me. It might as well have been never because that shit was bland as hell, I dumped at least a teaspoon of salt and pepper onto it in order for it to taste like anything. Still, it tasted like flour. The cheesecake is grainy and so mushy it felt like I was eating custard. By the time we left, it was 11. Thanks for making us wait 4 hours for the shittiest meal I have ever had. I had better service at McDonalds."
