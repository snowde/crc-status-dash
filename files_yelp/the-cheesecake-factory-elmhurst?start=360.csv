Michael S.,"Rego Park, NY",0,23,6,4.0,10/29/2016,"Food and service is excellent - what you would expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  However, this restaurant is a lot smaller than other Cheesecake Factory, so I expect the wait for a table would be more as compared to the Cheesecake Factory in LI or Yonkers."
SK K.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",0,9,,4.0,11/12/2016,"long wait, but totally worth it.  The food is good (not gourmet, but wasn't expecting it to be), we came for the desserts and were not disappointed.  Nice add to the neighborhood"
Armando M.,"Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/6/2016,"I went to eat with my lovely family and I heard this new restaurant open up at queens center mall. my hopes and expectations were high but when I first came in .they took my order fast and had a wonderful and pleasing service from the waitress named Yuri .but the food took a long time around 50 min ,which was a long time for a simple meal, I asked the waitress why did the food take soo long. she told us the manager was coming to talk to us because we gave in the complaint that the food took too long.when the Manger named Erick came to my table(14) he apologize and said there was many party's and  it was busy from the party's that is the reason the food came late.I think cheesecake cake factory is not prepared to have parties and regular service and should close if they can't keep up with there customers needs and for logic usually when a restaurant makes a mistake, the house sends something extra to apologize, this is what a professional restaurant will usually do,I don't recommended to go to this restaurant. If the food took 50 min to come out for that reason we did not order the famous cheesecake."
Rochelle R.,"Queens, New York, NY",0,4,1,2.0,4/26/2017,"VERY SLOW SERVICE. Went on a Wednesday night dinner. Came around 8:45 and left at 10:45. Stayed for 2 hours for dinner and we just ordered the main course and a couple of drink, no appetizers. Had to wait 30mis for someone to take our drink orders and waited for almost an hour for our food to arrived. This is after waiting for 30mins at least before being told that they ran out of one of our orders. The manager offered us a free cheesecake for the inconvenience but when I asked for the bill from another waitress as I can't seem to find where our waitress went, the complimentary cheesecake was billed until I pointed it out to our waitress. Have to get our cheesecake to go instead of eating it there as it was almost closing time. This is only after I stood up to look for the counter just to pay the bill so we can leave and remained standing by our table. Almost wanted to just walked out of there after paying the bill at the front instead. And to top it all, a party of 7 people arrived after us but got served and left before us. One of the slowest and baddest experience I had in a restaurant. Food was ok not even special. My sisters or friends will have to literally drug me to get me back to that place again."
Fa D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,1/20/2017,"3 hours to be seated. then the host  partially sat 5 out of 9 people. when  we arrived at the table . saw another table free, but was told it is a table for 10..... we said  we are 9 people and a baby and they refused to sit us there. then the host walked out on us leaving us standing awkwardly  there. when we complained the only answer was "" well we were trying to accommodate you""... . the host just left us there saying that she is not dealing with ""us""... the manager was worse trying to justify the host behavior instead of finding a solution.... only reason i agree to stay was this was a birthday surprise and kids were tired at that point... worse service ever."
Jannaia A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,8,1,1.0,5/18/2017,"I will be posting this on everything possible so the owners of this franchise know how horrible their employees are. Lets off with, we were told our table will take 40 minutes to be ready. After 1 hour we went to check on our table and the hostess forgot about us. How nice! Then our server was horrible. I dont think I need to go into details about how horrible she was. Food took forever to get to us. The employees were loud! Everybody walking around talking to each other instead of doing their jobs. People applying lipstick in front of customers instead of going into the bathroom. Our server was really forgetful. To top it all off! I got pasta which included mushrooms. When I placed my order I said NO MUSHROOMS! Yet still when my food came it had mushrooms. I told her and she blamed the kitchen. I was told they will remake it all from strach because its not a hard dish. I ate some that night and I didnt get any mushrooms. Fast foward to the next day. Im eating my food and what do I see? Mushrooms! I am allergic. If I have intense reaction to the food I will sue! Ps. We were there May 17th 2017. Check your employees"
Annmarie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,,2.0,11/6/2016,"Not worth the trip. Worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory. Expected a long wait since the place just opened but didn't expect to wait over 30 minutes for some lemon wedges for our drinks. Ordered factory nachos and it came out wrong, was promised it would be fixed and it came out wrong again. Ordered sandwich without Mayo and surprise, it had Mayo. Fries cold and salty. Do your self a favor and head to Long Island or white plains!"
Jalissa R.,"Maspeth, NY",29,4,,3.0,11/6/2016,"I don't like leaving bad reviews but i have to because I left kinda upset, first the wait we were told 10 mins we were sat in 25, I use to be a hostess and I know better to over quote then under quote especially if it's packed. Now let's start with our server Denise pretty nice lady, however she was a bit slow and forgetful all forgivable especially since this place just opened. We never received bread and other servers had to keep stopping at our table to offer us a refill, for the food itself boy was I pissed when we were told the appetizer we wanted they didn't have which was the fried mac n cheese balls which was fine but that meant I couldn't get that as my side which is what I normally get when I go to any other Cheesecake Factory . My husband and I opted for the hot spinach dip and chips it was good nothing special, what really threw me off was that when my husband ordered his ribeye they said they were out....so first Mac n cheese and now a ribeye????i was baffled how a restaurant could be out of something? Anyway I ordered the Parmesan and herb crusted chicken which was really good and my husband got the same thing and really enjoyed it. When it was time to order dessert we were so full but wanted to take dessert home we even conversed with Denise how we couldn't eat anymore and she said it is nice to eat at home in your pjs, we thought we were all on the same page that we wanted dessert to go, out comes Denise with 2 plates of cheese cake, we were confused especially since we joked about eating the cheesecake in our pjs so we tell Denise and she goes I thought you said you wanted it for here and took the plates back, my husband and I looked at each other a laughed in confusion since we did say to go twice but it's fine maybe she was overwhelmed they did double seat her which means 2of her tables were sat at the same time, me and my husband then a family of 4 which is unfair there should've been a 3-5 min gap for her tables to be sat. Now to the cheesecake it alone deserves 5 stars I got an Oreo cheese cake my husband got the s'mores cheesecake my god they were amazing if I never come back her for the food I will definitely come back for the cheesecake. I really hope they fix the problems because it'd be quite a shame that the first Cheesecake Factory in queens doesn't live up to the hype and the other cheesecake factories."
Shabaz A.,"Queens, NY",145,5,,1.0,11/1/2016,this place is awful. a fucking garden salad (leaves on a bowl) took 30 mins!!! no joke. food comes out cold. like why are you in business
Ayanna G.,"Queens, NY",0,3,,5.0,10/30/2016,I had a very pleasant experience with my first visit ever to The Cheesecake Factory. The food was very good. I had the potato tots for my appetizer and the Baja tacos for my entree and also for my drink I had a Blood Orange Margarita. My boyfriend orderd a burger well done but he received it medium rare and had to send it back. the waiter was very friendly and apologetic.The manager even came out to apologize and made sure we were ok. At the end of our night the waiter ended up taking the burger of our bill and told me  can choose any cheesecake slice for free. I am very much looking forward to returning for the great food and amazing service.
Diana J.,"New York, NY",15,52,5,2.0,12/27/2016,"Clearly, if you've never visited the long island location, the five star reviews below me might seem sane. They couldnt be farther from the truth. Ive been to cheesecake factory in long island many, many times. Everytime I go, I make sure bistro shrimp pasta is ordered along with the usual stuff I order like the hibachi steak, burgers, etc. I know the taste of the pasta like the back of my hand - it has the perfect pinch of lemon and a generous amount of chicken. The one i received at this location (mind you it was my first time at elmhurst one) the pasta was SO overcooked, it wasnt the same linguine type pasta, there was no chicken (was only shrimp) and the size was small, there wasnt that same lemon taste and tasted horrible. Furthermore, my fork and spoon still had food residue from previous users. Order came super late as well. Never ever coming back. Please learn how to make food and wash your utensils correctly. Seriously spent so much $$ here for crappy food"
James S.,"Queens, NY",27,4,,1.0,3/20/2017,"We did go Saturday night for my brother's birthday. After waiting more than 1 hour for the table our waitress ask for drinks, we ordered 2 bottles of wine and place an order. The pouring of each glass was terrible, it seems as she wanted us to order 2 more bottles. When the food came 2 people were left without their order, one of them the birthday one. The waitress never came back to check, after 5 minutes we manage to get the attention of a manager and told him we were missing 2 plates. He came back 10 minutes later with only one, without a word he left, still no sign of our server, we wait another 10 minutes, and the person without a dinner call another server and told her she did not want her salmon anymore. 5 minutes later the server came back with the salmon, after been told we did not want it anymore, she left without an apology. When dinner was over we ask for her to light a candle for our birthday person, she came back with a glass filled with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. The food is ok, but not good enough to get the horrible service we experienced. We will never go back to that place or recomend it to anyone."
Joey D.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,,1.0,12/24/2016,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I met a friend here for dinner and I arrived before her and I was seated before she got there. I waited at my table for about 15 minutes and was not asked if I needed anything until she got there. Not even served a water. Once she arrived the waiter came up and we ordered. We got spinach dip as an appetizer and it was ok. We ordered our entrees as well. My chicken Marsala was fine, but she ordered the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. When she received it, it was simply chicken and noodles. There were no peas, mushrooms, pancetta, or tomatoes. We told the server and he offered to bring out the missing ingredients. We found this odd because we did not want a plate of the missing ingredients so we asked for it to be made again. After 45 minutes, we still had no replacement and we asked the waiter where it was. He said he would go check and another 20 minutes passed with nothing. We finally called for a manager and he went to check on it. 15 minutes passed and our food finally came out. The lady brought our food to the table, dropped it aggressively in front of my friend and said ""you're welcome"" without asking if it looked okay. She gave us no opportunity to say thank you and we were blatantly disrespected. We called the manager again and told him what had happened. He simply apologized and was not offering anything else. I had to tell him that I was not paying for her food and he finally said he would take it off and offered us cheesecake. I was ok with the outcome the manager offered, but I felt like this all could have been avoided if the staff here was professional and knew how to properly treat their guests. At the end of the day the rude lady who delivered our food caused the company to lose $30+ and she needs to understand that if she acts like that she should find a job somewhere else. I will never go to this location again and will think twice before going to any other location because I do not want to have to go through this ever again."
Ginny M.,"Woodside, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/12/2016,"This is honestly the worst experience I had dining out!! I came out with a party of 7 to celebrate a birthday on a MONDAY!!! They told us the wait was 45 minutes and really we waited two hours. The manager was talking to our party about the whole situation but she was 0 help with anything, she told my boyfriend she would give us free cheesecake cause of the inconvenience but then the waiter told us the manager went back on what she said. When we finally sat down they did not give any utensils until we had to ask for it twice from different waiters. Then the food it self took almost an hour long and it was cold! The waiter kept on forgetting to bring us our drinks or any other thing we needed. After finally finishing our food we asked for the check they didn't give it to us, the waiter passed by our table a least 7 times and just kept ignoring us. This was terrible, the Cheesecake Factory was suppose to be a simple outing with family but ended up being an annoying dinner. We all agreed that this was a terrible idea and we will not be coming back here. If I could give this place 0 stars I would, I never write reviews but this place was the absolute worst!"
Eileen R.,"New York, NY",0,10,,1.0,1/11/2017,"Like someone said before me, this location stinks.  Went for lunch, ordered a sandwich and instead od fries I wanted a salad.  After about half an hour of waiting, someone brought me my sandwich and said my salad was not ready yet but she did not whant my sandwich to get cold.  What?  What can take so long to throw a salad together?  After I fnished half my sandwich my wairtress asked if I needed anything.  I told her I did not get my salad yet.  She came whit my salad and all that was in it were different lettuce leaves.  No tomatoes, no onions, no anything and this took 45 min.?  I waited sooo long for a Chessecake factory to come to NYC and now I know why it took so long, they know that the people in NYC are horrible workers.  Plus my dipping sauce that came whit my sandwich was in a coffee mug that was hal full and it was difficult to dip my sandwhich,  plus the mug had a brown ring arount the inside which could of been from the sauce or coffee.  Needless to say I did not dip my sandwich.  I felt like I was on the show th Worst Cooks instead od a restaurant."
Karim A.,"Woodside, NY",0,3,,2.0,12/15/2016,"Okay first thing first the wait wasn't that bad so for the first time there I expected a longer wait it was like 15 minutes, the service was great the waitress was really happy (Isis). Then it went down from here after my girlfriend and I order, we order a appetizer (factory nachos) pasta and a burger (bacon bacon). The nachos took forever as the manager informed us and gave us a cheesecake for free yes great! Nachos were alright, we got our main dishes at the same time so my girlfriend and I couldn't enjoy it I expect the burger to be good and I'm gonna be honest that was the worst burger I ever ate in my life my girlfriend didn't feel good after she ate her paste at least the cheesecake was good but that took forever too.I don't know went wrong maybe it was the time we went I was so shocked cause I expected the best but maybe next you guys will be better thank sorry for the negativity just wanted to tell you what went wrong what should be fixed"
