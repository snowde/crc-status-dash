Ariel G.,"Oceanside, NY",185,16,42,4.0,11/5/2017,"Great time! The servers are usually nice, the food is made well and comes out pretty fast. It's super loud all of the time though. Sometimes the amount of screaming kids gets annoying though."
Joanna T.,"New York, NY",4,33,1315,1.0,5/29/2017,"This place is a nightmare. Everything that you hope a restaurant isn't, is Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure if the other locations are this bad, but the service here was horrible enough our party had to leave after we were seated. I could not imagine food tasting anything near okay with such horrid service. We definitely lost our appetite.  We waited less than 30 min for a table for 4 people on a holiday Monday night, which isn't bad...except the servers here aren't servers at all. The only thing they know how to do is walk around with an apron pretending to be busy. They don't greet, are either rude or expressionless, do not ask if they can bring you anything, avoid eye contact, etc. The people up front that hand out buzzers and walk you to your table at least acknowledge that you exist.  Our server brought us bread after 15 min... no knives, no water, just walked away ignoring us. We had one person on the way about to walk in and our server almost kicked us out for not having everyone there. Honestly wanted to avoid this location when I saw that it was rated less than 2 stars, but I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Bad idea. Will not be coming back here, ever. Going to any fast food place in the qcm food court is better than this Cheesecake Factory. We went to red lobster instead and everything was amazing as always. My advice would be to avoid Cheesecake Factory altogether and just go to Red lobster. They never disappoint. I ended up tipping our waiter there a very generous amount. I have no idea what the people here are being paid to do; you get better waiting service from a deli. I don't think they even deserve my one star."
Waheda I.,"Queens Village, NY",53,143,224,3.0,10/29/2016,"I'm not the type to go to a restaurant during its opening week. Everything is hectic and crazy. All that can be avoided by going a month or two later. Being my sister works there, me and a friend decided to stop by. In a sentence I can say, it was crazy.  We came in an 5 pm on Friday and was told that a table would be free in an hour and that we should come back. After the hour we come back and we're given a pager. When it vibrates that means a table is ready. We waited over an hour and half! We finally get a table and it was so hectic. The servers were all over the place. My friend got the wrong dish and had to wait over 45 mins to get her correct dish. Apparently that qualifies for a discounted price or a free dish?????? I always try not to give the wait staff a hard time but with all the waiting we did and to have the wrong dish served to us I guess I should have asked for something.  The food.......well I guess you can't have really high standards for chain restaurants. I paid $11 for 5 dumplings. That is outrageous anywhere. But of we hadn't ordered the appetizer we would have been sitting there without any food for an hour. At one point one of the 10 waiters I had asked if I wanted bread? Yes after 30 mins of nothing we'd like some bread. The pasta wasn't spicy. Creamy and mild. I guess the food is catered to American tastes.  The CHEESECAKE. That was definitely the highlight and worth every bit of the hype it gets. It was so creamy and decadent. Everyone should experience the Cheesecake that is offered here. Overall I'd say wait till the hype dies down a bit. Everyone is frazzled and crazy. Also those prices are crazy. Lunch special ends at 5 pm. And the prices are half! If you can, come before 5. You'd definitely save some money and hopefully avoid the crazy crowd."
Léa K.,"Flushing, NY",11,49,15,4.0,6/20/2017,"I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory but heard so many good things about them , I got very excited to see one opening in Queens. Be ready to wait in line for a while. The food itself was decent and the cheesecake, delicious. I would definitely go back , most likely at a quiet time !"
Prianka M.,"Queens, NY",133,5,16,4.0,8/2/2017,"When we got there in the evening, there was about a 15 minute wait. There's a display of all the different cheesecakes up front   I had the tiramisu cheesecake which was amazing!!"
Marina C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",124,443,93,1.0,3/29/2017,"Ok I'm finally done with Cheesecake Factory, the desserts are good but pricey for previously frozen cakes. The issue I have is with their food. We came during happy hour since I had a hour to kill before I could pick up my phone from the Apple Store.  We got a table without having to wait.. ordered a few items. Already had lunch not too long ago, so we weren't hungry. The waitress was very busy but was attentive.  I've had the sweet corn tamales before and we thought they'd be the same...Before it came resting on corn husks and were really quite good. Now it sits surrounded by a weird sauce that was salty?? Did not care for it, corn tamales don't need a rich over-seasoned sauce...that's what crema is for. It actually over powered the sweet corn. Don't ruin this dish with unnecessary sauce. Less is more sometimes. Change it back! It was much better before and now you guys screwed it up.  The Buffalo blasts were horrible. A favorite of diners who actually like Cheesecake Factory, unbelievable. Ridiculously salty... it was also soggy. the chicken was odd. Like mashed up chicken wrapped up and not fried well. I could only eat one piece and I had to force myself. It would've been better if it was crispy like it's supposed to be. I took it to go since I don't like throwing away food but I gave it to my brother who likes extremely salty food.  The only decent thing I ate was the southern fried chicken slider. It was not over-seasoned and the chicken managed to be crispy. I ate one and took the rest to go since my stomach felt like exploding from all that sodium.  There was also an error on our receipt. Most diners don't bother checking if everything is correct normally. L never checks... so I have to, the nasty Buffalo blasts were charged regular price whereas everything else was happy hour pricing. Human error? A bit sneaky hm... whatever... I'm happy I caught it, the waitress fixed it right away.  Even at Happy Hour pricing the food was not worth the price. Cheesecake Factory is nothing but cheap, mediocre food priced high and over-seasoned to the point that your taste buds must be dead to enjoy.  At least the desserts are still decent but they're not made on the premises... it's not like classically trained chefs are dying to work at Cheesecake Factory, even home cooks have more skill.  Perhaps if your two main ingredients weren't butter and salt, the calorie and salt intake would be much lower and healthier. I guess if I want food that tastes fresh...I'll just cook it myself which I normally do or go to a real restaurant!"
Franciska N.,"Queens, Queens, NY",14,10,2,5.0,12/16/2017,"Ambiance is great, cheesecake is great! Plethora of choices when it comes to cheesecake and they are not shy about the size of the slice either! I had the Red Velvet cheesecake and it was something out of this world!"
Monique B.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,80,230,4.0,8/29/2017,"Went here August 2,2017 with my cousin,we went in as soon as they opened I had a cheeseburger and fries,it was the best burger I ever had and the drink was nice and strong we went to the bartender to ask her when is her hours so we know when the right time to come for drinks,she made them perfect,she let us know,she's not usually there that early,so we lucked out...happy about that,the place is nice and clean and beautiful decor,I would definitely go back,the waitress was alright"
Dionne H.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,111,121,3.0,5/9/2017,It was alright. The menu was overwhelming. The server Kathryn B. Did can awesome of taking care of my elderly mom and I for lunch. my mom originally ordered catfish but there was no catfish and she ended up ordering spaghetti and meatballs. I loved how clean the restaurant was and its design. I really would like to return for happy hour to see it it is worth it.
Enrique D.,"New York, NY",86,269,290,4.0,3/15/2017,Always clean and food tastes good. Long waits during dinner especially towards the weekends. Expect to wait. Service always courteous and professional.  Keith is a waiter that really stands out for me. The level of his service and manner would make you think you were at a high end dining establishment. As it should be.
Varsha J.,"South Richmond Hill, NY",59,22,59,4.0,8/9/2017,The food and drinks here are amazing. Love getting the Chipotle chicken pasta and their margaritas and mojitos. The downside is that their wait time is always 40-50 mins.
Dominique B.,"Queens, NY",88,65,87,5.0,5/1/2017,I've been here a few times since they opened including lunch for my daughter's birthday. Great service and food is exactly the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. Yes it does get crowded but that's expected for a mall restaurant.
Melany L.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",0,14,2,2.0,9/24/2017,Sitting here right now having a hard time. They brought out a strawberry drink which decorating strawberry  was rotten! I didn't realize until I gave it a regrettable bite ewww my bad for not checking I guess ... they brought a beer for my husband without a glass to pouring and drink. No extra napkins until I ask for it. No water ... I asked for it and has been ten minutes and water is still not here.... the appetizer was good but nothing to write home about it.... we won't be coming here. 1 hour later: food was yucky. Service was soooo bad that we tipped 10%. It was the first time my hubby does that. His standard is 18 to 20+ % . So yeah this place sucks .
Diuly T.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",44,22,55,3.0,3/20/2017,"I have always been a big fan of The cheese cake factory and was excited to see one in Queens! This location has a very nice atmosphere, the food was good and the prices are reasonable (for the food). They have a healthy food option menu! which i loved! They list the calories, very helpful! The staff very friendly and sweet, BUT the service was a bit slow, (got a soup and had to wait for the spoon) My biggest complaint here is the price of the cocktails, got 2 Mojitos for $12.50 EACH! I say, very overpriced, and i don't know if the price is listed on the menu, i did not see it, and if it was, it was not very visible...other than that, it was a good experience overall."
Armie M.,"New York, NY",1,12,10,1.0,8/19/2017,"This place is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!! Dont ever eat here if you dont want to be upset, disappointed and get robbed. We waited an hour for our food. Waiter didnt even give us bread. Had to ask for it. He didnt give us water, had to ask for it. And Food was horrible and Customer service sucked BIG TIME!! Dont waste your time eating at this place. Better off eat across the street at Olive Garden or Red Lobster or Apple Bees around the area. If i could only give them NO STAR, that would be a perfect grade for this place. I used to love to go to The Cheesecake factory but this place just ruined that. They definitely need to re-train those waiters/waitresses/managers  again to know how to serve a GOOD customer service."
Naomi T.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",58,138,128,2.0,3/11/2017,"The most enjoyable thing about my experience was my waitress. She was so attentive and sweet! Other than that everything else was subpar. I ordered Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, not spicy at all as I thought it would be, but it was really salty I mixed everything together and still was unable to finish it. We ordered the fried Mac and cheese balls which was good, but also salty and the factory nachos which were not as good this time as the last time I got them. Don't think I will be back here since, I never get cheesecake the calories are insane!"
Hlee Y.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",25,138,338,1.0,3/17/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, I truly do and I won't let this bad experience stop me from going elsewhere. But I will say this is by far one of the worst experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory establishment.  We came to the mall to shop around for my little SIL birthday. We know this place can get busy so we came by to ask for the wait time for a table of 7, the hostess told us about an hour thirty mins to 2 hours!  At first we were hesitant but my little SIL hasn't ate here before so we decided to wait. Knowing it may not be that long. We waited some by shopping around. Came back in 45 mins and our table is ready.  Service is horrible. Let me compare this experience to going to see a doctor. You go in and you have people who come in and out of your room to remind you that the doctor IS coming. In this case it's the manager. The waitress kept coming back and forth to give us our drinks to take our orders but after that we didn't see her for a good 25 mins. She then comes and tells us the kitchen is working on the soup and she didn't forget. Honestly by this time we were full from our two baskets of bread my uncle said we should just leave. I told my little SIL that she should've stuck with just going to hot pot, her initial decision but her sister persuaded her about CF.  We sat at our table for 30 or 35 mins our food comes but the soup doesn't. By now the doctor comes in, the manager. He ask us how the food is, well we just got it so we didn't get a bite yet. He says the soups were cancelled since we told them.we didn't want it anymore after we got the food. We say yes, just to forget about it. He then says ok, enjoy. No apology for the shit service. The long wait on food, on soup on getting our drinks. So it's whatever. We know we won't be coming back here ever. Then the doctor (manager) leaves. So we waited a total of 2.5 hours including waiting time to wait some more inside and see the doctor for 2 mins. Didn't know I was paying with health insurance tonight. On a serious note this is the experience here tonight is exactly the one you would experience at a hospital or doctors office. Either way you lose.  They ended up wanting to give the soups for free to us. We couldn't enjoy it because we had all this big portion sized food in front of us.  The food 1/5 stars. No flavor. They got an order wrong but by this time we didn't even want to say anything anymore. It's ridiculous!!!!  Wished we would have just stuck with hot pot tonight. Easy in and out and worth the money, self serve.  Never again."
Michelle L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,1,4.0,11/19/2017,"It was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory. Friendly staff. We were seated right away. Service was quick. Only bad thing was my boyfriend ordered a coke, and he got a sprite instead. :( I love the food. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip and fried mac & cheese as appetizers. Our tummies got filled up pretty quick from that. Our entrees were fettuccini alfredo with chicken lunch special and truffle-honey chicken. Loved my pasta. We couldn't finish the rest of the food- having two appetizers is very filling. We took the rest to go. I ordered a vanilla bean cheesecake to go with whipped cream. So good. Will come here again."
A T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,5,10,4.0,9/24/2017,We had a good experience dining here. We came around 2:30pm and it was still pretty crowded but we got seated after 5 mins. The host was nice so as the servers. Nice ambiance too.  The food was nice and tasty. The full portion is really big. Will come back here again.
Grace A.,"New York, NY",106,33,74,4.0,4/1/2017,"Although the service was lacking due to being seated in the back area, the food was pretty good and filling.  Got seated quickly, our food came out within a moderate amount of time, and the prices weren't as bad as anticipated."
