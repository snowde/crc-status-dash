Aditi S.,"Manhattan, NY",115,3,,3.0,9/9/2017,"Inefficient seating system, especially if you arrive around 6:30pm. No way to make reservations over the phone or online, so you could be waiting for 50+ minutes. Decent food, nothing particularly special. Large portions but feels overpriced for the quality."
Chanel M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,3.0,11/29/2017,"Visited the cheesecake factory with my mom and daughter last sunday afternoon,i will say  the ambiance was nice. The wait wasn't too long to be seated so thats a plus. I was in the mood for pasta and shrimp, It's important to know exactly what you want or in the mood for because  they have a large menu. I settled on the shrimp and sausage pasta, it was very flavorful but the portion was small. There wasn't enough sausage if you ask me. The mojito was ok. My daughter's  pizza seems fine as she didn't complain. Our waiter was ok, refilled drinks without being asked, checked on us once maybe twice. Overall it was good."
Rocio L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",33,1,,3.0,11/18/2017,"Came here to eat lunch to celebrate my Mother-in-law's birthday. We were seated immediately and we placed our order almost right away. It took a while for everything to come but the waitress completely forgot to place my order which was the pasta with sausage and shrimp and lied about it saying that the pasta was taking a while to make. By the time my food came everyone was just about done with their food. The pasta was kinda tough, the shrimp was undercooked and there was mostly sauce. The upside to this was that everyone else really seemed to enjoy their food. So at least her birthday lunch wasn't ruined."
George C.,"New York, NY",0,7763,14308,3.0,1/21/2017,"There are a few entrances, none clearly marked but it seems just one leads to a host stand (fortunately we got there right when they opened and were seated immediately). Our server was excellent, the entry process and payment process (we had 4 eSlices of Joy and $50 in giftcards and got as many receipts) were quite inefficient, and the food was highly caloric (we got an entree each and were full enough) and not as satisfying as you'd hope, but the cheesecake made for decadent finales."
Shama M.,"Queens, NY",251,100,386,5.0,12/27/2016,"My friend took me out to eat here for my 23rd birthday, and it was amazing!  The food is great and comes in large portions and it is all decently priced! You have so many options to choose from, all which vary greatly from one another. Definitely recommend you get the fried mac and cheese balls! I'm dying to go back just to get my hands on some more!!  The servers are amazing and the service is on point. We got our appetizers and drinks 15 minutes after ordering them and our entrees 20 minutes after ordering, which is great considering the place was overly packed due to the holidays. I understand the wait to actually get seated is horrible, but its easy to kill time since this location is in a mall. Definitely recommend everyone to come here!"
Elizabeth T.,"Whitestone, NY",212,86,169,1.0,1/21/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but the service here was just terrible, not to mention there a 50 minute wait at 8 PM on a Monday night.  After waiting almost an hour to be seated, we then had to wait 20 minutes after we had ordered our entrees before we even got water and even longer before we got plates and utensils.  Then, we got our entrees, they had forgotten to make one of the dishes so we had to wait another 15 minutes for that.  The food itself was good, minus the missing entree and the cheesecake was delicious! I love the red velvet cheesecake and Chris's outrageous cheesecake!  After this poor service I do not know if I will be returning again anytime soon."
J Y.,"Queens, NY",0,1,1,1.0,11/15/2017,"Found something in my food. I ordered a fried macaroni ball with some spaghetti sauce or something. Ended up chewing a lot more then necessary until I realized I'm not chewing on food. (Look at the pic) I told the waitress, she was the bomb btw. She called the manager and the manager said do you want to to get you another appetizer? So I said no. And then she just walked away. She didn't even apologize, she didn't even make us want to stay or come back. She had red or burgundy hair and she was white. Maybe if we were white she would of paid for attention to us. I am not the one to post reviews talking doo doo but I had to because she was such a inconsiderate unprofessional ""manager""? The waitress that took care of us deserves to be manager more then her to be honest. From this experience I will NEVER come back. Hope this help some of you readers."
Saksham D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",88,13,,4.0,12/1/2017,"I had heard a lot about Cheesecake Factory. When I finally went in, the staff was very nice and polite. The decorations are also beautiful for family time or a date. I loved my favorite appetizer spinach dip but I wasn't the fan of the pasta I had ordered for meal. Perhaps next time I go in, I will try the steak. I have heard good things about it. Give it a try, deserts are great as well!"
Mel A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,21,1,1.0,12/27/2017,The hostesses are terrible and uncoordinated. There is a female manager who knows nothing about the place and shouldn't be working there. They messed up our appetizer and the manager came over after 45 minutes to tell us it will be another 5 min. They came and the chips were hard and not chewable the bread was stiff as if it had been sitting out waiting for the Burnt nachos to be ready. Then one entree came and it wasn't what we asked for (mind you what we originally wanted they were out of) I understand it's a busy mall restaurant by we've been to the one in Westbury a hundred times and it's 100X better. 2 hours wasted in this place.
Edward C.,"Forest Hills, NY",2,19,35,1.0,11/12/2017,Long Long Wait. I ordered the factory Burger. Food was terrible. I would not eat there again.
Anthi L.,"Queens, New York, NY",0,2,,2.0,12/22/2017,"So this is my second time here....the only thing I remember from the first time is that service took too too long.  This time: hostess saw me and just ignored me for at least 10', she was on the phone (which is ok), but at least acknowledge the people who are waiting.  When I sat down: it took another 15' for the server to come to me, I ordered a glass of wine and I asked what side salmon comes with. The server didn't know, but I thought he might be new so I gave him the Chance to ask his coworkers. He never came back. I asked another server if I can finally place my order, she said ok but she never came back. My server finally came to my table and he said salmon comes with mash potatoes and green beans, I said ok. My wine came and the glass was dirty. I didn't say anything, I drunk from a different side. Keep in mind that I work in the business and I know how some things work....yet there are some things that I cannot tolerate. My salmon came (with asparagus, Not green beans), the silverware were disgusting, like they were never washed!!! I asked for new ones, they gave it to me. Food was good. The server asked if I needed some water, I said yes, but he never brought it. I asked for the check, paid it and left. I think the whole experience was ridiculous"
Whitney F.,"New York, NY",4,19,18,4.0,4/12/2017,"Came in around 2 pm, on a Sunday, with a group of 4people. The wait was not too overwhelming--40 mins. We walked around the mall for about 20 mins before our buzzer let us know the table was ready. The servers were nice and attentive. The food was hot and delicious but took forever to come to the table. I ordered the steak medallions from the skinnylicious menu, the only way you knew that if was in fact ""healthy"" was the portion, which was smaller than typical Cheesecake portions, the taste was not lacking! I would come back!"
Ying W.,"Corona, NY",10,2,18,5.0,8/26/2017,"It's a real good restaurant in ELM.For the environment,service all of them are pretty nice.Recommend the chicken mango avocado salad .But the air conditioner was too cold!LOL ..."
Chica O.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",122,364,14,4.0,12/30/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory so I was happy one was coming to Queens.  This location is smaller than the LI location. Located inside of Queens Center Mall, on the lower level. You can access the restaurant via the mall or the street. I came here two days before Christmas and the mall was packed so I figured so would the Cheesecake Factory.  The wait time for a table was 30 minutes which wasn't bad considering it was a table for 3. The staff were nice & courtesy. Our waiter Henry was very nice, funny, and fast. Upon sitting down at the table Henry, approached us, introducing himself and offering meal & drink recommendations. I went with the big grande burrito & boy was it huge and a typhoon mix drink. My mom had bang bang shrimp dish with coconut and my aunt had Chicken & Shrimp gumbo. I have to say all 3 dishes were great. The burrito was huge & could feed at least three people. The gumbo was very favorable and the bang bang shrimp had a sweet coconut flavor to it. Of course we took Cheesecake home, I had the Reese'a pieces Cheesecake. Omg it taste good especially since I'm not suppose to have.  On another please do something about the floor. While walking to the bathroom the floor was kinda of slippery. I had to walk my mom to the bathroom because she was afraid she would fall."
Xiao Ling Z.,"Queens, NY",168,168,425,4.0,12/4/2016,"The Cheesecake factory is by far my favorite restaurant chain; they have awesome decor (and this is consistent for all the chains I have visited) and a large selection of different cuisines to choose from (perfect for those indecisive nights). In NYC, the only Cheesecake factory that was available would be the one in Long Island (and that kind of travel was intense for those who did not have access to a car)-- so you can tell that this new one came as a wonderful surprise. If you're questioning the fact that it is in the QCM, worry not because the place is relatively large-- and is a BIG HIT. In fact, for the first 3 weeks (maybe longer?), the wait for dinner was a disgusting 2-3 hour wait (I would know, I tried) on a Friday night. I think the hype has gone down a bit now. For appetizers, I ordered the spinach and cheese dip with nachos. I know, ugh.. why did I do that? It's kind of bland when it comes to pairing with hardly salted nacho chips-- I would not advise unless it's your thing. I would normally order avocado dip with nachos, but I decided that a change would be interesting (it was not). I also ordered a Skinny Mojito (which is ""essentially"" a normal Mojito with less calories?)-- but it tasted REALLY fruity and had hardly any taste of alcohol (I really hope that it wasn't a virgin now...). For the entree, my partner ordered the Filet Mignon for about thirty bucks and I ordered the beef tacos. The Filet Mignon was super flavorful (no need for sauce, salt, or pepper)-- oh my goodness, I don't think I'll be going back to Outback Steak House (sorry... okay, maybe I'll go back for their bread). The beef tacos came as 4 tacos and was super bland (unfortunately)-- the lime juice helped a little bit and the fact that the tacos were very filling made me feel a little better, but the lack of flavor was disappointing and though I do not hate it, I would not go for it again. At the time of my visit, there was a deal going on where if you purchased a $25 giftcard, you would get 2 slices of cheesecake (redeemable in January). My partner and I purchased one giftcard each and we were able to apply it to our meal. We will be coming back for those free slices of cheesecake next year (get it? because it's December now). **A few weeks earlier, we purchased a cheesecake for a relative's birthday, it was MM MM GOOD :) Though my choice of food was not the best, I'm going to come back and try everything else."
Paula M.,"Bronx, NY",195,310,172,2.0,12/6/2016,"Lordy!!! I made the mistake of thinking that coming here on a Saturday night was a good idea. It was ridiculously crowded, so many people everywhere, blocking doors, angry, so much disorganization, just complete chaos. I didn't bother staying for dinner, the wait was about 2hrs or more. I decided to just get cheesecake and go, well even that took 11mins. There a guy who had placed a to-go order and had been waiting an 1 1/2. lol they need to get it together."
Darcy L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,4.0,11/23/2017,"Dined at the Cheesecake in Queens tonight and was overall impressed with our evening.  Even tho it was Thanksgiving Eve and the place was packed, we were greeted with friendly faces and an accurate wait time. Our server Christy was very helpful guiding us with the overwhelming large menu. I had mentioned I was trying to eat Gluten Free as much as possible in the beginning of our dining experience (not intolerant just trying a new diet). The grilled salmon recommended by her was to die for. At the end I was impressed with her memory and presenting both the Gluten free Godiva and Coffee and Cream cheesecakes as options for me on my new diet so I didnt feel so left out next to my husband's Keylime!! My husband enjoyed the Habachi steak, recommended as her favorite dish on the menu, and he said that may have been the best meal of his life! I will definitly be back to try some more of their rather large selection of gluten free items!"
Keja J.,"Elmhurst, NY",151,102,186,3.0,7/28/2017,"Being from  the South (ATL) I am use to having the Cheesecake Factory, and I have never been disappointed. But going to this one for the first time since it has been in my neighborhood I was a lil disappointed. More so with the service than the food.  Our server just seemed as so she was a bit overwhelmed. She had a few tables, but nothing that should be out of the ordinary. It seemed as though every time I would ask her for something, you could see it may be a struggle for her to remember. With that being said, she got my appetizer wrong, and although (after I had already started to eat it), I told her and she offered to replace it but I said no b/c the one she gave me was like my second choice..It was the shrimp spring rolls(which were not great don't  get them), and I did the want to have to wait another 20 mins to get another app when my main course was about to come out.  so needless to say I didn't finish them. There were  a few other things she forgot as well or that we had to remind her of and so I felt that she just was overwhelmed.  Then she had to go to break and another waiter was serving us and he was way better than her. I felt bad b/c when she came back I wanted to ask to keep him instead. When the bill came I felt as though she should have taken off the app all together b/c it was her mistake even though I ate partial of it and she offered to replace it.. I just felt it should have been removed all together.  All in all it was ok but not the best first impression. I may go back and I may not. It will depend on my mood and appetite.. Lol I didn't get cheesecake, so maybe I'll go back for that one day."
Aey R.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,1,,2.0,8/4/2017,"No wonder why it looks like they lost a lot of customers even Friday night. It used to be really crowded before. Everything is clear after I went there this evening. My friends and I (only 3 of us) ordered beverage ;2 glasses of water and 1 regular lemonade and appetizer first. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. I thought I didn't order anything complicated. The food was alright but it used to be better. I knew it was busy for a server who was in charge of a lot of table but at least he should check if we needed anything once in a while. We had to ask for refill even though he walked pass our table so many times (maybe it was too dark). However, they really pissed me off after they served us a dessert which I shared with my friends. Being a server needs to have common sense as well. When you put the plate on the table and saw there was no fork or spoon...how could customers eat it? Thus, I had to ask other server for spoons. He had gone forever and never came back with the spoons. After waiting for a few minutes, I asked another guy. He looked for them at the drawer near the register....unfortunately, it seemed like they ran out so instead of figuring out what to do, he just stood there without doing anything and walked away. Seriously!!! Until our real server came, I asked him for spoons, he looked for them at the same drawer just different level,he found 2 which was alright because only 2 of us shared it.  I was very disappointed how they gave us the service, standard of the taste. Maybe the managers need to rethink how to manage their responsibilities which seemed to be too much for them to handle and didn't look happy enough to work by heart. I know it's busy but service mind is also important."
Anita K.,"New York, NY",152,62,60,3.0,2/6/2017,"We waited about an 40 min to be seated, which is normal for any Cheesecake Factory especially on a Friday night. I got the bistro shrimp pasta and my friend got the eggplant Parm. Portions are HUGE as usual and filling. Food came about 15 minutes after we ordered which isn't bad, considering how busy they usually are. Will be back!"
