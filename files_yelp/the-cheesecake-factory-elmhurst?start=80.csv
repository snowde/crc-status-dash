Jane C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,12,6,2.0,7/15/2017,"Service was terrible... took about 30 minutes to get our food and when we requested that our dessert be delivered after, our waiter never appeared again! We had to hunt around the whole restaurant for someone to bring us our cheesecake! The same thing happened with getting our check.. Food was really good though. I got the fettuccini alfredo, which was delicious and for dessert, I got the hazelnut Nutella cheesecake."
Mike M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,13,,4.0,11/10/2017,"the lines are usually very long but i'm more of a fan sitting at the bar. The bartenders are awesome (especially my homeboys Adrian and Gerald). I love the french fries and the wings. Awesome ""melt in your mouth"" desserts (especially my favorite one, Linda's fudge cake).  nonetheless, friendly service whatsoever"
Rohini R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",45,7,,4.0,12/9/2017,"the only complaint i have about this place is that the music is way to loud!! it's hard to have a conversation, it's a restaurant. not a lounge. the wait time is long but the food is good, i had the thai chicken, and it was so flavorful, delicious, and the pineapple mojito is tasty."
S S.,"Queens, NY",0,88,24,1.0,10/29/2017,Food is nasty. Beware. Had the fish @ chips--which was gross. Fish tasted stale & fried in old oil. Small portion of fries as well.  My friend had the angel hair pasta with shrimp. Shrimp looked like frozen shrimp and pasta tasted like frozen pasta that had been de-thawed.
Fathema B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,14,12,5.0,8/23/2017,Went for my birthday dinner and loved it! It gets crowded so you might have to wait a bit to get seated. They don't do reservations but it's well worth the wait! The menu is extensive and an endless list of choices! Amazing food and service! Loved it.
Nicholas B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,16,,1.0,12/21/2017,I took my wife here for lunch. Good food but i had to use the restroom and it ruined my lunch. The restroom looked disgusting and I asked for the manager and I took her to the restroom I very sick all day. Went back to restaurant twenty minutes later and spoke to the manager and asked her about the floor it was very greecy and the manager told me I will take care of it
Henry L.,"Queens, NY",0,63,,3.0,6/25/2017,"I live in the area, & was very excited to have TCF open their 1st Queens restaurant close by. I've been a couple of times, but the experience was not the same as when i first went to TCF. I remember huge portions, & ordering cheesecake, b/c, well, you were @ TCF. Now, i notice that it's the plate that is huge, & not so much the portions; &, the cheesecake, both times was very small. I had seen another customer w/ a bigger slice, & wondered.  I'm still glad it's in the area, but haven't made another trip back."
Patthara C.,"New York, NY",79,225,347,3.0,10/29/2016,"3.5 What a great addition to the area! Once I found out that Cheesecake Factory was opening, I knew I had to find out what the hype was about. Once we got here earlier this morning, there was already a long line outside.  As we walked to our seats, I couldn't stop but noticed how massive the establishment is; I'm impressed. We get to sit by the window area which was great because it was sunny out and it definitely has a nice vibe (think I actually prefer sitting around here than the main area). Since it was still earlier in the day, I decided to go for OJ ($4.95) and Spinach, Mushroom, Bacon and Cheese Omelette ($13.95). I would have given my first Cheesecake Factory experience 4 stars at least, but the wait though. It even took a while for water and orange juice to be served. I became hangry having to wait over half an hour for breakfast to show up. Our waiter dropped by twice to apologize since it is opening week, but it wasn't his fault.  Once the food came, I was happy again. Breakfast was surprisingly good, but I was also hungry. Can't also help but notice how big the portion was ... well worth the price.  I may come back for the food if I have more time to kill. I'd definitely come back though to get the cheesecake. I'm all for places that are big on sustainability and social impact."
Klone222 B.,"Rosedale, NY",19,58,9,5.0,10/28/2016,"Yum Yum Yum! Even if you are from Mars and dont like cheesecake, You need to come here!  Ambiance: Gorgeous. As we were lead to our seats I noticed the Bars had about Two T.V.s and about 8ish Seats. I did not try any alcohol but I noted that there was a large selection available. The seating can be great if you sit way in the back where it is intimate and private Or it can be kinda close to other parties in the middle where it is a bit louder.  Food: So finally after being seated we received the thickest menu I ever saw. It took me a while to decide between many great options. When the food came it was Oh So Tasty! My Diane Steak/Shrimp Campi Combo was well done and still juicy with some tenderness. My Date had the hibachi steak which was not as tender but just as tasty and delicious. You could taste the wine in the steak. The machpotaotes taste as good as they look in the pictures. The appetizers came out WARM! Loved that. Avocado Rolls and Toast Avocado. Quality Food!  Juniors Vs. The Cheesecake Factory (CHEESECAKE REVIEW): Get the Chocolate Hazel! You won't regret it & I think a portion goes to feeding the needy. I haven't had Juniors in a while so take this with a grain of salt (No Pun intended) but The cheesecakes here I found to be fresher and more tasty. I had the Fresh Strawberry & Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch & Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake  And they all were very smooth in taste and the perfect softness to the crust. I'm not a big cheesecake fan, I prefer ice cream cake but these cheesecakes were really good and not over the top. TRY IT! Customer Service: By far Daphnie and the others who also came to our table gave great customer service skills! She was very clear and thorough. We came on a Thursday night around busy after work hours 7 pm and waited 1 hour and 12 mins but I expected the long wait given they just opened this week. Its better to come here for brunch or lunch if you cant wait. Also I was told that they do not take RSVP yet. The staff here works as a team (Which I loved) So many people will check up on you. It was attentive without being too attentive or disturbing. My utmost compliments to Daphnie and The Manger (a chubby bald guy in a blue shirt). This team screams great communication skills. My water was always filled, & the appetizers came out at a decent time, followed by the food. The soft drinks did take a lil long. Cleanliness: Please note They did not have their letter grade up, which is important to me but the place was pretty much clean. My utensils were spotless (Not even the ugly water stain), My waiter put my knife ""sitting"" on the table (I loved that). My glass seemed clean and none of the waiters or waitresses or busboys walked around with dirty towels or stained shirts. Everything was neat and clean. BUT I WANT MY LETTER GRADE POSTED b/c It would help to know that the kitchen is clean. PS! They are one of those very few restaurants who still pack the food for you when it's time to go! I must have shed a tear or two for this when I realized I didnt have to do it myself. #FirstWorldProblems T.I.Ps: (1) There is NO COAT CHECK (2) At this time, You can not RSVP. First come first serve. Dont take the the little Buzzer past JCPenny (3) There is NO Separate PARKING. (Park in the Mall Parking Lot as this factory is part of the mall) (4) Dress Code: I saw a lot of couples the wait for two is crazy and they dress up/ very few families, and lots of groups of friends who dressed casually. Skinny leg jeans and cute shoes and cute sweater will do. Cute Chic/Not too dressy (5) Most Entrees are between 15$ and 22$. Some Small slice Cakes were 6-8$ Enjoy!"
Becklynn Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",229,101,231,4.0,10/25/2016,"Very impressed with the service here. Came here on their grand opening day and there were A LOTTTT of people. We came during off peak hours and still waited around 20min  Me and my friend really looked forward to this and it certainly didn't disappoint. We came with the mind to order the pasta and cheesecake, however the pasta was way DAMN filling(but delish) and we couldn't fit the cheesecake. (Thanks for that, CHEESECAKE factory)  I ordered the four cheese pasta, it was unexpectedly good because hearing 4 cheese it might be too cheesy, but it's actually not. It's blended with marinara sauce and isn't too salty.  My fiend ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta and it was actually really good, a bit spicy( for her, for me it tasted so weak spicy haha) but I personally thought it was a bit salty.  Service is definitely 5 stars. VERYYYYY good customer service. I hope they keep it up and that it wasn't just a first day attitude kind of thing.  Will be backkkk (for the cheesecake now actually)"
Ronald C.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,4,1,2.0,11/4/2016,Great service. Food portions is less than other Cheesecake Factories but same price. Food quality was also pretty bad. Ordered Spicy cashew chicken and it was way too sweet almost inedible.  My friend order of Shrimp w/ angel hair pasta. Order was missed but manager handled it very well and paid for his dish. But it came out overdone and soggy... If the service wasn't good this would be a one star review. Probably would not come back. Wait was almost 3 hours but that would hopefully change after the hype dies down.
Chris F.,"Astoria, NY",11,40,63,5.0,10/31/2016,"In a word, tremendous. I was blown away at how awesome everything was. We went to eat there at around 1pm on a Friday and the place was packed to the gills. Make sure you call ahead with reservations because we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for a table.  Everyone was super nice and efficient. As busy as the place was, no one was overwhelmed. So 5 stars for the managers, waitstaff and chefs as well. As for the food? Hot damn. I don't know what else to tell you other than it was out of this fucking world.  For 4 people, we ended up getting the guacamole egg roll and fried mac and cheese ball appetizers. For entrees: --I got the Steak Diane (delicious sauce and perfectly cooked steak) --Country chicken and biscuits (my girl went nuts over this and she's still talking about it). --fish tacos for my friend (they were delicious and not fishy at all) --and a bowl of mac and cheese for our friend's 2 year old son. For desert: The crunchy Nutella cheesecake that we all split (and couldn't even finish). PROS: -great food. Even though it's a big menu, every item on the menu seems fantastic. -great service  -they have health options CONS: - because of how busy it is, that plus the music they were playing through the speaker system, it can be a little loud...and if you have a kid, make sure you break ear phones because the 2 year old at the table kept saying how loud the place was. So just a FYI. - because the place is so new they really want to make a good impression. The problem with this was, we had about (not kidding) 3 people constantly checking in on us. So every few minutes someone else would come up to the table and say ""is everything alright?"" Then 60 seconds later someone else would say ""just checking to make sure everything is alright."" Then a few minutes later someone else would come up to our table and say ""just wanna make sure everything is okay."" Every time we told them we were fine. It was a little annoying so I'm not gonna take away any stars. All in all, it was tremendous. Can't wait to go back."
Desiree W.,"Queens, NY",194,1,,1.0,9/6/2017,"Not one for reviews; but, horrible.  You can blatantly tell that managers and servers are just going through the motions of service, without actually providing any. Food sucked.  Just save your time & money  We all know the food is frozen and prepackaged. Do yourself a favor and go to Food Bazaar up the the street, you have a better chance at home.  Never again."
Zenda D.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",75,52,43,5.0,12/5/2017,I had an amazing experience at the Cheesecake Factory besides the long wait which made sense being a weekend everything went perfect. My boyfriend suggested I get shrimp since he knows I love seafood and because it was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory. I got the shrimp pasta which came as a huge portion I was able to have it for dinner lunch and dinner again the next day lol My boyfriend got the bbq chicken salad which was huge but he enjoyed it as well and finished it that night. But let me tell you about those avocado rolls and the tamarind sauce ! As soon as I tasted the sauce I thought I was back in Trinidad eating a Doubles infused with Asian (eggroll) and avocado. We were so impressed we had to thank the waitress for suggesting it. The waitress was so on point as well I wish I remembered her name she gave us the best service I have ever had and she was very knowledgeable and patient. We will definitely be coming back !
Ravi S.,"Forest Hills, NY",5,127,,1.0,9/17/2017,"By far one of the worst establishments in the Elmhurst area to visit. The wait is not a problem for that is common, but the customer service is atrocious - it appears the dredges of society are employed by this company. I would stay far away from this place unless you are happy with giving your money to someone who treats you like crap."
Umid A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",15,9,1,5.0,8/8/2017,"I only visited this place twice:  a month ago on a regular day when there was almost no one at the cashier's, and the second time a week ago on a day that happened to be a national cheesecake day or something. Maaan, that was the queue I havenot seen since the black Friday.  However, could not leave the place without my tiramisus. They are very nice there.  They offer the cheesecake version and the origianal one. I go for the latter.  I took the cakes away with me,  but the place is quite nice  to stay and eat there. Definitely going back to the place for more tiramisu."
Tashi M.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,40,67,1.0,5/15/2017,Worst location when it comes to customer service. The staff at the entrance are so dismissive. I'm shock. Was happy to see a cheese cake factory in the area but now very disappointed.
Marta D.,"Staten Island, NY",37,102,34,5.0,6/21/2017,Only posting 5 stars because we had an amazing waitress Melissa. She's awesome and makes the experience great. Other than that the food sucks completely but the cheesecake is bomb. I obviously had the low carb strawberry and it really hit the spot.  Will not be back.
Yizbeth L.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,3,1,1.0,9/25/2017,"Worse experience ever they are sooo slow, the food has no flavor at all I being to other cheesecake factory and never had such a bad experice will never go back."
Lissette C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,17,147,4.0,6/4/2017,"After reading most reviews I was starting to get disappointed and worry since I wanted a good time dinner for my mom and our friend but I prayed to God and everything was awesome except for the beginning. First when I entered an employee in the front was not friendly, when I approached her to ask her where do I go to get a table for 3, she seemed busy in a computer and she just responded quickly without any eye contact or smile, ""just go up ahead to the lady"". Up ahead obviously wasn't enough detail since I had to ask another employee passing by where can I register for a table for 3 and he pointed to the direction we should go.  Finally when I was attended they ask for my name and give you a small rectangle device that vibrates and flashes red lights when your table is ready. I was able to wander inside the mall but only through that first floor and up to jcpenny since the connection of that device only reaches that far. They said that I would wait approximately 30 minutes but I just waited about 15 minutes.  The food was great and the virgin Piña Colada had a small different taste than usual but it was still good and the food did not take long to arrive at our table. First our appetizer came quickly which we ordered Fried Calamari and then our entree plates came which my mom and our friend kept saying how great was the new York, well done Steak. The waitress that took care of us was very friendly and attentive to our care and I have no complain of her Overall it was a wonderful experience especially since we sat by the window and could see outside the streets, this area of the restaurant we were placed was a long narrow rectangular shape but it was a cool area too."
