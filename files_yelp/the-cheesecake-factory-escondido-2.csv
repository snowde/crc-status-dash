Mark H.,"San Diego, CA",77,193,70,5.0,12/17/2017,"This place is so inconsistent that I've decided I'm going to do a review (and update my review) after each visit. Yesterday we had Vanessa as our server. She was fun, on top of things, and professional. She was everything you'd want from a server at this restaurant. It's too bad the rest of her colleagues are always so hit and miss.  Still, for this visit, Cheesecake Factory gets a 5. On the next visit, when I review them again, that could rate a one star.  The food, meanwhile, was your standard Cheesecake Factory food. Solid.  How will my next review shake out, though? Stay turned."
Jabber W.,"San Diego, CA",1,31,14,3.0,1/7/2018,"Gets crowded on a Sunday afternoon which is understandable . And the seating is not always the  best, but what else would you expect? Limited vegetarian fare but we know that too.  The bread took some time coming and all the exuberance our server tried to rub on to us did little to mask the dampening the spirit feels towards the end if the holidays and a month of festivities.  The portions are humongous and ordering the lunch-size portions makes a lot of sense. A real food factory with a well worked out algorithm to serve over a hundred items.  We might return, them again we might not."
Chris D.,"San Diego, CA",23,43,1,3.0,1/7/2018,Arrived and was told there would be a 50 minute wait.  We got our pager and drank at the bar.  After an hour and 10 minutes passed we ask the same hostess and she said sorry we are slammed tonight.  We finally were seated after an hour and 20 minutes.   The server took our order and said she would bring bread.  She showed up five minutes later with just the hard white bread.  This is the third time visiting this location where the wheat bread is not made by the kitchen in a suffient manner.   We ordered an appetizer before the meal however it arrived 3 minutes before our dinner arrived.  The manager was nice enough to deliver it and comp it before having to ask for it to be comped. The food is always delicious and plentiful.  If you have 2-3 hours to spend then this place is perfect.
Adrienne D.,"San Diego, CA",62,62,45,3.0,12/23/2017,"LOVE Cheesecake Factory! Everything is awesome, never had a bad meal here. I will say, however... This place is SO DIM! Like, super dark. I walked into the empty restroom and was afraid Bloody Mary would appear in the mirror! Jk. But seriously, it was hard to see in the restaurant and restroom. Another thing that really gets on my nerves is why restaurants won't let you order off happy hour menus if you're not at the bar. Similar chain restaurants like Applebee's has made the exception for me before, but not at the ole Cheesecake Factory! I asked a busser if it was still happy hour and he said yes and brought us a menu. Our waiter, Peter J, told us that information was wrong and wouldn't make an exception after being given a menu and some hope for happy hour *eyeroll* Peter then told us, ""idk if you want to make your way over to the bar...."" and I said, ""yeah, not THAT bad."" Pretty sub par service compared to an Applebee's, Peter, and that's saying a lot. Our waiter also wasn't interested in topping off our water. Which is fine, because I'm not too shy to ask :p I ordered the spaghetti and it was delish! My friend ordered a burger and the fries came out 10 minutes later. Not sure why they didn't just serve everything at once. Surprisingly empty restaurant for dinner the Friday before Christmas. Maybe they were short staffed."
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1032,765,1723,4.0,10/6/2017,"Hey, it's another Cheesecake Factory that's connected to a mall! How original, huh? /smirk Like most, in this winning restaurant franchise, expect waits ranging from 20 mins to over an hour, depending on the the time of day....or day of the week. Your patience is crucial. If you want to avoid long waits, try eating at the bar area. Same service and offerings.  Parking is ample but you'll be competing with folks taking patronage with stores in the mall. What I'm trying to say is, there won't be much unless you park at least 150 yards away. Wearing comfy shoes is crucial.  The food offerings are identical to other restaurants within the chain. Don't expect ""local favorites"" or a menu that reflects the local demographic. The Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya pasta tastes and looks the same here as it does in the Hermosa Beach location in LA, where I tried it the first time....back in 1993.  What I'm trying to say is, consistency can be a good thing. As long as you do something consistently well.  At this location, you can rest assured, it's still done well."
Tiffany Y.,"Temecula, CA",214,67,40,5.0,9/15/2017,"Always pleased when I come here. The service is always good, they're attentive and also patient with kids and big parties. The food is always placed nicely with generous portions. The only down side is that it gets extremely busy and they do not do reservations.  The menu is long with tons to choose from. My only hesitation is that because there's all sorts of entrees, I never know what to choose because I can't tell what their specialities are besides cheesecake. I always end up going with some sort of pasta. If you like fried zucchini, I'd think Cheesecake Factory definitely has the best and it comes with a creamy ranch. That's something I always order without hesitation. If you want to go to a restaurant with someone and you don't know what type of food to get, go here because their menu has something for everyone's taste."
Mandi H.,"San Diego, CA",75,78,56,1.0,11/28/2017,"Few reasons for my one star rating. First off, when we were sat we asked for water and it was never brought to us, nor once I went to the bar to get it myself was I offered a refund. The server was extremely rude to my 8 year old when he was ordering - cutting him off and making sarcastic comments about if she was his mother. The worst part was it took 30 minutes AFTER my entrée was delivered for the other adult to get food.. because she forgot. She didn't credit anything or offer cheesecake for the mishap. The food quality didn't match up to the price, and honestly this location was the worst I had been to.  There's clearly a lack of training, and attention to detail on basic things at this Cheesecake Factory."
Darell R.,"Oceanside, CA",12,45,63,3.0,12/7/2017,"Always have to stop by the Cheesecake Factory on a Esco mall visit. Ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and the ""lunch"" size meatloaf.  I like ordering the meatloaf because the portion size is always well accommodating, I usually have to take some home, for some reason the mashed potatoes and the corn portions were small and the meatloaf was really burnt around the edges. Good thing I ordered the lettuce wraps because I didn't feel like reordering and waiting for the meatloaf to be done.  The bread served prior to the meal was a little on the stale side and not warm at all so it was a bit difficult to spread the cold butter on.  Didn't have anything to drink other than water, which is kind of rare considering they always make my old fashioned just right... Not writing off this location due to the burnt meat loaf, just thought I would mention it for quality control purposes."
Sherry G.,"San Diego, CA",25,9,2,4.0,1/3/2018,Seems to be a problem with staffing .  Place is about 1/3 full and we are waiting ? Also - FREEZING in here . Literally has to be set on 65 degrees . Still waiting on being seated . Ownership needs to take a look at what is going on with staffing and why they are spending so much money cooling this place to an ice box .  @@ Now seated and Vanessa the waitress deserves 5 stars . Food is good like always . Management needs to look at their staffing and temperature . Maybe Vanessa should run the show .@@ so we got our food and it was actually better than expected . So I have gone from a 2 from the beginning waiting for 20 minutes to a 4 due to Vanessa and the food .
Janine K.,"Lisle, IL",310,740,705,4.0,10/26/2017,"I typically do NOT eat at places I have back home when I'm traveling out of town, but it's probably been a good 5 years since I've been to Cheesecake Factory so I gave in...oh, also my friend who lives IN the area suggested it so again, I gave in. The mall itself seemed pretty crowded on a Saturday night around 5:30 but we found parking not too far, and it was nice out so I was totally fine with the walk - we had  a short wait, of maybe 20 minutes or so, it went pretty quick.  It's nice to see this restaurant notes the calories now, and has a nice selection of small plates like the flatbread I ordered because when you come here you MUST get cheesecake too!  So....nice changes for sure since I was last here. I wish I remembered our server's name but he was awesome and deserved some kudos!  I had a good experience here for sure overall."
Angelica C.,"San Diego, CA",21,55,212,2.0,7/15/2017,"Been here numerous times and the food is a hit or miss. Two separate occasions I tried the Chicken Bellagio and the Crusted Chicken Romano, both pastas tasted as if I was eating pure salt.  Two weeks ago I decided to come back and try out their Pasta Carbonara and the dish came out perfect. Pasta wasn't overly salty and the sauce was nice and creamy. My boyfriend and I stopped by for dinner last night and since I had a great experience ordering the Pasta Carbonara on my last visit, I decided to play it save and order it again.  However, the dish came out and I was super disappointed. The sauce had a liquid texture and was not creamy at all and majority of the bacon pieces were burnt. I've never encountered this problem at the Fashion Valley location, but going there isn't really an option since we live in Escondido. Although I've had bad experiences with their food, the customer service is still on point."
Angie J.,"San Diego, CA",1487,64,100,5.0,12/12/2017,I just moved up to Oceanside so I am glad there's a cheesecake factory now close to my apartment. I love going to cheesecake because the food is always good and this location did a stellar job of fast and friendly service. The service was great and the food was good I would most DEF come back. For dessert we had the anniversary cake the chocolate one and it was dynamite. The location to is right off the freeway so it's super easy to get to and also it's inside the mall so you can do your shopping before after. I came here with my mom and my newborn baby and they accommodated us well only thing I couldn't find the changing station it might've been in the handicap bathroom but it was occupied for a long time so I had to change my daughter outside on the bench.
Maritess C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",651,1121,4657,3.0,5/19/2017,"I came here to have dinner. We decided to eat here since we were at the mall. I ordered a tropical iced tea to drink. I ordered the Thai coconut lime chicken dish with steamed rice. It also came with shiitake mushrooms and snow peas. The sauce was flavorful even though my taste buds couldn't taste anything since I'm sick with a cold but the taste was there. The waitress checked up on us a few times and refilled my drink. I enjoyed my meal. For dessert, I got an Oreo cheesecake to try. My daughter chose this dessert to share. This dessert was delicious and sweet.  My friend ordered a napoletana pasta and as he dug in it, he found a piece of plastic in his dish. Gross! I told the server and also talked to the manager. Unacceptable! People make mistakes but no excuses. This is the food industry. Manager apologized and didn't charge me for the meal and the meal my friend got which was the ribeye with mashed potatoes and green beans. My bill came out to less than I expected. I still give them 3 stars because my meal was good and overall had a good experience. I may or may not come back. The service here was excellent and I appreciate the apologies. I just hope it doesn't happen again."
Karen L.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",55,87,8,4.0,1/1/2018,The food here is generally very good.  The only negative thing for me is the length of time between serving my dinner and my guest's dinner.  It could have been almost 10 minutes - he was almost half way through by the time my burger arrived - and then it was missing the fries as well.  Needs to be better timed on delivery.
Yuleni D.,"San Diego, CA",25,92,92,1.0,9/30/2017,"Got the Renees special, sandwich,soup,and Cesar salad. The sandwich was ok, the soup was cold, the salad was not good (very sour and strange taste). I got the pumpkin cheesecake slice,which was very ok. It needed more cream cheese for sure and for $8 might as well have bought the pumpkin cheesecake from Costco for $10 and it's very tasty! BTW there were flies all over us inside the dining room and the floor was disgusting with black stains everywhere. Overall for my first time here, it's VERY DISAPPOINTING and I do not recommend."
Marina L.,"Menifee, CA",12,111,,2.0,1/2/2018,For The Love of God can't any venue provide a bar area that doesn't allow children; babies & toddlers. Can't even count on this area for a semblance of quietness.
Yadi E.,"San Marcos, CA",361,186,340,5.0,8/19/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory always does me so so good. I ditched the usual salad and burger comfort zone and ordered artichoke, nachos and a strawberry daiquiri. Artichokes were pretty good, the garlic dip it came with was the tastiest part. My eyes almost popped out of my head when the table-sized nachos came out! And the strawberry daiquiri was more sugar than alcohol so I was in love with that too. Sat at the bar and the waitress was darling!"
Diana A.,"San Diego, CA",361,550,2648,4.0,5/4/2017,"This is my kids favorite restaurant at the moment so we are here often. However the drive from carmel valley/ Del Mar is annoying it's better than going to the overcrowded fashion valley location. We need a Cheesecake factory in north county coastal!! Our favorite dishes here are the grilled artichoke appetizers however it is current out of season :/ For our main we love the chicken piccata pasta dish which I always share with my kid. I recommend sharing this dish or you will be greatly over your average calorie intake! We don't always get cheesecake but if we do we always ask to eat half at the table and to have the other half to go! My favorite flavors are lemon, raspberry white chocolate and pumpkin!"
Stephanie Z.,"Escondido, CA",116,248,377,4.0,8/19/2017,"The cheesecake factory has a huge menu. You can get a variety of different types of food here.  Pretty much can satisfy everyone in the family's cravings all at once... well maybe! There's even a ""skinny"" menu. The restaurant is a very nice fine dining feel. They box your food for you in to go boxes if you didn't finish. However I was a little disappointed today when I went to go eat my mashed potatoes I saved and the server I guess decided on his own I didn't need mashed potatoes and didn't give them to me! (Sad face!!!). Next time I'll have to box myself. Those mashed potatoes are obviously really amazing btw. (Mashed potatoes are serious business and will affect the star rating... it's just how it has to be! Lol).  ...I also had the turkey club and some Spanich artichoke dip that was pretty awesome."
Jennifer S.,"San Diego, CA",376,493,899,3.0,8/7/2017,"I came in for lunch on a weekday.  The lights are low even during the day which I thought was a wee bit odd.  Service was ok.  I had the Renee lunch special: Chicken almond salad sandwich, a cup of clam chowder and a salad.  It looked amazing unfortunately, the sandwich was bland.  I really wanted to like it but I found myself looking for the salt and pepper.  Maybe I should have gone for the turkey sandwich.  Or a pasta.  Or anything besides this.  On another note, I took their tuxedo cheesecake to go and that was magnificent."
Ld S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,31,,1.0,11/10/2017,"It's not worth the wait. You check in and they say 50 minutes for a table. An hour and 20 minutes later... still waiting.   The ""50 minute"" wait for a table ended up being 80 minutes. Finally sat down & they said they'd bring bread. 10 minutes later she dropped off bread & kept walking (no plates). We ordered & waited at least 30 minutes for our food. It was ... okay, but my daughter's burger was served with no condiments (usually they give you lettuce, tomato on the side), but nothing. I had Shrimp on top of cold fries. The waitress didn't show her face again until we were done. So - long wait, inattentive wait staff, mediocre food. I won't be back."
Michele M.,"San Diego, CA",137,343,2948,3.0,1/21/2017,"Cheesecake Factory... I love to come here because it's conveniently located at the mall and they have such an extensive menu.  The problem is some dishes are good and some are really bad.  I've also ordered the same items at different times and they do not always come out tasting the same. Yesterday I had the Chicken Salad sandwich in the Renee's Special.  The Chicken had some gristle in it and was on the tough side.  I only ate half of it because it was unappetizing.  Maybe the problem is quality control.  Whoever is making the chicken salad should be checking the chicken for bones, gristle, fat, etc. before they mix it up.   I've had the same issue with the Chicken in the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  And I really like those, when the chicken is good.    They do serve delicious bread and cheesecake.  My favorite is the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cheesecake.   Service is hit or miss depending on who your server is.  I will be back but hopefully they will work on their quality control.  No one likes to have to spit something out at the table."
Christine L.,"San Diego, CA",4,31,3,1.0,12/22/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is a mess. Ordered 2 cheesecakes and 3 dressings to go. Waited 30 minutes until I finally asked about my order and the pies were sitting on their back counter for at least 20 minutes as I saw when they placed there but didn't know it was my order. When they finally bagged it up, the order was missing the side of topping that the hostess suggested. Great. Then, I waited another 30 minutes for the dressing, which I was told they were getting, only to have someone come out and tell me they were all out--after I already paid and waited so long. Really?! To top it off, during my entire wait, no one acknowledged me or even bothered to thank me for my patience. Not even an offer of water while I waited. Total waste of my time. Won't be coming back."
Mariah U.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,16,8,5.0,12/2/2017,This was a great experience at a Cheesecake Factory. I have been many times and love the dessert and entree selection. We got seated within 10 minutes on a busy Friday night. Great service from Bryce he attended to our table above and beyond. Food never disappoints me!
Cerena P.,"San Marcos, CA",339,188,1966,4.0,1/2/2017,"Very nice restaurant! It's nice to be able to take a break from shopping and enjoy some great service and delicious food. This place has a HUGE menu, everything you can ever think of from sandwiches, pasta, Mexican, steak and more. So many great options to choose from its always so hard to decide!  The avocado eggs rolls have great flavor, the only downside is I wish they were more crispy! I also didn't care for the veggie melt, but the portion was huge! (See pics) they gave me an entire sandwich and half of another. Definitely not skimping out on portions here. I really also enjoy there salads and the dinner entrees. This place is perfect for anyone, since the menu has such a huge variety. It's impossible to not find something to order. The cocktails are fabulous and the garnishes are wonderful. Not to mention the cheesecake, best cheesecake around? Without a doubt!  Service is always fantastic and always super nice and friendly. The only downside is I'd say it's a tad bit pricy. My boyfriend and I had a quick lunch here and our bill was $80. Overall this restaurant is a really nice and I'll definitely continue to be a regular customer here."
Christine C.,"San Diego, CA",201,19,80,2.0,10/14/2017,"I came here to celebrate my 18th birthday dinner with my family. We like coming to The Cheesecake Factory for special occasions so we were very excited to come. Upon arrival, the lady who greeted us at the front desk was very kind and our wait time was shorter than expected.  However, the issues began when we got seated. To be quite honest, I was not impressed by the way the waitress treated my parents. I believe her name was Teresa. She was ""nice"" but it seemed very fake, like she was tired of her job. Since we were seated outside, my mother commented, ""I would just like to report that there are ants crawling around on the tables."" Her intention behind the comment was not for the staff to respond immediately, but to inform them to better help them in case they were not aware of this. In a sassy and annoyed tone, Teresa's response was, ""Well, we are sitting outside, so we cannot do anything about that."" and then she turned our back on us and walked back in.  Generally, I'm a pretty easy-going person and it doesn't take much for me be content with customer service, but I did not appreciate our waitress' attitude and tone. I understand that the job of a waiter/waitress is very demanding and they have to deal with annoying customers every single day, but I would appreciate a little more tolerance + grace. This really put a damper on my night.  On the bright side, the Godiva Chocolate Cake is amazing! But it would have been even sweeter had the waitress approached her job with a positive attitude. If it's really too hard to maintain a positive attitude at work, I would suggest finding another occupation."
Brian F.,"Coronado, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/24/2017,Reserved a cheesecake for Christmas eve. Went to pick it up and they said they didn't have my reservation. Didn't do anything for us just said sorry. Very poor customer service. Won't be going back to this location.
Kelsey Y.,"San Diego, CA",23,63,229,5.0,10/17/2017,"Parking is kind of tough since this restaurant is located at a mall.  When you enter employees at the front are quick to put your name and guest list down. Wait time can vary it just depends on the day and time you go but this place is popular!  On this particular visit me and my friends went to celebrate a friends birthday. (This is on a Thursday night at 6 and the wait time was only 10 minutes). We were quickly seated after putting our name down for a table and the waiter was very friendly. He took our orders and while we waited brought water and bread which we pretty much devoured because it's so good! And he also let us know in a timely fashion when our food would be ready so we weren't just left at our table wondering when we would get our food. When it all came out it looked great, although for my plate they forgot to cook angel hair pasta with the meal instead of the original pasta my order came with (I ordered the chicken Parmesan with pasta), so I asked the waiter if they accidentally mixed up my order and the waiter quickly took care of the problem and apologized and got me the correct order. Everything looked and tasted delicious! As I said our waiter was awesome! Unfortunately we forgot to get his name but if I ever get him again I'll edit this post with his name. He was a great help when we had questions, quick to get our food, helpful in getting my order right, and overall a great waiter! :)  Also, since it was our friends birthday we got the free treat that the Cheesecake Factory gives out, along with us all singing the traditional birthday song! Overall this was a great visit and we can't wait to come back! :)"
Barbara S.,"Escondido, CA",26,6,,2.0,9/24/2017,"I will never understand the hype of this restaurant. A generic chain restaurant. Went when I was much younger with my mother and we both hated. Decided to give it another spin with a group of friends. Out of our group of six, only one enjoyed their food. Few items were overcooked. Their cheesecake that they are known for is way too sweet, you'll have a stomach ache within two bites. Their menu is pages and pages of items. No way the kitchen stall could probably know how to cook all these items and have fresh ingredients. For the quality, you get it's extremely pricey. On a positive note, they place was extremely clean. Our server was very attendant and fast in getting our drink."
Jennifer H.,"San Diego, CA",9,134,580,4.0,1/22/2017,"Very pleasurable experience. The service was good. My friend and I were catching up so we forewarned our server that we would be eating and drinking slower than a normal dinner. We were never rushed. He continued to check in on us to make sure we had what we needed but we didn't feel like we had to hurry up and leave.  We shared the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread. So yummy! Perfect size to start your meal for two or big enough to eat by yourself as your dinner. I ordered the Pasta da Vinci. I love this dish as it has three of my favorite things- chicken, mushrooms and caramelized onions. The portion size is large so you can take leftovers home and eat the following day.   To drink, I was disappointed that my usual cocktail was removed from the menu. :( I tried something new and ordered the Georgia peach (blended cocktail) first. It was tasty but could have used a bit more liquor. For my second round, I ordered the blood orange margarita. Maybe I am a lush, but once again, it could have used more tequila.  We finished with the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake.  OMG!  Nutella heaven!  Really good. Cheesecake Factory has the BEST whipped cream I have ever had. I could eat a bowl of that alone.  If you are shopping nearby, this is a great spot. It does get busy the closer you get to 5-6:30 pm time frame. The ambiance is very pretty. It can become a little noisy but if you are lucky to get a booth, then you will be OK."
P B.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,2,1.0,10/9/2017,"Terrible experience with a take-out order. Instead of letting me know while I was placing the order, the person at the check-out counter waited until after I had paid to say that they had ""run-out"" of take-out boxes. A staff member apparently thought dumping my factory nachos into a cardboard pizza box would be perfectly okay. The staff gave absolutely no thought to the fact that a pizza box is cardboard because the bottom of the pizza is not wet and sticky like nachos!!!  As I walked to my car, I noticed that the bottom of the box became completely wet as all the ingredients of the nachos were seeping out of the cardboard. If you don't have the proper materials for a take-out order, why take the order in the first place??? Absolutely ruined the experience of getting premium nachos. I contacted the Guest Services department as soon as I got home. Will update the review if I find out that the Cheesecake Factory cares about the satisfaction of their customers and about the absolutely careless behavior of their staff."
Andrea V.,"Murrieta, CA",0,28,59,4.0,11/9/2017,"I have always loved Cheesecake Factory. The wait can be either really short or long depending on what time you come. The food is great and flavorful. Free bread while you wait, asked for a refill about 3x and they were more than happy to give us more. The portions are a bit small for the price. It is a more pricier restaurant, plates are on average $14-20 each. Great ambiance and service during the time we went"
Leneisha C.,"Vista, CA",0,27,7,3.0,12/14/2017,Took forever for a salmon salad to go! So I was hella salty and at first gave them 1 star....but I was HANGRY!!!! When I got home...tore that salad up!!! It was BOOOOMBBB
Alexis G.,"San Diego, CA",172,54,243,4.0,9/29/2017,"Celebrated my friends birthday here last night. Parking wasn't too bad, however it really is hit or miss considering it's mall parking. As we entered we were greeted right away and put our names down on the waitlist. The wait was only 10minutes for our party (4 people) which wasn't bad at all, but again the wait is also hit or miss depending on the day and the time that you go. Our server greeted us as soon as we sat down and brought us our drinks right away and the fresh complementary bread. We ordered our food shortly after and the server let us know in a timely manner that status of our food order so that we weren't sitting and wondering where our food was. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was amazing!! The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce added the perfect flavor to my pasta dish! My friends were all pleased with their food as well. Since it was my friends birthday, our server was kind enough to give us a free desert and sing happy birthday. My only complaint is that it took forever to get our check and to pay. Other than that though, the service was great and the food was outstanding!! Can't wait for my next visit (:"
Meagan H.,"Vista, CA",126,57,22,4.0,9/28/2017,"I am a frequent Cheesecake Factory goer. I absolutely love the house cab and the bread is amazing!!!!! I order the same thing almost every time, Evelyn's favorite pasta. Omg I love it!!! But honestly everything on the menu is delicious! But I will say Tuesday when I went my pasta dish was different. They didn't put any pesto on it and the ratio of the vegetables were off. Now to any person who just ordered it and had never had it before wouldn't know the difference but I definitely could tell. I told the waitress but she acted as though she could care less. She's like "" do you want a manager?"" Well no I don't but you could at least act like your listening lol. I will continue to always love Cheesecake Factory and Evelyn's favorite pasta, let's just hope they didn't change it!!"
Jeff T.,"San Diego, CA",8,80,285,5.0,4/10/2017,"I'm not sure why the reviews of this Cheesecake Factory (Westview North County Mall) are so harsh. Most of the 1 star reviews are for bad service or long wait times. If it's not your first time here, the possibility of a large crowd and long wait should be no surprise. You can decide whether to wait just by looking at the gathering in the lobby. I think it's only fair to get pissed if the receptionist grossly underestimates the wait time. That hasn't happened to me yet and usually the buzzer they hand out goes off sooner than they say it will. The food and atmosphere are excellent and priced right. The menu is huge and I find it hard to believe there isn't something delicious for everyone. I love mushrooms so the Chicken Madeira and Da Vinci pasta are my go to dishes. That sauce is so good. The Chipotle Chicken Pasta is delicious too for a change of pace.  The kids menu has real food and portions! I hate going to restaurants that shamelessly charge over 5 bucks to microwave a box of kraft mac n cheese. Here, the mac n cheese and Alfredo pasta are made with real cheese. The sauces are rich and plentiful. The dishes are huge enough for an adult. My experiences here have always been consistently positive. Plus, the food at this location is superior to the Fashion Valley location. Sure, there's a waiter here I do not like but that won't stop me from coming to enjoy the food."
Sara B.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,1.0,8/28/2017,"I believe in giving places a second chance and this Cheesecake Factory still sucks.  Waitress' name is Haley K. She was nice but took 10 years to take our order. I wanted the Margherita Pizza, they didn't have to... My husband wanted a glass of Blue Moon, they didn't have it...all on a FRIDAY night. It was my husband's bday and usually they give you a complimentary dessert of some sort.  Not here.  Never again. Again, I can't wait until the place becomes a PF Chang's or anything else."
P F.,"Oceanside, CA",0,20,22,3.0,10/14/2017,Decided to stop in for the first time ever to see what all the hype is about. They were packed but the wait wasn't long. Bar seating is first come first serve.  We ordered drinks and 3 different pasta plates. Drinks took about 10 min and food about 15 min. All pastas were good and but noodles were a little undercooked. The chicken in the pasta was ok not very flavor-able. Also not a good grade of chicken kind of a cheap like chicken cutlet. I couldn't taste the alcohol in my drink at all. It taste like a milkshake. Service was GREAT. And overall everything was good. Cakes are to die for. We ordered a few slices of cake and they were outstanding.
Osama T.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",31,8,3,1.0,10/14/2017,"Called at the parking lot they said no wait for outside seating, came in and noticed the outside is empty but still i have to wait 30 minutes.  Asked for a manager, he is very unprofessional trying to get me to shut up and just accept the fact."
Bonnie G.,"Escondido, CA",977,950,2861,3.0,9/1/2016,"Well, TCF..it's been a while...and I have to say, I remember things differently.  Let me start by saying how wonderful our server was. Richard was pleasant, efficient, and let my friend and I chat and gab without hounding us to order. My friend ordered spring rolls off their skinnylicious menu and I ordered something I haven't had in years- romano crusted chicken with mashed potatoes (I subbed out the pasta for this). It was good..but for some reason, it wasn't as big as I remembered.  When I ordered it, I was thinking I would take some home for lunch the next day, but that didn't happen because I easily finished the whole thing. We also ordered two drinks- white wine for her and a blood orange mojito for myself.  Good combination. I'm not a fan of their cheesecake here so we passed on dessert. The meal was okay- a solid 'okay'.  It's probably the best option in the mall area, so if I was there and hungry, I would probably end up here.  Would I purposely decide to eat here again?  Not sure."
