Brandon B.,"Oceanside, CA",2,21,,1.0,1/14/2017,"Not even one star. All time shittiest service... actually no service... sat there for 20 minutes , no water, no server, was asked to move seats... waited ... still no water no server. Starving the whole time... left. Still hungry.. don't go to a place you leave still hungry.."
Abby G.,"Fullerton, CA",1,20,17,4.0,7/16/2016,"My friends and I went to a birthday dinner on a Friday night, it was naturally packed much like expected but we sat in the bar. Our waiter/bartender David was very friendly quick and attentive good customer service. I tried the Evelyn's favorite pasta- definitely a must try!"
Suzy K.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,1,1.0,1/9/2017,"Second time I have come here and haven't gotten service for the first 50 minutes I was seated. We were given bread upon being seated and immediately ignored, even after stating that we were very hungry and ready to order. I'll make the walk across the parking lot to BJ's next time I'm shopping here."
Tiffany A.,"San Diego, CA",679,384,526,4.0,6/2/2015,"Pros:  Plenty of parking, shorter wait than there other locations, same great food, more immediate outside space to wait and amazing selection of cheesecakes!   Cons: Always busy, so expect a wait of at least a couple minutes.  It's a chain restaurant... but they do what they do best.  Only been to this location once and was happy about it.  I usually dread going to Cheesecake factory due their long waits... maybe now that there are more than 1 in SD, this has help alleviate that.  Came here expecting the same courteous staff that I've come to know from their Fashion Valley location and got exactly that.   Food was good.  Great selection of meals and plenty of choices.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory... don't let the name fool you... they definitely serve more than just Cheesecake!  I had to explain this to my mom... lol."
Gregg M.,"Poway, CA",6,104,20,2.0,4/10/2016,"This would have been my second time coming here. From what I recall, there is a variety of food options and our food was pretty good last time we came. In addition, they have a full bar. We decided to come here with a couple of friends last night and got here around 5:30. We were told that there was a bit of a wait, but that we'd be seated around 6:20 which was acceptable. We went into the mall knowing we'd get a text notifying us a table was ready and we meandered a bit and then hung around Cheesecake Factory waiting for our table. 6:20 came and passed, as did 6:30, and 6:45. Around 7:00 my friend's wife went to the hostess stand to see if there was any estimate as to a wait time and she turned to ask her associate who was a young man looking at the computer/terminal. Upon asking him, he loudly and rudely shot back a remark towards her clearly very frustrated.  I don't recall exactly what he said, but it was loud, unprofessional and very uncalled for of him to talk to the hostess like that. At this point we decided to head elsewhere for dinner and drinks as the wait had just become too long and it was clear based on the gentleman's response that they were a bit overwhelmed."
Hamza G.,"San Diego, CA",112,19,5,4.0,1/24/2017,"This is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory. The food is all the same since it is after all a franchise. What made me give this location four stars is that it is a very elegant location. It's attached the the Westfield North County. The mall itself is one of the best in San Diego. The Cheesecake Factory is really nice. The ambiance is great. The staff is very welcoming and looks out for the customer. I really appreciated how kind everyone was from the hostess to the waitress. The food was once again food from the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge but the quality of food is subpar. While I was there I ordered the rib-eye steak. It was a good quality steak. Not as good a steak that you might get from a steakhouse but a solid steak. If you're at the mall, this is a great place to stop for food with family and friends. The staff is very great. The food is ok. The main reason to come here is the atmosphere and the ambiance of the location. I did have one problem which was the wait time to get a table. It took 45 minutes to be seated which can be a problem if you're very hungry. Other than that this is a good spot to check out."
Ashley H.,"Oceanside, CA",3,10,12,4.0,7/24/2016,DELICIOUS cheesecake! I will be back!  Cheesecake is the only cake I eat! It's my favorite!  Had the extreme oreo cheesecake! Had nachos and those were good. The tropical tea is good. I wasn't a fan of the veggie burger. I'm a vegetarian and had better so I may try something new next time!
Lovalynn L.,"Encinitas, CA",0,1,,3.0,7/31/2017,"Came here to eat for my sisters birthday, which also apparently happens to be cheesecake day, we were greeted by a very rude host named Cynthia and had to wait a prolonged period of time obviously because it was cheesecake day. I was not happy what's so ever and actually almost left because the host was just so unpleasant in her demeanor and the way she spoke to me but as soon as we got seated the server, Kim, really turned the mood around she was so personable and the food and cheese cake were delicious."
Maria C.,"San Diego, CA",1774,2890,8958,4.0,5/26/2014,"We celebrated my parents' 41st wedding anniversary here with the family. We were offered comped bread and butter. The squaw bread (brown bread) is my favorite here. The bread comes out fresh and warm.  I ordered the Strawberry-Cremcicle beverage ($11) - Tasted like a strawberry blended shake! Can barely taste the alcohol but you can smell the vodka.  Lemon Garlic Shrimp ($17) - Portion was small, but it was on their skinni-licious menu. It was just enough for me although more pasta would have been nice! Cajon Chicken Littles ($15) - I had a piece of the bf fried chicken. You can definitely share this amongst several people. Huge portion and you also get a side of potatoes. Fried goodness and carbs is what you get here! Smores Galore Cheesecake ($8) - I enjoyed the smores cheesecake. Had a graham cracker crust, chocolate cheesecake and marshmallow topping. Sweet, but delicious!  Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake ($7.50) - If you like tart, then this is your dessert. I enjoyed this cheesecake as well. Both the lemon and raspberry gave the cheesecake lots of fruity flavors.  Our party of 9 waited about an hour and a half for a table. The service was slow, but the poor lady who served us was really nice and accommodated our requests.  What sucks is that they don't accept reservations and it's all first come, first serve."
J M.,"Escondido, CA",0,50,5,4.0,12/31/2016,Would have given 5 stars but the wait to be seated is horrendous! After being seated the service is great and the two lunch size salads we ordered were huge! And delicious! Not to mention the cheesecake..... Oh my.......
Sarah S.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,7,5.0,2/11/2017,"This is my favorite place to eat! My family and I are here weekly. I've never tried anything and didn't end up loving it! They have a huge variety of food!! And their drinks are even great. The service is phenomenal. The servers are so quick, kind, helpful and always checking up on us. My sibling didn't like their plate and they gave them a complete change in food, the manager came to our table and apologized for the inconvenience AND took that food off our check!!! I came for brunch, also so so delicious! And their deserts and very tasteful! I always highly recommend this restaurant :)"
Dee W.,"Aurora, CO",0,8,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Well we finally found the sorriest excuse for a waitress in all of San Diego County. Her name isTheresa W.  And she works at the cheese cake factory at the Westfield Mall in Escondido. Why she works there is beyond me. She CLEARLY doesn't like her job. She hates her job. She doesn't want to be there but yet there she is. Unhappy, angry at the world and taking all that frustration and depression out on her customers.  She came to our table a total of 3 times our entire meal. I counted the times the people seated next to us had their waitress come to their table...... 11 times !!!  We got a refill of our drinks AT THE END OF OUR MEAL.  She asked if we wanted bread... Sure!!! 22 minutes later.... ""here's your bread"" and DROPS IT on our table and walks away. Ummmmmm where's the butter? Yummy dry bread.  Oh boy!! That's what I want. CHECK PLEASE!!!!  So we are done and we can't wait to get out of there..... tic tic tic 15 minutes later she shows up with the check. 15 minutes to print a check??? MAYBE she was having a bad day. MAYBE she had the flu. MAYBE her BOSS should do some training. MAYBE it's a management issue.  No one wants to be around a grump. People pay good money to have an enjoyable time. And get this..... the check has a suggested gratuity boldly right in the middle. It starts at 15%. We spent 75 minutes there. 30 minutes just waiting for her. A full HALF HOUR. Did we approach the manager about the issue? No... Why you ask ? Because we eat here monthly folks. Every month we watch other patrons complain to this shift manager and he does nothing except ARGUE back with the customers. We have always had normal to great servers but Theresa....... Sorry.... bottom of the barrel in service, attitude, politeness, professionalism and interpersonal communications. Hello Applebee's!"
Brandon F.,"San Diego, CA",785,233,294,5.0,9/29/2014,"Nicole made our dining experience a great one! Excellent customer service experience and the food was really good. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was decent, the bread was toasted a little too much but I still liked it. My girlfriends garlic noodles with shrimp was perfect. My little sister had the kids pasta with butter and parmesan and she enjoyed it. Finished the meal with the red velvet cheesecake, and it was good as always. This is a new location, and you can tell they're still working out a few kinks, but overall we were pleased. They took a while to bring out one of our pastas, but they came out and apologized and offered us a soup or salad. We'll definitely be back and we're happy to have a Cheesecake Factory in the area!"
Yesenia H.,"Encinitas, CA",2,39,16,1.0,12/26/2016,"If I could give zero star's I would. Everytime I decide to give the cheesecake factory in escondido a chance it never fails to fail. I arrived with a party of eight, girl at the desk said she had to get the manager to ""quote it"" 25 minutes later the manager is no where to be found. I asked the gal what's going on with the table? She quoted an hour wait but no table for my party of eight guaranteed! I've never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant. This location is horrible I would rather go to the San Diego location, where the employee's know what they're doing and know how to handle situations accordingly."
Kristine L.,"San Diego, CA",5,2,,1.0,6/16/2017,"What a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. We spent 2 hours waiting. and waiting. and waiting. On our anniversary. I ordered a beer as soon as I arrived (my husband got there first) and literally 15 MINUTES later the server informed me that they were out of my selection. So I immediately ordered food (if this was the pace of the evening I knew to try to get everything in asap). ANOTHER 20 minutes went by and I finally received my 2nd choice beer. NO JOKE - 35 minutes into service. It was another 10 minutes before the manager came by to tell us one of the items we ordered was not available. My husband still didn't have his second beer at this point by the way -- about 3 minutes later his tacos arrived, and our appetizer (fried cauliflower) but no sign of the avocado toast. When the two dishes arrived I ordered my second beer *WHICH NEVER CAME* and was not surprised at this point that the food was cold. The ""hot spicy cauliflower"" was cold. The fish tacos rice/beans also cold. It was another 8 minutes before the avocado toast arrived. WHAT THE FUCK. I didn't even want it at that point but I was so hungry and thirsty I dove in. It was about another 5 minutes when the substitute salmon dish came out. My husband was done with his cold tacos. Our glasses were empty. I promptly asked a busser to get a box (for the cold cauliflower) and shortly after the server told me the keg had blown (which was TOTAL BULLSHIT because I saw two servers with multiple stellas walk away from the service well MOMENTS before she was table side.) 1 hour in and I still hadn't received my second beer. We were so unhappy with our experience we didn't even want to stay for dessert (truly the ONLY reason we chose this restaurant) and what's even more sad, I had to ask the manager to come over to explain our unfortunate situation and his reply was; ""well I took the salmon off I didn't realize how long you waited so hopefully that helps. happy anniversary."" REALLY? While some people dine to hunt for free-bees that's not our style. We were clearly there to relax and enjoy a few drinks. Not to mention it was our anniversary!!! A GENUINE apology would've been GREATLY appreciated. A simple gesture to come back another time for dessert to give them another chance would've possibly changed our perspective. But UNFORTUNATELY, no one was able to suffice the situation. We felt completely disregarded. Guests..? Hardly. And on such a special occasion. I highly suggest looking at other options as there are SEVERAL in the area (outside the mall as well) with far better service and appreciation for clientele. Having been in F&B for 14+ years I've had top notch service at even the chain-iest of places and this was all around unacceptable on so many levels. I specifically told the MOD If I was on the floor I would NEVER EVER allow guests to walk out on the circumstances we did. SO SO UNFORTUNATE."
Joseph H.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,66,46,5.0,12/24/2016,"We ate here after receiving disastrous service at Centre City Cafe up the road. The waitress was friendly, responded to prompts, and we were served delicious food. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is AMAZING, although oily. I also ordered a slice of their cheesecake to go."
Nick P.,"Escondido, CA",0,86,4,4.0,6/23/2016,"Another food establishment attached to the mall. This is your typical Cheesecake Factory restaurant that is just like all the other locations.  I have eaten here on many occasions and have always had great food and great service. This location gets really busy like the other ones, but they do take your name and will text you when your table is ready.  It's nice to be able to go inside the mall while waiting and not have to sit there and wait for your name to be called.  Parking can be a pain because of the mall traffic, but it's never been a huge problem. Give yourself an extra few minutes to park on a weekend and give this place a try. They don't have any bad food."
Ashley W.,"Fallbrook, CA",26,61,1,3.0,4/6/2016,"I came here with my mother who is in a wheelchair. We didn't mind where we sat, as long as it accommodated the wheelchair. So the staff tried to take us to the patio. One door was blocked, the other was through a staff area. The patio was blocked with umbrellas, booths, and although moved by staff it certainly was awkward for those around (especially my mother). Then the booth seating had to be moved because they aren't structured in a way to allow a wheelchair to pull up. Ultimately, I'm happy with the way the staff handled the situation and accommodated us, but I'm kind of bothered that they had to. Also I wanted to leave this review so that the ""decision makers"" would understand this as a problem."
Samuel D.,"San Diego, CA",100,291,1419,3.0,4/28/2015,"My first time at this new location in Escondido. Came here for a late dinner about 9pm on a Friday night. Surprisingly not busy and my party was seated quickly.  Atmosphere: if you've been to a Cheesecake factory. It's basically the same layout and setting. This locations since it was brand new has a new feel kick to it. Food: i usually order the chicken pasta marsala. but my first time trying the bistro shrimp pasta. this would be my next go to dish. it has plenty of small shrimp in each bite and if you're a fan of arugula it certainly blends well in the pasta.  Drinks: i had a house vodka with fresh squeezed lemon. quite a kick and good poor. but price is pretty hefty for house vodka for $10 Service: considering it wasn't so busy. it was so-so Dessert: the s'mores cheesecake was pretty good. not too rich.  Cheesecake has a wide selection of food, good ambiance, a full bar and a couple tv's, but it can get pricey.  FYI: NO reservations accepted"
Kayla S.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",179,73,177,3.0,9/4/2015,Came for the cheesecake!  I'll take the bread!  Opted out of a happy birthday song!  Raspberry cheesecake not so raspberry filled Real sweet!  I'll take the check.
