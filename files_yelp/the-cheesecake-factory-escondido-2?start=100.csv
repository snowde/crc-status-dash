Chelsi C.,"Vista, CA",89,116,90,5.0,6/26/2016,"Got the eggplant special and it was so amazing! My mom used to make fried eggplant so every once in awhile I get a craving for it. The wait staff and hostesses were all polite, and treated my friend and I well. My drink was rarely empty and the food was delicious. Now I have a place to go when I'm craving it! Also can we all take a moment to appreciate places that bring bread at the beginning of the meal? And it's great bread too!! I love that they are at the mall because you can eat something other than food court food to keep you shopping all day! I can't wait to go back!"
Delaney B.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",83,10,3,3.0,11/14/2017,"I usually come to the Cheesecake Factory for special occasions or feel like treating myself. Most the time it's awesome, however my most recent visit was just adequate. The wait wasn't long so that was awesome. Got greeted in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress was super awesome! Gave us lots of refills on drinks and bread, as well as very accommodating. Unfortunately, our burgers took significantly longer to come out (while my other friends were eating). Then our waitress informs us that someone had dropped the fries (which I mean accidents happen), but she did offer us a complimentary side salad in the mean time which was awesome. Lastly, the cheesecake. I am a huge fan of the key lime cheesecake, I get it almost every time. However, the cheesecake hadn't been thawed all the way through, so I could taste some of the frozen-ness more towards the center of my cheesecake. It was ever so slight though that it wasn't worth complaining cause our server had been so great and accommodating, but they just need to be more careful. Not the usual awesomeness I usually experienced but our server tried and that's all I can appreciate."
Shirley K.,"Escondido, CA",0,16,,1.0,11/13/2017,When you request no onions on your pizza and it comes with onions maybe it would be nice to be offered to not pay for waiting for another pizza. No manager came out to apolizize or nothing. Not even a free piece of cheesecake. Won't be back anytime soon.
Krystal G.,"Fallbrook, CA",4,7,12,5.0,8/18/2017,Where do I start?! So many good things to say about this place! Went to lunch here for my birthday with my grandmother and my 1 year old son. As soon as we were seated our server brought over a small plate with cut up banana and bread for my son and a cup of ice cold water. Sooo sweet! She was talking with him and just so friendly and attentive to us! I wish I could remember her name! Service was excellent! Love coming here! Never a bad experience!
Marcus F.,"Escondido, CA",254,1903,3172,4.0,9/16/2015,"I've been ordering healthier menu options since my last review so I thought an update was in order.  Great menu item profile: Vegan Cobb Salad  (Lettuce Topped with Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa Almonds and Sunflower Seeds with House Vinaigrette) The Vegan Cobb was one of the most satisfyingly healthy salads I've had in a long time. It's always about the taste, and every bite had a little something new and exciting to offer. The dressing (Vinaigrette) was the perfect choice to enhance the flavors of this superfood salad.   Another hit was their lettuce wrapped burger. Thick beef burger patty with all the details of a normal burger ( including the grill marks on the onion). If you're going protein style, they have good creations here at Cheesecake Factory."
Mila C.,"San Diego, CA",4,1,,1.0,7/9/2017,"The man at the checkout, was not very friendly. I waited 20 minutes for my order. I was never told ""sorry for being so long"". In the end, gave the cheesecake, without saying a single word. Very rude staff. I will not return to this place anymore and I will not recommend it to my friends"
Carrie S.,"San Diego, CA",1,44,12,5.0,8/6/2017,"Seriously how could anyone not like Cheesecake Factory lol. There are a ton of items to choose from on the menu. Great low fat dinner options, pasta, sandwiches, chicken, steak and a gigantic dessert selection. The service here is always great and the portions are gigantic too."
Thaddeus D.,"Vista, CA",1,6,,3.0,8/26/2017,"I've been here a few times and the food is a hit or miss. The first time, I went with at the time in 2015 with an ex girlfriend now. The filet mignon was amazing that time. Very nice and juicy, but for one thing, dessert is very consistent here. It is simply to die for. I wasn't disappointed the first time. After the last couple times, it was alright and I will return, but the inconsistencies should be worked out and this place would get better reviews. My favorite cheesecake would be the tuxedo cream. I tried the red velvet the first time and it was extremely more sweet than I anticipated."
AJ T.,"Idyllwild, Idyllwild-Pine Cove, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/29/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this by far is the worst location I've been to. The place is filthy, waiters are uncoordinated. Been here twice just because it's the closest one to my house but probably will not go back again."
Gillian P.,"Poway, CA",0,5,,2.0,11/6/2017,"I've frequented this restaurants lots of time, always sitting in the bar, but I'm giving up on it because of NOISY CHILDREN IN THE BAR AREA. If I'm spending $80 or more on a couple of entree, and a couple or three glasses of wine, and it is 8.30 in the evening, I don't see why I have to endure noisy kids on the table behind me.  Not only do you have to put up with their continuous screechy chattering, but the parents with their constant questioning - do you want to use the bathroom, do you want to get down, do you want to get up, would you like another drink - drove us insane.  It as like being in their kitchen at dinner time, instead of an adult restaurant. Why can't they keep kids out of the bar area? The Red Robin, in the same mall, has now done so.  The food is not as good in the Red Robin but at least we will be able to have a meal in a more adult environment as it is now over 21's only! Cheesecake factory take note - not everyone wants to eat in a children's playground."
Moe J.,"Carlsbad, CA",25,11,1,4.0,8/6/2017,"I've been there yesterday, it was all good and the food was not bad, but I waited 15-20 mins extra beside the 20 mins that they normally take to get your food ready all this wasted time just for the employee to pick up your food from the kitchen."
Johnathan H.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Do not recommend ordering through Door Dash! $20 for burger and fries.  Dry burger, cold fries and no condiments.  Offered 99 cents from Door Dash for remedy. Ended up heating frozen dinner and throwing out the awful burger and fries."
Charita A.,"Murrieta, CA",281,421,1206,5.0,7/21/2015,"Its impossible for me to give a Cheesecake Factory a low rating.  It would have to be due to extremely poor service, or I try something new that just taste terrible. They carry one of my favorite dishes ever...the fried mac and cheese balls. Yum! This location can have a long wait just like every other Cheesecake Factory, but who cares. Go walk around the mall to kill time while you wait.  I will say if you come after 7pm on a weekday, you should have a good chance of not having to wait at all.  This location has become my new favorite because it's the closes to me. Haha.  In my recent visit, Heather was our server. She was very friendly and attentive. I finally tried the Lemon Meringue cheesecake. It was pretty good. The lemon part was tangy, the cake part was creamy and the meringue was just like a airy marshmallow. I never really liked meringue, but this one was good. All together, the ingredients make one very sweet cake, so be warned."
Vincent C.,"Oceanside, CA",121,1070,8679,4.0,7/29/2015,"I've only been here for the cheesecake and can't speak on the food. I never really realized that The Cheesecake Factory was here at the mall so when I found out I had to get some cheesecake obviously. This spot is pretty busy or at least when I come here which is usually during the week after 6pm. The restaurant is a nice size with a bar and the lights are low. I know what I like when it comes to cheesecake so I like, macadamia nut, carrot cake, raspberry or any just about anything fruity. The cheesecake menu is very large and it may take you about 10 minutes to decide on what you want. The service I had was really good like it usually is when I come here.  The first time eating cheesecake here I sat in the dining room and the service was wonderful with no complaints. I don't come here for the food but maybe I will have to start because the pics look good. Anyway so I ordered a hot chocolate which was pretty good in a nice size glass. The crazy carrot cake was fantastic because it had whip cream and icing. The next time I come here I will definitely get something to eat and see how it is. If it's good quality like the cheesecakes then we have a winner at the mall when it comes to food and dessert."
Carlos V.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2017,"Keila, didnt has her name tag on her.. but as I understand thats her name... a hostess.. I think its the job manager to supervise the attitude and courtesy to treat customers.. She was very rude and careless when I ask if she can turn down the air condition, to the point that I ask for the manager, who happens that was the guy near, but neither him shows interest to care for the request arguing that he needs to hold the temp in an average, but that he will look at... i think this restaurant lives for the very good job that many waitres and kitchen workers they have, and its sad that this 2 people, keila (Skinny blond and short) and the manager, doesnt understand that they have their jobs because of customers..... restaurants today should excell in the way they treat customers, and many they are that are very good on this, but not this 2 people.."
Lenny R.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,2.0,8/15/2017,"Don't go to the Escondido one on Friday night. Super packed. We were told 10 minutes and waited more like 20. Then the food part. We had a new waitress. They brought us 2 tiny little pieces of bread while we waited for soup, salad, half sandwich and an appetizer. 40 minutes later still nothing. The waitress never stopped by or checked in with us. My husband stood up to look for her, flagged her down and asked how much longer. She came back and said a few more minutes. We decided a few more minutes meant more than that and we had just spent 60  minutes of our lives lost at CF.  2nd time they disappointed. Don't think we will go back again. We will try CPK in the mall next time, or Mac grill. There are several other choices in or around that mall. CF better step it up or they will soon be gone.  We walked out.  Cheesecake to go will be our only visit next time, if any."
Joe W.,"Oceanside, CA",1,8,,2.0,6/10/2017,"Dirty seats, dirty tables and sticky menus. You get smacked in the face with dirty drain stench when hi walk in. However, the food is always good"
Albertine F.,"San Diego, CA",881,225,191,4.0,5/19/2016,"Short and sweet. Delicious mint ice tea, hot crusty bread, and delicious summer rolls and lettuce wraps. This chain is hit or miss, so it's nice when it hits. I'm sad they no longer have the lemon arugula salad though. We just had a quick bite after a safari.  Might update with more if I come back. Service was great except our waiter either thought he was a maitre d at the French Laundry or really is an automaton. He was just a tad creepy in his politeness and efficiency. But overall, good experience."
Rex A.,"San Marcos, CA",3,7,22,5.0,7/30/2017,"Another consistently good food experience with a truly amazing, friendly and conscientious server - thank you Taylor!...and cook staff."
Dragen Z.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/19/2017,"03/18/2017 - One Star rating : 1) Wait time 1 hour 49 min. We waited because we are travelers who rave on quality taste. 2) we were told 1 hr 15 to1 hour 30. Time passed as we see peeps getting called in. We approach the front desk only to find out that our place in line was downsized. When we approached the agent, he's remark was oh that's interesting? We will place to the TOP of the list! This a call for pops I missed your 4 party guest and let others in before realizing that YES they forgot place us on the list. FOOD and TASTE superb, SERVICE on a scale of 1 to 10 probably a 5. In all the years of an adventure to Cheesecake Factory our best has always been the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory busy but still great service. Hope service can be resolved, as their were many peeps waiting for about the same time that we waited because of the food and name brand.."
