Miki B.,"Poway, CA",50,5,,2.0,2/26/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here a few days ago for drinks to end a night out. We went straight to the bar and were immediately greeted. We ordered our drinks and they were brought to us almost immediately. The bartender was nice but as we watched him make drinks we could see him becoming increasingly irritated and angry when his syrups ran out. He threw and empty bottle on the ground, finished the drinks he was making and left the bar area. He seemed to be much calmer when he returned but it was not something that we enjoyed watching. We finished our drinks and went to the front to order cheesecake to go. We stood by the register for a bit before someone finally noticed us and took our order. We left with our cheesecake only to discover once we got home that they had given us the wrong thing. It was still good but it was a bit disappointed that we didn't get what we ordered."
Eric L.,"San Diego, CA",463,466,145,5.0,12/9/2016,"There are a few people in life that truly excel at their job.  The waitress at Cheesecake factory last we went is one of those people.  After greeting us with a standard smile and hello, we were asked if we would like bread.  She foresaw that we would want the brown bread so as we were going to request only the ""honey oa-"" she smiled and nodded knowing exactly what we wanted.  When she came back, she gave us a basket full of the coveted honey oat bread with another one broken up with banana slices!   Why is this important?  She explained to us, ""This is for this cutie"" gesturing at our 1.5 yr old daughter.  She had the foresight that she was young enough to not eat a meal and just brought us bananas.  Why? Because what child doesn't like bananas?  I'm not sure if this was kosher with the manager but she didn't seem to care.   The rest of the service was kind of standard with great service on refills, checking in on us every once in a while, and always smiling and waiving at our kidd-o.  Then the bill came.  She asked if we wanted any to go containers for any of our food... and drinks... What the whaaaaat?!?!  I hope I don't get anyone in trouble for this, but the simple gesture of getting us a $0.05 cup to have one refill of a drink that cost them $0.005 to make and cost me $2.50 has completely solidified this cheese cake factory as my ""I'm going to always eat here when I'm at this mall"" place.  So to the manager, if you're reading this and worried that this small cost of a cup and a banana is costing you, I assure you, in the long run, it is not.   Sadly, I don't remember the waitress's name but I do remember how she treated us and will now have a gold standard to hold all food service people to.   Oh yeah, the food was great too. TL:DR - Typical Cheesecake food with an amazing i mean AH-MAY-ZING server."
Breanna Y.,"San Diego, CA",52,28,11,5.0,12/17/2016,"Came in around 9:30 with my hubby, we love Cheesecake Factory! We actually attempted to eat at this location earlier this year, not such a good experience & we ended up leaving. However, let me tell you! This time around was awesome! We got seated quickly, our waiter Bryce was AMAZING! Very polite, checked up on us several times and was helpful in choosing which cheesecake to try! The food, has been the best I've had thus far! I had my favorite the chicken bellaiago, it was a yummy, creamy pasta and my hubby had the double bacon burger, he never likes what I get but he loved my dish so much he kept asking me for just one more bite!!! We are so happy with the service we received and the food we ate! Oh, & the cheesecake we ordered the 30th anniversary and it was to die for!!"
Sean C.,"San Diego, CA",41,409,256,3.0,4/13/2017,"My first time I'd ever been to the Cheesecake Factory and let me tell ya, it lives up to the Cheesecake name. Unfortunately there were a few other aspects that were lacking. Firstly, when we had sat down, after I was told that while we were waiting our table just needed to be cleaned, I put my arm down on a sticky spot. Not the best but okay, I'll deal with it. I then tried to sit comfortably in the wicker chair and it was actually pretty bad. I was not able to sit up and had to recline way back in order to hit the back of the chair (I'm getting over a neck and back injury so this was particularly not fun throughout the meal). The 2 waiting staff members that helped us were very nice. Once we had our waitress, going through the menu and asking for help was easy, she was very helpful and knowledgeable. I ordered water to drink and the Cajun chicken poppers as my meal. The water was clearly tap and didn't taste great but our waitress did keep the glasses full excellently. My chicken was pretty good and there was a lot, but was not noticeably Cajun as the name implied (it was bland normal tenders). I was very happy the waitress was kind enough to add a side of gravy for the mashed potatoes but was disappointed when it wasn't white country gravy. The succotash was also good and spiced very well. By far the mediocre meal was made all the better when I had gotten the Nutella hazelnut cheesecake. It was delicious. The crisp flaky crust and rich Nutella with chocolate and topped with whipped cream was very good. In the future, and I would recommend, only going here for Cheesecake."
Michelle K.,"San Diego, CA",7,68,6,5.0,6/24/2017,"I absolutely love coming here! My absolute favorite place. Our server was amazing... I misplaced my receipt and couldn't remember her name but I was there on the evening of June 5th. We were one of the few people sitting outside. She was definitely on top of everything, made sure we had our drinks, and checked on us often. Anyways, I wish I knew what her name was to shout her out. But thank you for the amazing service!!! I will be back like I always am."
Meredith M.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/3/2017,"Hello friends! First of all, this is the best Cheesecake Factory location in San Diego. It's always nice and clean, has fast service, and the food is always great! Tonight we were served by Ariel, who was of the best waitresses that I have ever had. She was very friendly and provided very fast, good quality service. Our food was perfect and she checked on us regularly, continuously refilling our waters and answering any questions we had. Overall, she was just so on top of it! Afterwards my boyfriend and I both agreed that she provided some of the best service that we have both ever received!"
Zerring J.,"Eglin AFB, FL",51,52,49,4.0,12/24/2016,"Happy, Elated are two words I would use to describe my family's experience at The Cheesecake Factory even though it was the eve of Christmas Eve the wait wasn't that long and our waitress was superb and the food I ate the shrimp and chicken gumbo with rice my wife had the Shepherds pie she was satisfied with hers as I was with mine I give it a 4 out of 5 only way it could been a five was it to be a bonified Louisiana Gumbo."
Carla H.,"Vista, CA",13,193,37,2.0,10/27/2016,It's really sad that I have to do this because I really love this place but this location is just awful because of the food inconsistency. One day it's great then you go back and order the same thing it's terrible like night and day. I'm not sure what goes on there because I know the recipes are standardize so I'm assuming that staff does not care about food quality and the people that are paying to keep them employed. So I try to avoid this place at all costs. I mean who can't get fried Mac and cheese balls right all you have to do is heat and serve. I get this little burnt balls to the table most of the time. This is a great place to come in and order cheesecake and then leave that's it noting else.
Marisa H.,"Murrieta, CA",19,152,27,5.0,6/4/2017,"We literally went out of our way to get to this place. Its just our absolute favorite. The miso salmon is always to good. We love the bread that is served as an appetizer as well. The kids menu pretty much has something for everyone, and of course the adult menu is soooooo long, i think it would take years to try everything. I wish they had a cheesecake factory in temecula."
Eva L.,"Oceanside, CA",230,180,485,3.0,3/17/2016,"Came here with a group of 9 that consisted of all my family. They don't take reservations so the wait was about 30-35 minutes.  Our waiter was such a sweet and loving lady! It was packed tonight but she still filled up my water cup (about 8 times - guys I know, I guzzle it down like no other lol) and checked up on us religiously. But, there were times where it seemed like she was trying to rush us...she asked us if we needed boxes about only 10 minutes after we got our food. Hm... I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich with a side of fries. Fries are good almost everywhere so I didn't have a problem with that. The sandwich though was mediocre at best, promise you, sandwiches are way better at your local shop. Always are. There was more bread than there were toppings and chicken which was depressing to a gal that LOVES chicken :(  The cheesecake I got was warm...like not ""cold/warm"". Warm-warm, which was unappetizing.  Service - 100% positive. Food...not so much, unfortunately."
Celina A.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/9/2017,"Bad service , prices high for the quality i had to ordered 3 different plates because they run out of everything even a tiramisu   They took to long, no napkins  And the manager was rude, and very  sarcastic  At least the one in Escondido  Do not waste your time  or money going there"
Luz P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/30/2017,"Dined here today and it was awesome.  Lucien our server greeted us immediately and gave us excellent service. Prompt attention, friendly attitude, knowledgeable about the menu and just overall fun nice guy.  Tried the Diane steak and turkey burger with celebration cake and lemon raspberry cheesecake. The flying gorilla drink was really tasty too!  Thank you for a great experience today!"
Spencer S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/15/2017,Terrible experience here. Let's start off with ordering.... I had a party of 6 and out of all 6 orders we made they were out of two of the six items. One dish we ordered they gave us only 3 shrimps..... we had to send it back to the kitchen for extra shrimp. Our food came out at separate times the salt and pepper shakers on the tables were so dirty that neither the salt nor the pepper came out. Last but not least the women's bathroom had no toilet paper... I'm very disappointed with this restaurant I used to really enjoy their food but after this experience I Will NOT be back.
Jon P.,"San Diego, CA",330,7,11,1.0,4/28/2017,"Gross. Came in, we waited 5 minutes. Multiple employees saw us, but did not acknowledge us. Someone finally came by to tell us she will get the hostess. Hostess finally sat us not apologizing for making us wait.. We find filthy silverware and nasty menus. We both had unknown substances on our menus. After looking at everything, we got up and left. This factory is filthy and disgusting. Gross."
Sean D.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,1.0,9/22/2016,"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant let alone a Cheesecake Factory. I have been to many Cheesecake Factory's in different areas, this was my first time at this location. I put my name down for a party of 7, even with empty two seaters around she said it would take 30 minutes, which was fine. After waiting the 30 minutes and seeing endless 2-4 top tables get seated that came in way after us, I went up to ask how much longer. The rude hostess said another 20 minutes after wanting to know why it would be that long she said it was because they were waiting for a table large enough to seat us. Being a waiter all throughout college, I knew this could be true. I asked why they couldn't just put some of the available smaller tables together, just section off what was available since we were waiting so long, which she said she couldn't do. After waiting another 20 minutes, I asked again and she rudely said another 20 minutes, which at that point was ridiculous. After waiting so long I went to the bathroom and noticed about 4/5 tables completely empty in the same area, when I brought this up to her she rudely said it was for a table of 11 people who requested it for 7pm. I was confused since at the Cheesecake factory you can't make reservations, she was incompetently and impolitely telling me that it wasn't a reservation. But in my mind a large group of people who put their name down for a specific time hours later is the exact definition of a reservation. The manager walked over and after asking him about this, she interjected and began practically yelling at me ""explaining"" how that wasn't a reservation and she would seat me when she would seat me. He didn't say anything he seemed completely clueless and unable to handle the situation. We decided to leave at that point, after waiting for over 70 minutes and go somewhere else close by. After another 30 minutes I got a text my ""table was ready"", guess by 40 minutes she met 100. All in all the hostess was extremely rude, the manager was incompetent and no one seemed to care. I would never go to this location ever again!"
Amanda P.,"Escondido, CA",45,21,2,4.0,6/12/2017,"This location is always busy. It's a bit frustrating that they don't take reservations or call aheads to get on the wait list. The food is always great, and I haven't had a poor server yet."
Chris M.,"Escondido, CA",63,135,25,2.0,2/19/2016,"This place sucks. The service is bad and eat at your own risk because the majority of this pre frozen then microwaved fattening gelatinous sodium encrusted crap for food is going to shoot out your other end with vengeance. And who in the hell needs a piece of cheesecake that's 6,000 calories? If your goal is a wholesome 400 pound figure then by all means stand on queue with the rest of the sheeple followers and leap to your own culinary ho hum'ness of doom and squirts."
Anthony E.,"San Diego, CA",230,445,36,4.0,10/28/2016,Cheeeeeeescake!!!! Really great place to enjoy a meal while mall shopping. Patio is the place to be though.
Jamaica W.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,,4.0,10/14/2017,"The wait was extremely long. The hostess' told us 45 mins...then another 10 more minutes...then another 10. My food was delicious, but my aunt ordered the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp which was really salty. They did offer her another plate. I have to say Sarah was our hostess and she was very attentive. She made sure to keep checking on us, and she was very courteous! She went above and beyond with making sure everything was ok with our party."
Tammy H.,"San Marcos, CA",0,14,,5.0,6/25/2017,"Haven't been there since they opened & was NOT IMPRESSED years ago when they first opened about 3 years ago, dirty dishes & poor quality food, BUT, decided to give them another try today, despite hesitation have to tell you! They have redeemed themselves! Our server ARIA even though he was new, was awesome!! Cheesecake Factory should be happy to have him! Excellent server & he will be manager some day! I've been in the food & beverage industry 25 years, & Can see talent! I'm starting up my own party rental/ fine catering business that's taking off! :) have to admit, expected to have bad service & poor quality food, but I had a great time today & food was great! Escondido Cheesecake Factory has ironed out its kinks since opening a few years ago! Kudos to them! :)"
