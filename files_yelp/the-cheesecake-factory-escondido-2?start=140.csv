Adam K.,"San Diego, CA",167,149,17,4.0,3/15/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory gets a lot of bad press at times. I read one article that claimed it had the worst food in America, but I tend to disagree. If you are a snobbish foodie, this probably isn't the place for you. However, for decent food at good prices, and a huge selection of choices, then you might want to check it out. The wait can sometimes be awhile as it gets crowded. Of course, while the food is decent, many people do go there for the deserts - after all, they aren't named the cheesecake factory for nothing! They have a large selection of cheesecakes to choose from, and they are all rich and decadent. Save room for desert, and while the food experience is kind of average, the deserts are great!"
Sabi L.,"San Diego, CA",283,262,425,4.0,4/25/2016,Every Cheesecake Factory is about the same. I highly recommend getting cheesecake here and the avocado egg rolls. Main courses are average. I'd recommend coming here especially if you're willing to share a plate since they're huge. But keep in mind each plate averages around $15.
Anonymous A.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",0,23,5,2.0,6/16/2017,"The servers here are always good and I've never had an issue with customer service, but oh my god they are always out of food. It's a gamble for me every time I come here and calling ahead doesn't help. Three times now I have attempted to order the artichoke spinach dip, which is definitely a popular menu item, and they are out. Tonight they were out of that, again, along with the meal I get every single time which is the four cheese pasta.  I don't know if it's an issue with management not ordering  enough food, or what, but it's not good. I just ended up paying for my drink and leaving tonight without food and went across the street disappointed to a different restaurant instead."
Lim K.,"San Diego, CA",0,374,177,2.0,11/4/2016,"I sat at the bar and ordered an Asian lettuce taco for lunch.  The bartender was very friendly and gave me good service; however, I was disappointed When I saw the lettuce taco.  The tacos were smaller than usual and the small piece of chicken inside was not grilled and was cold.  It looked like the chicken was pre cooked and kept in the refrigerator.   I have had Asian lettuce tacos in many different locations in the past and this was the worst.   I am used to get nicely grilled finger long chicken inside of each taco."
Ricardo D.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,4,5.0,3/27/2016,"Wow, seating was fast, only 10 minutes. Their menu is big. It took us 20 minutes to decide what to order. I ordered the combo shrimp scampi / Diane steak medium rare, wife ordered the Green chilaquiles with carnitas. Kids the usual: bacon bacon burger fries and Renee's special.  Big Surprise! The scampi does not come with pasta if ordered in combo, wish menu would state that, steak was well done (asked to be medium rare) chilaquiles were too spicy for her. :(  We told our server about our food, she immediately offered a redo, which we agreed.  The manager was informed and she promised to make it right, and even offered soup or salad.  What a difference this time, the plate was very satisfying, I convinced my wife to get the shrimp scampi, and she liked it.  Their level of service save the day thanks to our server Mercedes and Jennifer. I would definitely come back again."
Zach E.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",2,5,,5.0,3/5/2017,Always delicious meals at Cheesecake Factory. Recommend the chicken and waffles Benedict on their Sunday brunch menu.
Haylie R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",188,2,1,5.0,7/3/2017,"Just had dinner here and it was amazing. We sat in the bar and Caroline was absolutely the most accommodating waitress we have ever experienced. She was friendly, attentive and the best service I have ever had. Caroline was awesome and would definitely come back to her!"
James W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,67,84,2.0,8/20/2016,"We came to my wife's favorite restaurant to celebrate her birthday & they tried to squeeze seven and 1/2 (baby & stroller) of us into a six person spot. Fortunately the manager, who was gracious, agreed to let us move another two-person table over. But Cassandra our waitress was none too happy we combined the extra table, perhaps wanting the extra business. She seemed upset we went to the manager to request more space, when she wouldn't accommodate us.  Our food took a long time (retribution?) but was delicious, four stars. So the two star rating is for making us feel unwelcome for wanting adequate dining space to celebrate."
Kookie D.,"San Diego, CA",270,53,287,3.0,10/16/2016,"Good place to eat! Can't say too much just my only compliant, Not very consistent on food service delivery time here. You win you lose on food not coming out on time, ""something went wrong in the kitchen"" ""I see them putting your salad order in right now"" seems to be the common phrases we hear more often then not! But the food is good so we keep coming back. We get great service and the staff is very friend,  despite the food and line delays. They make up for it either free slice of cheesecake or cup of soup.  Favorite cheesecake: white chocolate caramel macadamia nut ohhhh yea!"
Samantha L.,"Oceanside, CA",43,2,1,2.0,6/24/2017,We were one of the first one here when it opened (11 am). Waited about 30 mins for our food. The waiter Andrew V. was great reasoning for the 2 star. Unfortunately I can't say food was great. All of our food was over cooked so I blame whoever cooking the food. Not satisfying whatsoever. Wouldn't recommend coming here.
Kristi S.,"San Diego, CA",61,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,"My friend and I went here on Monday for lunch. The reason why I'm giving this location a rating of 1 star is not because of our awesome waiter or the length of our waiting time. (which was only about 10 minutes---not bad!!)   We were let down when ordering two times!!! The menu is so large, they obviously can't manage it.  First off, we ordered the loaded tater tots and were told they would be right out. A few minutes later the waiter came back and told us if we still wanted them we would have to wait an hour! We obviously didn't want to wait an hour for tater tots so we ordered the factory nachos. The nachos were crispy but my love ended there, way too light on the toppings and nothing but the taste of salt near the bottom.  Now for our next let down.  We were done with our nachos and were ready to split a piece of cheesecake. We ordered the Kahlua cheesecake. This option was met with adoration from our waiter as he told us this was one of the best cheesecakes and that we would love it! We were totally looking forward to our dessert.  Then back comes the waiter, with a look on his face of Sorry, you're screwed again. He began to apologize and let us know they no longer carried the cheesecake. We laughed at first and were like seriously, let down again!!!!! He said he would send the manager over.  I would have to say the manager handled the situation very poorly.  He began to try and explain to us why the tater tots had to be unfrozen because they ran out the night before ....now guys, we were eating lunch at 1:00pm....you'd think they'd know they couldn't offer one of their ""popular"" menu items and let us know. He then began to tell us they 86'd the Kahlua at a meeting the night before and he just hadn't changed his menu!!!! Seriously!!!! You're fired in my eyes!  Poor management of the restaurant, he didn't offer a discount or a giftcard or anything......I won't be going back to that location!"
Heath F.,"Star, ID",9,7,1,5.0,2/26/2017,Me and my woman went out for date night and it was anything/everything we talked about. We have different taste and there was something in the menu for both of us. We actually shared a dish also. The staff was great and on point all night.
Nicholas F.,"Fallbrook, CA",134,9,3,5.0,11/23/2016,"Went here tonight with a close friend who just got back from college. She said she had never been and I needed to change that! I had the Alfredo with chicken and she had the chicken chipotle pasta. Both very delicious but we both agreed the alfredo is incredible. Highly recommend the chicken addition as the chicken is tender and delicious. She also had a cosmopolitan and a gin & tonic. She enjoyed both and said they were very generous with the alcohol (a huge plus for a younger crowd). We finished with the dutch apple caramel struessel cheesecake and it was incredible. The beginning started with the taste of your typical dutch apple pie and continued into a nice moist cheesecake. Incredible, just like many of their other cakes.  The service was also incredible. It only took 5 minutes to get a table at 6:30 PM. They also made sure to follow our request of outside by a heater. Only tip: Bring a sweater since only one side is next to a heater. Besides that, the fast, pleasant, and professional service along with the spectacular food made this a great visit. Definitely come here if you are at the mall and want to dine."
Alicia M.,"Oceanside, CA",86,62,43,5.0,4/10/2017,I RARELY come here but when I do it's for cheesecake. I have been craving the white chocolate raspberry truffle for a couple weeks now  I came and purchased one and I drove aaaalll the way home and it wasn't what I ordered. I called and spoke to the manager David and he is an absolute angel! He credited me for the wrong cheesecake and I will be coming back because of this awesome customer service!
Michelle D.,"Vista, CA",29,2,,1.0,6/18/2017,"I would give them zero stars if possible!  We have happily eaten here before and at other Cheesecake Factories, but today's experience was dismal.  We had planned a Father's Day dinner, so we were expecting the hour wait, but when we ordered steaks, we were told that they were out of steaks.  Taken aback, we requested more time to select something else. When the waitress returned we tried to order salmon and were told that they were also out of salmon...and pizza... among other selections. At this point, we just wanted to leave. The waitress wanted us to pay for the ice tea, and we asked to speak to the manager.  She returned and told us we could not pay for the iced tea and and the manager mumbled an apology as we left. Poor management of kitchen and poor customer service."
Kunal R.,"San Marcos, CA",0,9,1,1.0,7/27/2017,"Eeks - avoid this location if you can. This is the second time my son's pizza had a small bug in there and I found traces of hair in my pasta, how can they be so unhygienic? We went there thinking the first time could be a mistake but this time we were really disgusted and left without eating the food on the table. Their Cheesecake is good so I advise doing takeout of that but avoid their food at all cost."
Lisa S.,"Vista, CA",63,23,25,1.0,10/12/2016,The new bartender is way to yappy with bar patrons and is ignoring us. Marie needs more training or to go back on the floor as a waitress. Never had such poor service! Where's the experienced bartenders at?
Josie S.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",502,139,232,5.0,9/26/2016,"My husband and I came in on a Monday night around 5:30pm. The restaurant wasn't busy and we were seated the second we walked in. We sat at the bar so we could catch a glimpse of Monday night football. Our bartender was amazing I wish I could remember his name. He was super helpful with all my husband's beer questions and suggested we get some happy hour food and drinks before it ended.  My husband really liked the blonde ale on tap by a local Poway brewery called lightning. We also ordered the fried Mac n cheese on the menu which is our favorite! The mac n cheese is perfectly breaded and covered in a delicious marinara type sauce garnished with Parmesan and parsley. We orders the farfalle chicken which is our favorite pasta ever. Perfectly prepared with peas, sun dried tomatoes, garlic and bits of bacon it leaves your mouth watering with every bite. The portions are huge so if you plan on ordering the best part of the meal (dessert, hello you are at Cheesecake Factory) be sure to eat only half and get the other half to go. Their cheesecakes are all delicious. A favorite of mine is the Adam peanut butter and chocolate one and when the fall season comes around my inner basicness screams for the pumpkin pecan."
Meri D.,"San Diego, CA",99,730,2683,5.0,4/1/2015,"..and my 100th review goes to.. Cheesecake Factory.. my all time fave restaurant! *Excellent food, drinks, service, and ambiance= a great meal and time!* I've been coming to this location for about a year and a half now since it's grand opening. Before the Escondido location opened I would go to Fashion Valley once in a blue moon for friends birthdays etc, but it's nice to have one in North County.  The first time I came it was Christmas Eve 2013 dinner, within a month of the grand opening.. it was the longest wait ever for a table (1.5 hours), and the longest wait ever for the food (it felt like eternity because I was starving!). I was trying to get my family to try it, especially my parents to show how Cheesecake is the best however they weren't that impressed (I must have picked the wrong time to bring them here).  I still came back though over the past year I've done regular dining and happy hours.. every visit had been wonderful. I've had great servers and the food has been top notch. Come to cheesecake to celebrate special occasions or just because.. and happy dining!  MY FAVE ITEMS ON THE MENU: 1. Buffalo Chicken Blasts: crispy fried breaded wontons with hot sauce & blue cheese.. this is so filling!  2. Crispy Crab Wontons: fried wontons with crab and cream cheese with a sweet chilli sauce.. great appetizer!  3. Cheeseburger and Fries!.. juicy burger made just right! 4. Pasta Da Vinci.. flavorful..!"
Kristen S.,"East Village, San Diego, CA",0,27,6,5.0,6/11/2017,It's the Cheesecake Factory what's not to love! Sometimes we come and have longs waits (always expect a wait) other times we are seated right away! Food and service has always been great!
