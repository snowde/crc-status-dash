nolving M.,"Murrieta, CA",45,18,56,1.0,5/15/2017,"This place is beyond terrible in table management. We came in at 1:10 pm and were not seated until 3:55pm . We drove 45min to take my wife out for lunch and we're told the wait would be about an hour maybe hour thirty. And hour and 30 min later I go back just to be told it would be another 30 minutes. Another 30 minutes roll by and I go back to ask just to be told that I would have to wait another 30 minutes. Meanwhile there's been 4 tables vacant for 29 minutes in the front. 2 hours n 45 minutes later we finally get called and get zero apologies for the wait and zero customer recovery. Zero acknowledgement by management after I complained, as If ""tough $h!7 buddy"" attitudes. No explanation, no reasoning. Just be glad you're seated attitude. This place by far has the worse table management I've experienced. I've gotten better customer service from a hole in the wall in Central America than these people. In the picture you will see the vacant tables. Will avoid this one at all costs. You should too."
Elizabeth T.,"Escondido, CA",0,14,1,3.0,9/12/2017,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory the other day after having several bad experiences. Previously I ordered a chicken breast and it was raw yet the outside was cooked. I mentioned it to the waiter and they brought me back a different piece with the same issue. Chicken is not that hard to cook. Anyway, ordered the gumbo the other day and it was delicious. The service not so much. Wasn't that busy wait time was about 5 minutes yet our server didn't see us for about 15 minutes. As well as it took her a while to bring us the check. Would go back for the gumbo and obviously cheesecake 'cause cheesecake is amazing."
Kage S.,"San Diego, CA",4018,24,5,5.0,12/24/2016,"Came in at 10 tonight (Xmas eve) & our server Bryce was an Allstar. We got the lemon-garlic Shrimp Pasta & the California Avocado Salad. Both were outstanding. Even on a holiday an hour before close, our food and service was as good as it gets. Bryce managed 5 tables with a positive attitude and stellar service."
Zue W.,"Cathedral City, CA",33,210,737,1.0,2/11/2016,Stopped by today everything was great until we had the fruit flies showed up after our meal got to the table !! We asked to speak to the manager because one landed into our fettuccine Alfredo plate and the other on my wine glass. Andrew came over to our table he already looked annoyed I told him what happened and showed him all the fruit flies and instead of saying sorry guys his answer was well what do you want me to do?? I said nothing I don't want you to do nothing I felt so mad the way he spoke to us. I know we all have bad days but that's no way to speak to you customers and not need to say we are regulars here.   Our waitress was very salty also I guess over all it was a bad day for everyone and it was not even busy.
Nichole C.,"Escondido, CA",45,2,3,5.0,4/7/2017,Went here for lunch the other day and had a great experience. We had a really good waitress and I feel bad I forgot her name but she is from New York. She was on top of everything. The food was great and was served pretty fast. Can't wait to go back
Jesus G.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/11/2017,This is my favorite places to come and splurge. Great appetizers. Good is always delicious. Service has been great most of the time. Desserts......spectacular..
Ashley L.,"San Diego, CA",1,11,4,1.0,3/30/2017,I am giving this place a one star because there is no zero star option. This place is horrible as well as the service and manager. I was told to wait for 2 hours and I would get my table for 10. Then after the 2 hours we were told that we needed to wait another hour. That hour passed by and still didn't get to sit down after the manger told us he would be able to seat us.
Arlyn E.,"Oceanside, CA",24,155,3,4.0,2/17/2016,"Ok so normally I don't often go to Cheesecake Factory let alone go to restaurants due to finances. This time it was because of my loving fiancee wanting to treat me often. How can I refuse such an offer?!  It was very crowded and ended up waiting. We got worried as to if they forgotten us because others who came after us were already seated. Whether they had reservations or other reasons is uncertain. Upon being seated, I noticed the seats were a bit dirty still and so was the table. I ended up taking a napkin and a bit of water to at least clean the table.  Food is always great. No complaints there. My one main complaint was my drink. More than half of my drink was filled with ice. One doesn't pay for a drink just to have ice. I ended up taking out majority of the ice onto a saucer. My fiancee was baffled as to how much ice there really was. I didn't bother asking for another one just because of how busy it was.  We forgot how big the portions are and ended up taking much of the food home with us, which worked out well for my fiancee so he could have something to take to work for his lunch. If only we didn't order an appetizer and perhaps share the main dish then we could've tried out a dessert.  Overall it was a good experience. Nothing too severe that would make us not come here again. Perhaps we'll just dine for lunch during times when it's not too crowded."
Brooke B.,"Escondido, CA",182,136,61,1.0,10/29/2015,"I've never had such horrible service. From the moment I checked in...waited and waited for my table. They gave my table away by accident, TWICE. Then I decide to order take out to not wait any longer. THIRTY minutes later....!!!!!!  The employees are not concerned with customer service at all, only making excuses for why they are right.  Finally a manager brings my take out food and I ask her to comp it. She does so, but as soon as I'm home I open my container and find the WRONG food!!! Ahhh!!  Lame sauce. Never going back."
Ashley H.,"Ontario, CA",1,15,16,1.0,4/10/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but the experience was just not what I expected from here. Long story short Page (our server) was horrible... she messed up on two of our orders and never input the drinks we ordered as well. When I asked about the drinks, she replied with , ""I totally forgot, must of had a blonde moment "" Once we were finished with our food, she brings the drink order, not once did she apologize for HER mistake. I had to ask for some kind of composition for her not placing the order. She spoke to her manager Tony Maccianti who ONLY offered to take $2.50 off the bill. The food is great here but the service sucks."
Rosalinda F.,"Escondido, CA",159,4,2,5.0,4/8/2016,"I went in with my friend last night and the host Last night was amazing 04/07/16 she greeted me and asked if I wanted to sit in a booth or table. I chose table.  She was very sweet I didn't get her name which i love to mention but she was great. Also my sever was really great too his name was Peter he was great came by to check up on us which is great. I ordered a pineapple mojito brought me water which was nice(: it tasted really good first timer. Props to the bartender, got my appetizer (avocado egg rolls) were very very delicious. We also ordered orange chicken it was really good but the white rice it tasted very dry and it tasted not cooked. So I didn't like that. I next ordered a ultimate margarita it was good. I love the service here and will come back(: thanks to PETER!"
james p.,"San Diego, CA",339,75,87,4.0,12/25/2016,"So we decided to grab a bite to the at here. Our waitress was Taylor and she truly made our night pleasant. Her recommendation for the parm crusted chicken with pasta was excellent! The chicken was amazing , so good that my friends chicken tasted bland compared to my plate. Although we had an issue with our appetizer coming after our entree. Taylor was quick to resolve the issue , and was sincerely apologetic . I get it , it's the holidays... it's crazy... no big deal. My drinks never made it past 1/4 of the cup, she was quick to refill. If you enjoy banana pudding as much as I do, the banana cream cheesecake is pretty spot on."
Chelsea S.,"Orange, CA",45,287,,4.0,1/5/2016,"Unlike most people who come here, I don't actually come for the cheesecake- I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Since it's located in the mall it's in a very convenient location, and I really enjoy the outdoor seating. The jambalaya pasta is my go-to. It's not traditional jambalaya, but it has a great flavor. Not spicy but definitely not bland. The chicken they put in it is great, it falls apart in your mouth and is cooked perfectly."
Kacie H.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,1,1.0,9/5/2017,Food was okay but unfortunately we had a horrible server. Didn't check on us at all and didn't even realize that I didn't get my full order till she came to hand us our bill. Would not recommend.
Eric F.,"San Diego, CA",340,373,2006,4.0,2/1/2016,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because I can't really find much to complain about other than the wait and maybe a little overpriced.  I frequent this chain probably about 4-6 times a year and the food is ok but it doesn't wow me.  I don't recall ever telling myself I need to go back for ... because it was so awesome.  The one standout for them is their namesake the cheesecake selection.  The variety is second to none but I do think it is overpriced per slice.  I bought 4 slices this last trip and it came out to over $35!!  STEEP RIGHT?  The food is consistently decent as it should be but it is still to me just like some of the other places like BJ's.  I also seem to come here more for work lunches and when someone visiting requests it.  Would I come back?  Yes I'm sure I will, but not the first choice on my list of where to have a family meal."
Butt O.,"Escondido, CA",0,20,,2.0,7/16/2017,The food was good but the service sucked and they never brought my daughters drink which was upsetting because I still paid for it.
LaKisha L.,"Temecula, CA",105,17,6,1.0,3/11/2017,"I called the to make a Togo order for my sis in law that just had her baby today to bring her a delicious dinner. I was on hold for 10 minutes. I hung up and asked to speak to a manager, held for another 3  minutes finally Brian the manager picks up and takes my order very rude.  He tells me to pick it up from curbside. Once I get there I called and 4 times and I kept getting hung up on. Since they kept hanging up on me I decided to walk in and pick up my food. I got to the bakery counter and asked to speak to the manager to voice my frustrations! He came up to me with a crazy look on his face told me I was a liar about someone hanging up on me. The manager Brian is a MAJOR DICK and I will be calling corporate to voice a complaint!! If my sis didn't want this food I would have told him to stick it up his butt."
Ashley H.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",5,18,1,5.0,9/24/2016,"I always like Cheesecake Factory, but today I absolutely loved it! Alexander was our server and he was fantastic! Most servers don't seem enthused to wait on a family with 3 little kids, but he took care of us 100% with a smile on our face even though we were a bit needy today.  The buffalo blasts were hot, delicious bites of crispy naughtiness. The blue cheese and ranch dressings are amazing. My husband got one of the pastas and absolutely loved it. I really wish we lived a little closer so we could visit this location more often!"
A P.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,13,,2.0,7/11/2017,"Bad service, was eventually contacted."
Maria M.,"San Diego, CA",14,71,36,3.0,8/15/2016,"Nothing special. Not worth the price. Hit and miss.  Went there for cheesecake but by the time we got done shopping and got seated it was time for dinner so we decided to have dinner before the cheesecake.  Service was fantastic. No complaints there. Had to wait for over 20 mins to get seated but oh well, I can live with that. Everything looked so amazing that we decided it was worth the wait.  Once we were seated, the waitress got our order, and brought us our drinks and some bread with butter to keep us happy till our food made it to the table. We ordered two medium cooked cheeseburgers - one old fashioned for my husband, and one mac and cheese for our 10 year old, and a farmhouse omelette for me. 20 mins later we had our food. One of the burgers came medium-rare, almost rare, and the other one came well done. Tasty but a bit disappointing that we didn't get the burgers cooked the way we wanted them. Tasty enough that we didn't send them back. However, we had to ask for a few extra tomato slices since both burgers only came with a small slice of tomato inside. Fries were excellent.  My farmhouse omelette dish was very disappointing! I chose a side of potatoes with it. The potatoes were bitter, had too much paprika and were burnt. Definitely not edible. Well, maybe good enough for someone starving who hasn't touch food in a week but definitely not good enough for someone paying good money for them. Someone needs to teach the chef how to cook (or fire him/her)!The omelette was tasteless. I would give it a 3 on a 10 scale. It was bad. I barely touched the dish. It was not good at all. I helped my kid finish her burger and stole some of the fries that came with it. They were fantastic! One of the best fries I've ever had!  We ordered the white chocolate raspberry truffle for our little one for dessert. It was very disappointing. I expected more for $7.45 per slice. Basic cheesecake with raspberry syrup that tasted very chemically, topped with two blobs of reddi-whip! Really, I expected more!  Based on our one time experience I don't think we'll be back there for dinner. Definitely not worth the price. But we might be back to try some of the other cheesecakes. They do look good. Hopefully the other ones taste better.  I can't give them more than 3 stars. I really can't."
