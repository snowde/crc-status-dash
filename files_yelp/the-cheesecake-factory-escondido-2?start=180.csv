Eva W.,"Vista, CA",256,11,,5.0,3/20/2017,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but the last couple of times I had been in the service was so so, and the food was just average. HOWEVER, last Saturday my mother, son, and I stopped in for a quick bite, and got AMAZING service! Kelly was our waitress and she was an absolute sweetheart and very attentive to my son who was a bit cranky. She went out of her way to make sure he had something to color with and stayed entertained while we waited for our food. Both my mother and I have waitressed, and we know good customer service when we see it. Thank you Kelly for being so awesome!"
Gavin C.,"San Diego, CA",125,33,48,4.0,12/12/2015,"What can you say? It's the Cheesecake Factory. Menu larger than Hemmingway, booze, noise, and good food. Amazing food? No, it's a factory. Good place for conversation and shopping breaks assuming the line is bearable. It's comfort food in an unconventional environment. Sometimes that's what you need."
Lyndie B.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/8/2017,"This was the worst service, because there was NO SERVICE we sat at a table for 30 minutes nobody came to get drink orders or bring us bread, and there was a waiter who passed us about 10 times!! My fiancé went and talked to the manager who was nice however had no way to fix the problem! Worst experience ever! I've never had to get up and leave a table before. 0 STARS"
Jose G.,"Murrieta, CA",373,574,1354,3.0,8/22/2014,"Well... after 2 different visits, I'm a little torn on this review. First visit, we arrived right at 4 for happy hour and sat at the bar. Out bartender was pretty busy but still managed to check in with us and provided great service. From what I can remember since I can't look at my photos right now, we ordered Tex Mex rolls, Chicken tenders, a Margarita, a large salad, and some cheesecake. Everything was all super tasty and dandy. Our second and most recent visit was NOT the same as the first one. After a day at the Safari park, we came here also minutes after 4 PM for their happy hour and an early dinner.  Our waitress seemed really nice at first, but often kept just walking away as we were trying to make an order. We finally ordered the same chicken tender appetizer as last time, only to be told 10 minutes later that they were out of stock on the tenders...  We almost decided to leave, but decided to order some fried macaroni cheese balls instead and a really good Chicken entree (which I can't remember the name of, but I uploaded a photo of) with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  So long story short... happy hour is decent, service is hit or miss, and the portions/quality of the food are great."
Christina C.,"Houston, TX",135,612,225,4.0,5/23/2016,"Came here with my family on a weeknight. There was a 15 minute wait, not so bad. The hostess was nice. We were seated in a big booth.  We had the filet mignon, rib eye steak, kale salad and pepperoni pizza. All the food was good. Our waitress, Cassandra was lovely. The restaurant was nice and clean. We would come back in the future."
Jen R.,"Vista, CA",2015,146,666,5.0,4/27/2016,"I used to go to Cheesecake Factory on a regular basis while growing up in Orange County and in fact, was a regular at the Huntington Beach location for years as I lived literally down the street. Since Moving to San Diego in 2009 I must admit I had not been back to either the OC or SD locations and was pleasantly surprised to stop in today. It brought back wonderful memories of family dinners, happy hours with coworkers, and my 21st birthday at the Newport Beach location as the decor is exactly the same across all restaurants. We decided to sit in the bar area as we just wanted a small bite and a few drinks after several hours of shopping and the happy hour deals can't be beat. Fried Chicken Sliders were a pleasant and tasty surprise with deliciously tender but, crispy, well seasoned meat. Everything is served on the side which works well for my produce-hating husband. Yup, just give him the meat please. The tomatoes, pickles and lettuce were perfectly fresh and the latter two added the most perfect extra crunch for me. We also ordered nachos and here's where it got amusing. Everything on the side. Literally everything. If it ain't meat and cheese the hubs wants no part. So, the waiter graciously obliged to place the order with chips and cheese only and brought out little dishes with the sour cream, Pico de gallo and, guacamole on the side. I swear my husband missed out as the guac and Pico were outstanding and the perfect accompaniment to the cheesy chips. He actually apologized profusely for his fussiness to which the server, a wonderful young man named Andy, smiled and reassured my hubs it was not a problem at all. On that note: Andy was very attentive, patient, friendly and accommodating to us: the kind of server you always hope to get.  We ordered the requisite cheesecake to go for my sweets loving husband and headed home with full, happy bellies."
Pat J.,"Escondido, CA",2,2,1,5.0,10/2/2016,Excellent food and service.wonderful relaxing experience the velvet cheese cake was delicious.salmon also tasty and fresh
Addison G.,"Tempe, AZ",22,91,4,3.0,6/15/2016,"Definitely closer to a 2.5. The reason I am rounding up is because the food was absolutely delicious! I got the GF pasta, mom got a soup and salad, husband got pizza and a salad. All of us said our food was phenomenal.  But man, did it take FOREVER. We were seated, and it must have 15 minutes before we were even greeted by our server to order drinks. Ordered drinks, server came back another 10 minutes later to give us our drinks and some bread. We ordered. The food actually didn't take as long to get to us. But every time we requested anything, a refill, more bread, or had a question, it took 10 minutes for her to come back to us, each time. It's good food, if you have that kind of time. I've never been to another Cheesecake Factory that took this long to deliver anything."
Skylar T.,"San Diego, CA",34,180,762,5.0,9/20/2015,"I don't eat cheesecake so I can't speak on it, but I really like their food.  The only negative thing about this restaurant is that it can get REALLY busy so the wait can get so long, especially around the holidays. Other than that, I have no complaints.  The complimentary wheat bread is great, the fried calamari are crunchy and tasty and the fried avocado rolls are delicious.  I always order the spicy chipotle chicken pasta and it has never disappointed me."
Ben P.,"San Marcos, CA",127,17,20,1.0,8/3/2016,"Worst cheescake branch!  I'm a business owner myself and I've never seen so much of a bad Service and lack of attention to customers. In my point of you when you go out of the house in order to eat somewhere else you're looking for the place that will host you right and give you the best service and the best food for the right price. Cheesecake factory for itself is not a hit however they do have some stuff that I like and this time when I came with my girlfriend they put us around lot of noisy people, and families with kids that scream. After I was moved to another location in the restaurant I was told I cannot get a beer since I don't have my passport or US ID. Since I'm not a resident I have my Israel license and the date of birth is clear, however this restaurant did not have the book that shows how IDs from different countries look alike and that's why they couldn't verify my age, 27. It is well known the cheesecake factory is a place that a lot of tourists are eating at and never give problems with international IDs. The manager told us that there's not a possibility to serve alcohol although I always use this ID in any other cheesecake factory restaurant, I will never get back there, bad service and very square mind."
Joanne B.,"San Diego, CA",1010,663,2397,4.0,8/29/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great addition to this suburbia mall since it lacked anchor restaurants that were appealing to me. Since we were already heading to North County Fair to run some errands, we decided to grab a bite to eat at TCF since we also had an old $50 gift card that I found as I was organizing a drawer at home (score!). When we arrived a little after 5pm on a Friday, the foyer was already full of hungry customers waiting for a table.  Fortunately, I was able to nap a pair of seats at the bar as this gal was getting up. I had the surf & turf combo (shrimp scampi) and steak Diane with mashed red potatoes.  My hubby ordered off the happy hour menu (which is from 4 to 6pm M-F) and had the pot stickers and chicken sliders.  He originally wanted the fresh spring rolls, but was told they had already ran out (boooo). My dish wasn't bad.  The shrimp scampi looked over cooked, but it actually tasted fine.  The steak was cooked more well done than the medium I asked for, but at least I know for next time to order it medium-rare, lol.  However, the pot stickers my hubby had were way too salty.   Overall, service was good, my $5 happy hour cosmo made me forget about the bad work week I had, so all was good  in the north county hood for this girl."
Gina B.,"Valley Center, CA",0,95,29,3.0,2/4/2017,"The food was okay, the atmosphere was very load. We will probably go back one more time to see if the food gets any better. But the noise level is a little much for us."
Hector L.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/15/2017,3hr wait time for a group of nine- no options - no alternatives - Manager seemed surprise that our party was surprised to be quoted a 3 hr wait time.  No interest in offering alternatives to split the group. Take it or leave it attitude.
Melissa T H.,"The Woodlands, TX",274,465,2054,4.0,8/2/2014,"Back to a great lunch here - again in the bar area.  Ryan was an attentive server. We ordered some new things: Skinnylicious Pear & Endive salad $13.95 - EXCELLENT.  Very light on the dressing, which I don't mind.  Gorgonzola was the perfect foil to the tender fresh greens, carmelized pears and nuts.   Lunch Special Chicken/Sundried tomatoe fettuccine was very good - tender chicken and creamy sauce.  $11.95   Then the surprise KNOCKOUT HIT: the new LEMON MERINGUE CHEESECAKE $7.95. Trust me:  get it.  It was out of this world delicious:  tart, creamy, torched marscapone topped the sheer awesomeness of this new dessert offering.  Seriously it is my new favorite cheesecake!"
Phil M.,"Long Beach, CA",21,2,14,5.0,9/12/2016,"My wife Suzan and I stopped in yesterday afternoon for a late lunch around 3pm. It was crazy busy, but we only had to wait 15 min. For a table. I ordered the Club Sandwich, one of the best I've had. I am addicted to these and order them everywhere. Suzan ordered the Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich and loved it as well. She also ordered a slice of their Key Lime Cheesecake to go. She ate it last night and it was very good, however it couldn't hold a candle to the same desert at Joe's CrabShack  at the Oceanside Harbor. It is excellent there. Service was excellent by the way."
Wayne E.,"San Diego, CA",113,34,,5.0,11/27/2016,"great service excellent staff and speedy service, the vide was incredible and the staff were friendly and we shared great conversations and jokes. The food was fresh and of great quality, I have nothing bad to say! can't wait to go back! excellent for a date!"
Deep B.,"Del Mar, CA",0,33,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"People don't have patience when it comes to waiting for your name to be called. The least the hosting staff can do is answer questions to make the wait comfortable. I was told it would take 1.5 hours for a table. I agreed and waited. Went up to ask how much longer. The response I got was "" you committed to 1.5 hours and you've only waited 50 minutes"" I know what I committed to just tell me how much longer. A better response would have been. ""There are still 10 parties ahead of you so it's looking closer to the original time we committed to you.  Hope they coach their team on how to service at the front line. What a disappointment"
Tina A.,"Oceanside, CA",44,71,75,4.0,6/25/2016,The service was great and the food was great as well. Exactly what I expect from the Cheesecake Factory. The chicken madeira is amazing as always. The cheesecakes are terrific but usually are on the sweet side.
Katt M.,"Poway, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/2/2017,"100%. 10/10. I can't believe this place has bad reviews. This is my home. My home away from home. I live here. They play my favorite music, they serve my favorite food. Me and Shane Dawson be Cheesecake Factory spokespeople. I preach about the Cheesecake Factory. Only restaurant I eat at. Loyal till the end  I recommend their iced water. Best thing ever. Their brown bread is my religion. It's worth the expensive price and every penny added. If you're looking for cheesecakes, the winner has to be ms Reese's peanut butter cup. She has so many layers and so much depth. Don't be boring and get that low carb cheesecake. Go on a diet another day. Cheesecake Factory cheesecake is literally something I want to marry. Ugh. Yes. Just go here."
Miguel A.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/6/2017,"Decided to have our last family meal together at The Cheesecake Factory since two of my kids are leaving for college. Our waiter was kind and courteous and unfortunately had to apologize twice for having to come back with bad news from the kitchen (not his fault). Once for an entree that was not longer available, and another time for a pie that we were hoping to celebrate with. (again, not his fault) When our waiter detected a bit of disappointment, he asked if we wanted to speak with his manager to see if there was anything he could do to make our night a great last dinner experience.  To our surprise, Brian (the manager) came over and made us feel like whiners and simply said, ""We run out of things on occasion and there's nothing I can do."" Turned around and walked away with a rude smug attitude. After getting a bill of over $104.00 I would have been happy with a complementary slice of anything. He acted like we had just woke him up from a nap, and bothered him with having to come over to converse with our family. Not what you would expect from a manager.  My wife and I used to try and catch their happy hours and dinners with the family, but we're not going to be giving them our business any longer, plainly because of the attitude displayed when confronted with a simple issue."
