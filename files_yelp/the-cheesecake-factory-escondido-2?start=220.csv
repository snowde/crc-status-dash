Jamie K.,"Oceanside, CA",40,62,3,5.0,9/28/2016,You can always expect to eat a yummy meal! Don't forget to save room for their awesome cheesecakes! My mom loves to come here for their Flying Gorilla drinks which takes similar to a banana split blended into an alcoholic drink.
Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",514,1202,8732,3.0,3/17/2014,"Shhh...don't tell anyone.... This Cheesecake Factory has a HAPPY HOUR Mon-Fri from 4-6p! EVERYTHING ON HH MENU IS $5. YES. YOU HEARD ME. FIVE BUCKS.  Well, beer is $4. Ok, you can start sending me yelp compliments now...j/k... Sis and I recently discovered this Happy Hour but it was kind of on a sour note. She purchased an expensive cheesecake for husband's bday and that cheesecake turned out to be pretty bad.  Management let us return it and gave us a gift card (not a full refund on credit card and not a full amount on gift card either).   But that's how I found out about their HH b/c we had to wait around for quite some time for manager to issue gift card.  Their HH is no where to be found online or on their website. So hoping this review will help fellow yelpers out there.  Here are the list of their 16 (yes, 16!!) HH items: Roadside Sliders Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip Avocado Eggrolls Fried Macaroni and Cheese Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Southern Fried Chicken Sliders Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls Guacamole Made-To-Order Tex Mex Eggrolls Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke Factory Nachos Buffalo Blasts Chicken  Pot Stickers Crispy Crab Wontons Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread Do you know how long it took to type that out.   We had: - Mojito $5: really good. A nice portion and I loved how they used plenty of fresh mint for this drink - glass of cabernet $5: decent pour but not the best cab we've ever had for HH - Southern Fried Chicken Sliders: Crispy Fried Chicken Breast on Mini-Buns Served with Lettuce, Tomato and Pickles Four sliders come out and each sweet roll has a fried piece of chicken. The sweet rolls are buttered and grilled (yummy!). I thought the fried chicken was dry but friend thought this was a really good slider. - Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip: A Delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes and Cheese Served Warm with Grilled Bread It's not a large portion but it's sufficient enough as the cheese is pretty rich. It did taste like real crab was used as well. I wasn't a fan of the toasted bread crumbs on top. - Avocado Eggrolls Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. This is my favorite appetizer here at The Cheesecake Factory. the deep fried avo eggrolls here are divine. The avocado is creamy and plentiful. The eggroll wrapper is fried perfectly and provides a nice crunch to this dish. The selling point really is the tamarind dipping sauce. It has such a unique sweetness to it that I just love so much. - Guacamole : Made To Order Not bad. You can request the guac to be made mild/med/spicy. Was it the best happy hour we've been to? I wasn't too impressed with the food but I wasn't all that hungry that early evening. But when was the last time you had the chance to choose from 16 items on a Happy Hour menu. When was the last time you saw ANYTHING on TCF's appetizer menu for $5. It felt like finding a nickle on the ground (versus a penny). You know that feeling... Take advantage of this HH if you're around this area. I heard a rumor that the Fashion Valley location might start a happy hour as well."
Courtney O.,"San Diego, CA",584,640,561,5.0,8/16/2015,"The only thing you have to remind yourself when coming to the Cheesecake Factory is that calories don't count. Lying to yourself is allowed.  I stopped into this Cheesecake Factory just to pick up some take out to go. Unlike most locations I've been to, they had good control of the waiting crowd so the waiting area wasn't too congested. I was able to easily get to the counter to order my banana cream cheesecake. I'm usually a red velvet or Oreo cheesecake regular but I was told that the banana cream is a must have so I gave it a try. SO GLAD I DID! It was absolutely delicious! Surprised the BF with a slice after a huge exam he had and we were both in cheesecake heaven. Yum yum!"
Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",416,873,603,3.0,5/27/2014,"I've been looking forward to visiting the new Cheesecake factory in Escondido since before it opened as I really like the food there even though you get big portions and it's a little pricey.  FINALLY, we headed over for an early lunch on Memorial Day. Overall, we had a good experience.  We had no wait., so that was awesome, but after a few minutes we realized we were FREEZING.  We asked to move outside to defrost, but she said they only had one table available out there and it was in full sun and not very comfortable.  As our food arrived right then, we decided to stick out the cold a little longer. As for the food, the husband had chicken wings, which he loved.  They were pretty big and even a la carte, were enough for a meal for him.  I ordered off of the ""skinny menu"" which I was happy to find had normal sized portions!  I had the lemon shrimp that came with asparagus and a small amount of capellini.  It was delicious AND I had room for cheesecake.   Well, as for the cheesecake, I take full responsibility for not asking questions.  I ordered the carrot cake swirled cheesecake because it listed on it that it had almonds... most carrot cake does have walnuts which I am mildly allergic to. And I should have asked instead of assuming the almonds were all the nuts that would be there, but walnuts were swirled throughout so i was picking them out... not as yummy.   Our server was very friendly, but a little on the forgetful side and possibly new.  She mixed our order with someone else's and the bill had to be re-arranged and she didn't get the add on scoop of ice cream with the cheesecake or the ranch instead of bleu cheese.  She made up for it with being very nice, though. I thought it was a little loud in there, but the husband disagreed.  The ladies room was neat and clean as was the rest of the restaurant. We'll definitely go back for more!"
Chris M.,"Oceanside, CA",1,17,7,2.0,6/13/2015,Well Cheesecake Factory is just that tons of Cheesecake !! I personally really don't like the food but the service is always great (for the most part! She forgot my lemon and our drinks took a minute) and my son loves the Oreo cheesecake.  I have to recommend he Fried Macaroni (delicious!!) which means it's probably terrible for you!!!  Also the strawberry shortcake is surprisingly WONDERFUL!!!!  It is with fresh strawberry and freshly biscuits and vanilla ice cream and whipped cream w/ these wonderful surprises called small sugar crystals sprinkled throughout - great another 10 miles to run but certainly worth it!! Also like the coffee and steamed milk!!  However for the 100 plus bucks for so-so food you get two stars!  Go for desert only!!
Arnel D.,"San Diego, CA",1560,1907,6793,3.0,5/21/2015,This location is always busy and really sure why... The food and drinks are decent but a bit overpriced. Their staff try their best to take care of everyone and refill drinks quickly. Their bar is decent but only has two TVs. It's really easy to get in and out of but not worth the wait during busy times. I enjoy the hibachi steak dinner and recommend the strawberry cheesecake!
X D.,"San Diego, CA",35,299,1247,3.0,4/24/2016,First time here and we split appetizers and shrimp sandwich. Buffalo won tons are a must! The shrimp sandwich was really huge so be aware when you order it. It's decent but nothing to ever order again. It was midday on a weekday so not so busy. I really did not understand why we needed to wait to get refills on our water.
Kristine T.,"San Diego, CA",83,603,431,1.0,2/16/2015,"Can the service get any worse at this location? I DO NOT GET IT. We came here for lunch yesterday. Our server was: DESIREE.  1. We were sitting outside in the sun. Asked her if she could ask the bus boy to move some umbrellas around for us because we saw that he was doing that for other tables. We had to ask her 3 times. We saw no one come out. The 4th time we asked her, she told the hostess that we wanted to move umbrellas. The hostess said ""Unfortunately, it gets really bad out here. We cannot move these umbrellas"". So my boyfriend said ""So you are unable to make adjustments?"" She just looked dumbfounded and said ""Let me ask the bus boy for you"". Again, we had to ask 3 times and still NO ONE adjusted the umbrellas.  2. We had to wait 15 minutes to get water and she forgot his coffee. She eventually brought the coffee but did not bring the sugar till 10 minutes after the coffee.  3. When she came to ask if we were ready to order, we said yes. I also asked for some bread and Desiree snapped and said ""I usually ask after I take your order"". RUDE. The table behind us had a super sweet waiter. She asked them ""Can I get you guys started with any drinks?"" And after they ordered their drinks she said ""Would you like some fresh bread while you look over your menus"". I wish we asked for a waiter switch.  I am not sure why we always get stuck with the worst waiters. Cheesecake, please train your staff accordingly!!!"
Kris M.,"San Diego, CA",12,45,30,4.0,3/15/2015,"It's always busy here so make sure you come in extra early if you don't want to wait. Their menu is very extensive and thus it's easy to lose yourself in it for a good 10 minutes.  I recently had their tempura shrimp tacos and they were delicious!! There were four tacos on my plate so the dish lived up to the ""huge portion"" standard that is known at this establishment.  My go to cheesecake here are the Godiva and Oreo Extreme."
Mario L.,"San Diego, CA",65,143,119,4.0,5/10/2015,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, The wait sucks, the lobby gets packed, every seat at the bar will be taken, and don't go too far because you have to check-in within the time allotted; This was a tough pill to swallow.  45 minute wait, told it would be a 20 minute wait. Once seated everything fell into place nicely.  I appreciate the Karl Strauss and Thunderweizen on tap.  The menu has a lot of items, largest variety of cheesecakes I have ever beheld.  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta w/Shrimp and Chicken and a mango key lime pie cheesecake.  The Jambalaya pasta turned my attitude completely around.   The dish has a lot of seasoning so it is spicy but I enjoyed it.  I'm not sure how the cooks made the chicken but it was the most tender piece of chicken I've ever had.  The shrimp was good but the chicken was extremely good.  The vegetable pasta was a pleasant surprise, the sauce was buttery, and the portion was enough.   The waiter was really courteous and took the time to talk about the menu with us. I'll be back and order a beer for the wait."
Lisa H.,"Poway, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/30/2017,"Brought my family in tonight and was given an absurd 3 hour wait for our table. The best thing we did was get a table at the bar. Dani was our server, she couldn't have been any nicer. Dinner was good but the service was awesome! Thank you Dani!"
Jamie J.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/26/2016,Yummy cheesecake in the mall. This is my go to place every time I go shopping. You are sure to find everything you want from good food to awesome drinks and of course their famous lemon cheese cake is delicious !! I love it ;-)
Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",811,680,1769,5.0,1/30/2014,"I've avoided The Cheesecake Factory like the plague because I've been terrified at looking at their menu. What's inspired the terror? The rumors that their menu items sport some of the highest caloric counts in the country. Well, I had a light lunch there with my parents this past Sunday and my anxiety was tempered when I encountered a menu that was devoid of caloric information -- I didn't have to stare at an actual calorie number that would discourage me from ordering what I wanted. Thank goodness! My sister and I decided to take full advantage of their bar; I decided on a glass of the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. It was lovely, showcasing light notes of citrus. There's nothing I enjoy more on a late Sunday morning breakfast/brunch than a glass of wine.   The family shared an order of the nachos to whet the appetites. I tried to be good, only having a few controlled bites. The nachos were actually done quite well. The chips tasted as if they were made from scratch, and the sauce, cheese, and other toppings melded together quite well. Superior taste. I tried to play it relatively good and avoided what I thought would be too heavy. I opted for the Chicken Salad Sandwich and asked for a green salad in lieu of the french fries that come with it. The sandwich was stellar. It was very well-balanced, the chicken not being bathed in too much mayonnaise. The bread was perfectly toasted and had a lovely flavor.  My mom had a spicy chicken sandwich. I commandeered it for a second and took a bite; it had a lovely kick to it! Everyone else at the table seemed to be genuinely pleased with their choices, too! I avoided dessert, but mom and dad walked out with cheesecake for later.  Yeah, this is a chain, but it's darn good. I may now have to visit The Cheesecake Factory that recently opened up in my neighborhood!"
Samahna S.,"San Marcos, CA",715,265,1884,5.0,1/26/2016,"While we were at the mall today, we stopped in for lunch. The past few visits, I've left less than impressed but we gave it another go and it was great! We sat in the bar area at a high top table. It was bright and airy with all of the windows. Our server Jeanie was top notch! Her cheery, helpful attitude was refreshing! We ordered a couple Dos Equis and browsed the menu. The menu is just massive! I was very impressed with their appetizer options! There were so many to choose from! I chose the appetizer Greek Salad. Hubby chose the appetizer sliders. My salad was super fresh with good sized cuts of tomatoes and cucumbers with feta and the vinaigrette was so I good! Hubby's sliders were AWESOME! There were 4 of them (really good sized!). He added American cheese and asked for extra pickles. Wow! It was tough eating my salad while he thoroughly enjoyed those yummy sliders! It was a lot of food for appetizers! Jeanie was excellent from start to finish. I have zero complaints and we will be returning....very soon! And I'll be enjoying some sliders too! :D"
Aisha N.,"Escondido, CA",37,72,1352,5.0,9/22/2016,"To start, there was no line!! Can you say awesome??? Our meal was delicious, affordable, quickly served, peaceful (yes, even during Thursday night football). We ordered the Pear Flatbread which is low calorie and also a great price of $6.95. We also ordered the Fish Tacos Tempura style. There were four street tacos with black beans and rice at a price of $13.95. Our server, Roberto, was pleasant, polite, very respectful and extremely professional. He gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and even asked if we would like bread and butter instead of automatically bringing it. Because there have been times where we go and just want soup and salad. I appreciated that. When it was time to order, he kneeled down so he can be at our level and also read back our order to ensure it was correct. I like that he took that extra effort. It saves time and any grief if the order came back wrong. He refilled my drink without me having to wave him down. When I asked for salsa, he kindly stated what options they had and brought my choice immediately. He also asked if we'd like the dessert menu. We were actually very full so we didn't get dessert, (I know, you think we're nuts for not ordering dessert at Cheesecake Factory!) Overall we really enjoyed our dinner and it was actually really nice to have a great meal and be treated even better. Kudos!"
David P.,"Escondido, CA",0,29,,2.0,12/21/2016,"Got there about about 1PM.  Surprisingly got a table after only 35 minutes.   Got the Crusted Chicken Lunch special.  $14.  Was very hungry but no complimentary bread. Food (and bread) came out about 20 minutes later.  6oz Chicken was sliced thin and breaded with what tasted like Progesso Bread Crumbs.   Came with Pasta with some sort of Tomato sauce. Told me waitress it didnt taste good and she said that next time I could switch to Mashed Potatoes for no charge.  Did not finish food.   In general, service was not good.  No water refill.  No checking if the food was good.  No offer to replace food I didnt like. Milkshake tasted good but was $7.50. Hopefully I wont have to go back."
Fiona M.,"San Diego, CA",103,171,117,2.0,3/9/2014,"Ok, who designed this place and WHAT WERE THEY THINKING????  Dining out is something I do when I want to relax and spend quality time with my daughter. When I want to comfortably sit across a table and have a real conversation with my tween. When I don't want to have to stress about preparing the meal, serving the meal, and cleaning the meal. Summary...EATING OUT SHOULD BE RELAXING!  I am giving two stars for the decent food and the location staff who really tried to keep us happy with the ridiculous conditions they have to work with.  For example...Maximum capacity of the place is 300 people. 300 PEOPLE in one restaurant and here is what you have got... 1.) A  TINY WOMEN'S RESTROOM with only 3 stalls. Ummm...are you kidding me? The restroom is smaller than a standard storage unit! Plus, have they completely failed to consider the SUV sized strollers Mom's are driving these days? IDK how even ONE stroller is going to fit in this bathroom...was there even a changing table? Reflecting back, I don't recall seeing a changing table.  2.) ONE REGISTER. There is ONE REGISTER for the staff to work with. ONE REGISTER for 300 guests?  3.) VERY VERY VERY LIMITED seating for waiting guests. (I suppose they expect you to stroll the mall and wait for your, ""table ready"" text message.) Alas, have they not considered how bad the cellular reception is in the mall?  4.) THE PATIO. This was the icing on the cake. We waited 25 min to be seated in the blaring hot sun on the patio.All of the umbrellas and awnings were covering everything but the seating. (Of course the umbrellas were unable to be adjusted or moved.) We had to ask for extra napkins and a JUG of water because the table was too hot to touch and we needed constant hydration. After 10min my daughter had a sunburn, we were unable to rest our arms on the table and we had consumed the entire JUG of water.   MANAGEMENT! ARE YOU LISTENING? IT IS MARCH and TOO HOT FOR YOUR PATIO! Your restaurant is in ESCONDIDO! Come July, August and September, your patio is going to be useless unless you consider some better shade coverage and even cooling misters.  So, the staff really tried, the food was decent. I appreciated the SKINNY menu. BUT FOR GAWD SAKE...the entire set up is a MISERABLE. The stress of just BEING in that chaos defeats the purpose.  No thanks."
Jimmy J.,"El Cajon, CA",58,56,26,5.0,10/20/2016,"Had lunch with family here with my mom visiting. Had a pleasant service. Vicki S. Gave a wonderful excellent service. Friendly engaging and on the dot on refills. Supervisors and or manager were great as well, coming to our table was a good gesture and shows they care about giving the best and outmost great customers met service. Thank you! :)"
Carey S.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/18/2016,"Food was bland. We got fried zucchini and spiniest artichoke dip as an app. Zucchini was good but needed salt. Artichoke dip was more spinich than anything else. Also it came with salsa and sour cream which is a weird pairing. Our main course hubby got meatloaf and I got salmon and steak with mashed potatoes. There was like 2 pounds of potatoes, a sliver of salmon and three cubes of steak. Hubby's was huge but was so bland he literally dumped salt and pepper on it for flavor. We were at a tiny 2 person table and had a neighbor talking to us the whole meal. They were nice but it wasn't an intimate or private dinner. The service was ok but it took forever to get any food. Don't go if you are wanting privacy, good food, flavor or good service. Go for the desserts."
Rigo C.,"Escondido, CA",239,211,203,5.0,5/17/2015,"Came here on a Friday the day before Valentines day   around 3 with the girlfriend on a dinner date and we were seated immediately upon entering the establishment, WIN!  Server came over just as fast and was very courteous from the get-go. Very helpful and informative server, she explained to us what some of the things on the menu were as it was our first visit.  The food came pretty fast too, everything we got was delectable, no complaints whatsoever, server kept our drinks filled the entire time.  Everything about our visit was remarkable, completely surpassed my expectations due to the 3 star average it is getting here, can't wait to be back, hopefully my  future visits will be just as successful as our first."
