Tiffany M.,"San Marcos, CA",0,3,2,1.0,6/17/2017,"Worst customer service EVER! It took 45 minutes to get our APPETIZER!! And then when it came to us cold and gross tasting... our waiter WES said that's just how it's cooked and served... he didn't even OFFER to make things right... on top of all of that, the potato soup tasted like mold and the kale salad was so bland... they had ONE job... and it doesn't require much knowledge or a degree..."
Hannah C.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",90,63,94,5.0,4/23/2016,Visited here tonight and of course it was amazing!! Our hostess was so friendly and always checked on our table in a timely fashion. I tried the banana cheesecake tonight and it was absolutely delicious! Loved it!!
Craig M.,"Valley Center, CA",0,9,1,1.0,1/16/2016,Can I give zero stars? This is a favorite spot for our family. Usually always great food and service.  Tonight I have to give them a bad review for the missing slice in our to go pizza Not cool
Kirsten D.,"Tucson, AZ",188,368,846,2.0,1/18/2014,"Hate to say it, but this was not a pleasant experience AT ALL!   First off the place is a freaking zoo.  They have no sense of urgency at the ""check in"" line.  Nor did they seem very organized at the ""my buzzer buzzed and now I'm waiting for you people to seat me line.""  In addition this is probably the smallest Cheesecake Factory I've ever been in.  So, don't say I didn't warn you.   Because of the long wait, I was able to grab a high top table in the bar (thinking it would be a good spot/faster service)  That was my first mistake...My server was so bizarre.  She leisurely walked everywhere as if every step she took would cost her money.  She had zero sense of urgency.  When I asked for silverware (yes I had to ask) she said they only had 1 setting.  (so my friend should eat with her hands?)  She was quite friendly, but just didn't seem to grasp that she earns a living via tips.   Food arrived and I was served raw chicken in my meal.  The reason for 2 stars was that the manager did come over, apologize, make a joke and offered me something else.  He also comped that portion of the lunch, which I thought was a great gesture of service.  It's also the only reason I will go back and try the place one more time.   At that point I ordered a lunch pizza and salad, neither of which were memorable.   My friend ordered the Rene's special and she loved it.  Baked potato soup, chicken salad sandwich, and salad.   Of course we ordered a cheesecake and opted to split the Recee's peanut butter cup offering.  I can't believe I'm going to say this, but it honestly was lame.  It tasted like it had freezer burn or something.  I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory and not liked the cheesecake.  I don't know, maybe it wasn't their day.   I will give them one more shot because I feel like when restaurants are new they are trying to get the kinks out.  Also because the manager seemed to care about the patrons.  But this place better step it up if it wants any repeat business!"
Ellre V.,"San Diego, CA",136,173,211,3.0,1/31/2015,"CHEESECAKEEEEEEEEEEEE You can never go wrong with celebratory cheesecake, be it a birthday or just making it to Friday. I'm very glad they opened up this closer, alternative location in North County Fair Mall. Depending on the time, however, it can get just as busy as Fashion Valley. I most recently dined here yesterday on a Friday for Happy Hour at 4pm (there was no wait!). We were a little early (waiters can't put in Happy Hour orders until 4pm because it doesn't pop up on their register until then), so we decided to order a slice of cheesecake first. Our kind waitress also suggested ordering off the small plates and appetizers options from the regular menu because some items are equivalent to Happy Hour prices anyways. I decided upon the Beets with Goat Cheese small salad (beets, apples, baby arugula, pecans and vinaigrette). Delicious and fresh-tasting, I'd definitely order this again and would suggest it to anyone who's looking for a light and savory dish. Also opted for trying the avocado eggrolls, mehhhhhh. For 620 calories (also listed as 960 calories on the internet), it wasn't worth the calorie intake. I love avocado, but not warm or stuffed in a fried eggroll wrapper. Service here is always pleasant and quick. Our waitress brought our check out promptly when we asked and returned our credit card right away. Something I appreciated that ended our visit on a good note."
Traci P.,"Oceanside, CA",1,13,1,1.0,6/12/2017,"Came here last night for my birthday. Went in to check on wait times. Was told it's a 20 minute wait and there were a couple parties ahead of us. Fine no problem. We sit to wait, 20 minutes pass then 30 now 40 minutes. All the while parties of 3 and 4 are coming in AFTER us and being seated right away. I go up to ask and the guy goes oh they misquoted your wait time it's more like an hour I said that's not acceptable, I was told 20 minutes and it's now been 40 and to top it off they are sitting people who came in after me parties as big as mine. No explanation from him not even a sorry we will get you seated right away. Nothing! I left and went across to macaroni grill. Thanks for ruining my birthday cheese cake factory"
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2232,1937,4290,4.0,12/18/2013,"Husband and I were shopping for Christmas presents for our lovely kids after work on Friday. After about two hours of shopping, we got hungry and wanted to have a sit down place to eat and not at the food court. It was either this place or BJ's so we came here. It's been awhile since we've been to the Cheesecake Factory (usually go to the one in Fashion Valley) and we're usually not very happy with the service or the food but decided to give this place a try (again).  We put our names in and they said it was a half hour wait, so they offered to text us when our table was ready. We went off wandering in the stores and got a text just like they said and were seated immediately. VERY COOL!  It was Friday and we were in the mood to drink so I got the pomegranate margarita (blended) and my husband got the margarita on the rocks. They were huge! They were served in large glasses but that was why it was $14 for one drink.  To start, we ordered the crab cakes for appetizers and that was really good. Better than I expected.  They were out of my usual chicken and biscuits so I ended up getting the fried chicken salad served on kale, yay! I love kale! My husband got the cuban sandwich with the sweet potato fries. There were a lot of food on our plates, not to mention between the bread and the crab cakes for appetizers, we were getting pretty full. So we opted to pack the rest of our food to go and ordered cheesecake to go as well. I got the mango key lime cheesecake and my husband got the caramel turtle cheesecake. We decided to enjoy it later that night while watching a movie at home.  Service was great and the food was great. It goes to show you that not all chains are the exact same experience. I was upset that they were out of the chicken and biscuits when it was only 6pm, but I have to give this place credit, much better experience than the one in Fashion Valley."
Joyce D.,"Valley Center, CA",85,170,246,5.0,2/8/2015,"I recently went here for lunch and I was really impressed by the service. Linda was our server for the day. She was really attentive and made sure everything was ok. She set out a serving spoon, looked at it and saw it was dirty, so she brought out a new one. I know of so many places where we have to tell the server something is dirty.  At at the end of the meal, she brought us hot towels.  As for the food, it was really good. For appetizers, I shared thai lettuce wraps and fire roasted artichoke with 3 other people. The lettuce wraps were delicious. It gives you enough to make 5 or 6 wraps with chicken. There are 3 different sauces to make the wraps. The artichokes were ok. Too much effort to eat just a small amount. I probably wouldn't get it again.  I shared the fettucini Alfredo with chicken with my husband. The lunch portion was enough for us to share.  Restaurants can either make fettucini Alfredo really good or really bad. It is really good here!  It is so creamy and flavorful.  For dessert, we shared the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. I'm not a big cheesecake person but it was pretty good. Lots of nuts.  I'll definitely come back and hope that the service will be like this recent trip."
D P.,"San Diego, CA",60,131,80,2.0,12/22/2015,"Everything was great when we arrived. We were greeted and given a ""wait time of 15 minutes"". It didn't look very crowded and we were given our table w/in 19 minutes, so it was ok. As SOON as we sat down I noticed that our table was a little dirty. Then our waitress came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. Didn't give us any recommendations so we just had water.... This is where everything took a turn down. Our waitress kept coming back every 2 minutes asking us what we wanted, like she was rushing us! I understand you want your table so you can make money on your tips, but geez.... We ordered our appetizer and not but 5 minuets later our entree's came out.I absolutely hate that! Needless to say I had to pack up the appetizer to go (which taste gross heated up later) We got our entrees, which were luke warm and not very appetizing. He has Jamaican Pepper Shrimp and I have the Chicken Madeira, NOT CHEAP! She came back ONCE to ask us if it was ok, but I had to keep getting someone to fill up my water!!! Next was our desert. Again, she didn't recommend anything. I ordered the Warm Apple Crisp and as sooon as I said that she walked away and said let me get that started b/c it takes a while. We weren't done ordering. So she came back w/ my apple crisp that looked like nothing but whipped cream and 2 pieces of cheesecake to go. THE PIECES WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIZES. My guy asked if his was a kids size b/c it was so small, and she went into explaining to us... The cakes are pre-made, pre-cut and delivered to the restaurant...wow! I thought they were fresh..NOPE! So how old are they really? Just not impressed, I felt rushed, the food wasn't HOT, I kept having to ask for water and the portion amount of the pieces of pie were so tiny!"
Carmen V.,"San Jose, CA",1507,2390,10401,3.0,11/26/2013,"From an inauguration day you would expect at least some free samples and an abundance of smiles...In lieu of that, what I got was a long line, a 45 minute wait, some attitude like 'don't bother too much as there are too many others'. When I asked about the samples the lady at the entrance said that she did not know if they were giving or no. Hum, already a bad first impression. I have been waiting and monitoring the inauguration day and escaped from work during lunch break to take a look and eat something. I could not wait that long and was disappointed with the lack of generosity toward new customers (I love their food at least from other locations).  Other than not being impressed by the customer service, I was really happy to see this new addendum to the North County mall, prime location, all new, pretty, shiny. Cakes look awesome and the restaurant look big yet not massive. I will comment another day about the food. And please, do not promote yourselves that much on the Facebook page about the inauguration day when you don't even have a little something to give (or maybe was for the 5 first customers or so?)."
Beth C.,"Villa Park, CA",9,1,,2.0,5/20/2017,"We drive down from Orange County once a month to visit my mom and take her out to dinner and run errands. We decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory last time. Well - Sunday late afternoon/early evening was busy as expected. We waited 20-30 minutes as expected. We were seated and after a few minutes our waitress came over. She spoke to us in a condescending manner - ""Honey"". Next we were ready to order and I asked for the Artichoke Hearts - she bruskly told me that artichokes are out of season. (I had 3 in my refrigerator that day) My mother ordered the Salmon and she looked at her with a question mark. We had to look up the one we wanted with no assistance from her. Mom asked for the fish to be cooked lightly but not raw. The waitress said she could order it rare but then it would be raw in the Center. Then I asked if my mom could get a side order of Gluten Free Pasta. She said there was no way for her to request that from the kitchen. ""If it's not in the computer I can't order it.""  I've waited tables before - this woman was a moron and lazy.  To top it all off, our salads arrived and right behind (literally) were our entrees. By the time we ate the salad the entrees were cold. Oh - the fish was overcooked too. Big Surprise.  I won't come back - she was horrible and no manager anywhere to be found."
D G.,"San Diego, CA",0,47,46,5.0,10/22/2016,Not much to say here. We all know the menu and the delicious cheesecake. This is my local(closest Cheesecake) and the customer service and food is always great. No complaints here. I recommend the chicken Parmesan sandwich or the garlic noodles with chicken and The fried zucchini. Cheesecake wise the banana is where it's at. Also the mango keylime amazing as is the vanilla bean cheesecake.
Roland C.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,16,5.0,5/13/2017,Have been to this location multiple times... never had any problems with service or friendliness of staff.. most of the people complaining about the wait are not aware of the nature of this restaurant in that it can get crazy busy... a little patience goes a long way.. food has always been delicious particularly the steak Diane and hangar steak ..
Jen E.,"Orange, CA",110,376,100,3.0,3/29/2015,"It's only fair that I admit that I've lost my love for Cheesecake Factory as a chain over the last few years.  As they added more locations, the food quality has seemed to slip a little. That being said, my kids still love it and this is a nice location.  Probably the best food you'll find at North County Fair (or Westfield North County, whatever).  It's also a good spot on nice days because they have patio seating. On most visits, we've had good service.  Never great, but good -- and always a little slower than I'd like. But I get it. They are also fiercely crowded.  The last visit, however, our waitperson, Taylor would go MIA for half-hours at a time.  What should have been a simple lunch took TWO hours -- the last 40 minutes being an attempt to get our check and then pay and have it returned. No one seemed too alarmed by this.  The couple at the next table waited 20 minutes to have their order taken by another server.      But like I said, out of the choices in and around the mall, this is your best bet.  Oh & split your meals -- even the lunch portions could feed 3 people easily."
Ashley P.,"Escondido, CA",2,40,3,5.0,11/7/2016,They seated us very quick. They took our order we had such an awesome waiter he was so nice and gave us such great service all of our food was AMAZINGGGG and super fresh. It was a great experience and definitely will be returning ! Highly recommended restaurant.
Olga S.,"La Jolla, CA",0,13,,5.0,11/6/2016,"Really like this place. Every time we come in here we enjoy great customer service and good quality food,  good selection on the bar, and of course yummy cheese cakes. Nice place to get together with your friends and family."
Phantom Era ..,"San Diego, CA",71,55,38,2.0,12/13/2014,"Atmosphere:As always well decorated. Since it was a night time visit during the winter, they play Christmas music. However it is extremely loud on the weekends so the music is very muffled. Food: For an appetizer, I got the fire cracker salmon. It was truly delicious & I give my compliments to the chef.  The cheesecake is always amazing as well I love the lemon meringue! Not to be a downer or anything! But the veggie burger was horrendous. Bland with no taste & mostly bread. The sweet potatoes fries kind of made up for it... Sort of....  Service: I came in only wearing a shirt & they sat me outside which is pure craziness. I mean it's common sense! It's freezing!!! The staff was very unhelpful & quite rude. In general they were resistant to help, all the way from the hostess to the front desk.  However the manager did fix the situation. Cheers to him.  Sidenote: my soap pump in the bathroom didn't work, & the floor is dangerously slippery. Overall: From the food to the overall service, this was not a pleasant visit especially deign the holiday seasons. Oh well, you can't win them all! Cheers!"
Michael G.,"San Marcos, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/6/2017,First and last time at this chain.  Wife and I were enjoying ourselves.  We split a Chinese Chicken salad and a chicken sandwich.   About halfway through my wife pulled a super long hair out of a mouthful of salad she had taken.   Gross!!  The manager came and apologized and brought us another salad but needless to say we could not enjoy it.  They didn't even take the salad off of our ticket.  Just a bad experience.
Cullen C.,"Oceanside, CA",189,20,,2.0,1/31/2016,"Well I was really excited to try CF because I had heard really good things about it. My wife and I were seated promptly after and greeted by a kind waitress who took our order for a Tater Tot appetizer and drinks. The server and kitchen had my food out in roughly 15 minutes and we started eating. But then it happened... Toward the end of the appetizer my wife noticed a large piece of squid inside one of the fried potatoes. My wife politely let Amanda know there was a sea creature in the tater tots. Out appetites were shot and we chose to leave.  We were charge full price for everything and I still tipped the waitress because it's not her fault. Now, I'm not the type to make a scene but I expected some kind of explanation as to how a beast from the depths ended up at my table but there was nothing of the sort. We left disappointed. 2 stars because the service wasn't terrible."
Sarah M.,"Escondido, CA",50,119,236,1.0,10/24/2015,"Food is good here, drinks are pretty good too. But I have to say, every time I go here the service is slow. Good thing bread is left at the table to munch on. On my most recent visit, just to buy a gift card, I waited in line for at least 15-20 minutes. I have no idea what took so long, but it was terribly frustrating. -------11/14/15 UPDATE ---------- APPARENTLY, the $50 gift card I purchased had $0 on it. My mom and stepdad went out to dinner the other night and was told that the gift card had nothing loaded into it. After waiting in line and also receiving a receipt, how was I supposed to know nothing was loaded on the card I was given? Thankfully, the manager or whoever was working with my mom that evening provided them with a $50 comp card but my stepdad still paid for their meal that night. So very disappointed with this store's service. BIG THUMBS DOWN. Downgraded to 1 star."
