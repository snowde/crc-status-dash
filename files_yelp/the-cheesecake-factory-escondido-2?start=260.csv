Michael T.,"Murrieta, CA",1,24,72,5.0,12/21/2015,"It's CheeseCake Factory. Wow, I've never felt so full in my life! Tomorrow, the 22nd is my birthday, and my family decided to go here for a celebration. I ordered a Chicken and Scampi pasta, very delicious! We also ordered a small slice of Fresh Strawbery Cheese cake. 5 stars for fast service and happy birthday wish!"
Darline D.,"Escondido, CA",393,205,595,3.0,1/13/2014,"I went again with my boyfriend on Thurs Jan 9th just to test out the waters if they have since made up for our horrible service last time I made a review. We went on a Thursday night where it wasn't so busy but there was still a wait of 50mins, as we were told by the guy who was adding us to the wait list. He asked us if we preferred sitting inside, outside, or had no preference and the boyfriend said ""inside because last time we were outside it was pretty bad"". Haha! I'm pretty sure that stung a little for the host (maybe he saw the yelp reviews?). So we gave him one of our cell phone numbers and proceeded to walk around and window shop in the mall. Not even 30mins of waiting time and we already got our text to come back and get seated. Wow! We walked back to Cheesecake Factory and was seated almost instantly. Chris E., according to our bill, was our server and man was it a breath of fresh air. We had EXCELLENT service! Once we were seated we were able to get our drinks and appetizer (no bread if we order an appetizer?) within about 15mins which is pretty fast. Our sever came back numerous times and was really attentive. Food of course was still delicious. I gotta hand it to the chefs inside for always bringing out quality food in a quick and timely fashion. The bartender was also pretty good that night making our three drinks (boyfriend's 2nd mojito was definitely amped up a little on the rum and was a nice addition). Got our bill, gave our server a hefty tip (unlike our last time...) and was out there in no time rubbing our full bellies and strolling to the car. Thank you for a better service!  I only added 1 more star because I feel that service can be a hit or miss depending on how busy the place gets, and maybe on who serves you. If I had excellent service all the time I'd totally give my 4.5 stars but because of the ranging service I'm giving this place 3-ish stars. You're better off getting here on a non-peak day to get great service....and maybe also better than you sit inside. Ha!"
Christina M.,"Anchorage, AK",42,75,329,5.0,2/14/2016,"Good service, smaller so the wait isn't so bad and you have a mall attached that you can burn time in while waiting.  Oh, almost forgot, the food is amazing!  Everything on the menu is good! You can't go wrong."
Jessica A.,"San Diego, CA",75,95,279,1.0,8/29/2016,"My review is long overdue . I have been coming to this location for years. We usually dine in , and I always order the same pasta. Me and my husband decided to order to some food Togo . I called in the order , Louisiana pasta for me and hubby to share and kids salmon for our son. When we got home super hungry and excited to eat , put pasta was not cooked al the way , to the point it was not eatable :(!!!  My sons food was fine . I called to speak to the manager and that's where I got really frustrated !!! I got transferred to one manager ( guy who's name I don't Remember , he asked to read my receipt to him at least 5 times , it seemed like he couldn't locate my order, then I got transferred again and went through the same process then got put on long hold only to be told that they will do feather research and call me back next day !!??? I was shocked , I was not offered to get new order of cooked pasta that I could literally have my husband run across the street and pick up . Guess what !!??? It's been over a week and I am still waiting for that call back . It's very disappointing when you pay for dinner you can't even eat ."
Fan C.,"Carlsbad, CA",64,10,6,3.0,8/27/2016,The Very Spicy Cashew Chicken was way too salty for my taste. The chicken was slightly fried which I didn't expect. I think the black pepper made it spicy. It was so salty I took less than 10 bites and had to quit. The Sheila's Chicken and Avocado salad was light and tasty. The server was friendly and pleasant.
Veronica C.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Their ""manager"" Brian is RUDE! Definitely not customer friendly place, they lost not only my business but the business of our entire office staff. We were going to go to celebrate Secretary's Day but Brian's harsh attitude and disinterest had us choosing somewhere else to go. Brian stated they don't take reservations but apparently on their site it says that they do.  Again, just shows Brian's incompetence."
Ivan B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Decided to go here on Saturday Sept 2nd for my spouses birthday. Waited 20 minutes to be seated and waited about 5 min to get our order taken. The table that was seated next to us was really upset that his table was dirty and he was seated at the same time we were seated. Our server took our drink order and left to input that into the computer  system. I proceed to follow her and tell her that it was my spouses birthday and if she could put happy birthday on her dessert plate and she told me yes and even told me it would be on the house (choice of cheesecake or a different dessert). I returned to my seat and a few minutes later the server returned with a different server and told us they are changing shifts and the new server would be taking care of us. New server stated that she got the drink order but didn't say the special desert order but I wasn't worried because I thought she didn't want to state that in front of my spouse. Spouse ordered chicken Alfredo, it had so much Alfredo sauce it looked like soup. She had to pour some out. Once dessert time came , we ordered the celebration cheesecake! She dropped off the desert and check at the same time , I was so upset that she didn't write nothing. After I explicitly told the previous server to write happy birthday!  We were still charged for the cheesecake. Extremely disappointed, will not be going back to this establishment anytime soon. The servers sang happy birthday to a different customer five minutes before we ordered dessert ! Overall bad service to my table and the table next to us!"
Matthew M.,"Fallbrook, CA",84,1,,2.0,11/14/2015,There was a line from the host stand to the entrance while one of the hostesses helped one group of customers for about 8 minutes.  Cant say for sure what all that was about. I'm sure it was important though. Luckily there were two seats at the bar which my wife was happy about because the bartender looked like a damn Calvin Klein model. So much for date night.  The food was 'ehh'. Entirely too much radicchio in the greens mix and the celery that came with our 'buffalo chicken blasts' looked like they were the scraps that you typically remove from the stalk before serving.  Like the end with all shriveled tips and leaves... wtf? What kind of name is Buffalo Chicken Blasts anyway? I thought I was reading the kids menu. The tempura battered fish tacos were somewhat confusing. I've eaten quite a few  tacos over the years and... let's just say these tacos were upside down. I'm not sure if I liked the pickled onions but they make sense I suppose.  Overall the service was ok. Nothing spectacular. Although my wife probably feels otherwise. Most everybody there seemed to be content with there experience. Maybe I'm just an asshole.
Erin B.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,69,18,4.0,2/15/2016,"Food is always good. I had the Greek salad and crab cake bites this time. But dirty glasses and silverware. Not cool.  I do need to compliment the service though. The hostess and My server Bryce was spot on! The bartender, food runners, and hostesses were all top-notch. And I watched them with everyone. They were equally great to each and every guest. Patient, using great service verbiage and body language.i was really impressed since it's hard to find good service these days."
Nicole A.,"Vista, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/28/2016,"By far the worst experience I've had here. I brought my mom around 2pm today for a nice lunch. Waited TEN minutes to be acknowledged by our server, Tyson. (It takes 5 seconds to stop by the table and let your customers know you're busy and you'll be with them as soon as possible) We ordered two waters, she dropped them off in a hurry, spilling ice all over the table, and ran off before we could ask for straws or napkins. Then when she comes back she literally rips the napkin off my mother's drink to pick up the ice....I've never seen anything like it. So inappropriate. Finally, we get a new server, Alyssa. I guess she was on her break. She brings a basket of bread which were cold and rock hard. When I asked for a fresh basket, she paused and said, ""Umm ya maybe, I have to check if we have any and if we don't it will probably be like 5-10 minutes.""  Maybe I'm being whiny, but I work in the service industry and I know how to treat/speak to customers and this is NOT the right way! It's one thing if it was just me, but I brought my mother, expecting to treat her to a nice lunch. We felt SO uncomfortable there.  Thankfully, the food is always great but I will not be coming back to this location any time soon. Maybe have your servers take a lesson on proper customer service."
Jeffrey W.,"Newport Beach, CA",165,14,1,3.0,2/28/2017,"This is by far one of the most frustrating places I have been. We were told an half hour wait and when we asked for an update the front was very rude., stating, ""you're 17 minutes into your 30 minute time quote."" Forty- five minutes later, an hour from our start time we still had not been sat. After complaining, we kept being told that our table was being cleaned., over and over again.... finally asked to speak to a manager, and low and behold it was the hostess that had first been snippy with us. She proceeded to roll her eyes and explain that the restaurant was very busy, yada, yada, yada.  It was an explanation out of frustration not an apology.  Did I mention, it was almost 8pm and we had two hungry kids in tow. We finally got sat and didn't see a waiter for five minutes. Finally another manager walked and we grabbed him. He was the only reason for the 3 stars. David listened and took care of us. He was the saving grace of what was a horrible night. If you deal with this please ask for him. He was awesome, and saved our night."
Nancy P.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,,2.0,9/24/2016,"service was good;no drink prices on menu hence we got $11 glasses of sangria, which is just nuts! California cheesesteak was so salty my husband only had one bite;we won't be back"
JC L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",14,11,5,3.0,4/8/2015,"3.5, most stars (2think 2/3) for service as the coulotte steak (3/3) is just amazeballs (if you get it medium that is). Don't get the house cab if you actually like drinking wine which in any case does pair well with the steak (cab in general).  Cons: Bread arrived cold (can't butter it up) small, can't butter either. Fries go cold almost immediately. It's like they microwaved the fries and onion rings before cooking the Steak. Steak looks dry from the outside but the insides are all gravy (juicy). Ymmv if you get it over medium.  Tiramisu is better than tiramisu latte from Starbucks. Believe it or not, it's tastes pretty accurate (tiramisu latte). Not that I expected it to be any worst than a drink, but not being worst is a start."
Yoshitaka F.,"Poway, CA",5,27,7,5.0,7/16/2016,I like this location has great waitresses and waiters who make sure you have a great dining experience. They do what it takes to make sure your dining experience there is great and you want to come back. The steak Diane is delicious and very filling. The only thing I want whenever we come here.
Iran G.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/16/2017,"Went and had dinner with my husband and kids. Service was good, but the cooks take too long. My husband ordered chicken with mash potatoes and asparagus, it was good but not $19.95 worth. I ordered the tacos w out onions and tomatoes, I was hesitant to send it back since it took a while to get our food, I still did, I ended up canceling my order. They offered me soup in the mean time, which was nice. For my daughter we ordered off the kids menu, pasta with cream sauce,  she also wanted chicken, it was only like four chunk pieces. When we got the bill we realized they charged us $11.45, they doubled the amount on the kids meal. Usually when you order chicken you expect to pay a couple of dollars more not $6. Might as well ordered off the regular menu. This is our second time to this location and not happy!"
Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,819,2.0,8/24/2014,"The quick of it: Food is good by Cheesecake Factory standards.  The downside is that this is the inner circle of hell where service goes to die a slow and tortured death. -------------- Sum-up of our almost 2-hour sojourn here at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner: Waiter: ""Would you folks like to order dessert?"" Me: ""Do we look like we have fucking time left for that!?!"" -------------- Excited for a new location closer to us than Fashion Valley, we made a trip from the coast for a night out shopping and dining.  Got there around 5:00pm with a hungry toddler and found the restaurant busy, but not packed, and only a 20 minute wait to be seated inside or out on the patio immediately.  We chose the latter so our son could eat quicker and asked for a high chair. Walking out into the oubliette ... whoop, patio, I meant to say patio, we were greeted with the warm sun on our faces, blinding low in the summer sky, and found that our table not only had no way of shielding us from this glaring brilliance that blazed like the unblinking eye of Ra, but also that no one bothered to bring a high chair.  After pointing this out, we were offered a booster seat ... for a squirmy 18 month old ... apparently they were loathe to move the umbrella that was covering nothing to make room.  We forced them to anyway and I sat down leaning forward to keep the sun out of his eyes. After 10 minutes and three other servers wandering by without paying any heed, we finally met our own waiter, a well meaning guy that was happy to take our drink orders.  Then we sat there, sun glaring down, my girlfriend slowly developing a nice burn, yet thankful for the cool wind blowing.  We quickly knew what we wanted to order, but were left to our own devices for a good 15 minutes. Then our drinks arrived!  And they were nice enough to bring bread!  As my son dove into the hard sourdough like a Gitmo prisoner coming off a hunger strike, our waiter asked if we wanted any appetizers to start.  Even the toddler stopped and gave him a look of incredulity.  Very patiently and nicely, we mentioned that we were actually ready to fully order, which we did.  But we were then left to stare at our drinks after he left because, even though we had asked initially, we were brought no Sweet 'n Low for our tea and no lemon for our water. We asked again, we sat ignored for a while again, we finished the bread, we eventually got our zucchini appetizer and a bowl of lemons with sugar after another 15-20 minutes of elapsed time. -------------- Excerpts from ""Dialogue of a Cheesecake Factory Waiter"", Escondido Edition: Waiter: ""Let me bring you more bread while you wait."" *Waiter leaves* *15 MINUTE INTERMISSION* *Waiter returns empty handed* Waiter: ""Would you like more bread while you wait?"" *Pause for laughter as the family stares in shock* -------------- We did get that second basket of bread, along with our food, over an hour after we first arrived.  My girlfriend did not have her tea refilled until about halfway through the meal, quite rough considering they just left us in the sun to sweat.  I was okay with my water, but only because I was able to steal the glasses of everyone else at the table.  And the food was good, standard Cheesecake Factory fare as I noted above. But, holy shit was that service bad.  We once watched our waiter come out to the patio, stand in front of a computer, and work on it for a good 8-10 minutes before going back inside ... while leaving a tray on top of it with someone else's ice tea and our bowl of lemon slices on it.  And there they sat in the sun for a few more minutes before he came back out and took care of it all. We also witnessed two other servers sitting down at an empty table and talking for 15 minutes.  I was under the impression that it was a manager telling a new girl what a good job she was doing ... you know, because ... IRONY! -------------- Selected scenes from ""A Night at The Cheesecake Factory,"" or ""Send in the Clowns!"" Waiter: ""Here is the coke for your son."" Me: ""We didn't order that .. he's only 18 months old!"" Waiter: ""He doesn't like soda?"" -------------- So, about 2 hours later we finally gave up on our guy and flagged down another server for to-go boxes and the check.  Our waiter was nice enough to say that he WOULD have put our leftovers into boxes for us if he had the chance to do so, but who has that kind of time? After assuming that we would be done in about an hour and have some time left for shopping after, we ended up with just a 40 minute sprint through the mall to check out stores we really wanted to see and then leave to get our son down for bed in good time. Thank you Cheesecake Factory ... you have soured North County Mall for us forever.  We could have come back to adopt a puppy from their pet store, but now that puppy will go unloved ... all because of your horrible service. Kudos."
Daniel L.,"San Diego, CA",76,22,24,2.0,2/13/2017,"Went there on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm. My wife and I ordered an appetizer and a pasta entry. Waited for 30 mins for our appetizer and bread to arrive, and another 30 mins for the pasta to come. We were planning only to sit or a quick afternoon tea and snack after shopping, we order just the two items to share, but it took forever for the food and we ended up so hungry and finished the items within 15 mins.  Total time there was about 1.5 hrs with almost an hour waiting and 15 mins eating. Not the usual pleasant experience I have at The Chesse cake factory"
Miguel R.,"Escondido, CA",15,3,,5.0,10/7/2016,Forget about the cake... Coktails are amazing!!! Best place in town to enjoy a good coktail with Snacks. I usually order the modern old fashion and my wife the pear martini!
Jubei M.,"Vista, CA",4,14,367,5.0,6/24/2016,"Not many chain restaurants have consistency in their dishes, but no matter which Cheesecake Factory I visit, my Chicken Madeira is always spot on! I frequent the Escondido or Fashion Valley locations the most."
Sarah J.,"San Francisco, CA",272,5,,3.0,3/7/2016,"I usually get different types of pasta every time I come here, and I have to say that if it wasn't for the food, I would not want to come back to this particular Cheesecake Factory. I don't know if I came on an off day or what, but the hostess completely forgot about me. My buzzer rang, but I stood on the side of cashier for like 30 min. All the people who came after me were getting seated and every time I tried to say something, the hostess would dash off so fast."
