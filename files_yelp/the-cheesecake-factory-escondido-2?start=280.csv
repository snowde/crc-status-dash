Shiva A.,"Poway, CA",404,28,20,1.0,6/16/2016,"The service here has been really poor lately. We've been here for 30 minutes and all we have is water. The last few times I've been here I've been told that they don't have all the ingredients to make the meal. If you're starving, don't come here."
Victoria R.,"Oceanside, CA",512,262,346,5.0,9/3/2015,LOOVEE coming to this restaurant! the menu is very big so be prepared!! Honestly everything I have ordered has been yummy! I just recently got to try there new menu they were testing out and I loved the new falafel kale salad!! I will be back to have it again! Service is always great but sometimes a wait to get a table. But don't worry you can walk around the mall to pass time and they will text you to tell you your table is ready!! How great is that!! And of course you can't leave this place without a slice of cheesecake:)
Michael M.,"Chula Vista, CA",301,64,51,5.0,9/4/2016,"The food was great for the most part. We had a little glitch (our steam rice wasn't fully steamed), but so glad we had a very efficient server who got us a new bowl. Destiny W. did a great job, she was super friendly, easy to communicate with. She was fast at getting us accommodated with additional request."
Rothy C.,"San Diego, CA",45,132,57,1.0,8/25/2015,They discontinued the upside down pineapple cheesecake.  Booooooooo! Why couldn't you guys discontinue one of your gross peanut butter cheesecakes? Peanut butter in a cheese cake is disgusting.
Kelsey J.,"Oceanside, CA",98,70,80,3.0,1/11/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is always crazy busy! I'm sure that's because it's in a mall. The Chicken Madeira is my favorite dish here. It's super moist (hate that word but it truly is!) and comes with grilled asparagus and creamy mashed potatoes. When ever I come with my family we get the avocado egg rolls and if you like avocados you must try them, they are truly the best I have ever had.   The service here is why I feel this is a three star location. It is always busy and it seems most waitress/waiters have too many tables at once. I find it difficult to get my waiters attention if I need anything. They also do not take reservations or do call ahead seating so if you come on a weekend or busy night you will be waiting at least an hour if not longer. It is nice that they text you when your table is ready so you can get some shopping done while you wait. Always put your name in first and then shop, you will have plenty of time."
Ariana P.,"Carlsbad, CA",109,36,12,1.0,8/4/2015,"Normally, I like this place. They have good food, but they have the worst service. My friend and I came here to pick up some cheesecake and walked up to there cheesecake counter. There was no line, simply a group of female servers surrounding the counter counting their tips. I got zero acknowledgement and had to ask the hostess where I can order a slice of cheesecake.  I understand people want to hurry and go home close to the end of the night, but there should certainly be another place and time to count tips and do your closing. I can see why this place has 3 stars though. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location. I prefer to drive 30 minutes to Orange County or the Fashion Valley location. Don't bring your business here because they don't care about your business either."
Kaye T.,"San Diego, CA",0,34,13,5.0,7/15/2016,"Showed up at noon, although during Friday lunch - we were seated very quickly! They were out of several pasta sauces that we wanted (short a cook) and instead of having us pick something else - they made it especially for the order!! How awesome is that!! That tells you that they make sauce fresh! It's not shipped over by the truckload and heated up. Now that's great customer service! Server (Brittany) was also amazing, great attitude, fast service, extremely attentive. Definitely coming back! And WILL ask for her section specifically. C.Factory is lucky to have her on their team."
Susan M.,"Temecula, CA",20,161,692,5.0,10/6/2015,"Came with a friend. I've never been to this location. We were very impressed. It's beautiful inside. Awesome service, fantastic food, large portions  ....clean bathroom. Hey don't laugh, clean bathroom says a lot especially a restaurant. Hey you have a whole mall for parking. Handicap parking close to the door.   Perfect place...we couldn't find anything wrong.  See you there."
Michael R.,"Vista, CA",117,12,5,5.0,3/20/2016,"Great service and excellent food.   My favorite is the Bacon, bacon burger.   My girlfriend come here twice a year and they do not disappointe."
Kelly P.,"Wildomar, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/21/2017,"I brought a team here from work as a thank-you for giving up their vacation day to train with me.  We were so disappointed!  We talked about Cheesecake Factory for a week and were so excited.  We ordered at 12:25pm and at 1:15 we were still waiting for our lunch.  We spent almost 2 hours there for lunch.  When the food did arrive, it was very bland but we didn't send it back because we did not have time to wait for new food.  We paid our tab of almost 200.00, tipped 20% because the server was not at fault, and left.  Bummer."
Heather S.,"San Diego, CA",69,196,42,4.0,12/6/2014,"My fiancé and I went here last night for dinner and dessert. It's so nice to have the Cheesecake Factory up in north county. He decor is very nice and so is the outside seating. Our waiter was Corey and he was excellent - very welcoming and on top of it. I had the red sangria last night which was so yummy, and the pear salad. My salad was supposed to have more walnuts and blue cheese and when I asked Corey for more he got it right away. It was a pretty good salad. My fiancé got a sandwich and fries and liked it a lot.  The best parts were our shared slice of cheesecake (snickers - yum!!) and the service. Thanks Corey!"
Ash A.,"Murrieta, CA",0,6,1,2.0,9/11/2016,I ordered orange chicken for 17 bucks and I expected better. The orange chicken tasted like medicine and I only got like a spoon of rice to feast on. left disappointed. The only reason I left 2 stars is because the interior was nice
Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",992,1005,3062,4.0,7/5/2014,"I'm a fan of cheesecake factory. It doesn't have unique culinary flare to it, but it is a good place to go. The menu is so large that you will please everyone in your group. However, it can sometimes be overwhelming with too many choices. Lately, I've been ordered the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger and it is super good. I devour it and lick my plate haha. JK about the licking part.  The waiters at this location have always been friendly. My only complaint is that the bread seems to always come out late at this location. I've been here a few times and they have always said that they just ran out and they are cooking a new batch. So, maybe it was just bad timing, but come people... the bread is so important.. there should be constantly new batches! haha. I know working in the restaurant industry isn't easy, so I understand.  The outdoor seating at this location is nice. The seats and comfortable with nice cushions. The view looks out over the parking lot.  I also love that they have always brought my baby (16 month old) out a plate on the house that has bread and fruit. So, she can feel like she has an appetizer of her own haha."
Rebecca T.,"Carlsbad, CA",664,802,3586,4.0,7/24/2014,"Oh wow, finally go to try this new location. I always know what I like from cheesecake factory so the menu itself is not too exciting. However, the decor in the restaurant is so nice! One Saturday night, we came here at 10pm to avoid the crowds. (You still need to wait even if you come at 8pm, so that's why we wait till close to 10 to come. They close at midnight anyway.) We were happy to have the choice of outdoor seating and of course we did that! I kid you not, I feel like I'm dining at a 5-star hotel. Their outdoor furniture was classy and comfortable - some cushioned wicker booths. The dining table was probably made of plastic.. hard plastic... but it's carved! The torch heaters are such nice addition to the ambiance. They are hot in both temperature and appearance. On top of that, they make the back wall of the bar inside all glass, so we can see bottles of liquor with colorful lights from the outdoor seating area. What a nice hangout / date place! Well about the food. We got the yummy avocado egg rolls, pasta da vinci and the salmon and steak plate. We love all the dishes, and were particularly surprised at how well they made the salmon and the steak. The salmon was perfectly flavored and crusted, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. The juicy and tender steak, with a delectable wine reduction sauce of some sort, definitely satisfied our palates.  Service was awesome too! The lady who served us was friendly, polite and sensible, in a way that she doesn't over-check on us. We concluded our meal with the Godiva cheesecake, big enough to share between the two of us. It's rich, creamy, decadent and chocolaty. Best of all, it's the only flourless cake on the menu! It's good, but I don't think I'll order it again. I'd rather try something else next time. Plus I've had better flourless chocolate cake elsewhere and eating this just kept reminding me of the other cake in the other restaurant... hm... Anyhow, we will certainly be back! Probably around the same late night time to avoid the crowds!"
Sean H.,"Vista, CA",21,53,122,4.0,8/26/2015,The Oreo cheesecake is so good. It is big enough to share but so good you don't want to. The service was perfect. Will for sure come back again for cheesecake because there is no place better.
Chelsea E.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/10/2016,"The food here is good, though over priced for the quality. The atmosphere is nice.  My biggest complaint would be, the past 2 times I have gone, they have gotten my order wrong. I always order the lunch pizza and the side salad cause it's a good deal. The first time I ordered this they put pepperoni on it instead of peppers. They remade it, but it took so long everyone I was with had already finished their meals. The second time I ordered this, I again, ordered the pizza with peppers and side salad. I took the first bite to a mouth on fire because they had put jalapeños on it instead of the red peppers I asked for (I figured they had put bell peppers on) so I had them remake it again and pack it up to go because, again, it took forever to remake."
Andy C.,"Carlsbad, CA",193,1233,3341,3.0,10/16/2014,"I like this location. They have a really great set up and the servers here are really great and polite. The one thing that really really upset me about this location was that they let a guest dog onto the patio, and then up onto the furniture of the resturant.  I understand people bringing their pets to resturants and sitting on the patio, but to full on have your dog up on the furniture of the resturant and you don't know peoples allergies and any possible health conditions really upset me. This dog was just a normal house dog, not a service dog in any way. It did not have any service dog tags, or a vest that they are normally suppose to wear."
Brittney S.,"Temecula, CA",285,274,426,2.0,6/12/2015,"Let me just start by saying I have always loved this restaurant. Cheesecake is my absolute favorite dessert and that's the only reason I will give this location 2 stars. I walked up to the hostesses and put my name in (2 plus a baby) and was told there would be a 20 min wait and they will text me when my table was ready. I specifically said I prefer inside bc of the baby. 45 minutes later I received my text. I walked up to (no surprise) they ""actually don't have my table ready yet. Sorry."" What? Then I proceeded to watch all of the people who came in after Us get seated at their tables. When the host noticed me standing and waiting he asked if I wanted to sit outside. NO! I'm with my baby and it's cold out! Come on. So he apologized to tell me they gave up my inside table to someone else and they will find another for me. I should have just left. He found us a table and our service was quick but they should have done something nice for us after we waited an hour to be seated. I probably won't come back to this location."
Eddie M.,"San Diego, CA",23,23,6,5.0,8/9/2014,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time today. I've never really planned on going because I never thought it was a restaurant people go for dinner. I always thought it was a desert place. I was completely wrong. The Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant where every single menu item is prepared so perfectly, you can't go wrong with ordering something you've never tried.            Every single dinner plate that was ordered on our table was superb. The Diane steak I ordered was cooked perfectly, and the Cajun chicken had spices that were chosen in order to satisfy your taste buds. But that's just the meal! Eating their cheesecake was an experience out of this world! The chocolate cheesecake just melts in your mouth with rich chocolate flavor! You must order cheesecake, forget about the other deserts!            The service we received was the best I have had at a restaurant in a long time. Our waiter was very nice and polite, he spoke very educatedly, he answered all our questions about the food and checked in on us frequently. GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!!!!"
Gabbie G.,"Murrieta, CA",39,14,19,1.0,12/17/2016,"This is my favorite restaurant. I don't live near one, so I have to travel almost an hour in both directions to eat here. This was my first & LAST time at this location. Our server Maria was horrible. After being seated for about 8 minutes before being acknowledged, she finally came over & took our order drinks. Usually, this is around the time I'm asked if I would like to order an appetizer, but no. She did bring us out bread & water, but set it down and left, without a word. I thought maybe it was because they were busy, but NOPE. She took other people's orders. 15 minutes pass & we still don't have our drinks, she walks by numerous times, & doesn't stop until I stare her in the face as she passes us again. She comes over, takes our order for food & appetizer at the same time. Still don't have our drinks. She finally brings them & then the appetizer comes out. OK, cool. When I get my mac & Cheese burger there's no condiments with it. She walks past us numerous times for 5 minutes without so much as a glance in our direction. She helps all3 tables around us but never comes over. I decide to start my timer on my phone to see how long before she checks on us. Another 10 minutes passes & she finally stops. By this time I'm ready to leave, I'd had enough. I took 3 bites of my dry burger. I asked for a box & she asked if the food was okay. I just said its fine as to not cause a scene. She brought our check & 2 minutes later, because I timed it, came to take our payment. Seriously?!? All I wanted was some acknowledgment & some damn ranch dressing & mayo for my burger. I paid & left without my beloved cheesecake. Ruined my entire day."
