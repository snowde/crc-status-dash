Robert Z.,"WARNER SPGS, CA",148,359,3420,4.0,7/16/2015,"The Wife and I give this place a 3 1/2 Star to 4 Star Rating.  We had dinner here 7/15/2015 Being in a large mall this place is crazy busy.  It's a very large restaurant with seating inside and outside. The service was fantastic they catered to all our wishes and the food came quickly after we ordered.  The prices are fair for the food that they serve and for a chain restaurant for the most part the food is pretty good.  My wife had a salad and a garlic and ricotta flatbread.  The salad was just so-so no-frills and no thrills.  1 1/2 Stars. The flatbread pizza was lacking in flavor and had no garlic flavor whatsoever.  Still not to bad.  2 1/2 Stars. I on the other hand had a fantastic bacon cheeseburger and called The Bacon Bacon Burger.  Two types of cheese and two types of Bacon. There was Applewood smoked bacon and what seems to be a special slab of pork belly.  Outstanding. I asked for medium rare and it came out a perfect medium rare.  This burger doesn't come Standard with tomato, pickles, onions and lettuce but I asked to include them on my burger and they included my request at no know extra charge.  The flavor of this burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. Big juicy and delicious . Highly recommended.  4 1/2 Stars. Of course the cheesecakes that their most famous for were fantastic and an absolute must. Enjoy."
Michelle B.,"San Diego, CA",50,171,742,3.0,8/29/2015,Atmosphere: the atmosphere is the same as other locations. First time coming here at this location. Was not as busy as thought. The down side is there were flies flying around. Made for an uneventful dinner because we were busy keeping the flies away. It landed on our food a couple times so the kids lost their appetites.  I would not come to this location again. I'm sticking to the FV location.  Customer service: great customer service! Our weighted was great and always made sure we had refills and checked in on us. He was the only factor that made our that made our dinner enjoyable.  Food: the food was great as always. The downside was we were unable to enjoy our food because of flies. Once they landed on our food kids and I no longer wanted to continue eating.
Cody T.,"San Diego, CA",14,40,41,5.0,8/29/2015,"Great service, quality you expect from this brand and awesome location attached to a mall.  This is smaller than the standalone Cheesecake, but it's perfect for servicing north county. Service is good, always willing to accommodate requests; more bread, extra sauce, ask and you will receive.  The kids menu is awesome, recommend the chicken strips and sliders. Kids Mac N Cheese could use more cheese, but the sliders are top notch: lowly salted and beautifully crusted.  All you heathens, quit whining about waiting!! You're not the only customer ,and if someone is touching your child, you could politely ask them to stop. The problem with society today, is people are losing common sense and confidence. Instead of communicating in real life, they wait to vent on social media and make themselves look like awesome citizens.  Cheers and thank you for being in North County (Restaurant, not you heathens)"
Craig W.,"San Diego, CA",502,1129,650,5.0,6/2/2014,"Review for Happy Hour (4-6 p.m., M-F) only. Is this the best Happy Hour in San Diego?  It might be.   Lotsa appetizer choices and a few nice cocktail choices, all for $5 each.  And the drinks and appetizers are all of normal (huge, crazy unhealthy yet crazy delicious) portion sizes, so you can eat and drink yourself silly for $5 per pop.  It's a great, great deal.  The potstickers are delicious and the spinach dip with toasted bread is very good, too.  Two people could easily make a very unhealthy but extremely yummy dinner out of a couple or few appetizer selections. Yes, I know it's a chain, but get over yourself.  The Cheesecake Factory chain has served up deliciously decadent food for decades and they know exactly what they are doing.  How many other restaurants are on the NASDAQ stock exchange? They get very busy but if you can swoop in and grab a seat in the bar area, do it.  And kids are allowed in the bar area, too."
Jaime F.,"San Marcos, CA",5,186,3,5.0,6/24/2016,The banana cream cheesecake is amazing!!!  Love the service and the food. Highly recommend aside from the long waits.
Sarah S.,"Escondido, CA",1,15,,3.0,8/13/2016,"Long lines to wait, so go before shopping and check in. Last time I went they didn't accept any reservations, which can be frustrating. The Cheesecake Factory honestly does not live up to the hype for me. It's all just overpriced food and isn't worth it to me. I just tried it to see if it was up to the hype and I was less than impressed every time I went. The best part was definitely the cheesecake, so I just recommend ordering cheesecake from the bakery."
Lori J.,"San Diego, CA",60,82,73,4.0,7/14/2014,"I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before probably due to my lactose intolerance, but I must say I'm pleased with this new addition to the mall.  The staff is friendly & fun. The food is really pretty amazing & the place is beautifully detailed. I've tried a few different dishes here and both have been amazing. Now I hear they have carrot cake one of my favorites. Uh-oh!"
Lizbethh M.,"Oceanside, CA",13,22,,5.0,8/10/2016,"Its really good, good service, didnt take that long, strawberry cheesecaje is my fave, it is really cool inside kinda romanticky"
Christian M.,"San Diego, CA",154,478,794,4.0,8/23/2014,"My has North County Fair come a long way.  This has been my local mall since forever when they were considered one of the ghetto malls of San Diego. It's nice and refreshing to see how far it has become.   With all the upscale businesses and multimillion dollar renovation, it's refreshing to see that they opened a Cheesecake Factory here.  The space is smaller than the other locations in San Diego, but it brings a nice, cosy feeling to the restaurant. I ordered the hibachi salmon and it's pretty amazing.  It comes with vegetables and a bed of rice.  The hibachi sauce is tangy and offers a nice twist to the normal salmon that you probably bake at home.   I also tried the orange chicken, which kills Panda Express.  The offering was so huge that we had to take it home.   As far as cheesecakes, I believe that's what they do best, right?  I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  I tried the Dulce de Leche and it was amazing.  Will I come back?  Definitely, it's a nice change from McDonald's and Taco Bell that used to run NCF."
Julia T.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,41,4,3.0,6/23/2015,"Nice server, but the food was not impressive. Everything was cooked properly and presentation was good but flavor was not anything to rave about.  Menu is way big! How can any one dish stand out with SO MANY options. They all sound great but you have to question the quality and freshness of ingredients when there is such a variety of options."
Siena R.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",3,40,23,5.0,10/19/2014,"Came here with a few of my friends after work for dinner. The hostesses were so nice and were able to quickly show me to the table where my friends were. Our server, April, was really nice and she waited for us to read through the menu for quite a while. The one thing that was hard was how incredibly long the menu was, we took quite a long time to decide what we wanted to eat. But April was really nice and our food was delicious! We had the most delicious dinner. The Chinese chicken salad was fantastic as was the Ahi Tartare. We then all ordered cheesecake and April was very helpful in her suggestions. We just had the most amazing dinner and we will definitely be coming back!"
Anna B.,"San Diego, CA",7,108,15,2.0,5/29/2015,Not surprised they only have 3 stars. I am only giving them 2 because the whole place is very nice.  We got here and put in our name. Told them we wanted a booth. Got a text saying our table was ready but it still wasn't ready. Then we were going to get sat in the bar area that was supposedly a half booth half table. I told them I said booth and now they said we have to wait another 10 minutes. It's funny how when you have the yelp app out they totally change the way the service is. And now we are seated at the biggest booth here. Which is nice but also not cool because now bigger parties can't sit here.  Our server was Theresa she was very nice and accommodating.  There was these 2 little fruit flies that kept flying around our table and it was super gross.  You don't even need to purchase an entree. Just get an appetizer and dessert. Save money.  OMG. I ate too much! And the bill was $82!!! Yikes. Lol. Never again. Only for cake to go.
Aubriana H.,"Laveen Village, Phoenix, AZ",3,63,40,5.0,9/9/2015,"I can't say enough good things about the Cheesecake Factory! It's easily my favorite restaurant. I've been multiple Cheesecake Factorys in different cities, the food and costumer service is always amazing.  My husband took me there for Valentines Day this year, just like every year, and it was perfect. It's such a romantic atmosphere. I always order the Miso Salmon. Easily the best thing I've ever eaten. It's always cooked perfect every single time and the sauce is to die for. Of course the cheesecake is always amazing as well. You get giant pieces that are well worth your money. I always end up taking half home!  Be patient with your server, especially if you're there at night. Its very busy and you have to understand if they seem a little distant. Its a very busy, stressful envoriment when it's packed. I always leave very happy (:"
Gabby S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/19/2017,"Went here the other day and found a thick, sharp piece of plastic in my deep fried mac n cheese. The manager came out and only comped the mac n cheese off my order didn't offer anything else. With many years of experience in the restaurant business, I was not happy with the service at this location. It would've been nice to get at least a free dessert or something."
Lisa H.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,,2.0,6/26/2016,"If you have a large party, we had 9, do not expect to be seated for about an hour and a half. They told us that upfront. That's how long it took for our table to be ready, too, no exaggeration and it was maddening to watch several smaller parties go ahead of us that came after us. Obviously, it is their intention to discourage large groups. After we were seated, our server took awhile to get our drinks and did not come back to give us any refills. Unless you put in your order when you order your drinks expect dinner to be awhile. And if you have youngsters, we had one, do not eat here unless you want your dinnertime to be super stressful with constant whining.  Putting it bluntly, we had very slow service to make a long story short. They must be short staffed on weekend evenings (maybe bad planning or just mismanagement). Their only saving grace was that the food was a good standard. The portions on the egg rolls are cut smaller than they used to be and the salad dressing on the salads have changed, but the rest of the food was acceptable, just not worth the 2 hour wait to eat. We saw our waiter a total of 3 times, when he took our order, when he brought boxes for leftovers and to give us the bill. And we had to ask for the boxes and the bill.  Even though the fashion valley location is much more busier, somehow their waiter/waitress service has always been much more efficient. Guess experience goes a long way..."
Clajo K.,"Fountain Valley, CO",70,44,16,3.0,1/18/2017,"I like the Cheesecake Factory.  Almost everything in their menu is delicious and their cheesecakes are a delight.  I think their servers are overworked.  Lately it seems like they are just going through the motions.  The service doesn't seem sincere.  Our server is good but has plenty of room to improve or she just needed to go on a 10 minute break.  Before, I was more incline to come here for special occasions and casual lunch or dinner but not as often as before.  This restaurant is falling off my radar little by little and I'm saddened by that realization.  I don't believe my expectations of The cheesecake Factory providing first class customer service is asking too much.  With your prices raising rapidly for the last 10 years, your service should also match that figure the customer is going to pay.  Sincere Customer service is the key to 4 stars.  Being impress by the sincere customer service is worth 5."
Laura S.,"Murrieta, CA",10,31,105,4.0,6/3/2015,Menu was dirty. Food was very good. Table is dirty. Redhead Waitress was pretty good. The utensils were dirty. But stone IPA was good.
David P.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,12,,2.0,7/17/2016,"Don't go here on a Sunday night.  I came here tonight for my first time and was really disappointed.  My wife has been here before and loved it, but tonight was really bad. It started by them being out of bread for the tables.  Then, we ordered and they were out of pizza dough.  My wife ordered a veggie sandwich (which she has ordered in the past) and it was the wimpiest sandwich we have ever seen.  It was basically toast with a little bit of veggies and cheese.   The orange chicken was the only meal that impressed us.  $121 (before tip) for 2 adults and 3 kids (no alcohol).  I feel like I was robbed.  We could have had a lot better food for less money somewhere else."
Lauren P.,"Escondido, CA",72,95,37,5.0,4/12/2014,"All Cheesecake Factory restaurants meet a good standard, but I feel this one at North County Fair is really great. Food is consistent, nice servers, great outdoor seating area, great ambiance, cleanliness is good! When we come here, we always find a spot in the bar to sit, eat, have a couple drinks, and we still get great service in the bar area.  Less crowded at lunch time to mid-afternoon!"
Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",0,15,1,1.0,5/25/2015,"I want to preface this by saying that this is my favorite restaurant...ever.  Went in for a late dinner last night. At at host stand was a very colorful bar back flirting with the hostess, dropping the ""f"" bomb every other word, VERY loud for my 10 yr old to hear. Then the hostess chimed in, also cussing and saying how she didn't want to be there...really? I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for many years and have never experienced anything like this, incredibly offensive. I think this location has just given up, which makes me very sad. I will not be returning."
