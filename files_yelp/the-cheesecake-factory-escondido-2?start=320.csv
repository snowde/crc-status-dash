Haley C.,"Winchester, CA",2,19,3,5.0,5/31/2016,Excellent experience! Sat at the bar and immediately got great service by William. He was so friendly and on top of everything. You can tell he truly cares about all of his guest's experiences. Had the soy glazed edamame and the avocado toast and both were delicious and filling!
Karen N.,"Escondido, CA",561,252,3899,4.0,3/10/2014,"Chicken Costolleta is my favorite, plus the corn cake appetizer. But service can be really slow, so you'd better have plenty of time set aside to eat. Last time here, the appetizer actually arrived at the table after our entree."
Unter C.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,,1.0,3/31/2016,Hostess undershot wait time by 100%. They ran out of the items the wife wanted They ran out of lids for kids water cups Bad server. The GM at this location should be fired. We will have stick with the Fashion Valley location
Teresa W.,"San Francisco, CA",22,81,304,3.0,8/3/2014,"I went up to hang out with my friend for the night and we were so hungry and decided to stop by the cheesecake factory.  We came around 9 ish and the wait was about 15 minutes! I normally just come for dessert but we decided to go for dinner today. We decided on the passion fruit mojito and and smoothie.  The waitress, Nicole, was very friendly and welcoming.  Both drinks were pretty good by the way.  We ordered the Cajun jumbalaya pasta and the Shepard's pie.  Keep in mind that the portions are huge!  My friend said the Shepard's pie was tasty but she thought it should have a little bit more of a crunch to it.  It was a bit too soft for her.  I never had Shepard's pie before so I'm not entirely too sure.  For my pasta however, the first time it came out with the noodles really overcooked and it was almost like a pile of mush.  I brought this to the attention of Nicole and she took care of it right away to replace it.  Honestly, she was spectacular and always came back with an update on how long it may take and if I needed anything. While the food was just okay for me, I wish there was another way I can rate the service.  It was awesome and I am so glad we had Nicole as our server."
Bri C.,"Oceanside, CA",21,22,23,5.0,5/24/2015,"Thank you Cheesecake Factory for an amazing date night!! We arrived and the line was literally out the door to put your name down. Luckily, my fiancé spotted out two bar seats and we were able to sit right away. David and Chris provided exceptional service. We literally felt like royalty.  I had the steak dianne, well done, and it was still very tender and the flavor was perfect. The mashed potatoes were to die for as well.  I also had the Greek salad, which isn't much of a salad (more of a mixed vegetable & dressing mix) but nevertheless still amazing. My fiancé had the chicken Alfredo & loved it start to finish. Our food took MAYBE 15 minutes. I don't even know how they made it so fast but I was starving so it was nice to not have to wait. The bar ended up getting flooded with tickets at one point and they executed it flawlessly, hats off to you two. Dessert was a given, millions of calories and every bit delicious. They do have healthier options but who wants that.  Management, please know that the talent behind your bar will get you repeat business and word of mouth recommendations as long as Chris and David are working."
Bruce A.,"San Diego, CA",17,24,57,5.0,12/17/2015,"Never disappointed in this place. Menu is extensive which sometimes makes it hard to make a choice but whatever you decide on is delicious. The portions are huge, big enough for 2 people most of the time. Customer service is great. The only downside is that the wait is always insanely long. Luckily it's attached to the North County mall so you can always browse while you're waiting. Especially since they send you a text when your table is ready."
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",670,814,2965,3.0,2/21/2014,"Hooray for CKF finally making its way to North County! Now, I can shop Til I drop at my second home - Nordys, and then veg out over a decent meal closer to home. I love Fashion Valley and The Shops at Mission Viejo, but there's something sweet about being close to that place we call home. My first encounter here was for take-out. The service was not very good. When I arrived at the checkout counter, there were three servers who appeared to be very young. They were arguing over what table ordered a ""smoothie"". One of the young ladies was extremely upset and combative because she was concerned that when she cashed out at the end if the night, that her receipts, etc would not reconcile. This, all while I'm standing there waiting to be helped; mind you, all three of them made eye contact with me several times, yet, none bothered to acknowledge me. Finally, someone asked me if I wanted to place an order. I explained that I was there to pick up an order. Apparently this did not register because I was asked the same question several times - twice by the same young lady who was clearly upset over the receipts and smoothie in question. Oddly, she was the same one I saw carrying my order to the checkout counter 10 minutes prior. Eventually, a young man appeared from his conversation on the opposite end of the counter to apologize and assist me. It was all quite dreadful. I sure hope this location steps it's service up and fast. On a positive note, I noted that my order was ready in 15 minutes as promised over the phone. My order came complete with utensils, bread and butter; just as if I were dining in - nice. I ordered the turkey club with avocado. What's a club without avocado? Boy was it good. Unfortunately, the French fries were cold.  Oh well, I still love the CKF; it will always hold a special place in my heart. That said, at some point I'm sure I'll give this location another try. They are still fairly new, bit that's no excuse for the poor service. Come on Cheesecake Factory Escondido, get it together!"
Daniel P.,"Chatsworth, CA",11,43,19,1.0,3/1/2016,"The food is great no doubt about it, always a great fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and I am always very fond of the service they provide while eating, except for some odd reason our waitress SANDY did not provide the service the Cheesecake Factory is known for. It was a simple order for a drink that's all...and this is what happened, the night before we went we had an amazing dinner our waiter was fantastic, anything we needed he was bending over backwards to take care of us, we decided to go one more time before leaving the area back home. As the waitress sandy approached us I asked her if I may have a frozen mango drink with some alcohol, in an intense she started giving us attitude and trying to explain what I was asking for impossible that they have certain rules there at the cheese cake factory, if I want any additional alcohol in my drinks they charge extra for every shot and on top of that I have to poor the shot in myself and mix my drink....are you serious?????if I wanted a little bit of liquor in my drink I have to poor it into myself??? On top of that I explained to her that the night before there was no questions asked about the same drink. She then goes and leaves and says I'll find out, after that she came back talking to me like I was a child, with very rude attitude, she explained they could do it for me but will have to charge me extra I said no problem.....she charges me 7.50 for the drink and an additional 12.50 for 2 shots of vodka I got 2 drinks and paid 36.00 plus tax about 40 bucks for 2 drinks that had a total of 4 shots 2 in ea drink! After all that I mentioned that since they have great drinks they have no mango drinks, and waitress sandy replies to me OH WELL CALL DAVID .....IN OTHER WORDS CALL THE OWNERS SON TO TELL HIM TO CHANGE THE MENU....R U SERIOUS SANDY????? THATS HOW YOU MAKE YOUR CUSTOMERS FEEL? AND AGIN I STRESS IT OUT I LOVE CHEEZ CAK FACTORY I REALLY DO...IN THE END MY WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE MANAGER AND THE MANAGER WAS BEGGING US TO TAKE A CHEEZCAKE ON THE HOUSE, WE SAID THANK YOU BUT WE SIMPLY DO NOT WANT ANYTHING TAKEN CARE OF FOR US WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THE KIND OF EMPLYEES YOU HAVE. THE MANAGER TOOK THE AVACODO EGGROLLS OF OUR TAB....( I REAALY DONT KNOW WHY) THE EGGROLLS WERE AWSOME AND WE HAD NO COMPLAINTS...I WOULD MUCH RATHER HER TAKE CARE OF THE 40 BUCKS I HAD TO DROP ON TWO DRINKS THAT TASTED VIRGIN...ANYWAYS MY CONCLUSION IS ENJOY THERE FOOD ITS AWSOME BUT WATCH OUT FOR A WAITRESS NAMED SANDY!!!!!!!!!"
Janet B.,"San Marcos, CA",364,361,358,2.0,6/24/2014,"Cheesecake. Oh how I love thee... That being said, this is not one of my favorite locations. Actually, having been here twice and having one of my really good friends work here does not even make it any better which is sad and even more dissappointing because I'd much rather spend my $20 gas in going and driving that much farther to my fave- irvine or 2nd fave- fashion valley. I had been dying to come here and after the first time, noticed a. How small it was and b. How slow and not so awesome the customer service is. After tonight (my 2nd time) it's actually reaffirmed my convictions and makes me coming a third time that much harder!  We came here, me and my mom, starving and ready to throw down money and eat like queens but upon arriving- we're told that we could sit outside (which at 9pm was way too cold) or wait 10min and be seated inside. Of course- I waited to be seated in, with both me and my mom having forgotten our jackets. The hostess tells me she'll take my number down and text me when our table is ready and I kindly soak it in (secretly ecstatic cuz I love technology like the nerd I am) but also let her know we would wait just off to the right (on the benches were no one else is waiting).... There didn't seem to be much of a line and I saw many open tables, only for me to get my text that my table was set, go up to her who had forgotten my name and then her walk away completely unannounced and me bewildered waiting as to what the hell was going on (excuse me, lol). She then came back, ignored us. We saw someone else get seated and then I asked (granted I was in front of her this WHOLE time) and she said ""just a sec"". Well that ""just a sec"" turned into 3 minutes where she seats us in this tiny cramped corner that had been OPEN THE WHOLE FRIGGIN TIME WE WERE WAITING. --- as I sit down, I see the floor is wet and in disgust, embarrassingly ask her if there is possibly anywhere else to sit (as I look around and see many open tables). As my mom gets up, she mentions her side is wet too and I see a look of PAIN on her face. My poor mom had slipped on water that had been underneath the table! And the whole time the waitress does not apologize, say a word, just that they ""wax the floors"" (oh great safety concern). I saw my mom had a hard time walking (she's elderly and is not one to complain & I asked to speak to a manager at some point.... Who didn't come over until about 10minutes into my meal. Granted, he actually came over and ""thanked"" us for notifying him but when telling him I'd like to report the incident, in no way takes it into consideration, choosing to ignore my words as if nothing was said. Yes, he offered us comped cheesecake for her pain. But don't birthday people who are celebrating also get it automatically whether or not it's even actually their birthday???.... I was not impressed. He never came back. Our waitress was great, my food was great ( ordered my usual Tuscan chicken since I'm dieting and doing no carbs) and although my moms steak Diane with shrimp looked good - her shrimp had been a bit burned (and by burned I mean I could see it blackened from far away & I'm near sighted). I could tell she was too shy and emabarassed to say something. There really should've been better service and more attention to detail and I quite think the cheesecake was just not enough for the whole trouble of the night. At least my wine should've been comped or something for me trying to make an attempt to enjoy myself over dinner after the horrible service we had experienced. We really go to cheesecake on a weekly basis but I think next time i would rather wait til we can make the trip to irvine or San Diego. I'm quite dissappointed in the esco location, despite how new it is.  The service is inexperienced from what I have seen(I'm sorry but it's true) and the amount of time It takes to be seated is slow (when it seems like it's not really that busy). There needs to be either a bigger staff to accommodate everyone or further training for this location to be up to par with the other two!!"
Sam S.,"Escondido, CA",114,154,,3.0,2/1/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory and usually get such great service... Not this time!! This was our first time to the location in Escondido and I have waited a while cause it is always super busy so I was hoping to have a good experience.  We chose to sit outside. They had like 5 tables inside taken and only a couple outside so they were very slow. We waited 15 minutes for the server to come get our drink orders. Thanks goodness we also knew what we were going to eat so we just ordered everything at once.  Food came fast and it was delicious as it always is.  Our server never asked how everything was, never filled up our drinks. I had to get and ask someone for a box. Then had to wait forever to order our to go cheesecake. Just pissed me off cause they were so slow!"
S K.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,7,,5.0,7/6/2016,i've been coming here for at least a couple of decades.  every time I go it's still a big treat.  I just wish there was one a little closer to my home
Cynthia T.,"Murrieta, CA",73,342,101,3.0,6/6/2014,"So,  the excitement of having a cheesecake factory close has worn off.  The food quality is no where near as good as the fashion valley location. The last time I was hear my side of steamed  broccoli was soo salty it was like I swallowed a huge gulp of ocean water!  I asked for another batch and ask for no seasoning and was told it didn't come seasoned. I'm sorry but I don't recall brocoli being a salty food!?!?!  I get my new batch of broccoli and it's still saltier than heck! Super disappointed because the florets were huge and looked delicious.  I'm not sure if I'll return but a pro to this location is he can browse the mall while u wait thanks to their text notification."
Matt V.,"Oceanside, CA",0,19,2,2.0,4/13/2016,"I visited this Cheesecake Factory about a week ago with my family.  I ordered the Shrimp Linguini and was so excited because the description on the menu sounded PERFECT.  While we waited for our food, we had the avocado rolls and of course, a slice of cheesecake.  The appetizers were actually the best part of the meal! When my linguini got to the table half of the pasta was not even fully cooked.  It was almost as if it never got to touch the water.  I was so disappointed!! My mother had a burger, which was bland and cool in the center.  The experience was backwards, awkward, and too many careless mistakes were made..  Although our server was extremely kind and the drinks were strong,  I will not be returning."
J R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,34,1,4.0,11/18/2016,"Food is always excellent. My favorite cheesecake is the hazelnut. Food is on the pricey side though and I always end up paying a lot because their dishes average $16-18. Slice of cheesecake is like $8.  Service is usually good but this last time, I didn't care for the waitress because we would have to ask repeatedly to fill our waters because she kept forgetting. She was more preoccupied with the table next to us with serving the alcohol. The previous time before this, I had a male server who was excellent."
Nikko G.,"Oceanside, CA",291,28,25,4.0,3/23/2014,"I've been to many cheesecake factory's but it was my first time at the north county fair location.  The only downside was we had to wait 45 minutes.  Customer service was really good as our waitress kept coming back and asking if we need anything.  It was good because she didn't come back too many times, so at the same time we were able to enjoy our dinner. Sometimes at restaurants you get the waiters or waitresses come back every 5 minutes and it gets annoying. But here at Cheesecake Factory it was perfect.  The food we got was amazing! I ordered the jambalaya pasta, and the rest of the group had southern style catfish, miso salmon, garlic noodles and Caesar salad. I have pics posted so you can see. My jambalaya pasta was really good. It wasn't too spicy. The spice was perfect for me. We didn't have any room for dessert unfortunately. But overall we had a great time and a great taste for the food."
BYRON D.,"San Diego, CA",2,19,1,3.0,2/28/2016,"My mistake. I ordered brunch,  I ordered Giganic Belgum Waffle with strawberry, pecans and whip cream.  Not Giganic!  It was so thin and only about 7"" square, I anticipated at least 3 strawberries but only 1 was served on the waffle. Bad bad choice."
Molly H.,"San Marcos, CA",4,126,133,4.0,7/4/2015,"Renee's Special is a great deal with soup of the day today potato soup ,salad and chicken sandwich. To much to finish although sometime I do eat it all or take half home."
Shannon C.,"Los Angeles, CA",193,242,177,3.0,12/6/2013,"Everything was up to par from the ambience to the large portion sizes. It's a brand new location at North County Fair, but a smaller space so I am guessing the kitchen is smaller too. But service was great, polite, helpful, and not pushy. I asked for a refill on that delicious bread and a substitute of kale instead of greens in my Ahi Tataki salad and they were happy to comply! Can't beat that! And with the long wait they will text you when your table is ready so you can shop in the mall while you wait. Huge improvement from Fashion Valley!  As always, the cheesecake was delicious!"
Kate K.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",0,56,21,4.0,6/26/2016,Best time to go is happy hour.  You get a ton of great food for an awesome price.  Sliders were delicious.  As always cheesecake was yummy.
Amanda H.,"Fallbrook, CA",134,17,,1.0,2/21/2016,"The service was absolutely awful. They told us the wait was 20 minutes and that we were welcome to shop and they'd text us when we were up. 5 minutes later, we got a text and were already a good distance away from the restaurant. We went back and they told us we were a little past the 5 minute mark and that they had given our table away. She informed us that we were first priority and it would be about 5-10 minutes. 15 minutes later after watching party after party get seated at their tables we asked how much longer. They still told us we had to wait and were extremely rude. We left and went to BJ's instead where we were instantly seated! I don't think after this experience, we'll be going back."
