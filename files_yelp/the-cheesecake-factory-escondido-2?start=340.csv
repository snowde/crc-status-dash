Allan P.,"Valley Center, CA",1,13,,5.0,5/28/2016,Received an apology for the poor service we received and an invite for a return visit. Been back several times tithe North County Fair location and have been pleased every time since. Great Food and Great Service.
Erika R.,"Vista, CA",129,15,10,5.0,8/16/2015,"My family and I celebrated my cousin's 23rd birthday yesterday and we were very much pleased with the excellent service we received. The restaurant manager, David Coy, went above and beyond in addressing all our concerns and having us seated in under 2 hours. (which for the Cheesecake Factory is a blessing within itself). We were a 15 person party. 12 adults, 3 toddlers. Our server was provided us with expedited service and excellent customer service. Thank you for making my cousin's birthday luncheon a memorable one."
Chad C.,"Carlsbad, CA",3918,394,2444,4.0,2/23/2014,"This is a new Cheesecake Factory in the Escondido Westfield Mall, this is a great addition to the various restaurants attached to the mall and surrounding it.  It feels just like all the other Cheesecake factories I have ever dined at.  Extremely clean with excellent food, cheesecake and wine !!!  This  kicks there overall class of the mall up a few notches !!"
Brian W.,"Escondido, CA",45,22,7,3.0,2/18/2016,"Not a huge fan.  Food is just good, service was horrible, much too crowded and the host staff is stuck-up, not engaged and plain rude.  Try harder Cheesecake Factory."
alfonso C.,"San Marcos, CA",8,3,,1.0,9/21/2016,"Bad  bad bad .. horrible service . They don't acknowledge who came or has been waiting in line for awhile I get the whole sitting situation, but there are always options you can give to big parties. And it's worst when it's someone birthday and you as a host have an attitude. I do the same if you don't like it get a new a job."
Antje B.,"Chino, CA",5,28,,5.0,3/5/2016,"I've always considered the Cheesecake Factory one of those quantity over quality type restaurants.  Boy, was I mistaken.  This location rocks!  I ordered the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon and it was magnificent.  Better than I've had in some very expensive restaurants.  The service was exceptional and the trip into the mall after completed the whole experience.  Give this location a try.  You'll walk away happy."
Stacie B.,"San Marcos, CA",146,182,27,5.0,4/7/2015,"My 14 year old son's only birthday request was to eat dinner at The Cheesecake Factory.  We arrived at 6pm on Tuesday evening.  There were 4 of us and we were seated immediately.  We went early on purpose to avoid a wait.  Our server, Paige, was AWESOME!  She kept our drinks filled and she was really friendly.   The menu selection is incredible.  I would imagine it would satisfy most anyone's appetite.  They have pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, chicken, etc. While we waited for our food, we had fresh bread with butter.  YUM.   Our food came just as we ordered it and it was pretty quick too.  Everyone loved their food and there was enough for us to take home.  After we ate dinner, we ordered cheesecake...of course.   Our table ordered: Mushroom swiss burger Factory burger Cobb salad (requested dressing on the side) Kid's Mini Corn Dogs Reese's PB cheesecake Oreo cheesecake Chocolate mousse cheesecake Not one complaint.  I would keep in mind they put their salad dressing on the salad so I made sure to request my dressing on the side.  This is especially helpful if you plan to take the salad home (so it doesn't get soggy).   Everything was delicious, service was on point, and the check was reasonable for 4 of us ($84).  We will absolutely be back!"
Monica R.,"San Diego, CA",3,3,2,1.0,10/15/2016,"Thanks for nothing restaurant manager Tony!!   Went into this cheesecake factory that had a 60 to 80 minute wait. Luckily, we saw seats at the bar tables and sat down instantly. That was the only good thing about this experience. Although we sat down immediately we were not leaving till an hour and a half later and there were only three of us.   And why did it take so long? Well the manager Tony claimed that it was taking a while to make my burger. When it finally came out (and how long does it take to make a burger anyway?) it was missing the toppings. So another five minutes went by while everyone else ate and then they brought out the wrong toppings.  Another five minutes went by and finally the right toppings came out. When I asked if anything could be done about it the answer was ""no""  other than a free slice of cheesecake which I didn't want.  Tony refused to take anything off the bill for this inconvenience and terribly long wait.   He claimed he had already talked to us... Yeah that was when he came out to tell us he was sorry the burger was taking so long. And that was before the rest of the screw ups.  What is that actually doing for me? Nothing.   Normally restaurant managers are overly accommodating and apologetic when there is this level of screwup. Heck I've even had an entire check comped for lesser screw ups.  I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories and this was by far the worst experience."
Lauren H.,"Vista, CA",0,32,22,1.0,10/15/2016,"Obviously they treat ""to go"" customers with less care.  I ordered the chicken piccata with no mushrooms, easy enough.  Apparently not.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, but can anyone explain to me why 1.) there was LITERALLY a tablespoon of sauce in the entire dish 2.) EXACTLY 5 capers 3.) Almost ALL noodles for $18 prior to tax? 4.) No seasoning in the minimal amount of sauce whatsoever.  Yuck.  Never again."
Kristina R.,"Vista, CA",63,76,4,5.0,1/8/2016,"I can't help it. I love it. Been to many of these over the past 20 years from LA to OC  and both San Diego locations. The menu is huge with a lot to offer (jambalaya w/shrimp & all rice is my ultimate fav) . Everyone you eat with will have plenty to choose from! The service is always good &  friendly,  even when it's busy. Never had a bad meal! I try my best to avoid busy times b/c the wait can be 60-90 minutes."
K.so.vera A.,"San Marcos, CA",9,85,2,5.0,4/6/2015,"We had a surprisingly great time at Cheesecake Factory this weekend. I typically stay away from chain restaurants but we were given a few gift cards by my husbands employer and decided to go check it out. The biggest factor in our experience was the bartender! He was super cool! In a time where you are lucky to get a smile from a server he was friendly, on top of everything, and chit chatted with us...even though he was the only bartender and pretty busy. He really stayed on the ball and was fun to talk to. We came on Saturday in the afternoon (lunch shift) so he gets recognition for his good work. We just shared an appetizer. It was good. They have a huge menu with tons of options. The cocktail we ordered was amazing! But we ordered a double and it came out to be a $20 cocktail. Wont be doing that again, but with a good beer selection (Green Flash West Coast my fave) we have plenty of options.  The only bummer is that this place is in the mall...I hate the mall. I get it though, but it would be lovely if they put one in Vista/San Marcos. I'd definitely go more often!"
Dianna C.,"Oakland, CA",317,419,739,4.0,12/8/2013,"I came here for the test run service the weekend before their grand opening.  I ABSOLUTELY love this location. The only other CCF I've been to in San Diego is the one in Fashion Vally Mall. I'm so glad that there is one in North County SD! (: I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in their dining service (test run for their staff prior to opening). JBH and I sat at the bar for our dinner. Our server, I believe his name was David. He had told me that it's his first time as a bartender and that he used to work at the CCF in FV! He was very friendly and very good at explaining the menu.  To start, we got the nachos with spicy chicken... beware.. this thing is HUGE. No, correction it was GIGANTIC. We ate a lot of it, but still had some left. We though we saved enough room for our dinner entrees, but obviously we were wrong. Haha. We literally ate 2 bites of our entree and had the rest boxed up. We got the California cheesesteak sandwich and the wasabi ahi over brown rice. Both dishes were really good! The meat in the cheesesteak was thin and tender. Very delicious. The wasabi ahi was also good, nothing bad about it. Although it tasted a lot better when we were at the restaurant vs. taking it home and reheating it. I don't recommend getting the fish to-go. especially since it is cooked medium rare.  Lastly, dessert!!! We got the red velvet cheesecake. YUM. It's probably one of my favorite cheesecakes at the CCF. They were featuring the s'mores cheesecake and I rally wanted to try that one, but we barely had room for the one we ordered. Maybe next time!"
Oliver C.,"Temecula, CA",14,22,9,4.0,3/8/2016,"Excellent tasting food, beware of its peak hours during lunch and dinner it seems to be quieter from 2-4 if you walk in. The only thing that keeps this place from being 5 stars is that they do not take advanced reservations. Your party needs to be there before they can seat you so make sure you're group is altogether. Dessert is a must have here, if you're eating here you need to have it. There's plenty of options for various tastes."
Dan W.,"San Diego, CA",1,56,2,2.0,3/18/2016,"Sat outside on a beautiful day..food was average, but their music selection was horrible"
Carolyn T.,"San Diego, CA",51,7,,3.0,5/20/2016,I eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before and I enjoy the food and normally don't have a problem with service. However at this location the hostess was a little rude and having a large party of 10 and their policy of not allowing call ahead seating is absurd. Once I told her we had a party of 10 I was given a rude look and was told she would have to check with the manager. After a little wait I was then told it would be an hour wait. Not so happy with the customer service experience here. The only reason I'm giving them 3 instead of 0 stars is for the decent food.
Stuart J.,"Torrance, CA",183,83,53,3.0,11/30/2013,"Went here during their first weekend and it was obvious they're still working out the kinks of getting this to be running like other CFs. First thing we were told was that they ran out of white rice, and we came in right when they opened, and we saw the managers conferencing about this oversight.  The TVs in the bar area were on paid programming for a good half hour before they were changed to a game that was going on. I know I'm not there to watch tv, but when I look over and am watching KitchenAid and T25 ads, I don't feel as comfortable as I am when a game's on.  They also had a promotion going on in the lobby area of purchasing a gift card and getting a voucher. My wife and I tried to explain this to our server multiple times but she wasn't sure what we were talking about.  So everything is still getting worked out. Food and cheesecake were their usual deliciousness. Didn't see anything special otherwise."
Emily R.,"Vista, CA",1,54,,4.0,3/23/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of my favorites. Although it's in the mall, I love the location for some reason. The decor is really cute and cozy, even outside.  We go here a couple times a month, but since it sort of pricey sometimes it's not our top option. Usually I get the club which is SO good. It's way too much for me so I normally go home with half of the meal for leftovers but it's worth it. And she always gets this steak meal. Comes with shrimp, mashed potatoes and steak and 95% of the time she says it's super good. We absolutely LOVE the bread. The bread itself is like one full meal for me. One thing I hate... the ranch. It's gross here.  It's not the best best food I've ever had but it's definitely one of my favorites. Like I said, pricey depending on what you get but I highly recommend it."
Gabriela R.,"Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza, Mexico",0,13,2,4.0,5/11/2015,"After reading some yelp reviews of this place, it made doubt if it was the right choice for the ocation. My second visit was way nicer even when the wait is too long and you got no place to seat since there's more ppl waiting. The place was busy but it wasn't packed as i thought it would be. I might be wrong but seemed like they were just a little too short on staff for a mother's day. I was getting a little impatient and to be honest a little mad too. What saved the night? I didn't like the table where i was about to be seated so they gave me another one right away. The waitress was very nice which made my mom feel comfortable (if she's happy I'm happy). Good service.  Ohhh btw, surprise!!! They dont take reservations. :("
Dwight A.,"Escondido, CA",6,135,175,5.0,3/16/2015,"First time eating here and I was actually very impressed. -Our server was awesome and so friendly. -For a busy Saturday, we were seated very fast. -The food is on the pricey side, but it was delicious! - You must try their marinara egg plant dish and also their fantastic chicken salad sandwich. -The restaurant interior looks very cool, very artsy vibe to it. I highly recommend this place and you will not be disappointed."
Jessica B.,"Vista, CA",105,121,132,3.0,9/21/2014,"Wasn't horrible, wasn't great. Won't be back. We went for option of  high top bar seating so no waiting.  Service was OK, he was busy and didn't have time to come by much & drinks took a very long time but we weren't left wanting for anything so overall it was fine.  Food was a disappointment.  The quality to price point isn't even close to justifiable. Ahi capacio for appetizer. It looks like a pink gel you can see the plate through with 2 slices of avo, and a pile of wasabi. It's hard to eat since the texture is like a goop and you have to tear it apart and try and get it on a fork. Hard to explain, just don't do it. Entree: Steak Diane. The only flavor to the steak pieces was a ton of salt and pepper. I asked for A1 sauce in order to eat some of it. The only bonus to the price is the serving size is huge. The mashed potatoes are good (but those are hard to mess up), and the mushroom sauce is great and has a good amount of mushroom pieces. We had a gift card so that helped soften the blow a little bit. Each got one drink (glass of wine & a beer), appetizer, 1 entree each, and a slice of cheesecake each to go. Total bill was over $100. Go local and eat quality food that is fresh, flavorful, and don't waste your hard earned money here."
