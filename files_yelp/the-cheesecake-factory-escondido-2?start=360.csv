Mike G.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,3.0,11/13/2014,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in a very long time, but from what I remember the food is really good. After walking in I really loved the atmosphere and how everything was set up. The hostess was nice and our server was great.  My mother and I both ordered pasta. She got the Da Vinci and I got Fettucini with Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes. We were starving so when the food came out we quickly dove right in. BOTH pasta's had absolutely no flavor even though it looked delicious! I tried my my mother's dish and sure enough it was bland as well, although mine was a little worse. I had to add mountains of salt just to give it flavor. I was not enjoying it at all therefore I took most of it to-go hoping I could fix it at home. Not to mention I started to feel sick, probably from all the salt I added. I'm not quick to say something tastes bad because I eat almost anything. That's how I know this was a big fail.  I was very disappointed, knowing how much I would have to pay for a horrible meal and I proceeded to tell my mom that maybe pasta is just not their specialty. My mother then told me she had a pasta from another Cheesecake Factory only two months prior and it was delicious. So I think it boils down to the cook who made ours. I've worked in the restaurant business before and I know that the food tastes better depending on the time you go and the cook you get. So either the chef or one of the cooks has a lot of work to do. I can say that whoever made our pastas does not know how to cook at all. The only reason I'm giving three stars was because our White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake was delicious, and because the customer service was great! Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but everything should be good at a large chain restaurant like this.  Sad to say I probably will not go back to the Cheesecake Factory. There are so many less expensive-DELICIOUS food that can be had elsewhere."
Miranda C.,"San Diego, CA",43,123,89,4.0,11/19/2015,Super busy all the time. I usually put my name in and then do some shopping around the mall. I usually get lucky and find a table in the bar area.
Caitlin B.,"Vacaville, CA",70,34,3,4.0,2/16/2016,"Came here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and we had a great meal! We ordered an appetizer of fried zucchini, artichokes and portabella mushrooms which was served with some sort of aioli....delicious!!! My boyfriend ordered some type of burger that he thought was OK but not great. I got a veggie burger which, to be honest, was one of the best I've ever had! Very hearty although a little messy because the patty kept falling apart but I didn't mind too much. For dessert, we had a lemon raspberry cheesecake which was delicious! Tasted like lemonade. Service was good. Overall, the experience, food and service were good but I do feel like the food is a little pricy. We will definitely be back though!"
Lynda C.,"Escondido, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/11/2016,LOVE the ambience! Classy place to eat and we have never been disappointed in the menu or food! Service gets a bit slow during busy hours but still well worth the visit! Just make sure you are hungry because portions are large and you MUST save room for dessert!
Mandy E.,"San Diego, CA",11,137,22,4.0,3/1/2015,"Came here for dinner with my family, the six of us, and unfortunately there was over an hour wait with a mix up of our check up. To be expected thought- on a Sunday night. The hostess was apologetic and the service we received made up for it. William was out waiter and was absolutely delightful! We aren't always the easiest bunch, due to substitutions, but he nailed it! Our drinks were always full, and even the bus boys were helpful. The grilled artichoke was a little disappointing and was slightly cold and raw, but had great flavor. The skinny menu options were delicious! I got the turkey avocado and was very pleased. Big side salad portions!  The checks were split a little off, but we all just made up for it with tipping. Overall- great experience. The s'more cheesecake was Devine. Again, William nailed it with the service."
Black X.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,692,14,5.0,9/11/2014,"For a Cheesecake Factory this is simply the best. And remember, I'm an LA/OC guy. Fashion Island, Spectrum, Pasadena all take notes from this mall locale. Always great service.  Madison is our regular server. Quite possibly one of the finest waitresses I have experienced. She even creates her own sauce concoctions (ranch/balsamic) which are quite good. Food always hot and perfect. If you are in this mall and hungry what you gonna do? Red Robin and their hydrogenated oil soaked fat fries? Eat some Panda Meat in the food court?  Get real and eat here"
Robert J.,"Escondido, CA",336,515,153,4.0,1/9/2014,"This place has huge potential, but it's young, busy, and has a few kinks to still work out.  I've been in 3 times since opening, and overall, they've been great experiences.  Can't beat the Happy Hour! In general, the wait staff has been great.  zero complaints.  We've already picked a couple favorites and try to chat with them if they have time!  We've learned not to have any expectations when putting our names in.  They don't do reservations, so you never know how long you might have to wait :( The food is great.  Top notch. HH appetizers are really well done and you get a great deal for your $.  They do have an excessively large menu, but no one I've been with has had complaints.  The table bread is surprisingly sweet, but don't fill up on it!  I won't speak on the Cheesecake: I've heard it's great but actually haven't tried it myself! Drinks are awesome.  Happy Hour is great for the money, but as soon as it hits 6om, bust out your wallet because they are PRICEY (and I'm used to LA).  $12 each for a bunch of them (when $ isn't listed on the menu, you should worry).  However; very well made and delicious! There have been a couple hiccups: food was brought to someone else's table, wrong orders, etc.  If I had to pin blame, I'll stick it with the host staff and people who bring out the food (""servers""?).  We live close; we'll be here often! (Oh just remembered, I'm coming back tomorrow- hahaha)."
Kevin M.,"San Marcos, CA",4,6,8,5.0,10/4/2014,"Good times had by all. The Escondido location was a long time coming but has finally arrived; to everybody's delight. Arrive early or expect to wait. Waiting is not that hard since you have a whole mall to pass the time with. They'll text you when your table is ready so you don't have to worry about walking out of range while you wait. This is pretty much your only option since they don't do call-ahead seating or reservations.  Portions are large. The appetizers can be meals, and if you bag half your dinner you might be able to make it through dessert. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is just chocolate coconut goodness. The Original Cheesecake is probably the best classic cheesecake I've ever had -- not dense at all, your fork glides right down through the moist fluffy cheesecake and through the light graham cracker crust. The thin sour cream layer adds a fresh tartness. Worried about the sour cream? It's not overwhelming and you can always balance it with a bit of the free-standing side of whipped cream. Excellent."
David C.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/31/2015,Was a 75 min wait to be seated. Plus the 30 min wait for our food. Food was good but the time I wasted to receive it was definitely not worth it. Will not be coming back
Keysha M.,"Carlsbad, CA",140,120,617,4.0,1/13/2015,"My favorite thing about this place is seriously the service. Not once have I ever had a server who wasn't at their best. My last server, Brent (Brett?), was just amazing. He was ready with suggestions, happy to wait when I took a little too long to figure out what I wanted. He took my salad back because there was way too much seasoning on it before I even noticed the error myself. He was just crazy aware, and friendly and rolling with his A game.  This place can be hit or miss as far as the food goes. The selection is huge and sometimes a little overwhelming. I know complaining about too many options is lame but there's just something a little too much about a menu that's more of a novel than a pamphlet. I can say though that it's a great place to take a large group of people with varied tastes. You also can't go wrong with taking a suggestion from your server as they generally all recommend the same seven go to dishes. Dessert of course is a MUST. Don't bother eating dinner if you think you'll be too full for dessert...just go for the dessert and box your food up for home."
Janine P.,"Oceanside, CA",0,11,,3.0,3/6/2016,"Told there would be a 30 minute wait. Waited over 45 minutes. Was told we were next on the list with, which was also told to another family of three.  Got to the table and was asked what we would like to drink as we were handed our menus. We asked for another minute and were given a long 10 minutes.  At least CF food is good because the service is not."
Jan D.,"Escondido, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/30/2016,The menu was overcrowded. My meal was the worst I have ever had for dining out. Bang bang shrimp and chicken. Yuk. Really disappointed. I will never go back or recommend this restaurant. Too much variety for any one thing to be good
Rebecca L.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",1,15,,1.0,8/30/2014,"I thought about a second star but that would be entirely too generous.  I have been a consistent customer of The Cheesecake Factory for several years, I have NEVER experienced a Cheesecake a lack professionalism and class like this one.  I am normally okay with paying 100 dollar bill for two people if the service matches the price of the meal.  No such luck here - unfortunately we picked to go here on our anniversary. Waited for a table for a reasonable amount of time and occupied ourselves in the bar until our pager buzzed.  We quickly left our seats in the bar, which we had to wait for, closed out our tab and made out way over to the host.  We were acknowledged after a couple minutes with a buzzing pager I'm hand and asked to wait until someone could seat us.  That's when a pissed off server grabbed some menus, called our name even though the host has pointed us out to her, and proceeded to walk to our table, not stopping for other patrons to leave.  She then put our menus down and said, ""I'm going to be your server, l'll go grab waters and bread for you.""  Not a great first impression but she redeemed herself throughout the night.  The managers, however, did NOT.  One manager came over 15 minutes after we ordered to tell us that they had burnt my boyfriends meat loaf and had no more portions for the night.  When my boyfriend asked for his recommendation, the manager offered, ""a burger"".  Seriously? This whole menu and you choose a burger?  He ordered the enchiladas instead.   Our server came out seconds later to apologize and offer to bring my veggie burger.  No use in letting it sit under heat lamps.. But it already had.  Not only was the bun soggy, it came out with no grilled onions and... The patty was BURNT!  So I took three bites and ate my fries instead.  Our server came back with the enchiladas half way through my fries and said she would send a manager over to address the veggie burger.  This is what got me, instead of coming over, he just took my meal off our bill.  I'm not coming here for a cheap meal (obviously we were already three bar drinks and an appetizer deep when we ordered our meal) I'm coming here for the customer service!   When we asked to speak to a manager after ordering our dessert to go and paying the bill, we told him about our experience, reminding him throughout that it wasn't our servers fault.  He heard us out and then said, ""So what exactly were you unhappy with?""  Really?  We came here wanting a nice dinner for our anniversary, neither one of our entrees were up to par and no manager checked on us after they KNEW that out experience wasn't up to their chains standards.  He responded with, ""Can I get you a piece of cheesecake on us?""  If you had checked on us after the issues with BOTH of our entrees, then we would have taken a free slice.  At this point, we have already paid for one. Get it together - I'd rather drive to Fashion Valley from OCEANSIDE."
Zeke M.,"Oceanside, CA",44,7,,1.0,10/15/2016,Waited there for an hour and they put in a small booth which sucked!!!!! We asked for a larger booth and they told us it would be a hour longer!!!! Operations needs to get a clue and wait is rediculous for not having the food on its menu!!!! Been here before and the service the service really sucks here!!! This is last time that we will return here to dine and we will father go to stone brewery instead!!!! Escondido location needs help with there dining experience and service!!!!!
Amanda B.,"Escondido, CA",105,16,2,4.0,10/23/2015,"This place is always chaos and there are far too many damn items to choose from on the menu. Yet, I love it so much. The cheesecake is good and I have my favorites on the menu I like to eat."
Jen M.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/31/2016,The worse dinner ! The manager was nice but did nothing for us $ 18 a plate you would think the food would be good . I had mash potatoes that were not even mashed and cold .disappointed
Julie C.,"Escondido, CA",116,119,27,4.0,12/31/2014,"The wait time here is pretty long due to it being in a popular location - attached to the mall.  We waited 1 hour before being seated.  Service was good for it being a busy night - 12/27.  We came for my fiancé's birthday dinner.  The food was all yummy.  We ordered loaded potato poppers, avocado eggrolls, chicken madeira, steak Diane and a bbq burger.  All was hot and yummy!  For desert - cheesecake of course we ordered: the vanilla bean, the banana cream, chocolate chip cookie dough and snickers.  They were heavenly!   The only downer, was that the hostess had assured me that she would have a candle in my fiancées cake and they would sing to him.  It never happened - we sang to him anyways sans the candle!  I will be back for coffee and cheesecake dates often!"
Brad B.,"Temecula, CA",2,56,15,2.0,8/30/2015,"Wow. So busy on a Saturday that the host group lost our number to page us for a table. Ended up waiting for 90 minutes instead of 30. Bartenders are overwhelmed and don't provide good service. Worst of all was the smart ass waiter Named Bryce. Rude,arrogant and maybe a little high.  The good news is the food is great. I wouldn't stay away but maybe go at lunch."
Cyrielle H.,"Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego, CA",48,23,42,3.0,12/27/2015,"Portions are indeed as huge as the place is notorious for. We usually get 1 entrée to split between 2 people. The taste of the food is not great; it tastes like frozen food and the fries are not great. I had the fish and chips and it did not taste good. The cheesecakes however are delicious. I can taste myself getting diabetes with each bite but in moderation once in a while should be ok... I hope. On the bright side I really enjoyed the music they played, the good kind of old school."
