Felicia F.,"San Marcos, CA",1,18,,2.0,7/27/2014,"Since this restaurant opened I have been about 6 different times. It seems like each time it gets worse. Either the food is not correct, it tastes horrible or more often than not the service is TERRIBLE. The most recent trip (which is prompting my writing of this) we were seated promptly but then ignored for almost 30 minutes before we complained and our waitress finally came over. I also found it annoying that she did not refill our drinks in a prompt manner. How am I supposed to eat my food without anything to drink?? She gave plenty of attention to her other tables but very rarely came to ours.....plus they were not that busy. All of the employees were just talking in the back.  The only reason I go back is because of the cheesecake.. otherwise they definitely would not receive any of my money.  Long story short... the food is relatively good but the service is ATROCIOUS... Better off going to BJs, Red Robin or somewhere else."
Jam T.,"El Cajon, CA",0,20,10,2.0,1/28/2016,The food great!! The service is garbage!! The waitress seemed very bothered & she took forever to come take our orders!
Ray S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",7,75,26,5.0,1/1/2016,Had a great experience. Food and service was excellent. Quite impressed and will return.
Monica F.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/6/2016,Ate at the Escondido location and Justin Warren was by far the best server we have had at this location. He gave great service and was very friendly. Food was great too.Thank you for an awesome evening Justin!
Jimmy Z.,"Oceanside, CA",28,81,151,5.0,1/10/2015,Love the atmosphere. Great cheesecake.  Friendly staff.  Kinda dark. Will be back. Very nice place.
Steve M.,"San Diego, CA",13,103,135,5.0,5/30/2015,I always come to this wonderful place for coffee and cheesecake! So many options but the blueberry is the best!
Liz A.,"San Marcos, CA",0,14,5,3.0,12/19/2015,The food is not that great  especially for the price they ask for. The cheesecake is delicious however. Good luck finding seating on the weekends though!
Adrian L.,"San Marcos, CA",3,17,,2.0,9/4/2015,"The food is always amazing but if you enjoy good customer service I strongly suggest that you do not visit this restaurant. Simple things, like refilling drinks and bringing bread to the table seem to lack from the servers training sessions. Each time I come to this place I seem to get stuck with the worse service on the planet. When you are paying for this pricy food it would be nice to feel like you got what you came for. All and all bad the servers need to be retrained."
Janet S.,"Escondido, CA",19,73,30,3.0,12/14/2015,"I went around 11am on a Thursday. Was not thrilled about lunch specials, i opted to go with the dinner size as it was 1-2 difference. The 4 cheese wasnt that great but my friend ordered the chicken carbonara which was better. Waiter was decent but i wont be coming here based on the over priced food and not great tasting."
Malcolm S.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",23,122,35,5.0,10/15/2015,This is a very nice restaurant and one on the rare places to get a well-made pork chop.
M B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,11,8,3.0,8/27/2016,Went to lunch for a birthday celebration we ordered lettuce wraps in the Renee special. The Thai lettuce wraps are always delicious and did not disappoint. the Renee special we requested a turkey sandwich to go with it and they were out of Turkey so instead they offered sliced chicken. We also had the mushroom soup with Renee special it was absolutely delicious but a little on the cold side. Not sure why they asked if they could sing happy birthday because nothing ever occurred the server was good the food was okay it was a little disappointing.
Lisa M.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/11/2015,I wouldn't recommend going here if you have a big party. They do not take reservations. We had 15 people in our party. The manager didn't accomodate us even though we called two days ahead to give them a heads up that we were coming. Then we called two hours ahead to make sure they could accomodate us. When we got there the manager said we would have to wait 3-4 hours. We waited for an hour then left and went to BJ's instead.
Lily S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,12,,1.0,2/22/2017,"Went to lunch on 2/21/2017. Where do I start. When we arrived it took our waitress 15 minutes before she even acknowledged we were there. Finally ordered our lunch: two burgers (one well and one medium well) 3 salads, 1 chicken pasta dish and one chicken salad sandwich. After about 25 minutes part of our lunch finally came out. The well done burger and the 3 salads. Another 10 minutes the medium well burger came out. I asked for mustard and that was another 10 minutes (my burger was cold by then). Then there is the pasta dish. The kitchen made it wrong the first time and the second time. All we asked for was sauce on the side. Not mixed in the pasta. By the third try they got it right. That was another 25 minutes. When it finally arrived the pasta wasn't cooked. Very crunchy. Very disappointed and will not go back, ever. The waitress never asked if we wanted drinks. Water was served. Asked for a coffee and a soda took at least 10 minutes. If I could give negative stars I would."
Kel'ly B.,"Escondido, CA",14,14,,1.0,6/24/2014,"To wait or not to wait? I have been to the cheesecake factory in san diego, always had a good time, shorter waits. However my husband & I were and are VERY disappointed, wait times exceed 90min often 2 hours. REALLY?? that is ridiculous. My husband wanted to attend there for his birthday,  but the do NOT take reservations.  I dont know that we will be back there or recommend this place to our friends/family ..maybe at one last ditch effort.    The food was good, just not 2 hour wait good."
Jason S.,"Chula Vista, CA",42,11,2,5.0,12/15/2015,"This place always blows me away with the food, service, and decor. You get what you pay for and this place always out does itself! I will come here many times over and over in the future. Keep it up!"
Dream M.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/10/2015,"NOT kids friendly.We were not served,when we we went their with our kid.When we reported to the front desk,she told she can report the same to manger.Hated her tone. Will never go back.. Wish i could give a zero rating."
Michael B.,"Temecula, CA",1,28,9,5.0,8/17/2016,"Manager David Coy sure knew how to take care of us during our last visit to Cheesecake Factory.  We were celebrating my sister's birthday and they had seated us right by the kitchen.  Not only was it very noisy over there, but it was also very cold.  In fact my brother, who had suffered a stroke last year, was chattering his teeth he was so cold.  The noise also bothered him quite a bit because he had a harder time focusing and tracking voices for conversation.  The place was packed and when I mentioned our situation to the manager on duty he quickly made room for us at a much more comfortable table.  It was a corner, round booth and made for the perfect place to celebrate my sister's birthday.  When I told Mr. Coy that I was very happy and impressed with his excellent service he just said he was doing his job.  He was very humble.  I'm so impressed by the service we will continue to make Cheesecake factory our party and celebration destination!"
Alex M.,"San Diego, CA",36,107,56,5.0,12/2/2015,"Fantastic filet mignon, crisp broccoli, succulent fries, classy Vegas-like atmosphere, large and fresh drinks, very friendly staff, and of course incredible and divine desserts!"
Christina S.,"Escondido, CA",18,10,6,5.0,12/5/2013,"Nothing short of excellent! The lettuce wraps are  amazing! Best in town! The pineapple mojito was the best mojito I've ever had! We usually order our favorite dish - the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, but this time we wanted to try something different so we ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano. It was delicious! Never a bad meal at Cheesecake Factory!"
Rebecca W.,"Temecula, CA",4,57,28,5.0,8/18/2014,"Wow! Love the skinnilicious menu! It was TERRIFIC!! Everything on it was yummy! I had the burger. A friend had the enchiladas and another friend had the Ahi and all of it was under 600 calories and amazing.  Totally worth it, too. A great value.  This location is beautiful with a great staff.  I would visit here weekly if I lived nearby.  I highly recommend visiting this terrific venue."
