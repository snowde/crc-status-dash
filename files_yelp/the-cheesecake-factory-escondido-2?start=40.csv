Jericho M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,1,3.0,7/8/2017,"Came here with my friend tonight that I haven't seen in forever. I've been here a number of times before but never reviewed so here is my first review We got there and I gave my name to the hostess and he told us it would be 30 mins which was fine. But it wasn't 30 mins we waited for almost 50 mins and watched as couples that came after us got seated. When i confronted a different hostess she that our names where not in the system which was irritating but wasn't as bad. What really got me was that the same male hostess looked at me numerous times and didn't say anything.  The food was not bad. I felt it was better back then but that's subjective. I ordered the mac and cheese burger and we had sweet corn pancake thing for an appetizer which was good but not great. Our waitress was ok she seemed a bit irritated but it was hectic and it's not like she lashed out, very timid and didn't smile. The service was ok.  The saving grace of this review is the Cheesecake. I got the tiramisu cheesecake and it was good. Not to crazy sweet and not bland at all.  This place wasn't bad and I'm willing to give it another shot but based off tonight this was probably not as great experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.  I say give it a shot you might have a better experience that I had. If all else fails at least the Cheesecake is good."
Vincent P.,"National City, CA",397,228,2257,2.0,2/20/2017,"The only redeeming factor about Cheesecake Factory is their cheesecake. Everything else, not so great.  After coming here on a Saturday and being told the wait was over an hour, we decided to come back the following Sunday. Turns out, that didn't help either as the wait was still over an hour. If you have a party of over 2, don't bother coming on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night.  They don't take any reservations so your only option is to physically come here and wait it out. Worst yet, when you stroll around or go to the bathroom during your wait, you see multiple empty tables around. Do they have a pact with the stores in the mall so people are more inclined to shop while they wait? Do they just like to make people wait to inflate their ego? Who knows.  After 75 long minutes, we were finally seated. Got the complimentary bread and it was good. Then we ordered. We got our small plate of chicken taquitos which were decent.  Then we waited for our entrees. We waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. It probably took them a solid 45 minutes to get the food out. The manager did come out to apologize and say everything would come out shortly. But when you've waited 2 hours in total and only have bread and 2 bites of a taquito, the apology becomes a moot point.  .... so a day and a half later, we finally get our entrees (exaggerating). I got my Smokehouse BBQ burger. ""Burnthouse"" would've been a more ideal name for it. One of the bacon strips was burnt so I threw it out. The beef patty was cooked a medium well even though I asked for medium. It was way drier and less juicy than I wanted. The fries were way too greasy. I tried really hard but couldn't finish my meal. When I went back home, I felt like crap.  The other dishes on our table were a chicken pasta and an angus beef sandwich. These 2 items were not even mediocre. The chicken pasta was dry and minimal in flavor and the angus beef was servee with too many pieces of pure fat. Yikes.... all of the entrees missed. Worst yet, at $15-$20 an entree, you're essentially throwing your money into a fireplace ordering these. Our waiter was nice though.  I would not recommend this place and would not come back other than for cheesecake or alcohol on an offday/offhour."
Benon K.,"Burbank, CA",44,12,9,1.0,11/24/2017,Worst service I have ever had ! They have employees galore but no one is in sync for attentive
Christina D.,"Temecula, CA",34,5,,1.0,12/6/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory ever. Don't waste your $ at this location, trust me it's worth making the drive to the Fashion Valley mall location. We orders 2 appetizers, 3 entree's and 2 drinks from the bar. The only thing good was the avocado egg rolls, everything else was awful. Waste of $150. Disgusting food, drinks and the service was just as bad. Crap management also."
Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,465,44,3.0,11/25/2017,"We were invited to come back again and try this whole thing over.  We came in for lunch on Saturday before heading to the SD Zoo and they were not too busy, it was a beautiful day and we sat on the patio.  Our server ""Carly"" was really nice and took care of us very well.  The Thai Coconut Chicken and Chicken Riesling pasta both came out very good.  No problems with the order this time and the food was good."
Magz K.,"San Diego, CA",231,598,2477,4.0,4/14/2017,"Been coming here for years now and the food here never disappoints! Gotta come with a huge appetite since they give you such a huge amount of food. Just be prepared to wait awhile to get seated here, they do get very crowded. If you know your going to have a huge party coming in, call in and reserve a table a couple of days before. My favorite cheesecake here is the original and the strawberry."
Terena R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,6,1.0,7/28/2017,Why do you always give me a burnt mess when I get my food to-go? You don't treat me like this when I dine in. How do I add a picture?
Marc M.,"Kaneohe, HI",6,85,166,5.0,2/23/2017,"Much Mahaloz Ari, service was top notch, rarely servers are so exceptional New Riesling Chicken was excellent ,  Thanks again for a nice dinner out"
Mike W.,"San Marcos, CA",10,29,11,2.0,8/8/2017,"This place is starting to go downhill when it comes to food quality. My wife and I both ordered from the skinnylicious menu, and both got robbed. I ordered the Tuscan chicken. It came with three breasts, but it was covered in cherry tomatoes and one piece of artichoke. I figured out why. Apparently, they didn't have more than 4 2 inch pieces of asparagus, and a tablespoon of undercooked farro.  My wife ordered the chopped salad, and it was shredded lettuce and a couple kernels of corn. Cheesecake Factory used to be synonymous with quality food.  I guess those times have passed."
Jazmin P.,"Oceanside, CA",39,143,271,5.0,7/9/2017,The cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants because of the high-quality service and the high-quality food. The cheesecake is by far the greatest cheesecake that I've ever tasted. I love the fact that the cheesecake factory lives out to its name by actually being a factory of cheesecake. Every time I go I get the same dish and the same appetizers it's pretty much already set in stone what I want because every time I go it's like if I'm tasting it for the first time. The drinks however vary depending on my mood and can drink a nice wine or a mixed drink. The food is fresh and delicious with the smoky taste to it and the ambience is very nice because the lighting isn't too strong. It's a great restaurant if you're going out on a date or taking your special his or her person for a nice night out.  I wouldn't recommend taking children because it may be a little too mature for them.
Shae P.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,51,8,5.0,10/23/2017,"Boyfriend and I came here last night and it was a great experience! We usually go to Red Robin but decided to try something new. When we walked in there were quite a few parties waiting to be seated so we thought we'd have to wait too and we even had a bet going on how long it would take. Surprisingly we were seated right away! Our waiter was so attentive and our tip we left him reflected it (I wish I could remember his name). We started with the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and they were so good, a little messy. Then we had our meal and ended with an original cheesecake. Overall, the food was so tasty and the service was phenomenal. We'll definitely be back!"
Nick M.,"San Diego, CA",1,64,8,5.0,1/25/2017,"Jimmy!!!! The service was fantastic! We arrived late, about an hour before they close. Our server, Jimmy, was top notch! We shared 2 entrees...the ""chicken bellagio"" and their ""famous meatloaf."" Both meals were excellent. Cant say enough good things about the portion size and quality of the food. Prices are high ($15-$20 per entree) but at least the portion sizes reflect it. The complimentary wheat bread is delicious too! We finished with the tiramisu cheesecake! Wow! Thanks for a wonderful meal! Shout out to Jimmy!"
Lani G.,"San Diego, CA",138,20,78,5.0,6/18/2017,Recently I've become a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. Whenever I go I try something new and so far I haven't been disappointed. Today I tried the Four Cheese pasta with chicken and it was really good. One thing I actually always get and will continue to get when I go to Cheesecake Factory is the Italian Tiramisu Cheesecake because it's one of my favorites! Overall my dinner was great and very filling also the service was excellent!
Liangcheng R.,"San Diego, CA",5,40,42,3.0,8/5/2017,"I came to lower my rating because I experienced inconsistency in food which really bothered me. I like to order things until I get sick of them usually. An example would be their Shepard pie which I think is super yummy. However, I ordered Pasta Napolitano three times so far and the taste and quality was so dramatic each time. I guess just consumer beware. It never tasted bad but usually when I order something because I like it I obviously don't want the taste to change. Good service and drink selection as always. A little dim like every cheesecake factory."
Phuoc B.,"San Diego, CA",5,24,,2.0,6/18/2017,"Came here for Father's Day. I got the chicken pasta riesling. It was a good portion but if you don't like onions I say don't go for it. Our second plate was the crispy chicken costoletta with mash potatoes and loveddd that plate. Got a couple drinks while we were waiting so I was full by the time the food got there. I took about three bites of my pasta and bagged up the rest.  We ended up bagging both our plates, you know how big of the portions are. 10 minutes into the drive I realized I left both boxs so I went back to grab them. I spent 67$ and of course with tip and everything it came out to 80$. Well everything was great but when I came back they had already thrown my food away!!! The bartender Jeanie offered me a side salad, excuse me? I just dropped 80$ and you're going to offer me a side salad because you didn't even wait 30 minutes to actually throw someone's food away. It was our first time at this cheesecake, we usually go to the one off Friars. Definitely not coming back. You know what you can do? Edit my credit card tip to 0$ thanks."
Kathy D.,"San Marcos, CA",310,172,424,4.0,6/5/2016,"CF is my go-to place when I want to splurge and have a good slice of Cheesecake.  A week ago, I tried the Banana Cream Cheesecake.  It was heavenly! Also, the menu has many options, so there is something for everyone.  I also like the bread they serve, oh my gosh!  I can't get enough of it.  I have a few favorites on the menu, but the top items on my list are the calamari appetizer, the classic burger (it has to be medium done), Hibachi Steak, Miso Salmon, and Grilled Steak Medallions.  CF is a great place to meet friends for happy hour, or go with the family to have good food, and enjoy the great atmosphere of the restaurant.  It's always busy when I go to this restaurant regardless of the location."
Karen L.,"San Diego, CA",24,3,,1.0,10/8/2017,"My family and I tried to go here last night. The manager was extremely rude when he told me it was a 3 hour wait. That is utterly ridiculous. Maybe he didn't have the wait staff but all the patio seating was empty. He was an a$$. He needs to go to manager training. The dish I wanted is the Madeira chicken. I just found the recipe online and I'm sure it'll taste much better when I make it at home. I'm not sure I can give this location another chance, because this isn't the first time I've been treated that way. I like to be nice and forgiving..."
LeeAnn B.,"San Diego, CA",276,457,25,4.0,12/9/2016,"Of course it gets 4 stars, I mean it's The Cheesecake Factory! Their food is delicious and the ambiance is lovely. This was my first visit to the Escondido location and it definitely lived up to the brand's standards.  They were very accommodating and found us the perfect seat that my mom could park her scooter so she didn't have to walk far. She has had three hip replacement surgeries and recently had to cave and get a scooter to get around big places such as the mall that this restaurant is located in. She is a bit self conscious about the whole thing and it was great that the staff here did not make a big deal about it.  I ordered the Margherita pizza and my mom the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. My pizza was pretty good, but it was my mom's dish that made this visit great. She raved about it and liked it just as much warmed up later that evening for dinner. It was a bit spicy for her, but she said the flavor was simply amazing. The complimentary bread is nice touch as well.  It's definitely a little pricey, but they do have lunch specials that should be taken advantage of if possible!"
TJ V.,"Temecula, CA",0,62,17,1.0,10/31/2017,"We ate here Sunday around 1:50pm and had to wait 50 mins when the hostess said 30 mins. They seemed to seat people before us who arrived AFTER us!! We went to find the manager. Management didn't seem to care. THEN when we FINALLY got our table, the server was nowhere in sight for about 15 mins. My husband had to look for the manager again because we didn't know what server was assigned to our table. We hadn't received any bread or water and had been waiting for a long time!! We found out it was Rob. Imagine, we spent $100.00 with tip!!!!! :( VERY DISAPPOINTING dining experience ALL AROUND!! We seemed to always get bad service at various Cheesecake Factory locations and thought we would give it another try for my birthday...unfortunately that was a BIG mistake! Don't waste your time here!!"
Veronica G.,"Escondido, CA",54,10,2,5.0,7/31/2017,So we always love this place. The food is delicious and they have something for everyone. This time was fun because Danielle D let me customize a cheesecake... I got the fresh strawberry cheesecake with added toasted marshmallow cream. She was super friendly and helpful even though they were extremely busy. I didn't feel rushed.
