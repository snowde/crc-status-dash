Alan V.,"Palm Desert, CA",4,55,7,5.0,8/8/2015,"The food here is always good, typical for a mid to high end food chain. What's not typical about this place is the service, it's amazing! My review today is particularly for the guys behind the bar. Chris deserves a raise! He is beyond helpful (they all were great but he was my bartender) and knowledgable. He makes his job look easy and is able to make the customer feel comfortable with what we order, whether it was a drink or food from the menu. Employees like this is what makes a business thrive and your are lucky to have great employees at this location. I will definitely be back here!"
Daisy F.,"San Diego, CA",100,117,137,5.0,9/26/2014,"Our dining experience tonight was awesome! I usually get the same order when my husband and I eat at Cheesecake. That night I switched it up and tried the Salmon Genovese, which was the chef special of the night. This was also recommended by our wonderful server Westley. This dish has become my favorite! The cous cous and the basil pesto sauce really complimented the salmon. The salmon was also cooked to perfection and was lightly seasoned with lemon. Westley did a fantastic job as well. Definitely a perfect example of what customer service should be. He was fast and efficient, and didn't miss a thing while he was our server. Thanks Westley!"
Victor B.,"San Marcos, CA",85,118,11,4.0,11/12/2014,So Service is Great! Multiple people assisting waitresses. The food came out steaming hot. The fish n chips were great especially when they put fresh graded parmasan cheese on my fries. my request..mmm.everyone at my table loved their plates. Im ready for dessert.
Rebeca R.,"Oceanside, CA",39,64,124,2.0,9/27/2015,"This restaurant's location inside the mall is very convenient, however it left me disappointed. The food quality and taste were very unpleasant, I probably won't return to give it another try. Thankfully my server was great and friendly!"
Rebeca A.,"Oceanside, CA",1,39,11,5.0,12/3/2015,"This is the first time I have ever tried this restaurant and all I have to say is ""amazing"". The wait time wasn't too bad, the bread was delicious, the service was awesome, our dish looked delicious and tasted perfect!!! I loved the dimmed lighting & candle lit scene  It was a bit pricey but 5 Stars!"
Rebecca B.,"San Diego, CA",2,2,,5.0,6/6/2014,"I know every place has problems. They are always going to rise. Last night at Cheesecake we had problems.  Waited a bit too long for service, the bread we wanted they were out of, and one of the cheesecakes we ordered was still frozen in the middle.  I believe it is the way that a place handles themselves when there are problems that define them.  Martin Spellman, Manager, handled them like a champion. He came over and took time to apologize, explain things to us how it went wrong, and let us know how he will rectify the situation. I was very impressed and will continue to patronize this establishment.  By the way, when the waiter was alerted we were waiting the service was awesome! The bread was served to us hot out of the oven and it was the best I've ever had. And the Cheesecake was still delicious and comped."
Helen R.,"Encinitas, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/21/2016,"Seems whenever we call for a takeout, we get a return call to say they don't have what we ordered and need to make an alternative choice.."
Robert B.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,1.0,5/9/2015,"This place is overrated.  The only reason my family and I tolerated waiting for an hour and a half to be seated is because we received a $100 gift card for this place.  We were excited that our name was finally called but to our dismay, the server was escorting us outside.  I told the server that I requested to be seated inside; It was about 55 degrees outside.  He then turned, escorted us back around to the waiting area, and told me that the ticket read no preference, so he handed me a pager and told me it would be another 10-15 minute wait.  He was dismissive and moved on to the next person.  I was pissed and hungry; but of course, I didn't want to ruin everyone's night, so I kept quiet.  Eventually, my name was called again and we were seated.   As soon as we sat down, a waiter came by and took our drink order.  As soon as he turned his back to us, a waitress swooped in and said that she was our waitress and asked if we were ready to order.  After a chuckle of disbelief, we told her we had just sat down and we needed a few minutes to review the menu.   Amateur hour continued as my eldest son had to return his glass of water because it tasted soapy.  I was trying to ensure everyone enjoyed themselves, so I was very nonchalant about it as I explained to him that it wasn't a big deal because it was just water.  We asked for a replacement.  We all ordered and had our dishes brought to us.  My wife ordered the salmon, but had to return it to the kitchen because it was undercooked.  A gentleman came to speak to my wife and took her plate, and assured her it would be six minutes.  The waitress asked if she could get my wife anything in the meantime.  It wasn't until we were all done eating that her salmon was served.  My wife ate a few bites, but was feeling guilty for holding up dessert.  It was at this point that we decided to take the rest to go, including desserts and end the unpleasantness.  Our waitress apologized and informed us that they were slammed in the kitchen because it was Saturday night.  She also said that people from all of her three tables had some sort of issue with their food.   I was disappointed that despite ordering drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts, not a single item was comped.  My wife did not eat dinner with us because of the kitchen's mistake, but we were penalized for it.  The night was anti-climatic thanks to Cheesecake Factory.  My recommendation is to drive across the parking lot to eat at Macaroni and Grill or BJs.  Oh, despite the long wait, they don't take reservations.  And trust me, the food is not worth the wait."
M N.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/27/2017,"Waited over an hour and a half for a table, for 9 people,after arriving at 5:45, didn't get seated until a little after 7.  Apparently they do not take reservations, nor do they have many tables to seat over 7 people.  They sat numerous groups of 6-8 people before sitting us.  We had to wait on one family, who took over 30 minutes to leave after getting dessert and paying as they had to move the tables together.  Server didn't show up for 10 minutes, no drinks for 25 minutes after sitting, the waiter had even taken our order at that point.  I had to get up and ask for one of the runners to please bring us waters! No apology for the waiting, for the lack of service.  They forgot one of the orders for our party, my grandmother, she at that point had waited 2.5 hours to get food (5:45-8:15).  They didn't ask about special celebrations, thankfully we brought our own cake! Didn't sing to my cousin.  It was my cousin's birthday and we only stayed because she picked the restaurant and had never been before.  What a horrible experience for your first time and what a way to ruin a birthday!  You should accept limited reservations for certain times/party count for parties over 7 people.  Only comped the missing meal, no overall discount for shitty service and extraordinary wait time.  This restaurant in particular is SMALL, not many tables, not Cheesecake quality.  If you are a big party, stay away!!!"
Malerie B.,"New Port Richey, FL",20,7,1,1.0,11/20/2015,"Most terrible Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too. Waited forever and no one ever came and got our order or gave us a drink. Lady next to us had her dog in the restaurant and was waiting forever to get her change back... It was so noisy we couldn't ever taken because  they were slinging silverware around forever and being super loud. Decided to leave and just get cheesecake to go, that took forever also. Won't be back."
Marina M.,"Oceanside, CA",85,44,60,3.0,4/14/2014,"HAPPY HOUR IS AT THE BAR ONLY Just wanted to throw that out there since we made the mistake of not asking about this until we were already seated at a table and ready to order our first round. It wasn't a major deal for us since we were really there for a little celebration dinner and had just assumed that happy hour would be a perk given the time were having dinner. We all know what happens when you ASSume though. When were first arrived and asked for a table for 7, the hostess asked if we wanted to squeeze into a booth meant for 6. Not sure how to react, we all agreed that we preferred booth's anyway so we would give it a try. Thank goodness for the waitress in our section for saving us from ourselves and pointing our we'd probably be more comfortable with more elbow room once the food came out. If only we had been able to be moved to a different table in that same waitress's section. She seemed great and in good spirits. Our new waitress wasn't very friendly or enthused about anything. We had to ask for bread and water. Both the water and bread came right around the same time as our appetizers and our second round of drinks. Maybe she was turned off by the fact that she was assigned such a large group at the end of her shift or maybe she knew she'd be leaving before we were done and just didn't care. Whatever the excuse, it was clear she wasn't going to be putting much effort into helping us.  The waiter who took over her shift really made sure that we left on a good happy note. He came in/took over halfway through our  meal and still turned the entire experience around. I'm not sure if he had to share any part of the tip with the other person who waited on us, but I sure hope not. He deserved all that and more. The food was pretty good. It did seem a little over priced for the quality, but the portions and plates themselves were huge so maybe that makes them worth it? I am not sure. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp curry plate and it was too sweet to really enjoy. The cheesecake was delicious. Although being stuffed from the drinks, appetizers and large portions, we obviously could NOT go to cheesecake factory and NOT order cheesecake. So we took it home to enjoy once awakened from the food coma we were all about to experience. Cheesecake was good and it was a huge slice (as it should be at $8 a slice). It was basically 3 desserts in one as it lasted 2 days in the fridge so I was able to enjoy a few bites a few different time throughout those two days before I tossed the last bit."
Chris W.,"Murrieta, CA",0,18,,5.0,7/24/2016,"Service from Freddie was great, I'm going back for sure. The jambalaya is my favorite and the mojito of any kind are wonderful. BTW Freddie is a woman so ask to be seated in her area for 5* service!"
Roxann S.,"Prescott, AZ",0,20,11,1.0,7/24/2016,"Well the big tall buff bus boy in the black shirt deserves our tip.   He was the only one earning his money.  I have never seen so many waiters and waitresses gathered in the back corner talking and laughing while customers waited.  This place needs better magement.  No one is in charge, haven't got our food yet but never coming back."
Sean M.,"Escondido, CA",77,6,,5.0,12/12/2014,"I am always very pleased with The Cheesecake Factory in Escondido. The food is delicious. I love the herb crusted salmon and my wife loves the Thai chicken wraps. We also get the avocado egg rolls which and delectable! The Cheesecake is pretty good too :) As for the service, it's top notch (our waiter Michael was a true pro). Always attentive to our drink refills and the bread and butter is fresh. Sitting within walking distance at the same mall is BJs which is the very opposite of great. I will bypass BJs from here on out because Cheesecake Factory is SO MUCH BETTER in every way."
Jose V.,"Escondido, CA",29,140,91,4.0,5/18/2014,"This is not your mom and pop eatery. It has  a high profile name and product. This makes it good and bad.  Good The food is good for those that are fans. The jambalaya, southwestern rolls and bread are always good staples. The menu provides you choices from healthy to small portions. The cheesecakes are good and really their anchor.  Bad  The food is expensive....especially for kids. Considering if they really don't eat much. I would say family style sharing is key here. The other is that it is a popular choice. The wait time is long....unless you arrive when they open. But I have waited as long as 30 minutes and as little as 5. It really depends when you go."
Paul S.,"San Diego, CA",68,160,812,4.0,7/7/2015,"I don't really go to the north county mall area compared to how much I go to fashion valley in which both have a Cheesecake Factory right next to them, but they're basically the same in terms of quality and service. Their cheesecakes are just as good compared to the three cheesecake factories that I know of around SD area. I've been to the one next to fashion valley, downtown SD near Seaport Village, and then this one. They've all been equally just as good during my visits. I don't really order different food items/entrees so all the ones I've ordered have been consistent. That's the things about Cheesecake Factory. It doesn't matter where you're at, they're all gonna treat you the same I believe. There's an outside patio area to eat if you don't wanna be outside but then you'll be exposed to some workers taking a smoke break or shoppers tryna get a quick fix before they head in etc. There's a bar that can fix you any alcoholic drink you'd want. There's a lot of parking to go around and what's another plus if that it's right next to a mall. Shop and eat good good at the same time with good company."
Raffy Joy B.,"San Diego, CA",295,152,325,5.0,4/4/2014,"So I dunno the guy's name, but he was wearing all white, he recommended thai salmon, got it, it was great, I left our extra chocolate breads at the table and left, he ran out to the parking lot and delivered them, five stars"
Melissa A.,"Escondido, CA",19,60,9,2.0,3/20/2014,"Since I live in Escondido, I was stoked when I heard we were getting a Cheesecake Factory.  No longer would I have to travel all the way to Fashion Valley to experience the rye bread and my Farfalle Chicken.  We tried this place twice.  I was disappointed both times.   The wait is ridiculous.  The first evening I was quoted 90 minutes and we were seated closer to 120 minutes after check-in.  The second time we elected to sit on the patio to shorten the wait time; we still waited 20 minutes (at like 4pm on a Sunday, we thought if we went early we could avoid the crowds).   The patio has poorly placed umbrellas and heaters.  The sun was in my eyes until it went down, and the heater only kept me warm while the fiance got goosebumps.  The inter has tables that are way too close to each other.  The one in Fashion Valley has this problem also, but Escondido takes it to the extreme. Service is just okay.  Sometimes it is difficult to get your server's attention and they don't check on you enough.  Water glasses stay empty much longer than they should. Most disappointing however, is the food.  They can't ever seem to bring the bread out in a timely manner, or they will bring out only one kind of bread (and it's never the rye!).  And I ALWAYS order the farfalle.  It is my favorite forever.  I don't care if it's 87894354657653 calories.  MY FAVORITE.  So, the first time visiting Escondido TCF, I order my favorite dish that I have had many times before in Fashion Valley.  It was so disappointing that I ordered something different the next visit.  We went to Fashion Valley a month after this disappointing trip, ordered the farfalle, and we both agreed that Escondido just doesn't have a handle on the recipes.        Also, wtf is with Escondido CHEESECAKE FACTORY constantly running out of CHEESECAKE flavors?  It seems they are always out of the flavors we want to try-- as early as 6pm!   Get your shit together, Escondido Cheesecake Factory.  We may try this location again sometime later after they have had a chance to work out all the kinks and get the recipes down.  For now we will continue to drive to Fashion Valley."
Berdie W.,"Escondido, CA",2,8,,2.0,3/20/2014,"very disappointing,have tried the one in vegas and the one in san diego none of which impressed me so we thought we'd try again the new escondido one for hubbys birthday. Busy for a sunday, with 3 hosts taking names and handing out pagers or they will text you. We found a seat to wait the 30 min quoted and was chatting with a nice lady next to us,seems she had been waiting more than 45 min and we found they forgot to tell her WHY they wanted her phone # (she gave her home number).....poor lady...... Then they texted us ""your table is ready"" so we got up with a crowd still at the host area to hear our name.....and waited ...and waited....and waited.....as many tables were seated.Finally asked when I could find a inch to get near, and they said ""oh you have to check in again........gee maybe they could have said that at first??????? Someone finally came to seat our party and walked to the back to find someone else had sat that table    so back to the front...this is starting out SWELL..........wait again for another table. Bottom line they need to explain to the guests and communicate, after the bad start the food was so-so and the birthday dessert is a joke."
Sandy S.,"Fallbrook, CA",8,9,,2.0,5/6/2014,"Very disappointed.  Treated myself to a rare meal out on a long day; 3 pm seemed a good time, between the lunch hour and dinner madness. But...the waitress seemed sort of ditzy... Then I waited for my beverage for way too long. The place was empty! Why would it take more than a few minutes?  I ordered from the ""Skinnylicious"" menu. The Fresh Vegetable Salad sounded delicious: ""Asparagus, Green Beans, Tomato, Cucumber, Roasted Beets, Apple, Edamame, Radicchio, Romaine, and White Cheddar, all chopped with Pomegranate Vianigrette."" I paid extra for chicken to be added; good thing, because it was 99% lettuce!!  I don't know how to post a photo here, but I took one, and trust me, there were no visible vegetables AT ALL! When I told my waitress, she mentioned they were cut up into small pieces, so that's why I wasn't seeing them... She offered to bring me some more, and they were tiny pieces of beans and asparagus, but at least it helped.  I don't know if this is always the way this salad comes, or if they are trying to cut costs or something, but it was a sorry excuse for a veggie salad."
