Realtor Karl B.,"San Diego, CA",59,1973,16,4.0,4/4/2014,"Come early because these lines could get long (very similar to the lines at Fashion Valley). Also, their 4-6pm happy hour mon-Friday is a pretty good deal. $4 drafts, $5 cocktails, $5 appetizers (regular price around $11). End your meal off with their award winning cheesecakes... Yum!"
J C.,"San Diego, CA",17,322,12,4.0,7/27/2015,"I must have been one of the last people on Earth who had never been here but I have to say it was good. The macaroni balls were the best thing we ate, but the BBQ pork sandwich was good too. I'm not sure it was good enough to wait in line and battle the crowd for, so I'm not sure we'll be back unless it's at an off hour."
Ronny J.,"Vista, CA",92,25,30,2.0,7/27/2016,"Well this was my first time and last time at this location.   We visit the restaurant Sunday July 24 to celebrate my daughter 6 birthday.   First I check in and told me be around 60-75 MN waiting time.  We wait outside for almost two hours and no one text us or call us.  After waiting went back to the restaurant and the guy at the front told me we text you and already give your table to some else now you have to wait again.  I was like what ???? I show hem my cell and no text at all , any way wait another 20 MN and got our table.  My friend order a margarita with silver Jose cuervo , the waitress come back and told no Jose cuervo sorry and my friend other different tequila.  I order a lemon herb chicken and after 5 MN the waitress came back and told me sorry we run out no more lemon chicken ... At that moment was obsessed, I cancel my order and we stay because we have 4 kids with us and they are starving. After that manager show up apologies and told me the chicken is on the way.  The chicken was no flavor at all bad plate never had. So do I recommend this place ? Nopp.  Ahhh manager give us just a free cheese cake for the birthday girl.  Thats all"
Lin B.,"Oceanside, CA",5,17,5,2.0,4/17/2014,"I've been to this location twice in the past week. I love the food and both of my servers have been nice, but they're a little spacy. I always order something big intentionally so I'll have leftovers to eat later. My first visit this week, I had most of my food left but was too full, so the waitress offered to box it. She didn't put my leftovers in the bag with the rest of my family's though :( so the next day when I went to eat my food, it was nowhere to be found! Also on that visit, the waitress forgot to bring my dad's drink for the longest time and brought the cheesecake we ordered to go out on a plate. Just a bunch of little things kept happening, pretty annoying. On this last visit, just last night, everything was good, up until I got home and found that my waitress gave me the wrong cheesecake! My friend texted me saying she had mine and I had hers. We live an hour from each other so it's not like we could switch back. I guess I should've checked before I left, but when the waitress hands me a bag and says ""here's your cheesecake"", I trust the waitress. I guess I'll double check in the future. I'm just so bummed, it really sucks that their errors cost me my lunch the next day. Ughh I was so excited for that cheesecake, it looked delicious."
Heidi F.,"Boston, MA",0,37,,3.0,9/5/2015,"The food is not on quality with other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants I have visited, mostly in Boston, MA area. I was surprised at the lack of customer service.  The staff seemed apathetic and lacked a happiness and helpfulness I seek when I go out to eat."
Kevin B.,"San Marcos, CA",11,14,,3.0,3/15/2014,"Being a server at a highly corporate restaurant, I felt as if I would fit right in with the whole Cheesecake experience. Just as I expected, there are a few things that reminded me of my personal establishment. First off, we waited past our 90 minute quote. I was a little disappointed but I know how it goes sometimes. After waiting for nearly two hours the hostess seated me at a table that clearly was not cleaned off. I was amazed, breadcrumbs all over the table which was set. I decided to take matters into my own hands and clean off the table with my napkin. Then after my girlfriend picked her napkin off of her appetizer plate we saw that the plate had in fact been used. Gross!!! The server then came by and acknowledged the lack luster table spread and addressed our concern.  At this point I was a little heated. First the wait, now a dirty table. I mean I know things happen but it was starting to get the feeling it wasn't going to get any better! Maybe it just wasn't my day!!! With that said the rest of the meal was great. The food was timely and very tasty. The mac and cheese balls are great! I mean you feel terrible for eating them, but they are amazing! Oreo cheesecake was great too! I feel like the prices are a bit up there. However, it's not a bad value considering the atmosphere.  Give it a shot...but be ready to wait!  If not skip on over to BJ's!!!"
Pam B.,"El Cajon, CA",5,169,27,2.0,6/8/2015,"Based on this visit. This was an extremely disappointing experience. We went for lunch before shopping. Arrived about 11:30, things were slow, waitress was on-the-ball with drinks and our order. Four orders. Two soup and sandwich, one kids grilled cheese and one salad. 30-40 minutes later our food finally arrived. The child's grilled cheese was on a plate so hot I could not even handle it from the waitress. Something is seriously wrong in the kitchen that can't turn out 4 simple order faster that that. Bad experience. Nice waitress. Yes I did speak to the manager to voice my concerns. We were offered a slice of cheesecake each."
Barbara R.,"Escondido, CA",5,60,,1.0,5/17/2016,"Went again as a friend wanted to meet there.   I ordered  salad with beets and goat cheese.   it was a pile of lettuce with maybe 6 dice sized cubes of beets and an 1teaspoon of goat cheese.  Had I been asked how it was, I would have sent it back.  But it was served by a ""runner"" and no one checked in with us after that.   NEVER EVER AGAIN."
Cindy H.,"Escondido, CA",1,5,2,4.0,12/10/2014,I ordered chicken enchiladas. I substituted white rice instead of cilantro rice. It was excellent except for the black beans. The black beans had no taste to them. Our servers were attentive. Answered every question and gave us what we wanted(I'm one of those weirdos that likes my food a certain way and the servers didn't make me feel bad for it). I have enough left over a for lunch tomorrow. I brought home a piece of the seasonal peppermint bark cheesecake. I'll let you know how it is in a little bit.
Caroline N.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",7,23,4,2.0,7/28/2014,Not as impressed with the food here. Had fish and chips. Bad fishy taste both my husband and I experienced after we were finished. Cole slaw half sauce. Had tried their chicken salad sandwich last time and didn't feel great afterwards. Not sure what is their problem??  OLD food.  Have eaten in their Fashion Valley restaurant and food was always great.   Must say the service was good. No problems others experienced.   Had to have a Starbucks to get rid of that taste afterwards
Annie T.,"San Diego, CA",827,129,151,4.0,1/31/2014,"I haven't been to any Cheesecake Factory in over 7 years.. but I'm so glad my friend and I decided to go here for dinner since we were going shopping at the mall. Since they said they don't take reservations (we went on a saturday) my friend went early to get us on the waiting list. We started off with water and they brought us some bread. The server we had, Ashley, was really great! She gave us all the time we needed to decide on food and drinks (since we kept talking and forgetting to decide). We ordered: -Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms: I thought the sauce it came in was great, but overall I wouldn't have ordered this for myself. I'm not sure if it's usually served with pasta, but that wasn't something I was used to. -Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken: YUM! The portion was huge! It came with some mashed potatoes and carrots. The chicken was very juicy and the sauce was great. I asked our server for some extra sauce and it took a while to come (she said they make it from scratch for each order) but it was worth the wait! Nothing special about the potatoes, and the carrots weren't bad. They were cooked, but still had a little crunch to them which I like a lot. -Skinny Long Island Iced Tea: This was great! It wasn't an overwhelming strong hit, but you can tell it packed a punch. -Passion Fruit Mojito: I don't like overly sweet drinks, so this one was just okay for me. My friend loved it though. Overall the portions (main entrees at least) were huge and worth the money. I definitely would come back here. Our server was great and we had a wonderful time catching up and filling our tummies with yummies! Oh and that cheesecake dessert menu.. there are so many too choose from! I can't wait to try it next time."
Luz O.,"Oceanside, CA",8,29,158,1.0,3/17/2014,Don't make a birthday event out of it. They don't take reservations and they don't do anything special for you. Lame
David B.,"San Marcos, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/24/2016,"Went for my 6th anniversary, the experience as a whole was poor. We stop in and put our name in, they text us when the table was ready, then the problems start.... They take us to a table that is not ready yet. We then have to wait out front for them to clean the table. We sir down the bring our drinks and the bread, but they never gave us knives for the butter. I have to flag down a waiter to get a bread knife. We order our food it comes out I ordered Chicken Piccata the pasta was crunchy like it had sat out and dried. I complained to the waiter, he took the pasta away and I waited for the replacement. My girlfriend eats about 1/3 of her food while I'm waiting on new paste. My new pasta arrives and it better but their was still a dried clump of pasta that I set aside. The manager comes by to apologized for the pasta being to al dente and I showed him the clump from the new batch and expanded that the first was dry not just a little under cooked. Desert was good their cheesecake is always good."
Tanya T.,"Oceanside, CA",36,19,1,1.0,6/4/2014,"Today we had a pretty awful experience. The waitress was annoying.  She have us the wrong drinks. Didn't check on us. Didn't refill.  The food was bland.  The waitress stuck her thumb in my cheese cake.  And to top it off we were surrounded by gnats... Yes. They were all over the place and if you look up at the walls they are all over the wall.. Disgusting and a total waste of $150. Should have went to BJ's After telling the manager about the bug issue- he did nothing but say ""sorry"""
Stephanie P.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/22/2015,Horrible experience here. The hostess was rude and looked super haggard and hungover. We were quoted 50 minutes for a wait for a party of six and in that time saw multiple groups of two and four come in after us and get sat when they could have pushed two tables together. A waitress overheard me complain and got the manager to come talk to us who clearly didn't care. Finally after about 80 minutes we got a table.
Luis M.,"Oceanside, CA",173,9,39,4.0,7/31/2014,1st time at the Escondido location. Dessert was amazing as always. Service at the cheesecake slice counter was horrible. Clerk seemed like she was annoyed and having a bad day. I got the chocolate Oreo cheesecake and my lady friend got the strawberry cheesecake. Both are to die for.
Rachelle-Brandon H.,"Fremont, CA",14,43,3,5.0,8/24/2015,Food is good but love their cheesecakes!!!! I generally come for just the cheesecakes or the fried Mac and cheese balls!
Leroy T.,"San Diego, CA",111,260,641,4.0,6/3/2014,Well Let Me Start off By saying this is the Spot !! I Came here to eat Dinner And what I have to say is I am really Impressed by How much food they give you !! First of all they give big Portions which I can not Complain !!

To Finish off the night of course you got to have there cheese cake !! So I top it off with a Cherry Cheese cake wow it just hit the spot !! Overall Good Place and I will for sure Return !!!
V A N E S S A R.,"San Diego, CA",279,17,,5.0,2/10/2014,"I was a bit skeptical to try out the new Cheesecake Factory in Escondido because since it's a new popular restaurant, it is quite a bit hectic when you walk in. You should definitely be prepared to wait, especially if you have a large group.  Surprisingly, the busy atmosphere was not an issue for the quality of service whatsoever! Our server Brenna was PHENOMINAL!! She was very knowledgeable of the menu, had great recommendations and was super attentive. It really does make a difference when you ask for lemons in your water, and they bring you a small cup with a handful of cut lemons. Or... before you even have to mention extra napkins, they are already placed at the end of the table. I don't think there was a moment when any of our drinks went past half empty.  Hopefully the rest of The Cheesecake Factory employees take note of Brenna's outstanding work ethic. There are SO many places to go out to for drinks or a bite to eat, that a little extra definitely makes a HUGE difference nowadays.  Thanks again Brenna! You were WONDERFUL!!! (The Bridal party group) :)"
Amalia K.,"Escondido, CA",3,26,20,5.0,8/21/2015,"Happy the location is nearby my home, great food, portions are more than enough... My fave server there is Ashley.ask for her section, she's so friendly, fast and has attention to detail. The only negative thing is their wait line out the door, but that's normal if the place is that great. I love going during happy hour. The foods so good... I'm getting hungry."
