Ryan C.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/5/2014,"Horrible service Food was cold Made us wait an entire hour just to sit, on accident Then, after we brought up the lack of service to the manager, there was no concern. Worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Never written a negative review on anyone but it was just that bad"
Julie W.,"Valley Center, CA",1,24,7,1.0,5/15/2015,"This place has the absolute worst management ever! Every time we come, there's a major issue. Always ruins our evening. I really hate this place!"
Jasmin O.,"Temecula, CA",2,1,,1.0,5/13/2015,"Service was horrible.. My lunch order was made wrong., server never filled my drink.. I have never had bad experience at any other locations. Just this one"
Thaleisha G.,"Murrieta, CA",84,7,3,1.0,7/11/2015,"I was super disappointed today with this place. My husband found a hair on his catfish and there was a bug on my calamari:( They must do better, but in the meantime I won't be back....EVER!!!"
Alicia C.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",51,155,374,4.0,6/5/2014,Food good. No toilet paper in ladies restroom....that bothers me alot.  And restroom was messy. No crayons n paper for kids. They provided us with reading glasses thats nice. I ask for fresh jalapeños but got vinegar jalapeño. All our food dishes were excellent.  I tried a sample of cilantro peanut dressing and loved it.
Brian M.,"Vista, CA",0,28,,1.0,6/2/2016,"Had positive experiences previously, but last one was disgusting. Tried roast beef sandwich and was not very good. The really bad part was fruit flies were all over our booth (alive and dead). It was nasty. Should have asked to move, but had started eating. If fruit flies are in the dining area, how bad is the kitchen? What is rotting back there? Told waitress about it and really didn't seem to care. We are considering not going back. DO NOT SIT BY WINDOW LOOKING INTO MALL ENTRY WAY."
Norman M.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,1,4.0,3/31/2014,"I see that quite a few people have had mixed results with TCF Escondido. I went Saturday night with another couple and the wait was really long, over ninety minutes, but they are now texting instead of using pagers so the girls could shop while the husbands had a drink in the bar.  Outdoor seating was comfortable and close enough to heaters. I've been to three other locations and my only gripe was that the portions were much smaller than I remember. Basket of fries and spicy cashew chicken were about half of what I would expect. Chicken and biscuits was large though and bread was fresh.  Service seemed fine and food was tasty overall. Avocado eggrolls are always the bomb as is the black pepper buttermilk ranch. Long waits and slow servers are totally expected in a popular mall on a Saturday night."
P S.,"Poway, CA",0,11,2,2.0,10/16/2015,"Service was very good. Do NOT get the french dip sandwich! The meat was chewy and full of un-chewable gristle. Dipping sauce was lots of soy sauce, no beef flavor. It was terrible! Gave it two stars for service and ambiance."
William P.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,188,14,3.0,3/3/2014,"Under construction for a loooooong time and finally opened. Went here for dinner on a Friday night and the wait time was about 60-80 minutes which was understandable given the amount of people waiting and how the restaurant remain packed even after we left. Super friendly and helpful host at the front desk. They take your phone number and you get a text message when your table is about ready so you're not left guessing when you should check back for your seats. Our server offered EXCEPTIONAL service throughout the meal and always checked up on us and made sure everything was perfect. Water cups were promptly refilled and orders were taken in a timely manner. The bread was brought out fresh and the table was set up perfectly. We ordered the salad, Fillet Mignon, Rib-Eye, and a Khulua Coffee Cocoa Cheesecake.  Salad: Very fresh, but the sauce was very lacking. Got to the end of the salad and there was almost no dressing left. Fillet Mignon: Ordered medium well, very tender and seared properly to keep the moisture inside.  Rib-Eye: Medium-well, a bit too dry for my taste and didn't seem like top quality meat. Cheesecake: no complaints here. Perfectly made and the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. I'll probably be back and nothing major to complain about besides some water spots on the silverware."
Adelaid G.,"Oceanside, CA",99,179,65,5.0,1/2/2015,"Have I ever eaten anything here that I did not like? The food here is so delicious! It is also completely fat and calorie filled but who is counting calories? I always sit at the bar when I come here because there's no way I'm going to wait an hour to be seated in the restaurant. If you do come here and I want to sit in the restaurant then I suggest that you put your name on the list way before you're even hungry. They'll take your phone number down and call you when your table is ready and then you can roam around the mall until your table is ready. They have a legit happy hour where some of their drinks and select house wines are $5. Their appetizers are also cheaper and the portions appear to look the same as a regularly priced appetizer portion. I have eaten a lot of the food and everything I've had is always good so just close your eyes and point somewhere on the menu and order it I'm sure it'll be delicious and you will love it. Try the farfalle pasta, it's to die for! If you share it with someone else you won't feel as guilty for all the calories. The fried mac & cheese balls are a must every time I come, my sister got the fried mac & cheese burger and she ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip the burger in. It sounds odd but you should try it. I never know which cheesecake to order they are all so good so again just point somewhere on the dessert menu and tell them to bring you that, then go home lay in your bed and rub your fat belly!"
Justine S.,"San Marcos, CA",1,25,2,5.0,9/30/2015,"On Sunday we went to have brunch & we received the best service ever by our server Bryce! He was so professional,  great manners, & very attentive. The food was also amazing & this location is absolutely beautiful. The cheesecake is to die for & it is a big portion!  I can't wait to dine there again!"
Melanie L.,"Kent, WA",39,10,,2.0,8/10/2015,"First time for me to be in the Cheesecake Factory.  It was also my sister and mothers first time too.  Factory burger that I ordered was too greasy, the bun it was on was odd shaped and really had to chew at it.  The fries were overly salty.  The waiter, though nice, was flighty and seemed to keep forgetting that our table was there. I've had better."
Jason I.,"San Diego, CA",53,27,22,5.0,12/3/2013,"PROS:  Everything we ordered was amazing. Get the Buffalo Blasts! Wait Staff were very attentive Place is new so cleanliness was impeccable  CONS: Wait Time, but I'm sure this will lessen as time goes If you are a North County resident, you already know we were dying for a spot like Cheesecake Factory to come in and raise the bar a bit.  We will be regulars for sure."
Melanie C.,"San Diego, CA",29,59,89,4.0,2/21/2014,"Nice store location. Very clean and customer service was great. I placed an order to-go cause I was shopping with my lovebug.  The portion on my lunch pasta was just right. They seem to give more food than CPK.    Delicious pastas, but watch out.. If you are counting calories, Farfalle Chicken with Roasted Garlic is over 2100 calories!!! :("
Kate S.,"Poway, CA",1,20,56,5.0,9/18/2015,"Came here for my son's birthday dinner tonight. This is where I go when I feel like pigging out!! The wait here is absolutely ABSURD! However, when it comes to food, I can wait! My favorite plates...Miso salmon..Jambalaya Pasta..Bang Bang shrimp..Mango/Luau Salad. We left with Red Velvet Cheesecake. Holy cow, one of the best Cheesecake that I've eaten in a long time. It was memorable bday dinner. You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory! So many things to choose from, great small plates and Cheesecake for days!! We're definitely coming back!!"
Brandon W.,"Dallas, TX",93,74,4,1.0,6/27/2015,Service was good so I should start with that. All of the food was not very good and my wife found two gnats in the harvest chicken salad. They did credit us back for that salad though.
Deirdre R.,"Poway, CA",2,75,,4.0,7/27/2015,"This is a GREAT location of the Cheesecake Factory.  Friendly staff, generally timely service, fun atmosphere.  I prefer this Cheesecake Factory to BJ's across the parking lot.  Different vibes, but I find myself a the Cheesecake Factory much more often than BJ's.  The neat thing about this and all Cheesecake Factories is the number of menu items and the ability of the staff to vary the ingredients of a good number of items to taste.   There is truly something here for everyone."
Marianne I.,"Temecula, CA",6,7,,4.0,7/23/2015,"Arrived here at 5:10 pm and by 5:28 our order was hot, fresh and on the table. The Club was delicious and large enough to feed 2 or 3 of me. My companion (my 7 year old granddaughter) loved her mini corn dogs but felt that the thin, sharp sticks they are served on could be a bit dangerous to the under 7 crowd :-)"
Mel F.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,77,57,3.0,4/20/2014,"Our server was super nice!! We sat outside the patio for Easter brunch. It was very busy! Despite the chaos, she was very attentive to our needs. We were sent out without set ups, which was not a big deal ... until our entrees came.  Appetizer: Avocado egg rolls. They were good! I'd buy it again.  Entrees: My dad got the katsu, which it said was good. Except the sauce was very salty. My mom enjoyed her carbonara. My brother enjoyed his burger. My husband ordered the Baja chicken hash from the brunch menu. He barely had chicken in his dish and it was very salty. I ordered the crab hash and it was doused with pepper. I like spicy, but this was just an over load of pepper, and yes ... they use real crab.  We tipped our server 20% because she was attentive and very kind. I am giving it three stars because the food was not as good as it was my last visit."
Sabz S.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/24/2016,"I ordered for pick-up so, this rating is solely based on the food. My family ordered the GF Turkey Burger and the Thai Salmon, which they seemed to enjoy. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. In the description it mentioned that the shrimp is marinated in a ""Very Spicy Jamaican Black Pepper Sauce."" I ordered it because I thought it was spicy. I even added some hot sauce and still the sweetness of the shrimp sauce was overbearing. The shrimp was very sweet and there wasn't even the slightest amount of kick to it. Therefore the pineapple and plantains on the side did not go well with the sweet shrimp. The whole dish was too sweet. The black beans and rice were like any other black beans and rice. It's hard to mess those up, but they were good. I love cheesecake factory, but this dish just wasn't up to par with what I'm used to. The description of the dish needs to be changed. I will probably go with my regular favorites from the restaurant next time."
