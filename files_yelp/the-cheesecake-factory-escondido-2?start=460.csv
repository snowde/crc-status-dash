Beth L.,"San Marcos, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/25/2015,SLOW!!!!!! Oh my gosh. I know the menu is  wwaayyy too big and it takes the average person a long time to go through all the pages and order.  But it tskes 25 mins for the apps to come out and then the burgers are right behind. Food is good just takes a while in my opinion
Dean B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,1,2.0,8/23/2015,Curbside to go is a joke on weekends.  15 minutes on BRIEF hold to order.  Waiting again to pick up food so long went inside to use filthy bathroom with overflowing trash cans.  Food is great but this Escondido restaurant needs A NEW MANAGER!
Cassandra R.,"Escondido, CA",110,170,19,2.0,11/23/2014,"Can somebody just ixnay the management from this place and start over?  I love TCF.  Quality and variety are always a few steps above other chains.  Usually, you can count on pretty good service, too.  The bartenders always have their sh*t together.  The servers in the dining area, however, fugghedaboudit.  Been here several times, and the wait staff is always completely abysmal.  Forgetting things, bringing the wrong things, disappearing for waaaaaay too long.  Eat at the bar or go to a different location."
Richard A.,"Austin, TX",0,10,,3.0,4/7/2016,"It used to be great, but the menu is soooo big that they have a hard time with consistency.  One visit it's great, then next it's awful.  Safer to just have two slices of cheesecake.  Can't miss, and you won't go hungry."
Chris R.,"San Diego, CA",134,17,1,3.0,5/25/2015,Food and service really good. Way too bright in this place I had to wear sunglasses inside. Get some blinds or tint pls.
B K.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,1,5.0,4/4/2016,"Well, had to drop a quick review on our happy hour experience. First, no wait. Arrived around five-ish and we're promptly escorted to a bar side table. My wife and I ordered the ""happy hour cheeseburger"". Wow! Absolutely delicious! Old school style with two beef patties, which were very juicy. Two slices of American cheese just added to the taste factor. The bun was soft and and toasted to perfection. Service was great, too, which is always appreciated. Oh, and did I mention it's only $5.50? Total bargain! Beware, it's very filling! No cheesecake, too full. We'll be back."
Stephanie P.,"Escondido, CA",4,13,,5.0,6/20/2015,"This was my first time in and let's just start with their patio seating, I love it! It's so comfortable. The manager was awesome. One of our appetizers wasn't ready to come out with my other two appetizers and she came over to my table just to tell me that. Very sweet of her. Food timing is great. Drinks were brought to our table right away. Appetizers took about 10 min and then our entrees came shortly after. Great service, great food :)"
Mary E.,"Escondido, CA",0,5,,4.0,5/14/2016,Cheesecake Factory has the most delicious Pasta Carbonara!  Service was terrific.
Klarissa C.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",0,7,9,3.0,7/29/2015,"Had to wait 45 minutes for a table, then once we sat down it was another at least another 30 to get drinks and order. We got our food like an hour and a half later. So over all it was just super slow, the food was good though."
Shahid S.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/31/2015,Pathetic and lousy service. They made us wait for 30 minutes while families came after us got the seating. It was apparent we were not welcome. I am not going back there for sure.
NaitsirhC Ma I.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",47,32,12,3.0,11/30/2013,"Beautiful as their other facilities.  Food come out in huge portions as always.. And the service, very courteous..  So why not 5 Stars??  Well.. Because multiple servers kept coming to our table to drop off food we didn't order.. And to others as well.. And when we wanted our actual server, he was too busy to stop by..  We also wanted a particular cheesecake and was told they no longer carry it.. Problem was, my wife and I saw the cheesecake in the display case.. So our server had to check and lo & behold, they had it.. =\.. I guess I should be thankful that they packed our food's leftover dipping sauces in a tiny container.. ALL HALF A TEASPOON OF IT.."
Monique M.,"Vista, CA",9,11,,5.0,4/18/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is by far my favorite restaurant of all time.  The service is always outstanding and the choice of dishes is mind boggling--literally something for everyone.  We have never had a bad experience in any of the many locations at which we've dined -- from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.   Saturday night was our first time at the Escondido location and we were not disappointed.  We were texted that our table was ready 10 minutes earlier than expected  --  food was awesome and the service was top notch.  Check out their sister restaurant The Grand Lux at the Venetian as well.
Kayleena S.,"San Diego, CA",104,233,69,4.0,2/21/2015,First visit to this location.  It was a pleasant visit and we sat outside although it was later afternoon.  The seating outside is superb and in my opinion gives you more privacy and space than inside. All of the food was prompt however I was disappointed that after asking for well done my burger came very pink.  Our waitress seemed to be new and had way too many tables for her to handle but when she did come by she was very personable.  Cheesecake of course was divine! We will visit again without a doubt.
Sharon K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/18/2015,Ate here today and could not wait to get home to write about our great experience.  I had been missing the Cheesecake food as we have moved away from our local ones.  First time at the Escondido branch and Eric the bartender/waiter and the manager who patiently find the sports channel we needed could not have been any nicer.  The food was better than ever - just love those Thai Lettuce Wraps and this branch does them really well and hubby loved his avacado egg rolls.  Perfect lunch and thanks again for the excellent service and food.
Melanie H.,"San Diego, CA",22,72,1,2.0,11/8/2014,"Cheesecake is tasty, but the service at the cake counter sucks. They hardly acknowledge your presence and then act like you're interrupting them when they take your order."
Lewis F.,"San Diego, CA",7,11,5,5.0,4/24/2014,"One of the best places for a birthday dinner. It was great. Our server was super nice. I ordered the crab cake bites and my friend got the chicken potstickers for starters. It was all good and very flavorful. For dinner I got steak Diane and chicken Madeira combo. My friend got the steak Diane mashed potatoes. The steaks were cooked perfectly as we wanted them. Our server checked on us a few times and made sure everything was good and if we were satisfied. Then came the cheesecake. We ordered the red velvet cheesecake, dulce de leche and lemoncello creme torte. They were all so yummy. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations but this one has the best cheesecakes by far. Overall it was a great place for dining. Great food. Great service. Friendly atmosphere. Will be going there a lot more times and we plan on taking more people with us."
Patricia M.,"San Diego, CA",3,16,31,4.0,3/27/2014,The food at The Cheesecake Factory was very tasty. Service was very professional &  accommodating. I'm just sad that they only allow service dogs to their restaurant. :-(
Melanie B.,"San Diego, CA",0,56,,1.0,1/11/2016,"The food took forever and our server, Robert, got an attitude when we asked for a timeframe. I ordered the veggie burger and he literally plopped it in front of me - forgetting the salad of course - and not asking if I wanted any condiments.  My husbands salmon came out 10 minutes after mine and he said it was good. I spoke to the manager and she credited me $3 for the salad. We were very disappointed and we definitely won't be going back!"
Casey W.,"Long Beach, CA",24,28,,3.0,2/19/2014,"Great food, not so great service. We didn't receive silverware until we asked after already receiving our meals. Took about 20 minutes to get a simple glass of water. The check from the previous guests sat on our table for about 10 minutes. The couple next to us seemed to be having the same issue. Ended up having to take our meal to go because we were running short on time.  I would suggest ordering out and enjoying your food on your schedule."
Debra W.,"Escondido, CA",25,185,613,4.0,2/27/2014,"I'll give four stars only because we were seated in a terrible area. First we sat down the heater didn't cover us ( they need heaters that point down to the customers) that will really keep them warm, second we were sat by the door where the host walks people through. Every time she opened the door a big rush of cold air would flow through and hit us. Last but not least my husband had the perfect view of random people walking by into the mall. He felt distracted with all the movement (this can be fixed by adding taller plants). There was a party of teenage girls talking really loud and squilling majority of the time we were here until they decided not to wait a 1 1/2 to sit. THANK GOD! All these things can be fix it they took it upon themselves to do so. But so far the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek, Ca is by far the best!    Now the food, the food was moderate I would rather go to Applebee's down here before I suggest here again. The visit made me look dumb because I've had better and I talked about how great the experience was.    Our server was okay, she didn't wow us. She kept telling us our bread was ready but at the same time she kept saying it wasn't ready. My ribeye got cold before I could get my mac n cheese. Like I said it didn't wow me."
