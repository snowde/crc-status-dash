Larry C.,"San Clemente, CA",0,2,,4.0,6/29/2015,Fabulous food.  Great service.  They handle lines so well.  The service is always been consistent. I would like to see more new items and more healthy choices.
Amanda S.,"Valley Center, CA",23,75,9,4.0,1/26/2014,"I'd like to give them 3&1/2 stars. The long wait expected but nonetheless ridiculous.  2 hours!  Luckily we weren't starving when we checked in. We walked around the mall, did some shopping.  Finally as we waited around with hungry, cranky people who looked like they had won the lottery when they got their ""your table is ready"" we asked for first available seating so lucky us, were seated in the patio   there are patio heaters but it was still cold. Our waitress was nice but forgetful. The food was good.  So if you have a lot of time on your hands ( 3 +hours from check in to check out) Then by all means go for it."
Joe M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/1/2016,"Not a restarant for more than a group of 6.  We had a group of 12. Called at 11 that day to make reservations. I was informed they do not make reservations. I let them know that 12 people would be there at 4 that afternoon and was told ""you will just have to wait like everyone else."" We arrived at 335. Gave them our name there was no wait time at that time. Was told they had to speak with the manager. They returned saying it would be 1 1/2 hours to 1 3/4 hours. We waited as it was my son's birthday and he had picked the place.we Checked in after 1 hour and was told rudely that we were told 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours that our time wasn't up yet. However, they continued to seat groups of 5 or 6 next to each other. We finally got the text that our table was ready 1 hour and 40 minutes later. Then at the desk one person said it was wrong our table was not ready just as another came up and said the table for 12 was ready but she couldn't find the group. Dinner took 2 1/2 hours to get served with food coming out at different times and some of the party had finished dessert before others had even been served their dessert. Not a good day for Cheesecake Factory in Escondido. They need to get their act together and hire people that know what they are doing at the front desk."
Marisol M.,"Escondido, CA",37,28,,4.0,4/20/2016,Quality food! Yummy desserts and drinks. Price is reasonable.
Meridian G.,"Escondido, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/4/2015,"Absolutely love this place.  Love love love.  Service is great,  food is even better.  Everyone here really knows hospitality.  I highly recommend it to anyone passing through and looking for some excellent food. And it is located in the mall! Did some nice shopping afterward. Just in love with this place.  I will definitely be back."
Sandy J.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",16,6,6,4.0,3/10/2014,"Having lunch during the week is the best due to the fact that you don't have to wait more than an hour to be seated, like you would have to if you go during dinner time. My visit here is always pleasant. Host is always very friendly and most of the time our server is extremely nice, but not with my visit today.  My server named Priscilla was friendly but kept forgetting about my party. She completely forgot about my drink, I had to remind her about it 15mins later. When she picked up our plates she brought us our bill right away .. Didn't bother to ask us if we wanted dessert, which is one of the reasons why we always go there. I hope my next visit is better. I would be upset if it's not since it's one of my fav. places. Their food is delicious!! ( HandsDown they have the best cheesecake)"
Enrique A.,"Ramona, CA",2,22,2,1.0,4/9/2016,This place is always understaffed and the service is getting worse each time we come. Lots of empty tables despite making customers wait on average 20 minutes. Perhaps the owners should consider hiring more staff both in the kitchen and in the kitchen. Some of the staff need to go to customer service school.
Angel R.,"San Diego, CA",249,133,173,4.0,12/2/2013,"Came here yesterday with my family for lunch. Like with all Cheesecake Factory locations, they don't take reservations, and it's first come first served. However, expect to wait a bit longer, this restaurant is smaller compared to the Fashion Valley location. They're still working out the kinks because it's a newly opened restaurant, cut them some slack! The food was great, and served in humongous portions, as per usual. I'll definitely be coming back now that I no longer have to commute down to Fashion Valley!"
Sue O.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/23/2015,"My friend & I went to have a late lunch yesterday & I ordered the Harvest Chicken Salad. I usually in the past have avoided ordering anything chicken anywhere because it usually comes very dry. But I consider this a 'nice' restaurant & assumed that the chefs knew how to prepare a juicy chicken breast....wrong. I advised my waiter that I loved the salad but the chicken was very dry, he apologized & came back & said that the chef put another piece on the grill, should be ready soon.  2nd piece was ice cold & just as dry----a manager came by I told her what happened & that I was done now & wanted to box my salad but 'lets forget about the chicken' she apologized & boxed it, my waiter gave us the bill for the full amount.....no discount or offer of cheesecake....that's why I'm telling my story here."
Mariana L.,"San Diego, CA",89,24,42,4.0,2/16/2014,I love the food at the Cheesecake factory and visit the one in Mission Valley all the time. This location is smaller and our wait time was 40 minutes during the day time. It looked like they had a black friday sale with all the people waiting outside. Still the food was delicious and our server was top notch.We'll be back.
Ash P.,"San Diego, CA",6,24,4,5.0,3/17/2015,Great service. Less crowded than the fashion valley one. Love cashew chicken and shrimp bacon sandwich but I never have enough room after the dark bread and butter.
Jennifer A.,"San Marcos, CA",39,48,28,5.0,7/31/2014,"I'm impressed! Tonight I went in for the first time with my 4 kids for dinner to celebrate my birthday. We had appetizers (buffalo wings something & ahi with avocado) which were amazing.  Caesar salad which was delicious and of course we all ordered different items but I had the salmon & shrimp scampi and it was great too! It's rare you go somewhere and every aspect is right on, must have been our lucky night :) our server was David, he was polite and very attentive!  We never had to flag someone down or wait an extremely long time for anything.  It really was quite perfect  oh, and I had their original cheesecake. ..TO DIE FOR...seriously everything was great. I am a raving fan after tonight :) Also to note: It was pretty packed & the wait was 45 min for a table of 5 but they take your cell # and text you when you're table is ready so we just shopped at the mall for a half hour while we waited - that was great, especially having kids with me we didn't have to just sit there the whole time waiting.  I definitely recommend coming here, it's well worth the wait and the price."
Kaitlyn W.,"San Diego, CA",4,14,6,2.0,7/19/2014,"First, let me just start out that the burger that I ordered was delicious. I had the Americano Burger and added egg on top - and it was wonderful. The reason that I gave this place two stars was HORRIBLE service.  The waitress that we had (I don't remember her name, but had short bright red hair - started with a 'T' if I remember correctly) was the worst that I have ever experienced. We waited about 20 minutes to sit down, which was completely reasonable on a Saturday so that was fine. Once we were seated I think we saw our actual waitress about 3 times total in the TWO hours that we were there.  It took about 30 minutes to have our drinks ordered, and about another 15 for them to be delivered to us with the bread. The white bread was horribly over cooked and tasted like it had been sitting in the oven for about an hour. Whole wheat bread on the other hand was amazing. When We ordered our drinks my sister had a water with lemon - but when it was delivered there was no lemon. Something that isn't very hard to manage. Mind you there was another man who delivered the drinks, not our waitress.  Shortly after getting drinks we placed our order (one Americano Burger - medium - with egg no tomatoes or onion, and a side salad. my sister ordered the Classic Burger -medium -  with a side of fries) It took ONE HOUR to get our food, not seeing our waitress one single time to check in on us, refill drinks, clear the table of the bread, or give us any update on how much longer.  Once we finally received the food the burgers were both cooked well done. I never received my side salad and there was about one squirt of ketchup for my sisters fries and burger. We flagged down the waitress, once again because she never checked on us, and asked for more ketchup, our drinks refilled and my salad. She made a sly comment that the kitchen staff wasn't really on their game today, which to me was a piss poor excuse as to why the service was terrible. Mind you my drink had been empty since the food was delivered. This was the last time that we saw our waitress. A busboy delivered my salad and the manager came out with our drinks. Thats when we asked for the Recees cheesecake and our check because we knew that it was going to take about another 30 minutes to receive both. The manager came out again with the desert about 25 minutes after we asked for it with the check. We did leave a note for the waitress thanking her for forgetting about us.  Under no circumstances is it okay to come to the guests only three times, one for getting our drink order, another for the food order, and once being flagged down by the guests. If we hadn't flagged her down I can guarantee that she would not have been at our table again. We were not demanding to her or spoke to her in any tone, so this was a terrible experience at such a common restaurant with decent reviews. It will be a while before I will return to the Escondido location - I would much rather drive to Fashion Valley to be respected as a paying customer rather than a hassle that you have to tend to."
Amanda H.,"Vista, CA",25,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Worst service , we had the pleasure of getting Desirae, she had the nerve to get upset with us because my friend was taking time to finish her food, so she decided to just not check on us for over 30 minutes.  When we asked where she was to the manager she came over and passive agressivly told us she was letting our friend finish.  Her tone was rude and did it right in front of her manager, who later apologized for her rude behavior.  If she's comfortable being  rude to customers in front of management,  what does that tell you about their customer service?  We frequent this location,  I will never go back to the CF in escondido."
Miriam M.,"Vista, CA",36,2,3,4.0,1/25/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has to be one of my favorite places to eat. We were so happy to find a new location opened in North County San Diego. After reading all the awful reviews we wanted to make our own opinion. Wait wasn't bad at all. Only 15 minutes for family of 4. Server was awesome!  Food was as expected, delicious! I only gave a 4 rating, because the sweet potato fries didn't come at the time the hamburger was delivered because I guess they were over done. So by the time they brought them, my husband had already eaten it. Also, we ordered a side of grilled chicken to go with my son's pasta that never made it out.  Other than those two kinks, can't complain. We'll be back!"
Ann P.,"Washington, DC",0,12,4,2.0,1/21/2015,"It's your basic Cheesecake Factory. Seen one, seen them all. Hardly worth the wait and pricey for what you get in terms of taste, portion and service, all average. BJ's and Elephant Bar much better. The cheesecake is the biggest joke. You'd think if they were going to cut corners it wouldn't be with the deserts, especially the cheesecake. The slices are very small for the price. Plus I think they're trying to create an illusion of a larger slice by putting whip cream all around it. HA! Don't be fooled."
Patty L.,"La Jolla, CA",9,110,1,5.0,12/11/2015,"This place has definitely improved. Definitely better chefs. The steaks were juicer. The burger tastier! And yes, much better service."
Shirin A.,"San Diego, CA",4,74,66,2.0,11/16/2014,"I used to be a fan of Cheesecake Factory but after dining in this location I changed my mind. Bartenders are good, kind of slow but food takes at least 40 mins to arrive, they bring your steak and fries 15 minutes later. Everything is slow. You gotta wait for a very long time yo get your desert too... over all, I wouldn't recommend this location."
Jasmine R.,"Anza, CA",20,11,1,5.0,2/2/2015,Go for happy hour in the bar it will not disappoint! The bartenders are friendly and helpful.
Azadeh M.,"Escondido, CA",25,2,,4.0,4/30/2015,"The food is  awesome , the staff are friendly and polite , the only thing bother me every time I go the waiting time is so long , my appetite almost dies when I get a table , not cool"
