Katherine M.,"Anaheim, CA",1,3,,5.0,12/6/2013,"I have gone to several different locations of The Cheesecake Factory but this one was most accommodating by far.  I have a lot of allergies as well as other dietary needs which always causes me trouble when I go out to eat, especially when a majority of the entrées include meat or nut products. As per usual, I let the server know and she came back with a manager who then helped me make my dinner choice. When my god came, the manager himself brought out my food and ensured that everything was perfect. Overall the wait was a little long but it was well worth it because the food and service was excellent."
Mark R.,"San Diego, CA",9,10,7,3.0,8/16/2014,The size of this Cheesecake Factory is more suited for an airport terminal. Expect longer waits than you would at Mission Valley or even Chula Vista.
Roy A.,"San Diego, CA",4,97,,5.0,7/10/2014,"The food is outstanding, the management and staff are wonderful as well! Perfect for date nights, group parties, or just dining solo!"
Monica O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,,4.0,8/23/2014,"First time dining at The Cheesecake Factory. I had the garlic noodles with shrimp, asparagus, mushrooms and roasted tomatoes. It was delicious! I had the half portion, but it was still a lot of food. Will definitely be visiting this restaurant again to try other dishes.  The only reason I didn't give this review 5 stars is because there were small flies around our booth. I had to swat them away at least 5 times."
Ricky C.,"Temecula, CA",0,12,,5.0,3/7/2015,"Really loved the food. Went here to celebrate my mom's birthday. It's nice that you receive a text when tables become available. The wait was long, however.The food really made up for it though.  Everything was delicious."
Katie C.,"San Diego, CA",1,42,124,1.0,6/15/2015,So I went to lunch with my 2 year old son and niece today at 11 (it was pre lunch rush... Not busy at all) Both kids ordered elbow pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese. When my son and niece were eating I noticed this black slimy looking goop in the creases of a few of the noodles on both of their plates. so obviously not knowing what this mystery substance was I sent them both back my niece was starving so I had them re make her order and I just fed my son half of my lunch so I could avoid a meltdown. Anyways the manager came over and tried to tell us it was a basil leaf that fell into the pot of boiling water. I have never seen basil turn to the consistency of black pudding so I'm still not sure if I buy that excuse. When I went to pay the bill I noticed they had charged me for 3 kids pastas and only comped 1 even though we only ended up eating 1 kids pasta. So after much confusion and delay having to send dishes back and wait for them to fix my bill I left pretty disappointed with how they handled the whole situation. I will not be back!!!
Dav M.,"San Diego, CA",10,62,,2.0,9/1/2014,"Ordinary food at extraordinary prices with the mediocre service. It's weird, this is the type of experience I would expect at Dick's Last Resort. Naturally, I understand they're completely slammed for business, but if you're going to suck, why be a waiter or waitress in the first place? OK, I gotta give it up for whoever did the Alice in Wonderland interior though, that's pretty nice...but not why I went there."
Michelle M.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/6/2015,"We've been coming to this place since they first open and always had a great time and service. But sad to say today's experiences was awful. Customer service was horrible. After getting seated at the table, we waited 15mins with no service so my husband had to go inside and request a server, and after all that nothing changed. To make things worst everyone that got seated after Us Got their drinks and food first!!! Like are you kidding me....then we get our food after about 45mins and our server didn't even come by to ask if our food was ok or if we needed anything. We had to flag him down. Be said, this place is pretty pricy for their food, but we're fine with that but service sucked."
Connie S.,"Escondido, CA",6,31,5,5.0,12/6/2014,"Thanks to The Cheesecake Factory, Sabrina had a wonderful 22 birthday with family at home. We brought food home, enjoyed every bite. Well come by there ,many more times."
Tracey A.,"San Diego, CA",3,44,54,4.0,8/28/2014,"We've been to the CF many times & always found the service excellent, great selection of food, reasonable prices & a very pleasing decor!!!  The bread is a nice touch & very tasty to start out the meal.  We are super glad there is a local restaurant now...we'll be back!!!"
Mariah A.,"San Marcos, CA",2,24,33,3.0,1/4/2015,I think this place is overrated. The food I've had is eh which makes the prices seem ridiculous. Atmosphere is noisy but it's alright. Everything is clean. The cheesecakes are probably the most delicious part. I'm just not a fan.
Jason K.,"Sun City, CA",0,12,8,5.0,12/26/2013,The spicy chicken Chipotle pasta was really good and my girlfriend said the turkey burger was amazing!! Highly recommend sitting outside bc ppl watching was our entertainment! Our waitress was on point and always around making sure our drinks were filled!
Roseann J.,"Sun City, CA",10,29,7,2.0,8/15/2015,"I have been to many CCF locations. This one had to be the worst!  We got there, as always, I requested a booth. Told the wait would be about 15min wait and I would receive a text when my table was ready.  After about 10 min, got a text, proceeded to the counter, and nothing. After another few minutes pass, a very arrogant young man told me it would be a few more minutes. Then the same arrogant young man took us to our table. He takes us to half booth half table. I said NO, we waited about 20 minutes at this point.  He then tells us it will be a longer wait since they have to clean tables. The original hostess did apologize for the error. After a 30 min wait, we are finally seated, order, and are patiently waiting for our pot stickers, when to our surprise, out comes our entree. I ask about the appetizer, server told us she would check on it....The manager then brought them out, apologized and too them off the bill. Good gesture since I had just said to cancel them.  The food was good but the overall service needs lots of work!! Just too many mistakes and too much attitude!"
Bryan H.,"San Marcos, CA",87,2,6,1.0,2/18/2014,"So I took my wife to dinner for her birthday. she was pretty excited to go to the Cheesecake factory. So too were hundreds of other people. Thats okay, we expected a wait. After an hour we were called and lead out to the patio where we sat in the cold while the temps outside were in the 50's (during the recent cold snap). Wouldn't have been a big deal if the lantern things would have heated the patio, or if we'd brought sweatshirts, but we got to shivering within about 20 minutes.  Our waitress was very attentive and got us an order of nachos while we looked over the menu for our main meal. The nachos were pretty good at first but as they cooled they got bland and gross. Our meal took 40 minutes to arrive. And my plate was completely wrong. Another 20 minutes and my wife was done eating and they brought out my meal - on a plate. Not in a to go box as was asked for. Then shortly before we left a manager came over to us and apologized and walked away. No offer of a discount, or a free meal, or a pick a desert on us free. Nothin'. Just, ""hey we're really sorry, we dont know what happened...""  I've had poor dining experiences before. In fact I seem to be cursed to always be the guy whose order is forgotten or screwed up. But I have never gotten such a combination of bad stuff going down and such a weak apology. I will never choose to eat at the Cheesecake Factory again."
Maggie J.,"San Marcos, CA",3,16,,5.0,1/29/2016,"Great food! Large selection of delicious cheesecake, of course! Nice place to celebrate with friends. You might need to wait for a table, though..."
Kelsey K.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",1,20,16,1.0,5/22/2015,"Buyer beware! I came here to celebrate my little sisters 18th birthday on a weekday evening. I set up the ""birthday dessert"" and song before she even arrived to the restaurant. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all. We had to flag down two other employees to get service mid-meal. My sister in law ordered extra sauce with her pasta and didn't receive it till we finished eating. Then as we waited patiently for the bday dessert they completely dropped the ball, no dessert, no happy birthday song. After ordering a regular dessert for her, and waiting a good 30 mins more for the bill my brother and I got fed up and went to the hostess desk to pay our bill. We split it, he paid $80 cash I paid the rest on my card. Unfortunately I didn't notice it till the next day, but they charged my card $10 more than they were supposed to, I called the store to have it fixed. Checked my statement two weeks later, nothing was fixed!! So I contacted corporate, the esco store manager contacted me, and still didn't fix the problem!!! Told me because I signed for the $10 more I should have caught it. Scammed me out of $10, which isn't much but scamming is scamming!!! Then mailed me a $20 gift card, because after getting horrible service and scammed I really wanna spend another minute at your business. I will never spend a dollar with this company, and even when going to their corporate offices, I was still contacted by the store, and my issue was not resolved!!!!!! Don't go here unless you don't give a shit about service or $$!!"
Dan L.,"San Diego, CA",19,40,46,2.0,7/21/2014,Service was really slow. Had to keep flagging people down to get anything. Food took forever to arrive but was good. It was my wife's birthday. I told them on the way in and told our waitress. Not one person said Happy Birthday to her or even acknowledged it. We will celebrate special occasions elsewhere from now on. Bad form CF :(
Jay P.,"Oceanside, CA",85,24,10,3.0,4/11/2014,"Up and down experience, ending with a huge uplifting shift change.  Started out with a crappy waitress who didn't get us a starter water or our bread appetizers.  She was nearing the end of her shift, and I get that you get tired and stuff by that time, but she had minimal regard and minimal attentiveness for her customers.  Then came Jeremy K, who was awesome and asked personal questions and built a huge rapport with our party of 7 midway through our bummer experience.  The food was delicious (I got the garlic noodles with shrimp) and the drinks were pretty bomb too.  If it weren't for Mr. Clean jr, Jeremy, I would have given 2 stars.  If we started out with Jeremy, it would have been an easy 5 star review.  Jeremy, you rule.  Chick before Jeremy, who didn't take the time to even give us a name, you probably rule too when you're on, but today you kinda blew it."
kip w.,"Escondido, CA",0,22,,4.0,5/31/2014,"We ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Escondido last night and I was really surprised at how good the food was. I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was excellent. Tender, juicy, a smoky flavor that was very smooth and a sweet sauce that actually complemented the meat. So often sauces overpower the meat (just as well as often the meat is crappy) but in this instance it was a perfect balance. My wife had the Pit Beef Dip. Man that was a huge success. Again the sauce (au jus) was really great. Lots of flavor and well seasoned. The meat was tasty, fontina cheese was an excellent accompaniment, the horseradish sauce was tangy without being overbearing. In general I find Escondido to be a food wasteland, so this was a pleasant surprise. The sandwiches were well thought out and well executed. Last week we ate at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in Vegas and the flavor profiles at the Cheesecake factory were more interesting and better layered. They have a huge selection of food which is nice as so many chain restaurants do ""theme"" food like Mexican or Italian. My only gripe was that they had a huge selection of chicken dishes but very few beef or pork choices. How excited can you get about chicken? Oh yeah we got a slice of the Chocolate Fudge Tower cake to take home. It was huge, moist, thick and fudgy and was definitely a wow finish. We'll go back and try some other stuff"
Sam S.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/21/2016,"This place has excellent burgers, but they aren't worth the wait. Two visits ago, I ordered a well done Old fashioned or classic burger, which is very thick and delicious, as I always did. I ordered it 100% plain, the easiest order ever. When everyone else's food came, they informed me they had accidentally put cheese on my burger and started cooking me a new one, and said it would be 40 minutes to an hour. Considering it had already been 40 minutes to an hour, I decided to settle for an order of kids chicken strips. 40 minutes to an hour later, they also brought me a burger. When we paid, they had comped the chicken strips and the burger, plus given me a free slice of cheesecake. Fast forward to our next and final visit. Since I gave them the benefit of the doubt, I ordered the same thing as last time. Another person ordered the same thing with everything on it except cheese. When our meals come, I surprisingly get exactly what I ordered, and once all but the other burger arrives they inform us the other burger had cheese put on it. So she said she'd just take chicken strips as a substitute, which took about 20-30 minutes. None of us had eaten during this time, so all our food was cold by the time we could eat together. At the end of the meal, no burger had arrived or cheesecake been given to us. When we were paying, I checked the receipt, and they had charged us for the substitute chicken strips. We had the newer but not new manager come over to our table and explained to her our problem. She seemed less than apologetic, though she did unhappily comp the chicken strips. At this point, we didn't even mention the salad they had messed up and simply left. I can proudly say we will never come back to this location again. The single star given is for the delicious food. If you are in this area, I would suggest BJ's or another one of the many restaurants in the area, rather than waiting over an hour and a half for a burger."
