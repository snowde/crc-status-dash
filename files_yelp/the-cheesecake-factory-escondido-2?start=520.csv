Bro H.,"Escondido, CA",2,7,,5.0,10/23/2014,Love love love the bang bang chicken and the banana cream cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is always consistent always good! If are looking for good food and nice atmosphere this is the place you want to go!!!!
Marilyn K.,"San Diego, CA",5,18,4,5.0,5/10/2014,I love this place. I love their skinnylicious menu options for a health nut like me. The wait is usually an hour in the evenings but i go shopping and take my kids to the playground in the meantime. They text me when my table is ready which I love. The one on Friars doesn't do that so I go to this one.  Not to mention the desert options are what makes me a huge fan!
Josh S.,"Escondido, CA",1,14,,3.0,1/10/2015,"People who came in after us got seated first.. Food was so so. Stuffed mushroom appetizer probably the only good thing, though we've had better at other restaurants such as BJ's. We ordered margherita pizza and there's barely any basil leaves and mozzarella cheese on it, and it's very salty. The black beans and rice that came with the fish tacos were under cooked. Fish tacos should have came with two tortillas per taco instead of one became very soggy quick. Waiter was exceptional did a very good job of paying attention to us even took our picture. Will give a second try in a couple of months; see if I get their act together."
Kimberly M.,"Poway, CA",40,37,29,4.0,6/25/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I'm so happy to see that they finally got one closer to me. The wait staff are always friendly and I never have a problem with them messing up my orders. The only thing I could complain about is that sometimes I come here and it is soooo packed that it takes a good while before you can head inside to be sat. If it were a bigger place, I'm sure that wouldn't happen often but this location is pretty small for a Cheesecake Factory. When I order I usually get the buffalo blasts as and appetizer and they are never skimpy on those. I always have plenty to take home. My go to dinner is the meatloaf. I usually don't trust meatloaf unless it's mine but one day I was really craving it and I came here so I thought, ""why not"" and ordered it. I have no regrets. Super delicious. Most of the other food I've ordered is above average  but nothing stands out here other than the few things I normally order. I never have enough room for cheesecake unfortunately. But this place is pretty cool in my book."
Marissa M.,"Temecula, CA",23,33,51,4.0,8/10/2014,"Visited tonight for a Birthday dinner for my sister, had to wait almost 2 hours for a table for seven people after being told a wait time of about an hour to an hour and a half; despite that the service was amazing, the dinner and cheesecake was excellent!"
Denise N.,"Sun City, CA",0,196,1,4.0,5/3/2015,Tex Mex eggrolls were delicious. We ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the cajun chicken littles. We also took home the lemoncello torte.  Everything including the service was good.  It is prom night...so lots of high school kids were there. We beat the rush because we got there at 5:30. Definitely a great place to eat at after a day at the san diego safari park.
Kathryn G.,"Escondido, CA",44,9,,5.0,4/6/2014,"Hubby and I went on Sunday night and sat at the bar. Had wonderful service!!! Food was great I had the seared tuna salad. WOW!!!! Was sooooo good! Bottom line great service and great food!!! The place is beautiful too. Jeff was the bartender, he was awesome!!!!"
Ryan T.,"Escondido, CA",7,34,32,3.0,9/26/2014,"THe cheesecake menu is divine. Whats not to like about a page and a half of different cheesecakes on a menu. ?  Great stuff!  My BIGGEST bone to pick with the cheesecake factory is the menu. I've been to the Cheesecake factory about 15-20 times. So, to say i'm not a fan isnt fair. I'm  really torn about giving The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars or 4 stars. I JUST LOVE CHEESECAKE!  Its a weakness of mine. But with 13 pages of food menu with 30+ different dishes at 13$ + per dish, you HAVE to master all these dishes. I try to order something different all the time but with the prices they charge, it's just risky...  Here's the thing.  - The burgers are different. Some are good but thats as far as the burger menu can go.  -The salad menu is good and the portions are HUGE! The Ranch dressing is great and it goes well with everything. -The pasta menu can be good. Some are really good (Louisiana chicken is my favorite).But the few other pasta dishes Ive tried  were  only decent.  -The sandwich menu is very questionable to me. I think Ive only ordered a sandy twice from there and after that I gave up. At the price, you would expect a restaurant to have the sandwich menu mastered with their own take and twists on basic sandies.  At the least they need to be stacking these sandwiches high with meat. They dont have that. The service is alright.The only complaints I have is that the waiters/waitresses need to relax and people time to decide with the menu they have and the p[rice we pay. I could go on but I think you should be getting the idea by now. Overall, its good but confusing to me. A place you must go and decide for yourself."
Cindy K.,"Valley Center, CA",0,7,,5.0,12/9/2015,Yummy! Love this place. The vanilla bean cheesecake is the best.
Ken D.,"Murrieta, CA",31,10,2,5.0,9/13/2014,"Food is always excellent , service was great, only issue was the silverware was dirty. Minor issue, no problems I will still go back. Cheesecake is out of this world!!!!"
Nicole P.,"Riverside, CA",3,51,10,4.0,4/30/2014,"I love the ambiance of Cheesecake Factory in and of itself, so I absolutely loved it! I think what made the experience worthwhile was our waitress, Kaya. My boyfriend and I were celebrating my birthday, and I really appreciated how personable she was. She was honest and showed she genuinely cared that EVERYONE she was taking care of had an impeccable dining experience. If you ever go, REQUEST HER!! She is absolutely amazing!!"
Tina K.,"San Diego, CA",5,31,1,2.0,2/12/2014,"Obviously good food, but the restaurant is SO tiny, long lines, LONG wait.. Not even worth the wait(2 hours) , they gave our table to someone else (party of 11) and took even LONGER to seat us. ( called us once and we had no service so they gave our table away within 5 minutes). Rude. Go to the one in fashion valley."
Christina C.,"Temecula, CA",2,12,14,1.0,9/6/2014,"Terrible first impressions ... From Hostesses who talk only to each other and avoid eye contact with the customers, a manager who could care less when you bring it to his attention & a FILTY TABLE.  Our lunch was good, as was our cheesecake... But I give that credit to the chain, not this individual ghetto run place.  The rudest was our hostess, Marleen.  Our server, Paige, was very sweet... But the manger who finally set us, after 10 full minutes being ignored at the podium (after being paged that our table was ready) set us at a filthy table.  The hostess proceeded to triple seat our server, so when we were ready to order she was too busy.  The person who brought our meal shoved a plate in front of my husband & my son & rushed away ignoring my request for a plate.  Our server later brought one.  In all, she did her best, but her support staff was worthless!  Cheesecake Factory should be embarrassed to share hydro name with this location!"
Sequoia F.,"Escondido, CA",0,48,21,5.0,8/11/2015,Came here after a horrible experience at a nearby restaurant and we got sat right away outside loved the outside seating. We got are drinks right away after ordering and we split a entree and it was the perfect amount of food for the both of us and it was delicious will deffienetly be coming back to this location service was awesome and not as long of a line as at the fashion valley location oh and love there bread!!!
Sophia G.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,3.0,11/24/2014,Finally opened by my house. So happy!!! Love this place and the food is amazing. My favorite is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and their Chicken Samosas are to die for. The only downside is their poor customer service.
Melissa L.,"Ramona, CA",30,35,6,5.0,2/25/2014,Get the steak Diane and the shrimp scamp. Amazing! Top it off with a slice of mango key lime cheese cake and perfection.  Every appetizer I have had here has been amazing as well.
Kristina L.,"Oceanside, CA",6,19,17,5.0,3/23/2014,This makes me sad seeing all the poor reviews. Every time I  have come here the food is amazing and nice people. Try the chicken piccata then post a review!
Faye S.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",59,185,4,1.0,2/9/2014,"Eh...I wanted to come here for my birthday today. .. so I called yesterday cuz they DON'T do reservations and asked about a party of 12 for 5pm on Sunday. The person on the phone told me if you come by before 5 on Sunday, you would be fine...  Yeah....no... I was there at  430 pm and they told me it was a 2 hour wait. Haha.... ridiculous.... Don't know why I bothered.  Went to a nearby chain which was awesome and fuss free. ...This place is definitely not the place for a big party."
Jake H.,"Poway, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Horrible service, was told I did not need to have a reservation over the phone. I came in and was told to wait 80 minutes. Absolutely horrible."
Mesean S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/8/2015,"We came in with a party of ten. Huge right? I was expected a pretty long wait but we were told we had to wait 2.5-3 hours! We kindly talked to the manager who was very helpful compared to the hostess, and the manager said it would be a 50 minute wait. We waited and at about an hour we saw a table that could suit 10. However, the hostess let a party who waited only 10 minutes into the spot. We confronted her and let her know that we are leaving to BJ's across the street. We were served in 10 minutes, and I'm only coming to BJ's rather than The Cheescake Factory from now on."
