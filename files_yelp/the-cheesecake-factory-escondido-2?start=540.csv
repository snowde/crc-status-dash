Travis P.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/12/2015,Have dined here multiple times and the food is always great and the cheesecake is the best. Good service and all around good experience.  Wait line can get long but well worth the wait.
Paul W.,"San Diego, CA",29,14,10,1.0,1/2/2014,"We are very disappointed in the service at the Escondido location. After waiting for over an hour to be seated, we only ordered ragu and lettuce wraps and after 45 min still had not got our order. Very frustrated and hungry. We finally told our server we needed to leave if it isn't ready. She came back 5 minutes later with a bill for our beverages. No manager came to see us. We eat at Cheesecake Factory in San Diego and always have a good experience, but this location being new is obviously not ready to be open to the public."
Jeannette N.,"Escondido, CA",0,11,1,5.0,11/5/2015,"We don't like a lot of ""chain"" restaurants. But the food is always good and it has such a great variety, it's a good place to go for groups. Portions are very ample and we often share a few different dishes. Problem is we are usually too full for cheesecake."
Evan Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/3/2015,"We have been there twice, both had great experiences. Food was nice, and the waiters and waitress were friendly and helpful. Love the cheese cakes!"
Jack D.,"Friendsville, TN",2,23,,5.0,11/27/2013,"People who show up on the very first day the place opens, and then complain because everything isn't freaking PERFECT, should go review restaurants in Haiti or something. Seriously. People are so freaking spoiled and entitled it's sickening. Give it a WEEK at least before you slam it. Geez. I was there, and had no problems. In fact, my server Bri was awesome. It's a great addition to North County. In fact, anyone who works at that mall should thank God since there's now a reason to go there."
Josh M.,"San Diego, CA",3,20,5,1.0,12/4/2013,"I have never even encountered a business in which I considered giving 1 star until now.  And let me say I love the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley.  This is a long review so the main idea is AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST AND HIT UP BJ'S NEXT DOOR! Better service, better food and NICER staff! This was the WORST service ever! CONS: HORRIBLE SERVICE, Long waits, SLOWEST service known to man (ISNT THERE A TIME FRAME IN WHICH TO PROVIDE WATER AT THE VERY LEAST!?), little knowledge of menu (where the f is the training? Who runs this circus?)  PROS: Food was good. They text you when your table is ready so you're free to walk the mall. And the guys and the front counter are nice (should this even be a pro?) The wait was 1 1/2 hrs to start but they take your number to text you when your table is ready so that A plus I suppose. It seems like they hired people that have ZERO experience for the grand opening. It literally took 20 min for us to even get water. FUCKING WATER!!!!! They told us our table was ready, started getting the menus ready but then they girls talked for 5 min while we were standing there waiting to follow them to our table. Once seated we began to ask for water before being rudely cut off and rudely being told ""I'll be right back"" (right back took at LEAST 10 minutes). She could have at least faked a cheesy smile, but no just a storm off(...b!tch) We had our orders ready by the time she came back.  We ordered appetizers,drinks, main dishes and waters.  13 min later our water comes! During this time I asked for waters and was told to please hold while she places our food orders. (Ok? No problem, I know you have to go to the mountains and gather fresh stream water or the alternative and perform a rain dance)I see her what seems to be being trained on HOW to use her computer (YAY!) WATER PLEASE WE'RE F'ing DYING! She brings waters finally but  instead of kids water she brings big mugs for a 5 and 2 year old( wouldnt common sense say Kids cups? ) I had to ask a server walking by to bring us cups since we were being ignored.  Then the waitress got our drink orders wrong. Then the straws we asked for never came. From the time we sat down to the time our food came was a little over 1 HOUR! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  She just SUCKED! DEAR GOD SHE SUCKED and I know shitty waiters! I will never come here again and I will warn all my friends that were excited for this place to steer clear!"
Alejandro P.,"Poway, CA",3,25,31,4.0,6/22/2014,"I personally love the Cheesecake Factory but the negative controversial side of the business is that whenever I call the place and ask for a reservation they never have any reservations available. In addition, it takes a very long time when it comes to waiting for the food and they should also get rid of the flys that annoy you when you are eating. Though there is friendly staff and very delicious meals with contemporary decor."
Felipe R.,"Vista, CA",14,62,2,3.0,7/7/2014,"The food is always pleasant but I strongly dislike the set up. If you don't get a booth it is very uncomfortable. The tables are set up in a row with parties right next to each other. You don't have to be eavesdropping to hear everyone else's conversations. I also wouldn't talk about anything private because there are a lot of people in your immediate proximity, or if you prefer the phrasing, ""Everyone is all up in your business."" The drinks were also made differently each time, even if you order the same drink. Drinks need more consistency."
Tiffany S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",72,2,,1.0,12/8/2013,"Called to make a reservation for 22 for a later date and was told no reservations were being made till after the 1st of the year. Booo on Cheesecake Factory! December is the month of parties, gatherings and celebrations. How is a restaurant that is known for large party accommodations, not accommodating! New location, old location... I don't care. We were told that the 22 people in the party could come down 3 hours before to wait in hopes to be accommodated. Yeah right! I wont give Cheesecake Factory a second thought ever again."
Kelly H.,"San Diego, CA",223,5,,5.0,4/24/2015,"We had dinner for my mom's birthday at the Cheesecake Factory tonight. It was great! Besides the food, the best part was our server. His name was David D, and he was on top of everything. He was very fun to be around and did and excellent job. I forgot to ask for broccoli, and it was too late when I remembered. He then brought out a whole side on the house. Once he found out it was my mom's birthday he had everyone sing. Thanks for making our dinner great!"
Sayaka B.,"Waynesville, MO",52,105,50,3.0,1/31/2014,"I stopped at this place to take out cheesecake. It was Sunday afternoon, quite busy...but it does not meant I had to be served and get my cheesecakes about 15mins. The girls working there was not happy obviously since they were busy but none of my business really. I don't deserve their bad attitude. Anyways I got toasted S'more and red velvet cheesecake. I recommend red velvet! It was so yummy!"
Christy L.,"Escondido, CA",51,9,1,1.0,10/11/2015,"After my friend took the time planning a dinner (for the past month) for her birthday, we were highly disappointed at our experience when we arrived at the Cheesecake Factory. We called ahead for two days, and even hours before we got there, giving them more than enough time to get ready for our party. When we got there (an hour before we told the rest of the party) we were told we had a 3-4 hour wait time. If we didn't live an hour away and had everyone traveling here already, we would have changed the location right then and there. But we waited for our party to get there hoping something would open up within the hour. In that hour we saw groups of 5-10 people being sat before us (after our party had already arrived). I took the liberty of speaking to the manager for my friend, because she was getting very upset. When I spoke with him, he was rude and spoke to me as if he was belittling me. Since we were waiting for well over an hour, you would think he would share a little concern seeing that we had pregnant women and children that we were entertaining. No compassion whatsoever. I told him that I found it ridiculous that they could sit groups that were only 5 people (including lap babies) less than us, who had come in an hour after us. With that he pretty much told me that was how the cookie crumbled. I informed my friend and our party, and we walked across the street to BJs who were more than happy to help us. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant and I will tell all of our friends and family about our experience. After being so excited to go, it left a bad taste in my mouth. If I could I wouldn't even rate this with a star."
Melissa M.,"Poway, CA",1,5,,3.0,1/5/2014,"Honestly ive never been so conflicted about writing a review for a restaurant.  And sitting here, I'm not even sure if this review is going to be positive or negative.  First, we walked in and we're told it would be a 20 minute wait. 40 minutes later I check back in and they tell me my name was never put in, even though I got a text from their computer confirming I was. So anyway we get seated, and our waiter was just the best. I never got his name, but let's just call him pony tail guy. Pony tail guy was wonderful and was always on top of our refills and always made sure we were alright. He was an absolutely fantastic waiter and I hope someone in management sees this and gives him the credit he deserves.  I ordered a margherita pizza which came out with no tomatoes. None, at all. It was just cheese bread with some basil. I was so embarrassed to send it back because I usually don't like to fuss about my food but I did. Pony tail guy was so nice about it and made sure I was taken care of.  The man who came out and apologized for the pizza being poorly made was also very nice and actually made me laugh about the whole thing. He was also surprised that there was no tomato on the pizza. Instead of it being remade, I just ordered a slice of cheesecake which was lovely, and I left feeling sad about the food and long wait but happy with the staff. Pony tail guy totally saved the day."
Laura C.,"San Diego, CA",5,12,,1.0,12/26/2013,"This has been the most horrible experience I have ever had at this restaurant, usually I love it. Great, fast, efficient service. Well not today. There were five of us(3 children) and it took over an hour to get our food even though we were one of the first to be seated. Then they forgot my salad and I had to wait another 15 minutes while everyone had their food. All we got was a half hearted apology and then they had the nerve to drop the check without taking off the salad as the manager said he would. Don't think I'll be going back to the Cheesecake Factory..."
Glynn M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/18/2013,My wife went to lunch ... had her bring me home a pizza. I chose the Hawaiian style. It was AWFUL!!!!! You could not taste the very small amount of pineapple or the ham over the heavy garlic salt. Like pouring garlic salt on your tongue! A very small pizza for $13 ... you would expect quality. The cook is a menace to society. I wouldn't recommend the pizza .. do not know about the rest. One star is too much for the pizza.
Angel M.,"Oceanside, CA",39,22,15,5.0,2/8/2014,"This is my first time eating at this cheesecake factory and I was definitely pleased with the service and food! =) I always love getting the chicken belagio! I also tried the nachos and the strawberry sangria, not to sweet and strong so it came out perfect! I would definitely recommend it! Service is good, waiters are very nice and attentive! I'm glad they opened one closer to where I live, I'm glad to say I'll be coming here again ;}"
Ian P.,"San Marcos, CA",38,39,,1.0,2/11/2014,For the record I also did call in the day before and was told if I was there by 5pm it would be all good. It's not like I just showed up and thought 16 people would be sat easily
Ali S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/2/2015,"Tonight we had the pleasure of having Brice as our server! He was wonderful! He was very aware of all of tables. We didn't have to ask for anything at all. He was also great about pre bussing the tables, which was nice because we had a tiny table. The food was delicious! Our steaks were very tender and juicy.. They were perfect! Even though they didn't have the cheesecake i wanted, the overall experience was great! Best service I've had at a cheesecake factory!"
Joel R.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",36,24,21,5.0,5/19/2014,"Love it, I always go to the bar, fry a beer and something to eat, service is great, good ambience and great prices...couldn't ask for more."
Megan D.,"Oceanside, CA",336,200,147,4.0,1/24/2014,"SO STOKED they opened this up closer to my house! We love going to the one in Fashion Valley too. We went shortly after they opened and ordered our usual favorites. My Chicken Bellagio was better than ever but my boyfriend had to send back his Hibachi steak. It was overcooked and the flavor was just off. He ordered the wasabi Ahi and loved it. The manager came over and said we were right about the Hibachi Steak because it was his favorite too, so hopefully it will be perfect the next time we go. The manager and server were great!"
