Ariel H.,"Vista, CA",143,2,2,2.0,9/17/2015,"Food and everything is great, only thing that I could not even begin to comprehend is that they don't take reservations. Came here for a birthday dinner for a friend and he had to show up an HOUR early and sit by himself to get them to make the space for 20 people. Why wouldn't you take reservations for bigger parties? They made us wait SO long that the party started showing up and we were all waiting together for more than half an hour before they seated us. So rude. I'll never come here with a big party."
Robyn M.,"El Cajon, CA",28,39,5,1.0,3/17/2015,"Terrible experience! We asked for patio seating; after 15 min wait in the bar area, they seated us inside and said they were sorry but if we really wanted patio seating, we would have to wait another 10- 15 minutes. ... this was a Tuesday night at 6:45 pm and there was plenty of open tables available in their patio section! We just took our seats and after  2 &1/2 hours of gnat infested dining we were finally out of that restaurant. I killed two gnats before our entrees were served. After one landed on my cheesecake,  we were done! I had to go to the hostess counter to locate our server to pay our bill. I am a long time and frequent customer of cheesecake factory but always the fashion valley location. The manager on site said he would let his general manager know about our experience and took my contact information in case she wanted to contact me.  This was my 2nd experience at the newest Escondido location and it will definitely be my last."
Jocelyn L.,"Renton, WA",0,8,,2.0,12/28/2013,"Our server was nice, but it did not seem like she was very familiar with the menu. I ordered a Cuban Sandwich (not a lot of places serve it so I thought it was awesome that they did) but it turned out they didn't have the ingredients to make it, I then decided to order a Kobe burger--medium rare, but it came out very well done, kind of charred. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni personal pizza and almost the whole surface was burnt. It's a shame because it's a new restaurant and I've only heard great things about the place. Don't think we will be stopping by again."
Jamie W.,"Escondido, CA",74,121,31,5.0,3/3/2014,The hubby and I stop in here from time to time the red velvet and coffee cheesecake are both amazing! So glad they build this restaurant right down from our house
Annette B.,"Vista, CA",0,6,1,2.0,6/9/2014,Really expensive. $119 for family of 4 (including TX + tip).  Husbands food was missing a major ingredient. Waitress didn't come back till he was almost finished. Manager offered discount.  When bill came they took $2 off.  His meal wasn't right. It wasn't enjoyed. Should have been free or 1/2 price.  What a joke.  We didn't ask for more or complain.  Just don't want to go back.  Not worth the money.
Pamela R.,"Oceanside, CA",26,76,22,4.0,3/22/2014,"Yesterday was my first visit...I've been to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, but wanted to wait a few months before visiting a new one.   I was skeptical because of some of the reviews...but, I'm happy to report, we didn't experience any of the issues others had.   My son and I arrived around 12:45pm, it took a few minutes to find a place to park and about 5 minutes to be seated.  The tables were not close together (one of my biggest pet peeves in a restaurant), we had plenty of room between ours and our neighbors...don't you hate it when they are close and you get someone's butt brushing up against your table...ew!  Our server, Alexander E., was awesome...all around good service...and he was cute! :) The food was...nothing special, just typical chain restaurant food.  The side salads, I do NOT recommend, a mix of greens that were bitter with one thin wedge of tomato.  We also ordered the S'mores cheesecake...it was good.   I didn't give 5 stars because the prices are ridiculous...$10.50 for a small sliced turkey sandwich with a bit of bacon and avocado on a bun...come on people! I won't be rushing back but, I do wish more of the servers I encounter are like Alexander E....and not just because he's cute."
Sam L.,"Oceanside, CA",10,30,,3.0,4/18/2014,"I honestly love the cheese cake factory but this location has very very terrible service there was only one person who truly acted like he cared, I don't remember his name but he was a host and his shoes were almost falling apart but I really appreciated him and how nice he was to my cousin and I, as far as the waitress went I don't know if she could've taken any longer or forgot anymore the only thing she was fast on was giving me the check quickly but other than that she was ehh, but to whomever that host was I thank you, I really hope you do invest in some shoes that aren't falling apart though but other than that keep up the good work"
Samin V.,"San Marcos, CA",1,42,1,1.0,6/29/2015,"Having only been to the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley and in Vegas,  I was expecting typical Cheesecake factory food and service, which had always been good based on my past experiences. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  We decided to stop in last week on a Friday for lunch while we were running errands at the mall. It was pretty dead inside, so we figured we could get in and out pretty quick. We were seated immediately. Our server (don't remember her name, but a younger blond girl with tattoo sleeves) took our drink order and food order. She was less than enthusiastic, but that was no big deal. We got our drinks and while we were waiting on our food, several other people were seated. Their food came and went, but no sign of ours. Our server finally checked in on us and let us know that the food was taking longer than expected. She offered us a cup of chowder, which was nice, but mind you this was about 30 minutes after we had placed our order. I asked if the salad that came out with my pizza could be brought out sooner. She said yes (ideally, they would have done this anyway, right?) and she brought my husband a cup of chowder. A little while after that, our food finally came out. My husband had ordered a chopped salad and I had ordered a pizza. Not sure why either of those things would take so long, considering that everyone else who was seated after us had pretty much received their food. The server (a different one) then proceeded to put our orders in front of the people at the table next to us. The girl next to us all but stuck her fork in my husband's salad before we realized those were our meals and corrected the server. The server picked the salad up from the other table and basically just plopped it in front of us.  We at our meals (again, without being checked on. We had to flag our server down for drink refills) and asked for the check. When the check came, I noticed that I had been charged extra for the wrong kind of salad. I pointed this out to our server when she came back. She told me that we had been charged correctly, and I again had to tell her it was incorrect and told her the correct menu price of my order vs. what she had charged me for. At that point, she figured out she was wrong and took the check back and had it corrected.  The food was fine, but I won't be going back because of the poor service. There are plenty of other options in the mall and around the mall with better service."
Quyen S.,"San Diego, CA",39,19,8,4.0,2/8/2014,Their food always tastes great but it just opened so things were rather busy. My daughter's food came out later and the manager came out and personally apologized himself. It made her feel special and not forgotten. It's a little loud in there but it made it the perfect atmosphere to bring children to.
Michael S.,"Concord, CA",211,59,23,1.0,3/8/2014,"Don't believe the hype this place sucks. I don't know why this place is so popular but I have been here multiple times and each time i have had a bad experience.  The first time I came it was my friends birthday and before we could be seated we had to wait an hour and walk around the mall just to be seated outside in the cold winter night. When the waitress came with our food she spilled some fries on my wife and ruined her dress, the manager was quick about coming over to apologize and he seemed sincere. They brought over some more fries of course but i really didnt think that it was enough considering the fact that my wifes dress was ruined to the point she had to replace it. The burger I had was nothing special and really not worth 18 dollars, for four people the bill came out to 80$ and when I asked the waitress for a birthday song for my friend I really thought they were gonna bring at at least the birthday girl a slice of cake, but no they did not, after about 20 minutes of stalling they finally came and started singing but all they brought was some whip cream on a plate, considering our bill was 80$ and the fact that they had spilled fries on one of their guest you would think they could at the very least give the birthday girl a slice of cake.  Of course I understand that they are a business but even our local Denny's will give someone some came on their birthday, I was a little offended by the whip cream, if I knew they were gonna be stingy on the cake I would have been OK paying but they didn't even ask, and its not like we had already said no to desert, they just honestly didn't care about us. My second visit was with just my wife and we went in hopes that the place would redeem itself and live up to its popularity. It did not. It was crowded as usual and again we waited around an hour to be seated and again we were seated outside, luckily it was lunch time so it wasn't too cold. they were slow with everything and our waiter spent too much time handling a certain table with girls his age, I did not leave a tip. Again the food was mediocre and yet still we paid around 40$, I really don't mind the prices its just if I'm going to pay twice as much what I would at Dennys then I want at least twice the quality service and food. On this occasion I would take a Denny's cheeseburger over theirs any day. Our third trip was just as mediocre, although not a horrible experience we still had to wait the usual hour just to be seated outside for the third time. We both tried something different and were both unimpressed. Although our waitress actually paid attention to us this time the quality of the food just isn't worth the price, I really really don't understand what it is people love about this place. Yes I did try the cheesecake and yes it was good but not 7 dollars a slice good. I will not be going back to the cheescake factory for a very long time if at all."
Lanya G.,"San Diego, CA",121,129,1414,4.0,1/28/2014,"Choices, choices, choices! So hard to pick 1 item from this extensive menu.  I came here for lunch and had no trouble or wait being seated right away. We even asked for outside seating too. I didn't notice this particular location being a smaller venue compared to the mission valley location, but maybe it is? Either way I felt it had enough space. I'm quite happy they put this restaurant at the North County mall. I like the Cheesecake Factory. This is one chain restaurant that I really enjoy. I ordered from the lunch menu, which is served till 5 and the portions are still huge! I ordered the bbq ranch grilled chicken salad. Comes with corn, black beans, tomato, avocado, cucumber, romaine leaves, lots of chicken and fried onion rings on top. When my waitress brought out my salad, I thought she made a mistake and brought me the dinner portion but nope, it was the lunch size. Needless to say I definitely needed a to go box. I don't know what there isn't to like about this place, its great, and they even have gluten free cheesecake options if you aren't too full after your meal. I will be frequenting this restaurant."
Andrea R.,"Poway, CA",3,7,1,5.0,5/7/2014,I absolutely love the cheesecake Factory. I always get amazing customer service! When I was I was there last I ordered the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo plate. The food was cooked to perfection. For desert I ordered the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go because I was too full from dinner. When our waitress was packing up out cheesecake and leftovers she gave us a box FULL of the delicious bread you get before dinner. She also brought my boyfriend and I our drinks to-go before we left. Over all it was a great dinning experience!!
Laura W.,"Poway, CA",0,18,,2.0,7/28/2014,Second time to this location.  Food and service equally disappointing; inexperienced servers. There are far better dining choices in north county.
Jordan Z.,"San Diego, CA",13,54,14,3.0,2/24/2014,"I really want to love this place, because I heard so my hype about it, I love cheesecake, and had wanted to come here for such a long time, and finally just went here for the first time in December, and then again last night, but found myself disappointed for different reasons both times.   I understand because it just opened a few months ago that it is very popular and busy, and that the servers are still learning.  However, with that said.... My first time there we experienced great service.  Our server was friendly and sweet (wish I could remember her name, but we sat in her section near the bathrooms).  I ordered the sun-dried tomato alfredo pasta and was extremely disappointed with how absolutely bland in flavor it was.  I seriously have never had such terrible pasta.  I can make WAY better pasta at home.  Luckily, their cheesecake makes up for it, but I expected far better flavor for the price. My second experience was at the self-seating bar area (not the bar itself, but the tall, circular tables next to the bar) and I believe our server was named Krystal.  We ordered waters (which our server was probably initially irritated about because she wanted to make money off of expensive bar drinks, but we were just not in the mood for alcohol this time).  She brought us the waters and bread, but we still had no menus and no silverware.  We ask her for menus and had all of about a minute or so to look over them before she returns she asks us what we want to eat.  The menu is HUGE, what makes you think we are ready to order?  We asked her to bring us silverware, so we can actually spread butter on the bread she brought us, which takes all of about a minute or two, and when she returns with the silverware, she asks us again if we are ready.  The entire experience from that point on just felt rushed and stressful.  It seemed like our server wanted to get us in and out so she could get more customers in and make more money.  After ordering and getting our food, our hummus and pita bread was delicious, but our mozzarella triangles and spinach and artichoke dip came out luke-warm.  We were so intimidated by our server that we felt uncomfortable asking her to re-heat the food, but we mustered up the confidence to do so anyways.  As a server, you shouldn't be so aggressive that you scare your customers out of what they want.  Later on in the evening, as we are finishing up our meals, she complains to us about other customers she dealt with that night which came off as very unprofessional.  We came here for an enjoyable experience, not to listen to our server complain about her job and her four tables.  I've worked in the service industry before for many years, so I have empathy for servers when they get busy, but four tables is not that many.  Clearly, we weren't the only people dissatisfied with our server that night, because the other customers left her a note basically telling her the service sucked.  The entire evening was just awkward and unpleasant, and my boyfriend and I felt relieved to get out of there.  I'm not saying that our server should necessarily be fired, but she needs some serious training in work ethic and customer service.  A change in attitude can make all the difference, and trust me, she needs some help.  Will request my friend and old co-worker David as our server next time.  She could definitely learn a thing or two about service from him."
Rob M.,"San Diego, CA",1,103,,3.0,4/16/2014,"Pretty good food and a nice atmosphere. It's nice to be able to eat outside. However, there is nothing really here to separate it from other similar restaurants. I can't comment on the cheesecake, but it's a fun place once in a while"
Kyle H.,"Ridgecrest, CA",11,10,1,5.0,7/4/2014,"Great for lunch or dinner. You get a lot for what you pay for and it all tastes awesome! The cheesecake is the real highlight of course, Godiva is the best!"
Debbie H.,"San Diego, CA",51,46,9,5.0,2/13/2014,"Everybody has been to the Cheesecake Factory, it's a chain, etc., etc. This one is different though. It's brand spanking new and the outdoor seating furniture is way more comfy than the outdoor furniture at mission viejo or fashion valley! We brought our dog with us so we sat outside and they were so nice to her! They brought her a bowl of water and they all commented on how cute she is. The food was good and the service was excellent! We will be back!!"
Iamsuper J.,"Escondido, CA",69,5,,4.0,6/29/2014,Cheesecake Factory is my place to go carb up to. I always get the carbonara with a side of chicken or fettuccine Alfredo with chicken also. They are delicious! The serving is pretty big so I always bring my left over at home and my meal for couple of days. The server are very attentive and focus all the time.
Jessica F.,"Escondido, CA",61,23,22,4.0,2/24/2014,The staff was friendly and there was no wait time during my visit. I can appreciate the extensive menu and outside seating. Who doesn't like options?
Benjamin K.,"San Marcos, CA",0,35,1,3.0,6/8/2015,Went here for their Sun brunch.... Rob was an amazing waiter and super courteous however the place was so busy it took awhile just to get water. Had to ask for bread bc our apps took so long to be served and we were starving! Entrees came out looking amazing except for my salad that was missing the toppings and dressing! Too many tables to handle for 1 person so forget a refill just chew the ice if you are thirsty! I think we heard more apologies about a slow kitchen in a time frame of 90 min which actually became funny. We also sat outside which was was great but looking at a row of dirty tables across from you and a line out the door tells ya something... Not enough staff!! Don't come here on a Sunday if you are in a time crunch!
