Laura K.,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",472,148,38,3.0,12/9/2013,"I have to say that I was very excited when they began building a Cheesecake Factory in North County. I'd also like to say that the reason my review is 3 stars is the wait. I was so excited to get to try this new location for my mother-in-law's birthday. We went here on a Thursday night so it shouldn't have been too crazy although they just opened recently and most everyone that I know in North County is more than happy that they're open. The waitress that we had was incredibly nice and professional with her service. However, every step of the process took 20 minutes or more. We waited to get in for more than 20 minutes which is expected for Cheesecake Factory and just something that you should accept if you're going to go here. However, from the time we were seated to the end process took 2 hours and 10 minutes. I'm going to attribute this to the fact that the restaurant just opened and I plan on going back in the future to give it another try.  The food was good as always. I got the chicken and biscuits. The manager came over and kindly expressed that they were out of the gravy and were willing to make a different type of gravy for it. I was okay with that and the substitute gravy was delicious. The only thing that I would change is that I wished there was more gravy and I'm not one of those smother it w/ gravy kind of girls. My mother in law got the crispy chicken costoletta which was awesome! I plan on getting it next time I go. My husband got the cajun chicken littles which he loves and orders practically every time that we go here. My father-in-law got a chicken Caesar salad which he appeared to enjoy. 3 of us had cheesecake (2 had the peppermint one and I had the tiramisu cheesecake). My father-in-law had carrot cake which he loved.  I wish that I could give this location a better review because their staff were professional and their food was good. However, with the time at the table I just couldn't give them 4 stars. I am hoping in the future that they're able to find their timing as the staff get used to working with each other."
The 1.,"Claremont, CA",78,414,268,1.0,10/25/2014,"By far the worst location EVER! My sis and i are from out of town and decided to eat here because I mean who doesn't love the cheesecake factory?! We frequent the rancho cucamonga and Anaheim locations so we are very familiar with the food. 1) service is very bad. We had a great waitress to end our meal but the first one wasn't very attentive.  We were happy when she came back after a million hours and told us she was leaving. 2) the food wasn't what we were used to. I ordered the breaded chicken dish with mashed potatoes (which had a grayish looking color and we're COLD), and asparagus (that were soooooooooooo limp and cold). The sauce was non existent and sucked up by the not so great chicken. We also ordered the Buffalo blasts that are normally a little more cheesy and not so runny with sauce. Bit into one and it burned the crap out of my mouth and hand and lacked the flavor we are both used to. Her and I both shared each others food and this is the only place we had food at the entire day. We both end up sick. I call to complain, not even demanding anything and he tells me since I was the only complaint he can't really do much and corporate would get back to me. 1) I've worked in the restaurant business for almost 10 years. 2)Being that I'm a customer I should be RIGHT and my coming back should mean something.  Obviously it didn't. I'm very happy I don't live in this area because I def wouldn't be frequenting this location. Thanks for the stomach pains Cheesecake Factory. Or should I just say diacake factory? Peace out!"
eric h.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,70,15,4.0,4/4/2015,Has the Chinese chicken salad... It was huge and very good. Seems to be getting harder to find this dish at many restaurants. Hope they keep it on the menu.
Ket I.,"San Diego, CA",43,10,,2.0,11/24/2014,Celebrating my sisters 29th birthday! Everyone showed up at 6pm with anticipations of being seated by 7pm but the case was we weren't seated until 8:05pm! Ok nothing said we understand of the business. So after hanging out at the bar for 2 hours and because we were a tad bit loud and easily relaxed yet super friendly we were cut off by 10:00pm! This is extremely offensive! Not that we already felt they say every single party of 2/3's after us when they could have sat them at a bigger booth but seriously how understanding and accommodating as we were without being upset of being seated 2 hours after the fact and how disorganized of our orders that my food came out extremely wrong yet after along a comment they didn't feel the need to put our minds at ease and how unfriendly our servers were because of how bias they might feel towards us we still tried to make the most of our experience! Bartenders were extremely friendly and accommodating as possible knowing that we have been waiting for that long of a time frame! I don't know you tell me how singled out and prejudice we felt just being in the atmosphere and how attentive they were to other races! My party alone spent well more than enough amount of money with minimal 20% tips per every tab and bill! I just can't believe this still occurs and at a well known franchise like CheeseCake Factory! So tell me how drunk do you really think I am for writing this review after you presumed that I was intoxicated...! How dissatisfying and a slap in the face!
Sue H.,"San Diego, CA",40,10,,1.0,5/21/2014,Just left from eating here and my husband and I spent out whole meal swatting two different sized gnat type of bugs. We got totally grossed out having to constantly shue them off our good or us. We told our waitress who got the manager Rebecca. She didn't seem surprised and cared even less. Her explanation that it was probably bugs from the patio didn't fly. We were not by patio or front doors and other tables didn't seem to have the infestation we did. We stood outside talking for a few minutes before we left and never had a bug. The staff had no skill set to make us want to return again.  We will never eat here again.
Mindy O.,"Escondido, CA",0,32,2,4.0,2/23/2014,Great food and desserts. The servers we had have been friendly and professional. It's just the LONG WAIT is negative. We went there right after 9:00 at Saturday night and still waited for 20 min. They have limited booth seating and reserve them for large parties. The rest of the tables seem very close to each other.
Celine N.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/27/2014,The worst wait ever. The hostess told my family that it was a 20 min wait. When it was pass 20 mins the hostess said we were up next to be seated. It was soon over an hour. Never did she tell us that the wait was going to be over 20 mins or give us a choice to leave. The manager threw in two appetizers to make up for it but still...really bad costumer service when it came to hosting. Hopefully the actual server does well
Russell H.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,,4.0,5/16/2014,"First, let me say that I am an unabashed fan of this company and have eaten at its restaurants all over the place. I have eaten widely from the menu and constantly enjoy high quality offerings.  But I have discovered a current favorite dish: Spicy Cashew Chicken. Fantastic. It is a little on the sweet side but if you like that . . . this is for you. It is a spicy, Mandarin-Style dish with green onions and roasted cashews, served over rice. It is the kind of dish you can begin to crave. As always with the Cheesecake Factory, the serving size is huge. I am a very healthy eater and cannot finish it. Also, I am not a drinker but because my business associate and lunch companion was raving about the Pina Colada, I took a taste. Wow. Perfectly icy, frothy and delicious. My companion, who is a drinker, says it is about as good as he has ever tasted. I forget what he had -- I think it was the Chicken Enchiladas -- but we both agreed it was just fantastic fare.  This company continues to impress."
Chris K.,"Mesa, AZ",4,7,,3.0,3/26/2014,Food was great as usual. The waitress was overwhelmed and took entirely too much time to get our dessert. It was my daughter's 6th birthday and they didn't even give her the ice cream Sunday for free on a $120 bill. Disappointed with the service.
Ryan P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,6,17,1.0,3/21/2015,"People aren't kidding, this place is very crowded. They are obviously understaffed. We waited for 45 minutes for a group of 4 to be sat on a Saturday at 3 pm. While we were waiting the host stand was crowded with people and barely any hosts. Sometimes the host stand was left completely empty and people were clueless on how to check in. When we went to get sat, someone stole our table so then they made us wait for 15 minutes to get sat again somewhere new. We finally got sat, and our server was no where to be found so we had to stop someone else to go and get our server so we could at least get waters. By the time she came over, we were ready to order everything because we wanted to get our food and get out of the restaurant. Throughout our time she constantly forgot to bring drinks, butter, lemon, bread and we had to remind her. This restaurant needs to be more staffed. The fact that this is such a well known restaurant that has so many locations, they should know how to staff for a busy location. I would totally avoid this location and I will never be back again."
Amy M.,"San Diego, CA",10,75,25,4.0,12/30/2013,This place is super busy! Fortunately it is in the mall and you can go shopping while you wait. The food selection and serving size is overwhelmingly large... but the cheesecake is obviously why most people come.
Maria A.,"Vista, CA",12,9,,3.0,3/19/2014,"I love cheesecake Factory! I have loved it for many years, and I'm used to their great service. We were quoted an hour when we went to this new location at 1:30 in the afternoon, and we werent seeted until 3, didn't get our food for another 30 minutes, and the server was slow to fill our drinks. Not our best trip, but the food tasted good."
Bryan G.,"San Diego, CA",31,5,,5.0,5/3/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory, there so many diverse menu options to choose from. Provided great service as always from Richard, who always keeps us satisfied and coming back for more. Food always comes out top notch and delicious."
Stephanie M.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",28,12,4,1.0,9/24/2014,"Don't waste your time here. A complete waste of time and money.  I won't ever be returning. After a long wait for a table we were sat and didn't see a server for 20mins. At that point she was very attentive and took our order quickly. Then we waited some more. Over an hour more. At which point the manger approached us and said they had mistakenly delivered my husbands meal to another table. We were then informed it would take another 20 mins to prepare a new meal and then they immediately delivered mine...which was cold. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which I was warned was spicy. It was not spicy. It was completely tasteless. So much so that I didn't even eat it. In the meantime the manger has offered to bring my husband more bread and he sat and ate bread while I picked at my tasteless pasta. My husbands Chicken and Biscuits finally arrived at the point he had devoured obnoxious amounts of bread and I was done picking at my tasteless pasta.  We were ready to leave but my husband was looking forward to his dish so he dug in. It was total crap. Again completely tasteless. We had been in the restaurant now for over 2 hours and completely disgusted with our experience. Our server never did return until showing up with our bill. They didn't even bother to comp any portion of the meal and so we paid and left. Plates full, wallets empty and very sure we will never visit this establishment again."
Colleen H.,"San Diego, CA",2,24,37,4.0,1/2/2015,"Although it took a while for our food, the chicken katsu was amazing! So tender! I asked for the miso glaze on the side and it complemented it perfectly! (Its the glaze that is usually served with their miso salmon)"
Robert W.,"Poway, CA",0,13,,3.0,1/25/2014,"Good food, nice environment.   The wait for seating, food and then the check is terrible.  1.5 hrs to get in.  1.5 hrs to get out.   The illusion for them is since people are waiting in line to get inside why make improvements?   But in reality, they'd do better business if they cycled people through quicker.   It's new.  Hopefully they improve."
Parmy C.,"Escondido, CA",15,42,5,5.0,12/8/2013,"Went in with the family at 4:20 to request a table for five. We were told it would take 1 1/2-2 hrs & they would send us a text when our table was ready. We shopped around the mall and our table was ready right at the 2 hr mark which we were prepared for so we didn't mind.  We started with ahi tartare and fried calamari. Both dishes were DELICIOUS! The ahi was more fresh than ahi we've had in Maui & the calamari was crispy on the outside but juicy and tender on the inside and came with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce which were both great. For dinner, my husband had the southern fried catfish, I had the cajun jambalaya pasta with shrimp and my teenage daughter had the four cheese pasta. My two younger daughters ordered pasta from the kids menu and the portions were quite large for kids portions. My dish was good but I will most likely order a different dish next time, as it was a little bland for my taste. The fried catfish was delicious, moist and came with mashed potatoes, green beans and corn. My daughter said her pasta was good but I did not try it. We were all stuffed so we ordered cheesecake to go. We had the smores cheesecake, strawberry, red velvet and vanilla which were all ok in my opinion. Our server, Michael, and the rest of the staff were very attentive. Drinks were refilled promptly, the food came out in a timely manner and empty dishes were promptly taken away. We will definitely be returning!"
Natalya S.,"Carlsbad, CA",11,3,,4.0,12/24/2013,This was the third time I have visited the Cheesecake Factory at North County. The first two times the service was not very good understandably because the place is brand new. This time we sat in the bar area and Ryan waited on us. He was very friendly and attentive. He even went out of his way to get us the cheesecake we ordered for Christmas so that we didn't have to wait in line. I was very pleased with his service.
Hatch D.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",2,11,3,4.0,1/26/2014,Great place to stop in and fix your sweet tooth with some cheesecake. It's a nice add to  the Mall.
Rob H.,"Murrieta, CA",1,13,4,5.0,3/11/2014,The food was all perfectly cooked. The items all came out quickly. The waitress was extremely friendly. The host and waitress were very helpful with accommodating our one year old as far as seating and finding and area out of the way from the majority of customers. We sat outside. I assumed the tables am chairs would e dusty or weathered. This was not the case. Everything was well cleaned and maintained. The heaters were well placed and kept a all toasty. The only downside to the outdoor seating was that the sum was setting directly in our faces. This is not the fair of the restaurant. It was just irritating and there was no relief other than holding menus in front to block the sun. I would record inside seating to avoid this issue. We were all to full to even make it to their famous desserts.
