Tom H.,"Escondido, CA",0,3,1,1.0,11/6/2017,"I come here often but never on Monday,  The service just was not there and I mean not there at all. We were at the bar tables and sat there for about 15 min. Before the bartender helped us. She was grate but she not working the tables she had the bar. We got the manager and told him the problem, he said there was a shift change. Now we were there for some time and if we were helped they would tell us of the shift change, but no help so no info. Just don't go on Mondays."
Cat C.,"San Marcos, CA",1,9,31,5.0,8/8/2017,The original cheesecake for $7.49 a slice is pretty good. It has 700 calories in case you cared. Typical Cheesecake Factory as expected. Food quality is pretty darn good as well. Come to treat yourself.
Daphne L.,"San Diego, CA",1382,1153,1103,4.0,10/19/2016,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory with your typical decor and typical menu and typical (great) service! You really can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory because there is something for everyone and if there isn't, then they will be able to make it for you or find a version of their current selection and try to make it for you! I love TCF and the yummy cheesecakes they have! It is pricey for dinner but I love coming for lunch because it is affordable! I highly recommend this location because you can go shopping before or after your meal."
Robin L.,"San Diego, CA",10,8,,1.0,12/22/2017,"I don't understand why this place is so busy. The service is bad and the food is overpriced. This week I was happy that it was only a 10 minute wait for a table but it took over an hour to place our order. I ordered the coconut lime chicken. It was too spicy for me. The service was bad, the place is noisy and too expensive."
shawn f.,"Vista, CA",0,85,,2.0,10/15/2017,Another large cooperate franchise. This place is noisy!! So don't expect a nice quiet dinner. Food is good for a franchise. PUT THE PRICES OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKS ON THE MENU!!!!!!!   Quit insulting our intelligence by hiding prices!
Tall M.,"Hayward, CA",1,19,16,5.0,10/14/2017,Great food and great customer service best cheesecake factory experience yet wish i lived in southern California jeremy best server
Blake C.,"San Marcos, CA",8,20,21,1.0,10/7/2017,I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory but spending the day at the hospital and vomiting all day will change that. I just felt a need to write this review so that management can make food safety a priority so nobody else has to go through what I am going through. Inflamed intestines and stomach pain so bad I was given morpheme. Not cool at all.
Junior R.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/5/2017,"The food here is bomb! I love the cheesecake availability. :) I came here with my bestfriend and she absolutely enjoyed it also, i'll dine in more often, but if i'm really in a hurry, take out it is."
Nikunj B.,"San Diego, CA",7,33,,2.0,9/13/2017,Overall a mediocre experience. Ordered a Cajun Pasta . Pasta was decent overall but coupled with not so friendly service made the experience worse. The wine glass in which I was served was dirty and I had to wait for 20 mins before the waiter stopped after passing my table like 4 times walking so fast as if the busiest person in the world.
Kar L.,"McKinney, TX",24,7,3,2.0,10/24/2017,Food is great (usually) but service/kitchen is constantly behind. Waited over thirty minutes for an appetizer. Probably the last time we eat here for a while. :-(
SoCalRestaurantCritic ..,"Murrieta, CA",369,106,17,2.0,5/15/2017,"We came in about 1pm, were seated right away and then the wait began, we seemed to have waited after being sat, 10min or longer, the place wasn't busy at all. Are server came by and asking for a drink order, we ordered a  draft beer and a VERY EXPENSIVE, $12 sangria! Wow!  She came back later with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order, we said yes, had a few question, had to asked her what her name was, no introduction was given, at the beginning, her name was MJ.  We ordered the Orange Chicken and the Crispy Pineapple Chicken. An expediter brought our food quickly after ordering, props to the Kitchen, food was hot, crispy, and tasty, just like we ordered! We needed some Soy Sauce and Sriracha Chili, we were halfway into our meal, when MJ finely came by and asked how things were, (mind you not busy at all) we requested condiments and a few minutes later they arrived.  MJ seemed to struggling, a young man filled our water glass, yet another server took our check and payment, and quickly returned for signature. Never to see our server again!  The store was nice and clean people doing the seating were very friendly and accommodating! Our overall experience was good perhaps the server could use a little more training or help.  Until next time!  SCRC  Chef Ron"
Matt S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,25,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Food is what you expect.  Average. This review is about the staff.  At the front desk we checked in and said we would take first available seat.  After 20 mi it's or so we were taken to our seat. It was 83 and very very sunny. We were put outside, at a table with no umbrella. The black metal could almost burn your skin it was so hot.  We asked for an umbrella but they had too few and were unable to find one.  We asked to be reseated.   Then the fun began.   They took us back inside and made us wait in line again.  The nasty little blonde woman at the desk smirked and said, we tried to seat you Once, so now  you get to wait again.  When the first face you are greeted by at any establishment is so disrespectful, miserable, and ugly from the inside out, it's a turn off. Im sure there are plenty of establishments around without awful people like her.  Go elsewhere."
Katie S.,"San Diego, CA",46,359,148,5.0,5/19/2017,"They have excellent service here! Every time I've come in, we've had a great waiter the hostess usually leaves something to be desired, but they aren't horrible and interaction with them is limited. Where this place really excels is their waitstaff. They are all so friendly and polite. Adam was our waiter most recently and he was great. He was fast and thorough. He checked on us frequently, but wasn't overbearing. The food is always great at the Cheesecake Factory, so there are never any complaints there!"
Anne H.,"Grover Beach, CA",86,2,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Absolutely disgusting! We waited as a party of four for 45 minutes and had to go inside twice to remind the hostess we even existed.  Once we were finally seated, there wasn't even a fourth seat at our table, which our server immediately began frantically mumbling about ""It was the other guys fault for not bringing a chair, it's not my fault, it's his fault. Not my fault, it's his fault..."" While we sat in uncomfortable silence. Needless to say, very unsettling. The napkins were thrown in messy piles underneath our menus and our silverware was set straight onto the surface of the table! There was even gigantic chunks of foodstuff on one of the sets of silverware!  If I could give zero stars, I would. It was hectic with a large party trying to pay their bill at 7:30pm on a Sunday night, and I get its crazy, but not getting seated until after 8 is unacceptable when there are several other tables already cleaned and set up. However, as a cook, I can comfortably say there are some serious staffing and floor management issues. I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, and I can confidently say I will not again."
Judith N.,"Escondido, CA",1,75,85,2.0,4/16/2017,"We went out for Anniversary Dinner with some family.  Restaurant is noisy which makes it difficult to carry on a conversation.   It was dark and difficult to read menu. There is a very large menu.   Unfortunately my husband and I didn't make the wrong choices...food was not terrible, but not good.  If I go out to eat, I want tasty food. Didn't like..returned our meals.  They didn't charge us for our food.   Wait staff was pleasant, service was not good.....busy evening...maybe she had too many tables. Would not recommend."
Jessica N.,"Escondido, CA",366,151,1130,4.0,3/23/2016,"Surprising to me I like the food here way more than I enjoy the cheesecake! This place always has a huge wait and since it is normally just the 2 of us, we can normally sit in the bar area fairly quickly which is nice. We normally split one meal and 1 small plate (appetizer) and it's more than enough food for both of us. Pricing is decently reasonable, and the wait staff is always super friendly. Also if there is a wait at least you can walk around the mall for a bit while you do so!"
Alicia L.,"San Diego, CA",101,48,,2.0,9/25/2017,"Ordered 2 salads to go. Aside from no one at the counter so it took 10 min to order, get home and one salad is missing 2 key ingredients, the other's lettuce is brown. Reached out to customer service, 8 days later still no acknowledgement. Sub par food, sub par corporate handling of complaints. Will update if I ever hear back, but spending $30 for brown lettuce and some carrots seems a bit ridiculous."
Olya K.,"San Diego, CA",6,44,10,1.0,9/24/2017,This place gave us upset stomachs. We always go here for cheesecake and occasionally go for food but again cause we would get a cheesecake to go at the end. We went there yesterday because we had a gift card and both ordered pasta dishes. Mine was the shrimp and sausage pasta and pasta came out aldente. His was chicken and garlic farfale and all it was is bunch of bow tie pasta in a heavy cream sauce and they threw some tasteless chicken and frozen peas. Terrible. We were just sitting there and talking about how we can even make better food than this. Who is your chef Cheesecake Factory???  Took sooooo long to get a single cheesecake to go at the register by display that it was enough time to get upset about everything here. They were obviously out of pumpkin that is their seasonal and is advertised on their menu. I'll be honest I don't even like these overpriced cheesecakes because all it is is bunch of sugar and bunch of unhealthy stuff in it but my bf likes it so we do get them. Oh well no more dinners here. I'll also try to find a better place for cheesecake so we don't come near this place again.
Sandra P.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,,4.0,12/11/2017,"Always great food, except last night. Three of us went to dinner to celebrate two birthdays. Two of the party ordered the Steak Diane as they were craving a good steak. What they got no one could possibly call it a steak. It was so thin in places it looked like a piece of leather covered in fresh ground black peppercorns. I mean completely covered. And there really wasn't any sauce. It looked awful and tasted awful. If you want a thick juicy steak, I wouldn't order the Steak Diane."
Angela M.,"Fallbrook, CA",32,12,,4.0,9/29/2017,"If you like German Chocolate Cake and cheesecake you love Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake, my favorite for sure!  I found the Cobb and other salads fine and service good."
