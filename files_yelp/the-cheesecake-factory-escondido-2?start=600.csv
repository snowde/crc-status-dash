Joseph R.,"Rockwall, TX",2,27,,4.0,12/9/2013,"Very long wait, but that was to be expected, it's a huge mall and it is the holidays. Cheese Cake Factory is always awesome and now that I have one right down the street from my house I will be gaining a few pounds. LOL!!!"
Debbie R.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/11/2014,"When we arrived at 4:30 p.m. They said we could sit inside for a wait of 10 minutes or we could be immediately seated outside. It was warm so I chose inside. 15 minutes later I checked in with the hostess who looked at her computer screen and then turned around and talked to three other staff members and then told me that they were just waiting for a table to open up, they had issued many checks and they were waiting for the payments to be processed. 15 minutes later now it's 30 minutes since I arrived I go back to the hostess desk and the same thing happens. The hostess looks at the computer screen turns around to chat about my situation with 3 other staff members and comes back and tells me that they have to wait for a two seat table to open up and that I am the only one not seated.  DurIng this 30 minutes I saw approximately 20 parties be seated at tables. The message was regardless of when you come in we are not sitting 2 people at a four topper. I was very upset because I really enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  I walked back to the hostess table after a 35 minute wait and told him I could not wait any longer and left. This is no way to take care of your customers. I know Sunday is a busy time but after seeing 20 parties seated before me when they came in after me is just so insulting.  I think the staff and management needs to be trained better in how to treat people in customer service. I am very disappointed.  When I walked out of the restaurant I saw no less than 4 empty tables inside and  5 empty tables out on the patio but none of them were for 2 people so they just made us stand and wait. I will not be going back to this location nor will I be recommending it to my friends."
Mia H.,"San Diego, CA",61,2,,1.0,2/7/2014,"Very disappointing. We tried to eat here as a party of four and were told that our wait would be 60 minutes. No problem, we had the mall to help us bide time while we dutifully waited our turn, and this was a busy Friday night after all. One hour passes and there is no notification, an additional 30 minutes pass with no news and we decide to go check with the hostesses who informed us that we were next to be seated. We wait a bit longer, still aren't seated, and are then told by the manager, who happened to be at the desk, that although we have waited longer than the quoted wait time, there is another party of four ahead of us.  I imagine the food must be very good, how else to explain such a crowd? From past experience at other CFs, I know the cheesecake is delicious, but  don't go if you are actually hungry and aren't prepared for a longer than quoted wait time."
Elle K.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,26,3,1.0,12/31/2015,"What a terrible way to spend New Year's Eve! We checked in at the Escondido Cheesecake Factory at about 5 pm, looking for a table (for me, my husband and our baby). We were told 40 minutes, but that we should come back in 35. So we walked around the mall, then returned and waited from 5:35 until 6:10 when we finally left -- an hour and 10 minutes after we checked in, and 30 minutes after we were told we would be seated. I understand: it's New Year's Eve and it's busy. Fine. The problem is that when we checked with the front desk, we were told it would ""only be a few minutes"" and that we were ""next"" over and over, and yet they continued to seat tables of two and four ahead of us. They were obviously skipping over us -- I don't know why they could not have given us one of those tables of two or four. Finally, after we were told we were next and then they proceeded to seat another group of four ahead of us, we just left. There's only so long one can keep a baby entertained in a restaurant waiting area, and by 6:10 it was getting too late. It really ruined my NYE because, as parents, we only have a certain window of opportunity to dine out in the evening ad. Have an overpriced meal. A 40 minute wait would have been within that window. A. Hour and a half was not. So disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory. They really need to train their people better. If they'd told us the wait was over an hour, that would have been fine. If they had seated us instead of skipping over us, that wound have been great. But instead they were completely incompetent.  Awful experience."
Isabelle B.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/29/2013,good so good food ohho love it. I dont like that there's always long lines there.
Dan J.,"Oceanside, CA",1,16,12,5.0,9/20/2014,Some of the best food we had a longtime are  waiter Wast was the best we have seen in a longer time one I would definitely would request again
Kevin M.,"San Marcos, CA",0,125,1,4.0,4/28/2014,"This review is based off of two separate visits. I cannot recall the exact days but what I do recall is that our female server (a younger African-American server who told us she is studying at CSUSM) was very friendly, warm, and had a lot of suggestions to offer when we were interested in exploring new dishes; she also knew her menu quite well. Everything was great with her and our time there was enjoyable. I was considering giving a three star review simply because the server that took care of us the second time was not good at all and had zero personality, nor did he seem to even care about interacting with us or giving us service. He appeared annoyed that we had already purchase our libations (drinks) at the bar before sitting down or maybe that we were conversing in Spanish at the table. Originally, there was a 45-minute wait for a table so we decided to grab some cocktails to hold us over before sitting down at our table of four. The service area that really shined was the bartenders. There were two male bartenders working two Saturday nights ago and not only were they super friendly but super accommodating. The regular mojito I ordered was amazing, and I am usually very critical of mojitos since I make them at home but this one was top notch and I told the bartender it was one of the best I have had (he was working the service station/well for all restaurant orders). Anyways, the two bartenders that served us even offered to walk over one of our guest's hot teas to the table where we were moved when our table was ready. Now that is service! It was until our experience started with our server that it was a total let down. We dropped over $150 at the table but he couldn't be bothered with anything and was pretty much non-existent the entire time. I believe this was around 9 or 10 p.m. two Saturdays ago. Other than that, I would chalk it up to a 2 out of 3 situation. I would just simply ask to have another server next time so that somebody who is waiting on us actually appears to even have some small percentage of satisfaction in what they are doing because he apparently did not."
Shannon T.,"San Diego, CA",22,26,18,4.0,6/25/2014,Love the bang bang curry. Try I you will love it. Service was great! Live that they added this location to the north county mall.
Veronica C.,"Escondido, CA",133,151,45,2.0,1/15/2014,"I'd hate to give my favorite restaurant a less than okay review, but they need to change their policy for making reservations.  My first time here at this new location was for my friend's birthday. She called in advance and tried to make reservations for a party of 8, but she was told that it was ""not a large enough"" party to reserve for.  They did however, encourage for the whole party to walk in because they can ""easily accommodate"" the party.  We arrive and end up waiting ONE HOUR for a table.  I am 7 months pregnant, and that was just very miserable to have to wait that long.  When we were finally seated, they gave us complimentary appetizers of wontons, avocado eggrolls, and calamari.  We enjoyed them greatly!  Along with our entrees. I had my usual Miso Salmon that I never fail to order at this restaurant.  Our dining experience with our food was amazing as usual but does not entirely make up for the fact that we always have to wait this long whenever we dine as a group. Me & my friends love this place for their food, & it's too bad a good food experience can't be shared with each other without an ungodly wait. I would love to come here for my birthday, but this business is not group-friendly. This is not the first i have had a long wait experience despite attempts to make a reservation. Like I said, I really wish they would change their reservation policy.  It is unreasonable. They did not find us large enough to reserve seats for in advance BUT found us large enough to automatically charge gratuity. Other than that, if you're a small party you'll have a better experience at this restaurant for their delicious food."
Rubin U.,"Balboa Park, San Diego, CA",0,30,,4.0,8/13/2014,First time here. It was a little packed for a Wednesday. The service was a little slow. It was taking the waitress a while to go to our table. I'd say they were under staffed. But very professional and great food. Will come again.
Sheri W.,"Oceanside, CA",15,3,1,2.0,2/2/2014,"Went there with some friends last night (2/1) at 4:00pm to have an early dinner.... Turned out to be a much later dinner than expected.  The place was packed. Put our name in and was told it would be a 50 minute wait.  Well, it turned into an hour and a half wait.  About 10 minutes before we were called they finally told us that it was because we had a party of 7 and that they only had four tables that could accommodate.  WHAT!!!!! Would have been nice to have been told this 45 minutes ago or when we first put our name in.  What restaurant doesn't do reservations for larger parties????  They might want to rethink that so they don't have more angry customers waiting FOREVER for a table.  All in all I would not come back due to poor planning on their part.  Being in the restaurant business, customer service is the key for repeat customers, otherwise they will be loosing a lot of business to BJ's just across the way!!!  Wish we would have gone there instead."
Jules K.,"Escondido, CA",1,13,6,2.0,3/8/2014,"So I went with my friend to go eat some brunch today and our server was Alyssa. She was okay at first then she forgot our straws that we asked for and our bread that we asked for. 15 minutes later she comes back with the straws and tells us that our bread is baking, when clearly we see other servers bringing white bread to their tables. We had to ask another server for bread which he did bring and was very polite. After she forgot our straws and bread I was a little upset, but didn't make a big deal because I figured she was new because she didn't even know the menu. My friend ordered a salmon lunch special and she asked her what kind of rice she wanted with it when it doesn't even come with rice and then she never once came and asked how our food was. Now we're still pretty understandable at this point because we are servers as well and we understand servers forget things every now and then. However, I got upset when she passed our table on to a busser and was talking about us with her other coworkers. We could obviously tell she was complaining about us and talking bad about us.. There were 3 girls standing just pointing and staring at us. I felt very disrespected when a busser got us boxes and closed us out. Isn't that a servers job? I mean she was only on a 4 table rotation, well 3 since she gave up on us. I just felt that it was very unprofessional to give up on a table, if a table is upset you fix it, not run away and have a busser handle it when it's not even his job. In conclusion, the food was good and the workers were friendly and nice, but this girl has to go. She is rude and on top of it all she had a big hickey on her neck about a size of a golf ball. How unprofessional! I would definitely go back here but I will never ever sit in her section again.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory for giving you 2 stars but it really bugged me how she handled us just because we were young."
Matt C.,"San Diego, CA",110,113,128,2.0,10/28/2014,"Went here with some friends recently and it started out fine, normal wait time but once we were seated and the waitress greeted us it was all down hill from there. She apparently had requested to leave early that day and her manager would not let her go. We heard all of this as she complained to another waitress about 5 feet away from us. She then came back to take our food order before we even ordered drinks but we went ahead and ordered our food and drinks at the same time. The waitress then disappeared for about 15 minutes so we flagged down a young man who was bussing a table behind us and asked him about out drinks he was very apologetic and asked us our drink order and said he would get them right away. We then saw the waitress standing at the bar with 3 other employees and was very apparent that she was still complaining about her earlier issue. Our food was finally delivered to our table which was great except it cam before our appetizers. ....oh wait the appetizers never came...oh wait yes they did on the bill.....we pointed out to her that they were on the bill and she got an attitude and rolled her eyes and walked away with the bill and showed the manager who then came over and offered us free desert...although we appreciated the offer we opted to pass and while he was talking to us the waitress was standing about 15 feet away from us pointed at us as she talked to another  waitress and complaining about us. At this point I was so disgusted with her attitude I just want to get out of there .....the manager offered to comp our entire check. ..but I told him the best way to fix the problem was to give his employee some counseling and training. ...I did not need a free meal....I paid the bill and didn't look back....the only reason they get 2 stars is the busser"
Kasey E.,"Escondido, CA",78,25,5,2.0,6/20/2014,"So the food is good and clearly the cheesecake is delicious, but the set up of this restaurant for handicapped folks is atrocious. I'm in a wheelchair and there was no easy way to get into the restaurant. The doors weigh about a million pounds and there is no handicapped button to open the doors. I had to rely on the kindness of strangers to open the doors (yes, both doors. One door could not accommodate my wheelchair); apparently the 4 cheesecake factory workers at the host stand couldn't be bothered with opening the door for a customer; let alone a handicapped paying customer. Once inside, the was no easy way to the restrooms. There are two aisles to get you to the restrooms; both aisles had baby seats in the aisles and I could not fit. I had to ask the parents of the babies to move them so I could get by. Just a little embarrassing. To top it off, the restroom was disgusting and I could not even reach the sink. I do want to point that our waitress, Marcel, was wonderful. She was attentive and kind. We asked her opinion on several things and really felt like she gave us her honest opinion. Thank you, Marcel, for earning your restaurant 2 stars. If it wasn't for her, I would have rated this restaurant a 0."
Isabel J.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,1,1.0,1/6/2014,Food is way over priced! Everything we ordered was bland and mediocre. Server did not refill waters and we waited a long time for our food. Not a Cheesecake Factory fan. Will definitely not be back!! There are much better restaurants in San Diego!
D S.,"San Diego, CA",1,13,,1.0,1/2/2014,"Hated it :( crazy long wait, over baked food missing sauce since they ran out, did not have courtesy to tell. Waited for cheesecake which never came but was added to my check. Very unappetizing experience. Never had such disappointment at any other cheesecake location..."
Natalie H.,"Del Mar, CA",5,26,3,2.0,1/18/2014,"Very disappointed in this new location.  I have now eaten their 2 times and both were let downs.  My husband and I went for dinner last night and after waiting about 90 minutes (which we expected) we were seated at a small booth next to the kitchen.  We ordered an appetizer and drinks.  The appetizer came out almost immediately which made us believe it had just been sitting there waiting for someone to order it.  The drinks took close to 20 minutes.  The waiter said it was because they were waiting on the garnish but the strawberry they put on my drink looked rotted! It was very unappealing.  When it came time to order, the waiter informed me they were out of my selection so I had to choose something else.  He then returned to let me know that they were also out of my second selection.  He brought me a list of things they were out of which I would not expect for a restaurant to have to do.  I ended up just sharing my husbands meal with him and we left.  The number of people standing around at the hostess stand was surprising as well.  They were all just talking to each other.  For a staff this large, I would expect them to be more focused on a high level of customer service."
Matthew T.,"San Diego, CA",48,53,6,3.0,4/5/2014,Love that north county has a cheesecake factory. It was a pain having to drive down to fashion valley all the time. The food at cheesecake factory is always delicious but I have one complaint...go back to the old Tex mex egg rolls!!! Why did you change how you. make it? The guacamole sauce is gone and the egg roll wrap is thinner. It doesn't taste the same at all and its not a good thing. We won't be ordering what was our favorite appetizer in the future.
Stephanie S.,"Oceanside, CA",1,7,1,2.0,7/24/2014,Service is unacceptable. I was disappointed because I had a good time at the SD location. I was placed in a far end table where I was ignored most of the time. I asked for butter 4 times to two different people and it never came. I feel like that's very simple to obtain. Anyway the food was good. But I do not want to go back.
Lisa S.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,2.0,7/16/2015,"We started coming here instead of Fashion Valley because it's closer to home and they have gf options on their menu.  I've always dined at various ones throughout Southern California for the past 25 years and have always been extremely satisfied.  This particular location ""takes the cake"" on the worst service I've ever experienced at any restaurant.  We frequented this location often, twice a month, because we eat gf and there aren't many options in North County.  They have always -- I repeat -- always screwed up our order in one way or another.  It's just not worth the wait to be seated and an additional wait to remake the food.  Serious overhaul on management and training needs to be done.  They offered to pay for our dinner but then at the end of the meal the check arrived and it was full price for everything.  They couldn't even comp correctly like the manager offered to do.  I gave two stars because once the food arrives after the hour and a half it tastes as expected from having the same dishes at other locations."
