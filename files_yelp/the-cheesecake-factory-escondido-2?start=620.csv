Maria S.,"Escondido, CA",3,86,,3.0,3/20/2014,"Whenever I go to any Cheesecake Factory, I order the Hibachi Steak.  It tasted ok, but, I think the shitake was very pungent.  I've had the same entree at different TCFs but I don't remember the mushroom overpowering the taste of the dish.  That being said, everyone else at my party seemed to enjoy their orders. The wait staff was very attentive, although my husband insists that the hostess was rather slow and ""not-on-the-ball"".  She called our party when the table wasn't ready, so we had to herd back to the waiting area.  The wait that Friday night was an hour--  we were told an hour and we waited an hour.  Good estimate.  At the hostess station, they ask for a phone number.  Gone are those pagers that light up.  You get two text messages, one to verify the number and the second to tell you that your table is ready.  Over-all good experience, but really, nothing sets it apart from any other Cheesecake Factory.  If only they took reservations!"
Emily V.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/23/2014,Had dinner at the cheesecake last night.  The chicken madera was delicious.  My fiancé ordered the hibachi steak and it was cooked perfectly.  The service was thoughtful and courteous.  As a nursing student I rarely have time to go out so this was a real treat.  Our server was super sweet and Rebecca the manager bought me a birthday slice of cheesecake.  I can still taste the strawberry glaze on my lips.  They made my birthday special and I will be back.
Gabe J.,"San Diego, CA",28,149,199,5.0,12/8/2013,"My husband and I had a pretty late dinner on Saturday night, at 9 p.m. we were happy to hear that they didn't close until midnight, so we wouldn't have to rush to get out of there. Originally we were going to go to BJ's then realized CF was opended and looked like people were still in. We were greeted immediately and seated. There seems to be quite a bit of staff on hand, becuase it was later seemed like some were congregating in throngs where we couldn't get through until the server made his way through and they were all very friendly. The server told us the special of the day, grilled salmon on a bed of rice, brown or white with some type of coconut sauce. That sounded good to me and not too heavy, my husband opted for the cajun pasta. My dinner was exceptionally delicious, not too heavy on the coconut taste or sauce as a matter of fact my husband kept coming back for more after insisting he taste it. His was pretty good too but I loved mine. We both had decided to only eat 1/2 or less of our dinner so we could have dessert, which we did. We opted for the Apple Crumb cheesecake and it was delish. Excellent Customer Service & Food, found a new option in Escondido... normally not crazy about chain restaurants but if you must...this is a grreat option."
Beatriz P.,"Vista, CA",2,62,26,4.0,1/11/2014,this place was awesome their service was great the waitress that helped us was very friendly and helpful we had a great exp. the food was excellent  as well . I will be coming back again :)
Daniel M.,"Temecula, CA",8,4,,1.0,1/16/2014,"Service was terrible.  Waited 10 minutes after being seated. , then had to flag down a server to get service.  After order was taken took 30 more minutes till food was delivered."
Nagina A.,"San Diego, CA",418,12,,1.0,2/14/2014,"Extremely long wait, manager was extremely rude, server forgot to put in an order for the meal and we ended up leaving at 11PM never again worst experience ever"
Brandon B.,"San Marcos, CA",0,31,,2.0,3/28/2014,"I don't get this place at all. The menu is like 30 pages and full of ads for clothes? We got seated pretty quick as we wanted the patio. The inside is cramped and noisy anyways. The food we did have was decent, the beers were underpoured and 6.50 each. There's a reason why there's not drink prices listed in the menu. The service is SLOW, although after we got the bill I was happy it took so long to get drinks. To sum up the experience, 133$ for 2 burgers, 1 fish and chips, an appetizer and 2 rounds of drinks for 4 people. Just ridiculously over-priced for the service and what you get. Not going back."
Roma B.,"Poway, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/15/2014,"Don't get this wrong the food was great and attractively served and our server was pleasant and polite. It was the manager that ruined the experience! After waiting for 20 minutes on a Thursday night we received a text that our table was ready, we came to the desk and then proceeded to follow the hostess to our table. No menus were given, but we were happy to be seated, when along comes Jeff the manger accusing us of seating ourselves and not waiting but, rather jumping the line! He was very nasty and even though we showed him the text, he continued to berate us! This man should not be in the hospitality business since he has no interpersonal skills! Cheesecake Factory should put him back in the kitchen washing dishes, where he will not be able to offend people, Who in the world promoted him to manager???"
maven o.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,4,2.0,7/18/2014,"""Once you get to your table"", the experience is very well executed.  The service is excellent, the menu is expansive, and the food is great.  The key phrase is ""once you get to your table""!!  All TCF's are famous for something that they seem to wear as a badge of honor, but is actually a major systemic failure; that being the painfully long waits to be seated.  This particular store has deployed a table management system that will text your phone when your table is ready.  Then the guest has 3 minutes (that's right, 3 MINUTES) to report back to the host stand.  Unfortunately, this system requires that the guest has excellent cell service, which at NCF is problematic for most cell companies.  With all other aspects of service and food running seamingly well, TCF leadership needs to focus on the management of their host systems and training of their host staff. Having guests stand outside your restaurant for hour+ waits is not evidence of success.  On the contrary, it is evidence of a restaurant that is not being managed well and is not delivering a positive guest experience."
Emily P.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,4,5.0,12/8/2013,"I absolutely love this location. It is smaller than most other cheesecake factories but in my opinion is a lot nicer! I was prepared for the wait so I didn't mind. And I love the new texting service, I didn't have to stay in or just outside the restaurant for however long I was quoted I had the ability to roam the mall. When I was called the host staff was very friendly and quick with getting me seated in a good amount of time. Literally right after being sat, the server was there taking drink orders and brining bread. She was very friendly and knew the menu. I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo as well as the Parmesan bread. The food was beyond amazing. Compared to my fettuccini from fashion valley, this one tasted freshly made. The Parmesan bread was to die for, like beyond amazing! Not only did the servers check on me, but the host staff did as well which was nice! They came by every so often asking if everything was okay and if I needed drink refills. Overall everything was amazing. I'm very thankful that I no longer have to make the drive all the way to fashion valley anymore. I will most definitely be coming back.  The staff and food is absolutely fantastic! Best cheesecake ever!!"
Erica L.,"San Diego, CA",174,6,,1.0,1/19/2014,"I don't ever write these reviews, but after my horrible experience today, I decided should. First of all, we were told that for a party of 7 the wait would be 40-50 minutes. We walked around the mall and came back 40 minutes later, and ended up having to wait for an hour and a half total. I really wish that the hostess would have given an honest time. It wasn't just the wait, it was the service after. Lunch took two hours. First when we sat down, we noticed the plates were dirty and looked like they had boogers on them... Then we were informed that the bread was out. We were all starving so we ordered quickly, but the young waitress (or the chef possibly), missed one of our friends orders. He sat there while we ate and were all finished before the waitress finally came to check back and realized he had no food.... the manager came and offered to give him the meal for free to go. He said sure so the waitress went and took another 30 minutes to get the sandwich to go while we all waited. Then she realized she forgot the French fries and went back to get them.... but never came back with them. Checks took forever to come. I wish I could say this was all that happened, but there were literally at least 10 incidences in one sitting. I was just happy to make it back into the sunlight eventually... never thought I would escape the esco cheesecake factory. Never will be going back. ever."
Alyssa B.,"Poway, CA",2,4,,1.0,9/17/2014,"slow service. some lady at front said wait time was 15-20 minutes. thats fine... after 20 minutes she told us out table is ready, probably about 5 groups was seated before us while waiting on the side. when wer seated server showed up right away. took our order then left. didnt serve bread at all my mom had to ask. waited another 30 minutes to serve the appetizer, then probably another 45 minutes before we got our actual meal. server was nice but super slow. hoping for a better service nexttime we visit. but food was great."
Cherie M.,"San Marcos, CA",12,14,,2.0,12/12/2013,"We have been there twice since the grand opening.  Both times we were there for 2 hours + and that was after the 45 minute wait.  Our last visit was on Wed. the 11th.  We were told it was a 30 minute wait, it ended up being 45 and then they tried to sit us in the bar with 2 small children.  We had requested a booth when we first checked in.  When we were finally seated, we were told they were out of bread and that they were making some.  One server came by and tried to serve us another table's appetizer.  There was no bread, so we ordered ourselves appetizers and two of them were finally delivered.  They tried to serve us our dinner before the last appetizer arrived.  Cheesy bread is not worth ordering, pot stickers were good and the Buffalo blasts are awesome and a must have!  Most of our entrees were good.  The shepherd's pie consisted of burned hamburger with shredded vegetables, mushrooms and mashed potatoes slapped on the top of the mess.  The head manager, John, came by to apologize and said he would take it off the bill....that's it....really!  Final straw was when we asked for the peppermint bark cheese cake, we were told they were out of it.  That was the reason we came!  I also have to mention it was my birthday and one of the staff members was told and no one even acknowledged it.  I have been to many Cheese Cake Factories, but this one needs to work out sooo many kinks.  The food is usually always good at the Factories, but I think the small kitchen at this location has a hard time keeping up.  If you decide to try it out, make sure you allow for 3 hours of your day or evening."
Lisa K.,"Carlsbad, CA",30,13,,2.0,6/5/2014,"I normally LOVE The Cheesecake Factory - lots of yummy choices, great ambiance, friendly staff. This location has all of that, BUT while eating my food, a gnat flew right into my salad and didn't fly back out. As I waited for the waitress to come around so I could tell her, I glanced up at the wall above our table and saw not one, not two, but FIVE gnats just hanging out! Eeeewwww!!! We told the waitress and showed her the gnats and she apologized and mentioned how strange it was because every night, they spray all over the place (while motioning to the walls, seats, and TABLES!). Great, so now we're being told there's probably chemicals everywhere, and they're not even working! She said she would tell her manager and asked if I wanted another salad. Um, no thanks, lost my appetite. She came back with the check, and while I wouldn't demand free food or anything, some sort of comp would have been a nice gesture in this situation. Nope,  just a full bill for all the food, including mine that I didn't eat. Definitely not returning to this location."
Tiffani S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,19,1,1.0,3/7/2014,"My daughter and I went to this location for a late lunch (about 3:00). We sat in the bar area (not at the bar). We weren't greeted by our server for about 15 minutes. She did not apologize for the delay. Took our drink order and I told her what we wanted for an appetizer. Received our appetizer and ordered our lunch. While waiting I asked for bread. After about 10 minutes the server said the bread was baking and would be out soon. She mentioned that she was having a tough day. Because her first table left her a religious pamphlet for a tip. And she was catholic so what were they thinking. Our food came out and our order was wrong. The girl that brought us our food took it back to be corrected. Tina said she ordered the food wrong. She checked on us once after getting the correct order. And we only sawing her waiting on others after that. We both were out of drinks, she would see us looking at her but never came back. About 30 minutes later I saw her checking out. Looking at her receipts and then she left (I guess her shift was over). We were'nt offered anything else (drinks, dessert-which we mentioned we wanted cheesecake). She just left. We at that point could have left (our $48 bill unpaid) and no one would have known anything different. I flagged down another server and she said she would get the server who was taking care of the tables behind us to help us. We told the new server about what was happening, that we had been abandoned and ignored. He didn't apologize. Just said he was a trainer and would coach her on the situation. I asked him if there was a way our tip could go to him. Because we were so disappointed in the service we had gotten. He said no. He took our cheesecake order and 10 minutes later we received our dessert. Luckily we had saved our spoons as we weren't offered silverware. We both were still out of drinks. I went up to the bar and got 2 glasses of water. The cheesecake slices were large so we wanted to-go containers. My daughter went up to the to-go/cheesecake area and got containers. We then took our check up to the same counter to pay our bill. As Michael didn't come back. He then saw us and came up to the counter and said he would process our bill. I was disappointed that I felt like I gave Michael the chance to make a bad situation better. And he didn't take advantage of that opportunity. As a side note I felt like the bartenders could see we were being neglected and didn't extend any help. I have to believe this is a reflection of the manager of this location."
Brenda N.,"Vista, CA",0,15,,2.0,9/2/2014,"Very disappointed in this location of the CCF!  To bad too because it is closer to my home then the San Diego location which has great food and service.  I had been to the CCF about four months ago here  in Escondido. I went with my daughter for a birthday lunch.  I ordered a turkey burger it came out raw in the middle.  I sent it back and the waitress could not understand why. I told her you can get sick from raw turkey meat. It's not beef where if it is a little pink you can eat it. Anyway she took it back with attitude.  It came back still raw by then I had no appetite.  I asked to speak to a manager and he took it off the bill. He did apologize but no offer of a piece of cheesecake or anything. It was my birthday! They made it seem like I was crazy for sending it back. I got the district managers number on the way out. I called him the next day. He was very apologetic and sent me a 15 dollar gift card for a couple of pieces of cheesecake since it ruined my birthday lunch. My husband decided on Sunday,8/31/14,night to use out gift card for cheesecake. I was looking forward to if since I have been watching my diet and this was a splurge. He ordered the cherry CC for me and the Hershey's 30th birthday CC for himself . Well we get home and guess what they gave us Oreo CC and I thought Hershey's. I don't  like chocolate CC. I like the regular and that's why I got the cherry one.  I called and talked to Tony and he apologized and said he would send me a gift card so I can get the right CC.  Well my husband ate the second piece of CC which he had wanted the Hershey' s 30th birthday CC yesterday. Well it was chocolate peanut butter CC. So neither one if us got out what we wanted. I can't call now and yes he got two pieces of CC.  You want what you want and the receipt said cherry CC and the Hershey birthday CC. How hard is it to look at the receipt and do it right. You spend good money at CCF. I also was comparing it to the SD location which is on point. I also asked to have someone call me. No call but I did a get raw turkey burger, service with an attitude and the wrong cheesecake."
Eder M.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/8/2014,"Worst restaurant experience ever! Told that waiting time was between 65-80 minutes. We came in on time but it's been 100 minutes and no one had texted my cell yet. I approached them and said to wait a little bit more. Finally called us after  15min. more. Overall, waiting time is way over delayed. Next, waiter came and never introduced himself and took our order. He served us bread but never gave us our drinks. We finished the bread and choking but still no drinks so I have to call someone for that. Next, we ordered appetizer but this neither was served. He came back with our entree (main order) but no appetizer and when I asked about it, he said, Oh you never got it? Hello!!!You were the one serving us! I just cancelled the appetizer of course. Lastly, I asked him to box left overs for 3 plates and just came with 2 boxes. He said he'd look for it but I told him being so frustrated already that I have spent so much time here already and I can't deal with more waiting time. You can have it! I didn't get the name of the server, unfortunately, but he looks like Hispanic and a bit heavy."
Kim M.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/6/2014,"I have to say that my experience at the Escondido Cheesecake Factory was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant so far. I have been in the industry as a Manager/Owner/Server/GM. I think I have done all rolls and I have to say I will not go back to that location. The hostess was rude and unprofessional. We waited over 2 hours to be seated outside at night in the cold with a three year old. When asked to move inside, we waited again and never actually got sat inside. They forgot our salads. When the food came it , the weather was so cold that it turned cold very quickly. When speaking with the Manager, Rebecca, regarding our experience all she said was she would address the hostess. We ended up taking our food to go and heating it up when we got home. $100 later, cold and still hungry it was awful. Then top it off my daughter came down with a horrible cold from being out in the cold."
Sal J.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,18,2.0,5/13/2014,"i am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory, as a matter of fact whenever i go to Las Vegas i only dine at Grand Lux inside Venetian and the Palazzo, which is the same as Cheesecake Factory. I was going from up north all the way to Fashion Valley to eat, thank God they opened one in Escondido. so i went to dine with my wife and kids and other family member i would say 9 of us. the manager who i hate had to be there that day ( i remember him from the San Diego location) made us wait almost 2 hours on a day that it was slow day. my kids were crying for being hungry and this manager i guess his name is Phil? did not even once came to us to say that we are being taken care soon or they are putting tables together. i saw a family of 8 came in and got seated before us and when i asked how come the gals at the register told us ""they are smaller party than your"", by 1 person? it sucked, i did not enjoy my food and i was pissed all night at the place. phil does not belong to this nice and elegant establishment. Get a new person to run this beautiful place."
Sunny C.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/18/2014,"My family went for a lunch over the weekend and I would have to say that the hosts and servers should be trained more in terms of having everything flow in the restaurant.  We've been to other cheesecake factory locations many times and by far, this one has to be the one that the service and the foods aren't meeting the standard expectation like the other locations.  The resautrant was pretty crowded since it was a saturday afternoon so it took around 30 minutes to get a table outside in the sun which were all ok but getting the foods waiting after 1 hour of putting the order in was not what we were expecting.  So, we asked the server to togo the food since it took too long to come out and it was getting too uncomfortable sitting in the sun for an hour with no shade.  After getting home, I was a half way through my salad and I found a piece of paper lookign thing in my food and totally lost my appetite.  I wanted so badly to take the food back get the money back but it would be too inconvenient."
