Alek Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/2/2014,"I always had good memories with cheesecake factory restaurants in OC and Los Angeles and here in San Diego so for mother's birthdays we thought it is great to go to their Escandido branch but it became the worst experience with cheesecake factory restaurant and I am not recommending anybody to go to this branch of cheesecake factory in Escandido in Via rancho pkwy! It was Sunday and not really busy day we placed our order, after 40 minutes the server came back saying sorry guys I forgot to send your order to the kitchen and it is going to take 10 more minute and we put your order as the priority! It takes them 20 minutes and then they brought each order in 5 minute intervals and server stating she doesn't have enough hand, what a dumb excuse! Is it priority! After we were done server brought the bill and she just remembered we mentioned it is my mom birthday so she brought a slice of cake and brought us another check! It takes her forever to bring the boxes so we have to ask another server for boxes! Unfortunately here they have poor customer service and respect for their guests! Managements needs to do more training for the servers, I don't mind waiting for my order but this not a reasonable excuse that the server forgot to send the order to kitchen on a slow working day! I should mention that the manager is really passive we brought up the problem to him and he was asking what should I do , they need stronger management so problem solved on the table since he knew the problem from the beginning. This was the last time my family have their party in Cheesecake factory in Escandido."
