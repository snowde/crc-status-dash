Sonali A.,"San Marcos, CA",14,9,1,1.0,7/13/2017,Customer service  also sucks as they have not followed up with my experience at cheesecake factory-after being accused and  treated disrespectfully -it shows cheesecake factory does not care what people have to say
Jake C.,"Oceanside, CA",109,2,,1.0,3/1/2017,"Came in on a Wednesday evening, waited 50 mins, only to be seated outside, which was available from the start of the wait.  The server takes us to a 4 person table for our 5 person party, with the table lacking the extra 5th seat, taking a good while to bring the chair. After being sat for 5 minutes with no water, table wasn't even ready or having a server come by we decided we won't spend a dime here, and left. Asked for the Manager. I told him, ""What would make a customer want to come to a restaurant where there is clearly available seating outside?"".   He explained, how there was a server that called out sick, and cited the reason why it could not be staffed.  Funny thing is, there were a couple of tables that were being occupied outside from when we arrived at the start. An established corporation such as Cheesecake Factory should not have such a minimum staffed restaurant. Little hiccups like this are common in the restaurant industry."
Jason K.,"Prineville, OR",91,95,227,5.0,3/2/2017,"The food was really good.  Danielle Dodd, our waitress, was awesome! Our food was quick and  time l ordered ranch for my chicken tortillas (recommend it) she was on the ball! Her personality was awesome and made our date night even better. Thank you"
Justine G.,"Encinitas, CA",1,5,,2.0,1/2/2018,"Ate there today and was extremely disappointed.  I have always loved this chain and have been to many and had great good and service.  This was my first (and last) in Escondido.  My food order was wrong and when I told the food runner they seemed annoyed.  They asked if I wanted anything else and since I was in a hurry I said no because I did not have time for them to make me a new order.  The waiter finally came back to check on the food when I was half way done with my plate.  I told him about the 2 mistakes that where made on my plate and he just shrugged and said that is how he ordered the food.  Aside from having the wrong sauce on them and coming with sour cream that I had asked to be left off, the bottoms of the enchiladas were burnt and tough to eat.  Would have reported this to the server if he had come back sooner.  He sheepishly brought my check and did not offer to take anything off, or dessert or anything. Most of staff (hostess, runner, waiter) seemed very apathetic.  Next time I will go to Carlsbad, hopefully that will be better."
Gary Y.,"Escondido, CA",0,50,,2.0,7/30/2017,"Went there for lunch with my wife and two friends. I got the pot stickers, one got the burger sliders and two got the salad, soup, 1/2 sandwich combo.  Sliders and pot stickers were good. The main problem was the soup. The meal came out followed by the manager. He indicated that the soup needed to be redone so a new batch was being made. To make a long story short,  the soup did not come out until we had finished our meals. We got it to go. The manager never offered any compensation for the late soup. To me,  this was not good customer service. After reading other reviews I have decided not to return to this location. The manager at the place and customer services that answer these comments need to know that SORRY FOR THE POOR SERVICE only goes so far."
Michele F.,"Riverside, CA",146,14,1,1.0,8/2/2017,We just came in for dinner and the waiter messed up my meal and he said it would take 10min to fix it nope more like 20. My husband was done with his meal way before mine ever came out  the waiter kept apologizing and the manager didn't even come to talk to me about what happened so when the bill came we were surprised to see they had charged my food after all that so we asked for the manager and he felt like it was such an inconvenience to take it off. He was rude and didn't even apologize for what happened.. Horrible just horrible
Lentes C.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,13,1.0,3/5/2017,"Worst service!!, waited for over 25 minutes finally my pager goes off, turn it in and the told me to please wait and they where doing this to everyone. Why even give us a pager to wait since we still had to wait for them to call my name. Elderly gentleman with service dog standing and waiting for his name to be called! Bad service."
E P.,"San Marcos, CA",0,16,2,1.0,11/30/2017,"Yesterday we were celebrating my husband's birthday here. When we came in there was no wait, we were sat within few minutes it was great start! But then after we sat , we were not offered simple thing as water.....we were waiting for the server for 35 mins( on a Wednesday night, they were not busy at all), my 6 years old daughter was hungry...... the table next to us who came later than us already got served.....finally I got up and went to the front to find out what was going on. I got another server that was not assigned to our table to get us at least iced waters and she was kind enough to take our entire order. And she offered to get a manager to come to our table, but I told her that it was ok. 2 minutes later our server Jeremy K. came to our table and told us that he was taking his break and that's the reason we were not served on time.....I was not born yesterday,  I saw him serving other tables, he just forgot about ours!!! Finally towards the end of our dinner , I asked him if I can order a lunch portion of fish and chips to go and he rudely responded no, than I was completely turned off by this restaurant , so  we decided to go and get desert at BJ'S!"
Feeras W.,"Oceanside, CA",3,4,,1.0,8/6/2017,"Worst customer service, bad attitude from the waitress. Waiting for over 30 mints to get service.  Never go there again. This branch need new management. Very low quality service Manager very bad attitude, low skills."
Bruce L.,"Encinitas, CA",0,13,6,4.0,9/21/2017,"Went on a Friday night to celebrate my wife's birthday. We had dinner appetizers and drinks, everything was excellent. Our server was on point, very helpful and made sure we had everthing that we needed. Over all experience was great, the waiting time to be seated was not bad and the food was brought out in a usually timely matter what is expected. I approve!!"
Michael M.,"Escondido, CA",23,4,,1.0,7/18/2017,Monday night - a wait 30 mins for seating. Went to the bar an waited almost 15 mins to get acknowledged from single bartender. By the way find out he does bar seating for 15 and the whole restaurant ! Bad really bad service- Order food another 10 min wait and guess what they mess up on a Beet salad- ONE BEET ON THE PLATE- WTF! Restaurant manager comes over after 25 mins and delivers food. After the delay and slow service bills comes at full price and nothing removed from manager- policy is they will not comp drinks ! .  So really nothing on their end except an apologize- I wasn't impressed and going out is about the experience. They are unwilling to make concessions and really try to improve the experience- Never again ! Good luck on your Carlsbad location ! Families with children will go over the top in frustration. Mac M
Rayna J.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",166,198,32,3.0,2/13/2017,"Came here on a little date night with my love! It was pretty good. We ordered the Chicken Parm, however received the Parmesan Chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. Wasn't what we expected but we were hungry so no complaints. We didn't even let the waiter know. HA.  It was actually delicious, almost more delicious than the Chicken Parm would have been.  I did have an amazing little cocktail while I was there. The Blood Orange Martini, alright let's not lie...it was 2 martinis cause they were that good.  Overall it was a good experience. Nothing to rave about but, good service, good cocktails. Wrong meal, completely understandable with all their options with similar names.  I'd come back :)"
CJ H.,"Murrieta, CA",39,23,,2.0,11/3/2017,"We have dined at the Cheesecake Factory many times, but will probably not do so in the future, at least at the Escondido location.  We were notified of a ten minute wait, no worries - we enjoyed a drink at the bar.  When our ""buzzer"" final alerted us our table was ready, we waited for too long for someone to direct us to our table.  Once seated, my wife had to remind the waitress three times to bring her the requested drink.  We ordered appetizers and our main course.  After too long of a wait the main course arrived, no appetizers?!?  The manager apologized and said it would be removed from the tab (that's all, an ""oops, we won't charge you?!"" My wife requested blue cheese crumbles for her sandwich, the server acknowledged, ""crumbles, correct?""  When it came, it was blue cheese dressing.  Being too long of a wait, we ordered two cheesecake slices to go, red velvet and Godiva - we realized we got red velvet and dulce de luche - I like both so I ignored the mistake.  If that is not enough, we get the bill, and guess what?  We were being charged for the absent-appetizer.  After more time, and bringing this to the attention of the server, it was corrected.  Overall, a very disappointing meal...."
Andre' N.,"Winnetka, CA",19,6,2,5.0,3/30/2017,The grilled lunch salmon where excellent!! Love this place and the staff are the best
Karen H.,"San Diego, CA",131,430,4105,5.0,2/15/2016,"I had no idea they opened a Cheesecake Factory here! We stopped in after shopping. It was during a heavy rainstorm and it was packed inside. We walked in thinking the worst about the wait time. Took us by surprise it was only 10 minutes and they sent a text message to my phone when our table was ready. Our server was great and the food came out really quick. Their menu is huge but they make everything on it so well. I ordered the Cajun pasta with shrimp and chicken. It was mouth watering good! The spices and flavor were bold but not overpowering. It came out piping hot, I wanted to eat the entire plate but my eyes are bigger than my stomach. BF ordered a  chicken Parmesan sandwich with a side of marinara sauce for dipping came with a side salad. We upgraded to a Cesar salad for a little extra. Sandwich was also really good. The breading on the sandwich was just right not overdone.  Great experience at this location, we'll be back!"
Hppn H.,"San Diego, CA",11,48,305,3.0,9/5/2016,"Well was in the mood for some dessert but as you know it, once you get here the smell of some dishes are very tantalizing.  Opted to take a booth outside as the evening was winding down and it was actually very nice.  So back to the initial plan, it was to grab some dessert and just hang out with the family.  After looking over the drink menu and with a few questions, opted for the Pineapple Mule.  Was told it was just the right amount of sweetness.  After the drinks came out, the appetite started to waiver a bit and we perused the menu again just in case something caught our eye, and as we have been to other Cheesecake Factory's, we saw the Avocado Eggrolls with the tamarind dipping sauce, and that has always been a staple for us.  Figured since we are here and the little one is behaving for the moment, lets just have dinner and hes wanting pasta, so lets kill two birds with one stone.   So dessert turned into dinner and here we go.  As noted, we have been to Cheesecake a few times in the past, so there are dishes that we like and others we have yet to try.  But being that we did not want to always order the usual, we opted for dishes we haven't had in a long while but thought it may be good to try again. So for appetizers, we opted for the Avocado Eggrolls and Hot Cheese and Spinach dip.  Lets say the eggrolls never disappoint, but the Spinach dip needed more to desire.  It came out hot with fresh chips, a side of sour cream and chopped tomatoes, but the kicker was the spinach and cheese seemed more like a side dish at a steak house rather than a cheesy dip.  That was lackluster at best and to boot, it was very bland.   Entrees we opted for the Crusted Chicken Romano, and the Carbonara with Chicken.  Now these fared much better in overall taste.  The Crusted Chicken Romano could have used a bit more sauce, but overall it was a decent dish.  The two cutlets and mound of spaghetti was not bad, but could have used a bit more salt. For the Carbonara with Chicken that was really good.  The sauce was thick and the noodles were coated well with the sauce so it was not dry.  It was not as rich in taste, but that is a personal preference, but the chicken was tender and the overall taste was good.  Would recommend this dish. Alternative:  We did not have the Shrimp Scampi tonight or the Spicy Chicken with Cashews (which you can also request with Shrimp) those are by far good solid dishes.  The Spicy Cashew Chicken with Shrimp is an original from way back, but they only show it with Chicken, however you can add the shrimp and definitely something youll want to go back for. As for the real reason why we came here initially was for dessert, after having the dinner feast we went down the list for something fresh and would clean the palate, and since we have tried the many cheesecakes before, there was one that we had yet to try and it was surely worth the trip down, and that was the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake.  Its tartness from the Key Lime and sweetness of the mango really cuts through the cheesecake giving you those layers of flavors that just hit the sides of your mouth and make it water.  If your looking for something to just have a fresh palate, that is a recommendation, but note it has sweetness to it, but enough where it just taste good.   If your in the mall shopping and want something decent, I would suggest hitting up this establishment and of course they have a full bar which is always nice if you've been shopping all day and need to unwind."
Serey G.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,9/8/2017,"Coming from a job that is big on customer service I can say I am blown away with the service at this Cheesecake Factory. It can definitely be stressful when having to explain to customers that their food will be out later then expected and David (The Manager) handles those tough situations LIKE A BOSS. Not only does he crack jokes at the appropriate time he caters to all customers no matter what their needs are and with 100% respect. Another person I had the pleasure to meet was Denise. She was an amazing server, very accommodating and overall extremely sweet."
Ashley A.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/8/2017,Came here with my friend today to grab some yummy food and we came across amazing waiters and the two that stood out was David the manager and Denise our waitress! OH MY GOSH . So sweet and so kind . Our food came alittle late but came by and apologized . And crack some jokes here and there . I hate giving people a hard time when they are genuinely so sweet and kind. You guys go through so much daily and I saw David in a little situation with 2 ladies who just gave him alittle hard time but he handled it so well! Didn't do any attitude nor annoyed . I applaud him and I loved the service I got! THANK YOU DAVID AND DENISE
Tiffany B.,"Oakland, CA",108,158,287,2.0,1/8/2017,"Although our server was very pleasant, we waited nearly 40 minutes for our food. We received a text for a table at 7:17, we got waters and most definitely put in our order by 7:40. Our friend received her avocado egg rolls and we were still waiting on our food. Maybe 15 minutes later we revived ours at 8:10. One friend ordered a cold turkey sandwich and I got a veggie sandwich. I'm not sure what the wait was about for something so simple."
Monika L.,"San Diego, CA",26,100,622,5.0,8/16/2016,Great food and great service! We opt to go to this location instead of the Valley because everything's better.  Only about a 15 minute wait to be seated. Servers are very attentive in bringing bread and refills on drinks. It was hard for us to decide what to get as everything sounded so good! We ended up having a grilled chicken and avocado club (DELICIOUS) and two chicken salad sandwiches. The bread on the sandwiches is  perfectly soft and their portions are very generous.  Will definitely be back! Love it here!
