Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, VA",53,10,9,4.0,12/20/2017,I only have one negative.  The wait after we got to our table was 20 mins long. We had been there almost 45 mins before even getting to order food. We were a party of 9 goin around Sunday Brunch time. Overall the food was great! Fresh squeezed orange juice was so delicious.  Many more menu options then I was expecting. I had a gift card here and I would definitely go again for a date night.  Strawberry Cheesecake was heavenly!!
Francis F.,"Herndon, VA",11,55,5,4.0,11/29/2017,"The Pina Coladas were unusually cold. And not just fun icee cold. An uncomfortable cold. Arctic cold.  I got brain freeze.  I also got esophagus freeze. Seriously, my esophagus froze up on me.  They may be made with liquid nitrogen. If you order a Pina Colada, ask them to pop it in the microwave first. Update: 11/30/2017 Cheesecake Factory - Thank you so much for your kind response. I was touched. It's truly rare for a business to reach out like that. Accordingly, I've increased your rating to 4 stars.  On a positive note, your Pina Coladas would be a perfect glimpse for someone thinking about cryogenics."
Yijun W.,"Vienna, VA",0,3,,2.0,11/26/2017,"I have been to many other Cheesecake Facotory and I always love them, food-wise and service-wise. But I just ordered the worst sandwich I have ever had, a grilled turkey burger, in this place.  The meat tastes weird and the sweet potato fries are stale. Yes, I even made sure with the server that it is turkey. Honestly, right after I ate no more than half of the sandwich, my stomach started to feel bad. The service was not too bad at this location but my previous experience at other locations was much better. I understand that it's holiday season and our server must be very busy. But he didn't check with us once and not even asked if we need a To-Go box. For a moment I thought I was in a small diner. Good thing is my boyfriend likes his steak Diane. But I'm still doubtful on returning to this location."
Jayne G.,"Chester, VA",31,87,208,4.0,11/17/2017,I have to be honest and say that I debated over giving a 3 star or a 4 star rating (If Yelp had 1/2 stars it would be a 3.5) 3 stars because of the wait. It was loooonnnnggggg. I expect that with a chain restaurant in a mall on a weekend. The problem is they should under promise and over deliver. I would rather be told it will be an hour and a half and get seated after an hour and 15 minutes then to be told an hour and a half and be seated after 2 hours. We were all getting crabby and tired of waiting towards the end there. 4 stars because to food. I have yet to have a bad meal at any Cheesecake factory and this one was no exception. The food was delicious and not just because we were starving ;) They have huge menu and everything is delicious. All four people in my party enjoyed their food. So good job Cheesecake factory - you are about so much more than cheesecake (in fact we were to full to have any!)
Jessica E.,"Franconia, VA",89,66,400,4.0,11/8/2017,"I loooove the Cheesecake Factory! It's always a treat going for lunch or dinner. The food selection is excellent - everyone will find something they like. The cheesecake selection is crazy. There's like 30+ cheesecakes to choose from and an additional dessert menu with even more choices. I really enjoy the decor and service, as well! This time, I went for lunch with some coworkers and it was packed. The waiting time was about 15 minutes and our food took a while to come out. The food itself was very tasty though. if you ever decide to order the burrito, keep in mind that it's HUGE. Our server was very friendly! I just find it kind of strange that with such a large food selection, there's absolutely no soup section. Just a soup of the day. Wish there were more!"
Heidi L.,"Fairfax, VA",48,115,267,3.0,8/31/2017,"Definitely a great dessert place as well known for but okay food and not too bad service. My friend and I went there for a late dinner. We were seated almost right away. Our server's name was Chris. I think he must had a long day already. I felt bad but I still asked for what I would love to have. I did appreciate his best effort.  I dont want to say too much about this restaurant because they're pretty generic, food-wise and service-wise. Nothing really was too remarkable. You know what to expect when you go to any franchise restaurant.  I would go there possibly again but not probably within this year."
Narisa P.,"Herndon, VA",66,23,32,4.0,1/2/2018,Love eating here and came here many times but sometime unlucky didn't get the best service but the food is always good :)
薇薇,"Burke, VA",6,33,68,4.0,10/30/2017,If you like eating cheese cake You should try their cake The cheesecake is so amazing  And I couldn't stop eat it even I was so full
Lash T.,"Fairfax, VA",33,6,,2.0,12/29/2017,"I understand that we were little late, they close at 12:30 and we arrived there around 11:20, we got worst service ever. I don't know what was the servers problem, he didn't want to stay on our table even while he was taking our order, may be we were not looking good, haha, jk. He was in rush all the time but there were no customers in the restaurant. Service was not attentive, they asked us if we needed any boxes to wrap our food while we were still having the food, that was disappointing. The food was delicious though, i loved their fish and pasta."
Kaitlyn H.,"Manassas, VA",125,11,2,4.0,8/9/2017,"I have always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory but the service can be slow at times due to the number of tables that they have. The same thing goes for the food - it can take a while to receive your meal, or even just the bread for the table, since the place gets so busy. Overall, the food is delicious and I love the different items that the menu offers. You can't go wrong with any type of cheesecake, and they love to help you celebrate a birthday! The one major downside is the lack of organization with their pager system and getting a table. I had a meal planned with a group (10 people) at 7pm, and unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations. I arrived 30 minutes early to get a pager, and still wasn't seated until 7:45 (over an hour wait!). This was on a week night, and I feel like an hour wait is unacceptable when they initially told us that it would be 20 minutes."
Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",385,337,279,4.0,1/25/2017,"Diverse menu is crowd pleasing, family friendly--Ahi carpaccio is awesome! 3.5 stars    I find Cheesecake Factory to be an excellent choice for a group with varied taste with adequate service.  The thick menu has something for every taste and the bar/wine list seems widely and well stocked. I am a bit of a food snob when it comes to tartare, but the ahi tuna carpaccio is fantastic! Each time I've sampled it here, the chef's knifework is perfect, slicing the buttery salty-sweet morsels into paperthin slices so that they melt in your mouth.  By far my favorite! I mix the thin wasabi sauce with a bit of cucumber (putting together a bit of each thing on the plate) with the delicate slivers of Sushi-grade Ahi and it all converges for a flavor explosion in my mouth! Amazing.  That dish alone is worth 4 stars.   The only reason I hold back on rating the establishment with 4 stars overall is  The small tables (2 tops) and the high ceilings which cause every clanking dish, kitchen noise, or raccous laughter from the bar to reverberate endlessly.  When portions are generous and plates are large, it can be crowded AND noisy-- not great for chatter with your date or mates.  Despite the visual aesthetics-- interesting fresco decor with mixed Egyptian motif and Greco-Roman style columns, the auditory atmosphere is that of a high school cafeteria making it a touch choice for date night and introverted friends may feel lost in the clamour.  Best for happy hour or with big families who feel comfortable yelling atop the roar to communicate.      The Thai chicken wraps are an amazing appetizer and great to share--just try to get a bigger table as the dish and its accoutrements are too large to Fit comfortably on the small two-tops."
Gary S.,"Centreville, VA",0,9,3,2.0,12/6/2017,"We have had dinner here many times and is normally very good. Tonight I had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes and the meal was not as expected. The meatloaf was not a good choice and will not do again, dry, plain, and overall not worth it in my opinion.  We will be back cause CCF is a favorite of ours!"
Yujin H.,"Fairfax, VA",202,74,186,4.0,2/11/2017,"I've been to this location many times throughout the years because it is the closest Cheesecake Factory store from me. Majority of my experiences were good and I enjoy the diversity of the menu. However, it does get pretty crowded and they do not take reservations so keep that in mind when you're wanting to come on a weekend night.  I just want to point out one thing: they have a great happy hour special from 4-6PM. Drinks and small plates are all $5.95 so you should definitely take advantage of it."
Jessica D.,"Springfield, VA",0,9,,1.0,1/6/2018,"RUDE AND INCONSIDERATE!!! I called this evening for potato soup and chicken samosas. After waiting 20 minutes my husband picked up our order. My husband returned with cream of chicken soup and chicken samosas. My husband called the restaurant to let them know, they gave us the wrong order. The young lady argued with my husband telling him, 1. It's clam chowder soup 2. I asked her what was the soup of the day (WHICH I DID NOT ASK, I already know) 3. They don't serve potato soup on Saturdays. (Which isn't true!!!) After going back and forth, the Manager gets on the phone and says, ""well we ran out of potato soup."" Unfortunately, this is the first time of us hearing they ran out of the soup when it's 9 degrees outside. We will NOT return to this Cheesecake Factory location EVER! I'm officially fed up. Especially, other times we have ordered over the phone and we have waited damn near 30 to 45 minutes; just for salads AND potato soup."
Ryan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,136,140,1.0,6/12/2017,I came in to order a cake for a dinner party. Woman at the counter said cake is frozen should be a few minutes  Cake price total was $37.45  It was strawberry cheese cake. Monday night 6:40 pm  It was so disappointing. We waited 24 minutes for them to get the cake out of the freezer and handed it to us  I have been coming to Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years and it was always excellent service for dinner  But if I have to spend almost half hour in a weeknight to get a quick cake it is unacceptable  Should have gone to a proper bakery
Daniel S.,"Sterling, VA",20,6,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Service is beyond horrible... after being seated at a table waited for 10min and no server or anyone came over to greet me or say ""be with you"" but observed two tables seated after me in same section greeted within 2min of them being seated.. girls at hostess stand didn't seem to to care that a customer wasn't happy... didn't even offer to get me a manager to talk to or get a server... horrible"
Sarah K.,"Charlottesville, VA",500,115,104,3.0,5/16/2017,"I'd say this is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory! Glamorous location, loud, crowded, and huge portions. If you want a great dessert or large portions or a nice place to bring a large party, this is it.  The food is overall pretty good and comes out in big, big plates. I have one friend who obsesses over their food and bread, but everything's just OK to me - no total standout flavors or anything. One time I came and ordered the margherita flatbread and it came out with a completely charred, inedible crust, so I sent that back and got another one ten minutes later. My friend also couldn't take out an ingredient from her avocado egg rolls because the waiter shared that a lot of items come pre-made.  All in all, I'd recommend as a nice dinner spot with a group! It gets loud for dinner, so it's not that intimate, but they handle bigger groups pretty well (in my experience).  Lastly, the cheesecake never ever disappoints. It's fun to come here just for dessert sometimes!"
Mariya K.,"Washington, DC",20,76,24,4.0,12/18/2017,"I don't know how many times I have been here for lunch or dinner. The location is pretty great when you work around that area. The wait can be exhausting but we managed every time :) You can sit at the bar if there is space, as well. Bread is good for before dinner. The drinks are ok, the meals are tasty. It's not that I would drive a long way to come here but I would enjoy coming back if at the mall or in the area for lunch. Some of the tables are positioned too close to other people, so it may be an awkward experience, feels like you are all one party. The cheese cake is one of the good ones. Love the lime. Portions are pretty good. I have had fish and pasta, pizza, lots of salads and soups. Try it when you are there."
Kaylin S.,"Hattiesburg, MS",59,2,3,1.0,12/17/2017,"Literally exactly how I received my burger. Burnt Bun that is rock hard. Not to mention my meal was completely wrong. This was a delivery, no fries came with my order. I asked for no lettuce, and in turn received no crispy onions. Absolutely pitiful. I went a week ago with my boyfriend and was pleased. However, after this past experience I will not return. Very disappointed."
Terry p.,"Reston, VA",0,52,,5.0,12/5/2017,"Had the gumbo last night.  I am a diabetic so i was pleasantly surprised that the rice (white or brown) is served seperately, so I could order green beans, carrots or broccoli instead of the rice.  I ordered broccoli.  The meal was delicious.  The service was great and my bedtime blood glocose reading was 96! I will make this a weekly stop."
Mike N.,"Aldie, VA",0,36,18,5.0,9/3/2017,"Cheese cake factory....is there room for improvement. As we all know it's a machine, but when they make it extra right you have to speak on it. My trip consisted of me is 2 and he food was amazing as usual, although I did discover Korean cauliflower!!!  Addicted...sad but true. Aside from that all was great but I ordered margaritas and they were fantastic. I am very picky and don't like anyone's. It mine but I was feeling saucy. Pleasant surprise. I was told by my waitress, who rocked, that the bartender was new. So I hope he doesn't change his style, big thumbs up.  There was no wait time, did I mention that?  Finally, visit Jessica C, she is very chill, and gets it right. Thank you cheese cake factory for rocking my rolling. Michael A"
Nomin D.,"Springfield, VA",131,740,806,4.0,11/12/2016,"Staff is very friendly and environment is clean.  However tho, the food takes a long time to come out. I came here for my hour lunch, and I didn't get out on time! :/ the food came out delicious but it was not efficient."
Maria A.,"Arlington, VA",12,52,82,5.0,4/3/2017,"Exceptional customer service!  From the hostess, to the gentleman who seated us, finishing with Caesar who was our server!! Thank you"
A J.,"Centreville, VA",0,52,,1.0,7/6/2017,"I went here for my birthday to grab a nice meal and because I had a craving for spicy pasta. Big mistake. When my friend and I ordered our meals, we informed the waitress it was my birthday. She didn't acknowledge my birthday and replied with ""oh"". I asked her if on your birthday you got a free piece of cheesecake and she promptly said ""no"" but indicated she could talk to the supervisor (she never followed up on this). When the food arrived, I got the pasta and my friend got the burger and fries. My friend noticed that he had been eating meat wrapping paper that they had left on the burger while cooking it. Also not to mention, his fries were stale. When we informed the waitress she then told her supervisor. When the supervisor arrived he explained that they make the burgers daily and the paper was just the packing paper in between the burger. He acted as if it was no big deal that my friend had just eaten paper with his meal. The supervisor offered two free pieces of cake to us, but by this time we had lost our appetites and just wanted to leave. When the waitress came back we said we didn't want any cheesecake and just wanted the check. When the check came, we did notice that they took off the burger from the check. However, not once did the waitress or manager say Happy Birthday when my friend had indicated to them that we were there to celebrate it. Not to mention, when the waitress handed us the check she said that the manager ""recognized"" us from yesterday because we had a problem from the day before. Not knowing what she was talking about, we awkwardly told her it wasn't us, as that was our first time there. It felt like they were trying to accuse us of being troublesome costumers, which we did not appreciate. So after finishing our meal we both felt crappy and after this experience we will never come back on another birthday or ever."
Bob G.,"Herndon, VA",3,6,,2.0,11/27/2017,"I normally enjoy The Cheesecake Factory but this particular location has serious flaws. Something must be wrong in the kitchen because food service is very slow (the wait staff is clearly not to blame; they are constantly moving and trying to accommodate the diners while they're waiting for their food), the food is not as good as other locations and they tend to get orders wrong too often.   Why rush to seat people if you can't handle that number of diners? We've been too disappointed to return which is a shame - this is our neighbourhood."
Kailash C.,"Falls Church, VA",0,3,,5.0,12/26/2017,"Visited 24th December Lunch time. Food was great as usual, service was awesome, Waiters did not let us feel that it was a shift change for them. Enjoyed all food with family!"
Layla D.,"Lefroy, Innisfil, Canada",23,7,6,5.0,11/18/2017,When I went to Virginia this has officially become my favourite place to eat since we don't have a Cheesecake Factory in Canada I guess I can say that this place was amazing!!! So many options and the portioning is huge.
Samantha S.,"Fairfax, VA",1,63,2,1.0,6/23/2017,"Worst service ever! Chicken wings came out cold, waiter forgot our drinks, and the table was dirty.  Obviously this place is not very well run and it starts with the waitstaff.  AVOID at all cost."
Krystal L.,"VA, VA",1,43,4,1.0,10/3/2017,"I usually love the cheesecake factory. What's not to love about great food and cheesecake. This experience was terrible. The server was in a rush and barely listened to my order.  He brought my coffee and there was a big Green blob of food matter stuck inside the cup. Not like I could tell him that because he never came back. I got a factory burger that was severely under cooked. I would have liked some ketchup, but like I said the server never returned to my table.  I would have ordered dessert and another cup of coffee but it took so long to see the server again I just opted for my check. The food was bad and service even worse. Won't be returning here."
Padmashree S.,"Fairfax, VA",1,6,,4.0,10/28/2017,"A typical cheese cake factory, never goes wrong when it comes to food or drinks. A no brainer when you don't want to think too much where to go to dine in."
Karen L.,"Fairfax, VA",2,27,42,5.0,7/18/2017,"I feel like you can never go wrong with cheesecake factory. No matter which one you go to. Im always impressed by the portions, prices, and HH specials. AND GOD I LOVE THE BREAD. I really recommend the avocado eggrolls and calamari here for appetizers. My usual go-tos for entrees are the chipotle chicken pasta, steak diane, chicken bellagio, and the lousianna chicken pasta. Definitely worth going if you're in the neighborhood. Great place for special occasions like bdays, graduations, dates, etc."
Kimberly S.,"Chantilly, VA",0,13,1,3.0,8/4/2017,"The food is delicious and comes in big portions.  The only thing I would like to say is that the waiters sometime mistake me for a kid. The last time I went, I went with two of my friends and when we were finished eating I asked for separate checks. The waiter asked if I meant two checks and I corrected him saying three. He responded with ""wow three? You must be rich little girl!""- keep in mind that I was the oldest of the group.  I think he found out later on that I was indeed not a little kid yet he never apologized for his comment.  Although, this does not overshadow the other times that I've come here. Usually, the waiter is courteous and does not make any absurd comments.  Overall, the food here is nice and there is a massive selection at decent prices and big portions."
Beryl N.,"Springfield, VA",87,311,641,3.0,11/23/2016,"3.5 stars Aside from their delicious cheesecake, we like coming because they have a good kid's menu for $6-$7 bucks. Their kid's entree comes with a beverage too. The kid's fried chicken strips and chicken quesadilla are usual crowd pleasers. Our server was friendly and very accommodating with our requests (ie. swap out white rice for mashed potatoes, etc.). Majority of the time service tends to be on the slow side but even more so last night when we had a party of eight. The jambalaya pasta was not cook all the way through so that was a bit disappointing. The rest of the food came out fine (miso salmon, gumbo, and burger)."
Bill L.,"Fairfax, VA",0,1,,1.0,3/26/2017,"My family has been a routine customer at the Cheesecake Factory since 1995. My daughter and I placed a to-go order this afternoon; the cashier was new to the industry, with no one overseeing her activity at the register. We emphasized each item on our order and, much to our dismay, the Cheesecake was not included in our to-go bag when we opened the bag up at our kitchen table. The error of the new waitress is not the issue writ large - it is the fact that there was a lack of training and oversight from the management at this franchise. I called the restaurant and explained the issue. Unsurprisingly, the manager was unhelpful and the lack of customer service did not rectify the situation. I highly suggest the Cheesecake Factory implement adequate training and hospitality to make their customers feel appreciated; this may be my last dinner experience there.  In summary not even a complimentary dessert to was offered on a next visit.  For your awareness, this was the Fair Oaks location."
Felipe C.,"Centreville, VA",1,19,,2.0,10/8/2017,"Went here with two of my friends to get cheesecake for dessert. The wait for a table wasn't bad for a Friday night and the cheesecake we got were really good. However, our server (Jessica C) was really inattentive. She wasn't even the one who got our orders and only came by to ask how we're doing while we were already eating and to give us our check. What made me really disappointed with the service was when i got the wrong amount of change (I paid cash). Now I'm not the one to complain about a couple of quarters but handling people's money is a big deal. Hopefully service improves in the future because Cheesecake Factory is good go-to for my family and friends."
Laurie L.,"Richmond, VA",103,101,317,3.0,10/14/2016,"I have been here many times. The service can be hit or miss every time you go in especially during dinner rush. This most recent time, the waiter didn't even take our menus, took forever to get our drinks and we got our appetizer before we got our free bread. I always get the chicken piccata, which is always delicious! My BF got the 4 cheese penne pasta with chicken. I had a bite and it was pretty good! We also got the calamari for our appetizer, which was on point. I usually come here for the cheesecake. My favorite is the red velvet! The Oreo and tiramisu is also really yummy. I think the Cheesecake Factory is a little overpriced for their generic food but I don't mind going once in a blue moon."
Chelsea K.,"Winchester, VA",0,37,5,5.0,4/4/2017,"Absolutely wonderful service! My boyfriend and I stopped here yesterday evening for some food & beers after a day of shopping. Our server greeted us immediately and brought our drinks. After stuffing my face with bread & crab dip (which I would highly recommend) I realized I wasn't as hungry as I originally thought, but ordered a meal anyway.... Now, I'm one of ""those people"" who is better off just ordering chicken. ""How would you like your burger cooked?"" can only be answered by politely asking the chef to light it on fire and forget about it for an hour before bringing it to me. When our food came out 10 minutes later I knew it was a little too soon for my beef patty to have reached the level of burnt I was hoping for. It was still pink in the middle, and our server must've seen me making a face at it because he immediately took it back to the kitchen.  I was getting more full of bread and beer by the minute, so I really wasn't all that upset when he returned with a slightly-more-charred-yet-still-pink-in-the-middle burger. After all, that's how my dog likes it cooked! I wasn't going to say anything but our server could tell I still wasn't going to eat it, apologized, and brought me a piece of cheesecake (And trust me, the cheesecake did not go to waste). Basically, if you like your burgers burnt to a crisp, order something else. But the service here is top notch and we will definitely be back!"
Victoria N.,"Chantilly, VA",305,295,432,4.0,9/6/2016,"It's funny because my family never eats in here, we always (and I mean once every 2 weeks or so) order to-go from CF and eat it at home.  We always get the chicken and shrimp jumbalaya (with extra sauce), recently got hooked on the shrimp and sausage pasta (my fave!) a chicken alfredo (to me it's plain and boring and too oily but the kids love it), thai chicken lettuce wraps (BOMB!), chicken samosas (also a personal fave), and the complimentary bread.  We usually devour everything save for 1 tray of pasta kept over the next day.  Even on weekends when we normally order out and they're super busy our food usually arrives out on time. Always look forward to CF nights when we're usually celebrating a bday or something. Hopefully will venture out and try even more things in the future!"
Vickie B.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,21,1,2.0,9/29/2017,"My food was the only good thing about my experience. They were not busy yet it took our server 15 minutes just to ask us what we wanted to drink. Then another 10 to bring us a tea and a water and still another 15 to get our mixed drinks. Once we placed our order we received our appetizer. (Crab dip) and it was cold.  Got our main courses. Mine was delicious! My friends had pieces of shell all in it. Needless to say he didn't finish his. Asked for a refill on my tea, never got. Ordered cheesecake to go, took 25 minutes for that. Keep in mind I watched the server taking care of people that had came in after us. Very disappointed!"
Vanessa D.,"Burke, VA",35,80,146,5.0,3/16/2017,"I have been to this location several times over the years. We have always been pleased with the service and food. On our last visit, we tried menu items we had never had before.  For our appetizer, we normally get avocado edge rolls, crab and artichoke dip or fried mac and cheese. This visit we tried the crispy crab wontons. They were pretty good. It was a big portion, so we opted to eat half of them and take the other half home. I normally order the Thai lettuce wraps as my entree. It is on the appetizer list, but the portion is so large, it is the perfect amount for an entree. I LOVE them! It is hard for me to order anything else. I decided to be brave and try the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It was good. It wasn't as earth shattering as the Thai lettuce wraps, but it had a really nice flavor. My daughter ordered the avocado egg rolls as her entree. She loves them so much, she couldn't pass them up. Of course, we ordered cheesecake for dessert! There is no way I am trekking all the way out to Cheesecake Factory and not having a bite of cheesecake. If I am too full, I always take a slice home with me. I ordered the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. It was so good! My daughter ordered the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake. She loved it! My favorite is the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. I pick up a slice whenever I can. I have loved every cheesecake I have tried. As I type this, I wish I had a piece right now."
