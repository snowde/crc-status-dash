Kate B.,"Fairfax, VA",123,55,41,5.0,6/19/2014,"Crazy how much on the menu, but it is still so good!  Lots of comfort foods, but a few options that are off the beaten track for those who would like to try something different that is still not crazy different from the regular Americana.   Service was prompt and friendly, I did come rather late though.  If you're a big group or coming early, make a reservation. Small platters are cost savers that are enough to feed two ppl, add a salad to share if you're really hungry.  Otherwise, you will be taking stuff home for tomorrow. Food is all good, bit dessert is where this place shines, it is in the name ;). So save room and eat some cake!"
Alyssa K.,"Vienna, VA",328,329,3380,3.0,7/21/2012,"You can count on consistency and quality here, and good service. Not a fan of the apps as they all have a very sweet side to them. They took away my beloved shishito peppers which really annoyed me."
Ray W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2016,"I'm not one to complain or even write a negative review, but I was highly disappointed with my service at the Cheesecake Factory tonight. I work in a restaurant, so I understand the struggle of juggling multiple tables and maintaining great service. However, the restaurant was slow  and my server only had one other table, so my service tonight was unacceptable. For the first time in months my boyfriend and I had a night off together from work and school. We decided on the Cheesecake Factory as our date destination. Two minutes after we sat down, our server greeted us and we ordered our drinks. Probably five minutes later she returned with our drinks and we ordered our appetizer and entree at the same time. The appetizer took well over fifteen minutes to come out. Our neighbors had ordered four different appetizers; their appetizers came out within seven minutes. And while the crab and artichoke dip was really good, I didn't quite understand why it took so long. The server didn't apologize for the delay or even bother to tell us it would be a few more minutes. Both my boyfriend and I had finished our drinks and not once did our server stop by to refill them. Our entrees took over twenty minutes to arrive at our table. Finally after our entrees made it to our table, our server noticed our drinks were low. So that was about twenty minutes or so without a drink? Again, our server was missing for another twenty minutes and we awkwardly sat waiting for her to return so we could order dessert. For dessert we ordered strawberry shortcake and Oreo cheesecake. Again, took entirely too long to arrive at our table. After placing our dessert in front of us, the server brought us our check. My boyfriend signed the check and she scurried off with it. The strawberry shortcake looked delicious and was a huge portion.. Just what I needed! However, the shortcake was dry and hard and halfway through my ice cream, I found a chunk of glass in my dessert. Our server didn't stop by to check to see if we needed a box or how we were enjoying it, but instead began on her side work. I probably saw the server a total of four times and when I did, she seemed rushed and annoyed.  The food was good per usual, but ultimately, I am really disappointed with the lack of hospitality of the server."
fito g.,"Oakton, VA",320,9,10,5.0,8/10/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory Brunch was amazing! The Chilaquiles was more than filling, nothing new at cheesecake, and creat presentation and delicious.  The bruleed French Toast was heavenly with the butter maple syrup.  It tasting so good you know it's do bad calorie wise but that's what cheating is for ;). Go here for brunch you won't regret it."
Nick E.,"Fairfax, VA",2,7,5,2.0,7/7/2014,"This place used to be one of my favorite until today. Came with my friends and our server ""Randy"" took forever to come back after we said to give us a minute; we even thought about just leaving. The next thing was the utensils! They were dirty!!! And of course Randy took a year to come and change it for me. So mad at his attitude I sign up in yelp to write him a review. Will think twice next time before coming here."
Al P.,"Sterling, VA",0,9,,5.0,5/18/2016,AMAZING SERVICE. Salmon and burgers are amazing. Can get busy at times and have to wait a while to get seated.
Tom T.,"Fairfax, VA",1,13,2,4.0,9/19/2015,"Consistent.  I always know what to expect when I go here.  We always get seated without a long wait, even when crowded.  Love eating here due to their large variety of food.. Something available for everyone.  The only thing that irritates me is the lack of sweet tea."
Marie G.,"San Mateo, CA",58,17,3,5.0,6/27/2015,I walked right in and found a bar seat. In California on a Saturday you wait for hours on in for even a bar sear let alone a regular seat. It was busy but not so crowded that it was uncomfortable. The bartenders were personable and awesome! Miranda is the best bartender there!
Christopher W.,"Falls Church, VA",0,13,,5.0,7/27/2015,Good food a great staff. The menu is packed with good food. I am one day going to try them all. At this time I still like the Cajun chicken. My girlfriend loved the chicken Parmesan. We have even gone to dinner in the middle of a snow storm. This place is great
Una D.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",122,657,,4.0,3/18/2014,"get the red velvet cheesecake! soo good, and really dense i could not finish it i also got a strawberry daiquiri, which was frozen lemonade and no alcohol. ah well we had to wait around to find a place to sit, as typical with all CF locales..."
Sutton P.,"Fairfax, VA",4,49,4,4.0,5/9/2015,"Delicious food and exceptional service. There used to be a waiter here a few years back- middle aged man. He was very memorable. Best waiter I have ever experienced. He somehow came to my table exactly when I needed him and most of the time I didn't even have to say anything. He just knew! Magic! He's not there anymore but the service is still great. The food in particular tastes better than the one at Tysons galleria to me. Great location. Although sometimes I wish I didn't have to wait as long in line, and some waiters/waitresses can be not as friendly. Not mean, but not very enthusiastic either"
Lilly R.,"Nokesville, VA",7,76,,1.0,11/15/2014,Went there to get dessert and they stated their computers were down and told us to go to TGIF.
Briana A.,"Vienna, VA",26,11,96,4.0,11/22/2014,"Great service, considerate and helpful in handling my allergies. Love the patio, comfortable chairs! :)"
Pamela G.,"Reston, VA",0,6,,3.0,4/29/2016,"The food was alright, however, the service was extremely slow. Just the bread and water took over 10 minutes to be delivered. We started with the popcorn shrimp, which was crispy and flavorful. My Louisiana Chicken Pasta on the other hand was a bit bland. The margaritas were delicious (although a bit small for the price). This was our first time at this Cheesecake Factory location, and I am not sure we will be back."
Nat H.,"Springfield, VA",0,8,2,5.0,3/11/2016,"Love the Cheesecake Factory!!!! Great food, atmosphere, and of course cheesecakes! Portions are huge and everything I've had has always been delicious! My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet. I love the avocado egg rolls and all of their salads are great as well (my favorite is the Sheila's chicken salad). Also I recommend the cashew chicken (sometimes it's a little too salty but still tastes great)."
Kelli T.,"Herndon, VA",0,19,2,1.0,12/28/2014,Cockroach. That's all. Oh and no returned call from management. I'd include a picture but there isn't an option.
Kevin P.,"Fairfax, VA",33,11,3,3.0,7/3/2015,"This place has a huge menu, and our server, amazingly, was super knowledgeable about the menu. Huge portions, not the healthiest, but a good place to come with family. It was crowded, but the food came out in a reasonable time. Pretty good for a chain."
Greg C.,"Oakton, VA",206,20,7,2.0,6/26/2013,"You come to The Cheesecake Factory for one thing. The cheesecake. It isn't the world's best but it is consistently good.    You don't, or at least shouldn't, go to The Cheesecake Factory to check out the rest of the 45-page menu. It's like reading a choose-your-own-adventure book with no climax or happy ending since it always seems to conclude with indigestion."
Sal M.,"Chantilly, VA",41,62,4,4.0,3/3/2015,"I have to say, i really like the place. All the food i have ordered was great, and the service also great with the exception of 1 time. But i really wouldn't let one bad waitress ruin the restaurant, I will come back many more times. Oh and the cheesecakes that wip cream? Actually they used  molecular gastroenterology to turn cocaine into a cheesecake. Just kidding....but seriously, that stuff is addicting."
Evelyn D.,"Philadelphia, PA",70,168,113,4.0,12/22/2013,"Happy hour. Friendly staff, very quick service.  Had the eggrolls with black beans, chicken and cheese.  Also the salmon eggrolls!  Delicious!"
