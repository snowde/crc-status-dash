May B.,"Fairfax, VA",8,44,52,5.0,6/24/2016,"Cheesecake Factory have a wide range menu that you can try. If you try coming here for a year, i can gauruntee you that you will not be able to try everything one the menu, even if you have to. Their food are just simply delicious! In addition, everyday they would have different type of soup on the house, which comes in bowl or so cup. I find that their cup size soup I already big enough to get you full. They also have their lunch special with different choices of selections. One of my favorite would be the Chipotle Pasta.  The taste is very good, better than Olive Garden actually.  The amount for a lunch size meal is rather big. Everytime I go there, I always ended bringing leftover home! As goes for the service, it was excellent.  The server treats you nice, and is always checking up on you making sure that, you have everything you need, and most importantly making sure your experience is spectacular !"
Michael G.,"Ashburn, VA",71,9,3,5.0,2/11/2017,"I L O V E this place! The menu is huge and has so many options! Once again its vegetarian friendly, which is my #1 requirement lol Food is amazing and the Cheese Cake is the .com Oh and dont sleep on their Arnold Palmers! RIP"
Andrew P.,"Henrico, VA",260,30,23,1.0,12/26/2016,"We came with a party of 2 at 3pm, during the off hours of lunch. The server was slow to serve us and was not very attentive to us. Our food took close to an hour to come out, and when my Pasta Da Vinci finally did come out, it was grossly overcooked, tasting like mushy goop. I asked them if they could redo it and 20 minutes later, I finally received my dish. As I asked for the check, they had double charged me for my pasta. I asked them if I was really going to be paying for my order twice, despite them being the ones who made it inedible. They said it was a mistake, although I would have been the one paying for their mistake. I did not receive any apology from management or the chef, nor did I receive any sort of compensation for my 1 hour 20 minute wait for my food. I don't think I can come back after this sort of experience and service."
Syra J.,"Baltimore, MD",123,25,35,1.0,12/26/2016,"I've been to many other busier cheesecake factories with better and timely service. Our waiter took forever to get our orders and once our orders were placed, it took over 45 min to actually receive the food. Not once did the server check up on us in the meantime. We even came at an off time too. The pasta we ordered ended up being overcooked as well. We were very displeased with this location."
Alex B.,"Vienna, VA",284,160,26,4.0,10/2/2016,great food great service... only complaint was the waitress did not really seem to know what she was doing but besides that food was great and came out at a good time and was delicious
Ken W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,7,2,5.0,1/30/2017,"Probably one of the best restaurants food wise, that I have tried in a while. The portion size and the taste was great. Service was good but kind of slow. My two biggest complaints would be the lighting of the restaurant and the atmosphere. It was very busy, crowded and you could have a hard time talking to people next to you on the table. But, crowd size is understandable. It was very dark in there as well. Regardless, the food was amazing and all then other details can be tolerated."
Andrew H.,"Centreville, VA",3,11,,3.0,3/5/2016,"First of all the positive aspect of Cheesecake factory: the food is always very well prepared and there are only a few dishes that do not live up to my quality expectations. The kitchen seems to do a good job. Now the less positive aspect... For years the service at Cheesecake factory has been slipping. It's like they stopped caring as soon as they filled up their restaurant. Cheesecake factory has always seemed dirty to me, although due to the low lighting I was never sure why until recently.  My wife and I were eating here for lunch and noticed our table had not been wiped down. It was not big deal we waved down a staff member who was cleaning off tables and asked if he could wipe ours down. He was happy to oblige... with a completely dry towel. I don't know if Cheesecake factory missed the memo but you need to use some sort of liquid perhaps with some soap to actually clean surfaces. As off-putting as that was, it was the highlight of that visit. It's not often questions from your childhood are answered in front of your eyes.  We proceeded to order the enchiladas with flour tortillas instead of corn (yes, they will make this substitution if you ask). After 20-30 minutes we were brought lukewarm tortillas that had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10-15 minutes. If you tell me not to touch the plate because it will burn me, I want to be burned. After we told them our food was cold and we wanted them to remake it, they took it back, put it under the heat lamp for 15 minutes, and re-served it to us. If it was lukewarm after sitting under the heat lamp the first time, it's not going to magically get better being under the heat lamp again. We went to eat at elevation burger. The only reason I'm not giving Cheesecake factory a lower score is because I have had several good experiences at this restaurant. One thing I've noticed is most of the bad experiences occur during lunch time as opposed to dinner time. I don't know if it's just back luck but they seem to be more on point with dinner."
Lisa L.,"Arlington, VA",89,78,70,2.0,2/22/2016,"Boy oh Boy--well this was a bust. Decided to put a gift card I received from work into some use on Saturday night.  It was packed--as expected.  The wait for 2 people was 45 minutes.  I was fine with that.  The fiance and I camped out by the cheesecake area and watched them pack up all the dessert and such for a while.  The fiance notice that it has been pasted 45 minutes and told me to check on the status on our table.   When I approached the hostess table, 2 of the hostesses did not address me at all.  It was, I'm assuming, the front end manager, whom addressed me after standing there for a while.  I asked about the status of our table and the female hostess that ignored me said "" yeah we rang for your table."" Well the device didn't light up or vibrate (they gave me a faulty device).  There was no ""sorry for the inconvenience"", just a ""we'll ring you for the next available table""--....okay. Even the manager giggle a little and said ""yeah--they've been there the whole time."" T_T They did keep their word-- 2 minutes later, our device rang and they brought us to our table (btw-- your female hostess needs to learn some manner and if she hates her job, she should find another one at forever 21 or something).  Was seated and was greeted by Natalie.  She was a speedy server-- definitely got the job done by giving us what we wanted, quickly. She was polite but also didn't look like she liked her job.   Food:  Appetizer: The crab bites weren't worth it-- tasted like mushy.  Entrees:  Filet mignon with mash potatoes and green beans- The filet was tender, the beans were cooked just right (cooked thoroughly but still had its crunch) and was seasoned just right.  Tuna Tataki Salad: The salad had such great flavor with the wasabi vinaigrette.  The fish did taste a little fishy which made me a little hesitant however, if you put a little bit of everything (tuna, greens, avocado and some tomato) in one bite, you would enjoy the dish.  Service--sucked, food-- good but not worth overlooking the service."
Chris M.,"Bethesda, MD",0,32,4,5.0,6/26/2017,Great service and never feel rushed. Great gluten free options. There's a food choice for everyone...and the cheesecake is awesome
Astryd D.,"Washington, DC",21,135,32,5.0,11/5/2016,My favorite chain restaurant. The service at this location has been amazing every time I've been. happy I have a cheesecake factory near me.
Alberto D.,"Manassas, VA",21,5,2,1.0,1/2/2017,"This is by far one of the worse experiences in a restaurant, I told the server that we are in a hurry since we have to travel to Texas and it's a long drive to get there, so we decide to order something simple 2 hamburgers, I saw him lingering and moving around before he even input our order in the system, our order took nearly 30 minutes, he ask if we wanted bread, he didn't bring the bread after I ask him a second and it was 15 minutes later, I personally will never go back to this location and the feeling of premium service is by far unacceptable. The people that sat next to us arrive later and were served first, our hamburgers were over cook, but I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes, never ask about if the food were good or anything."
Jenn K.,"Reston, VA",92,465,59,5.0,3/22/2016,"Definitely owe an update here after having two of the best meal items ever at CF! Even the server said the Miso Salmon was his favorite item on the menu and considering how much is on the menu this is saying a lot.  Huge ole portion of salmon deliciously seasoned. Also the Asian seasoned lettuce wraps appetizer made a good pair for this meal. If it weren't for the bread and cheesecake this would actually be a guilt free healthy meal but of course there is and it cannot be passed up!  And like all CF meals, these both are more than ample portion and definitely enough to split. A Friday night at 9 pm at CF could pass for 6 pm. Totally packed but luckily the wait to get seated wasn't longer than 10-15 min."
Sean K.,"Manassas, VA",65,213,325,5.0,3/4/2015,"Well I can't find a reason to knock off any stars Food, epic, service, the best; atmosphere very nice - lots of marble  Location great Like everyone else says it's not cheap for me a soda, app, meal and cake with tip is ganna be 45.00 so this isn't for an everyday kind of meal, this is actually for special occasions or if you've never been here before (like me)  The name for the longest time really had an impression that this was a fast food kind of like a chili's or Applebee's kind of place but it way more upscale than that, the wait staff is in nice black pants and button down white shirts with white aprons and the price tags matches the atmosphere so don't let the ""factory"" name in the cheese cake factory throw you off this is actually a decent place for date night or other special occasions  If you've never come they do have an extensive menu for you to browse through whether it be seafood or chicken, pasta or pizza they have wonderful selections"
Victoria L.,"Herndon, VA",491,534,912,4.0,1/7/2014,"Love the Cheesecake Factory chains. I use to go to the one at White Flint mall all the time and then they opened one at Tysons and Fair Oaks. Always a great experience at all these locations. Service is great, servers are attentive and provide awesome hospitality. The decor is modern, bright and very unqiue. Love the paintings on the cieling, the high cielings make it look very spacious. The menu is huge, almost like a telephone book, so choosing something can be hard. Also be aware that portions are huge, you'll have plenty to take home and leave stuffed! Some of my favorite items on the menu is -Crusted chicken romano which is a pasta dish with lightly crusted chicken with light tomato sauce -All burgers are fantastic - juicy and flavorful -Pasta carbonara- bacon in pasta? You have my appetite.  -Nachos- huge portion -Fried mac and cheese balls- I don't think I need to explain myself -Monte Cristo- served at brunch, it's not deep fried which doesn't make you feel guilty -Chicken maderia- mushroom maderia sauce, chicken covered in cheese served with a light and whipped mash potatoes  ALL cheesecakes are good..well I haven't tried them all but come on it's cheesecake! My favorite has to the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the chris outrageous cheesecake which is a coconut cheesecake (slight obsession with coconut).  A good tip is come on weeknights. Weekends can have a wait anywhere from 45-3 hours. Yes, I've waited 3 hours once. Luckily, it's at a mall so you can walk around, but don't come dying of hunger or you might as well go to Champps."
Kim B.,"Gainesville, VA",34,192,110,4.0,1/11/2016,"Sometimes you just have to eat at the Cheesecake Factory- and it's a great excuse to go when you have gift cards to burn there from the holidays.  We haven't been to a CF in years, mostly because we don't tend to eat at chains if we have a choice.  But, I've never had a horrible meal there and who doesn't like their cheesecake!?!!  So we waited 5 mins or so for our table to be sat, which isn't bad, and we were seated in the only quiet area of the restaurant, near the back.   We were greeted quickly by a female server, with short hair, who's name escapes me.  She was quick with us and not extremely personable.  She got our drinks for is and bread almost immediately.  Then she took our orders, and threw me for a loop when she said they were out of turkey for a Renee's special turkey sandwich.  So we ordered everyone else's and our appetizers while I perused the menu again. I decided On a chopped salad and she left.  Then, all of a sudden, we were greeted by the complete opposite of our original server, Jay.  He was friendly, warm and personable.  He immediately put napkins under our drinks because the original server had not, and said that it was shift change and he was taking over.  Talk about a 180!  He was awesome!  Jay was probably one of the most attentive servers we'd ever had in our lives and truly an asset to that company.   We got our food, which was delicious and hugely portioned as Cheesecake Factories tend to always be... Both of my girls wanted chicken fettuccine Alfredo, my husband ordered Chicken Bellagio and I had the chopped salad.  All was great and since we had the gift cards, we were going to get dessert and bring it home!  We told Jay that we wanted to walk around the mall a bit, then take our dessert to go- he suggested we order it now, they'd package it and all we'd have to do is stop by the front to pick it up from the cooler.  We ordered a few pieces, paid for it with our check and kept it by name in the front. 30 mins went by, we were ready to pick it up and I got back and the line was 15 + people deep.  I waited a while and it just wasn't moving.  This saved no time.  None.  After at least 10 mins, I asked two managers at the front desk if they'd be willing to grab by cakes from the cooler since I'd already paid for it.  They didn't seem pleased with the situation at all, and even after I gave them my name, and the exact flavors of cheesecake in the bag, they were still hesitant to give me my things.  They said that my server didn't follow standards, so I feel badly if Jay got in trouble, I don't think he should be.  I just didn't want to wait an hour on line for my freaking dessert.   P.S- the salted caramel, lemon raspberry creme cheese cake and the red velvet were all delicious."
Gregg C.,"Chantilly, VA",241,150,402,5.0,4/11/2016,Good lunch experience.  Waitress was friendly and did not rush me. I spent some extra time after lunch working on my MacBook.  I had the Caesar salad with Ahi Tuna.  The lunch portion was plenty big.
Varun C.,"Lansing, IL",29,5,,4.0,12/3/2016,The food was very  and service is very good definitely going here again . Good place to have some diner or lunch with friends together .
Bex H.,"Washington, DC",0,59,23,2.0,10/30/2016,"I am still trying to figure out why I sat on hold to place a take out order for 5 minutes 47 seconds when I walked in the restaurant, while still on hold and there was 8 staff people standing around talking. And then, even though the take out person knew I was waiting for my food, her phone was obviously more important as I had to interrupt her to ask for my food that was sitting on the ledge, getting nice a cold. Definitely won't be back. It's not worth the 45 minute drive."
Mary S.,"Culpeper, VA",44,100,21,4.0,5/15/2016,Love this place. Great food. Service is sometimes slow but I'm always pleased with the food. Price is fair and my favorite is the pasta carbonara and calamari. Of course their free bread is delicious. I wish I can bake it at home! What is great about this establishment is the variety of dishes you can select from and of course the huge selection of cheesecake! Definitely have a mojito at the bar if you are waiting for a table. Service has always been good and always my go to place for nice dinner with my kids!
Jennifer J.,"Burke, VA",7,14,,2.0,6/21/2016,"Maybe they were having a bad night, but what an expensive disappointment we had Sunday. We were sat quickly which was nice, but unfortunately it was at a table that hadn't been cleaned very well (sticky, crusty tabletop) and the booth seats were covered in crumbs; a lot of crumbs! We ordered beers, Cobb salad, and cheesesteak pepper sandwich of some sort.  The beers were the best part. The Cobb had a few slivers of thin chicken, but most of it was shredded lettuce that had seen better days. The only thing remotely good about this awful salad was periodically getting a tiny nugget of bacon.  My boyfriends sandwich looked great but he said it was terribly underwhelming. The experience was such a downer we took our cheesecakes to go.  A terrible salad, 2 beers, an unpleasant sandwich, and 2 very nice cheesecakes, all for about $85.  We will not be back."
