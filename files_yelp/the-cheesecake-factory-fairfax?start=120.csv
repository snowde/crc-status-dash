Natalie K.,"Phoenix, AZ",295,65,358,3.0,6/2/2016,"I haven't been here since a year ago so it was nice to visit back to my old favorite spot. Although it was lunch time, the place wasn't too packed. I remember when Cheesecake Factory was very popular several years ago, but it seemed like the hype has calmed down a little bit. The bread basket was served prior to our entree, however we only ate the darker (brown) one as the other bread was too chewy and stale. Our server was a friendly older man. My cousin ordered a club sandwich, and I ordered the factory nachos as always. They were both delicious, but I'd say they're not too special compared to other restaurants that serve club sandwiches and nachos. Cheesecake Factory is known to serve great portions, hence the price, however I never taste anything extraordinary in comparison to other American restaurants. This Cheesecake Factory was in a convenient location inside the mall, so I would visit back for convenience reasons but there will probably be no case where I'll be ""craving"" Cheesecake Factory."
Tracy B.,"Middleburg, VA",18,3,2,5.0,3/19/2016,Great service and really good food!  The wait was long but the food was worth it.  I had the Chicken Bellagio and it was perfection!
Stefany E.,"Centreville, VA",0,4,2,1.0,3/18/2017,"Called twice to order a cheesecake and someone answered and once I said I wanted to order to go, hanged up the phone. How long does it take to order a cake."
Ryann N.,"Manassas, VA",195,6,1,5.0,9/17/2016,Best cheesecake you'll ever have food is good as well!!! I couldn't not order cheesecake after I had dinner it was mandorty
Russ B.,"Washington, DC",86,5,,5.0,4/20/2016,Was there last Sunday for brunch (didn't even know they served brunch) and something happened in the kitchen where my food took a long time to come out. I appreciate that the manager didn't wait for us to complain. Came over and apologized and offered us some comp's appetizers. And then offered free dessert at the end of our meal. And then comp'd the entire meal. We hadn't even complained once. That's great customer service to me.
Hina A.,"Manassas, VA",34,70,43,5.0,4/30/2016,It was a busy afternoon  but the waitresses Angela didnt rush us at all. She was very sweet and helpful. We wanted to split our dish since the portions were huge.. she actually spent extra time to split the dish evenly for us.  The food wqs superb as usual!!
Jeff C.,"Alexandria, VA",426,837,912,4.0,7/8/2014,"Ah, yes, The Cheesecake Factory chain always brings forth some goodness, and of course, the cheesecakes are major delish, but we opted for a fresh bowl of guacamole and chips as well as an amazing Cuban Sandwich. The guacamole was loaded with flavor and the side peppers and spices were a nice touch. In fact, the guacamole was so filling that it would almost been enough for two, but the call of the Cheesecake Factory's Cuban sandwich was just too much to resist. The Cuban was quite a surprise and ranks as some of the best that I have ever had. With just the right amount of pickle and mustard, our sandwich was the perfect taste of Cuban flavor. The service was impeccable, and I would rate this at five stars; however, this Cheesecake Factory is located in a mall which unfortunately speaks of a restaurant chain experience....still, it is a yummy experience that merits a taste of Cuban goodness."
Kim C.,"Washington, DC",4,3,,4.0,6/2/2016,"Love it here. Always hits the spot when you need some bomb salmon, smoking mashed potatoes and warm brown bread (yes, I know the bread has a proper name. But, it's like ice pops, when your mom asks you which flavor you want...and you just say ""red"". The bread's like that). I could eat a basket of that bread by myself (and have). Desserts are okay, which is odd considering cheesecake is their claim to fame. I've just always found their food better than their cheesecakes. Go figure.  Lines can be very long at this location, so bring a phone, tablet or book on a weekend or holiday. Or, bring a friend if you're into talking to actual people while you wait. All-in-all, I never leave disappointed."
J P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,45,5,3.0,9/3/2016,"Eh is it just me or does it seem like cheesecake factory has gone downhill in recent years ? We ordered a kids size pasta Alfredo, a medium size Caesar salad and a chicken parm sandwich for $60 really?! The food was disappointment not impressed and could make better at home."
Suz E.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,6,,2.0,2/4/2017,"I usually feel like the food quality is pretty good at Cheesecake Factories. However, I ate here for the first time last night and six hours later had horrible food poisoning symptoms... yuck.  Our server was very nice, so two stars."
Patrice H.,"Springfield, VA",0,32,10,1.0,7/11/2017,"I wish there was an option to give no stars. The worst customer service ever!!!!!  My husband stopped in to pick up some buffalo wings and two slices of cheesecake. The wings were fried soooooooo hard that it hurt to bite into them. They were burnt, point blank! A few of the wings still had feathers on them. Freaking feathers!!!! My husband took them back to the restaurant to voice his concerns, but the manager, Mr. Vargas argued with my husband over the quality and basically said that there was nothing wrong with them and that he eats them that way all the time. Good for you Mr. Vargas, but I don't eat burnt chicken wings and you shouldn't argue with your customers about why they should. Just replace them! I will never go to this restaurant again - you pay high prices and the quality of the food sucks! Too many choices around to settle for burnt wings and a manager that chooses to do nothing but argue with a paying customer!!!!!!!! Disgusted!"
Dara R.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",40,79,253,5.0,10/3/2015,Service was really pleasant. Everyone was very friendly and the food was great! My friend and I had the Fried Zucchini as an appetizer which was very hot inside but very fresh and crispy. Then for the main dish we ordered rhe Luau Salad and the Louisiana Pasta. The salad was delicious. Crispy layer of fried chip(?) went very well with the salad. It had a sesame seed dressing and the salad was rich with flavor. The pasta was also good but it was more in the home style comfort food kind of way. The fried chicken on top was kind of thin and little more brown then I would have liked it... But it was still very good. The portions for these meals were so large we had to take half of each home.  Then for for dessert my friend and I shared the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The coconut crust on the bottom and the light and fun flavors in the middle was a great! It made you stop thinking and enjoy the moment.
Laura Kay S.,"Centreville, VA",48,52,27,5.0,10/16/2015,"Absolutely wonderful service. My waitress Madeleine was prompt and had excellent recommendations! Not once did I have to fight to get her attention; she seemed very instinctive. I chose the lunch portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken, followed my the kahlua cheesecake. Drinks from the bar were wonderful as well. Will definitely be returning, seeing as how the happy hour menu has a lot to offer!"
Alisa H.,"District Heights, MD",12,1,,1.0,4/23/2015,"I will never, EVER patronize this restaurant again. The service was slow. I never received my appetizer or my drink. The bread never came out, either. I had to send my entree back because it had sat under the warming light so long that it was dry and unappetizing. The manager was rude, particularly when I complained about the service dog that was allowed to roam, unleashed, throughout the restaurant. He told me that he couldn't be expected to babysit patrons, despite how unsanitary and uncomfortable it was for a large dog to be licking patrons' hands as they sat at their tables. I couldn't believe how poor the quality of service was here. I am a regular Cheesecake Factory customer, and I have never been so disappointed as I was at the Fair Oak location.  Do better, Fair Oak. Please."
Josh F.,"Old Town Alexandria, Alexandria, VA",168,328,17,2.0,4/7/2015,"Warning: stupidly pretentious review follows. I'm not sure who as at fault for the meteoric rise of these places. Every mall in America features a Cheesecake factory, and they're all obnoxious; every dish is over-the-top-decadent, slathered in sauces and butters and sugary noodles, and belongs at a country fair. The salads at a CCF are more bacon and blue cheese than anything of redeeming value, and I dare you to find literally 5 items on a menu that features 100 things that your grandma would have served up at her house. (Which is my crappy way of saying that NOTHING in here is made of simple, natural ingredients) I'm not considered ""granola"" or ""crunchy"" but I have zero desire to expose my gut to the workings here or in places like it. We need to be better. Find some real food. Break out from the mall, care what goes in your gullet. /rant"
Anna L.,"South Riding, VA",253,634,122,3.0,3/14/2014,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Yes, it is a chain, but one of the better ones. The cheesecake is off-the-hook delicious. Rating this restaurant on cheesecake alone would result in a 5-star experience. The pieces are huge, delicious and if you can finish one off after a meal, I would have to say you are a glutton! I love a restaurant that offers variety on their menu, but this menu is overwhelming - page after page of choices for entrees, appetizers and small bites. If you have a picky eater in your group, this is definitely the place to come. Perhaps it's because they offer so much variety in their regular menu, but I haven't found one thing that particularly stands out as being delicious. Everything is ok, sometimes a bit over-salted, but definitely not overly memorable (with the exception of that cheesecake). I do enjoy coming here for happy hour. Drinks are generally well made by friendly bartenders and service is usually quite good when sitting in the bar area which is probably why it's so crowded early Friday afternoons."
Jenn C.,"Fairfax, VA",24,14,,3.0,5/27/2016,"I like it but it's really overrated in my mind. Menu is so big and has such an odd array of choices. Everything I ever tried has been really good, and of course the cheesecake is their star. Pricey but the portions are large. After all it is a chain restaurant. It's a 3.5 in my book."
Mark L.,"Fairfax, VA",0,6,1,1.0,11/30/2015,"Placed a to go order at 4:30, I was told the food would be ready in 20 minutes.  Showed up to pick up the food but low and behold there was no order under my name and no recollection of me calling.  I suppose whoever took my order decided to ask what I'd like, what my name was, what my phone number was, and then head somewhere comfy to take a nap without actually processing the order.  FUN TIMES!! UPDATE:  I called back to find out how something like this could happen.  I was told that the order placed under my name was not the actual food I ordered, this is what caused so much confusion.  The woman I spoke to on the phone said they could whip up the Louisiana Chicken Pasta in five minutes (we were told it would take at least 20 minutes to fix the mistake while we were actually AT the Cheesecake Factory).  Needless to say, I did not go back to pick up the food I was very excited to eat.  Bummer. QUICK FIX:  REPEAT THE ORDER TO THE CUSTOMER BEFORE HANGING UP THE PHONE."
Kevin K.,"Alexandria, VA",4,56,36,4.0,6/17/2016,This place was great food and environment. The price is also lower than expected. I only had one incident where my friends chicken wasnt cooked through.
Kimberly C.,"Manassas, VA",177,268,112,3.0,7/13/2014,"First - I love the food here.  I have no complaints.  My complaint is about the service.  Today my friends took me to lunch for my birthday.  They were running late, so I was seated and waited.  After 15 minutes, my waiter Jesse finally came over to ask if I wanted water.  He didn't ask if I was waiting on anyone or if I wanted to wait and was quick to wander off. Soon after, one of my friends showed up and waited another 20 minutes for him to come back.  Finally when he did, she ordered water and waited yet again for it to be brought.  She had to ask him for bread, which is usually the first thing along with the water.  Eventually, after about 30 minutes he asked if we wanted to wait or order.  The food came out quickly enough, but it took an exceedingly long time for him to come back and check on us and we had to flag him down once or twice, so much so that a third person showed up and was there long enough to eat off of our plates while we waited.  We ordered dessert, which came fairly quickly because it is pre-made, but from start to finish it took us a shade under 2 HOURS to eat despite knowing what we wanted when we sat down. We were not ""those"" customers too distracted by our phones to look at the menu to take up his time.  We were actively chatting and waiting, so that is not the reason our service was so incredibly slow.  I know this place is regularly busy, but almost 2 hours for some salads, one entree, an appetizer, and some dessert?  I probably will not come back unless I am morally obligated by occasion or unless I know I will need to have time to kill to get waited on."
