Ken B.,"Haymarket, VA",120,233,515,5.0,5/3/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is always on the money. Their service is top notch and the food is downright good. They have a monster menu that everyone can find something they like on. The burgers are my personal favorite, but I have tried a little bit of everything and I have yet to find something I don't like. Our server was very pleasant and this is the norm for my visits here. The place is clean and the atmosphere is lively. It gets busy on the weekend, but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes at the most. By the way, in case you didn't know, they're speciality is cheesecake!  They have a huge selection, I think I counted 35+ options, so there's a little bit of everything. My party had a great time celebrating a birthday and I'm confident we'll be back here sooner than later."
Angela W.,"Manassas, VA",91,79,108,4.0,7/21/2014,Been to this chain many times & for the most part never disappointed.   Large menu with great variety.  Not just another restaurant with the same old American and Italian food options.   People may come for the cheesecake but the food is really excellent.   Entree serving sizes are very large.   Down side is there is nearly always a wait & they do not take reservations or call ahead.
Jess C.,"Washington, DC",0,11,2,1.0,10/26/2015,Food was amazing as usual.  However the service was horrible. The server who brought our food out slammed the dishes on the table and left without saying anything. When we asked the same server for some napkins she threw the napkins on the table and walked away.  We've never gotten this kind of service before and  mentioned it to the manager as we were about to head out. She apologized and offered us a slice of cheesecake which was very nice.
MA M.,"Fairfax, VA",3,21,,2.0,11/13/2016,"So I came here twice this week...yesterday and today. I returned because the selection was awesome, and the food tasted good. However the service leaves much to be desired. Yesterday the server missed a good tip because he never came to our table to check on us. Today the young lady dropped a crab cake as she brought the plate to the table then acted like she didn't want to replace it. Granted the tables are wiped down, everyone doesn't eat off of tables in public. After repeating myself she took the crab cake to the back and it looked like they immediately came back out with the same crab cake on another plate. This theory was almost proven when I asked the other server how the crab cakes are prepared. No way they could've prepared another one that fast. That slip was their fault. The next slip was mine but the server wasn't accommodating. As I was boxing up my daughter's meal, I dropped her meatball. I asked if it was possible to get another meatball and was told they take a long time to make and that the table should be clean. I'm sure they had a child- sized meatball available. Instead of making a big deal out of it, we cut the sides that touched the table.  The final straw was when we paid the check. My husband (the only man at the table) used his card. The server returned and asked if he was the one who paid the check. We didn't make a big deal, we decided we wouldn't be back, nor would we recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Prawyn P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,28,103,4.0,1/3/2016,"Any item for your main course, but always start with Chicken Samosa.  Kids will be happy when brought in for their Bday's. The waitress and stewards sing for them and make the dinner a memorable one. Thank you cheese cake factory."
Christa F.,"Alexandria, VA",244,429,123,2.0,1/2/2014,"Why?  Why do I continue to even TRY with the Cheesecake Factory?  I almost never like any of the food there and yet, I still venture in to sample their offerings once every couple of years.  So, I liked the bread, and the butter.... and watching the hilarious little ones at the table across from us.... the water with lemon was also fine. Crab bites - where was the crab? Pot stickers - the sole reason I drank four glasses of that water with lemon Fried Zuchini - not what I expected and the batter tasted off Tuna Tartar - I only ordered this because I remember that it was the only thing I liked the last time I ventured here....yucky this time.... barely any tuna and low quality tuna at that.... way too much avocado and not enough of the sauce.  Horrible. Let's face it, for bang for buck, order a slice of the still very excellent cheesecake along with a cup of coffee and call it lunch."
LiSa K.,"Woodbridge, VA",12,38,17,5.0,3/27/2016,I ordered for pick up and this new girl messed up the order and I had to wait for an extra 20 minutes but I asked to speak to a manager and Brandi was awesome. She offered me a free piece of cheesecake for my Inconvenience! Very satisfied now
Ben N.,"Fairfax, VA",1,2,,3.0,6/6/2016,Food is really good here but the cheesecake is absolutely amazing. And the cheesecake portions are at least twice the size most places give.
Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",439,3672,27594,3.0,2/17/2014,"I know that Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but when we do come here for lunch or dinner, our meal is usually pleasant.  From the Pasta category, I usually get the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic (it contains bow-tie pasta, chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, caramelized onions, all in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce - the pasta is usually cooked al dente, and the sauce is very thick and creamy, and very savory with the pancetta cubes, peas, and the caramelized onions); Shrimp with Angel Hair (large shrimp sauteed with herbs, lemon, and garlic, combined with angel hair pasta, tomato, and basil - the shrimp is deveined and comes with tail on - they are succulent and great with the light side of angel hair pasta; the herb sauce is very nice and has a slight tang from the lemon); or their Luau Salad (grilled chicken breast, mixed greens, cucumbers, green onions, red and yellow peppers, green beans, carrots, mango and crisp wontons, macademia nuts, sesame seeds, all dressed in a vinaigrette - the salad is very fresh, and I love the combination of the crispy wontons with the mix of the green beans, carrots, and the chicken; this also comes in 1/2 portion during lunch).  My favorite cheesecake of all time is their Pumpkin Cheesecake - it is only available from October through the holidays - we always order it ahead of time so we can enjoy it during Thanksgiving - it is creamy, and has a wonderful pumpkin flavor throughout - not too sweet, but quite decadent and a great way to finish up the meal. +brown bread with soft butter (complimentary) +Luau Salad +Shrimp Scampi +Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic +Pumpkin Cheesecake"
Bernard M.,"Nashville, TN",6,80,49,4.0,4/29/2014,"Had lunch here the other day.  Frankly, better than the one at Tysons on every level - service, food quality and cleanliness. Had the Avocado Eggrolls for a starter...they did not survive three hungry mouths!  I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich while my lunch companions had the Lemon Chicken Piccata and the Baja Chicken Sandwich.  Like the starter, the two of the three entrees did not survive.  There was so much food my wife took home one of her tacos...but it didn't survive long either.   Two of us split a yummy Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Alas, it too succumbed to our attack.   Service was great - never had to ask for a refill on our teas and the food was delivered piping hot, including the French Fries.   Overall, this experience changed my opinion about this restaurant chain...maybe at the next place we will find Penny and the BBT gang!"
Le L.,"Annandale, VA",151,220,313,4.0,9/27/2013,"One night we all were craving for desserts and coffees so we decided to go to cheesecake factory in Fair Oaks Mall for that. We literally went without reservation and with more than 10 people. Of course we had to wait since it was on a friday night and with no reservation. We didn't wait for long actually. They were really fast on preparing us a long table to fit all of us together. We waited for about 20 minutes and I was very happy with that. We sat down and the waiter came by right away and assisted us. We all told him that we came here for desserts and coffees. He was nicely introduce all their famous cheesecakes and his favorite one and which one to stay away. I was happy for his honesty since they didn't sugar coat on all their products. We all ordered one cheesecake and some people ordered coffee and it came out pretty quick. He was able to accommodated all of us without frustration because we know we in a big party.  The only thing I didn't like it because they didn't have several cheesecake that I wanted. I went for option 1, they said they ran out then I went to option B (also went out) I didn't have a choice but went with his recommendation. I was really upset with that because they should have known to make more than expected on a weekend."
Nicole W.,"Arlington, VA",92,153,141,3.0,4/8/2015,"I've been to this location several times but this review is for my most recent visit... I'm a huge fan of fish tacos!  They're delicious... And I like to try them at any place that has them on the menu. Unfortunately Cheesecake Factory, Fair Oaks falls short when it comes to fish tacos.  My tortilla was definitely not fresh, the grilled fish was dry and lacked flavor.  My friend got the tempura fish and said it was equally unremarkable.  The cabbage on the tacos was bland.  Meh!  Super disappointing.  I had to soak my tacos in hot sauce to give them a kick.  Perhaps it's the fact that they have about 500 different food items on the menu but food isn't actually their specialty... It's cheesecake.  And I can say that their cheesecake is banging!  I shared the Khalkha cheesecake with a friend and it was amazing!  Rich, creamy... Awesome crust. Their cheesecake never fails me... But the food... eh...  Huge portions but nothing remarkable... Especially when it comes to the tacos.   **Note... I can say that the service there is always great!"
Gerald H.,"San Francisco, CA",634,827,12777,4.0,4/6/2014,"You can never go wrong with this place. The avocado egg rolls are amazing! The salads, burgers and pizza are all good. Just remember these salads are not for those calorie counting folks. We arrived for lunch and was seated pretty quickly. The service was great but getting the check to close took awhile as the crowds starting to come in. We passed on the cheesecakes this time but maybe one day."
Izabella M.,"Fairfax, VA",59,9,,5.0,5/12/2016,Great service great meal. The waiter was so knowledgable we were thrilled. Best time ever
Rob H.,"Fairfax, VA",525,66,14,2.0,10/22/2014,"Had a sub par experience here at lunch time with a group from work. We were seated in the bar area and the hostess pointed at our table at the far end of the bar and waved us forward. I thought it was odd that she didn't walk us to the table. A server came by and took our drink orders after a bit of a wait, but it turns out he wasn't our main server for the meal. We found that out after asking if someone was going to take our food order after the drinks arrived.  Another five minutes or so later and our assigned server swung by to take our orders and bring bread. The bread was totally smashed where it had been cut in half. I thought it was very strange that the kitchen couldn't manage to cut the bread without smashing it flat. Anyway, besides the smashed bread the rest of the food was very good. The last snafu came after we finished eating and had told the server we didn't care for any dessert or anything else beyond the checks. It was a fairly long time between that and when the checks actually got to our table.  Overall two stars because the service was fairly lackluster and it was very slow for a work lunch."
Nathan B.,"Manassas, VA",8,206,2,5.0,2/13/2015,My family went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my wife's birthday. It was a party of 7 plus a toddler in a high chair. Our server was Charles G. and he provided one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had. Charles G. was on top of every request and my son even involved him in his proposal to his girlfriend. We had a lot to celebrate last night and Charles G. was there for us in every way. The food was excellent as usual and the service was exemplary. Thank you Cheesecake Factory and Charles G. for making it a night to remember.
Charry L.,"Arlington, VA",4,172,177,3.0,3/6/2016,"Just your average cheesecake factory. They had a long long wait - they took a long time to bring our dishes, drinks, and dessert. Then forever to get our check. Granted it was vday weekend - they were understaffed and could tell that the waiters were extremely stressed."
Zara K.,"Rockville, MD",63,192,15,1.0,4/13/2015,Worst experience I have had till date  We went really late and we are usually very considerate when it comes to that and don't expect the best service just an hour before closing  However never in my life has someone slipped in a piece of PORK in my salad - we don't eat pork - it's not just a health prefference or a taste thing - we don't eat pork for religious reasons and they didn't seem to concerned about it. Never going back here.
Beverly J.,"Ashburn, VA",0,7,,5.0,10/23/2016,This one is my favorite Cheesecake Factory locations out of the 3 Northern Virginia locations. The service and the food is excellent as well as the bar at Happy Hour! Great atmosphere too! Will be returning soon!
Saktah K.,"Fairfax, VA",12,12,4,5.0,11/21/2014,"We tried at this mall location for the first time and the experience was phenomenon! Even though we had to wait for 50 mins waiting line on a Friday night, it was worth the wait. Our server Sara was very knowledgeable about the menu and she helped us choosing our foods and all of them turned out to be very good. I personally will thank the cheesecake factory HR dept for giving your employees a proper training about a prompt customer service. Manager Ricky was very accommodating, he offered me a soup/salad when I was waiting for my food- thank you for that! :-) The property itself is very clean, even though it was a very busy night, the restroom was spotless and I give you my two thumbs up for that! Hope to come back again soon! Please keep it up!"
