EJ J.,"Centreville, VA",2,29,32,2.0,9/27/2014,"I usually don't eat here unless it's just for dessert or for the LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA (Mmmm, my fave...) because the rest of the food is awful and overpriced. But unfortunately, I can't even count on my usual choice anymore because man! That pasta was the saltiest thing I have ever tasted in my life. What was supposed to be a creamy, sweet bell pepper sauce with a spicy kick ended up tasting like pure creamy salt water. What'd you do, dump a whole cup of salt in my dish alone?!  It was disgusting. The breaded fried parmesan chicken was still delectable, but unfortunately, the Cheesecake Factory has RUINED MY BELOVED LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA...the ONLY really good food item they had going for them...WHYYYY!!!??!?! Needless to say, I will only be coming back for their Lemoncello (which, thank goodness, was still delicious! Even though they only gave me like 5 tiny slices of strawberry to go with it...-_-) but nothing else.  Btw, my boyfriend ordered the chicken marsala, don't try that either. AWEFUL and BLAND.  In fact, avoid this place if you're serious about appeasing your taste buds. This is definitely a dessert only stop."
Jeanne Y.,"Vienna, VA",1,22,1,4.0,12/6/2015,"Always good.  My kids love their kids Mac and cheese.  I enjoy their lettuce wrap, Santa Fe chicken salad, and buffalo chicken sandwich.  Service is always consistent."
Bentley H.,"Miami, FL",5,24,4,2.0,1/20/2016,"Much confusion around the take out menu. Called in and ordered, gave name etc. and car information Showed up per their instructions and they were clueless. Oh well hope food is good, still not ready after giving them more time than they asked for."
Melissa P.,"Arlington, VA",0,24,,1.0,8/3/2014,"My best friend and I went on Saturday while waiting for her car to be finished at Sears. We have both been to this location several times in the past. Service has always been slow- it's always incredibly busy.  However this time my best friend found a dead baby cockroach in her ""Little House Salad."" We complained and the manager comped our food- but we were still expected to pay for our glass of wine. This was the worst food experience I have ever had! Any other restaurant would have comped our entire meal and apologized profusely. This was awful hospitality and we will never return."
Xavier F.,"Herndon, VA",0,8,1,4.0,3/10/2016,The best place to talk family on the weekend not  so much weekdays love it service is ok but they make it up with the food
AM B.,"Herndon, VA",42,183,70,3.0,11/21/2015,"After hours of shopping, we decided to treat ourselves to some food. We walked and walked around the mall trying to find something we BOTH wanted (you know how that goes *eyerolls*) ""Subway?"" ""Not in the mood."" ""Sushi?"" ""Oh. No wait you hate Sushi..."" ""Panda Express?"" ""GROSS!"" ""Chik-Fil-A?"" ""Too greasy!"" ""Texas De Brazil?"" ""YES!!! But it's so expensive..."" ""Nevermind."" You get the idea. So, we both decided to just go home, go to Harris Teeter and grab something from the salad bar. ""Have you ever had Cheesecake Factory?"" ""Um. No! All they serve is cheesecake."" ""Babes, they also have normal food!"" ""What? No way! Let's eat there then!"" As soon as we entered we were sat. Our waiter took our drink order, came back with the drinks and then disappeared for like 20 minutes... Nothing. Finally came back and asked us if we were ready to order. Sure. For the appetizer we ordered the Tomato and Basil Flat Bread (so yummy) I ordered a Caesar Salad & and my Fiancé ordered the ""Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger"" so we waited for our to arrive... About 10 minutes later our waiter comes back with bread, it would have been nice to know they give you free bread, we would have totally not ordered the unnecessary appetizer. -.- Anyways, skipping to the food, my Caesar Salad was good.  Very Fresh. My Fiancé's burger was MASSIVE. He can eat, and he couldn't finish it! That's how massive it was. It looked amazing too. Needless to say, we were so full we skipped on the dessert. We felt like 2 pregnant whales.  Food: 4.5 Waitstaff: 3.0 (please be more attentive)  Ambiance: 4.8"
D M.,"Manassas, VA",0,16,21,5.0,5/1/2015,I'm sad to say that I had not been there in a long time however I was not disappointed the service was great and the food was delicious. And of course I brought home a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake yum yummy!
Mo M.,"Brandywine, MD",3,20,357,4.0,1/20/2015,"Everything was great, only complaint I have is the calamari was very thickly sliced. I've never seen that before in all my Cheesecake Factory visits. I always order calamari. It tasted delicious like always but it wasn't small enough to eat in one bite. It was sliced so thick I have to use a knife and fork to eat it. Which made all the breading fall off when I cut it. I didn't like that at all."
Terri E.,"San Antonio, TX",94,119,37,3.0,8/27/2013,"The first couple of times I came and ate here I enjoyed it but, the last time I ate here last month was not so good. I ordered their meat medallions and mash potatoes. The mash potatoes had something crunchy mixed in that did not belong in mash potatoes.  Left a bad taste in my mouth and have not wanted to go back. Positive things: the portions are huge!"
Jon D.,"Fairfax, VA",0,3,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Not a long wait and decent drinks and cocktails. However, that's where the good experience ends. Server was polite but had very little knowledge about their menu items. Generous serving sizes, but the fact is its just waste. They load a plate with grain or pasta and a little meat. So let's get to problems other then portion control. Chicken Marsala was unrecognizable and tasted like buttered noodles with mushrooms and a drop of red wine vinegar as opposed to Marsala wine. Personally it tasted like bland garbage. 18$ worth of garbage. The bang bang shrimp and chicken $19.99 had a few pieces of shrimp and a full quart of rice that tasted two days old in the middle of the plate. I ordered a kids Mac and cheese for my 6 yr old son and when it came he said dad it's disgusting. I tasted it and it was an old soggy noodle with butter no cheese and I'm absolutely sure not even a pinch of salt was added. At this point I informed the server that this was unacceptable he sent over the manager who gave a half assed we're sorry. I asked does anyone even bother to taste the food you serve before it leaves the kitchen to which she responded no. I asked how does anyone including what you claim is a chef know what he is serving daily to customers if nobody even tastes the food. They looked confused. So what your saying is nobody tastes the food that you prepare before it leaves the kitchen and not only is your staff unknowledgeable about the food but there is no quality check to ensure food is made properly. They offered to comp it but that's not my problem. I stated from one chef to another please tell your chef to do his job. I'm pretty sure the sauté cook prepared both the mac n cheese as well as the Marsala. So essentially getting food out of the kitchen is more important then sending edible food for the price. Portion control is ridiculous, quality is below poor and a restaurant that has a staff that is unknowledgeable is unacceptable. I asked the manager and chef to try the food they had just passed off on to me and my family as i stated I wouldn't serve this to a dead person let alone a paying customer. They came back and agreed it was terrible. So that's my point the professionals of your kitchen are okay with allowing garbage to come out of the kitchen and nobody ever thought of actually tasting or ensuring quality control. The plate up looked like a truck stop so apparently the standards of this kitchen are low!! Now that being said I dropped it and paid my bill went home and had to prepare dinner for my son. All around avoid this Cheesecake Factory, it's about quantity without a single effort of quality I'd am surprised they claim they have a chef maybe he never heard of Marsala wine, salt and cheese.  Avoid if you can or unless they get their act together. I'm sure the desserts are good and maybe the coffee but how do you screw up that?"
Sandra B.,"Herndon, VA",0,10,3,5.0,10/10/2014,"Their skinny menu is GREAT! Meals under 600 calories. The chicken pasta was FANTASTIC!!!!   Sorta like chicken, bruschetta & pasta with basil. Just the right amount. Smaller portions. I will be back to visit your skinny menu.  My only criticism is that everyone should be given this menu with the regular one."
Stephanie A.,"Centreville, VA",245,52,203,4.0,8/30/2014,Love this place! Food was great and service was friendly BUT Wow randomly they have a Nat/Fly infestation and god it's annoying them flying around while I'm trying to eat and drink yucky
JP G.,"Fairfax, VA",124,170,590,4.0,9/12/2013,"Go there, read that novel they call a menu, load up on savory oversized portions, top it off with sweet oversized rich cake, pass out into a coma, repeat. What can I say the food is always great and no real bad complaints about the place. I especially love the interior, it makes you feel like you are in some sort of palace."
Beach G.,"Burke, VA",0,120,,5.0,1/18/2016,"Love the skinny menu. The Asian chicken salad is my go to meal. My son loves the skinny burger. Skinny Cosmo is very yummy but watch out for the $12 price tag (not posted on the menu) for 1 skinny cocktail.    Update. I went back and ate my Asian salad, son loved the soft tacos. Good service; music is at a better more comfortable level, we could chat without yelling.  The manager did call me about the cocktail price. So I know the manager does read the reviews on Yelp.  I ordered a glass of wine on this recent trip."
Jordan L.,"Chantilly, VA",25,14,,3.0,5/3/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, I go there with my girl friends all the time. Recently the past two visits I've had the same waiter who has made our experience less than great. His name is Lee and he makes the joke of saying ""like Bruce Lee but I don't do karate."" The service from him was atrocious. He barely checked on us on both occasions and when he did he was constantly rude and sarcastic. I work in the restaurant business as well and there is no excuse for his terrible serving. I refuse to tip him. I will be requesting to be sat OUT of his section from now on."
Kathy T.,"Fairfax, VA",431,10,9,5.0,1/1/2016,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory ever since it opened. It's my favorite restaurant and I would have to say the one in fair oaks have always exceeded my expectations. I am always greeted warmly and my server never fails to refill my drink or check up on me here and there. I would say I come here around 20 times a year. Although it does get packed and you might have to wait 45 minutes for a table, that is something that can't be helped. No matter how busy it is or if the waiter or waitress has been having a bad day it doesn't hinder them from being nice and making sure everything is going well. Also I've tried almost everything on the menu and I would say they give a plentiful amount (especially the pasta). The prices are moderate as well."
Lily W.,"Fairfax, VA",14,24,1,3.0,8/2/2014,"The food at the Cheesecake Factory is typical. Since the menu is so large, it's difficult to have any one item be exceptional, and it takes a long time for the food to be prepared. I ordered the Asian lettuce wraps. The sauces were delicious but the chicken tasted slightly rubbery.  Since the Cheesecake Factory is so busy as well, service lags too. We had to wait 3 minutes after being seated to be greeted and it took even longer to get our mixed drinks. Beware: even after waiting an hour and a half to get seated at a table, there is even more waiting around to get through a meal."
Devony P.,"Manassas, VA",159,49,87,3.0,11/23/2015,"Appetizers, dessert, and the service was amazing! However, our entrees were just horrid. With differently stay away from anything with pasta or rice from this visit, forward."
Mansoor S.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,50,23,1.0,10/31/2015,"This is by far the dirtiest cheese cake factory in the area. The service is really slow also, this is my second visit here and I have had the same issue."
Tereza Š.,"Haymarket, VA",11,8,3,5.0,8/22/2015,We always visit this place and leaving in pretty good mood. Service here is awesome. Waitresses are always smiling and polite!!! It is my pleasure to give good tip. Food here is great as well. And you will never leave hungry. I think that cheescakes does not to be commented- delicious!!!!!
