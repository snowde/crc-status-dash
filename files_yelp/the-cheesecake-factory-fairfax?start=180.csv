Shannon R.,"Centreville, VA",45,29,12,4.0,10/25/2014,"I typically don't write reviews for big chain restaraunt  but I wanted to write one for this particular location  All in all this is an ok Cheesecake Factory. It's always a wait because it's the only one in the area and it's conveniently located in a mall right off the highway. Service is always great, food is always good and the place is always clean. Whomever is in charge of the ordering has to get it together though I've been on three different occasions and they have been out of straws. To some that may not bother. But the last time I went we had a small child with us, and she needed a straw for a chocolate milk and there were no where to be found! Other than the manager in charge of inventory lol this place is great"
Daniel K.,"Washington, DC",162,48,14,1.0,7/31/2014,"My girlfriend and I, along with MANY other customers, came to Cheesecake Factory with the understanding that all cheesecakes were 1/2 off for national cheesecake day!! Unfortunately, the fine lines of the promotion are dine-in only!!! It would have been VERY helpful if this marketing campaign/advertisement was CLEARLY advertised. Unfortunately, the details were ALL THE WAY AT THE BOTTOM of the site under a string of several pictures, VERY distant from the promotional headlines. And for the record, there were SEVERAL customers in the line who felt the same way!!! What a POOR execution of their Marketing Campaign. Additionally, the marketing advertisement is on their Yelp Page, without the disclaimer indicating any sign of the terms and conditions."
Goddess L.,"Fairfax, VA",2,27,13,5.0,11/27/2015,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory today just for a slice of fresh strawberry. It was very crowded as expected however, throughout all of the chaos the man who took our order was very pleasant and personable. I almost gave up on great customer service but MATTHEW was awesome. Thank you for being respectful for that brief moment."
Chris V.,"Centreville, VA",0,57,146,5.0,12/28/2015,I always get the spicy cashew chicken. Good prices and great bread. Bring back the Jack Daniels cheesecake pleassssse.
Nicole J.,"Fairfax, VA",0,32,,4.0,12/18/2015,"Have gone there about 20 times in the past few years and food has been very good and consistent ,  The  waitstaff it's been nice every time we have gone  .  We will be going back again."
Sara S.,"Fairfax, VA",26,40,4,3.0,8/31/2014,"Unfortunately, my partner and I had more poor experiences with Cheesecake than enjoyable.  While the dynamite shrimp is excellent - there are often times when we must send it back because the shrimp is full of veins, sand and innards. We give it a try every time (because it truly is good when done correctly), but we are often disappointed.  The other entrees are standard but honestly, you could get the same at Olive Garden for five bucks cheaper.  The only entree I was mildly impressed with was their steak. Nice seasoning, good char and cooked well. Yet, $30 is pretty astronomical for steak which isn't even  organic."
Kate H.,"Fairfax, VA",112,297,288,3.0,8/12/2014,"There always seems to be a crowd waiting to get in here, so they do a good business. Service is attentive and the food is plentiful. I love the two breads in the basket served to each table. In general, the food tastes just fine. It's nothing really unique, and the menu is giant so it's hard to tell what's the specialty, but it's a-ok. Weeknights, they offer lots of $5 happy hour specials until 6 p.m. -- spinach and artichoke dip, guac and chips, nachos, chicken potstickers, sliders, etc. These special are only available in the bar area, so ask to sit there if you want to take advantage. Kids meals are a bit on the pricey side ($6.95 for a cheese quesadilla with no sides), but a drink is included. At our last visit, our server brought a special appetizer plate for our kiddo - some sliced bread and sliced bananas. Thoughtful!"
Tim H.,"Silver Spring, MD",28,115,6,3.0,4/23/2014,"CF executes perfectly, of course -- it is what it is without fail:  very tasty yet very rich food for the high-end chain crowd.  The restaurants are very nice and the service is right on par for the price.  Really, it's a low-risk choice, especially for groups with varied preferences as the menu is massive.  This location is no exception. But the introduction of calorie counts on CF menus was suicide.  You can easily spend all of your 2,000 daily calories on lunch at CF without batting an eye.  Some individual items are by themselves over the 2k calorie mark. This is not including dessert, which obviously is a prominent selling point for them. They make some effort to provide alternatives, but their clear strengths are the most metabolically expensive choices. That said, eating is an optimization problem with at least five variables:  price, taste, ease, health, and environment.  CF is a unique combination of these features, and the fact that they are miserable in one of those factors can be made up if you really value what they do for you in others.  I personally don't often value such intensive inputs, but as with anything, use it when it makes sense."
Sean H.,"Burke, VA",3,85,8,5.0,10/15/2015,"I've tried everything on their menu. Burgers, sandwiches, chicken, pizza, pasta, appetizers. They nail everything. Even the bread they bring to your table is fantastic. I can't even think of anything I don't like about this place. Plenty of places to sit both indoors and outdoors, staff is helpful, it's always clean. And what I like is how they're open late(ish), so it's a cool place to go with friends during the later evening hours. The menu selection is huge, you can order almost anything, and they even have a bar with tvs."
Mr C.,"Germantown, MD",0,12,3,1.0,7/28/2016,"Went the other day after not going in a while, place was crowded as heck on a Sat around 4pm. Food took a long time. The server service was average, my wife salad only had like 4 shrimps, mostly kale in it, my steak wasn't as good as I have had in some other places. I did enjoy the desert cheesecake thou. I don't think I will be coming anymore, for the price, you can enjoy a better dinner somewhere else. Sorry."
John Iver S.,"Fairfax, VA",9,33,96,4.0,8/16/2014,"Always a go-to place for family and friends. Their menu selection is extensive and includes international dishes. Of course, there's a reason why it's called Cheesecake Factory - their cheesecakes are out of this world!"
W L.,"Herndon, VA",0,8,,1.0,12/13/2015,"So so so bad - first time trying the cheesecake factory, and i regret going there. I ordered the bistro shrimp pasta, it looked like a mess. Shrimp breading was soggy and falling apart everywhere - i couldn't tell what was what in the plate. Sauce was heavy, oily and nothing special. I told the waitress i was not happy, so she offered to remake the dish again without the breaded shrimp. The new dish came in a complete different sauce, and the mushroom was missing. Shrimp came without the breading, which is fine, but it tasted like rubber, worse than before. I couldn't bare eating the shrimp at all.  Then came the dessert. I ordered the mango cheesecake...omg...SO SWEET like i am going diabetic. I took one bite and i couldn't finish it, just like the pasta. I felt so sick after eating their food. Service was okay, sort of un-attentive. Never refill our water unless asked couple times. I don't understand what's the hype about this restaurant."
Michael A.,"Alexandria, VA",12,34,6,3.0,8/15/2015,"I tried ordering something different than my usual Shepards pie. I ordered the burrito. Me and my cousin ordered it. We call it the rice burrito because it's huge but made up of at LEAST 75% rice.  So I regret ordering it and I hope this keeps you from doing the same. My next choice was going to be the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp which I will definitely order next time I come here. I did order a Long Island ice tea which was good, but not as good as this ruby red grapefruit mixed drink I had. That thing was strong and delicious. Anyway. Great place to eat and drink, but I'm seriously disappointed with this burrito."
Omar B.,"Leesburg, VA",9,52,29,2.0,6/27/2015,"First of all the menu is a novel, they have so many choices. The waiter was very friendly and always checked in on us. The food wasn't bad but it just wasn't good. We ordered the calamari and there was a hair in it, yuck! If it was possible I would give 2 and 1 half stars but this place just doesn't deserve 3 stars."
Ashley F.,"Phoenix, AZ",123,201,78,5.0,5/29/2014,"This place is sinful....its unholy how huge but delicious their food is. They have an AMAZING selection of food, anything you could ever think of, they have. Their portions are wild and is very difficult to finish but on the bright side that means leftovers! Yay! I don't even need to go into specifics about their cheesecake, it speaks for itself, i mean sheesh, the place is TRULY the cheesecake factory. Good service, but always so crowded, but it's worth it. My only problem is with the way the seating is. the tables for 2 are so close together that I almost ALWAYS have an eavesdropper or have been bumped into by someones behind when they get up. FIX THAT! I understand you guys make more money by trying to fit as many people as possible, but it takes away from the much wanted privacy couples are trying to attain by coming to this romantically themed restaurant."
Emily A.,"Fairfax, VA",125,211,176,5.0,12/17/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, and I'm happy that they've welcomed a skinny menu for the past year or so. I used to always order the asian lettuce wraps as my entree from the main menu, but now they have a skinnier version that I have switched to. I love them and the amazing sauces for dipping them. You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on that massive menu! I also really love the tuxedo cheesecake. It's hard to resist a slice when I go there, but sometimes I am able to indulge. Someone actually brought us a whole tuxedo cheesecake after I had my baby, and my husband and I pretty much devoured the whole thing over the course of a week or so. Just what I needed...to put on more weight AFTER the baby, but it was totally worth it for the tuxedo cheesecake...delicious!! Now I want a slice!"
Renee B.,"Leesburg, VA",61,17,,1.0,8/27/2015,Terrible service half of our food (our sides) never came but we were still charged full price. We waited 20 mins for our cheesecake. Then another 30 for our checks. This was when they were slow. I'd hate to be here when it's busy.
Precious J.,"Arlington, TX",46,273,861,4.0,6/13/2015,"This was my best experience at this location. The waiter Charles was outstanding. He was very knowledgable of all items on the menu, very attentive but not overbearing, gave suggestions on making alterations to menu items specific to what I felt like eating. For example all shrimp and no chicken .etc Grilled artichoke appetizer is a favorite, had a side of plantains (delicious) and shrimp (drawing a blank and don't remember the name - sorry yelpers) but it normally is chicken and shrimp it is spicy better with white rice the brown rice wasn't that great."
Chris H.,"Denver, CO",113,694,11,4.0,3/2/2014,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory chain. I have never had anything there that wasn't good and service has always been very good. This location fits the bill as a regular Cheesecake Factory. Good food, good service, GREAT desserts. The same as a lot of their locations, this one is in a mall and has easy access from the outside. Being in a mall also means that it has a lot of parking right out front."
Vik B.,"Chantilly, VA",1,19,,1.0,11/5/2015,"My last trip to this place indeed was last. Some of the staff is really ill mannered, especially those who seat you down. Waiters are good and food is hit or miss. Place is not cheap and I'd rather not pay when food is bad. Good bye factory"
