William B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,30,,5.0,10/16/2013,"Whenever I go there (once a month normally with my brother), that place is always rocking.  Just packed from wall to wall. With that being said, the service is still pretty good.  I know I am not the person the server is dealing with but they still try to make sure everyone is taken care. Never had an issue with our orders.  We get what we ordered and it is made the way we ask (My brother is a vegetarian, so sometimes he asks for things to be customized.)"
Leslie W.,"Fairfax, VA",77,152,34,4.0,12/26/2013,"Another chain review? When it comes to chains, it doesn't get better than The Cheesecake Factory. They have everything down to an exact science--from how many butter packets they will go through to how many salmon filets they will sell. It's insane how accurate they are. That being said, your food will be fresh and the service will be outstanding.  If you like eggs benedict--they make a hollandaise sauce that will make you want to run into the kitchen with a spoon and knock the cooks out cold so you can have the vat all to yourself. The menu is almost 30 pages long. Usually this is a red flag for me--you can't do a thousand things right, but CF can and does consistently.  The Fairfax location is loud and lively, so not exactly a date destination."
Jonathan L.,"Oxon Hill, MD",16,7,7,5.0,3/14/2014,Like any other Cheesecake Factories I've been to. I've had good experiences every time I'm there. But I just wanted to really recommend the Miso Salmon! It's definitely worth every penny.
Stacie M.,"Alexandria, VA",14,242,2,5.0,8/20/2013,"My favorite chain restaurant. I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta but decided to try the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and it was delicious! A different yummy than the LCP, creamier and definitely garlic-ly but very good.  We usually visit this location and if in the McLean/Tyson's area we'll also go there; both are great with friendly staff and clean restaurant. however, on this particular occasion (8/17/2013) our waitress seemed like working was the last place she wanted to be; service was really poor but the food was great."
Michella S.,"Lorton, VA",146,103,244,5.0,1/6/2011,"I actually enjoy the experience every time I go there. We once had a gay waiter and he was so funny. I totally wish we can pick him all the time. The mint tea is really refreshing. As for the many Thai food they claim its ""THAI"" they're not Thai but it taste freaking great though. So if they want to call it ""bakadukuchikonasalumachaya food"" I'll still eat it. The structure and building is very impressive. Almost kindda like a church you would see in.... Rome...maybe? I don't know, I've never been to Rome but it a sight to see. I like going there in the evening time because of the lighting. Oh and if you do go to this place, don't leave without trying upside down cheese cake. It is orgasmic!"
Hera I.,"Centreville, VA",0,3,,2.0,8/30/2014,"Service was good, but I ordered the Lemon Drop Martini and there was a whole fruit fly, half a fruit fly and a little wing floating around in it.  Server took it back to the bar and the ""new"" drink still had a wing in it.  We also ordered the crispy crab bites and there was a piece of foil in one of them, about one square inch.  Server said she would let them know but nobody came by or anything.  I would have expected a manager to stop by.  Thai lettuce wraps were delicious, but a disappointing experience overall this time."
James S.,"Leesburg, VA",0,9,,4.0,3/8/2016,"Giving it 4 stars just for the salted Carmel cheesecake. Food is okay, I feel like the cheesecake factory is well basically just popular because of the cheesecake. The staff never seems like they are excited to be there let alone wait on you."
Sean G.,"Fairfax, VA",43,5,2,4.0,12/13/2012,"Me and my girlfriend stopped in after an exhausting weekend hoping for a great meal. The Cheesecake Factory is always a great treat, with all of it's rich foods, and of course its wonderful cheesecake! My Smokehouse BBQ burger was really good, and my g/f enjoyed her Navajo sandwich. My Mojitos and my g/f's Gl Champanile Pinot were wonderful too! What really made this dining experience great was our server Jamie. She's new to the store, but was very pleasant. She always seemed to be at our table just at the right time for us to order more drinks or desert. I worked in restaurants for 15 years, and I know and appreciate great service. We'll be looking forward to coming back!"
Johnson H.,"Centreville, VA",93,166,128,4.0,9/27/2013,"My favorite Cheesecake factory location. I have always gotten great, friendly, and attentive service and the food for the kitchen has always been consistent.   And I love the Original Cheesecake :)"
Jenny S.,"Centreville, VA",25,144,108,3.0,10/24/2013,"I really do love The Cheesecake Factory, despite it being a chain restaurant and their massive long lines (Why don't you take reservations ahead of time?!) I'm a huge pasta lover and the Cheesecake Factory has great flavorful pastas that are so large in portion that my boyfriend use to share one pasta dish and an appetizer of the crab wontons.  My favorites are the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, the Thai pasta (which they no longer make, sad face).   The service here is always very friendly and attentive.  I heard that the training for to become a waiter/waitress is quite extensive, but it shows in their customer service.  Their long menu of cheesecake is both impressive and overwhelming.  My favorites are more of the classic flavors, but they have something for everyone.  They are very rich and sweet so sharing is recommended."
Wynton F.,"Hoboken, NJ",417,38,11,4.0,11/19/2014,"The usual from such a succesful chain restaurant. Service was great, as well as food and drinks. I went with the Orange Chicken which I go with most of the time, and it was cooked perfectly. If I am really hungry I go with the Teriyaki Chicken because most of Cheesecakes portions are so massive. Had a Mint tea (my go to) to wash the meal down, although they have taken the Mint Tea off the menu most CF's have it if you just ask."
Elisabeth K.,"South Riding, VA",45,16,47,5.0,8/18/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a wonderful place to eat wether it be brunch, lunch, dinner or just dessert to go! I've been coming to this restaurant a lot it's a place I always have to go to cause I just miss it! The portions are always HUGE!! So be careful you'll be super super stuffed but don't be disappointed I always take my leftovers home with me and they're just as good as they were the day before I had them! And I never ever leave Cheesecake Factory without a cheesecake!! The red velvet cheesecake is my #1 favorite it's always so moist soft creamy and delicious and it's never disappoints your tummy!"
Prongs S.,"Columbus, OH",0,11,,5.0,1/3/2015,"Insanely good food, service was great too and as the name of the place goes, the cheesecake selection is mouthwatering. Rotini Alfredo Pasta and the crab cake entrees are good too. Top place to eat. Although, can be a bit noisy. It's quite a decent family restaurant"
Ethan B.,"Fairfax, VA",145,104,63,4.0,7/10/2012,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory for the same reason I like McDonalds.  The food, service, and atmosphere are always the same and my expectations are always met (and you get the amazing bread!).  Obviously the food at CF is better but seriously, when I don't want to risk a crappy experience at one of the other chains in Fairfax I suggest the CF.   The service here is always great and the servers have personalities which I like.  It looks like they are having fun while they offer good service and free bread!  I have come here before and just had drinks or coffee and asked for free bread and nobody asks questions.  That's the way it should be. I do love the tuna tartar and the seared tuna salad but have I mentioned the free bread? I have been known to come here late at night to just get coffee, cheesecake, and bread.  It is the motivation I need to go to the gym the next morning.  In the evening it is much quieter and if you sit at the bar it is a lot more intimate and you can run into some interesting characters.  I have even been known to share my bread with strangers, something my mom told me to never do...  If you're lucky you'll see me there and share a loaf of bread with me."
Patrick T.,"Locust Grove, VA",0,21,,2.0,12/13/2014,"This was a 5 star experience if you don't count their unsatisfactory yelp ""deals"". It says free slice of cheesecake when you purchase a $25 gift card. There are way too many exceptions to getting it though. I went in asked to buy a $25 gift card, then asked for a slice of cheesecake. They said I could get the gift card now, but I'd have to wait until January to get a free slice. This bothered me but I decided ok I'll do it. Then she tells me I'll have to eat here first THEN buy a gift card, then in a few weeks (January) I'll get a free slice of cheesecake. No thanks....the Louisiana chicken pasta was good, but I'll prob just go to a Springfield town center restaurant next time."
Loe Y.,"Vienna, VA",11,39,99,4.0,10/14/2014,Food always tastes amazing here and the servers are very nice! I am a regular here and I have been disappointed after a meal; love their hibachi steak and pastas especially. Banana cream cheesecake is my favorite for dessert
Bill P.,"Fairfax Station, VA",56,473,1198,3.0,1/30/2013,"Went here recently for an office Holiday luncheon. The menu offers a large number of choices. I had the Spicy Chicken Chiptole Pasta. It was good but the penna pasta on the top of the dish was cooked dry. Considering that there were about 20 in the group, I shouldn't complain. The service was friendly and efficient. Everyone got their orders at the same time. The portions are large. The waiter tried hard to sell us on cheesecake for dessert. Most of those who ordered cheesecake got it to go. This is a good restaurant for group activities. The restaurant is very busy, but does take group reservations. I have eaten here several times. While the food here is generally good, I haven't had anything to rave about. The restaurant is usually busy with long waits for tables. So this usually isn't my first choice for a place to eat."
Irene C.,"Vienna, VA",306,418,237,4.0,1/6/2011,"I normally don't give more than 3 stars to large chain restaurants such as Coastal Flatts, Sweetwater, etc b/c their food tends to be a hit-miss. However, I have been to the Cheesecake factory many many times and each time, service is quick and very attentive. Although I normally do not order the food from here b/c the fatty I am go straight for the dessert, I've noticed that for the price, you get delicious yummy food in large portions (1 entree can be shared among 2 people).  I had the drinks here for the first time today and they are definitely worth the price! My friend ordered a pomegranate margarita ($10) and I ordered the pomegranate mojito ($10.75). Not only was the drink strong (but not overwhelming that all you taste is the tequila) but it was also very tasty! It's not overly drenched in juice nor is it overtaken by alcohol but had the perfect combination of both! The drinks were served in large glasses b/c I noticed normally at other large chain restaurants like Coastal Flatts or Sweetwater, the drinks are literally HALF the size of the ones served at Cheesecake Factory for the same if not more expensive prices. If you come between 4-6pm on the weekdays (i'm not quite sure which weekdays- maybe Thursday & Friday?), drinks and appetizers are only $4-5, which is a deal! I will definitely be heading to the bar here very soon :)"
Rahul S.,"Perry Hall, MD",3,7,,4.0,2/20/2016,they have delicious Pasta's and amazing CheeseCakes ! the servers are cheerful and pleasant. my next mission would be to taste all the cheesecake varieties they have
John J.,"Washington, DC",0,9,,4.0,10/30/2014,"Stopped by on the way in from lynchburg, va food was ok drinks were great had two jack and coke. Got a buzz, Waitress, I have have no complaints. I would stop by again."
