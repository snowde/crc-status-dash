Susan H.,"Reston, VA",451,633,1111,3.0,2/4/2010,"I remember when the Cheesecake Factory first came to be.  Before it was even in this area, it was in Las Vegas---in the Caesar's Palace Shopping Mall to be exact.  The hype was really something.  Everybody raved about it.  When we first spotted it in Las Vegas, there was a long line waiting to get in and this was during an off-peak time.  So...when it hit this area at Tysons II, we went and thought ""What's all the fuss about?""  In other words, it didn't live up to the hype.    Well...since then we've been to the Sterling location, and now, tonight, this one at Fair Oaks. Actually, tonight was the best experience we've had with the place.  The food was far better than it had been at the other locations.  This leaves me wondering if this is only in this location or is it chain-wide...? I find the menu choices to be overwhelming.  Our server told us that there are 200 different items on the menu!   Finally, I decided to try Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna.  Before ordering, I asked the server just how spicy this dish was.  She said she gave it an 8 out of 10 with 10 being the spiciest.  Ok...I'll take my chances!  Well...it turned out to be very tame.  Yes, there was wasabi flavoring but it only faintly registered.  The menu said that the meal included rice, julienned vegetables and a ""miso sauce"".  The sauce was white (I'm assuming it was supposed to be white miso) but didn't have a miso flavor.  The julienned veggies were a mix of carrots, green beans and a couple of edamame beans.  The tuna was served rare on the inside and just seared on the outside.  Disappointingly, it came out lukewarm.  The tuna quality wasn't as good as Legal Seafoods but still it was decent. My husband ordered the Salisbury Steak dinner which came with a mushroom gravy, homemade redskin mashed potatoes, and green beans.  He was pleasantly surprised with the dish.  He thought it was better than the average Cheesecake Factory fare. We were full so we got a piece of Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake to go.  It had a brownie crust with Kahlua flavored cheesecake, topped with chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache.  It was tasty but very rich so we were glad we only got one piece to share! Service was very friendly and very attentive.  You know, we may well consider coming back to this location!"
Brie M.,"Washington, DC",3,14,,5.0,12/7/2015,Love it! 4 cheese pasta is my go to! And their cocktails are amazing :) love the professionalism the Cheesecake Factory staff employs.
Brittany J.,"Fairfax, VA",3,12,2,5.0,10/17/2014,The food is absolutely amazing! This has definitely become one of my favorite restaurants. The service is usually really good as well.
Salil M.,"Arlington, VA",57,77,11,2.0,6/22/2012,"Too much food that had to go back 3 times before they could get it right.  I wouldn't call this a 'restaurant' it's more like a feeding trough. When you see people eating here that are the size of the table, you know it's probably not where you want to be (unless you are like us and share a meal.)  Seriously, do you really need 4 pounds of fries?  Worse yet, do you really need to finish them at one sitting?  Think long and hard before eating that much and complaining that 'oh I can't fit into my pants anymore.  I don't get it, I eat salads all the time.'  Yeah, if that's a Cheesecake factory salad which has 1 pound of cheese, bacon, fried chicken, 6 gallons of dressing, maybe you need to re-examine your goals. I bring my Canadian in-laws here just to look at this infamnia.  I just like to see their healthy bodies laugh, because I'm tired of seeing beach ball bellies jiggling. Yeah, yeah, I'm sour about the state of health in America.  And I blame you, Cheesecake.  I blame you. On a happy note, our server tried to make our food gluten free."
Autumn Y.,"Fairfax, VA",56,7,1,4.0,4/22/2012,"Love this restaurant!  There are a variety of entrees you can choose from, and most of them are super amazing.   My favorites are the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish, the Jambalaya pasta, and the Turkey Burger.  Their fries are really good too.  The portion sizes are HUGE.  However, I didn't like any of their Mexican food.  And when I say I don't like something,  it has to be terrible because I'm not a picky eater.   They're always crowded, which could be a good or bad thing.  I just dislike the tiny tables they have (seating two), because there's no room for their huge dishes. Plus, you have no privacy since the tables are so close to each other; if I wanted to, I could probably poke the person sitting there without having to reach for him/her. Still, I'll be back on occasion since some of their dishes are good :)"
Tucker H.,"Stuttgart, Germany",49,644,123,3.0,4/25/2010,"It's Cheesecake Factory: nothing more, nothing less.  Any time you have 21 pages of menu, there are bound to be hits and misses.  I'm partial to the Crusted Chicken Romano, just pasta in sauce with a couple of breaded, pan fried pieces of chicken.  The Shepherd's Pie was pretty meh though.   The primary reason to come here is, of course, the cheesecake.  The Key Lime is wonderful, nice and tart.  I usually get the Kahlua, which is as close to coffee flavor as they have, and is quite good as well.  They also recently added a Mango Key Lime, which was quite good, but does have a dried coconut crust, and since I can't stand dried coconut I would just stick to the Key Lime next time."
Miyuki L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",79,282,1135,2.0,7/25/2012,"Maybe its me but the Cheesecake Factory has lost some of its appeal. Specific to this location, I printed the FB coupon and it says expires 7/31 so I went there about a week ago and the server was fine with the coupon. I ordered three slices and knew only one would be discounted, a person who I can only assume is a manager comes to the table all loud not asking how the meal was just wanted to know if we still wanted the cheesecake or not because this coupon was only good on the 31st. Shame on me for not fully understanding the coupon but I really think it was tacky of this person and he came off very unprofessional. I of couse took my cheesecake but it left a bad taste in my mouth. The food was ok but I am doubtful I will return to this specific location."
Rachel L.,"Leesburg, VA",5,47,,5.0,1/19/2012,"Why I'm giving it 5 stars: 1. They cater to food allergies.  I'm allergic to shellfish and crustaceans.  I told them in advance, and they HONESTLY told me what I should definitely avoid on the menu and what they could modify to make sure my food didn't have any cross contamination from my offending foods.  2.  They are baby friendly.  I brought my 11 month old son with me and the waiter was super patient with me and my son.  When I ordered my dessert he brought out extra whipped cream for my son to play with and helped me clean it up after his fun mess time with it.  3.  Food is excellent.  I have my favorites, I will not lie.  I have a tendency to order the same dishes, and they still taste the same time after time, which is great consistency to me."
Robyn M.,"Fairfax, VA",6,87,28,1.0,3/5/2012,I do not see the fascination with this restaurant.  Lets all go stand in the mall for an hour waiting for a table to get food that is just a little better than Ruby Tuesday's or Fridays.  My husband and I see eye to eye on this.  We won't be returning it's just not worth the wait.
Meaghan O.,"Washington, DC",3,25,3,1.0,12/27/2013,"I used to be one of the biggest fans of this restaurant, EVER. But sadly, that is no longer the case.  To start, the service at this restaurant is terrible. The last time I ate here (and I didn't even really get a chance to eat) it took us 20 minutes to get ASKED what we would like our drinks to be. Really, dude? I could have asked for a water cup from the BK at the other end, gotten water, and been back in my seat before you even asked what I would like to drink. Strike number one. Strike number two would be the fact that I never really knew who our server was until the last 15 minutes of our meal. And that was AFTER the last straw and I spoke with the management. Strike number three would be when I found hair in my food. Not just one hair, but a little tuft if you will. Of course this was after I already started eating (delightful). After waiting 20 minutes to get someone's attention, I finally got so annoyed I asked to speak to a manager. Either it was his first day, or he needs to find a new calling. At first, he only wanted to have my plate re made at no charge. How sweet, but remind me why I would trust your chef to cook my dinner again? When they can't even handle food safely to begin with? NO THANK YOU SIR. I basically had to push him to have my plate covered at their expense. If this would have happened anywhere else (it could have been a fast food chain for all I care) this would not have happened. I'm pretty sure the whole tab would've been covered, with a few freebies. But I can't ever recall finding a tuft of hair in my food before, so I digress...  I wasn't expecting a lot after that disappointment, but I definitely was not expecting that type of ""resolution"". If it was up to me, this place would receive no stars. You can have a tastier, and cheaper, meal elsewhere (without hair in your food)!"
Scott A.,"Fairfax, VA",0,12,1,4.0,10/13/2015,"Food is always good, and the service is excellent most of the time. The decor is dated, and the menu could use some updates, but it's tried and true. Decent lunch specials, although a dollar or two overpriced. Been here many times, and never have a serious complaint!"
Elissa H.,"Northern, VA",11,79,283,4.0,5/22/2015,"I've been eating at cheesecake factory since the Bethesda restaurant opened in the late 80s/90s. This location always has affable servers and the management is always on top of any issues. The menu is still too broad, but that's okay."
Crystal C.,"Fairfax, VA",105,3,,2.0,8/14/2014,"Food was ok but service was horrible....wasn't the first time either. So went there today with my folks for lunch, in the beginning everything was fine and our orders were taken in a timely manner. However, whenever we wanted the waiters attention, the waiter kept walking around looking busy but kept ignoring us-happened quite a few times before he remembered us I guess. In all we waited FORTY minutes for just hamburgers and lunch portion salmon and if there was a huge crowd I'll be more understanding but there weren't that many people! I would have thought the manager would at least come over to apologize if anything but no nothing happened...we still have to pay for the whole meal nothing was taken off...horrible service.  Last time I was at another restaurant and was made to wait...mind you I only waited around 25 min, I had the meal taken off the bill and two managers came over to apologize AND got free dessert.  Side note: Tyson corners cheesecake factory isn't bad!"
Carly C.,"New York, NY",309,280,831,3.0,7/8/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the only chains that I will still go to. Even though their food and drinks never fall into the earth shaking category, they do always provide just enough to get the job done.  My advice: Order The Ritz Martini. This drink is surprisingly tasty, and you won't need to shell out that much cash to get your party started."
susan w.,"Manassas, VA",0,45,,2.0,7/21/2014,"I had white chicken chili yesterday.  What arrived was definitely not a ""generous"" bowl.  The bowl was half full.  No garnish of salsa or anything else.  Almost no rice.  This was not worth the $13 I paid.   When I got the bowl, I actually just sat there, thinking I paid $13 for this.  Apparently, this dish  is also on the Skinnylicious menu, but I ordered off the regular menu.  Maybe they cut calories by just serving less of what you are paying for."
Kathy C.,"Fairfax, VA",0,19,5,4.0,9/8/2015,Their mushroom soup is absolutely amazing!  My favorite soup on the planet!  The menue choices are huge.  I have navigated thru it.  Not all dishes are a 5.  However the ones they get right are perfection!  I recommend the sausage and feta flat bread pizza.  Also the chicken dishes are great!  Shame they took away the pinapple upside down cheese cake.  It was my favorite.
M B.,"Gainesville, VA",0,4,,2.0,9/1/2014,"I used to love going to Cheesecake Factory... I would either order the Cajun Jambalaya pasta or Louisiana Chicken pasta. Yes- the food is terribly unhealthy for you and I usually get two or three meals out of a plate but I don't typically go out to eat for healthy food, I'd rather prepare my own dinner if I'm going to eat normal food. The wait was only 10 minutes and our server was great, everything looked clean last night. Then... A few hours later... The food poisoning kicked in. I had a rough night of vomiting but my husband was fine. It's strange to me that a cooked pasta would cause issues but maybe it was handled with hands that touched raw meat at some point, or sauce sat out at room temp too long, who knows. At this point- I probably won't dine at CF anymore, limiting myself to Preet Palace, Silver Diner and Honeypig for local eats."
Stephanie C.,"Waterfall, PA",6,142,1,2.0,12/27/2013,"So I've eaten here 3 times, it tears my stomach up every time. All the dishes I had tasted good but my guts just can't tolerate whatever it is they put on the food here. Service and wait time is average. The booths and tables are all reallly close together which makes the huge space feel cramped."
Jon L.,"Manassas, VA",166,1603,1850,2.0,8/13/2009,"I went here with a dozen or so co-workers for a 'good bye' gathering. I wouldn't have ordanarily selected this place. It confirmed what I had thought about this place; Franchise Deluxe. The menu is like a novel, they have something for everyone...literaly. I had the stuffed chicken tortillas...it was alright for 18.00... a little pricey The place is massive, the do have an outside patio and while they are located at Fair Oaks mall, they do have easy access from the parking lot. I would say this place is best for going where you need space for a large group. I think it's overpriced for what you get."
Darrin K.,"Gainesville, VA",0,9,,5.0,8/2/2014,"Cheesecake factory is among the best restaurants, especially for a chain. Among my favorites are their mac n cheese balls for appetizer and their burger and fries for dinner. But they also have a great meatloaf dish along with breakfast dishes that are usual breakfast fare but it is top notch."
