Brenda M.,"Stockton, CA",21,65,20,5.0,1/17/2012,"About a month ago, my bf decided to take me to the Cheesecake Factory. The place was packed (I believe it was a Friday), but since we were only a party of 2, we were seated immediately, very much to the other peoples dismay...HA! We were seated and I already knew what I wanted, as I studied the menu online from the night before. The spicy ahi tempura roll was delicioso! Wasn't as spicy as expected, but it had great flavor. The bf got the buffalo wings as expected, and they were huge. I can't say much about the taste considering I was stuffing my face with my appetizer. The entrees came as soon as I was done with my roll and he was maybe 2 wings from being done. For it being packed, we were surprised at how fast it came. I had the pasta carbonara with chicken...huge plate! The chicken was nicely grilled and the pasta was cooked perfectly along with the sauce. He had the filet mignon, done medium. Again...me stuffing the face...didn't have the chance to taste his food. He liked my food however. Dessert...Of course it's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY, who's gonna go there without eating dessert? He did. I? Not so fast there, young lad. I'm not one to eat really sweet things, so the tiramisu cheesecake (coffee cheesecake on top of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, topped with a bavarian cream, dusted with cocoa and chocolate whipped cream) was right up my alley. And I chose the right one because it was so delicious without being overly sweet.  When I went home I realized how the pasta I ordered was on the list of the most fattening pastas in chain restaurants...I thought I was doing good by ordering that but...eh whatever lol....It's still a great place with lots of items on the menu, somewhere that you can take large parties to and everybody will get what they want."
Eric P.,"New York, NY",350,261,24,3.0,1/26/2009,"At least they're consistent. It is a chain after all. I had the BBQ salmon with crispy onion rings, sauteed vegetables and skin-in mashed potatoes. Tres delicioso! The atmosphere was just like every other CF in the country -- a strange Euro-Egyptian motif with super-high ceilings and an mind-numbingly huge menu selection. I just opted for selections from the specials list -- it made life much easier. The service was fast and courteous, my water glass was always full, and the bathrooms were clean."
U.S. A.,"Herndon, VA",160,305,18,4.0,8/9/2013,"The food tasted good, I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, the chicken was super juicy.  The calamari tasted good.  The service was very friendly, they even brought out mini sundae's with candles for my girls birthday which was last week."
Elizabeth B.,"Fairfax, VA",24,47,,5.0,1/5/2014,"It's a chain, so it's pretty much the same everywhere, but I'm giving the excellent review for the service. Unfortunately, there was a mishap with a dish we had that made us sick. We called the store and they gave great customer service - so much so that we came back again afterwards. Definitely pay attention to your plate, but we've never had a problem since!"
Kyle L.,"Centreville, VA",11,25,3,1.0,1/19/2014,The to-go counter staff is far more interested in cashing the wait staff out at the end of their shift than attending to customers.  Complete waste of a trip up here as I left after 15 mins of waiting to pay.
Sarina P.,"Washington, DC",81,141,25,3.0,12/8/2011,"The challenges of this place are numerous to say the least.  Every time I eat at this restaurant, I leave feeling like I'm about to pop.  Today I only had half a Cuban sandwich and about a third of a piece of cheesecake, but I still felt as if I'd eaten more than my weight in carbs.  They don't take reservations, even with large parties, so you are risking a long wait whenever you go.  The waiting area is large, but open, and you end up standing around, awkwardly waiting to be seated.  The menu reads like a thesaurus and the portions are so huge even the lunch sizes will leave you sluggish. All of that aside, the food is good.  Not great, but very good.  If someone at your table can't find something to eat in the binder, chances are they can't eat solid food... even those people could have a milkshake.  The cheesecakes are very creative and yummy, but then again, they'd better be if you're eating at the factory.  :)"
Rebecca C.,"Alexandria, VA",16,125,11,4.0,10/2/2013,"Nice looking atmosphere, desserts don't ever let you down.  The food is always served in big portions.  We are burned out on eating there, but if you never ate there before, you will not be disappointed about your experience.  Huge menu to choose from that offers tons of variety."
Nathaniel H.,"Springfield, MO",4,38,12,4.0,9/29/2013,"I eat at Cheesecake Factory often while I travel. Lots of different experiences; mostly good. This experience was mostly good, but it got off to a rough start. Bread was not served (nor does it appear to be served to any table, unlike other Factories), my appetizer order was incorrect even though I said the full name and pointed to it, I was asked multiple times what I actually wanted, and my entree came out before I had even finished my first wonton. Once I had my food service was fine. I then ordered cheesecake and someone had to come back and ask me what kind I had ordered. The service seemed to be fine, but someone's memory was failing them."
Courtney S.,"Vienna, VA",123,30,11,4.0,9/15/2013,I like this location because they have outdoor seating. Food is consistent with other Cheesecake Factories. Service was attentive. No complaints.
Michelle B.,"Herndon, VA",77,90,,3.0,2/17/2011,"We used to come here all the time, before the kid arrived.  They is a very large menu, so large I often get overwhelmed looking through it.  99% of the time, I order the same thing.   Pluses - I am picky with my food, so I always get my food special order.  Basically, I change the entire entree. LOL.  They always do it correctly and without complaint. -Waiters/waitresses are usually in a great mood and provide great service.  There's never been a time when I haven't been impressed Cons -Seating.  If you aren't lucky enough to get seated in a booth, you get stuck in these long tables that remind me of eating in a high school cafeteria.  No privacy, you can hear everyone's convo and even sniff their food (just kidding, kind of).   -Too pricey, for what you get.  Many of the entrees don't come with side dishes, they must be ordered separately, which equals more money. All in all, an average place to eat."
Leila B.,"Washington, DC",88,27,29,3.0,9/3/2013,"Stopped by the Cheesecake Factory a couple of weeks ago after a stressful listing appointment at a client's house (I got the listing, but whew . . . I digress).  The one at Fair Oaks Mall.  I picked the chicken salad sandwich from the ""Skinny Menu.""  I shouldn't have.  Very little flavor and quite messy.  Why toast the bread because the chicken salad is going to fall out?  My cosmo was great though, so it wasn't a total bust."
George M.,"Apex, NC",0,10,,1.0,3/11/2015,"I saw a waiter drop a kids menu where the wait staff types in orders.  I saw 6 different waiters stand on top if it when they rang in orders.  One waiter stepped on it four times.  Finally the hostess picks it up and places it with all the other menus.  These people's feet were outside, in the kitchen, AND in the bathrooms.  No one cleaned it, now it will go in the hands of some 5-year old that will place their hands in their mouth.  I told the manager, he apologized, and went on his way.  I stayed 10 more minutes to pay my bill and in that time the menu went out to some table.  Nice job!"
Theresa L.,"Annandale, VA",5,32,5,4.0,9/11/2013,"I'm not a big fan of the Cheesecake but I love their food!!! My all time favorite would be the Seared Tuna Salads!!! It is perfectly seared with fresh spinach and several other type of greens. The portion was not too much nor too little, let's just say that when I finished my dish I was very satisfyingly full but still have enough room to want to come back for more next time!"
Noah K.,"Vienna, VA",0,10,2,3.0,4/8/2013,"Cheesecake Factory, an interesting place to go to that seems casual and a little bit classy at once.  Usually busy on the nights that I have gone with friends.  Wait times can be a little long depending on how many people you come with.  My friends and I came here about once every two weeks for an entire semester so I think I have a decent feel about the place.   The service has been great every time we have gone.  Drinks do not take long to arrive, and the waiter or waitress has always been vigilant on the needs of not just us, but those around us.  A usually friendly bunch.  They were amused when me and a friend started singing the songs playing on the overhead speakers.  Food and drink, pricey, very large selection, and in large quantities.  That's the thing that I have found consistent in my experience.  The food isn't the most top notch thing I've ever had, but it's certainly good.  And they certainly serve quite a lot of it.  There are some foods though I would avoid, such as the fish tacos.  While not a fan of fish in general, this sort of thing was not very pleasant to taste.  I, personally, go for the burgers most of the time.   Typical drink selection, alcohol or not, nothing too special to say here.  A few drinks stand out.  Need to pay for refills, full price if I recall correctly.   Only thing I wonder about in the times we have gone is where does our waiter/waitress go when we want to pay.  Many times, they seem to be right on top with checking on us, asking about food or drinks, and then suddenly drop off the radar once they drop off the checks.   I would like to go again sometime soon and see if my experience would be any different from the past ones."
Harrison O.,"Fairfax, VA",142,87,89,3.0,7/25/2013,"I met my wife for lunch and she had the Renee special for lunch and I had the chicken enchilada.  We also ordered the passion fruit iced tea which is delicious.  As usual, even for the lunch menu, the portions are very generous.  My wife's Renee special included salad, a half sandwhich which was a full sandwhich, and a bowl of soup.  My enchilada order were comprised of 3 enchiladas, some rice and beans.  The meals were nothing special but the service was very good.  I was surprised to see the restaurant so slow.  It is usually packed at all times of day.  I don't mind this place, the atmosphere is great and the food is decent."
Michelle L.,"Burke, VA",0,65,,2.0,1/7/2015,"Wow - this place has gone downhill. We used to love it and go out of our way to go to this location. The last two trips have had terrible service and just average food. Yes, it is still an easy and healthy meal for our daughter. But there are plenty of other places where I would rather spend my money on a good meal. Sad - I used to love it here."
P B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,23,2,1.0,1/1/2014,"This review is specific to this location and manager. We were a party of 4 adults and 5 kids (ages 4-10). Four people in our party were there when our name was called. The manager, Ricky, said we would need to have a majority of our party present to be seated. We said the rest of our party were parking their car and would be there in a couple of minutes. Ricky decided to give our table to another party and told us that we would get the next table available.  50 minutes later he was still unable to seat us and gave the next large table to another party.  He was clearly an inexperienced manager who was overwhelmed and did not know how to manage the situation.  His tone became disrespectful and somewhat aggressive when we periodically inquired and registered our frustration.  Ultimately our kids could no longer wait and we decided to go elsewhere.  At our request, Ricky gave both of our families $50 gift cards. That is the one positive thing from the night's experience.  But we would rather have just been seated when it was our turn. We love the food at Cheesecake Factory and will certainly be back. We just hope Ricky receives further training to handle these types of situations better."
Linda C.,"Centreville, VA",134,237,184,4.0,2/21/2011,"So who doesn't like cheesecake?  Cheesecake, of course, is the main event here - but there's so much more to like.  First off, the atmosphere and decor are amazing.  The ceilings are painted in soft watercolors, sort of a Trompe l'oeil thing going on.  The lighting and the artifacts (think marble columns, Greek statuary, Egyptian vases) create this heavenly atmosphere - even the entryway makes you think of a cross between the home of some Roman god and Caesar's Palace in Vegas.  One of the things I DON'T like about the dining room is that the tables are set very close together.  The servers have a hard time setting down dishes and working around the small space between tables.  But I attribute that to the popularity of Cheesecake Factory; sometimes the waits are very long, and if they had less tables squeezed into the dining room, waits would be even longer. On to the menu.  The menu is about 20 pages long.  No kidding.  It is a hardcover novel, with every other page an advertisement for a local establishment.  Today I saw an ad for a jewelry store, something called ""Girlfriends Meet Up,"" and fur coats.  I suppose these are sponsors of some kind, I don't know.  The menu goes on and on and on - it takes about 10 minutes to read everything, but their selection is incredible.  Everything from Shepherd's Pie to Vietnamese Caramel Chicken is listed.  I sometimes wonder how their chefs can create so many varied dishes and have them all be good.   For lunch today, I ordered off the specials menu.  The ""specials menu"" has been in circulation for at least a few months now, but the choices are pretty good.  I had an excellent salad called Carlton Salad, which consisted of roast chicken, raisins, cranberries, pears, feta cheese, chopped walnuts, all tossed in a light vinaigrette.  I hope they put this salad on their regular menu - it's too good to lose!  Other dishes I've tried have been the Chinese Chicken Salad (excellent, except too many puffy rice noodles stacked on top for decoration), Cobb Salad (also excellent), and Chicken Bellagio (on the current specials menu as well - terrific and another dish they should serve permanently).  Service was great - I've never had a problem with service here.  And, naturally, the cheesecakes.  I enjoyed sharing the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, made with a light lemon mousse and raspberry sauce.  Delish!"
D K.,"Fairfax, VA",1,6,,3.0,8/3/2010,"Went here tonight with my friend after hearing about this place for years and giving into curiosity.  In actuality, I felt that it was more of a 2.5'ish, but I suppose the cheesecake helped a little.  The atmosphere was a bit dark, but I don't mind that at all since it provides a feeling of privacy as opposed to brighter places.  There were at least five different birthdays being celebrated during my visit, though how many of them were actual birthdays I'm not too sure about.  Service was decent enough, our waitress was attentive and polite and our drinks were refilled consistently.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta while my friend had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  It was quite clear who had made the better choice in ordering based on intuition, and it surely wasn't me.  My pasta just didn't taste like anything special; it seems like you'd be able to find it in any other hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Eating it seemed like a chore after about five bites, but I persevered nonetheless.  The portions are quite hearty, but I wasn't feeling that way at the time given how I didn't want to eat much more of my meal.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was quite tasty, however. After finishing half of our dishes, we decided that it was enough and ordered dessert.  Naturally, we ordered the cheesecake, the main reason why anyone goes to this restaurant to begin with.  I had the Chocolate-Chip Cookie Dough while my friend had the White Chocolate Caramel Macademia Nut.  The cheesecake was pretty good as expected and the slice was a bit larger than I had imagined it to be.  If you're planning to finish dessert, don't try to finish your entree beforehand.   In summation, while I certainly didn't like what I had ordered, I would come back again and try something more tried and true on their largely extensive menu.  I would recommend Cheesecake Factory as long as you order something people have already tried and liked."
A B.,"Herndon, VA",0,17,1,5.0,12/22/2014,"The only problem here is that being in the the mall it is usually quite crowded with a wait time. But like all Cheesecake Factories the food, drinks, and cheesecake are awesome. I've always had good service at this location. Everything I've tried on their extensive menu has been great, including items from the ''skinnylicious'' menu."
