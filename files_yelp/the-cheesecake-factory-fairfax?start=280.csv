Bill M.,"Haymarket, VA",11,237,12,4.0,1/29/2011,"Atmosphere here is terrific I was dragged here thinking it was some tiny restaurant in a mall. Yes it is that and more sitting here in the dinning room it feels grand that's it grand,with marble looking columns and marble tables.The hostess tried to seat us in a booth I rebelled slightly and she went to ask permission if I could sit 8 feet away at a table? Seated at the table I was impressed with the selection on the menu. My only exposure to CF was down at National airport so I had no idea it is a full service restaurant.  I ordered a mushroom burger medium well . The burger was so delicous so tender. Cooked perfectly not overdone and dry! The Swiss was a little understated to warrant a fifth star. The service was terrific our server was very good. I like the look of the all white with crisp aprons and ties. After 25 minutes the place is packed with a line to get in, I can't help thinking all the fuss the hostess made over my preference of table before booth."
Kimberly C.,"Bristow, VA",0,10,,2.0,1/1/2013,"Although usually a big fan, both the food and service were  subpar today. Hardly saw our waitress and had been done with our meal for almost ten minutes before she appeared to inquire about desert or our check.   The floor was all sticky or greasy throughout the restaurant. Not sure what that was about, but you felt like you were about to slip and fall when walking through.  My husband ordered a cajun pasta. It was spicy but had no flavor. I ordered two appetizers that sounded delicious, but again lacked of any kind of taste (the ahi tartar and the avocado egg rolls).  My son did eat all of his kid's mac and cheese and said it was good. For the prices, we expected better. Our experience was more akin to a  low cost American food chain we were trying to avoid."
Brandon A.,"Saint Louis, MO",77,215,9,4.0,4/20/2011,"I love everything about this place except the seating. First its going to take at least 45 minutes to get a table. Luckily for us, there's a toy store across the way (its in a mall) and we have a 2 year old. Since they give you one of those beeper things, we could walk over there and entertain her until our table is ready, since the waiting area is horribly built. Its right in front of the cheesecake counter and its usually very crowded as I said, so finding somewhere to stand can be a challenge. Anyway, the service staff is amazing! Every waiter/waitress we've had has been excellent. You can tell they are busy, but they always make time to stop and check on you. The food is great, the ""problem"" and I use that term lightly, is that the menu is humongous. Its seriously like 12 pages long, so I either end up getting the same thing, or I just randomly pick something. So far I haven't been disappointed though."
Ken M.,"Houston, TX",0,240,,2.0,8/6/2011,"Saturday afternoon, asked for a table for 3. Was told 90 mins but to come back in 45 mins to see if anything changed. Came back in 30 and she said ""Oh, your back...Well, yes I have some tables"". She seemed surprised to see us.  I and my party were dressed in shorts (to our knees) and had sleeves on our shirts and had showered that day, so not sure why she acted as she did. Waitress messed up 2 of the 3 orders (for example: no bacon on the bacon and eggs). Fried shrimp was great, the eggs (no bacon) and hash browns were WAY greasy, and my friend had the  sweet potatoe fries which tasted gross. All in all, wont be back"
Rob W.,"Alexandria, VA",60,43,3,4.0,10/27/2010,"I took my wife here for our anniversary last night and we enjoyed ourselves. First a couple of things that weren't perfect: I got the salmon/shrimp scampi plate and though it all tasted great, the salmon's temperature was much hotter than the rest of the plate. Made me feel like it was nuked or something. The other minor thing is I don't like to have the little butter patties wrapped. Seems a nicer place would have the butter out. Like I said, minor. On the plus, the food was great, service was good, we stuffed ourselves, were happy, gorged on incredible cheesecake, and had a great time.  We'll be back."
Gail Maya-g T.,"Shepherdstown, WV",46,34,3,5.0,5/16/2013,"I'm surprised this location doesn't get 5 stars from everyone.  I love the food, the ambiance, the price, the service quality and the selection at this location.  The only drawback I can possibly imagine is that the menu is ginormahumongous, which can be confusing.  But I love this place."
K A.,"Reston, VA",1,71,,2.0,11/18/2014,"This place is either a hit or miss. Usually we go here for dessert.  Food is usually not bad either.  It's always cold in there, so bring a sweater. Service is usually meh. Last time when we got there,  their computers were crashed  and they couldn't service us."
Pam G.,"Alexandria, VA",0,4,,5.0,12/17/2014,"I met a friend for an early dinner before we went headed to the Warner Theater in DC.  I was really happy to see they had a skinny menu   I had the Shrimp tacos with a side of fresh vegetables.  It was fantastic.  My friend also ordered from that menu and picked the pasta and shrimp, she too loved her dish.  We will definitely be back.  Glen, our waiter was very friendly, funny and made our dining experience at Cheesecake factory even better."
Kristina L.,"Merrifield, Fairfax, VA",2,76,4,3.0,7/16/2010,"I always enjoy a night out at The Cheesecake Factory, but a recent visit as a new mom has changed my perception of this particular location. A friend,  my baby, and I went to dinner here one evening.  Parking was ridiculous and after 20 minutes of circling we found a spot that was closer to the mall than to Route 50.  We were seated immediately and the waiter was so exceptionally attentive that I tipped 25%.   However, when I had to change my son's diaper before we left, the ladies room did not have a changing area.  The ""family restroom"" was the only location, but was taken by a man (with no child!) who seemed to prefer a suite of a bathroom to the gender specific stalls.  After waiting for this family restroom for 10 minutes, I decided to change my son on the tile floor in one of the larger stalls of the ladies room.   I thought this would have been a family restaurant, and for the most part it is.  However, if you wish to be considered a family restaurant, install more than just one changing station in your restaurant."
E T.,"Rincon, GA",0,16,7,4.0,7/14/2013,"We've eaten at various cheesecake factory restaurants across the country and it's usually about the same everywhere, including this one. The fruit drinks are awesome, the food it good; but our favorite is still the Atlanta, GA cheesecake factory (the food just seems to taste better). The white chocolate/blueberry cheesecake is definitely our favorite."
Tim W.,"Fairfax, VA",1,53,,5.0,7/22/2010,"I love this place.  The menu selection is in a 3 ring binder (it's that big!)  Though you would think with so many options, the kitchen won't be able to execute it.  But, they do a great job.  The portions are big and the service is always solid.   The meatloaf is really good, as is the jambalaya.  Those are my usual go-to items.  The apps are very good, as well, but with so much food for the entree, I would invariably have to doggie-bag it. The cocktails are good.  The long island ice tea is mixed right, here. Cheers!"
April C.,"Washington, DC",4,24,1,5.0,7/4/2013,Food is great and so is the service. Orange chicken is TO DIE FOR. Loved it. Had it both in and take out - always good!
David C.,"Sacramento, CA",470,321,1794,3.0,12/19/2006,"This specific location just opened up recently.  I've read some good and bad experiences from other yelpers, so I wanted to add my .02 on my first time here. Since this location was fairly new, I wanted to see how the service would be.  Basically a reflection of the kind of people they hired here.   I had the jambalaya pasta which was a generous portion but lacking in seasoning and taste. But, I did like the avocado egg rolls for the appetizer.  The service was above average which was a great for my first visit here.  The wait was about 15 minutes, thank god! This location does have curbside pick-up if you're in a hurry.  If you've had a bad experience over at the Tysons or Clarendon location, you may be hesitant to come here.  But, I you just never know with chains like The Cheesecake Factory."
Novafam A.,"Fairfax, VA",2,14,4,4.0,1/22/2013,"Love the avocado rolls! Chicken cobb salad is great , good portion- you can box one half to take home."
A. S.,"Reston, VA",9,138,20,5.0,1/22/2010,"I try to avoid this place because I hate how crowded it (almost) always is, but it's hard to resist because the food is so great. Everything I've ever ordered has been good. My favorite apps are the corn cakes, tex-mex egg rolls, fried mac-and-cheese, and the sliders. The portions are so big that I often order one or two apps as my main course (only one if I want to have room for cheesecake afterward). This is my favorite place to go in the summer when I just want salad for a light meal, and the outdoor seating is nice, too. Again, the portions are huge. Ingredients are perfectly fresh, presentation is beautiful, and the flavor so satisfying that you could almost forget you're eating a salad. Highly recommend the Asian chicken salad. And, of course, there's the cheesecake. I don't often have room leftover to eat a slice, but you can always get one to go. Their chocolate-chip cookie dough cheesecake is out of this world. I don't think I've ever before used the phrase ""out of this world,"" but it applies here. In the best possible way.  I also have to give them props for their pomegranate margarita, which is by far the best version of this drink I've ever tasted. And, as with everything else, they're generous with the serving size."
Molly T.,"Northern, VA",88,69,13,4.0,1/14/2010,"Yay! I'm a Fan. Solid 4 stars. I found out about Cheesecake Factory a couple years ago and it's become a staple for good eats on the cheap. The portions are HUGE(HUGE!!) and the service is always good. The baked bread that is complimentary is delicious and their water is surprisingly refreshing(more so than other restaurants in the area).  -The Factory Nachos are HUGE and delicious. The sour cream, guacamole and tomato salsa are always fresh and they'll bring you more by request for free. We usually get it on the side, since it's HUGE and that way you can take extras home, which we do. They're good a day or two later as well(Warm/ Bake in oven). - The Buffalo Blasts are crispy on the outside with moist, spicy chicken on the inside. Their blue cheese dressing is fresh and better tasting than basically any other blue cheese I've ever had. Their ranch is good, too. My Mom and I typically share the lunch special: pizza and a Caesar salad for $10.95. It's enough for two and we usually take some home. My boyfriend usually gets his own meal and this kid can eat, but he still has leftovers. Try sharing-- save money and your fridge from overload. Another favorite is the Renee Special with chicken salad. The chicken salad is amazing- pine nuts, celery, chicken, some kind of good sauce(maybe just mayo, but it's yummy) on a buttered focaccia-like bread. It's also good leftover. The lunch special comes with soup and salad. I've been very pleased with the soups particularly the creamy chicken(which surprisingly had fresh vegetables that were healthy, but not overpowering) and the broccoli and cheese. The deserts are incredible, but some of the best are not totally cheesecake related. The lemoncello( soft cake, lemon and cheesecake with strawberries) and the Chris's Outrageous (Chocolate mouse, cheesecake and german chocolate layered) are some favorites. If you want cheesecake, the apple with caramel is good as is the chocolate chip cookie dough. The strawberry creamsicle drink ( alcoholoic) is a highlight from the bar. I remember the Fruit Punch( Tornado or something?) being a light, fruity and delicious drink as well. I've never met a meal, drink or desert here that I didn't like. This location also has a great patio for eating outside, which is wonderful in the warmer months."
Sarah K.,"Fairfax, VA",95,50,,3.0,11/1/2010,"I guess they call it the ""Cheesecake"" Factory because they specialize in cheesecake.  I feel like every single piece of cheesecake I've ever had there has been extremely decadent and wonderful. Bad for me, yes, but wonderful nonetheless. The actual FOOD sometimes just seems so... meh. I don't go here often, but every time I do, I can't help but wonder if they try to make up for the ""bleh"" taste of the food by piling on heaping portions. If it doesn't taste good, I don't want three times as much! The chicken tacos were a mistake: giant family-sized platter with way too much food on it, and not very good food at that. I probably should have known that from reading the menu; any place that serves pizza, pasta, burgers, ""Asian"" food, AND ""Mexican"" food just screams, ""DON'T EAT THISSSSS!"" I don't have kids, but I did notice that they didn't seem to have a childrens' menu. Maybe I'm wrong, but that teeny tiny three-year-old at the table next to me was working on a gigantic bowl of pasta by herself, and something about that just didn't seem right. If you have kids, you might want to think again. I will say, though, that their service is always top-notch. All the servers are really friendly and informative, and I feel like the service is pretty fast, too. Their breakfast/brunch on the weekends is actually much more affordable than other places in the area (I had a GIGANTIC platter of pancakes, eggs, and bacon for about $7 -- less than what I'd pay at the Silver Diner down the street), and the portions (as usual) were huge. Darn good pancakes, too. I will definitely return for the breakfast. And probably the potstickers. And definitely the cheesecake."
Frank O.,"Woodbridge, VA",480,204,19,4.0,3/21/2010,"Probably more of a 3.5, but we'll round up and give it a 4. Now I'm not gonna bash the hour plus wait here at peak ours because it happens at all Cheesecake Factories everywhere  When you come to one at a peak dinner time, you expect there to be an ungodly wait... it's just the way it is.  It comes with the territory of the restaurant.  Could they improve upon the wait time?  Maybe?  I dunno... but it's just how it is, so we're gonna have to deal with it.  Right?  Right.  Moving on... The service was pretty good; our waiter was very attentive and on the ball.  He came quickly for our drink orders and returned each time for the next phase of the whole dining operation at appropriate intervals.  Our orders came quite quickly considering how busy the place was.  The food had the typical Cheesecake Factory taste.  Fairly good.  I love the heaping glob of mashed taters you get with the meals... and the portion sizes are always ginormous. And of course... my now favorite part of the meal is the Red Velvet Cheesecake... O. M. G. !!!  Seriously... this thing will seriously make you have a moment.  Now I'm a huge red velvet fan period, so maybe I'm biased a bit... a tad... a smidge.  But this cheesecake is friggin incredible.  Just drop it in front of me and leave me alone as I drift to my happy place for about 10 minutes.  Sooooo good!!! So yeah, I approve of this Cheesecake Factory location... pretty good."
Kevin G.,"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain",34,27,,2.0,8/19/2010,"I personally hate their food. And it super, super bad for you as they use cheap cooking oils. Some of their entrees are upwards of 2500 calories and 70g of saturated fat (e.g. Bistro Shrimp Pasta). I went there with my parents while they were in town visiting. The menu is extensive but I couldn't help feeling like despite the multitude of options, nothing really caught my eye. Everything just seemed kinda... eh. I got a combo platter and it was eh. Not all that exciting or interesting. As for dessert, the cheesecake wasn't all that exciting either. Definitely looked better than it tasted. My parents felt the same way about their meals. The high ceiling tends to make the sound of the restaurant reverberate a little bit, so it's not exactly an intimate setting. Service was fine, nothing to complain about."
Judy A.,"Alexandria, VA",0,32,3,4.0,1/9/2013,"Been to the various Cheesecake Factory locations over time. The meatloaf sandwich is a great value, as there's enough meatloaf for two meals. What was really impressive, for this visit and location, was the efficiency of the staff. It was a packed Saturday night and I had a take-out order. They inquired whether I'd like bread and butter; they perfectly filled packed and the order (even though I had to call in a change); and the abundant sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked.  I rarely get take-out done so well, especially on a busy night."
