Sophie S.,"Sterling, VA",8,100,,4.0,10/25/2012,"My sisters and I went to Fair Oaks Mall for a little shopping and decided to eat at the Cheesecake Factory there. Service was great; our waiter was Stephen. He was polite and quick to fill our water glasses (which I always appreciate) and also helpful to us when we asked for daily specials, etc. The food was good: one of my sisters got the navajo chicken sandwich (the fry bread is pretty awesome!), and the rest of us got salads (beet and goat cheese (yum!) and the greek salad). For cheesecakes, the chocolate tuxedo mousse cheesecake is still my favorite. Although CF's menu is quite large, it's a good thing because you can always come back and get something different. I recommend getting salads and then small plate appetizers to share."
Ivy K.,"Fairfax, VA",0,9,,1.0,10/30/2013,"Mostly a lot of people go to the Cheesecake Factory because of there cheesecake, that was the reason I went there. The service was horrible and the spoons and forks were very dirty! My friend asked for a refill on her coffee and the waiter forgot to do that simple task. Then after we ate (food was ok) we ordered a cheesecake (regular with strawberrys) when we got the cake it wasn't fresh and seemed like it was very old! The cheesecake didn't taste good at all, the whip cream was chunky, the cheesecake itself even didn't taste like they had put any effort on it! Maybe I will go there again in a couple of months to try out there food again."
Jackie E.,"Bothell, WA",0,24,,3.0,1/4/2012,"2.5 stars My brother recently came for a visit from Alaska. There isn't a Cheesecake Factory in Alaska, so he wanted to come here for his last meal. Odd, yes. But it really can't be helped. The boy is a product of America and enjoys chain restaurants and substandard food. Oh, well. I ordered the Blue Cheese BLT Burger. They cooked it to my specifications (medium) and the toppings made it deliciously salty, smoky, and pungent. Yeah, I know pungent isn't a very good descriptive word, but it's bleu cheese...if it's not pungent it probably doesn't taste very good. I also ordered the side salad in place of French fries because I'm about sick of French fries. It was a large salad and came standard with balsamic vinaigrette. The top portion of the salad was pretty good. It was nicely coated with dressing. The bottom portion, however, was drenched in dressing! I couldn't finish it because the overabundance of dressing caused the whole salad to be overwhelmingly tart. I supposed I should have tossed the salad myself before eating? I'd definitely recommend to others that you order your dressing on the side. My brother ordered the Wild Mushroom. He did not enjoy it whatsoever. I kind of felt bad because he had specifically requested the Cheesecake Factory. I didn't try his, as I was consumed with the massive amounts of food on my own plate, but I definitely take his word for it. My family loves them some mushroom burgers. As we had eaten much too much, we had no room for dessert. Didn't matter much to me...I don't like cheesecake. My brother, however, ordered cheesecake to go. He wanted the Oreo cheesecake, but they were out. I know it's the weekend, but that seems like an odd cheesecake to run out of so early in the evening (it was around 6:00PM when we left). He ended up ordering the strawberry cheesecake to go and enjoyed it very much."

Regan H.,"Olympia, WA",56,7,,5.0,4/9/2010,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory several times, and always had delicious food and great service.  But my experience yesterday was really above and beyond.  I met a friend for appetizers at 3:00 with our two babies, both 8 months old.  If you've ever tried to go to a restaurant with a baby, you know that it can be exponentially more difficult with multiple babies.  It was a recipe for disaster.   BUT:  The hostess sat us promptly in a huge corner booth with room for two high chairs and a little nook on the side where we could leave a stroller.  She immediately brought each baby a plate of little breads and banana slices, which worked wonders for keeping the babies happy and entertained.  All of this was provided without us asking, or even suggesting it.  Our appetizers (guacamole and the ahi tartare) were, of course, perfect.  (I've never had a bad item at Cheesecake Factory.)  The wait staff was prompt and attentive, and cooed over how cute our babies are (and trust me, they're pretty cute).  And, I love that they have a big family bathroom with a changing table in it.  I wouldn't have thought of Cheesecake Factory as a good restaurant for babies, but the experience really couldn't have been better."
The I.,"Leesburg, VA",1,51,,3.0,1/15/2013,"Skimpy with the Shrimp My wife and I had lunch here today.  For a change, I had the New Orleans shrimp, which at $15.95 is not an inexpensive entree.  Unfortunately, it came with about 8 very small shrimp.  Since the price of shrimp has dropped in the last number of years with the arrival of farm-raised Asian shrimp, there is no justification for such a puny portion.  Very disappointing."
Marie M.,"New Kent, VA",243,8,,1.0,1/24/2014,"Long wait for an okay experience. Our waitress took down our drink order and did not return for 20 minutes. We ordered the appetizer salad and she charged us for the entree salad. Although we ordered our burgers medium, they came back rare. We don't plan on going back to Cheesecake Factory. It is not worth the price."
Rachel B.,"Fairfax, VA",0,14,,4.0,8/17/2014,"I wish I could give this place two ratings.  One for the desserts and one for everything else.  I would give five stars for desserts and three stars for the rest of the food.  A lot of their entrees are just kind of meh, nothing special.  My biggest problem with the Cheesecake factory is that their menu is way too large.  There's no way you are going to be able to have the freshest and best quality ingredients for all of the items on the menu and then be able to have quality control for how each dish is cooked.  I prefer the Great American Restaurant chains approach of a small but good quality menu."
Daisy J.,"Washington, DC",32,15,,2.0,8/7/2012,"Service was awesome as always but food quality is not consistent with other cheesecake locations. Cheesecake factory is my default go-to place, I only eat 5 items on the menu so I can tell when something is off and recently this location has been off by a lot. Too heavy on the sauces, ingredients were too wet, even missing ingredients. After sending back my sweet corn tamale cake, the manager agreed with me that something didn't taste right. I should have said something about my crab cake sandwich too but didn't. I had the worst food poisoning last night after eating here. Time to say goodbye to this location as my go-to until food quality is standardized."
Judith L.,"Atlanta, GA",202,470,84,3.0,8/28/2009,"I will admit, prior to coming to this location, I had nothing but bad experiences at other locations.  Walked in, party of two, just a couple minute wait around 2:00. Got to the table, and it seemed like the waiter took forever. Just asked for water, that still took a while. The tables next to us got bread, and we didn't... Fine, be that way. Ordered nachos as an appetizer, a salad entree and crabcake entree. Somehow, the food came out all around the same time, which was unfortunate becaue theplates wereso big we really hardly had room left on the table. The plates here are HUGE, but that is only to hold the MASSIVE amounts of food that they give you. I'd complain about the prices- but really, with the amount of food that they give you, it makes sense. Don't know about the salad, but the nachos were decent. Would have been better if the cheese and other toppings were distributed a little more evenly. Crab cake was pretty good. Had way too much food, though. About a third of the app got taken home, as well as half of both entrees. Got cheesecake to go, and it still tasted delicious for dinner that night."
Vanessa P.,"Manassas, VA",151,383,194,4.0,4/6/2009,"I love the variety in the menu. If you don't like several different choices, cos yes it is and can be overwhelming, then pick someone more focused on one type of cuisine to eat. Service here is always good, food always consistent. A tad on the pricey side. I've been here before simply to grab two slices of cheesecake and two coffees and it's ended up costing over $20... so order wisely. And as for the cheesecake, it is REALLY rich. Their other non-cheesecake desserts are just as good."
Sheila M.,"Fairfax, VA",2,2,,2.0,6/2/2012,"Food is great, but the hostess staff is rude, inefficient and short with guests. I expected more from such a typically wonderful chain."
Jessica J.,"Woodbridge, VA",4,14,,5.0,8/5/2012,We love it.  Always great food and service. There are tons of options so even picky eaters can find something.
Mireille C.,"Fairfax, VA",3,26,2,2.0,8/26/2009,"It's one great big ""eh."" Overpriced, certifiably franchised and only a step above Olive Garden. Actually, I take that back, I wouldn't hate on Olive Garden like that. Their menu is a novel. Any place that claims to be able to execute that many dishes probably doesn't do them all well. Whatever salad or chicken I've had there has been passable but certainly not for the price. I will say the service is good, if not aggressively helpful in that not necessarily sincere corporate way.  Would I come back here? Again. that's one great big EH. The drinks were pretty ok(yes, leave it to a true yelper to down three cocktails on a lunch during finals) but the rest of the place just...lacks.  The ceiling is unusually high for a mall restaurant, though and it really throws me off every time I go in."
Justin G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,165,130,4.0,2/20/2012,"It's a chain, so it's definitely not original.  Also, not horribly cheap, but they give you a ton of food.  Usually, my girlfriend and I will split a plate and a dessert (cause otherwise you won't have room for both).  Can't complain!"
Alicia R.,"Vienna, VA",35,158,3,5.0,1/15/2010,"I'm not usually willing to wait an hour for food. But for Cheesecake Factory I make an exception. (Keep in mind it's a saturday night)   I ordered the best dang strawberry lemonade you ever sucked up through a straw. I mean I went through at least 5 glasses it was so amazing. Then, my entree, the 4 cheese pasta. Mmmm. I hate basil but their is so fresh and sweet I ate it right up! I also had half leftover for the next day's meal.  My mom got Chicken farfalle or something. Came with mushrooms and it was really delicious too. My dad got some chicken breaded thing. Looked fabulous not that I got a bite. He ate is so fast! (I see you reading this dad, it's true!)   The drinks are really great here. Martinis are worth a try. I personally like the lemondrop a lot. And of course the cheesecake is amazing. I got the oreo mudslide and my dad the carrotcake cheesecake.  Our server was a sweetheart and VERY attentive. All in all, this place rocks my toesocks off."
Mitch R.,"Vienna, VA",80,258,132,4.0,5/8/2009,"Going to Cheesecake Factory (CF) has become a huge affair.  It seems that no matter when you get there, there will be a 30+ minute wait for a large party or even for two. Once you are seated you will be greeted by someone who is likely younger than you and doesn't really know how to wait tables. After you finish digesting the menu which might as well be a novel you will still be unsure of your decision because there are just too many choices. Whatever.  I have found my two staple dishes at CF. The Pasta Davinci and the Shrimp BLT. Both are fantastic and very filling. If you have never eaten at CF, their portions are comically large, so much so when I took my family there who is from Germany they said no wonder why Americans are so fat.  I tried their Cajun Jambalaya because I love Jambalaya. This was not Jambalaya, it was offensive.. This was pasta, with olive oil and simple dried Cajun seasoning mixed in. It was absolutely horrid. I think it was made wrong but the waitress (who was essentially a dumb highschooler) said that is how it is made.  Desserts at CF. Three words. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. My lord. It is the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth, it is so good that I get slightly aroused while consuming this delightful chocolate goodness. If you like chocolate, and don't try this, then shame on you.  This place should honestly be a 3 1/2 rating but the cheesecake saves it from a solid 3 stars. I hate the service, I don't want to watch some douche waiter who thinks he is hot shxt flirt with all the young girls while I am trying to eat. Please don't distract my waitress, let her serve my party. Thanks."
Mary G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,1,,5.0,9/24/2012,"One of my favorite place to dine! Atmosphere is perfect (however, they could light up that place a little bit more).  Prices are very affordable and you have a big selection to choose from the menu card. The food is very tasteful and they usually bring it out very quickly.  The starter bread is amazing, and you absolutely have to try it out!"
autumn h.,"Fairfax, VA",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2010,"Curbside service is a disaster.  I estimate that they get our order wrong about 50% of the time.  Either they forget to put utensils or condiments, or completely omit side items  I understand there's a lot of different components to their menu items, but this isn't rocket science.  If you order fish and chips, you expect the chips.  If you ask for ketchup, there should be ketchup in the bag.  For the price point, they need to get the order correct. The way management handles their mistakes also leaves a lot to be desired.  For example, the last time curbside made a mistake, the manager basically accused us of actually having the missing items.  Unless this constitutes acceptable behavior, their team needs some brushing up in the customer service department.  I reiterate: Don't order curbside unless you're comfortable with the fact that some part of your order is going to be wrong about 50% of the time, or you don't mind going back to fix a mistake."
Chris D.,"Fairfax, VA",17,280,114,4.0,5/4/2011,What can you say about Cheesecake Factory that isn't already known. The food is excellent and the prices are respectable. I don't think I even have to mention the amazing cheesecake. The staff here is excellent and I have never had a bad experience. If you're going at a popular time make sure to make reservations.
