Toy W.,"Burke, VA",1,37,,5.0,5/11/2012,"CF is the spot after a loong week. Love the fact they have a huge menu but hate it 'cause it will make you indecisive. Their portions are hella huge & their desserts are very rich. It just may take a couple of visits to find something you'll love! They are also pretty good on making ur entree catered to your wants or allergies,etc. Fridays-Sundays, expect to wait awhile."
Mark S.,"Fairfax, VA",184,681,73,4.0,6/23/2009,PROS: decent prices and the servings are quite large. the staff is very nice and friendly. the food is good and the menu is incredibly large CONS: i wish Cheesecake factory would accept reservations.. they do not take reservations. So sometimes during peak hours the wait can be up to 1 hour or so.  It's next to the Verizon Experience store.. so while you're waiting you can walk around since it is located inside Fair Oaks Mall.
Blake J.,"Washington, DC",107,146,2,4.0,12/29/2008,"Kind of expensive, but I love the atmosphere and the service is usually pretty good.  Everything I've had there has been good, my favorite being the their bacon cheeseburgers.. sooo good! Great place to go and just get coffee and dessert at night too, if you don't want to spend a ton on a meal and have a long wait."
Miguel C.,"Fairfax, VA",20,63,5,1.0,2/24/2009,"I've been here twice, once when it opened and a second time last night.  My problems with The Cheesecake Factory:  1- The menu is so long that it is too overwhelming.  2- Food is decent but nothing special, a little overpriced if you ask me.  3- Food takes forever, maybe it has to do with having a super long menu. You can't be good at every type of food....just focus on the cheesecakes.  4- The last time I was there I got really sick when I got home. I called the manager the next morning and he said, ""okay, sorry, thanks.""  5- The place is way too dark inside. Like someone else here said, it looks nice from the outside but inside it's dark. Yeah..try reading that 20+ page menu with that lighting. I'm no old timer here but come on!"
Patrick B.,"Sacramento, CA",62,270,60,4.0,8/10/2009,"Two words: Strawberry Cheesecake. There is nothing better at the Factory. It is incredibly difficult for me to dine here and not indulge in the goodness that is made from heavy cream, cream cheese, eggs and egg yolks and covered in strawberries.  But like any dedicated Yelper/Foodie, I need to watch my calories. So, if I am going to eat Cheesecake for desert, I order the Weight Management Spicy Chicken Salad for dinner. This absolutely great salad contains: grilled chicken, roasted poblano, red and yellow peppers, fresh corn, black beans, onions, rice and cilantro and is served over mixed greens with a tasty low-calorie spicy vinaigrette. It is so good, huge and less than 590 calories!  If you do have a calorie rich dinner, try the Low Carb Cheesecake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream sweetened with Splenda. Its not bad and you feel better about yourself. One final observation. The menu is too long. My general rule is to avoid joints with ""be everything to everyone"" menus.  But, this place is generally a good choice."
kates h.,"Burke, VA",0,9,,4.0,12/20/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my ""comfort"" restaurants.  If I get hungry while I'm shopping at  Fair Oaks mall, I don't hesitate to stop by the restaurant to have my usual, the Luau chicken salad.  I love their fresh, warm bread as well as their passion fruit iced tea."
Bill J.,"Chantilly, VA",0,2,,2.0,8/3/2012,"Went here with my fiance a recently and didn't have a fun experience. The service was slow. I felt like the waiter didn't care for us much. The food was okay, no major compliment however, please brush up on service guys!"
Anson P.,"Greenville, SC",0,855,3,4.0,10/12/2008,"Remember those middle school and high school days where you could easily impress a girl with taking her to a mall restaurant.  ""Yo baby girl, let's go to Cheesecake Factory before the dance, it's on me.  And my dad will drive us there.""  As an adult, if you were to try that, you get the ""are you kidding me, you uncreative lazy jerk"" look.  It is a look I am all too familiar with. I always order the bbq chicken salad.  It's a pretty big salad with a good mix of bbq sauce and ranch dressing.  I like it, that's all that matters.  My girlfriend got a salmon salad which was pretty decent.  She liked the tartness of the vinaigrette.  We also had the guacamole which was decent, especially considering I was expecting crap.  We finished off the meal with a slice of pumpkin pecan cheesecake.  It tasted like pecan pie with some pumpkin topping on it.  It did not resemble a cheesecake, but it was still pretty tasty.  Now come on, we're not talking gourmet, we're talking Cheesecake Factory.  If you walk into Cheesecake factory expecting an awe-inspiring meal, you'll be incredibly disappointed.  The decor, the manner in which the waiters are dressed, are all part of the gimmick.  You can pretty much expect middle schoolers and high schoolers eating here.  You can expect families coming here and letting their kids run around.  In spite of all this, I still like Cheesecake Factory.  Also, it never fails that you will have at least a 30 minute wait at any CF that you go to. I can see myself going back here as uninspired as I am.  You just gotta go in expecting mall food, and you'll be satisfied."
Carly C.,"Seaside, CA",6,98,15,5.0,8/26/2011,"I just wanted to post that their new skinny menu is delish! My favorites so far are their samosas, white bean and chicken chili and the spicey chicken salad."
John M.,"Bonifay, FL",0,36,,5.0,5/8/2012,My first visit to a Cheescake Factory restaurant.  The service and decor like the food is outstanding.  Moderately priced.  Generous servings.  Great meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The chicken marsala and chicken & dumplings are good too.  I don't eat cheescake but they have other baked goodies for dessert.
Chris S.,"Philadelphia, PA",169,234,106,2.0,7/15/2009,"Over spiced and overpriced. With each entree weighing in at an average of $15 and waiting times (To get seated and to drink some water) are longer than originally stated by hosts, this place is an easy miss in yuppy Fair Oaks/Fair Lakes area. Usually at a restaurant this expensive, you get treated like royalty or at least close to it. But I guess in an area as wealthy as Fairfax County, Cheesecake Factory in Fair Oaks Mall is used to seeing money bags.  On to the food! I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The dish was  smothered with an abundance of Creole and bottomed with grease. I soon could not see my bowl after 9pm because they dim the lights darker than PF Changs.  In the midst of all this, our server was taking a lengthened amount of time. When I had just taken down about 50% down of my humongous Louisana pasta, the server was already passing out Cheesecake menus. Their outsourced cheesecakes are another story all together..."
Dustin S.,"Herndon, VA",3,11,1,1.0,10/21/2010,"I don't get it, this place sucks. Rather than doing a few things well, Cheesecake Factory decided to do 9 million things poorly. I've been here at least 3 times and have never had a good experience. Two times that I can remember, my order has been messed up. One of those times I ordered the Shepards Pie with no mushrooms, only to be told that they couldn't take out the mushrooms bc it was pre-made. That was about all I needed to hear. Don't fall for the fancy, over the top atmosphere and menu- they're only there to distract you from the crap food."
Matthew C.,"Churchville, PA",2,16,,4.0,1/27/2012,"It is the cheesecake factory, of course it is good.  The only reason I can assume that you are reading this is that you have a 5 hour wait like we always do."
Foodie 4 F.,"Fairfax, VA",0,22,,1.0,7/26/2010,"The first time we went to the Cheesecake factoy we were amazed at the huge size of the dishes. The second (and last time) we went, we realized that we did not like the food.  It tasted ok, but we did not feel fine after eating there.  We felt polluted with an overdose of salt and processed food.   After seeing specials on the news on TV we understand why we do not like this restaurant.  The dishes are super fattening and not healthy at all."
Valencia W.,"Annandale, VA",102,782,8,3.0,12/30/2010,"I decided I wanted to eat at the Cheesecake Factory because I had been sick for the past few days and wanted to start off eating ""real"" food at the Cheesecake factory with Gift Card's I had received.  I've been going to the Factory both here and at Friendship Heights for years so I'm finally getting around to reviewing our experiences at this location.  For some reason the night we decided to go was when the rest of Virginia decided to go as well.  The wait was an hour and we realized this isn't a bad thing as it is inside Fair Oaks Mall.  The bad thing is that this means with an hour at the mall--I'll probably come back with at least one bag and I did.  Once we were seated I noticed I had to step over some food on the floor.  It was dirty and yes, there were kids all over the place but still, the amount of food on floor was ridiculous and there were napkins as well.  One of a few things need to be done--parent's watch after your kids, I mean kids and be kids but keep that food on the table.  The other thing that can be done is for the restaurant to sweep it up.  Now, once we sat down our server was very prompt--too prompt I'll have to say and was rushing us.  My fiance had just got back from the bathroom and the next thing you know she was asking us if we were ready to order.  We said no we'd like more time.  My idea for more time meant more than 5 minutes but 2 minutes later ""Are you ready to order"".  I think my fiance felt rushed and he just settled for something that sounded good.  I had the Chicken Madeira (my favorite) and we waited.  We didn't wait for too long as our food came out.  One thing I noticed was that there were entirely too many mushrooms on my chicken madeira.  I like mushrooms but they should've spent more time and had more cheese put on the chicken and more asparagus.  Overall, the food was good and I was glad we had the gift card.  Next time, I hope we have a better waiter--one that doesn't rush us.  Secondly, next time lets hope my food can turn out like it has previous times.  I'd go again, and maybe we'll get a new waitress and awesome food instead of OK food"
Parvez K.,"Herndon, VA",233,95,165,5.0,1/18/2011,"Always par excellence in service, selection, availability, and quality.  Nothing beats them in DC."
Tuan N.,"South Riding, VA",13,561,1,4.0,6/21/2011,"Nice decor, great food and portions"
Alexandra E.,"Manassas, VA",1,115,47,4.0,7/5/2012,"This restaurant has been consistently delicious at many different locations. Their menu is phenomenal, consisting of everything from seafood to Mexican to Asian to burgers. It's like 20 pages long- no joke. Today, I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas (corn tortillas with chicken and tomatillo sauce, served with corn cakes, black beans and sour cream). I've had them before and they are scrumptious. My mom ordered a burger which was cooked to perfection. The french fries are mouth-watering. The service always seems to be good and the food is out in no time. The burger was $12 and the tortillas were $14. In the past, I've had the enchiladas (not good), a burger (always juicy), and a combination of their lunch specials (all good). The Lemoncello cake is moist and refreshing and the Kahlua Cheesecake is truly delicious. The cheesecakes themselves don't seem to be that special. The portions at this restaurant are HUGE- so come hungry! Oh and one more thing- I don't know if it's just me, but their tile floors throughout the restaurant are super slippery. Wearing high heels and walking to the bathroom seems impossible, so come wearing comfortable flats with grips on the bottom!"
CYNTHIA C.,"Alexandria, VA",78,186,4,4.0,1/30/2011,"I have always loved The Cheesecake Factory but for whatever reason, I never made the effort to visit the Fairfax location.  The server was awesome.  I can't remember his name but he was great from the second I sat down.  My daughter found a calamari in her buffalo fingers and that totally grossed her out to the point of her not wanting to eat the rest of her chicken.  I mentioned to the server that we found calamari in the dish and he was very apologetic about it and gave her a brand new batch.  The manager also came by to apologize.  It wouldn't  have been a big deal had it not been that my daughter absolutely HATES seafood.  The server and manager went out of their way to make sure we were happy with our dining experience and indeed we were!  Definitely going back!!!"
Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",165,1240,162,5.0,5/16/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  I understand the whole issue with chain restaurants, blah blah blah, but I just love this place.  I think it is the best chain restaurant around and they have hit a goldmine with the concept.  I can't even tell you how much I love the avocado egg rolls, the chinese chicken salad (or whatever it is called), the eggplant and portabello sandwich, and every single one of the cheesecakes.  Under normal circumstances I really hate cheesecake but some of these you just can't resist.  However, I am usually way too full from the portion sizes at CF to even consider dessert.  In my mind that is a successful dining experience.  I leave CF completely satisfied and happy and full of wonderfulness.  I give this place five stars not because it is a five star restaurant really but just to kind of up the rankings of CF on yelp.  Go CF!!!"
