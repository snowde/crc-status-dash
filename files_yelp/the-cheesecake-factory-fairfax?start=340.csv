Jay T.,"Herndon, VA",0,31,,4.0,10/23/2013,"Nice lunch place, but if you don't get a booth you feel like you are sitting with the people at the next table.  Love the food and cheesecake, so maybe that makes up for the tight quarters."
Jeff W.,"Falls Church, VA",192,532,3,2.0,9/5/2007,"Just got back from my first Cheesecake Factory experience and I wasn't impressed but wasn't offended either.  The first thing that I thought was odd was that the place has a very grand, open presentation to it but had these cheap little plastic drink mugs and a menu that read like a diner.  Not to mention a very average basket of bread.  The menu is actually too diverse, erasing any identity it was hoping to establish for itself.   Before even trying the food I felt like they were trying to pull the wool over my eyes by having such an elegant atmosphere and the waiters in their tuxedo shirts.  I really felt like I was supposed to be so wowed by the scenery that I wouldn't pay attention to the food.  Well once the food did arrive, my suspicions were correct.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't special.  The prices weren't as outrageous as I had been preparing myself for but the portions were large.  Salt seems to be the favorite ingredient, maybe so that the sweetness of their cheesecakes stands out?? Speaking of cheesecake, I couldn't leave without trying a piece.  Normally content with just plain, undoctored cheesecake I decided to be adventurous and try the tiramisu cheesecake.  It really only resembled cheesecake in shape.  Way too light and wet for cheesecake and pretty much tasted like a piece of tiramisu, which probably wasn't the objective. Anyway, I have no reason to go back but I really don't have any hatred towards this place.  I didn't feel cheated or taken advantage of; just apathetic towards the entire experience."
Ryan I.,"Fairfax, VA",22,22,,2.0,10/15/2007,"This is actually the only Cheesecake Factory I have had a bad experience with. Went on my birthday and got the grilled salmon lunch special, which I'd gotten a few times in the past at other CF's. Sadly it was undercooked. At first I figured ""whatever, I eat sushi"". But as I ate a bit further, it just plain got disgusting. I ended up feeling sick to my stomach for most of that day and the next. They took the fish off my check, but the (figurative) bad taste still lingers.  Otherwise, there's not much that's more special about this Cheesecake Factory over any of the others. I've been to the one in Tyson's many times, and prefer that one over this one."
Milo R.,"Dover, NH",0,206,55,4.0,2/26/2011,"Awesome service, great pizza (Four Seasons), awesome cheese cake (lemon chello).  This was a great pick for dinner tonight, good things do happen when your power goes out at home. This visit was way better than last time."
Joseph G.,"Burke, VA",2,70,,2.0,2/11/2013,ok so the food is horrible but yes the cheesecakes are really really good. unless you want a bathroom adventure all night avoid the gross food. and eat the cheesecakes only
Jennifer L.,"Centreville, VA",0,4,,1.0,7/25/2011,"My friend wanted to go there for her birthday, so we all went there to celebrate it with her. The wait was an hour long, so we went to the bar to get some drinks while waiting. The bartender took a long time to even acknowledge us, and when he did he was unfriendly. The drinks were $12 and they were not strong at all, almost no alcohol was in them. Luckily we got seated in like 45 minutes, we were starving and ready to eat. We waited at our table for like 7 minutes, but no server greeted us. We had to get the attention of someone that was passing by to get some drinks.  Our server comes back like 10 minutes later with our drinks and bread. The bread was cold, but we were starving so we eat it anyway. It took another 10 minutes for the server to come get our order. We tried to make the best of it since we had a lot of time to talk to each other and were enjoying the time together.  The food came out 30 minutes later and was luke-warm. We had finished our drinks, but the server did not even come to take any drink orders. My friend is allergic to shellfish and asked for the Jambalaya with only chicken and no shrimp. She was about to eat it until she saw there was shrimp in it. We tried to get the servers attention, but with no avail. She was too hungry that she just ate some of our food. The one thing good about Cheesecake is their big portions. But the pasta I had was pretty salty. I think the pasta water they use has a lot of salt in them. The burger came out too well cooked, but we just kept eating since we doubted the server would help us. We didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for a burger to come out.  The cheesecakes we ordered were pretty good but the server took a long time to bring it out too. The coffee he gave us was pretty cold. Everything we had was luke-warm at this restaurant, very disappointed in the quality of food and service here."
Scott L.,"Purcellville, VA",1,41,,4.0,12/28/2010,"Ate  lunch here today and had a really  good experience. We got there early so no waiting, always nice. I had a grilled cheese with fries, not too tough for anybody to make but they did it well and the fries were hot and done just right. Oh my god that sandwich is BIG.  Surprise surprise, you could say my wife is the pickier eater,  and she loved the fries and ate most of them. The mrs ordered some salad and enjoyed it but said there was alot of noodle ""hair"" on it.  Our server ( Laura? Lauren? Sorry I forget)  was great. She got our one year old a side of peas even though it's not on the menu as a side. Nice lunch all around today, thanks Cheesecake Factory."
Josh Y.,"Fairfax, VA",4,48,24,4.0,1/26/2010,"01/14/2010, Thursday, dinner Cheesecake always gave me an impression of flashy decoration, average service, ok food and up scaled prices. Therefore, I never cared to write a review about this restaurant, even I have dined there on several occasions involuntarily. Until this experience, I thought that it's about time for a review. It's about 6:30pm, still early. We got our table right away. No waiting line sounds more like a miracle at Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was, in general, friendly, attentive, professional and knowledgeable about their food. All my friends ordered soft drink, I was the only one having water. They got their drink filled up all the time without requesting. But I had to ask for more water almost the entire meal. That's the only ""nit picking"" I could come up with about her service. 3.5 stars. I was not quite hungry that night and only wanted something light. So, I picked Seared Tuna Tataki Salad as my entrée. This is a quote from their menu, ""Pacific Albacore Tuna Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette."" Tuna was fresh, lightly seared, thickly sliced and presented beautifully. It literally melted in my mouth. The menu should have also mentioned about the sauce on top of tuna and avocado and tomato. If I am not mistaken, that sauce consists of finely chopped ginger, green onion, hot pepper with light soy sauce and a hint of sesame seed oil. Saltiness, spiciness, and different aroma were all well balanced. That sauce made this entire dish stand out. Now, to the mixed greens, I could taste the freshness and the crunchiness from every single bite of that mix greens. The Wasabi Vinaigrette dressing had a touch of sweetness from balsamic vinegar and a tangy bite from wasabi. The mixed greens were a perfect companion to the main character, albacore tuna. Of course, what can go wrong with fresh avocado and tomato. This dish is a great example of ""East Meets West"". 5 stars. My dessert was to share a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, ""Layers of Flourless Godiva Chocolate Cake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse."" Each layer has its own distinct taste. And yet when you combine them together, you just can't stop taking the next bite. What can I say, I like both chocolate and cheesecake. This is just another great combination. Well, a little bit on the sweet side though. 4 stars. Grand total: 4 stars."
Shevonne P.,"Fairfax, VA",168,139,4,4.0,2/27/2010,"I never have a bad time when I visit one of the Cheesecake Factories.  I went with my children, parents, grandmother, and aunt yesterday.  We started off with Thai Lettuce Wraps and Calamari, which was NOM.  After that, some had Shrimp with Pasta, Chicken Strips, and I had the Tuna Tataki Salad (my fave). The waiter was very attentive, and we never had to wait around for drinks or our food.  As always, two thumbs up."
Adri T.,"Wake Forest, NC",80,258,768,4.0,11/11/2009,"Typical Cheesecake Factory located in Fair Oaks mall in Fairfax.  The wait was not too terribly long for a Sunday night (15 minutes at 7pm). We were seated as soon as our buzzer went off and taken to our booth. Their booths are much more spacious and enjoyable over their half booth/half free seaters where you have to get too close for comfort with some stranger. Happy about the ""private"" booth, we sat down and began to peruse the mini novella of a menu. Since we'd all dined at a CcF before, we really did not need as long as we were given to make a drink selection before the waitress arrived. When she finally did arrive we offered up our selections and they were quickly returned. All beverages were well maintained throughout the meal and we had no issues here. Food selections were customized from the menu and everyone's special requests were adhered to. I always order the Thai Lettuce Wraps for an entree. They are artfully displayed on the plate and taste as good as they look. My only suggestion would be that they serve them with wet naps, since I needed one when I was done with this messy build your own wrap meal. Most people had enough food to take home and make another meal, which justifies the prices at this place. Check was split as we requested and no grumpy server when we tossed out three separate credit cards. We all ordered cheesecake to go and were disappointed to find no plastic ware or napkins were given in the to go bags (especially since we were going to be consuming this in a hotel room). Other than this tiny snafu, we had no issues.  I always find what I order to be consistently delish, and the service to be cheerful, attentive, and on point."
Edik Z.,"Schenectady, NY",0,13,2,2.0,12/10/2012,"Went there for a quick bite on Sunday. Kind of late lunch.  Problem one - they set at least two parties of people with the similar makeup before us - both parties came in later than we did. When pointed that out to the hostess, she kind of shrugged it off, like things happen, as long as they don't happen to her, it's Ok.  Problem two - went to the table and the table was dirty, the seat on which I was supposed to land was both dirty and wet. When pointed that out to the hostess - she kind of shrugged it off, like things happen, and disappeared into the abyss to find a bus-boy with a rug. She was above the menial things.  Problem three - the manager. He utterly incapable of running this ship, but compensated his ineptitude and that of his staff, by a well-practiced ""I am so sorry"" speech. He had it down pat, he was sorry for the wait, he was sorry for the dirt, he was sorry for being sorry, he was so sorry that even NOT offered to pay for the drinks (consisting of coke and water) or for deserts, or even one dish. He then took his sorry excuse for a manager and disappeared so I could show him the dirty silverware. But it's Ok, and I am fairly confident he would've been sorry about that too.  The waitress was nice and prompt, I guess the fact that she showed up in the middle of me ripping the new one to the manager helped, and the food was good. But the overall experience was ruined, by the sorry bunch of the inept uncaring morons supposedly representing the face of the restaurant."
Wally Z.,"Fairfax, VA",0,6,,1.0,3/10/2013,"We decided to finally write this review now because these past few days we've been looking for a nice place to celebrate a special event and as we were looking through Yelp's reviews for nearby restaurants, we came across the Cheesecake Factory. It surprised us greatly that the reviews for this place were so high! So, we decided to write exactly what this place is about. We visited this restaurant several months ago, more specifically the first week of September 2012. It was not our lucky day. Overall, the food and service was horrible. At the beginning, we ordered sodas and a strawberry lemonade. The young waitress completly forgot about the lemonade. We reminded her in 25 minutes and she finally served it.  We then ordered the most expensive dish--filet minion. The wait time was very long. When we were served the food, it was just the meat-- no side dishes and we were told that it will be a bit longer. Nobody served us the side dish, however, until we reminded them after 20 minutes of waiting. The filet minion we got was horrible: it was very thick and it looks like it was a cheap piece of meat just tenderized like a meat chop and there were a lot of chewy pieces that could hardly be chewed so we couldn't eat  it at all. We were very disapointed and left this restaurant hungry and feeling neglected by our waitress. We decided never to come back to this place."
Dean L.,"Centreville, VA",43,13,6,4.0,5/26/2010,"Been coming to this location for a few years now and is Never dissappointed when coming.  The first experience was the most memorable because the restaurant manager was making his rounds and asked us how our meal was..... we told him it was ehhhh..... so he gave us a whole new round of meals after we told him.... That completely blew our minds, then he also gave a round of alcohol on the house....  Ever since then, we've been coming here for all special occasions and ALWAYS EAT AND LEAVE with a BANNANA CREME CHEESECAKE there.  ITS OFF THE CHAIN!!!!"
Kris P.,"Springfield, VA",0,5,,1.0,8/22/2014,"I typically have a decent dining experience at the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Fair Oaks location in the past, but this was my first time dining alone there. I had a 20 min wait before being seated which is to be expected from this establishment. First, there was a wait on the bread that is brought to the table before your meal. I ordered the turkey burger sandwich with fries. When my burger arrived I took a bite to find a piece of paper inside my burger. I immediately told the waitress, who didn't seem that alarmed. I had to instruct her to take it back for a new order. She asked if I would like a salad or soup while I waited. I declined and chose to eat my fries while waiting. The manager came by and apologized, but did not offer to comp my meal. I've dined at smaller chain restaurants and if I found something wrong or out of place, the meal was comped immediately. Not impressed with the service and doubtful on returning to this location."
Leila N.,"Manassas, VA",6,17,3,2.0,9/29/2009,"Meh. I've been to this location three or four times now. I remember when I used to be awed by Cheesecake Factory. Now it just feels gaudy. The menu is enormous, and for that reason, I think the quality of the food and speed of service suffers. I usually end up waiting about half an hour for my food. The server always offers bread, and the bread always gets to the table about twenty minutes later. The food is hit-or-miss. The roasted veggie pizza was great, but the spicy chicken salad was downright disappointing. Very skimpy on the veggies to be mixed in with the mountain of lettuce, and the chicken had most definitely been sandbagged, so not sure why it took half an hour! It was dry and chewy and nasty. The cheesecake is always good, but it seems like the average slice has gotten smaller over the years. For $7 a pop, you'd better hook it up. The entree portions are large, but overall I'd say this place is overpriced and overrated. I'd throw in another star if I knew for sure that I could get a good meal out of this place, but Cheesecake is going to have to step it up to earn my trust again."
Eliot F.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,22,,2.0,10/18/2011,A national chain that most people are familiar with.  We generally enjoy eating here but the fair oaks mall location is the most poorly managed one we have found.  We arrived at 6:10pm last Sunday to eat dinner.  We were told the wait was 40 minutes and we were prepared for that.  It actually took and hour before we were seated but then it took one more hour before our food arrived.  This is the second time this has happened to us at this location.  Totally unacceptable.  This is a publicly held company.  All they care about is profit.  Since this is a popular location I imagine that headquarters thinks the place is well run.. Guess again
Janet M.,"Fairfax, VA",3,9,,5.0,8/11/2010,"I was at the mall trying to kill some time before an appointment.  To be fair, I was only going in for glass of wine and a slice of cheesecake.  Their crazy $5 Happy Hour menu distracted me!  Needless to say, I ended up trying the Mojito, the fried mac n cheese, and the crab wontons instead.  Huge portions, and the drink was tasty.  I hope I am in the area again sometime soon!  Great food, great price."
Fred H.,"McLean, VA",117,12,,1.0,3/4/2011,"Most insulting service ever - went with the family and asked if they had crayons for the children.  Was told they ""were not that kind of restaurant"" and they were ""high end.""  Really?  You offer a children's menu and seat families.  Even after I expressed how bothered I was, the server did not alert the manager and we had to find him ourselves.  Congrats on losing a customer.  Might want to focus on customer service versus turning tables and pushing dessert."
Anne F.,"Lanham, MD",17,66,,5.0,3/11/2012,"I absolutely LOVE cheesecake factory, and not for the cheesecake lol! For more than 10 years we have been visiting the ckf and have never been disatisfied with an entree - even new ones we had ordered for the first time. I love to get the Spicy Jamaican shrimp and chicken, but I usually omit the chicken and get a double order of shrimp. The food is consistently good. I'm not much of a cheescake fan for the price and the extra pounds, however The Cheesecake Factory does every RIGHT in my book!"
Yvonne A.,"Fairfax, VA",26,51,34,5.0,1/20/2012,"the food exellent, and  the white chocolate cheesecake with macadamia nuts and caramel was amazing!!!!"
