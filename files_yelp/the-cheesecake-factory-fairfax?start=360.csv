Mary P.,"Occoquan, VA",9,178,87,4.0,11/15/2011,"A group of us went to The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Saturday night. I've been to this location several times before and while the food and service is always good, I encountered GREAT service. We had an hour wait so we had to stand for awhile (they need more indoor seating in the waiting area). When we were seated we were greeted by the friendliest waitress (Casey V.). She was awesome because one grumpy hungry man in our party kinda rushed her introduction because we were starving and he wanted to place our orders with our drink orders and she was so calm and friendly. (Yes we grilled Mr. Grumpy and reminded him it isn't our waitress' fault we had an hour wait). When we received our food, I received the wrong order and automatically the manager came to the table, took care of the problem both he and the waitress were apologetic although I told them I understand it was a simple mistake. When I did get my food, which didn't take long...it was super YUMMY!!! We had a great time and our waitress had a wonderful personality. Next time I go back I'm going to request her."
Jennifer N.,"McKinney, TX",0,27,,3.0,5/23/2012,"If you are in to loud, crowded restaurants serving mammoth portions of fat ladened carb-loaded entrees, this is the place for you. The food is good - Not great, but good. Even an appetizer portion is more than enough to share...the Duggars could do well here - order a few apps and feed the whole dang crowd! The wait is LONG and once seated, the menu is as daunting as War and Peace. The drinks are ridiculously expensive. I think my money is better spent elsewhere. Oh, and their beepers don't pick up a signal past the doorway, so if you are waiting for a table, you are trapped there. No shopping while waiting. I would return if there were no other options due to the wait and the crowd.  I just don't eat enough to get my money's worth."
Desiree M.,"Clifton, VA",15,55,15,3.0,1/29/2011,First time to a Cheesecake Factory. We arrived after a movie around 4:30 and had a 30 minute wait. on a Saturday night. that was completely acceptable. Our waiter was ok. He was patient with the kids but I didnt think he really knew the menu that well. When it came time for desert he brought it in a TO_GO box... he thought he heard us say we wanted it to - go. I had the Thai Chicken Wraps - which is an app. but i had as a meal - it was great. My son did not like the mac n cheese he said it wasnt cheesy and when I tasted - it tasted just like noodles with watered down cheese. I asked if he could comp us on that - as we didnt want to take it home and it wasnt worth waiting for something else. He was able to do that. I would be interested in coming here again - especially when their drinks are 5 instead of 10 plus.... My husband liked his meal as well as the other kids. Ill go back! but I hope we have a better waiter next time... we got there too early for him to be off his game.
AL K.,"Fairfax, VA",167,1127,1578,4.0,4/22/2009,the cheesecake tiramisu is a must!!!!
Nancy H.,"Centreville, VA",0,8,,3.0,3/19/2009,"I had high expectations for this restaurant because I have heard people speak of it with high praise.  I don't think this restaurant lives up to its hype--but it's pretty good.  The service was okay--a little bit of disappearing waiter issue--but I don't think that's a typical problem, as I saw other tables being served well.  The food was good, but didn't blow me away.  The cheesecake was yummy, but it would have to be..  I will probably go back, but I'm not in any particular rush."
Alicia T.,"Fairfax, VA",5,11,,3.0,7/20/2009,"Let me start by saying, I'm generally not a fan of Cheesecake Factory (previous experiences have yielded long waits, poor service, bad food) BUT....  After having lunch at the Fair Oaks location over the weekend, I have a new found respect for this restaurant. We were seated immediately, served water and bread within 2 minutes of sitting and had a wonderful, attentive waitress. We ordered the white pizza (which although our waitress said was enough for one person...was huge!) and the fish tacos (again...a huge meal!) Both were delicious and I would absolutely order them again.  My only complaint was the tables are so small, we had very little room for our plates and drinks, and the tables are very close together, so close that a waiter knocked our bread basket on the floor as he tried to serve another table.  Overall good food, good service, still overpriced."
Tracy O.,"Haymarket, VA",0,60,,3.0,11/1/2011,I love the Cheesecake Factory.  Of course their cheesecake is amazing and their food portions are huge.  However depending on the wait time ...you can wait for a long time just to get a seat.
Melinda C.,"San Francisco, CA",15,560,,4.0,11/29/2008,We were in Fairfax on business and ate here twice in a row ... by choice.  I won't even lie - I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory.  You always know there's something that you will like.  I love my Chicken enchiladas (they're called something else on the menu but they are basically enchiladas) and my morning sunrise burrito.  Yum yum yum.
Michael R.,"Haymarket, VA",0,13,,2.0,7/24/2012,"Somebody needs to explain this place to me.  You can get a better burger at Five Guys, a better plate of pasta at Pizza Hut, a better steak at Steak n' Shake, a better taco at Taco Bell, a better omelette at Denny's, and a better eggroll at Panda Express.  My point is, this place tries to do everything but does none of it well.  They are definitely into quantity, not quality.  It is basically a diner dressed up a little, with their prices jacked up a lot!  If you want a huge plate of expensive food that is about the same caliber of a Denny's, then go for it.  Be careful when you pick up your cheap plastic mug of water in the beginning.  The place appears slightly fancy because of the building structure and high ceilings, so you kind of expect a ""glass"" and expect it to be heavy like a glass mug would be.  Not here, here it is cafeteria style plastic mugs.  Wait staff is friendly, but look more like orderlies in a hospital with there head to toe white outfits.  Well, I have to go use the restroom as I usually do about 15 minutes after I eat here.  Never again!"
Susan T.,"Gainesville, VA",0,4,,2.0,9/12/2013,"Just visited the ""factory""  for lunch with my sister. Orderd our favorite appetizer to share that we always get. The first bite tasted ok but by the second bite we knew something was off.  The appt comes in three. We both decided we did not want any more of it so we sent the third one back. We explained to the waiter that we have had the appetizer at least a dozen times before and there was definitely something wrong with this one. He offered us another one but we declined and said we'd just have our salads. Even they were off. The manager came over and asked about our meal and we told him about the appetizer never mentioning that the whole meal was off. We Never asked for anything to be taken off. We have had many great meals there but I have to say we were both very insulted when the server brought us our check and said they had taken something off because of the appetizer. We thought ""oh isn't that nice"" until we saw the bill. They took off $3 for the 1/3 of the appetizer returned and charged us for the other 2/3 that we had tried to eat. I wish they had just not bothered. A restaurant that really wants to keep their customers coming back would make it right and would never insult their customers. I know which restaurants they are and they will get my business from now on."
Random D.,"Herndon, VA",6,122,1,4.0,9/10/2007,"Went to cheesecake factory on a Friday night - I reached there about 11:30 PM ( they close at 12:30 AM on fridays). I had been there at least a few times before (mostly at the bar which I should say is pretty well stocked and is well presented). The place still looks new. At the time I went there were hardly any folks there. We got ourself seated outside.  We are mostly there for some drinks and finger food. Being a vegetarian (ok an ovo-lacto vegetarian!), my choices are fairly straight. Ordered the Avocado Egg Roll and the Lettuce rolls (sans the chicken satay) along with a few house drinks.  The service was pretty good. I have always thought that the waiters at the Cheesecake factory are very professional (even though food may sometime show up late) and this one was the same as well.  The drinks and food showed up fairly quickly (since the place was almost closing) along with the drinks.   Food was pretty decent and nothing out of the ordinary. Ordered a Strawberry Cheesecake -fairly standard fare.  I recommend this Cheesecake factory for folks that want to get together for a few drinks and some light food."
Amy B.,"Fairfax, VA",2,54,,4.0,4/14/2010,"I have been here several times and it is pretty much the same as any other ccf..Big portions, good food..I love the Monte Cristo. I also love the BBQ chicken salad. The Lunch deals are good, you can get alot of food for very cheap. I have had a ton of stuff on the menu, and have never been really disapointed. And of course all the cheesecake is yummmy..except I had the peanut butter once and can remember it being a little too rich for me."
Reginald T.,"Washington, DC",15,52,,4.0,2/10/2009,"Went to the mall and decided we needed a little lunch so headed to the Cheesecake Factory. Been here once before for lunch and has a good experience on the patio. Little cold for that but headed in. Our waitress was nice and pleasant and very knowledgeable about the food and specials. We opted to go with the lunch specials as we did on our first visit. This time around I had the Salisbury Steak. I was very excited because I haven't had Salisbury steak since I was a kid eating TV dinners with pops. Our food took awhile, which seemed like forever because we were trying to make a movie at Fairfax-de-lux. I do fin it somewhat annoying when the server says it will be right out and does arrive for another 10 minutes. This is just a ploy to calm you down a bit. Usually the food does come out immediately afterwards but not this time. I was oK b/c we still had time for the movie. Food finally arrived and it was well worth the wait. Salisbury steak but the improved version of dads microwave version. Don't tell him that hush hush. My dish came with mashed potatoes and green beans and of course I had plenty of left overs b/c as you all may know whose been there, they have large portions. Love leftovers from the Cheesecake Factory."
Christina J.,"Burke, VA",0,11,,2.0,4/28/2008,"LIke all cheesecake factories, and (most) corporate owned chain restaurantes, CF is just mediocre.  Not great, not bad, and definitely don't get their salads.  With a menu as ridiculously expansive as theirs, it's difficult to get quality food, IMO.  I don't think I'd come here on my own unless I needed a quick bite to eat, or if friends wanted to come here. Service is hit or miss."
Deidra B.,"Fairfax, VA",0,38,,2.0,1/18/2009,"We had a great experience at a Cheesecake Factory in MD so we figured we'd really like this place too. We were sorely disappointed. First: the wait. It seems like every teenager in Fairfax goes here (maybe because it's in a mall?). After finally being seated, it took forever for our waitress to take our order. Then my friend received her dinner and the waitress noticed I hadn't received my order after about 20 minutes. She apologized but never brought my dinner! Finally after sitting there for 45 minutes I just asked for an appetizer (I don't remember what it was). Oddly it tasted like peanuts. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth. After a year I went back (recently) and found that the wait was the same and although I actually received my order in a timely manner, the service was unfriendly and inattentive. And the food was nothing to remember. I won't be going back."
Michelle C.,"Centreville, VA",0,15,,3.0,1/29/2009,"Spurred on by a $25 gift certificate we received for Christmas we decided to give them a try one recent Sunday night.  The restaurant is amazing.  Unfortunately, most of Fair Oaks mall restaurants look and taste the same.  And while Cheesecake Factory is a chain, it is definitely a step up for this particular mall.  They were busy, but fortunately no wait when we arrived at 7pm.   The menu is a bit over the top with all the choices.  Overwhelmingly so.  And when I asked our fabulous server what she recommended, she pointed out at least a dozen things and would have kept going had I not told her that was certainly enough to think about.  That said, they seem to offer a lot of the same cuts and main ingredients with a few different sauces or cuts.  I eventually chose a chicken dish from the special menu.  I have a hard time paying $15 for an a La carte pasta dish from the best of places and what was so special about the special menu was that it was a few bucks cheaper.  That said, it still cost $13.  It was a huge portion (I can see why American waistlines are so big looking at their portion sizes!).  I can't remember the name of the dish, but it was a thai chicken type dish.  I was impressed by the fresh ginger which really came through in the dish.  My husband had a new orleans-y pasta dish with chicken that was so-so.  Again, huge portion, but not so big on flavor.  The chicken was fried/crisp and pretty bland.  I thought a spicy cajun sauce would have perked it up, but not so much.  He enjoyed it though.  They don't have a kids menu, but the server said they have several kid sized options- sliders, pasta, etc.  My son chose the sliders with cheese and fries. Which were good but not great. You can imagine my horrified suprise when the bill came and I found that my son's meal cost $9.50  before tax.   Overall, the service was great- glasses never empty, food served at the proper temp, checked on the appropriate number of times, etc. Our $25 gift card didn't go very far, and it isn't the type of place we'd visit every weekend for our family ""date"", but it was definitely a good experience. Though, they really need to re-think their children's offerings."
Kevin J.,"Washington, DC",22,255,,3.0,1/12/2009,"Essentially Cheesecake factory is a giant cafeteria in disguise. I really want to give this place four stars but nothing has blown me away. They have excellent salads but the look and size of them has been more impressive than the actual taste. This is a very strong 3 stars (would give 3.5 if possible). Service has always been great for the most part Breakfast: have had their breakfast burrito and a few other breakfast platters, all of which I was not so impressed with. Don't get me wrong, everything was pretty good but that about it. Fortunately there breakfast is pretty reasonably priced and when it's nice outside they usually have ample outside seating if you eat late on the weekend like I do (11-12ish). Good coffee, nothing mind blowing. Overall breakfast here is worth it if you close by, a good value and good quality food. Dinner and appetizers: The guacamole is a total rip, skip it. Tostada salad is tasty but a dieter's nightmare as it is COVERED in dressing. I'd like to go back and try their sandwiches. An update will follow."
Daniel A.,"Herndon, VA",0,11,,2.0,3/4/2012,"We had always wondered what it was like to eat here because of the crowds of people waiting to get in. My fathers birthday he recieved a gift card, what a letdown. The restaurant was beautiffully decorated, but the lighting was so dim that we couldn't appreciate it. The only dish we would order again would be the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake.The cuban sandwich left a lot to be desired, being cuban, they could benefit from a lesson. Lesson #1 the sandwich should not be saturated with butter, just lightly brushed. The crust of the ""everything pizza"" was satisfactory, but the center was soggy with grease. The BLT salad consisted of an entire head of lettuce, not cut except one slice down the middle, and perched on top was way too much dressing, feta cheese, and the too other main ingredients (bacon and tomato) were few and far between. Don't waste your money, get the cheesecake and go home. Would I ever go back? No."
