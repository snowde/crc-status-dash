Jessi B.,"Centreville, VA",0,13,,5.0,9/13/2017,"I went there on last friday and it was wonderful! I ordered tuna... (i dont remenber exactly. I was an appetizer.),miso salmon, and spagatti which was mixed with shrimp and chicken. Every food i ordered was very delicious and looks beautiful!"
Gerry D.,"Windsor Locks, CT",1,2,,1.0,11/20/2017,Really disappointed in the service.   I am out of town and went there tonight for a nice filet mignonette on my birthday.  I ordered it medium rare and it came back well done.  I just wanted to relax after a long work day and enjoy a good meal but that was not the case.   The waitress said she would get the manager.  I ended up paying for my ice tea and said not to bother because I was leaving.   Not an apology or anything.  It was like she had no clue at the bar area.  I sat at a high top in the bar area.  Last week I tried to order two different meals only to be told they were out with both.  Again I left but at least the waitress apologized several times and said the ice tea was covered.   Really disappointed in the service and will not be returning there.  Will stick to the Marriott at the Fair Oaks Mall for dinner instead.  Clearly much better service
Shannon S.,"Washington, DC",0,36,4,5.0,9/10/2017,I went here to use my Christmas gift cards The ambiance is relaxing and inviting. We didn't have a reservation but it took only 30 seconds to be seated. I ordered the shrimp linguini and my husband ordered something with creole seasoning and chicken. The food was excellent and so was our waiter. We were in and out and the food was greeeat!
M L.,"Fairfax, VA",4,31,1,5.0,10/19/2017,"Giving this restaurant 5 stars primarily due to the amazing service we had tonight. Our waiter, Cameron, served us for a late dinner (around 10pm). Even though it's the end of the day, and everyone was tired and hungry, Cameron was super warm, nice, friendly and very attentive to our needs. He checked on us constantly, but not in an overbearing way. He anticipated our needs, such as an extra plate to share, and extra condiments, before we even had to ask. He was just awesome, which was the singular reason I was compelled to write this review."
Oak L.,"Burke, VA",0,30,,2.0,8/24/2017,"I normally have liked my experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is good and portions are mostly large.  But, my son's family came back from overseas and we went out to celebrate and welcom them back.   My son complained to me that he was being bitten and swarmed by flying insects we initially thought were mosquitoes but turned out to be small gnats. that were flying and hanging about the window just above our table. Well, if I want fine dining, I don't expect to be annoyed by insects that come in swarms.  God only knows if any fell into our food.  (Yeah, I've had that experience and gotten sick in Mexico!)  But, this ain't Mexico and if this is the kind of environment you provide, you can say your farewells now, cause I know other restaurants around Fair Oaks that are cheaper and don't have insects hanging out above the table!!!    Yeah, I'm a little disgusted!  (And I didn't particularly like the feigned reaction of the person at the desk when I reported it on the way out.  She said she was going to take care of it right away -- so they admit they have a problem.   A more normal reaction would be surprise, as I was and a desire to verify the report.  Evidently, they must have heard of the gnats from others. )"
Gloria N.,"Garden Grove, CA",186,139,224,5.0,9/10/2016,"Best service of any Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I'm sad because I can't remember my waiter's name :( Shaved head with a beard... Thank you for serving my party of four!  From constantly checking up on us to bringing us a third basket of bread to giving us a booster seat to finding my mom a pair of chopsticks... you did it all without any complaints and with a smile!  Food, as with any CF, was on point. I used to be all about the Chipotle Chicken pasta, but decided to try the Louisiana Chicken pasta this time around and it could be my new go-to here!  The tiramisu cheesecake was amazing (I don't even like cheesecakes honestly)! Get your cheesecake a la mode... you won't regret it!"
Ah F.,"Gainesville, VA",28,86,495,5.0,3/19/2017,It's one of few chain American food restaurants which is my all time favorite. Portion sizes are good . I visited this place to try their new appetizer and entrees they recently introduced. Crispy Korean cauliflower is must try . Thai and pineapple Chicken are decent as well. I was surprised to see prices on new introduced items are very reasonable. Usually one entree here can cost anywhere from 16-22 dollars vs 12 dollar for new food items.
Matthew S.,"Washington D.C., DC",15,177,49,4.0,8/8/2016,"This was my first time going to this location and it was perfect for our errand running. We went around 330/4pm so no wait and plenty of seating outside (in the shade) and it was the perfect weather for eating outside. My wife and I split the Tuna tar tar - WOW was that good. Fresh seared tuna with avocado and the most delicious sesame soy vinaigrette definitely rocked our socks. I ended up going with the filet medallions and my wife ordered the tuna tataki (tuna with salad). There were 4 little medallions on my plate, I should have ordered something more substantial because 8 bites of meat does not cut it when I'm hungry. I ended up eating some of Hope's tuna to try and fill me up.  We both had a bit room left in our stomachs so of course we had to order cheesecake. Our server Joshua recommended the new cheesecake that was just released (not even on the menu yet), the hazelnut crunch cheesecake, he said it was in his top 5 for cheesecakes...OK we're game. We ordered it and MAN was it rich...very filling and of course cheesecakey. I'm a fan of nutella, so the hazelnut and cheesecake is a win all around. I'd prefer less whipped cream (small dollop on top is fine but the plate seemed covered in whipped cream when it came). All in all, a good meal and we'll be back if we're in the area and have a craving for cheesecake!"
Liz M.,"Vancouver, WA",0,7,,2.0,11/17/2017,"It's okay but to be honest if you're at the mall anyway, there's tastier food at the food court or other restaurants in the area. It's a chain, so its underwhelming and overrated. :/"
Ahmed A.,"Alton, IL",35,2,,1.0,12/23/2017,"I'm Cheesecake factory fan and I go there almost in every city I visit, this particular location is different.. It was a Friday night when I decided to go there with a friend, the line was long and there was a 20 minutes waiting time.. after being seated the waitress took our order, drinks came  after 10 minutes then after 20 minutes the food finally arrived. I had Alfredo pasta which was perfectly made.. While we were eating the waitress brought the bread and butter (which is usually served with drinks). After that I found hair in my Alfredo pasta, I called the waitress to replace the food, the new dish has a very thin and watery Alfredo sauce like someone is upset with us! For finding hair in their perfect food.. I finished my food and called the manager who apologized and said our desert will be on the house because they messed up.. the check came and I paid in full (the manager was lying) .. will never go back to a restaurant where food is dirty, late, unorganized and workers there are liars"
Vivian C.,"Chantilly, VA",198,88,84,5.0,2/4/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is great if you have a hard time in deciding what kind of food to eat. The menu is so diverse: Mexican, Italian, and Asian flavors all represented. I absolutely love and recommend the Carbonara pasta, turkey burger, sweet potato fries, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Crab cake sandwich, and Jambalaya pasta. Honestly, I have never gone wrong with anything I ordered from here. The prices are not bad either, considering the quantity of food. The cheesecake here is definitely not over-rated. Go for the Oreo Cheesecake, Red Velvet Cheesecake, and my favorite: Anniversary cheesecake (vanilla and chocolate)."
Leena N.,"Springfield, VA",193,24,14,1.0,11/4/2017,"First time at a cheesecake factory and I must say that I had the worst experience. We were made to wait 2 hours after saying it was a 50 minute wait. My pager buzzed and the host said there was a mistake and that the buzzer died and gave us a new pager. We were told that we were the 4th party of 4 and would be seated within the next 10 minutes. This went on for a while. After waiting right next to the hostess stand for another 20 minutes watching parties go by we went to check our status. The hostess confronted us and told us that we were buzzed multiple times and were placed on hold. Her and the other hostess were rude and told us blantently that we were wrong. By all means I understand that the wait time for a resturant is something that cannot be controlled by the host stand but to be that rude is unacceptable. Retraining is highly advised. We asked to speak with the manager. The manager stated that he would make sure that our experience from mow on would be enjoyable and apologized. He also stated that for all the inconvenience he would comp dessert. The meal was less than enjoyable. The bread was cold. Our meals came out at off times. The tuna was rubbery and clearly left in the refrigerator for long periods of time. My bistro shrimp that was supposed to have crispy shrimp (as listed in the descripstion) was soggy and the spaghetti noodles were hard and no flavor. The waitress only checked in on us once at the start of our meal. We weren't even given a moment to try our food. At the end of the meal, even though we were promised dessert, they still charged us for it on our bill. It was definitely not communicated to our server which is also upsetting in itself. After speaking with our waitress, the manager that I had originally spoke to had left for the night without even checking in on our table. I will say that another manager did follow up with our table and did inquire about our night. He was also able to help us with our dessert dilemma. After a disastrous night like that I rather have a burger off the dollar menu at McDonalds. At least their food will be hot, tasty, with good customer service."
Forrest M.,"Fairfax, VA",18,1,,1.0,12/28/2016,Zero stars should be an option. This company used to pride itself on customer service. That isn't the case any longer. I have come repeatedly for bad punishment by a staff that doesn't care and management that cares less.  In short save your money and eat else where.
Jodi M.,"Manassas, VA",318,498,375,4.0,10/7/2015,"You honestly can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. You want steak... cool, they have it. Chicken, cool. Pasta... yep, it's on there. Asian, American, Mexican, Italian... check, check, check and check! I opted for an Asian chicken salad... it arrived in a bowl the size of a large pizza!  It's beautifully decorated and perhaps a little dark.  It's usually packed - probably because they literally have something for everyone. Service has always been nice as well. Tip... order your salads undressed and add as you go.  You're bound to take some of it home so you might as well keep the lettuce from getting soggy."
Lisa D.,"Glen Cove, NY",62,274,,3.0,1/9/2017,"Very good for a Cheesecake Factory.  The staff were much more discombobulated than one might have expected, but extremely pleasant.  And the food was much the same as one might find in any other Cheesecake Factory."
Jesse C.,"Fairfax, VA",396,123,641,5.0,5/8/2016,"Great restaurant!!! Kinda hard to believe that this is my first time at Cheesecake factory.  I have always heard wonderful things about this chain, but never had an opportunity to try it till now. I would say everything I've heard was very accurate.  The food was SOOO GOOD!!! All the food is full of flavor and for the price you pay you get VERY hardy portions.  We got the summer rolls as well as the avocado egg rolls for an appetizers.  The summer rolls were ok.  They weren't spectacular, but they are very crunchy and pretty decent.  The avocado rolls were extraordinary!!!  Who knew putting avocado in an egg roll and frying it would be so tasty.  The sauce that came with it is like a sweet sauce that kind of reminds me of pico or salsa.  But I don't really know for certain, all I know is it was very tasty. For the entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio as well as the Chicken Madeira.  Both were extraordinary tasty!!!  The Chicken Bellagio is a pasta based entree with two large breaded chicken patties over a nice serving of noodles with a pesto and cream flavored sauce that was very delicious.  They top off the dish with some nice fresh arugula.  The dish was very delicious and everything worked well together and very filling.  The chicken madeira is no joke either, that dish is freakin amazing!!  You get three large chicken patties with mozzarella, sautéed mushrooms and asparagus on top, and they pour an absolutely mouthwateringly delicious dark sauce over the combination.  That combination of the savory meat and freshness of the veggies is an absolutely amazing explosion of flavors in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes were very delicious as well and on the chunkier consistency side.  This dish is a must have! We got two cheese cake for dessert: the mango key lime cheesecake and the reeses peanut butter chocolate cheesecake.  I prefer the reeses peanut butter chocolate cheesecake because I love chocolate and peanut butter.  They mango cheesecake was very delicious as well and very sweet.  I personally think that there is nothing in this world that is too sweet so I could take it.  Great restaurant and I promise you that I will be coming back.  There sandwiches sound really good so I need to make plans to come back and try some of those, and of course have me more of those cheesecake flavors."
Pn K.,"Centreville, VA",0,34,31,5.0,2/25/2017,"Well .. nothing changes with the menu at cheese cake factory right ? Yes !! The food is great ! The cheesecakes are awesome but thats not my point in writing this review ..  I would now say the waiter can make a whole lot .. a world of difference on your dining experience!! And your evening !!  We have been to the Cheesecake Factory at Tysons and had a terrible dining experience,... the waiter needed to be reminded to get our menu ,refill our water , and a whole lot more negative things ...and we were hesitant to go to the one at fairfax mall .  We had a 45 min wait at Tyson's location  and ended the evening on a bad note . But at the fairfax location Ash ( Ashim ) made our  hour long wait all worthwhile . Very pleasant , polite , patient and very personal with each one of us at our table ! You made us think of coming back again .. but yes ofcourse to the fairfax location :)  Thankyou Ash and Best wishes to you !"
My S.,"Burke, VA",108,193,350,4.0,5/30/2016,"Cheesecake is a solid place to go when you want some classic American food and you want to have a good time. The service is typically very stellar and everyone is friendly and efficient.  So, usually I get the same 2 things at Cheesecake but this time we tried something different! I also had a bite of everyone else's food too :) Grilled steak tacos - this comes with 4 mini tacos and a side of rice and beans. The rice is a bit bland and definitely needs some salt and pepper, but the beans were much more savory. The tacos overall surprised me as they had a good amount of both steak and guac on them. Solid 4/5 Crispy chicken sandwich - we got this Korean style which has a coleslaw and a Sriracha mayo on the side. Get this with the sweet potato fries because the sweetness compliments the sandwich well. The chicken is crispy and the brioche bun is soft and sweet. 5/5 Chicken and biscuits - this was my least favorite of all the dishes. It sort of tasted like a deconstructed chicken pot pie but the chicken had a slight overcooked, rubbery quality to it. The biscuit was not bad but nothing I would crave and get again. 2.5/5 Smokehouse burger - this was a solid burger, the bacon was crispy and the onion rings were a nice touch. We got fries as the side for this and they were fine. Burger could have used a *touch* more salt but it was fine. 3/5 Overall, you can always count on going to Cheesecake with a group of friends or your family because the menu is huge and there is really something for everyone."
Nia C.,"Manassas, VA",0,8,2,1.0,8/19/2017,Came here for my brother's birthday dinner granted I understand coming for Saturday night can be hectic but we have wait for 2 and half hours after coming at 6. I think Cheesecake Factory needs to implement a call ahead policy even though reservations would be better for their company. I refuse to come back to this location
Vivienne V.,"Washington, DC",155,13,18,4.0,1/26/2017,"Good lunch options, the service is on point. Got the almond crusted salmon salad, the salad was a little too sour/tangy for my likening. Bf got steak tacos which was very juicy, good seasoning"
