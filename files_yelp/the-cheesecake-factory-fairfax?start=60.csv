Amanda S.,"Fairfax, VA",2,9,,3.0,7/26/2017,"First the food is ALWAYS delicious and whenever we dine in it's the only place in Fairfax where my family and I have received decent service from start to finish! Then yesterday my daughter and I were at the mall and I decided to grab a takeaway...when we went in to pick it up there were two ppl behind the bakery counter but neither of them greeted us, no biggie the girl came with my food and drink about 5 minutes later (I called ahead to place my order) al was well until I got home and started to eat... Side bar: I'm allergic to Blue cheese so I asked for ranch instead....ikr Ranch, ranch, extra ranch  (I get it I've worked service for years, you can never serve enough )  But no seriously I am allergic, well there were two containers in my box, both looked like what I asked for... ONE was not and it happened to be the one I ate from  after having a severe reaction I had my husband throw out the rest! ‍ I get mistakes are made and I'm not angry, just wish I could've enjoyed my almost $20 (including tip) lunch!"
Frank B.,"Fairfax, VA",70,162,118,4.0,7/9/2017,"Are here tonight .... the menu is overwhelming; too many options. The food portions are huge. I couldn't finish my entree. I'm glad we didn't get an appetizer and there was definitely no room for dessert. With the current menu calories being added, I opted to stay under 1,500 for one meal. Thank goodness it was my only meal of the day!"
Maddy L.,"Fairfax, VA",482,230,259,5.0,7/31/2015,"I went last night for the last day of ~1/2 off cheesecake~. I mean who can honestly pass that up? Definitely not me. It was super packed, but even more than usual because of the awesome deal that they had going on. I went right after work around 9 pm and decided to sit at the bar rather than wait a long time for a table. My friend and I decided on just desserts and drinks for the night. Our bartender, Michael, was extremely nice and attentive.  You get started off with some free bread, yum carbs. Although we ordered just drinks, I've been there plenty of times to know that you won't get disappointed in the food. The service however is a hit or miss and depends how busy it is that day. I enjoy going here though but I wish they had some more space so the waits weren't so ridiculous sometimes. The menu is extensive and about 20+ pages long.. I do not know how the servers/bartenders do it. Good place to go if you can't decide what to eat - there are soo many options plus good dessert!"
Maria R.,"Chantilly, VA",0,33,56,5.0,8/3/2016,"This is one of my family's go-to restaurants. So many different options if everybody can't agree on a specific cuisine. My last two visits, I've gotten the luau salad. All the ingredients are so fresh and taste delicious together. I usually order a pasta or one of their specialty dishes, which I haven't been disappointed with. My brother with a big appetite loves their burrito grande (it's about a foot long and as thick as a chipotle burrito). My dad on the other hand is more health conscious and orders from their skinnylicious menu.  Let's not forget their cheesecake! My family's favorites are the dulce de leche, red velvet, and mango key lime. All so delicious! Unfortunately, they don't take reservations so we usually try to go at odd hours or not so busy days. Our last particular visit was on a Sunday night around 7 PM and we only had to wait 20 mins for a party of 5. Overall, worth the wait for good food and service!"
Mai T.,"Fairfax, VA",0,4,9,1.0,5/25/2017,"Most of the time when we order togo, it's made wrong. When we call to complain, the managers are rude. I wrote a complaint to corporate, they ignored my email. Terrible terrible service! Will not come back even though it's convenient!"
Schyler P.,"Seattle, WA",80,250,161,3.0,10/19/2016,"I got a California Guacamole Salad and it was tasty! It is in the ""Super Foods"" section rather than the Salad section of the menu which is a bit confusing. Although it seems like there are a lot of ingredients, I would say it was a pretty simple salad. It was definitely more like salad greens with dressing than an actual salad with toppings. Maybe it's because the toppings were mixed in well! When I got the salad, I was honestly a bit frightened because the guac looked old and dull (see pic). It was actually quite tasty though! I asked for no onions and the feta on the side and there was no fuss about this request! It was actually a hefty bit of salad. My mom ate maybe a quarter of it and I still had trouble finishing it all! So portion-wise, they are really not skimping out! I actually quite liked the dressing, but there could've been a little less of it. My mom thought the dressing was a bit spicy though so be careful if you are really sensitive! I couldn't taste any spices really, though. I was pleasantly full at the end of the meal. This was definitely not one of those salads that you get because you want to feel good about getting a salad but then it ends up being as heavy as an actual meal. No! This was a salad that was pretty light but still filling. However, it wasn't anything really special."
Dave U.,"Burke, VA",85,214,309,4.0,7/30/2015,"This Fair Oaks location has been consistent in their food quality and service.   I specifically enjoy dining and drinking right at the bar.  The staff is very attentive and they have good tv screens.    We recently came by to enjoy their half price Cheesecake specials.  But first a few drinks after a rough week, and then we also ordered several apps and finally bellied up to ordering 'cheesecake'.   The Dynamite Shrimp were meh, probably not worth ordering again.  The tiny shrimp were overly coated with a tempura type of breading.  It was a very small plate.  The Buffalo Blasts were the complete opposite.  The portion was enough for a group of people.  These were spicy chicken wrapped in a won ton wrapper then breaded and fried.  It came with 2 dipping sauces that were excellent.  This will definitely be on my next meal plan. We enjoyed our full slices of cheesecake after a few hours.  The staff was kind enough to let us take these bargain priced deals homes."
Stefanie H.,"Washington, DC",12,7,7,3.0,2/18/2017,"Pretty crowded tonight and I know our server is trying to do his best but ugh. My husband ordered crab cake entree and I the bang bang chicken and shrimp the portions were great I just hoped for more spicy bang in my entree. Both had ""skinny"" cocktails that were well balanced. My daughter had the pepperoni pizza and strawberry lemonade and was satisfied. Just wish they were more organized with seating etc."
Kimberly J.,"Chantilly, VA",814,1667,23046,4.0,4/30/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is a book. There is something here for everyone. Huge variety of Appetizers, Main Dishes, Light Menu, Drinks, and Desserts. Leave room for Cheesecake, it's delicious. The Godiva is one of my top favorites. I've been to this particular location a bunch of times now since it's the closest one to home.  Employees have been friendly and helpful for most of our visits. During a recent visit here, our server was incredibly attentive and really made our lunch special. Thank you! We've ordered food to go from here as well. There is reserved parking for customers who are picking up their food, which is a nice touch. You can also go in to just order cheesecake as well. Their dessert counter is to your left upon entrance. Restrooms are towards the right of the restaurant, upon entering."
Ikran A.,"Mount Rainier, MD",0,2,,5.0,7/4/2017,As usual Cheesecake Factory is so filling. Love how huge the plate is. This location is so clean with lovely servers. Can't complain
Sheila N.,"Fairfax, VA",135,223,1153,3.0,3/12/2015,"It's always a hit or miss with this place. Honestly the experience all depends on your waiter/waitress.  I ended up ordering a new dish this time around. I usually get the lettuce Thai wraps. Mmm... Not too impressed with my choice. It was a chipotle pasta dish.  They have a Sheila avocado salad on the menu which I just noticed for the first time which is pretty awesome :) it's always great to have your name show up on a menu, right? Haha! Of course we had to try it! Well, they left off the Avocados! Ha!  We also ordered a beets an goat cheese salad which was WONDERFUL! I would highly recommend this to anyone :)"
Gbehlee S.,"Arlington, VA",0,10,2,4.0,10/9/2017,My boyfriend and I stopped in and got some cheese cake. The staff was very courteous especially when he left his credit card. We were able to pick it up the next day.
Sook W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,14,11,1.0,6/2/2017,"Don't come here. Had to wait 10 minutes for our server to come ask for a drink/water (it wasn't even busy hours!). Then when I got my food (hibachi steak) it came out cold so I sent it back to the kitchen. Took another 20 minutes. In the meantime, no one (server or manager) came to check on us or give us an update on the steak. Finally when the steak came out, everyone was full but me and exhausted waiting. Returned my food to the kitchen (server didn't even apologize) and will never be coming back."
Fadey J.,"Springfield, VA",4,10,,1.0,9/30/2017,"I give this rating a one not because of the food, mostly because we never had a chance to sit and eat. We were told the wait would be 30-45 mins for a table, while many entered and were seated before us. We were told by Calvin that we were waiting for specific table but he was very condescending and rude when we would ask for updates. He told us there was only one table to seat our party. How is there only one table to seat our group. It was a large group but there are many options in the restaurant. We ended up leaving without eating and he seemed please to watch us go and was non apologetic."
Kimberly M.,"Bealeton, VA",49,3,2,2.0,1/12/2016,"Because this is the closest location, I keep giving them ""do overs""......I just need to suck it up and believe them for who they are. Sigh.  I've had food poisoning from the Mac & Cheese Balls (go figure)..... So I just started to get cheesecake to go. That's it. Well, I guess I'm done with that too. Maybe it's my sign not to eat fattening foods lol.  Found paper in my cheesecake this time....and I was getting to the best part.....when I looked down and seen the paper. Oh well..... Previously it's been hair, lint, lord knows what else.  If you get a slice of cheesecake to go, make sure you ask for the edible paper.  (That's a joke for the not so smart people)"
Lilly N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",186,101,54,4.0,1/30/2016,"I came for coffee and just a little something to eat, not a full blown meal. I got the caramel royale macchiato and I thought it would be s small mug but it came out to be in a pint glass. Haha soooooo much sugar. If you have a sweet tooth then this is the drink for you.  I also had the tomato basil flatbread. It was very please to the eye and it was good, just a little on the greasy side.  Our server was nice and checked on us regularly. No complaints there."
Alex K.,"Springfield, VA",6,31,36,5.0,8/4/2016,"Great service, great food! Came during happy hour for a quick bite. Their Jw's pink lemonade cocktail was delicious and appetizers were huge. Will definitely be returning"
Joshua J.,"Clifton, VA",103,160,10,3.0,8/2/2016,"Always have great good from their extensive menu, but tonight, for my Birthday dinner, the service was awful.  My girlfriend and I took a while to go through the menu & pick what we wanted, which irritated the waitress (though the restaurant was less than half full), & she gave us weird looks & tried to get rid of us quickly, giving us the check 3 bites into our dessert. 3 stars is generous based on tonight's experience, but I know it's been better previously, so I hope it won't happen again."
Nick C.,"Leesburg, VA",0,19,9,3.0,5/21/2017,"Went here on a Thursday night for dinner, walked right in and was seated immediately. I have been going to The Cheesecake Factory for many years and I know that they're never super fast getting the food to the table... that being said, it took 45 minutes from when we ordered to when we got our food. The food was, is, and always has been great, but it's not worth waiting that long. Then it came time for desert (this is the only place we get desert out so we look forward to it). We ordered a strawberry shortcake and they didn't have any! That was perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole experience. I'll still go back to the Cheesecake Factory in the future, but probably won't rush back to this location."
Greg S.,"Chantilly, VA",26,7,1,2.0,7/17/2017,"Wife walked in requesting a table for eight. My son and I were 15 minutes out, but wanted to get seated and drinks for the elderly in our party. The manager refused to seat them saying he needed a majority of the party there. Guess he is not trained that six of eight is a majority. They were not even busy and had plenty of open tables. We were seated after I arrived and waitress immediately pressed for our dinner orders. Had to skip my usual appetizer. Then after all that, the food took over 30 minutes to come out and was cold. To top it off, she disappeared and had to beg to get the check. I usually love this place, but skipped dessert there and will ban out for six months. I eat at premium restaurants, but will send money elsewhere if that is the service now."
