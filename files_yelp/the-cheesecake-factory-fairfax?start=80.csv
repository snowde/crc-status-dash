Mj L.,"Reston, VA",0,16,,3.0,9/5/2017,"This particular Cheesecake Factory has always been very consistent in a good way. There is a wide variety of food that is enjoyed by picky adults and toddlers alike. And of course the cheesecake is always good. Service at this location typically has been efficient and pleasant, and cognizant of families with small children. Based on previous visits, we took an elderly grandparent with us on Sunday, September 3, 2017 . However, that visit was awful in terms of service. It started out ok as we asked to be seated outside and were seated right away. The server took our orders and left. We ordered a kids meal for the toddler and opted to share a number of appetizers. An initial group of appetizers (including crab bites) came first. We finished those and then we waited... and waited... and waited. The server never checked on us and did not once refill our drinks. It took about an hour (seriously) for someone to bring us our other appetizers, which included sliders. The server dropped the food on our table and bolted away before we could ask for refills or even the check in anticipation of an antsy toddler. We had to get up and ask someone to provide us the bill because the server would not come around. Needless to say, we were embarrassed to have taken our elderly grandparent. The food was good but overshadowed by the awful service We had intended on ordering slices of cheesecake to share at the table, but the service took so long that we opted to leave. We quickly paid the bill with a gift card and attempted to purchase cheesecake at the front of the restaurant as we did not want to wait forever for the server to take the order and bring the dessert. This process also was delayed as we could not use the remaining balance on the gift card as the server failed to properly close out the bill. So... they had to track her down and get her to close out the bill so we could use the card. The pumpkin cheesecake, however, was very good; but we had to eat it at home instead of the restaurant due to lousy service. Bottom line is consistently good food but unpredictably service."
Thomas W.,"Fairfax, VA",11,4,1,1.0,4/28/2017,The service is terrible. We called ahead for two cheesecake. Got there service was slow with five people behind the counter standing around talking. The cheesecake was not ready and I had to reorder. I am not going back.
Lyn L.,"Burke, VA",225,707,2414,5.0,9/24/2014,"This is my go-to place when I want consistent food and drink!   An added convenience is doing a bit of mall shopping since this Cheesecake Factory is in the Fair Oaks Mall.  Service(lunch, happy or dinner) seems best when sitting in the bar area.   There's a nice convenient TV to track sports, check out the news, or just plain ole' veg out.    The bar server is always on her/his A-game! My fav app is their Fried Zucchini sticks.  They actually bread and fry up these babies from scratch, none of that pull the bag from the freezer, fry it up, and call it Fried Zucchini.    Their salad are GINORMOUS.    A few selections have lunch or half portions.  I always order the Chinese Chicken Salad, there's plenty of chicken breast, the right amount of scallions, oranges, nuts, and other crunchy treats.  The bread at the Cheesecake Factory is like crack...I eat it there, order more, and then pack more to go...addiction never tasted this good."
Mabast M.,"Manassas, VA",1,45,30,1.0,4/1/2017,"Wow terrible service. Over a 40 min wait, server not checking on us. My weekend time is very valuable to me. I cant have it carelessly wasted. Will never return. My visit was on April 1st, seated at 3:40 decided to have food made to go and asked for check at 4:33pm. Not good."
Emily T.,"Fairfax, VA",0,6,,2.0,9/3/2017,"While the service by the waitress was nice, 3 of 6 place settings were dirty with food stuck to it after the dishwasher along with some of the app plates. Manager 1 came and apologized and was visibly embarrassed took the silverware and never brought more. It took about 15 minutes for all six dishes to make it to the table from the first one down to the last one. A salad had a giant metal staple in it. Manager 2 came, apologized and finally said he'd comp the one salad after looking bewildered. Just not a great experience from start to finish. Go somewhere else."
Farah M.,"Vienna, VA",9,26,14,5.0,2/22/2017,"Came for happy hour this past Monday, and I loved it! I usually only come for dinner, so this was my first time trying items from the happy hour menu. Trust me when I say, the ""small plates"" are still big when it comes to the happy hour (which is awesome). We ordered the burger, buffalo blasts, fried cheese, and pear/blue cheese flatbread. All really great choices! And our waiter was extremely nice, and made sure we enjoyed our experience. I highly recommend giving the happy hour a try, and I will definitely come back again!"
Chris L.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,14,3,4.0,4/22/2017,"My wife and I have been married for juuuust about 12 years. We have 3 kids. We haven't been out on a date in well over a year. Tonight we had a chance to go out, and have only been to Cheesecake Factory once before together (this location as well). It was pretty packed when we got there, and it looked like the wait would be at least an hour. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, and they were spot on. Seating was a little too close together. This was my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I'd rather not be able to hear the conversations of the guests at the tables on both sides of me, but I guess they have to seat as many people as they can to keep the wait times down. It was a little loud in there, but it was not unbearable. Our server was Veronica B. If I ever get the opportunity to dine here again, I hope she's still there. I used to wait tables (at a far smaller establishment) in my younger years. Veronica was probably the most attentive server I can remember in recent years of dining out - anywhere. Despite it being very busy, she was in point. She greeted us quickly, gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, came back after just the right amount of time had passed. Filled up drinks when she noticed they were getting low (not even low, like halfway). Didn't excessively check on us. Offered to box up our food when she saw we had both put our forks down. I can't say enough good things about her. I hope management gets to read this one. Food was great. I ordered the gumbo, my wife had the Romano chicken. Mine was hot, tasted fresh, very flavorful. Presentation was good. My wife said the Romano was good, came as was described on the menu, was juicy, went well with the pasta. Cheesecake Factory is know for their giant portions, and today was no exception. We shared a slice of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for desert at home. Can anyone really complain about the cheesecake? It was fantastic as always. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for an enjoyable dinner and for the start of a great date night."
Judi B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",4,6,,1.0,3/4/2017,Food was excellent service is severely lacking. Too much waiting for waiter and food items.
Suleman H.,"Chantilly, VA",45,9,3,5.0,3/20/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is the bomb.  I have always had excellent service here, they have always accommodated me and my family with any special requests that we have made.  My favourite dish is the Jamaican shrimp entree, it's just the right amount of sweet and spice.  My only complaint is that the portions are too big and it's very difficult to keep some room for the yummy cheesecake desserts!"
CJ K.,"Hackettstown, NJ",0,23,,4.0,4/8/2017,"I just wanted to take the time to update and say that we've been back several times since my last review.  It's not always perfect, but my past experience was certainly an exception and not the rule when it comes to quality of food and service.  We recently found a new menu favorite: The Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp."
Sam P.,"Fairfax, VA",184,5,,1.0,8/23/2017,"I have come here multiple times but A few nights ago I had the worst experience. It was a Tuesday night, not busy, around 9. We waited 15 minutes to be greeted and were ready to order as soon as we were. I ordered the shrimp bistro pasta and a lemonade. My lemonade had a fly in it, and my pasta came out with LITERALLY 16 cloves of garlic. I mean I like garlic as much as the next person but I plucked out 16 whole cloves and set them on my bread plate because biting into a whole clove of garlic with one bite of pasta is very unpleasant. As far as the fly in my drink, I work in an outdoor restaurant, I understand that shit happens. So it's not a big deal. But in combination with being ignored, a vampire-murder level of garlic, and slow (yet rushed when he did speak to us) service, I left thoroughly disappointed in our experience that night."
Oscar Z.,"Fairfax, VA",0,11,,4.0,4/3/2017,"Great customer service always very friendly staff. Some of the best cheesecakes around in many different flavors. Pricing isnt even too bad, grocery store cheesecakes are 3-4$ a slice and these are easily double the size of those grocery store slices. If youre looking for cheesecake i cant see what would be a better option. Carrot cake and red velvet cheesecakes are decent, adams peanut butter cup is just like a big butterfinger bar not worth it. White chocolate macadamia nut is very good. Their fried mac and cheese balls are great. Don't know about their other menu items. Everything should be decent though!"
Tyler C.,"Fairfax, VA",0,107,9,1.0,2/19/2017,"By far some of the worst food...if you enjoy chain restaurants such as TGIF, Ruby Tuesdays, and others...I would suggest you go to them instead, you will save money. They have a massive menu with some what premium prices...is it premium food, NO!  I LOVE Tex-Mex egg rolls and then I got excited to see that they have an egg roll sampler, but it was more like a food processed spring roll sampler. The rolls were very skinny with the ingredients being an unidentifiable mush. Greasy..disgusting...garbage. Avocado rolls...why...why?! The crab cakes were tiny, not a single lump, and ice cold.  This is overpriced chain food."
Christian S.,"Centreville, VA",0,9,7,2.0,6/13/2016,I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory chains but this particular location service is Mediocre at best . Server completely forgotten about us and kept refilling our sprite with water.. But their miso salmon is always good.
Remy K.,"Fairfax, VA",0,46,1,2.0,8/7/2017,"My last visit to this location really deserves 1 star, but I'm giving 2 because the food at least tasted decent. The service I received at this location during a weekday lunch was horrible. Quite possibly the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. We were seated and waited around 20 Minutes before being greeted. We finally had to ask another server if we could order. Eventually we were able to order waters, but they were rarely refilled throughout the meal. We also had to ask 3 times for bread to be brought to the table. We waited 45 min for our food before a manager came out saying that one of our meals had ""been dropped."" He didn't offer to do anything to ""fix"" the situation, other than saying it would be out soon. I believe they actually forgot to ring in the food because I've been to another CF location where the exact same story was told to someone at the table.  The server never came to talk to us about the ""dropped food"" nor did she ever apologize. Another server from another table actually came to check on us asking if our food had ever come out. He apologized to us despite not even being our server (I wish he had been). Eventually the food came out, but our server never checked to see if it was right. Eventually she came back to take our plates and we had to ask if we could order cheesecake. The ""dropped"" food was not comped or any cheesecake given for the trouble and the entire lunch took 2 hours and 12 min from the time we were seated- which is ridiculous when people have work. Overall a very disappointing experience."
B D.,"Washington, DC",0,6,3,2.0,3/26/2017,"Highly unexpected bad service given the fact that I frequent the Arlington and Chevy Chase locations. Those locations appreciate, acknowledge and respect their clientele. This Fair Oaks locations could care less. It took 15 mins just to take our drink order...then came the food. It was mediocre at best and COLD. I had to advise a different server (Andi) of the issue and she was attentive...unlike our initial server Andrew who acted as if he had no time to be bothered until the check came. THAT was the only expedient part of the entire dinner. When I spoke with the manager, Jennifer (who was ""new"") I was informed that she had only been there for 2 weeks and didnt know who Andrew was but that she would address the situation. Needless to say I wasn't happy with her excuse either therefore I will not be returning to this location nor do I suggest it if you want a nice experience."
Lynn F.,"Fairfax, VA",387,253,1769,1.0,4/12/2016,"I don't give out only 1 star to restaurants a lot, but honestly, I almost wish I could give it less.  So, we come in for a birthday party for one of my friend's good friend and since they don't take reservations, we had to wait for a table to open up. That wasn't a big deal, except for the fact that if we had 8 people in our group, the waiting time would have been 50 minutes, but with only 7, it was only a 15 minute wait. No offense, but that's kind of ridiculous. I have worked in the restaurant industry and a friend in the group had also worked in the restaurant industry and a difference of only one person in this context really shouldn't have made that much of a difference. I say this because, a) they could have moved two tables closer together, I see them do this all the time, or b) have all 8 people; 4 on each side of the bigger booths that they have in the back. They say this ""isn't allowed"" but I blatantly see this rule broken all the time so that was kind of annoying to deal with. Maybe there was some other reason, but to me, it seemed kind of like just an excuse but who knows.  Anyways, so one of the people in our party decided to leave because they didn't want to have to wait so long. This was unfortunate, but honestly, I almost wish I had just decided to skip as well. This however made the wait time shorter and we were able to sit much sooner than expected. Starting out, I thought it would be a good night! The server came very quick, got us all waters, and bread to start out with and I thought that it was going really well! He gave us a good amount of bread too! The problems only started to arise after we placed our food orders. I wanted to order the Shrimp Summer Rolls but they were out, so I opted for the Ahi Tartare. The other people in my party ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich, the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich, Medallion Steak (from the skinnylicious menu), the Stuffed Mushrooms and Dynamite Shrimp, someone else ordered the hibachi steak, and finally the 4-cheese Pasta. So, things are going fine, until we wait a good 35-45 minutes for the food. I would have been fine if our waiter had come by and checked on us or at least said something about the long wait, but he kept rushing by and didn't stop to say anything. This, I was not pleased with. I wanted to ask for more water because I had none but it was too hard to flag him down. Yes, being a waiter in the past I know it's very hard at times, but I saw that the waiters seem to all work together and with the bus boys and food runners. I feel like he could easily have asked them to at least refill our waters. It almost seemed like he was avoiding our table, but who knows. I will vouch for him and say that he was very busy!! They put a lot of people in his section and some of the other tables talked and had lots of comments and questions about the menu, so I understand that he was probably overwhelmed. So, when we finally got our food, one of our dishes never came. The Hibachi Steak was accidentally given to another table so one person had to sit and wait while we all ate. They did however take the Hibachi Steak off of our check because they had made a big mistake so that I really respect. It just kind of put a damper on our whole dining experience. For my meal, I was extremely disappointed. I got a 7.50 appetizer and it was tiny! I couldn't believe how small it was. I get that Cheesecake Factory is naturally way overpriced, but to this extent! Even if it had costed 5$ I would have called it skimpy. I was even further disappointed when I noticed that it was mostly just avocado. There was maybe a half of a centimeter of tuna, and the rest of the extremely small circular tartare was the avocado. I will say in its defense, it tasted pretty good. There really wasn't too much seasoning and honestly, if it were just larger, I think it would have been a perfectly fine appetizer, but it was just way too small for it to be even considered an appetizer. The other small plates that I tried from my friend were the Dynamite Shrimp and the Stuffed Mushrooms. Both were really small and their price came out to be 14.50$ (give or take a few cents). That was also ridiculous. Their size was larger though, but still, it was really steep. I will say though, I really liked the taste of the shrimp and the dipping sauce that came with it. The stuffed mushrooms were nothing special and I could have honestly made better ones.  Everyone else seemed to like their meals, but everything was just, okay. Nothing was amazing.  So, our waiter finally comes back after we have finished our meals and he asks if we want anything else and we say we just want the check and that we want it to be split by what each person ordered. He goes and gets it ready for us. This takes a VERY LONG TIME. When we finally get the checks, we return the bills and this takes a very long time as well. Let's just say, we were seated around 8, and finally got out around 10. I will not be coming back."
Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",120,400,592,3.0,7/21/2014,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, meaning they specialize in cheesecake. It's famous for its cheesecake, don't order anything else. No one would go to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and ask him for garlic broccoli. So this particular factory, as many of you know, has an insanely large menu. So long in fact, I don't feel like reading anything else for the rest of the day. Their ridiculously long menu features fairly overpriced food stuffs that I'd say are pretty average in comparison to other chain restaurants from the handful of times I've been. So go for the cheesecake and coffee. That's all I can recommend. Their liquid items are pretty good too. I went here with my girl friend for a leisurely Sunday brunch. She ordered the California omelette, I ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes and a double espresso, and we both ordered mimosas. She was happy with her omelette. My pancakes were only so-so. I thought the lemon/ricotta flavor would be stronger, but it was pretty mild. And there was the saddest, weakest pile of limp strawberries on top of the pancakes I've ever seen in my life (see photo). However, the mimosa I had included a nice strawberry on the flute rim. Not sure why they didn't use these strawberries on the pancakes. Lame!  The mimosa and espresso with a lemon twist were my favorite parts of the breakfast. So I encourage you to get a liquid while there. Our server also had a great sense of humor and was rather entertaining, so that helped, but it still only gets 3 stars for it's mediocre food. Moral of the story: Be logical and order cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. Apparently thinking inside the box has it's perks once in a while."
Sydney K.,"Vienna, VA",0,69,,4.0,8/5/2017,"Don't go when they're busy, they take forever with food arrivals... but if you want to get sat right away go to the bar."
Polyphemus S.,"Reston, VA",2,90,89,4.0,4/30/2016,Great BBQ chicken salad and chicken sandwiches. Don't get the meatloaf. Very clean inside and great for kids
