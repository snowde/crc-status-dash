Jennifer A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",414,44,60,3.0,12/3/2017,"Review update*** In my initial review I had given this location five stars because of prior great experiences. Unfortunately today was not as great so I am updating my review.  We came in today for brunch. And sat outside to enjoy the nice weather and Las Olas view. Our server came over and greeted us, he came back quickly with our first round of drinks and told us he would be right back. Unfortunately, my family and I were left there with our drinks getting watered down and no one came ""right back"" to take our order. It took 20 minutes for someone to come over and that person not being our server but she did take an order for us. After that it took another 35 minutes for our food to come outside. From the time we were sat and received a first round of drinks, the total time before we received our food was almost an hour from beginning to end we spent almost two hours here when all we were expecting to do was have a quick brunch before some holiday shopping.  I do understand that weekends are busy but I do expect more from such a reputable establishment. I work in the food industry and 20 minutes to take an order is not okay and 35 minute ticket times on lunch entrees is a bit ridiculous. Even if someone had come over and checked up on us, told us there was a delay in the kitchen, asked if our drinks were ok (which the first margarita we got wasn't that great) we would have felt better and been more understanding. But it's a terrible feeling to feel that you were looking forward to relaxing and catching up with family but instead we were anxious and hungry and the bad experience consumed the conversation and ruined the entire afternoon.  I did make a manager aware of the situation and he was very nice and polite when he came over so that is appreciated. The food was good as usual but not worth waiting an hour. Next time it may be better to check out the other great brunch places on Las Olas and only come to this location when I have 2 hours to spare on a meal.  _________________ _________ __ Original review* From beginning to end a delightful experience! We started our meal with two appetizers, the fried Mac and cheese and the blue cheese and pear flat bread. I fell in love the the fried mac and the delicious tomato based sauce they came in was fantastic. I also loved the hint of sweetness that the pear adds to the flatbread without overpowering the other flavors. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better the entrees arrived.  I love great presentation and my boyfriend and I both had beautiful photo worthy dishes! He had he Thai Coconut Lime Chicken which was great. One bite wasn't enough, I kept picking off of his plate. I had the Miso Salmon which can be best described in one word, ""wow!"" The dish was bursting with amazing flavor and I couldn't hen enough of  the miso sauce. I asked for more so I could mix it in with my rice, such a great mix. This is definitely my new salmon dish.  We ended our meal with the celebration cheesecake, my daughter was instantly drawn to the fun colors. It tasted just as good as it looked.  The service was just as great as the food. Our server greeted us quickly, was very nice and attentive during the entire time we were there. He was already offering refills as we came close to the bottom of our sodas and was so nice to offer to pack our leftovers so we could have space for dessert. We will be back soon, thanks for a great time!"
Oanh P.,"Boston, MA",48,181,315,3.0,9/1/2017,"Went to the Royal pig and kitchen was already closed and Cheesecake Factory was still opened.  It was pretty late so we were seated right away. Service was good. Food was good... but the fried egg roll was so salty.  Nonetheless, if you are in a mood for a late night bite.. its good enough. Nothing bad about this place."
Carly G.,"Manhattan, NY",338,58,43,4.0,7/16/2017,"Came here very last minute for a 2pm Sunday lunch. The waitstaff was definitely lacking in efficiency---had to ask for water and bread like, 5 different times---but the food and menu totally made up for it! Naturally, such a large menu would stir a bit of uneasiness in my ordering confidence. Luckily, I was craving a salad, so rather than an entire booklet of options, I was left deciding between just one large PAGE of options! :) The whole grain bread at the start was delicious, but my Asian Taco Lettuce Wraps were AMAZING. Everything well priced, too!"
Marcelo F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",168,20,14,1.0,1/7/2018,"Hard to believe that such a large restaurant is so unorganized. The problem is always when picking up to-go orders. The person in the to go booth has no way to communicate with the kitchen and has to constantly run back to check on orders while also taking phone calls and tons of clients that keep walking up to the to go desk. They tell you to wait, then your order is brought out and no one tells you anything, so youre sitting waiting for nothing. Also they never have cup holders. Really need to get it together guys! Besides that, most staff is great. So os the food. Maybe management needs to be swapped out."
Kimberly D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",521,357,1174,5.0,10/23/2017,"I don't usually bother reviewing franchise restaurants, but I wanted to leave a review of excellent service that I received on my visit to this Cheesecake Factory.  I had a long, 13-hour day of work, and my friend and I stopped in at this CF for a late night meal.  I really craved some pasta and red meat, although they didn't specifically list that on the menu. I asked our server if I could get the Farfalle with Roasted Garlic with steak instead of the chicken, and he made it happen.  He delivered my meal exactly how I wanted, with the steak cooked to temp and the pasta saucy and lots of garlic.  It absolutely slayed my craving.  Thanks for a great meal after a really tiring day."
Kimberly Z.,"Miami, FL",198,78,148,5.0,12/6/2017,"This is my go-to restaurant hands down. For birthdays, celebrations, or just a delicious meal, we always enjoy ourselves. Service is great. Food is always great. If you don't like something, they take it back no problem and bring you something else. I loooove their bread they bring out with butter. So simple but so addicting! I always order the crusted chicken Romano with penne pasta... like every time. It's that good. Thin chicken with crusty breading. I also love the fried Mac n cheese. I've had it as an appetizer and as a meal because they're so delishhhh!"
Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1383,3321,13851,3.0,5/2/2017,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location a number of times since it first opened. I remember when it did first open how overwhelmed I was with its stunning faux ruin décor, its high ceilings and leafed columns creating a whimsical of a temple in the lost City of Atlantis. And yes, I'm still impressed with it and of all the Cheesecake factories I've been at, this is the tops in interior beauty.  Now as to the food their specialty is of course cheesecake of which they have all sorts and verities, but they also have an extensive menu offering a lot more than that. They have all kinds of sandwiches, burger, steaks, chops and seafood. Having had a good number of their offerings over the years, I'd have to say very good. Some were in fact innovative like their kale and quinoa salad, but for me nothing really extra special in preparation, combination, taste or flavor; just solid good food.  It may just be my luck, but every time I've been here, the service has been incredibly slow, even when I am about the only one in the place. However, the service has always been polite and professional."
Max T.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,15,,1.0,1/1/2018,"This place is not even busy on New Year's Day, yet we waited for our food to be served for over an hour after seating down.  Then we ordered deserts, one of the orders was missing and the cheese cake was accidentally swapped with the table next to us."
Clarissa K.,"Hollywood, FL",2308,536,2059,3.0,1/22/2017,"So I read a lot of reviews not at this location but the others that all laugh about you probably came because you got a Gift Card. That's the group we fell in for this visit. So we figured Las Olas location is a step up from Aventura. Have not been back to this location for 10 years at least. Now that I have Yelp I will be able to refresh my memory on why not to come here when you have many other great choices on Las Olas.  We arrived a little after 10 AM when they open for Sunday Brunch. First we parked at a Public Parking lot one street North. As usual I pay the master meter for 3 hours because I don't need a surprise of a parking ticket. There is a walk through that will get you on Las Olas and cross the street and you have arrived right on the corner. You can't miss it as they all look the same decoration and that peachy color facade.  We asked for a table outside on Las Olas so we could people watch. Mostly homeless begging for money very sad. Anyway the service let's just cut to the chase was lousy as many other reviews will point out. My husband noticed two tables that arrived after us but we were all served at the same time.  So he waited for sugar, cream, and food.  To start I had a Peach Bellini it was ok but considering it was to contain peach liqueur and champagne mine was lacking either. My better half had coffee and he said it was ok.  For brunch I had the Monte Cristo and my husband Eggs Benedict with an order of load potatoes.  He loved the sriracha mayo served with it.  Mine was underwhelming and the hash browns had too much salt.  The unfortunate news is that we only used half the Gift Card so we'll have to come back to use the balance. This place reminds me why I dislike chains."
Dee B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",156,192,415,3.0,6/21/2017,"Much better service and food the past couple times we've visited. Competition must be fierce or something. I mean, we keep coming back for the cheesecake and risk being punished for the effort.  But hey.  A solid 3.5 stars for now. Maybe I'll round up the next visit. Okay."
Stephanie R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",254,168,690,2.0,4/18/2017,"Ok ok - I just feel that The Cheesecake Factory is TOTALLY overrated!  I've been to several venues and at different locations, but the experience tends to be the same - long wait, slow service, bland food, and overpriced.  With regards to The Cheesecake Factory on Las Olas, there is outdoor seating adjacent to Las Olas and indoor seating at booths, tables, or the bar area. Yet, there's always a wait. My last experience was poor - we waited about 45 minutes to be seating and, once we were seated at a booth in the bar area, the server took about 10 minutes to greet us since a tap had exploded in the bar (it was loud, messy and chaotic). When we were greeted by the server, she felt flustered, which is understandable, but then that mood created an uninviting and unpleasant experience for our party. Once we ordered, our food was delivered in about 20-30 minutes ... not too bad for the venue being PACKED! But, I couldn't help but notice the table of 4 sitting next to us that still hadn't been served their meals. It was a young family and I could tell the two boys were hungry and were getting anxious... the parents were patient and kind to the server but eventually asked for the manager. I felt sympathetic toward them but it only added to the already unenthused mood I was feeling. The food was filling but not worth the price - I have never thought The Cheesecake Factory was anything to rave about.   Overall - Don't bother with The Cheesecake Factory; rather, try another option that's more original on Las Olas, like Royal Pig, Big City Tavern, or Louie Bossi."
Aijaz H.,"Lisle, IL",9,104,,3.0,9/26/2017,I am usually a big fan of Cheesecake Factory but my experience last time was a bit disappointing. I ordered the Shrimp tacos first. Shrimp was way over cooked so I sent it back. I then ordered Chicken Madera which is one one my favorite dishes on the menu. Dish was fine but I didn't get my food for about 45 minutes. No apology from the waitress or the Manager. A bit disappointing.
Rey D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",122,28,10,1.0,12/26/2017,"Well what can I say, I have given this 2 chances, each time the food was beyond mediocre and not only that, do not follow directions. First off the Sheppards Pie is not a Sheppards Pie, its far from it, lets say its a combination of bad meat and bad veggies served as its a splat on a roof shingle. I've had REAL Sheppards pie, this is a poor substitute for a reinvention beyond awful. My partner ordered a Cobb Salad, well soggy lettuce does not make a salad. We said no egg, no avocados, but it seems the cook felt like adding them anyways. Poor order entry! As a business owner in the food field I know how to take an order, listen to the client and follow through in the kitchen. Granted this place makes its bucks and doesn't not care about reviews but I will still say this place has gone down hill, its typical corp food with no soul. But they keep doing good for people that are clueless on real food.  This place is not what it use to be.."
_Old Soul _.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,4,3.0,12/9/2017,"The wait time was a hour long. The food did not take a long time to come out. Three bowls of mac and cheese was order from my table and they were all extremely salty...I love mac n cheese but unfortunately I could not finish my meal. The server did their job. She remember everyone's oder without writing anything down. If you're a fellow mac n cheese lover, do not go here. Unless you enjoy salty salty mac n cheese."
Kristie P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,10,6,5.0,12/14/2017,This location is great! Food is fresh and our server Nikki was awesome! Love coming here :)
Bob J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",90,42,2,4.0,12/30/2017,"Had dinner with friends to celebrate a birthday. 6 of us. They sat us in the bar, it was very dark. While looking at the menus, it got darker????? My dinner, eggplant parm, 5 stars. Service was kind of slow because of the kitchen, i think."
Ben B.,"Wellington, FL",5,8,,1.0,12/30/2017,"After waiting for an hour to be seated we were informed our name was never placed in the list while we had a pager assigned to us.  After 30 more minutes we were seated with dirty silverware, dirty napkins and horrible service. We needed walking out because they never replaced the dirty silverware after TWO requests. The manager did not pay any mind and did not address the issue whatsoever. I have been to many of their franchises but have never been more disgusted than today!  The manager most definitely reflected the service in this establishment. ZERO STARS"
Veronica C.,"Boca Raton, FL",3,2,,1.0,11/19/2017,The service was too slow. We ordered a rare New York steak and came well done. We asked to exchange it and the second steak came salty.
Christy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",4671,1278,11725,4.0,7/16/2016,"Of all the Cheesecake locations I've experienced from Houston to St. Louis, this Fort Lauderdale location has impressed me the most. Located on the beautiful & trendy Las Olas Blvd, it's patio seating is ideal. However, if you are dodging Florida's scorching sun there's plenty of options indoors as well.  It's a chain sooooo...the interior décor is pretty standard to any other Cheesecake Factory. The hostess was pleasant and seated us immediately for lunch after asking if we had a preference.  Our server, who's name I can't remember but she was a doll. Very prompt, not too overbearing, personable and made sure our food arrived as we had specifically ordered it.    The Skinnylicious Grilled Herb Salmon is my usual plate, which was superb by the way. We also tried the mushroom lettuce wraps for the first time. They were ""different"" kind of like a lettuce burrito. I'm usually in hunger-mode so having to play with my food when it arrives didn't tickle my fancy. I opt for the dig-in method. Nonetheless we enjoyed both the service and our meals.  No cheesecake was had on this day, ~Christy"
John S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,9,,5.0,10/13/2017,"I've been to multiple locations in various states, but the manager at this location really went above and beyond. I had an issue early on at the host stand, and he and my server went completely out of their way to make sure the rest of my experience was an enjoyable one. Thanks again!"
Judy L.,"Concord, CA",17,17,26,5.0,8/27/2017,"Love our waiter Carlos B . Spoke a little Spanish to us with an edge. Food was delicious. Carlos kept our drinks filled without asking. Even told the manager about this, which I rarely do. A++ Carlos!"
Mike K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,16,,3.0,10/24/2017,"It's Cheesecake Factory, and the service always sucks haha especially during happy hour...good luck ordering then"
Michele D.,"Wayne, NJ",441,255,1079,3.0,12/6/2016,Nothing special about this Cheesecake Factory. Food was good and service was slow. Gets busy for lunch and dinner with all the tourists in the area(me being one of them). The menu here is huge and so much to choose from. I never have room for desert since their portions are really big. I always say leave room but never do. They have a larger outdoor seating area for when the weather is good.
Thomas M.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",61,26,5,1.0,12/9/2017,"Worst Customer Service & Food! I was staying at a local hotel very close to the Cheesecake Factory and decided to call ahead to order a pickup order. Called around 8pm at night and they said it would be 15-20mins till the food would be ready, not a problem. I arrived about 25 mins after calling to find out the food wasn't ready and it would be another 20-30mins till it was. I was informed they are busy with customers who are seated in the restaurant and they would get to my meal when they could. Excuse me? I'm pretty sure the money I have means and works the same as the money of those seated down inside the restaurant. I waited for my $20 Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken that I ordered. I asked if I could get a slice of cheesecake in addition to the meal and the employee's sarcastic response, ""You know you could have ordered the cheesecake when you ordered your meal but I guess we can just add it on?"" Pardon me, I'm sorry if it's such a huge inconvenience for you to do your job and cut me a slice of cheesecake and take my money. About an hour after I called in my order it was finally ready. Once I got back to my hotel I noticed that there was no bread included in the meal, which there always is, and there were 2, 2 whole pieces of chicken on my entire dish that I paid $20 for! Between the horrible customer service, over priced dish, and the food that doesn't come how it should, I'm over this place!"
Diva J.,"Atlantic City, NJ",0,33,69,2.0,9/4/2017,"We decided to stop here for Sunday Brunch. Sadly silverware was dirty. Asked for different and dirty yet again. Spoon was dirty. Mug with water was dirty. I think the issue is the dishwasher. Or the fact that no one checks after it's ""cleaned"". Everyone enjoyed their food. Although, we are not sure if it hit the floor or GOD's know where. Nice size portions for the money. Just make sure you check your silverware before eating here."
Joe M.,"Boca Raton, FL",128,488,26,4.0,12/29/2016,I generally avoid chain restaurants like the plague. Went because we were armed with gift cards. Twenty minute wait at 8:30 on a Tuesday night during Christmas break. Nice bar area to wait until we were called. My Old Fashioned was a bit on the sweet side but otherwise solid. Server was pleasant and knew the extensive menu. Always concerned about a menu which is too extensive. Had the guacamole dip and chips as well as edaname for apps. Guac was fantastic Decided on a chicken cutlet  entrée for my main and it was outstanding. Three large pieces of lightly breaded chicken with smashed potatoes and asparagus. So much that I gave one cutlet to my son. .
Argelia M.,"Hialeah, FL",98,149,414,4.0,6/24/2016,"I'm not a big fan of CF only because everything is so delicious, but crazy high in calories! I have eaten at CF many times and I've never had any issues with their food or service.  Today I decided to try the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (3 per order) and they were yummy. At only 250 calories (bonus) the chicken is topped with veggies, avocado, roasted corn salsa and a creamy sauce. They include a side of salsa if you need additional dressing.  I also tried the Fresh Basil, Tomato and Cheese Flatbread (330 calories). This was surprisingly delicious and the bread held up very well. The taste was on point and I was happy to have made a small dent of 580 calories to my day. Side Note:: this order was placed for delivery so I can't review the service at this location."
Sueheidi G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,3.0,10/26/2017,"We went there in October 25, 2017 at 6:00pm. The host Jeanette (or Ginette) was terrible. We asked for an outside table and the host, without saying anything and without even smiling. We have two strollers and she didn't even hold the door for us when we were following her to our table. On the other hand, our waitress Kaleigh, was very very nice. She was always asking if everything was ok and even talk with our kids. She was amazing and the food was good. As a suggestion, I will change the host since she is the ""face"" of the restaurant. She was so rude that we even think on going to another restaurant."
Karen W.,"Royal Oak, MI",124,526,591,4.0,3/13/2016,"Stopped in for dinner with my friend and we grabbed a table outside.  I was pleasantly surprised that the menu indicates which items are gluten free and they have plenty of options!  We decided to share some items, the beet salad, Evelyn's favorite pasta and of course cheesecake! The beet salad was excellent and nice and light. The pasta was also light as it was just an olive oil sauce with gluten free pasta, eggplant, broccoli, peppers and sundried to tomatoes. It was absolutely delicious. We ended with the Godiva cheesecake and holy hell was that divine. Talk about an amazing meal, and from a chain restaurant!  The only thing that could have used some improvement was speed. It took about 15 mins to get out drinks, the salad was out before the drinks  and our server disappeared and took awhile to get us out check. Otherwise, great experience."
Ron H.,"FL, FL",107,1,7,1.0,10/10/2017,"The waitress never gave me the bread, my lettuce chicken tacos had a hair and the waitress just take out, never a apologize, never a manager, I paid the bill like normal and also I went to the restroom before leaving and a employee put the apron on the floor while he pee, I feel really bad about this experience"
BaiYi L.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/2/2017,"Very disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory! It took them 20 min to serve one appetizer and another 20 min passed they came back to us that the Penni noodles will need another 15 min from that point! It really need to take them 40 min to figure out that they are not able to cook the Penni in time? To us this is a lie, possibly they ran out of it without admitting ! We expressed our disappointment and they didn't even try to do anything to make the situation better!  The restroom is also dirty and nasty, worst Cheesecake Factory I have even been to, EVER!"
Christina N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,1,4.0,10/12/2017,"Cheesecake is one of my favorite restaurants but we were a little disappointed after waiting nearly an hour for our food...the only thing that kept us from canceling the order and walking out was our waiter, Freddy! Great personality and he was very sincere about wanting us to have a good dining experience. We could tell it wasn't his fault, the kitchen was clearly backed up. We will definitely be coming back for him and that delicious shrimp scampi! (4 stars because of the wait)"
Estrella B.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",12,57,590,5.0,11/5/2016,The food and service were excellent  Expecially at the bar Although it was a Saturday night  We were served promptly at the bar  Star
John R.,"Columbia Falls, MT",8,102,78,3.0,5/10/2017,"Meh. The hostess forgot about us. We ended up sitting in the bar after waiting twenty minutes. Sat some more. Finally our lovely Prince look alike came over and it was all good after that. Bellini, bread, salad, cake. The Asian chicken salad is one I have loved for literally like what, 15 years?? It never gets old. Always delicious.  My sister ordered shrimp and pasta, gf. She loved it. We got the gf Godiva cake to go. Oh my. That was absolutely decadent. Soooooo luscious."
Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",936,1403,6924,2.0,1/22/2016,"Typically I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory primarily because I like places that give you free bread, large portions, and big cups to drink out of. I don't ask for a whole lot in life. That being said, after my last visit I may have to find a new place... Came in for lunch one day. Normal lunch rush, nothing out of this world busy. We were sat immediately at our table and waited for our server. And waited. And waited. And waited some more. Finally we found someone after a non exaggerated 10 minutes who said they would be our service. Note: they didn't say what happened to our server or if we were theirs and they just forgot about us. At this time we still had no water, no menu- nothing. Eventually we were given the items above and were able to get beverages and a few minutes later got to order. I had a simple Buffalo blast appetizer and fries- healthy, right? I am always a fan of anything made with Buffalo sauce and anything fried so in that regard they can't mess up. Our food arrived and our newly granted server stopped to check on us sporadically- I still feel like our person either quit or didn't want to deal with us because you could tell that this girl was not supposed to wait on us. The service was very spotty and we never knew who to go to when we needed something. Long story short it was over an hour and a half spent there on a simple lunch. Good thing I liked the person I was with and not dumping a date. We spoke to the manager about our experience and he apologized, offered us some cheesecake which we both declined. It wasn't about getting something for free. I could have had a meal that fed me in courses in the amount of time I spent waiting on some appetizers. I will think twice before going back for sure, especially if I'm on a time contstaint."
Rene S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,2.0,11/25/2017,Silverware was filthy yuk!!!! When advised the waiter it was as if it is a daily occurrence.
Bianca A.,"Ashe County, NC",1,53,31,1.0,2/24/2017,"This place is a joke. It took over two hours to get four dishes and one hot tea. The plates were pilling on our table, nobody came to get them. The waiter disappeared for a long time. It took 25 minutes to get my hot tea. The hostess rolled her eyes and refused to seat us because her computer said there was no table available, even though the patio was 2/3 empty. The food was mediocre, portions smaller than usual. We ordered brown rice, got white rice. The waiter was stoned and laughing so loud saying he forgot to put in my appetizer order. We felt like garbage sitting there on the stinky patio for over 2 hours. GET IT TOGETHER CHEESECAKE FACTORY!"
Lani M.,"Miami Beach, FL",7,13,6,1.0,12/24/2017,"This is a tourist trap. I did not have a good experience here at all. We chose to sit outside. They sat us outside and it was very dirty. It was like walking through a trash site. Garbage all over the floor. I thought the lighting would be somewhat romantic, but it was opposite. So we sat inside at the bar. Table was so dirty. They cleaned it. But it was still sticky. Mind you, the air was beyond freezing. So cold, the napkin blew away. I couldn't even eat my food I was so cold. It took forever for them to take our order. The bar was almost empty. Ok. So they took our order. Seriously it took 45 to an hour to get our food. I asked to substitute pasta for vegetables. They brought me the wrong vegetable and.....the food was COLD.  They told me they would bring me the correct vegetable. By that time I was already done with my meal. Just a bad experience over all. So disappointing because I love this place"
Jeanne M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",461,486,1414,3.0,5/28/2016,"After a very disappointing light meal on the beach, we needed some real food.  The Cheesecake Factory is always dependable.  We only needed something to top off what we'd just had, so my daughter and I decided to split an order of the nachos with chicken, while my husband opted for the French dip. Our order came out in a pretty short time.  The plate was piled with chips, guac, sour cream, salsa and cheese.  The chips were outstanding, very thin and crisp, just the way I love them.  There was an inexplicable sweet flavor to the dish, like there was just a drizzle of BBQ sauce.  While it wasn't objectionable, it wasn't what I was expecting.  The only real problem was that there were only about 5 small bites of chicken on the whole plate of nachos, which was disappointing considering how good the rest was. I wish I'd been able to try the low carb lemon cheesecake, but I figured we'd already spent enough between the two restaurants.  I've always been a fan of their cheesecake, especially the Godiva chocolate, but next time, that lemon is going down!"
Ann Robin H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",45,292,1813,4.0,2/16/2017,"We sat at bar, Laura was very nice. We had lunch hubby had the double cheese burger it came wit L/\T/ O plus FF and a small ramekin of ketchup. I had the Shepard pie with mushroom gravy. It was for me more mushroom the the meat. Don't get me wrong the flavor was delious but not much meat . It's done differently. Plus I also had the soup of the day Mexican?? Good taste lots of stuff in it."
