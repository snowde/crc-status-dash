David J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",13,13,3,4.0,11/23/2014,"Good place , food is always yummy , the staff worked their ass off to make sure we were taken care off! Prices are reasonable as well! Screw yolo , just come here ."
Angelo G.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,,1.0,1/3/2015,"Sadly, the worst service. Coffee cup dirty....took three tries to finally get a clean one and 15 minutes of trying. Server overwhelmed with a big table and ignored us. Manager eventually arrived and was sort of ""well what do you expect it's the holidays in FL"".  Expected better service from a well known chain. This location is definitely off the list. (Lunch/pm Friday 12/27/2014)"
Nutty R.,"Sea Ranch Lakes, FL",0,85,29,1.0,8/23/2015,"Worst location we've been to.  When we were seated, the server asked if we were ok.  We said no, we just sat down and had no menus.  He brought the menus and said, ""ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?"" and walked away.  It then took 20 minutes to get 2 drinks.  I could write a lot more but it's not worth it."
Anna T.,"Hollywood, FL",15,40,6,5.0,10/8/2014,Amazing in the inside made me feel like I was on the most romantic date ever and the food was fresh as well.  To bad I've never ate cheese cake from there I feel like it's a tad bit to over priced
Bastian P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",5,24,,4.0,12/16/2012,"We have been here one time so far but definitely will go back again. The food is great and we didnt have any issues with service as others had. The parking there is a different thing - you need to search a while until you find a space, but this location at las olas blvd is very busy and worth it. Would I go there again? For sure I would!"
Brandon S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",491,163,199,3.0,7/14/2014,I normally always enjoy the cheesecake factory but i feel as if they need a new fresh vamping of this location. Its looking and feeling a little old. Menu as well. Food is always good. Nothing special.
James C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",21,10,2,1.0,10/22/2015,"This maybe the worst restaurant I have eaten in over the past few years. I was there for a business lunch and was trying to eat lightly. Thus, I ordered the ahi tuna salad. The greens on the side were not fresh and drenched in a sugary dressing, the tomatoes were uninspiring and the ""wasabi pesto"" sauce on the thin pieces (4) was weak and tasteless.  I ordered wasabi, to spice up the tuna after scraping off the pesto, twice from two different servers and they finally delivered a powdery smear of ""wasabi. "". The service was amateurish - stacking plates, unpolished silverware and the ubiquitous ""you still working on that?"" A member of our party had asked for a dish without the sauce and sauce covered her plate. We waited over ten minutes for her correct order to come out. All in all, a wonderful reminder of a previous negative experience with this restaurant. Two strikes and you are out. Done."
Juan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,220,208,5.0,3/27/2013,"Bang bang chicken is a must have, this was were My amazing bestie took me for my last night before leaving florida and I can't thank her enough because it was a fabulous night"
Willow N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,20,5,3.0,6/24/2014,"It's all right, sort of. I've recently discovered that the best way to order in this restaurant is from the small bites menu, just get 2 or 3 of them. Otherwise, you're subjected to the usual heavy cheesecake factory fare. Extremely large plates with generally average food, prepared in a generally average manner. Service at this location is usually lacking, which considering that they put each server through a form of boot camp, is quite surprising. I've seen their training materials, you have to know pretty much every ingredient in every dish, so when my glass of coke sits empty for over 20 minutes I'm annoyed. Get an appetizer or small plate, and desert. The cheesecakes are all pretty good."
Bobby D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,2,,3.0,4/19/2014,"Food is mediocre at best. The menu is just too overwhelming, they have a little of everything and it is all pretty bland. My salmon tasted like water, no seasoning what so ever. Service was excellent however and of course the cheesecake was top notch."
Eduardo B.,"Miami, FL",116,12,65,1.0,10/5/2014,I Fucken hate  this restaurant I just ordered Meatloaf and it tasted like Dog Food. I returned and had nothing more. All I hope it catches Fire and burns down.
Tweety J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,30,,1.0,7/4/2015,I'm trying to plan a bridal shower in February for my daughter. There's gonna be about 15 ladies. I called the Cheesecake Factory on las olas. I was very disappointed when they said they couldn't accommodate our large party. They wanted to put us in the bar area for happy hour. Don't want that. I asked to put tables together in dining area. They said it would be to noisy. And I would have to order food ala carte. It seemed to me they didn't want my business. No problem. I will be happy to spend my money else where. I gave 1 star. That was being generous.
Rafael V.,"San Jose, CA",5,23,1,1.0,3/26/2014,"Worst customer service.  Had cheesecake with family from San Fran.  The lady behind the counter, Melissa, was rude and unprofessional.  We were shocked.  No wonder this has a low yelp rating.  Clearly poorly managed."
Bob J.,"Plantation, FL",0,38,,5.0,1/18/2015,Laurie waited on us did an excellent job. Very personable surprised no wait. They are such a great chain of 5 star restaurants.
Roro K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,8,,5.0,5/20/2014,"I previously complained about the reduced size of the Sunrise Buritto, my favorite breakfast.  I contacted CF on their websited, and got a callback the next day.  They state the reduced buritto size was an oversight and will correct the kitchen mistake, returning to the original size. They thanked me for my input with a gift card.  I'm back to being a fan."
Shane A.,"High Point, NC",466,340,313,3.0,1/17/2014,"This review is for a visit on Christmas Eve of this past year. (2013) To start, the location is super easy to find and get to and located in the heart of Las Olas.  They were packed and it was almost 8:00PM.  Upon registering for a table I was told it would be 20 minutes.  I was told this by the hostess that had a very insolent tone with each patron she interacted with. I started my ""20 minute"" wait and was able to speak with several folks that had been there over an hour that was told 40 minutes.  At this point, I just settled in for an hour wait.  I mean it's Christmas Eve at 8:00PM, what else are you going to do?!? We were finally seated after about 40 minutes and service was slow.  The wait staff seemed to be short and things weren't coming from the kitchen fast enough.  Most all the tables were frustrated with service from refills on drinks to bread and everything in between. The food (after a 30 minuted wait) was hot and tasted fresh but wasn't worth a 30 minute wait. The atmosphere seemed like most other Cheesecake Factory locations except this place was dirty.  Floors needed a good scrubbing and I am hoping that it was because of the short staff issue.   The menu is totally outrageous.  There are way too many items to read about before making settling on a dish.  It really takes a lot of time to read all the options and decide on something.  I would recommend deciding if you want fish, meat or poultry and then go to those pages and reading those items. Would I come back??  Probably, if it were Christmas Eve and the only thing open!  :)"
Liana P.,"Coral Gables, FL",5,26,2,5.0,11/16/2014,"I truly love this place. I went there last night (11/15/14) with my best friend and it was truly amazing. Our server was so sweet, our view was beautiful because the strip is beautiful and full of lights and we were siting outside glancing at it all. They have the best margarita pizza!! Their bread and butter (especially butter) is beyond delicious, and do try their Black Forest with pecan nuts cake its mesmerizing !! Also the waiting was literally 2 minutes where as the one in sawgrass was 30 minutes."
Jessica C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,11,2,1.0,9/26/2015,"My boyfriend and I went on 9/25 around 10pm and we were seated right away, however the table was DIRTY, my drink order was wrong, and no bread or water was brought out until we asked for it. Food was good and usually we have the best experiences dining with Cheesecake Factory, but I wouldn't come back to the downtown ft Lauderdale location, our sever wasn't the best. I felt like we were rushed to leave and ordered our desert to go."
Shandi B.,"Davie, FL",70,218,133,4.0,1/23/2012,"I might be in the minority, but I love The Cheesecake Factory, especially this location.  I most recently went on a Friday night at 8pm - and there was only a 15 minute wait.  At the Sawgrass or Pembroke Gardens locations, no doubt the wait would have been that plus an hour. As if their menu wasn't big enough, they have also added a couple of new menu types, including small plates and a skinnylicious menu.  It's pretty annoying to have to order the ""skinnylicious grilled chicken"", but it's really good so it's worth the awkward moment.  Last time I opted for the shredded chicken lettuce wraps, which were a really good bargain (three huge and already assembled lettuce wraps for $5). Also, my favorite dessert here is not cheesecake - but strawberry shortcake.  Buttery shortcake, super sweet strawberries, ice cream and their killer whipped cream.  I could just eat that and their sourdough bread and be super happy (albeit super fatty, which is why I don't, haha). Oh oh oh and I almost forgot to mention, last time I went I had to sit in the long bench booth, and next to our table for four was a table for two - except these two were sooooo in love that they just HAD to both sit on the booth side. It looked so uncomfortable, and the waiters had no clue what to do with their dinner plates, since two people don't fit so well on booth side meant for one.  Hilar."
Julia M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",59,115,41,4.0,1/12/2014,"A while back I read an article on the unhealthiest restaurant chains, Cheesecake Factory was rated the number one unhealthiest because one meal contained enough calories for one person for an entire day. That doesn't even include appetizers or desserts. But damn the food is delicious."
