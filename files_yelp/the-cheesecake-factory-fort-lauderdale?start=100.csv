Barry M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,1,,4.0,4/2/2017,Food is always consistent. Servers are nice. Outside patio is comfortable as it is on the west side off Los Olas. Don't eat on the north patio. Fumes from the cars and noise is not inviting. Prices are fair and you will not go away hungry portions are big.
David F.,"Queen Creek, AZ",29,18,,1.0,6/21/2016,"Stopped in while on vacation in May of 2016.  The restaurant had just opened.  We were sat quickly but when we looked at the silverware on the table, every piece was dirty.  Not just water spots but there were food particles on the utensils.  I checked the bread plates and they were also dirty.  On the bottom of one of the plates was a piece of carrot and a whole corn kernel. We spoke to the ""manager.""  He was very young and acted like we were bothering him with our concerns.  We demanded fresh, clean silverware and plates.  Lunch was OK...nothing great...just OK. We won't be going back there in the future."
Malia R.,"Dallas, TX",498,673,1405,1.0,8/21/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my top 10 fave restaurants. I feel weird even giving one a 1 star review. Tons to choose from, generous portions, reasonable prices, all that cheesecake? How can one not love the place? Fort Lauderdale's location has proven to me that all Cheesecake Factory's are not created equal. On the way there, I call to ask the best place to park, since we are unfamiliar with the area. The woman gives me an address of a place that when we get to, is $10 to park and super far from the restaurant! So we continue driving and find a place on our own, literally across the street for only $5. When we get in, they tell us 30 minute wait..but it ended up being 50 minutes. When the hostess walks us to patio table 238, it's dirty. It looked like the previous party had just left seconds ago! Food plates still there, drinks, yeah. So she tells us to wait and she was going to find someone to clean it. We literally awkwardly stood there by other peoples tables for what seemed like forever. Other servers, bartenders just walked passed us continuously and never said a word. Then I saw what looked like a manager headed our way so I assumed he would take charge. NOPE! It was as if we were invisible. He walked right past us! Of course I chased him down and asked him to fix this already horrible situation and he cleaned it up without ever saying a word to us. We sat and our server Julia D. decided to make an appearance approximately 10 minutes later. We placed our drink order and as she left our table, the next table over flagged her down and asked for something that they had ordered and not gotten. Her response, ""I'm not your server."" Not even an offer to locate their server. We are contemplating leaving at this point, but we make the mistake of staying.  As I'm looking through the menu, stray cats decided to join us. We sat outside, which was a nice setting until we saw the 4 or 5 cats chillin' just outside the restaurant patio door behind the drink station/bar area. And one who looked like he was contemplating jumping on our table. Now I'm an animal lover, but I can't imagine how unsanitary this is.  We finally get our drinks and they're just okay. The Asian pear martini is super sweet! Not my preference. She takes our food order and it literally took an hour to get it. She never checked up on us that entire time, I had to flag her down to request more bread and drink refills for my daughter. I also decided to ask her if I can speak with the manager and she says she will get him. Guess what? He never came!! Our food comes and it's delicious..but everything else was insanely horrible. But of course it would be horrible if the manager is nonexistent and doesn't give a care about anything in this place."
Lara S.,"Philadelphia, PA",85,116,5,5.0,6/18/2016,"Extra points for plopping a MASSIVE 'lunch sized salad' in from of my very proper, very English mother in law... She was so freaked out about the PORTION size of the dish that it kept her mind obsessively occupied for the rest of the holiday, enabling me to relax. Well done Cheesecake Factory. You gave her something to complain about, which meant I was 'off the hook' for a few days, and for that, I THANK YOU."
Kinjal K.,"Bangor, ME",63,43,27,3.0,1/22/2015,"I have been going to this location for a long time. It is one of my go-to places, especially with my coworkers.  The happy hours here are very inexpensive and well-rounded. You get a large selection of small plates/ appetizers for around $5. That is a great deal. Then amounts are big enough that one small plate is more than enough. Food quality here is always good.  The happy hour cocktails are limited, but still good.  The service here is always pleasant. They are sometimes very slow, but they make up for that in their quality of service.  The food is good and the prices are good. This is one of the food chain restaurants that I don't mind going to for a quick happy hour with coworkers. Nothing more."
Joe W.,"Johnson City, TN",0,6,,5.0,2/20/2017,Service was excellent we split the nachos and a chopped salad. A lot of food. FOOD IS ALWAYS EXCELLENCE
Israel C.,"Redding, CA",5,3,,1.0,4/12/2016,Typically a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. This one was an overpriced disaster of bad burgers and stale fries that made McDonalds look like upscale dining. Hopefully they can do better next time.
Zach N.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",669,16,10,3.0,1/14/2016,"The food is just fine, but the serving sizes are large. We shared the (entree) Almond Crusted Salmon Salad, some Coconut Curry dish (forgot the name), and Fish Tacos.  The first two were good, and I'd order them again, but the tacos were pretty terrible. My father said that he liked it, but it tasted bland, even with the garnishes. We took it home and I reluctantly ate one for a snack. It was a poor version of fish and chips, without the chips and wrapped in a tortilla with some pickled (I think?) cabbage. Good service, though, and really, it's a pretty safe place to eat. I wouldn't take a date here or expect the meal of my life from this restaurant. But a decent place to venture if you want something easy."
Ray C.,"Waterford Township, MI",0,7,,1.0,5/16/2016,"I have eaten at this Cheesecake Factory in the past and will eat there again, but last evening experience was not a good one. I am surprised that they allow smoking on their patio.  We had to wait for our table to discover we were seated next to two women who were smoking.  The smell of the smoke was terrible.  The server confirmed that smoking was allowed on the patio.  I encourage The Cheesecake Factory to change this policy. We had a bottle of wine which was fine.  Our server was very good.  I had ordered my meal cooked medium and it came well done.  There was no pinkness at all in my meat.  This has not happened in the past."
Denise N.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,9,3,2.0,12/26/2016,The Georgia peach drink was a winner but the wait service was mediocre at best. The food was ok (guacamole and dynamite shrimp). Nothing special from this chain restaurant experience.
mary w.,"Dallas, TX",16,48,10,4.0,3/20/2016,"Had dinner the other night. The manager who just relocated from Maryland and our server, (forgot their names) were awesome. We were greeted immediately by the hostess, and seated outside as requested. We had a small wait for our table,  but nothing over 10 minutes.    Salmon was better than the overpriced salmon I had at an ""upscale "" restaurant on the beach."
Shannon D.,"Boca Raton, FL",61,10,,3.0,7/9/2016,"The food was good, but the service was a little slow. Generous portions that are great for sharing or for taking home as leftovers. Make sure to save room for the cheesecake, especially the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, which is the best!"
Karolina K.,"Prague, Czech Republic",8,21,,4.0,3/27/2016,"This place is amazing and very popular for a great selection of cheesecakes. I have to mention again that I am not a cheesecake lover, but in The Cheesecake Factory is everything changed :). I ordered chocolate cheesecake and this one bit fed me for the whole day. The service was very friendly and polite."
Debra M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,7,11,4.0,10/18/2015,"Quick bite during the Las Olas Art Fair. Always good, great service and cool atmosphere. Today's weather is amazing, perfect for dining on the avenue watching the art lovers walk by."
Natasha C.,"Miami, FL",4,41,23,5.0,7/7/2015,I wish there were more servers like jonathan  in miami This guy knows his menu he knows how to please there customers  and is very polite and upbeat. Very good service overall

Joseph D.,"Lake Worth, FL",1,3,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Let me say that 1 star is more than it deserves. First off my girlfriend and I decided to come here for a nice anniversary dinner but what we got was a nice 20-30 min long wait mixed with a game of musical chairs.  We were first sat outside to a table under the overhang, which was dripping leftover rainwater onto the table (disgusting). Even more, our waiter could not be found. We were then moved inside to a table that was broken , and then moved back outside to the same wet table. It is not even snowbird season, there was no excuse for such neglect."
Jeannette G.,"Weston, FL",102,144,1070,3.0,5/29/2015,Quick lunch in between showing property. General consensus in our party of five was that the food was tasteless at best!  Service was great however. But we were annoyed by nats throughout our meal. Very info comfortable to say the least. Don't think we will be coming back anytime soon :/
Chris V.,"Hollywood, FL",4,73,61,1.0,2/8/2016,"Horrible service. This particular location is not up the the chain's standards. Our bread didn't arrive until after the meal was on the table. Our drink order was incomplete. The medium burger was rare, the rare one was well done. The coffee order was completely wrong, then the servers started arguing about the staff member who makes the coffee in front of our table. I will never come to this location again. I'd rather drive to the one in West Palm. Very disappointed."
Tony M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,1,1,5.0,8/26/2015,"You Hungry no problem baby, I'll have it delivered to you while i'm out of town Check Agapecakes in fort lauderdale for Desert. Omg!!!"
