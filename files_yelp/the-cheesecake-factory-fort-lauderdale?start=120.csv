Mike L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,17,4,4.0,2/25/2015,"It took me long enough, but I finally went to Fort Lauderdale staple.  I didn't know what to expect from CF, but I admit, I was surprised.  I was worried the prices would be a bit high, but I feel they were very fair. The food menu is respectable, and you should be able to find something for your pallet.  And although I wasn't saying ""wow"" to the food, I had to remind myself, the name of the place is Cheesecake Factory. And THAT is their specialty, without question.  And the cheesecake menu is huge!  There's like 6 or 8 pages of sweet, rich, bliss.  If there's one thing I could suggest, it's to go there for dessert."
Fiorella F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,23,98,2.0,7/3/2015,"The food was great I love the chicken Madera great taste and flavor. But the serve was really bad I had to complain about this restaurant cause it was my bday when we went to eat with my family and to be honest the waitress was not really take in care our table at all, we have to asked a lot of times to bring more Cooke and bread. But beside all the bad experience the food was good. I will choice another cheese cake factory to go another day  but definitive not this locations in ft Lauderdale las Olas was horrible experience. Don't go to this location if you have a special day."
Alexa A.,"Woodrow, NY",163,118,72,5.0,2/17/2016,Love this location especially since its florida. It was surprisingly empty and not packed. The service was great and the food was very good. Will be back soon. Try the sliders and go for happy hour
Mandy L.,"Manhattan, NY",392,383,71,3.0,12/14/2013,"Went here for lunch because I've never been to one! Pros: - The place was packed - but we only waited for around 5 min! - The sample cheesecakes were amazing + filling! - Really nice waitress! From Buffalo!  - Sliders were awesome - but they're sliders, they're supposed to be good already  Cons: - Cockroach-like bug was sitting right next to me - it wasn't pleasant  - Tomato pasta (forgot the exact name) did not taste so good :( - Pricey"
Sean L.,"Lewisville, TX",0,15,5,4.0,7/23/2015,Really can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. I've never had a bad experience. I ordered the chicken and biscuits. It was so good and SO filling. Our server never let my glass get empty. Just a wonderful time all around.
Ana Carolina C.,"Niterói, Brazil",0,1,,5.0,7/23/2015,"Great restaurant! Fair prices, excellent food and a very good service, as all the other Cheesecake Factories that we've been to.  My son, who is 10, loves it as well. We always look for a CF wherever we go on our U.S. vacations,  and we've never regretted it so far."
Shaena T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,19,7,1.0,12/9/2015,"Terrible experience! We were seated at a booth with filthy silverware as if they were never washed. We asked the waitress for plastics and gave her back the dirty silverware. All she could do was apologize. We also noticed that the silverware was placed directly on every table in the restaurant. Not wrapped in a napkin. Are you kidding me? That's so unsanitary. When we asked about it, her answer was that all the locations do that and it's to save time on wrapping them in napkins. I know that's bs. Even tho as we left, we noticed the silverware on the outside tables were wrapped in napkins. They also dim the lights too dark to the point where people were using flashlights to look at the menus. Free Bread was cold and hard, but the only positive was that our food was good. However I'm never coming back. I ate here a few years ago and didn't experience this! :("
Eric R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",76,32,18,1.0,2/3/2016,"Your food is horrible and every single one of your employees parks on my street which is a good 10 minute walk away, maybe you should pay negotiate something with the parking lot right next to your restaurant."
MT W.,"Seattle, WA",143,205,644,4.0,3/3/2016,"Located at las Olas Blvd along with all the shops, other restaurants and attractions.   We came in for a quick lunch and sat outside at the terrace. Ordered chicken Quesadilla, which was very rich. It was full of melted cheese and delicious with guacamole, sour cream and a salad. And one of their specialty - Eggplant Parmesan- that one was unusual. Looked like a meatloaf covered with cheese, marinara and pasta. The eggplants were cut and breaded, coated with different cheese and marinara sauce. It was served with delicate pesto pasta.  Quite a substantial and nourishing dish.  Being in this place we of course ordered a cheesecake for dessert. This time it was their signature Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Two in one I'd say. Very moisture, creamy and yummy. A great mix of red velvet cake and a cheesecake.  The service was slow, but we weren't in a hurry. Sometimes it's good to have a rest and enjoy a moment accompanying with a delicious food, but not very healthy though. You live once, what can I say, indulge yourself!"
Anastasia M.,"Orlando, FL",57,74,35,3.0,12/28/2015,Great food as always. I gave it a 3 this time however because the service was awful and it took forever for them to get our bill right. 'Twas annoying
Walid B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,81,22,4.0,3/27/2016,"A good spot for good food. It amazes me how consistent the quality is at this place, also how they are able to turn food quickly considering the size of menu they cater. This is the safe 4 star bet place when you are not feeling adventurous and looking for a sure thing. They are of course known for their huge portions and cheesecake. I find myself going there often for a lunch salad, or Sunday brunch, both never disappoint."
Keezi P.,"Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands",2,11,255,5.0,4/22/2015,This is the first time in 15 years I had NO WAIT AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY!! Excellent service!! Food came out super fast!!!
Marc L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",37,85,2,4.0,1/10/2016,"We have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years and we have always been satisfied with the service and food.  Today, we had the Beet & Goat Cheese Salad, and for our entrees, we had the Factory Combo with Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane, the Jambalaya Combo with Shrimp & Chicken, and our 6 yr old had the Kid's Menu Corn Dogs.  All were good, but the server kept disappearing on us. Would have been 5 Stars, but the service was a bit slow."
Katherine S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,15,3,1.0,4/2/2016,"I decided to try this Cheesecake Factory again. It was a weeknight around 6:30pm- about 68 degrees outside. My boyfriend and I walked up with our dog and I walked inside to ask for a table outside since we had the dog with us. The hostess stared at me with a blank look, then turned around and yelled at one of the servers to ask if he was working tables outside (keep in mind they have two separate porches WITH heaters by the tables). The server said no. The hostess looked around for a second and then told me, ""sorry, we're not seating anyone outside because it's so cold and nobody is waiting tables out there."" I was speechless. What? You're turning down customers because the 68 degree weather is too cold? My boyfriend and I usually get entrees, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks. So there goes at least $80.  I went outside to tell my boyfriend and we both noticed a table outside where a group of 4 people were being served. My boyfriend went in and tried to tell the hostess but she still refused to seat us since it was *so* cold. So we left and ate at American Social, which is phenomenal by the way.  As much as I enjoy the food (when it doesn't have glass in it), I will NEVER give this place my service again after being refused service."
Night Ryder I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,190,603,4.0,1/11/2015,"Lunch with the crew, preceded by the usual debate of where we are going to eat. Almost changed venue since  the pay by phone parking system now in the parking garage was such a pain to activate--What if you don't have a phone?  Note to Self: don't forget and leave phone back at the office. Anyway,  once inside we were promptly seated within five minutes. I chose the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. The others went with Chicken Caesar Salad, Shrimp Scampi and Fried Mac & Cheese. Everything was delicious. Lunch portions are still a lot of food. Fried Mac & Cheese is just plain sinful.  Wait service was better than my last visit, but not stellar. Could have checked back more frequently to refill beverages, brought check faster. Overall, good job."
Julien C.,"Uxbridge, London, United Kingdom",7,4,2,4.0,11/12/2013,"Great Food, OK Service, Amazing Desserts! I wish I didn't eat so much for my main course as I didn't have enough room for all my dessert. The menu is very bloated and takes some time to pick something."
Ftl S.,"Oakland Park, FL",0,13,2,5.0,6/10/2015,Having a great time and wonderful service  with Amber as our server and a great manager Kevin.  This is a great place for delicious food and service. Great Job here at The Cheesecake Factory!!!
Howard K.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",40,3,,1.0,4/8/2016,"Really bad costumer service. I waited twenty minutes to be served, then had to go to the manager to ask to be served. This the second time in less than six months I have had a negative experience there. If you love The Cheesecake Factory as I do, I would go to another location.This one is terrible and the staff are rude and nasty!"
Laura P.,"Boca Raton, FL",84,38,162,5.0,3/25/2014,"Plenty of times! I LOVE the food, location is excellent, prices are not bad very affordable. I love Cheesecake Factory!  I hope this time service is as good as always!"
Michele A.,"New York, NY",5,23,,1.0,12/30/2015,The place is too packed. I had to come back by the end of the night and the service was really really really slow! Unbelieveble how could they take that long to bring a piece of cheesecake that is already done! The coffe and hot fudge were already could by the time they finally brought it to my table...
