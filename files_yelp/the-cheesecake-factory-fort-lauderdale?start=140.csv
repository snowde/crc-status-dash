Wade M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",137,186,3,2.0,10/15/2014,"INCONSISTENT - OVERWHELMING MENU - STICKY FLOOR - DUSTY NAPKINS. I live a few blocks away, so my daughter and I have been going to Cheesecake a few times a month for 5 years. We've seen employees come and go. This is my first review. They're doing something right because they're generally full. I don't like the giant menu personally. I'd prefer a few dished from the land, the air, and the sea. I leave it to the chef to pick which ones will delight me most. The service is generally friendly and efficient enough, but they have too-frequent lapses. This week, we arrived to an empty restaurant at 7pm, and still hadn't been served at 8. We left. That's bad service on any planet. I have 2 pet peeves I've entered in the Anything else part of their surveys. 1) The floor is disgusting. It feels like it has a thin coat of Crisco on it. Maybe that's fun for the 10-year-olds pretending to ice skate around, but to me it makes the restaurant seem filthy. 2) The napkins leave my lap covered with white napkin dust. When I remember, I ask for a black napkin, but we put a man on the moon, traveled twice the speed of sound, and correct near blindness with disposable contacts. Do you think you could pick a fabric that I can use to wipe my mouth without shedding napkin dust all over my lap? The food is good enough. The portions are generous. Period. I think I've tried about everything, and nothing is really unique and special, and if there is, it can't be found on the overwhelming menu. I'm not a big dessert eater, so I'm not seduced by the case of delicious-looking cheesecakes (maybe once a year). If you are, you should definitely not go here. The momentary pleasure of a pound of cheesecake doesn't offset the discomfort and long term penalty. Unfortunately, Las Olas doesn't offer many good options, so I'll probably see you there."
Brian W.,"Houston, TX",112,131,77,3.0,12/24/2014,This is a dog friendly restaurant on Las Olas.   Bread was fresh right out of the oven.  I like sitting outside here during the winter.  I usually get the Mexican salad or enchiladas of the Skinny Lisicous menu.  The food is consistent but the service can be slow at times.
Daniela D.,"Miami, FL",36,7,,2.0,3/25/2016,"The restaurant was dirty, all the floor was oily, the fork were dirty, all was messy. The waiter was very kind. The did not serve the desert because i had already close the check, quite amazing that in the Cheese Cake Factory you cannot take your cheesecake home. The food was very good, but the over all experience was pretty bad."
Suzanne P.,"Miami, FL",88,108,355,3.0,11/3/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has always been one of the ""better"" chain restaurants in my humble opinion.  With that said, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants.  Service is typically mediocre and so is the food. We ended up here after the overly crowded Ft. Lauderdale Boat Show.  Our first choice had an hour wait and I was HANGRY!  After a 5-10 minute wait, we were seated.  And we waited, and waited, and waited. Our poor waitress was overwhelmed and it was noticeable.  Service was good but very, very slow.  I blame management, as she was doing her best juggling all the tables she had.  Food was good, not great.  Consistent with CF's quality and oiliness.  The Oreo cheesecake though, I must say was heavenly. I don't plan on visiting CF anytime soon, unless I'm HANGRY and other restaurants have a long wait."
Adriana G.,"Miami Lakes, FL",35,79,80,2.0,6/19/2016,"Came here for Father's Day with my hunny and was very surprised to have been seated under five minutes. We were both extremely hungry as we had been trying to find a restaurant without an extremely long wait. We were seated, our waitress came to our table and asked what drinks we wanted, brought us soft warm bread, and took our order in a timely fashion. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and my hunny ordered steak tacos. It took FOREVER though before our food actually arrived to our table which was disappointing , especially since the restaurant wasn't packed or anything. Perhaps they were understaffed? Who knows. Anyway, i saw our waitress and asked her for Parmesan cheese (which was right there! Like she was standing right next to it!). She said OK but instead, sent someone else to bring me the cheese instead. That was strange. We also didn't get a drink refill till we were almost done with our meal so that wasn't great as well. I love the Cheesecake Factory & we frequent it however , this particular location probably isn't one we will come to again anytime soon."
Hoilda B.,"Hialeah, FL",56,102,126,5.0,1/12/2013,"If you decide to have a late lunch on a Sat. in Las Ola's Blvd. this is the place to go, no lines no waiting. Honest Employee's! WOW WHAT A DAY!  While visiting the area of Fort Lauderdale today, we stop here for lunch. I was so happy there was no wait time and our server was great. We were all graving burgers and that's what we all had. The burgers were nice and juicy and the fries were hot and crispy. Great food, great time. until we got home and found out my daughters purse was left in the restaurant. OMG I honestly thought it was gone. I approach to call the restaurant just for the heck of it, thinking it was gone, To my surprise I spoke to the manager in charge (sorry I forgot her name) and she was wonderful! After she ask me  few questions, she inform me it was there. Wow what a relief! I must give this Cheesecake factory a five star for three reason, honest employees, great food & great service.   Thank You Cheese Cake Factory in Las Ola's Blvd."
Casey Á.,"Raleigh, NC",126,78,1,1.0,4/28/2014,"WINNER: WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE (So far... there are more years to go) The Cheesecake Factory is what it is, unless you go to this one. Although our server was extremely kind, she had to spend all night making up for the mess the Kitchen & Bar Staff laid on us. I'm not even going to go into details, I'll just list most of the things wrong for time's sake. 1. It took a good 45 minutes to bring one drink from the bar. 2. My dinner was missing two key ingredients (including all the sauce) as well as the side salad that came with it. 3. The side salad took another 30-45 minutes to arrive after a second request for it. 4. My favorite part... Halfway through my drink from the bar I FOUND A FOOT LONG BLONDE HAIR HALFWAY IN MY DRINK. Ah wonderful considering I have short brown hair and my wife has nearly black hair. Thanks for the little extra, bartender. Don't go to this location, no matter what. You are on Las Olas, you can find 15 places better by looking right, then another 15 by looking left."
Jo W.,"Miami, FL",176,335,1441,4.0,9/24/2012,"I like discovering new places but one of the few chain restaurants I actually like going to is The Cheesecake Factory. If you think of chain restaurants a few probably pop up in your mind, but Cheesecake Factory is at the pinnacle in this genre of restaurants. Once you step inside The Cheesecake Factory, you almost forget that this is a chain. The feel of the restaurant is similar to that of a fine dining establish but is obviously at an affordable price. What I love most about The Cheesecake Factory is the staff. If you have even been and I am pretty sure you have, Cheesecake Factory has this huge book that they call a menu. No matter what location I have been to, I swear all the servers know the menu inside and out, and if you can study and remember their menu, you earn my respect. Everyone, from the hosts to the servers, is upbeat and friendly. One of the perks of The Cheesecake Factory is the complimentary bread. You are usually given a sourdough loaf and a wheat loaf. I am not a fan of the sourdough and usually requested just wheat bread. The wheat bread is not what you would typical expect wheat bread to taste like. It is really good when it is fresh out of the oven. My favorite dish at Cheesecake Factory is the Jambalaya Pasta. I'm a spicy addict, so I usually at lots of crushed red pepper to it but even without that, it is delicious. My other favorite is the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club. This sandwich is good as you know what, but it is also one of the more fattening things on their menu, so whenever I get it I usually only eat half and share, but trust me it is really really good. Another one of my staples is the Strawberry Lemonade. It is definitely good but can be a little too sweet at times. They also have really good cocktails here so while most people come for the cheesecake and the food, you really have to consider trying one of their cocktails.   I wanted to try something new and a little bit healthier, so I decided to get the Ahi Tartare. Although it was among the small plates, considering the large portions at Cheesecake Factory, I thought it would be bigger. It was pretty small but very good. The tuna and avocado were fresh and the Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce was the perfect complement to the tartare. My only complaint was that I wish it came with more tortilla chips. I was trying to be conservative with my calories this time, but I do recommend the Godiva Chocolate, Oreo Extreme and the Adams Peanut Butter Cup cheesecakes. I am a chocolate and sweets addictive so if you are not into that, these choices are definitely not for you. I am pretty sure everyone has been to a Cheesecake Factory at some point in their life, so my only suggestion would be to experiment. Their menu is so extensive that you should try to taste something new every time."
Ashley C.,"Marco Island, FL",198,89,134,3.0,9/25/2014,From my last horrible review the manager comped our whole meal and was very apologetic so I will bump it up a little...
Stefanie H.,"Cologne, Germany",11,86,142,2.0,5/14/2015,"We went here to try one of the many cheesecakes. The menu for that was huge. The cake itself great. But .... Having cake and seated by the kitchen does not fit. Having the smell of other dishes while having coffee and cake. Also the service was very slow. The cappuccino arrived when the cake was almost finished. It seemed as our service lady just wanted us go as fast as the check came. There even was no wifi which is kind of funny. Maybe they do not want people to post immediate about their experience. I heard great things about this chain, but better try another place."
Jerry P.,"Hovedstaden, Denmark",12,45,13,1.0,10/21/2015,"really really bad service level. We were cut in line, pointed it out to the staff and were ignored. We desided to leave so didn't get to taste the food."
Diane S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,28,19,2.0,10/21/2015,"This is a very lovely restaurant. However beyond that I was disappointed. I ordered a ribeye which came with cold fries. The steak was very grizzly and disappointing. After we received our food I had to wave our waitress down to get a knife, salt and pepper and a refill on our drinks. We sat in the bar area which was lovely but there was no music playing at all which gave it a very sterile feeling. If we come back it will be for the cheesecake alone."
Natalie J.,"Miramar, FL",120,86,70,1.0,3/28/2015,I used to be a Cheesecake factory fan when i was a teenager... But well after being a foodie not anymore. The service is poor and slow. Food took forever to come out. We just ordered a margarita pizza and a chicken quesadilla. How u can go wrong with this 2 simple plates? Pizza was tasteless and the chicken quesadilla was son bland. We dont even ate it.  Food should have compensated the poor service.
Joy L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1147,328,1776,3.0,2/14/2014,"During different times, the service at this place is completely different.  If you are looking for a great dinner dining experience- then this is a viable option.  The service is fast even with a large party, and the food is pretty decent.  Unfortunately, if you work in the area you should probably skip this place is you need to get in and out on your lunch hour.  I've been here several times for lunch- and it is a toss-up as to if you are served in a timely fashion or not. This past experience is most likely the worst.   We arrived and were seated relatively quickly, which was completely misleading.  We sat down and no one came to our table for at least 5+ minutes, which when you are on a time crunch for lunch, every minute counts.  We asked another server to send someone over, when our server arrived she was frazzled, and asked for our drink order.  I asked for a small cup of juice for the baby- this was the only item that came quickly- but it was very watered down.  We had to ask for bread several times.  It took another 5 minutes for her to come back with hot tea selections.  We ordered immediately, and then waited, and waited, and waited- the whole lunch hour gone, and no food.  We complained, the manager came over - and apologized.  When our meals finally arrived we had to eat very quickly.  We asked why so long, and were told that there were many new menu items, which were overloading the kitchen.  I would have given this warrant except this is not the first time that the service has been extremely slow during lunch.   The manager seemed to know how upset we were, and comped part of the meal.  A very nice gesture- I think that we will stick to coming here only for dinner."
Nicole C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",126,17,2,2.0,9/6/2015,"Cheesecake factory has been around forever! I can remember growing up and loving to go there with my family when I lived in new york. I recently went there for dinner and I was unimpressed. My chicken was very dry and my mashed potatoes were soaked in butter. The service was decent but my waitress seemed very in a rush. I used to love going there just for their cheesecake! They used to give you a nice big piece that you could share with your partner. It seems portion sizes slimmed down and prices went way up. I still love their cheesecake, it's the best in town but $10 for a small plain piece is just a little ridiculous."
J S.,"Knightdale, NC",0,37,2,1.0,12/12/2015,I don't eat at Cheesecake Factory often but I might not ever eat here again after this experience. The food was undercooked and the items that weren't were burnt and dry. I'll definitely never eat at this location EVER again.
Sharon K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",23,7,,2.0,6/19/2016,"I'll give 2 stars. Service was excellent. Everyone's food except mine seemed great. Everyone else had steak or pasta. I ordered ""Tuna Tataki"" salad. Color wasn't right on tuna. Kind of grey. I shouldn't have eaten it but I did. Now I've been sick all day, throwing up & diarrhea. Normally really like this restaurant, maybe just a bad night. But I am quite sick today."
Jason M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,5,,1.0,11/15/2015,"Slow service , no drink refills , food had clearly sat under the warmer , second time I've had a bad experience here - save yourself the headache and go to a local joint down las olas  Nothing is worse than a manager on their phone texting when you're trying to get their attention"
Sally F.,"Greenville, SC",0,9,,3.0,11/1/2015,Gave this a three stars for the food and our server only. Our server was very polite and nice but he seemed way over sat because he took a while but that's not his fault. The hostess was very rude and dismissive to us and the other guests. The server that took us to our table gave off the vibe that we weren't welcome in the restaurant and we watched as the other employees went about their shifts rolling their eyes and not smiling towards customers. I did not feel welcomed.
M. V.,"Vancouver, WA",0,4,,2.0,6/6/2016,"The only time I have ever been to a Cheesecake Factory (and I have been to many of them), and thought it was a bad meal. I had a salad and fries. After it taking 30 minutes for our meal (we were there between lunch and dinner), my salad only contained half the ingredients listed.  Our waiter took the salad back to retrieve the left items, but it was still without dressing, etc.   our waiter was great, the food subpar, at best."
