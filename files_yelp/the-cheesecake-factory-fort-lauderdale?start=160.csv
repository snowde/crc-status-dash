Quality K.,"Atlanta, GA",1,48,1,1.0,8/11/2015,"Not the right spot to eat! Got harassed by riffraff coming to the table wanting us to buy Starburst Candies. We didn't buy and we were received with threatening profanities. The waitress Sidney said its not her problem, it's Kevin the manager who needs to handle panhandlers and others coming into the restaurant to disturb guests for money. Very threatening and NOT SAFE!! Manager said he was busy doing other things and refused to do anything about it. Cheesecake Factory has LOST our business!!"
Carol A S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,33,1,4.0,10/24/2015,"Our out of town guests arrived quite late this past Wednesday night and Cheesecake Factory saved us! Their posted hours stated open till 11:30 p.m., and they were! Not only that the service was delightful, the bar service quick, and, the food came out perfectly cooked.   Even though we were the only table in the entire restaurant, no one rushed us to finish up in order for them to close earlier than posted.  We really appreciated their exemplary service and adhering to their posted business hours with a smile.  Anyone with late arriving visitors, Cheesecake Factory is the first place to go for a great meal!"
Yesi Q.,"Miami, FL",84,35,9,4.0,6/30/2015,I'm not feeling the prices. But the chicken alfredo was delicious I must say. I didn't expect it to be as good as olive garden. The spaghetti and meatballs was also very delicious. The regular cheesecake with strawberries is divine. I'm really happy with this place. Can't wait to come back I just wish it wasn't so expensive lol
Lena M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",237,9,,1.0,2/23/2016,"Came in for a lunch meeting ordered shrimp Alfredo, waitress made a mistake she brought out chicken Alfredo which is fine but I did not have time for them to remake the whole dish, especially given that it took them a full 30minutes to get the food out to us. she offered to get shrimp that I can add to my pasta at an Additional charge.... She had the manager ""Kenneth"" come over cause she clearly did not know how to handle the situation he was extremely rude immediately treating me as though  I was a huge problem, he offered to make the dish complimentary I accepted then he ran away with my food! I had to get his attention again cause as a guest at an establishment such as The Cheesecake Factory I came for lunch and yeah I didn't get charged for lunch but I also didn't get to have any due to the screw up on their account and he was even having a huge problem issuing a gift card that I could at least use on a different day since I didn't get to eat today... I'm never going back to this Cheesecake Factory, I'd rather drive all the way out to the Boca location where I know I'll be treated with outstanding customer service and not have to deal with  fake/rude employees."
Dmitrii K.,"The Colony, TX",1,10,28,4.0,10/23/2014,"I ordered a factory burger , taste okay ( meat was not that good ) ! My son ordered the Red velvet Cheesecake , taste so delicious !!! Service can be better , recommend to go with kids ! For romantic dinner ,it's not a good place !"
Mayra D.,"Weston, FL",1,8,,1.0,3/26/2014,"I usually love to go the cheesecake factory , Melissa was very rude to me and my family we tried to tell the Manager and he just dismissed. Poor customer service!"
Elizabeth R.,"Miami Beach, FL",318,266,721,3.0,12/22/2013,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about The Cheesecake Factory?  Whenever I want to go to a place and ingest a minimum of 1000+ calories, this is where I go.  The food is normally tasty and consistent - but it better be if I'm going to blow my entire daily calorie allowance on a plate of food.  The free warm bread and butter never disappoints (and I enjoy dipping it in the New England clam chowder on Fridays).  The portions are just out of control HUGE and laden with butter, oil and calories (probably did not need saying again).  If I was ever able to eat an entire piece of cheesecake, I'd probably go into cardiac arrest.  But alas, this is what makes us come back for more.  Where else do you get plates so full of food, they could feed a small village in a third world country for a week?"
Mari M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,5,2,4.0,5/21/2016,Always reliable for good food and great desserts. I had the egg roll sampler for the first time and it was delicious. Will definitely have that again. For my entree I ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wraps which is an appetizer but for me is a filling meal. It's great for sharing or just as your main course.
Ann S.,"Rumson, NJ",1,58,30,2.0,3/19/2015,"We sat outside - 6 adults, 2 kids and a dog. Dogs water never came. No mint as no mojitos. Soooo long for dinner. My sister and I each ordered the beet salad and split a flat bread. No salad for her. Finally the waiter came over Oh I thought you were splitting the salad. Too late now.  Our waiter never checked back after the food was served so we could not tell him about the missing salad. He was no where to be found. Then is was too late. We all shared with my sister. Ordered dessert - no strawberry shortcake - 15 minutes for biscuits. Very nice manager came and offered to take off the items we did not get???  Dinner took from 5:30 to 7:45. Not our usual experience at our local  Hackensack  CF. We just picked the wrong place. All the other restaurants in the vicinity were having Happy Hour - not here. We had drinks - drinks in half sized glasses at $11 each - with lots of ice!"
Matteo M.,"LaSalle, Canada",1,54,39,1.0,6/15/2015,This resto has always been a favorite but the service ruined this location. My family was down last year and had an argument with the waitress. I won't get into details. My wife and I drove from pompano beach just to get a piece of cake for home and the waitress at the counter was the most miserable I have seen in a while. As if we were bothering her to just buy a piece of cheesecake without even asking her one question and being as polite as I normally am. I went to the bathroom while my wife waited for the order. Once it was ready she literally threw the take out container at her. I have the receipt and will be contacting the store directly. Being in the resto buisiness myself she would have been terminated on the spot and the managers need to know what and who are working for them
Marie L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",76,27,,5.0,12/26/2015,"Haven't been to Cheesecake in a while, and the family decided to go here tonight. Good choice. It was PACKED and there was only a 20 minute wait, they got us in in just under that time and it was pretty impressive due to just how busy they were. Our server was great, should have thought to get her name. She got to us quickly, was very friendly and got our order perfect. Dad got a steak and mashed potatoes, he said they were both excellent. Mom got the chicken Madeira and she said at least 4-5 times how great it was (I have now been asked to make it for her birthday dinner, which is in a few days. Although I may sneak and do takeout so it turns out perfect for her lol ) and I got the garlic pasta. It was very simple but it was just so great. I will absolutely be getting it again next time. We were too full for dessert unfortunately, but perhaps on our next visit. The return back will definitely be asap due to how enjoyable it all was tonight."
Ashley N.,"Miami, FL",2,9,,5.0,6/30/2015,"Awesome variety of entrees and cheesecakes on the menu. Could get overwhelming. Clean, great Location, awesome service and food came out fresh and hot. I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory franchise but this one by far has had the most friendliest servers and hostesses! Not to mention the drinks are awesome! My favorite is Asian Pear Martini"
Stephen C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",182,171,626,5.0,12/25/2014,This is one of my favorite cheesecake restaurants.  Not sure if it's because of the vibe of the las olas area but this place atmosphere is happening. For the most part everything else is your typical Cheesecake Factory except for the service which seem to be better than most.  Anyone who has been to any cheesecake will tell you they are known for their extensive menu and large take home portion.  Not saying the ladder is a bad thing.  Sometime the size of the menu may prove to be challenging and forget it if you are indecisive you will never order lol. But in all seriousness the food is always good with one of my favorites being the meatloaf.  You can't say you been to the factory and not ordered a cheese cake or giant slice of cake.  My all time favorite cheese cake is the Dutch Caramel Apple cheesecake.  It's like eating an apple pie and a slice of plain cheesecake at the same time.  Must give it a try!!
Mauricio B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",122,254,1677,4.0,2/10/2012,"Excellent service. We had a problem with one of the entrees (grilled salmon), but the manager came out and offered several options to fix the problem, and she did. If you like spicy food, the Buffalo Blasts (shredded chicken with cheese and a hot buffalo sauce) is a great appetizer."
Alex R.,"Hollywood, FL",3,21,29,4.0,6/6/2015,"Come on it' s cheese cake..... they are all the same, it is what it is. Get your cheese cake and over sized plate of food. Side note their mojitos are pretty good."
Elaine C.,"Boca Raton, FL",224,177,709,2.0,8/18/2013,"I've eaten here many times with absolutely no problems. My waiter today was excellent. I don't know what was up with the kitchen staff though. I ordered steak and eggs. I ordered the steak done medium well. When that steak came to me, it was practically mooing. Yuck. I asked them to make more eggs for me instead, done over medium. They came to the table partially burned. The manager did the right thing by comping my meal. But still, your kitchen staff needs to pay more attention."
Amie B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",49,56,29,5.0,1/26/2014,"Lunch today was delicious.  Sunday afternoon the sun is bright and the outside seating was serene. Lorraine was iur server and she was verry attentive. You can tell the restaraunt is busy and she took the time to converse with us a few tines and bring us everything we needed very efficiently. Its hard to find good workers and servers in this industry and she made us feel very comfortable.  Jordan, also takes care of us on a regular basis and he is knowledgeable and kind.  This is such a good place with good food and most importantly good service!"
Elena D.,"Dania Beach, FL",0,2,,2.0,7/17/2015,Just had lunch here and ordered me the lunch portion of the grilled salmon on top of a Cesar salad. Not sure how they could mess up the order but waitress came back with totally different meal. Then it took 20 min longer to get my original order. Today the cheescake staff not on point!
Erica G.,"Tampa, FL",152,168,72,4.0,2/15/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory in my hometown many times, so I am familiar with the menu and the chaos of the restaurant.... I was surprised I was able to walk in and seat myself at one of the high tops in the bar, even though there were many people waiting to be seated somewhere in the restaurant. The kitchen was struggling that night and it was very obvious because it took almost 25 minutes for our appetizer to come out. Our server was extremely polite and apologetic about the wait time. He brought us bread and kept our drinks filled at all times. The stuffed mushrooms and spicy shrimp apps were great and so was my traditional cheesecake with strawberries. I am giving 4/5 stars because of the other servers who were gathered by the side station in the bar nearest to the patio entrance/exit. One server in particular was extremely upset and wasn't quiet about vocalizing how much she disliked her guests outside. The conversation was too loud and should have been discussed in a more private location."
Howie A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,9,2,3.0,8/21/2014,"I never considered the Cheesecake Factory to be the best restaurant so today , I when on my birthday I when with my parents and brother , firstly the table we wanted was covered is stuff but they were nice another thing near the entrance there is the hostess stand ,, near that is a plant and the leaves of the plant block the whole left side of the stand so you have to go around,, our waitress who's name was Cindy was very nice and professional ,  she knew the menu and she was very pleasant after Ordering , we waited very long and we received our food,  our food runner was asking who got the certain plate but I had no idea what he said but we sorted that out,, after I got my jumbo I noticed it was nearly Inedible due to the fact it was drenched in oil ,, I sent that back and settled for the cheese cake I got the mango key lime and it was fantastic"
