Tamar G.,"Stadel bei Niederglatt, Switzerland",0,13,40,5.0,8/11/2015,"We love it!! Nice and lovely waiters, great food! Every time we are in Ft. Lauderdale we come back and have dinner in the Cheesecake Factory!"
Gloria S.,"Naples, FL",382,817,2362,2.0,6/12/2011,"You better be on vacation AND not hungry because you will not get out of here for hours.  Hope you paid your bills for the month and wrote your will before you walked in the door. Who knows when you can escape? Staff nice ... when we get to speak to them.  Food good ... when it finally arrives. Kid's meal will come last, about 60 minutes after the last order. And this is lunch? Hate to see what happens for dinner. We were desperate thus we came, with all the great places down the street, we had our reasons... another story, another time.  However, desperate or not, not re running this show."
Erin C.,"Plantation, FL",165,4,2,1.0,4/13/2016,"Was at this location tonight. We were sat right away but before we even got out drinks we saw a  roach crawling across the ground. The service was really slow we waited almost an hour for apps. The salad my friend ordered was wrong twice and they still didn't fix it. The managed uttered a ""sorry I don't know what happened"" while fiddling with his shoes( taking one on and off while talking to us). I was not impressed, it didn't ruin all locations for me, but I won't be returning to this."
Lori J.,"Atlanta, GA",2,21,3,2.0,1/16/2015,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations over the years, however I must say this particular one is horrible based on my visit. I saw my waiter a total of three times: Once to take my order after asking him to come over and do so, a second time to bring drinks, and a third time to bring the check. Not once was I asked if I needed anything. The food was just as horrible as the service. Bread was stale and my meal tasted like it was reheated after sitting for a while. I had never experienced bad food and service at The Cheesecake Factory until visiting this location."
A K.,"Scarborough, Canada",57,81,3,4.0,2/13/2015,I don't see why others are giving this location poor reviews. This is a standard cheesecake factory location with good food. You know exactly what you're getting here and the service is on par with about every other location I have visited in the past.
Juan G.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,2.0,4/13/2016,"I'm an easy going diner and very rarely leave bad reviews. But my experience here deserves worse than what I'm leaving. My wife and I ate here last week. First, they got my wife's drink order wrong - kind of made it like it was our fault ... then both meals they brought were practically inedible. The only thing that was actually good was the complimentary bread. My wife had the pasta carbonara, and I had a Margherita pizza, both pretty simple and basic dishes. The sauce for the pasta was burned so bad that you couldn't even bear to smell it, and my pizza was so bland and had nothing on it. I didn't even bother to complain, we just paid and left. I'm sure the restaurant would have offered to take care of the check, especially being a chain, but I was disgusted that they would even serve it to me. I only leave 2 stars because the staff was friendly, and overall the place is clean and nice. Probably just a bad night for them, but pretty bad!! I've eaten here many times and will probably give them another shot..... but it won't be soon."
Adasis B.,"Miami, FL",22,5,1,2.0,4/13/2013,"For starters, I have been to various Cheesecake Factory restaurants and have never had a complaint, until now. We ended up at this restaurant when a neighboring restaurant gave us a ridiculous wait time for a party of 9- granted, it was a Saturday.  The waitress was friendly at first and took our orders immediately; however, one of the member's of our party never received his food, The manager was beyond apologetic and offered our friend a complimentary cheesecake.   I ordered my usual- the Famous Factory Meatloaf with a side of their Macaroni and Cheese. Once my food arrived, I realized that they sent over what seemed to be a box recipe version of macaroni and cheese. I told the waitress that this wan't the one I ordered and even specified that it was the one served in the cast iron pan, topped with bread crumbs. Next thing you know, they brought back what I thought was my side and then discovered that they simply poured the 1st mac 'n cheese into the right cast-iron bowl and drizzled it with shredded cheese. At that point, I was so annoyed that I just waited for the waitress to retire my plate to then complain about my food.  I will stlck to my other Cheesecake Factories from now on."
Shirley T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,38,14,5.0,9/30/2014,"My experience is always pleasant here.  The Cheesecake Factory is one of my top 10 fave restaurants.  A great server to me is key to your dining experience.  During the summer this location to me is always busy.  I do not come here often but when I do, I always try to get here before the night crowd.  Ask for Steven H. when you go here.  You won't be disappointed.  He was a great server and very attentive."
Taheisha L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",136,29,12,4.0,2/13/2015,"I always sit at the bar. It's not as busy as other cheesecake factories which is good for me. He bartenders are consistent, friendly, and the food is as well. It is slow at times but the employees do very well so you don't mind as much."
Stephen O.,"Austin, TX",280,111,194,4.0,5/11/2011,"Wow, there are a lot of people giving this place a hard time.  I'll start with what we didn't like and work backwards -- so once the sun went down the lights inside were much too dim, we didn't say anything but we heard the table next to us offering the same complaint.  Apparently the lights are on some sort of timer and couldn't (or wouldn't?) be adjusted.  We also noticed a couple right outside our window who got their main dishes before we had our salads, but there were 4 in our party, so maybe it was a fluke. My last complaint is not about the taste of the food (it was all excellent), just about its delivery. I ordered the combination salmon and shrimp scampi and replaced my side of mashed potatoes with a salad. Like I mentioned earlier, the other couple's meal came before my salad, which was served with my main dish.  Maybe I should have specified that I wanted it sooner than that, but having worked in a restaurant I thought that was pretty standard procedure.  Also, when I got my entree, i was shocked to see that there was no pasta with my shrimp scampi.  Apparently the combination plates aren't served the same as the full entree listed directly above the combination options BUT once I asked her about the discrepancy she immediately brought me a bowl of pasta for the shrimp, great service. That all being said, our server, Sarah, was fantastic.  She didn't bat an eye at my complaint or any of our requests (and  there were several, such as wrapping up the bread).  She stayed pleasant and smiling throughout.  She was chatty when it was appropriate and let us be when it was time.  The food, both the entree and the desserts (see the pictures) were delicious. The bottom line: you know what price to expect, the service was the best we had on our vacation, the food was delicious, and it was only the small details we missed on.  Most reasonable people can overlook those types of things. 4 stars."
Mike S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,1.0,3/14/2015,"ATTENTION: CHEESECAKE FACTORY CORPORATE!  This is the worst restaurant in your chain, just walked out after witnessing your manager Ken arguing with employees, where is customer service guys? Seriously, your food is a 3.5 at least train your people to smile and say Thank You rather then being rude to customers and arrogant to employees. Big City Tavern is my choice tonight, what a joke for an American icon restaurant!  There are better options on Las Olas, this place should move to a mall!  Not Las Olas material!"
Shane F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",70,15,,2.0,11/27/2012,"I have eaten at many, many Chessecake locations throughout the U.S.   Cheesecake is known for their large menus and even larger portions and generally I've found the food to be quite good.   This location is no exception when it comes to food.  Service, however, is a different story.  This location is closest to my home and as such I've visited 10-12 times over the past year.   Thinking of all of my visits, I would rate  the service  mediocre at best.  My experiences at their other locations leads me to assume there must be deep rooted cultural problem with management here.   I'm baffled as it is so different from locations I've visited in Boca, Boston, Orlando and even in California.   On my visit last night, the place was fairly empty.  We were a party of three and  were seated right away yet waited nearly 20 minutes for the wait staff to greet us and offer drinks.  We weren't offered any bread until we asked for it which also seem to take awhile to arrive.   The food runner brings one meal over, sits it down on the table and walked away.  She didn't bother to mention when the other meals would be arriving.  The other food did arrive about 3 minutes later.   At no time did our waiter check back with us to inquire about our satisfaction with the food after it arrived.     Overall this experience was mediocre.  Nothing during my visit was so egregious that would cause me to involve the manager onsite, however I remain disappointed because I know Cheesecake generally offers so much better."
Jessica G.,"Margate, FL",481,618,1408,4.0,7/29/2013,"I've never been to the cheesecake factory before this (I know, it's weird) and this time I didn't really go all out. We were coming from brunch across the street and wanted something sweet, so we sat at the bar and shared a piece of the pineapple upside down cheesecake. It was really, really good, and the bartender was very friendly. I still need to go back and try the actual food, but I will always look forward to the dessert....there are about 10 more cheesecakes I wanted to try."
Cory A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,23,22,4.0,1/27/2014,Had lunch here the other day. The server Jordan made it an awsome time. I recommend getting a lunch special if your dinning around that time because  the portion is great. Spicy chipolte chicken pasta was excellent.
Elie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,16,,4.0,2/24/2015,"I am giving the place 4 stars because of the consistency that I have experienced with the food.  The service if you are sitting at a regular table will be based on how good of a waiter you have to serve you.  It can go from average minus to very good.  I am gluten free and I found that the few dishes advertised with the GF option are excellent.  Sitting at the bar is much better, no long wait, quick service, the girls there are usually very busy and they are doing a great job A+.  Note: parking across the street by the Suntrust Bank is easy 1.75/hour."
Jen M.,"California City, CA",0,19,,5.0,3/15/2013,"Never been to the cheesecake factory although I should have a while ago. Showed up right when they opened at 11:30, was greeted and seated immediately. Got a nice table to people watch, facing Las Olas and was served by James. He was extremely knowledgeable, knew the menu well and was super easy to deal with. We ordered the Crispy Crab bites and Margherita Flat Bread to start, both came fresh and were very tasty. For the main we ordered the lunch size Fettucini with Chicken with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, but replaced the chicken with shrimp and the Smokehouse BBQ Burger.  Let me first say that the burger was HUGE and the meat was excellent quality. I ordered medium rare and they had no problem serving me it, says something about the beef they buy. The Fettucini was the lunch size portion, plenty large and no need to order the dinner portion. Total satisfied with the taste and texture. For dessert we ordered the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake and the new OREO® Dream Extreme Cheesecake, both excellent as expected. Ultimately after ordering 2 non alcoholic beverages, 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 2 desserts, the bill was a WHOPPING $63 bucks!! Very reasonable indeed.. I was totally surprised, expected to pay near $85 bucks. Definitely going to make this a regular thing."
Rachel L.,"Miami, FL",4,16,13,3.0,12/23/2014,"Don't be fooled by my 3 stars, the food is amazing. You see, the problem was how weird, sticky and slippery the floor was, the place didn't feel too clean. On a lighter note : I had the Orange chicken and it was oh so delicious !!"
Amanda T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,4,,5.0,2/10/2015,"Finally getting time to write this review! Went for dinner with my girlfriend on the 31st of January. The 5 stars rating is solely based off of the waiter who wasn't even assigned to our section, but took care of us!  Confused, let me explain..  We got walked to a booth..second one straight down on the right side of the podium. Sat down and looked at menus and chit chatted...after about 15mins..15..one-five.. i got agitated and stopped a waiter and being annoyed already, I asked "" do we get a server with this table or is it self serve?! We've been waiting for like 15 mins and no one has even introduced themselves.""  He IMMEDIATELY apologizes for the lack of service and, instead of just saying I'll go find her, WHIPS out his notepad and takes our drink AND food orders ( like i said we were sitting there long enough to look through the entire menu uninterrupted!) For me, this is a huge deal because he had enough patience and understanding to defuse the situation, saving the restaurant some money.  We noticed his section was on the other side and he was also completely filled but yet still put in our drink and food order. This SUPERMAN CAPE WEARING SOB'S name was PETER!!! :) Now, lets introduce the other character in this awesome adventure. After another 5mins from Peter taking our order a waitress walks up irritated and introduces herself, Bonqeasha. I shit you not, that was her name, **no pun intended and may have messed up the spelling**.  We politely tell her that another waiter took care of our drink order and food order. She clapped her hands together, said ""OK"" and walked away. Moments later walks back and drops off our drinks without saying a word... Summarizing this..after our food gets dropped off by food runners ( Also amazingly nice and polite) we get another follow up visit from Mr. peter asking if everything is ok and if the food and drink is to our liking. (IT MOST DEFINITELY WAS! Thank you to the chefs that night!!!)  Not once did Bonqeasha check on us. We finally had to call her over for the check. Needless to say PETER got the tip that night...so humble HAD TO FORCE HIM TO TAKE IT!! .but to Bonquesha I'll leave this tip.. a smile and tentativeness is where the money is in this industry. I never leave reviews, but this one had to be shared. Faith in humanity was almost lost..till Peter showed up! Will def come back again! One bad apple didnt spoil the bunch thank goodness!"
Serena N.,"Orlando, FL",6,3,,2.0,8/19/2015,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory location I have been to. We were a party of 16 but waited nearly 3 hours for a table...they were busy but certainly not busy enough to warrant that long of a wait time and probably sat 50+ (likely more) people that came in after us. Girls at the hostess station were fairly snobby and certainly less than polite and kept telling us 20 more minutes every 20 minutes. The floors were gross and slimy and, wearing sandals, I almost busted my butt on the way to and from the bathroom, which was disgusting. Most stalls were without toilet paper a few were extra gross, to the point of being unusable. For the price of the menu items, the experience at this particular location was certainly not worth it. Had a large group of my coworkers not been there to celebrate 2 birthdays, I would not have stayed. One star for the salted caramel cheesecake and the other for our waitress, who was friendly enough. Everyone's order was correct, came out in a reasonable amount of time and we got no grief about needing some separate checks, though she did know we were waiting forever and pissed. The manager did come over after we had paid already to offer free desserts to the birthday girls. However, it was too little too late and we really just wanted to get the heck out of there. Won't waste my time coming back to this one."
Candice P.,"Hollywood, FL",0,12,4,4.0,8/26/2014,"I absolutely love this location.  Walking distance from a condo that my company was building at the time, my co-worker and I would make this our Friday treat.  Due to all the businesses in the area and tourist, I thought that we would be on a time crunch.  We actually were pleasantly surprised that we were always able to be seated rather quickly.  Since their portions are relatively large, we always split a burger and fries.  We became such a regular, the staff knew exactly what we wanted before we even sat down.  They always would kindly serve us on separate plate, where some restaurants frown upon sharing dishes.  Everything from the service to the food is excellent!"
