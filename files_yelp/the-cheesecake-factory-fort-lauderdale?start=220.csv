Andi M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,2,2,1.0,7/31/2014,I like the cheese cake factory and all but there is a huge problem with this one if you like waiting 10 to 15 Min after you sit for drinks and a server to see you then this is the place for you even on slow days the staff is so laxadazical that the food can take up to 45 min for a salad to come out.!!!  This place needs some staff to on how to treat your guest in a timely manner. You should just skip this corporate company's restaurant and go to one of the many local spots that give service that deserves a tip!
Michael C.,"Chicago, IL",41,24,2,3.0,6/24/2014,Not used to a Cheesecake Factory where the staff is so non customer focused. Ordered a take out over the phone. The guy on the other end seemed like he had much better things to do than take my order.  Went and picked up the food after 20 min and still waited an additional 10 min.
Julie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,588,1256,4.0,3/2/2012,"Ya ya, I hear ya...It's a silly, fattening, and over priced chain. But during Happy Hour, this place is my friend. To start with, the never-ending free wheat bread is so delicious. The well drinks, some wines and beer are half off in the bar area, and so are some of their appetizers. My boyfriend has gotten the tamale cakes twice and has devoured them.  And you get three cakes for $5-6?! What a deal. He's also ordered the spinach and cheese dip, which was also sinfully decadent. I loved the fish and chips I ordered. The fish was perfectly flaky and flavorful and the outside batter was a great combination of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. And the fries are always fresh, hot and well seasoned.  I once ordered the vietnamese tacos, and I will never do that again. The buns were so fluffy and nice, but the marinated cucumber and carrot slaw was just badly sauced. The sauce was a horrible flavor so then it just killed the entire dish. On separate occassions I have also ordered the turkey club. It's one of my favorite sandwiches. I substitute the bread for wheat bread and usually take off one slice of the bread because three slices of bread is too much for me. So coming here, you just have to be careful what you order, come at a time the prices are right, and come when it's the least busiest because then the service gets worse and the place gets loud."
Tina T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",34,70,15,3.0,5/19/2014,Been here 2/3 times .. Good pear martinis... I didn't much like the Godiva cheesecake.. It was too rich.. Good lemon pepper chicken... And white rice.. Service seems fast... Clean... Never really waited long for a table... Big dining area ... Shopping all around
Jill B.,"Broward, FL",10,10,3,1.0,1/2/2014,"Horrible!! Was previously a place to meet family monthly and more recently became a regular place for my husband and I to eat weekly. EVERY visit there was far from stellar...yet we continued to go....coming from the service industry I was understanding and never complained and still tipped at least 20%...this last experience last night was the cherry on the cake!  I will NEVER return!  Giving 1 star, because NO stars is not an option! Last night I called at 11pm to verify they take last seating at 11:30. We rushed to get ready but 11:30 came before we could leave the house. I called at exactly 1130  first time there was no answer. Called back at 11:31 and asked if we could order right there on the phone (huge menu but we knew what we want....dirty martini, Bottle of moscoto, hibachi steak & chicken Madeira..... that we would be there in 3 min (live right across the street) she  denied our request. I asked to speak with manager, she was the manager.....I asked if we could order to go....she stated ""all of her cashiers were done and home for the day and the kitchen was completely closed"" ok. I thought no biggie....hubby and I took our time finished getting ready and left to find somewhere else to eat. When we drove by the cheesecake factory at about midnight and there was a table of 4 sitting outside. Meaning her statement to me was completely false. ...there were cashiers still there b/c 30 min earlier they still had a table to close out. We can not return to an establishment that doesn't value their customers or really want them for that matter. We are done ""just dealing"" with it..... From the nasty hostess.....who was walking by our table with silverware...of which we never got. When I asked her for silverware so we could eat her response was ""im setting up a table for another party"" and wouldn't give to us already at a table to give to people who had not even sat yet.  Then the Hitachi steak usually never cooked as requested & make sure you check your silverware before you use- I dont think there was one time we got clean silverware on ANY visit.  Their loss....our tab with tip is usually waayyyyy over $100....and Ale Houses win! Plus we saved some money and had a much better experience!"
Lauren C.,"Buffalo, NY",0,3,2,5.0,9/16/2015,We had so much fun during happy hour. We were from out of town and out bartender I think her name was Carrie was so nice and helpful about different things to do in the area. The drinks were great and the Mac and cheese balls are to die for!!
Robin B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",32,35,43,5.0,5/18/2014,If I had to eat here everyday I would be fine with that. The Shrimp Scampi is to DIE for. So much flavor. The shrimps are weirdly delicious. Its a perfect dish. I also love the pizzette with blue cheese and pears. Super tasty. My partner loves their pasta dishes. The stuffed chicken tortillas are dynamite. Tons of flavor. My favorite desserts are the Lemoncello Cream Torte cake and pineapple upside down cheesecake. Both desserts are paralyzing. Great service. I live close to this location and when I want to pig out this is my go to joint.
Sarah N.,"Springville, TN",5,149,7,1.0,2/8/2014,Feb 8th around 3pm-NEVER had this bad of an experience at cheese cake factory-not especially crowded but our food took an hour. Waited a long time for bread and drinks. Our waiter was goofy-Food came out intermittently  so our party of three sat and watched the other eat- cold (pasta) or wilted (salad). Sent the pasta back and proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for the kitchen to figure out what the heck they are doing. Terrible experience- wouldnt recommend- im embarassed because we took my mother  here for her birthday-
Kevin L.,"Ithaca, NY",0,45,,4.0,4/6/2013,"Great service and good food.  One thing I don't get though. I'm not a small guy, but it is still impossible for me to finish an entree. They simply give too much food."
Danny N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,99,9,2.0,8/28/2011,"So I think it would be fair to list all the things positive and negative and let you decide... Positive:  Nice Waiter Very Big Portion After dinner you can walk the Las Olas stretch of a street..(Prime location) Negative: My food was oily more than ive ever seen in a meal.. (the pastas) Overpriced.. The place smelt like humid dishwasher (no lies here) The tables were jam packed together which made me feel they rather see profit then provide comfortability.. ..we were at a booth and i could have asked the table next to us for salt.. Fridays and Saturdays the wait is always 30-45 on usual.. no exceptions So after my 5 years of restaurant experience,and ive done it all from busing to waiting, my conclusion is, a C. I would however like to go to another location for a second opinion. Id also recommend you to go during a weekday because the wait is only 5-10 minutes and you are served essentially, the same greasy food lol Also its way overpriced because Ive tasted better pasta at applebees.. Wish I would have tried the Cheesecake, but didnt cause I was full :) Try it for me would ya?!"
Colin P.,"Scranton, PA",94,226,309,4.0,6/13/2011,"""Wow, there are a lot of people giving this place a hard time."" I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed. If you've visited any location even once, you know exactly what to expect at TCF - long waits, fairly loud atmosphere, above average service, okay to very good tasting food and large portions.  This was my spot for dessert and coffee after an evening of putzing around on Las Olas. An abundance of outdoor seating and their namesake specialty made it a natural choice. We were seated outside almost directly above the Henry Kinney Tunnel (which also runs below the river) but you'd never know it.  At the time, Red Velvet cheesecake had just made its debut. This happened to coincide with the height of my obsession with all things red and velvety. I didn't have to look further than the back of the menu. Once my towering confection arrived, a sassy diner at an adjacent table verbally eyed it up. I offered her one of my two spare forks. She gladly obliged and we did a little duet using only the word ""mmm."" Wait, why did I have three forks? I know the slices are big, but I only have two hands. Oh yes, lest we forget: the portions here are enormous."
M C.,"Milford, CT",54,145,11,4.0,5/22/2012,"For a chain...very, very good and I dispise chain restaurants...I had 4 good size fish tacos w/ black beans, fried rice, and fresh made guacamole. My wife had nachos. My meal filled me up and this was a late lunch...didn't eat for the rest of the night. The Mojito was very good. Bill was a little on the high side, but I think worth it, especially in a high tourist area."
Franz K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",40,117,76,4.0,6/13/2011,"I had a real good experience with this Cheesecake Factory.  On a Sunday Early Evening, we had like a one minute wait before we were seated.  Don't expect to get a very private table here, but we did score a private 2 person booth, which was real nice.  They have a  bar area to watch the TV's which I always enjoy when a game is on. Waitress was helpful the entire time and checked up on us frequently and recommened almost everything we had.  The Mai Tai drink , though 10 bucks, was EXCELLENT.  Not the strongest I've had, but it was very tasty and FRESH.  The appetizers were great . . . these 6 crab balls on a small plate and the Chicken Pot Stickers.  Presented nicely and great tasting. The Grilled Herb Catfish was HUGE and lived up to the taste I envisioned.  The wife had a grilled Salmon and Scampi combo, which was only ok for here . . . she said the shrimp were overcooked and the Salmon IMO was too herby.  The grilled Aspargus could have been more tender.   The Iced Teas aren't sweet here, so watch for that before ordering if it bothers you. We had the Cheesecakes to go . . . and wow, definitely lives up to the billing.  White Chocolate Macadamian and a Ultimate Red Velvet . . . do yourself a favor and try those 2 . . . the best I have had here. The price ran us around 80 bucks after tax and tip . . . not bad at all for the ambience, presentation, taste and service we received."
Vanessa S.,"Coral Springs, FL",179,167,84,5.0,4/21/2013,"I was here on vacation. We were with friends that have never experienced Cheesecake Factory. So we decided to let them see what its all about.  I ordered my usual-chicken and biscuits.  I was ecstatic beyond words because the location in Long Island, NY took it off their menu!! We kept it non-alcoholic since this was our last stop before the airport. The crew had sodas w free refills, and the waitress was so awesome, the glasses were never fully empty each time she took them away & bought us fresh ones. My friend ordered a fried mac & cheese burger, which looked quite interesting. It was a burger w a layer of cheese & a ball of fried mac & cheese on top. If your a burger & cheese lover, this is for you. If not, it might be a cheese overdose & you may end up in the bathroom!! Cheesecake of choice- this time was the dulce de leche.  It was just as delicious & wonderful as all the others Ive had, but tiramisu cheesecake is still my fave, hands down!! Service was excellent. Waitress was great at making recommndations. She told me chicken  & biscuits was her fave as well. She then went on to say that during her first 2 weeks of training, they made the new wait staff taste practically everything on the menu so they can really know the menu when they are assisting customers.  I thought this was insane, but cool. Makes me wanna just apply so I can get ""training!"" Lol!! I would definitely return if Im hanging around Ft. Lauderdale & craving chicken & biscuits or a mean cheesecake. Outdoor seating was a nice touch as well. We were by a pier so we got to see some nice lil boats while we ate."
Brian L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",120,179,330,2.0,4/16/2011,"No need here to write an opus of a review. Everyone knows about this chain.  Boy, when they first came to South Florida, this place was crazy good. It was a total and refreshing surprise. Now, it seems the luster is gone. It is just okay.  Burgers are decent, and salads can be loaded with lettuce and much else. I think the one in Aventura though is better than the one here."
Grant C.,"New York, NY",95,446,205,1.0,2/25/2011,"Why am I reviewing a Cheesecake Factory, you may ask?  God help me, it was the only thing still open by the time my flight got in and I was famished.  I came in with low expectations, but they failed to even meet those. Mostly because they tried to kick me out.  I came in just before closing, but most of the restaurant was full and they were still taking orders at the tables.  Weary business traveler, I sat at the bar and received this warm and friendly greeting: ""Let me see if we're still taking orders."" Then the manager came over to interrogate me: Manager  -- ""How did you get here? Yelper  -- ""I walked through the front door."" Manager  -- ""After closing?"" Yelper  -- ""I don't know what time you close, but the door was open."" Manager  -- ""Well where were you?  Were you in the bathroom?"" Yelper -- ""Nope.  Walked from the door to this barstool."" Manager -- ""Well, you can order something for takeout."" Yelper -- ""Um, no.  I'm going to drink a beer and eat here."" WTF?!?  I know when I'm not wanted and would have walked the fuck out if I wasn't so damn hungry.  I'm not sure who in corporate headquarters trained this manager to turn away paying customers, but she did a great job of making sure I won't return. Oh, the food?  It was the sort of bland, processed TGI Applebee's Chili's Factory Bennigan's meal I expected from a chain, but surprisingly overpriced.  I'm packing a lunchbox from now on."
Ana B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",276,165,333,3.0,10/7/2011,"It's good. When you're not sure what to get, this is the place, they have the most extensional menu I've ever see!"
Lydia M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,,5.0,4/3/2015,"my sister and friend came to visit me. We decided to go to Cheesecake Factory. I haven't been there in 5yrs and live in Fll. I don't eat meat, so i wondered what can i eat. i had the BEST veggie burger ever!! was so delicious and salad!! Reasonable price, sat outside, service was excellent!! Definitely a must go again!!"
Kimberly H.,"Dania Beach, FL",4,188,48,2.0,1/11/2014,Service was nice but I think a little weak from what I normally expect from the Cheesecake Factory.
MickeyBlue I.,"Hollywood, FL",225,672,3129,4.0,1/26/2013,"I love this strip! A few restaurants are on the pricey side,but that's great to keep the undesirables away. This particular night we sat outside and had a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and coffee. Perfect dessert while we people watched, I'm not sure why people go running along the sidewalks where people are supposed to ""walk"" but it's full of pyscho runners so don't be surprised to see a marathon on a sat night."
