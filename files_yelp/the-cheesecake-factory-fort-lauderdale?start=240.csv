Ty L.,"Dallas, TX",692,324,23,5.0,6/7/2013,Had some cheesecake for my bday. Place was packed so service was a little slow. But everyone knows this is where restaurants get their desserts. Strawberry cheesecake as always.
Corina B.,"Atlanta, GA",262,188,89,2.0,10/9/2008,"Not a fan of their food, and the wait is horrible.  BUT the tuxedo cheesecake is off the hooook!! I always get my cheesecake to go"
B W.,"Atlanta, GA",6,130,27,2.0,6/19/2013,"I am a Cheesecake factory connoisseur, especially for the ones in Atlanta. However the CF down here gives me the idea that many folks in FLL don't like chain restaurants. I say that because as I was walking to the restaurant not many people were in or outside on the patio here, many of the neighboring restaurants were full of people sitting outside and vice versa. When we came in there was only one hostess which was another sign because again thats not what I'm accustomed to when going to a CF in Atlanta.  When greeted and seated, our server was nice and attentive, the bread was hard and cold, either Florida folks don't like carbs or their baker at the restaurant was having a bad day. Wasn't too hungry so I ordered some pretzel chicken sticks off the small menu and my friend had the Orange chicken entree. She enjoyed her meal, my pretzel sticks were decent, not very flavorful but enough to at least put some food in my belly from a long day of travelling. Def won't come back after trying the Grand Lux Cafes."
Kristine C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",36,32,,4.0,7/26/2013,Business is always boomin here. And for good reason. Everything is deliscous. Service is great. Prices are ok.
Matt R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,18,,3.0,1/18/2015,Located in a great area. Building is very nice inside and out. The staff are really slow and it takes them awhile to take your order and also to cook it. Every time I went here I had to wait a very long time.
JoAnna L.,"Miami, FL",65,193,183,2.0,1/4/2013,"The food is better at the Aventura location. And please, for the love of God, they need to do something about the slippery floors!!!! Ridiculous!"
Misslady D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",13,51,21,4.0,5/18/2014,last night i had shrimp w/angel hair and was great. the service was good and it was close to closing time so i was surprised to not feeled rushed abd the quality of the food was awesome
Arleen C.,"Miramar, FL",74,276,17,4.0,1/25/2011,"This is one of my favorite places for a good time with friends or just with my hubby, which was the occasion last time. Alexia was awesome, making sure we had everything we needed all the time. We both ordered burgers and they came cooked incorrectly. Hubby likes it medium, I like it medium well and they came backwards. Even though I don't like my meat looking reddish or pink, this time it wasn't too bad and we didn't send it back but we did make sure we told Alexia so that they can pay attention for the next person.    Even with the cooking error, we were very pleased with our late lunch experience and we were super stuffed. To our surprise, the manager sent us free dessert for the ""inconvenience""...wow!!! and YUMMY!!! so, hubby and I had to really struggle to make space in our full tummies for the delicious chocolate tuxedo cheesecake, which is our favorite there. All in all, great service, great food and a wonderful experience."
NyShell R.,"Kissimmee, FL",36,166,29,4.0,6/27/2012,"This was my first time at this location and my second visit to a Cheesecake Factory but my experience was pretty positive more than negative, Beautiful Restaurant, Nice Atmosphere, Plenty of Seating, and the food was very delicious.  Very large portions; The price was just about in the right range for what I ordered, the waitress was  extremely friendly as well as helpful, which is a big plus for me because most waiters/waitress just turns me off!  the best I had in a very very very long time, she was on point, not pushy, and very friendly. The only negatives I have are: I was pretty much forced to sit in the Bar area after I clearly expressed I wanted a booth in the Main Dinning Room, The wait would have been much longer if I was not right up in the hostess face, and I really had a problem with the fact that they sit the silverware/eating utensils right on the table. I don't like that, I don't know what they sprayed and sometimes they use those rags over and over again, so that was a real turn off for me, I had to end up using ToGo utensils. All in all I would definitely recommend this location to Family and Friends and most likely would be returning. Note: Combination Shrimp Scampi does not come with Pasta, a bit to rich but still very delicious but it only come with large portion size shrimp and sauce.  Hope this helps."
Sara M.,"Washington, DC",513,357,36,4.0,4/4/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I wonder if their pumpernickel break contains a dose or two of crack.. that's not an accusation.. I'm just wondering is all. I am not going to go deep into content on the Cheesecake factory because all I need to say is that I love their food and the menu is super extensive. The cheesecakes will make you cum. Now, with all of that said, I am knocking down a star at this particular location for two reasons. The first is that their floor is an ice rink. Seriously, do they coat their tiles in vasaline? Baby oil maybe? Whatever the case may be, one step on their tile and you're saying ""holy sh*t I am going to bust my ass!"" And you know what, I am just not a fan of busting my ass, especially if I am sober. Ok CCF? invest in some sandpaper and tape it to the bottom of your wait staff's shoes, that will easily solve the issue. You can thank me later. The second reason for CCF not getting all 5 stars is that the waiter I had last Saturday night was a real douche. I get it that you hate your pathetic life as a 35 year old waiter, but if I am paying for a service, I expect it to be accommodating.  Slippery floor and asshole waiter aside, Cheesecake Factory is divine."
Angelique M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,53,1,3.0,4/12/2011,"Decent food, huge portions.  We don't come to eat here often anymore because the dinner waits are long.  I prefer coming here for lunch and sitting outside.   The desserts are my favorite part.  We've been known to do a drive-by: my husband drops me off, I run in and buy dessert as he drives around the block once, and then I run out with the goods and we go home to enjoy it.   Why does it smell like dirty bleachy mop inside??"
Kevin C.,"Boston, MA",57,58,3,3.0,5/7/2013,"For a chain restaurant, they are better than most. Ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and it was memorable, just like the staff - very friendly. Just way too much food and way too big of a place (got the name right - it feels like a food factory)."
Elena C.,"Hollywood, FL",36,69,54,3.0,1/8/2013,"The service is good they are very attentive. I just had appetizers at this location: Tex Mex Rolls, they were yummy and the Spinach Dip with Nachos, which were very generous with the portion. They ran out of the Pumpkin and Pumpkin Cheesecake that day but instead we had a Blueberry Cheesecake and the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake...ummm so yummy."
Felix P.,"New York, NY",157,257,,4.0,2/4/2013,"For a chain, they do it right.  Huge menu, great appetizers, good food. Huge portions. Good cocktails. We have eaten at Cheesecake Factory places all over the US and like I said, for a chain, it's good.  You know what you are in for.  And, I have to say, they make the best Vanilla Bean Cheesecake....it is simply delicious.  Again, it's not Le Cirque, but for what it is, it's really good."
Pat S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,25,15,4.0,4/9/2015,"I'd never been to a Cheesecake before even though I'd heard a ton about it and most everyone I know has been. So we decided to check it out early evening one weeknight recently. Yikes!! I had no idea it would be a mad house on a weeknight and have over an hour wait!! The front desk had young women standing there looking unconcerned and unhelpful. They didn't address us when we walked in, there was a large crowd standing around and I had no idea who was in line, who was waiting, etc. We walked up to the desk and no one looked at us or acknowledged us. ""Hello??"" Finally they looked up silently. ""We need a table?"" She said it would be at least an hour wait. Wow. So because we had driven downtown JUST to eat here we didn't want to make the 45min drive back home so we decided to just wait it out. I ended up going across the street to get a small bite at a dessert shop to tie me over. Once we were seated I started feeling really sick. It might have been the rich dessert bite I had on an empty stomach, but unfortunately by the time our appetizer came I was about ready to pass out. I asked our waiter if we could have our food boxed to go. He was concerned and wanted to make sure we weren't upset over the service. I told him while it was a long wait to get seated and a long wait to get food, we weren't upset over that I simply wasn't feeling great and we were only leaving due to that. He apologized even though he didn't do anything wrong and when he brought our boxed food back out he'd included a free piece of cheesecake ""for your trouble."" Which was VERY nice of him and I thought it was above and beyond customer service. So I'm giving 4 stars due to the great kindness and customer service of our waiter, and leaving off one star due to the unhelpful front desk ladies and the long wait. Thanks to our waiter for going above and beyond! We will come back and try this restaurant out again when we have plenty of time to kill."
Britany A.,"Tampa, FL",29,62,9,5.0,12/5/2012,"Ahhhh Cheesecake Factory. Amazing menu selection, incredible food, and consistent service. I had the Santa Fe Lunch portion salad and had to take a to go box because it was still massive. We sat outside and the weather was perfect."
Sean M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",34,55,11,4.0,8/21/2013,Went to lunch with the wife. She got the cob salad and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich but asked for it to be grilled instead of fried. I was very good. The wife really liked her cob salad. We had the Adams Peanut butter cup ripple cheesecake for dessert. Amazing!
Roger K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",18,61,10,3.0,12/28/2010,"I am not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but my experience today was pretty good. The location is great and the decor is really nice.  When I got there, the hostess said it would be a 10-20 minute wait. It turned out to be a 35 minute wait for me and my cousin, which I wasn't too pleased with. The service was really pleasant, which kind of made up for the wait. I had a couple appetizers and a beer because I know the food portions are enormous here. The food was great and I would come back here again for a night out."
Nina C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",352,498,81,1.0,11/10/2011,It's a chain! It's gonna suck from time to time as most chains do! Idk we came just for cheesecake and umm the waiter wouldn't let us order the cheesecakes we wanted- so dumb! We insisted we didn't want his suggetions and lol what did he serve us his suggestions- totally ruined what we truly wanted- asshole!!
Daniel K.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",2,12,13,5.0,12/11/2012,Went for a birthday and it was great. The food receives 5 stars and the service was ok. We went on a Sunday afternoon and to my surprise it was not busy. I knew that if I went to the Aventura location or the new location in Pembroke Gardens I would be waiting for a table. When we got there we walked right in. All orders came in time and because the wait is not that long and the location is great (walk around after) I will be returning to this Cheesecake Factory soon!
