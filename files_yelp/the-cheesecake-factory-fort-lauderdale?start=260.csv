LoveFood I.,"Clifton, NJ",0,11,,1.0,7/25/2015,I like Cheesecake Factory up North and I was in Florida for business and decided to stop in and enjoy some of my favorite pasta and salad while sitting outdoors. As I took the first bite from my salad something caught my eye! What we refer to as cockroaches up North but apparently has another name in Florida. I quickly put up my feet and flagged the waitress over who was very kind and called over the manager who politely offered seating inside and assured me there is none inside and when it rains it's normal for these giant roaches to surface. They seated me inside but after seeing 2 large ones outside I had already lost my appetite. Paid 35 for a meal I took couple bites from and left starving. I guess this is normal for Fort Lauderdale locals but up North seeing giant roaches especially at the restaurant you are eating is not acceptable! The 1 star is for the the polite waitress and manager.
DeeDee T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,16,,1.0,8/16/2014,"This is a place you go to when you feel like you don't know what you feel like. The food is usually ok, and this last visit the food was still just ok, but my server was wearing his white button down shirt that looked like it's been washed three months ago at best. It was stained in the entire menu. The end of the cuffs were soiled in black sweat, as well as the neck line. I was so grossed out I couldn't enjoy my mediocre salad."
Rafael R.,"Miami, FL",65,9,4,1.0,5/19/2013,Spend 1 hour and 20 mins waiting. And they told me that the wait was only 30 mins. After they called me I wait 20 more mins for the drinks and 40 mins for the food to be ready. I will definitely don't come back to this place never again.
Mona T.,"Chino Hills, CA",54,106,44,2.0,5/16/2012,"so I went here twice on my stay, 2 stars each time visit #1: So we ordered a water and a coke and we got 2 waters.. they didn't bring us any bread so we had to ask for it. salad tasted like it was never washed and had no dressing on it blahh avocado egg rolls were the smallest portion i have ever seen and I've been to a lot of cheesecake factories.. the spicy chicken burger was fairly good, beware it comes with blue cheese dressing and not ranch blah visit #2: still no bread for us.. it was mothers day so was fairly crowded and we had to sit in a small nook near the kitchen side salad to give it another try..was mediocre and the lettuce seems slightly washed pasta was flavorful but UNDERCOOKED!  gosh ruined the entire meal.  also i wanted to order the fish tacos and the waiter warned me they were not going to be good...so i definitely took his advice...but wow when the staff tells you somethings not good thats a bad sign.. so i ordered te parmesan chicken sandwich it was good but greasy service wasn't too great either times, this is the first cheesecake factory location that i have complaints about"
Raul H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,,1.0,7/26/2014,"I had heard many good things about the Cheesecake Factory and I finally decided to try it with my partner. We each ordered different things. I had steak and shrimps and she had chicken alfredo. The first thing when we saw our food we were both thinking something similar: Is this it? Everything our friends and family talked about the Cheesecake Factory, big portions would always pop up in a conversation. The plates were huge, but the portion of the food was rather small. Perhaps what annoyed me the most was not the portion size, but the lack of serving the items that were highlighted by the menu. I only got three small shrimps and 6 tiny pieces of steak. My partner received pasta and alfredo, but where was the chicken? Four small pieces of chicken was all that we counted. The prices for the items were $16 and $20. I think that is way too overpriced, being that the Cheesecake Factory is not a four or five star restaurant. The food was decent. There was some taste to the alfredo, but nothing made it stand out. Steak Diane had no special flavor and the shrimp...too much lemon. I won't be going back to the Cheesecake factory."
M D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,15,,4.0,1/21/2013,"Excellent food, good portions. Always busy. Great service. Attentive wait staff. One caveat however; the bathrooms always seem to be wet and crusty. Tables can be sticky, floors and menus can be greasy. Almost slipped on the oily floor. It is a busy place, but that is no excuse. Overall a good place to eat with family and friends."
Germán R.,"New York, NY",329,28,,4.0,7/10/2012,"Really good food, really good service and great cheesecakes. If you're in Las Olas and want to sit down for great food which is not so expensive but still restaurant quality, this is the place"
Lourdes D.,"Miami Beach, FL",6,10,2,3.0,10/12/2009,"Welll....what can I say....it is the Cheesecake Factory after all.... all kidding aside.... Tonight, I arrived at the Las Olas location with a group of 11 amigos! Everyone, and I mean everyone (!) ordered burgers.  I tried the Kobe Burger on a whim.... It was cooked to my specifications - medium rare -- and suprise! suprise! It was actually really good.  A-OK as they say.   If pressed to go back to this chain restaurant, I would have the Kobe burger again.... it was juicy, properly done, hot, the fries were obviously cooked to order  - everything was perfect for a change. My only regret is that I did not save room for dessert. Next time!"
donald c.,"Atlanta, GA",0,118,,4.0,7/9/2012,I love cheesecake factory.  I probably been to 1/3 of their locations in USA.  This location is kinda inconvenient because there is no parking.  I live in downtown/las olas but I hate walking so I drive and always have to pay for my parking.   The food is awesome.  I love their fish tacos and their steak.  Yummy! All their salads are hugh and very fresh.  The service is hit or miss.  Don't count on great service at this place.
Caro P.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,3/28/2015,"After a delightful  Sarah McLachlan concert, we  decided to walk down Las olas and have a late dinner. Naturally  there wasn't much open so we decided to eat at cheesecake for a safe, reliable  meal. Wow,  were  we mistaken. First the hostess told us we would be seated immediately  only to then say nope sorry, we're cleaning  the section  you will have to wait. So we said no big deal, can we sit at the bar and she said  sure. We walked over, grabbed  a table and a waitress  asked, ""is it just the 4 of you?"" And that was the last time anyone  spoke to us. After at least 10 minutes of waiting without  any water, utensils or menus I decided to get up and talk to the hostess. Another  waste of time as she completely  ignored me for 5 minutes. So my next step was ask a bus boy for the manager, Yea that took another 5-10 minutes. Although the manager was apolgetic, he did make excuses for his team, which, in my book, is a big no no. I wasn't rude, mean or angry so no need for excuses, just apologize  & make it up to the customer.  Needless to say, we left. I'm in the area often for business & stop in often for lunch but I'm pretty sure I won't be back."
Jen G.,"Boca Raton, FL",30,61,5,1.0,2/20/2013,"You typically cannot go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory, but say faaar away from this one. We ordered a bunch of appetizers which we do often at the Boca Raton location- none of them were fresh. Especially the southwest egg rolls, which tasted as though they were made with reconstituted ingredients. Even our bar drinks were not up to par. Very disappointing."
Sally C.,"Miami, FL",118,45,91,5.0,2/28/2011,"We've been to several Cheesecake Factory Restaurants around the US. This one is by far THE BEST in service! The food wasn't bad either! Our waiter, Andrew G., was AMAZING! A very busy Saturday night and he was ON TOP of his game! Beverages were always filled to the top, hot bread was at the table almost instantaneously, our soups and appetizers came out in perfect order along w/our main course! He even included the smallest guest in our table in his random conversations! He was awesome! I cannot stop raving at the great service we received at this restaurant! The whole place looked like a well oiled working piece of machine...from the hostesses to the waiters to the chef everything was just flowing!!! We will definitely come back again soon!!"
Jacky M.,"Cutler Bay, FL",0,17,6,1.0,2/23/2013,"We arrived and there was no one waiting in the waiting area. We gave our name and were told it was going to be 25 minutes. We agreed to the time frame and waited patiently. After 45 minutes of waiting and not being told what was going on, the children began to complain that they were famished. When we asked how much longer, we didn't really get an answer. They simply told us that they were waiting for the party before us to get up and leave the table. So... if they decided to stay at the table for another hour, we would have to wait that long??? And is that the only table in the entire restaurant??? When we were finally seated after about an hour of waiting. I requested bread right away for the kids who were starving. Apparently the waitress thought I was being a little demanding because her attitude with me for the rest of the meal was not the best. We didn't have enough silverware for everyone in our party and it was exhausting asking for basic things that one would need during their meal. Everything took very long to reach our table.  The topping on the cake, was when my husband found a hair in his meal.  I will never come to this location again. I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations... Atlanta, Miami, and Aventura and I have always loved the service and food. But this Cheesecake Factory was VERY disappointing."
J M.,"New York, NY",0,13,,4.0,1/1/2014,Very good chain restaurant!  Food and service were both very good.  We were seated quickly and the server was very attentive.  Highly recommend for a quick bite.  Lots of choices and great desserts!
Matthias W.,"Miami, FL",1,21,8,2.0,5/22/2011,"Just barely acceptable. Only place to eat near the movies so didnt really have much choice. long wait for a table, less than enthusiastic waitstaff."
Katie W.,"Miami, FL",46,115,68,2.0,12/16/2012,"NO NO NO NO NO I WILL NOT EAT AT A CHEESECAKE FACTORY AGAIN. I don't see why people actually like this place. I know Grand Lux is owned by the same people, but Grand Lux is far superior to Cheesecake Factory. First, the menu at Cheesecake Factory just seems contradictory to me. Its a big menu, and yet I feel like the selection sucks. It can be a bit overwhelming. Grand Lux has a large menu as well, but they have much more variation and they have more unique dishes. Second, the food is just sooooooooooo mediocre. Everytime I've eaten there it's been extremely underwhelming. I don't go often at all. The last time I went was a couple weekes ago, and the last time before that must have been 10 years ago, but I always remember never really enjoying it at all. Last time I got the Cali Cheesesteak sandwich and I have to say I can make a better one from the frozen cheesesteak kit at Publix. It wasn't inedible, it was just so meh. The flavor wasn't there at all. It just tasted like unseasoned meat with some melted cheese and peppers. It wasn't indulgent in the slightest bit. I know it's just a Cheesecake Factory and they're not known for their outrageous food, it's just that it's so overpriced for mediocre flavorless food. If I want to get a quick bite to eat at an average place, I don't mind paying a few bucks, but TCF is overpriced for what they give you. The only reason they have 2 stars and not 1 is because their cheesecakes are pretty damn tasty and they make a decent cocktail, thats it. All in all, I would never ever take a friend to The Cheesecake Factory, I'd much rather go to Grand Lux and get a nice sangria, a burger melt and some delicious fried pickles on the side."
Pat P.,"Winthrop, MA",3,31,1,4.0,5/9/2013,"Gave Cheesecake Factory a negative review back in Nov., Tried it again in early April and the experience was improved.  Great waitress, husband had a burger which he said was pretty good, fries just ok, I had the  Shepards  pie and it was very good, would go back just for that!"
Steve G.,"Union, NJ",540,808,,2.0,12/21/2011,"The Las Olas Blvd differentiates this location a bit, and the vibe is a bit hipper, but there is little real difference with their dozens of other locations.  The Cheesecake Factory makes some of the best commercial grade cream cheese cheesecake out there,  with flavor choices abundant.  But, ""you don't get dessert if you don't eat your dinner!,"" and here is where things begin to complicate.  In a chain built around merchandising cheesecake, everything else is also over hyped.  Look at the many menu pics and read the descriptions; you would think that you were in a 5-star fine restaurant.  In truth, very little on the plate will resemble what you read on the menu.  It isn't that the food is bad; it isn't.  The portions are large and the food, meatloaf in particular, is good.  Their kitchens definitely do simple dishes far better than they do the finesse which predominates their menu-- the smoke and mirrors of merchandising aren't edible.  When they're busy, service can get very sloppy and forgetful-- well beyond reasonable accommodation.  Cleanliness can sometimes be an issue; there seems to be more hair on plates and dirty silverware than in most chain restaurants.  What Cheesecake Factory is-- a fun place with great desserts-- shouldn't be downplayed, but don't expect a whole lot more."
Steve E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",18,2,1,4.0,9/25/2011,Went on a Tuesday night... Was seated quickly and service was particularly very good. Server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The food was also good... was  a very enjoyable experience
Rich K.,"Miami, FL",85,273,28,3.0,5/1/2010,"Another restaurant chain that does things right.  How anyone can give this place less than 3 stars is a mystery.  Its a great place to get a drink and a good meal.  People go there because they know what to expect, no surprises."
