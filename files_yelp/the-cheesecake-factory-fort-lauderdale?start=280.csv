Louis R.,"Plantation, FL",11,18,31,1.0,9/12/2009,"First, beware you will not know until you get there if they just cleaned the floors or the vents the night before.  I have now been there twice in the past few months and both times happened to be after a cleaning.  It smelled like bleach and was terrible.  This last time I was with my family and there were too many of us to leave so we thought we would give it another try.  Four of us ordered the sangria---if you want a shot of sangria for $10 then this is for you.  When we ordered a second drink ""with no ice"" the waiter brought back a 1/2 a glass.  When we asked for the manager, he replied this is they way we do it.  Would you like it 1/2 or not at all.  I also ordered the fish taco---the fish was as dry as can be and tasteless.  Yes, this was not a great visit!"
Erika K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,4/23/2014,"My boyfriend and I arrived tonight to enjoy some dessert after our dinner. Our server Jamar was very sweet and this review does not reflect him at all. The hostess lead us through the restaurant, which was a disaster. I have honestly never seen a restaurant so messy. If I was to guess, at least half the entire restaurant was unable to be sat, because the tables were cluttered with dishes. We arrived on the outdoor patio which was in the same terrible state. When we sat, there were 12 dirty tables and as I'm walking out now there are still 8. Not only did the hostess and servers allow the restaurant to be so unkept, but I watched one, maybe even two managers come out on the patio and leave without a glass in their hand. I work in the restaurant industry and have for many years and it takes a lot to actually push me to write this review. This clearly shows lack of management and made our experience here un enjoyable."
Michael C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,52,2,2.0,11/22/2010,"Well we all know the name...but I dont see what the hype is about..there is ALWAYS a wait....and no matter what you order..the service takes forever. I feel the drink prices are quite high compared to other places. I will say the cheesecake is quite good, but they better get that right. Overall it's not good  it's not bad..it's okay if you have extra time and money to waste"
Ken L.,"Boston, MA",0,32,,5.0,11/13/2012,"Outstanding food and excellent service. The location of this Cheesecake Factory in particular is also amazing, with many shops within walking distance."
Blondie s.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,2,,3.0,11/26/2009,"Well, well, well, everyone talk about how good cheesecakes are here.  As the mater of face, I really don't care much, nothing extraordinary to me.   However, I enjoyed the meal.  I ordered Thai wrap and pasta dish.  Nothing special about pasta but Thai wrap was awesome!!!  It is refreshing.  Fresh veggie with excellent sauces, you can't go wrong.  All servers were friendly and enjoyed my lunch over all."
Sean D.,"Edmonds, WA",622,503,85,3.0,2/6/2007,"Friendly staff with a large menu. Food isn't awful and the drinks are good. Prices are OK. Yes, I know its a chain, but sometimes when your away from home you just want a little taste of home. It's pretty much the same no matter where you go and this one is no different."
Kameelah R.,"San Francisco, CA",104,150,9,2.0,6/15/2008,Why I ate here after a such a bad time in the Grove is a mystery. The menu is huge and yet you cant make a single substitution. And not matter what time you go the service is slow and everything takes forever. I really need to stop trying this place outside of SF it is just a waste of time.
Justin R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,14,1,1.0,12/4/2010,"I recently found myself on Las Olas on a Saturday and hungry.  I was near the Cheesecake Factory and decided to have an early dinner.  It was a little after 2PM.  The restaurant was almost empty.  I was seated promptly by the hostess.  Now, I think that when you go to a restaurant you try to have a total enjoyable experience. The hostess seated me near the POS computer in front of the door to the patio that opened and closed frequently and was very annoying.  I ordered the chicken Madeira, a dish I have often ordered.  I had 2 requests one was to have french fries and the other was to have the asparagus cooked very well.  When the food came the french fries were cold.  The asparagus was hard as could be.  I spoke to the waitperson and she assured me that she had made the request.  I am sure she did.  She took back the 2 items and came back shortly with warm french fries and almost raw asparagus.  The chicken was completely tasteless as was the sauce.  I guess the recession has hit this company and they are cutting back in many ways.  I used to like this restaurant, but will think long and hard to go back."
