Samantha W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,,4.0,11/17/2017,This is a great location on Los Olas by the stores and beach.  The pasta is delicious and you can eat outside.
Vanessa S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,1,2.0,7/13/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is typically a go to place for a celebration, which is why my friends and I decided to go here to celebrate but wow it was awful. Only reason why this isn't a one star was because on this occasion I didn't have to wait almost 30 minutes for a table, we were seated immediately.  Where to begin? The food was awful. It was a party of 7 and I'm not exaggerating when I say all of my friends and I got sick; my one friend threw up while he was there because his burger wasn't cooked right!  I ordered a supreme pizza, first off, I never thought anyone could mess up pizza but my god-- my toppings were falling off because it was under cooked! The middle was still doughy and the slices weren't even cut properly. Another friend ordered the four cheese pasta and it came out cold and sweet/sour. Also wouldn't recommend getting the the steak tacos or chicken enchilada, both of my friends resulted in stomach problems that carried onto the night and the next day.  Furthermore, the service- I get it, we were a big group, but our waitress wasn't having it with us last night. Hardly ever came around to refill our drinks, my friend requested a sauce and it didn't come out until after she was almost done with her food and was brought out by ANOTHER waiter, I personally also asked for hot sauce and she flat out ignored me and another waitress grabbed hot sauce for me instead. She also charged my friends and I wrong for some items but we're so fed up we just decided to leave. Didn't bother to tell me olives were extra, even when I asked but then miraculously appeared on my tab.   Next time, I'll opt out on this mediocre place."
Crystal M.,"Miami, FL",10,43,13,4.0,8/9/2017,"Food was great ofc but the waiter was very slow with my food & everybody else in my party. I order the lunch & soup meal & it was great. I was worried it wasn't going to be enough food, but it was enough. You don't have an opinion for the soup, they give you the soup of the day which was really good. It was the creamy potato soup & it had bacon bits inside & a few other goodness inside. I chose a ceasar salad & the amount was a good amount. It was $8.99 for the lunch & soup meal."
Danielle J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",133,22,8,5.0,5/19/2017,The service was amazing. Our server named Gasser was very good.  I came here with my boyfriend for date night which we already were coming for the food since we knew it was good! But I writing this Yelp comment because our server.  It was a busy night since it was half off cheese cake.  The food came out faster than I expected on such a busy night and I couldn't have asked for a better server.
Marilyn O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",29,12,,2.0,7/29/2017,I used to love this place but the service keeps getting worse every time I come here. Today again the greeter had a frown on her face and was not pleasant at all. The place was half empty when we were seated at around 5 pm and we waited over 10 minutes and no one came to our table to take our drink order. We finally had to ask someone who our server was and they asked them to come over. I will definitely think twice before coming back.
Dara B.,"Sunrise, FL",118,395,398,5.0,11/18/2015,"Pecan Pumpkin Cheesecake,  do I need to say more.    Pair that with a cappuccino and you are set!!! Its nice to sit outside if the weather is nice.    They also have an awesome happy hour during the week only.     The food here is delicious as well and big portions.       I have had brunch, lunch, dinner and happy hour at the various locations.     The one thing that brings me back is the cheesecake!!! There are many parking lots and garages nearby.   The closest garage is behind the restaurant."
Alex G.,"Broward, FL",39,950,374,2.0,6/10/2017,"Cheesecake Factory may have ""jumped the shark.""  It's mediocre now, with lazy management and even lazier waitstaff.  The food is churned out with no passion whatsoever, and the quality was subpar.  No bread came for ages, and it took forever to get the check.  I won't be back..."
Amber M.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,6,,1.0,10/24/2017,I would have given zero stars if it were an option. Totally disgusting is this CF now. What in the world happened guys? This used to be a great spot downtown. Every meal we order (a total of 4) was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for months. Buyer beware. Visit a worthy spot on Las Olas.
Sheryl K.,"Naples, FL",4,39,19,3.0,7/5/2017,Just not as good as it used to be - it used to be one of the few places you could count on for a great meal and large portion - recently picked up a few slices of cheesecake for $16 we got the tiniest pieces of cheesecake I've ever seen they should be embarrassed!
Trenesia J.,"Miami, FL",47,10,8,2.0,7/8/2017,Worst Location ive been too ! I love this restaurant but this is my first time here. They took 15min to bring us Drinks and Bread. I ordered Lemonade which is the only thing i drink from here because its normally so good! This lemonade taste so bad it taste so artificial. And my plate smelled like Literal TRASH. You can tell they washed the plates with a dirty rag. Ill never come here again.
Jordanna E.,"Plantation, FL",406,321,1853,1.0,2/27/2017,"This is just a review for the to-go service. I called at 11:25-5 minutes before they opened in hopes of getting some food to go as I was on a field trip nearby and left my food at home. Whoever picked up transferred me to someone that could help me. I was on hold for about ten minutes and when she picked up to take my order she was just rude and kirt. She told me my salad would take 25-30 minutes. I went to pick it up and unfortunately I was behind a bunch of delivery guys picking up huge orders. I asked if I picked up smaller to go orders there and she snapped at me and said something rude, I can't exactly remember, with a very nasty face and body language. I actually left, as there was no way I could wait as she was headed back to grab things they were missing, and I also didn't want to tip the grouch. Everyone has a bad day, but don't take it out on your customers. I wasn't rude to her and I was disgusted by her body language and tone."
Christopher I.,"Wilton Manors, FL",9,67,28,1.0,3/21/2017,"Egg plant Parmesan was cold, the fries came out late and the service was not impressive I won't be going back. Then read was very cold and hard"
Renee K.,"Davie, FL",65,9,3,4.0,7/23/2017,"We are big fans of Cheesecake Factory.  And we know that if we walk in this busy location on a Sat night, we're going to have to wait.  But we really only waited about 1/2 hr, which gave us time to have an (amazing) cosmo at the bar. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip for an app, and for me, I would have preferred it a bit warmer, it was more room-temp.  Our Entrees were Chicken Medeira and Angus Steak Tacos.  Both were amazing and absolutely no complaints!!  We took a slice of turtle cheesecake to go to bring home to the kiddos and we were out the door.  Oh!  A tip on parking- don't waste your time and aggravation walking 3 blocks from a metered lot- VALET behind the Riverside Hotel ($8.00), walk thru the lobby (where they have an awesome piano bar!) and walk a few steps west once you get on the sidewalk out front....you'll be at the front door to Cheesecake Factory!  So much easier and you'll pay the same (if not more) in a metered lot.  Enjoy!!"
Jannah A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,23,6,1.0,6/12/2017,"Mess. Had dinner here with my husband Sunday night, hoping for a decent meal to end our evening. Instead, we got 1) profusely sweaty waiter who seemed totally out of it, 2) the wrong drink (I ordered one thing, received something else), 3) dinner plate missing items (no extra side of corn tamales-- which were cold-- and my stuffed chicken tortillas were missing the cheesy topping), 4) my husband's 2nd drink missing in action (ordered a second drink from the bar mid way through his plate, arrived at the same time as the bill. WTF? Waiter says, ""hey man, I put it in at the bar, it's not me!""), 5) the wrong cheesecake (ordered coffee cheesecake, got a German chocolate). The kind of shit you can't make up."
Tetiana G.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,15,11,4.0,7/18/2017,"This time my experience with Cheesecake Factory much better. I loved their menu, it's amazing how much food you get, because portions are humongous and everything tastes really really good. We went there last weekend, I had their specialty Chicken Riesling (Chicken Breast, Mushrooms, Bacon, Onions and Garlic in a White Wine Riesling Cream Sauce with Buttered Parmesan Pasta) it was the best thing I've tried from ""pasta world"", everything was cooked to perfection and it was literally melting in my mouth.  The only problem again was customer service. Our server Timothy forgot about drink we have ordered and overall was not really attentive, at the end when he gave us a check he took it right away and opened to see how much tips we left him, I'm sorry it was a little bit awkward, I've worked in the restaurants before and it was a big no no to take signed check from people while they still there and especially to check the tips. It's just small things, but they can make people uncomfortable. Hopefully next time it will be better. Overall thank you for a great food!"
Lindsey W.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",365,5,3,2.0,12/27/2016,"I never have extremely high expectations for The Cheesecake Factory, but this location dropped the ball in so many ways I felt a review was needed. As always the food was good, with a ridiculous size portion (even for lunch), but that was the only good thing about my experience here last week. First of all, it took at least five minutes until someone took the time to acknowledge us and we did not even know this person was our server until later. Not friendly, had to ask what the soup was, and seemed annoyed to be working. After we ordered we had to flag him down again for bread because it was not brought out like usual. During this time, tables around us were beginning to get up. The restaurant was only about half full but there seemed to be dirty tables everywhere with no one to clean them. Once our food came, instead of being brought a new iced tea - mine was taken from me and was gone for at least thee minutes. Took a long time to clear the plates when we were finished and also a long time to get our check and close out. During all this time the dirty tables kept adding up and we felt gross being among so much mess. We finally were able to leave and left the restaurant without a goodbye from any staff member. We saw many on their phones, could've been better used cleaning."
Monika J.,"Miami, FL",292,14,15,1.0,10/25/2016,Horrible service.  Here for 2 hours. And they took forever to bring out coffee and food. And it's my moms birthday the put the desert on the receipt and never brought it !!! HORRIBLE
Karen C.,"Hollywood, FL",0,6,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Omg this place is a real live shit show!  Worst service I've ever experienced at this chain, or maybe ever. Waited 30 min for bread and water. Ordered a salad and a sandwich, an hour later, never came. No one came to speak to us yet the waiter kept saying the manager was coming to speak to us. He never came.. Finally when we got his attention, he had no clue what we were talking about! Then they bring out my salad, and stated my husbands food would be a few more minutes..at that point we had enough, got up and walked away. Disgusting behavior all around from the waiter to his manager. Real live morons in action. Cheesecake Factory, get it together. Seriously..."
Karla E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,38,29,3.0,7/6/2017,"I live near this restaurant. The food and service at one point was great, however the last few time I was there, everything was mediocre. My favorite at this time is the seared tuna and the roasted artichokes. Hopefully, they won't change this dish."
Kelly W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",57,32,21,3.0,5/25/2017,"Great atmosphere great location great variety, but the good is not very good, looks like it's been sitting in the freezer for a year. Nice to come for a glass of wine on the patio but not impressed with the food. So many better restaurants in the area"
