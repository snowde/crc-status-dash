Tiffany H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",40,94,234,3.0,8/29/2016,"Ive been to Cheesecake Factory before, this location as well as others. I had family in town from Canada and decided to bring them here for dinner. I realized at 9pm on saturday night we would have a wait, especially for a party of 8. We were told 40 minutes and decided to stay. But after an hour wait, and a party of 10 arriving after us and seated before us, we were ready to leave. Eventually we got our table and the server was very friendly and fast. The bread was delicious as always. The food was just okay this time. Out of four kids meals..none were eaten. Not even the fries. The grilled cheese doesnt look like grilled cheese being very toasted and cut into strips like grilled cheese fingers. The kids cheese pizza didnt look appetizing at all.  The adult food was just okay with the exception of my boyfriends steak which he enjoyed. But everyone was ready to leave after the whole ordeal and did not even order dessert. I usually enjoy the food here so this time may have just been a fluke but it happened at the worst time when trying to impress our guests."
Gretchen T.,"Sacramento, CA",17,254,356,4.0,2/27/2016,"Got the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, Korean style with coleslaw and sriracha mayo in it. Also got the sweet potato fries ($1 extra). There was sriracha mayo and ketchup for dipping sauces. The sandwich was really good the chicken was spicy and crunchy and the sauce was a little sweet and balanced the whole meal off. Would definitely order it again."
Bill P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Disappointed today.  Yes, they were busy but kitchen and service were so slow we threatened to cancel and go.  Server mumbled.  When order came after 40 minutes, it was incomplete.  It'll be a while before I return."
Xochi R.,"Carrollton, TX",120,138,407,4.0,2/6/2016,"Was in Las Olas and in search for a quick bite so gave this place a try. Love the outdoor seating, (except for the next-door construction) good for people-watching and a bit of sunshine. Tried the avocado rolls and a nice fruit smoothie. Service was a bit slow but didn't bother us since weather was fab."
Carline L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,7,,4.0,5/18/2017,I have to say the food were really good I had my birthday dinner there just didn't like the waiting
LaMont C.,"Miami Beach, FL",27,26,63,4.0,10/18/2016,Beautiful evening to dine on the patio along Las Olas.  The area is filled with families who had the same idea.  It took my waiter a bit of time to come to my table... But..i already knew whatcto order.. My usual. Evelyn's favorite pasta..
Sherry W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",582,982,9357,3.0,12/24/2014,"Went for lunch and sat outside.  They allow dogs on the outside patio.  I started with the stuffed mushrooms.  There are 6 of them for about $7.  They have cheese and sausage in them with a sauce on top.  They were good. The soup of the day, cream mushroom, was amazing.  The cup size is HUGE.  There were small chunks of mushroom in it.   The Farro salad is found on the skinnyilicious menu.  For 590 calories you get mixed greens, feta cheese, slice red onions, faro, cucumbers, and ripe red tomatoes.  There is a vinaigrette dressing that makes it taste Greek.   They always bring out sour dough bread and a sweet brown bread with real butter.   There are plenty of menu items to choose from with various calorie options.  I am happy they have added the skinny menu with healthy portion options.   We didn't finish with dessert this time, but usually do. I really enjoy the Linda Chocolate cake.   There is parking behind cheesecake factory in a garage with a meter machine you pay.  Or on street  parking along Las Olas Boulevard with a meter.   For a chain, I think this is a good restaurant with consistent quality of food."
Max G.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/6/2017,Me and wife ordered salmon and pizza. I have to admit food was perfect. We have treated and served perfectly and our waiter was extremely patient with our too much expectations
Amanda C.,"Chicago, IL",171,669,474,4.0,1/15/2016,"We walked into Cheesecake Factory on a Thursday evening. It was pretty empty and we decided to sit outside for dinner. It seemed to annoy the host, he was pretty rude and dismissive. It seemed like an inconvenience for us to sit outside and we seemed to bother him for whatever reason. I Almost decided to leave but it was my fathers birthday and he was looking forward to eating there. Glad we didn't leave though, our waiter, James, was the nicest most attentive waiter. He definitely turned it around for me!  We started with the crab and artichoke dip which was delicious. Very flavorful. We the ordered our meals and James was extremely patient being that the kids weren't 100% sure what they wanted. I ordered the Ribeye with mashed potatoes and was glad I did!!!!! It was medium rare exactly like I like it! It was tender and flavorful, didn't use a drop of A1. Mashed potatoes were delicious with it. My father ordered the steak Diane, medium rare, and he loved it. The fried shrimp platter my daughter ordered was huge, she also enjoyed it. The Cole slaw was honestly one of the best I've had. Yes, I know it's just Coke slaw but I'm a bit of a slaw snob. The little sliders were good and my aunt ordered the steak tacos which she enjoyed with the rice and beans.  The waiter was a sweet heart and brought my father out a scoop of ice cream with a candle, joked and said his gift is to NOT sing him happy birthday. He must have the angelic voice I have ;)  All in all it was a great experience. Loved sitting outside on Las Olas. They lost a star due to the rude host in the front. They should realize that the first person you interact with sets the tone for the whole experience. Thankfully I was the only one who caught his rudeness and my family were too busy talking to pay attention. Lighten up dude, or find a different job!"
Jessica H.,"Miami, FL",0,6,8,4.0,11/12/2016,the best Salad I've ever ate is Super food Antioxidant Salad for ~$10 with grilled srimps! Absolutely satisfied for launch or even dinner! Only one thing I don't like today is not fresh bread. It's warm but not crispy as usual.
George C.,"Plantation, FL",10,5,7,2.0,5/29/2017,"The hostess was rude when I got there to the desk I said hi"" she told me to hold on in a rude way. I don't know her name but the was the heavy set brunette, the food is always good. The staff needs to be trained better."
Tracey S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",225,29,10,2.0,8/7/2017,"So let me start with we come here very often because it's my sisters favorite spot and she gets the same thing every time she comes in and at every location because maybe 2 years ago, a server told her to order it that way. The last two times we went to this location before this experience Shane was our server and he was so great and accommodating as always.  My family and I came in Friday as soon as they opened. Christopher was our server this time, at least that was the name on the server check. My sister ordered a side of angel hair pasta and added the scampi sauce... same thing she orders everyyyy time. He goes ""mm no"" we don't do that and tries to point her to the 20$ dish with mushrooms AND shrimp.... ""No"" is something you should never say to a guest.. Anyway, my sister can't eat shellfish and she hates mushrooms why would you recommend that after being told there's an allergy.  We very very politely let the Chris know that the way that we asked for it has always been accommodated and if anything at all they added an upcharge for the sauce. He double checked with the kitchen manager to see what he could do and he came back to the table and actually told us ""yea my kitchen manager said he won't do that at all actually"".. hmmmm... really? Either they have a brand new kitchen manager then or the server never actually asked. We literally ordered the same exact dish 3 weeks ago for my birthday!! I cannot get over that he actually told us they won't make what she has gotten every single time we have come in. She ended up choosing something totally different. The service aside from that was great, as far as the food coming out and drink refills and what not but the hospitality part and accommodating the guest totally lacked. Awkward lunch for us, and she's the only reason we go there  because she likes that dish. So may not be back to this location."
Melvina S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,19,3.0,4/23/2017,"I went there Easter Sunday, there was not a long wait, about 10 minutes. The food was good, Our server was ""Not Good"" she didn't come to check on us at all after bringing our food. She didn't come to clear our table and she didn't offer us any refills on our drinks or bread. I order a frozen pina colada with strawberry purée the alcohol was weak. It's on las olas so you have to pay for parking."
JD N.,"Naples, FL",0,33,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"Horrible food, horrible service! This is a chain and everything should be consistent, not here. Do not go - there are so many great restaurants on Las Olas, go there first. They forgot my order and delivered everyone's else, the Server really didn't care neither did the Manager. When they dropped it off it was disgusting. Everyone at my table said they didn't enjoy their meal."
David M.,"Hollywood, FL",9,31,84,2.0,2/5/2017,The dishwater broke so the staff washed everything by hand. Plates were brought out soaking wet. In addition food was left on the floor in the outside courtyard for hours. Waiters stepped thru it all day. Not impressed. New management is needed.
Daniel G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,4.0,4/11/2017,I went to The Cheese Cake factory with my family last weekend. The food and atmosphere made our dining experience wonderful. Only complaint is long wait time.
Ed B.,"Hollywood, FL",63,63,18,2.0,1/28/2017,Been to many a cheesecake factories.  Food was decent enough.. probable is with food orders.  I ordered fried mac n cheese never received it.... then when out entrees came out I ordered a club sandwich to go. I ate my meal and still 30 min after I finished eating I still don't have my to go sandwich??? It's a sandwich... uggghh
Kathe Pâmella D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,56,137,4.0,11/15/2015,"It's been a long time since I've been here the last time.

Sae A.,"Tampa, FL",156,198,146,3.0,4/1/2016,Visited this location with my friend and her son for dinner. I ordered a veggie pasta dish that had very little vegetable and sauce and an overload of pasta. The past was dry and difficult to eat I only had a few bites and unfortunately had to toss the remainder of the meal.
RA V.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,92,12,1.0,1/21/2017,"I usually a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but recently we order a margarita pizza and i have to say it was the WORST tasting pizza I can remember ever having.  The caesar salad was just OK.  The bread was the best part of the meal unfortunately.  Then our waitress disappeared, so after sitting there with plates stacked and glass empty for long time we flagged down a nearby waiter how helped with the check.  Parking it a challenge to go to this restaurant as well.  The restaurant seemed to have a funny odor also."
