Jessica V.,"Hollywood, FL",0,11,3,3.0,2/7/2017,"I usually do not like Cheesecake Factory but I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but my boyfriend loves Cheesecake Factory so we went on a Tuesday night. We got sat immediately and greeted by our server who was SUPER sweet (i wish I remembered his name) food was okay the only thing was it took FOREVER to get our food, it was a Tuesday night. Overall it was okay just average corporate place"
Gui G.,"Atlanta, GA",56,191,79,3.0,9/30/2015,"it is not cheap, but affordable; it is not amazing, but good. Besides having to chose from a book not a menu (I believe if they focus the chain in 20 dishes it would be a killer restaurant), everything we order is good. Apps, mains, flatbreads, cheesecake for dessert, are always good. This time our server was Iulia and she was great. A tip, get the artichoke dip and the dinamite shrimp. solid way to start your meal."
Roy H.,,22,100,19,2.0,11/25/2016,"Really down hill. I use to love this place but not any more. The lunch portion of chicken is pounded sooo thin all you taste is breading. The burger was skimpy and McDonald's gives more cheese.  Oh well, I guess if you want cheesecake, this is the place."
Gregory D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,16,,1.0,4/19/2017,"This may well have been the worst restaurant experience ever.  My partner and I craved the Cheesecake Factory catfish dinner that we so enjoyed when visiting relatives in Atlanta.  We took a booth in the bar and relayed to the waitress that we were there for the catfish.  She opened the menu and pointed it out.  When we told her how much we liked it in Atlanta, the fun began.  She stated that fish are like women, no two are the same.  She then suggested that we wouldn't know about that.  We thought it was an odd crack, but laughed it off.  When she brought the drinks, we ordered the fish and several appetizers.  A few minutes later, she glided by slapping a menu on the table saying, ""No fish.""  I asked my partner if I imagined that or if she was joking.  When we summoned her back, we learned that they were indeed out of the product we came to enjoy.  It was after all after 5:00PM.  Our server should not have shown surprise when we told her be bring the check for the drinks.  She did so and was quite proud that she was able to remove the appetizers we had not yet received.  Then we waited.  And we waited.  It was as if the staff was having its daily briefing out back. Perhaps that was the time they were learning of outages.  I eventually tried to settle the bill at the bar, but the bar back was solo.  Spotting the host who was not busy, I asked if he could help.  He smugly remarked that he was not a server but took the folio and my card.  As he pranced back and forth, I put out my hand and asked for the folio as I then preferred to handle the bill at the bar when the staff reappeared.  Then we got the coup de grace.  The host took a defensive stance and barked, ""Don't you touch me.""  It was clear to me at that point that I had somehow inadvertently landed in Nutsville, and immediately gave him space.  A delightful young lady then took the folio from him and I settled the bill.  Then we got the hell out of there."
Rob M.,"Melbourne, FL",2,11,,2.0,4/18/2017,"Stopped into this location for lunch today. Service is extremely poor. It took 5 minutes for anyone to come to the table after being seated. Waitress failed to introduce herself and looked less than thrilled to be there. I ordered a Cuban minus pickles with fries. It arrived covered in pickles, but waitress wouldn't know that because she never came and asked how my meal was. The sandwich was nothing special except that it came with extra pickles. I'd avoid the location."
Christina M.,"Anchorage, AK",42,75,329,3.0,3/19/2016,"I was not impressed with this location.  Food was good but service was subpar.  The waitress seemed like she had to walk and talk by us rather than stop for a moment and truly ask if we needed anything.  It was annoying.  Will I be back?  Probably.  We all have bad days and this place is worth another shot, since there is something about the Cheesecake Factory that I simply love."
Jenn L.,"San Francisco, CA",421,673,368,2.0,2/16/2016,"This review is for a TO-GO order. I normally LOVE Cheesecake Factories.  The service I've experienced is normally good and the food consistent.  However...this was a bad experience. We ordered enough food for 4 people and asked if they could include some bread enough for 4 people in our TO-GO order.  The lady said sure no problem!  We picked it up and they only included, literally, 1 piece of bread.  When asked for more, we only got 2 more pieces, and they wouldn't provide more butter (they only included a tiny amount initially). The bread ended up being really hard - normally the crust is pretty soft on the brown bread which we obsess over."
H L.,"Hollywood, FL",118,49,864,3.0,7/14/2015,"Great Place for Family & Friends, nice decor, fast dedicated Professional Service, good Menu, but food very blended & desserts Super sugary , nothing spicy, nothing to blow your mouth away with fire but only a sugar shot.... never disappointed too...."
Evan M.,"Miami, FL",1,5,1,1.0,3/9/2016,"Food took forever to arrive at our table, one order was cooked wrong,way over cooked.  Taste was below par, waiter took 15 min to check if our order was ok, sent back over cooked meal. When re cooked meal came back it was even further below par.  Entire experience left us disappointed. Will not return. I would recommend NOT eating here !"
Eric L.,"Orlando, FL",0,19,2,5.0,7/9/2017,Great service! Servers are very friendly. Recommend the area. Convenient to parking and las olas blvd.
Natasha C.,"Boca Raton, FL",39,42,14,3.0,4/11/2016,Why has the Cheesecake Factory become so borrring!!! The food hardly has any flavor. My Brunch was sad.  Potatoes.... Bland Eggs....Bland Waiter....BLAND 3 stars because I still appreciate the deserts
Marcia A.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,7,,4.0,6/5/2017,"We had the urge for a really good dinner, to be followed by a luscious dessert. We chose this CCF because the East Las Olas ambience has its unique invigorating casual, but upscale, atmosphere. Their menu is varied from burgers and sandwiches, to fine pastas, seafood and steaks; and, their dinners are very good. We always check out the CCF specialty cheese cakes first, with the foreknowledge that the overall plan is to finish with a great dessert. Inside is restaurant-typical well appointed yesteryear-ish motif. Outside dining on Las Olas is a little noisy, but connects you to the area visitors. The tables on the side street aren't as noisy, and is a little more laid back. Service is prompt, efficient and courteous, and their specialty cheesecakes are worth waiting for, to close out a great dinner out."
Danielle J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",189,220,429,2.0,12/15/2015,"Not sure what happened here but when we got there we sat down and someone introduced themselves to take our drink order and then that was it. We were in a hurry since we were working an event next door and we had absolutely no service for 15 minutes. Once we mentioned that our server actually never made it to us, I saw an exchange at the POS that looked like a server change and someone quickly took over for us. That was the only impressive thing, our server that took over quickly ran over to get our order and we just got small plates. Food was good and order came out quick but tables should never be sat quickly and then sit there for an outrageous amount of time to even meet their server. Even if you can get drinks to them, make sure the server is capable of taking us."
Kathy D.,"Sarasota, FL",17,31,74,3.0,1/31/2016,"Went here with some friends for dinner. Got here early enough so that we didn't have to wait for a table. That was a plus. Our waitress was really good and very friendly, another plus. Sadly the food was a let down.  We had a bunch of apps to share. Corn tamale cakes, crab and artichoke dip, crab wontons, fried calamari and sausage and ricotta flatbreads. The calamari and flatbreads were good. The rest were not very memorable.  I had chicken and biscuits for dinner. Huge portions, could have fed 2. It lacked seasoning, the gravy was watery and my biscuit was over cooked. Two of my friends ordered fries with their meals. They were ice cold and had no seasoning on them. Our waitress took them back and I noticed she did the same for the table next to ours. She returned with hot fries but still no salt or anything on them.  For a chain restaurant, it is what it is. But I'm not in a hurry to go back."
Summer S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",186,126,114,4.0,1/13/2016,"This is one of my favorite Cheesecake Factory locations. I love that you can explore Las Olas before and after your meal. Of course, this menu has everything imaginable to choose from. My one warning is to stay away from the Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I thought I would be daring, against the suggestion of my wonderful server, Carlos. It was my own fault that I ignored him and decided to be bad. However, Carlos was fantastic and attentive. We had tots for an appetizer, which are always a great choice.  All-in-all, a good spot."
R S.,"Brick, NJ",0,4,,1.0,1/23/2017,"We came in for lunch, restaurant was slow. The server never entered one of the 5 meals. It took 20 mins or more after the others were served to get the dish. We were very.disasfied with the service."
Ricardo A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,9,,1.0,1/10/2016,The service in this location is horrible. The food is extremely overrated. I got the spicy fried chicken sandwich while my girlfriend got a burger.  They messed up my girlfriend's order and our waitress never came to check in on us. Never once was offered a refill and we had to wait 30 minutes after receiving our drinks for my girlfriend to even get a chance to ask for sugar for her iced tea. I don't recommend this place to anybody unless all you want is come of their cheesecakes. We ended up getting a complimentary baguette since that's what my girlfriend wanted her burger on but that doesn't make up for this bad experience.  You'd think a restaurant with a name as reputable as The Cheesecake Factory would have exceptional service and just an overall good experience but this location really let us down.
Jenn D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",41,5,,5.0,4/12/2017,the chocolate mousse cake is to die for.   sometimes i go just for dessert.  it is worth it.
Tairyn A.,"Coral Springs, FL",526,680,7288,4.0,8/25/2015,"Tons of selections, amazing desserts, and good service. What more can you ask from a restaurant? I have a hard time deciding what to eat, only because the menu it's so extensive. On this particular visit I had the corn tortilla soup, which was great, and a Mexican dish that came with corn cakes. Delicious! Banana foster cheesecake for the win. I left beyond full and vowing to do double time at the gym the next day. Great place!"
Keli K.,"Cave Junction, OR",0,3,1,5.0,10/5/2016,"Went to Cheesecake Factory for Happy hour with my husband and a friend. We ordered the burger, crab and artichoke dip, GUAC (AMAZING), and the Tex Mex eggrolls. The food was fabulous! the bar area was full, our bartender Theresa was friendly. Fair prices, we will be back."
