Six T.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,13,10,4.0,12/8/2017,"We got the California cheese steak, the club, Louisiana chicken pasta, Cuban sandwich, kids slider, and a peppermint bark cheesecake. The food was good and so was the service. It was a Tuesday night and they didn't have much of a crowd. We were satisfied and will come back and try some more cheese cake."
Nicole N.,"Fort Worth, TX",97,91,426,4.0,12/6/2017,"Though I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, I still make my way to the Cheesecake Factory for the other goodies. CF gets fairly crowded on weekends in general, but this location gets super crowded with Bass Hall right across the street. The nice thing about being in Sundance Square is that you can join the waitlist, grab a beeper, and walk around the Square until your estimated wait time.  The menu is huge, so it's a nice place if you're taking a group. Everyone should find something that catches their eye. The portions are huge though. I had plenty of left overs. They also provide complimentary bread and butter, but there are enticing appetizers on the menu too.  I've eaten here several times but the last time we just orded -Crispy Chicken Costoletta: lightly breaded crispy sauteed chicken breast on a lemon butter sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus - tuscan chicken from the ""Skinylicious"" menu: grilled chicken breast on top an abundance of cherry tomatoes, artichokes, capers, and Ferro Definitely had left overs. I'd order both again, but there are still so many other items I want to try on their vast menu.  Also, if you're also not a cheesecake person but want dessert, I'd definitely recommend the strawberry short cake. It's topped with vanilla ice cream and plenty of fresh strawberries (none of those preserved syrupy squishy strawberries). Definitely enough to share."
Kamron H.,"Dallas, TX",242,9,3,2.0,9/26/2017,"I would love to give this Cheesecake Factory a second chance but I'm just going to have to trust yelp for now on. They were spot on although it was hard to believe because before now this chain has been very consistent. It seems like many other people are having similar experiences as me. I am not one to complain but I just made a mistake taking my girlfriend here for her birthday and if I can help anyone out from making a similar mistake I feel like I should do so. P.S. I am giving this a two star, not because I believe it is a two star restaurant but because I believe it was less than 40% the quality of other experiences I've had at different Cheesecake Factory's"
Kyo W.,"Richardson, TX",0,17,41,5.0,1/9/2018,Super fan of Cheesecake Factory. I could never give up their cakes and other dishes. Forgot the steak pic but it taste good and meaty. I wanna try all cakes.
Angela J.,"Azle, TX",5,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Service is terrible. Took my daughter for her birthday on a Wednesday night. Took forever to get seated, to get drinks, to get order taken, to get food. When the food arrived my daughter's entree had chicken. We had ordered without. Took forever to get corrected. Took forever to order cheesecake to go and get our check. Not coming back here again."
Mel S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/9/2018,Disappointed with initial service by the lady seating us. We noticed the booth seats and floor were significantly dirty with food particles and she simply ignored us when we told her by walking away while we wiped off the seats ourselves. The waitress was nice enough to sweep the area for us when we brought it to her attention. The waitress was good and the food is always well made so these qualities brought up the rating to a 3 star.
Ana O.,"Fort Worth, TX",73,246,96,4.0,9/25/2017,"Long time Cheesecake Factory fan and this location is the same as others as far as menu offering. The main difference in this location is that the restaurant itself is small compared to most Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Located right in Sundance Square across from Bass Hall this place get very crowded!   Food and service were right on par with other Cheesecake locations and is just as noisy. Their menu does not change too much over the years and of course the portions are huge.  I ordered an appetizer and a side salad and that was enough so there were no left overs. Now that I think about it, their small bites menu is new.  If you're familiar with Cheesecake Factory this location is the same but smaller so be ready to fight the crowds.  Park your car in one of the parking structures if you don't want to valet."
Sabrina M.,"Allen, TX",0,5,,2.0,1/7/2018,"After having discontinued my favorite salads with arugula and pecans, there was only the Margarita Flatbread left from the menu that I really enjoyed. Unfortunately, when I visited this location on 1/6 in the afternoon, I was told that they are out of flatbreads. Very disappointing.  Restaurant was not very clean either. Seems to be poorly managed. Big disappointment."
Robert B.,"Keller, TX",430,332,960,5.0,4/26/2017,"Based on this one visit, I'm puzzled by the low overall rating. The service was spot on, the location handy, and the food simply could not have been better. Of course, I am basing this on one visit only. My wife and I shared the lunch portion of the herb crusted salmon with asparagus and carrots. The salmon was just perfect, tender, not too fishy, and the spices and herb crusting were perfect. It was placed on three large asparagus spears, cooked to absolute perfection. How they got them cooked to where they are not too soft or too crispy, I don't know. But they were just perfect. The side bowl of carrots were some of the best carrots I have had. They were not over cooked and the flavor of the carrots was genuine. We ordered the Adams peanut butter fudge ripple cheesecake for desert. I must say, this is absolute perfection in every way. I am not the biggest cheesecake fan. This has just enough peanut butter whipping on top with caramel and fudge to balance out the cheesecake flavor. The best cheesecake I think I've ever had. I have this theory that if I can't recommend anything to improve, I should give five stars. Five stars it is. Recommended."
Karla J.,"Irving, TX",32,197,382,3.0,3/26/2017,"I've only eaten here a few times and although the cheesecakes are the bomb, the food is quite mediocre. The restaurant is beautiful, but crowded. I suspect it's that way so you can eat and leave lol. I ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken, won't be getting that again. It wasn't bad, I just didn't like it. I paid $20 for it too! Kind of pissed about it. The server was decent. I was thinking I would go at a time where it wasn't so crowded, but who am I kidding? Cheesecake Factory is always crowded!"
Leopard L.,"Grapevine, TX",16,111,26,1.0,9/11/2017,"Wow! Just wow. Ok so came with the whole family and decided to eat simple. I ordered a grilled chicken breast with grilled vegetables. The chicken breast looks just like the frozen ones out of the bag at target! Pre grill marks and all!!! Extremely sad looking, hard and chewy. The grilled vegetables? Well... that was funny. I received shaved carrots and green beans tossed in a thick oil that was perfectly tasteless. Not my idea of grilled vegetables at all. Sent my chicken back, should have sent it all back honestly, and manager was nice but came by to tell me they use fresh chicken breasts. That was a flat out lie. There is no way this chicken is fresh! Hahaha.   Nice try though.  First time to Cheesecake Factory and my last!"
Lauren D.,"Fort Worth, TX",102,27,5,5.0,12/28/2017,"My first time ever at a cheesecake factory was this Christmas eve. Because of the day, my family and i expected a long wait. To our surprise, we were sat immediately. As a table of 5, we had a booth with a chair on the end which was fine with us. Our waitress quickly greeted us, and continued to provide great service throughout our dinner. Our food was all great and we loved the bread they served as well. Personally, I ordered something that was new to the menu, chicken Riesling, and it was amazing. Afterwards, I had to order a cheesecake, some chocolate tuxedo cheesecake which was to die for. Overall we were extremely happy with our service, food and dining experience. I will definitely be back!"
Hazel P.,"Haltom City, TX",276,164,1345,3.0,2/21/2017,"Ok, this review is just for the cheesecake and the experience at the Bakery Counter. Jon and I came here the other night while we were having a little Fort Worth Date Night. We made the short walk over from Sundance Square and asked where we could order a slice to go, the hostess pointed us towards the Bakery Counter, which was surrounded by people, two of which were in line. The display case was immaculate, so many different flavors to choose from. After some careful consideration, and a fair amount of debate, we decide to split the Oreo Dream Extreme Slice.  The amount they charge for a slice or full cheesecake is absolutely heinous! Then again, it is specialty cheesecakes from a large chain restaurant, what did we expect?  The wait wasn't too bad, a bit slow for just getting a slice of cake, but it was evening/dinner time, so it's understandable that there would be a little wait. Thankfully we were in and out in around 20 mins or less. The only improvement I can think to suggest is to set up some kind of line or at least rope off a little section for people to wait for the bakery. There was a lot of traffic going by the counter, which was breaking up the line and people waiting at the counter. Pretty much just another layer of confusion that can be avoided.  After the short walk back to Sundance Square, we found an abandoned bench and went to work on our shared dessert. The cheesecake was absolutely fabulous. The Oreo Dream consists of layers of fudge cake and Oreo mousse, whole Oreo cookies in a layer of signature cheesecake and topped with milk chocolate icing, whipped cream on the side with a chocolate biscuit cookie. I felt it was a little heavy on the chocolate icing, which was thick and sickly sweet, but the cheesecake was so rich, creamy and filled with tasty Oreos.  It's been a while since I've eaten Cheesecake Factory, but the cheesecake is definitely as good as I remember. Will have to return for a meal and extra dessert."
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,4.0,12/17/2017,"Good food and service, very busy on a Saturday night. Massive menu. The Cucumber Mojito was superb, as ws the Korean Cauliflower was awesome. Of course, be sure to grab a piece of cheesecake for dessert. The Dulce de'Leche was superb."
Lindsey B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,3,1.0,1/8/2018,"Went to dinner this evening with my husband and son. Had a great meal and our waitress was very attentive... we paid our bill and waited for our to-go boxes, I went to use the restroom before heading home. As I walked into the woman's restroom, a smell hit me. I assumed someone was in the stall using the restroom, okay whatever no problem... it happens. As I go to walk into an open stall I find feces smeared all over the toilet and floor. I look down and realize I'm standing in it. As I walk backwards out of the stall, I see it's ALL OVER THE FLOOR. I quickly leave the bathroom to find a manager. An older gentleman on duty whom was the manager this evening came up to me. I quietly let him know how upset I was and the condition of the woman's restroom. His response- I kid you not, was ""sorry about that, I'll let someone know to go clean it"" and walked away! I spent $90 at this location on a meal that I had to drive home with someone else's feces on my brand new shoes. PITIFUL EXCUSE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT ONCE DID HE OFFER TO ADJUST OUR BILL OR OFFER DRY CLEANING SERVICES FOR MY SHOES- OR EVEN A BAG TO PUT THEM IN. When I called back up there to ask for cooperate's number, Vanessa the other manager apologized and said she was aware of the incident since had to go clean it- also acted like it wasn't a big deal. Said she would have to talk to her GM to see about possibly getting my shoes cleaned but other than that, she couldn't do much else other than apologize. I'm contacting the cooperate office and news stations about my horrible treatment if the GM does not contact me within 24hrs. HOW RIDICULOUS!"
Ava R.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,30,12,3.0,10/14/2017,My loved ones and I stopped by after discovering that Bird Cafe had run out of waffles. We were surprised that TCF served brunch and decided to wait 20 minutes to try it. Our waiter was polite however we weren't too impressed with the food. I don't think that we'll return for brunch
Ken T.,"Arlington, TX",113,48,14,2.0,9/4/2017,A long time fan of CF I date back to the original location in Beverly Hills and have dined at many of their locations. This one has been a big disappointment on all 3 visits.  My family of 7 went last night upon all my rave reviews and I felt embarrassed. The bread came out and was cold and stale and should have been thrown out hours earlier. I ordered the Steak Diane and it arrived with the entree in disarray on half of the plate. The server said they were out of mashed potatoes but would have some soon. Seriously??? How do you run out of mashed potatoes?  Why would you even serve half of an entree to begin with? The entrees all arrived sporadically (not together) and my niece also got a partial plate minus the mashed potatoes. My sister had the Santa Fe salad which had wilted lettuce but tasted good nonetheless. The presentations lacked the pop that is the CG signature. My favorite cheesecake is the Lemon Meringue.  Mine came out looking like it just emerged from the frozen food case at Albertsons. No garnish and leaning. Nothing like the pristine presentations online or served at the other locations.  If the server hadn't been so good and worked so hard I would have stepped away to speak with the manager.  A last note is that usually along with the beautiful elegance of the CF the serving staff is usually equally polished and fresh faced.  One of the servers was extremely disheveled and looked as if he'd been sleeping in his clothes. This store is far from the CF standards and a huge disappointment when compared to their other locations. For future visitors I suggest going to one of their other locations and plan to be wowed.  It probably won't happen at this one.
Kenya M.,"Indianapolis, IN",146,3,5,3.0,11/22/2017,"Normally would give a 4.5 rating or even 5 but our waitress was terrible this evening.  She had the driest personality, she threw away our leftovers instead of packing it to go, and my boyfriend shared its my birthday and she didn't even put in a request for bday song; she brought the complimentary birthday dessert but melted down with no bday candle or song.  Food was good but service NOT!!"
Wana L.,"Fort Worth, TX",10,4,1,4.0,9/6/2017,"Really enjoyed it, hubby and I went for my birthday.. Food was great! Went on a Sunday afternoon, good service, nice portions, valet service and a birthday serenade.. I'm not complaining"
Katie A.,"Vestal, NY",116,33,12,2.0,12/27/2017,"Okay if I did not have previous good experiences this would be a 1 star. So do know that I have had good experiences here but this one was so hilariously awkwardly bad I had to yelp it. I recently went to Cheesecake Factory with a few friends for dessert.  Our server John was great came promptly to take our order  and was friendly courteous and professional. Sadly enough another young man delivered our cheesecake. At that point one of the guys in our party asked him hey something's on the side of my cup do you know what it is and the server looked at it and just responded ""A booger... Enjoy"" and walked off. The entire table set in awkward silence with awkward laughter. No one could believe that a server had just honestly said that there was a booger on his cup even jokingly and then walked away without offering to fix it or get him a new glass of something to drink. He was very cocky and acted like the world just loved and adored him.  We talked to young woman who was very kind at the hostess desk who promptly got us a new drink.  Then the cocky young man came back over like nothing had happened and just said ""hey can I get you anything or can I do anything for you?"" His tone was dripping with sarcasm and attitude. As the guys at the table began to say that it was really rude and in poor taste the waiter just begin to make excuses and said oh I was just joking it's not really a booger. We all knew that it was a joke it was just very poor taste.  Bottom line he was rude and continued to be unprofessional.  His tone that he used with his poor excuse of an apology was haughty and his demeanor whenever he came back to apologize was just even more rude. The server's apology was steeped with excuses of his bad day as if that would make being rude to a paying customer okay when we were nothing but kind to start with. I understand having a bad day but I don't appreciate you taking it out with poor humor towards me or my friends. It is distasteful and disrespectful.   The manager did comp the drink and one slice of cheesecake.  Which was a kind gesture on her part. (Also another reason for 2 stars instead of 1 star)"
M M.,"Fort Worth, TX",55,3,,2.0,8/9/2017,Bad customer service. We had a party of 15 arrived at 5:30 & were told hour to hour 15 mins.  When we approached the front desk both (2 females) hostesses were rude & abrupt towards my mother & myself.  Explaining with their hands how long she said it would be.  1hour 40 mins later we finally were rudely called to our tables.  And I did mention to them how they had seated 2 parties of 10 before us.  The last manager (male) we spoke with was a lot more professional but the damage was already done by then. My daughter chose Cheesecake Factory for her 15th bday dinner & I didn't want to ruin her day or I would have left any other time.  Good customer service goes a long way & they were far from it tonight. And this was on a Wednesday evening & the restaurant was never overcrowded the entire evening.
Hannah N.,"Fort Worth, TX",97,134,663,3.0,2/6/2017,"Stopped by on a Saturday night to grab a few slices of cheesecake to-go to enjoy on the Square. I understand the restaurant is bound to be busy, but I wished they had more people working at the cheesecake/to-go counter. It took a good half hour to get in line (only 2 people ahead of us), place and pay for our order, and then wait for it to be packaged. But it's cheesecake and I can't stay mad too long. Yummm!"
Aaron S.,"Dallas, TX",174,21,43,4.0,8/12/2017,Great food as always.  The wait took way to long. We showed up 1 hour before our friends came and still had to wait anther 54min for a seat.
Rebecca S.,"Temecula, CA",0,16,16,1.0,11/20/2017,One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory!! New front end management needed ! Completely understaffed for Sunday Christmas parade of lights.. management should be held accountable for not scheduling enough servers for this great event.. on arrival I counted 15 booths outside on the patio that were empty and the waiting room full of people. I asked the manager why!! He explained there were not enough servers outside. Then he should've started waiting tables himself ! After 2hours of waiting we were seated.! I praise the management Who ran the kitchen only ! Fast efficient  Good food.
Matt E.,"Burleson, TX",1,39,6,3.0,3/31/2017,Not a lot to say here.. It is the cheesecake factory..   Lots of food.. not real expensive but def not cheap either. Tip Time - Do not order a dinner and expect to eat it by yourself.. if you can't take things home then share a meal!
Courtney T.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,4,3,3.0,7/16/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, however, I am very unimpressed with this last visit. The server, Dallas was not very good, had to basically yell at him to bring another refill of my drink. Seemed very uninterested in serving my friends and I, and didn't come to the table very much even though they were not that busy. I saw other servers going to their tables a lot so I am not sure as to why ours was this way. I won't be back as a result. Hopefully they can get better staff that truly know the importance of customer service. If you know better, you'll do better."
Jia S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/21/2017,We've been waiting for three hours in the store and checking in with the staff every several minutes. The store gives our table away right in front of us after three hours of waiting. We did get four appetizers in the house. However I would definitely say the system of them getting in contact with the customer is not working.
T S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Simply put. This was a thorough waste of my money. I was actually sitting at the table and couldn't wait to get to Yelp on this experience. I paid $21.00 for a mountain of regularly tasting angel hair pasta and 5 undersized shrimp.....5.... 1,2,3,4......5 unimpressive sized shrimp. When I inquired about the mountain of pasta and the 5 shrimp garnishment, I was meant with an air of ""so what""... I tried to ration the shrimp for the ridiculous ratio of pasta, but I actually said ""Phuck it. I'm not wasting my time with this.""... I eat out a lot at the various restaurants downtown for lunch and dinner, and I can't remember the last time I said that I should've just gave my money to the panhandler who said he would work for beer!!!"
Amanda S.,"Austin, TX",1069,644,5670,2.0,4/26/2016,"I met up with a friend here when I was in town and she picked Cheesecake Factory.  It is one of her favorite places.  The thing with Cheesecake Factory is that their menu is HUGE.  So huge it makes it hard for them to really do anything really well.  I have learned the the best thing on the menu in my opinion to get here is the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  All the portions are huge at Cheesecake Factory and the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps are as well.  Although they are huge I can eat these or share them and not be too full for dessert - cheesecake - duh!  That's the whole point of coming here.  My friend ordered the Skinny Tomato Basil Pasta dish.  Our food came out and about 10 minutes later the manager approached our table to apologize that she had gotten the wrong dish and she was in fact not eating the skinny version, but the regular.  The manager and waiter were super apologetic, but I really felt like if their menu was smaller something like this wouldn't have happened.  My friend just blew it off and continued to eat her high calorie meal.   The cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is usually the best thing about the visit.  This visit I went all out and got the turtle and it was great.  I have had the Vanilla Bean in the past and it is also good.  Cheesecake Factory definitely has some issues.  It's not my favorite place to eat and probably never will be, but I feel like they are not marketing to me either ... or maybe they are and that is why their menu is so big... they are trying to please everyone... meh it could be better."
Sher F.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/20/2017,We have ordered cheesecakes twice to be picked up for a company function. Both times the cheesecake were frozen. The second time they didn't take down the order. We do not understand why they can not take call in orders and have the cheesecake ready for pick up? After the first time we wanted to give it another chance. There will not be a third.
Shlomi R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Worse service ever! By Vanessa marquez the manager over there. AVOID this location, i've been eating in soo many of their locations and this one is the worse one yet!"
Ritchel C.,"San Francisco, CA",181,27,16,1.0,10/10/2017,"CRAPPY SLOW SERVICE. Every time I've came here, they have managed to either fxck up, or completely forget about an order. I remember I came here once, waitress MADELINE got my drink order wrong, I politely corrected her I in which she clearly looked pissed and annoyed ( which made me laugh by the way aha! as if she has the nerve to be the one pissed and annoyed ) when she came back with my drink, SHE LITERALLY DROPPED IT OFF AT THE TABLE WITHOUT SAYING A FREAKING WORD ,  not an I'm sorry, or anything . Again .. made me laugh. Then went over to her waiter friend and started talking a whole bunch of crap I guess because they kept looking at our table. Best believe our tip reflected the shitty customer service . BTW she never even came back to drop off the check, another waiter did. HOPE THE GIRL GETS SOME BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS."
Sarah T.,"Arlington, TX",1,45,46,2.0,12/12/2017,"This location always has a wait so we were surprised to be able to walk in and be seated right at noon. The server was nice and informed us the bread was in the oven. It took 15-20 minutes for the bread to arrive. The worst part was waiting around 45 minutes for Chicken Alfredo and Eggplant Parmesan. It was delivered by another server who said ""thanks for the patience we're slammed"". The Chicken Alfredo had been sitting for quite some time. The bowl was hot and the noodles were hard and stuck together. The Alfredo was runny with no flavor. My husband asked me to take a bite and I could barely eat it. My eggplant Parmesan wasn't very warm and was mostly breading. The noodles were not cooked all the way either. The reason we gave 2 stars was because the manager did take off the Alfredo. (But not that $3 Diet Coke he had to drink to wash the few bites he took down). The wait for food was a little Long for a downtown location, not a good Work lunch unless you can give an extra 30 minutes.  The food was terrible which neither of us ate. For the price tag not worth the visit. $30 for 2 drinks and one meal we didn't eat(we did tip the server- she didn't cook it).  We love Fort Worth and have had good experiences at other CCF, But we won't be back to this location."
Stephen L.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,228,687,5.0,11/12/2016,"Food was great! Tasty and well presented on the plates. Staff was kind and service was excellent. I drink a LOT if water in my meals and the waitress kept up with no problem. Other staff picked up plates immediately when we finished. And the manager saying by our table to make sure everything was good. Cheesecakes are very expensive though, quite a few at $50+, but they looked worth the money."
Crissy R.,"Fort Worth, TX",15,37,33,3.0,7/2/2017,"The service was great, Trey was excellent, although he mixed up the leftovers at the end. All the cheesecake was awesome, the Cajun pasta was great and tasty, the appetizers were  very tasty. The chicken piccata, and the other shrimp pasta dish were horrible, no flavor, but Trey did address it adequelty and was nice about it. All and all despite the main dishes we did not like it was a great overall experience."
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,2/26/2016,"I refuse to deny my love for the Cheesecake Factory. Mock me if you must, but I'm never disappointed with their food, service, and especially not with their cheesecakes. I prefer some more than others (really not a fan of their red velvet cheesecake), but I always enjoy the meals I have here. And honestly, how can you not love a place that sells a stuffed penguin wearing a t-shirt with their logo on it?  This is a prime location in the heart of Sundance Square with a convenient parking garage next door that is free after 5 pm on weeknights. The garage attendant was the sweetest older lady I think I've ever met proving yet again that Ft Worth people truly are nicer than Dallas snobs. (I'm allowed to say that being one myself, so refrain your hate mail please). The inside is spacious and our service was on point. Drinks came out quickly and the complimentary bread was served piping hot.  I've never had a bad dish so I say try anything that sounds good, but I particularly like their SkinnyLicious menu. My favorites from it include the little house salad, Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos, grilled artichoke, basil tomato and mozzarella flatbread, chopped salad, Mexican tortilla salad, and the white chicken chili which is what I ordered last night. It has chicken, white beans, roasted green chilies, onions, garlic, a touch of cream, fresh salsa, and your choice of either white or brown rice for $13.95. It's both filling and full of flavor without the guilt since it's under 590 calories.  The guilt comes alongside the cheesecake and is worth every bite! The one I love most is the Dulce De Leche with its swirls of caramel, real whipped cream, and candied almond crumbles. Have Mercy. Honorable mentions include the Original, Vanilla Bean, Fresh Strawberry, Fresh Banana Cream, and two new ones (to me) I had the pleasure of trying last night. The Tiramisu (I die) and the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee. I'm not a big chocolate person but that one just might convert me. It is divine! The Kahlua flavor is subtle enough that you dangerously keep wanting to go back in for another bite.  I will be a return customer for sure. Might as well book me a regular table in the fall when the return of the pumpkin pecan cheesecake arrives."
Gary L.,"Fort Worth, TX",56,116,55,2.0,9/15/2016,"I was Alil disappointed coming to this location during Lunch time. The service is what really disappointed me about this visit... So we arrived about 1:59 pm on a Monday to found just one table of two lady's.. Upon looking around I notice they had about maybe 8 waiters on staff and some type of staff gathering in one of the far away booths.. So with that been said I see the cooks out of the kitchen ... The wait staff just having a ball and I still haven't received my food!!!  Food finally came 46 mins upon arriving I get my Luke warm food... Took forever to get my food especially since nobody was there !!!! ????  I wasn't pleased at all and the funny part I've been here on a weekend, an have received my food much faster ??? How is this possible??? SERVICE THAT DAY WAS A FAIL.COM"
Jennifer M.,"Euless, TX",30,6,,4.0,10/8/2017,"This place has the best food, lunch today was great. Had the Louisiana pasta and a Caesar salad."
Leslie B.,"Crowley, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/16/2017,"This place has to be the worst experience I have ever had out with a large group.  First of all they only take reservations at 11am. Great if you only want to do brunch.  When we arrived we were told 2.5 hour wait. We kept checking with the desk and continued to get the it will be another 1.20 hour wait. Ridiculous.  From now on our large family dinners will be spent at Pappadeaux's where we will be treated better and, allowed to make reservations. We will gladly take our $800 tab plus great tips to another place."
Thalia T.,"Mansfield, TX",0,18,4,4.0,5/7/2017,"Yes, I know this is a chain restaurant but I love The Cheesecake Factory. Stopped in on a Saturday night about 8:30. Bar seating was open without a wait and you can order from the full menu. We ordered just dessert and drinks. Always good."
