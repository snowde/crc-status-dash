Vivienne M.,"Benbrook, TX",0,8,1,5.0,8/20/2016,"I came her with pretty low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The bread they bring at the beginning was so good, always warm, and soft. I got the pit beef dip and thought it was delicious. I typically do not like cheesecake, but we ended up sharing a smores cheesecake which was surprisingly very good. All in all I would recommend at least trying this place out. You may be pleasantly surprised."
Finla P.,"Redmond, WA",19,118,66,5.0,5/20/2016,"I have always liked the food served in this place. Two of my favorites are Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken, Jamaican spicy Chicken. Last weekend the husband and I were in the mood to eat some bang bang shrimp and chicken dish, when the order arrived, it tasted different. Something was off about the it. We spoke to our server about it. Her name is Becky, she was sweet about it and offered to remake the dish or get us a different one, whatever we wanted. She also informed the manager, Ryan, who apologized for human mistakes that happens sometimes and was so well mannered and took care of us well. We decided to try out a new dish instead-vegan salad. It was great. Now this review is not just for the great tasting food that we get here, but also to people like Becky & Ryan, who make customers happy."
Andrea E.,"Burleson, TX",0,2,1,1.0,8/12/2017,"I wish I could give less than 1 star. I ordered a cheesecake for a friends birthday party ahead of time, and when I went to pick it up, I told the hostess I was there to pick up a cake. She pointed to the bakery, so I get in line, and wait while people order individual slices...but I ordered ahead of time and still had to wait. Then I pay, and the girl says it'll be ready in a few minutes yet doesn't tell anyone that I'm there to pick up. She keeps taking orders. After about 5 min i asked her if it was ready and she told me someone needed to go get it out of the freezer. And continued to take orders without asking anyone to get it. I asked what the point of ordering ahead is, if I still have to wait? She got an attitude and walked off in a huff to get the manager while complaining about me to her coworker instead of answering me. The manager came over, was very nice and I got my cake after another 5 minutes. 20 minutes of waiting for a preordered cake. The employer and the experience were terrible however, so I will not be returning."
Danielle M.,"Fort Worth, TX",59,130,82,3.0,12/5/2015,"3.5 stars. I had the tuna tartare & the Asian chicken wraps. Wraps taste better without the rice pasta imo, wish they had some sort of crispy noodle instead or more crisp veggies. The tartare was great but wish it had an extra crisp or two! I finished off with a cherry cheesecake. Classic but always good."
Christopher H.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,40,300,4.0,11/21/2015,"While the wait was spilling out the doors of this place on a Friday night, we were just here for the company's namesake.  We were able to walk straight up to the counter where we indulged ourselves in some sweets to split.  We came home with two slices of cheesecake, the lemon raspberry and the vanilla bean.  The vanilla bean cheesecake reminds me of quality vanilla ice cream that can be eaten at room temperature.  The lemon raspberry is a mix of sweet and sour, but it would have been nice to have more noticeable flavors. They're alright at cheesecake, but that's the only thing I can attest to."
Christopher W.,"New Orleans, LA",629,1013,1091,4.0,5/28/2015,Great location across the street from one of the most famous playhouses in the country. I came in for dessert and was not disappointed at this location has the same rich selection of cheesecake choices. A little on the high side but the quality is beyond what you can get outside of NYC. The restaurant continues the art deco style that you see across the street. The prices are a little steep but what would you expect in this location.
Sarath P.,"Fort Worth, TX",112,393,373,3.0,6/29/2015,"This place is high-dolla(mostly for lunch) and if you don't go at the right time... you are going to have a LONG wait. I don't frequent this location much unless a coworker has a hankering but I always make sure to be there at 11AM when it opens -- I remember one time when we were leaving I heard the hostess tell someone it would be a 2 hour wait... umm what?! My favorite thing at the Cheesecake Factory is the shrimp and bacon club sandwich but man, it's so freakin' unhealthy so I usually order the lunch size cobb salad. It's actually a really nice size salad and filling and not too high calorie of an option. If you come here, plan ahead -- nothing sucks more than being hungry, having your mind on a certain item to order and then having to leave to go somewhere else because you can't handle waiting 2 hours to be seated."
The Secret Critic N.,"Fort Worth, TX",39,34,3,5.0,8/3/2016,Really good food but the cheesecake is obviously the highlight of the visit. Pretty mad they stopped selling the pineapple upside-down cheesecake but there are plenty more to choose from that are worth trying.
Miranda B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,2,2.0,7/24/2017,"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. They have a great menu and offer something no matter what you're in the mood for. We recently came to celebrate my daughter's 10th birthday. The food was excellent, as always - hence the 2 stars. The only issue with the food was the house salad came with such little dressing, it basically was dry. We only saw our waitress one time between the time she took our order and the time time our delivered - which was nearly 20 minutes. We sat with empty drinks for 15 minutes, and as she ""checked on us"" while walking by our table, I asked for refills. Food came out, and it was great. Because of our absent waitress, my salad plate sat on the table the entire time, along with all of our dinner plates and empty glasses. From the time our glasses were placed on the table, to the time we signed our check, not one thing was bused from our table (which was a 6 top booth with 5 children and 2 adults). Forget about ordering desert, even if we could find our waitress, we wouldn't have told her it was a special birthday. Who'd want to eat cheesecake at a table full of dirty dishes?  We went to It's Sugar around the corner instead."
Lisette A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2016,I would have given no stars but it wouldn't let me because we sat for over an hour with no food. Our waiter told us twice he checked on our food and said they were working on it. At this point the rest of the tables around us tht were sat after us started getting their food. We talked to the manager because we had a shoe to catch he explained he glitch in the internet and said sorry they just started our food. We are still waiting. He couldn't tell us how long it would be for the food. We came early to eat and now will have approximately less than 30 min to eat prior to the show. I would not recommend this restaurant. Yes it is convenient. But the service is horrible!
Sarah D.,"Fort Worth, TX",17,77,136,5.0,10/16/2015,"My family of four meet up with a birthday party for dinner tonight. Our first time to visit. Loved everything from the kale salad, to the hibachi steak followed with the Kahlua cheesecake! Great service, tasty food and loved the outdoor seating."
Lydia S.,"Fort Worth, TX",58,60,8,5.0,6/22/2015,"I get that everyone's experience is a little bit different at a restaurant, especially a large chain like The Cheesecake Factory, but I didn't expect to read so many negative reviews.  I've been to other locations, but this has been by far the best experience. We had an absolutely FANTASTIC waitress (Halee) who made our dining experience fantastic. We had no wait to be seated on a Sunday night. Our drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert all came out in a timely fashion. We were never left wondering, ""Uh, where is our food?""  It's true, the price is slightly ""expensive"" but do you people realize how much freaking food you are actually getting? I may have paid close to $17 for the spicky chicken cashew dish, but that will give me leftovers to TWO additional meals. We had the calamari appetizer and that was HUGE, too! I think that you get what you pay for here. Even though our meal was over $80 pre-tip, I would still go back... and I wouldn't complain about paying for a cent of it!  Our cocktails were amazing. I would suggest the passionfruit margarita! The spicy pineapple margariata was actually spicy, which is hard to find even if it is marketed as spicy. And of course, our cheesecake was to die for. The Adam's peanut butter was sooo good.  I really hope people can start to look pass the price and realize that they're getting good food, large portions and outstanding service in a fun environment. We will definitely be back! We just hope that Halee is our waitress again because she made our dining experience amazing!"
Nancy M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,5,1.0,12/17/2016,Super b** front girls and insanely long waiting (1.5hrs) thanks to the waitress - she said one hour originally. This is how you treat your customer. Good job
David A.,"Fort Worth, TX",64,16,2,1.0,8/8/2015,"Service at this location is horrible compared to the Southlake location we usually go to. We went here for my daughter's birthday because we wanted to be in Sundance Square but we will not be back. Everyone's food except for my daughter's came out and our food was cold after the additional 10 minute wait for her quick pasta dish. When I told the waitress I didn't want this to go against her tip and that I wanted to explain the situation to the manager, he finally came out a few minutes later with a half apology but clearly oblivious to how frustrated we were with the situation. To not offer to take care of her plate and to give some poor excuses and walk away is subpar.  The servers were really sweet and came out and sang happy birthday and I left 20% but that manager has some opportunity when it comes to customer service."
shauna w.,"Bastrop, TX",0,9,,1.0,5/8/2016,"We just left. There were 8 of us for Mothers Day. A comedy of errors... Only 7 meals were delivered, missing an eggs benedict. We asked for the last meal? and the waiter went to the kitchen and came back to say it was coming soon.  He had double-checked our orders so I'm pretty sure it was a kitchen issue. My sister's egg benedict was literally not just lukewarm, but actually cold. So now we needed 2 eggs benedicts. They were not expedited out, so we were all through eating when the other 2 meals arrived. And they were dropped off without anyone asking if everything was ok. Both were cold. My sister had everyone touch hers so we wouldn't think she was being dramatic.  Cold. The replacement eggs benedict were colder than the original cold eggs benedict. Soup wasn't hot, crab hash wasn't hot (lukewarm and the poached egg was basically boiled), french toast barely warm.  We all waited tables in school. Major kitchen issues at that restaurant. My husband and I drove 4 hrs each way to meet my mom and sisters there for a special meal. Sigh. Meanwhile the Mothers Day line is growing at the door. We arrived at 10:00am, ordered at 10:25am, and everyone still had not eaten by 11:30am. I truly felt sorry for all those people, knowing what they were in for... The mgrs did come to the table of course. We didn't pay for the 2 meals that were never delivered. We are not considering cold eggs dishes as ""delivered."" They gave everyone a free dessert. Lots of apologies.  Why on Earth did they offer a full menu when they clearly couldn't deliver it? Bad management decision. And they were under-staffed. And the kitchen issues are obvious. I left a good tip because the waiter tried his best. And we were all so thankful that we aren't waiting tables these days."
Kelley T.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,34,3,1.0,12/22/2014,"If I could give less than one star I would. I realize being a new place and all that there might be a few opening week/month problem with a few things..but EVERYTHING! The service was non-existent after being seated waiter took our drink orders and returned 30min later with our waters set them down and off he flew for another 20min before returning to take our order, when our food arrived another server brought it to our table as our waiter was no where to be seen. After all that the food was just OK ..nothing to write home around, I've had much better in my own kitchen. Oh have I mentioned that we STILL haven't seen our waiter or anyone else for that matter, ""is everything ok"" ""do you need anything"" ""can I refill that water"". Hell at this point had we been smart or dishonest we could have just gotten up and walked out no one would have even noticed lol If you have all day to waste this is the place for you yum yum"
Waymon P.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,,1.0,12/2/2016,"Worst costumer service ever. Went there July 4 because it was convenient to the theater around the corner where we had tickets. After waiting nearly an hour, the manager came by to tell us our waitress had failed to put in our order. We ended up having popcorn for our meal. Tonight we decided to give them another try. We placed our order, then we waited, and waited, and waiters some more. I finally, after over a half our of not seeing our waitress, went to the front and asked the manager on duty to accompany me back to my table. I explained that after such a wait, we had yet to receive our appetizer, were out of bread, and our tea glasses were empty. He explained that they had trouble getting decent help, and he was aware of this because of the bad Yelp reviews they were receiving ( here is another one Sir) . As we were speaking, our appetizer finally arrived, accompanied by our main courses. I told his this was totally unacceptable, to which he replied, ""What do you want me to do?"". I resisted the temptation to tell him what he could do and chose to leave and find a more pleasant place to enjoy my dinner.. I suggest given the choices, you explore other options, as I will be doing in the future."
Brian O.,"New Orleans, LA",84,196,211,3.0,6/2/2015,Over the top decor at this fort worth location. Bit pricy. Pleasant servers. Good variety of desserts
Jocelyne L.,"Fort Worth, TX",10,3,1,1.0,12/18/2014,"If I could give no stars, I would. We waited 2 hours to be seated.. ON A WEDNESDAY . Now I understand it's new but to not even apologize or to not inform us of the status of our wait is unheard of. But I will say that the our waiters Patrick and Hilary were wonderful.  Now let's get to the food. My friend sent his pasta back because the chicken wasn't cooked properly and when he got his second plate the food was not impressionable . I mean I've made better spaghetti . Not to mention he got food poisoning and I have a rash all over my body . I am not allergic to much actually nothing at all. So for me to break out is absolutely out of the ordinary . I will not be back."
Nora H.,"Fort Worth, TX",148,67,64,4.0,12/20/2014,"Came here last night with a group of 4. I was obviously aware the wait would be long because it's in downtown and its new. The good thing was the hostess took my name and we were able to leave and walk around downtown, they would text us when the table was ready. Came back about an hour later, we were seated and our waitress Heather was really good! She seriously made our night. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, which were amazing!! And my entree was the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. At first the taste was overwhelming and the plate was huge, but I ended up loving it. My boyfriend loved his fried catfish plate. His only complaint was that the portion size wasn't enough. My brother also had what I had and he just LOVED it. My mom also really loved her Shrimp plate.  The place is beautiful. The service is great. The food is pretty damn good. And the cheesecake is always fulfilling."
