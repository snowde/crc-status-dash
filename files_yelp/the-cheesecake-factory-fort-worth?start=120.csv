Chris W.,"Fort Worth, TX",14,25,,2.0,3/20/2016,I've heard good things about this place so I figured it was worth a try. I was wrong our waitress was nice but forgot our meatball and Ricotta appetizer. After we got our food I was glad she forgot it. They say they make everything in house but it tasted to me like everything came out of a jar. If you are downtown and hungry please go to one of our locally owned businesses instead.  Cheesecake Factory  is a glorified chili's at best.
Debbie M.,"Fort Worth, TX",58,34,16,1.0,7/30/2016,"Went to lunch today with my mom to celebrate National Cheesecake Day.  It was such a disappointment from the moment we sat down til the moment we left. They ran out of Avocado Egg Rolls which is our favorite appetizer, my Shrimp sandwich on a Brioche roll along with the fries was cold and not much shrimp as noted on the menu and the Brioche roll was a hot dog bun. Mom didn't get her salad with her burger after the waiter said it was on the way, we asked for it after we realized it wasn't coming, when it finally came out it was very warm and wilted. Ordered 5 pieces of cheesecake which were cut a lot thinner then the other times we've eaten here, could be because it's national cheesecake day so they're 1/2 price so they sliced em 1/2 too. And they forgot one piece and we got tired of waiting so we went to the counter to get it ourselves. Manager was apologetic but looked and sounded like she'd been doing that all day and was wore out. Won't come to this location again, maybe Southlake as we used to go there and it's always terrific."
Ann H.,"Fort Worth, TX",537,105,66,2.0,1/24/2015,We came in on a Saturday for lunch and were seated immediately. After ordering we had to ask for bread which at other locations they're usually very generous and quick about. The biggest annoyance was that the boyfriend ordered a chorizo avocado omelet with no cheese and it came out with cheese and no avocado... what. I ate everything the cheese touched for him and the rest of the meal was fine as well as our nice waiter.
Chianti J.,"Fort Worth, TX",44,5,1,2.0,7/30/2016,This was my third trip to the factory(probably last) and they failed to impress . The food was just OK and the size of my cheesecake that I ordered to go was just enough to satisfy a toddler.  For the prices you would think there would be better quality and quantity.
Jane F.,"North Richland Hills, TX",77,9,3,3.0,7/13/2015,"The food was tasty in the light menu. Enjoyed it very much. The time it took to get our food out was pretty bad. The manager came by and apologized, but it didn't move any faster.  The skinny mojito was way overpriced.  Nice looking location in the old Barnes and noble downtown."
Michael B.,"Fort Worth, TX",47,2,5,2.0,8/16/2015,"The appetizer serving sizes are huge; my table shared an order of factory nachos which were good. Our waitress named Hillary was rather good at serving but did not show up frequently enough to keep the waters filled. I then ordered the chicken, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. This was a delicious entrée, but the potatoes were rather salty. We arrived at 5pm, waited an hour and 15 minutes for our appetizer to arrive, but then we were done with the meal by 7:45pm. The best part of my meal was my two cosmopolitans: beware! They are overpriced and you do not know until you're ready to pay. Each drink was $11 each. Sodas and teas are $3 each, but the waiters and waitresses do not show up frequently enough to make it fair to say you get more to drink for $3, because you might get one refill if you're lucky! There is no background music of any kind, only road noise and crowded dining room conversations. Food flavor was mediocre, but I would not say it was worth the prices. Definitely a party and celebration atmosphere, but it isn't worth it otherwise."
Destiny M.,"Grapevine, TX",16,3,1,4.0,3/28/2016,"I went around 6:30 Friday night and it was pretty busy, however we were seated in 20 minutes which gave us time to venture out and visit sun dance square. I had the macaroni burger with tomato and basil flatbread as an appetizer and it was very good"
Elizabeth V.,"Harker Heights, TX",1,15,,1.0,11/13/2015,"I was excited to try to famous Cheesecake Factory. However, my experience left me never caring if I ever go back again. There were 3 of us in my party on Thursday night. We sat at the bar. The bartender never looked at us once. Another gentleman took our drink order. We promptly received a bill for our drink but we're never given our drinks we sat at the bar 25 minutes and never received our drinks. When we were seated we asked about ordering drinks from the bar and told there was a teacher convention in town and they were slammed. We informed our waiter that we were in fact attending the convention. Heres the thing I don't understand, they are located .4 miles from the convention center... Aren't there usually conventions? It took us 35 mins to get our food. The food was a disappointment and I'm pretty sure I will be going to the Cheesecake Factory any time soon."
Meghan R.,"Rochester, MI",82,55,23,5.0,10/19/2015,"We'll my 16 year old daughter wanted to spend her birthday in Fortworth with family, and also wanted to eat at The cheese cake factory... We live in Michigan and we don't have one that's close... Anyway I went on yelp and saw that the reviews were less then stellar , we went anyway and had a great time, 9 adults two toddlers and 2 infants, the food was great the drinks were better the service was great they even brought cheese cake for my daughter and sang Happy Birthday... I'm in Fortworth often and yes I'll be coming back to eat that yummy food"
Laisha M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/16/2017,i am outraged at the service here.  the cooks take too long making my friends and my pasta. we have beeen sitting here for an hour with nothig bread and water. oh the outrage of teen rebellion.
Salene T.,"McKinney, TX",7,35,4,2.0,11/1/2015,"We have been to several of this chain and none so bad as the one in Fort Worth. A few of us order pasta and they were so salty we had to send them back. The hamburger buns and the rice noodles on my salad were extremely stale. Giving 2 stars instead of one is due to our server, he was patient and accommodating."
Ashley D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/7/2015,"Horrible. Pick somewhere, anywhere else. Chose this place because it was right across from Bass Hall. And because it's the Cheesecake Factory! Should I need to explain more. Ordered Fiesta-type chicken salad (forgot exact name). It came to the table missing the chicken and the avocado. Ordered a Tequila shot, that cost $9, it had been watered down significantly. The table next to us mentioned that they ordered a coffee and the waitress said it would take a while to bring it because they didn't have any clean coffee cups. Just go somewhere else! There are so many other good places in Sundance Square."
Lindsay M.,"Fort Worth, TX",25,4,,1.0,2/26/2016,"Very rude, tried to make a reservation but was denied, then was told that our group would have to wait 4 hours and still not be able to sit together. Not going back to this location ever."
Crafty S.,"Kennedale, TX",0,15,8,3.0,2/14/2016,"I can see the pros and cons of this location.  It's next to a movie theater, bass hall and sundance square.  Chances are they will be very busy and understaffed. Like the night the wife and I went there was a performance at bass hall and a line out the door.  So yeah service is going to be hit and miss but your food will be better than average. Proceed with caution."
Marisol L.,"Eastside, Fort Worth, TX",43,12,2,1.0,8/15/2015,If you want Better service drive to Southlake!!! Trust me it is worth it!! The staff there is a lot nicer than the staff here in Sundance.
Christy H.,"Taylor, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/29/2016,"Great food, terrible service. We were probably some of the first customers on a Sunday morning and were seated promptly. Our waiter, Bryce, showed up to take our drink orders. Those took a while but we did not mind because he brought water while we waited. We really didn't need appetizers, but he pressed us to try the fried macaroni & cheese. Talked it up really well, so we figured we'd try. They never came. We placed our orders for entrees and they were delivered by another server, and we asked him about the fried macaroni & cheese. He told us he would ask about it. One in our party had asked for a side dish that never came. Next time Bryce came around we again asked about the macaroni & cheese. He said, ""They overcooked the first round, that will be right out."" No, it wasn't. He came back and apologized because at this point, we are halfway through eating our entree and hadn't received our appetizer. He told us that he felt so bad he wouldn't charge us and kept promising that it was on its way out. No, it wasn't. The food that we did receive was actually delicious, but we were still wondering about that fried macaroni & cheese. One in our party asked for her leftovers to be boxed up and she also ordered a slice of cheesecake to go. We waited for more than 20 minutes for the food to be returned to us, and even then we had to ask for it. Bryce brought our check and it had the macaroni & cheese on it. But they had forgotten to charge us for the cheesecake, so we figured it was close enough a wash and decided to not make a big deal. We added a tip (believe it or not) and signed the ticket, and then Bryce shows up with a new ticket, apologizing for having added the macaroni & cheese that we never received and that he said he would pay for himself, and this time the cheesecake has been added. It made our bill about $4 less. OK. And when we asked where the macaroni & cheese was he said, ""They are boxing it up now and it will be right out."" Well, that became the theme quote of our entire trip. And at this point, we're still waiting on the boxed up leftovers to be returned to us. And when we asked again they looked at us like we were speaking a foreign language and then we were told, ""We had a spill, we're getting that right out."" And we had to wonder if they had thrown it in the trash and dug it out again. Did I mention that the fried macaroni and cheese never came?"
R.j. H.,"Manhattan, KS",2,17,4,1.0,5/25/2015,"I don't get it. I've been to The Cheese Cake Factory before in Kansas city and it was great. I move here and this one is ridiculous. Horrible wait times for food and drinks, the wait staff is rude and very impolite, and the food is not what it should be. My wife got the Baja chicken tacos with no tomatoes, apparently they took that as remove all the flavor. Then it took another 30 minutes to get them remade. So she cancelled them the second time around. This isn't the first bad occurrence here. Won't be coming back any time soon. Sad to say I am no longer a cheese cake factory fan."
Aaron O.,"Lexington, KY",23,51,122,3.0,5/10/2016,"Came here on the Saturday before Mother's Day. I realized it would be busy and since they don't take reservations I knew there could be a wait. I got there in the early evening and was told there would be a 40 minute wait, no problem right? Wrong. After waiting 40 minutes I went inside and asked the hostess how much longer. She told me that she had no idea. This made me upset because if they didn't know then how in the heck did they know when I got there it would be 40 minutes? We continued waiting, for an hour and a half which at that point we decided to sit in the lounge area which right when we sat down I got the text that our table was ready, oh well. All of our food came out at a decent time. The spinach dip appetizer was great but the margherita pizza was below average. All our meals were good except one of us ordered a salad and it didn't have any ingredients except lettuce and tomatoes. It was missing chicken, tortilla strips, and many other toppings. The manager came over and apologized. They took off the salad and gave us a free cheesecake. The meal was good but by the time we left had been there wait time included for 3+ hours. Luckily I was with good company so the long wait didn't matter as much. I would go back and give them another shot."
Rebekah W.,"Benbrook, TX",2,5,,1.0,10/1/2015,"I have been to this location 6 times since it opened and only twice have I had good experiences. The first being on the training days and then a weekend night with my parents. I've had burnt steak, over cooked dry hamburger and Sunday my dinner made me sick. So I've missed work during an important week because the food I received which seem to be frozen food that must not have been cooked properly. My finance's meatball was defiantly a frozen meatball and I'm pretty sure the Orange Chicken is Tyson's frozen Orange Chicken. I am not impressed with this location."
Kim H.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,22,8,1.0,2/26/2015,"Busy loud and cold food. Great waitress, horrible front desk hostesses.  Saw a manager wandering around but certainly not helping. It took 20 mins for my waitress to cash out our ticket.will NEVER come back."
