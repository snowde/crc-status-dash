Lynn C.,"North Richland Hills, TX",9,37,11,1.0,1/20/2015,"Horrible service. Drinks went dry, appetizers and bread took 30 minutes. Hamburger came rare instead of medium, drinks went dry again. We weren't asked if we wanted dessert.  It's a dessert restaurant!!!!"
Amanda G.,"Grand Prairie, TX",10,50,1,1.0,12/22/2014,"The worst dining experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. We were seated at our table and waited 15 minutes to have our drink order taken. The person who was our waitress spent 10 minutes of that 15 chit chatting with the table next to us and did not acknowledge us one time. Upon receiving our drinks, we didn't get straws or bread. Lastly, our drinks were never refilled and she never came to check on us. Our appetizer order had to be brought out by another waitress. The whole service was awful and a waste of money. I will never visit this establishment again."
Chris P.,"Fort Worth, TX",239,148,73,3.0,4/9/2015,Not a bad place to go to reconsider your life's decisions and how they led you to drive all the way in from Tulsa to be sitting in front of a 2000-calorie salad.
John R.,"Wyandanch, NY",0,2,,3.0,6/29/2015,"Good food, if you have extra hr and half to wait for dinner after you sit down, kitchen is horrible under cooked teriyaki chicken and rice. Wait staff is nice and friendly they need to do something with the people In kitchen and and hire some people who know what there doing."
Jody W.,"Arlington, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/23/2016,"Nov.22,2016 Group of 20 of us went to celebrate a birthday. Arrives around 6 only to find out we had 45 minutes to an hour wait. Finally after going back and asking we were seated at 7:30pm. Drinks took well over 15 minutes to arrive to our table and some did not receive their ice tea until after their meal came out. Another 15-20 minutes before our orders were taken, all but one meal finally came out and we began eating thinking his plate would come out soon. Took (12) minutes and asking twice where his food was before he got this messy looking plate of chicken and biscuit. One couple ordered wine which the waiter opened at the table or at least made an attempt to. We watched as his co-workers stood in the background laughing at him and never making an attempt to help him. Finally our birthday boy took the wine from him and opened it. By the time all is said and done we are still waiting to pay our bills at 10:30pm. This is not because we lolly gagged around. This is how slow the service and restaurant was. I do not blame our waiter, come to find out he had been there for only (2) weeks. He waited our table single handed while his co-workers watched, never making an attempt to help him with refilling our drinks, pick up the dirty dishes or even pick up the menus. I cannot believe management was so blind they could not see how hard this young man was struggling at our table and how long we had been there. And for the rest of the staff that displayed this behavior, shame on you all. I have had better service at McDonalds. The top of the evening is when we ordered cheesecake of course and they don't have original or fresh strawberry cheesecake. WTH this is a cheesecake factory, you are obviously having a busy evening, we are a crowd of 20 you know the odds of someone going to order original cheesecake is high and you come out and tell us it is frozen. Food on a scale of 1-10 was a 3, service was appalling to say the least. It was pointed out to the manager who just said how sorry she was but made no attempt to make anything right. Needless to say I do not recommend this place nor would I ever go back."
Stephen F.,"Fort Worth, TX",18,8,,1.0,3/8/2015,"March 6 was my birthday and i had called 2 weeks prior to the date calling to reserve a table. The woman on the phone said they ""Do Not"" take reservations unless you have a party of 20 and over. I had a party of 22 and when i arrived on March 6, the hostess' said we do not ""Ever"" take reservations. So having to be upset already, i just asked for a table for 22 and the manager came up and said it was a first come first serve basis depending on how much of your party was there. The manager had told me there were 2 parties ahead of me with a total of 20 people each so the wait would be 3 hours. But i told the manager that i was only missing 4 people of my party while the other 2 large parties only had 4 people in general. So at this point i was already angry due to the fact i was not able to have a table, have been lied to about reservations, and first come first serve with how many of your guests are there did not take effect. So the manager suggested to split my party into 6 tables around the whole restaurant not near each other and have me walk around the whole night. I had taken the idea and seated my guests. As the night went on i went table to table visiting my guests, my friends had told the waiters that it was my birthday but no birthday cheesecake or singing happened. All the other 5 birthday celebrants at other tables in the restaurant got that but i did not. Within one hour of our seating i glanced at the table of 20 that the manager said would be full, the table was empty because the one person ahead of me, party was not there yet. Once all my tables were done, leaving the restaurant i talked to the manager and he just apologized and the hostess' at the front just glared at me. My experience that night was an absolute disaster, having them to suggest i go somewhere else downtown was even worse. I picked Cheesecake Factory for the reason that i go there at least once every 2-3 weeks with great food. Horrible Customer Service. If i was able to rate this with no stars i would. The hostess' at the front are just absolutely rude and faces with ignorance.Ruined my birthday."
Joe C.,"Kyle, TX",3,31,16,1.0,12/21/2014,Came in for one slice... was told five minute wait and it was 30 mins by the time I got my slice. Worse time ever!!!!!
Spencer D.,"Arlington, TX",0,1,7,2.0,8/23/2015,Well.....the bread on the Factory Burger was so over toasted that is was inedible.... So save your $15.....go to Whataburger.... They need to stick to cheesecake.
Michael B.,"Northbrook, IL",0,17,2,2.0,5/16/2015,"Veggies were mush, salmon tasted like it was heated up out of a frozen bag.  Pizza had about 2lbs of cheese on it and was not eatable.  Panda express has orange chicken so so much better.  Manager took off pizza but we were very disappointed and will not return.  Have eaten at alot of cheese cake factories and never had this bad of experience.  The reviews on yelp were right but b/c we have always had great experiences at other cheese cakes we decided to go anyway.  Don't waste ur time and money at this location, way too many other good choices in DT Fort Worth to choose from..."
Stephanie S.,"Bedford, TX",0,3,5,1.0,6/21/2015,"Skinny shrimp tacos.. 2 TINY shrimp on each taco for $14. Long wait for table, nobody's food came out at the same time. Big big miss for this location. Play it safe & go to Southlake."
Debbie A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,9,,2.0,9/30/2015,"We arrived early for dinner, the place was pretty empty, after being seated for almost 20 minutes, we had to get up and ask if anyone was going to wait on us, then when the food arrived, it was bad.....not spoiled bad, but no flavor, just bad. I had salmon and broccoli, it was cold and no flavor and salmon was raw in the middle, my husband had chicken enchiladas that were slimily, not sure what was in them but never the less , the meal was horrible. will not go back."
Tonya R.,"Arlington, TX",2,21,5,2.0,5/30/2015,"Eaten brunch here a couple of times and have never been impressed at any cheese cake factory.  Got the breakfast omlett and it was cold. But the cheese cake is to die for. Maybe they need to stick with what they do best, cheesecake. Or not such a big menu choice and focus on a couple of dishes and make them really good instead of mediocre. The only reason people go there is for status. I have had better food cheaper but I will pay the $8 for the cheesecake."
Jason S.,"Fort Worth, TX",213,29,21,1.0,4/10/2016,"First I want to start off by stating I love the Cheesecake Factory. However if you're in the mood for the Cheesecake Factory I would highly suggest a different location like the Arlington location. We came here for my sisters birthday and the experience had its high and lows. The greeter that assigned seating was friendly and energetic. That was a positive. However the Hostess that seated us appeared upset and didn't want to be there, she never turned to look at us or even say a word to us. Showed us to our table didn't say anything and walked away with a grim look on her face. We had a table of 9 and had a waitress and waiter. The female was a bit older and at times seemed distraught and upset, while the younger waiter seemed unfocused and bored. When he asked if we were ready to order a drink our entire party had not even say down yet. And when I told him we were ready he seemed annoyed. He came back two minutes later and asked again when I asked him what was the ""special"" lemonade. He said it was a kind of strawberry raspberry lemonade. I said yeah sure I'll get that, when he angrily looked at me and said loudly strawberry or raspberry!? I said oh I thought you said it was a strawberry raspberry lemonade as in both were in the flavor. He just blankly starred at me and I told him strawberry. The most upsetting part of the whole experience was trying to flag down a waiter, host, or waitress to tell them it was my sisters birthday in secret so she would be surprised. First I tried the first hostess that never said anything to us that seated us, and she looked at me and rolled her eyes. The next waitress that brought me my food was next. I told her wait one second I have something to ask you, then the another waitress asked who's four cheese pasta was this? To which I said it was mine, and by the time I turned back to the waitress next to me she was gone. The birthday song they sang a couple of them started off que which made it awkward then only about three of the seven or so waiters/waitress sang while two were laughing at each other. The food was delicious as usual, the drinks I had were also delicious. The bartenders were the same ones that's I remember from when I came on Valentine's Day and they were awesome as well. They changed the channel on the bar TVs to show the Spurs and Warriors game without any issue."
Elizabeth G.,"Brentwood, TN",0,4,,1.0,4/1/2016,"I was there last night for a birthday dinner and was so disappointed in the management (waitress was actually great!). It was a big party (about 15 of us total), which I realize is a lot, especially finding out they don't take reservations. Just to be safe though, I called about 4 hours ahead of time to give them a heads up that I would have a big party coming in. When calling, they flat out told me ""we don't take reservations"". I was also put through to the manager to talk to him. He was so incredibly rude and almost sounded as if he would rather not have such a large party coming in. Excuse me sir, it will be a large group of people, most likely spending at least over $200 and you don't want our business? Classy. I think the cherry on top of it all was the rude hostesses. We came in at 7:00, like I said when I called earlier, and when telling them I had 15 people in my party they just looked at me shocked and said ""wow, that's a lot of people."" Well, I called about 4 hours ago, but apparently you all didn't care. They told me to wait to the side and the manager would come out to talk to me. Manager came out and turned his back to me while talking to the hostesses and proceeded to walk away. Said absolutely nothing to me. They told me the wait would be about an hour to an hour and a half. I understand the long wait was not the hostesses fault AT ALL, but they could have at least been nice. They stood there while waited (over an hour wait), just staring at us and obviously gossiping with other employees. So rude. Overall, such an awful experience, aside from the incredible food and great waitress, but can not get over how awful the management was. They need to have an actual plan for when larger groups come in. Other than their signature phrase ""we don't take reservations"". Will not be going back anytime soon. Should have picked a different place that was much more accommodating to a large group."
Hina D.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,25,,3.0,12/25/2014,"We came here and in spite  of the crowded  atmosphere we got seated in 30 to 40 min. The wait staff was great. But the food was not, the cajun chicken bites were so bland that any other places have more seasoning in them. Naming this dish cajun is a serious joke.  I nicely told the fellow who brought our food and he explained in the nicest way that this is how it is. I think they were busy do he could not make any effort to fix it, i seriously thought they forgot to add any seasoning to  the batter at all hence the bland taste.  I mostly will not go there and not order that entree ever. Totally disappointed in Cheesecake factory and the food we ordered last night."
Emily R.,"Bossier City, LA",0,2,2,4.0,12/21/2014,"Fast. Friendly. Farfalle chicken pasta was great, chicken had no flavor but the pasta and sauce was delicious! Cajun jambalaya pasta was good according to my boyfriend. Tons of onions and peppers. Would like to come back for some cheesecake!"
Nathan K.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,4,5.0,12/12/2014,Food is WOW! The service was awesome! Definitely going to be a regular date night for us!
Kara P.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,19,7,5.0,3/31/2015,"Great for the price. Huge portions of delicious food and epic cheesecake. Our server, Patrick, was amazing. He was very attentive with out being overbearing and didn't mind chatting with us for a few minutes after dinner even though his shift was over. Ask for him, shepherds pie, and s'mores cheesecake and you will undoubtedly have a fantastic dinner."
K O.,"Weatherford, TX",0,9,,1.0,6/6/2016,Went to Cheesecake Factory June 4th about 945pm ask for table for 10. The hostess politely said it would take approximately 45 min. We agreed that was ok. At 1045  we asked to hostess how much longer. She said they had two tables waiting to be cleaned off. Then they could seat us. One of the tables she metioned was  just off the bar area. We watched the bus boy pick up two plates left the rest it was like if they did not want to clear of the table. It  was very odd we watched three seperate wait staff  start to clean off table but then walk away went on for 30 minutes before they sat us in a different area at approximately 1115. This was only the begining of some of the worst service I have ever had. When we where sat I had asked the waitress if we could get some bread and explained we had a pregnant woman in our group that is not feeling real well. She said sure I can get that for you. Then she came back to take our drink order i ask again for bread she said they where working on it. Came back with drinks still no bread. same story as we could see the kitchen area from the table. She was not working on it. When we did received the food it was not good but wouldn't say terrible better off going to olive garden. When we did receive our food we where missing a bowl of potatoe soup the waitress said she would be right back with it. Next thing we know know the waitress is sitting in a both talking with someone else extremely unprofessional. finally got the soup. Just a terrible experience. I would have said something to management but what took place is a result of extremely poor management.
Richie P.,"Fort Worth, TX",14,23,16,1.0,11/14/2015,"So what can I say about this place. The wait was good, quoted over an hour, but was actually 30 minutes on a Friday night. The place was clean so that's good.  The  server gave us not so good service. We ordered drinks but did not offer any appetizers. Finally had to say something just to order appetizers.  Had to tell him we were ready to order our entrees too. So we get two appetizers and he brought out an appetizer salad with the entree. That is so stupid when you don't know  how to pace the food of your patrons. I've waited tables, so I know. And the most dissapointing experience about it was that the food came out just warm, if not cold. I had the hibatchi steak. Was very good, but only warm. the mashed potatoes were cold. They brought me more which were okay. They also were on the dry side. Very dissapointing.  When i waited tables, we learned that the food has to go out ""piping hot."" Did that change sonewhere? The cheesecakes were very good, but that is expected. Anyway, I will never go back to this location. Thats okay too because they are over priced and over rated. I've had a better experience at the arlington and Southlake locations. I advise steering clear from this place if you are in downtown fort worth. Too bad i can't give them less than one star.  They should have negative middle fingers for ratings.  I would  give them 2 of those."
