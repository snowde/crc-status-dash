Shaggy C.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Not sure if anyone in upper management cares about this location? Clearly not, as evident by the other reviews. I will just keep it simple please do something about your service. Hire management that cares or at least pretends to care."
Eliana M.,"Irving, TX",0,4,,1.0,5/21/2016,"Worst experience we've had at Cheesecake by far. We arrived almost 2 hours before our play started at Bass Hall literally across the street. We were quoted a 20 minute wait, but ended up waiting 40 minutes to be seated. When finally sat, we had to ask our waiter to bring us water. She forgot straws too, so we asked for those and when she brought it she handed it to me with her bare hand, instead of wrapped around in a napkin or something. 5 tables around us had received their food before us so when we inquired about where it was, our waiter informed us it had been ""burned"" and they were having to start over. By this point it's time for us to head over to the Bass Hall, since we had been there for almost two hours and no sign of food. Our server offered to bring us the check for our two cocktails, so we left without eating and paying full price for two overpriced drinks. Having worked at Pappadeaux in the past, this experience was unacceptable. There are certain things out of a restaurant's control, such as being overly busy, but the way they handled the situation was not right. Looks like this restaurant has a lot to learn about customer service. Very disappointed and will not be returning."
R R.,"Arlington, TX",0,9,,5.0,12/14/2015,"The best service ever! My family and I went there tonight and we ended having the best waitress. Initially I wasn't happy with my veggie burger, I wasn't going to send it back but the waitress insisted I get something else. The manager came over and made sure I got the best vegan salad. We are very pleased with this location and will be back!"
Pamela T.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,,2.0,10/11/2015,"Not so happy with the service here. Maybe we came at a busy day. The wait for the table was an hour. Another hour wait for our orders to come. My 2 kids were getting very hungry. The server didn't offer us bread after we finished our appetizer. It was when my kids really complained they were hungry that I had to ask her if we can get some bread before our orders came. It was frustrating that the guests at a table next to us just came in and they got fresh bread and drinks right away. Finally after ages our food came. It was really good,unfortunately we just noticed after my husband finished half of his plate that his  steak didn't have sauce on it and mine had one. We ordered the combo steak and chicken for me and he had the steak and salmon. So we told the server after that the sauce never got on his plate. Nothing was done to keep customer happy...; ( we don't usually complain but this was not the typical cheesecake factory service we usually get. We're new at fort Worth.  We moved from houston. So far other restaurants have been fine. But this one is not one of them. The server always dealt with us in a hurried way while she took time to serve other tables. Point is treat everyone the same and keep customer happy and satisfied..."
Guy D.,"Arlington, TX",0,5,,1.0,12/10/2014,Reservations were not honored and hostess staff were rude and condescending. Never again. There are too many good restaurants in Fort Worth to accept this.
Dr J.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2,3,1,1.0,3/8/2015,"The bar tender is rude when the traffic in the place gets heavy. One employee gave me the green light to walk to the server station to order and the bar tender, who looked over worked, just pushed me back into the crowd. I had stood there 20 minutes before that waiting to be recognized before I was told I could walk around everyone. What a joke. They are NOT organized at the bar at all."
Bubba H.,"Weatherford, TX",3,43,27,4.0,2/17/2015,free parking in the parking garage next door which was great. had about an hour wait but that was expected on valentines weekend.  had a few drinks at the bar which were also great. food was good.  Service could use a little tweaking but overall it was a great dining experience and a good value.  the downtown Sundance square location just added to whole experience. ill be going back
Cheryl R.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/22/2015,"I ate there a few weeks ago in the evening.  no crowd.  however, the summer shrimp roll was disgusting.  a few bites in and the cilantro and green onion were that green almost black that tells you the food is rotten.  at home, I would throw away fresh greens that are that color.  to boot, when you touched them, and the mushroom that was inside, they were kinda slimy - again telling me this food was really really NOT fresh.  I told the waiter - no one seemed concerned a bit.  gotta wonder that no one even came over and said anything.  grossed me out."
Jim S.,"Allentown, PA",0,12,6,4.0,3/9/2015,I enjoyed the food. I had the bang bang shrimp and chicken. I would be back for it again. We had to finish the meal with cheesecake. I got it to go because there is way to much food for one person.
Leo W.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,,3.0,5/5/2015,"Its a beautiful location, and the inside is very pretty and comfortable, but the service is so-so. Every time I dined there, they seem to be overly busy, and it took a long time to receive drinks, and food. The food is good, but not mind-blowing. The prices are moderate, and the menu is very extensive. Bottom line: its a nice place, but it wouldnt be my first choice when it comes to dining. If you do decide to go there, try to avoid brunch and weekend nights: its too crowded, and hectic."
Shadi D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,14,,3.0,1/24/2015,Ate there with my family when visiting. Service was slow and food wasn't as hot as it should have been coming to table. But server was professional and did his best to accommodate. The food is a bit rich and even though they have low calorie it still is too much for my taste. Great for gathering friends and family.
Marybelv V.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/18/2015,"Bad service, bad food, long wait. THIS PLACE, IS NOT MADE FOR LARGE GROUPS!! U can't reserve. It's so small u have no where to sit and wait. The waitress is not familiar with the menu. My food, not worth my 20. My cheesecake  was great untill a pull a piece of paper out my mouth.  Our tab was $80 for two adults.  Do not recommend.  Was there last night. 1-17-15"
