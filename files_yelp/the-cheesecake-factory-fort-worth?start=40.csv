Gordon N M.,"Harbor City, CA",90,4,,5.0,8/3/2017,"We had excellent waitress name Mandy. She was fairly new, and she gave us great service . She went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of. We only hope that there are more workers like Mandy. Thank you again Mandy for excellent service."
Michele C.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2017,This has always been one of my favorite restaurants . It was my daughters College graduation and we had family in from out of town . We arrived at 6:45pm and were not seated till 7:47pm. The food did not make it to the table till 9:00pm and then my oldest daughter had to return her plate due to the chicken being so dry you couldn't swallow it . The manger Vanessa Marquez gave me Corporates Phone number as I requested but no apologies nor any interest about having to send a dish back . I manage a business myself and if I was faced with  An unhappy customer in such a way and handled it  As this situation has been I would no longer have a job. I am sad to say I will not return to this establishment again . Ridiculous service for the cost !!!!!!
Sabine F.,"Cibolo, TX",89,428,1265,4.0,8/15/2016,Great atmosphere and fast service.Very busy place.They offer a few healthy choices and have a large selection of dishes.
Laura C.,"Fort Worth, TX",35,1,,1.0,11/19/2017,"This is our 2nd year to come during the parade. Last year was a terrible experience. Our waiter messed our order up twice and we were late to the parade. Against my better judgement, my husband wanted to give them a second chance. We arrived at 3:30 and was told wait time would be 20 min. We weren't seated, my husband checked on out status and was told it would be 15 min. At 4:30, my husband found the manager and we were finally seated at 4:52. We watched people get seated that came way after us. The lack of aptitude to be organized is beyond ability there. They need systems in place to help the flow of business. If you know it is going to be busy, then have enough on staff to handle it, or start taking reservations. Incredibly disappointed and will not be back. For the 2nd year in a row we will be late to our seats at the parade."
Deidra D.,"Romeoville, IL",1,17,10,5.0,9/23/2017,Omg. Cheesecake Factory has to be one of my fave restaurants to go to now. I don't think I've ever seen a menu and thought that I wanted to eat everything off of it lol. The passion fruit mojito was fresh and yummy. Mac and cheese balls with red sauce is divine. The bread at the table was beyond good. My party and I was so stuffed that we took our dishes home. I have to be back to the Cheesecake Factory!! Will leave room for dessert next time though. I am a huge fan of cheesecake. Had to put my coat on leaving because I looked like I was expecting. Lol. Love love love this place. Service was bomb and the atmosphere was really nice too
Ali G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",317,552,114,2.0,6/7/2016,"I don't get. I really don't. The cheesecake here is on point (it's in name...I mean, come on), but everything else is just okay. With a menu as ginormous as they have, the phrase ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" comes to mind. The food is okay, but it's insanely pricey for what you get and the cheesecake is where it's at anyway. Just come here for dessert. Also, when we walked up, I counted at least 10 open tables outside. We were quoted 45 minutes for a table of 2, even though I offered to sit outside. We were then called within 10 minutes. Get your crap together."
Larry L.,"Jackson, MI",23,80,,5.0,2/26/2017,"What a difference a waitperson makes!  Before a Bass Hall musical last week we came to The Cheesecake Factory and our waitperson was a delight, got us water, bread, a salad and bread and was helpful selecting our main dish, all in perfect time  so we would be finished for the program.  The bread and food was wonderful and her suggestions for desert were great. It was such a fine experience that our granddaughter wanted to have us go back with her. The Cheesecake Factory is a great place and it is uniquely fun.  Great location, too. Love the place!"
J.W. D.,"Burleson, TX",0,5,,2.0,8/16/2017,Disappointed in the service. It took 45 minutes to get a burger and a sandwich not leaving time to get cheesecake which was the main reason I came. The waiter was inattentive and just didn't have a clue. I do not think I'll be back anytime soon.
Halee M.,"Haltom City, TX",62,7,1,4.0,2/5/2017,The service was awesome... The food was awesome..  the womens restroom was something less to be desired... Trash all over the floor...  We did arrive at the restaurant at 11 on a Sat night but seems like someone would have checked it...  I order the tempora fish tacos which were excellent as well as the black beans that came with the dish...  It usually comes with rice but I don't eat rice so I had them leave it off.  Husband has the Kobe burger which was phenomenal... My daughter ordered the mahgarita pizza was disappointed in the sauce as it tasted like spaghettio sauce..   my other daughter order the cashew chicken with brown rice and really enjoyed it...  We all had left overs because the serving sizes were large...
Aubrey R.,"Fort Worth, TX",206,42,35,1.0,10/23/2016,"Started with us being sat after a 10 minute wait, which is no big deal. Then after we were sat, it took 10 minutes for anyone to come and get a drink order. I got a beer, and my husband got a coffee. When the waiter (Cedric) returned with the drinks, he told me he thought my beer was disgusting. Maybe he was trying to make small talk? Idk. But that was rude in my opinion. Then I ordered salmon for lunch, I asked for it to be cooked rare. He (Cedric) said, ""ok I'll tell them you want it not too well-done"". I said, ""no, please tell them rare, not medium rare or anything else, rare."" He he said ""ok, I understand. Like tuna tartare."" And then I said ""yes, exactly"". Then, our meals came out before our appetizer. The one highlight of the experience I that the manager, that delivered the appetizer said ""oh, I'm sorry this didn't come out first. I'll take that off your bill."" Anyways, I cut into my salmon, and it's dry and burnt and overcooked. The mashed potatoes it came with were cold. And so was the broccoli. I didn't touch the meal at all. When the waiter saw this, he said, ""how's the salmon cooked?"" I said ""way too overdone for me."" Then he said ""sorry. I told them to make it medium rare.""  I didn't ask for medium rare. I asked for rare and I was given well done/burnt. No offer to make things better, even though I verbally told him it wasn't what I wanted. Will never go back to this location. I usually go to the one in Dallas by north park, where they cook the salmon rare, and don't insult my taste in beers."
Chris D.,"Arlington, TX",0,13,,2.0,8/1/2017,"We arrived and were seated fairly quick which was nice considering the volume of people they get. The food was delicious but we had an issue with our waiter. We saw him a total of 4 times. Had to get the person who brought out the food to fill up our drinks and bring out more bread. Not a bad experience until weeks later and found out the waiter ""accidentally"" tipped himslef extra. Problem was fixed and we received a gift card for our troubles; however, all in all it wasn't a great experience. If you can, I recommend the Arlington location a few minutes away."
Lyssa F.,"Cleburne, TX",10,47,2,2.0,5/21/2017,Slow service in the bar even when there are servers sitting/standing around cuz it's before the rush. I sat there for several minutes before getting asked my drink order. My order was messed up even though I pointed it out to the waiter.
Jessica D.,"Fort Worth, TX",115,176,386,5.0,5/14/2017,"We came here on Mothers Day.  There was a wait for a table, but we were about to snag a seat at the bar.  Service was good, the menu was super extensive, and the food was delicious.  They also do free valet parking.  Only complaint was that it was super cold in there, but great experience."
Tony B.,"Fort Worth, TX",124,77,792,4.0,2/6/2016,"It was our first time eating here, I don't know why we waited so long to finally do it. The atmosphere was great, the waitress Emily was very friendly. My wife ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the chicken pasta with scampi sauce. My dish was absolutely perfect and light my wife's dish was kinds heavy for her, so I let her have mine, well.. I kinda eat both, lol. Tiramisu was awesome!"
Marcus W.,"Queen Creek, AZ",339,444,37,4.0,2/18/2016,"I don't know about you but my family comes to the Cheesecake Factory for one thing and one thing only- the cheesecake! Am I right? Our party of 3 stepped into a busy restaurant around 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away. It was busy, so we anticipated this to be a longer experience and we were spot on. While the service wasn't ""bad"" per se, it was extremely slow and no drink refills were given (bummer). My wife ordered a chicken avocado club sandwich that she really liked. She had ordered the sweet potato fries and they brought out the original fries (bummer #2). She enjoyed the sandwich but skipped the fries. Our little one decided on the mac 'n cheese and really liked it. The kids menu is pretty decent, about 8 entree options to choose from with a drink and side. I ordered the BBQ burger and it was freaking awesome. I finished every last bite.  When the time came to order cheesecake, we poured over the longer-than-ever menu and finally landed on the turtle caramel. We were so full from the lunch we had barely enough room to share one piece of cake (bummer #3). It was really tasty, although I wish they didn't add this giant mound of nearly-frozen chocolate cake frosting to the top. It really made the cheesecake more difficult to eat (the bottom part was softer and it was hard to get a bite of everything).  As usual there was a bit of sticker shock with the final bill- but hey, that's Cheesecake Factory. Expect to spend $60 on a lunch with no alcohol for 2 adults and a little one. The food was great though, as always, and the service was pretty slow as expected. If you know what you're getting into, this location is nice. Bathrooms were super clean midday, which shows they are regualrly wiping them down through the lunch rush."
Megan C.,"Houston, TX",64,149,417,1.0,4/17/2017,"This experience has forever changed my view of the CF. came in at 3:50pm on a Monday afternoon. The place was dead. Perfect- customer service should be on point since there are not many people to focus on.... WRONG. Listen I completely understand having off days and by no means was our waitress rude, just forgetful. She did apologize. We ordered the Linda's fudge cake- it was meh. A little dry. Also ordered a decaf to go along w it, but the coffee came out 15 min after the cake so after having two dry bites of cake opted to eat no more. Manager brings out coffee and it was quite frankly one of the worst coffees I've tried. Yes it was freshly brewed but just tasted bitter and like like the bunds had seeped into the coffee. Our food finally came out approx 30 min after ordered it-- a salad and a kids chicken tenders meal.  I suppose not unreasonable, but considering the time of day and number of guests, again meh. Lastly, we did. It get the usual bread basket and reminded her after our food came. The whole thing was so off putting I couldn't even enjoy my salad. Asked for a to go box and she did offer to box it up but I only wanted to put 1/2. Just bring me the freaking box I want to get out of here already! Paying $40 for lunch at a place you expect consistency is super frustrating. In the end they took off the cake and coffee so it was $25 for a salad I won't eat because the chicken was dry and the avocado was left off (yes she brought it after I waited to ask). Southlake location is much better."
Nichole C.,"Grapevine, TX",71,61,26,5.0,10/27/2016,We had the spaghetti and meatballs and a chopped salad. The food was very good. Our waiter was great
Kim S.,"Prosper, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/20/2017,Awful awful awful. Didn't care that after waiting an hour and a half we left after not being seated.  Only gave one star because I had to. Should be -10 stars.
Bre J.,"Hurst, TX",0,13,9,1.0,5/17/2017,We have been coming here for 4 years birthdays an anniversaries. I have to say the hibachi steak here is cooked very well an the scenery is nice. About 7/10 I've had GREAT experiences here.  For years they would give you a complimentary slice of cheesecake on birthdays. I asked my waitress why she charged me an she didn't even try to explain it an went straight for the manager. He comes up with attitudes right off the bat! He says the restaurant has only been open for a year which any local knows is a lie. I didn't want to argue so I just told him to take it back. The whole situation rattled me so much I left in tears on my Birthday. I'm a reasonable person you could just tell me the policy has changed you don't have ro lie to me. Despite this experince maybe after this blows over I'll give them another try.
Bill J.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,48,28,1.0,7/23/2016,"Ordered at 2pm. Food came at 2:40. Sent back white chicken chili because it was so salty, it was inedible. New dish came at 3:10, and was missing a key ingredient....  2nd order of bread came 50mins after we asked for it. The waitress kept giving us scripted lines such as, ""bread/food is almost ready y'all!"" but was mostly nowhere to be seen/avoiding the table. Even if she was busy, she probably should have gotten some help from her manager. For how much money I spent and the unpleasant experience, I'm surprised the waitress didn't compensate us in any way. Wouldn't recommend this place."
