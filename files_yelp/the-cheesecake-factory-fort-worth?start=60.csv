Alexa D.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,38,,5.0,4/29/2017,"First time here, came during lunch, with 2, 2 year olds. I was impressed at the amount of patience our server had. That's a win in my book. The food was awesome. Fried cheese and pasta carbonara, even my toddler loved it. They have a lot of options on the lunch menu. Lastly, the carrot cake cheesecake is the best thing I have ever eaten in my life  1700 calories in one slice and totally worth it!"

Crystal S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,21,17,1.0,1/22/2017,"So I thought just the Arlington location in which my husband and I waited over 20 minutes for piece of cheesecake to go & then another 15 min to find someone to pay was bad... but tried FW location this wknd and was equally disappointed.  The waitress provided the bare minimum per say.  I get not wanting to work -- just get out of customer service because it's pretty dead obvious.  The food was actually pretty good -- not the best I've had a Cheesecake Factory, but good. However, what was the major turnoff for me was payment. I gave our waitress 2 gift cards - 1 for $50 and the other had around $5 remaining on it.  I included my CC for the overage cost.  So she returns with the receipt and hands it to me. I open it and find the merchant copy that simply showed the total charges to my CC and I quickly signed and tipped. Then I looked at the other receipts which showed a more detailed break down along with a receipt that said the approx $5 gift card did not have sufficient funds. It was frustrating that she didn't mention it when she came back.  I would have liked to known what happened to the balance on the gift card.  Not cool!!!  I felt like scratching out her tip to make up what got lost on the gift card, but thought it would be just as tacky as her not telling me.  She never came back by and I didn't want to drag my friends through the time it would take to try to speak to a manager so definitely has been turnoff to have 2 negative visits in a row.  Update:  I went to website as directed by the reply -- filled out info for someone to follow up on negative experience & nothing!   It was just more of a waste of time."

Cecilia P.,"Fort Worth, TX",222,326,770,3.0,3/11/2015,"I prefer the Cheesecake Factory in southlake better. I've been to countless numbers of cheesecake factories and the one in downtown Fort Worth is new and probably the worse experience I've ever had a at a Cheesecake Factory.  Sunday night was busy, didn't expect it. Waited about 20 min. Got a couple drinks at the bar, I recommend the flying gorilla, basically like a banana chocolate milkshake with alcohol.  After we got our table. Put in an order for appetizer along with our entrees. Appetizer didn't take too long, sever said bread would be out shortly and it wasn't short, maybe like 20 min after our appetizer came out. Our entrees took even longer. All of us got our food except for 1 person who happen to be the birthday boy, the server got his order wrong, so it took another 20 min, and we had all finish our food already.  Ordered cheesecake. I got mango key lime cheesecake, probably my new favorite cheesecake there,  I was a sever before so I do understand the service industry. I'll give this place another chance soon just not on a busy night."
Piper M.,"Laveen, AZ",35,22,,5.0,2/18/2017,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan. But this one is one of the best. The service impeccable, the bartenders friendly and knowledgeable even though it was a crowded Saturday night. I didn't feel rushed and even when a order was messed up they fixed it quickly. Will definitely come back and would recommend to anyone."
Rachel M.,"Dallas, TX",85,4,1,5.0,4/21/2017,"Great wait staff, good location and good food! I love Sundance Square and this restaurant is a great addition to the area."
Sara B.,"Rockwall, TX",35,9,,1.0,3/14/2017,"I was driving through town & placed a to-go order at the bakery in advance. I had no idea that there is NO parking, & the valet that's there isn't even owned by Cheesecake Factory. The valet lady nicely let me sit there & wait (I got there before my order was done). Had to be on hold with the bakery for greater than 5 min both times I called because I thought they forgot about me. The ""25 min"" order at 4:30pm turned into more like a 45min wait. This is the 2nd Cheesecake Factory bad experience I've had....I'm thinking I'm done with this chain. But this location in particular is terrible unless you're walking to something else nearby Sundance Square"
Amber M.,"Norfolk, VA",106,2,1,1.0,4/9/2017,I ordered a grilled cheese...IK  grilled cheese. But everytime I get one it's incredible and crunchy and has the best cheese . This one was a piece of toast and cheese . But barely cooked and looked like something I would make like drunk.  So sad .
Tina P.,"Dallas, TX",86,381,9,4.0,12/30/2015,"Situated right in the heart of Sundance Square, the Cheesecake Factory delivers again! It was practically the only restaurant open late on a Monday night (they close a 11 pm) with a menu that is sure to please everyone's palette.  Same decor, same menu, same great service as all other Cheesecake Factory restaurants!"
Ryan S.,"Fort Worth, TX",25,22,,1.0,3/19/2017,Cheesecake Factory used to be one of our favorites. We won't return to this location. It's disappointing since we live close but we the service continues to be lacking and the food is not great anymore. We visited last night for the first time in awhile since we had a bad experience last time. My burger was ordered medium and came well done and over cooked. Fries weren't fresh. My wife ordered a pasta that is supposed to have vegetables on it. The amount of vegetables was laughable compared to what she has always got at other locations. The server that was delivering food was extremely unfriendly and basically threw down the food. We had to tell her that we needed shredded cheese for the pasta. It was like we were a bother. Yes the manager comped a free desert. Who cares. I told my wife I had reservations about going back due to reading so many bad reviews. They were right.
Sacknox K.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,3,,5.0,1/8/2017,I love this place the atmosphere is very peaceful and romantic.. I took my beautiful kids and wife here today for her 31st birthday and she loved it.. great place and great food!!!
Monte S.,"San Marcos, TX",1,24,2,1.0,10/9/2016,"Feel ripped off! Service was a 3 on a 10 star scale. Food was pathetic, Bang Bang Curry had 3 ea chicken & shrimp at $19.50, Shrimp pasta had 3 shrimp at $18, Calamari was good but skimpy, Mexican Cobb salad of some sort wasnt fresh. Steer clear of entrees, maybe go for their namesake?"
peggy s.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,1,1.0,1/28/2017,If I could give zero stars I would. Horrible service. Took 30 minutes to get a salad and the kitchen ran out of bread and forgot to cook some. Waiter forgot he should fill water glasses.
Tarin S.,"Houston, TX",82,11,3,2.0,3/21/2016,"We took my mother in law there for her bday, and the food was really good, but the place it self was very dirty, waking to the table I knowest the floor very dirty with crumbs and food all over the isles, but then when I was waiting for the food n drinks I saw the  busboys cleaning the tables and just throwing everything on the floor. Not professional at all, is supposed to be a 5 start restaurant n is not cheap.... you should have a least a clean place.  Very disappointed, not matter how busy you are, at least u can keep a place clean, n trust me more than enough staff."
Pancho A.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,112,550,2.0,5/15/2015,"Meh I'm not diggin this place. Food is way over priced! I asked for medium well done burger and my burger was still bleeding and there was no flavor to the meat that or little to no seasoning to the beef. The fries were ok in fact that was the best part on the plate. Now before I left I had to try some cheese cake so I ordered a vanilla bean 7"" cake at $27.99 and a ultra velvet cheese cake slice at $7.99 for just a slice. Now I'm not sure why an idiot would pay that much but I'm just a sucker for trying out new places. Not sure about others who gone to this place but when you see the massive slices that are shown at the displace table and then you look at the one you received well wow it's ummm not as big or yummy as the one that was shown at the front desk.  Honestly they are trying to pass this place as an higher upper yuppy establishment and it's really just an over priced place hidden behind a movie theatre.  Won't be coming here again Food had no flavor Way over priced items Service was slow"
Jim H.,"Mansfield, TX",86,15,,2.0,1/14/2017,"Overall experience was unimpressive. We're told an hour but waited 2, terrible estimate and knowledge of their table movement. The food was decent but certainly not worth the wait. The cheesecake tasted like it was made in a factory. There won't be a return visit"
Regina D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,19,1,3.0,6/16/2017,"If you are thinking this is a cheap place to eat it is not, we had four people and two of us only ordered appetizers, we did each order a cheesecake and it was 99.00! We got our table quickly. Food was good and very pretty in the presentation. If you are a die hard red velvet fan do not get the red velvet cheesecake it tastes nothing like red velvet cake. The icing is not even cream cheese, the whip cream was the fake can stuff with no taste, unbelievable, I was so disappointed"
Dominika P.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,3,8,3.0,4/13/2016,"Cheese Cake Factory is a very decent place if you like properly prepared American and Italian dishes and delicious cheesecakes.   Cheese cakes are beautifully exposed behind the glass counter right at the entrance and taste exactly as fabulous as they look.  My uber driver recommended me pastas and I did't feel disappointed. My noodles were exactly al-dente, the sauce nice, creamy and full of flavors! The portions (even lunch) are big but not too big to say no to the cheesecake for the dessert. I will definitely be back!  My only complaint is about the ambience. The place is to big and a little to dark inside. But obviously it was designed this way on purpose and it will not stop me from visiting to enjoy the cuisine."
Elo S.,"Richland Hills, TX",8,104,100,2.0,4/18/2016,"We were a group of two families with children and we sat in separate tables because outdoor dinning couldn't accommodate us together.  For some reason we were attended quickly with our drink orders and the other family we were with waited about 10 additional minutes before requesting a waitress because no one showed up.  It was a hot day so I ordered the beet salad appetizer and the tuna tower appetizer.  Visually the presentation for both dishes was very pleasing.  I don't see how this would be a shared appetizer as the portion was very small.  The greens were fresh and flavor wise it was satisfying .  The tuna tower was disappointing. It was also presented in an attractive manner with four wonton chips, no surprise there.  The size of the Tower was really small also, I don't see how this would've a shared appetizer either.  There was very little tuna in there and it appeared very wilted, it wasn't firm and fresh.  The top of the tower had a huge pile of sushi ginger.  Big mistake, this defeats the point of the dish as the purpose of sushi ginger is to cleanse the palate after sushi.  It's like eating a steak with toothpaste.  Anywho--- I ate it. What I was hot and hungry.  Husband had soup and toast we did not share but for some reason we were really sick to our stomach when we left this place, therefore we will never eat at another Cheesecake Factory unless it's something we have to attend such as a family event we get invited to- crossing my fingers that nebver happens.   As far as service goes, our waitress was friendly but only checked on us when the order arrived and did not come back until it was time to pay up.  We did hear another staff member was complaining about the amount of babies in there and I'm sure the manager heard her, he was right next to her.  BTW manager man, it wouldn't hurt to pretend to like your job, you looked pissed off the entire time."
