Amber H.,"Haltom City, TX",2,14,1,2.0,2/28/2016,We were told our wait would be a maximum of 30 minutes and we were seated over an hour later after they had sat people who came in way after us. We ordered immediately and waited over 45 minutes for our food.  When we finally got our food we asked for to go boxes because we were already late for our plans and just decided to eat it later.  We got home and both of our food was overdone. My husband's burger was black and my chicken was dry. As we were leaving I decided to get a slice of cheesecake to go. Somehow the ticket got lost for my order and it took almost 15 minutes for them to even acknowledge it. Will not be back at this location. Over $50 for 2 people to eat overcooked food. Absolutely terrible.
Jillian J.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,26,87,2.0,2/25/2016,"Two stars for the cheesecake. This location needs a lot of improvements. For starters, I tried to phone in a to go order, but was placed on hold.  After 6 minutes I hung up that should been a clue to me to go somewhere else. Since I was on 7th Street, I decided to drive on over there.  Once I  go there the hostess directed me to the cheesecake counter to order.  It took one of the ladies behind the counter a couple of minutes to acknowledge me. I placed my order with a side of cheesecake (couldn't resist). After I arrived home I noticed the plastic containers of dipping sauces didn't have their lids on all the way. The one that contained soy sauce had completely melted causing its contents to run all over the food. Yes, my once crunchy egg rolls were soggy after resting in a pool of soy sauce. I wish I had remembered to take a picture. To make matters worse, I started eating the noodles, and happen to bite down on some that were uncooked. (Sad) Next time I crave cheesecake I'll be heading to Arlington, Southlake, or Dallas. Those locations take pride in their work.  Hopefully my salted caramel cheesecake taste divine."
Alex M.,"Fort Worth, TX",15,6,14,5.0,2/9/2016,Great experience. ... great service.... excellent food.... great place for lunch and dinner.... we will return.... try the Bang Bang it's great
Brian J.,"Fort Worth, TX",185,473,344,5.0,12/27/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is a solid addition to the downtown dining scene.  Yes it's a chain, but they have an immense menu, with a variety of tasty dishes.  They were well staffed on our visit.  We were seated immediately at 9:40pm, but they are packed.   Food was out within 15min of placing order.  They were friendly and accommodating in regards to our sons food allergy (nuts).    With any new spot there will be hiccups but I think with their late hours this will be a great post movie or bass hall dining spot."
Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",556,124,154,5.0,12/4/2014,"We had the special opportunity to take part in the training night and WOW! Amazing selections, great food, everyone was attentive and I can't wait to come back. To start, we ordered the fried Mac &  cheese and this was not only a hit at our table, but at our neighbors as well (we shared). These delicious fried balls are so good you'll want the recipe.  BF got Revolver, I had a Moscato and it was very good. Our friend had the blueberry Mojito which she LOVED.  I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and I have to say it was great. And HUGE. Had to take the other half home. My BF loved his steak so much and said he hasn't had anything this good in a long time.  Out cheesecake was, as expected, amazing. I usually don't go for cheesecake but it was great and also ginormous!  Overall, service was great and so was the food. This was a great experience."
Stan M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,6,4.0,12/15/2014,"Called ahead, but they do not take over the phone reservations. So we went there at 4:15 and had a party of 7. The girl gave us a receipt that said to return at 7. Since it's new to the area I wasn't upset. Walked over to Sundance Square and took pictures with our group around the Christmas decorations. About 40 minutes after placing our reservation we were notified our table was ready so I was very pleased. Got seated in a big circular booth that made it feel private, which we liked. the waitres Pmins was good, except when she dropped a drink on the table and in the end she also messed up our receipt 3 times, but not a big deal. Although the restaurant appeared at maximum capacity, the food came out at a good pace. Everything was delicious. Only complaint was the martinis were pricey for their size. $10 each is a bit much I think."
Patty M.,"Fort Worth, TX",86,22,10,5.0,10/29/2016,"We visited this Cheesecake Factory for the very first time and can I tell you we were not disappointed.  The skinnylicious menu had great choices as well as our waiter was helpful with his menu favorite.  Thank you for the great service (managers walking around checking on our food, at every table!)   We will be back!"
Amber N.,"Fort Worth, TX",108,90,90,2.0,12/21/2015,"I don't really like this location. Don't get me wrong the food was good but I definitely felt like everything was delivered slow. The service was slow because my waiter was also waiting on a huge group and that's okay, it's just that if your going to focus on that don't try and wait my table as well. He brought us drinks and came back twenty minutes later to ask us about appetizers and food. The appetizer came out thirty minutes later and can you guess how long it took for food? He didn't ask us how we were or anything and when I discovered my food was burned I just asked for it to go because we were going to be late for our movie, it's crazy because we literally got there 2.5 hours before it started! In the end we had to ask another wait for our check and then we got out of there. Definitely just go to the Cheesecake Factory in Arlington, this one is nice but I'm disappointed by the staff."
Norma P.,"Burleson, TX",15,172,334,4.0,8/7/2016,"Our server Aurora was great!! She was attentive but not hovering. We arrived about 6:15 meeting at 7:00 for dinner. There was no waited so hubby was seated at 6:30. I got there at 6:45. Our dinner mates did not arrive until 7:30. Poor aurora we took up her table until 9:00! She never rushed us and brought many baskets of hot fresh bread. Refilled out drinks promptly. The food was really good. Friends had chicken Madeira and fish and chips. So much food. We had the Reece's peanut butter cheese cake and this was the only one I have had this far that was too rich. Our friends had then Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake which is one of our favorite, 2nd only to the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. The only negative was that our meal came out and our appetizers about 5 minutes after we were eating our meals. We had cancelled them when our food was brought to our table but they were brought out and we sent them back."
Cheryl M.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,20,,3.0,4/24/2017,"We have eaten brunch there numerous times and my husband always gets eggs benedict.  Usually they are awesome but yesterday they were not good at all. The hollandaise sauce was basically melted butter. Another person in our party had the waffle and chicken with hollandaise sauce and said the same thing - liquid butter. Very disappointed, we had talked up the brunch so much. My husbands stomach was upset all day from the overload of butter. The waitress was wonderful and the other  food was ok. Pretty warm but certainly not piping hot. I see from the other comments people are saying the food is ok. Maybe need new management or something. The food use to be great but the last two times it's been just ok."
Robert P.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/17/2016,"My young adult Son requested to go here for his Birthday. The entire Family was disappointed. The Wife and I ordered steak medallions from the skinny menu. The presentation was poor and the dish seemed like it may have been on a heating table for a long time. My Daughter ordered a Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. Apparently a mistake on this slowed delivery of the meal. Don't know how you mess up a burger that bad. My Son ordered a salad and a pasta dish. The salad did not arrive until last and the pasta had to be re-done because of the wait. Neither the Wife nor I were impressed with the Ultimate Margaritas. The bill was very impressive for such a disappointment. My recommendation is next time go to your favorite italian restaurant chain. You know the one with bottomless salad and breadsticks? Better food, a third of the price and possibly better service."
Glenn G.,"Haltom City, TX",7,6,,5.0,1/13/2016,My wife and I came here after having a not so pleasant experience at a different restaurant. Thanks to the cheesecake factory our date night was saved! We enjoyed everything about this establishment and will continue to come here in the future. Thanks ever so much for saving our night!
Marina W.,"Palm Springs, CA",30,14,5,1.0,6/11/2016,Shit hole who doesn't respect vegetarian requests then acts like it's your fault for not eating meat! You puts shame to the chain!
Jennifer G.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,4,,5.0,3/14/2016,My husband and another couple with their 5 year old had a fantastic experience at this location. The wait was only about 15 minutes at lunch time on Sunday 3/13. We were promptly seated and was waited on by an amazing waiter named Michael D. Our party of five all enjoyed our meals and drinks. Of course we just had to get cheesecake to go!  My husband and I split an order of stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and the fish & chips for the main course. I highly recommend both. We will definitely return to this location.
Travis B.,"Frisco, TX",4,11,2,5.0,8/21/2016,"First off awesome location. Sat on the patio and got a great view of the theatre. But the real reason i give it 5 stars was our server, Cedric. Super charismatic and enjoyable. I have a 11-12 month old son and keeping him entertained in restaurants can be a challenge. But Cedric was on top of it, offering bananas and entertaining him as well. If you can request his section, i would tell you it is a must. Thank you again Cedric. I hope the corporate office reads this."
Monic B.,"Fort Worth, TX",86,48,80,5.0,9/16/2015,"Love this place.  Having a glass of water first and a glass of Chardonnay.  I'm ordering the seared tuna salad.  Thus is healthy all the way.  Can't wait to jump in to and taste it!!   Great music, waiters & waitresses.  Love the fact it's ""SUPER CLEAN""!!"
R David S.,"Dallas, TX",18,168,114,2.0,1/14/2016,Its a regular Cheesecake factory with some bad . Our servers wasn't in a good day and the food was undercooked. I'm sure it's not common so I will give a 2 starts because the godiva Cheesecake is just amazing.
Isabel L.,"Fort Worth, TX",52,5,,4.0,9/23/2016,We've been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years and have always enjoyed it. Tonight my husband's meal was room temp to cold at best. So why did we give 4 stars? We were promptly taken care of by the staff and managers. My husband's meal was made again and we were given free dessert. The fact that everyone was attentive and quick to fix things was great. We understand that slip ups happen and so we weren't really upset. It was just really nice to see such great customer service!
Joshua C.,"Port Orchard, WA",2,33,1,2.0,8/31/2015,"This is the Cheesecake Factory, most people know what that means when they decide to eat here so I'll keep this brief.  My wife and I were hungry in downtown Fort Worth and looking for something familiar as our dining experiences had been a bit disappointing during the first few days of our trip.  Cheesecake Factory is about as guaranteed an experience as you're going to get, so we decided to order to go. It was dead inside the restaurant (I've never seen a CF this dead) and we weren't greeted pleasantly after explaining we wanted our order to go.  We were told to go order at the cheesecake counter, so we did, but not after waiting for a few minutes while the employees sat around and chatted with each other about their personal lives.  Ok, that's neat.  Even while taking our order, we didn't receive the friendly service I typically associate with CF, even if it's faked. I ordered the Chicken Madiera and my wife ordered Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  After getting back to the hotel and opening our containers, I was happy to see the orders were correct but not happy about the portion size which is obviously diminished compared to what you'd get on plate if you dined in.  The food just wasn't good, cooked and presented sloppily.  I've never had a meal at CF that I didn't enjoy, but I guess there's a first time for everything.  I would eat at CF again, but not this location.  Unfriendly service + unfriendly food (to my taste buds) + overpriced."
Gregory B.,"New Orleans, LA",80,238,92,4.0,12/20/2015,"Continues to be impressive despite the huge menu that NO kitchen could do perfectly.  I've just ""rediscovered"" the one on Commerce Street (corner of Commerce and 4th) in the past month, so have been 3 times.  When I can't decide what I want to eat, I go hear cause they do have just about everything.  The Sundance Square valet in right on the corner out Cheesecake Factory door, and its free if you validate inside, so no worries about downtown parking.  Don't forget to validate though as it's $20 if you don't.  The wait can be long on weekend nights, so I almost always go during the week when we can get seated right away.  Service can be slow when the place is packed as it seems each server has 6-7 tables which can be overwhelming when there are 4-6 people at each table.  They do share duties of running food from the kitchen, so that helps.  On my last visit, we had a server-in-training, and honestly, it was fantastic.  She was very skilled and knowledgable about everything on the menu.  This time they had my soy-glazed salmon, one of my favorites,  The time before, they were out of salmon, kinda unforgivable for a place that has 3 main items for their salmon.  In any event event, this time it was superb, nice crust on outside, not too done on inside.  I had the brown rice with it which again was very well cooked.  Its a lot of food, and the staff never hesitates to bring you a box to go, which you'll need if you want to leave room for a slice of cheesecake (you should).  My daughter had the Miso salmon, which was also perfectly cooked.  She tells me the orange chicken here is as good as any place she's had it.   The cheesecake menu is extensive and they always have a seasonal flavor or two added to the menu.  Get it to share, as it's oh so rich.  Even with two people you are likely to have some to take home. Oh, and they have Diet Dr. Pepper here.  One of few large chains that consistently carries it. Overall, I love Cheesecake Factory ... extensive menu, good/great service when I've been there, excellent parking situation.  It's not the kind of place you go for an intimate conversation with your significant other (it can be noisy), but a great place with the family where everyone can find something they like."
