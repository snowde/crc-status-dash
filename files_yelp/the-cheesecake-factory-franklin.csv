Beth E.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",69,30,173,5.0,9/5/2017,"Thank you Cheesecake Factory for your delicious VEGAN options!! My husband and I went to this Cheesecake Factory in Franklin, TN, after previously eating at one in Nashville a couple of weeks ago. It is located in the Cool Springs Mall that is within walking distance of our hotel, Townsuites Marriott.  There pina coladas are amazing! They are VEGAN and served frozen. The vegan avocado toast that is shown as an appetizer could potentially be a small meal. Also, their bread that they serve with every meal in the bread basket is vegan, without butter, of course. We got the veggie burger and the Evelyn's pasta (with olive oil and not butter).We always love this, but it was especially good at this Cheesecake Factory."
Mike R.,"Nashville, TN",19,59,32,3.0,7/23/2017,"Long wait on the weekends. The one problem I have with this place is their menu. Why do you have a shit ton of entrees? Maybe find a niche and stick with that? Idk. I guess they're smarter than me since they're laughing all the way to the bank. Anyhow. Sorry for getting off track. The service was good and the food was good. Oh look, a butterfly.......whoops I did it again. Anyhow. You can't come here and not try the cheesecake. I chose the Reese's chocolate cheesecake this time. It's rich. But they all are. And after you leave this place you're not so as rich as you were an hour ago. But anyhow. Highly recommend this place for cheesecake. The rest of the food is hardly amazing, but it's decent enough. These big chains have one thing going for them and that is they're safe and recognizable. I always encourage supporting local businesses over these.  Peace out! And get the cheesecake."
Karen L.,"Franklin, TN",48,290,187,4.0,11/26/2017,Seems like a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory to me. I love how late it is open because most stuff in Cool Springs closing early in my opinion. Always have good service here and the food is overflowing and gluttonous as expected. It's not easy to eat healthy here so I say don't try! LOL a cheat meal spot for sure.
Josh R.,"Franklin, TN",0,3,1,1.0,1/8/2018,The server Nicolette M. Just gave us the word service ever in the three years we have been coming here!! Very disappointed.
Eddie S.,"Fort Myers, FL",66,215,62,3.0,12/9/2017,"I met a longtime friend at TCF when I visited Nashville. Surprisingly, they were not busy which is unusual for a Cheesecake Factory so I was a little nervous. It took a while for our server to come by the table but she was friendly so it was okay, plus it gave me and my friend time to catch up. The did not have any vegan dishes, so I had one modified; however, when they brought it out it was missing the marinara. They promptly took it back and made the correction. The meal overall was okay. Nothing special and to my surprise my Olive Garden meal the night before was better (egad!). My friend ordered fish and chips and she said it was just okay so not sure if I will be going back to this location."
Iritte S.,"Savannah, GA",53,57,51,5.0,6/20/2017,"This location is attached to a mall and was extremely packed. I overheard someone being told that it would be a 30 min wait for their group, but lucky for me there were only two in my party so we were seated within 5 min.  I had the fettuccine alfredo with broccoli and sun dried tomatoes added to it. It was finger licking good. My drink never ran dry, and our server was great. Not to mention, since it is the Cheesecake Factory, I had to get a slice- and oh boy was it delicious !!! Nice causal classy atmosphere."
T B.,"Woodbury, TN",0,1,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Extremely busy (40 min for 6) and seated in timeframe given. 40 minutes to get food, one small bread basket(two mini baguettes) along with one pat of butter and two plates (6 people).    Long wait for entree was explained by we make everything from scratch and it takes longer....in addition I ordered my burger medium well and this was adding to wait. Entrees served piecemeal...2 first, five minutes later two more, then one, then one. My burger was served medium (pink in middle) and waitress tried to explain this was Cheesecake Factory interpretation of medium well.     My burger was good though not hot. Fries very good. Server friendly but not attentive. At this price point many better options in area."
Karen B.,"Brentwood, TN",0,83,6,3.0,11/13/2017,"Had lunch at CF today. Been a couple months but they've changed the menu again. They used to have a nice lunch ""combo"" option where you could combine smaller portions of 2 entrees ie: chicken Madeira/shrimp scampi. Not any like longer. Not sure why. It was a nice option.  The pic is of our appetizer. Nashville Hot Chicken bites. Not sure why the cook decided to not put a toothpick and pickle on the 4th corner."
Lauren P.,"Thompson's Station, TN",27,1,2,1.0,6/11/2017,"I have liked CCF many times but this time they lost me as a returning customer. Were they nice about it, yes.. but if you are choosing their restaurant on a celebratory day.. you would think if they messed up the food( soup.. not even serve able... I tried to spoon out oil from my soup & it was like a oil can left over---- they forgot to take off the fat when they took it out of the fridge before serving it that day or something... or the chef did not care)  but then I told them it was my birthday.... 2 other tables were served bday desserts .. mine... the check.  ..... & that's what happens when you let a 20 y/o manager run a restaurant. You get crap."
Brittany M.,"Paducah, KY",22,21,32,5.0,8/27/2017,"We had a great time! When we got there (2 of us) there was no wait. We were seated and had 2 waiters waiting on us ;making sure we had everything we needed. The cheesecake cake is heaven, but if you eat dinner you may get the cheesecake to go."
Amelia W.,"Lawrenceburg, TN",0,3,,5.0,12/23/2017,"This was my first time going to this restaurant and it was amazing. On the way up there I looked at the menu and was shocked by the prices and how large the menu was. Then, once my boyfriend and I arrived I was entranced by how cozy and inviting it looked. It was quite packed which was a great sign. We ordered fried mushrooms for and appetizer. Then I ordered the tomato basil pasta and it was delicious. I had so much leftover. Then we had the strawberry cheesecake. It's was exquisite. A few hours later I realized my phone wasn't on me. We went back and they had it for me. They ensured it was my phone and I am extremely grateful. Will definitely come back!"
Katie W.,"Nashville, TN",83,61,84,3.0,8/4/2016,"I was unpleasantly surprised by lunch today, where since Cheesecake Factory is very good, perhaps my favorite chain restaurant.  I've been to the Cool Springs location several times, but this visit didn't do it for me. Our server was very, very friendly but the food was meh at best. The bread was on the stale side, my ahi tuna had waaaaaaaaaay more avocado than tuna and the spicy cashew chicken we had was mushy.  Maybe we just needed to stick with our usual favorites dishes, because I've always loved coming here before."
Lisa N.,"Murfreesboro, TN",54,43,74,4.0,7/4/2017,Always had a good service here. Only thing I tend to not like is the 45 min wait if you get there during dinner time but other than that you'll get seated right away. Food and cheesecake is always good. This visit I got the di Vinci pasta. It is mixed with a sauce that is similar to the Madeira sauce mixed with chicken and mushroom. Really good.
Natalie D.,"Brentwood, TN",5,22,14,5.0,9/29/2017,"I love this Cheesecake Factory! I've been to some really nice ones all over the nation, and this is among the ""best of the best!"" Waiters are always nice, and I've noticed that the managers are right on top of them always. I need here usually at least once a week and I'm in town."
Olivia M.,"Brentwood, TN",0,3,,5.0,12/6/2017,"I placed an order through DoorDash and when it was brought to me, the fries I ordered weren't there. The driver told me to call Cheesecake Factory for a refund (which didn't make sense since I paid doordash and the driver wasn't about to go and pick them up for me which was the sole purpose of his job anyway) POINT IS, I called CF anyway and the manager Justin was so nice, he offered up one of his employees to bring me my fries. I didn't want to inconvenience them in anyway because that seems ludicrous for just some fries. But he mentioned he just wants his customer to be happy and I mean, duh, I got my fries. I'm totally happy. And happy with good management. 10/10"
Tara B.,"Nashville, TN",44,63,55,3.0,3/24/2017,"Luckily, when we went here last night there was no wait. We immediately sat down and was greeted by our server. She was very sweet, friendly, and answered any questions we had. As I started looking through the menu, I began to notice that there were the calorie counts right smack dab next to the entree name/description. This literally made me want to do nothing but eat raw lettuce and sip water all night. I felt guilty ordering what I did, lemon and herb roasted chicken....1800 calories!! I couldn't believe it. I'm assuming the portion size has to do with it because it was a gigantic plate, but still. My feeling of being gluttonous started rising and I went for it regardless of counting calories. Everything was just OK, chicken and veggies.  We did also order the crab cake bites from their shared plate menu. It was actually really delicious! If I come back, I will probably just stick to that menu."
Branch A.,"Spring Hill, TN",76,23,17,5.0,2/18/2017,"Amazing experience and this our 5th experience  and it has always been great. But this time it was especially awesome because of the people that work here. Manager Brian, employee Brandi, and server Chris.  Was there a wait ... yes.  Get over it people, and it was more expensive than McDonald's too. If my wife and I wanted fast and cheap we would have went somewhere else.  Quality food, quality service, great environment... Great desert too!"
Jesse Q.,"Antioch, TN",104,262,431,5.0,1/18/2017,I just love cheesecake factory the staff are always friendly and welcome today I just came in while traffic dies down had the crab cakes bites it also came with 2 types of bread and was warm and delightful the cheesecake is awesome as well
Avery G.,"Hermitage, Hermitage, TN",0,14,,5.0,8/7/2017,"We went late on a Saturday night and sat on the patio! Our server, Robin, was friendly and answered the (many) questions and (many) recommendations I asked for! Food was delicious and the Nutella cheesecake was seriously the best cheesecake I've ever had, which is saying something because cheesecake usually weirds me out. The menu is quite large however I am in the restaurant industry and I really love having so many options, especially at 10:30pm after my shift when I don't even really know what sounds good or what I'll be craving!"
Mandy B.,"Nashville, TN",205,13,2,5.0,1/5/2017,"Fantastic service!! Delicious food! From the appetizer, to salad, to dinner, and of course the cheesecake!! Great portion sizes, even for lunch!! Highly recommend!!!"
Jennifer H.,"Lewisburg, TN",19,14,,4.0,1/8/2017,"Went on a Saturday about 4pm. We waited about 45 minutes for a table for 2.  The food was delicious and we even bought a whole cheesecake to take home, yummy!  The wait for the food was pretty long and they service was just okay but the food was great!"
Malynna K.,"Nashville, TN",98,89,223,3.0,11/30/2016,"It wasn't my decision to come here. The menu is so lengthy, I almost get anxiety just looking through it. Way too many options, and how can you be great at EVERYTHING?! Cheesecake, obviously, is the specialty, but the entrees are just okay. Nothing ever to rave about. We got the Kobe beef burger and fried shrimp sandwich. It wasn't bad, but again wasn't great. The burger wasn't as juicy as I'd like. The shrimp sandwich tasted mostly of breading. Meh. We sat at the bar so there weren't any issues with service that I can recall. The food is just a little too basic for my liking."
Kristin E.,"Nashville, TN",5,74,15,5.0,5/29/2017,"I visit this location about once a month and my order is always correct. CF has a huge menu with something for everyone. And of course, their cheesecake is to die for!"
John F.,"Franklin, TN",9,11,2,5.0,2/23/2017,"Vegetarian Cauliflower Steak! It's the Porterhouse of cauliflower.  If you like garlic, this will make you happy. It's paired with a mixed veggie couscous that is as good as the pan-seared , center cut cauliflower."
Beth F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",28,56,57,3.0,9/25/2016,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory, and their menu is enormous, of course, but this visit was a bit disappointing and I'll explain why I only gave it . It wasn't the wait to be seated - that was only about 5 min. at 3:30pm!  It was our waitress.  She was basically nonexistent!  When we were seated, the restaurant was not full (I'd say about half) and it took about 10 minutes just to get drinks, after that it took another 20 just to get the bread!  The bread was fresh and hot, but geez! Our meals was what we expected from CF, but what ruined the experience was the server!  We kept wondering if she had taken a break - over and over again!  Too bad...  I could list her name off the receipt, but not in the mood to possibly have someone fired today."
Jaz D.,"Smyrna, TN",27,22,1,2.0,7/25/2016,"The food is mediocre for the prices. Also the hostess tried to sit us in the bar area with five people and a handicap person.  I asked her if we could get something else she said no this is where the next waitress needs a table. What????? So I was about to get the manger and she decided to move us. Their patio is not pet friendly which stinks and do not get the veggie burger it is horrible. They used to have a better one not sure why they changed it. Also please get some dairy free cheese cakes already, it's 2016! Update: Veggie burger is much better now!"
Charles S.,"Iowa City, IA",8,85,2,2.0,9/25/2016,"Okay Location - Okay Food - Staff Need Consistent Training I felt as though I must comment about the quality of the food at The Cheesecake Factory and how not only the quality of the ingredients, but also the inconsistencies as the result of an inadequate staff training program (or non-existence of) has contributed to the slow down and eventual pedestrian fare has begun to plague them over the past few years. It used to be a special day going to The Cheesecake Factory.  We don't have one where we live, so we would visit when near one, and at times make special trips just to go to one.  But the plague of disappointments over the past 4-5 years has begun to wear us down on this whole experience. First, there is the quality of the ingredients used in the food.  For instance, the gristle in the chicken sliders, so bad at times that you can chew, chew and chew and eventually have to spit it out as you just can't chew through it.  Then there is the chicken used in the Cajun Chicken Littles, oh my!  Yes, that chicken must have skin on it, it is never the same sized chicken (consistency) as the ones we got tonight looked like toothpicks! These types of issues will continue to make our visits to the Factory less frequent, until eventually we no longer visit."
Terri H.,"Franklin, TN",101,505,148,4.0,11/20/2015,"Flexible atmosphere! I love the comfortable atmosphere here.  You can sit at the bar and watch sports, or a romantic table for two, or a large comfortable table surrounded by friends.  The lighting and decor fit many different moods depending on your occasion.   You may as well start with an appetizer because it will take you awhile to get through the large variety of menu choices.  I was on a date with my husband so it was a romantic evening.  I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn succotash.  It was delicious and the portion was huge.  I made myself stop halfway through so I could have room for cheesecake.  After all that is the most important course for a date night.  The second half of my food went into a to go box and we ordered cheesecake.  Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake was this visit's winner.  It was amazing. The service was great.  We can't wait for our next visit!  After all there are so many dishes and cheesecakes to experience."
Kara M.,"Brentwood, TN",352,12,,5.0,5/10/2017,Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts ever! This place has so many selections. I would definitely say they have the best. The strawberry drizzle on the original is my favorite!
John S.,"Trussville, AL",34,275,141,4.0,11/20/2015,"Here with a large group of co-workers (15). We had a 40 minute wait, despite calling in advance to arrange. Server was very attentive. Drink and appetizer orders taken quickly after being seated. We had numerous appetizers for the table... Fried Macaroni and Cheese, Fried Calamari, Buffalo Blasts and Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread. Some also had Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip. My favorite was the Macaroni & Cheese and the Buffalo Blasts (recommended by server). I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Very good and just the right spice. I had to top it off with the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake, since it is the Cheesecake Factory. Is it even allowed to not order dessert? Just the right consistency and plenty large enough to share."
Debbie L.,"Thompson's Station, TN",31,10,5,2.0,3/14/2017,The service is SLOW..... food mediocre.  The one in green hills rocks compared to this!!
Blaise W.,"Owensboro, KY",33,117,112,5.0,1/8/2017,Every cheesecake factory we go to is amazing the portions are huge! the staff is usually really good. But this time we had extremely good server he was funny and very polite and patient with our indecisiveness on what we wanted to order. Here it was the Saturday after thanksgiving and he was so good to us. Wish i could think of his name but he did do us right.
Adrian P.,"Nashville, TN",226,2,,5.0,8/1/2017,Had a great experience thanks to Andrew our server. He suggested the perfect glass of white wine to go with my pasta and even made some modifications to my girlfriend's order because they were sold out of the item she originally ordered. I'll definitely return and I'm looking forward to going home and enjoying my Red Velvet Cheescake!
Rose N.,"Brentwood, TN",114,2,,5.0,1/3/2017,"So I usually don't go to places like this, but I had a great experiences! The waiter was really nice to me and my boyfriend. The waiter would recommend us to try this and that or he would tell us what is good. I can't wait to go back!"
Michelle N.,"Brentwood, TN",0,35,17,1.0,9/17/2016,"Mean to teens. My daughter and several friends attempted to make reservation and enjoy this place tonight before a Homecoming dance. 5:30 reservation. Told upon arrival it would be 6:30. When the girls attempted to speak to staff and try to get estimated times to eat at 6:45 as there was a Dance to get to, they were treated so rudely that several of them left the restaurant without dinner. They were told their table was given away over an hour after waiting for the  reservation. I'm sad that this is how kids get treated by adults running businesses. 10 families will now be telling at least 10 of their friends of this negative experience at this place. Nothing sweet about The Cheesecake Factory tonight."
Maria K.,"Nashville, TN",127,187,82,4.0,1/2/2016,"Update: in my original review I visited this location during lunch. I have come back three times since then in the evening and had a much better experience. Still not as good as green hills, but my past three meals have been delicious!"
Doug G.,"Franklin, TN",13,22,7,5.0,9/7/2015,"A family favorite, today we added another fan. Our visiting German exchange student. Of all the restaurants she has tried this is the best.  Huge portions. Every dish a winner.  Personal dessert fav Rocky Road Sundae. Cheesecakes all incredible."
Jeanette C.,"Nashville, TN",2,16,11,1.0,1/2/2017,"Hmmm let's just say avoid this cheesecake factory! Upon arrival they said it was going to 40 minutes for our table. That's perfectly fine it is a rainy night and I expected it to be a little wait. We walked around the mall and did a little shopping before they texted us to let me know our table was ready. When we came to check in the hostess informed us that our table was given away to a larger party but they were working on getting our table together now. Strike one! Don't text me to tell me my table's ready and then give my table away when I check in. I asked to speak to the manager and he also informed me that they made a decision to pull the table that were going to sit at to get the table ready for a party, but they would have a booth cleaned off soon.... That should have been my clue that it was going to be a sucky experience when the manager cosigns with a silly mistake. They finally got our table pulled together for us and we had a very friendly server from what it seemed. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. (Ok we will say it was because it is a busy night) Our food finally comes out and my Chicken Farfalle was supposed to have extra Farfalle sauce on the side. No Farfalle sauce. My friend ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. Her steak Diane was supposed to be MW however it came out medium closer to medium rare. We informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and I was still waiting on my Farfalle sauce. The server informed me that she ""just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it"". Strike 2. She brought me back my Farfalle sauce and let's just say it wasn't Farfalle more like Alfredo sauce. When I told the server it was Alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that. She came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said ""this is the correct sauce the manager said it's the correct sauce"". I told her it was incorrect and I have eaten this many times. She proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce. Strike 3! I am done. I know what this sauce taste like and that was not right.  I will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in Green Hills! The Green Hills Cheesecake Factory service is always good and the food is always great. I've tried this one about 4 times and it always ends up the same. I'm angry at the service and the food is never good. I'm sitting here at the restaurant writing this review so that in itself should let you know the level of frustration I have tonight!!!"
Holly J.,"AL, AL",0,40,7,3.0,1/2/2017,Cheesecake is good always. Pasta was chewy and not all that. Wished their menu was less extensive and features more of like Copelands Cheesecake Bistro.
Joy S.,"Antioch, TN",1,11,1,2.0,6/12/2017,"I hate to write a bad review especially for Cheesecake Factory as in times past our visits have been wonderful, but this evening for my hubbies birthday it was not what I would have desired. I cannot remember the waitresses name because I didn't keep the receipt as I paid with a gift card, but she was a sweet young lady but obviously not on her game. First, we chose outside because of the wait time for a table inside at 5:30 p.m. It was hot! So we placed our drink order which took a few minutes to get, and once we got the drinks it took a bit longer before we got our bread and our order taken! Once our food arrived, the food was very good by the way but my hubbies steak was not cooked as he had requested. Being outside already hot and having hot food placed before us added to the heat our drinks were never refreshed the entire time we were there. Now I know eating outside was our decision but to not have an inquiry about drink refills whether outside or inside is a biggie for us and almost anybody. So we asked the waitress to bring a to-go box and to-go drinks as we were hot and thirsty. Took her a good while to bring the drinks which she only brought one drink when two were requested, so my hubby said forget about it. We wanted to order cheesecake to go but the wait time probably would have been forever. Because we do tip, having been a waitress before and a waiter/waitress cannot live on their paid wages, but mostly their tips, we tipped her well. Not deserving of such a good tip but that is just how we do it. Please make sure the outside waiters/waitresses keep up on drink refills. Some of us love to eat outside, but when it is hot, drinks is a NICE perk!"
