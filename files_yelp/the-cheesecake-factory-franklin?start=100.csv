Kate S.,"Brentwood, TN",0,14,1,4.0,6/4/2015,"This place is really great! The menu is very long and confusing though. I love the veggie burger there. I also love the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries. The service is great. The only thing I don't like is the long menu. Overall, it's a great place to eat."
Gail R.,"Franklin, TN",0,4,,2.0,4/5/2015,Have had good experiences at lunch but last night not so good.  Service very slow.  Orders wrong and manager not cooperative.  We will never go back at night.  Very bad experience.
Joseph S.,"Franklin, TN",0,1,,4.0,3/27/2015,Today's late lunch at 3 pm consisted of a chicken salad sandwich and sweet potato fries for me and a half turkey sandwich half salad for my wife. Drinks were a diet coke and iced tea. The food was tasty the service and courteous atmosphere as well and the ambience were awesome. My wife's turkey sandwich was a bit smaller than it was at our third visit about four weeks ago. Even for the cool springs area the meal was a bit steep for lunch at $33.00 before gratuity. I will go again though.
Susan J.,"Batavia, IL",1,155,,1.0,10/31/2015,"Ordered take out and got curb side pick up. The girl brings out food, reviews the order and I sign the credit card receipt. (Btw gave her a 20% tip for basically nothing). Get back to the hotel, sit down and start to eat. Take out our cheesecake and piece of chocolate cake we ordered. Instead I pull out 2 pieces of pumpkin cheesecake. Phone rings, and surprise it's the girl from cf. ""Hi, did you get the right cheesecake"". Me: no. Her ""can you tell me the name on the bag because now someone else might have their order wrong"" me: no, I'm sitting down trying to eat. Her: can you just drive back and we'll give you your cheesecake. Oh, and don't forget to bring back the other ones. Me: that is a huge pain, as I'm staying at a hotel and we wanted to relax. But I'll come back her: ok pull in the same spot and I'll come out right away. So I get there in 5 min and wait and wait. Then I call, explain and get out on hold. Hang up and repeat. Twice !! I was about to go in there and completely lose my s***. When finally here she comes. Her: here you go and can I have those other cheesecakes. I wonder whose they are. Okay. No apology. No discount/refund. Nothing! And like I said I left her an excellent tip! Totally unacceptable and ruined the whole meal. Threw away my dinner as it was cold and no microwave in the room. Never again."
Catherine M.,"Nashville, TN",0,1,,2.0,1/27/2015,"I tried this Cheesecake for lunch today with some girlfriends and ended up being somewhat disappointed. I've never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory, and I get that they're newly opened and experiencing the usual growing pains that come with that, but judging from mine and others' experiences, they have got to get it together. We had a very sweet and friendly waitress. She was attentive enough, it just sometimes took her a while, like 10 minutes to run our cards, even though the place was pretty slow, and I only saw her waiting on one other table. What makes me give this Cheesecake location 2 stars was my food. I ordered the pulled BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. Seems simple enough, but when the food came out, my sandwich was giant chunks of pork with BBQ sauced slopped on top. Before the waitress walked away, I told her I thought I ordered the pulled BBQ sandwich (which I've ordered at the West Towne Cheesecake before and it was ""pulled"" like it's supposed to be). She said she thought it looked wrong and she going to make sure she didn't ring up the wrong thing. She was very nice and helpful about it, but I thought she should be able to tell if it was right or not, because I'm pretty sure they don't have a chunky pork BBQ sandwich. She came back and said that they just didn't pull it and took it back to the kitchen. Another waiter brought it back a few minutes later and the kitchen just kinda chopped up the pieces into smaller ones. I let it go at that point and just ate my food. My friend's dishes were fine. I would have appreciated a manager apologizing or a 10% off or something, my food was prepared wrong and I shouldn't have to tell them that. You can't serve pulled BBQ pork in a Southern city like Nashville, where people can get amazing BBQ all over the city and serve me what you served me, and apparently not even realize or care."
