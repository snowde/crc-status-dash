James S.,"Nashville, TN",0,116,5,5.0,1/2/2015,"We love the Cheesecake Factory, and we were excited to try this new one. There was a 15 minute wait for a table, but they would text me when the table was ready, which let us go shop a little. The inside is spectacular (nothing like the one on Big Bang Theory). Service was very prompt, friendly, and attentive. Our server knew the menu, understood customer service, and had good timing except for a lapse when it was time for the check. Food was great. I ordered the shepherd's pie, expecting something safe and pleasant, but it was the best thing I've eaten in a long time. The sauce was an explosion of taste. I can't believe I'm raving about shepherd's pie, but I just did. My daughter loved the four cheese pasta. I liked the pumpernickel bread that came before the meal, though my daughter didn't think it was as soft and fresh as usual. My main complaint: When you enter the restaurant from the mall, it's utterly confusing where you're supposed to go. There's an employee work station right there, but it's not the hostess stand. It's up to you to figure out that the hostess stand is at the outside entrance, and then figure out how to get there. A sign would be nice, telling us where to go. Two lunch-size entrees, two sodas, tax, and tip totaled $40. That's a lot for lunch, but a good price for what we got."
Holly G.,"Oldsmar, FL",19,161,93,3.0,1/18/2016,"My fiance and I stopped by here for some dinner after stopping by to exchange his phone at the Apple Store. I had never been to Cheesecake Factory for real food, only for its namesake cheesecake (which is great). This place was packed on a Friday night but we only had to wait about 30 minutes before a table opened up. Not terrible. As a few people have mentioned before, it is quite loud in here so make sure you sit close to your companions or be prepared to shout. The menu is enormous. We had decided right away that we wanted the Eggroll Sampler so we ordered that and probably still needed 10-15 minutes before we decided what we were going to have to eat. But our server was really nice and gave some recommendations when it was clear that we were struggling. The Sampler was hot and cold. We loved the Avocado and Crispy Cuban varieties, were mixed on the Tex Mex, and didn't really care for the Firecracker Salmon. I opted for the Kobe Burger as my entree, and my fiance got the Americana Cheeseburger. They were both cooked to the temperature requested, and pretty decent overall. The portions are huge, so we both took home half the burgers anyway. And we, of course, had to order some cheesecake to take home. The cheesecake is always fantastic. I've had a few different flavors and they're all great. Three stars means ""A-OK"" and that's pretty much how I feel about Cheesecake Factory. There are lots of menu options, so you're pretty much guaranteed to find something you like. But it is fairly expensive. I think for our appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and 2 pieces of cheesecake added up to $100 (or around there). Quite a bit considering we weren't blown away. I'll come back, but only for the cheesecake!"
Bob B.,"Franklin, TN",0,5,,1.0,4/20/2016,"I have never, ever had a bad experience here. The food is always excellent and service nonpareil.  This was decidedly NOT the case on this visit. Our sever was as disinterested and unpleasant as any I've had in a long time. Took forever with simple requests like water.  But the food was less than ordinary tonight as well. My meal was completely bland and while I waited forever for our dismissive server to return to tell her about it, I lost my appetite. The fact that she argued with me about the amount of food I ate was as gauche as anything I've experienced in a restaurant.  I finally found a manager to complain about how the server was acting toward us the entire meal and he seemed to offer us dessert but when the bill came, my meal had come off (standard practice when someone doesn't like his meal) but we paid for the desserts.  No big deal I suppose but my expectation after talking with the manager was that he'd offer us this ""bone"" to make up for what was a beyond less-than-stellar experience. The server was almost gleeful when she told me that wasn't the case.  When I choose chain restaurants, I do so based on consistent food and service. My wretched experience tonight and poor treatment will make me pause the next time this Cheesecake Factory is suggested for a meal.  Very very disappointed."
Tam M.,"Brentwood, TN",0,33,1,2.0,8/26/2016,"Great host and extremely incredible waitress! That was the best part of our experience. We left with an $86.00 bill which would be worth it if the food was good!  Our appetizer of cheese garlic bread was good and the dipping garlic mixture it comes with is very good. It comes with a cold marinara type sauce that is too cold to compliment the bread but did have a good flavor. My husband got the. Cheese enchiladas that didn't have much taste despite the nice presentation. It was a disappointed and he only managed to eat a small portion of it. Our daughter got her usual hamburger and French fries. The fries were good but the hamburger was... Tasteless! She could only eat a tiny portion of the burger. For me, I usually like pasta or salad . I ordered the chiplote chicken pasta which was extremely bland and had a very sweet taste! Chipotle should offer a smokey flavor with some heat but failed on both counts. I am disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory for delivering such a mediocre ( at best) meal. I don't see any reason to return again. I have been going to Cheesecake Factory for years in California , Ohio and Kentucky KY and have always been satisfied but not this time. However, the waitress was superb and the woman that brought out our food was hilarious...great atmosphere!"
Alexandra F.,"Nashville, TN",27,46,74,4.0,11/17/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! This location was great. We had a party of 10 for a friend's birthday and the servers were very attentive. We had bread and appetizers, meals and of course cheesecake. Oh and some alcoholic drinks.  For my meal I ordered the jambalaya pasta with no green peppers, cause I hate them. I heard the server say it was the spiciest entree in the bible of a menu. Anyway, it was chicken and shrimp, onions, tomatoes, and pasta. My only complaint about this dish was that it wasn't spicy. I took about half of the dish home and added more cayenne and Cajun seasoning. Now that's what I'm talkin about. Also I had two gin and sodas that were well worth however much they cost. Smooth and strong just like I wanted. Everyone ordered something different so I observed some other superb looking dishes. The guy across from me got the chicken and a biscuit. It looked like mashed potatoes, a whole chicken, a HUGER THAN HUGE biscuit, and veggies. He said it was delicious and we heard the server say their chicken marinated for 12 hours. No wonder it's so tender!!  My friend got some kind of chicken avocado omelette. She said it was so good and it came with potatoes and toast. The birthday girl got the four cheese pasta and added chicken. Her dish was just as huge as mine and again, tasty chicken and obviously extremely cheesy.  From across the table I saw a girls huevos rancheros. She sent it back because the eggs weren't runny. I don't know if that's actually part of the dish, but it looked yum.  There was some kind of giant salad with a tower of crispy onions strings that I was jealous of. That's about all of the dishes I could see from where I was sitting. Our party of 10 was very quick to order and somehow we were there for 3 hours. So my only complaints are my dish was not spicy and it was a slow process dining here. Which was fine until we all got to a certain point of sleepy and way too full, then we all just wanted to go home. We waddled out happy though!"
Kelly F.,"Franklin, TN",14,125,236,3.0,12/3/2014,"We have eaten here 3 times since it opened. The service is SLOW. Both the wait staff and the kitchen need to work out their kinks.  The food is consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, which is a good thing.  The restaurant is gorgeous. I made the mistake of ordering the special which was an Asian meatball sub from the TV show ""On the Menu"".  Just like the tasters said on the show, the bread was too hard and made it impossible to eat. The meatballs tasted like basil. Italian and Asian food are not a good mix.  The flavor profile was confusing at best. The 3 rating is due to the length it takes to order and actually get the food. I will update this review if I see an improvement."
Scott G.,"Franklin, TN",6,10,2,2.0,11/12/2015,Huge plates of food does not quality make. The portions were oversized. The food quality was mediocre at best. I was expecting great cheesecake but I got the factory part. The service was very good but it didn't make up for the food. I should have gone to Friday's
Cat M.,"Franklin, TN",21,17,,5.0,6/29/2015,"This review is based on food, not atmosphere, as it's regarding TAKEOUT :) We order takeout from them ALL the time. Caesar Chicken Salad is my favorite. French fries are actually pretty good - even when lukewarm, or cold even. Yes, they are a bit expensive, BUT it's really good COMFORT food... and on those days when you just want to hold that takeout container on your lap, in bed, and watch a good movie (preferably a feel-good one) THIS is perfect for THAT!! :)"
Traci J.,"Franklin, TN",73,10,4,1.0,10/22/2015,"gross food & the worst customer service.   we ordered from a local takeout service (items that we have ordered previously and were just fine) and the fried appetizer that was delivered was liquid, uncooked batter in the center. I called to speak to someone at Cheesecake Factory and transferred to manager and she didn't care one bit.  They said ""that's weird"" and ""I'll talk to my cooks but I can't do anything about it"".  It is LIQUID. and dripped all over my hands.  The gross customer service continued and we will never dine with them again. NICE."
Troy M.,"Brentwood, TN",35,3,1,1.0,2/16/2016,"While the food is generally very good, the service and how the kitchen operates is the worst. Two out of the last visits our $30 worth of appetizers arrived and our entrees showed up at the table one minute later. I asked the managers why should I buy appetizers?  They say it's a kitchen miscommunication.  I guess it's too much to ask for service and food at the same time. I recommend that if you fine there make it a special request to get your appetizers in advance of your entree. Shouldn't be that difficult people."
Patrick B.,"Nolensville, TN",135,37,1,3.0,8/20/2015,"Of course this is a chain, and chains do what chains do. I thought the staff was friendly and the service was quick.  However, I thought for the price that the food was average. I am also a card carrying (not really) professional lover of cheesecake. I have to say that I was disappointed. I don't know if it is the location or the chain overall. I remember in Texas having some pretty stellar cheesecake from my local restaurant.  Overall... nice place, good service, ok food. Not bad, but I think we can find better."
Sarah R.,"Franklin, TN",45,15,3,1.0,1/16/2017,"Not good for a big group/celebration. Called morning of to make reservations or ask about call ahead seating for a dinner bday party of 10- even speaking to mgr they said they don't take reservations and no exceptions but to arrive early. We arrived 30 minutes earlier to get our name on the list. Quoted wait time of 1 hour. About 50 minutes went by, checked on reservations and told 1hr 15 min. When that time passed, checked again and were told the party ahead of us had eaten and paid and it would be any minute. They literally cleared out the entire lobby and outside waiting area, including parties of 6ish that just walked up and left us waiting 2 hours. I know smaller parties are easier to sit but there were plenty of places to push 2 tables together. By the time we were sat it was 2.5 hours from our arrival time and nobody else in the entire place was waiting on a table. This was after at least 5 check ins with host/manager to make sure they hadn't forgotten about us. They gave us some free appetizers and our waitress was great but they messed up the entrees of 2 in our party and they didn't get their correct meals until everyone else was already finished. If they had told us it would be 2+ hours of a wait on a Sunday night we would've gone elsewhere but because they kept telling us it would be any minute after that 1hr15min window, we just waited and waited and waited. Very poor customer service & they should really consider taking reservations for larger parties/special occasions. Hundreds of dollars spent between food/drinks & an irritated babysitter that didn't expect it to take 5 hours for us to go to dinner. We won't be back."
Brian T.,"Spring Hill, TN",0,65,2,2.0,10/18/2015,"It's a chain restaurant, you get what you expect from chain stores and that is an empty wallet and a 50/50 shot of coming away satisfied.  I've been to this location 3 times since it opened, positives and negatives come out each time but never a full on, ""I'm definitely coming back here"" moment. The menu itself is overwhelming and takes an average person a decade to reach the last page, ever wonder why this place is always jam packed? No one is sure what they want when they've read a novel of a menu. Most restaurants specialize in one or two areas but not here, you have mexican next to Italian with american holding hands with God knows what. With a menu this large always remember these items are rarely fresh made and more likely prepped, refrigerated, warmed up, topped then served. Yay for microwaved $8 soup.  After the disastrous menu combinations comes the decision of a lifetime. I've had the safe choice twice before (Club Sandwich) but this last and possibly final time I chose the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich, Potato Soup and Fries. Ok, I deeply liked the lukewarm potato soup (insert sarcasm). But honestly that was the highlight here. The Parmesan Sandwich was overwhelmingly tasteless with peppers and onions the only distinctive taste that stood out. The chicken tasteless, the sauce ruined by the peppers and onions and the cheese cold and pressed into the bread. So basically I had potato soup with fries, yay carbs. Please don't ask your server what's good or what sells the best, the response is the same all three times, ""All of it is really good"" and that narrows down the ""numbered"" pages of the menu.  My wife loves the chicken medley however she, like me is too afraid to waiver from what tastes ok to try a dish as horrid as mine. We also took home a slice of cheesecake (strawberry and pumpkin). This, was the only highlight of this epic failure. But I swear I can get almost the same quality from Wal-Mart as sad as that is to say. My only wish is that I didn't go for fast food, sad right?  But I will be back to tackle another dish, I refuse to believe there's nothing here that's edible."
Chris C.,"Brentwood, TN",11,121,8,2.0,5/6/2016,"Service, at 6:00 on a Thursday was stretched thin at a 1/2 full restaurant.  Burger was about the size of a hockey puck and tasteless.  Lettuce was the white and tasteless variety as well.  The side salad that came with it was forgotten and I had to ask them for it.  No apologies.  The balsamic dressing was certainly not homemade and had an ""industrial"" processed taste to it.  Either that or the oil they used had a rancid taste to it.  The roasted broccoli was actually outstanding.  Underwhelmed is being kind."
Lisa M.,"Franklin, TN",1,43,4,5.0,10/25/2016,"A great place to rest and relax for the happy hour 4-6! This location has a great happy hour! The Long Island iced tea is good! Not a lot of mix - just right! The happy hour menu is eclectic- in a good way! The Vietnamese spring rolls, avocado rolls, sweet corn tamales, and crispy crab wontons are delicious! Highly recommend!"
Mark W.,"Panama City Beach, FL",97,22,6,4.0,3/1/2016,"Chelsi our server was excellent. She made the meal very enjoyable.  The cajun jambalaya pasta was excellent. The only negatives were the host did not greet or even talk, simply looked at us assuming we knew to follow. The manager was not visible during visit either"
Stacie G.,"Thompson's Station, TN",7,35,28,1.0,1/24/2015,"Honestly this was the WORST meal I have ever had! I have eaten at the Green Hills location and it is wonderful, this one couldn't even make a plate of pasta right. We had a 30 min seat wait (that was expected and average) once we were sat we ordered in 10 minutes, the waiter passed us off to a waitress, we waited 50 minutes for our food (a steak med rare, one med, a plate of pasta and chicken)  Food came out cold! Med steak was well done! Chicken was rubber! Spaghetti was mixed with bow tie pasta like they used the same pot to cook different pastas in the same pot. Pasta was mush!  Cheese that was melted on top was a cold congealed blob! So the end of this story is if you go to this location block out 3 hours!  30 min wait 10-20 mins to order 50 mins to get food 30 to get the food replaced/redone  45 mins to get the bill Or just decide to walk in pick up cheesecake and leave! (Can't rate the deserts we never got there)"
Dena M.,"Ethridge, TN",22,19,13,3.0,2/11/2015,"I just walked in to the counter to order some cheesecake to go. Customer service was horrible. It took 5 minutes for someone to even acknowledge me. A girl and boy was too busy flirting with each other to wait on me. Another kept wiping her nose with her gloved hand!!! Finally, a girl took my order. She was nice enough.  The cheesecake was not as awesome as I had hoped. I've had better."
RA V.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,92,12,2.0,5/11/2016,"I've tried to like this Cheesecake, but I've found the food quality and portions here suffer compared to other Cheesecake locations.  The corn cakes - tiny. The chicken in the enchiladas - tuff, and tasted burnt.  Waits are also often REALLY long and there is no call ahead seating."
Michael M.,"Rowlett, TX",0,10,,3.0,3/21/2016,"My second visit to the Cheesecake Factory, but the first time to this location. Service was a little slower than it should have been. It's a big place, but wasn't very crowded while I was there. The appetizer was good but should have been hotter, (spinach and cheese dip). I ordered the fish and chips for my entrée . The fish was a little greasy but the flavor was ok. The Cole slaw was really good, and my wife's Asian salad was good. The only real issue was it took a long time for the food to come out and our waiter, although acceptable, was less than stellar."
