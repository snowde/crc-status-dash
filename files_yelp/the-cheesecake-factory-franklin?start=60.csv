David D.,"Columbus, OH",9,92,1,5.0,2/7/2015,My only complaint with this place is how I feel when I leave. I've been to several and they are always wonderful.  They're clean. The staff is friendly. The food is always flavorful and plentiful. I'm too full at the moment for cheesecake though.  Great news for Memphis. They have obtained a building permit and will be going into Wolf Chase Mall where Milanos currently resides. Can't wait.
Kathryn D.,"Gahanna, Columbus, OH",2,21,5,5.0,2/7/2015,"As usual another successful meal at Cheesecake. The place is clean, our waiter was great. Now I'm just waiting to continue my dining experience, even thpugh I had the lunch sized portion of the Spicy Cajun chicken Pasta, I am so full, but soon be enjoying a decadent piece of chocolate cake."
Chelsi G.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",1,14,6,5.0,3/1/2016,"I have been to this location multiple times. I have always had excellent service which is more than I can say for a lot of restaurants in the area. Along with the excellent service, the menu items are just as amazing! The menu is almost like a novel with options from delicious salads to yummy tacos to hearty pasta dishes. All in all the only item I have ever disliked was the Alfredo. It was very plain with no flavor and it was as if I was eating noodles in straight heavy cream. Other than that, the fried mac and cheese balls over marinara is one of my favorite appetizers. I've tried every salad and can't pick one as my favorite! Their happy hour has amazing specials but is only from 4-6 so it's a bit difficult to get there in time but so worth it if you can make it. Would definitely recommend this place to any and everyone!"
Mary F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",30,138,220,2.0,10/6/2015,"I feel bad writing this review for Cheesecake Factory.  It's not a good review.  I actually really like CF. She's such a big, brash, bling-y, gaudy, over the top, almost sloppy gal of a chain. A great place to relax with a drink and apps with a loving sister after some mall shopping or with my boys before a movie. Cool sounding American fare, with adult bevs.  But, this location needs help. Fast.  I hope someone at CF will read this and do better.  CF always holds such promise and once a year, I get lulled into thinking, yes, it's possible I had an anomalous visit and that it will be different this time. It hasn't been different and my little family is done with CF for at least another year. We didn't come away enraged. Just deeply disappointed. Depressingly disappointed.  Here's why: Menus are slick with grease. Please, guys, wipe them down with soda from the bar--cheap, effective restaurant stand-by side work resource. Those menus should squeak with plastic-y cleanliness.  The discombobulated, semi-insolent, poorly trained staff at the door.  They were the first sign that something is wrong. When we visited and asked to be seated on the patio, there was confusion and no guidance. A manager came over to ask if we'd been helped--his hostesses were bungling something at the host stand. He took us outside where there were at least five tables available. The patio has its own wind tunnel that affects at least two tables. The door leading to the patio doesn't always shut properly and it blasts inside air on to the patio. And I'm talking a Kansas-sized blast. We asked to be moved. It still blasted us, but less so and once I had to get up to close the door myself. This is pure blindness to customer comfort. Don't seat those tables ever again until that wind tunnel is shut down. Unforgivable.  The staff. Sitting with guests. Too cool. Too cute to remember our order and too cool to work hard. I've seen this mistake at other CFs. If CF's target demographic is tween and twenty-somethings, I understand trying to populate with Abercrombie part-timers. But that demographic doesn't have the buying power of middle aged parents and middle aged women with girlfriends, a raging sweet tooth, and a taste for vino. But looking around at the waitstaff, and seeing this at other CFs, I think I actually realized that IS their target demographic and not my ilk.  A chain as big as CF, with its ambitious and interesting, far reaching menu should do far better with its training. It doesn't and it shows. The overloaded menu isn't enough to entice us when the wait staff are partially competent and we are stressed during dinner trying to remind them of what's missing at our table and what came out wrong (yes, we experienced all of that in one visit).  LOUD. I couldn't really hear the staff inside. Holy cow. Is the music supposed to blare like that? The restaurant is cavernous to start with. So the noise makes it seem even more so. If I'm being an old fart b/c it's supposed to blast loud music, then, okay. 'Nuff said. I claim my old fartedness.  The execution. Back behind the curtain at CF's HQ I'll bet are smart chefs who are great cooks who love their recipes. The problem at this location is execution. (The one exceptional CF that I've visited is in Westlake, CA--always busy. Always booked. Exceptional execution. Every time. Exceptional (and cute) staff.). The end product here feels like it was made remotely by someone manipulating a joy stick somewhere to put dishes together here. Dishes seemed unfinished. Not as put together as they should be. Sloppily presented. Disjointed. Too much sauce. The artichoke dip was microwaved. Seriously? That's like a Gordon Ramsey-level violation. And lazy. The burgers. Meh. Fries. Meh. Even the sweet potato fries that are usually spectacular at CF were terrible. Limp. Over cooked. Soggy.  Sigh. I can't go on. This is how we felt when we left. Just disappointed. And we paid too much, so that part burns but I hate complaining during a meal--it ruins the bon homie. Just kills it and then I get mad. I don't like souring the mood for my boys b/c I'm always happy to be with them. Even over a table of crappily prepared food. So, I'll pay. I just won't go back.  My boyz now call CF The Restaurant That Will Not Be Named."
Pj H.,"Brentwood, TN",0,18,1,1.0,9/11/2016,"this location is a bust:  food bad, service bad, management poor.  This is not your father's Cheesecake Factory.  Kid's chicken tasted like chalk, like they sprayed the grill marks on?  Complained to waitress and she did not want to take iff the bill because my young daughter ate some if it.  We all had a piece to see what it tasted like, but we all spit it out.  Does that count as eating it?  Finally had to talk to manager to get that removed from bill.  Ok, I for one am not waiting an hour anymore for bad food and a rude server.  There are too many good, local joints to go here anymore..."
Kathryn D.,"Overland Park, KS",70,25,13,5.0,3/21/2015,"Amazing!  Had dinner here tonight.  Hubby had the pasta with chicken and garlic and I had the beet and arugula salad.  The flavors were amazing in both dishes.  We got cheesecake to eat at home later...mmmm... The only negative is that we had to wait to get in for an hour and a half, but we just walked around the mall.  Once we got in, our server was excellent, very prompt and our food came out super quick!!!!"
Jamie H.,"Augusta, GA",9,11,6,2.0,10/23/2015,"Probably one of the worst cheesecake factories in America. Our waitress was SUPER friendly, but only so much friendliness can accommodate for crap food."
Katrina M.,"La Vergne, TN",0,24,4,5.0,10/26/2016,"my food was not as I ordered it and the manager was quick to assist me and make it right, I appreciate that so much, and Katrina who works at the Cheesecake counter is always nice!!!!!!!"
Tiffany O.,"Franklin, TN",8,8,2,5.0,1/1/2016,"First time coming here and a beyond great experience. Yeah the wait to get a table was a bit long but that's new years eve for ya. Service was fabulous, didn't wait long for anything once we were seated. I ordered the four cheese chicken pene and it was so delicious. Had gift cards to cover it so probably won't be able to come back only due to the pricing, unless we get more gift cards."
Charlotte L.,"Antioch, TN",7,17,2,1.0,7/30/2016,"Last night was my first and last time going to this location. My friend and I sat at the bar. We joked a little with our server, she clearly didn't get the joke and things went downhill fast from there. We ordered a slice of cheesecake each. She brought over silverware and napkins but didn't lay out the napkin as had been done for others. When the bread came, we had no plates so my friend literally raised his hand to get her attention, I said excuse me right in her direction and she apparently was too busy unloading the dishwasher to notice either of us. We asked the other server instead who helped us out. Other than a brief ""everything ok"" to which I didn't respond, we had no further interaction with her. She never asked how our cheesecake was, if we needed more water or would like to order more drinks, if we'd like more bread....nothing. Payment was sitting there for almost 10 minutes until my friend asked the other server to take care of it. Our server walked past us multiple times and seemed to be avoiding eye contact, though she had no problem engaging with other people she was serving at the bar. Her top priority seemed to be unloading that dishwasher. As we walked out, no one thanked us for our business, asked how our experience was or wished us a good night. It was the worst dining experience I've ever had. And though I'm not the type to play the race card, we were the only people of color sitting at the bar and the only ones receiving that type of service from her. So either that was a factor or she just didn't like our joking around at the beginning, which was far from offensive. On the flip side, the cheesecake tasted great which accounts for the one star I'm required to give to review. However, next time I want a slice of cheesecake I'll be going to Green Hills. I'll never set foot in this place again."
Anne H.,"Nashville, TN",17,49,16,4.0,5/9/2015,Great food. Consistent. Like the atmosphere.  Like the cocktails.  Service is decent- not the best but usually adequate.
Pratiksha J.,"Nashville, TN",4,28,2,1.0,5/24/2015,We were seated at small table in the corner when half the restaurant was empty. She brought beer that was flat and never came back to check on us. Told us she would bring bread which came almost close with our food. Nice job running this restaurant
Jane H.,"Nashville, TN",6,14,6,3.0,8/29/2015,"Had a fair dinner with a group of five.  Two of five did not like their food.  The others said it was ok, but not as good as in past visits. Cheesecake was fabulous!"
Miranda B.,"Smyrna, TN",0,18,4,3.0,7/22/2016,"So I love Cheesecake Factory but this location is bad. So I called a couple days before my birthday to make a reservation. They said they only take reservations for right when they open. Why would anyone need to make a reservation for when they first open and there will hardly be anyone there as compared to later. So we worked it out so that I would come in early and get seated at the right time. I was told on the phone waits are usually 30-90 minutes so we came in like an hour early from when we wanted to eat. Waited for less than 10 mins, but I guess that's a good thing. Also I stood there for like 4 minutes just staring at the girl before she noticed me and signed my party in. We got a big booth. Great lighting. It was soooo crowded though. It was bad. We got an app of fries that were really good. The servers were all young and half seemed new. Our waitresses were nice though. We had two because they changed shifts halfway through... Our food was good. I love their chicken Alfredo. Had the Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake. It was also really good. We had a good time. I wish they'd kept the blinds up because after that the lighting was terrible for our pics."
Adam G.,"Nashville, TN",9,4,6,1.0,5/15/2015,"Bad service! will never return to this location. No need to explain, read all the terrible reviews on here about it. This location is just terrible. Hopefully the home office cares enough to read what's going on at this location"
Woody H.,"Nashville, TN",17,3,1,1.0,4/10/2015,"Was very disappointed the service was terrible, food was ok, check was $$$ all of this after a hour and a half wait. Maybe a good place for cheesecake and coffee but not for dinner!"
Brandyn B.,"Antioch, TN",391,19,2,5.0,10/5/2015,"Today, was my first time going to this particular location. Heather, my bartender was amazing. I ordered chicken tenders & I was brought out wings. She immediately apologized and made everything right. Her customer service is exceptional! Great job Heather!"
Frances R.,"Franklin, TN",0,10,1,1.0,11/3/2015,I was so disappointed. Our waiter was nice but lacked experience. My $18 asian chicken salad was horrible. It was soggy and the dressing tasted like soy sauce. i assumed it was going to be tasty asian. We told the waiter and he only apologized and said others have said the same. We didnt eat most of our meal it was so bad. I wish I had read the reviews before I went. I will never go to a Cheesecake Factory again. I felt robbed.
Lori H.,"Franklin, TN",0,11,,1.0,5/17/2015,"I called to make a reservation for a party of 9 and was told that it is a first come first serve basis and they do not take reservations. I had friends driving almost 2 hours for dinner and knew they would not want to stay out late. I get to the restaurant at 6:30 on a Saturday night and request a table for 9. I was told the wait would be an hour and a half to 2 hours. Not knowing where else to go on short notice we all decided to wait. The restaurant was not that busy and we saw people who came after us get seated within half an hour.  Of course we spoke to who I think was a manager who apologized but did nothing else. I asked why the hostess did not at least offer us a seat at the bar to get some drinks and the manager explained that the bar is also first come first serve and that you get a seat when you can. They do not seat that area. I explained that this was our first time here and we didn't know. I also asked why they do not accept reservations since it seems like this type of situation would happen quite a bit and was told that it's just policy and they just do what they are told.  We finally get seated 2 hours after waiting outside. This is after 3 people in our party left because it was as so late. We get a very nice young man as our server and he tried very hard to get us back in a good mood. He brought us extra bread and started getting us our drinks. We all started to feel a little better, but after about 10 minutes the bread was gone and we still didn't have our drinks. We finally get our drinks and the beer was warm and the cocktails did not have enough alcohol in them.  At some point our servers changed and we ended up with a very nice young lady as our server who did a great job with us. She was very apologetic and I'm sure she was nervous to serve us because we were in such a bad mood after waiting so long for everything. We waited quite a while for our food and when it finally arrived it was all mediocre at best. We all ordered different things and not one of thought there was anything special about it.  We spoke to another manager again before leaving and again I asked why do they not accept reservations and again he said again it's first come first serve and they had more problems with parties being late and then losing their reserved table and of course getting angry.  Their policy is not first come first serve. We arrived before a lot of other smaller tables and were not first served. We all felt lied to multiple times throughout the night by staff and I feel like we should have at least gotten a free piece of cheesecake after they ruined our celebration. Needless to say this was our first and last time at this place."
Hugh B.,"Nashville, TN",0,2,,1.0,2/11/2015,"I ordered what use to be my favorite dish, the Thai Lettuce Wraps, only to find the chicken to be raw after I had taken a bit!  Yes, it was sent back promptly and confirmed raw by the waiter, kitchen manager, and floor manager.   I don't know about you, but there's not too many thing more unappetizing than raw chicken, not to mention dangerous as far as food poisoning.   The manager apologized and removed it from the bill.  Since neither my fiancé nor I trusted the rest of our meals (my appetite was gone), we had uneaten items that remained on our bill that we just couldn't stomach.  Yes, I could have argued the point and probably been comped the meal.    Instead I kept my composure and learned that the Cheesecake Factory has a total disregard for customer satisfaction and retention.  At no time was I asked the most important questions of all: ""how can we make this right so you'll come back again?"" You've been warned.  If you choose to eat there (if only for food safety)  please check that your food is properly cooked, especially the chicken! This was a horrible experience. Neither I nor my fiancé will be a returning customer.  In fact, she's already cancelled two business lunches she had planned this month."
