Amie S.,"Sausalito, CA",1,37,9,2.0,4/7/2015,"I eat at the Cheesecake Factory often and have been to more than a few all over the country for the past decade. I was ecstatic when one was finally opening near my house. This one however is different. I've eaten here 3 times now, gotten sick after every time. The normal dishes I order are different here. There is extra random sauces on the food that other locations don't have, or the food is drenched in what the normal sauce is. Service has always been wonderful, atmosphere of course is wonderful. For now though, I will still be driving to the Greenhills one to get the quality food that I'm used to. Hopefully it's just the newness of the restaurant and the chef learns to make the Cheesecake Factory dishes taste like the Cheesecake Factory is supposed to."
Ken J.,"Franklin, TN",9,94,3,3.0,5/29/2015,"The food is just okay, it's cheesecake factory, it's the cheesecake that makes it all worthy of the silly prices. They have decent burgers and salads, but nothing that is outstanding. The service is usually slow, but that always seems the case with any of the locations I have visited."
Thomas S.,"Spring Hill, TN",0,8,,3.0,9/24/2015,"Food is good and the service in the restaurant is good; however, if you sit outside, they seem to forget about you."
Kim W.,"Gordonsville, TN",0,7,,1.0,11/23/2015,"Disappointed is an understatement. Got the factory burger on the sourdough bun. The bun was actually like a baguette, hard and chewy. The burger was small and the side fries were lukewarm. My husband got a flat bread, pot stickers and we shared the crab cakes. Portions were very, very small and the prices were very high. 1 slice of cheesecake was $8.00. We shared the Strawberry Cheesecake, the crust was mushy and the topping tasted like they came out of a can. I have had better meals at Steak and Shake, and better cheesecake from Kroger. The pricing for what you get is astounding, will not be back.  Service was good, atmosphere was a bit high brow for my taste. Don't really understand why they are so busy with small portions of mediocre food for a high cost."
Chris S.,"Nashville, TN",46,100,16,3.0,8/27/2015,"Just had lunch here. Our server was just fine...never went thirsty. The bread was good but the butter was so cold it came from the arctic. I don't know why restaurants do that....take a note...take the butter out of the fridge first thing then leave it out...it wont go bad. I ordered the chicken picatta (lunch portion). To be honest, it wasnt that great. It had a pretty meh flavor about it. It wasn't bad necessarily but not memorable. i would say i did not have a meal that was worth 15.00 from a chain restaurant."
John S.,"Franklin, TN",10,13,4,5.0,1/30/2015,"Given other reviews, I was worried about our visit tonight (5:45 on a Friday night). There was an hour wait for a table but we grabbed a seat yourself table in the bar area within about 5 minutes. The service was prompt and attentive. The food was both delicious and out fast. Even with appetizers and cheesecake (of course!) we cashed out just over an hour after arrival (and that includes appeasing a preschooler). I have never been a fan of the Green Hills location. We only gave this location a chance because we were going to mall anyway. I am quite shocked  that I look forward to coming back very soon."
Tony B.,"Lawrenceburg, TN",1,18,1,3.0,10/28/2015,"Great atmosphere -well below ""good service"" and average food.  Tables crammed together and makes for a awkward serving environment for your waiter.  Bottom line, it's chain restaurant with a high end prices. Skip it."
Lisa E.,"Nashville, TN",0,44,,1.0,1/7/2015,"Went for lunch and tried one of the many salmon lunch dishes.  The salmon came uncooked like I have never seen in a restaurant.  It took a while to come out and I needed to get back to the office so I ate the tasteless veggies and left the fish.  As I was leaving, I told the server that my fish was not cooked and while I didn't want anything special, I wanted her to tell the cooking team. She saw a manager close by and he came by to see the problem.  He (and she) showed appropriate concern and offered to get me something else to eat.  I didn't have time to wait yet appreciated the offer. While the fish was the biggest concern, the sides of broccoli and carrots were pretty tasteless making the full meal nasty and a waste of $15. I did grab a slice of the carrot cheesecake for a friend and it was an odd mix and nothing I would get again.  I only went there to grab the cake for a friend and won't be returning."
Ray F.,"Nashville, TN",0,13,1,1.0,12/20/2014,Need to do a better job estimating time.  Told us 65 minutes now been an hour and a half.  We could have kept shopping.
Rebecca M.,"Middletown, OH",0,5,,3.0,7/5/2015,"We eat at Cheesecake Factory occasionally and while we like it, I always walk away feeling like I paid too much for the quality of the food. I don't like that they don't put the price on the menu for the cheesecake and this visit, my food was subpar. My steak was nearly burnt when I asked for medium rare, and my scampi was dried out (what??). Underwhelmed would describe my meal at this location."
Maria R.,"Nashville, TN",0,3,,1.0,1/11/2015,"If I could give this restaurant less than 1 star I would.  The manager is very rude. We called and tried to make a reservation for 18 people, some how though s group of 13 was allowed to but not us. We decided to leave after we were seated because there was an open table for 8 and then we would have waited for a Lille lone for the other 10. When we talked to the manager she spoke in a very demeaning manner and was dismissing. We ended up going to green hills, which is where we will continue to go as their management is much much nicer."
Robin D.,"Franklin, TN",4,11,4,2.0,9/25/2015,"First off, let me say that my husband and I have been going there about once a week since they opened several months ago. We always sit at the bar since we always go pretty late after work and there is never a wait to sit there. Our experience always depends on who is working behind the bar. As a restaurant owner, I am very understanding that sometimes people have a hard time separating what they are going through in their personal lives from their attitudes at work and it's not always fair to judge someone on a bad day. However, last night the bartender was so rude, all we wanted to do was leave and I wish we had sooner. We came in about 10:30, not realizing that they close at 11:00. There was no one else at the bar so it was just us she had to wait on. She never welcomed us or smiled once, keeping a look of disgust on her face even when I tried to make light conversation with her. She had waited on us before so I knew a little about her history and know that she is transferring to a new store in California soon. Trying to lighten things up I said, ""you're still here, you haven't left yet?"" just curious if she was still headed to Ca. She said, ""Unfortunately, I am"" and said nothing else. My husband asked for a second drink and she took his glass poured the drink and handed it back and took off to the kitchen. My husband quickly noticed that she didn't put any ice in it so we just sat and waited, when she finally came back my husband asked if he can have ice in his $7 drink and she added ice with no apologies. After a few minutes having had my food in front of me and just a minute or so after my husband had his food she asked me if I wanted a ""small box"" for my food. I don't think she had looked at my plate because I hadn't touched it and it was a large plate of food. I said, ""not yet, are you about to close?"" to which she replied, ""We closed seven minutes ago!"". I looked at my phone and realized that it was 11:07. Even though we had just gotten our food and she just poured a glass of wine at this point I had had enough and I was ready to leave. I said, ""I am really sorry. I am not sure if you remember but we are the people that own a couple restaurants and we tip well, I didn't realize that you close at 11:00. She replied, ""I don't care at all about the tip!"" I asked her for boxes and we hurried to get out of there. Overall, it was just a bad experience. I would give it one star but that's not fair to the other bartenders there that have been really nice. Most are really nice. I don't know what we did to deserve to be treated like that. Even if we came in 10 minutes to closing I would never expect that. As restaurant owners, we gladly welcome any customers until we are closed. I am sure of the time we came in because my mother called when we were on Mallory at 10:24 PM. I wish her good luck at the new store and hopefully this was just a onetime thing."
Summer G.,"Antioch, TN",0,12,,5.0,10/27/2015,Awesome place... The food was amazing and the server was nice; Our food came out in a timely manner with our dinner; I will return
Tanner D.,"Franklin, TN",10,7,,1.0,1/12/2016,Pack you in like sardines.  If you don't mind being elbow to elbow with the party on each side of you then you'll love it.
S B.,"Roswell, GA",0,6,,4.0,2/6/2015,Went went to lunch after church last week and had a wonderful experience at the Cool Springs Cheesecake Factory. We were a party of 3 and sat down immediately at at high top in the bar area. Great Meals and even better Dessert!  Love the red velvet cheesecake!
Steve H.,"Thompson's Station, TN",1,15,1,2.0,12/13/2014,"My wife visited your Cool Springs location last night in Franklin. Not a good experience, sat next to a couple who was still eating their meal, we order drinks and meal. Drinks took a while, then the couple left, the table was cleaned, a new couple sat down and they rec their meal before us, asked the waitress (Paige) and she started to say they ordered Pasta, then I think realized we did too. She said she would check on our meals, kept on walking around with no feedback, finally requested a manager from a Busboy, mgt showed up and said he would check on it right away. Waitress came back and said the food was coming up.... About five minutes later it did show up, but I would think the manager would have came back and provided us with feedback. NOT a very good visit to your new restaurant. Not worth the wait to get a table or serving people out of line.  One more note, compared to the other Cheesecake Factory in Nashville, the open seating at the Franklin location did not allow for a nice dinner, loud atmosphere."
Scott W.,"Brentwood, TN",0,8,,2.0,2/10/2015,"No complaints about the overall quality of the food, but the service (regardless of how busy the restaurant is or the day/time chosen) seems spotty.  Some of the food was cold, we had to ask for straws, no bread plates provides, we had to ask to order cheesecake, and each step of the seating-ordering-eating-billing process took longer than one would expect.  Not sure what all of the issues are, but, for the prices charged, the service needs to improve substantially."
Susan W.,"Franklin, TN",0,9,,1.0,2/7/2015,"Their YELP site indicates they take reservations.  If you call them, they tell you to wait in line.  With only marginal reviews and so many other good restaurants, why would I want to wait?"
Edward L.,"Nashville, TN",0,23,9,2.0,8/7/2015,don't get anything besides cheesecake unless you wanna get fat and lose your good 401k
Justin C.,"Birmingham, AL",3,4,3,5.0,5/20/2015,Awesome wait staff! Server was on top of everything. Food was incredible and the cheesecake was to die for. The whole experience second to none. We will be back very soon! Great job!
