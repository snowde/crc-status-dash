Anthony L.,"Harrison, United States",0,23,50,4.0,3/9/2013,I've had bad experiences here in past bc of   since this is a very busy location.  This time here got seated in 10 minutes even though it seemed lots of people waiting on tables.  We hade Pre movie Drinks and dessert. Everything was fine. Prompt service got the orders right and checked on us the right amount.  The Asian Pear Martini was delicious but I didn't really like the Raspberry martini.   I tasted some of  my wife's Lemon Drop martini and it was good.  The red velvet cheese cake was great and tiramisu cheesecake was just ok.
Samson L.,"Middlesex County, United States",657,427,2607,3.0,14/6/2017,"I've been here multiple times in that past and after a long 5 year hiatus,  twice in the span of two weeks.  Overall the food and service is not bad. Like many reviewers noted, the portions are humongous! After eating here, then eating at another restaurant, it makes you feel gypped and question the value of food at other places. There's good amount of food, but does it taste good? For the most part its hit or miss, with such a big menu, there has to be! After many visits here, these are the dishes my family would order:  avocado eggrolls, thai lettuce wraps, artichoke spinach dip, chicken madeira, masala chicken, shrimp with Angel hair pasta, factory chop salad, cobb salad, oreo cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, chocolate tower truffle cake, & strawberry shortcake. This place is great for kids - only of you come early, which shouldn't be a problem since they usually eat early.  Otherwise, you'll have to endure a  . The food from the kids menu are just ok. They'll eat it, especially if they want dessert! It's loud, so if your kids are acting up, no one would really notice too much. There's also an area by the hostess to park your stroller! With the nice ambience, you don't feel like your roughing it by going to a Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's. I can see why many reviewers are disenfranchised by the wait time and occasional service issues. Those issues are minimal when you eat there early. There's a lot to like - the menu has a huge variety for the most pickiest eater, there's a good salad variety and some gluten free items, reduced calorie menu,  an outdoor patio, there's a bar, there's a nice selection of cakes, cheesecakes and some ice cream as well.  This will never be my first preference to dine in if given a choice, but it's not bad for large parties, drinks (no experience with this) , outdoor dining, for salad, the sweet tooth, and for families with young kids."
Joe M.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, United States",0,1,,1.0,15/7/2017,"This was my first experience at the Cheesecake Factory and I can honestly say that it will be my last. This is also my first yelp review; today is a big day for me.  After constantly having to wait to get a table and for our waiter to acknowledge us and take our order we finally place our order and begin another   to get our food. After about 20 minutes are waiter tells is that we are just waiting for the salmon ordered by a member of my party, no big deal.  They finally bring out our food and the salmon was burnt and my meal is missing (I ordered chicken). After 5 minutes of trying to find our waiter he comes over and tells us that they gave my meal away to someone else and they are making another. After a thinly veiled apology he tells us the manager will come over and talk to us (he never did) and disappeared.  Overall a horrible experience all around and I will not return"
Tara L.,"Jersey City, United States",0,4,,2.0,17/6/2017,. Slow service! Mediocre food..just another chain. I prefer diner food. If you're looking for a good meal don't go here. Even outback is a better choice. Not worth your time or money. Please take my advice!!
Maryanne N.,"Keyport, United States",38,165,,2.0,24/8/2015,"Sigh. Showed up around 1:15 pm on a Sunday afternoon. It was busy but we decided we'd just eat at the bar since we thought it would be faster. It was...for everyone at the bar who wasn't us. We got our drinks pretty quick and the bartender took our order after serving our drinks. Close to 40 minutes later, my husband called the bartender over and asked what the status was with our food (mind you, it was a salad and a brunch order of french toast). He said he'd check on it. And apparently it was coming out ""now"". Five minutes later, still no food, an increasingly cranky husband, the manager comes over with her fake sweet voice saying it's just being ""finished"" (umm...i thought it was coming out) but would we like something else in the meantime like soup or a salad. Um - no. We want the food we ordered. The same food we see people all around us being served, many whom arrived very long after us. Finally, at about 53 minutes after ordering the food arrives. My guacamole salad was good. His french toast was tasty but I could have easily argued it was VERY underdone in the center. I didn't because what would the point have been? We got the bill and they did NOTHING for the  . So the bartender got a crappy tip which left me feeling badly but he did nothing to address the  , only apologized after we pointed it out and did nothing to improve the situation. Will definitely NOT be back."
Keith K.,"Freehold, United States",67,101,2,2.0,6/5/2013,"If you like chain places this place is ok.  The cheesecakes use to be alot better but this place is just ok.  Being in freehold nj, there is always a   so it might be better to look elsewhere.  Food is overall good and drinks are well made.  They have excellent sandwichs and appys."
Melissa H.,"San Diego, United States",19,191,16,4.0,7/4/2012,"I am normally not a chain restaurant eating person but since I had never been to a Cheesecake factory before, thought I would give it a try.  The first time we attempted to go, it was a weekend fir dinner and there was a 2.5 hr wait!  The high tables in the bar and the bar seats are first come first serve and not a spot here was clearing anytime soon.  We did not want to wait so we came back a few weeks later on a Sunday at 1pm.  Although there was still a 30 min wait, we were able to get a spot at the bar right away.  The decor is very inviting and warm.  As we looked through the menus, I was overwhelmed by the variety and slightly confused as what kind of food the Cheesecake factory focuses on.  Identity crisis I must say.  I looked thru both the regular menu and the skinny menu.  After hearing how big the portions are and how the calories could really add up here, we sort of kept to the skinny menu.  We were impressed!  I started off with a skinny mojito and hubby ordered a skinny sangria.  What made the mojito ""skinny"" is that they use sweetener vs regular sugar or sugar syrup.  It was refreshing and surprisingly tasted like a normal mojito.  The husband ordered a skinny sangria which he really wasn't raving about.  The skinny in this is that no fruit is added.  From the reg menu, I ordered the lunch miso salmon with a side of sautéed spinach which I paid extra for.  It was delicious and the portion was still sufficient considering it was a lunch item.  I highly recommend the miso salmon.  Hubby ordered 2 items:  ahi carpaccio fr the skinny menu and the tex mex egg rolls fr the reg menu.  Was super impressed with the ahi carpaccio---for the portion size and tastiness, I'm afraid to say this of a chain restaurant, but its the best!  Nothing special about the Tex mex eggrolls---tasty but not any worse or better than other tex mex rolls I've had.  To finish off our Cheesecake factory experience,  I took a look at the dessert display case and the menu and man, the variety of dessert is insane!!!  We ended having the caramel macadamia cheesecake which was very good but probably would choose a different dessert if I ever returned so I could get my nose in something new. Tip:  avoid a   and go during off times"
Alex K.,"Chicago, United States",0,62,2,4.0,7/4/2012,"Yeah, I love the food in this place. It is so super-sizingly good, and the menu is so huge, there is literally something for everyone. My experience there was as expected-  to be seated, friendly and prompt service, cheesecake for desert that made me sleepy for an hour afterwards, and a not so painful bill at the end. Aside from eating way more calories than you'd usually want to, this Cheesecake Factory location is a solid choice."
