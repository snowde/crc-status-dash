Ken G.,"Fresno, CA",22,21,8,5.0,11/9/2017,"We have not been here in many moons. I just had a Steak Diane  I could cut with a fork. Now if a 3/4 "" cut of meat is that tender, well worth the visit.  We also recommend the egg roll sampler.....very flavorful.  Someone in the kitchen is on their A game to be sure."
Amy G.,"Fresno, CA",0,14,4,1.0,12/7/2017,"Today was supposed to be an enjoyable holiday meal with my department from work at this establishment. Sadly, it was a very disappointing visit. My department decided to have our holiday department luncheon with a large party of 15 on a time limit. I decided to order the skinny chicken pot pie. When it arrived, there were only two tiny pieces of chicken in that whole platter full of gravy.  I called the waitress over to inform and show her my plate and asked if they could at least put a few more pieces of chicken. The waitress returned from the kitchen and said the chef told her there was enough chicken and returned my plate to me (nothing was added).  I then asked for a different item but that wasn't any better because it took extra long for it to come out. By the time it came out,  my team was finishing eating their dessert so I asked for the plate to go.  My team was already eating dessert at this point so I asked the waitress if they could at least throw in a piece of cheesecake since they took so long to bring out the new plate and for the fact that I didn't get to enjoy my meal with my team. The manager came back and said no, he would not offer a free piece of cheesecake.   Now, normally I wouldn't mind being told no but this manager was very rude and spoke to me in an angry tone. The Cheesecake Factory is not cheaply priced and you would expect more from a reputable place to recitify a failure on their part to provide decent service even if just a simple apology.  I've had many years in customer service management and know how management should conduct themselves in business. This was very unprofessional and any manager who speaks to their customers in this tone should not be a manager. I will be contacting corporate office and anyone else I need to to let them know just how poorly Garry Choi conducted himself. Myself, my family and my coworkers will no longer be taking any business back to this Cheesecake Factory. They did not take the meal off the tag because ""I was given food."" Too many other great places in Fresno to take our business to."
Patricia M.,"Mariposa, CA",14,10,5,5.0,11/6/2017,The steak medallions were absolutely delicious!  And of course the celebration cheesecake was to die for!  I will be back...
Stephanie S.,"Clovis, CA",7,70,142,4.0,12/26/2017,I've been to Cheesecake Factory quite a bit always for lunch or dinner but it's not my favorite chain restaurant to go too. You do need some time to read the menu as it's over 20 pages long with a variety of food options with no specific specialty aside from cheesecake. This visit was my first to try their breakfast and I was impressed with the amount of pancakes I received. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and it came with 3 Big cakes that were delicious. You could see the lemon zest in every bite. I also tried the creme brûlée French toast which didn't seem like a lot of food but my boyfriend said by the time he finished he was full. The fresh squeezed orange juice was tasty but expensive for a small glass that wasn't filled to the top. We came first thing in the morning to avoid any wait which was great.
Janna L.,"Bakersfield, CA",285,1276,928,5.0,10/30/2017,"Service was great at the cake counter. Just ran in to grab a couple of slices. How the heck can one choose? So many kinds. All looked good, fresh. Finally purchased the lemon meringue cheesecake and the dulce de leche cheesecake. WOW! So amazing. Even the whipped cream made it a few hours until home. One even kept well in the fridge until the next day. I could not pick a fave between the 2. Both good and not too sweet. Great choices. Almost $18 for 2 slices... I am not sure how I could come in here and not order a meal. I love it here. I did not grow up with a Cheesecake Factory nor do I get to visit it often enough (usually just 1-2 times a year in Vegas). I love the menu and if I could only have 1 dessert ever, it would be this restaurant's cheesecake. I cannot imagine with all the varieties, making a bad choice. A real treat."
Lorraine C.,"Selma, CA",146,260,1628,4.0,9/3/2017,"Okay, yes I know it's a chain restaurant, but it's also delicious. I've been coming here since it opened up and I can't recall a bad visit to this particular location. Service has always been up to par and the food is always freshly made. My BBQ chicken salad makes me smile and say ""mmmm"" every time! I do appreciate that they offer lunch portions of my favorite salad and other dishes. It makes trying new things a lot easier. Place is clean and also conveniently located outside of the Fashion Fair Mall so walking off your lunch/dinner is a cinch.  Oh let's quickly talk about the cheesecake. It's sweet, it's savory, it's beautiful and it makes both my heart and belly happy in ways people can't even. Lol jk but seriously it's goood. Whether it's the plainest of all cheesecake or a fancy shmancy one, you won't be let down."
Belinda C.,"Fresno, CA",0,3,4,5.0,1/1/2018,Best waiter we have had !! He took his time to listen and came enough times to the table to make sure we had everything we needed. I wish we remembered his name. Service was great
Holms W.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,1,3.0,1/8/2018,"I like the atmosphere and this place, but the foods are not that great than other Cheesecake Factory. Pasta is too salty and too oily. But the cheesecake is good"
Paul P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",29,147,1070,5.0,6/20/2017,Stop by the cheesecake factory tonight to have a bite for dinner very pleased with the portions and the flavors of the dish I had this evening I had chicken piccata with a hint of lemon For an appetizer I had they bang bang shrimp with spicy spicy sauce Quite delicious everything was really fresh and I have to give a shout out to the waitress she was top-notch I like a Cheesecake Factory and We will be back again
David l.,"Encinitas, CA",117,81,153,5.0,10/20/2017,"As always, this Cheesecake held true to the brand.  Clean and friendly and food was great.  Kourtney F was our server and was delightful and attentive.  Great job Cheesecake Factory.. even if your passing through a city it's nice to have a restaurant you can trust.. Cheers"
Ness S.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,156,386,3.0,7/12/2017,"Let's hop right to it! This restaurant is located in a busy shopping center especially weekends came on a Friday for lunch with family. Very nice cheesecake factory one of the smallest ones I've gone to but the way the seating is arranged it accommodates all guest. It took about 20min to be seated which wasn't to bad. When it came to customer service everyone was friendly and attentive to our needs. The negative with me is I dislike silverware on the table I watch how they wipe down the tables with the same cloth and then put your eating utensils on it (I'm weird with germs medical field issues lol). When I asked for plastic silverware after my food was brought, I put my hand out to grab them from my waitress she put them right on the table ugh:-| defeated the purpose of me asking smh, I just wiped my fork off and prayed for the best.  My food was delicious no complaints there I had angel hair pasta with as side of shrimp with asparagus and to drink a strawberry daiquiri. Would I return if in the area maybe."
Tricia L.,"Hanford, CA",4,27,36,4.0,12/3/2017,"The location is great for after a day of shopping! The atmosphere is beautiful. The food is amazing! We ordered the Carne Asada steak medallions. The beef was cooked perfect and a very tender cut, juicy and thick. It was bursting with tangy flavor. The pasta Napoletana was bomb!!!!! Robin was our server at table 83. She was very kind and welcoming."
April G.,"Fresno, CA",5,26,7,5.0,12/31/2017,One of my favorite places to come for pasta! I love the spicy chipotle pasta it is fantastic!! The roasted garlic with chicken is also very good. I have been here many times and usually always have good service and you can call ahead seating.
Michelle M.,"Porter Ranch, CA",0,13,,2.0,1/1/2018,They were outta artichoke dip?? Wait what!? I was so disappointed and shocked and ended up ordering the crab dip which sucked! Time for somebody else to do the ordering cause it seems to me the artichoke dip should be a staple! Sad to see the comment back from the restaurant- not only did they not read it- but I never mentioned which location and they assumed it was Fresno. Actually it was Woodland Hills - Cheesecake Factory - please read the comments- that's the ONLY way your service will ever improve.
Carlie C.,"Fresno, CA",323,76,118,4.0,5/5/2017,"4 stars because the service lately has been great... the drinks and food are consistent.  I really appreciate the multitude of options available on their book of a menu... especially how accommodating they are to my GLUTEN FREE lifestyle.  The sweet corn tamale cakes are such a treat to my limited diet and the Godiva cheesecake is always a great gluten-free dessert option yum! Their cocktails are great!   I would say this is my go-to restaurant in Fresno area due to the options and I can always get something that I want.     Things that can improve their rating:  They NEED to start accepting reservations!!! (biggest downfall of the entire restaurant) I have wanted to book Cheesecake for my birthday dinner, family events etc... but due to their inability to accommodate larger parties with reservations we always eat elsewhere  The RESTROOM maintenance: whenever I have to use the restroom at this location there is water splashed all over the sinks, toilet paper not on rolls (which is a health code violation) etc... just need more attention to their facilities Overall a great chain staple in Fresno 5/5/17 - taking FOREVER TO GET APPETIZERS"
Maacah O.,"Hanford, CA",73,97,278,2.0,1/3/2017,"My boyfriend took me here the day after Christmas, we came in around 11:30 for lunch. I first walked up to the hostess stand where there were two women, and both of them didn't acknowledge me for about 5 minutes it was very awkward and rude. I felt like they could of at least said i'll be with you in a moment. but no, nothing.  We got sat fairly quick at a table, I asked the waitress if she could sit us at a booth and she found one in another location and sat us there. We got our drinks and meal ordered quickly and our waitress was on top of bringing us our refills and bread. She was kind of standoffish though and didn't seem too friendly.  I ordered pasta and my boyfriend ordered a burger, she brought out his burger and left and I was assuming bringing out my pasta, 5-10 mins go by still nothing. She comes out says they are still working on my pasta then leaves. It's always a pet peeve of mine when a restaurant brings out one persons meal but not the other at the same time. Finally I think a manager or supervisor came by and apologized for the wait, said there was some kind of mix up and my meal was being re processed... he offered me a side salad or fries but I declined. My boyfriend doesn't eat his food until my food is at the table out of respect so while my food was getting re cooked his food was getting cold. The manger offered to put his food under a heat lamp until mine was ready. My meal finally came out about an hour after I ordered and everything seemed fine, I noticed there was two kinds of pasta in my dish when there's only supposed to be bow tie but that wasn't a big deal. My boyfriends food however was cold. I was just disappointed because I told my boyfriend how much I love the Cheesecake Factory and then when we finally go, everything just fell short. When we got the bill and I was expecting at least a small discount for the long wait but nothing was. I don't know if we will be back to this location."
Tear M.,"Visalia, CA",0,35,24,2.0,12/25/2017,"ridiculous price  considering the service was mediocre as well as the food. We made a ""reservation"" 5 hours prior to their dinner as recommended by a host for our large party, our table was given away. Spent $30 at the bar on two beers domestic and a app, went to dinner an hour later when a table opened and spent $75 on two pasta dinners and two cheesecakes. Just a little FYI"
Kat C.,"Clovis, CA",190,8,4,1.0,11/22/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is my all time FAVORITE restaurant- I love coming here. I ordered my favorite dish, and guess what I find???? A PIECE OF PLASTIC IN MY PASTA!!!!!!! Are you kidding me? In my food? I could go on about how dangerous this is uhmmm are you kidding me this is a food establishment."
Ana B.,"Visalia, CA",4,92,173,3.0,10/14/2017,"It wasn't the best place I have ate, it wasn't the worse. The service was so/so. I had to ask twice for an item. Which I understand it was a little busy for a Saturday. But when you over pay for food and drinks you do expect A higher level of service."
Tania P.,"Tulare, CA",12,13,7,5.0,11/13/2017,"We went on a Sunday about 4pm and we waited maybe 20 min before seating our party of 6 not to bad considering it was the weekend. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was great we had the pork chops and truffle chicken, which my sister loved as well. The waitress was very kind and prompt in getting out orders and refilling our drinks. We tried a few slices of cheesecake of course and they were okay. I myself got the vanilla bean and my sis the banana cream cheesecake and they were good."
Zara D.,"Fresno, CA",58,82,86,1.0,3/1/2017,"Came here for a friends birthday dinner, we had to wait 3 hours to be seated, I would have changed locations... but it wasn't my birthday dinner. First of all when we were being led to our table from the bar (where we were waiting) we were told by our waitress that our drinks from the bar would be added to our tab, then the bar tender storms over to our table full of people acting like we were trying to not pay for our tab, talk about embarrassing. Our waitress brought out every single person's drinks besides mine and was extremely rude when I told her I think she forgot my drink and my water. 3 of us got sick after dinner. I was 10 dollars over when paying my tab and the waitress never brought my change expecting it was a tip... she definitely didn't deserve that much lol."
Rose D.,"Fresno, CA",126,267,718,4.0,12/3/2016,"I enjoy going to a restaurant with a smooth ambiance and good decadent food. I get all of that from the Cheesecake factory. I have ordered a number of items here, but my favorite is most defintely the cheesecake. There are so many flavors and styles, my mind boggles trying to decide what I would like.  I most recently ordered the herb salmon. This was my first time trying the salmon here, and I was not let  down. The salmon was seasoned well and fell apart with the simple touch of my fork. My sides included mashed potatoes and asparagas. I was let down with my four pieces of asparagas. It just didn't feel like there was enough. The potatoes were tasty and creamy. I could do with out the skin though.  Service is swell. I enjoy eating in the bar area, but the chairs are so close together, I feel like I am dating my neighbors beside me. I need more elbow room."
Mike C.,"Clovis, CA",3,16,106,4.0,10/3/2017,"Huge menu, full bar and endless cheesecake flavors. Service is always pretty good and very large restaurant with out door dining patio."
Maria G.,"Visalia, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/6/2018,Every time I go to the cheesecake factory I am impressed. The steak medallions are tender and delicious. The buffalo wings are the best in town in fact they will ruin all other wings for you. They are crispy with the perfect amount of spice. Excellent service every time.
Owen W.,"San Jose, CA",1,158,10,3.0,10/21/2017,"Oh Cheesecake factory ( CCF ), why is it almost always a disappointment ??? We took my girlfriends mother out to lunch today, as normal the CCF was pretty busy, but we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated right near the waiter stand when I saw a few other table that were open, but this time at least they weren't loud like the ones we have been to in the past. Over all the food was good, but the noise level seemed a bit high inside, so we ordered drinks and apps and everything seemed fine till we were told ""we are out of the wheat bread for a bit, but should have some soon.."" WTH I like sourdough, and she likes wheat bread.... Well can you bring it out to us when you have some ready, I sure can said the waiter.. Hmmmm So as we are eating our apps, which of course one of them was the Cuban roll, which I gave a epic fail rating, everyone at the table thought I ordered some fish in a roll with tarter sauce ( that's right CCF ) it was a really sucky roll. Meantime I see a few bus boy/girls walk by with wheat bread and no waitier in sight, so I flag down a bus person ( they always know whats going on ) and ask for Wheat bread, BANG Bread at our table and it has wheat in the basket.. Sweeettttttt So we eat more bread and finish our apps and get even more bread ( that was a big mistake ), Food food food food, bring out the food... Ok we are just hungry, so here comes the 2 salads, and then the pasta, and wait one more noodle salad for the girlfriend, ok everyone has food but me, ok anytime now, and then I see a waiter walk right by me and I think that's mine ...  Nope, so the clock starts to tick, and tick and tick and I eat more bread and drink my drink and of course tell everyone don't wait for me EAT, so now about 10 mins go by and I grab a bus boy, hey ummm we are missing a meal mine, can you check please. So about 5 mins later he comes back and says what are you missing and I said my bbq burger and he says I will be right back, by now our waiter swings by and says is everything ok here and I said Ahhh NO, we are clearly missing my Burger, and then I see the bus boy come out with a plate in his hand coming to my table and of course the 1st thing I think of I bet it's been sitting under the heat lamp for the last 10 mins or see, the cheese seemed cold, but he meat was warm/hot, so I said thanks and chowed  down. Our waiter appears once again asking about everything, and leaves and then we get drink refills and so on and after that things seemed better so we ordered desert, paid and left. Over all the food was good other then the cuban roll aka fish stick wrap, service was poor via the waiter, but the bus boys/girls saved the day .."
Susan C.,"Fresno, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/20/2017,wasn't what I expected the service was bad!  we sat down and they brought us our drinks flat coke doesn't taste old and flat the  service sucks ! Food took forever to come out! When it came out my eggplant Parmesan was full of oil it was greasy it tastes gross didn't look appealing .all around the experience was bad I'm very disappointed I thought this restaurant would be better save your money and your time and go somewhere else.
Tommy S.,"Stockton, CA",7,21,,5.0,12/20/2017,"My visit to the cheesecake  factory was a delight. The waiter we got was very nice, helpful, and had answers to all of your questions. Though I do not remember the waiters name he did a good job, and to top it all off I got the specialty tomato basil pasta. You sure get your moneys worth. It was a very good portion with wonderful flavors that make your taste buds sling for more. I also enjoyed the feel of the restaurant. It was very clean, and nice. I recommend this to anyone who is a food lover."
Olivia C.,"Fresno, CA",0,21,11,3.0,12/18/2017,"Foods are good and the service is ok,, but sometimes pasta is kind of too salty, but the cakes are really good and tasty!"
Johnny T.,"Fresno, CA",254,208,826,4.0,4/10/2017,"So I promised myself I'd never return after the horrific train wreck of a experience I had last visit but lo and behold like a roller coaster of Goliath proportions it was actually great this time like literally a whole different atmosphere maybe last time everybody was drunk or something yeah that's possible I mean I was unblinded by the difference, whoa and the service jeez the service was great,see kids it goes to show you second chances are what keeps optimism alive in the old Shnaz here I mean if it wasn't for second chances I wouldn't be married still that's how much I believe a bad experience can be overturned by a good old solid second chance :) 4 stars Cheesecake Factory I gotta say cherrio lads and lasses I tip my hat for a job well done ole boy"
Laura F.,"Hanford, CA",7,182,325,4.0,10/1/2017,Wanted to give them a 5 but service was on the slow side. Arrive at 11:00 or during off peek hours around 2 or 3 to avoid the crowds. I found eating outside gets me seated faster. Serving sizes are large. I was able to get three meals out of my order. Avocado eggs rolls are delicious. The dipping sauce really adds a lot of flavor. Waiters are very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Save room for cheesecake because the serving sizes are huge.
Steve B.,"Hanford, CA",0,10,1,2.0,1/1/2018,"2018-01-01 felt like going to Marie Callendars after they sold out, cut back on portions, quality of food, no cleaning staff but prices the same. Could've been a bad day for them but they were uncaring with no remorse, you know the feeling you get. We don't care what you ordered wasn't right. Restaurant nearly empty @ 3 pm no waiting etc.  Shouldn't have stayed didn't look right. Just wont go back. Forewarned is forearmed. Wonder who they sold to?"
Sandy S.,"Fresno, CA",12,5,15,3.0,5/25/2017,"The atmosphere here is really nice and relaxing. You have a choice to be seated inside or out. We came on a Sunday evening, the wait was not long at all.  I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon for $19.95. It was a grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. This dish was absolutely delicious, no complaints whatsoever. My boyfriend ordered the ribeye steak for $26.95. The steak was a decent size, I had a couple bites of his steak and it was also very delicious. It was cooked perfectly and was very tender. My brother in law ordered the avocado egg roll for his appetizer, I tried one and it was alright.  Service here was not so bad. My only problem was how long it took for the food to come out. Other than that, I enjoyed my visit here and I will probably come back sooner or later."
Lisa D.,"Fresno, CA",31,412,544,3.0,2/11/2017,"I don't mind the ambiance, but it almost seems like it's getting darker as the years go on. I had to assist my mom with reading her menu in the dull lighting, and she's only 46, haha. We were seated and served quickly. My go-to is the meatloaf, which has never wronged me, but this time, all the edges were a little burned. Nothing too crazy, but it definitely wasn't the same quality as my many previous hits. Our waitress was sweet, although not nearly as attentive as we would have liked. Understandable as the restaurant is always busy, but we too are customers afterall."
Limelight C.,"Fresno, CA",24,5,,4.0,12/1/2017,Overall experience this time was a 4 would have been a five if it wasn't for the open seating where we couldn't really enjoy our food without overhearing the conversation at the table next to us. As far as the food here my orange chicken was absolutely perfect a nice crispy batter tender chicken with good flavor I've had it at other cheesecake factories and the batter on the chicken is normally very hard and chicken is dried out. My lady had the miso salmon which I tried while she wasn't looking it was pretty good the salmon alone was nothin to rave over but the sauce completes the flavor profile. Our waitress was great she checked in at perfect times and was very nice.
Yanet A.,"Atwater, CA",0,90,28,5.0,11/25/2017,Love eating here. I always look forward to their bread and salmon dish. The mango cheesecake is to die for. I've never had a bad visit.
Don S.,"Clovis, CA",0,29,,5.0,11/17/2017,"Took a young birthday lady here for an early dinner. No reservations, just walked in from the mall.  We were seated promptly and were greeted by our server. We started with the egg roll sampler plate with the various dipping sauces. Absolutely delicious! Presentation was even nice.  Dinner was dinner, nothing special, but the service throughout the evening very good. Birthday song and dessert topped off a very nice experience."
James B.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",3,70,33,1.0,10/25/2017,"Good cheesecake. But I don't really know what their definition of curb side pickup is. We ordered 25 minutes ahead and by the time we arrived at the curb side, we called them up that we are at the curb side. After 20mins , we have noticed no one brought our orders and everyone at the curb side waiting started getting out of the car to get their order. So I joined the bandwagon and went inside myself. Of course there were 2 people that I followed ahead of me that just walked in and ordered cheesecake and they got their orders right away. Then it's my turn, and to my surprise my order was not even ready and they just started working on it. Next time, don't brag with curbside pickup if you guys don't have the services to do so. It's misleading bullshit and wasting our time. To the management, take note!"
Kate B.,"Irvine, CA",233,238,348,5.0,6/26/2016,Trying it out one more time. We were told the Sunday brunch cooks are different than the weekly cooks. And that they know how to make poached eggs. I'm returning again to find out if that's true. *fingers crossed* I'm not ordering eggs this time but someone in my party is. I am ordering the brûlée French toast. Keeping the stars at a 3 until the end of the meal. Ok. Meal is finished and the verdict:  Sunday is the day to order ANYTHING breakfast. They have redeemed the poached egg tragedy from Saturday.  5 stars today for the food.  Service was about a 3.  Check out the difference from Saturday's egg catastrophe  to Sunday's success.
Paola M.,"Oxnard, CA",73,2,,1.0,9/8/2017,I had the worst experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. I ordered curbside pick up and had to call twice to let them know I was there. I was told the wait would be 25 minutes and ended up  Waiting over an hour. I called a third time to cancel my order and the woman who answered the phone hung up on me.
Rick L.,"Crestview, FL",0,4,1,1.0,12/24/2017,This used to be one of my favorite places until I came to this one. The food was terrible and undercooked. I was never once asked how the food was or to have my $3.25 soda refilled.  Had 4 different waiters on a non busy day. I told the manager about my experience and he did not show any sign of genuine concern and laughed at me with his workers as my family and I walked away.
