Alexis B.,"Parrish, FL",0,33,24,4.0,7/10/2016,"We enjoyed our dinner here.  Service was good though the server was a little too attentive and kept interrupting us.  Hubbys order was wrong (chicken pasta instead of shrimp) but they corrected it immediately and let us keep both, which was good because the chicken was better he said.  Bread rolls were delicious and cheesecake was magnificent and huge huge portion.  I had chicken BBQ pizza, it was just ok, I wouldn't get it again, definitely had better pizza."
Gina H.,"Fresno, CA",0,21,,5.0,1/1/2016,"I really pay attention to detail and I never find a restaurant that earns 5 stars but tonight the star's aligned. To start great service from our server Rachel we were placed at a small table which was ok  since there was only myself and husband  I glanced apond a booth which was still to be cleaned and apparently she saw that and asked with a smile if we wanted to move we told her we'd leave it for a larger group even though we would like it and she insisted, more comfy. Food was excellent I had the eggplant parmesan and my husband the mac and cheese burger, drinks and godiva chocolate dessert. I will definitely return and I hope Rachel will be my server. Thanks for making our 26th wedding anniversary special."
Vic M.,"Chico, CA",0,359,608,3.0,5/16/2014,"If you like heavy desserts this place rates a 4. If you're wanting a meal it's a 3 or 3 1/2. Their small asparagus salad is great however avoid the chicken coated with pretzels as it's terribly dry with inferior chicken on a stick. Service is good. Want a house scotch on the rocks? Yes, they have it at $9.25 an unreal ripoff price. All in all not a bad place."
Patrick T.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,2,1,5.0,7/29/2016,"Oh my! One of the best experiences I've had in Fresno by far. Lovely atmosphere, great food, and exceptional service. The steak Diane was to die for, yum. Upon arrival, Emma greater us with a contagious smile and made our whole group fell very welcome. Our sever Leanndra was extremely  attentive and helpful with all of our needs. If I could give 6 stars, I would."
Christian E.,"San Diego, CA",39,9,,4.0,7/27/2016,"I've always liked this place. A huge menu will have you coming back time and time again just to try everything. I love the avocado egg rolls and the crab artichoke dip. Their cheesecake menu is great! Only negative is in the evenings, the light can be too dim which makes the menu hard to see."
Jeremy C.,"Madera, CA",203,117,3035,4.0,6/20/2014,"If your looking for options look no further this menu is huge!  I enjoy food, the ambiance and the many choices of items to order at the Cheesecake Factory. Perfect for date night or a family gathering. Average prices and if you like cheesecake there is great selection to choose from, you can order a slice or a whole cake. Me, I do not like cheesecake so I cannot tell how good it is or is not.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, wait staff are dressed well and professional. The parking at this location is not the greatest as it shares the parking lot with the mall. You just might be that lucky person who pulls in at the right time, and that right time would be as someone is backing out of a spot in front of the restaurant or right across from it.  I have not tried all the menu items so I can not speak for all the food. The food I have tried has been good, seasoned well and nothing to complain about. My favorite item so far is the free range roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots. I would recommend giving this place a try if you have never been."
Hector C.,"Tulare, CA",0,11,,2.0,4/24/2016,Was not really impressed with food quality. First time will probably be the last time I visit there again. Maybe if someone offered to take out I wouldn't refuse but other than that would not go. I can say I like the setup and overall appearance of restaurant food just killed it for me.
Jeniviva M.,"Fresno, CA",1,55,7,1.0,5/29/2016,"I would give it a zero Stars if I could. Ordered a cocktail then watched  the bartender drop the orange garnishes  on the floor, pick them up , wash them off in the sink, and put them in my drink. I called for the manager immediately, told him what happened then left. Nasty ass restaurant."
Melanie M.,"Fresno, CA",229,33,22,4.0,6/16/2016,Large menu and great variety of cheesecakes. Pricey but go for their happy hour. We always get the burger and a mojito!
Essance C.,"Fresno, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/6/2016,"Recently went here for the first time.  Long wait, rushed service when you finally are seated, burger was pink(I asked for fully cooked), wings were over fried & when I paid, the waitress didn't give me my change so I had to ask her for it & got an attitude in return. I took my dessert to go & the order on that was wrong but I didn't find out until I got home.  My first & last trip."
Eric L.,"Clovis, CA",0,73,1,5.0,10/5/2015,"Went back just for cheesecakes to go this time. Had mango and something red velvet.  Ah......superb quality, high end cheesecakes deserving 5 stars.  Will set you back about $20 though!"
Lulu C.,"Fresno, CA",124,153,247,5.0,7/6/2015,"We got a gift card for this place as a wedding gift. It was so nice to have a date night as newlyweds. It was sometime in the fall and we ate outside. They had standing heaters so the temperature was perfect. Warm and chilly all at the same time. We didn't do appetizers but they looked amazing. I ordered an Alfredo pasta and my husband had the peanut Thai pasta. My pasta was steaming hot and so creamy. It was everything I was craving! My husband's pasta (I had to snag a bite!) Was so different and delicious! I'm definitely set on ordering that dish the next ti.e around. Sadly, we didn't have the cheesecake this go round but they have them displayed at the counter when you walk in. They're glorious! But about 7.50 a pop and I wasn't in the mood to splurge. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The place was clean and had a great vibe. I'll definitely be back!"
Joey D.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/4/2016,"Honestly terrible. The food was cold when it got to us, 20 minutes after we ordered it. We ordered a few orders of cheesecake to go and a strawberry shortcake to eat there. It took them 30 minutes after we ordered dessert to tell us it would be 20 more minutes because the biscuits had gone bad. The manager didn't even apologize, he left the scene. We asked our waiter for the bill, and he returned 5 minutes later with it. I wouldn't come back to this particular Cheesecake Factory, and I would advise you not to. Terrible."
Harmony D.,"Newman, CA",0,70,34,5.0,8/24/2015,"Fantastic customer service. Great, consistently good food.   Love the curbside pick up."
San T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",204,132,548,2.0,8/19/2015,"Came here at the request of my brother for a dinner with the family. We ordered the french country salad, portofino pizza, jamaican pepper shrimp, herb crusted salmon, and the shrimp scampi. Honestly, the salad was probably the best dish for me and when that's the case, it's just sad. My dad ordered the jamaican shrimp, which was interesting.. but kind of salty. The herb crusted salmon had WAAAAY too much herbs and tasted off. The mashed potatoes it came with was good though. I didn't try the portofino pizza, but I'm told it was not that bad. Probably 3 star dish. My shrimp scampi looked really good, but it was a tad bit salty. Overall, mediocre food. We also ordered a slice of the strawberry cheesecake. Unfortunately, too sweet for my tastes. I don't think I'd come back."
Brian A.,"Fresno, CA",33,4,3,1.0,4/19/2015,Would have liked to be able to review the food but was reminded today why I never eat there. Got a gift card was planning on using it but after driving around for 15 min trying to find parking gave up. Suppose if I wanted to pay someone for me to visit there business I could have wasted my money there.  Hopefully someday I will be able to use my gift card but it won't be at this location.
Sharon K.,"Fresno, CA",21,23,2,5.0,6/29/2016,"What can I say, every single time we've gone the service is excellent and the food is fantastic......a little too much to choose from, but still a wonderful place for either a full blown meal or just a snack. FYI, they have the BEST mojitos anywhere in this town!!!!"
Alex A.,"Fresno, CA",3,18,,5.0,6/27/2016,"The one best thing here is the cheese cake because its sweet, rich, and delicious. My favorite food is sheperds pie. its so good and the meat oh ma gosh."
Dior S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,,1.0,12/9/2015,"This cheesecake factory is the worst. The service and the atmosphere was very uncomfortable because everything was rushed & food was just OK. The servers dont know how annoying it is to check on u every 2 mins..i just want to chill and relax wit my bf( it was his birthday) but here u cant do that. Just swallow your food ,pay & leave Anyways I liked the one in San Francisco a lot ..I won't be coming back to this one here ever even if its free .... Very bad"
Mr. Nice G.,"Fresno, CA",16,222,186,4.0,9/3/2015,"Pretty good place to eat, like everyone else I come for the bread and cheesecake. The four cheese pasta is my favorite."
