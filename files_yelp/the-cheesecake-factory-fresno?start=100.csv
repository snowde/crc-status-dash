Taushiya D.,"Fresno, CA",12,5,1,5.0,1/23/2017,The few times that I've gone here the wait hasn't been long and my food comes very quickly even though it was packed great service =)
Priscilla W.,"Fresno, CA",332,185,841,2.0,1/5/2015,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on several occasions but today I decided to give my review. Overall it is a timely meal service. I would advise you not to come here hungry. Come here with a few friends that you want to catch up with. Order a few drinks and try and get lost in the moment because your food isn't coming anytime soon. I came to have a late lunch with a friend of mine and this was the case.  I was not promptly greeted at the table and I was feeling a bit perturbed about that. My friend finally met me there when the waitress decided to ask me if I wanted anything. But never mind that let's speak on the food. I die for spinach avocado dip. So when I saw on the menu they had crab and spinach dip I thought how bad could this be - its the best of both worlds, right? Wrong. The dip tasted more like a seafood dip with cheese. The crab tasted ""fishy "" not like fresh crab taste. I don't know if they mixed in the crab juice or added some shrimp, it just didn't taste right. All night I've been praying and hoping that I don't run into tummy problems later.  My friend ordered hamburger sliders and the cheese triangles which is a play on the mozzarella sticks. The sliders were very good. The mozzarella triangles were really unique and tasty. My happy hour drink was the Cosmo which was very tasty overall it was a nice time but it was nice because I had great company. Had my girlfriend been a no show, I would have been very up set. If not I would have realized Hey speak to management about this?"
Chio S.,"Clovis, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/15/2016,"September 14, 2016-  This had been my very first experience with The Cheesecake Factory, and I can say it was absolutley EXCELLENT!  The waitress we had, for our last mintue 25 people party was absolutley amazing. Not only were they able to fit us all outside, they were more than happy to assist to our every demands.  Brittany M. our waitress had exceeded our expectations again and again. Being very poilet and attentive to our every need and complaint. The food portion was large and exquiste. The wait period was long as expected for a 25 people party and other guest, but not as long as other resturants."
David L.,"Fresno, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/1/2017,"Whenever I need to meet with clients I always suggest CCF. It's located in the middle of Fresno, right off of the 41 at Shaw. The menu is so large that I am always impressed with the servers because they always have an answer no matter which dish they get asked about. There are light (and cheap) lunch options. There's a new cheesecake ( I think it's new, anyway) that's covered in salted caramel. The. best. ever. Not a good place to go when you are on a diet. Yes, they have great items for dieters but one look at that display case and you'll fall off the wagon."
Alexandria T.,"Fresno, CA",0,4,9,4.0,11/7/2016,The food was great today everything was fresh and just came out so quick today was a good day here
Jessica Y.,"Clovis, CA",0,8,6,5.0,6/11/2017,"I love the steak here , service is understandable because it's always so busy! If you guys go, order the steak Diane !! It's amazing for 20$ ! Quality food!"
Layla R.,"Fresno, CA",13,27,10,3.0,6/10/2017,"Ordered some appetizers for happy hour and they were all just okay, tasted kind of fun of and the spring rolls didn't taste fresh at all. You get what you pay for."
Tina M.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,54,54,4.0,5/4/2017,"My friend and i went here last night for a late dinner around 10:30 ish...it was my first time here our waitress was pleasant.  I ordered the chicken riesling and my friend got the thai mango coconut chicken.. His was super yummy i was jealous so many textures and flavors going on there.  Mine was rich and flavorful definitely a splurge meal when ur not concerned about calories lol.  I had green iced tea probably the best one i've had at a restaurant in a while, he had the tropical iced tea he had no complaints so I'm assuming it was good cuz he is picky so i would've known.  We were so full and sleepy by the time we got done we passed on the cheesecake but next time um no we will not pass.  One thing though that menu is HUGE! way too many things it was super hard to make a decision on what to get...really we had a great relaxing dinner."
D. R.,"Fresno, CA",0,13,8,3.0,9/24/2017,"This place can be very busy on weekend nights, and doesn't take reservations. So Be prepared to stand for 30 minutes or less. They have valet parking, which is not a bad idea, space can be sparse. For this visit I came with party of three for lunch at around 3:30. It was a short wait, 5 minutes or less. I ordered the chicken avocado Club. What I received was a wet mess that fell apart in my hands. The bottom part of the bread was just wet, I don't know why. I ordered it with Mayo, on the side. The topside looked perfectly toasted, but I can't tell you how it tasted. I had it taken off the bill, but I had no food to eat with my family. I had them take it off the bill, and ordered the pumpkin pecan cheesecake. It was very Bland, I expected it to taste like pumpkin pie but no. Same issue with pecans, I expected it's taste like pecan pie. My 2nd guest ordered the salmon dish, which came with green beans and mashed potatoes. Which she said it tasted OK. There was a misunderstanding with the ordering.  We got overcharged $5, but had it taken care of. We also ordered the little cornbread dish, which was swimming in sauce, which made it mushy. Also veggie burger and power greens salad was deemed okay by 3rd guest. Staff is nice, and helpful."
Ron K.,"Fresno, CA",77,7,,2.0,6/6/2017,"The wait was horrible - well over an hour for our party of 9. No reservations past 4pm (idiotic).  Once we were seated, it took an hour to get our food.   As for the food, the last time I was at a Cheesecake Factory was 20 years   The food was satisfactory then, it is still just satisfactory.  It will probably be another 20 years before I return."
Kristen D.,"Fresno, CA",79,3,,5.0,6/4/2017,Your food is great and the portions are generous but please improve your phone system. 3/5 times I've called in to place a curbside pick up order and I've been placed on 10+ minute holds only to then be hung up on. Apparently it has something to to with the bakery staff being paged for the call- but if they don't hear the page the customer is left forever in limbo. I was actually advised by the staff to hang up and call again. Please fix this!
Rocky B.,"Fresno, CA",239,347,1503,4.0,12/2/2014,"For however long I have been coming to this chain (at this location and at others), I don't think I ever had an issue or problem with any of the food here. On a recent visit though, I tried their Hibachi steak. Pretty good! For $20, I thought it was well worth it. I would have liked more mushrooms though, but not a big deal. The Snicker Cheesecake I tried was really good as well, and everything else looked pretty good on the menu. My only gripe, is most of their table layouts here. Some of the tables are just way too close to another table. Another group was literally inches away from us, and you can hear their whole conversation. Lighting in this location seems too dim as well, and makes it a little harder to go through the menu."
Jocelynn S.,"Clovis, CA",0,12,,5.0,5/28/2017,"I love their sea food dishes, cucumber lemonade is to die for!! Obviously the cheesecake is always on point and the service is great! Love it!!!!"
Michael L.,"Fresno, CA",6,13,,4.0,6/14/2017,"I met a friend here the other night for a late dinner. We decided to sit on the high tables near the bar area. I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps, and they did not disappoint! The vegetables were crispy and fresh. The chicken was served hot and very flavorful. There are sauces that accompany the dish that go on top of the chicken, and they are incredibly delicious! I will definitely come back here! It is a busy, loud place as it is adjacent to the Fashion Fair Mall."
Larry E.,"Visalia, CA",60,7,23,1.0,7/18/2016,"Went to cheese cake factory in Fresno today and found a dead fly in my cheese cake, asked for a manager and all he says to me is oh would u like a new one. And I tell him no I lost my appetite and he says ok I'll take it off and I told him I'm not eating the other one cus they are all kept in the same refrigerator and he say well there's nothing wrong with the other one so u have to pay for it. And never once apologized. So to all of u who love cheese cake factory double check your food cus u just might find something dead in it. #Fresno #fresnoca #fresnocheesecakefactory #cheesecake #cheesecakefactory #snickers #oreo #cake #fly #deadfly #dead #foodporn #foodfail #management #nastyfood #food #desert #sweets #cheesecakes #cheesecakelover #cheeselover #cheesecakefactory"
Bob R.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Not only the worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory.  But the worst experience in ANY restaurant PERIOD.   On a Tuesday Night at 9:45 with a 3/4 empty Restaurant a 30 minute wait... Kidding Right... Nope. No care or concern from anybody in the place...Especially the ""mis-manager"" Cameron  No concern whatsoever.  No I am Sorry, no what can WE do. NOTHING!!!  He is the epitome of who NOT to be a manager.  It's no wonder why the place Absoutely sucked... Now just for accuracy, I  was there two other times within the last 20 days and all was well great service, smiles and what you would expect. BUT not this time... Poor Management (Manager) o yeah.... I WILL NOT COME BACK and will make sure everyone I know doesn't either... Shame on You Cameron... Get a grip on reality (not yours)"
Morgan T.,"Palo Alto, CA",267,55,170,5.0,10/14/2016,"This is the place for me to go when I'm having dinner alone and I LOVE IT. I always sit at the bar and the bartenders are amazing. The happy hour specials are great prices and plenty of options. The corn tamales are something different to try, and soooo good!"
Bella P.,"Fresno, CA",328,50,137,1.0,6/7/2016,"Cheesecake Factory review: I really had high hopes dining at this nice restaurant.  I Came with my family for the first time for my friend 20th birthday. We wanted to go somewhere pleasant, looking for great Food with wonderful customer service. Unfortunately we encountered a variety of issues that contributed to our unpleasant dinner that made everyone very displeased and upset at One point. To keep it simple and to the point the issues we experienced was the following 1. Dirty silverware 2 sets. 2.Unknow floating objects in my water black in color. 3 tons of flys. 4. When asked the waitress does the burrito have onions inside?, answer-no, burrito had grilled onions!, dish was returned. 5 Manager who we addressed about concerns, Garret was very dismissive to all of us along with some smart*** comments ""so nothing was good I can't believe that"" really last I checked I'm the paying customer with very valid concerns and for my family & friends to have the manager NOT TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING and to turn his back and walk away. Ok I'll make sure that I'll never come back  Not to make threats but to express the total out rage we felt & encountered at this restaurant I will share my story and hope that you can found this useful & prevent it from happening to you."
Iowa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",253,124,311,3.0,8/14/2017,"Our waiter wouldn't look or talk to any of the girls at the table. He would only talk to the one guy but not the other guy. It felt sexist if he hadn't also ignored the other guy at our table. I tried to ask questions to be included in the service, but all my attempts were ignored. Since I was sitting inside the booth and had two other people on the exit side of the booth, I even called the front from my phone to ask for better service since we were all looking to be serviced. This is one of the worse locations for service, but the food was made decent. It wasn't the best, but good enough to feed our hungry stomachs since the waiter only brought 2 small breads for 6 people. It was difficult even asking another waiter to bring us more bread. I really wanted to get cheesecake, but the waiter dismissed me as I was handed the check. I really couldn't even tell him what a disappointment his service was because he wouldn't even look or talk to us. The one guy he did talk to barely answered before our waiter would disappear. So I also had no time to get him to try to get the waiter to stay."
Lynnette S.,"Fresno, CA",36,3,,3.0,5/13/2017,"I asked for no onions, no chipotle sauce on my fish tacos and they served with both. So I scraped off each taco, I asked for corn cakes & it was undercooked & soggy.  I told waitress & she just shrugged off. Usually good there but this time the food was just okay tasting. The cook was off tonight even my husband's food was just okay not yum."
