Mel L.,"Fresno, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/10/2017,"One of my favorite places to eat, service was good. Food was great and you can't leave without having a cheesecake. I recommend this place to everyone."
Kirk A.,"Madera, CA",215,117,35,4.0,5/7/2017,Lot of selection and great Happy hour but don't laugh but my favorite dish is the nachos
Haley A.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/2/2017,"If you're looking for good service, make sure you don't get Gisette. WORST customer service I have EVER received. She brought me and my two friends meals out in 20 minute intervals and got ALL of our orders wrong. We didn't get a single refill in the hour that we were there. IM LIVID."
Jack D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,33,6,5.0,8/15/2016,"This review is solely based on the happy hour and happy hour food-  AMAZING. I mean that happy hour burger though!!! Like really? Damn that's good. They make the meat in house and it literally melts in your mouth along with the artisan bread they use. This and a side of fries with their aioli and you are set for a measly $7 during HH. Service is always good, never really like amazing but I would say consistently just good. Which is a plus."
Freddy R.,"Fresno, CA",14,8,1,1.0,9/12/2015,"WORST POSSIBLE SERVICE EVER!  I guess if you are under 21, have self esteem issues or don't really know anything beyond McDonald's, this MIGHT be the place for you. Otherwise, read on . . . I have personally been to this place around a dozen times over the last 6 years or so. The first few, it was OK. It was like watching Episode IV - A New Hope . . . Then, the new pattern . . . Last time we went - Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back . . . a group of 4 adults & 2 toddlers. Waitress literally rolled her eyes at my mother - Right in front of us ! ! All because she didn't understand the dish description. What a nerve!  We called manager & asked her dismissed from our table. Result - Big upset & left with stomach ache. Today - Same group of people. Arrive right before 5 on a Saturday. Asked for a booth & were tild 15 mins . . . 35 mins later . . . We're called over as beeper rings. We hand beeper over & ARE LEFT STANDING in front of hostess station 5 MORE MINUTES whilest NO ONE addresses us & continue talking amongst themselves. Today Part II - As I complain and ask if anyone is going to take care of us, one of them walks over to see where  a table might be open and directs a busboy to set it up! We ask why no booth (kids) & point over to previously open booths from mere moments ago (now seating someone who got there after us). With attitude, says it'll have to be a few more minutes! Today Part III - Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, I mean, I take it from my parents hands & ask what the problem is ALMOST 40 MINS LATER ! She presents further attitude  (stereotype coming up) . . . and disappears. I think her tongue ring was as disrespectful as her attitude! WE LEAVE! Today Conclusion - We drive 5 mins to the most wonderful restaurant with the most amazing meals, with a waitress that shined! Name of place - Black Angus on Shaw & Cedar. New Favorite  :) ! ! !  Thanks incompetents of Cheesecake Factory Fashion Fair Fresno CA ! ! !  You showed me the path to dining heaven - elsewhere :)!"
Alan T.,"Fresno, CA",310,103,238,4.0,9/8/2015,"I almost had a five-star experience here. We came here with dessert on our minds and left after consuming a whole lot more than that. We arrived on Labor Day at approx. 9:30 PM. Closing time on this particular evening was @ 11:00 pm. The atmosphere was low light and kind of romantic. Candles were burning at every table. We were seated at a two-person table which is the basis for my only real complaint of the evening - the table just wasn't big enough to allow us eat what we ordered comfortably. Our waitress was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive the entire time. We started with drinks - I had a beer and my wife had a Blueberry Mojito which she loved. So far so good - off to a very good start.  To eat, we ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps which are build-your-own style. What this means is that they arrive to you in parts - the lettuce,  chicken, sauce, carrots, cucumbers, etc. all come separate on the dish and you build your lettuce wrap yourself. I'd rather them come prebuilt but they were so good I didn't care. The chicken they came with was seasoned and grilled to perfection. The three different sauces that were included tasted great and I used all three together. In total, we were each able to make about 4 lettuce wraps which was more than we expected. Great deal in my opinion. In addition to the lettuce wraps, we ordered the Skinny Shrimp Soft Tacos (skinny calorie-wise) and three very fat (by appearance) soft tacos came to our table. They were filled with lettuce (maybe cabbage), chicken, tomatoes, avocados, and maybe some other items. At this point we were almost too full from the lettuce wraps to pay close attention to what was inside. My wife ate one and I ate the other two. The soft tacos were very good but the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps were the star of the night. We didn't order a main entree and were too full to order dessert (the reason we came lol). Let me add that before we ordered anything, we were given two types of bread (one dark and one light) and butter. The bread was delicious - the perfect combination of crust and softness. Overall, we were both really impressed. We have avoided this place for so long but really for no reason. We just always went to BJ's instead. They have a very extensive menu and a full bar. Another complaint I have is that if I am in the mood to drink a beer and eat, their beer selection is quite slim. This isn't really a complaint though because it's not often I drink and eat. We will definitely be back to try some of the other items that caught our attention on the menu."
Kim D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,35,5,1.0,5/23/2016,"If only there was a zero star that is exactly how I would rate this vile restaurant.  Not only was Miss Lakyn a horrible waitress, I asked for the manager twice and instead of speaking directly to me he/she sent Miss Lakyn as our messenger. I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied. Although this dinner ruined my uncle's first experience, he still offered a tip and she was still unappreciative.  BOTTOM LINE: Horrible customer service"
Ruth H.,"Fresno, CA",7,4,1,2.0,3/12/2017,I went there tonight for a birthday dinner and had to wait quit awhile to get seated. We got our food and the food was good. Then I ordered the fish and chips to take home for my husband. It took forever for them to give me my take out.  When I got home it was just fish and coleslaw no fries. This is unacceptable!!! I paid 17.99 for fish and coke slaw!!! I won't ever go back. There are too many other places to eat.
Ben F.,"Diamond Bar, CA",1,5,,1.0,5/23/2016,"I have not had the opportunity to go to a cheese cake factory in some time. I'm in Fresno for business for a few days and to my surprise one of the top 10 places to eat is it's very own local CCF... However that was the worst decision I have made on this trip thus far... I walked in with a friend and we elected to put our names to wait to be seated outside. Normal... Had a five minute wait.. Normal... And then the shit started to turn.. Two parties of two entered into the restaurant well after my party had, well past the supposed five minute wait, and both parties were sat prior... Ok... Patience being tested but not un common.. I then stood there for another approx 10 mins looking like a jack ass while all other parties around me were seated.. The hostess looked just as clueless as to what to do, and when I asked what the deal was they simply replied with ""oh we are going to seat you right now"".. I then proceeded to wait additionally... Very long and unpleasant story later, my plate came out first.. Sub par looking, and my other party member waited an addition ten mins for their food, at which time mine was ice cold.. Needless to say I sent the food back and couldn't wait to end what was sure to be my last cheese cake factory experience.. To list any of the staff by name would be unfair, it was a joint effort to succeed in an experience this bad. My waitress had a pair of glasses on her, and I couldn't really get her name off her name tag... She was quite horrible in overall attention to the table, not too mention she had no idea our food had even come out... Horrible service, horribly trained staff, probably most likely do to horribly bad management..  Plenty of other great places with better cooked food, decently priced meals, and a overall better experience to sit down and adhere to.. Do not waste your time with this pea-cocking excuse for a restaurant."
Viktoria Lynn L.,"Fresno, CA",83,81,340,1.0,12/27/2015,"After shopping at the mall and parking in the valet outside of the cheese cake factory my husband and I decided to eat here since Flemings does not open till 4 and we had time to kill. So we have given this place atleast 3 try's in one month, drinks are corporate so overpriced and barely any alcohol (but with drinks 10$ a drink they want you to keep drinking) so my advice have a martini not a mixed drink.  I had the hibiscus martini and it was actually really good! So the last time we came here which was yesterday it was such a bad experience. Food wise that is; customer service is always amazing here. The cooks need a new cook book or something! I ordered the salmon with steak Diane which is served with mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were cold salmon tasted weird (fishy taste) and I asked for medium rare and record fully cooked steak. My husband ordered this chicken dish that I thought was so delish, it was also served with cold flavorless mashed potatoes and flavorless asparagus. Honestly the food was worst then hospital food bland no flavor and cold! They were incompetent to listen to what I wanted and served me what they wanted me to have.  The manager asked if I wanted anything else but at this point I was so over this place and there food. Will most likely never be returning here."
Chris W.,"Hanford, CA",48,33,10,3.0,2/1/2017,Not starting off well.  Walk in 1130am on a Monday.  Need a table for 2 and I am told 15-20 minute wait?  The place is empty! Hostess tells me the high tops at the bar is available in a first come first serve.  But of course they were taken. Turned out the server we got was awesome.  We liked our food.  I have an bacon spinach mushroom omelet.  It was great.  The wife had the chicken parm sandwich.  She said it was Delilah.  Overall good food and great service from our waiter.  The hostess could have been a little more polite and courteous.
Angela J.,"Coarsegold, CA",0,18,2,5.0,3/25/2017,"Had dinner at cheesecake last night. The food was great like normal but the service was outstanding. Tabatha in the bar area was personable , attentive , and while we we not drinking , our meal , appetizers and service were top notch. Sometimes when you try to eat in a bar area of a restaurant the service suffers. Not here ! Great experience. Thank you"
Brandi G.,"Santa Maria, CA",65,158,56,4.0,7/20/2016,"Ordered the nachos. By the time I was done it didn't even look like I made a dent. They were really good.  We had a party of 8 around lunchtime and got taken care of in a timely manner. Also ordered the apple cinnamon cheesecake to go. I think it had a different name, but it was delicious. Waitress was nice and even gave us iced tea to go. The menu is ridiculously long. I feel sorry for the cooks. But everything was good."
K J.,"Visalia, CA",6,86,2,1.0,10/23/2017,"My meal was served cold.  Bow tie garlic pasta.  When brought to the attention of the server there was an apology and the meal was brought out again warm but with water not drained from the pasta so it mixed in with the milk.  The food runner who dropped off the pasta the second time literally did just that.  She did not even slow down long enough to offer or for me to ask for some fresh grated parmesan cheese.  The mushroom burger was gummy and made with mushrooms which tasted like they came from a can.  I asked our waitress for some fresh grated cheese so she brought the check.  Never came to refill beverages.  I noticed the next table was not served up to par either.  They had to ask for a to go box several times.  I did see a manager in the building and they were either not notified or did not care.  I am inclined to think it was he did not care as he was talking in a vacant area about personal matters with another employee.  I did order dessert and it was bad.  Taking the cheesecake making out of the building and doing buy ins has really ruined the whole experience.  When you pay $20 for a pasta dish that costs $5 to make and they insult you by serving it to you cold, and further insult you guest with canned mushrooms, you bet I will not be returning ever again!"
Pamela R.,"Fresno, CA",6,32,,3.0,2/11/2017,Hit or miss with this restaurant.  The staff seems to be very tired and overworked.  The guy at the bar is very nice and attentive though.  The food seems to be declining in freshness over the past few years.
Lisa C.,"Fresno, CA",92,48,92,4.0,8/16/2016,"Great food! No wait to be seated. Menu is huge so it took awhile to decide what to get. Luckily I've eaten here before so I just went for the steak, mash with green beans with house salad. That's boxed because I was saving myself for the banana cream cheesecake. I am so full I feel I'm probably going to need to be rolled out lol. Service was slow and my seat is dirty so I can't give 5 stars. Food was great!! Oh!! Lights are dimmed so if you are coming for dinner be prepared for that. People were having trouble reading the menu with the lighting .. Will be back!"
Maria G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,107,,4.0,8/8/2017,Still one of my favorite restaurant no matter what city its in. Attentive server. Buffalo appetizer was odd tasting.
Jennifer E.,"Hanford, CA",0,6,4,5.0,7/9/2016,"Came in today for Lunch, and to Celebrate our 4 year Anniversary. Our waitress was Elisabeth F., she was Wonderful and our steaks were out of this world. I ordered a Coulotte Steak, it's a spin of filet mignon and a New York strip, it was delicious. Try it out."
P. H.,"Fresno, CA",1,42,,5.0,8/1/2017,"I will always be a fan of Cheesecake Factory! My favorite dishes are the fried macaroni and cheese balls, their Cobb salad, Madeira Chicken plate, Thai lettuce wrap, and their traditional cheesecake. Plus I always have a good time with my gfs and I."
Ashton W.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/1/2017,"Cheesecake factory has always been consistent at every location I've been to. Just moved to the area, and it's good to see the staff and food meet my every expectation of the cheesecake factory!"
