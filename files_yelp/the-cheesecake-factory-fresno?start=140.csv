Gabriel L.,"Fremont, CA",30,166,201,4.0,11/10/2015,"I have no idea about floor service, but service at the bar has always been great and prompt.  Tonight I was bad, dietwise, and ordered the Pasta carbonara with chicken.  Nice and creamy sauce with smokyness coming from the ham.  Pasta was al dente (how it should be) and topped with lots of parmegianno regiano.  Excellent choice at this chain if accompanied by a glass or two of wine."
Mayrah A.,"Fresno, CA",1,7,4,3.0,2/14/2016,Came for a casual valentine's day dinner. As we ordered we got our bread. But only one small piece. (Weird) took a while for our food to arrive so it would have been nice to get more bread as i waited. But my waitress didn't come by.... so no bread for me I guess.  Just an empty bread basket  Food finally came. It was barley warm as if it had been sitting there a while.   Our dishes were served 5min apart instead of together.  Would I consider coming again? Yes.... but only if it's my only option.
Briannah B.,"Modesto, CA",3,19,,5.0,6/25/2017,"I went here for my anniversary and it was a good choice. The food was good and our server was seriously amazing. Her name was Jessica and she was super attentive, friendly, and really went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. Anywhere with exceptional service and food gets a 5 star rating from me!"
Susada C.,"Fresno, CA",54,109,213,2.0,5/19/2015,"Simply put, I'm not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I got food poisoning so bad after eating here on one occasion that I vowed to never return. After a few months, I reluctantly gave this place another shot since my friend wanted to try it. I came in ready to be disappointed and I was. The dishes here are 'eh' and I hate how close/small some of the tables are (you can literally touch the table next to you without having to try). And if you're like me, you'd think the cheesecakes here are WAY too rich and probably couldn't stand to take more than one bite. But yea, two stars for the complimentary bread and being able to get more bread lol."
Marc M.,"Kaneohe, HI",6,85,166,4.0,6/11/2016,Equally as great as all other Cheesecake Factory's Kale n quinoa salad was delicious as was Asian Chicken tacos Both healthy n fresh choices
KC S.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",14,30,56,4.0,5/31/2016,As always one of my very very favorite places!!!! Had three cheesecakes! Slices that is! And fried mac & cheese!!  And drinks! As usual all were wonderful!!
Angie G.,"Lemoore, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/17/2017,"Yum, yum, yum, yummy! Treated my Dad to Cheesecake Factory while visiting me in Ca! He loved the bread. As do I. He was surprised at so many options on the small plates, we chose the stuffed mushrooms and they were cooked to perfect texture and seasoned with the filling, just enough. He had to make a choice between some of his favorite classics. Spaghetti and meatballs, accommodated with extra sauce was divine and I got my usual Bang bang chicken and shrimp. Leftovers for tomorrow. Cherry cheesecake for Dad and Smores for me to take home. Oh and the Ultimate Margaritas were tasty, maybe could have used a little heavier pour. Our server Alissa R. was great. Super friendly, very attentive, knowledgeable and accommodating. She has a great personality that shines thru the details of the job. Request her station, you will walk away filled with food but merry in spirit."
Julia A.,"Fresno, CA",95,10,1,3.0,6/28/2017,"Meh. Good, but not the best. Service can range from excellent to terrible. As can the food. Avacado egg rolls are always amazing! And so is the bread mmmm"
Cory K.,"Oakhurst, CA",16,8,1,5.0,5/31/2016,For our 14 year anniversary we decided to go have desert at Cheesecake Factory. What a great time.  Big shout out to Shark for making it an especially memorable. Thanks and see you next time.
Justin H.,"Fresno, CA",78,4,,1.0,1/8/2017,I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. But this Saturday I went there and waited an hour to get seated which was fine because it was very busy. But when I got to my table and sat down my chair was wet. They had grabbed a chair from the outside patio in the rain and expected someone to sit in it. I told them they changed my chair but my dinner was ruined because I had wet pants and a wet shirt the whole dinner. Get it together please!!
Nikki V.,"Fresno, CA",2,16,14,4.0,6/6/2016,I love this place especially the bread and butter for starters while waiting for your meal. The service is fast and great and very attentive.
Mari B.,"Bend, OR",16,22,13,3.0,7/28/2015,"Too expensive for the atmosphere. It was date night, so no kids. We got seated next to a table inches from us. Trying to block out other people's conversations is really hard when they are literally a foot away. Plus our table was so small.  We spent $100 on just the two of us and that's including the tip. We had an appetizer, 2 alcoholic drinks each, 2 entrées and 1 cheesecake.  The worst part was when they started putting out the discounted menus ""happy hour"" right after we paid. If we had knew about that, we would have waited 30 minutes to get the discount. It was half price beers and appetizers. That would of cut our bill drastically.  The food was pretty good. My steak was cooked perfectly. The bread they give you before your meal was excellent. If I decide to come back here it will be during happy hour."
J P.,"San Antonio, TX",9,37,27,5.0,5/12/2016,"The happy hr food is a bargain, the pasta Vinci is my favorite plate and any type of cheesecake for dessert is great. Sit at the bar and have Jeremy take care of all of your requests, he's amazing and will take your order without writing it down, have it come out perfect, even if you have 5 substitutions like I always do, I try to get him to make a mistake but he never has in the long time I've frequented the place."
Ad G.,"CA, CA",0,237,406,5.0,9/23/2015,"Great food, friendly service, expensive, and huge menu. Finally found a cheesecake that was  not good Key Lime (should remove a star) lol"
Ryan G.,"Fresno, CA",16,21,1,3.0,10/12/2016,"Came for Brunch. Food was decent, but the Hash-browns looked like rocks from a kids playground. Much better locations not in Fresno. Eat at your own risk, avoid heavy dinner times or weekends at it takes forever to get a table and chances are your food will be jacked up , cold, or your waitress will have forgot she had your table."
Lauren B.,"Sacramento, CA",36,40,7,5.0,4/4/2016,"I had a take out order with a little glitch that was resolved in the most courteous and professional way. The staff (Joe) and management (Brian) are TOP rate, especially Bryssa who's customer service skills are first class. Thank you so much for going beyond expectations! YOU MADE MY DAY!!!"
Kevin C.,"Tipton, CA",1,30,2,4.0,5/2/2016,I went here for lunch with a friend and ordered the roadside sliders and rena's special. They were pretty good. The tomatoes on the rena's special were boy ripe. Our service was excellent and the food came out fast. Overview Food:4 Service:5 Ambience:5 Bang for your buck:3.5 TOTAL:4
Noelle N.,"Clovis, CA",0,30,2,4.0,11/4/2016,Great Food. A bit pricey but not too bad. Only thing I don't like is the ambience. I can't decide if I am in a nice restaurant or a cafeteria.
Aana S.,"Pomona, CA",10,44,15,2.0,4/10/2016,"My salad was really good. I always get the Tuna Titaki Salad whenever I go to the cheesecake factory. Our waitress was an absolute doll. She brought us all fresh bread when we requested it. I went with about 10 girlfriends for my friends Bachelorette party. The reason why I'm giving the restaurant 2 stars is because one of my girl friends found a slimy ""thing"" in her bbq chicken salad. My other friend ( who was sharing the exact same salad) found 2 cashew nuts in the salad as well! What of she had been allergic to nuts?!?! Two different kinds of substances in the same salad?!?! Yuck! We brought this to the attention to the waitress  (again, she was a really good waitress. I told think she has any control on what goes into salads). She notified the manager and he ended up comping that part of the meal. Good call on his part! This makes me kind of skeptical of this corporation considering the situation we experienced. I loved the cheesecake factory! But this freaked me out."
Kaye M.,"Clovis, CA",3,49,43,5.0,2/24/2016,"Cheesecake Factory. You go there & expect great food, great service, and of course great cheesecake! Every time I go there I've gotten all 3 of those things. If there is a long wait, I suggest opting for first available (inside or outside). They have heaters outside if it is cold. I honestly prefer outside when it is packed because it gets really loud inside. They give you bread to start out, which I love the brown bread they give you (it is similar to out backs brown bread). I have recently become addicted to the crispy crab wontons and have went back to just eat those (seriously). I usually order the hibachi steak & it is great. I have also tried the steak Diane & salmon combo and the steak Dianne and shrimp combo which are both good. Also save room for the cheesecake because you will probably be so full and only have room for one bite by the time dessert comes around."
