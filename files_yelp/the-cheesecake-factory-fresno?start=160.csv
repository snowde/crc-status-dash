Lynnette T.,"Coalinga, CA",33,29,77,4.0,4/15/2016,I'm not giving a perfect score the food was great but when we asked if he did we ask for a window there were multiple places where the windows were open and we were seated in a booth with out a window and told there weren't any issues we sat down and got our water and our drinks at a couple in a window Booth very upset I didn't get what I wanted was a window to watch the beautiful outside and there was nothing open on the patio
Lily A.,"Fresno, CA",3,30,24,4.0,5/31/2017,Food is good and there is a lot of dishes to choose from! My favorite is the cheesecake lol. Service is okay depending on the server but wait time is usually minimal. I recommend if you haven't tried before. This is a place I would go to on special occasions.
Sophie T.,"Fresno, CA",6,19,12,4.0,4/15/2016,"I love cheescake factory. I ordered a pasta with a spicy sauce( i dont remember the name), but it was really good. I ordered the lunch size, since obviously the dinner comes in a bigger plate. I also had te caramel cheescake which was BOMB. Their tropical martini is outstanding. Best drink i've ever had. The only problem i think was the service being slow. Everything else was good."
ルービー,"Fresno, CA",46,60,153,4.0,6/10/2015,"This place is alright. This place is pretty big, so the waiting time to be seated is short. Having said that, the parking space is not very good; but then again this is at the mall area, so it's understandable that the number of parking space is not convenient. Their service is good. There's nothing really to complain about. I've been here a couple times, and their service have been great. This time i had Spicy Chicken Chipotle. I loved it! It didnt taste spicy at all (i will order it extra spicy next time). I didnt finish it, so i boxed my left-over, and ate it the next day. I've gotta say that it tasted so much better on the next day. Haha. I loved it even more... i just wish it was spicy as I expected it to be."
Craig B.,"Antelope, CA",41,63,93,2.0,4/5/2016,The Cheesecake Factory has kind of gone downhill. Their menu appears that they're targeting a millennial. The staff acts like they're  there just to collect a paycheck and they forget who's really paying their paycheck. Not happy with them and it's sad to see because this was one of my favs... So bummed
D S.,"Fresno, CA",18,73,8,5.0,3/28/2016,"UPDATE for 2016: GREAT JOB!  The Cheesecake Factory got better at this location!   Service:  5 out of 5,  Perfecto! Food:  5 out of 5,  Mmmm Perfecto! Deco:  5 out 5, Perfecto! Lunch price is higher since my last review.  Figure more like $15-25 per person (+tip) because you just have to have some cheesecake!  All food was great!  Two people had Asian lettuce wrap tacos, 1 strawberry cheesecake, California Cheesesteak with sweet potato fries, and grilled steak medallions with no leftovers. ;-)"
Jenna X.,"Clovis, CA",113,81,93,5.0,6/26/2016,"I've always loved Cheesecake Factory! My go-to dishes are the Chicken & Shrimp Gumbo and Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane combo. The times I come here, it is usually very busy and no parking at all.. yet, I always ALWAYS get great servers and the food always come out deliciously amazing. I've never been disappointed here. The staffs are friendly and professional; atmosphere may be a little dark, depending where you are sitting, but it's very clean here.  I never order my Gumbo anywhere else... this is the only place I will only get it due to disappointment at other places. I highly recommend dining here. You won't go elsewhere for cheesecakes! Original strawberry is always safest to say to be the best, but try out the Red velvet and Lemon meringue are yummy as well"
Milan D.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/6/2017,"This place is the WORST place ever!!!!! Came here with a big of people, took forever for our order to be taken( I'd say more than 1 hour). When we finally got to order, the wait was even LONGER just to get the food itself. After such a long wait they forgot my and one other person food. They apologetically went to the other persona and offered him a free appetizer and were waiting on them hand and foot. As this is happening IM STILL waiting for my food!!!! Thy don't even look at me, until the waitress asked if I even ordered anything!!! I told I've been waiting forever and she runs to go get it. When it finally comes..... ITS COLD!!!!! It's looks like it's been sitting forever!! I asked for no peas In My plate and they still put them in!! She leaves and so I have to wait because I was not going to eat cold food. The manager comes to wait on the other person and I have to basically shout about my order because he's apparently deaf and can't hear anyone. They take my plate and it's late already I'm tired, I'm starving, and I've had enough. I ask for it to go, and they take forever once again.. They still made me pay for my plate and gave me a pathetic piece of cheesecake on them!!! When I finally get home I open the box.... it's same food from the plate,( which wasn't even hot and just got cold on the way home). It looked as if they stuck in the microwave and dumped it in the tray!! I was through with this place! I will never ever ever go back. Never go there! It's only bad service and horrible food! My real review is 0 even -1 stars!"
Blake K.,"Fort Bliss, TX",13,121,31,5.0,12/21/2015,This restaurant is fantastic. I have only been here one time as the price is higher than the mountains. But the food is excellent and service is superb. You certainly get what you pay for. Would recommend to anyone. One of those once a year restaurants.
Gilbert M.,"Selma, CA",29,141,447,2.0,11/10/2014,"Definitely had better, nothing special... at least they got the deserts right. Passed this place up many times, was in the mood to try a new restaurant and my expectations were high since I am a fanatic of cheesecake deserts. Little did I know I was going to get mediocre food. Complained to the manager for the bad service and the appetizer crab dip was horrible. He didn't care to hear what I had to say just nod this head and repeated, ""okay"" with a straight face multiple times. Will not return to eat anytime soon, at least they didn't mess up on the desert which was good. Other than that I'll pass. Rate this place 2.5"
Jasmine C.,"Fresno, CA",44,43,14,2.0,7/7/2016,The staff is great! Not a fan of the food. At first you get bread. The bread was really hard. And The avocado spring rolls were burnt. I don't understand why they'll serve burnt food.
Frank G.,"Visalia, CA",9,69,48,4.0,2/15/2017,"My Goodness the Cheesecake here is INCREDIBLE!!! This place is worthy of the name! The wife and I came here for Valentine's Day thinking ""we get there by 2"" no problem and I even called to be safe the day before and one of the servers said ""oh yeah we should be pretty dead by then."" Boy we're we both wrong! Lol. We showed up close to 3 and holy shit! This place was packed! Not even with just couples for Valentine's Day but families as well! We drove from Visalia ""not too bad of a drive"" but a 45 min drive to have a nice dinner and get some delicious Cheesecake. The wait time was an ""hour."" Lucky for us we didn't have to find parking because we took advantage of the Valet Parking! Tip: Do this if you don't wanna struggle with finding parking and it's only 7 bucks! A little more if you wanna be cool and give these awesome guys a tip! Note: We spent 11 bucks for less than 30 minutes of needed valet services lol. Like I said we were dumb and didn't think it was going to be an ""hour wait"" but it's Valentine's Day so it's not CCF's bad. We got in line for our 3 yes! ""3 types of cheesecake"" and one slice of delicious fudge cake! I got the key lime CC and my wife got the Tiramisu and the 30th Anniversary CC and we both shared the Cake. Oh I also got the Old Fashioned Lemonade! It was freakin amazing! Best Lemonade Ever! Besides Auntie Anne's and Hot Dog on a stick. We were very happy with the experience from the staff and the wait wasn't too long for our CC and cake. What took a little bit was they had to get my Lemonade. The wife and I can't wait to come back here to try the other types of CC and some food!"
Mike G.,"Clovis, CA",5,124,9,5.0,3/1/2016,"Just  finished dinner with my daughter for a late 17th birthday.  Got here Tuesday night about 6:45. Seated immediately although they were fairly busy.  Our server David, greated us and got our drink order.  He brought their great bread with butter. In no time our order came out.  She had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Pasta to carb-load for her track meet tomorrow.  I get to take the meatballs home!  I had the chicken piccata.  Both were very good and just the right amount. My sweetie did order a piece of the chocolate tower truffle cake for later. Great food and great service.  The only issue you might have is parking but we found a spot pretty close to the entrance. You can always valet park it."
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2910,14296,4.0,10/2/2014,"I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory since my first bite.  This particular branch has not been an exception. On our first visit, we dropped by for a late lunch which turned out to be an early dinner cause we stuffed ourselves.  Was the perfect time to go because there was no wait and plenty of tables available.  I ordered the Vegetable pizza with goat cheese, and it tasted terrific. The roasted vegetable pizza included roasted eggplant, red & yellow peppers, grilled onions, artichokes, kalamata olives, tomato, mozarella, and I requested goat cheese.  Again, I say that it was terrific!!  Just fabulous!  Too bad it is no longer on their menu!!   Argh!!!!! My better half ordered the Pasta Carbonara w/chicken, and she said that it was delicious as well.  We both had plenty of leftovers to enjoy for two more meals!  On another visit I ordered their Chile Relleno burger because they no longer had my favorite Monterey burger!!  That Chile Relleno burger was almost as good as the Monterey, but not quite!  Found out on my latest visit that they no longer make the Chile Relleno burger!!!  Argh!!!!!!!  What is going on!!! So, for the most recent visit I had to try something different because of the fact they no longer make my favorite entrees anymore.  My choice was called ""The Everything Pizza"".  Well, it was everything except nowhere close to being as good as their Vegetable Pizza with goat cheese from days gone by.  Oh well. My wife discovered a new favorite for herself.  She had a new menu item which was their Chicken Katsu!  It was the best that she has ever had.  I took one bite, and I would have to agree that it was very very good!!  Better than any other restaurant we have been to.  Hard to believe we had it in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Of course,  I always save room for cheesecake!!  Their cheesecakes may be too rich and sweet for many people, but that does not bother me one bit.  Yes, i must admit that I am a major sweet tooth!  Almost every cheesecake that I have tried at Cheesecake Factory has been yummy. but very expensive.  Most range from $7.50 to $7.95 a slice. Some of my favorites cheesecakes here are the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Fresh Banana Cream,  White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia,  and the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecakes!  Note that parking is a problem during peak hours so we try to avoid that time. Service has always been terrific.  Cleanliness is not an issue. My only issue with any Cheesecake Factory branch is that they keep deleting my favorite entrees from their menus!!!!"
Dora H.,"Fresno, CA",59,29,34,1.0,11/19/2015,Warning!!!!!It's not what it use to be!!! This place has gone down hill in the past 3 years. A lot of the meanu classics are gone. I use to frequently vist the restaurant when it first opened. The higher steps of service they use to have here are also gone. They have been replace with jaded under tipped servers . I feel there pain I also use to be a waitress . But treating people poorly is not going to help the situation.  In the past two years this has been third  time coming here. All three times have been a horrible experiences.  Unfortunately I will not be returning to this location. My money and my time I'm much more valuable to me. BJ's on the other side of the parking lot is a better alternative. :)
Joshua B.,"Visalia, CA",80,28,41,4.0,4/3/2016,"Good food. Had a group of 11 people and our waiter(Monique) was quick and remembered all of our orders and drinks. Nice setting outside and inside, very laid back restaurant. A couple of our orders were off like sauce on the side instead of on the Burger. But nothing to major. I had the Bacon, Dates , and Blue Cheese pizza. My goodness I can't even explain how amazing it was. But i will try just from the sweetness of the dates, saltiness of the Bacon, the rich spicy blue cheese was a perfect balance. After the pizza we went for dessert i had the red velvet cheesecake and it was great kind of tart but sweet as well. Another perfect balance."
Molly Y.,"Merced, CA",1,70,2,5.0,10/1/2016,"I love, love the Chicken Bellagio.  The restaurant is always busy but services is also always good.

Evvyy A.,"Turlock, CA",27,174,535,5.0,10/22/2015,"Not very busy on a Monday afternoon for lunch. Were greeted and sat down. Asked what to Drink,drinks on our table asap. Ordered. Food was on the table fast. Dessert too. Love the atmosphere. Love the decor. Waiter was friendly. Will be back when in Fresno."
Angela-Dale C.,"Fresno, CA",136,33,80,5.0,8/27/2016,"Absolutely always consistent. We come here all the time I just forget to Yelp in my own city. The ratings surprise me.  We have never had anything bad here. Last night ordered a blackened chicken and shrimp with rice, beans, pineapple and plantains. With a cup of clam chowder. I loved the clam chowder I ended up making that my meal with their incredible bread. It was more herby than I've ever had. Yum. And a cup was a bowl. Lol. The blackened dish was also incredible. I only had 3 bites since I was full from chowder. Husband ate it all.  It was very good. Then we wrapped up with singing happy birthday to my mother in law and their birthday presentation which was so nice. And we ordered a slice of our favorite cheesecake ... Banana with a side of hot fudge. The food is always big enough to share. We love it there."

The ratings surprise me.  We have never had anything bad here. Last night ordered a blackened chicken and shrimp with rice, beans, pineapple and plantains. With a cup of clam chowder. I loved the clam chowder I ended up making that my meal with their incredible bread. It was more herby than I've ever had. Yum. And a cup was a bowl. Lol. The blackened dish was also incredible. I only had 3 bites since I was full from chowder. Husband ate it all.  It was very good. Then we wrapped up with singing happy birthday to my mother in law and their birthday presentation which was so nice. And we ordered a slice of our favorite cheesecake ... Banana with a side of hot fudge. The food is always big enough to share. We love it there."
