Karen S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,219,49,5.0,2/24/2016,"It's not often that I receive stellar service at CCF were we should be treated with respect . I want to thank our server, Sayash G for her great service that night.  We went in on Valentine's Day with 4 children and two teenage parents.  I find it rather embarrassing to have to bring such young adults with their children because I know that their children could make a rather perfect evening dinner  go miserable. But because they are family, you just have to deal with it.  Luckily, Sayash had patience with our table and was extremely accommodating. She put my worries at ease as she came multiple times to check on our table and bring us anything that we needed.  She also had help from other server, but I didn't take down her name. Both of the ladies went beyond my expectations at making sure everything we ordered tasted right.  We did have an issue with the fried zucchini, portobello, and avocado fries. The fries had a horrible bitter taste. She quickly took it back and removed it from our bill. Sayash and the other server packed up our leftovers and bagged what we wanted to take home.  From beginning to the end of our dinner, we truly enjoyed our experience and I hope that this CCF continues to hire professional, caring servers who know how to provide excellent customer care.  Thank you Sayash."
Arthur G.,"Madera, CA",0,21,,4.0,4/9/2017,"Our first time visit to this particular Cheesecake Factory was a pleasant surprise. The Yelp site says the restaurant takes reservations but found out that this was not true. The service was outstanding. My wife's signature drink is a Cosmopolitan and I've seen her drink many across a wide range of restaurants. She remarked that her Cosmo was one of the best she's ever had--truly a huge compliment considering her expertise. Our zucchini appetizer was perfectly cooked. The oil was not old and the vegetable had a slight amount of crunch, making it delightful. My wife's fish and chips were cooked nicely but she found the fish to be cut too small making it feel mealy in her mouth. My shrimp entree had wonderful flavors as the basil, garlic, and lemon were nicely abundant! But the shrimp were overcooked and the dish could have been more properly salted. We will definitely go back!"
William D.,"Fresno, CA",4,7,,5.0,10/20/2016,Great place for an afternoon out. High ceilings and bright atmosphere. Plenty of food selections. Service is always great. Chocolate cheesecake is a family favorite. Passion Iced Tea can not be beat!
Ermila W.,"Fresno, CA",12,50,148,4.0,9/14/2015,"This place is def one of my favorites places to dine. the whole menu provides an array of so many great choices. The fresh bread is always an added perk. We had a couple Long Island and man.... I just wanted to hug the bartender! Two thumbs up! The lighting in the building is fairly dim, but I guess their conserving energy. Anyways this is a great place great service overall you won't be disappointed"
T M.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/22/2016,"Had a bad experience here.We ordered an appetizer, fish sticks and chicken sandwich for lunch.Got the appetizer and drinks right away.Our server kept on saying it was coming, until he stopped checking on us.We noticed that other  people were getting their food right away so we asked politely for a follow up from their busboy.Then the mgr or supervisor came and said it was coming.Well an hour later it did, which was delivered by their mgr or sup.I asked  what took so long (I was curious). He said they had to make a new one since they made the fish too crispy..??Not coming back here."
Tashara H.,"Fresno, CA",106,332,311,2.0,2/8/2013,"Disappointing. That's how I'd describe our last visit to this chain restaurant. With all chains, the food is pretty standard between the different locations. What distinguishes each location is the quality of service.   We went to celebrate an anniversary last month, and visited mid-week for dinner. Luckily, we didn't have to wait very long before we were seated. It took quite a while before anyone came to give us water or find out what we wanted to drink. And after our first server took our drink order, she told us her shift was ending, and we were assigned to a different server.   Maybe our mistake was ordering appetizers at the same time that we ordered our entrees.  About 20 minutes after we ordered, our entrees showed up.  I asked the server what happened to our appetizers. He looked at me for a moment and said he'd check on them. As the server started to walk away, I had to call him back and ask him to take back our entrees, and bring them to us after we had a chance to enjoy our appetizers. I don't know about you, but there is no excuse for bringing out entrees before appetizers. That's like forgetting to provide a salad course and then bringing it to the table after dessert.   It took at least another 15 minutes or so to get our appetizers.  The server did apologize for the mix up, but then came back less than five minutes after dropping off the appetizers and asked if we were ready for our entrees yet. REALLY?  It was almost as if he was inconvenienced by us calling him out on screwing up the order of our meal.  We weren't even half way done with the appetizer course, when he came back and asked us again.  I couldn't speak I was so frustrated (I have NO verbal filter when frustration swells), so thankfully my husband asked him to give us twenty minutes before bringing out the entrees. When the entrees did arrive, it was obvious they had been sitting under a heat lamp from the time they were sent back. The veggies were soggy (unusual for the Cheesecake Factory), and the crispy crust on the breaded chicken had softened. Other than that, the food was decent, but the borderline rude service really marred the experience.  I love this chain and will be back, but it will be hard for me to choose to return to the Fresno location."
Camille H.,"Fresno, CA",57,56,,3.0,9/14/2016,Nothing to rave home about. The food is somewhat mediocre. Cheesecake is good though.
Maira E.,"Fresno, CA",313,32,20,2.0,6/28/2016,If you want to eat a days worth of calories in one sitting then your at the right place . Got food poisoning from here
Lani M.,"Fresno, CA",23,62,104,4.0,4/8/2016,"I hate the fact that there is always a wait. That's probably why I don't come as much plus it's a little pricey sometimes. So for starters I always ask for the brown bread only because it is so delicious!  I haven't ate here to much but out of all the entree's I have ordered the chicken madeira is by far the best dish. The chicken is very flavorful & juicy, on top of the chicken is some delicious mushrooms, and it comes with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. All of it is delicious and honestly one of the best dishes I had. You can't go wrong with ordering that. For dessert my all time favorite is the red velvet cheesecake. Even though it's about 1300 calories, it's worth it sometimes to share a slice with your friends or if you're having a bad day than ""baby you deserve it!"" haha it's ok to indulge in some sweet red velvet cheesecake sometimes. But this is honestly my favorite cheesecake here besides the original strawberry cheesecake.  Hope this helps :-)"
Marlene H.,"Fresno, CA",4,9,,4.0,9/22/2016,Don't usually have to wait long to get in. Staff are generally on point. The prices are pretty steep. Always nice to have lunch when we go to the mall. I still keep paying lol
Brian D.,"Fresno, CA",48,16,7,5.0,7/22/2016,Great lunch at the bar.  Order from the small plates menu. Ahi tartare was great. Margarita flat bread perfect.  Great atmosphere.  Justin awesome bartender. Thanks
Jocelyn W.,"Arcadia, CA",7,55,12,1.0,7/6/2015,"We got take out from here on our trip from SF to LA. My veggie burger was HORRIBLE! It was bland and tasted old, not fresh at all. I gave it to my dog to eat, he wasn't even excited about it. They also gave me French fries instead of a salad and didn't include ketchup for the fries or burger. The beet salad was pretty good but nothing special. Glad I ordered that to share because that ended up being my dinner because the veg burger was literally inedible. My fiancé had some sort of GIANT burrito that was slathered in a forgettable concoction of sauce, cream, and other toppings. The thing was huge. So if your going for quantity over quality here you go. I don't get how these chain places stay so popular with their low quality, thoughtless food."
Rommel A.,"Bakersfield, CA",240,135,513,4.0,11/28/2015,Service has always been excellent here. The food comes out in ample time. The atmosphere is good. I have no complaints about this place. I would definitely come back here.
Josh M.,"Galt, CA",0,56,4,5.0,1/30/2017,"Great experience here! Was staying at the Best Western across the street, and this was conveniently across the street. Self parking is very difficult to find, however they do have plenty of spaces for ""to go"" orders, or valet parking. Beautiful restaurant inside and out! Staff was friendly, and food was quickly prepared and out the door. Tasty food without a huge bill."
Austin B.,"Fresno, CA",55,35,,4.0,7/3/2016,"Love this place for lunch and dinner, good with the family or with just the wifey. Cheesecake is awesome but they need to being back the pineapple upside down cheesecake."
Laura B.,"Fresno, CA",8,32,30,4.0,11/4/2015,The avocado egg rolls are delicious. We come here for appetizers and drinks for dinner. Open late. Good music on.
Donn D.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",87,115,86,4.0,9/27/2015,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Nothing great, but it also won't let you down on the dishes they serve. The mojito drink is delicious. I wish they had more of a variety on beer. It was really busy the day we dine-in, but our service was great and our expections were met with food being served with perfect timing."
McKenzie E.,"Clovis, CA",2,18,,1.0,7/14/2016,Why anyone would choose to go to cheesecake factory over any other local place is beyond me.
Ashli M.,"Taft, CA",48,15,6,4.0,7/13/2016,This was my first time eating here. I'm from out of town and we don't have one in Taft. It wasn't the best restaurant but it was good. I'm sure if I ordered something other than the Club I would have been more satisfied. The Mozzarella triangles were delicious as an appetizer. Now the cheesecake deserves 5 stars being that it was delicious. It should be since that's what they are best known for. The service was kind of slow but not too bad.
Shelley U.,"Madera, CA",6,32,,1.0,7/23/2015,"We were shopping at Fashion Fair and decided to go eat nearby.  The 3 of us had chicken dishes.  chicken romano, cajun chicken and spicy cashew chicken.  Oddly enough, all our chicken was breaded in the same dull, tasteless breading.  All 3 meals were poor substitutes for real flavor!  BLAND AND BORING!!! Service was great, the atmosphere was way above our noise level and the decor is a plastic faux Egyptian with scary ceiling lights!!!  The place was filled with glitzy fake people who probably dont even notice how boring the food is! Worst part......my Marine son in law was denied a military discount!!!   We wont go back!!! Nasty food gave all 3 of us headaches too!"
