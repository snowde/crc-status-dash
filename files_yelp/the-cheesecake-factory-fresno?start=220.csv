Raquel M.,"Fresno, CA",1,4,1,5.0,5/17/2016,They have awesome customer service and the food is sooooo gooood(: the Steak Diana is so delicious! Props to the cooks!
David P.,"Fresno, CA",1,19,1,1.0,10/31/2016,"Easily the worst cheesecake factory I've ever been to. Service has always been awful each time I have went. There is no way I'll ever return. Last time I went, they tried to seat us at a table that still had the dishes from the previous customers. Then it took 15 minutes for the waiter to bring drinks. After ordering they brought the main dishes before the appetizer. Instead of the manager apologizing he makes a smart ass remark and drops the food off. Apart from the service, the food was awful to top it all off. Nothing is fresh or flavorful. I've never had good service here ever, the employees are totally clueless how to work in a restaurant."
Lacey M.,"Fresno, CA",186,5,2,5.0,11/13/2015,Love Jeremy the bartender. He's so educated on the whole menu and so nice. I'll be sure to come back and see him again. Everything was on point.
Karla C.,"Madera, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/13/2016,"i went in few weeks ago, food was good as well as drinks. though what really got me mad was that i wasn't given my change back, the waitress decided to keep it as her tip. I looked for her but didn't find her. it wasn't much money, but i could've used that money for gas. i'm really upset! wish i could remember the waitress name."
Helene D.,"Paris, France",11,44,,4.0,5/28/2016,"What I love about the Cheesecake Factory is that whichever of their branches you go to - regardless of country - the food is always of similar taste and quality. The decor is the same. The service is the same. The (extensive) menu is the same! It's so comforting. The Fresno branch did not disappoint and my chicken tortilla dish with corn cakes was exceptionally tasty - although my margarita was a bit too sweet. In the middle of our California national parks road trip, this meal felt like a real treat."
Kristen S.,"Fresno, CA",73,237,124,3.0,4/17/2015,"I love this place, I really do.  The food is always amazing, drinks are always perfect.  But every time I've been there the wait is at least an hour. This place is huge!  I'm so sad with the wait time though.  If we ever get enough capital, we are opening another one."
Roberta A.,"Lemoore, CA",55,34,8,4.0,7/6/2015,Great food; great service! Courtney is the best. Thank you! So full we couldn't eat cheesecake:(
Deborah R.,"Fresno, CA",9,8,5,4.0,1/2/2015,Great breakfast for the FIRST day of the NEW YEAR! My friend and I were disappointed La Boulangerie was closed on New Year's Day and made the impromptu decision to try breakfast at Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Fair.  I am a huge fan of their brunch but had never tried the daily breakfast options!  We had a GREAT EXPERIENCE!  Mary G was our server (she was FABULOUS) and were also helped by Jay and Romero with bringing items to our table! We tried their espresso drink from the bakery and were VERY IMPRESSED - the Caramel Royale Macchiato and Cafe Mocha atthe suggestion of our server; they were both yummy! We tried the Chicken Chorizo & Avocado Omelette and Fiesta Burrito - everything was pretty good.  My bagel was pretty over toasted and hard but the rest of the meal was perfect. Definitely add CCF to our espresso / late breakfast list!
Lina T.,"Fresno, CA",28,54,878,4.0,1/5/2014,"Everything here is delicious. Nothing has disappointed so far. Service is friendly! I gave 4 stars because I remember one incident that I thought was a bit stupid. I remember when a waiter asked if there was an occasion, and we just said it was a friend's birthday. He brought out cheesecake at the end. We thought that was a nice gesture. Then he later asked who's tab to put it on. What?!  Usually when a place BRINGS something out for an occasion, it's free. If not, ASK us first. Give us the option. We weren't intending to get any cheesecake as we already bought a cake. Dumb. It just didn't look classy.   BJ Brewbouse gives you a free birthday pazookie! :D"
Janet O.,"Fresno, CA",0,4,2,1.0,5/14/2016,"Not the best experience, after hearing so many good things we decided to try it out for our sisters birthday, unfortunately it was a little pricey and the food was not the best missing flavor. Also, three of my family members woke up sick the next morning. On a side note the cheesecake was delicious for dessert. Probably won't be coming here to dine, maybe just for dessert."
J S.,"Lemoore, CA",46,5,,2.0,1/2/2017,"We went there for the third or fourth time last night. I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken that came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The Parmesan crust was mush and grease (think pools of grease on the plate), the potatoes had been over mixed so they were like glue and the green beans were over salted. I was super disappointed. We tried to get the waitress but no one came by throughout our meal. When she finally showed up to clear our plates, I let her know I wasn't happy with it. She offered to remake it but my family had already eaten so I didn't want to make them wait. I was hoping since I had only taken 2-3 bites of the potatoes and 2-3 bites of chicken she may take it off our bill but she charged us the full amount which was even more disappointing.  Between the poor service and subpar meal we will probably skip this place for dinner in the future. Unrelated to the food or service, it is very dark in the restaurant (barely can see the menu, bring a flashlight to read the menu) and the music is pretty loud so having a quiet conversation is out of the question."
Ric H.,"Madera, CA",830,132,428,3.0,10/28/2015,"Bring a flash light it's dark and makes it hard to see or read the menu, food is always good staff  friendly and a huge variety mex, Asian , pizza and of course cheese cake in just about every flavor"
TrinAndJess B.,"Modesto, CA",56,21,4,4.0,7/1/2015,"The food was fantastic, the cheese cake was so amazing. The environment is cute and welcoming however our waitstaff was not great. Our waiter was actually pretty awful. It literally took nearly 20 minutes for him to take our drink orders after we were seated. And we ordered your standard, ice teas and waters.  Then another 15 min for him to come back and take our meal orders. Once our food arrived it took an additional 10 min for my side salad.  The food was great, the service....not so much."
Whitney J.,"Fresno, CA",219,83,57,3.0,3/18/2015,"I had an etiquette teacher (yes my mother enrolled me in etiquette classes) once tell me that if a place specializes in a dish order that item off the menu.  This little bit of advice holds true for the cheesecake factory.  The best thing about the cheese cake factory is obviously the Cheese cake.  I am not a huge fan of the other foods but their okay.  Usually when I visit the cheese cake factory I will order some sort of appetizer nothing to heavy because I usually go for the dessert. When I order appetizers I usually get one of 3 things 1.) the chicken pots stickers, 2.) the avocado spring rolls or 3.) Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls.  My go to cheese cakes are the white chocolate chip macadamia nut and the carmel pecan turtle.   There's a definite pattern with the type  of food I order from the cheese cake factory.  Apparently all my appetizers are asian themed and all my desserts have carmel and nuts. However to me these are the best things on the menu. I did subtract a star because every single time I have visited the customer service has been off.  Either I get a hostess/host that doesn't seem to enjoy their life or a server that like abandons my table.   However I am a fiend for cheesecake and other health destroying desserts so I'll likely keep visiting even if it is only to get my cheesecake go!"
Faith W.,"Clovis, CA",213,10,24,5.0,5/26/2016,"Love all of their soups and their bread! The servers are all really nice, the only thing that bothers me is there are no reservations, but other than that the food is really good!"
Katie A.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,,2.0,5/4/2016,"The food is pretty good...  Everytime I am here the wait is at least 40 minutes.  On my last experience, I was celebrating a birthday and the fire alarm went off. The fire department came and it took them at least 2 hours to turn the flashing strobe light off. There was no fire, it was just a false wire. The manager came over after we asked to speak with him, and was extremely rude and dismissive, and said there was nothing he could do. We asked to move outside thinking it would be better and he said we just had to deal with it because the fire department had to check everything before they left and there was nothing they could do about the flashing lights. With a guest at our table with a seizure disorder, he still would not make any accommodations to help us.  Out waitress brought us bread and is was cold and stale. We waited 30 minutes for new bread and it was still cold. Our dinner took an hour to come out and it wasn't even busy since everyone left from the FALSE fire alarm.  I am disappointed EVERY time I come here."
A G.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,30,9,3.0,3/6/2016,"Not as good as many of the other throughout CA. It took 40 minutes to even get our order taken and an additional 30 minutes to get an appetizer, and 30 more minutes to get entrees. Two out of our four meals were wrong. The waitress, even after repeating our order twice, put the wrong food order into the kitchen. The manager stopped by once to apologize and offer my child the fries she ordered as compensation to having to wait for her food. He didn't even show his face and avoided us when seeing the order had been so messed up. We weren't looking for anything free but as paying customers we expected better. This Cheesecake Factory dropped the ball. Not that they care, there's limited great customer service in Fresno, so why make the effort?"
Aaron V.,"Clovis, CA",78,9,1,4.0,6/28/2015,"This is one of the few chains that I do like. They have a huge menu and with a lot of variety. The avocado egg roll appetizer and the sweet corn tamales appetizer are delicious. I always find it hard to break away from the Chipotle pasta, but when I do, I get the herb crusted salmon with asparagus and mash potatoes! I'm never disappointed in the food, but sometimes the service is a little off(not often, but enough for me to give this place a 4 star."
Jess D.,"Clovis, CA",2,11,,1.0,6/28/2015,"Had food poisoning TWICE from this place! Chef can not cook chicken to save his life. Only went back second time due to a friends request.  Food is not very good. Sloppy, over seasoned and obviously not cooked correctly. There are too many items on the menu, which tells you they specialize is nothing other than cheese cake.  Stick to making cheesecake people.  Service is good, waitresses there are nice and attentive as expected."
Stephanie K.,"Richmond, VA",177,98,104,5.0,3/26/2014,"This place drips with the term ""high class"". From the building itself to the expertly prepared foods, it was all professionally and well put together. My grandma got the appetizer ceaser salad and boy for a size small, it was a lot! My boyfriend got cashew chicken since it was supposed to be ""very spicy"". He said it was a little to heavily sauced and it wasn't spicy at all, almost sweet. Other than that though he thought it was fantastic. I got the bang bang chicken, essentially curry chicken. Although I eat this dish all the time, I still loved it and the sauce was very yummy! The bill was more expensive than expected, but that comes with territory for a higher end place than your average. If you're willing to shell out the extra bucks for fine dining, this place won't let you down!"
