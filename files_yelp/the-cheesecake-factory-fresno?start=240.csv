Jess R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/23/2017,"Went to this location yesterday since our family was in Fresno for my sibling's graduation and we decided to go celebrate and have dinner here. Of course we did have a big party of 19 people which I totally understand is going to be a long wait. So my mom goes in to put our party's name on the list and they tell her it would be a 45 minute wait; not too bad for a party as big as ours. An hour goes by and we still haven't been buzzed to be seated so I walk in and ask the hostess how much longer it would be and she couldn't give me an exact time and said she'd have to ask her manager. We continue to wait about another 15 minutes and get buzzed in so they can tell us it would be another 30-45 minutes because they were waiting for tables to clear out. At this point I'm irritated because we've just waited for over an hour. We walk back outside to wait. A member of our party checks in again with them a while later and the manager had the nerve to tell him ""you've only been waiting an hour and 15 minutes."" ONLY AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES???!!!! Really?? like it was nothing. The manager said it would be a 2 hour wait. At this point we all decided to leave and couldn't believe the wait and service. This location's customer service is horrible! Worst cheesecake location I've been too. I love Cheesecake Factory and won't take it out on the chain, but this location needs to learn how to be a little more courteous along with estimating their time better. It would've been nice to know from the beginning that it would be a 2 hour wait (not 45 minutes) because then we could've made our decision to go somewhere else at that moment. Plus, we were a 2 hour drive from home! So horrible. I'll stick to the so cal locations."
Carol M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,20,12,4.0,1/3/2016,"My husband, daughter, and two grandkids and I went here for my birthday, and the food was very good; however, I want to compliment our waiter, Joshua J., for his service, which was the finest we've had anywhere--even in very fine restaurants.  We had a cranky, hungry, four-year-old, and Joshua was very prompt in bringing us bread, water, and drinks, taking our order, checking up on us periodically without being intrusive, and being very friendly and helpful.  We went on a very busy Saturday night, and we were all very impressed with the attention he gave us.  I usually tip 15% for service, but he got 20%!"
Jeff C.,"Oakhurst, CA",25,214,14,3.0,4/12/2015,First time at the Cheesecake Factory. They were pretty busy for a Friday lunch crowd. Service was excellent and we were seated right away on the patio. My wife had the chicken salad sandwich which was okay. The bread seemed a little stale. I had the Chinese chicken salad. The portion was large which is good for me because I like to eat. The salad was fresh and I liked the dressing. The rice sticks on top of the salad were prepared perfectly but there were way to many. Completely covered the salad. The salad could have been excellent except the chicken was very dry. Did not have dessert but maybe next time this is a dessert stop.
DeMarion T.,"Lemoore, CA",137,2,,1.0,3/27/2016,This place is just awful! I hate it! Every single time I come here the silverware is dirty and the floors are dirty. My wife complains to the hostess about the dirty floors and the hostess gets mad. Our table didn't have any forks but luckily the waitress saved the day with her great service. Thanks Rhonda!
Savannah G.,"Clovis, CA",10,86,60,3.0,7/19/2013,"I heard this place was great so I was excited to try it. It wasn't what I expected though. Not only was the wait long (I made reservations in advance) but the bread on my sandwich was a little too burned (similar quality to panera where I never get it burned). The lighting was so dim that I struggled to read the menu and then I ordered an $8 slice of cheesecake and found it to be much too sweet. Maybe others would have enjoyed it but when it comes to cheesecake too much sugar isn't a good thing. I wasn't pleased and this was my first time there so I will not be going back anytime soon. I'll admit, I do appreciate that they have a large menu, there's something in there for everyone. Every single dish is like 2000 calories (seriously) so first scan the skinnylicious menu. It's not the worst place and in my book neither is it the best. For that price though I'm better off going to another restaurant."
Amanda M.,"Bakersfield, CA",416,163,53,3.0,11/16/2014,"Meh... Nothing to write home about. The service was nothing special , neither was my salmon. I was a little disappointed today. :/"
Christopher B.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,62,9,1.0,11/20/2015,"We have come here with groups in the past and never had a problem, but tonight, with a group of 18 (16 high school students and 2 teachers), after being told it would be 1.5h and given a pager, when we returned the MANAGER told us it would be another hour and a half. He had a variety of stories--we didn't have our whole party there when we checked in, he had to give the tables away, he was working on getting our party in, etc. NO THANK YOU CHEESECAKE FACTORY! This will be remembered by an otherwise loyal customer."
Hana M.,"Fresno, CA",4,56,31,2.0,2/2/2016,"My husband & I came here for a brief get-away lunch...well it ended up as a 2-2 1/2 hour lunch rather than a brief one. We sat ourselves at the bar to get a seat right away, we didn't care for the 30 minutes wait time for a table (by the way, Sunday after church, lunch time, is the worst time to come in!!). Our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter was very forth-coming & pleasant. He gave us service right away & served my husband his drink immediately. We ordered lunch specials & had a basket of bread as we waited for our meal.  Ok...here is the run down: we arrived around 1:30 p.m. Sat at the bar & placed our order by 1:40 p.m. I was watching the Chicago Bulls vs. LA Clippers game, 3rd quarter in. I'm enjoying the moment with my husband as the time flies, making plans for vacations and so forth. ********* So its the end of the game (the Clippers won by the way), we had our second basket of bread & butter. My husband had to limit himself with a second beer, since he was driving and its 3:00 p.m. (-_-) ONE HOUR AND SOMETHING MINUTES FOR OUR FOOD. Wait, let me be honest because I'm rounding off the time, maybe it was 2:58p.m. for our food to actually arrive.  I do have to point out that the bartender/waiter was courteous & kept his actions professional, but it doesn't justify why our food took forever to come out! You would think we would get a discounted price on our meal...nope. ********* As for the meal overall: I ordered the ""Pasta Shrimp & Sausage"" plate, my favorite! My twist into this meal is I prefer angel hair pasta instead of the rigatoni that it comes with. Why you may ask; well I like the texture of the angel hair & I feel like the rigatoni takes away focus of the meal--which I believe the shrimp & sausage should be the main highlight of the plate. And yes, I've ordered this before so I know what I am getting myself into. Usually with this plate, the meal is super hot to eat right away & the steam is literally rising from the sauce. Well, it wasn't--I was able to scarf half of this plate down by 3:15 p.m. Same goes for my husband, he ate his macaroni burger, practically in one gulp. The sweet potato fries wasn't fresh from the fryer and it didn't have its usual crisp. So the food, honestly, for the price we paid, was not worth it at all.  ******** Cheesecake: ordered the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. This is somewhat of a German chocolate cake wannabe. Not too bad and it was worth the try, but will not order again. Yes, we had our mind set on a cheesecake in the middle of our 1 hr and something minutes wait; so this was ordered right after our meal. From the variety I have had, this cheesecake doesn't rank up into the top 10 category.  ******** The incident: yes, something happened overall this unsatisfactory visit. So yes we're human, we all make mistakes. Another waiter assisted us while our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter stepped away for a few minutes. Well this waiter in particular, attended to us & happened to assist us with boxing away my pasta. He made a light conversation but he didn't realize he wasn't placing the pasta into the take-home box, rather than the bar counter top. Let me rephrase that: he was placing the pasta on top of the bar counter-top instead of the take-home box...*****let that sink in*****yes, I know, it was a mistake. My husband and I have a great sense of humor...so we laughed it off--this was not intentional, it was an honest mistake. I felt bad for the waiter, but he did offer a lunch-size special of the pasta to be taken home. I felt he was embarrassed for his actions (since he scooped up the pasta and didn't clean up the remainder of the sauce on the counter-top, and continued serving the rest of the bar). As soon as our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter returned, the other waiter disappeared.  ******** The take-home product: yes I received my meal just how I wanted--with angel hair. But as I dug into it the next day, I noticed there was some rigatoni pasta noodles mixed in. No big deal but for such a high class restaurant, you would think something as simple as this shouldn't happen.  ******** The reasoning behind the two stars:  *I didn't take a star off w/the 2nd waiter who helped us because it was a mistake, even though we waited another 20 mins for the take-home pasta.* 1. First star was taken off due to the wait-time of our food. It wasn't our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter's fault because there are other servers that could have caught this.  2. Second star was taken off due to the quality of our food. Please see the above details.  3. Third star was taken off due to the take-home product. It wasn't made from the chef's heart. Going to a restaurant like this and paying the prices we pay for the outcome to be shitty, makes me wonder if the chef's heart was in the right place to cook this food for me.  Honestly...we should've went to Olive Garden for the overall experience. So literally Cheesecake Factory, I've seen better out of this place!!"
Viv M.,"Ceres, CA",4,87,86,4.0,3/15/2015,I always enjoy coming here. My favorite dish is the jumbalaya pasta. Their pomegranate mojito is soo good and their avocado egg rolls are  yummy.  Great service (:
Dee D.,"Madera, CA",1,41,13,3.0,1/7/2016,"I just want to know why is it always cold in there, and why is it always so dark? It's not like Cheese Cake Factory is a sheik hot spot joint located in a downtown of some city. It's in a mall! It's a family restaurant! Lol!"
Ivy R.,"Fresno, CA",129,24,2,1.0,9/23/2016,"Was here last night and had the salmon kale salad. Not sure if was just poorly prepped, but I wound up sick and had to leave my friends there early. Went home and threw up everything! I've been to this restaurant before and haven't had issues until now. I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."
Jamie N.,"Fresno, CA",0,25,6,3.0,1/14/2015,"I would come here again for the food, but probably not the service.  The hostess who greeted us at the door walked away, disappeared and didn't say anything...While we were standing by the front door waiting to be seated. Five minutes later she appears and apologizes...very strange. My favorite item on the menu which was a deep fried ahi tuna roll appetizer was discontinued....We needed extra straws and napkins with our meal and practically had to scream to get them. The waitress was very short and didn't smile very much... Besides the service, the food was delicious, we ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps and large ""everything"" pizza."
Mary A.,"Clovis, CA",0,45,108,5.0,3/1/2015,I had the chicken Costaletta.  Delicious thin breaded chicken in a lemon burre Blanc with rustic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Perfectly cooked to a golden crisp and oh so delicious. My husband had the Jambalaya with pasta. Both dishes were quite large and I have enough for two more meals. The service was slow but the manager stepped up and took good care of us.
Michelle H.,"Bakersfield, CA",206,286,218,5.0,9/12/2014,"Had to make it out here for a quick work trip, so I threw the sis-in-law in the car and once mission completed we landed here. Perfect place to have a lil girl time.  But, you don't normally come here if counting calories was your thing, but we were surprised to find a ""lighter"" menu and everything on it sounded delish. The sis-in-law ordered a turkey burger and was thoroughly impressed, she had to ask the waiter what they seasoned it with because she liked it so much.  Me and turkey burgers?  Well, not so much.  I opted for the Fried chicken and mashed potatoes with homemade biscuit.  OH yEaH!!! All I got to say is....winner winner chicken dinner!"
Brandon L.,"Fresno, CA",59,3,,1.0,8/27/2015,"Waitress tried to call our table out for being bad tippers, pulling out the cash and waiving it at us. Once our table pointed out how much cash was paid and how poorly our waitresses was at math, she apologized and walked away. I know things are electronic but she didn't even bring back the correct change after giving her $100. Older lady at bar.... Rude and will having me a steering away from there for now on. She was paid 20% but tips are earned not a guarantee."
Cat R.,"Burlingame, CA",70,92,11,2.0,1/8/2015,"I got the shepherds pie and it was actually good! My boyfriend got some burger and sweet potato fries and even though we were seated as close to the kitchen as possible, they didnt bring the fries our until 10 minutes later and the food was cold by then! He complained to the manager and he gave us a free piece of cheesecake. My dad ordered the same thing and his regular fries were served with his food on time...? What gives? Atmosphere was VERY loud and so was the bizarre music. Im down for music but this isnt a night club. Lol. Not my style of restaurant.  Thanks for the free cake"
Darla S.,"Woodlake, CA",14,22,8,4.0,7/19/2014,"Hubby and I went for a late night, quiet meal. The food was excellent (I had the Moroccan Chicken) and our waiter was very nice. The place is lovely and everyone we spoke to, with the exception of the hostess, was extremely friendly. The portions are large, the bread basket was warm and tasty. There was too much food in the entrees to contemplate dessert but, we did decide to take one home for the family. Our server was very helpful with selection and getting it packaged up for us. (We took home a lemon cheesecake and it was a hot with everyone!) My main complaints, aside from the rude hostess, would be the menu has so any selections it's difficult to remember what you read by the time you get to the end. And, on the night we visited, the restaurant was incredibly dark! Not sure why but it was impossible to read the menu print in the dark and I couldn't see my food.  I will definitely return but the prices are high, so it would have to be a special occasion."
Susie Q.,"Fresno, CA",1,38,2,3.0,2/12/2016,"So first off let me say, I wish there was a different button for food and one for customer service because sometimes they don't go hand in hand!  So we finally tried this place for the first time, especially after hearing all the hype. Well, let's start with the food---reason why they got a 3/5 from me. The stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer were delicious, great seasoning. For the lunch pasta price, holy cow that was a huge portion, I had the shrimp and sausage pasta. It was ok, nothing out of this world, and it failed to impress. My husband's herb-encrusted chicken was alright, he enjoyed it, the mashed potatoes were plain, lacked seasoning, but the asparagus was delicious and very flavorful. I also ordered sweet potato fries with the yummy sauce on the side, and those were so yummy!! For dessert, we got the original cheesecake, and I was really looking forward to that first bite because I fugured it would be magical, but it was disappointing. For being named after cheesecake, I really expected more. Honestly, my mom makes better cheesecake.  Now on to customer service, that I give them a 5/5. Super courteous, each step was perfect--from the phone to the pick up. If you don't want to get out of your car, then use curbside. Super easy and they made sure to accommodate us in every way possible.  Nothing was left out, including bread & butter."
Carrie R.,"Dinuba, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/13/2016,"Went here for lunch to celebrate my moms birthday. Less than 5 minutes after we walked in the door we were seated. We received our drinks shortly after. The waitress made sure the drinks were refilled without having to ask. The restaurant was very busy but we received our food in a good time. I ordered the half almond chicken sandwich which comes with salad and soup. It is a lot of food. I thought it would be a small lunch but it was a regular size bowl soup and large salad. The soup was baked potato. Everything was great, absolutely no complaints. This is the second time coming for lunch and had great experiences both times. We tried the salted caramel and the lemon meringue cheesecakes. My favorite was the lemon. I was just disappointed we were still shopping so I couldn't bring home a cheesecake for the family."
Yvette G.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,1,5.0,3/3/2016,"Our experiences have been pleasant and our orders have been accurate. We visit at least once a month and are seating immediately (after 9pm). Andrew is such an amazing waiter. Hes very friendly, attentive, and polite. The food is tasty, brought to our table hot, and the atmosphere and ambience is relaxing."

The sis-in-law ordered a turkey burger and was thoroughly impressed, she had to ask the waiter what they seasoned it with because she liked it so much.  Me and turkey burgers?  Well, not so much.  I opted for the Fried chicken and mashed potatoes with homemade biscuit.  OH yEaH!!! All I got to say is....winner winner chicken dinner!"
Brandon L.,"Fresno, United States",59,3,,1.0,27/8/2015,"Waitress tried to call our table out for being bad tippers, pulling out the cash and waiving it at us. Once our table pointed out how much cash was paid and how poorly our waitresses was at math, she apologized and walked away. I know things are electronic but she didn't even bring back the correct change after giving her $100. Older lady at bar.... Rude and will having me a steering away from there for now on. She was paid 20% but tips are earned not a guarantee."
Cat R.,"Burlingame, United States",70,92,11,2.0,8/1/2015,"I got the shepherds pie and it was actually good! My boyfriend got some burger and sweet potato fries and even though we were seated as close to the kitchen as possible, they didnt bring the fries our until 10 minutes later and the food was cold by then! He complained to the manager and he gave us a free piece of cheesecake. My dad ordered the same thing and his regular fries were served with his food on time...? What gives? Atmosphere was VERY loud and so was the bizarre music. Im down for music but this isnt a night club. Lol. Not my style of restaurant.  Thanks for the free cake"
Darla S.,"Woodlake, United States",14,22,8,4.0,19/7/2014,"Hubby and I went for a late night, quiet meal. The food was excellent (I had the Moroccan Chicken) and our waiter was very nice. The place is lovely and everyone we spoke to, with the exception of the hostess, was extremely friendly. The portions are large, the bread basket was warm and tasty. There was too much food in the entrees to contemplate dessert but, we did decide to take one home for the family. Our server was very helpful with selection and getting it packaged up for us. (We took home a lemon cheesecake and it was a hot with everyone!) My main complaints, aside from the rude hostess, would be the menu has so any selections it's difficult to remember what you read by the time you get to the end. And, on the night we visited, the restaurant was incredibly dark! Not sure why but it was impossible to read the menu print in the dark and I couldn't see my food.  I will definitely return but the prices are high, so it would have to be a special occasion."
Susie Q.,"Fresno, United States",1,38,2,3.0,12/2/2016,"So first off let me say, I wish there was a different button for food and one for customer service because sometimes they don't go hand in hand!  So we finally tried this place for the first time, especially after hearing all the hype. Well, let's start with the food---reason why they got a 3/5 from me. The stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer were delicious, great seasoning. For the lunch pasta price, holy cow that was a huge portion, I had the shrimp and sausage pasta. It was ok, nothing out of this world, and it failed to impress. My husband's herb-encrusted chicken was alright, he enjoyed it, the mashed potatoes were plain, lacked seasoning, but the asparagus was delicious and very flavorful. I also ordered sweet potato fries with the yummy sauce on the side, and those were so yummy!! For dessert, we got the original cheesecake, and I was really looking forward to that first bite because I fugured it would be magical, but it was disappointing. For being named after cheesecake, I really expected more. Honestly, my mom makes better cheesecake.  Now on to customer service, that I give them a 5/5. Super courteous, each step was perfect--from the phone to the pick up. If you don't want to get out of your car, then use curbside. Super easy and they made sure to accommodate us in every way possible.  Nothing was left out, including bread & butter."
Carrie R.,"Dinuba, United States",0,1,,4.0,13/8/2016,"Went here for lunch to celebrate my moms birthday. Less than 5 minutes after we walked in the door we were seated. We received our drinks shortly after. The waitress made sure the drinks were refilled without having to ask. The restaurant was very busy but we received our food in a good time. I ordered the half almond chicken sandwich which comes with salad and soup. It is a lot of food. I thought it would be a small lunch but it was a regular size bowl soup and large salad. The soup was baked potato. Everything was great, absolutely no complaints. This is the second time coming for lunch and had great experiences both times. We tried the salted caramel and the lemon meringue cheesecakes. My favorite was the lemon. I was just disappointed we were still shopping so I couldn't bring home a cheesecake for the family."
Yvette G.,"Fresno, United States",0,5,1,5.0,3/3/2016,"Our experiences have been pleasant and our orders have been accurate. We visit at least once a month and are seating immediately (after 9pm). Andrew is such an amazing waiter. Hes very friendly, attentive, and polite. The food is tasty, brought to our table hot, and the atmosphere and ambience is relaxing."
