Richy T.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,4,2,2.0,10/12/2014,The food is definitely not what it used to be. I will pretty much pay any amount for food. It just has to be good. The cheesecake is killer the food is not horrible.  It's just not what it once was and if your going to bend me over it better be good. I'm sure this place is another victim of corporate bullshit where food quality suffers. Cheesecake only from here on out. Food.....bland Service ......good Coors light.......good
Crystal M.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",7,14,,5.0,1/9/2016,"Came here twice already . We moved here from SLO and we are disappointed with the restaurants around this area - all franchised and don't care, not healthy either. Anyway the two times I've been here I've had great service and the food was awesome better than any other place around here. I also like the atmosphere of this place, reminds that you're not in fresNO !"
Umar R.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",874,622,7492,5.0,6/15/2014,"About a week after I was grotesquely disappointed with this chain, I conveyed my disappointment to the regional manager in their HQ and I was contacted by phone and by mail. They gave me a $50 dollar gift card to try the restaurant for the second time, and I gave it a go.  I must say on my second visit I was more impressed, the servers was as for the usual very professional, got my drinks, then dropped off some warm bread to be savored with these tasty heavily butter. I enjoyed having that as a starter. I also must add I love the white cloth instead of paper napkins, a very elegant touch. I then ordered the orange chicken, and when I did get it, it was really delicious and the portions were amazing. It was only 12 dollars for lunch portion, which was amazing. My mum and my sister ordered the santa fe salad and my sister the shrimp bistro pasta, both were amazing, and this time for dessert we ordered dessert and got it correctly and it was delicious, it was the chocolate cheesecake. In addition, we order some to take out, which includes the strawberry cheesecake, the orange chicken and the burger. It was all in the bag this time, and it tasted amazing and was very nicely packaged.  I am impressed with the cheesecake factory's improvement and would continue coming here as a result. Job well done. Keep it up."
Richard S.,"Fresno, CA",0,7,1,2.0,7/30/2014,"I have eaten here a number of times and always thoroughly enjoyed the food. However, for the price they charge, one would expect adjacent tables to be separated by more than 12 inches. The last two times I have taken wife here for a nice dinner we have essentially sat with strangers due to the close proximity of the tables. We were able to clearly hear their conversation, they were not speaking loud, and they were in turn able to hear ours. Sadly, the acoustics are terrible inside. It is so loud it might as well be a sports bar. In the future I will be taking my business two buildings East to B.J.'s brewhouse where I am not required to eat with strangers and it is slightly quieter."
Lisa L.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/10/2015,"I've been meaning to give this place a rating, now I have the chance to.  I went for a friend's birthday and was not impressed with their service. Although we were seated promptly after the birthday girl arrived, our entrees took more than it should have to get to us. Groups that came in at a later time were having their foods before us while we looked around waiting for ours. After an hour and a half wait, we finally see our appetizers and entrees ALL come in at the same time. We were already tired and ready to go home. I've lost my appetite by then.  Overall, food was okay, service needs to be put in check. Will probably give this place another try if another birthday will be happening here, otherwise I will dine elsewhere."
Delilah D.,"Fresno, CA",4,18,,3.0,12/12/2015,"The service here (besides once or twice) has been outstanding and accommodating. I enjoy the atmosphere, it is nice and relaxing and a great place for a date. I have enjoyed many of the offerings on the menu, besides once. Which was my latest experience. I ordered orange chicken (at a white washed place, I hear ya). It was good considering it was the Cheesecake Factory. But I asked extra EXTRA EXTRA spicy.... Yet I saw one (yep, exactly one) chili flake.  This has happened to me anytime I asked for extra spicy. I'm not even sure if they add any extra spice, or if they ignore the request. The cheesecake here is gross, they make it with sour cream which adds an off putting sour taste to the cheesecake. Try needa cheesecake right down the street instead."
Leslie C.,"Visalia, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/16/2016,When you can't order a piece of cheesecake to go because the computers are down its a fail. No way to take cash; literally blank stares from the wait staff. Find a way to serve your customers people!!
Giovanni L.,"Stockton, CA",1,13,3,4.0,1/9/2015,"Just went to the Cheesecake Factory Fresno for the first time.  It was my second choice after the long line at my first stop BJ's brewery.  In retrospect it should of been my first choice.   What we ordered.  A bottle of house cab, calamari appetizer.   She had herb encrusted salmon ( came with asparagus and mashed potatoes)  I order steak Diane (mash potatoes only) and we finished sharing a slice of red velvet cheesecake.  Everything was VERY delicious and excellent service too.  Highly  recommend. Enjoy.($118 O.T.D.)"
Caty V.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",9,26,1,4.0,11/17/2014,"I have been going here for a couple of years now. Now I have not been recently I can tell you when I have gone that it is amazing and delicious! Now I normally go with my sister and as a cheaper alternative we do appetizers and just split them. It works for us really well.  Something we love are the Factory Nachos. Now they have recently change them and added this red sauce and other stuff, we just omit that and keep with the good ole stuff. Now only bad thing is we normally have to get extra toppings over everything because it's kind of skimpy but if you are okay with just chips and little toppings that's perfect. We also love the avocado egg rolls and the Mac and Cheese balls.  We have tried there alcoholic drinks here, they are okay. Super expensive for very little drink. Go to a bar if you want a drink. They do have a wonderful peach smoothie!  All in all this place really never disappoints. I just wish they wouldn't have changed there nachos."
Samm C.,"Clovis, CA",4,2,,3.0,9/3/2015,The food was amazing but our server was really rude when we asked for our deserts to go and she never asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks.
Christina G.,"Fresno, CA",9,45,3,5.0,10/6/2015,"I have been here numerous times and have always enjoyed my experience. But today's visit was by far the best. Our waiter Matthew was awesome! We ordered the zucchini sticks, a sausage and ricotta flatbread, and a tomato and mozzarella flatbread. The flatbreads were so flavorful and delicious. Can not wait to order that again! Anytime our bread basket was empty we didn't have to ask for more, Matthew kept it full. We ordered the red velvet cheesecake and the salted caramel cheesecake. Delicious! We will definitely be requesting Matthew at our next visit. Never have we had such amazing service anywhere as we did with Matthew!"
Kaylee G.,"Fresno, CA",8,20,6,5.0,10/6/2015,"For starters, you can't go wrong with the menu! It's huge, and it's almost too hard to pick just one thing. The bread is so addictive and you can always ask for more. I was lucky to get a server named Matthew who was the best! Super nice, refilled the bread basket before we even asked, very quick, super friendly, and all around awesome! He even offered to bring us the cheese cake first to try it out (which was perfect since that's what I wanted to do anyways!) The food was amazing! I have never been disappointed here, and the service is always wonderful"
Nathan A.,"Fresno, CA",55,6,,5.0,7/24/2015,"I had a great time. Moderate to no wait for two people when it isn't busy. Noise level is medium, as expected from a family restaurant. The food was awesome. I recommend the bacon bacon cheeseburger. Good stuff. But best of all was that my friend and I had an amazing waitress named Tara. She was very enthusiastic and great at her job."
Greg M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,21,3,2.0,1/28/2016,Service was great but myself and partner both got food poisoning. We both had chicken dishes and fell deathly ill within hours of eating here. I've been to other cheesecake factories with no problems in the past. Obviously there are some issues with the way they handle poultry which can be very dangerous.
Jorge B.,"Sparks, NV",2,15,,4.0,7/16/2016,"Not a real factory :(, but best cheesecake I've had in a long time! Staff was friendly and service was quick!"
Ronald W.,"Fairfield, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/13/2016,"We went last night to dinner and were told the wait was 10 minutes, we waited the represented 10 minutes only to be told that it would be another 5 minutes multiple times. After 30 minutes, we left without eating. We were going to the James Taylor concert and this misrepresentation of time resulted in us not having dinner before the concert. It was busy no doubt, but if the manager had been honest with us, we could of made an informed decision. We had gone to BJ's near by before and were given an honest 25 minute estimate which is how we ended up at the Cheesecake Factory. It truly felt like we were being hustled with rolling 5 minute estimates. They get a zero star from me for disceptive business practices. I won't be back."
R O.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,23,1,1.0,3/11/2015,"Experienced some of the worst service of my life. I'm not from Fresno and I always look forward to dining at Cheesecake Factory as my hometown does not have one. From the moment our server (Jessica D) greeted us, I knew it was going to be a disaster. All she said was ""Hi"" did not ask my fiance and I how's it going, or what kind of drink we would like. We had to blurt out our orders. She came back with drinks, I accidentally mispronounced the appetizer we wanted and she corrected me very rudely and annoyed. She took our order, did offer any bread. We waited for a good 25 minutes. Our food arrived. She forgot the appetizer, didn't apologize and I told her to forget it. Our food was cold. It was very disheartening to see her attend to every other table she had (we were sitting in the bar area). She gave them great service. But not my fiance and I. It seemed like she was purposely trying to avoid us and would turn away when she passed by. I honestly think its because we are young and Hispanic and she made the assumption she was not going to get a decent tip? We were not checked up on. Only to bring us the check and refill our drinks AFTER we finished our food. Didn't bother asking us if we wanted cheesecake (hello how could you NOT, its the freakin Cheesecake Factory). I was extremely fed up and spoke to the manager. He was half ass listening, said he would speak to Jessica. Didn't apologize. She came to our table and explained we were offered a complementary cheesecake from the manager. Did she apologize? NOPE.  Overall, this experienced ruined this establishment for me. I will most certainty NOT be coming back to this location, and it will be awhile before I'm up for Cheesecake Factory."
Edmar C.,"Daly City, CA",18,32,7,1.0,9/20/2015,"Well well I guess this place really made us feel comfortable ..... NOT ... Due to the fact we brought two dogs that are service dogs !!!! We asked to be seated outside where no one else was sitting so that we could sit quietly and the pups wouldn't distract anyone. The NOT knowledgable MANAGER PAUL came out and told me my pups were not allowed as they were 'jumping all over the staff.' Meanwhile my dogs had been sitting at my feet not moving the entire time. After I protested and said that they were service animals and I could not be denied service, he asked for proof that they were. I showed him their service tags, which he tried to claim were false. Finally, he admitted they were real, but after he walked away no one came to help us."
Kat T.,"Fresno, CA",3,28,20,1.0,5/6/2015,"Got food poisoning along with another family member that was so severe it sent us both to the hospital! ON MY 24th BIRTHDAY! I will never eat here again. I tried to report this horrible issue to the manager and his boss's boss. But they refused to believe that "" Such an incident would ever occur from their restaurant.""  It was so bad I was puking forest green bile from my liver! Because I had nothing else left in my system to void. Since I spent the entire night heaving from every orafice in the bathroom! I blacked out and was sent to the ER by ambulance where they had to hook me up to an IV for immediate hydration. Blood work showed food poisoning was so bad my internal organs were swollen and the pain was so unbearable I was put on morphine.  I'm not overreacting the severity of this.  I would rather go through natural child labor than to ever experience this again.  I will NEVER eat here again."
Lisa H.,"Clovis, CA",2,32,54,5.0,9/26/2014,Enjoy this going here. I love their food; especially the lettuce wrap and calamari.  I love the environment & Patio seating. Their menu is loaded and I had their Georgia peach drink from the bar and its amazing. Def recommended!
