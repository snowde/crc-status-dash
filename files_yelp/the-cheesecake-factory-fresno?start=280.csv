Dio S.,"Fresno, CA",25,24,14,3.0,8/18/2014,"Not a bad place. Was here the other night and it was noisy. If they attempt to seat you in the round room, leave the restaurant as it's the noisiest place. That's where they put the screaming kids :/ I'm actually about ready to not enjoy my lunch... :( I'm not happy!"
Fernanda S.,"Clovis, CA",8,13,88,1.0,4/28/2016,"It's 4/27/16 2:00 PM My husband and I just left Cheese Cake Factory, the worst service ever. So we decided to sit at the bar b cuz there was just 1  other person at bar. The bartender at the time was so in grossed in his conversation that he never even look over to  acknowledge us. "" so I thought well give him a minute""  NO he just continue on with  the conversation with the  only other person at the bar. Meanwhile my husband is starting to get annoyed. So after 8 minutes of just sitting patiently ""mind you we look at our  watch several minutes after his disregard."" we decide somewhere else deserves our money. I mean it was obvious to the guy he was caring on with , he kept looking over at us. The kid that walk behind the bar doing inventory even apologized for him, knowing  we have been sitting for quite sometime, with not even a hello. I have been a business owner for 21yrs, good service in this day in age is so crucially !! It was disgusting to just sit there being invisible to him. Guy behind the bar you need some serious training. I don't like to bash people in reviews but this guy was just so unaware super dense!! Really!! Anyway as we are leaving of course everyone is NOW wanting to help us, but not him. He is still talking to the only other at guy at the bar. Really! My husband let the manager know how disappointed in the service we were.  He Apologized  didn't say much more than that. We realize cheesecake factory is a large company and this review probably means nothing to them. It's too bad! I really like their seared Ahi tuna salad my very favorite the only reason why my husband takes me there."
Lisa G.,"Fresno, CA",0,12,3,3.0,5/12/2014,"Usually come here on the weekend. The service is always great, my most famous dishes are avocado eggrolls, grilled salmond and chicken salad.  I dont like their cheese cake, too sweet. Their drinks are just ok nothing special."
VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",60,624,11973,5.0,3/23/2012,"I cant say anything bad about this place. I have always enjoyed every meal ordered, friendly staff and decent prices...plus they have THE BEST cheesecake selection, I mean hello it's in their name. This is a great place and I will go back for sure, whether its for a anniversary dinner or just casual dining with friends."
Jonna P.,"Sanger, CA",34,52,47,4.0,7/4/2015,Had a great lunch here today. Husband got the Greek salad. It was very fresh and flavorful. I had the southern fried chicken mini sandwiches. Very good. The chicken was very moist. Great service.
Samantha R.,"Lemoore, CA",50,6,2,2.0,10/28/2015,"I have been going to this restaurant for about 5 years now. Never once have I had a bad experience here. Always great service and wonderful food. I haven't been in the past 7 months so today I thought I would treat my friends and spouse. Being as one of my friends had never been I thought this would be a wonderful brunch. Unfortunately,  it was not.. I'm not actually sure where I should start.  Let's start when my group got seated. The booth was somewhat dirty,  menu smelled of 'last night's leftovers left on the counter all night' & my waitress was wearing black  jeans. I am not one to be upset by attire usually but since the service was so poor I think it should be noted. I ordered mint tea, wild mushroom soup and the miso salmon. The waitress kept refilling it with green tea. The soup was AMAZING as always. I will never tire of that soup & I'm always excited when it is the soup of the day. That is the only positive note. The miso salmon was too sweet today and the peas were dry. I decided my meal could be overlooked until the waitress asked me if something was wrong w my meal. I told her my issues with the meal and she just stared at me for a minute and then asks me if I want another one. I decline  which is when she offered me "" another meal or something.."" again I  declined and said thank you anyways. This is when my friend informed me her 'medium rare' burger was in fact well done and then I noticed my spouse's pasta meal was missing one of the main ingredients. She tends to be very passive when it comes to others so she hadn't mentioned it until I asked where the garlic was. This is about the time the manager walks up to our table and asks about my plate. I explain to him my issues with my meal as well as the others. He told me he will go talk to the kitchen and he will be right back.  He never did come back.. though I did see him walk past our booth 3 more times. The waitress came back and says the miso salmon has been taken off the ticket.  I review the ticket pay with cash and silently vowed to never return to this restaurant as long as I live. Sad thing about this horrible experience was that after all the enjoyable experiences I have had there this was the one to break the camels back. Not only has the quality of service gone down hill but the care and quality of the food has also followed. I had already informed my company we should have the cheesecake factory cater our Christmas party but I will have to inform them that this is not something I'd be proud to announce I proposed nor would I want them to waste their money.  $120 spent on invaluable knowledge, I suppose. ."
Melissa M.,"Stockton, CA",47,91,73,4.0,2/19/2014,"Good experience tonight with Paul as our server. The only reason for a lesser star is that I found it strange that my sons meals came out a good twenty minutes before mine. I would understand if I had asked for them first... But it was odd.  Had a great experience, and he was right on top of anything that we needed. Props to Paul!"
Sharon F.,"Bass Lake, CA",2,29,,2.0,3/28/2015,"We usually go to this place when we visit Fresno at least 4 times a month.  Last visit we ordered and my order came out wrong.  My husband got his food, but I had to wait  an additional 10 minutes for my order.  By then his meal was cold.  The manager came by and apologized, but really that didn't matter.  If they thought about it they could of left part of my order so I could have started my meal and my husband could have eaten his warm.  My order was really easy and I don't think the waitress was paying attention.  Maybe I'm being hard on her, but it ruined our meal and this place is not cheap. They need to work more on service."
Juliana L.,"Stockton, CA",7,42,5,5.0,6/20/2015,"Thank you Kirsten! GREAT service...the food, as always, was fabulous!!!! Loaded potato bites...omg. Seriously though the service made this experience. She was aware, fast, smiling, and wonderful...thank you. Will come back here and hopefully we are seated in her section!"
Nicole W.,"Denver, CO",254,1723,580,3.0,8/22/2012,"Smaller location than their normal, HUGE type of thing. Bar is tiny - 4 stand up tables, and about 10 bar stools...   Happy hour till 6pm - $5 margaritas, mojitos, JW Lemonades! Woot! $5 apps - avocado eggrolls - ask for extra sauce, sweet corn tamales - HUGE and delicious Staff is ok - but not as friendly as i am used to and certainly not for a CA venue! Parking is terrible around this location as well - whatever you do, don't drive in front - super slow to get thru!!"
John D.,"Clovis, CA",7,28,3,3.0,5/24/2015,"The food was pretty good.  Service was pretty poor.  We got our order but no plates or silverware to eat it with.  My drink switched from Dr.  Pepper to coke.  But it wasn't completely bad, he was nice and quick.  The order went in fast and we were eating in no time.  The cheesecake was amazing. We ordered the traditional strawberry cheesecake and it was by far the best one I've tasted.  Overall it was a good time."
TJ T.,"Oceano, CA",21,44,10,5.0,12/5/2014,"Whenever we go to Fresno we love to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  Today was not different was in Fresno today took our daughter had the fried mac n cheese and it we so yummy then on to lunch the garlic noodles, chipotle chicken with penne pasta and the chicken Marsala.  Each item was beautifully presented and the taste was amazing.  Needless to say having the amazing appetizer and lunch we also have dinner which none of us can wait for our left overs. Unfortunately where we live there is no Cheese Factory so we truly enjoy when we can."
Micha a.,"Fresno, CA",13,62,3,1.0,3/3/2015,"FIX YOUR MENU!  The menu describes an entree as having certain ingredients. I ordered the tamale corn cakes with no salsa or sour cream. Dish arrives with some green, creamy stuff that IS NOT MENTIONED ON THE MENU. Had to send it back. Daughter was done plus 10 minutes by the time I got mine back. I was out of time and had to swallow about a quarter of it and leave. Also- fail on the comp. They attempted to comp my dish but then charged me twice, so I paid anyway. Too late and frustrated to argue. Paid and left. FIX YOUR MENU. Ugh."
Tony K.,"Bakersfield, CA",514,131,220,4.0,5/19/2015,I always enjoy this place. The atmosphere is lively and the service was great and friendly. Make sure you leave room for their dessert. Start with their calamari as an appetizer. It is excellent! The menu selection is huge so there's something for everyone. Make sure you leave room for dessert for sure! I recommend this place!
Mari E.,"Ivanhoe, CA",49,7,67,5.0,4/7/2014,Went there for late lunch a couple of weeks ago it was super busy parking isn't so great we drove around for what felt like forever! But when finally inside the restaurant is tastefully decorated we waited for about 30 min which wasn't too bad our waiter was great made us laugh a couple of time very comforting our lunch was brought out in a timely manner it was by far some of the best tex-mex egg rolls I've had ....I will definitely recommend them!
Lester W.,"Fresno, CA",141,125,190,4.0,1/29/2015,"the weather was great today so I stopped by here for lunch with the wife and i cant describe how good my meal was, we sat on the patio outside then I ordered the chicken teriyaki w/ brown rice and a peach bellini, the food came back in a timely manner our server was great also, the chicken was awesome i ordered extra teriyaki sauce bcuz i like mine drowning lol the peach bellini was pretty good too it complimented the meal, i will definitely be back"
Jeffelyn S.,"Porterville, CA",3,4,14,5.0,2/16/2014,First time here and Everything we ordered was really really delicious. Im bookmarking this place it is now one of my fave place to eat. Customer service was really nice and always checking up on us if we needed anything.. thumbs up.
Maureen C.,"Fairfield, CA",176,405,541,4.0,7/8/2011,"Cheesecake factories usually leave a blah taste in my mouth since they're so typical in California.  However, what made this place a 4 star to me was  1) the staff are fun 2) The party of 5 I had with me was easily accommodated with no wait whatsoever 3) The food came out quickly 4) While the food came out quickly, the drinks were always full and the bread was always aplenty 5) There must have been at least a dozen birthdays as Happy Birthdays were sung all around 6) But then again I did conspire with the host to  embarrass the server by having her sing for my sister's fake birthday. (she was compensated with a big tip though, yet I'm sure it must have been unnerving that there was an unusual amount of birthdays that happened to be on her section) 7) Yes the bill was astronomical but when you're stuck in 110 degree weather, are hungry, and grumpy, great customer service will always leave me less resentful of paying the bill. 8) Did I mention the staff are fun? 9) Did I mention that they have good customer service? 10) Did I mention that the staff are nice and attentive? Yup, all of the above make a difference"
Tanner S.,"Fresno, CA",1,3,,4.0,6/29/2015,Food is always properly cooked and staff is friendly and on top of my needs as a customer. Always love the Chicken Madera and how perfectly it is cooked. I will keep coming back to The Cheesecake Factory!
Valkrud S.,"Fresno, CA",2,1,,1.0,6/21/2015,"Nobody is using the tables outside, says they need us to wait 30 minutes to be able to be seated. The logic behind that is just moronic.
