Josh N.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/30/2015,"I was down here on business and was starving and wanted a good meal, so I decided to stop by. I was alone, so I sat at the bar. They give full service at the bar. I had the pleasure of meeting Jeremy, one of the bartenders there and his service was top notch. I drink a lot of water and I've never seen someone fill it up so fast, so frequently.  I'm normally waiting a few minutes for another water, but Jeremy was quick.  The food was great! I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was amazing. I also had the crab cakes as an appetizer which was also very good.  Overall, I had a great experience and I will definitely dine here again when I am in town."
S Y.,"San Francisco, CA",285,387,5880,5.0,5/16/2011,"The fact that this place can take on a family of 50+ for dinner on such short notice already makes it worthy of a 5-star review! I'm sure the wait was about 15 mins max... from when I got the call to be there asap, the drive over and as soon as we walked in we were being seated!  Cheesecake Factory held it down! 10+ to a table, 5 tables in one section and a waiter/waitress per table. Food came in good time considering it was not a prix fixe menu, water glasses filled, and each waiter/waitress was quite attentive and even playful with all the little kiddies with us!"
J V.,"Clovis, CA",6,54,4,4.0,5/6/2015,Recently went here for lunch and the food was pretty good. I got the turkey burger with a side of broccoli. The rye bread roll however that they give you to start was fabulous. My friend and I had gotten there right as they opened so it was very fresh. Would defiantly come back but order something else
Lily S.,"Fresno, CA",61,41,17,4.0,11/26/2014,"I love the food and atmosphere! I adore eating in and outside. The waitresses are very nice and always tend to you quickly. The Katsu Chicken was great and the portions are huge. I ordered a pasta dish (can't remember which) and she asked if I wanted the lunch or dinner size. She said the lunch size was small or half the dinner, but it was a large amount. I had left overs. A little pricey but worth it."
Estephanie R.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,15,,3.0,6/9/2015,"The food is good if you know how to choose correctly. (except the chicken samosas, they're not the best) the waiters and waitresses are nice, the hostesses not so much. Overall a good restaurant to go to."
Joseph G.,"Fresno, CA",100,36,31,5.0,11/27/2013,Came in with a friend and Christopher was our server and he was just phenomenal!  Food was excellent and service was fast and yet very professional!  He is great and so is the Cheesecake Factory :)
Cody L.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",1,7,2,2.0,4/18/2015,5th time here had 2 good experiences but the last three times they have just dropped the ball on service! Drinks and food a++ but service eh it could have been better..
Leonardo V.,"Fresno, CA",26,6,,4.0,2/3/2015,Great service! Comfortable ambience! I really enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps since I usually look for a light meal. The Asian style and Mexican style lettuce wraps are great! I enjoy visiting this place to enjoy a light lunch and a glass of chardonnay before a walk in the mall with my family! The plain cheesecake is my favorite!
Travis H.,"Fresno, CA",60,434,57,4.0,1/26/2015,"Can people seriously eat everything they are given? Goodness, that is a lot of food! But oh so good food at that... and then there is the cheesecake, WHOLY CRAP! Great service and wonderful food... oh yeah, and did I mention the cheesecake??!!"
Perry G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,1,2.0,9/22/2014,"Cheesecake was as good as always, but I have to complain about the pulled pork sandwich. First of all, it wasn't pulled, it was chunks and 50% of it was total fat.. If pulled pork is correctly cooked, there will be minimal fat due to it being melted away during the slow cooking process."
Susan S.,"Fresno, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/1/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has always had mediocre food, at best, however the service was always acceptable, that was, until my last visit. Our waiter was very rude and by the time we got our menus, he was making my daughter very uncomfortable due to his continuous staring. His behavior became so inappropriate that we even saw him trying to take a picture with his cell phone. At this point, I had to ask for the manager and told him what was going on. He went and spoke to the employee and came back to let us know he checked the employee's phone and saw no picture. I can't say I believe him, however at that point it didn't matter. My daughter felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave before our food even got to the table. The manager tried convincing us to stay and once we declined, he said he would send us vouchers in the mail for our next meal and for the inconvenience we faced at their establishment. Needless to say, we never received the vouchers and will most likely never dine at The Cheesecake Factory again. With mediocre food, the service was really the only reason to keep going back, and now that that has gone out the window, there is no point."
Leonard I.,"Hanford, CA",0,1,,4.0,2/16/2016,"Long wait to be seated, even longer wait for the food. They did keep out sodas and free bread and butter coming though! Lol the food was so worth the wait, and the service was excellent."
Karla A.,"Santa Maria, CA",52,33,6,3.0,8/11/2014,"Food at the Cheesecake Factory is just okay in my opinion, if you're into microwaveable type of meals. Came to the fresno location for lunch with my family. I had the Cobb salad and was honestly dissapointed. It was really oily and everything had already been mixed together for me so it looked like a green blob with egg. Usually when I order Cobb salads everywhere you get your greens surrounded by all the ingredients, I don't know why it made such a difference to have it mixed did me but for some reason it did. The server didn't really seem into serving, maybe she was having a bad day. The cheesecake on the other hand is ALWAYS to did for. I always go for the classic NY with strawberries and whip cream. The dessert alone makes everything else worth it."
Adrian Z.,"Kerman, CA",0,3,2,5.0,3/11/2014,Taste so good the whater was fast and nice she refilled our drinks the instant they were empty there was so much food on my  plate as well.
Jaeson H.,"Sanger, CA",87,11,8,3.0,11/14/2014,I want to like this place. It is attractive the food looks good but the taste of the dishes is hit or miss. The artsy fartsy fare is awesome yet they miss the mark on the staples. How do you screw up clam chowder that bad? And changing the frier oil once in a while would be advised.
Charlie O.,"Waukon, IA",776,1198,210,4.0,7/19/2012,"Have been to several CF's and my favorite item was the factory meatloaf. But it seems like the last few times I ordered it, it came out burned. So stopped ordering it. Stopped in here for dinner and ordered it again. Habit I guess. Was thinking of calling my server and changing to a salad. Glad I didn't. This was the best meatloaf I've ever had. Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spices in it.  The veggies were fresh, didn't have that frozen taste to them and the mashed potatoes were very good with the right amount of rosemary in them. My server was very fast and attentive.  4 thumbs up for the food, and 5 thumbs up for the service."
Shannah S.,"Redwood City, CA",367,197,153,4.0,1/7/2013,"Fantastic service. Food was pretty good with huge portions. Very busy spot...hard to walk through the crowds at the front to get to the restroom. Food came out fast though, and the waitress checked on me a lot. I would visit this location again."
Brutal H.,"Solvang, CA",0,9,,3.0,1/3/2015,"Strawberry Lemonade ""Cheapness"" PROS 1)  Food was acceptable of sufficient portion and brought out quickly.  We had Orange Chicken, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Kids Quesadilla, Kid's Mac and Cheese and Kid's hot fudge sundae in the restaurant with a slice of Lemon Meringue Cheesecake to go. 2) Wait time was only a couple of minutes to get a seat at about 5pm on a Friday night (January 2nd). 3) Server was prompt and attentive. CONS 1) My strawberry lemonade was 7/8ths ice cubes.  When I made that observation to the server, he stated that that is the only type of drink they are instructed to ""do that"" on.  If I am paying $4.79 for what is essentially sugar water, I shouldn't have to beg for refills because the glass is too full of ice.  Not to mention it inconvenences the server for having to come back and refill it. 2) Tables are too close together.  I physically moved the table after another server's ass was literally hanging over our table to take the order of the couple next to us. 3) Parking is horrendous.  I dropped my family off out front.  Valet was full at $7 cost.  Parked over by JC Penny's after driving around for 5 to 10 minutes. Overall, average of any Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  It's not the Ritz and it is not Del Taco.  I will probably come back, but likely because Fresno seems to have fewer good choices compared to other Cities of half a million people."
Elly L.,"San Francisco, CA",6,28,66,5.0,4/11/2014,"First impression was their great service-our server was really nice, a nursing student from Fresno State.  My friends and I ordered shrimp scampi, the chicken Madeira, chopped salad, and steak. The chicken was incredible. The flavor was so good and unique, and the chicken was juicy. I think they used wine in it? But it was like gourmet food and so yummy!! The baked shrimp in the shrimp scampi was very flavorful and crunchy with a nice (small) touch of noodles in the middle. The chopped salad was god as well, not sure what sauce they used but this was great for sharing and not messy at all, able to be served with a spoon. I remember it to have a semi-sweet fruity dressing. The steak was juicy and delicious but I don't remember the taste of it as strongly as the chicken madeira (a must get!)  Lastly, we got a banana cream cheesecake, which our server suggested. It was really really good. Light, but the perfect balance between fluffy and dense, it was the perfect way to end the meal. Definitely tasted the banana. It also came with a small saucer of hot fudge which was a great complement to the lightly sweet cheesecake. The whipped cream was also very good! Needless to say, I had a very satisfying experience here that night."
Breann E.,"Fresno, CA",0,21,8,5.0,10/19/2015,"Nicholas M. (Nick) is the best server at the Cheesecake Factory in Fresno! My husband and I fell in love with his personality and his service was the best service we have ever received in our life! He deserves the best tips and the best pay, he goes above and beyond ordinary customer service. He was made for customer service and is a phenomenal waiter! From now on my husband and I are going to call before we go to the Cheesecake Factory to ensure that Nick can be our server for the night. My husband is from Fresno and I'm not but we are relocating in the next week to Fresno from the central coast, I'm so thrilled to eat at the Cheesecake Factory all the time now ! It was my first time and it was honestly the best dining experience I have ever had in my life and 80% of the reason was because of the amazing service ! What a wonderful place and wonderful people! The Hershey cheesecake with vanilla ice cream and fudge is the best ! Our waiter even left us the sweetest note on our receipt congratulating us on our Newborn! Thank you for the best dining experience Nick ! God bless you"
