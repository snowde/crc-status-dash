Rob T.,"Seaside, CA",0,5,2,1.0,10/20/2012,"Horrible!  Why can't I only give half a star?  Probably because I can't get their magical ""Factory Burger"" on a regular bun!  Is there a shortage of regular buns?  I understand having a special chef's dish at a five star restaurant that the chef will not compromise on, but this is a cookie cutter chain restaurant with a bunch of dead end jobs for dead end lives of dead end people; just substitute the damn bun! In addition to the inflexibility, the server was extremely rude to me about just asking for the substitution.  This place is on the road to ruin; don't waste your hard earned dollars on the cheesecake factory on Shaw."
Jay S.,"Fresno, CA",10,464,14,2.0,5/25/2012,"To me Cheesecake Factory is all that is wrong with chain restaurants.  Big gargantuan portions of mediocre foods, that also happens to be some of the most fattening food you can order at any chain restaurant.   My family absolutely loves this place for some reason, and occasionally I get roped in to eating here.  I always find it hard eating here because I know just how unhealthy the food is, which in itself isn't the worse thing in the world, sometimes I like splurging and going all out on some unhealthy food.  But when I do that, I want the food to taste damn good, not mediocre under-seasoned food.  At least they recently added a lower calorie menu that isn't completely terrible, so I don't feel quite as bad about eating here. One thing I will give them is that the servers are always super nice, so thats a plus at least.  However this place is always busy as hell, so there can be a bit of a wait depending on what time and day you decide to go."
Mari D.,"Fresno, CA",1,2,2,1.0,11/30/2014,Please update ur info bcuz they close at 10pm on Sundays... Drove 20 mins to get here for nothing. :-/
Cheelee Y.,"Fresno, CA",5,62,104,4.0,10/29/2014,"I always come here to eat with one of my friend and her family. It's really good, the menu is broad, the interior looks very elegant. The main courses are a bit big which makes it a little pricey. But there's appetizers, soups, salads, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, and a variety different cheesecakes to choose from. I enjoy eating their appetizers (calamari), pasta's & cheesecakes. I would recommend this place for any occasion you have(:"
Liza B.,"Coalinga, CA",1,37,,2.0,7/23/2014,"Out of all the delicacies I ordered the BBQ pulled pork burger. I don't recommend it, skipped out on the cheesecake and regret that I did now. Craving the Dutch chocolate and red velvet a day later. The waiter was extremely nice and the atmosphere lovely."
Donna G.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Beware! Beware! Beware! A real warning if you decide to eat here. Whatever you order, if something doesn't seem right to you - reject it!  It is your hard earned money you are throwing away. We went New Year's Eve. A lot of people. Dark! You can barely see your food, so do not hesitate to bring a flashlight or use your cell phone. The day prior I had just done a take -out off their Skinny menu and really enjoyed their Chicken lettuce wrap tacos - mexican. This time I ordered the same item but the Asian version. Also, I ordered, off the Skinny menu, Grilled Artichokes and later, the Apple Crisp. The artichokes were way overpriced...$7 and just two tiny halves. I don't know why...maybe I just don't eat out very much, but I regret not rejecting that dish outright. The artichoke was tiny...about 3 inches long...both halves of the heart barely made a bite. It would please me very much if any of you reading this, order it and then reject it!   Now, the apple crisp. Pathetic! $8 -- it came in a big shallow dish - goopy! I couldn't tell how it was supposed to be because it was dark! Took a bite or two and decided to just take the whole darn thing home. Well, I just finished taking a closer look at it, and it was raw! It was gooey because they just mixed the entire thing together, apple slices, cinnamon-flavored dough, walnuts. I put the whole thing in my oven and baked it for about 25 mins. It was a little bit better. By the way, the Asian tacos were good, though the chicken was a little dry. Those cooks back there were probably laughing their heads off!  This restaurant needs Gordon Ramsey!! So, not only here but any restaurant, if the food is not right, you have the right to reject it! It is your own hard-earned money which should be spent on good quality products!!!"
Debra S.,"Lodi, CA",0,44,,5.0,1/1/2016,Wonderful service!!! The food was great!!! I did not have to wait to be seated!!! I was able to find a parking place and the parking lot was full!!! This was my first visit and I Loved it!!! Thank you The Cheesecake Factory.
Rachel J.,"Clovis, CA",32,63,113,5.0,8/23/2014,"I love this place. Everytime I order something different because the menu is HUGE.  Yes sometimes u have to wait a little while for the food but I still give this place a 5 star rating, you have to take into consideration how big and packed it is sometimes.  The steak dianne and shrimp scampi is pretty good. I have never had a bad dish here!!"
Judy T.,"Fresno, CA",103,11,,1.0,3/18/2015,"Went here with a party of eight, and were made to wait 2 hours before being seated. We are all ESL, Hmong being our first language. One of the guys in our group has a very thick accent and slurred speech. After waiting two hours to be seated we come to find that the manager PAUL had instructed his server to not pro ide our table with alcohol. When asked why he would do such a thing he claimed that it was the law to make sure we are not drunk. At this point i have had just one drink. When asked why he woukd make that assumption he simply looked over at my friend with disgust. This man obviously had a problem with my group being there and serving us. Why is this man even a manager at such an establishment? Ruined our experience there. We paid for our beverages and went over to BJ where they treated us kindly, respectfully, and provided amazing service."
Theresa A.,"Fresno, CA",192,114,9,5.0,4/7/2012,"Love this place. Came here with the boyfriend for a nice dinner date before we went to see a movie. This was his first time here, he was a little hesitant but that's only because he's not big on trying new places. I assured him he would love it! We arrived about 6:30, I was expecting to have to wait a long time but we got seated immediately. Our waiter was SO nice! We ordered the Fried Cheese appetizer and the Fire Roasted Artichoke appetizer, both were delicious. The fried cheese is basically their own version of mozzarella sticks, my boyfriends favorite. He loved them and even told me he preferred these over normal cheese sticks. My artichoke was cooked perfectly, it comes with 2 different types of dipping sauce. We both ordered the same thing - Crusted Chicken Romano. SO GOOD! The chicken breasts are cut thin and crusted with cheese, the pasta comes with a light tomato sauce. Everything was delicious. We will definitely becoming back!"
Morrell C.,"Sacramento, CA",15,16,,2.0,7/9/2014,"The food here is decent and price doesn't match the food quality just the food portion. I think this is a great place for a huge group where each individual want something different for food and cheesecake for dessert. Their cheesecakes are pretty good and the only reason for my low rating is that I just find the menu too overwhelming and even with all the choices, the food just seems okay rather than amazing."
Erica R.,"San Jose, CA",10,2,,5.0,9/28/2015,"ruben was our server and he was very knowledgeable about the menu, i liked his energy at the table he made great conversation! we will be back!"
Alma B.,"Madera, CA",42,128,9,3.0,12/19/2012,"I finally came here after hearing so many good things about it, but it is really only about a 3 and a half star place.  I ordered the lunch plate of Louisiana pasta.  The plate was a really good size so heaven knows how large the dinner plate must be.  It was basically a bow tie pasta with cajun style sauce topped with two pieces of chicken paillard.  Good, but the sauce is a little greasy.  My jaw dropped when I checked the nutrition info on this plate (1700 cal for the lunch plate).   I decided to take a slice of cheesecake home.  The Pumpkin Pecan sounded good, but basically it is a pecan pie topped with cheesecake, carmel sauce, and whipped cream.  The whipped cream made it home intact after a thirty minute drive, so the cream probably has additives.  The slice of ""cheesecake"" alone was 800 calories, which makes sense because about halfway through I just couldn't take the sugar anymore.   Overall, I am not impressed with the place.  It took me about twenty minutes to decide what I was going to eat since the menu was about twenty pages long.  The fact that the only dishes under 1,000 calories were on the two page Skinnylicious section of the menu should probably scare off dieters and diabetics.  You will end up spending about $8 for one slice of cheesecake, so basically the dessert is up to 80% of the price of the least expensive entree here.  Expect to spend at least $20 per person here."
Geral X.,"Fresno, CA",9,5,5,1.0,2/13/2015,Came here with my brothers and sisters and in laws for a valentines dinner the day before valentines day. My sister in law called me 4 hours before we planned on meeting up at Cheese Cake Factory and I ask her if she called to make reservations.  She told me she did call them but they told us to just come in and they would seat us. We arrived at 6:4pm and they told us that it was going to be an hour wait. We agreed and waited. As the hour came by we asked the manager if our table was ready yet and he tells us its going to be another 5 to 10 minutes so we tried to be patient and waited. 30 minutes went by and my brother approached the manager (Paul) to ask him again if our table was ready and he said that one of the girls in our group agreed to wait another hour. What the heck? No one talked to the manager other than my brother. My brothers want to BJ's Brewhouse at the bar and the girls went shopping at fashion fair  while i waited for our table. An hour went by and my brothers and sister came back to find the manager making excuses that our group was too big so it took long and that we weren't waiting and that we left (I was still here). 1 star because manager was a D*ck.  No care for customers and no respect. Lied to us and plays it off. After we were seated Kristen rook care of us. Service was great afterwards. Paul needs to take a some lessons.
Sy C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,7,,1.0,5/22/2015,"Horrible customer service at this location (Fresno, CA). I had been to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, so I am aware how the service should be. We had a party of 7, we were seated by the host and never received any services until we walked out and asked to speak to the Manager.... No one came to take our drinks or offer water to our table. It was impossible to forget us because we had a loud infant and seated at a round table, surrounded by other booths.  Waiters walked around helping customers in the booths around us but never once did they stopped to say anything to our table.  After what seems like 10 mins, I stopped a male waiter if he knew who our waiter was. He said he was going to check and send someone over. My husband took the baby for a walk while we waited. After a while, the same male waiter I spoke to, came back around and still we had not been helped. The waiter didn't bother to let us know if someone is coming or say anything. My husband came back with the baby and we were still not helped, so our party of 7 got up and left. On our way out, we asked to speak to the Manager. They told us our waiter wasn't feeling well, but how come they never sent someone else to cover for our waiter? The Manager didn't care we were leaving. He just said sorry and hope we have a good night...."
Abha N.,"Pasadena, CA",2,14,,5.0,8/6/2015,"After a full day of shopping with baby in tow, my husband and brothers in law were hungry. So was I. So we stopped at this Cheesecake factory. Great service and they were very accommodating of us given that we had a big stroller and a fussy baby. The food was excellent - I recommend the chicken samosas!!"
Linda T.,"Fresno, CA",2,13,3,1.0,2/21/2015,"I have never had such a bad experience in my life. The manager, Paul la Spada, is the worst. We came in as a big group with 9 adults and two kids for a late dinner to celebrate our love for each other (couples and family). He told us the wait would be 1 hour but we waited two hours. Yes, we were upset because of the wait. We are seated and ordered our drinks, appetizers and meal. When our appetizers started rolling in some of us wanted a second drink. Of course the orders took a while to come in as we had finished our beverages. Even the water glasses were empty. The manager, Paul, came to our table and said we could not order any more alcoholic beverages because 2 of the adults were drunk. When we asked him how he judged his statement he said they follow signs of a drunk customer. He said it was because 1 adult slurred his words and the other was sleepy. 1st of all, that's how the guy talks. Paul shouldn't have belittled his English. 2nd of all he didn't even order an alcoholic beverage. We left because of the rude manager. NEVER eat here if you want good service and decent management. We left after paying for the items we received. I will not support a joint with this viewpoint."

Parking at this location is sometimes hard to find, especially at night.   Forgot to mention that the cheesecake itself is amazing!  My favorite is the Hershey chocolate one they currently have.  I always have to get it, with half my meal, to go.  Definitely a treat.  My least favorite has been the red velvet (but I think I would rather have that as a normal cake).   If you have money and are looking for a good portion of food (or are looking to split a meal), this is the location!"
