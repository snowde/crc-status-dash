Caroline L.,"Orange, CA",304,726,12,3.0,2/27/2012,"Came here last night w/ a large group and sat in the freezing cold outside in the patio. It was windy and the entire party was uncomfortable and frigid. They do not have enough heat lamps set up. It sucks b/c they don't take reservations, not even for our large party of 14. So lame. So instead we waited 45 minutes to sit in the freezing cold while my food turned cold in 5 seconds. Grr. I'm pissed just thinking about this meal.  Overall, the food was as expected for Cheesecake. I ordered from their ""skinnylicious"" menu which is a lame name in my opinion. Or maybe I'm just grumpy b/c did I mention it was friggin cold with insufficent amount of heat lamps? Or did I mention I asked one of the servers to turn UP the heat and she proceeded to turn it DOWN? Goodness gracious, wake up! Anyhow, back to the food. I ordered the mushroom flatbread which was tasty, though small portioned. The cream chicken soup was tasty though I couldn't really taste any artichoke hearts. I also ordered the pasta w/chicken and basil which was mediocre and huge. The chicken was overcooked."
Linda M.,"Stockton, CA",387,101,409,3.0,12/29/2011,Its a chain I really try to avoid large chains but here I am . Very pleasant server went out of his way to insure everything was up to par . I had the pot stickers as a appetizer good but not great I know its what i get for ordering pot stickers at the cheesecake factory . I had Evelyn's favorite pasta it was loaded with fresh veggies not remarkable but good . Kind of noisy and obviously a favorite place to take your children and let them run freely very bright no atmosphere that I could detect . Now here is the best part I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake perfect combo of sweet and sour . Parking can be a challenge and the wait can be long .
Benjamin I.,"San Francisco, CA",54,288,42,3.0,8/28/2012,Not a huge fan of any restaurant that gives customers a pager when waiting. Had a solid salad though and it was an easy lunch.  Everyone i was with also enjoyed their lunches.  Will likely go back since the menu is beyond huge and can easily accommodate a large groups varying tastes.
Ian M.,"Madera, CA",1,18,1,4.0,10/11/2014,Friendly servers and great food for a good price! I got the kobe burger and really enjoyed it!
Kevin H.,"Fresno, CA",706,127,1200,4.0,11/6/2011,"I eat here at least 3 times a month.  Love the atmosphere.  When I'm out of town I usually look for a Cheesecake Factory.  I love the orange chicken, spicy cashew chicken, and the caramel chicken.  The Thai lettuce wrap is a good plate if you like to make your own wraps.  The cashew chicken salad is a good choice for weight watchers.  You have to try the red velvet cheesecake.  I always eat my dessert before my main dish."
Lisa R.,"Bakersfield, CA",132,15,13,1.0,11/13/2013,"This place was a joke! Originally from Bakersfield, but in Fresno for a doctors appointment and decided to eat here. Got here around 1pm and there was still a wait during the lunch rush. We decided to snatch a table in the bar to get ""faster service"" rather than wait. As some ladies left their table, we waited at this table waiting for somebody to acknowledge us to clean our table so that we could sit. We were looked at and passed up by sooo many staff and nobody bothered with us until I had to go ask twice to have our table cleaned from the previous people. A manager type person was trying to call a bus boy on her headset but nobody was responding. She should have just done the damn cleaning herself. The bus boy was a bigger joke. He looked so unhappy to have a job there. He cleaned our table off, then wiped it down with the most dirty, grimey, parmesan cheese smelling rag! It was gagging us the smell. It seemed like such a joke at this point that we even bothered sitting at the bar. we told the manager lady we needed our table clean again. Our waitress was ok, but she was one of the ones passing us by in the beginning. Step up your game Fresno. LA area Cheesecake Factorys are SO much better than your sorry location! Very disappointed!"
Patricia A.,"Los Banos, CA",40,108,17,1.0,4/21/2014,"My uncle and aunt treated me here for lunch! This was my first time ever at Cheesecake Factory! I tried their spicy cashew chicken and it was absolutely inedible! Unfortunately the server never came around to ask how the meals were or else i would have told him to take it back. The dish was very very salty as if they just poured a gallon of soy sauce in the dish! The soy sauce was very overpowering and there was no spice to the dish whatsoever. I took almost everything home and let my husband try. He agreed that it was horrible. I'm not sure if its supposed to taste that way  or if the chef messed the dish up! I wasn't impressed by my first visit. However i tried my uncle's dish ""steak diane"" and it was great! So if I ever go back I will get that dish!"
Niki S.,"Fresno, CA",4,2,,4.0,9/7/2012,"My husband and I have a special place in our hearts for CCF. The stuffed mushrooms are scrumptious and I LOVE the Chicken Madiera! I had never had asparagus before! (new love) The service IS a little slow and its pricey, but they make up for it in kindness and giant portions. Its a nice date place. Plus we've never had a cheesecake we didn't like!"
Katie A.,"Clovis, CA",1,60,8,1.0,2/14/2014,Will never go back to this location. Got the worst food poisoning of my life there for lunch after not eating yet that day. I took a few bites of my food and stopped eating. It has a strange chemical taste to it. I cant remember the exact dish but it was enchiladas and something. The waitor asked if I would like a box I politely declined. He asked if I had liked it I said no. He never offered another dish or discount. We paid full price for inedible food. We left in a hurry since I was already not feeling good. Called the next day to let the manager know about the health hazard and never got a call back. This was a couple years ago hopefully they have some new managers but I will never go back.
Celina L.,"Houston, TX",1,35,1,1.0,1/26/2014,"I usually LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It is one of my favorite places to eat. The food, service, and atmosphere is always exceptional. HOWEVER, this location in Fresno was horrid.  I seriously drove an hour to get to the Cheesecake Factory expecting a wonderful experience. We were seated almost immediately, which was nice. However, after our waiter came by our table initially we spent the next 60 minutes with only one more visit from him: to take our order; and, that visit was about 10 minutes into our seating. Within about 10 or 15 minutes our drinks emptied. Then we spent another half hour for my fried mac n cheese to come out, and for our drinks to be refilled. Again, our drinks ran out after about 10 minutes, and then we spent another 30 minutes with empty drinks, and waiting for our food. I had enough. I got up to talk to a manager. As I was talking to the manager, a server, not our server, brought out our food. I explained to the manager what happened, and he said he'd send us out some bread, new drinks, and come check on us in a few minutes. He never came. My food was cold. My mashed potatoes were under-cooked, and under-mashed.  Our primary objective for eating there was to get cheesecake. We were so upset by the service, food quality, and management that we left without getting any cheesecake. I cannot explain how upset I am with this experience. I will NOT be returning to this location again.  I have thoroughly preferred living in Central Valley over So-Cal. However, So-Cal has Central Valley beat on quality for their Cheesecake Factories."
K G.,"Fresno, CA",0,75,11,3.0,5/4/2014,Typical food you'd expect to eat at an American restaurant. A step up above Mimi's if you know what I mean ;) Waiters are nice. Place could use more lights (it's too dim inside IMO).
Firas K.,"Clovis, CA",20,38,1,5.0,5/25/2015,love the vibe here . i had the 4 cheese ravioli/pasta thing. i forget what it was called. but the waiter was friendly. since i moved out here from the bay area i notice people are more social and friendlier . im glad i dont live in the bay area anymore
Grace L.,"Cerritos, CA",0,19,11,4.0,9/1/2015,Pastas and the breads they give you at the beginning are yummy!! Decor is nice too. However a bit pricy for the amount of food. It was weird how their artichokes were in while pieces; I wish they'd have prepared them better.
Bryant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",871,411,1124,4.0,2/21/2012,Good service. Waitress offered to split bill without being asked. Beautiful interior.  Limited parking.   Well-seasoned food.
Geany C.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2015,"First time here and it was my worst experience ever! Got sat down right away but we waited at least 15-20mims waiting to see if a server was going to take our drinks or not. People who sat down after us got served first. Also, there was a table next to us was being served and I know for a fact that their server saw that we've been sitting there for awhile but didn't bother to help us at all. By that time I wanted to leave. My friend had to go up to the front and tell them that we've been waiting for awhile for a server to show up. Funny thing was that it wasn't even busy! So finally a server did come to help us, took our drinks and came back with them. Out of the three of us, one person got a straw and the rest didn't. He came back taking our orders. I was already ready to order and I ordered an entree, my friend was indecisive about what she wanted. She ordered appetizers and the server didn't even ask my bf what he wanted and left right when we ordered. So after a couple of more minutes after putting the appetizers in, my friend wasn't sure what entree she wanted, he comes back and left us again. My bf didn't even get a chance to say what he wanted to order especially when the server kept walking off. He came back 15-20mins later. I started to wonder if he even put my entree I ordered. My friend decides to ask if he put in my order and his response was ""well I was waiting for her to order an entree before I put it in"". Totally absurd because I ordered it right when he took orders and i had to wait 20mins to find out that he still didn't put in the order?! That's when we had enough of waiting and canceled the order, paid and left. Didn't deserve a tip because of the lack of customer service. I do work at a restaurant myself so I understand and know how things work. I felt like they didn't care for our table because they think we're ""young"" and we probaly won't tip. Totally lost a costumer! Won't be coming back here again."
Holly O.,"Sanger, CA",21,8,9,3.0,5/21/2015,"Make sure to check your receipt versus what is actually deducted from your bank account! I came in for lunch with my mom, sister, niece, cousin and a girlfriend for lunch last weekend. Between us we had 4 separate tabs. Our server was great, but her shift ended and she came by our table to thank us and introduce us to the male server that would be taking over for her. By this time we were just about wrapped up, and when he came back to check to see if we needed anything else we all decided to order some cheesecake. After bringing our desserts, he brought all of our checks. We all paid with cards, and while everyone else left their tips on their card, my mom and I left $10 in cash on the table, and I wrote ""Cash"" on the tip line of the receipt and, brought the total of $47.51 down to the total line. Today I go to balance my checkbook and there was a $2.49 discrepancy between my check register and what the bank said my balance was. Upon speaking to a representative about one transaction, that did not match any receipt from the week I had balanced through, it was the debit from my visit to The Cheesecake Factory. It had posted for $50.00. I called and spoke to the manager, and he investigated it.

He was apologetic, informed me he would credit my card back for the overcharge, and talk to the server about it. But, is that enough? I'm not upset about the $2.49, but the dishonesty the server showed in rounding up my tab. How much extra money does he get away with if he does it to every table he serves? I feel that it was a deliberate act on his part. I've never had this happen here, and as long as this server is working there, I want all patrons to know this could happen to them if they pay with card."
Nichole M.,"Clovis, CA",240,670,5,4.0,7/7/2009,"Tamale cakes?! I'm Mexican, and I have never heard of these, freaking Cheesecake Factory showed me?! But is this something like ""chalupas"" or ""enchiritos"" something that isn't truly from Mexico?? Any hoo, IT'S DELICIOUS!!!!!!  And I only had a bite of those, I had the fried bread chicken sandwich. This too, was mighty mighty good. I even ate it all, (you will realize how big of a piggy I am when you see the size of this thing). $10.99 for sammie and fries. We also had the pineapple cheesecake...with whipped cream. I'm just guessing it's about 80 grams of fat and 2560 calories but it will be damn worth every bite! $6.95 a slice. -1 star No lunch specials? Really? I'm poor I need some happy hours!!"
Manuel P.,"Firebaugh, CA",4,59,30,3.0,12/2/2013,The food is A-OK here!  I think the service is great!  I went recently and had the normal routine.  My daughter had the Filet Mignon and she said it was good!
Yer X.,"Chicago, IL",6,8,,3.0,9/2/2013,"The place looks great during the day at Lunch, however I wasn't satisfy by the taste of the food. I came here on my 19th birthday with my sister, and had few orders similar to the one I had in Chicago with my fiance. We had a table immediately with low populated people, which is fine because it's barely afternoon and was served with a wonderful server. I ordered the small plated appetizer, the Palento Fries and Buffalo Wings as my sister has just Buffalo Blast. Just to let you know, we haven't ate the day before, which is why we ordered so much appetizers. The Palento Fries was perfect I have no words for it. But the Buffalo Wings was cooked differ than the way it was from Chicago; the wings was cooked crispy and fries along with the sauce. Nothing different about it, but deep after devouring a two cooked buffalo wings was a chicken drum blood. I didn't say anything cause I lost my appetite. I left it to the side and hoped it would cook in the microwave, soften, but to cook the blood away. I just couldn't say anything, I was upset. My sister's buffalo wings was delish, but too oily to devour it. First of all, I thought it would be a small dish! ...but it wasn't. It was too much our lunch arrived immediately. We took it home for that, but I liked it very well. Now, my sister likes her Chicken Chipotle Pasta meal. I don't like my Orange Chicken. It has that ""too much"" soy sauce beneath the white rice. Another thing is that the white rice is hard when time pass, like as in two-three minutes. The chicken has too much zesty-lemony taste that is differs than it was in Chicago. Now I know I talk how differ this and that, but it's... just isn't the same? I guess I have to get used to it? No, it's the way how I like it. The chicken also, looks uncooked which lead me to be quiet again. My 19th birthday... eating here... was really weird. We ate dessert; I ordered a Reese Cheesecake home, and a Tiramisu Cheesecake and Shortcake there. I actually clarify to the waiter I wanted the cake, cake, not the Tiramisu but they don't have it. Or they just ran out... I was upset and suffered with the Cheesecake. The moisture of it.. just isn't the same. I miss eating it preferably with my fiance. Sighs. My sister did not eat all the Shortcake cause she mistakenly thought it'd be a nice slice of cake.. instead of a cake sliced in half with two scoops of ice cream with strawberries. Otherwise, it's an A-Okay place. I just had problems enjoying the simplicity of its flavor and its un-finished cook meal. I'll give the place one more time."
Delaine Z.,"Fresno, CA",214,825,235,1.0,5/9/2007,"I've eaten here once, won't return unless made to go because of a group event...service was ok for us but the table next to us had not gotten their food when we were finished and leaving yet they came in the same time we did.  We were crammed together on a banquet seating with tiny tables placed very close together.  We couldn't help but be part of the next table's conversation.   The food was ok, but nothing I would go running back for.  Prices too high for what you get.   Very crowded and noisy when we were there for lunch."

Manuel P.,"Firebaugh, United States",4,59,30,3.0,2/12/2013,The food is A-OK here!  I think the service is great!  I went recently and had the normal routine.  My daughter had the Filet Mignon and she said it was good!
Yer X.,"Chicago, United States",6,8,,3.0,2/9/2013,"The place looks great during the day at Lunch, however I wasn't satisfy by the taste of the food. I came here on my 19th birthday with my sister, and had few orders similar to the one I had in Chicago with my fiance. We had a table immediately with low populated people, which is fine because it's barely afternoon and was served with a wonderful server. I ordered the small plated appetizer, the Palento Fries and Buffalo Wings as my sister has just Buffalo Blast. Just to let you know, we haven't ate the day before, which is why we ordered so much appetizers. The Palento Fries was perfect I have no words for it. But the Buffalo Wings was cooked differ than the way it was from Chicago; the wings was cooked crispy and fries along with the sauce. Nothing different about it, but deep after devouring a two cooked buffalo wings was a chicken drum blood. I didn't say anything cause I lost my appetite. I left it to the side and hoped it would cook in the microwave, soften, but to cook the blood away. I just couldn't say anything, I was upset. My sister's buffalo wings was delish, but too oily to devour it. First of all, I thought it would be a small dish! ...but it wasn't. It was too much our lunch arrived immediately. We took it home for that, but I liked it very well. Now, my sister likes her Chicken Chipotle Pasta meal. I don't like my Orange Chicken. It has that ""too much"" soy sauce beneath the white rice. Another thing is that the white rice is hard when time pass, like as in two-three minutes. The chicken has too much zesty-lemony taste that is differs than it was in Chicago. Now I know I talk how differ this and that, but it's... just isn't the same? I guess I have to get used to it? No, it's the way how I like it. The chicken also, looks uncooked which lead me to be quiet again. My 19th birthday... eating here... was really weird. We ate dessert; I ordered a Reese Cheesecake home, and a Tiramisu Cheesecake and Shortcake there. I actually clarify to the waiter I wanted the cake, cake, not the Tiramisu but they don't have it. Or they just ran out... I was upset and suffered with the Cheesecake. The moisture of it.. just isn't the same. I miss eating it preferably with my fiance. Sighs. My sister did not eat all the Shortcake cause she mistakenly thought it'd be a nice slice of cake.. instead of a cake sliced in half with two scoops of ice cream with strawberries. Otherwise, it's an A-Okay place. I just had problems enjoying the simplicity of its flavor and its un-finished cook meal. I'll give the place one more time."
Delaine Z.,"Fresno, United States",214,825,235,1.0,9/5/2007,"I've eaten here once, won't return unless made to go because of a group event...service was ok for us but the table next to us had not gotten their food when we were finished and leaving yet they came in the same time we did.  We were crammed together on a banquet seating with tiny tables placed very close together.  We couldn't help but be part of the next table's conversation.   The food was ok, but nothing I would go running back for.  Prices too high for what you get.   Very crowded and noisy when we were there for lunch."
