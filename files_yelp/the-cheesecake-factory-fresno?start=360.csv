Lonny W.,"Lemoore, CA",34,167,68,4.0,9/5/2013,Good food in big portions. This place never lets you down and always has top notch food. The price is a little much but for the amount and quality it is worth it. Now as with the other reviewers I agree with the low and populated tables. Nothing like sharing a bench with 50 other guest. Next time I am going to ask for a table. However with it being over 100F asking for a table outside would not be worth it. I liked my trip to Fresno and Cheesecake Factory. The food was good and the place was earning my money.
Yvonne M.,"Modesto, CA",27,4,,5.0,9/17/2013,Matthew served us today around 2pm I was with my boyfriend and his mom. He is an excellent waiter! The banana & strawberry cheese cake hit the spot! (from a server to another server thank you!)
Tina H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",54,15,3,4.0,8/22/2013,"Great service from waiter & food was good, but was a little on the pricey side. Will go back but only for special occasions."
Chuck S.,"Fresno, CA",13,6,,4.0,9/21/2013,We had lunch today at the Cheesecake Factory.  I had a Ceasar Chicken salad that was delicious and a huge portion.  It was a bit pricey at $15.95 and we had to wait 20 minutes but the atmosphere and service was great. Overall I recommend coming here as I will be back as well  :-)
Karena R.,"Jacksonville, FL",97,269,322,5.0,6/22/2011,One of my favorite spots!
Chinh H.,"Fresno, CA",2,20,15,5.0,8/9/2011,"Great place to go for a nice night out. Try the Jambalaya Pasta. Of course the cheesecake is the star of the show. So many different flavors to choose from. As you may have read on the 'net, it's not exactly the healthiest fare, but for the occasional treat, you'll have a good time."
Rod R.,"Fresno, CA",0,19,4,1.0,11/8/2014,"I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki with Rice. It took 40min to get my food and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. When they brought it out I thought it was a Boneless Chicken Breast, But it had bones in it. The waitress said she could have them redo it. The manager came over and apologized. I told him it wasn't his fault. It was to dark for me to really read the menu to know it wasn't a chicken breast. They brought it back out but just cut the bones out of it. I could of done that myself. Actually it was over priced for the quality of food. The waitress was HORRIBLE about refilling drinks and checking back to see if we needed anything. We waited for just about 30min to get the bill paid. Again no sign of the waitress. 99% of the time I am a over tipper, But HORRIBLE service gets a HORRIBLE tip. I was ready to walk out with my money but I walked you to the hostess station and told the Manager I've been waiting to pay my bill for about 30min already, He didn't really seem to care. I will never dine there again. I will just stick to the Carry out Cheesecakes."
Kristen H.,"San Diego, CA",56,222,4,4.0,2/7/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is...well the Cheesecake factory lol. If you haven't been to one yet then I feel you have either a) been living on Mars or b) are so stuck up you need to get over yourself and eat some darned cheesecake. The location in Fresno is like every other CF...sometimes there is a wait, sometimes there isn't. They have a wide variety of items to choose from, but I usually stick with the Skinnylicious menu. There other items as VERY high in fat and sodium! I enjoyed the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger on these trip and it was sure tasty. It came with a side salad that was equally tasty. And of course the cheesecake.....I took home a slice of the Recees PB cup one and it was FABULOUS. I think next time I may skip the regular food and go for the good stuff..."
Jolly M.,"Phoenix, AZ",426,481,869,4.0,2/8/2011,"Cheesecake Factory has been a really good experience and hasn't disappointed. I love the CCF in Redondo Beach, CA. I am a bit spoiled with the ambiance their right off the water (marina.) However, Fresno CCF has it's beautiful charm about it too. I love architect and very much appreciate the indoor decor along with the newer developed surrounding plaza. Our Host: Tony is great. Very professional and yet has great humor. Good luck again Tony to your big important upcoming event!! Woot woot!! We are rooting for you man!  I very much enjoyed the salmon lemon sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and the asparagus. So yummy. The fish was cooked perfectly. Very moist. I did not care for the clam chowder. A bit too salty for my taste and had more potatoes versus anything else. Clams were hiding out somewhere else, because they weren't in my bowl or tummy!  I recommend CCF in Fresno. Because really this is one of the best places to eat with a variety of different foods and beverages to anyones liking. All other restaurants I don't believe have that going for them in the city of Fresno. If I am wrong, I appreciate any feedback to suggestions for my return visit out there. : )"
Cece C.,"Merced, CA",0,17,18,3.0,3/8/2014,"Came here with friends and had to wait 1 hour to get seated. We were STARVING! Our waitress was very funny and attentive. The food was ok. I regretted ordering the Cajun Chicken... Nothing special! It was a large plate full of deep fried chicken pieces with smashed potatoes and corn. My friend ordered a Bow tie pasta plate and said the pasta was under cooked and hard. Their plates offer large quantities of food, so split the plate  unless you are a big eater.  The dessert was great! Large slice of cheesecake worth the $7 bucks!"
Kris K.,"San Anselmo, CA",4,20,4,5.0,3/2/2015,"Kudos to Elena and Brian, Managers at the Fresno location.  I was in town with my daughter's swim team for a weekend meet.  Elena & Brian and their crew very efficiently pulled together 40 To-Go orders for us 2 nights in a row.  Everything was packed correctly, labeled, and exactly as specified...even the gluten free orders!  Friendly and attentive!  I highly recommend them!"
Weston P.,"Sanger, CA",406,192,103,5.0,8/11/2013,Tonight I had the beet and goat cheese salad. It was the perfect size and tasted great. I was very impressed with the level of service we received tonight sitting on the patio.
George O.,"Fresno, CA",172,12,8,4.0,1/12/2013,"Had a great meal off the skinny menu. I was very impressed by the flavor. This place is very clean and inviting. The service is a little slow but, it's also very very busy. I give it four stars because its very high priced for a place that your waiter or waitress has so many other tables to contend with and this slows the service. It was over $50 for my wife and I to have lunch there. That was for two entrees and two ice teas."
John L.,"Madera, CA",51,46,11,5.0,2/24/2013,"If you never knew this place was open at 10 am Sunday for breakfast, now you do! All I can say is wow! What a hidden treasure. Food is out of site, and bloodie Mary's too!"
Maribel M.,"Dinuba, CA",5,38,51,3.0,9/1/2013,"I've eaten several times here and in each occasion I was disappointed with their food. I don't know if its just me but their menu is way too large. If they have that much variety their quality must not be that good. I've had sandwiches which were nothin special and their fettuccine Alfredo which was way too runny. However, their cheesecake is so good! So I'll continue to go only for their dessert."
Lost B.,"New York, NY",1,468,61,4.0,4/18/2011,"Okay third time is the charm.  As stodgy as I can be I am going to relunctantly admit I am now a fan of Fresno Cheesecake factory. People have to consider that is is in Fresno which this place is better then other places in Fresno but may not be as good as other CF in larger cities. Case in point  last night: Super busy but my spouse and I got a booth in a decent amount of time away from loud people. Server was ultra effcient ,a gal this time and courteous and smiled. Our food arrived in great time even though the place was packed. We ordered stuffed mushrooms which were awesome because this time I actually ate some( first time I didnt even though spouse ordered them) I ordered pasta de vinci  which has chicken mushrooms in a white wine sauce. ( no I didnt eat the chicken gave it to spouse since I am a vegetarian but yes I did eat fish n chips the other day come guys I need the protein already but only fish I promise) Spouse orded jumbalya which they said was good but  when they had it in dallas it was served differently and tasted better in their opinion. I had mint ice tea lightly sweetened which was yummy and spouse is boring so they had root beer. For dessert spouse ordered  White Chocolate Macademia Carmel cheese cake which they loved. I  tasted it. It was good but for me it was a little bit to chock full of nuts. I ordered the Christ outragous chocolate cake. It has  alot of coconut in it and brownie and some chocolate frosting. I was so-so about it.  It tasted okay for what it was but the frosting tasted   like the generic chocolate frosting and there was to much coconut. I would not get it again myself BUT if you love chocolate and coconut you should try it you will  probably like it. I  dont know how much our bill came out to since my spouse got the check but my pasta was 12 dollars and change and my dessert was close to 8.00 so cheese cake factory is more like a treat then a every week so of deal for us.( Unless you are going strickly for dessert then it is very resonable price wise)"
Franchesca T.,"Fresno, CA",18,17,4,1.0,10/22/2012,Do not eat here unless you want to be fraudulently charged several weeks after eating there. Their management was terrible at assuaging an upset customer.
Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",1143,621,560,4.0,6/16/2010,"I was in town to catch my cousin's high school graduation from Buchanan High (so proud of her!) With a class of 840 kids, the ceremony took for-ev-er. We were outta there by 10PM, and at this point everyone was mad starving. Luckily, a bunch of big name restaurants accommodated the mad rush of graduates and families by extending their dinner hours. Cheesecake was one of them. All of us had a lovely dinner despite the celebrant having to leave midway to go to grad night. We all enjoyed our hot teas on an abnormally chilly night in Fresno, our hamburgers, ribs, and what-not.  The best part from Cheesecake? My cuz sharing the insider stories about the ceremony and grad night over a scrumptious slice of red velvet cheesecake for breakfast. She gets major props for sharing with her cuz and Cheesecake gets major props for making this moment possible."
Lian P.,"Fresno, CA",0,10,,4.0,2/9/2015,I always find myself eating here simply because they have a huge variety and everyone can find something they like which is great when you come with picky eaters.  It can get pretty crowded and loud.  The service is hit or miss.  I've had great servers and I've had horrible ones here.  The portion sizes are huge!  The drinks are decent as well.
Judy B.,"Apple Valley, CA",7,24,8,2.0,9/8/2010,"Now I love the The Cheesecake Factory but the Fresno location really bums me out. We have been here twice after backpacking the Sierra's and both times the service and food and drinks did not even compare to other Factory restaurants.  I love the Raspberry Martinis at the Factory but at the Fresno location they under pour their drinks and they do not taste the same! I have been to like 10 Factory locations and the drinks are always spot on, but not here. The food is mediocre at this location and the servers just seem plain tired. We sat down and ordered water and asked for bread and we were told that they usually don't bring bread til AFTER we order our meal....BS! Bread is always brought to us at all other Factory locations while we are looking over the menu. Whatever. As much as I love the Cheesecake Factory we will not hit the Fresno one again. I don't care how hungry we are after leaving the backcountry. HINT: Our favorite Cheesecake Factory is in Henderson, NV - they are outstanding and the bartenders are superb!"
