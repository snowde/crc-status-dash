John H.,"Fresno, CA",25,55,,4.0,7/1/2012,I have dine here several times and I must say the prices are reasonable for the meal you order. Try their bone in rib-eye steak. Compare to Ruth Chris and Flemings I must say it's very good and half the price.
Daranine S.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/8/2014,"The service was okay.a little slow. My main gripe was the food. My husbands fish and chips were really bland. No seasoning at all. And worse than that,the batter was underdone... The batter was still slimy beneath the outer layer. My penne  pasta was also undercooked. There was a lot of bowtie pasta in my penne,and it was tough and most of the penne was stuck together. A bad experience for both our stomachs."
Food Y.,"Fresno, CA",0,9,,3.0,1/24/2015,I love Cheesecake Factory's happy hour. Tex mex egg rolls and avocado egg rolls are delish but that's about it. The pasta is so bland. I also hate how their happy hour is from 4-6 not 2-6 now. :(
Mariam P.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/4/2014,"My favorite restaurant in fresno by far. Everything on the menu is great and so is the service. Love the strawberry lemonade, and on Sundays you must order the monte cristo breakfast sandwich; to die for!! Fish tacos are fabulous and so is the chicken tortilla soup. I recommend everything on the menu because it's stellar! Definitely recommend this place!!!"
John G.,"Porter Ranch, CA",2,4,,1.0,1/7/2015,"DO NOT GO to this Cheesecake Factory. The Cheescake Factory is my favorite restaurants for many, many years. First, it offers a variety of food choices. Second, there are so many delicious cheescakes to choose from. Finally, the customer service is bar none. However, this is not that restaurant. The manager, PAUL LA SPADA, is the worst manager especially for an establishment like this. My 7 year old daughter wanted an avocado eggroll and rather than giving into her request, he asked that we move to the bar? Seriously, my wife and 7 year old triplets are already eating their dinner after a long drive from Lake Tahoe and then to continue on to Northridge CA only to have my daughter denied an eggroll? This Cheesecake Factory at Fresno is NOT KID FRIENDLY.  I still love TCF and will only frequent the close to my home at Woodland Hills, CA. Shame on you, Mr. La Spada."
L C.,"Fresno, CA",0,12,,2.0,1/2/2015,Nothing special at all. Typical chain place with too many menu options and huge portions.
Jeska S.,"Turlock, CA",0,22,3,4.0,11/23/2012,Had a very delicious lunch after being at the mall. I had a Renee's special and added bacon & avacado!
Courtney W.,"Clovis, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/4/2015,"Ordered the pork chop; got a big, juicy chop with sides of finely mashed potatoes, applesauce and parboiled spinach. Delicious, the best I've had in a long time. Followed with mango/key lime pie, a coffee and tonic - $36. A little pricey but worth it!"
M J.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/9/2012,"Our server, Pedro was excellent and so was the food!  Spicey Cashew Chicken is the best!"
Matthew L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,23,,4.0,10/16/2012,The service is fantastic but the food is so-so. I got the nachos and it was nothing special. It didn't really have anything in it and it costed about 15$. I think I liked the free bread more than the nachos. Overpriced but it was a nice change of scenery from fast food places.
Consuelo N.,"Fresno, CA",7,86,37,5.0,4/28/2012,Love the three cheese pasta. Never had a bad meal here. Service is decent. Cheesecake is to die for. After a hard day a work I stop by for a slice to cheer me up.
Julie C.,"Fresno, CA",10,12,,5.0,8/30/2012,I go here for lunch frequently. The service is always fast. I usually just sit at the bar since I am in a hurry. The bartenders do an excellent job of getting me my food quickly and are super attentive to any needs I may have. The food being delicious is also a big plus.
Linda L.,"San Francisco, CA",51,248,3,1.0,1/26/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain.  Their decor, menu, and some of their food comes standard.  And yet, this one manages to suck. While I can be a bit of a food snob, I do like Cheesecake Factory and have eaten at various locations from DC to LA to San Francisco.  This location somehow managed to mess it up.  I don't know how, but they made the food bad.   AVOID at all costs."
Andrew D.,"Fresno, CA",63,90,1,4.0,2/16/2012,"I've been here twice with the gf and both times was great. Lulu was speedy and very nice. Good food, but expensive!"
Ed K.,"Irvine, CA",5,55,1,4.0,8/20/2014,"Overall was a good experience, the only thing I got a little upset they could not figure out how to make double espresso machado. Brought me 3 times wrong. Service was good."
D L.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,12,,4.0,5/1/2014,"Very good food here. I had the filet mignon and it came out just the way I wanted it. It was hot, flavorful, juicy and moist. The service was excellent, and the establishment was packed when I was here. One of the best restaurants I've eaten in a long time!"
Sebastian L.,"Monterey, CA",135,30,13,5.0,5/29/2012,Loved it sat at the bar had a great dinner drinks and it was just the right kind of loud burger with.a egg love it
Mallik K.,"San Jose, CA",59,84,59,5.0,5/25/2012,Chicken Croquettes... I loved it .. had a good time
Robert D.,"Fresno, CA",6,58,3,5.0,6/30/2010,"I had the best burger in quite some time at this location. It was called the Memphis Burger: a nice size patty with sliced cheddar cheese, bbq'd pulled pork on top of that and then topped with cole slaw and fries on the side. Very messy but so worth it! Give it a try for lunch or dinner. And if you can't make room for dessert, get it to go. I recommend the red velvet cheesecake!"
Joseph R.,"Lemoore, CA",1,4,,4.0,12/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is an exceptional restaurant. Every time I come to Fresno, this is my first stop. The Chicken Madeira is to die for. The cheese and sauce are excellent, matched with delicious asparagus. The mash potatoes were also terrific, accented the chicken. The servers were just as great, and made sure our drinks were always full. Also love their brown bread, not sure what kind of bread it is, but it is delicious."
