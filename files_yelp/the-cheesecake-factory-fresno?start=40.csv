Sports G.,"Modesto, CA",0,29,8,3.0,12/23/2017,"I was there tonight with my family for my birthday dinner. We got drinks in the bar, which were great. We sat down and ate our meals, which were delicious. Unfortunately, the lights were so dim at the tables, we had to use the flashlights in our cell phones to read the menus! I voiced my concern to our waitress, but her excuse was it was ""part of the atmosphere"". Bull. We really had to strain our eyes to see what we wanted. I've eaten at this restaurant before and at other locations and have never had this issue. They want us to go blind!"
Janice W.,"Ceres, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/12/2017,This is a tradition to eat here and go to a concert. We had plenty of time. We even ordered cheesecake so we'd get it with the meal. The food took so long we are late for the concert. What a huge disappointment. When we spoke to the manager he said other stations are impacted and to avoid bad grade of food quality. No apology or acknowledgement of our wait. Simply going to not come back.
Amelia F.,"Lemoore, CA",70,9,5,1.0,6/1/2017,"Spent $40 on 4 desserts to bring home for my family, which I am usually happy to do, but I get home and open this? It looks like someone's leftover dessert! We drove 45 minutes to this place. So disappointed. Won't be back for a while."
Cher C.,"Visalia, CA",0,11,5,1.0,11/10/2017,Waited 30 min for Water and never got my coffee or Cheesecake. Had to walk out. Terrible service
Bruce M.,"Fresno, CA",92,359,719,4.0,11/12/2016,"Had the Fish tacos and some water, I must say the black beans tasted very good, normally I don't care for them. I was thinking about ordering some banana cheesecake but didn't, I'm still working on my weight loss. Enjoy"
Capnodium C.,"Reedley, CA",0,64,33,4.0,3/25/2017,"I come here for salad. They have good salad and it's difficult to find restaurants that serve good salad meals in Fresno. My favorite is the ones in ""Super Foods"". Good price and good volume. I highly recommend their salads with or without additional topping meats. Because of its busy location, finding a parking spot nearby is impossible. And sometime waiting time is very long. That's the reason I give 4 stars. Otherwise, store is clean and good service."
Karen P.,"Fresno, CA",15,6,15,2.0,4/11/2017,My family and I have been regulars at this restaurant for so many years. We have been to different Cheesecake Factory locations across the United States; we feel that this place is a landmark. About 3 weeks ago we try to put our names down to get a table and the hostesses ignored us for nearly 15 minutes. They were to busy talking about their dates and other things that may be really important to them but should not be that important whena guests is waiting. We got tired and decided to leave to end up at another chain restaurant where the host staff did not neglect us. I was not asking much...just acknowledge the guests and make sure they does not feel ignored. It will take a few weeks for me to cool of and by then I'll probably give this place a very last chance.
Rússel W.,"Fresno, CA",72,110,344,1.0,7/1/2017,Overpriced. Tasteless food. Service was good tho. Never come here again. Ordered turkey burger. Size is tiny. McDonalds makes better burgers.
Julie A.,"Lemoore, CA",0,5,2,1.0,5/8/2017,"I had brunch with about 13 friends here and we'll never come again. I was told they did not take reservations when I talked to a hostess a couple weeks before our event (even though I told them we had a large party), so I decided to call an hour ahead of time to put our name in the waiting list. I was told they only took reservations until 11am (contradictory to what I'd been told before) and wouldn't take our name and that the restaurant wasn't busy so we'd have no problem being seated. Upon arrival, the restaurant was busy and we were told that we'd be seated once half our party arrived. When that happened 15 minutes later, I went to the hostess and we were then told if we wanted to eat inside we'd have to wait an hour and a half! We ended up seated outside after waiting 35 minutes. This could've been avoided had the restaurant taken my name down an hour ahead of time, especially since we had a large party. This wasn't the only problem, though. Once everyone paid, the manager and server came out and accused two people in our party of not paying, which was ludicrous. They claimed to have cameras inside to prove this, yet we were seated outside, so no footage could show what happened between collecting our payments and taking them inside the restaurant. After we complained, the server said it was ""a misunderstanding"" yet the manager never came out to apologize for their accusations. We will not be bringing our business to this location again. They need to learn proper customer service to earn it back. Take my advice and go somewhere else!"
Todd F.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/18/2017,"Took 45 mins to get food, server was rude and inattentive didn't automatically refill beverages and food was barely warm."
Sally K.,"Fresno, CA",5,46,199,1.0,7/10/2017,Food was Not good at all today my husband & I always stop here all the time but however today we decide to stop by for a early dinner and he order the fillet mignon but which  taste like it a cheap Chuck stake instead of a fillet mignon I however order a basil marinara chicken penne pasta which taste so disgusting I guess this will be our last time over there now. Take a close look at the SUPER THIN SLICE OF MY CHICKEN BREAST. HOW CHESP CAN THEY BE? SERIOUSLY? So upset we both did not enjoy our dinner.
Sunny X.,"Sacramento, CA",46,10,2,4.0,10/22/2017,Food was amazing as usual and in great portions as well. The Cheesecake Factory never seems to disappoint.
Cal K.,"Fresno, CA",158,97,2445,5.0,9/5/2016,"Never had a bad meal,  or a bad service here at the Cheesecake Factory. 5 minutes from my work and opens for lunch . Yet to take my family here to see how they like it , but my Colleagues and Business affiliates , always commend the food and the service here. The wait in the Bay area for any Cheesecake Factory location is at least on hour. I do recommend the Cheesecake Factory for Lunch or dinner , whether its a full meal or a Salad you will never leave hungry . So far so good."
Michael A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",175,105,129,3.0,6/30/2017,"Server was not good, name started with a T and she look like Marilyn Monroe. She slow, and did not here me from 2 get to bring me a knife. Then I asked where the restroom was and she ignor d me. The food came out slower than usual and the wait was long!!! More than 45 min."
Frank R.,"Visalia, CA",0,16,42,5.0,7/14/2017,"Believe it or not it was our first time eating here.  Believe me I will be back.  We had a party of eight and an infant, walk in no reservation.  The hostess lady was super sweet in accommodating us (wish I got her name).  Early dinner rush and was seated within 20 mins.  Our server Patrick was super helpful and patient being there was so many of us (3 adults + 3 teenagers + 2 littlest and don't forget the baby!). Superb service !!  But when tried to tell the Asian floor manager what a good job he was doing he was very curt, and seemed to be trying to rush us off by asking if we were having dessert (which Patrick already took of).  4 people had salmon (a salad, a plate, & 2 kids salmon) nobody was disappointed!!  I had the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp with brown rice.  Delicious! Could've had a little more sauce but all in all it was good..   we were kinda celebrating my little ones b day, they brought sundaes with candles and sang to the both of them. Of course we finished up with cheesecake somebody had hazelnut I had the Hershey's cheesecake..  man oh man I'm thinking next time just stop for the dessert alone!! $8 for a huge slice can't go wrong ...  thanks Patrick !!!!!"
Patty R.,"Los Osos, CA",125,101,17,4.0,5/28/2017,"I came here twice in one weekend, so will review both experiences. I came into town for a big women's motorcycle weekend earlier this month and was meeting an old colleague I had not seen in years there after I rode into town and was staying at hotel a few blocks away. We met for lunch. We were seated quickly. Since she picked me up, I indulged in a refreshing pina colada. I may have had two..they were good. I was not super hungry, so ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. I was very impressed at the presentation. Fresh, vibrant ingredients to assemble the wraps. It had chicken satay pieces, carrots, noodles, sprouts and a few other things I forgot. Also came with three sauces..one was a peanut sauce..and two chili sauces..everything was flavorful. I ate some and packed up the rest which became a late night snack in my hotel room! Two days later after alot of motorcycle riding, I decided I would have brunch before I started the long ride home. It was a Sunday around noon. I was on my motorcycle and had to circle around the parking area a few times. They rope off a large section of parking in front of the restaurant next door to offer valet service. That was a bit annoying. I lucked out as someone pulled out of a spot in back! I decided to just sit in the high tables in the bar rather than wait for a regular table. It is open seating in bar. I had my motorcycle gear and helmet so was nice to get a table with extra chairs.  I decided on the fried chicken and waffles. So glad I did! Delicious from start to finish. It was chicken tenders, perfectly battered..light and crispy and tender meat. The small waffle sections were perfectly light and had a little crisp to them as well. The home fry potatoes, which I usually hate at every restaurant that comes with a breakfast were GREAT. Just what I like. These were smaller bits of potato..I am not sure how they prepare them but was almost like they twice fried them...they were not greasy..but all perfectly crunchy and crispy. The dish came with maple butter to pour over the waffles...YUM! I am glad I do not live that close..I would be there every weekend and quickly weigh 400lbs eating that every weekend! I ordered a virgin pina colada..I loved it the day before, but this time I was riding and left out the alcohol. Perfect with the dish...love from start to finish!!"
Ximena S.,"Manhattan, NY",10,8,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Four of us Visalians happened to be in Fresburg early this evening,and visited your establishment in that beehive called Fashion Faire. Perhaps your cheesecake is very good-don't know.    The three others in our party found their meals passable ,if over priced;but the fish 'n chips i had might be described as mediocre at a third the price; way more potato fries than the five or so little hunks of dry fish. Certainly my first& last visit there;kudos to your server crew ,though. Lots & lots of better places to go.  Georg S."
Marta I.,"Sunland, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/3/2017,"We were in Fresno for a Foo Fighters concert and coming from Los Angeles, we were in a hurry to catch a quick bite before the concert. We sat in the bar area and told the waitress we were in a hurry. To our surprise we were served so quickly we were out of there within 30 minutes. Needless to say service is outstanding and the food is great! Recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal."
Noel C.,"Clovis, CA",43,286,1057,4.0,8/27/2016,Huge menu sometimes too overwhelming lol but food is always good sometimes better than others but never bad. Every cheesecake flavor is delicious. Try the brunch menu on Sundays!
Tony H.,"Clovis, CA",0,11,4,2.0,2/24/2017,"This review is more on the drinks then it is the food (which tasted great) so short story, a group of us go in for a birthday dinner, we end up buying 4 rounds 8 shots of patron, i figured they would be semi pricey, but holy crap, 15 dollars per chilled shots? 3 dollars more then just regular shots, which btw were not even shots at all, im so disappointed in your pricing, please give the right amount of liquor, if you're  going to mark it up so high, ill always come back for the food, but the drinks on the other hand...you're better off going next door to the competition."
