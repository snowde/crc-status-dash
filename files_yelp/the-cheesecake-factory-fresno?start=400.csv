mark a.,"Mountain View, CA",0,9,7,5.0,5/23/2010,"The best CF location hands down. Service is top notch, and the food is at its best. We're from the Bay Area, where other locations suffer in service and food quality.  Our server was the best and was always attentive to our needs and quick to provide service. Our daughter received a generous complimentary plate of sliced bread and banana slices to start our dining experience. The rest did not disappoint. The fried zucchini was the best in quality and taste, not soggy at all. The other dishes we usually order including spicy ahi tempura rolls were the best.  Overall an oasis from the heat in Fresno. One of the best dining experiences ever."
Nick A.,"Fresno, CA",216,251,505,3.0,11/28/2009,"I know it's popular to hate on this place, hell even my mom talks shit on it (besides their cheesecake,) but it's still the best affordable place to eat within Fashion Fair. If you give me a choice between here and BJ's next door, I'll pick this place 10:1.  I used to come here quite often when a friend of mine used to work at Bebe in Fashion Fair. The two of us would sometimes do their lunch specials, or order one of their gigantic salads that would feed the both of us with leftover- and I'm 200+ lbs with a huge appetite. Yeah, most of their food is a little overpriced, but when 2 people can get full off of a $10 salad, you can't go wrong.  Haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory since those days, so I don't know if it's changed at all. As it stands, it's consistently better than the shitty BJ's and is the quick lunch spot of choice by most Fashion Fair workers."
Terry G.,"Atwater, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/19/2013,"Horrible experience!  My daughter and I stopped to celebrate her having given two speeches today as a 'Hero of Hope' for the American Cancer Society.  She is a cancer survivor.  It was nice out so we sat in the patio dining area only to have to endure second-hand smoke from another customer who said she was given 'permssion'' to smoke out there.  I checked with the manager, Brian Rodriguez, and he said it was ok.  Really?"
Trisha R.,"Fresno-High, CA",0,18,6,5.0,5/7/2012,"When it comes to service and friendliness in this town, Cheesecake Factory takes the top prize! NEVER have  I had a bad experience. They're always so great. I highly recommend their Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, the Dynamite Shrimp, and Fried Zucchini. YUM! :) Also, don't be scared to ask for more bread, they'll be happy to bring it to you, though they might offer it to you before hand because they're awesome like that! :)"
Chelsea F.,"Lemoore, CA",0,7,,4.0,2/5/2012,"My first experience with this specific Cheesecake factory location was incredible! I only ordered the lunch pizza, but it was amazing. The salad was tasty and my Hawaiian pizza was SOOOOOOO YUMMMYYYY!!! My waiter was extremely kind to us. I had to breast feed my 10 week old and he was so kind about it and not hovering our table too much. Our food was incredible! My second experience wasn't as great as the first. I ordered the same dish on my prior visit hoping to get the same taste, but I was wrong. I asked for no onions and once my dish came it was swarmed of onions. The waitress did notice and did tell the kitchen about it. And we ended up not having to pay for my dish! Yay! Overall, I still love this place :)"
Gary L.,"Oakland, CA",3,43,30,1.0,1/14/2014,"It took 2 FREAKIN HOURS to serve the food plus 30 minutes to wait in line. When i finally ordered my So called ""Cheesecake"" AFTER 3 HOURS it was just crumbled up bits with ""Cream Cheese icing"" and chocolate chips. And the food was just ok. So, Overall there is no point of ordering this stuff at a crowded place that takes a long time to serve ok food and crappy ""cheesecake""."
WH K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,,3.0,7/30/2012,"They forgot to sing happy birthday to my little cousin after I reminded them twice! The bread was cold! Godiva cheesecake is the best!! Food is good, service not so much"
Elizabeth H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",22,182,24,5.0,1/11/2012,"I was here the other day at 11am and had a wonderful time! Very quiet when they first open, so perfect if you want to have some coffee, a light snack, and maybe get some work done. I totally busted out the laptop. My server, Jacob, was awesome-- attentive, friendly, but left me my space. I'll totally come here again, and I loved the crab cakes!"
Pedro F.,"Fresno, CA",0,29,,4.0,10/23/2011,"this place hasn't failed me yet not too pricey, big portions, big flavor best thing on the menu hands down is the grilled shrimp and bacon club the chicken and biscuits, kobe burger, ahi tartare and bbq salmon are also very good oh and of course.. what their restaurant is named after... their cheesecake they're all pretty good but my favorite one would probably be the fresh strawberry simple and not overbearing"
Marcos S.,"Fresno, CA",0,42,8,5.0,6/1/2014,"Every burger I've had here has left me thinking, that was a damn good burger. They might make the best burger out of everybody. I had a few pasta dishes here to and they were delicious. The cheesecake I've gotten here was excellent and the only thing I have to say bad about this place is that the parking and wait sucks. But you can always valet and hit the bar while you wait so it's really all good."
Torn S.,"Visalia, CA",3,19,,4.0,10/25/2011,"Hot waitresses, good food, nice looking restaurant."
Anne B.,"Merced, CA",286,325,7,5.0,8/13/2011,"Great lunch experience!  After being dissed by an unnamed brewhouse down the road, my fiancee and I headed to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  We were greeted immediately and seated in a giant booth.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  I got the pear endive salad and he got the chicken chipotle pasta.  We enjoyed frequent drink refills.  I thought my salad was huge and tasty.  His pasta was a little too spicy.  Bathrooms are clean and dimly lit, but that was fine.  Lemon raspberry cheesecake was delish!  Just as good as a Cheesecake Factory in the bay.  We will be back!!"
Isaac H.,"San Francisco, CA",45,523,459,5.0,4/7/2012,Love this restaurant and this location. Because the food is good. Also my fist time here. I only had to wait ten minutes before I got a seat at a booth.
Lisa G.,"Clovis, CA",2,13,1,5.0,12/28/2011,"Everything was great, grill salmond , avocado rolls and new york steak are all yumm"
Jeremy M.,"Fresno, CA",21,70,,3.0,4/8/2012,"Again a mediocre attempt at real food in Fresno.  The cheesecakes are great as I would expect..but for some reason the restaurant is too large and it feels strange.  But the service was acceptable, but I want more.."
Carlton W.,"Hanford, CA",101,11,,4.0,7/30/2013,very good food and wait time is normal for a good place. the wait staff are very good and if you like cheese cake they have about two dozen types of cheese cake about $7-8 a slice.
Doug S.,"Modesto, CA",30,92,,5.0,12/11/2009,"A great dining experience. They menu is like a book. If you find yourself in Fresno--besides asking yourself what you did to end up there--be sure to visit this restaurant. The service is not top notch, but this isn't the kind of place that needs excellent service to thrive. It is expensive compared to similar establishments, but you'll probably agree that it is worth it. I've only had the chance to try a few of the cheesecakes, and all have been awesome."
Tan V.,"Fresno, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/1/2014,"This place is very big. The tables are close to each others which I didnt' like. I would like a little more privacy than 3 inches apart from other people. The menu is very extensive and I feel that it is a downfall. Restaurants with 8 pages front and back menus are not great in my opinion. I was in shock with what they had from mexican, italiant, burgers, bbq, salads, sandwiches, and asian food there. I didn't know what to think this restaurant was or what is their specialty. I know it is cheesecake but their food variety was too much. The quality wasn't as great and if they had a smaller menu it probably would be better quality food but it's a chain restaurant anyways. Happy hours are always great at cheesecake but I wouldn't come here to eat."
Meryl C.,"Stockton, CA",274,265,152,5.0,7/9/2013,"I usually hesitate to visit any CF because the wait is notoriously long... but I really wanted to have lunch there today (and cheesecake of course!!), so we did! I'm always looking out for places that are child friendly, since my two toddlers get distracted very easily. We were seated right away (four adults and two children) and they kindly placed our stroller out of the way. Our server Juan was very courteous and attentive. When I placed my order for the Factory Burger he made sure to point out that it was not the traditional burger, but one on a french bread baguette. Though I read it in the description, I appreciated that he took the time to make sure I was going to get what I wanted. We also ordered a kids macaroni and cheese (obviously not from a box! and tasty!!) and chicken tacos. Everything was delicious, and surprisingly fast! I ordered a red velvet cheesecake to come out with the food and it was the first to arrive.. no worries, my son was more than excited to have some ""birthday cake"" as he called it. My overall lunch experience was great, I was really surprised and how fast everything came out and how nice everyone was. Great example of how a restaurant should be! I hope that all my visits are like this in the future!"
Jon C.,"Glen Ellen, CA",0,131,,1.0,1/27/2012,"I've dined several times at the Cheesecake Factory locations in Santa Clara, Mission Viejo and San Francisco.  Like most reviewers, I appreciate the large, varied menu - everything from sandwiches to elegant dishes - and the very good cheesecake.  The food is consistently above-average to very good.  Most Cheesecake Factory restaurants are crowded and noisy.  I've dined at the Fresno location once and felt that the food and surroundings were consistent with the others that I had visited. Two weeks before Christmas, I went to the Fresno location - at mid-afternoon - to buy a cheesecake as a gift.  I waited five minutes at the counter while dining orders were filled and the mostly college-aged waitresses exchanged idle chatter.  When finally served, I asked if they had a 7"" pumpkin (seasonal) cheesecake.  I was told ""absolutely"" and the server charged my credit card  for the cheesecake.  Another server went ""into the back"" to get the cheesecake.  Ten minutes (no exaggeration) later, she returned to tell me they didn't have what I had ordered.  The first server went ""into the back"" to double check.  Ten minutes later, she returned to confirm that they only had a 10"" cheesecake. I reluctantly agreed to purchase the larger cheesecake and handed over my VISA card.  The server charged my card for the full price of the second cake and I asked why she didn't just charge the difference between the two cheesecakes.  I received the typical ""deer in the headlight"" look of confusion.  The shift manager was called over to explain that they would cancel the first charge.  Fast forward two weeks: checked my VISA transactions and, you guessed it, I got charged for both cheesecakes.  Seven phone calls to four different people to get a refund of the first cheesecake.   Forty-five minutes to purchase a cheesecake is ridiculous.  Others have told me of similar experience at this location - I know of several patrons that walked out when they were ignored after being seated.   I've since eaten at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but the Fresno location really doesn't need my business."
