David G.,"Clovis, CA",55,34,59,4.0,8/18/2011,"The Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad was great.  Be sure to order this entree with the dressing on the side. In the past, it has come out over-saturated.  The passion ice-tea was great.  The service was average . . . nice guy, but a little robotic and awkward.  According to our server, they are rolling out a new healthier menu with some vegetarian options. That should be interesting.  Overall, a good night at Cheesecake."
Juliette K.,"Roseville, CA",0,108,2,1.0,6/28/2013,The service was more than 5 star. The food was very good BUT two of us who had the same entree (the special with fish) both became very sick after dinner. We couldn't have picked up whatever it was anywhere else because we had not seen each other for several days.  It was classic food poisoning. Yuck. I wouldn't have expected it from The Cheesecake Factory.
Ting L.,"Fresno, CA",2,3,9,3.0,12/7/2011,"Fast and friendly servers. Their waiters and waitress are very knowledgeable about the food they offer their and make great suggestions, but the lighting is very dim and sometimes long wait time. That's why it makes it a 3 start rating."
Krystle W.,"Fowler, CA",13,19,,5.0,8/12/2011,YUM! My new fav dish is the wassabi crusted Ahi tuna. Its pretty pricey but once you have it you forget about the price. AH-Mazing!!!!!!
Hal Z.,"San Jose, CA",22,34,18,2.0,11/3/2011,"Slow service. Main meal came before the appetizer, but they didnt add it to the check."
Kate P.,"Grants Pass, OR",89,284,100,3.0,6/8/2009,"Food - 3.5 stars. I had chicken over spinach pasta with spinach leaves on top - chicken was very tender and delicious! Pasta was plentiful and not too greasy. Spinach leaves were too bitter.  Service - 3.5 stars. The waiter was very friendly, fast, courteous, but tended to talk too much.  Prices - 3.5 stars. Very reasonable for the humongous portions you get! Atmosphere - 2 stars. All the wait staff were in too much hurry, even though there were plenty of open tables. Everyone seemed a bit stressed. The biggest downer was the fact that we didn't get a booth and ended up sitting in a section where tables are so close together that you feel like you are sitting at the same table as your neighbors and participating in their conversation! If you go here, PLEASE get a booth!"
Jason C.,"Fresno, CA",60,3,,4.0,12/4/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory. It's located outside of Fashion Fair Mall. They play toned down jazz music, and have a large selection of all kinds of food which is generally delicious. So is their cheesecake. It is a long wait if there is a large group but for a smaller group it takes about 20 minutes. It is a very relaxing dining experience."
E M.,"Oxnard, CA",79,15,64,1.0,8/16/2008,"NEVER ORDER TAKE OUT FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! okay, my mom and i wanted take out from cheesecake because we didn't want to sit down over there and eat.  so i called the place for take out for the first time. it was HORRBILE. i didn't even get to order! some lady answered and asked if i'd like to have the food brought to my car or if i wanted to pick it up at the bakery. i told her her i wanted to pick it up at the bakery and she asked me to hold on so i said, ""alright."" sooooo.. THIRTEEN MINUTES later i hung up because no one helped me. LAAAAME."
Jessica H.,"Orangevale, CA",299,399,213,4.0,1/9/2011,"Had brunch today at Cheesecake Factory, my first brunch experience here and I have to say I was quite delighted! First of all, we had great service. For our party of seven we were able to order our drinks as we arrived and for the two babies at our table they brought a plate of bread and sliced bananas. I had the eggs benedict with spinach, bacon and tomato which came with a side of sliced tomatoes (or choice of breakfast potatoes). The portion was generous and I can't get over how good the spinach was. Yummmm yumm."
Sheila C.,"Fresno, CA",388,361,,4.0,1/4/2009,SO its good but nothing splendid. The food is pretty good  and you get so much food that you can pretty much share one plate with whomever you go with. I like eating here and the service is always really good. The decor is really nice pretty much like all other cheesecake factories. I mainly come here for dessert of course the cheesecake is great!  I like the bar too...drink prices are a little higher but nothing outrageous. well made drinks and a nice looking bar.
M L.,"Bass Lake, CA",4,67,67,3.0,4/6/2011,"I ate here last night for dinner. Food was nothing special. I think food quality has decreased at this chain over the years. I had Cajun chicken littles....way over cooked. Wife had a chicken avocado sandwich and there was so much tomato on it that the sandwich was mushy and couldn't stay together. Waitress seemed to serve us as an afterthought like whenever she wasn't "" busy "" with her other one customer. So service was a bit lacking. Probably will go back......eventually."
Nicole S.,"Modesto, CA",22,175,2,5.0,11/6/2008,"I wish there was a Cheesecake Factory closer to me.  It's just not fair. I'll concur that prices for app's and drinks are steep, but I thought the entrees and desserts were a good value for what you get. The portions are huge, and the cheesecake is ridiculous. White chocolate macadamia?  OMG!   Loved the decor and the service also.  Will be back next time I'm in Fresno."
Olga C.,"Fresno, CA",0,17,,4.0,12/12/2010,"I went there again last week. Over all I have been here 5-7 times this year. Every time we go we try a different plate. The food is really good & reasonably priced. The cheese cake has always been great. I would give it five stars but parking isn't good, hard to find a spot, & it's really loud in there. It's hard to carry on a conversation with your party. Will return again it's a good place to eat."
Mike M.,"Carmel, CA",121,281,290,2.0,2/25/2007,"Alert! This is going to be a bitch session.  If whining and complaining is not something you want to read then avert your eyes. First the plus and why I gave it more than one star, the interior looked like the inside of the Rosicrucian (Egyptian) Museum in San Jose. It is cavernous and impressive, the music is acceptable so the first impression was nice. The menu, I mean the physical menu was dirty.  All of the menus were smudged and dirty.  I figured it was an aberration and didn't give it too much thought.  We combed through the diverse offerings and asked for two appetizers, the ""calamari"" and the ""Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls"".  The calamari was cold and this was the theme for all the food from then on. My wife tried the Miso Salmon with snap peas on a bed of white rice. The salmon was too fishy and there were 5 (FIVE) total snow peas on the plate plus the dish was cold! I had the Kobe beef hamburger and the cheese was not melted.  Imagine a $12 burger on an over toasted bun with un-melted cheese accompanied by lukewarm fries.  Are you kidding me? Eldest son had the club sandwich and his palette is OK with lukewarm fries so he had no complaints. Birthday boy turning 14 today had an atrocious dish called ""crispy pork tenderloin"" with mac and cheese.  This was pure crap on a plate!  First the dinner came after the rest of us were halfway through our meal.  The macaroni and cheese tasted like a Campbell's Soup product and swear to God the meat was nothing more than a COLD country fried steak. W. T. F. was that garbage?  My water was not refilled one time.  Hello! While waiting for our meal I could not help but notice the floor in our section of the dining room was dirty. Food from who knows how many party's before was in piles under an empty table next to us.  When a party was seated there they did  not notice.  I felt sorry for them, I felt sorry for us too, who knows how much bacteria has accumulated over the days and weeks on those seats, tables and menus.   You know what I thought about?  I immediately thought of what crawls around this place over night Ala a NYC KFC/Taco Bell!  It was a Sunday so obviously the weekend ""B"" management was in charge so I can see how it can be lax but I think this cleanliness issue goes deeper, it's institutional, it's the culture at this location. We should have given the $100.00 we spent to one of the homeless freeway exit beggars on 41 and Shaw and gone to McDonald's. It would have been money better spent. Oh and Cheesecake Factory bigwigs.  You can reach me at mikeswebmail (at) g mail (dot) com if you want my perspective in further detail. Lastly, I am getting fed-the-eff up with the poor quality of food service in this city in general.  I can't put my finger on why but I have a few thoughts.  Fresno is not a city known for cuisine.  Sure there are professionals to be found here and there (none come to mind immediately, {maybe Mimi's}) but I think it has to do with the culture here.  No one expects details in service and presentation. From now on my Yelp reviews will not mention how hot or cold food is, I give in.  Fresno food is not served hot.  I have to accept this and give in.  As long as I choose to live here and decide to eat out instead of cook I will have to accept cold food.  Five more years to go and I can move.  I can't take this anymore!"
wally s.,"Wofford Heights, CA",0,22,,5.0,9/30/2010,Went to Resturaunt on the way to a Zac Brown Concert. Was surprised with the decor. Very elaborate to be on the edge of a Mall. We had great service and food. I had their Stake Diane & Shrimp Scampi combo and my wife had a pasta dish. Plenty of food with excellent flavor. We ordered cheescake but had to take it home with us. We were to full to eat it.
Alicia Y.,"Irvine, CA",14,25,,2.0,8/14/2006,"We went here after my sister's graduation from Fresno State and I was very disappointed by the service. I think the waitress noticed my annoyance and tried to make it up by being extra nice and coming every possible minute she had available to come check on us, which was not the brightest idea.  We had waited for over an hour and it wasn't until after everyone else, who came after us, got seated that they asked if it was okay to seat us outside when I specifically said that we would sit anywhere there was seating - not to mention there was sooo much room outside when we got there. It would have made me less irritated if they had informed us that they were still working on getting us seated instead of making us sit in agony while people kept passing us by. Cheesecake Factory has never failed me in the food, so I got to give it credit for that... It is definitely NOT the place to go if you have 6 people and there is even the slightest line, chances are that those with 2-4 people will be seated before you. NOTE: If it wasn't because my sister insisted on going to Cheesecake for her graduation dinner, I would have left way before that third time I had to get up to ask if we were invisible"
K. A. R.,"Clovis, CA",17,321,,2.0,5/9/2007,"Blah. We arrived early  on a Tuesday evening (5ish), yet had to wait ten minutes to be seated even though we could see a few empty tables. The restaurant was cold, and I mean really cold. We would have sat outside, but it was one of the blistering summer afternoons. I was shivering throughout the meal, and my friend had to go out to her car to get an extra blanket for her baby. We complained, but it never got any warmer in our area of the restaurant. Our food wasn't hot, like it had sat next to a stream of cold air for a few minutes. My chicken dish wasn't anything to write home about. I much prefer it when restaurants develop a specialty and stick with it. Chicken pie joints that make to die for chicken pies and little else. Pho restaurants that make killer pho and don't try to branch out into pizza. Cheesecake Factory should stick to cheesecake and leave other food alone."
Candace D.,"Friant, CA",0,15,,3.0,7/29/2012,"Love this food! Weird because last night they brought our main dinner before the appetizer salads. No apology, and when I cancelled my salad because I already had my dinner, the waitress acted very strangely the rest of the night. It must be an anomaly though."
Foodfanatic W.,"Fresno, CA",39,47,2,5.0,9/6/2012,"Love the food, love the service, love the atmosphere (works with family and romantic evening out). Consistently great!! Everything I've ever tried in all the 12 yrs of eating at Cheesecake has been FABULOUS. I know not everyone is a fan (why I will never understand) but this is definitely my go to for a fix!"
Nicole E.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,215,60,4.0,10/23/2007,"I know that people aren't crazy about the Cheesecake Factory. Its a chain, blah blah blah.  I don't care!  I love it!  I love the idea of it, I love the food, I love the drinks, I love the lemonade and I love the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake! I have eaten so many things on this menu I can't even tell you.  They've revamped it recently and took off one of my favorite things the Fried Chicken Salad.  However, I have discovered the Buffalo Blasts and my new favorite salad the BLT Salad which is their take on my favorite Blue Cheese Wedge. I did spend $35 all by myself which is pretty insane, but its not like I'm gonna eat their every night.... ;-)"
