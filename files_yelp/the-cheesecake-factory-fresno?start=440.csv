Rakayla M.,"Madera, CA",1,58,4,5.0,6/15/2010,Really good pasta! I also like the Cobb salad and the BBQ chicken ranch salad!
Jim T.,"Fresno, CA",136,90,1,4.0,9/9/2012,"I do not come here often, and I don't k ow why.  The service was great.  Very pleased.  The food was good.  I would definitely come back here."
Christine P.,"Fresno, CA",33,98,11,3.0,3/15/2010,"I would give 3 and a half stars if I could.  We are regular diners here, usually Sunday late mornings for brunch/lunch. At this time, there is never a wait. We always take our two young children, and the restaurant staff is ALWAYS accomodating. They store our stroller for us, bring out a little plate with sliced bananas and bread slices for them and covered plastic cups. For this, I am grateful, because it keeps them occupied until the food comes out. The drinks are outstanding. Try their mojito. Usually the food is very consistent. We have our few favorites on the menu, including the avocado egg rolls, shrimp bistro pasta, chicken littles, jambalaya. The quality is a bit inconsistent as of late. For example, my husband's jambalaya noodles were way too soft and my hashbrowns were way overcooked--dark brown and hard. The cheesecakes are always outstanding, however. My current favorites are Red Velvet and White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut. Yes, they're as good as they sound. Too bad they post the calorie count. We will keep coming back, thanks to the variety on the menu and the family friendly atmosphere. I'm glad that Fresno has the dining option of Cheesecake Factory."
Lucio O.,"Clovis, CA",11,69,61,2.0,11/28/2009,"Ok, so I went here with high expectations and left in utter dissapointment. First of all the seating in this place is horrible. It's as if I was sitting on someones lap next to me. Not to mention I got to sit and listen to the woman next me complain about life.  That alone ruined the experience. That was not the only downfall. You get a menu and it's huge. Sometimes too many choices is a bad thing. The food was subpar. The service was slow and inconsistant. The only brite spot was the cheesecake, but that alone is not enough for me to make a return visit."
Huana P.,"Laguna Beach, CA",62,265,2,4.0,10/23/2007,"This Cheesecake Factory is in the new Fashion Fair Mall off Shaw in Fresno.  I went for the Happy Hour (4-6 pm) where the appetizers are super cheap.  You have to sit in the bar area, but don't worry, if you don't drink alcohol, they don't mind.   Our waiter was exceptionally friendly and accomodating.  Armando.  This guy is awesome!  He gave us fast and friendly service.  First came the hot and fresh sourdough baguette, with the honey wheat bran baguette.  Yum.  Then came the chopped salad which was light and tasty.  The dressing was not ranch based (thank goodness).  Then we got the avocado egg rolls, which were tasty and delicious.  The avocado and chicken were wrapped in a Chinese type egg roll paper and fried.  The dressing was delicious.  A hint of ginger and soy sauce?  Then we got the Thai lettuce wraps with the chili sauce, peanut sauce and sweet sauce.  Yum. I was most impressed by our friendly waiter, Armando.  He told us no bleu cheese in the chopped salad was no problem.  When we asked for boxes, he asked us if we wanted FRESH bread (instead of the bread on our tables) to go.  Man, this guy deserves a raise! Total price for 3 appetizers?  $13.  Cheap!!  This place is a steal for Happy Hour."
Bri R.,"Fresno-High, CA",19,37,15,3.0,6/30/2010,"I frequent the Cheesecake Factory about once a week because they have the best drinks and dessert!  I'm totally smitten over their Georgia Peach and Chocolate Banana drinks (although their a bit pricey, starting at about $9.50 each).  Plus, the Red Velvet Cheesecake is a must try for all chocolate lovers :-) As for the food, I hardly ever go for dinner but judging from the times I've actually eaten there I can tell you the food is simply mediocre."
Angela L.,"Sacramento, CA",2,8,,3.0,9/20/2009,The food was decent both visits. It sucks paying with debit there tho cuz they have AUTOMATIC tipping at the end of the tab that you have to pay and that really annoyed me when the food is already overpriced...  And what's with the cheap floral airbrushing slash Egyptian slash rustic look?! Eh.
Angie B.,"Fresno, CA",1,15,,5.0,2/3/2013,"Nice place, nice people working there, great food- I always get the same thing, the shrimp and bacon club sandwich, it's awesome! You should try it next time."
Jen T.,"Fresno, CA",130,213,28,4.0,9/24/2009,"this is definitely a good place to go if everyone you're with wants something different. their salmon rolls are so delicious. the dipping sauce it comes with really makes the whole dish. their cuban sandwich is probably one of the best restaurant sandwiches i've eaten. another favorite is the garlic noodles with chicken. and their chocolate cake is...omg...so good. but if you want to feel like you're eating a lighter cheesecake, go for the banana cream cheesecake. i mean i'm sure it has loads of fat in it, but it really feels like you're eating light. one really bad thing about it is the lighting. makes me too sleepy."
Timothy O.,"San Diego, CA",136,576,,3.0,7/29/2007,"I can't believe I'm giving one of the highest reviews for yet another chain casual dining restaurant in Fresno. Granted, I didn't have dinner but my friends seemed to like the food. The portions are too large for even a glutton. Seriously, each plate could have fed a family of four. I had coffee and dessert, and the ice cream brownie sundae was monstrous. The plate was twelve inches wide and filled with brownie, ice cream and whipped cream. If I had finished it, I would have needed insulin... and probably oxygen... and a ride home. It was tasty though, though it was a waste of half a dessert."
stephanie a.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,76,23,2.0,1/24/2011,worst cheesecake ive been too. the servers are not up to par to other cheesecakes ive been to. food was ok. they murdered the unsweetened green tea that i love so much.
Randy B.,"Fresno, CA",3,97,,5.0,5/16/2011,"Get their early and your wait will be short.  Very well run restaurant.  Waiter was friendly and very efficient.  When they wife had a question, he couldn't answer he went to the kitchen and promptly returned with the answer.  It is a little expensive, but look around at all the people working.  Place is really run well, and the cheese cake - while very expensive is always excellent."
Sheng V.,"Clovis, CA",22,67,,3.0,11/13/2009,"Cheesecake factory is overrated in my opinion, although the cheesecakes here are very good.  The food however, just doesn't quite meet my standards for this kind of restaurant.  I once ordered a salad here that by the time it came out to me, it was so drenched in it's own dressing that the greens were LIMP.  I've never returned a meal back to the kitchen and not pay for it but in this case I did.  The server tried telling me that for that particular salad I had ordered, the salad is supposed to be drenched and the greens, soggy.  A SOGGY salad?!  Come on now, it was an Asian salad and I've eaten Asian salads all my life!  However, their pasta selections here aren't too shabby."
Gordon Y.,"Clovis, CA",0,18,,3.0,6/18/2011,"This cheesecake factory in the Fashion Fair Mall is fine.  The major problem is parking, unless you're fine with paying $6.00 for valet parking.  We had five people in our party and the hostess' immediately seated us in a booth. The booth may be a challenge for larger size people, but for us, it was fine.  All but one of us had their hamburger which was cooked properly and tasted fine, but paying $10.95 for a basic cheeseburger is a bit irrational.  Their menu touts using only angus or kobe beef, but I can't taste the difference between their burger and one from McDonald's.  Their menu is way too extensive and I wonder if they can do justice to all of their dishes."
Victoria B.,"Turlock, CA",7,121,9,4.0,2/24/2009,"Ok, yes, it's a little cheesy. But WHO CARES? The food here is sooo good and their cheesecake SO delicious. They have GODIVA chocolate and have a gazillion other varieties of cheesecake.If you have never had breakfast there it is just delicious. The breakfast style Monte Cristo sandwich just melts in your mouth, delicious. If there is a chain I ALWAYS make and exception for it's Cheesecake Factory!"
Fatty A.,"San Francisco, CA",233,1805,12,2.0,12/7/2008,Ive been to multiple cheesecake factorys all over the United States of America and this is the worst one in the United States of America.  The spinach dip was good but the Lau Salad was really small here.  I am fat so I go here for large portions.  The large won ton skins were the usual size but there was no salad.  WTF?  It was an anorexic $20 salad.  Not good.  The flank steak I ordered was over seasoned with salt and pepper.  I had some fatty farts that night.  The manatee still smells like my gas.  I am cheap so I ordered the cheesecakes to go at the take out place.  The only good thing about this place is there isn't a 2 hour wait for 2 people.  Woot!
Nancy A.,"Coronado, CA",98,6,,2.0,5/19/2013,"First I want to say I am and have been a huge fan of CCF for the last 20 some years. I have been to many different locations up and down the state of CA for many different occasions and it has always been outstanding. This time, which was probably the most important occasion to date, CCF was not up to par.  It was to celebrate our daughter's college graduation.  The hostess and manager messed up big time. My daughter  called the restaurant weeks in advance for a reservation for a party of 12 and she was told everything would be ready for us for a 11:30 reservation. Parking and traffic were horrible but we got in at 11:35 and when we checked in according to the hostess our table for 12 was given away without any courtesy phone call to see if we were still coming. We were under the assumption that we had a at least a 5 to 7 minute window of grace to still get our table.  On the other hand, there have been many occassions that a reseved table has not been ready at the appointed time. When they told us we had a 45 minute wait or so..I kept asking why when we had a reservation and we were only minutes later than 11:30. The manager responded ""we just got to keep things going"" and the hostess was incredibly rude by letting us know we were late and too bad....so sad but they gave our table away to another big party. It was so disheartening, so as I am trying to understand this..I am telling members of my party that they ""gave our table away"". The manager was very upset with that terminology and told me to stop saying we gave your table away. I said..but you did!  My sense was the hostess staff and manager handled it all in poor form..however once we sat down, out waitress and the food was very good...but the pre-treatment was not necessary and created what should have been an amazing family event to a less than positive tone. They need to get their customer relations up to par."
Bambi K.,"Fresno, CA",233,130,45,2.0,1/26/2009,"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is for the service.  We were seated quick and the waitress was amazing--however, the food had so much to be desired! My son had some pasta with chichen, I had a salad. The salad was better -- but over kill.  Sometimes too much garlic can kill the dish.  BOTH dishes were smoothered in it. Augh!  We left carrying our doggie bags full of leftovers that went in the garbage. The cheese cake isn't as good as Tahoe Joe's. Sorry chain food cheese cake place...just don't live up to the hype!"
Patrick T.,"Clovis, CA",109,65,20,4.0,3/8/2008,"I've been here two time, the first time we went because it was new to the area and it was very expensive you can stand to spend close to $50 for two people.  The second time I went here because I had a gift certificate but still had to pay close to $20 out of my own pocket and the bill was close to $70 for two adults and two kids.  This last time we went we ordered the nachos with the fixings, and a sushi appetizer, then we ordered two cheesecakes.  You can't go here without ordering a Cheesecake.  The problem is deciding which one to have.  That's the only reason to go here.  But I should also add that the portions on all their dishes are extremely huge."
Antonio P.,"Fresno, CA",0,9,,4.0,3/26/2012,"This is a good choice for family dining, my kids love it more than me (they give it a five star) yes it is always full on a Friday evening and there is a 30-45 min wait but it's because they are so successful. We spent $75 for family of four with appetizers and kids meals (they are huge!) and two cheesecakes (each slice is good for 2 people or even 3)- this seems reasonable. They have petite appetizers which are anything but petite (beware! you will end up boxing half of your entree if you order one) and suprisingly delicious (recommend the vietnamese tacos) and well presented. It is so hard to find good appetizers in Fresno, tired of the same old cheese fingers, nachos and onion rings. The entrees are nothing great and are enormous- I recommend you feed on appetizers instead, or you can share an entree. I wish they had more lighting at the tables. We bring a flashlight to read through the long menu"
