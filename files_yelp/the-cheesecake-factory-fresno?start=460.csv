eva r.,"Fresno, CA",44,45,,5.0,4/16/2008,"the best cheese cake ever in fresno, unless you make it yourself. buy a slice or take home a whole pie. you can set outside in there patio, right out side the mall, and enjoy the weather or the walk. very beautiful scenery. thumps up for this one."
ifood f.,"Fresno, CA",0,17,,2.0,11/7/2008,Typical Chain!  Had an Pasta dish that was over seasoned and tasted only of garlic.  Service was non existent.  Ordered our drinks and food and the server was never seen again.  Even the busboy (or some other server) delivered the check at the end.
Some O.,"Fresno, CA",0,18,,1.0,5/21/2007,This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. We waited for about an hour even though there wasn't even that many people in line. The food was horrible and cold. I ordered the lemon chicken it tasted like boiled chicken with some watered down sauce. We only poked at the food for about five minutes then asked for the check and to-go boxes. The waitress asked if everything was OK and seemed concerned but we didn't complain (we threw the food away once we got home). Didn't even get to try dessert but oh well it's just not worth going back for.
