Selena N.,"Fresno, CA",52,174,228,4.0,10/23/2016,"I come here often! I've gotten great service every time! I love to come during lunch or happy hour. Their lunch specials are great! I love ordering the half salads. Its a big portion size and the quality is great. I would rather pay $12/$13 dollars for their lunch salads than going other places where the salads are just minimal (iceberg, chicken, and dressing) and close in price. I rotate between the Santa Fe and BBQ chicken salad (dressing on the side) love the happy hour as well!"
Aubrey P.,"Clovis, CA",439,4,1,2.0,9/17/2017,"Over priced. 2 people with regular meals for dinner which were hardly average. Plus 1 slice of cheesecake...smores cheesecake which I had chose as my desert before i even had any idea what I was going to have for dinner and what I had thought would be the highlight of my night and sounded to die for.....which turned out to be very disappointing and just as our dinner, my dessert turned out to be barely mediocre at best. Used to absolutely love this place 4-5 years ago, now all the prices have went up yet quality has declined imo.  I want to go back on Sunday and try theyre brunch so they have a opportunity to redeem themselves with me....but dont plan to have dinner out at cheesecake factory again..or dessert. $120 wasted on an unsatisfying meal. Anf they've gotten more stingy with the bread they serve at the begining of the meal which is the best in the world the brown bread is amazing i could literally live off that stuff now they bring u one small loaf of that and the white bread and thats it no refills blaahhh."
Michelle J.,"Fresno, CA",4,19,,5.0,7/29/2017,"This restaurant really impressed me not only was the food delicious, but the service was incredible. The atmosphere was perfect and intimate. Great date night choice."
Paul H.,"Fresno, CA",53,39,2,4.0,9/6/2017,"Been here repeatedly now they have a ""lighter side"" menu.  Food is always good and the service is friendly.  Always a nice lunch place when you don't want a fast food feel."
Sara B.,"Fresno, CA",147,111,118,5.0,1/21/2017,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory numerous times (not necessarily this location.) I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls, they are a must try if it's your first or even your 50th visit. I have had chicken sandwiches, a burrito, BBQ chicken salad, chicken Madeira, chicken Marsala, pizza and burgers here. Tonight I decided to try the Jamaican chicken entree. It was soooo full of flavor and wonderful spices. After eating a few avocado egg rolls and about 3/4 of my entree, I knew I couldn't possibly have room to eat cheesecake but c'mon, it's the Cheesecake Factory. It's almost blasphemy to eat there and not have cheesecake. So I ordered a lemon raspberry one to go. Can't home and had 2 bites of it and it was also just as heavenly as I imagined.  I have always had great experiences here and it will continue to be my favorite place to eat. My only annoyance was waiting nearly 1 hour and 20 min to be seated. But it's to be expected when you arrive at 6:30 on a Saturday night."
Sara V.,"Fresno, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/28/2017,"This place absolutely disappointed me. It is on the pricey side and the food and serviced sucked. I ordered the CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA and it was lacking lots of flavor I had to add salt and pepper to make it edible. I might give this place another try for the drinks and dessert, but the food is not worth the price."
Samantha M.,"Lemoore, CA",3,27,7,5.0,1/24/2017,"Service is great. Food is excellent. Beautiful atmosphere and the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake is BOMB.  I got the Farfalle Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta dish that came with a garlic, parmesan cream sauce (kinda like alfredo) and bow-tie pasta and it was SO good.  Love this place! Will definitely be back!"
Carlos V.,"Selma, CA",0,5,5,3.0,5/13/2017,"I have eaten here numerous times and usually I am not disappointed but unfortunately that day has come today I ordered a california cheese steak that looked nothing like the picture in the menu very deceiving it was much smaller when I received my food, didn't have much cheese or flavor didn't taste bad but their was hardly any flavor. Gordan Ramsey would not approve he would be appauled."
Serenity E.,"Fresno, CA",21,85,100,3.0,3/1/2017,Fried cheese balls are awesome! Husband and I had to wait about 20min to be seated. It's very crowded and crammed. The service was good. We ordered pasta. Definitely needed spicing up so we ordered some extra marinara sauce to mix into our white sauce and added some salt and pepper! The brown bread is so yummy! I love that stuff! I don't understand why the butter is rock hard and cold lol. Fried calamari is awesome! We enjoyed ourselves! The cheesecake was just okay but we still enjoyed eating something sweet! Probably will only go here once a year or so. Not our favorite place but it's a nice place to stop by.
Miguel R.,"Fresno, CA",76,41,10,5.0,8/22/2017,Love almost everything on the menu and in fairly a picky eater. Although parking sucks it worth the hassle. Lunch specials are very affordable if your looking for quality food on a semi budget ($12 a dish)
Bradley K.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,3,,2.0,11/6/2017,"Worst experience we have had at Cheesecake Factory, and possibly any restaurant. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait. It was over 30 until our pager went off. We went to the host stand and turned in the pager. My wife had our 3 month old in her arms, and they still made us wait almost another 10 minutes. We ordered drinks and an appetizer, which took over 30 minutes to get. We were not given knives to butter our bread with, we asked for them but never got them. It then took over 45 minutes to get our food. Then one of our party members got sick. We told our server we needed to leave immediately. It then took over 30 minutes to get our food boxed up and our credit card back. We talked the night of our experience and spoke with the manager, Amy, who said she would call us back. She never did. We called the next day and talked to Sal, who said Amy would be in in about an hour. Never received a call back again. Horribly disappointing experience, and we have been loyal customers for years. The food was decent, but nothing special."
Yia B.,"Fresno, CA",0,24,51,5.0,3/29/2017,Love this place. Amazing food and atmosphere. Beautiful restaurant and great friendly staff. Love their chicken bang bang with shrimp. Very pricey but very worth it. Only go here for special occasion.
Jay S.,"Madera, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/13/2017,This was my first time there and I was very pleased. Our waiter (wish we got his name) was awesome! Food was better than predicted and drinks were really good.  Will be coming here again
Mike S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",2,141,22,1.0,6/19/2016,"With tables open it took over 30 minutes to get seated and get a beer in front of me. About 15 to get seated and a solid 15 minutes to get a beer delivered to the table. Goodbye Fresno Cheesecake Factory, you lost me for good."
Nathan A.,"Merced, CA",0,1,1,2.0,3/26/2017,"Service was decent and very timely. The only downfall of the whole night was the 12"" hair my girlfriend pulled out of her pasta. They have very good menu options but definitely need to pay more attention to detail."
Doug M.,"Visalia, CA",0,11,1,5.0,8/30/2017,"We visited the Cheesecake Factory in Fresno on Shaw Ave. on a Monday evening.  The entire experience was very good; very nice environment, excellent service from our waitress, and very good food. The avocado egg rolls appetizer was awesome.  And, of course,the cheesecake was incredible!  Big kudos to our incredible waitress, Natalie J; she was very pregnant and you never would have known it by her positive and pleasant attitude and fast professional service.  You could tell she enjoyed her work and wanted us to have an enjoyable experience.  Hats off to Natalie!"
Cherish X.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/30/2017,"Arrived at about 630 pm on a Tuesday. Perfect time, was able to get a booth with maybe around a 5 minute wait. Very nice waiter. Ordered shrimp with angel hair pasta and an order of fried calamari. With an Arnold Palmer and Strawberry lemonade. Drinks were very strong, had to water down with a glass of water. Pasta was very good. Fried calamari was salty. The cheesecake ordered was the dolce caramel. Very good."
Jen D.,"Oxnard, CA",356,27,8,1.0,5/23/2016,"Where to begin.... Our waitress Lakyn D. promptly took our drink and food orders, which was very nice; however both bread and food took extremely long to come out.  At the end of my meal, I tried paying by their Cheesecake Factory CakePay app; which came with a complimentary slice of cheesecake, but the waitress had no idea the restaurant even own an app and had to double check with the manager. This was hilarious since I clearly showed her the app, and didn't magically made it up, but sure go ahead and check with the manager (no foul). What is FOUL is the manager had no idea what I was talking about. HAHA! Seriously?  There is a sign on the front door of the restaurant that shows the app & offers the deal... So please explain how even the manager have no idea what I am talking about.  What makes my dinner experience even worst? I tied just buying the cheesecake and the waitress gave me the dessert menu but passed by the table twice and didn't bother taking my order. AGAIN, this is one slice of cheesecake I'm talking about here- it shouldn't be this difficult, 15 minutes pass by, at this point I already asked another waitress for the manager, whom never bothered to come. I paid through another waiter and I assure you I left ""joke"" as the tip. Ridiculous, I been to many Cheesecake Factory, by far this is the worst."
Ginger W.,"Fresno, CA",0,8,24,5.0,12/27/2016,"Love it!!!!! Love the atmosphere .. Love the food ... Love the service!  But I wouldn't recommend the lunch menus...  For dessert, the strawberry cheese cake is a MUST!!! OH~ I crave it now~~~"
Dara R.,"Exeter, CA",51,286,224,3.0,6/17/2017,"People sure do go crazy over this place, and while i do enjoy a few select items on their menu, I've never been as impressed as my peers. I will say that the atmosphere, decor, and cleanliness is impeccable. Also as much as I despise mushrooms, the stuffed mushrooms here are so good that I forget my fungi hatered. The avacado stuffed eggrolls are a favorite. and their claim to fame ( cheesecake) is always mouth watering. I guess im mainly not impressed with their entrees, or their very weak albiet pricy drinks. I'll just stick to appetizers, and the cheesecake."
