Julia S.,"Clovis, CA",0,21,1,1.0,8/23/2017,Worst service I have ever experienced. No water brought to the table and no greeting for the first 15 minutes. After 6 people order food and alcohol no offer for refills. Dinner arrives and condiments were requested and never brought. We also had a toddler at the table her juice was never brought after repeated requests. Don't waste your hard earned money
Miss K.,"Fresno, CA",0,4,1,2.0,3/29/2017,Don't bother coming here if you're​ looking for vegetarian options. If you tell them your looking for something vegetarian they will serve you stuffed mushrooms SMOTHERED IN BACON! They changed their menu recently and completely got rid of the yummie​ veggie melt and vegetable sampler. Two stars only because of the great cheesecakes.
Dalia G.,"Fresno, CA",1,16,7,1.0,6/8/2017,"Had lunch there today @ the bar by the time we ordered our 1st round of drinks which was water it's was 10min when we sat down we ordered right there and by the time they brought our food it was 45min later. This was lunch can't imagine dinner Cheesecake of Fresno you earned a ""D"" grade Summer 2017. Never going back."
Armen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",601,282,624,3.0,5/9/2017,Cant ever go wrong with this place very consistently good and great variety of options.  I got the ribeye and it was fantastic.
Daniel R.,"Selma, CA",0,16,2,1.0,12/17/2016,"Worse drink experience in my life ,15 dollar glass of ice,spoke to management said their hands were tied, it was a corporate decision, to ice out drinks,Wow, last time I've been there, go to BJ,s and get your drink on"
Cindy H.,"Fresno, CA",64,58,633,2.0,11/4/2016,"This place was crowded on a Sunday night! Our group wanted to make a reservation but found out that they don't do that here. I had the Pumpkin Pecan cheesecake and OMG the crust was amazing. It was pumpkin flavored and the pecans on the bottom was perfect. The pumpkin had an excellent creamyness with a hint of spice. There were rye, sourdough, and white bread served at the table with butter. The rye was everyone's favorite pick. I had the Shrimp Garlic noodles. To be honest, there were very little taste and smell of garlic. Some of the shrimp still had partial shells on it. It's spaghettini with asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, and parmesan with garlic sauce. The food was expensive, presentation was nice, but for the amount I was paying, I was expecting better flavor. I would only come here for the cheesecake."
Tony H.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/1/2017,"Came in today for dinner with a group of friends. Sat out at the patio because it was immediate seating. Our server, Melissa, was awesome!!! I was surprised to know that she's only been serving for a few days. You know what they say, your server can make or break your experience. I must say she really made it great for us. The drinks and food were good, and we always love the free bread. Definitely can't wait to come back."
Sak V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",3,200,105,2.0,11/6/2016,"I haven't been here for awhile and I thought to myself why not stop by again and get great service from Craig. Unfortunately Craig is no longer working there and I heard he's moving up the ranks in the restaurant business to become a manager. I usually dine at the bar because they give you better, faster service than regular sitting at the table. Anyways on to tonight service and food I ordered the following: Arnold Palmer 3/5 it was ok nothing stood out. Egg Roll Sampler 2/5 each varieties of egg rolls sucks each has different flavor and I wasn't too impressed I took each bite and told the server to take it away. Green Salad with croutons & honey mustard dressing 2/5 the croutons weren't crunchy and lack of flavor on the honey mustard dressing. Smokehouse BBQ burger with American Kobe Beef patty 3/5 for a $17 dollar burger normally I can finish a whole burger but even with the thick cut bacon and BBQ sauce and fried onion strings the flavor was plain and not worth the $17 Server 2/5 yes service was good but my server complained about working weekends and complained about her hours I'm like at least you have a job. I haven't been here for awhile and I'm not missing much. Their food was ok nothing special and nothing stood out. I wished Ruth Chris would open later on the weekends because their prime burger is the best burger in town. Service was kinda annoying tonight hearing your server complaining about work and etc... Anyways I won't be back to Cheesecake Factory anytime soon other restaurant can do better than this. Congrats Craig."
Kathia M.,"Visalia, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/1/2017,"Everything was perfect! I was seated just about 5 minutes after checking in (it was quite early on a Tuesday morning). We didn't have to wait very long for our server to offer our beverages, or return for our food order. The lunch special served me a huge portion for just about $13, and everything was correct. Constant (but not too often) check-ins from our server made us feel welcomed. Oh, and the coffee cream cheesecake was phenomenal."
D M.,"Fresno, CA",1,25,11,1.0,4/9/2017,"You know, I never wrote a bad review of this place before because the place is beautiful inside, the food is delicious and well plated, and the waitresses/waiters are usually very nice too. But I have had multiple issues with this restaurant and this one was the straw that broke the camel's back.  We had a perfect afternoon eating here and great food and service until we got the bill. I looked at it and they charged $8.50 for our strawberry cheesecake (no, we didn't need to add to our body's abundant fat reserves but it was my parent's anniversary). Yet all their menus showed the price was $7.95.  So I told the waitress I knew it was splitting hairs but it's the principle of the thing and she understood that and went and talked to her manager. While I realize I'm having a lunch that costs more than your usual fast food or sandwich, I'd still be a spoiled fool to act like 55 cents meant nothing.  She came back and basically said ""I'm sorry about that, but we raised our prices and our system is in transition is that okay?"" Nooo it's not okay to be lied to about this. I told her no and she went and told the manager. The manager came back and told us the same thing. First off, this shouldn't have been an issue to begin with; they should have correct pricing on all their menus at all times. Second, they should have corrected the error for us immediately. Third, you should never tell a customer some excuse and still make the customer responsible for it. I told him as such and he just looked at me and shook his head as if to say ""sorry you don't like it but tough luck we won't change it for you."" Sure enough, they didn't change it on the bill they brought back. This is misrepresentation and illegal. You're lucky we didn't walk out completely.  I mean here's the bottom line: YOU squabbled with a customer for 55 cents. You lost a customer. OVER 55 CENTS. Petty, petty restaurant. Oh and I forgot to mention, on our way to the parking two valets nearly backed into us! Part 2: This is actually a prequel to today's fiasco. A few months ago a friend and I went to eat here. Her and my favorite appetizer is the avocado eggroll plate. We ordered a plate of them but were told they were out of avocado even though we saw other plates of food being served with avocado. It must have been another issue with the eggrolls themselves but either way we were very disappointed. Now some background - I live a half hour away from this Cheesecake Factory so to go there is a special trip. A week later I called and asked specifically if they now had avocado eggrolls in stock and available to order to go. The person on the phone said ""we sure do!"" very confidently. So I took a trip down there, I went in and went to the to go counter to order, and they told me they still didn't have them available. This had me steaming. Obviously no one in this restaurant commmunicates with each other. Well I went home and wrote a complaint through the website. A while later I got an apology letter and a gift card from the manager. I figured at this point that at least the communication problem would have been addressed. So a week later I call, and I ask the same thing. They tell me the same thing they did when I called before: ""we sure do have them available!"" Well guess what? I drive down there and they're still unavailable. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!? You can probably guess how upset I was, and of course I complained online again. I didn't get a response for a couple of months in the form of a letter from the manager asking me to call him. Well I kept calling and every day someone told me that he had 'just' left. Yeah right. Just awful, I'm done."
Estephanie P.,"Merced, CA",114,6,5,4.0,2/10/2017,"This place is amazing, the wait was kind of long. I ordered the avocado egg rolls, they're amazing. My sister had the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls which were not the same as authentic Vietnamese rolls but still good. I ordered the Thai glazed salmon, unfortunately it was undercooked but they did replace it for me and even kept it off the tab which was nice. The place does get crowded and parking is limited but overall good place."
Rachel E.,"Fresno, CA",18,4,2,5.0,11/12/2016,"Me and my boyfriend went here for our first time after shopping at the mall. I had heard good things about it from friends and family, so I decided to check it out. We walked in around dinner time and were seated immediately. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. My boyfriend had asked her opinion between two dishes and she was very knowledgeable. We ordered the nachos for an appetizer and OMG there was so much! It could be a whole meal itself for 1 person! and they were delicious! Chips were fresh and crispy, and all the toppings were fresh as well. I had ordered the fettuccine alfredo for myself and my boyfriend got the Louisiana chicken pasta. Let's just say weren't expecting the portions to be so big! We were only able to finish half our plates so we got the rest to go, so I think you get what you pay for. In the end we had a very pleasant time there and will definitely be going back again!"
Alex V.,"Fresno, CA",0,24,,3.0,7/27/2017,For being my first time there the food & service was alright. Ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo & was a bit salty. Then for dessert I got the strawberry cheesecake & thought it could have been better.
Jessica B.,"Fresno, CA",1,16,,2.0,5/28/2017,"Went here tonight with my boyfriend and was disappointed . I have been here a couple of times before and it was actually good. I ordered the stuffed chicken tortillas which were okay. The chicken inside was overdone and barely had any flavor. What made it flavorful was the tomatillo sauce on top. My boyfriend ordered the cali cheese steak and it was terrible. Meat had absolutely zero flavor, the cheese was all plopped on one area of the sandwich and the bread was burnt and hard. Needless to say we sent it back and decided to not get anything else. The service was good and the crab and artichoke cheese dip was good. Don't know if I would come again though. Kind of disappointed with tonight's quality of the food."
Elizabeth A.,"Fresno, CA",16,2,,5.0,7/25/2017,"Had a great night out here - Joshua was our waiter, he was very friendly and gave his personal opinion about what the best meals on the menu were. We had a rib eye steak and the lemon herb chicken - both were delicious and flavorful! Joshua made sure our drinks stayed filled but he wasn't one of those waiters that keep pestering. We hope to have him as a waiter again! July 23, 2017"
Ronald W.,"Fresno, CA",29,51,23,5.0,6/11/2017,I love this place bread is always warm best cheesecake in fresno always good service friendly atmosphere always recommend this place
Kat F.,"Coarsegold, CA",20,1,,5.0,7/1/2017,I went for my first time tonight and it was outstanding! Our waitress was amazing she didn't bug us to much but she was definitely on top of it because she was observant and noticed when out drinks were low she got us refills. As soon as we were good and finished she was there to take our plates. Which she then offered us dessert and of course how can you not get cheesecake if you're at the cheesecake factory. I ordered the shrimp with Angel hair pasta and oh my was it absolutely delicious! My boyfriend and I split a Oreo dream cheesecake and that was perfect. It all hit the spot just right! I'm so glad my first experience was a great one. I will definitely be coming back!!
Katherine F.,"El Cajon, CA",0,21,,2.0,6/14/2017,"I frequently come here for lunch ~ about once a month. I usually order the Chicken Salad sandwich with Almonds. It is really flavorful with a generous amount of almonds to give it both taste and crunch. I always skip the fries and substitute them with a tossed green salad, which they do very well. I have two complaints: 1/ The cleanliness of the bathrooms could be much better. They just need more frequent servicing. 2/ The quality of the service. When I was there yesterday, it took literally 20 minutes to be approached by the server. (I was seated at one of the high tables in the bar area, which is open seating & usually very nice) I was so thirsty when the young lady came to finally take my order and requested a large glass of water to start with. Then I gave her my order. 15 minutes later, with no water to drink, after waiting now for 35 minutes, I flagged down another server and asked for a glass of water, *please* !! He quickly brought one over. Another 10 minutes passed, noticing the girl was now taking orders for another table not far from me, so I flagged the same guy again and ordered a margarita, which he brought promptly. So, now it's been 45 minutes...and a totally different server was finally bringing my Chicken Almond Salad sandwich...the first server still busy with different tables. I asked about the first girl who had taken my order and the new (third one now) server told me she was still my server, but that she got really ""busy"". I decided to talk with the manager about it, who I found to be extremely defensive. He could barely get out an apology ~ it was obviously hard for him to admit there were problems with the serve staff. He left, saying he would ""talk with the girl"". I began to lose my appetite at this point and wanted to get my check and pay the bill. I looked around for all three servers who had waited on me; they were nowhere to be seen. So I got up and walked over the the server's station and asked someone to please bring my check over. They smiled and promised they would do that. Another 20 minutes passed....I had time to finish my drink and take a couple more bites of the sandwich, but was feeling ignored and disrespected. I got up and walked over to the kitchen area to find someone to get the manager for me again. When he showed up (which took some time), I told him I had been waiting for 20 minutes just to get my check. He finally said there would be no charge for my meal and *almost* apologized this time, albeit defensively. It was a disappointing experience and I'm not sure I will be back anytime soon. I can't figure out why the serving staff is so disorganized and slow. The restaurant really wasn't all that busy ~ I had arrived at 11:00 a.m."
John D.,"Visalia, CA",0,10,2,1.0,9/23/2017,"Beware of curbside food. You don't always get your complete meal and the quality is inconsistent. I just picked up 2 BBQ ranch chicken salads. When I arrived home, I found that the Cheesecake Factory didn't put the onion ring topping on both of the salads. They also barely put any BBQ sauce in the containers and the salads were much smaller then they usually are. I have ordered this salad many times before and this is the first time that I have had these problems. So I called and spoke to a manager, the only option they gave me was to drive all the way across town back to Cheesecake Factory to have the salads remade. I was unable to drive back, so I am stuck with two small salads that are missing the amazing onion topping. If you order from Cheesecake Factory and pickup curbside, don't rely on the staff to provide you with an accurate order, you should definitely verify that they provided everything you ordered."
Erin A.,"Fresno, CA",50,63,70,3.0,8/6/2016,"Came here for the half price cheesecake but ended up ordering an appetizer, as well. We got the Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps and ironically the chicken was my least favorite part. The menu listed ""grilled chicken"" but the grill marks were so black and deep that the chicken just tasted dry and burnt. All the rest of the ingredients were delicious, though, and so were the sauces. I made a wrap of just the cabbage and pickled cucumber (and sauce) and it was soooooo good! Maybe next time I should just nix the chicken LOL. Now onto the cheesecake... My personal favorite is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake but I decided to try something different this time. I tried the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and it was delicious! Perfect balance of cheesecake, white chocolate and raspberry flavor. Delightful and refreshing on a 100+ degree day! My husband got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and it was good but a little too rich. I don't like the taste of fake peanut butter that they use in other peanut butter cups but this was made with the real stuff. The rich peanut butter flavor was nicely balanced with the cheesecake but it was overwhelming after a few bites. I also tried the Snicker's Bar Chunks and Cheesecake which is basically their regular cheesecake with chopped up Snicker's on top. It was delicious and paired nicely with the cheesecake without overwhelming it.  The sour note to my visit was the restrooms. The toilet paper was falling out of the holder in multiple stalls as someone didn't shut the doors properly after refilling them. The wood on the vanity was all scratched up and the trap door was open, exposing the pipes. For such a nice looking restaurant to have such an unkempt restroom was a shock. I was hesitant to use the toilet paper as it had obviously been dropped on the floor multiple times but the roll on the holder bar was at a funny angle as the door wasn't properly closed which rendered it completely unusable. So I had no other choice. I'll definitely be getting takeout next time."

Then I gave her my order. 15 minutes later, with no water to drink, after waiting now for 35 minutes, I flagged down another server and asked for a glass of water, *please* !! He quickly brought one over. Another 10 minutes passed, noticing the girl was now taking orders for another table not far from me, so I flagged the same guy again and ordered a margarita, which he brought promptly. So, now it's been 45 minutes...and a totally different server was finally bringing my Chicken Almond Salad sandwich...the first server still busy with different tables. I asked about the first girl who had taken my order and the new (third one now) server told me she was still my server, but that she got really ""busy"". I decided to talk with the manager about it, who I found to be extremely defensive. He could barely get out an apology ~ it was obviously hard for him to admit there were problems with the serve staff. He left, saying he would ""talk with the girl"". I began to lose my appetite at this point and wanted to get my check and pay the bill. I looked around for all three servers who had waited on me; they were nowhere to be seen. So I got up and walked over the the server's station and asked someone to please bring my check over. They smiled and promised they would do that. Another 20 minutes passed....I had time to finish my drink and take a couple more bites of the sandwich, but was feeling ignored and disrespected. I got up and walked over to the kitchen area to find someone to get the manager for me again. When he showed up (which took some time), I told him I had been waiting for 20 minutes just to get my check. He finally said there would be no charge for my meal and *almost* apologized this time, albeit defensively. It was a disappointing experience and I'm not sure I will be back anytime soon. I can't figure out why the serving staff is so disorganized and slow. The restaurant really wasn't all that busy ~ I had arrived at 11:00 a.m."

When I arrived home, I found that the Cheesecake Factory didn't put the onion ring topping on both of the salads. They also barely put any BBQ sauce in the containers and the salads were much smaller then they usually are. I have ordered this salad many times before and this is the first time that I have had these problems. So I called and spoke to a manager, the only option they gave me was to drive all the way across town back to Cheesecake Factory to have the salads remade. I was unable to drive back, so I am stuck with two small salads that are missing the amazing onion topping. If you order from Cheesecake Factory and pickup curbside, don't rely on the staff to provide you with an accurate order, you should definitely verify that they provided everything you ordered."
Erin A.,"Fresno, United States",50,63,70,3.0,6/8/2016,"Came here for the half price cheesecake but ended up ordering an appetizer, as well. We got the Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps and ironically the chicken was my least favorite part. The menu listed ""grilled chicken"" but the grill marks were so black and deep that the chicken just tasted dry and burnt. All the rest of the ingredients were delicious, though, and so were the sauces. I made a wrap of just the cabbage and pickled cucumber (and sauce) and it was soooooo good! Maybe next time I should just nix the chicken LOL. Now onto the cheesecake... My personal favorite is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake but I decided to try something different this time. I tried the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and it was delicious! Perfect balance of cheesecake, white chocolate and raspberry flavor. Delightful and refreshing on a 100+ degree day! My husband got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and it was good but a little too rich. I don't like the taste of fake peanut butter that they use in other peanut butter cups but this was made with the real stuff. The rich peanut butter flavor was nicely balanced with the cheesecake but it was overwhelming after a few bites. I also tried the Snicker's Bar Chunks and Cheesecake which is basically their regular cheesecake with chopped up Snicker's on top. It was delicious and paired nicely with the cheesecake without overwhelming it.  The sour note to my visit was the restrooms. The toilet paper was falling out of the holder in multiple stalls as someone didn't shut the doors properly after refilling them. The wood on the vanity was all scratched up and the trap door was open, exposing the pipes. For such a nice looking restaurant to have such an unkempt restroom was a shock. I was hesitant to use the toilet paper as it had obviously been dropped on the floor multiple times but the roll on the holder bar was at a funny angle as the door wasn't properly closed which rendered it completely unusable. So I had no other choice. I'll definitely be getting takeout next time."
