Anabella C.,"Houston, TX",15,25,46,5.0,12/11/2017,"I really enjoyed my lunch.  The waitress was very polite, attentive and I had no wait.   It has an ample menu to choose from.  It's a little pricey but the food was delicious.  Food came out fast and the plate set up was nice."
Austin T.,"Friendswood, TX",2,14,26,3.0,1/10/2018,"First off, I have to say that this is much better than the PF Changs across the parking lot. That said, there are still some problems that need to be addressed. One of which, being the price. It's a bit pricey, so don't be surprised when your check comes out to more than $60. Second, the parking space is just terrible. It definitely does not service the amount of people coming into Pf Changs AND The Cheesecake Factory.  However, there are some good things about the restaurant as well.  I highly suggest ordering off of the happy hour menu, because it has a decent selection of foods that will leave you more than full. Second, the service was pretty great. I felt like the staff was actually interested in what I had to say, and the staff was very helpful.  Finally, I must discuss the restroom situation. Apparently, The Cheesecake Factory thinks that a dark closet with blaring music is the equivalent of a restroom. It is definitely not! After my trip to the lavatory, I realized this place was not as great as I had heard, but, I still recommend going here instead of going to PF Changs."
Jose G.,"Houston, TX",3,18,16,1.0,1/5/2018,"Just terrible.  Took the wife and kids out to dinner and it's was disappointing to say the least. $7 for a quesadilla with very little cheese, literally like 50 cents worth of ingredients (tortillas and cheese, no sides) . My wife had the California avocado salad and it looked old and composed of less than fresh vegetables. She said it was terrible, only had a few bites.  My son and the corn dog meal it was surprisingly better than expected.  I ordered a hopadillo  beer and they were out , I ordered the classic burger but requested fresh or raw onions in place of the ""grilled onions"". My food comes out about 10-15 minutes after everyone else's, I have to wait for the less than stellar (but friendly) waiter to bring condiments because apparently I'm the only one that eats a burger with mayo and mustard. As I'm fixing my burger I notice a giant slab of ""grilled onions"" (1/4 of an entire onion), I remind the waiter I orders raw onions which I confirmed he understood when he took the order, he basically calls me a liar but offers to get raw onions. He brings the onions and I notice they have me cabbage instead of lettuce, who eats a burger with cabbage? The biggest offense of all, I ordered my burger cooked medium, after all the other stuff they screwed up, I decide to check. It was cooked well past well done. I politely requested to send it back and cancel my order, the waiter was nice and took it back, even offered to let me keep the fries as a conciliation prize. He says he will send the manager over.  The manager comes over and is clueless, tells me they're out of lettuce and fresh onions, etc. then asks if my burger was under or over cooked. I decline to re order, since my family already ate their food and they managed to mess up a ""classic burger"" so bad, I don't think I can ever go back to this place.  Just terrible."
Michelle C.,"Manvel, TX",69,42,37,2.0,12/27/2017,"The service is great but the food is not as good as I expected. Perhaps, every cheesecake factory is different or something.. Lol The Diane steak was tasteless leather... my leather belt probably tasted better than the steak.  Server was awesome, he made the dinner enjoyable. Still tipped him well but.. man that leather steak... never again."
Lauren F.,"Round Rock, TX",91,244,169,3.0,11/4/2017,"The beginning of my visit did not go well. Had I based my entire visit on the first twenty minutes, they would have only gotten 1 star. My family went in, asked for a table, NOT a booth for three. The people behind us came in with three as well and was given our table, because they write reservations as numbers not names. So they were seated first and we were told that if we wanted a table it could be a very long time. We sqeezed uncomfortably into a booth.  One by one we excused ourselves to use the restroom and wash our hands. First, who has two stalls for a place that holds that many people. There was a line going out the door. Second the ladies room had not been attended to in a long time. One stall was out of toilet paper in the holders and the people were using a roll off the floor. In the second stall which I'll post a pic of, it was just about to be the same. All the trashcans were packed and overflowing. There were no papertowls to dry your hands... my dad came out and said that the mens room didn't have running water. He told a manager, but the manager could care less. So my dad had to eat with soap on his hands.  Things finally got better when our food came. Mine was absolutely delicious (Eggplant Parmesan) mom liked her salad and dad said is Cuben was good but very dry.  Then came our cheesecakes. You can't go to the C heesecake Factory and not get cheesecake! They were amazing. Excellent food and a good waitress got this restaurant it's two stars."
Mark B.,"Houston, TX",416,313,2205,4.0,6/10/2017,"One can truly got lost in a menu here, so many choices and everything sounds fantastic.  I wanted to try something new this trip, opted for the Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp with a side of the Glazed Carrots with Pecans.  My entree was full of flavor and very tasty, similar to a sweet and sour dish you would find in a high end Chinese restaurant. The standout was the carrots! They were amazing, mind blowing even!  I pretty much like everything about this chain. Overblown, larger than life decor and fantastic food."
Jessica M.,"Bay Area, Corpus Christi, TX",23,6,56,4.0,12/17/2017,Great and fast service. Food is different but good. A wide variety of of different kinds of food. Great drinks and good selection on wines and beer. It's my first time here a it's been a good experience.
Manny H.,"La Porte, TX",152,228,718,5.0,4/21/2017,"My wife and celebrated our granddaughter's 11th birthday with a lunch. We were a party of 5 and we all walked away happy and very satisfied. Our waitress was Zambrina and everyone liked her. She seemed to be new but made up for it with her smile and great personality. I had the Bacon-Bacon Burger. STOP THE PRESS!!!!! This had to be one of the best burgers I have ever had. I will definitely go back and order this again and again and again!!! My grandson's children's pizza was large and he loved it. My wife had the sausage, shrimp pasta bowl. She said it was delicious and ate the whole thing which is totally unusual. There was an order of apple crisp that was ordered to be split by 2 of the party which could have easily served 4 adults!!! Lots of food, great service all $85! This was a great deal!!! We will be back. My mouth is watering as I think about that Bacon-Bacon Burger!!!!"
Jenn S.,"Cypress, TX",0,56,15,3.0,1/1/2018,The zucchini for appetizer was really good. The ranch is really garlicky though. Orange chicken is excellent. Service was awesome. I will give our server 5 stars! Food maybe a 31/2 !It was really irritating hearing their loud phone go off the whole time during dinner. I asked the receptionist if she would lower the volume. She looked at me like I was from mars. Just eating and hearing a phone go off the whole time don't mix
Brittany B.,"Kemah, TX",372,101,78,4.0,7/10/2017,"So glad we have a Cheesecake Factory in Clear Lake! With it being located right by the mall, it's perfect for a respite before or after a day of shopping. As expected, the ambiance is nice and intimate, but it also is a good place for a group to get together and celebrate a special occasion. They have a lively staff of servers that appear to be happy to be employed there. Signature bites and cocktails have never disappointed! I enjoy trying different things off Cheesecake Factory's menu because most items seem to have great culinary expertise put into them."
Arjang G.,"Friendswood, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/19/2017,"My wife had an hour break; my parents and I decided to dine here. We were told we had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table on the patio. However, there were 6 empty tables with no signs. After 20 minutes, we sat and ordered the famous meatloaf, chicken and some pasta. After another 20 minutes, the waitress came back and told me that they were out of meatloaf and I asked her to get the rest. After an hour, we did not receive any service at all! And my wife had to leave to work while she was starving. By the time I was leaving with her, they brought the food! So I drove my wife back to work and my parents stayed and waited for me to come back. Not only did we have a good time; but also we did not get any offers to compensate their irresponsibilities. I would recommend this place if you do not care to wait hours."
Rebecca H.,"Houston, TX",194,231,906,5.0,8/14/2016,"Low-Carb friendly restaurant alert!  Whenever I'm having a little discomfort fitting into my pants, I decide to cut back on the carbs which also means cutting back on going out to eat :'(  Luckily this place has something for the keto, Atkins, and low carb-ers!  Our waiter Travis was so awesome! I don't think the restaurant looks at Yelp reviews but they should and give this guy a raise or high five or something. We told Travis we were cutting back on carbs and he immediately showed us several things we could choose from.  We were starving so we decided to get the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap appetizer. It comes with romaine lettuce leaves and a bowl of the mushroom chicken teriyaki tasting mixture to make your own wraps. It was very delicious.  My boyfriend decided to get the bacon cheese spinach omelette. Yea they serve omelettes all day!  It normally comes with fried potatoes and toast, but the waiter offered tomatoes and fruit salad to substitute. It was really good! Definitely worth coming for breakfast/lunch/dinner for!  I had the steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu. It normally comes as steak medallions with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies with a Madeira sauce. I believe it was in the 590 calories or less section. I already know that their mashed potatoes are delicious but not today  :'''( Travis suggested cooked spinach as a substitute and it went perfectly with the meal. Best part for my fellow keto-ers. They have low carb cheesecake! The crust is a walnut almond flour mixture (I think?). I believe it's 9 carbs per slice, so splitting or enjoying by yourself without the guilt is great! I also think I should remind people that this is The Cheesecake Factory! There are always a ton of people, so there's probably going to be a wait :/"
Kevin F.,"Brazoria, TX",2,21,,4.0,9/28/2017,"Nice environment and good service. Everybody was friendly and attentive. The food was good, but not great. Of course, we didn't go there for the real food- we went for the cheesecake. And it was decadent....!"
Kristen M.,"Houston, TX",28,54,36,3.0,7/19/2017,"The outside of the restaurant is nice and is located in a nice area right by the mall and other shopping . Their menu has a lot of variety which is nice   if you're not sure what you want to eat . One of my favorite things on the menu is their salads which are HUGE ! And of course their cheesecake menu as you can expect is large and you can't go wrong with any of their cheesecakes.  Unfortunately that's where the positive stops . Although they offer a lot of different options their quality of food is just ok , and for the price it's almost below average . Their service is also usually lacking. I would suggest unless you can't agree on a particular type of food going something else for a meal and coming here only for the  cheesecake ( dessert ) ."
Monae I.,"Houston, TX",124,77,611,4.0,1/29/2017,"Cheesecake Factory can be a little pricy, but the food & drinks are good. The menu is very lengthy & overwhelming, but I really enjoy my time there. It's great for any occasion (family, friends, romance, etc.). The brunch is by far my favorite time to go."
Shermika H.,"Houston, TX",431,218,1178,5.0,5/13/2016,"I have always been here to only get cheesecake and go! But after hearing about the good food and drinks I decided to bring my son for his birthday, And it was really good.   He even got a little personal birthday song from the waiters with the delivery of his Oreo cheesecake. Fabulous!!!! Ooooh and the raspberry lemonade with sugar on the rim is the best!"
Raven F.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,22,1.0,5/28/2017,"Our experience at this restaurant was awful! We're ordered the nachos and they camera out burnt. My wife found a twig in her food. We sent it back,but not before the waitress said it was a mushroom stem. It was hard and I broke it in half,it was a stick! The manager came out and said it was a piece of a skewer,it was not. He didn't offer to take it off of our bill,but wanted to know if my wife wanted another brought out to her. She had lost her appetite by this time,but agreed to let them bring another out. It was a totally different menu item when they brought it out. The men's bathroom was disgusting,there was mold and slime in the hand dryer and sink. Clearly not cleaned in a long time. Needless to say,we will not be eating there again..."
Maddy K.,"Houston, TX",5,71,100,4.0,6/22/2017,"I have been to this location quite a few times, and have always left full and satisfied with the meal. Tonight was no different. The bread, as always, had a delicious, fluffy texture and outstanding taste. Service was quick and helpful, topping off our waters whenever we needed it. The staff is always friendly. My Parmesan and herb crusted chicken was full of flavor, reminiscent of past school lunches - in a good way, of course, no actual school lunch could surpass the meal I had - and juicy. The green beans on the side were the right firmness and buttery. However, the mashed potatoes were unusually disappointing. The texture was dry, the flavor bland, and the seasonings nonexistent.  Th cheesecake, of course, was amazing. We ordered two - the 30th anniversary and the Godiva. The Godiva was thick and rich with chocolate, while the other cake was creamy and fluffy with original cheesecake flavors with additional chocolate A great experience, overall; I will definitely be back soon!"
Cyn L.,"Friendswood, TX",2,28,50,2.0,7/17/2017,"I ordered Chicken Romano (Parmesan crusted) for lunch. Customer service was good. Server reminded me that my dish was with a red sauce. Great!I love their red sauce. However, it was served to me with a creamy pink sauce.  It had absolutely no flavor, nor did the chicken. I hate when I'm at a restaurant and I have to add salt to my dish.  I really think they forgot to add seasoning all together. I'll be back at the end of this month when cheesecake slices are 50% off."
Brian K.,"Houston, TX",38,15,,3.0,10/6/2017,"I ordered through Door Dash.  I ordered the Fish and Chips, food was great!  Dessert was awesome.  But if guests are going to pay for a delivery service, maybe they shouldn't have to go out to the store to buy tartar sauce.  I don't know who double checks orders going out, You or the Door Dash staff?  As you can see this review is going to you...I am thinking you need to be checking the orders."
Michael H.,"Houston, TX",46,8,,1.0,2/19/2017,"Avoid their take out service at all costs.  I placed the order from home and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I made it there just after the 20 minute wait and the guy told me it wasn't quite ready yet.  15 minutes later I asked him if he could check on it, which he looked rather put out by - and ran off to find out.  By the look of the conversation - it didn't appear my order had even been started.  I was finally out of there 50 minutes after placing my order. I get that CF is always super busy.  But don't tell your customers food will be ready and then make them wait 30 minutes.  We will never do do take out from there again.  (Plus, to be honest, by the time I got it home - it was warm, but certainly not hot - or enjoyable - and for $43... yah, I'll pass.)"
Nicolette M.,"Webster, TX",199,23,,4.0,10/3/2017,"So, with every The Cheesecake Factory I've dined at, there's always been a little bit of a wait. This recent experience was for my husband's birthday. Manny was our waiter - very well mannered and knowledgeable. My kiddo had a bacon hamburger with all the fixin's, my husband had tacos and I had the chicken and biscuits. My husband's meal was ok. He didn't get a choice of sides and it came with rice/beans. He did order a margarita and was very pleased by that. My son loved his hamburger and I was ultimately satisfied with my meal. We each took home a slice of cheesecake and spent about $100 on the whole meal. Seated immediately for a very early dinner (around 5pm) and spent about an hour there. Will go again!"
Buying Selling Homes In Texas S.,"Houston, TX",36,6,1,4.0,7/12/2017,"Cheesecake is really good. I tried the fried Cuban rolls which were really good. They are paired with this green sauce that I must say, is excellent. You won't want to eat these without this sauce.  Customer service was really good with ONE exception, the ladies in the front seating the customers should be a little more friendly."
Elina H.,"League City, TX",8,69,43,4.0,2/1/2017,"I personally was super impressed by the wide variety of gluten free items. Had a delicious bacon cheeseburger and it was top notch. The fries were delicious, albeit a little too salty. Nothing a little ketchup can't fix. The flourless chocolate cake is extremely rich, but very tasty! It's a little expensive ($55 for 3 people, at lunchtime) but it's good to indulge every once in awhile. Our waitress was very nice and the restaurant was clean."
Crystal W.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",21,1,1,2.0,7/30/2017,Service is horrible. Waiting to get in was horrible. Food okay not as good as the prices. Dessert are excellent. Not enough for me to come back!
Aalia U.,"Austin, TX",171,231,7,5.0,6/1/2016,"I went here for just cheesecake and coffee for my birthday and the service was beyond incredible.  That being said, I always steer clear of Cheesecake Factory food for a variety of reasons, not least the nutritional value.  Come here for drinks and dessert, but have dinner elsewhere."
Bradley R.,"Pasadena, TX",14,160,21,5.0,6/2/2016,"What I like about The Cheesecake Factory is not the cheesecake (which is VERY good) - it is more about the menu and the quality of the food served each and every time. I also enjoy the hot, fresh bread brought out to enjoy as you look at their massive menu. I have had a variety of salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes, pork chops, meat loaf, pasta, fish, and LOVE their Brioche French Toast and bacon served during their Sunday brunch. My last meal there was a Bacon, Bacon Burger that was truly one of the best burgers I have ever had. I'd like to close with a tip - The Cheesecake Factory now has an app you can down load that gives you a code to give to your server so you can see your tab and pay when you are ready to go rather than wait for a check. I will return again and again, and would definitely recommend!"
Richard W.,"Seabrook, TX",58,135,54,3.0,7/26/2017,As most of the cheesecake Factories need to work on is its CUSTOMER SERVICE they have  such a great ambiance and food but a lack of customer service a pity...and when they responded by calling me  by a wrong name of Chris. ..their management suxs there are other great restaurants at that location avoid this place
Kristy T.,"League City, TX",10,5,2,4.0,1/3/2017,Service was great! Came on New Year's Eve and we sat outside! I ordered the chicken Madeira and steak Diane combo! Both were delicious!! One of my favorite places to eat! We ordered the salted Carmel cheesecake and turtle pecan cheesecake!
Julie V.,"Houston, TX",95,86,330,4.0,12/3/2016,"Had a mocha, Irish coffee, and Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. Long wait at 8:45 so we sat at the bar. Bartenders were busy but friendly and quick. Coffees were good (I added some chocolate icing to my mocha from the cheesecake because I'm shameless and have no self control when it comes to a chocolate. No regrets. The cheesecake was layers of brownie, cheesecake, chocolate cake and something with coconut and pecans (tasted similar to a German chocolate cake topping) if you're in the mood for something super rich this is the way. Bill as around $22."
Linda T.,"Houston, TX",1,3,,2.0,8/19/2017,The prices areao high for the taste of the food it needed more seasoning it has a large portion but really out of flavor... my 6 year old girl didn't not like her mac and cheese at all.. they took forever to serve our good seriouly it was really slow service..
Leda E.,"Houston, TX",12,19,6,3.0,12/11/2016,"Service: not great, 8 minutes sitting at the table with no HELLO, 15 minutes no drinks.  I feel bad for our waitress because she got triple sat, but still, that's a ridiculous amount of time to sit drinkless. All I wanted was a water.  Food was great! Chicken and waffles eggs Benedict, breakfast potatoes, sweet potato fries, lettuce wrapped Asian tacos. So stuffed no room for cheesecake.  Hostesses need to get it together. Brittany recovered the service :)"
Cynthia J.,"Houston, TX",134,186,961,4.0,5/15/2016,My coworkers and I are a fan of their salads and sandwiches and every now and then we try a flavor of cheesecake. Portion size permits sharing and the price is right. Someone usually orders curbside and we're all set for the night shift! I definitely appreciate the wonderful staff that brings the food to the car! Very professional and timely!
Stephanie R.,"Dickinson, TX",2,8,1,1.0,7/15/2017,"Tried to get through to To-Go 3 times, before giving up and driving up here to order. I came in ordered and waited, after 30 minutes my food still wasn't ready. This was at a non-busy time, it was about 11:00 pm when I placed my order. I asked about my food and they said they were just waiting on my side of Asparagus, so after another ten minutes I just left without it, and all I got was an ""I'm sorry about that."" Yeah me too because I just paid for something I never got. You can tell they were genuinely sorry about it. *sarcasm*"
Michelle C.,"Seabrook, TX",38,3,,2.0,8/9/2017,"We found a super long, thick black hair in the salmon!  Gross!  The server offered to take it back and have them remake it which was great, but no manager ever came to check on us.  The server was not very apologetic either.  We were rather disappointed at the poor response.  I guess an apology was too much to ask."
Maxine G.,"Houston, TX",8,13,26,4.0,1/20/2017,"The wait was super long; I think we waited at least an hour and a half but we had a party of 8 so it was understandable. Now the service and food were great. I especially loved the Four Cheese pasta and the bread. I think the appetizers were a tad bit overpriced, ranging from $11-18 but overall the restaurant as a whole was great. I would recommend."
Uyen T.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1,2.0,8/7/2017,"We came in 08/06/2017 6pm party of 15 (3 kids). We tried calling in a couple of days earlier to make reservations, however we were told they couldn't accommodate reservations for party size that big. So we came in and was told the wait for inside was 2 hours. However the wait to sit in the patio was short. We were celebrating a birthday so we just went ahead and took the patio dining since we didn't want to wait the 2 hours even though we tried calling the reservations in earlier. In the future they should take this into consideration seeing that we spent over $400. It showed a  lack of accommodation and customer service The a Cheesecake Factory has.  On another note , food was good and server was good !"
Tina E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",114,291,348,2.0,6/8/2017,Their cheesecake may be good but I've never really been impressed with their food.  I've given it at least 5 chances at different locations too.
Niki P.,"Houston, TX",12,34,150,5.0,10/11/2016,"We live about 45 minutes from this location, but have no problem going out of our way to come here. This service is always great. Our last 3 visits we sat at the bar and each time she (a different female each time) was amazing. Our drinks are always perfect and the food is always perfection. We always get the cheese bread with the garlic parm dip and recently we tried the avocado rolls..So good! My go to drink is the Passion Fruit mojito and my dish is always Chicken Carbonara. Always, always, delish... Plus, there's always plenty leftover to take to work the next day for lunch ;-)  The restaurant is situated in a beautiful location (even though the freeway and nearby roads are undergoing a facelift).  I could probably mention the same other 5,123,789 things that have already been mentioned, but out of the 3 locations that are all relatively the same distance for us (Galleria and Memorial City being the other 2) this is always our top pick! Never a disappointment! The only thing I don't care too much for is that all locations did away with the Blueberry White Chocolate cheesecake...That one was ah-ma-zing!"
Allie W.,"Houston, TX",22,38,,4.0,9/4/2016,"We have only been here maybe two times since I moved here to Texas. I usually stay away simply because this is the kind of place you to go on your ""cheat day"" haha! The service has always been good. A little slow both times we went and we did have to wait a few times in refills of our drinks. The food is always delicious and definitely don't expect to leave hungry. Pace yourself if you're eyeing the cheesecake menu for dessert for sure! Their Cuban sandwich is SO good and my two favorite appetizers are the fried macaroni and cheese and their egg rolls! Every time we drive by the parking lot is always full so I can't really help out on a better time to come however we came around lunch time on a Sunday and there was no wait!  The one thing I just can't get passed is the prices of most things. For two of us it was almost $50 so I'd you're looking for a reasonable place to eat lunch, etc, I don't recommend. But for the occasional date night or in my case the infamous ""cheat meal"" sometimes it's worth it!"
