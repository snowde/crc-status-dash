Jay S.,"Dickinson, TX",1,6,,1.0,5/31/2015,"The last couple of times the preparation of this location has been horrible.  Dirty silverware, dirty table, food was average and very over priced.  Most likely won't ever go back unless I'm invited by another party.  Service was average, credit card machine was not working.  When we were seated, table was not clean at all, my silverware had a grain of rice on the fork, which shows it was not cleaned very well, our table still had the check on the table from the previous customers.  When we were handed our menus, they were all greasy and dirty.  Our hands were greasy and dirty after looking over the menu.  Just to be clear, I'm a very very patient person & tolerate almost anything without complaining when it comes to normal human error or has an understanding, I'm not the type to expect a red carpet rolled out BUT if Cheesecake is going to charge for there ridiculously overpriced food, I expect better then average service.  Olive Garden down the street has way better table preparation and  cleanliness.  I asked the waiter to have someone come clean our table as it has all these crumbs on it - well no one ever showed up.  I think the staff is getting lazy and just because it's ""Cheesecake Factory"", the expectation is to deal with it.  I think if your restaurant wants to have the responsibility of having customers pay more than normal prices, customer should expect better than normal service.  Again, I don't recommend this location to anyone and you should do yourself a favor and save your money and go down the street to Olive Garden and pay half the price and get better service!"
D L.,"Houston, TX",4,35,8,1.0,12/18/2012,"If you're a fan of fine dining, good food and cleanliness then the Baybrook location of The Cheesecake Factory is most definatly NOT for you, if you're a fan of disgusting food being described as ""Cajun"" and the tartest strawberry lemonade around then look no futher. I had been to the Galleria location of The Cheesecake factory a few years back and every time I heard someone talk about The Cheesecake Factory I had a problem remembering if I enjoyed the food or not which should have been my 1st clue, but since it wasn't clear to me I decided to give the newly open Baybrook Mall location a shot. I knew I probably hadn't made the wisest decision  as soon as I was seated because the way the table was set, because at ""The Cheesecake Factory"" they sit all of your silverware directly on the table... Now let's pause for a minute and give that a second to set in... Yes ladies and gentlemen they set the utensils that you use to pick up food that's going in your mouth directly on the table. That same table that the bus boy just came by and wiped with the same rag that he used to wipe the other 39 tables in the dining area, can you say unsanitary? Not to mention there were residual crumbs of something still left on the table. Even Jim-Bob's BBQ knows to at least wrap the utensils in a paper towel.  So immediately my girlfriend and I asked for silverware that hadn't been placed on the table, and what's the 1st thing our waitress does when she brings them? Tries to sit them back on the same dirty table(yes I am shaking my head too right now). So anyway we order the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"", Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes, and two lemonades one strawberry and the other one regular. So the waitress brings out the lemonades and they are tartest lemonades I've ever had in my life. I guess when life gave The Cheesecake Factory lemons they squeezed them directly in a glass and served them to their customers. They must've had some idea of how tart the lemonade was because they put sugar around the rim of the glass which gave the lemonade all the class of boxed wine. And that's not all I haven't even started on the food yet. The ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" didn't have a sauce it had more of an oil with tablespoon upon tablespoon of black pepper ugh. The chicken was so charred it taste like I was licking a BBQ grill not to mention it had 6 of the tiniest shrimp I've ever seen in a shrimp pasta dish ever. The Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes was lifeless and the White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle Cheesecake was one dimensional  . I will never again in life go to this restaurant."
Jesse E.,"League City, TX",10,14,2,1.0,12/6/2012,"We decided to try out the new location a week after it first opened. Being a friday afternoon we knew it would be busy and decided just to order take out. i called and was placed on hold for 15 minutes before someone finally took my order. That should have told me what was about to follow.      I ordered a burger medium rare and it was well done. The bun was soak through soggy.  The fries were soggy too.  I ordered onion rings as well and that failed to make it in the bag even though i was charged for it. My wife ordered a chicken pasta dish and you literally had to search for chicken. It was like an alfredo sauce and it was clumpy even after being reheated. I called to give feedback about our experience and again 10 minute wait for a manager to get on phone. If i was a manager and had customer complaint on the phone I'm making that a priority getting right to it. Its like they don't care. Just from my negative experience and talking to friends and family, there have been 20 or more people that changed their mind and took their business somewhere else. Sorry cheesecake factory, thats about $300 -$400 that you lost out on.  That place is not worth the wait. Get your stuff together CCF on bay area!"
Sara M.,"Galveston, TX",10,4,,1.0,3/20/2013,"I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory on my birthday. We had 15 people in our party. The hostess told us it would be about a 45 minute wait. Well 45 minutes turned in to 2 hours. Our wait time was based on a bigger party. Well half my party ended up leaving. So we spoke with a manager he told us he would comp out appetizer, that didn't happen. Then when we sat down our waitress was hardly at the table. It took 20 minutes to get our drink order. Then it took 45 minutes for 3 plates of food to come out. My desert took another 45 minutes. We didn't even bother to get another round of drinks. We all were waiters and understand it gets hectic but we were the only table that the waitress had. The manager said he would take care of us but it never happened. There were 3 other birthdays that were sang and of course my table was skipped. No one acknowledged it was my birthday. After previously telling him we were there for a birthday. The server nor the manager were attentive. I will never go there ever again."
Kayley W.,"Alvin, TX",1,30,,1.0,9/30/2013,"My family came here for a nice lunch, and left unhappy. Aside form our actual waiter, the service was very poor. Our party of 8 was crammed into a small 6 person bench, with two of us hanging out in the open. One meal came after everyone had finished eating, and our cheese cake took 30 mins to come out. We asked to speak to the manager, but he never actually came to speak with us. Over all we were very disappointed with this place. Will not be returning."
Andrea M.,"League City, TX",35,2,,5.0,8/12/2013,"Very crowded on the weekends but finally made it in one evening and it has been at the top of my list since!  I've been a handful of times now and I have loved every dish.  The steak was awesome, I love the healthier menu (500 calories or less), and pasta dishes I dream about - YUM!  If you are a chocolate lover try the Godiva cheesecake - my favorite.  I'm so glad to have one so close by!"
Adam H.,"Baytown, TX",1,6,2,5.0,6/9/2013,"I don't typically write reviews but I feel compelled to do so for this location. My wife called in an order to go, I went in to pick up the order and there was a problem with the dish my wife ordered. It was placed wrong to the kitchen. Since we had our children with us and they were getting fussy I did not want to stay and wait for the correct dish to be replaced and therefor left empty handed and quite upset to be honest. A few hour later, my wife gets a phone call from the manager (Frankie Connelly) and he was very apologetic and felt horable that they dropped the ball on our order. He offered us a gift card to get us back into the restaurant. Because of the fact he made an extra effort to call, we will definitely be back. Excellent customer service by Mr. Connelly."
Melanie C.,"Houston, TX",48,101,,2.0,9/20/2013,"The cheese cakes here are to die for.  The menu, on the other hand, reads like ""War and Peace.""  When you have a menu that large, there is no way the dishes are of quality.  The food is okay-it would be better if they would streamline it so the chefs can focus on fewer items and make them better.  The portions are huge, too.  Put on your stretchy pants b/c there is no way one person can finish an entree."
Victor C.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,4.0,6/15/2013,I love this place it's very nice love the architecture of the place. The service was great and the food is very good here. The only thing i would say is more faster service please!
Kristi M.,"Friendswood, TX",0,6,,1.0,3/22/2013,"What is going on in there? 2 visits and each of them not so good. Issues ranged from a pungent dirty seafood smell while coming in for dessert and coffee... to being served raw chicken (not pink, RAW) it took one bite for me to find the cold wriggly center and unfortunately food poisoning as well. Grossed out twice and even the avocado egg rolls cannot entice me to return."
