Jon H.,"Pearland, TX",39,15,1,2.0,3/21/2016,"I have to keep asking myself why I keep coming back here giving this place so many chances to improve. It seems my dining experience decreases with every visit I make here, never improving on the many flaws it shows. You want to talk about over-rated, Cheesecake Factory takes the proverbial (cheese?) cake for that unwanted award.  Atmosphere: For a chain restaurant, the atmosphere is pretty decent for the layout. It's undeniable that this place is a popular dinner venue given the crowded capacity at night and the noise level it brings, but that doesn't appeal very much to me. Wait times vary, but most of the times I have visited it has usually been a 30 minute wait at minimum.  Service: Hit-and-miss at times, leaning more towards the lacking side of it. Sometimes you get waiters/waitresses that bend over backwards for their customers, while some don't look like they even want to be there (and poorly affecting the service quite a bit). This time around the service was decent, nothing too special but the waiter was doing his job well enough. Food: What a horrible mistake I make every time wanting to try different things the menu has to offer. They have a big menu, but it seems that every time I try something new the quality of the food goes downhill from there. Tonight was no exception, I ordered the Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms while my fiance had Miso-Glazed Salmon over rice. This dish I had gotten ranks as one of the worst dishes I have ever had, border-line inedible. The Chicken Marsala was almost tasteless, but even worse the little flavor it did have was strange and repugnant. The mushrooms, coated with the supposed ""Marsala"" around it was a disaster. The bow tie pasta resting underneath it while tender was completely bland and tasteless. I would assume they were hoping the Marsala sauce would be a good substitute for seasoning, but the sauce was already disgusting to begin with. For the first time in a while I reached over for the salt at the end of the table to somehow salvage this mess of this dish, but there was no salvaging this shipwreck of a plate. I couldn't come to finish it, I was severely disappointed with what I had ordered. My fiance's food wasn't any better, the salmon lacked any real glaze on top, and even worse the salmon itself was extremely dry and flaked in wadded chunks of culinary disaster. Our food was horrible, this was one of the worst meals I have ever had. We had cheesecake afterwards of course, but that didn't save the meal experience for us.  Conclusion: This place should honestly just stick to it's own name and make cheesecake, because that seems to be the only redeeming quality of this chain restaurant. While some of the food here has been decent to alright at best in the past (and that's being generous with my critique), the food served tonight was inexcusable. There's no saving this sinking ship unless they do a complete overhaul o their food and go back to the drawing board. Utterly disappointed, there is absolutely no way I could recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. Save your money, and pick a better restaurant in the Baybrook Mall area. There are way better options out there."
Chris B.,"League City, TX",0,16,5,1.0,5/18/2016,I ordered the fish tacos and unfortunately they were drowning in whatever sweet sauce they use. Couldn't even taste the fish it was that heavy. The rice that accompanied the tacos was bland and flavor was nonexistent. Black beans tasted days old and were on the dried out side. Manager never even came out to understand why or to try and resolve the issue. I also noticed there prices on the menu don't match up with the Wiley of the food your getting.
Brandon C.,"League City, TX",0,2,,5.0,10/30/2015,"Dinner with my wife and 5 year old...service was awesome, food was amazing but a little pricey, and just a overall wonderful place.  Recommend getting here early as there tends to be a long wait around dinner."
pquin l.,"Friendswood, TX",0,27,6,4.0,1/29/2016,"Key lime and dulce de leche cheesecake are our favorite. Burgers aren't that good, kinda dry.  Pasta Carbonara is quite good as well as pasta scampi. Fish tacos are surprisingly good. Chicken Costoletta is a favorite. Chicken Madeira is also good. Only had two appetizers, avocado rolls and fried mac and cheese both were good."
Karla C.,"Houston, TX",53,2,,1.0,5/1/2016,I'm not sure how this place stays in business I had their fish tacos and they were horrible I didn't even touch the beans and rice that came with the plate. They're over priced and the food quality is not the the best
Maria S.,"Pasadena, TX",0,18,40,4.0,7/29/2015,Food and drinks were great but my only complain is they really need to work on cleaning the tables properly. Table was very sticky and had to get it cleaned again.
Monica F.,"League City, TX",1200,452,751,3.0,10/24/2013,"I will start by saying that the cheesecake (and ga-zillion flavors they have) actually gets 5 stars. My fav is low carb w/strawberries! Yum!! I will now tell you that the cleanliness of this location deserves 1 star. I have been here several times and EVERY time I'm here, the floors are slippery and filthy with food! It's like they let a room full of 5 year olds loose and they had a mega-fun food fight! GROSS! My favorite choices come off the Skinnylicious menu, primarily the Salmon. Aside from that, there are too many options and none of them jump out and have me begging for more."
Jolynn G.,"League City, TX",200,24,29,1.0,2/14/2016,"I visit this location about once a month and can tell you almost every other visit I  have to ask for clean silverware that doesn't have stuck on it.. Gross! Also, if you sit in the patio area the seats nearly always have bird poop on them and the staff only wipes it down if you are the one to ask for it to be cleaned. My final straw with this company was yesterday when I was sitting out on the patio with my kids and surrounded by other families, there was a large table with ladies and a few men and children and this table had way too many drinks. I am all down for having a great time and understand when it's a large group it always tends to get a little loud and that's expected, but when it's drunks screaming over each other for over and hour and the drinks keep coming that's when it's a bit obsessive! Every table around me was staring at them and shaking their head and dropping their waiters hints but not once did the staff do anything about it. I finally asked to speak with the manager and he basically looked at me like I was the crazy one for saying something. He actually went over to their table and almost reinforced their behavior so not sure what he said to them because they only got louder. I then asked for the general manager and he was a little more helpful, and even agreed the screaming over each other nonstop was excessive. However in today's society he was too afraid to ask them to at least tone it down or cut them off since they would be driving and had children, due to the fact that he might get sued.. Really.. Are you kidding me. What about the entire restaurant being disturbed by this one table. He said it was the same as a screaming child scenario. If I wanted a bar atmosphere for my children to be exposed to I would have taken them to a bar.. Not what I thought was a family restaurant. It was the worse experience and actually didn't even finish our food nor enjoy it we ended up leaving with a merely 25% credit. What a waste of money and time! However the food is good and has a large menu."
Kedge C.,"Houston, TX",44,18,1,3.0,12/22/2015,"Not very good. Average food, lots of crowds, and so-so service. The only thing worth the trip is the cheesecake."
R F.,"Oktibbeha County, MS",0,11,1,3.0,7/6/2016,"Lunch for me and my girlfriend. Food was pretty good except for tortilla soup. Service was pretty good. Definitely wasn't worth the $45 ticket. I could get the same quality food in a blue plate lunch somewhere else for half the price. Some of ""lunch specials"" were literally taken from other parts of the menu and copy/pasted into the lunch specials section. Just plan on getting dinner portions and paying dinner prices, even during lunch."
Isabel S.,"Friendswood, TX",0,11,,4.0,4/17/2016,"This is a chain restaurant, folks, so don't go in expecting high cuisine! But for what it is, and what you pay, the food is great. The atmosphere is nice and fun and the wait staff is usually friendly and attentive. I've eaten here so many times I've had a broad range of experience from good to bad, but it is great 90 % of the time. That's really good for a chain. One sever in particular is awesome, his name is Andy and he is the BEST!"
Donna N.,"Crosby, TX",217,447,189,4.0,2/9/2015,"I can always count on the Cheesecake Factory for a stellar happy hour.  The happy hour menu cannot be beat anywhere by a long shot.  I got a $5 Cosmo and $5 crab and artichoke dip.  I walked out relaxed and satisfied.  The bar area has plenty of seating options for solo patrons, couples, and even groups.  The service at the location has always been consistent.  I've never experienced any problems.  My pit stop helped me ensure that I had a happy Monday!"
Claudia G.,"Houston, TX",14,47,96,4.0,2/17/2015,"Beautiful restaurant with plenty of room. Only ordered appetizers and drinks this visit so I will be back for their famous desserts. We ordered the Caribbean Cooler and the Georgia Peach. The Caribbean Cooler was good but was a little too sweet after a while. I highly recommend the Georgia Peach. The Crispy Crab Bites packed a lot of taste for their small size, don't be fooled. The Portabella Mushroom, Avocado & Zucchini fries were lightly breaded and also tasty. The Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls were my least favorite item. The asparagus, mushrooms, cilantro and shrimp were good but there were far too many rice noodles. The Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes were the best! The salsa verde greatly compliments the dish."
Christian P.,"Webster, TX",0,2,1,5.0,6/29/2015,Service was great! Food was pretty awesome as well. Enjoyed my herb crusted salmon for lunch. A nice portion for the price! Glad there is a Cheesecake factory near me!
Sabrina F.,"Houston, TX",2,10,15,2.0,10/10/2015,"Went here for my birthday and was not impressed. The restaurant was packed and extremely loud, the ambiance in general was very overwhelming and made me feel uncomfortable with all the people and staff constantly in the way and running around. The food was not great the best thing I ordered was the red velvet cheesecake which was kinda on the sweet side. The fried mac and cheese are always talked about and regarded as amazing but I don't know if it's me or that specific dish but the cheese was a little gross and the texture was bad does not live up to its hype, but the worst thing about this restaurant has to be the fact that in the women's restroom there is only two stalls..... how does a large restaurant that is always crowded only have two stalls it's unbelievable. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the free bread is good, the waiter was nice and easy going as well as very helpful and was quick to fix any mistakes or replace unwanted meals also the cheesecake was alright. But seriously this restaurant is all hype and not worth going unless you have a gift card but then in that case just take a cheesecake to go and avoid eating the food or sitting in the restaurant."
Janet L.,"Santa Fe, TX",29,19,5,4.0,3/15/2015,"We had a birthday dinner here, umm, umm! Great service, food was fabulous.  I am not a cheesecake fan, but the carrot cake was amazing."
Hope T.,"Alvin, TX",27,31,81,4.0,1/25/2015,"What can I say...I love this place very nice environment, and the food!!! Wow I will be going back for the fully loaded baked potato tots.."
Tina T.,"Bacliff, TX",0,6,5,5.0,2/26/2016,"I'm sorry for not posting pics, but this is my first review...just signed up for Yelp.  I must say however, they have absolutely the most amazing fried cheese I have ever had in my life and I am such a fried cheese snob!  Even reheated, it is still unbelievably delicious.  My first experience wasn't perfect though..I had ordered a burger without the BBQ ranch sauce and when it arrived, it had the sauce on it.  When I brought it to the attention of my waiter...he sincerely apologized and acknowledged that I was right.  It took a bit to get another burger, but when I did...it was amazing.  In the meantime...while waiting for the burger...the waiter approached me again to apologize and the manager came to our table and not only apologized but also offered me a free salad or something similar to compensate for the mistake.  He came back once again to explain why I hadn't received my new burger yet and when I could expect it.  I got a new batch of fries with the remade burger.  The customer service is beyond awesome at this location!!!  I would give 10 stars if I could.  I also got a piece of Chocolate Truffle Tower Cake to go...it lasted me four days and was the most amazing slice of cake I have ever eaten!  Can't wait to go back!  I daydream about the fried cheese and cake...I would go there just for the appetizers and cake alone! Went back again and had the fish and chips...delightful...so crispy and tender and flavorful!  Got two orders of fried cheese this time as the first visit...they were so awesome.  Also got the same cake again....nothing but goodness!!  They had a line out the door waiting but we were able to get a table in the bar area and skip the wait!  Love, love this place!!"
Megan P.,"League City, TX",463,278,2233,4.0,8/5/2013,I just stopped here for a cheesecake to go. I have been to other Cheesecake Factory's and this one seems to stand right up with with them when it comes to the over the top decor. I found the hostess staff to be very nice but the people behind the counter made me feel like I was bothering them by placing a to go order. The cheesecakes looked great when I got home and tasted as I expected...fabulous. I'll update after I eat at the restaurant.
Crystal G.,"Pasadena, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/17/2015,"The manager gave us two options, either split our party and have us seated in two different booths or wait an hour and fifteen minutes, simply because he didn't want to bring tables together, even though there was space available for us. The manager was very rude and wasn't helpful. Our waiter was very slow and forgetful. We had to ask another waiter to bring bread and more drinks. To top it off, the food wasn't all that. It was cold and had no flavor to it. The place is very nice but the service and management is very poor. I'm very disappointed, doubt I'll be going again."
