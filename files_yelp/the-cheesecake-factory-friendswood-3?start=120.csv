Anh P.,"Houston, TX",30,36,57,1.0,6/17/2015,We took our staff here for lunch today. The manager at this location is rude and unhelpful. We had a party of 10 and they told us the wait would be an hour or our party would have to split up to 2 separate tables that are far from each other. My husband had to bring it to the managers attention that there was enough open seating available in the bar area to accommodate our party. And even then he was reluctant to seat and help us. Our server was slow and took forever to bring out bread and even our food. Will not be coming to this location ever again. Not happy.
Kelsey R.,"Austin, TX",187,68,14,5.0,4/24/2013,"MY food, along with the rest of my family's food, has always been of good quality here. Large portions, always enough to take home for a snack! I love having so many options, which the menu most definitely supplies.  But lets keep it real, we are all here for dessert! I've had many many many of their varieties of cheesecakes. (Pumpkin/White Chocolate Blueberry are my favorites. Banana Cream Pie my least favorite.) THE CARROT CAKE IS DIVINE. The staff I have encountered thus far has been very fun and eager to serve. Even if the meals are a little pricy, who cares? Don't come in looking to be blown away, this isn't intended to be fine-dining. What did you expect from the Cheesecake Factory? A five-course meal? Pssh, eat your cheesecake."
Ciara N.,"Houston, TX",38,267,931,4.0,6/26/2014,"This isn't my first time to this cheesecake factory location. I have never been a fan of cheese cakes factory until recently when I decided to venture out and ordered the bistro shrimp pasta dish. The pasta and shrimp were cooked to perfection when I ordered the first time. I went again tonight and I can tell the kitchen was either short staffed or someone new was training. My battered shrimp came out stuck together and when I separated it, I tasted raw batter between the two pieces of shrimp. I sent the dish back. Travis got a Caesar salad for me to eat while I waited for them to re-cook my dish. Travis, our waiter was wonderful!!! I really excited when I saw him bringing my pasta dish to my table (for the second time). I soon found out that the cooks just took my shrimp and cooked it well done. The batter was so hard and crispy, I could not stick a fork into it. The manager said that they were supposed to make a new dish not re-cook it. I gave it four stars bc of that but I would come back here bc of Travis and the manager who tried to make the experience better for me."
Taylor F.,"Friendswood, TX",0,18,,5.0,1/16/2016,The salmon is the greatest of all time!  However my girlfriend almost shit her pants before we made it out of the restaurant due to your rich chicken Alfredo.. Man what the hell are y'all putting in that stuff you heartless bastards!! Anyways great food love the experience however I'm not coming back until you decide to quit being childish and put pineapple upside down cheesecake on the dessert menu.
Truc T.,"Houston, TX",75,159,289,4.0,1/25/2013,"This restaurant has the best Chicken Marsala!!!! My boyfriend orders it almost every time. The waiting time can be quite ridiculous. We came around 10 PM on the first few weeks of their grand opening and the wait was 1.5 hr. We came around 7:30/8PM on a different day and still had to wait just as long. The food is definitely worth it. Their cheesecakes look really scrumptious, but I have not tried it all yet. I ate the red velvet cheesecake and it was delicious. Oh and their complimentary bread is awesome too!"
Dee G.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",0,21,13,3.0,8/31/2015,"I love the Cheesescake Factory's Veggie Burger but they were out that day, so I had to make due with something completely different in their huge menu. The waiter only found out about them not having the veggie burger until after he had put the order in, so to make a long story short, my food came out after everyone else's in my table. I always have the veggie burger in other CFs but this one disappointed me a bit."
Mj H.,"Houston, TX",0,9,11,1.0,6/17/2015,Worst place ever !! Waited 1 hour and 15 min for 10 table and  Been waiting 45 min ... Server forgot the bread still waiting
Lorena T.,"Houston, TX",196,212,574,3.0,4/15/2014,"Menu is huge.  Food is good,  Wait is usually long if you go for dinner. Loud and crowded most of the time.  Good place to go with a group of people to help compete with the noise."
April J.,"Houston, TX",24,9,7,1.0,6/15/2016,"This cheesecake factory has the worst customer service. Ive gone here several time since I suffer from gluten issues and it seems every time I go something goes wrong. The first time I got a burger medium well and the meat was still raw. After explaining nicely to the manager that I would just like to get a cooked burger and was willing to drive back, he argued saying that a medium to medium well has pink on the inside and it was fine. I eat my steaks usually rare, I don't mind pink in the middle, what I do mind is getting a burger and it being raw. Finally after seeing the raw meat he apologized and said yes this was completely undercooked. Took care of my meal and I was fine with that. Even after being given a RAW burger, I still have gone back numerous times. I usually ask for my sauces on the side and they get that right about 15% of the time, but I'm not too picky, I suck it up and eat it with no problem. However, tonight, I wanted a gf bun. My husband gets home with it and it's wrapped in lettuce. Well, if I wanted a lettuce wrapped burger I would have gotten that anywhere. My husband called back and asked, nicely, if he could just bring it back and get a gf bun, the to go lady told him she was aware she gave him a lettuce burger and was rather rude on the phone. He asked to speak to a manger thinking maybe she didn't know. I live about 15 min. Away and it took the manager that long to pick up the phone. Once my husband got there they still were unsure why it was given like that. Finally after waiting they decided to tell him they ran out. Why couldn't the to go lady mention that. Maybe she didn't know, understandable, but for the manager to be so busy he couldn't listen to a customer request until he was already there is rather annoying. So now we had to get the whole meal replaced because his food was cold and gross and all the manager could do was comp mt burger and a free cheesecake? Honestly, I liked going here because of the gluten free options, but after being screwed over so many times I think it's time to move on. Luckily more restaurants, even nearby ones, are having more options for people with food allergies so I will start taking my business somewhere else, where my food will be cooked, managers won't argue and actually care about their job. It's not that hard. They really need to reevaluate how they mange that place."
Katie G.,"Houston, TX",36,15,12,4.0,4/8/2014,"Very good brunch!!! The eggs Benedict is delicious & I get it with everything on it! The fried mac & cheese balls are so good!!! The mimosas are very strong, lol! They have the best lemon drop martini I've ever had!!! If you order a dinner, be prepared to share or take half of it home, because the portions are generous! The avocado egg rolls, crab wontons, crab bites, and pasta dishes are all very good!"
Tacos J.,"Alvin, TX",0,10,4,2.0,10/11/2015,"My husband and I went for brunch today. Our waiter was decent as well as the food. However, the plates and silverware I'm sure have seen better days as every item was dirty. I requested plastic utensils and told the waiter we did not want new bread plates as I honestly ate over my napkin because it was cleaner. Plates and silverware with food stuck on them is not appealing nor acceptable at any establishment. When you charge me 12+ for a meal I expect a clean fork to eat it with. Very disappointed. The crumbs and filth on the table upon being seated should have been a dead giveaway. The manager needs to establish a cleaner facility. I don't want too know what the kitchen and bathrooms are like. I'm sure it's not any cleaner than my dinnerware."
Jet F.,"Surprise, AZ",2,218,19,4.0,3/10/2015,"Chicken Farfalle and Chicken Bellagio each $15. Both were excellent with large portions, the bread was literally heaven, our Waiter and the service were both over the top. We sat outside and really just took in the whole experience. Music volume was perfect. Definite favorite for sure. The dessert menu is as thick as a phone book!"
Vanessa B.,"Houston, TX",73,238,89,4.0,5/2/2014,"Go big or go home- the menu is big, the portions are big, the cheesecakes are big, you get the point.  Anything I have ever had here has been delicious. The brunch menu looks very good but I've never tried it. There is always way too much food."
Bethlehem A.,"Webster, TX",3,10,,3.0,3/16/2015,"I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday last December. Everything was great, especially the food, but our server was kind of rude. It might have been because we got there an hour and twenty minutes before closing... But that was more than enough time for us to order, eat our food and leave. I saw him make disgusted face towards my table more than once. I don't know why he was being such a jerk. Anyway, we got our delicious food and when it was time to pay, I left the guy a generous tip. Hopefully the next time a customer arrives at the ""last minute"" he will be nicer to them than he was to us."
Santiago M.,"League City, TX",197,49,27,5.0,6/7/2015,"One opportunity.  It was immediately addressed.  Thanks, David (Manager).  He made no excuses and made it right...  Tiffany S. (our waitress) was also very cordial and attentive.  ... in the famous words of Arnold, ""I'll be back!"""
J S.,"Pearland, TX",1,47,,3.0,7/12/2015,"I really enjoy the food. Their nachos are the best I've ever enjoyed because the chips seem to be refried and never get soggy. Extensive menu and I usually end up getting a sandwich with fries. Of course you have to get cheesecake and my favorite is the Oreo cheesecake which I could eat everyday but I would look like Jabba the Hutt. Reasons why this place is just A-OK. Wait times are huge. Menu has many choices, but sometimes you have too many choices which makes it difficult to order quickly. I hate that the menu has advertisements in it. Did I mention the wait times? Here is a tip, the company usually offers up two free cheesecake slices with a $25 gift card purchase around Christmas time. I buy my gift cards for the year at that time and enjoy lots of free cheesecake in the first quarter of the year (the free cheescakes expired in March). It's a yummy deal that is hard to resist."
Angie B.,"Irving, TX",4,31,8,5.0,5/22/2015,"Received great customer service from Emily last night. I was very satisfied with the Shrimp and Steak Diane entree followed with a Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake and a cup of coffee, which was amazing! Looking forward to next time."
Aswin J.,"Third Ward, Houston, TX",4,12,20,3.0,4/23/2014,"It's a chain, and it's pricey. But the food never dissappoints and the portions are larger than most other places that are in the same criteria. The cheesecakes come in a variety of flavors. From chocolatey to fruity to just plain original. And every single one that I have tried has been amazing.  The staff at the cheesecake counter are happy to answer all your questions and know what's in all of the cakes layer by layer."
Katie W.,"Houston, TX",86,314,1,4.0,12/2/2013,"The mall+suburbia=chain restaurants!  The menu is so overwhelming that it took about 20 minutes for me to get through it all.  I settled on the tuna tataki salad and I was quite pleased with the salad.  It was quite a generous portion and the tuna was fresh.  The two breads served to start were both good, though we weren't given knives to spread the butter with.  The service was good and prompt, even with me taking forever to figure out what I wanted to order."
Jody B.,"Huntsville, AL",0,19,1,5.0,1/27/2015,"The food was amazing, service was pretty good! It's a over all good place to eat and a good place for a date night. I don't know why any one would give this place anything below 4 stars. For those who complain about the wait... Your not the only person in town who wants to eat here. There's a wait because the food is amazing, so get some patience and wait because it's worth it."
