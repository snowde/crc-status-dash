Demetria C.,"Texas City, TX",29,137,654,4.0,3/7/2014,"Of coarse I come for the cheese cake yes I've had about 20 of them,  but the artichoke dip is warn creamy and mouth watering , crab cakes are nice and tasty with crab not breading , Salmon herb crusted with asparagus and mash potatoes"
Jim A.,"Houston, TX",0,17,,2.0,1/28/2016,Food is really expensive and bland. Only thing keeping it from getting a 1 star is that the cheese cake are really really good
Daniel H.,"Houston, TX",35,64,255,4.0,11/16/2013,Other than it being too crowed all the time the food is fantastic. Maybe a little over priced but the portions make up for it. You will leave stuffed. And they have a wide variety of cheesecakes!
Serena N.,"Jersey City, NJ",115,528,7140,2.0,8/4/2013,"Went here for happy hour and the bartender behind the main bar definitely had a poor attitude.  I came here with my mom and grandparents (their first happy hour ever!).  The bartender on duty just rolled her eyes and gave an attitude ""are you guys going to eat or drink?."" She never bothered to ask if we want to order and food items, we had to call over another bartender.  And several times when I tried to get her attention she started talking to someone else. We noticed that she was very friendly and helpful to the singles at the bar, but didn't seem to want to serve us. The mojito is poorly made, way too sweet.  The entrees were tasty, we got the corn tamales and the kale salad. Will not be back to this location for happy hour as the bartender and service people really seem to HATE their job.  Very poor service."
Melissa T.,"Pearland, TX",3,3,15,4.0,12/13/2014,"You can't go wrong here. Get a glass of wine, bruschetta for an app, and make sure you end it with the traditional strawberry cheesecake!"
Stuart E.,"Pasadena, TX",156,26,1,4.0,5/10/2015,"My wife and I had dinner there last night. I had the Chicken Marsala and ahe had Chicken Madeira. Both were delicious. Of course, the food was plentiful. We also started our meals with the fried cheese and house salad. The cheese was disappointing, as it lacked flavor. But the salads were great, featuring a spring mix of greens and a wonderful vinaigrette dressing. We shared a piece of cheeaecake (plain with strawberries) for dessert. Yum!"
Brian P.,"Irving Park, Chicago, IL",0,3,,3.0,1/14/2013,"Long wait (1hour+) for expensive, mediocre food. We had some samosas for appetizers, which was pretty good. But the main courses of Chargrilled Coulette Steak+Fries, Cajun Chicken ""Littles"", & Chicken Madiera were average at best. Everything here is just a bit overpriced, and the portion sizes definitely do not match its price (small portions). Also had the special peppermint cheesecake ($7.50/slice!) for dessert which was decent, but again it was overpriced. Probably would never go back here again due to the long wait+price. Parking might be a hassle btw to get in/out. I'd give it a 2.5/5.0, but that rounds up to 3.0. Eh"
Jyreka N.,"Houston, TX",95,40,42,5.0,6/25/2013,"Love, Never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory yet! This one is rather smaller then the one we're use to but still great. Excellent service & food, best place to go after you've been shopping all day at the next door Baybrook Mall."
Erica N.,"Friendswood, TX",46,110,5,4.0,3/9/2013,"Another trip to the Cheesecake Factory and in my attempt to stay within the calorie count for the month, I tried the Skinnylicious burger.  It wasn't so ""licious"" to tell you the truth.  Pretty dry and boring.  It was small, which was ok because I can't eat a huge burger anyway, but it was just flavorless and boring.  On the other hand, the sweet potato fries, which have nothing to do with skinny anything, were great!  I had a friend to share them with so I didn't go crazy eating to many.  We had great service from our server Rose, who was a pleasure!  So friendly and happy she made me happy.  Even if the food wasn't as wonderful as it could have been, sometimes great service and being with friends you love, makes up for it."
Erin C.,"Dickinson, TX",0,19,32,2.0,5/25/2014,With hour long waits and uninspiring food that is overpriced i would suggest going somewhere else. the food is odd with a world cuisine feel to it but no real flavor in any of the dishes i have tried. the atmosphere is LOUD and over crowded. when Your in there it feels like they just couldn't pack any more tables in the building it's really too much. the reason i gave two stars is only due to the cheesecake. You can go in and order cheesecake to go from a small desert bar much like a old bakery glass case. they have dozens of different flavors and they come with fresh whipped cream.  save Your time and eat dinner somewhere else then swing by here for a piece of cheesecake  to go of course!
Marlena E.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",29,15,34,4.0,8/30/2014,I enjoy this place and come often. I usually get the same foods off the small appetite menu. The mixed drinks here are very good. I enjoy the out door seating and never feel neglected for wait staff attention. The deserts of course are amazing and large enough to share.
Mitch L.,"Seabrook, TX",0,25,,2.0,3/25/2015,"Went to this location with two others people. Service was catastrophically bad. Sat outside. Read menu for about 2 minutes and were asked if we were ready to order. All three of us had our menus open and were reading them. Bread and butter came. Still no silverware. Asked for some, and the waitress brought silverware, no napkins. Had to separately ask for those too.  Drinks messed up 4 times. Diet vs. regular. Appetizer was some buffalo shooter fried thing. Terribly greasy, even for a fried dish, way overlooked and the grease soaked in. Asked for more buffalo sauce since there was only a tiny cup for like eight pieces. Never arrived. Waitress blamed the kitchen.  Some guy came around like 3 times with random dishes, asking ""is this yours?""  Main courses were tasty though. Not sure if they were understaffed, but no one seemed in charge. Terrible experience overall. Reminded me why I avoid mega-chain restaurants."
Angela C.,"Houston, TX",0,9,13,1.0,12/7/2012,Very disappointed in the general manager and the lack of managing he has for his location! The wait for us was 2 hours...2 1/2 hrs later we are still waiting. No customer service skills what so ever. Our party fell by 3 ppl to 6 adults and still nothing. There were large groups leaving and we were told 30 min ago that we were next and that was obviously far from the truth. Wait staff and management were poorly selected and the restaurant should have anticipated a much larger turn out considering the location. Not even at the galleria are we having to wait this long. A new general manager who can handle this size restaurant should be looked into! Had high hopes but greatly disappointed.
Rana A.,"Pearland, TX",0,8,,1.0,2/7/2016,"I love this place, i always eat at it. Yesterday was my first time going after not going there for almost 6 months or so. First the food portion got smaller, way smaller than it used to be. Our waiter was so rude he never came to check on us. Not to mention we were sitting outside and he was right there and my husband and i tried to look at him so he can come to bring the heater closer to us and he never came, until the manager saw us from the inside and he came out asking how he can help us. The manager was super nice. Oh hold on i forgot to mention that we were five minutes into eating and he came and was like are you guys ready for some deserts!!!!! Wth dude we are eating geez!!! So no i will have to find me another location to go to! Sorry i had to leave $4 tips only for our $70+ bill!!! (-_-)"""
Romero L.,"Houston, TX",5000,230,243,4.0,7/22/2014,Only been for brunch but was impressed.The menu options were endless.The staff was exceptional .The food was very good as the desert was a chocolate coma.
Lisa T.,"League City, TX",12,57,93,2.0,5/10/2014,"I've been to several locations of this chain and most earn 3-4 stars in my book, but this location is by far the worst. First, the waitstaff is terrible. I almost always get a new waiter and am often brought the wrong dish. Second, and in my opinion most importantly, the management is even worse. We were seated outside near the waterfall one particularly windy afternoon when the water from the waterfall came crashing down on top of a waitress' entire section. There were 4 tables near the falls and 3 happened to be occupied, including the one we were seated at. The women closest to the falls were hit the hardest, getting completely soaked. The table behind them had their food ruined. My table was a bit luckier- just some splashes. The waitress never apologized or offered to get the manager, instead choosing to stand there doe-eyed until she split, disappearing for over 5 minutes. When she returned it was clear she had alerted no one to the problem and had failed to offer diners napkins or new food. After a patron at one table tracked down the manager he just stood there staring at us. The patron demanded napkins for the women at the table closest to the falls and insisted they should get their bill comped. The manager offered them free cheesecake instead and returned with napkins. He never checked on our table and seemed completely bewildered. Will not be returning here again."
Tcs H.,"Houston, TX",20,122,54,4.0,12/31/2012,"Not my first time at the cheesecake factory but its my first here at the new location at BayBrook Mall. The one thing I a disappointing in is the fact that they have the space to make it two stories like the Galleria location, but they didn't. They know this place is popular and out here this is the only location so you have many people coming from a larger radius area. All the food, drinks, and desert were all very good, it was busy but this was NYE and the time that I did go it was 550pm-6pm and the wait was only 1 hr. However the day before we tried to go and wait times were 50 to 70 minutes! So we waited and we waited less than an hour.  The food came out pipping hot and you could tell it didnt sit for long u if under warmers. The only complaints I have is parking and wait times for the place. Its in the same parking lot as the small its off in its own section but its still just not enough parking, they have a section for valet but honestly I would rather have more parking its just too small of an area so you have to park in more of the mall area and walk, its not far but still when you have a resturant like that you expect them to have more parking."
Lauren H.,"Houston, TX",282,22,38,5.0,4/24/2014,I love brunch here!!! My favorite item is the Belgium Waffle with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar on top of it!!! It is so amazing! I also recommend the honey bacon here. I like brunch best here but I do enjoy the avocado egg rolls under appetizers! They are the best egg rolls I ever had and a huge portion!
Angela C.,"Houston, TX",0,11,,5.0,1/17/2016,Definitely my favorite Cheesecake Factory to visit out of all the Houston locations! I always get the best service and the food is always phenomenal!!! Thank you to Amanda and Alex who have made our history with this location so special! The seating was done promptly and our food was brought out quickly. Their service is always so prompt and courteous even when the restaurant is completely packed. Their full focus and attention is always on you even with how much they're handling which always amazes me. I know for sure they always deserve at least 30% tip with their constant exceptional service that I can always count on for a great dining experience! Thank you for always making our days!
Trina C.,"Friendswood, TX",0,1,,5.0,2/28/2015,We had an amazing lunch today. The manager was very attentive and made sure our wait was comfortable. David Willis(could've been Louis it was hard to hear) showed great customer service better than any manager we've come in contact with! He made our visit amazing!
