Bianca W.,"Webster, TX",0,7,,2.0,10/18/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is very different from others that I have been to around the Houston area (downtown) sitting here now they ran out of the avocado egg rolls one of the reason why we came here! Also they were out of the brown bread, when i went to the bathroom the trash was over flowing and there was no toilet paper and there was trash all over the floor, not what I expect from a Cheesecake Factory. The sever brought the table hot silver that had wet water spots I had to polish my own silver at my table before my dinner. Over all would choose anything over coming to this location again! Hours later I get sick all night w food poisoning. Don't order the herb crusted salmon"
Nina S.,"Friendswood, TX",0,9,4,1.0,12/27/2015,To say the food and service was underwhelming is an understatement.  3 Adults and a 3 year old.  The tab was $107 plus 15% tip no alcohol.  Tiffany must have had a bad day as service was non existent.  When you are in the service industry a little smile and good manners goes a long way.  No silverware on the table until we asked and then it took her 5 minutes to bring it.  This was well after bread was brought to the table.  The calamari appetizer was all breading.  I had to take a picture.  The desserts were the only redeeming feature.    I had 2 cheesecakes to go and ordered at the counter because I rather give 15% tip to the guy at the counter.
Laura K.,"Sulphur, LA",655,22,70,5.0,6/6/2013,Loved the cafe mocha and the red velvet cheesecake!!!
Alicia S.,"League City, TX",119,87,197,3.0,3/25/2014,"I personally think this place is WAY overrated!  Years ago it was the place.  Now it's like a common Chili's, or Fridays."
Chris L.,"Houston, TX",16,11,3,5.0,9/24/2014,"This place has such good food. It has a huge menu, huge portions. It's always packed, and for good reason!"
Daniel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",333,49,43,5.0,12/27/2012,"Finally Clear Lake gets a Cheesecake Factory! Despite being very busy the service was still on point and and the Spicy Cashew Chicken was very flavorful despite not being spicy as the name implies. Then again, my idea of spicy involves watery eyes and numbness in my mouth.  I love the huge portions that you get here. I was going to rate it 4 stars but it gets an extra star because I had to loosen my belt two notches afterwards."
Kristina G.,"Houston, TX",0,45,29,2.0,11/11/2015,"Celebrated my nephew's birthday here on a weekday. It very crowded and too loud to enjoy each other's company. There was a total of three loud crashes (dishes/glasses) dropped (not sure who/where). Cheesecake was great as always, however, food was overpriced for what we got."
Shelly S.,"League City, TX",6,133,18,5.0,4/8/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory. People who complain need to come back and try something else because there is so much on this menu. Chicken Marsala good! Chicken bellagio good!! Steak Diane good! All the appetizers are amazing especially sweet corn tamales, buffalo blasts, spring rolls, crab cakes, mini corn dogs!! All great! I eat here a lot and only thing I didn't like was the burrito. Service is good."
April L.,"Houston, TX",8,43,5,4.0,3/30/2014,"My boyfriend and I do take out here once a week and occasionally we will dine in. We never dine here later than 2 pm, so it is never unclean when we go like I've read from previous reviews, although it is always jam packed. We always order the chicken fettuccine alfredo and although it is probably not worth the $20 a plate, we love it nonetheless. The margaritas are excellent and of course the cheesecake is phenomenal. We always have a friendly and talkative waitress, although sometimes slower than is desired, but that is okay. It is a nice atmosphere and I love the interior designing."
Michelle B.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",104,14,4,1.0,6/23/2015,"My family and I decided to do an early Father's day dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.  Worse experience ever.  We were seated near a tree that was extremely dirty / dusty which caused my husband to have an allergic reaction.  While sitting at this nasty table the waitress brought us our entrees and when we asked about the appetizers she grinned and said ""oh I forgot"" ...So we asked to be moved, we were then seated in the ""Nosey"" bar area.  The Food was terrible the service was worse, we never got our drinks refreshed and once we finally received the appetizers we sent them back because they were nasty.  My daughter also sent back her entrée do to lack of flavor and ended up ordering a hamburger (we could have gone to a fast food joint for that) so by the end of the evening we were handed a ticket , never offered the dessert menu...so I again asked for a manager (Matt) rude and nasty take any responsibility for the staff or the lack of quality for the food.  He said to me well at least I took off the appetizers??? Very disappointed with the lack of professionalism and the service sucked.   I called the following day and spoke with general manager Paul G who apologized and offered to mail us some gift certificates.  While I appreciated his gesture I wont be going back!"
LaTanya M.,"Houston, TX",73,7,,2.0,3/21/2014,"Is it me or does this Cheesecake Factory seem a little subpar in cleanliness, food quality and service? I am a long-time patron of Cheesecake Factory--since 1995 in fact, and in my opinion this one falls short. This location should cause concern for their brand.  This is my third visit, and I'm only here because my niece wanted to come."
Adam D.,"Houston, TX",16,28,,2.0,5/27/2014,DO NOT GET THE FISH AND CHIPS. I got food poisoning.  Some maybe wondering why 2 stars even though I spent 24 hours hugging the toilet afterwards.  It's because I've never had an issue with the food here previously.  The service meets my expectations and the staff are generally friendly.
Heath E.,"Houston, TX",20,139,5,4.0,4/18/2014,"Not a fan of chain restaurants, but TCF surprised me a bit.  Ordered nachos and a buffalo burger and the wife ordered Shepherds pie.  The nacho portions were huge, and the chips weren't the typical boring ones either.  Maybe a bit pricey, but that's what a chain restaurant is all about.    Super friendly, professional service."
Kate B.,"League City, TX",5,67,3,4.0,6/1/2014,"If you like chocolate cake, order the Linda's Fudge cake. If you are looking for a nice atmosphere to take a group after an event, this place is the place to go.  A group of us just went for dessert and coffee. They have a friendly and hard working staff as well."
Reid M.,"La Marque, TX",6,27,,5.0,7/10/2014,"I was skeptical to try Cheesecake Factory because I'm not usually fond of chain restaurants. I have been here several times now since I moved to this area and it is easily my favorite restaurant overall. They have a very diverse menu and I haven't disliked a single dish I've ever tried. I've even looked up mock recipes online for several of their pastas while I'm cooking at home. Don't be afraid to try a steak - they will cook it perfectly, all of their pastas are delicious. The only thing I'm not in love with is their cheesecake, oddly enough. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND"
Toni L.,"Houston, TX",5,6,,1.0,2/10/2014,So we went there for my son's birthday. Waited 45 or more minutes for the food. None of it came out at the same time and two or more of the dishes were cold. Could never find the waiter. Asked for 2 checks and had to send those back because they were all messed up. It was the never ending dinner and I was worn out by the time we left. Corporate Cheesecake Factory needs to check on the management at this suburban location. No toilet paper in the Women's room and I slipped on the wet floor. The floors were dirty and unsafe. They get 1 star for the cheesecakes we ordered but even that is not enough to bring me back
Yelp H.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,1.0,7/2/2014,"I got very sick eating here at this Bay Area Blvd location.  I had diarrhea, vomiting, and some weird upper respiratory infection, and sore throat.  I shared few bites of the SkinnyLicious Factory Chopped Salad with a friend (that took it home and threw it away) and a water with lemon.  I am not sure which one got me sick, the water or the food.  Here is a article I found that helped explain on why and how I may had gotten sick there.  All I can say about the waiter was that he was a Hispanic male 30+ years old, short black hair, working lunch shift on a weekday early June."
Austin J.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/17/2015,Went in during lunch. We literally bad to wait 1 hour for our food to come out. Our server/manager didnt even bring the bread out that we had to ask another server to bring it out for us. Just because it looks nice doesnt mean that we will get treated right. Its our first time being to cheese cake factory and i do not recommend this place to dine with your family or friends.
Kristin H.,"Houston, TX",27,41,95,5.0,1/26/2014,My family had an amazing time at brunch today. I highly recommend their belgium waffles and pancakes. I had the belgium waffle with strawberries and it was divine! They cover the entire waffle with fresh strawberries and pecans. It's probably the best waffle I've ever had! My mom had the lemon pancakes which were also delicious. I love their outdoor patio too. I definitely would come back for brunch.
Alaleh A.,"Hobby, Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,1/17/2013,"We went there on a Saturday, and knowing how busy it can get, we were there at 6:30. We were a party of four made up of two 9 month pregnant women and our husbands. This was supposed to be our last outing before we have the babies. They said 45 mins to one hr wait. We waited while standing for 40 mins then my husband asked if we could sit out in the patio which was closed due to the cold. They said ok. We sat there for another hour and 20 minutes.  After several inquiries and my husband having mentioned we are very ovviously pregnant they gave us a table at 8:40.  But wait, the table was a small booth that made it impossible for our pregnant bellies to fit on both sides of the table.  The waitress said she would see what she can do. Then the manager came and said I'm sorry but if you want another table, it will be a twenty minute wait. But he suggested that if we both sit on the same side of the table and push the table toward our poor husbands we could fit!!! Unbelievable!!! We did that bc we were way too hungry to wait any longer. He made no apologies and no offer of an appetizer or any such thing for the discomfort and long wait. Then our waitress forgot several items we asked for, and our food did not come out together. To top it all off, when our meal was done our waitress was in such a hurry for us to leave,that when we ordered cheesecake she said would you like me to bring it in a take out box so you can just take the rest with you? What??? I could not believe she said that.  I love the galleria location and went there often. But this location is just in way over its head. It is obviously not prepared to handle the crowd it is getting. Horrible horrible management and staff. Not going back."
