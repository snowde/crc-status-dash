Dylan H.,"Dickinson, TX",53,234,23,4.0,12/28/2013,"The half hour wait was fine and the steak Diane was amazing.  That said, the shrimp scampi was lacking, a member of my party found that her chicken breast was less than cut up in her pasta, and another discovered a bone in her chopped chicken breast."
Sami A.,"Seattle, WA",220,504,5,3.0,1/22/2013,"Cheesecake Factory in suburbia sounds like something Dante Alighieri would write about. The food is... well, exactly like every other Cheesecake Factory - so I came in expecting massive mounds of *okay* food. The wait times are ridiculous, we waited for an hour before being seated."
Lauri C.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",45,8,7,4.0,12/26/2013,We came here to celebrate my nieces birthday. They did let us do a call ahead which is unusual for this place.  The food was pretty good and service was ok too. Cheesecake is always fabulous!
Nancy H.,"Friendswood, TX",91,27,,5.0,2/11/2013,"Absolutely amazing. Best shrimp Scampi ever! I love this place. Now been there twice, and the wait staff is second-to-none. And, also have to mention the bite sized crab cakes which are on their light menu. I am very picky about crab cakes as I'm originally from Maryland. Trust me, these get a 5 star rating too!"
Mj G.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/29/2015,"I'll start with the food (not all that), Wait time to be seated (horrible) Wait time to get anything food, drinks, tab (a nightmare) and not to mention prices for meals (costly) and truly not worth the wait.  When we asked to talk to manager (a man was sent over to talk to us but we don't believe he was the manager) he never asked what can I do to make it right? Nothing not even a true sorry.... this only after 3.5 hrs after we arrived and 3 hrs after we sat down).  We were a party of 16 but we still don't believe we were treated right and three hrs after sitting down we were still waiting to get bill. Smh.  Never again will I go back. No Thank you!"
Lindsay A.,"Denver, CO",166,428,23,4.0,6/25/2013,"I am definitely not a first timer to The Cheesecake Factory. I first discovered it when I lived in the Los Angeles area and have loved it ever since.  We came in on a Friday evening after shopping at the Baybrook Mall. It was busy, there were a lot of people sitting outside waiting. We were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes so we waited outside for a bit. About 15 minutes later the little buzzer started going off. I love when the wait time is less than they say.  The hostesses were friendly and handled all the masses well. We were sat and taken care of right away. Now it's time to delve into that HUGE menu. It really is huge, they have a lot of different options including chicken dishes, steaks, breakfast, pasta, salads, small plates, and don't forget the 1.5 pages dedicated just to cheesecake.  With this being said, I try to get something new every time I go. This time I went for a chicken dish that was topped with mozzarella, mushrooms, and asparagus served with the most delicious mashed potatoes ever. I was really impressed with the quality and the size of my meal.  The service was great the whole time and he was attentive to us even though his section was full the whole time.  Of course we ended the night with cheesecake. Duh, it's the CHEESECAKE Factory. We got the Snickers flavored one, to-go. It was still great the next day."
Alyssa B.,"Harlingen, TX",166,65,9,5.0,6/14/2013,"Friendly staff. The wait time wasn't long, about 15 mins. on a very busy Sunday afternoon. Excellent service. Great tasty food."
Lisa S.,"Edgebrook, Houston, TX",4,45,6,3.0,8/22/2013,"First off service is very important to me.  My waitress Brittany C, never came & checked on us.  Had to get another waitress to get me sweetener & a spoon to eat my soup with.  She took order & brought food.  Had to actually go & get her for my bill.  Food was pretty good."
Raven B.,"Webster, TX",0,3,,5.0,3/22/2015,I love coming here!!!!  The only complaint  I have is they should have built a larger restaurant.   I guess corporate  didn't realize the demand they would have in the Clear Lake area for a restaurant  of this quality.   The food is always amazing and the waitstaff is excellent.   The menu has numerous  options to choose from and the cocktails are wonderful!!!!  All I can add is enjoy.......
Tom H.,"Seabrook, TX",0,5,1,1.0,7/28/2014,"Worst cheesecake factory ever... dried main course on both counts... couldn't eat it. Waiter offered to talk to Manager, but didn't. Done with this place... way too many great options here in Houston area. Arrogant server with no reason to be."
Millah J.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",121,29,31,5.0,7/12/2013,"I love how we got a Cheesecake Factory on the SE part of Houston! I don't have to drive out 20minutes anymore 45 in traffic for cheesecake! They Staff are very friendly! Very clean restaurant. I was very please with this Cheesecake Factory! Love, LOVE, LOVE!!!"
Jessica S.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Ok this review has nothing to do with the food, because it is AWESOME! My review is based off the service we received. Our server Istvan T took about 12 minutes to even come and say hi and get drink orders. That is a ridiculous amount of time to wait and I know because I used to be a bartender and server. Then he proceeded to be very ugly with his attitude towards my husband and brother in law. I think because they were not all dressed up he thought we didn't have money and wouldn't tip well. Any way no matter the look of a person you treat everyone the same and with excellent service. I know people have bad days so we just shook it off until it took him 15 minutes to bring us our drinks and then another 20 to take our order. Then the server was in front of my husband and my husband was about to ask for another soda and the lady behind us called him and he ran over there without even acknowledging my husband or coming back to see what he needed. We were going to buy cheesecake because duh you don't go to the cheesecake factory and not get cheesecake but at this point I was so done with his rudeness and idgaf attitude towards us that we left. I did not want to tip him but I do know that the waiters tips also go to other staff like the bussers so I left a tip. This was my husbands first time there and will be his last. I will not visit this particular cheesecake factory again either due to the lack of respect for a human being."
Steve D.,"Austin, TX",15,16,9,3.0,10/22/2014,"My wife and I went there for dinner last night.  We asked to sit outside.  Just to let you know, I'm I big guy, 6'2""  350 lbs.  We walk outside with the hostess and she seats us at a table for two, right up against the wall.  We were the only people seated at one of these tables.  I look around, there are empty tables that will seat 4, the other tables for 4 that are filled have mostly 2 people sitting at them, two tables did have 3 people at them.  My wife and I both comment that they must be holding the other tables for groups on 3 or 4.  Our waitress was very friendly, she took our drink order.  When she brought back our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order.  We had several questions about the menu, and ask here to give us a minute or two to decide.  It was almost 15 minutes before we see her again.  The whole time we are waiting, they are seating more couples in the empty tables for 4.  She came back, took our order and the service was okay after that.  The food was okay, I had the fish and chips, it was good, not great.  My wife had the pot stickers and something else, she said they were the same, good, but not great.  We order cheesecake to go.  It is very good as usual.  We will keep getting cheesecake, but not sure if I will go out of my way to eat there again."
M N.,"Houston, TX",0,16,,5.0,10/26/2013,Red Velvet cheesecake to go!  Love this place and bar is a good place to hang out Friday nights.
Robert D.,"Friendswood, TX",0,19,,3.0,9/21/2014,"Today was a Cheesecake Factory day.  We eat there a few times a month.  Sometimes the service is good, sometimes it's a little slow. Some of the dishes are very good, others have very little flavor, but that is just a matter of taste.  They are consistently clean and the food is usually fresh, although today my guacamole was turning black on top. I was surprised they served it looking so bad.   Anytime you eat at the Cheesecake Factory on Bay Area Blvd you really don't know what you are going to get. If they are having a good day, the food will be hot and good. If they are a little off, it will be mediocre at best. For the prices they charge, they should be excellent every time."
Chip M.,"Friendswood, TX",0,2,,2.0,8/30/2013,"Took party of 8 for dinner... short version is hostess didn't follow up with wait time and we left with a good meal but 3 and  a half hours later on a midweek visit. After 2 complaints they sent a gift certificate.. no admission of error, no apology, Customer service?"
Tony D.,"Houston, TX",22,18,2,4.0,12/3/2012,The food and drinks were good. The waitress was very busy so it's normal. The only bad thing is the parking is small. You can valet for $5.
Chris J.,"Pearland, TX",0,10,,4.0,6/12/2013,"This was our 2nd time at the Cheesecake Factory. The food was good , not exceptional , but  solid. We have lots of fun trying different apps. Something new this time was the grilled artichoke, great flavor and fun to eat. Reminds me of eating crab, you spend a lot of time for a small  reward. Good when you are wanting to hang out and visit over dinner. Our waitress , Vanessa, was friendly , fast , and knew the menu . I am sure we will go back ."
Cameron B.,"Houston, TX",0,32,2,2.0,1/12/2014,"Disclosure, I don't like Cheesecake Factories in general, so they'd all start at about two stars.   I don't think there's anything especially bad about this location compared to others; but compared to other restaurants in the area for the same price, I just don't get it.  This place is always extremely crowded especially on weekends and they don't take reservations, so prepare to fight for a parking spot and stand in a long line.  The food generally sucks and is overpriced; I had a chicken romano that was a large, dry, and tasteless piece of flat chicken lightly breaded with cheese melted on it and about a pound of pasta with a little bit of insipid tomato sauce and lots of cheese melted on top.  It's about the same sort of thing I might have made for myself at home as a lazy bachelor back in college for about $2-3, but it was $18 here.  I really had a craving for a martini, so I asked for a martini.  And they apparently don't have just a normal gin martini (gin and vermouth shaken?  Is it really that hard?) so I had to navigate their stupid menu of $11 frufru martinis, with the ""well-mannered"" martini being the best choice, which was actually kind of gross despite having largely quality ingredients. At least the service was good despite the place being totally bloody packed. I just don't get it."
Christina H.,"League City, TX",55,3,1,4.0,4/2/2013,"I had the Cheesecake  Factory style Chicken Marsala, which was reccomended by the waitress. The entire entree was great but the  sauce was incredible! Then my friend and I had a couple of hot Mocha Lattes and split a delicious piece of Oreo  Cheesecake... The service was excellent and the restaurant was clean and inviting, overall."
