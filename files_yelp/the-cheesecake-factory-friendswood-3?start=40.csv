Courtney B.,"Baytown, TX",44,18,,2.0,7/15/2017,They were busy tonight. A typical Saturday night rush tho. Order an appetizer and it never came out. Asked for no mushrooms or Onions on my cheesesteak. And it had both. The waiter seemed annoyed that I sent it back. The ranch on the salad taste like they only put miracle whip on it. Thy charge extra for everything. It just seemed like everything was over priced. If you're looking to spend a little money then I'd recommend this place. You might just get a sucky waiter. And don't get the ranch!
Tonys M.,"Houston, TX",4,10,3,2.0,10/10/2017,"Each time we go to this location, I get the Cobb Salad. Today, I was very disappointed in their ""new"" version of a smaller Cobb Salad which included purple cabbage and a very small amount of shredded chicken. The waitress and the manager said they were re-working some of their recipes and the Cobb Salad is included. There was nothing on the menu stating the salad was now made with purple cabbage. A Cobb Salad is typically made with chopped salad greens (iceberg lettuce and Romaine lettuce), crisp bacon,  grilled  chicken breast, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, and dressing. Putting purple cabbage in the salad and decreasing the size makes it look like the restaurant is trying to save money by adding a cheap cabbage filler. Since most of the food in this restaurant is marginal, I will go some place that is not trying to keep the costs low by altering their recipes. Not happy with my experience."
Mrs. D.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,10/9/2017,This review is not about their food. It's about the lack of kindness to a customer who was choking at their resturant. We observed a customer choking on 10/07/17. He was obvisoluy in distress and his family was trying to help but were unable. They had two toddlers and the wife was attempting to help him. There were several Cheescake employees that just stood there and offered no kind of help. I asked them to get a manager but no one did. The gentleman walked outside and by the grace of God was able to dislodge whatever he was choking on. The paramedics did show up after a while (the wife called 911) but the Cheesecake manager nor any of the employees came out to check on him. I was very disheartened to witness all this from The Cheesecake Factory.
N. N.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",0,26,12,1.0,11/19/2017,"We are huge Cheesecake Factory fans. It is our place for any celebration that we have, birthdays, Mother Day, Father Day etc... there are always minor complaints in my visits to this location, but yesterday was above acceptable. We went last night to celebrate my birthday. We were party of 9 including kids. We sit outside, and it was very windy, and they didn't have curtains to block the winds. Our waiter was a nice guy, but he might got busy, so another girl brought our food. She throw our food on the floor, which was half of the egg rolls appetizer, we complained about it, so she went and brought two pieces of egg rolls in a small bowl. I asked to talk to the manger which he started arguing with my husband that we lost two pieces, and these are your two pieces. I step in, and i told that rude manager that our problem is not how many pieces we had lost, it is about how they served it to us  in a bowl, instead of a plate with its dressing and rice noodles. I left without even eating cheese cake for my birthday. Never again. There are other cheese cake factory locations that have nicer employees and managers. I do not recommend this location."
Kayla N.,"Houston, TX",91,300,2433,2.0,2/23/2015,Very disappointed in this place tonight.  The beet and goat cheese salad was extremely salty.  Mini crab bites were barely warm and greasy dynamite shrimps. We wanted to go here for some cheesecake since we ate a light dinner already but ended up ordering these appetizers.  Bad decision! At least the cheesecakes were decent. Not sure if I will come back to this location again.
A T.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",29,112,373,3.0,12/21/2015,"We arrived here at 6pm on a Saturday evening. That is probably the best time to arrive, and anymore after that, you will be looking at a very long time. Our party of 5 was seated promptly--just the location was awkward because we were seated near the door to the outside seating and whenever the door was opened, freezing air came through. I suppose this isn't a problem all year round.  Our server was an attentive lady and gave us supple time to decide on our orders. We were given the complimentary bread and we also asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Our starter was the eggroll sampler. It included the Crispy Cuban, the avocado, Firecracker salmon, and the Tex-Mex. It came with 4 different sauces that I think complimented each kind of eggroll nicely, however you paired it. I liked the tamarind-cashew sauce the best.  I opted for appetizers as my main course. I had the pear and bleu cheese flatbread pizza and the ahi tartare. The flatbread is very small, but coupled with the complimentary bread, the eggrolls, my other meal, and forking off of my sister's plate--it overall makes a filling dinner. The pizza has really nice flavour, btw. Pear and bleu cheese go so very well together. Highly recommend it! The tartare on the other hand... suuuupeeeerrrbbblyy--wait for it--SUBPAR. It was drenched in soy sauce which completely drowned the fresh flavour it's supposed to have. It came with 4 small crisps which did not do any justice. Bleh bleh.  My sister had the Eveleyn's Favourite Pasta--waitress points out it's a vegetarian dish as a reminder--and it tasted alright, as well. Not in love with it, but it had nice, smoky flavours with a kick from the seasonings. She just didn't like the super al dente state of the rigatoni.   My mom had the almond crusted salmon salad. She said it was pretty good. The vinaigrette coupled it well.  My dad had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta--he said it was a little spicy but it being jambalaya, well, he had to shut it. He enjoyed it, though.  My brother had the lemon-herb chicken which came with mashed potatoes and carrots. It's a big serving and we had leftovers to scarf home.  For dessert, we went for two items: I chose the limoncello cake and my mom went for the mango-key lime cheesecake. Let me tell you... I felt like a fata** after forking those desserts down. The limoncello was sweet but the cake part of it was a nice equal. Big slice of it, too.  The mango-key lime cheesecake was delicious. It paired sooo well; our forks were fending each other off from the last slice.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory as a chain restaurant does try to hold its name. Expect that this place is packed. From sitting to leaving, it took 2 and 1/2hrs... a lot of waiting, but if you've got good enough company and patience, then yes, I recommend a visit.  Just had one extra problem: one of our menus had spaghetti stuck between the pages. Yuck."
Melissa G.,"Seabrook, TX",53,29,44,4.0,11/15/2015,"This is my third trip to this particular Cheesecake Factory...so that must be good sign!  I was thrilled that they were opening one up at Baybrook Mall since the closest one's were the Galleria or the Woodlands.  30-50 mile trips are not on my to do list.  I have personally had their Spaghetti and meatballs, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, the Steak Diane, the Grilled Chicken Club w/ fries (which were excellent!) and the Fish Tacos.  Everything has been very good!  The Cheesecake Factory has put together a menu that is filled with colorful and flavorful foods.  There is something for everyone on their huge menu.  Others in my party ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, the Grilled Pork Chop and the Fettuccini Alfredo.  They all looked incredible!  Homemade apple sauce with chunks of apple accompanied the Grilled Pork Chop....and the comment was made that it was better than Perry's!  As far as the Cheesecake goes.....INCREDIBLE!  I have had the Vanilla Bean, the Banana Cream (tastes just like heavenly banana pudding), and tonight, the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.  I always get mine to go so I can enjoy it at home.  I do not share these wonderful pieces of heaven!  I would give 5 stars for food, 5 stars for service,  but have to give 3 for the price of their food.  The Cheesecake is reasonably priced, but the food menu is a bit steep.   I highly recommend all of the things that I have tried.  Out of them all, I would have to say my favorite was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  I plan to try the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp on my next visit because it looked delicious with the plantains, black beans, mango salsa and rice."
Mia W.,"Webster, TX",2,172,222,5.0,8/27/2016,"This location has always been excellent. Fast friendly service. Delicious food. Always has been a go-to family spot. So many menu options to choose from, Salads, skinny licious menu, lettuce wraps, guacamole, spinach dips, nachos, all super yum and huge portions."
Tanya C.,"Bacliff, TX",0,31,14,1.0,6/30/2016,"My husband and I are a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, just NOT this location. They skimp out on everything possible and service is hit or miss. I have been to Cheesecake Factory about 50x in 5 different locations and never had a problem at any other location. I have been here 4x and had a problem 3x already. I guess I can't blame anyone but myself for returning, but this will be the last.  1st time: The warm crab & artichoke dip tasted different and I finally figured out why after 5 minutes....they added pieces of bread in the dip. I ended up returning it and the manager agreed there was bread in there and the texture of the dip didn't look normal. He did take it off the bill but I was so upset because I dined there that night because I was craving the dip. The entree was fine and service was just ok. 2nd time: I ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and the chicken strip were much smaller than usual but I didn't say anything. Service was horrible this time. We just left unhappy. 3rd time: Like a dummy I returned because I was craving the Thai lettuce wrap. The closest cheesecake factory is in the galleria area and too far to drive during rush hour. So I settled. They said they ran out of Thai lettuce wraps (not sure how a restaurant can run out of chicken and lettuce). I ended up ordering miso salmon.  It was good and the waitress was great. I had a pleasant dine in experience, finally! 4th time: Today I went with my family and I ordered the steak medallion for my mother. It did not look like the picture on the website or their screen display at all! I understand it's a small portion since it's on the skinnylicious menu but the picture in the website is the skinnylicious steak medallion since there is no other steak medallion on the full entree menu. There were 4 pieces of steak the size of a quarter each. All 4 pieces together was not even 1/4 of the picture.  Anyway I asked for the waiteaitress and her and another waitress agreed that it did not look like the picture. The manager came over and said well there's nothing he can do since he didn't see how it came out. I told him this is exactly how it came out since my mom never cutted into any of the meat, she used a fork to pick at the veggies. I didn't like how he insinuated that she had cut and ate into it already. She was eating the veggies cause she was hungry and it took him over 5 minutes to come over. My mom didn't want any trouble so she said it was fine and continued eating.  When she began eating the steak she said it tasted more like lamb than beef and I insisted it might just be the seasoning. She didnt want it anymore and was picking at the veggies only.  So I tried it and agreed it tasted like lamb. I asked the waitress to return it. The bill came and it wasn't taken off. The waitress said she would go ask another manager. David came and he did agree to take it off. He was much more pleasant to speak to and actually took the time to listen to our comments unlike the other manager. The waitress was wonderful and did whatever she could to make us happy.  In addition,  my husband didn't tell me until we got home that his steak tasted well done instead of medium like he ordered.  The outter layer was bitter due to being burnt. All in all, I feel like this location is not consistent and not up to Cheesecake Factory standards. There cheesecake however has always been consistent,  but you can't really screw up defrosting frozen cheesecake."
Chris S.,"Pearland, TX",1,22,,4.0,4/16/2017,This is great food. The grilled artichoke s are a must try. My kids even love it.  And of course the cheese cake.
Crystal N.,"Houston, TX",93,10,22,5.0,5/7/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has a menu item for anyone to enjoy, because of the incredibly large menu options. I have tried many things here, and while some not as good as others, I still give it a 5 for a good atmosphere and tasty food. Plus Cheesecake..."
Tangie S.,"Pasadena, TX",70,157,339,4.0,10/5/2014,"Lately, my sister and I go to this Cheesecake Factory every week. We always have a good experience there. The waitstaff is almost always very friendly. I would recommend going early on a weekend because the wait can be very long. We usually order off the Skinnylicious menu. We love the Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella Flatbread Pizza. It's very tasty! You'd never know it was considered ""skinnylicious."" We are also absolutely addicted to their Strawberry Shortcake. It is truly HEAVEN! It's a warm, homemade sugared biscuit with vanilla ice cream in between along with fresh strawberries and loads of whipped cream. It's to die for! We'd much rather order this instead of a piece of cheesecake.  Now that it's Fall, I was super excited to order the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. I look forward to ordering this flavor every year but I have to say it wasn't as decadent as I remember. It's like eating half pecan pie and half pumpkin pie with lots of whipped cream. What's not to love right? But honestly, nothing compares to their Strawberry Shortcake! So I think I'll stick with that. :)"
Ashley B.,"Southeast Houston, Houston, TX",133,5,,3.0,4/29/2017,"I love the chicken and asparagus there it is always good. But our waiter was bad, he took forever to come to the table and bring us water and a strawberry lemonade. It seemed like he didn't want to be there. I will continue to go there but if I get him as a waiter I will ask for another."
Deb T.,"Houston, TX",0,55,1,2.0,2/25/2017,Chicken lettuce wraps although on lite menu had one small bite of chicken on each.  I am small and didn't feel full afterwards even though my husband shared his tuna.  The main reason for only two stars is how filthy the women's restroom was.  It was 1.30 hardly rush hour and no toilet paper!  Trash was everywhere in my stall.  And a trash can near the door would be handy as no one wants to touch a door handle after washing your hands.  I always worry how clean a kitchen is when a restroom is dirty.  Our waiter was top notch and the 20th anniversary cheesecake was the bomb!
Brian M.,"Houston, TX",0,44,,2.0,6/27/2016,"slooow service, waited for everything, food is getting worse since opening, staff seemed to be short at 9:00 pm on  a friday. I hate that i was asked if i wanted cheese on my burger only to find they charged me additional $2 for a slice. good cheesecake, leave it there...."
Bethanne A.,"The Woodlands, TX",108,391,279,4.0,4/23/2016,"It says I am too far away to check in, but we are sitting at a table and eating.  Kids Spaghetti and Meatball for Senior is plenty...too much... It is good, but cold.  My husband is having his Fish Tacos, big portion, but again Cilantro Rice is cold.  His black beans are warm. A better experience than last week in The Woodlands.  Their outside seating area is so much nicer as well."
Jessica Y.,"Baytown, TX",0,18,,3.0,10/17/2017,I have dined at this location twice and on our second visit a few days ago I was a little disappointed with the food and drinks we received. I definitely do not recommend the frozen margarita. It was like drinking frozen water the only flavor we could taste was the lime we squeezed the straw in to. I have to say they do have the best veggie burger I have ever had but was disappointed that instead of lettuce on both burgers we ordered we got cabbage shreds instead. We mentioned both of these concerns with our waitress but all she said was that's why she doesn't recommend the frozen margarita (when ordering she informed us they do not have a machine) as it is hand blended and that they use a lettuce blend so it would have cabbage. However I don't understand that as the description on menus does state lettuce on their burgers not cabbage. I don't think this will keep us from coming back but will definitely never order the frozen margarita again.
Bill J.,"Pearland, TX",56,55,152,3.0,6/24/2016,"Good place to eat and has a lot of variety but all their apps and bar food is fried except these artichokes they grill. And they don't steam them first so not properly cooked and not edible. Deserts are to die for, drinks are a bit lite on alcohol and expensive. Have eaten at this particular one 4-5 times and usually get decent device ."
Sarah C.,"League City, TX",47,10,1,4.0,8/2/2017,LOVE THIS PLACE.  The wait is usually ridiculous but with so many menu options and cheesecake to die for I see why!
Dean B.,"Webster, TX",0,27,1,2.0,7/25/2017,"I used to love this place and would drive from Clear Lake for the yummy food and cheesecake. In the last few months, my husband and I visited both this location and Sugar Land.  Staff is terribly untrained and rude at both locations. Both servers made brash comments. Maybe to some this is amusing, but we dine out for good food and good service.  My vegetables were over cooked at one location and the other wanted to bring out our steak without the sides because they weren't ready!!"
