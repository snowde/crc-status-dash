Kendra H.,"Baytown, TX",54,81,7,2.0,11/5/2016,"Service was bad but food was good. He rushed us several times. He ""checked"" on us 5 times within less than 10 minutes, brought the dessert menu while half my food was still on my plate and I was chewing. Dropped the check when I said ""no thanks but may I go ahead and get a box?"".. instead he took my food and boxed it. I wasn't near done, I was simply trying to be proactive and just get a box since I knew I would need it with the portion sizes. When I got my change, he was literally waiting at the next table and right there when we got up. Idk if he got cut and we were the last table before he could leave or what, but that was ridiculous."
Armando M.,"Baytown, TX",0,14,,4.0,1/29/2017,The facility is very beautiful. Our Server was attentive and polite. We had a group of 10 and most of us ordered cocktails and they all tasted pretty good. Food was very well seasoned and tastes good. The reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 is because food doesn't come out at the same time. They were bringing plate by plate. By the time the last person got her food the first ones to receive theirs were done with their plate. But the places is worth a try.
Deborah R.,"Pasadena, TX",21,226,98,5.0,9/15/2015,"Everyone knows about the cheesecake here so I won't bother with that (you should already know they have some of the most amazing cheesecakes, if you don't, well...then shame on you). Instead, I want to review the Sunday (ONLY) Brunch. I have had several brunch items and all of them are great, but it is the french toast that has us coming back every couple of weeks. This is probably not like any french toast you have ever had, this is BRULÉED FRENCH TOAST! They soak the bread in a wonderful creamy custard (I heard this is done overnight,but I have not verified that info) and then grilled; not baked or fried, GRILLED until the outside has a perfect crunch. I suggest you add bacon because these two belong together, the sweet and smoky flavors compliment each other. OH MY the syrup - sweet and buttery, simply Awwwwww Goodddddd!! The coffee is usually perfect; occasionally it comes out too weak/watery, but if you ask them to bring you a real cup of coffee they will do so without question.  They have a nice Sunday morning mimosa too, but the coffee is so good that I save the mimosa's for special occasions. If you like french toast, this is a must try - But remember it is on Sunday ONLY!"
Lorri R.,"Friendswood, TX",0,26,,3.0,6/29/2017,"I was extremely disappointed that their happy hour only applies to the bar area, and not throughout the whole restautant. However, my husband's pasta dish, and my crab bites were delish. The waiter was courteous and helpful. And, although we didn't have cheesecake this time,  we have tried them in the past. Of course, they are awesome.  Everyone knows that. Please change that happy hour rule."
Susan M.,"Pearland, TX",63,4,,1.0,7/11/2017,Our waitress was amazing when we saw her.  My well done burger was dripping red. Sent back to kitchen and returned medium well.  My son's medium burger came to table well done. Slow service overall.  Won't be back anytime soon.
Liane P.,"Bacliff, TX",67,46,36,4.0,7/10/2016,I always like to come here for a great kids birthday meal.  Nice surroundings and consistently good food.
Julie J.,"Houston, TX",340,258,123,1.0,2/27/2014,"While the cheesecake is good and gluttonous, the food is subpar, with shockingly horrible Orange Chicken! So bad, you'll never order it again. Just keep reading... Ambiance, nice with outdoor heaters, great in winter. Servers all very friendly and courteous. Sadly, ours recommended the orange chicken and I went with it. When it arrived, it was huge! Each piece was really big which makes you think, more bang for my buck, right? Wrong! Inside IT WASN'T EVEN CHICKEN. Woahhhh. Hold up. What? Seriously. I cut open all of them. They were 90% this strange blended breading, and 5-10% chicken. It was so bizarre, I took photos. None of us could believe it. The filling, whatever it was, tasted like processed cornbread, not chicken. I don't know how anyone could eat this, especially after knowing what's inside! It's crazy!!! The other food was good, the grilled artichokes were actually delicious. But I just couldn't stomach coming here, not knowing what else is hiding in my food! :( A word to the wise, be careful."
James B.,"Hitchcock, TX",2,16,1,1.0,12/21/2016,"Won't eat anywhere that fails to back the blue. Doesn't matter which store, in what state. YOU represent the pos. Fire the  responsible."
Ken H.,"Houston, TX",38,231,1177,3.0,2/23/2015,"This is a hard choice between the food that was good and the accommodations not so much. First, the good.  We ordered the lunch meatloaf and it wasn't good it was superb.  The server was friendly and attentive enough (though less than stellar). Now, the bad.  For a place with this physical grandeur the accommodations were not good.  I went to the restroom to wash my hands.  The foam soap was thin/watered.  I wasn't able to get a lather and barely able to get a skim of soap on my hands.  Like McDonald's they have blow dryers instead of paper. Unlike McDonald's, you have to stick your hands into their dryer device.  I wasn't able to hold hands still enough to avoid wiping them on the sides of the thing, so I wasn't sure I was better off than when I came in.   Finally, they have no WiFi.  Very tall ceilings with grand chandlers but no WiFi. ==================== Note to somebody:  This is weird but they had so many choices of what sounded like wonderful cheesecakes I was unable to choose one. We were going to get it to go and some of the choices sounded so delicious I knew if I made the wrong choice I'd be upset and self-flagellating for choosing the wrong one instead of one of the other grand sounding choices. The only solution was to not get any. I guess it's a damn good thing I chose the right wife. UPDATE:  Went for the second time in more than three years.  Meatloaf was still good, but the service was bad.  There were many empty tables.  In our area I could only see three other occupied tables and at least two of these had already been served when we arrived.  Obviously meatloaf is already prepared but it took 15-20 minutes to get it.  We could have snacked on bread but it didn't arrive until about a minute before the food. Our server was inattentive.  It was not a good experience.  I'm docking them one star.  If it weren't for the meatloaf it would have been two stars. ___ We've Eaten Out Every Meal for 25 years"
Danna G.,"Houston, TX",489,153,194,3.0,12/29/2015,"I've just never been a fan of any of their locations. The stars are in respects to the cheesecake, if it wasn't good this place would have any stars. First off NEVER order the gumbo! It is unappealing not only in taste but appearance! Looks like dirty mud (redundant much?) The service is pretty goo as well they will gladly replace your dish for another or refund your money.  It comes to a point where you just don't want to return food! My friends absolutely love this place and out-vote me every time so I go with a skinny burger or just drink the ridiculously expensive cocktails."
Majay M.,"Houston, TX",2,81,106,2.0,2/8/2016,"I've been a regular costumer since they open so I'm familiar with menu but I always ask the same, Thai wraps. I have noticed that chicken portion has been decreasing but yesterday was EXTREMELY noticeable to the point I had to ask waitress to find out for me how many ounces of chicken do they regularly use. I know my measurements as I do meal prepping at home so I have a very well eye for what 6 ounces look like. Waitress brought me more chicken and I appreciate that but please don't make costumes doubt about service. If you need to increase prices do so, don't compromise quantity and or quality."
Roland f.,"Seabrook, TX",20,104,72,1.0,11/23/2015,"Bad service last Saturday even at the bar, place not even that crowded and it took the kitchen @ 15 minutes to come out with my first appetizer of simple steamed/boiled may be even microwaved Edemame, thanks for the manager for taking care of the other apps. which basically was served the same time as the Edemame not good, it is unfortunate that I have to be back on this restaurant  since I only spent  half of my gift certificate what a bummer, I hate establishment like this with no customer service. I am thinking of ordering to go next time to zero out the balance on the gift certificate and donate the food."
Dave G.,"Houston, TX",0,19,2,1.0,3/6/2017,My wife and I walked in and stood in front of the hostess stand. Three hostesses chatting with each other and never acknowledged us. After several minutes we proceeded to the bar. We sat down and were there over 10 minutes and we're never acknowledged. We got up and left. I have no idea if the food is good or not. This place was maybe 50% full. They have a real problem.
Nadia T.,"Houston, TX",0,2,8,1.0,11/19/2015,There cutlery is very dirty and they leave their spoons and forks on the table which they just recently cleaned so if you sneeze and passing by your sneeze will be on the spoons and forks even a cheaper restaurant cover their Cutlery
Tish M.,"Pasadena, TX",0,2,2,3.0,4/3/2017,Food here is good. Server great until she had an attitude with us about paying with a gift card & then we confirmed if we had the correct cheesecake flavor. Most cheesecake flavors are awesome but NOT the Choc Turtle. Worst I've ever had. Not pecans or caramel & cheesecake tastes like a mocha flavor.  Left there not very satisfied.
Wm M.,"Houston, TX",8,8,,1.0,6/7/2016,We took my son here for his 23rd Birthday. Such a disappointing experience. I have traveled across the U.S. ate at several but this hands down was the absolute worst by far. We were seated in a booth a party of 6 mind you three grown men.... This was the start we let the hostess know upon arrival that we had a birthday as well as our waiter (NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED !!) Asked for drinks upon waiter coming to table three were forgotten asked for the 2nd time ..nothing once our food came out it cold asked for drinks again finally half through meal they arrived. Asked for manager this to fell upon deaf ears the service was so bad that we decided to order desert to go which was the only think that was decent. we spent 277.00 on this experience I have called several times even left messages with corporate to be completely ignored!!!!!! This place sucks
Wendy L.,"Pearland, TX",54,9,1,2.0,6/23/2016,"I visited on Father's Day and surprising got a table for 6 within a few minutes which was nice. We started with the Avocado Eggrolls which were nice and crispy on the outside yet the avocado was still chuncky and creamy inside. The dipping sauce was overly sweet and not necessary for my taste. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta as my entree. The shrimp were tail on with a light fry to them and while the menu did say the sauce had wine and basil in it, I found it too overwhelming to eat as did a guest of mine who tried it. I settled for the bread basket (which had a nice chewy baguette) and my Wild Turkey and Coke. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was divine as always and 1 slice had plenty left to take home."
Maria M.,"Lawrenceburg, TN",3,66,130,4.0,6/23/2016,Good food and service.... Went here for dinner and it was packed but the waiting time wasn't that bad...
Shelly M.,"League City, TX",0,128,43,4.0,10/7/2015,The Cheesecake Factory has awesome food that's always consistently good and they have such a huge variety of choices including a skinnylicious menu for calorie counters which is definitely a bonus! The staff at this location is always so nice and professional especially Kristen T she's awesome and so sweet. The only thing they could improve on is the cramped seating and very uncomfortable plastic  or wicker like flimsy chairs inside. I get that type of chair outside but not inside.
Katrina H.,"League City, TX",0,5,,2.0,8/11/2016,I have to say that the wait time and overall customer service is pretty terrible. Our party of 6 arrived around 3pm following a graduation. We waiting more than 25 mins for seating despite the fact that the resturant was half empty and patrons were leaving. We were told after 15 mins of unexplained waiting it was due to staffing. The hostess seemed inept and overwhelmed by a vey basic job. We eventually get seated I a seat and section that was available the entire time!?!? Mindless and same staff as when we arrived.
