Marjorie S.,"Galveston, TX",62,99,289,5.0,12/4/2014,Came here for a late dinner with my family a couple of days ago and was so pleased with the service we received with Brittany C. She was very friendly and attentive! Food is above average American food. I ordered the Miso Salmon and it was delish. Save room for desserts!
PopeyeDaSailaman ..,"Houston, TX",1,28,22,5.0,9/9/2015,I love this place even though is a chain restaurant they make you feel good food is great the only thing I found  is that the limes didn't come in a perfect fan shaped lol
Monica R.,"Fresno, TX",61,48,114,5.0,12/19/2015,Atmosphere is nice and you can eat indoor or outdoors.  My two favorite dishes are factory match is with chicken and the Cobb salad.  The lunch menu is available until 5pm.
Wendy E.,"Galveston, TX",7,24,4,5.0,7/8/2014,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I've been here about 4 times now. We live in galveston so whenever were at the mall I always want to go here to eat lol.  We went recently for my birthday on June 25th. Place was packed, always is. But I love that. We sat in a round booth which was cool.  I love that they have so many different foods to choose from. I got the orange chicken, I always get that lol. It's so good. I asked the waiter for soy sauce and I'm pretty sure he went across the street to PF Changs to get it for me. That was awesome. He was such a good server I wish I could remember his name because I loved him lol.  My dad told him it was my birthday so they all sang to me lol. It was cute.  Love this place so much."
Karl W.,"Houston, TX",6,53,4,3.0,9/18/2015,"Finally had cause to go here and, but for the service, we were underwhelmed. I had the Pit Beef sandwich which was good but might could have had more meat. Daughter had a chicken Caesar salad which really wasn't bad at all. My wife's grilled chicken avocado sandwich  was incredibly sloppy to eat and lacked in taste. In fairness to the waiter, he sensed that she wasn't happy with it and made an adjustment to the bill. As for the atmosphere, being it was a Friday night, it was expectedly busy, noisy, and filled with gaggles of selfie taking young ladies. For the price we paid, it wasn't worth it."
Veronica Q.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,5.0,3/27/2016,"Even though they have to work on Easter, these people were ridiculously sweet!!! Thank you so much"
Sabrina F.,"Montreal, Canada",84,166,569,3.0,6/12/2014,"Food is ok, I'm not a huge fan of this place considering that I can spend the same amount of money in another place & feel more content. I usually only come here for Happy hour on Mon-Fri from 4:00-6:00 because select drinks & appetizers are 5$. The staff is great except for a hostess with an attitude (she's been like this every time I was here). Happy hour make me happy, what can I say !!!"
Angela B.,"Houston, TX",5,83,41,3.0,10/25/2015,Food was prepared well. Service was little slow but very acceptable and friendly.  Only issue was although the table was just cleaned (still wet) it had particles and something slimy on it.  Not a big deal we just wiped it up. Once we picked up the knives we noticed they were dirty as well.   Food was prepared well overall no complaints. Portion were more then enough so you might plan on sharing if not too hungry Probably some of the best flavored edamame  we've ever had.  And of course you can't go wrong with cheesecake and we each got a piece to go While waiting for our check we watched a person cleaning with a rag and then placing the plates napkins and silverware on the table at the same time and he was handling all eating surfaces of the plates and silverware which I feel should be avoided especially if you are handling the dirty cloth you are wiping the table and seats with Makes you wonder about the kitchen... We will return. Just checking our utensil closely!!
Maxine R.,"Chattanooga, TN",13,10,,4.0,8/3/2016,The service is nice and the food is tasty. I like their chicken pot pie. The atmosphere is good. The building is beautiful. I wouldn't go there all the time just because it's a little pricy. Otherwise it's a great restaurant to go to.
K. T.,"Pearland, TX",0,12,7,2.0,5/13/2016,"I went here to order a variety of cheesecakes for my husband's birthday and I spent $52.00 all on cheesecake, only to get home and find hair in one of the cheesecakes!! Ugh...so at that point I wasn't even interested in any of the other ones b/c who knows right!! I called and asked to speak to the manager and told him what happened and he took my address to send me a gift card. Not sure how much but hopefully at least the $8 I paid for the slice! That is the worst thing you can find is hair in your food!! I live in Pearland and was not going to drive back that direction! Kinda put a damper on the mood!! Not sure if I will go back to that location should of just went to the Galleria like I usually do!!"
Lori L.,"Austin, TX",0,25,5,5.0,7/28/2015,"I still can't find anything wrong with this place!! I am trying!! Look at my other reviews!! Oh wait! The frozen French fries, not the worst, but definitely not fresh cut :( But otherwise, so good though!!"
Tracy O.,"Sumner, TX",3,13,,3.0,12/22/2016,"No complaints about the wait time or service as both were excellent. The ambience is also nice though a bit busy. The patio looked like a nice place to sit for an evening meal. The three stars is mainly for the food quality. Everyone in our party felt their food was just so-so. The portions were huge and presentation was okay, but there was always some key element missing. I got the French country salad from the skinny menu (one of maybe four things I saw that were vegetarian entrees, no vegan items seen though I wasn't looking really close) and though it was massive, it was mainly greens. Very little goat cheese or beets. Only a few asparagus. There were a decent amount of candied pecans, but with pecans and greens and very little of everything else, it was just boring. For a $10.50 salad with 5 ingredients that aren't meat, I expect more. Another person got the chicken Marsala which tasted great but was mostly noodles and not enough sauce for the noodle portion. Spaghetti and meatballs were dry and needed more sauce to balance the massive noodle portion. Chicken club sandwich was huge, but bland. The pepperoni pizza was okay, though big, but nothing to write home about. Our server was great and we had lots of people asking us if we needed anything. Drinks were filled as needed. No complaints on service at all. It's a chain and I tend to prefer local places, so maybe my opinion is biased, but the food was  boring and not well-proportioned."
John S.,"Streetman, TX",0,56,,1.0,12/19/2016,"I was very disappointed with my lunch visit. My pasta was cold. I sent the meal back to get remade and the chef placed the same chicken on freshly made pasta. Does the restaurant consider health factors or food contamination when doing such actions! I try to support the Cheesecake Factory, yet continue to be disappointed."
Michael S.,"Sour Lake, TX",5,156,161,5.0,5/14/2016,Stopped in for a few drinks and some cheesecake after walking the river walk. I had the Blue Moon beer which was nice and cold and topped with an orange slice.  Everyone else in my party had cheesecake and raved about how great it was! I have had it before and it is really great. My favorite flavor is the lemon raspberry.
Gloria Juliana A.,"Houston, TX",1,29,26,4.0,8/5/2015,"Not a big fan of their food, really. I go for their cheesecakes! My favorite is the S'mores Cheesecake! Yummm!"
Justin H.,"Houston, TX",83,29,45,5.0,10/5/2015,We had the best waiter named Lauren very informational great fast service... Walked in greater right away low light on the patio... Exceptional food... Thank you for my sister's great Birthday... I will definitely be coming back.. We had a party of 10
Daniel V.,"Pearland, TX",62,138,137,2.0,3/15/2015,"Just because a place looks really nice and seems to be busy doesn't mean the restaurant is awesome. The service was not a problem at all, it's the quality of food.  We started off by ordering the factory nachos and at first glance it looked amazing. The plate was huge and the presentation was on point. As we began chipping away at the iceberg we noticed the cheese to be a little gritty and the chips to be super greasy. You get that feeling of ""blah"" in your mouth and don't want to eat anymore.  For the main course I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce and fries. I wasn't really impressed with the sandwich because the chicken seemed to have a lot of breading on it and it was also a little too greasy. The flavor was not what I expected and I had to ask the waitress if they forgot to add buffalo sauce on it. She told me the sauce is ""drizzled"" on the sandwich and got me a little extra.  We didn't want to even bother ordering any cheesecake because the thought of grease and dairy churning in your gut while doing some shopping at the mall didn't sound very pleasant. I'm not sure if I'd go back with all the other options in the area."
Michael P.,"Houston, TX",3,10,,1.0,7/14/2016,"First of all the young man who seated us had a very apparent attitude. Especially after we asked to be seated at a different table rather than the one crammed next to the emergency exit. There were plenty of other empty tables. The server was pleasant enough. That was the only plus to this visit. I ordered the chicken bellagio. First it didn't come with prosciutto as it stated in the menu, second the arugla salad on top was either old or had been stored in a plastic sack for an extended period of time. It tasted bitter and past its freshness. The worst part of the dish however was the chicken. It had obviously been microwaved. It was soggy, lukewarm, tasted metallic and stale. Never again this location."
KEE K.,"Baytown, TX",12,50,95,5.0,4/27/2016,We ran in for a quick bite to eat and we pleasantly surprised with the great service we received from Chris the bartender. He was  nice funny and gave great recommendations and went out of his way to accommodate us.
James M.,"Pearland, TX",0,3,,5.0,6/3/2016,"This restaurant is the best value restaurant in clear lake. Very elegant, clean, and good quality food for $14 or less. Only problem is wait time which usually is 30 minimum."
