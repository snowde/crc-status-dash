Sabrina B.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",36,28,96,5.0,10/9/2017,"Came here for lunch with my husband on Saturday. Normally, there is a long wait to get seated because this is a very busy mall, but to our surprise, we were seated almost immediately! The host was very nice and greeted us with a big smile. Our waitress was also really friendly, made sure our drinks were topped off the entire time and had bread.  We had the Fried Macaroni & Cheese for our appetizer, which if you've had it, you know how perfect it is! For our meals, I ordered the Chicken Piccatta and my husband ordered the Factory Burrito. The Chicken Piccatta was cooked perfectly. My chicken was so tender, I didn't even need a knife to cut it. My husband said that the Factory burrito was the best burrito hes ever had, and for him, that's saying something. He said that he was able to taste all the different flavors going on and the guacamole that came with it was really good. You could definitely tell that it was fresh.  Unfortunately we were too full to eat dessert but normally I get the red velvet cheesecake."
Melissa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,54,48,3.0,11/30/2017,"Grabbed a quick late night bite here and it was good! Our server Pasia was really sweet, (which always makes my experiences anywhere much more gratifying !!) and she was efficient. The fried mozzarella was good but we had to ask for the marinara sauce after we were served. It was odd that it didn't come on the plate. It also seemed they didn't care about the presentation of the food -- it looked a little messy  (see photo ). It was a good appetizer - nothing special but exactly what you expect from a chain restaurant.  My friend and I shared grilled steak medallions off the Skinnylicious menu. It was a perfect size for us wanting a small meal. We asked for it to be cooked medium and they cooked it just right. ----All around it was a satisfactory experience!"
Ashley P.,"Frisco, TX",117,89,183,2.0,11/8/2017,"I feel like chain restaurants in general don't really deserve yelp reviews, but I'm writing one anyway.  5/5 cleanliness and environment  ?/5 - it's hard to rate the food because some is fantastic and some is terrible. My favorite items are the sweet corn tamale cakes, chicken Madeira, and chicken Marsala.  5/5 for their desserts. They're all amazing! I like the tuxedo cheeecake.  5/5 for service. The service here is always great, consistently."
Heather C.,"Dallas, TX",15,64,76,4.0,11/25/2017,"Black Friday. 20 minute wait, but that is expected. Hostess was good. Gave us buzzer. You are able to sit outside or go to Barnes & Noble for a bit. It did take awhile for waitress to come over, but she apologized & offered me a free drink & salad. Bread & salad were good. I had the chicken club. It was tasty. Fries so so. Hubby had spaghetti & meatballs. He liked it but said too much sauce. Food took 40 minutes. Service is good. Know this is not place if you are in a hurry. Dawn was a good waitress."
Susan D.,"Irvine, CA",0,226,,5.0,1/6/2018,"We""ve been dining at Cheesecake Factory for years but never reviewed It's because it's always a pleasant experience. Great food,clean ,good service . One of the few resto we frequent.I love everything I order Always consistent in quality. Presentation and taste in any branch even those we've dined in Los Angeles is great. The lunch specials are just as overwhilming"
Kou L.,"Dallas, TX",39,89,996,1.0,10/14/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory in California and I would have to say my experience here is so poor. I've never had to wait in line to get my dessert and having to wait in line for a piece of dessert is ridiculous. I love Cheesecake Factory but the structure and management of this place sucks! Why not close off the entrance to and from the mall? It's already so busy, that just makes it more congested.  I just looked at my chocolate tower truffle and there is no truffle on top like before... did this change?!? I'm not impress, well not likely come to this Cheesecake Factory."
Taylor S.,"Dallas, TX",173,181,209,4.0,10/15/2017,I used to go get their caramel macchiatos to go because they're honestly that good! Can't go wrong with herb crusted salmon either!
Crystal E.,"Lewisville, TX",16,100,10,5.0,10/7/2017,"I am never disappointed when ordering at TCF, unless I order a salad when trying to be health...it's not their fault though, its the salad's,   I also like to eat my weight in bread. With occasionally devouring the avo-eggrolls. Cheesecake is my favorite dessert so I don't think ANY of their desserts are less than amazing. Last visit I had the pumpkin pie cheesecake (my favorite of all time) and the one with chocolate and PB. Even though they are a bit overpriced I still keep going. Must be good then! This is the most disjointed review I have ever written, but I am 1 day post op and have opioids and benzodiazepines on board."
Mariam I.,"Carrollton, TX",258,95,121,4.0,4/26/2017,Cheesecake is my go to spot! Everything here is always on point. The location is always poppin as well and it isn't too far from my home which is perfect. It's also located in the mall so after eating too much you can just walk it off by strolling the mall.  My number one go to item is the fried Mac and cheese. It is the best appetizer they have and honestly if you aren't starving you can eat all four of the as a meal. But if you come to cheesecake make sure you try this! You won't regret it.  They're food is always very good and they're always adding new items every now and then. The only problem I have is that the menu is so big that I get overwhelmed sometimes. But one of my favorite entrees is the chicken maderia! Especially if you like mushrooms. The service here is also always on point. They definitely work for their money.  Now to the cheesecake. My two favorites are 30th anniversary and red velvet but they have a bunch of other options to try from as well. Honestly you can't go wrong with any of them. So if you still haven't been here make sure you check them out.
Jenny W.,"Dallas, TX",296,96,435,3.0,8/21/2017,"Expansive menu, ok but overpriced food, great service.  I've been to Cheesecake Factory a few times and have gotten their almond crusted salmon salad, cajun chicken pasta and shrimp scampi. Almond crusted salmon salad: It comes with more kale than salmon, as expected. Fortunately there is also creamy ripe avocado that can be mixed with the kale. Would taste a lot better with more salmon and some arugula.  Cajun chicken pasta: Best dish here. Most of the dishes I've had at Cheesecake are too creamy or bland, but this has a good Cajun kick and is not just covered in sauce. Shrimp Scampi: Do not get this. I'm a huge fan of shrimp scampi, and while it's true that this place is not an Italian place, I didn't think it would be that off. They used no lemon or white wine in this, and the shrimp was coated with flour and fried. The angel hair pasta was dry and flavorless. Everything about this was disappointing.  Maybe I should try a burger next time?"
Omar L.,"Euless, TX",31,11,67,5.0,12/13/2017,"This location was great as usual. Was doing a little Christmas shopping, for hungry and stopped to grab a bite. I want to thank Patrick for his hospitality and great energy. Great recommendations, very attentive (even though he was busy) and made us laugh. Food was great as usual, couple drinks.  A beautiful end to our wonderful evening."
Andy D.,"Coppell, TX",0,4,,2.0,12/29/2017,"I honestly do not understand the fascination with this restaurant.   On any given night there is a 30 to 45 minute wait.  The menu is huge but they don't do any of it well, especially considering the high prices.  Service is below average.  The only reason they get 2 stars from me is because the decor is better than Chillis and the cheesecake is excellent.  I suggest getting a better meal elsewhere and then ordering the cheesecake to take home."
Keith W.,"Plano, TX",0,20,,3.0,12/29/2017,"Consistent and good food quality. Location is in the mall.....ugh.....If you love cheesecake or know someone who does- like your date, it's worth a visit."
Raheem F.,"Garland, TX",5,28,33,4.0,11/28/2017,"I came here for the first time with a large group of people and overall it was a great experience. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken pasta which was really good and the chicken was seasoned well. I really liked the pasta sauce too, it was kind of like a Cajun alfredo sauce. To end the meal I ordered their Celebration cheesecake and it was a disappointment. Although it looks very appealing it just didn't taste like what they claimed to be a ""celebration"". It was more like a funeral to be honest. The flavors didn't go together and the cake part was kind of dry. I didn't even end up finishing it. However, I know they make plenty of other cheesecakes here so I'm bound to find one that I like! The service was amazing and the waiter was so funny and attentive. I know the menu is pretty big so I'm not going to let one menu item call it quits for me."
Charlie N.,"Dallas, TX",102,92,5,1.0,8/7/2017,"We went here after a full day of shopping ready to enjoy a few over priced drinks and generic meals.  Upon arriving, we were told the wait would be about 40 minutes for our table. This wasn't a problem as my sister and I are other nerds and love to peruse the aisles of Barnes and Noble.  When we did get called to be taken to our seats thought, I almost ate it (for those who don't know what that means, I almost fell and broke my hip) because of the wax on the floors. I had a horrible time going to the restroom and nearly fell multiple times.  I don't understand why the management at this location didn't take this seriously as any person could have fallen and hurt themselves placing the establishment in financial jeopardy.  I don't have much to say about the food as it was, as I'd mentioned before generic. Most everyone goes there to enjoy the company and the ambience more than anything."
Mika S.,"Dallas, TX",28,102,71,5.0,2/2/2017,"Sean is the best bartender, my favorite here. I always receive exceptionally fast and friendly derive from him. He adapts my drinks and recognizes my order.  I pop in even when it's busy because I know he'll take care of my order promptly and thoroughly. Thanks!"
Jona G.,"Frisco, TX",122,199,1062,4.0,1/7/2017,"This location is in stonebrier mall.  I hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in a long time and I really liked it.  My waitress was really great and made my Cajun pasta extra spicy for me.  I was surprised it was actually spicy honestly.  Their menu has tons of options to me almost too many.  It's overwhelming trying to pick something from their menu, but then it's also great they can satisfy nearly anyone.   Of course you have to get Cheesecake if you come here.  There are a few I'd like to try.  It was hard to choose just one!  Will be back for sure."
Taylor R.,"Lake Dallas, TX",84,26,47,3.0,11/4/2017,The food is always great and of course so is the cheese cake! Be careful not to fill up on the bread!!! It is so freaking good! The service we had was really not good to though. They were busy and I am understanding of that but it took 15 minutes before we got our lemonades and the waitress gave us the wrong check. I suggest going at an odd time during the day to avoid rush hour as the waiters seem to get overwhelmed.
Devon J.,"Frisco, TX",37,164,186,5.0,5/29/2017,Elijah was our server and he was new (which he was forthcoming with) however I never would have known if he hadn't said anything.  The service was great from the host to the server to the runners and to every other server walking around. The staff seem to really get along and respect each other. It makes for an enjoyable experience even if the food isn't great...BUT the food was awesome too! Tamale corn cakes! So good!  We will be back for sure
Tiffany W.,"Dallas, TX",52,76,148,4.0,3/30/2017,"The boyfriend and I decided to stop in one night after a late movie and the AMC in the Stonebriar mall. I was excited to see they stayed open, until midnight on the weekends. It was about 10:30 pm and surprisingly the restaurant was full. I wouldn't call myself healthy but seeing the calories on the menu definitely made me rethink a traditional entree. I ordered the skinny chicken pot pie, I really didn't miss the unhealthy parts of the pot pie. The boyfriend ordered grilled steak medallions he really enjoyed it. Overall very surprised we enjoyed this restaurant."
Carolina E.,"Carrollton, TX",276,100,303,3.0,2/27/2017,Cheesecake is always hit or miss for me. This place is anywhere from 3-5 stars depending on what you order and 2-5 stars depending on service. Their brown bread is delicious- the wait times are extremely long if you go on a Friday or Saturday night. Regardless- I still love the sliders and their fries so I go back even if service isn't always incredible.
Angela C.,"Plano, TX",35,67,221,4.0,4/9/2017,You can never go wrong with a slice of cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory. Service was quick and nice. Our waitress Raquel was very sweet and always made sure our bread and drinks were filled. If you get fries make sure to ask for extra crispy or they come out a little on the soft side. I also love how the calories is listed beside everything on the menu.
Alvin H.,"Frisco, TX",35,205,76,2.0,3/15/2017,"Purely personal and does not reflect what my wife or kids think of Cheesecake Factory, but I dislike their food. Think ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" and that is what Cheesecake Factory means to me.  Even when I ask around with friends, there is no single entree that stands out as being ""awesome"".  For most restaurants, they are known for being really really good at something right? It could be the shrimp, or atmosphere, or meats. Cheesecake Factory is known for cheesecake (and usually the only reason I go) but their entrees are generic and undeserving of a ""eating out"" excuse.  Purely my opinion and my wife/kids disagree. Honestly, your calories to deserve to come from a better kitchen.  The notion of ""factory"" is very real here; besides how do you think they can offer 35 versions of pasta??!  Yes I exaggerated. Highly laden in guilty calories (look up how many calories their cheesecake has, or why some pastas have over 2k calories) and you'll see why I love to dislike Cheesecake Factory.  If I want guilty pleasure, I'd go to Estillo Gaucho.  If I wanted deserts, I'd hit up Andy's.  If you want to please a party with very different tastes, have $100 to spend, don't mind a 45 minute wait.....come to Cheesecake Factory.   One word - UGH"
Tianna S.,"Frisco, TX",68,11,2,3.0,11/19/2017,"This is usually my favorite restaurant (not this paticular cheesecake factory) to go to but had such a bad experience tonight...My husband and I got there at 6:30 Our waitress was forgetting everything we had to remind her multiple times (asked for bread, buffalo sauce for my buffalo chicken sandwich, a menu for cheesecake, a to go tea) My food wasnt warm, we tried to make the best of it but it took her extremely long to get anything we had asked for...when it came time to pay we paid with a giftcard, she forgot to give us back the giftcard. The manager Jessica was kind about it. We are just now leaving 2 hours later. Still very unsatisfied with our overall visit tonight. Wouldnt recommend this particular cheesecake factory."
My O.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,11,,3.0,11/13/2017,"The food is great.  They have a huge selection, so there's probably something for everyone.  The portions are huge, so be prepared to take a lot home.  (In addition to the cheesecake you will inevitably buy-its worth it) The reason I gave this three stars is that the service isn't great.  They have a lot of people coming in and out and the restaurant gets a little messy.  It is also so loud that it's hard to carry on a conversation at your table."
Jose Y.,"Plano, TX",84,21,694,5.0,5/3/2017,I love this place Is awesome the waitress are nice she was cute too I would love to go there and chill with everyone there even her so yeah love ya guys
Yong Y.,"Richardson, TX",61,214,345,3.0,12/1/2016,"Alright, the famous and loved Cheesecake Factory. I came here with 3 other people on a Wednesday night after playing at Dave and Buster's. We sat outside and man, are their heaters hot! It got a little unbearable which we asked the waitress to turn it off. She was pleasant and didn't give us attitude.  While our service was good, it took us FOREVER to get our food! We all got an entree each and it was 40 minutes. Our waitress apologized but we were hungry!!! Anyways, the food was ok for the wait. I do think it's more of a dessert place. Like get some cheesecake but maybe not eat dinner.  Yeah, that's my only gripe. Also if you're a first timer, the menu is overwhelming like others have said. I only suggested here because 2 of my out of town friends have not been.  Their cheesecake is good tho! I do like the original cheescake the best. The only good thing is that it's convenient for families and since the menu is so big, everyone can find something to eat."
Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",573,839,1171,1.0,10/6/2016,"The service is absolutely horrible! My friend and I came to have drinks and share a slice of cheesecake around 3pm in the middle of the day and when we walked in, there was no hostess behind the counter.  We decided to go out on the patio and grab a table since the patio was almost empty and there was no one else to help seat us.  A waiter ended up coming to our table and brought silverware, plates, and menus.  He conveyed that he'd be back soon to take our orders.  About 10 minutes later, a worker named Kavina came to our table stating that we needed to get up and go to the hostess desk because we weren't allowed to sit at the table we were at.  We asked why and she said that they were short staffed on the patio and we couldn't sit there.  I told her we only wanted drinks and would even pass on the cheesecake, and she stated we couldn't stay where we were to even have a drink!  The few others that were out on the patio stared at us as if we were criminals and watched as we had to get up to go inside with her. When going back in, I asked to speak to a manager and was told that they were busy.  I left vowing to never return to this location!"
Shelly M.,"Mesquite, TX",108,110,135,2.0,3/30/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is never high on my list of places to eat but I had a business lunch so here we go.  I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and it was poorly prepared. The shrimp was so overcooked that it was rock hard (almost) and inedible. The sauce had a whole stewed tomato in it the size of my fist.  Service was slow. Their menu has a ridiculous number of items if you're a fan of the big menu. I find that a restaurant usually doesn't master a menu like that and I'd rather have fewer choices and get something really well prepared. The calorie counts on the menu are insane. 2000 calorie salads anyone?
Steffy N.,"Dallas, TX",137,177,361,5.0,5/20/2016,"I've been here a few times and man is it good! The bread we are served before our entrees are amazing :) I like their Four Cheese Pasta, Fettuccine Alfredo, etc. I always eat pasta from here and it's always rich in flavor, beautifully presented and creamy. I like my pastas super creamy but of course you can ask for lighter sauce. The cheesecakes are HUGE. I've had the Original, Oreo, Godiva, and Chocolate cheesecakes. All of these were so good and rich. If you've got a sweet tooth, you should try these cheesecakes. My favorites are probably the Original and Oreo.  Service has been great here, waiters have always been attentive. The restaurant is doomed light, but decorated beautifully. It's great for groups, they have huge booths.  Great food, great place!! :)"
Lindsy H.,"Allen, TX",429,707,1284,4.0,11/7/2016,"(3.5 stars rounded up) I've never frequented The Cheesecake Factory, but since moving to Dallas I find myself there more often. The service is usually pretty great. I've only experienced lame service at the front door. About 50% of my visits are with my two little ones and not once has anyone helped me with the door. They literally sit at the hostess stand and watch me struggle trying to open TWO sets of heavy doors and maneuver my stroller in. Oh and they watch me struggle again when I leave. The menu is VAST, but everything I've had (see below) has tasted pretty great. The prices continue to rise, which is unfortunate, because it's not a fine dining establishment, and it also keeps me from making this a ""regular"" in my rotation.  ------- Thai Lettuce Wraps - a great small meal or an appetizer to share. Either way they're tasty. Chinese Chicken Salad - lots of wontons and rice noodles, I'd ask for 1/2 the amount they usually put on. The dressing is the best part! Oh, the chicken is chilled, not warm. Old Fashioned Burger & Classic Burger - both really juicy and tasty, without being too greasy. I could take or leave the bun, and the fries are pretty yummy, although there could be more :) Cheesecake: *Try the low carb cheesecake, it's really yummy! It has almond crust instead of graham cracker. *Adam's PB Cup Fudge Ripple is SUPER rich and yet oh so good. *Dulce De Leche is also really sweet, but also good. But my go-to, the one I crave is the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake - YES please! I could honestly eat two in one sitting, but I won't :)"
Alikhan S.,"Carrollton, TX",0,6,,1.0,12/11/2017,The lady that helped me to go was not patient with my order she was on the phone at the same time they should move there phone so they can properly take a to go order... I waited for 15 mins and they had it wrong the put it for here and not for to go... I've heard good things about the cheese cake factory but I didn't have a good experience the lady that helped me her name was Hannah J.....
Whitney C.,"Frisco, TX",16,72,21,1.0,3/24/2017,"We love Cheesecake Factory and go all the time.  My mom was visiting for her birthday and we went for lunch.   We sat down at noon before the lunch rush, quickly ordered since I had 2 of my kids.   It took 50 minutes to get our food, and the kids meal came out 10 minutes after ours.  We were never offered drink refills and they didn't do anything after I told them it was her birthday.   We spoke to the manager about the issues and were told they would do something on the bill for the trouble but our bill didn't have anything taken off.  I'm deeply disappointed with the service especially since it was a special occasion."
Dominique L.,"Allen, TX",67,14,2,2.0,8/17/2017,"Let me just say overall, I've been to many Cheesecake Factory restaurants, but this one was the worst experience. Not horrendous, but definitely not what you'd expect when their ""RECOMMENDED"" gratuity is freakin 22% (on receipt). My parents are visiting, so we decided try out The Cheesecake Factory located next to Dave and Buster's, since we planned on ending our night playing games and it would be their first time dining here.  The wait was not long at all, 15 min tops.  Customer service was very lackluster. Our server was Ian. He was nice, not abrupt like some horrible servers, but he lacked attentiveness and personality or was not personable.  The most upsetting part was the FOOD. We waited at least 45 minutes for our food.  Ian stopped at our table once in that time to let us know he apologizes but the food is taking a bit longer than expected and he cleared our appetizer and bread plates. The food is finally delivered by a runner, not our server. Our food was COLD!!  He checks on us 5 minutes after we received our food and I asked what was the purpose of us waiting on our food for 45 minutes because all of our food was cold! The only thing that was warmer that cold was the middle of my potatoes! It was very discouraging because I hoped my parents would have enjoyed the experience here. Unfortunately, my dad definitely did not. All the fries on the kids plate and my dad shrimp plate were old and stale. My mother and I ordered chicken madeira. Our food was cold to the touch. There was hardly no cheese on our chicken which was very odd. The one corner of cheese we did find was on the end piece of one of the chix breast and it had already hardened from being cold. Overall, we loved our chicken madeira. The flavors on that is always wonderful. So our server did tell management and he recommended that he could recook everything fresh but we declined definitely because we had already waited 45 minutes for the food on top of having other plans after leaving from eating. He comped our 3 slices of cheesecake, but that is definitely not what I wanted. What I wanted was a delicious hot meal to enjoy with my family. Sad to say, money was lost here because I had plans on buying a gift card for my parents to go to the location in Tennessee and my father quickly declined!!! Oh FYI, even though the service was not great, Ian still received a 20% tip. But if you read this, you need to do better Ian!"
Shan D.,"Baja California Sur, Mexico",49,2,,3.0,10/1/2017,Stopped for Sunday brunch with my daughter. We both ordered French toast which came out with 2 pieces per order. Both of us had one piece burnt to the point even the chef would not have wanted to eat yet was served to us. Pricey meal for 1/2 of it to be inedible. I didn't complain because I had already complained about the coffee which was very bitter and didn't taste right. The waiter said he would brew another pot for me. That cup was even more bitter.  The waiter asked if wanted to take it home and I showed him how they were too burnt to eat. He apologized. They did make it right and only charged for one of the 2 meals and also didn't charge for the coffee.
Vivian N.,"Richardson, TX",245,335,77,3.0,10/19/2016,"I've only been here a few times. The two of the times I've been here involved cheesecake, the one, and first time, I was here was for food. The food was not so good, so just cheesecake it is. The service is usually okay when I've been here. It's probably because I'm always at the bar, so no complaints there. The staff is usually friendly, so I have no complaints there. The food is not good. They somehow manage to make their dishes extremely unhealthy, dry, and bland all at the same time. Their bread is good though, so that's a plus.  Their drinks are good, but also, really expensive. One of my favorites is the expresso martini. It literally tastes like slightly sweetened black coffee with a kick. Although it is good, it is not worth $11.25. That's pretty pricey in my opinion. The cheesecakes are literally the best. They are probably the only reason why I go here in the first place. They are super high in calories, but so worth it. I don't think I've ever hated any of the cheesecakes I've tried here. They're all super dense and rich, with tons of flavor.  In conclusion, I would probably only go here for the dessert. The drinks, although pretty good, aren't worth the price. The food is not worth the price...or calories at all."
Angie H.,"Frisco, TX",219,273,1512,3.0,8/29/2016,"The food was pretty good. The Cajun chicken littles were good but not spicy at all. I had the asian lettuce wraps, which are always amazing. My daughter loved her orange chicken. My hubby had the spicy chipotle chicken pasta, which was flavorful and spicy, but not hot. We were all pleased with our choices. The only negative was, our server Ian, was extremely slow and never around when we needed him. He was standing around talking with friends quite a bit. Guess he finds them more important, but they are not leaving him a tip."
Jesse S.,"Little Elm, TX",108,782,26,1.0,7/31/2016,"Came in here at 5:30pm on a Saturday. It took me 10 minutes just to get on the waitlist. There weren't a lot of people ahead of me, but apparently writing down someone's name and party size is hard and takes a long time. I was told the wait time would be 1 hour and 10 minutes for our party of 5. The lobby here is tiny and there is no place to sit and wait, so had to sit on the floor of the entrance to the mall. After an hour and a half, we were walked past several large empty tables and given a table for 4 (reminder there were 5 of us). After 10 minutes, our waitress came to take our orders. We placed our order and asked for some bread, as we had been now waiting an hour and 40 minutes. After 15 minutes, the waitress came with our drinks but no bread. Asked again for some bread. After another 15 minutes, the waitress came with my wife's appetizer. Asked again for our bread (every other table was given bread promptly). After another 15 minutes, our entrees came out - still no bread. We have now been here for 2 hours and 25 minutes. I imagine the bread is made continuously and the waitress just has to grab it and bring it to your table. We asked the food runner who brought us our entrees for some bread and she had it out to us within 2 minutes. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. My plate was burning hot and the spaghetti looked and tasted like it was made the day before, refrigerated, then microwaved and served to me. Our inept waitress never came back to check on us, although after waiting for some 3 hours, I was too hungry to waste time sending back my entree. More waiting while our glacial waitress very slowly brought the check and processed the payment. Not sure why I need to leave a tip at all since our waitress just takes our orders and enters it into a computer (something I could do myself if they allowed it). The waitress doesn't bring anything to your table except drinks and supposedly the bread. Even by the Cheesecake factory's already low standards, this was a complete fail."
Carly P.,"Frisco, TX",0,3,,2.0,12/9/2017,"l was very disappointed last night when l came in. l understand that it is a popular restaurant, and so it was very busy. But when they told us the wait was gonna be around an hour l thought that was fine and it was for my friends birthday so we stayed. comes almost 2 hours later, we asked about our table and they said it was almost ready. waiting about 30 more minutes we ask again and finally get to sit down. by this time it was 9:00 and we had gotten there around 6:30. Our waiter was nice and made we sure always had bread and refills, but the service was slow, and our food took forever. Seems like they put adults and families before teenagers, which isn't what l like to see in a restaurant, especially after waiting over 2 hours."

This place is dirty from the dressing cans in the display, the seating full of uncleaned crumbs to the floor. The floors were grimy and slippery. The food was sub par in that I know jambalaya and what they were serving was not it. Our young waiter was not an experienced server. I had never eaten at the place and will not give it a second try. Pay more, reserve a table and enjoy much better food than this place. Oh btw, the deserts were good (carrot cake and salted caramel cheesecake) which is the additional star."
