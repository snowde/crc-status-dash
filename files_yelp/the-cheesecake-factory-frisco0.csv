Kat T.,"Plano, TX",13,87,15,1.0,7/18/2013,"I usually have enjoyed my experience at this location.  Last night, we had a wonderful waitress, and the kitchen seemed accommodating to my dairy allergy however, my salmon came to the table completely undercooked.  It was pretty raw in the middle.  It's the first time I've had it come out like that.  The waitress said it looked raw to her as well. We'd already waited an hour for our food, so the send back was a huge issue.  By the time it came back out, my husband was done, and I'd munched on sweet potato fries until I was full.  I picked at it and that was it.  It was a 20 dollar entree. The manager came over and apologized and offered a free dessert.  What a disappointment.  I have a newly discovered dairy allergy and they have not one single dessert I could share with my husband. So you think they'd at least offer to comp HALF the meal at least... NO... they offered nothing more that a free dessert I can't have.  Do you think I want to come back here? No, I can spend my money at other places, get better food, and quicker service.  Shame on you for taking my money.  I've noticed more and more problems at restaurants and this wasn't the worst but only because my husband's food was good and the waitress tried her best."
A A.,"Plano, TX",7,11,,5.0,4/19/2014,Always good food. Highly recommended.  Even good option for vegetarian.  Avocado rolls yumm.. Zucchini fries  Roasted chille rellenos  Salads  Pumpernickel bread love it
Andy P.,"Dallas, TX",262,503,8,2.0,10/29/2014,"Ugh, this place is the epitome of chain restaurant hell. Huge menu, cookie cutter booze selection, and always a wait. This particular location seems to always be busy due to its location in the mall. However, a few perks I do enjoy now are the stroller parking and abundance of children. Why? My kid can scream bloody murder and no one cares because every other table has a little one of their own. The food and service are ok if you know what to expect. Never my choice or even on my shortlist of chain restaurants, but the factory runs itself well."
Paula S.,"The Colony, TX",164,176,22,4.0,8/16/2013,"What is there not to like about the Cheesecake Factory? Yeah I know - its a chain; it's a circus during dinner on the weekends;and they don't advertise their calorie counts.  I have to admit, though, every time I've been here, I've had good, solid service; good food; and best of all, good drinks (their strawberry martinis are a bit pricey but they are THE BEST).  Yes, I believe in supporting locally owned businesses, but Cheesecake Factory fills a niche. Have a large party with picky eaters? Take em to the Cheesecake Factory. If you can't find anything you'd like to eat on their menu, then you need to stay at home.  My favorites are - Avocado Eggrolls, Pot Stickers, Herb Crusted Salmon, Shrimp Scampi, and their burgers are pretty darn good too. Did I mention Strawberry Martinis? Their Lemon Drop martini is pretty darn tasty too. The portions are huge (which means you can take it HOME!) and are good if you want to share with a large group.  Every kind of cheesecake I've tried here has been delicious (my favorites are Vanilla Bean, Oreo, and White Chocolate Raspberry) and worth the Spin class I'll have to go to in order to burn it off.  So yes, I'll continue to eat here - and the fact that most of them are attached to malls also helps. :)"
Jill V.,"Dallas, TX",524,4,,1.0,3/14/2013,I have been going to Cheesecake for many years - usually 3-4 times per month.  I always loved their food - however - I was very disappointed with the Steak Diane - I had this dish over 30 times - the steak is always tender and juicy. I had this a few days ago - and I could barely eat the steak - it was so tough - I thought maybe I just a few bad pieces - took it home and next day - it felt like flank steak or something - my husband also said it was bad...... It was not overcooked at all - got it medium rare - which it should really be tender. I wonder if Cheesecake is switching to a poor grade of beef - to counter the sourcing food costs...... I would rather a smaller amount of meat -but the way they had it before...... I doubt I will order this again - sadly !
C M.,"Dallas, TX",110,4,,1.0,7/25/2015,I am 9 months pregnant and used curbside to go to place an order. Got there and ALL curbside to go spots were taken and there wasn't ONE person in any of the cars. Called up to Cheesecake Factory and they said the same cars had been there for hours. That's absolutely ridiculous - I couldn't even pick up my food - I just had to leave it there because Cheesecake Factory won't enforce towing and there were no spots for to-go or otherwise. Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory and the way they treat their customers.
Quest S.,"Dallas, TX",748,154,93,3.0,2/8/2013,"This is one of the more consistent restaurants I've ever been to. It's been a staple for me for over a decade.  Although I've eaten here at least a hundred times, this review is based on this visit only. We arrived at 8:30 and only waited 15 minutes, which is awesome for Friday night anywhere. They seated us in the side room. I despise the side room. It always feels like amateur hour, but our waitress was very prompt, and pleasant.  We started w/ the FRIED MAC-N-CHEESE (A).  For my entree I ordered the SHRIMP AND BACON CLUB (B-). (+) For the most part, the food was good. The fried macaroni and cheese has nvr been bad. And the service was accurate to the expectation. (-) The fries here are always sub-par. The ranch was thinner than usual, and had a hint of sweetness. And the shrimp on the club was waaay over cooked. They didn't even come close. Taste: 8 Quality: 7.5 Presentation: 7.5 Service: 8 Cleanliness: 9 Aesthetics: 8 Comparative: 7 OVERALL: 7.86 (C+) If it weren't so extremely dim in there, I would've taken a picture of my food. Just for kicks. We all know what the food at the Cheesecake Factory looks like."
Dave C.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,25,7,2.0,1/17/2015,"Long waits @60-90 minutes. Food is good, atmosphere nice but crowded at dinner. CVery good choice for lunch. Coople dozen seats at bar are usually filled with others waiting too. Either arrive by 5:30 or wait. If parking is full your wait will be very long."
Matthew B.,"McKinney, TX",0,6,,1.0,6/18/2015,Whiskey smash is usually a great drink. Bartender was awful. Tasted like an orange purée. No whiskey. I asked for a bit more to which he replied the next time I'll make you a whiskey on the rocks. Charged me an additional $7 on a $10 drink. The kid is a tool.
Benjina D.,"Frisco, TX",835,188,438,4.0,8/7/2013,"Humongous portions are the norm here, and that's no secret. But I ordered a kids spaghetti dish and it was big enough for to make two meals out of it for an adult! It's a waste of money to order anything from the kid's meal for a kid, unless you're going to share it. I'm a huge fan of their buffalo blasts! They are so damn good! Chicken and cheese with buffalo sauce in a crispy, fried pastry shell...OMG! My fav cheesecake is the lemon raspberry, which I think has a great balance of sweet and tart. Yum!"
Sue C.,"Coppell, TX",16,45,203,4.0,6/30/2011,"I've been eating at The Cheesecake Factory for well over 10 years.  I think the food is consistently good.    I had my first Mojito there.  While I'm on it, the Mojitos are delicious.  I've had to learn how to make them myself. I mostly order the salads which thankfully over the years The Cheesecake Factory now has more reasonably sized portions.  They used to be way too big.  All the ingredients taste really fresh and it's easily noticeable in your mouth.  :-) The menu is very large and diverse with everything tasting really fresh.  Can you tell I love freshness?  This means it appears there's little use of processed ingredients. The cheesecakes have always been very tasty and they change the offerings somewhat regularly and seasonally. I have always liked the environment but I understand some are put off by all the baby strollers and kids in the restaurant at this location.  As often is the case, there can be a wait to be seated during regular meal times, which is why I try to go off-peak.   Sometimes you can sneak over to the bar to avoid the wait and still order off the full menu. Cobb Salad and Ceasar Salad are my most often ordered meals. Ciao!"
Miranda J.,"Frisco, TX",84,151,27,2.0,6/14/2013,"As with all Cheesecake Factories, it's very easy to be forgotten about and bumped around with the mall rush.  For the price, the food just isn't that good. Way, way, wayyyyy to many choices. With such a variety, how can everything be of good quality that is clearly shown the right amount of attention? It can't. The cheesecake is just about the only thing to write home about, and that's not too hard to master in my mind.  Even the service is rushed, there are so many employees running around it's hard to ever get your servers attention and it never ever feels like a personal experience, rather someone to fill the booth and pay the check until the next butts can slide in.  It will fill you up...that's about it."
Ginger B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,15,,5.0,2/19/2015,Everything was great. Service was top notch. The food was perfectly prepared. The taste was amazing and we really enjoyed it.  Cajun jambalaya...beautiful  plate of food! Tasted great!  Fish and chips...cooked to perfection! The cole slaw is real good too!
Natasha B.,"Dallas, TX",441,89,18,5.0,11/4/2014,Sean was our waiter on our Anniversary. He was super-duper GREAT! He catered to us and was extremely knowlegable and welcoming. We had a blast!
Rachel P.,"Plano, TX",174,180,213,4.0,5/7/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's overpriced, fattening, and delicious.

Patricia T.,"Plano, TX",0,9,2,2.0,6/15/2014,I always get the Santa Fe salad dinner portion and split it with a Friend. It's pricey at $15 but always more than plenty for two. At this location it looked skimpy and barely any CHICKEN in it as well. Not the usual amount Of lettuce corn black beans either  I'm a small person and usually can't eat all my share but this time I could have eaten much more.   No excuse for this salad not to be the same every time and plenty of it.  Will go back to other location next time.
Dominic C.,"Flower Mound, TX",283,850,169,4.0,2/13/2013,I loved the miso salmon.  Probably get the same thing at least one more time before trying something new.
Sarah H.,"Plano, TX",7,35,25,5.0,7/18/2012,"Perfect date night. The atmosphere is very romantic and classy for night-time with candle light. I have always loved Cheesecake Factory, and this is a nice location. Clean, quick service and nice. There is typically not a wait for the table unless it's dinnertime on the weekends.. ((Which is maybe 5 minutes.))   I love that my water is always refilled and they offer to sprinkle parmesan cheese on our dishes. Nice touch! Free bread as appetizer and it has been warm and delicious every time I have visited Cheesecake Factory Frisco. Note: SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT. I make this mistake every time- I fill up on dinner and forget what Cheesecake Factory is known for.. the cheesecake. Save room for dessert!   Favorites on the Menu: Herb Crusted Salmon paired with the Steak because it is DELICIOUS and a nice portion. I can split with my husband no problem. The mashed potatoes are AMAZING and asparagus is ok. Plenty of food there and a nice bang for your buck. Pizza!!! Surprisingly the pizza here is absolutely delicious. It was not my first choice to order but my son loves pizza so I had a bite of his. WOW. THAT WAS GOOD! I have tried the pepperoni and also the veggie. The pizza is a thin crust style with flavorful cheeses and sauce. So great Cheesecake Factory I am impressed.  So-So dishes are the salads..  Cheesecakes: The cheesecakes are divine. GIANT! You get your $$ worth. You cannot go wrong ordering any of these. They come with thick whipped cream topping which I love to add to my coffee.  Cheesecake favorite is the Godiva Dark Chocolate. Makes my mouth water just typing that. HA! Warning. This is a VERY rich cheesecake. I could only handle about 3 bites and had to take the rest to go.  White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is heavenly!!"
Christopher M.,"Little Elm, TX",10,65,74,2.0,9/23/2012,Normally I would give this place 5 stars.  However after being told the wait for 3 people would be 40 minutes and it ended up being well over an hour.  Couple that with the sauce on the Herb Crusted Salmon not being right I just can't justify it this time.  Not to mention they didn't even offer to take the two salmons that we didn't eat off the bill.  Cheesecake Factory you let me down!
Marcia G.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",45,242,150,5.0,7/19/2012,"Can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. The menu is so diverse, there is something for everyone and the service is always great!"
