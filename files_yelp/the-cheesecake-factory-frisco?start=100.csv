Nataly E.,"McKinney, TX",51,11,37,5.0,6/2/2016,"Love this place. The salads are all amazing, you can't go wrong! The staff is also great. The only downside is the wait- usually about 20 minutes, but it's worth it."
Mary C.,"Richardson, TX",707,123,292,4.0,6/6/2015,"I came here for my friend's birthday. There were about 10 of us and being my first time here, the restaurant was quite large. It was crowded and a bit loud. It seems like they're always going to be busy. I'm not sure what my friends got for their dishes, but they thought it was okay. But I found my enchiladas to be great! It was warm, cheesy, and full of flavor. You wouldn't expect the cheese cake factory to have good enchiladas, huh? Well, life is filled with surprises. The portions are quite large I guess(?). The reason why I put a question mark is because my food was on a large plate, but I finished everything on it. My friends were surprised that I was able to finish everything because I'm apparently ""tiny"" and the rest of my friends packed up all of their food to go. I came here the second time on my birthday because my friend got me a cheesecake. The cakes here are a bit pricey, depending on the size. We got the plain cheesecake. The cheesecake was creamy and the crust is always the best. It crumbles in your mouth. The cheesecake and the crust=a great cake. I can see why they're called The Cheesecake Factory. ;)"
Krystle S.,"Frisco, TX",161,326,29,3.0,11/24/2015,"As far as enormous chain restaurants go, this one is solid. It's hard to complain about good variety, good service, and huge portions. The food is by no means fantastic, but it's not bad.  We came on a Sunday evening shortly before 5 and there was no wait. If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, the menu is a small book. It's insane. You can eat anything from an omelette to a fish entree to a burger to a ""skinny"" salad. There really is something for everyone. I opted for a giant breakfast sandwich on brioche with ham and bacon and egg and cheese. Incredibly filling and pretty tasty, but greasy. Exactly what I expected, in other words. My kiddo had corn dogs with a side of fruit and milk. Typical kids meal. The fruit was cut into non-choking hazard pieces, which I appreciated. Hubs and I shared 2 flavors of cheesecake (honestly, one slice would have been more than enough): the salted caramel and the original with fresh strawberries. LOVED the strawberry one, but the salted caramel was way too sweet for me.  Not my first choice, but I'd definitely come back just for the cheesecake."
Byron S.,"McKinney, TX",86,518,1095,4.0,3/30/2014,"This is a go to place for lunch or dinner. Always a great place for a late lunch on the patio. The menu has some selections, you will always fine something.   The service is consistent and never disappointing.  Don't forget the dessert selections.  The s'mores cheesecake is great."
Priyam G.,"Santa Clara, CA",35,41,15,5.0,3/23/2016,"There is absolutely nothing about this place that I dont like... Oh no.. wait... there is... the really long waiting... but well i guess thats just coz this place is that awesome! Orange chicken, Pastas, Sandwhiches... everything is great The portions are huge!!! I have never finished my entire meal...like ever! Their Nachos and Guacamole is exceptionally good! It is a nice vegetarian friendly place! The cheesecakes... well... they r the best! So many flavours to choose from... you should visit simply for the cheesecakes"
David. A.,"Frisco, TX",0,3,2,3.0,10/5/2016,"I ordered a brownie for my wife which they said could be warmed up and then when we got it the brownie was not warmed uo and they said there was no way to warm it up. instead they brought us hot chocolate syrup. our server asked her manager so I dont pass blame on her as she did a good job. However, if you tell a customer ylur going to do something you should do it."
Jennie J.,"Rowlett, TX",88,180,157,4.0,11/1/2015,The Thai Lettuce Wraps were amazing as were the Avacado eggrolls!  Definitely try the Salted caramel cheesecake!  It's one of the seasonal favorites.  It was rich and so delicious!!!
Nicole M.,"Plano, TX",153,44,157,1.0,2/14/2016,"We're no strangers to Cheesecake Factory.  We love the flagship in Macy's San Francisco (we always do the Kobe Burger there), always did brunch in Waikiki (and loved the ahi tempura roll that's no longer on the menu), and it was our go to in the Woodlands when Mia was first born.  We have always had a great experience and looked forward to coming back. This location at Stonebriar in Plano, however, is the exception and has taken a poor experience to a whole new level.  Some weeks ago, my husband and I got some precious time away and thought to treat ourselves to some QT and cheesecake.  As all the other tables were served around us (although some had been seated far after we had ordered), we expressed our concern which was met wit a somewhat exasperated ""I'll check on it."" And the delivery of barely lukewarm food. It was not was we had hoped to dive into after 45 minutes of waiting--and no, there was no line.  My family had been warning me that service and food quality had been declining, but I refused to believe that an establishment with such a good reputation would be falling apart. And then today happened  It's Valentine's Day, and after church, I thought it would be sweet for us to brunch as a family. It was early, so I thought Cheesecake Factory would be a good choice. It took us 15 minutes to be seated, and our server, Patrick, was very sweet if a little harried.  This is where is goes downhill. We waited over 20 minutes again for our food, and they brought out my toddler's food (pancakes and bacon).  Another 7 minutes later, our food appeared. My husband had the Benedict with breakfast potatoes. Not only was the dish lukewarm, the potatoes were almost black from being overlooked. And then there was my Chorizo and Avocado omelette.  It looked pretty, and I cut into it.  Green peppers, chorizo....and no avocado. How does a main ingredient get left out?! I apprised our sever and a manger brogue out a replacement a few minutes later with three sad pieces of avocado stuffed inside the omelette and now, NO SOUR CREAM on the omelette. I was done. I was livid. And then and there, I realized that the poor service was not a one off, it was an indication of what was happening in their business. Maybe you can get away with it when people are willing to wait 90 minutes to get a table since there is nowhere else to eat in the mall. But if someone is will to wait 90 minutes, they'd should be deserving of at least decent service and food quality as opposed to what our experiences have been the last few times. I spoke to James, the manager, and he has only been here since November. He seems passionate about what he does, and I hope he has the ability to address this sinking service that reflects poorly on the rest of the organization.   If you are considering this location, please take my advice and reconsider. Until they are able to maintain their standards, I wouldn't return."
Sean R.,"Dallas, TX",42,367,2495,3.0,7/21/2013,"This place has a great bar atmosphere.  Their menu is huge with options for all kinds of picky eaters. Knowing that their portions are large, we ordered appetizers. They were all good and did not disappoint. Buffalo Wings - very meaty and tasty. Chicken Quesadillas - generously filled with seasoned grilled chicken, onions and peppers. Chicken Samosas - spicy chicken in a crispy wonton like wrapper.  Came with a yummy cilantro dipping sauce.  The service was good.  Our server was attentive and the food came out quickly. Definitely would return soon."
Meital J.,"Dallas, TX",72,129,58,5.0,8/13/2016,Every cheesecake factory no Matter where it's located deserve 10 stars. No matter where you go they will always have the best food with best service.
Lily T.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",15,103,147,5.0,2/11/2015,"Came here for lunch around 1:30-2 and the lunch crowd was pretty much gone so we got seated right away in a booth. I loved how quick it was.  The bread came out quickly but it wasn't too warm. But it was still good! I can't say no to bread. I ordered the lunch portion of the fresh grilled salmon that came with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Let me tell you, everything was perfected! I finished my meal and I was full. The lunch portion is a good size! The mashed potato was delicious homemade like. And the broccoli was awesome and not mushy! I would definitely order this dish again!  My friend ordered the lunch portion chicken piccata and she loved her meal! She finished it, too.  My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon burger, which is new on the menu I believe.  We all enjoyed everything! We also ordered the raspberry cheesecake which was so magnificent and also the Oreo milkshake. I cannot complain, this was a splendid experience. We will be back!"
Jen L.,"Dallas, TX",25,24,25,2.0,8/20/2014,"Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in years, but decided to come since it was my sister's birthday and we both had some gift cards. As soon as I stepped through the front doors I remembered why I had avoided it for so long.  The wait time for this place is crazy. For a lunch for 2 on a Wednesday, I had to wait almost 20 mins. I tried not to think about it too much because maybe it was just the convenience of the restaurant that made it so crowded (located right inside Stonebriar Mall).  When we were first greeted by our server it was great. She was very upbeat as she took our drink orders. It all went downhill from there. She took about ten minutes to bring out the drinks and even more time to come take our orders. I guess that was okay, since the menu is SO ridiculously long. There was 4 pages of small plates/appetizers, like 6 pages of entrees, and another 3 pages for desserts. Trying way too hard to incorporate too many different things. We ended up ordering the Ahi Tuna Tartare as an appetizer, and the Shepard's Pie and the Herb-Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus as an entree. Tartare was the best part of the whole meal. Shepard's pie was good. The salmon was flavorless, but cooked very well. It was really juicy, which almost made up for the lack of flavor (after I added salt).  PROS: Tuna Tartare (why this review got two stars) and nothing else.  CONS: Super crowded for no good reason, mediocre service, menu the length of an encyclopedia, overpriced and overrated food."
Melissa G.,"Durant, OK",130,4,,4.0,9/10/2016,"It took a little for the server to take our food order.  Was prompt with drink order.  But once we got past the initial hiccup, service improved"
Taylor H.,"Denton, TX",0,4,1,1.0,3/31/2017,"Probably the worst restaurant I've been to. Only reason for giving one star is because we got sat quickly. Took ten minutes to greet us, five to actually bring the drinks. Our food was poorly put together. Looked worse than something from a fast food. Service was absolutely awful (coming from another server). Won't ever be back."
Yoni N.,"Carrollton, TX",0,10,,5.0,3/25/2017,"Me and my family went on a Saturday, we tried to make reservations but since it was a weekend they didn't do reservations,we waited for an hour and a half for food, but they give u a buzzer when your table is done, so during that time we went around the mall, when we finally got in the restaurant they took our orders and brought us some bread and butter, we got our orders in less than 30 minutes, the food was great and they offered many vegan options for the part of my family that were vegan, overall an great experience"
Amanda C.,"Shreveport, LA",1,13,7,4.0,3/25/2016,"Excellent sausage and ricotta flatbread. Crispy and delicious.  Crispy shrimp sandwich was good. Sweet potato fries were okay, but at least they didn't have sugar on them like so many places do.  Had the Red Velvet cheesecake and it was perfect. A moist red velvet cake and wonderful cheesecake. My new favorite way to have cheesecake."
Victoria M.,"Carrollton, TX",0,33,6,1.0,8/14/2016,Ordered a rigatoni pasta with salmon and received it with several spaghetti noodles inside. The salmon was bland and undercooked. Informed the manager of the order not being correct and he tried to justify it. Told him it was unacceptable and he said he would remove it from my order. The woman sitting next to me had an incorrect order and the manager took it off her bill and also offered her a free cheese pizza and more food Togo. Thought that was very unfair! Will not be returning!
Christine H.,"Carrollton, TX",286,61,108,4.0,8/8/2016,"As usual, I loved eating here! We went here today for my cousin's birthday dinner, and the service was great. The prices are on the higher range, so it's a nice place to be at for special events. I will definitely visit again!"
Dena R.,"Allen, TX",166,195,200,4.0,7/24/2015,"We stopped here for a late dinner after a movie, just after 9pm on a Monday night.  It was not busy and we were seated right away. We were brought two types of bread with cold packets of butter.  It's not easy spreading cold butter on bread, let's class it up a little Cheesecake Factory and bring us out some non-refrigerated butter in a little dish?  I know you cook with butter...  We tried the fried cheese appetizer, which was yummy.  Marinara could have had a bit more flavor and a bit more provided with the amount of fried cheese.  It was fried perfectly. I had the four cheese pasta and bf ordered the fried mac & cheese.  My pasta was creamy and cheesy and delicious and was a generous portion.  I might not have finished it all had I not been starving.  The fried mac & cheese were actually almost baseball sized balls sitting in marinara sauce.  He had ordered the dish before somewhere else and expected smaller sized balls.  They were okay.  I ordered the Dulce de Leche cheesecake to go and it was so good.  Let's cool it on the whipped cream though, the amount of whipped cream was as large as my slice of cheesecake!  All in all, a great post-movie dinner."
Jen S.,"Vista, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/16/2017,Horrible experience! Have food allergies and they were not at all careful with my food.  I was unable to eat half of it.  I will never eat here again!
