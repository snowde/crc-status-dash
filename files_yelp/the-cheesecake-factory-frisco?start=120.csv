Jennifer L.,"Ellisville, MS",60,9,2,5.0,9/6/2016,Our waiter was friendly and our food was delicious! I recommend the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. So good!!
Dario R.,"Frisco, TX",4,7,1,1.0,6/18/2014,"Got their 4 cheese pasta with chicken togo and there was nothing 4 cheese about it. It was penne with skimpy maranara sauce and a scoop of white creamy cheese on it. If anything its maranara past with 1 cheese. Went back with a picture to ask if I have gotten the wrong dish, and they told me it was the dish,  that their four cheese sauce is some sort of tomato infused such and such. All i said was oh.. well I didnt like it at all, only ate half cause i was just simply hungry and tossed it didnt come back cause I was tired from work. Dude just said ""oh...sorry..."" and thats it. So now im on yelp complaining, four cheese pasta is a cream based pasta, dont fuck with the basics man. That tomato infused crap should be in The title not in the description. ""Four cheese tomato infused pasta"" On top of that the pasta sauce was purely red barely mixed in with the pasta, hell I can taste the pasta more than the sauce. And yeah I double took on the sauce, there was no cheese in it."
Pris F.,"Walbridge, OH",22,6,1,1.0,3/3/2017,Disappointed is an understatement today! A very late lunch time (2pm) means hardly any customers. I asked for a table for 1 - I love lunching alone sometimes - and twice the hostess insisted there were 2 in my party. Then I ordered what I love and was pretty much scolded by my server cuz they brought me the wrong meal. Sorry  but I know what I ordered! It will be a while before I come back
T S.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,3,1.0,7/18/2016,Overpriced.    Had the bacon blue cheese and date pizza.    Found three date seeds in the pizza.  Credited the pizza.    Should have done more.  Spent nearly 300 on a birthday celebration with family and didn't even credit the birthday girl's cheesecake.      Last dime I spend there.
Tonya H.,"Palm Bay, FL",135,282,546,2.0,10/13/2015,Other than dessert I'm not the biggest fan. Went for a work function and ordered a flat bread pizza and it was burnt. The side salad didn't wow me either. The spinach dip app was tasty. Overall I'll just stick to dessert.
Arul S.,"Plano, TX",13,92,5,4.0,6/11/2016,"Good food but usually long wait almost any day or time. However, this location i.e. ""Stonebriar Centre"" mall in Plano,TX is open until midnight during weekends (Fri and Sat) so if you go there past 10 pm you get seated almost immediately. My favorite is ""White Chicken Chili"" which is awesome!"
Leonard C.,"Monroe, LA",0,3,4,4.0,1/2/2016,"Enjoy the food selections and attentive staff... It can get pretty crowded and noisy on weekends especially, but the food is always good. I visit often whenever I come to the Dallas area."
Christina M.,"Miami, FL",185,89,109,4.0,7/10/2014,"I've eaten at The Cheesecake Factory for years, and it rarely disappoints on food, service or ambiance. The menu is huge, so you're bound to find something for everyone. This is a for sure place, so when I can't think of anywhere else to celebrate an occasion or take out picky eaters, I come here. It is decorated so nicely that it could be a casual and formal setting. My favorite thing that The CF makes better than any other restaurant: Peach Bellini. The worst thing about The CF: They don't take reservations and Friday/Saturday nights are always busy with extremely long waits. If you go early on any day, you should be fine."
Danielle H.,"The Colony, TX",3,36,,5.0,6/24/2016,"I absolutely love the food and the cheesecake. I've tried so many dishes, I don't know if I can pick a favorite. The low carb cheesecake is amazing, I couldn't even tell it was ""diet"" cheesecake. The vanilla bean is delicious as well as the red velvet, and all of the chocolate ones :)"
Juan G.,"Plano, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/17/2015,"The food is good, the management though, racist, specially to Hispanics working there. Horrible place to work if you are not Caucasian."
Mac M.,"Keller, TX",42,44,1,2.0,8/8/2015,Did I come on a bad day? This place should start serving cheesecake only. With such an exhaustive menu you would think that my family (who eat just about everything) would've been happy. My preschoolers entree was so hot she burned her finger and couldn't eat it until an hour later. The sauce on my pasta was super bland. The boys ate theirs but said they didn't really want to ever come back. Also the service was super slow and the waitress was nice  but we hardly ever saw her.  I don't remember the Cheesecake Factory being like this. I've eaten at one in Denver and Arlington and remember enjoy it. Perhaps it was the day we went. Maybe a waiter called in sick. Maybe they ran out of simple herbs and spices in the kitchen. Who knows but I doubt I'll return to this location.
Hunter F.,"Plano, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/24/2017,"So I've been here a few times and the service was decent. The past two times I've ordered the same burger... (a smokehouse) and they didn't even bring out that burger... first time I got it there was no bacon or fried onions.. just veggies. So they fixed it, now I ordered takeout the other night, same burger, it was practically thrown in the box and sent out, got home and saw yet again, no fried onions... that's one of the main things on a smokehouse..."
Eric W.,"Richardson, TX",32,84,460,2.0,6/4/2014,"Let me say that I enjoy Cheesecake Factory but lately something has been up with this location. The food is good and consistent, however the service has gone downhill. It feels like since the place is usually busy, the waiter/waitresses just don't care.  This last visit was early in the week, place not busy as usual. Our server started out great and then we never saw him. All our food came out except for one person's dinner. Almost 10mins later it still wasn't there-not sure if they forgot or didn't make it the first time. At the end of the meal we order cheesecake but it never comes-finally ended up getting it to go. The Allen location is always busy but the service never gets this bad."
Jenny E.,"Houston, TX",161,43,11,5.0,5/31/2016,"We ate here on Friday, and this place is always a win. There's something for everyone on their book of a menu. The fried Mac and cheese appetizer is AMAZING!! I ordered a chopped salad off their lighter menu this time and was pleasantly surprised!! Large portion, perfectly dressed and loved everything on it. I will get this again. Our waiter was great. We were very pleased with our service for our party of 5,... Even during a very busy dinner rush!"
Charles H.,"The Colony, TX",23,50,2,3.0,5/29/2016,"Great place to eat and service is great. But $7.95 for one piece of cheesecake? Come on, that's a joke."
Michael N.,"Dallas, TX",3,16,2,2.0,8/12/2015,"Normally I like Cheesecake Factory (as fattening as it is), but I placed a to-go order for a Cheesecake yesterday and did not receive any additional topping (e.g. Whip-Cream). You're probably thinking, ""It's extra sugar/fat/carbs that you don't need,"" but it's the monetary value that I associate with it, especially for a birthday cake. Paying $51.95 + $5 tip (I used to be a server and I know that most to-go orders don't get tipped, but it goes to the people bagging your food/to-go orders)  for a cake is already outrageous since they don't even make it on site, but paying full price for a cake with missing items is a bit outrageous.  Questionable whether or not I will return to this location."
Ary J.,"Frisco, TX",0,28,2,2.0,11/17/2015,The wait is extremely loooooong and the hostess' are not very nice.... they will not seat you until every single person in your party has arrived..... waiters seem tired and impatient... one time my order came out wrong and even though I didn't tell him till after I ate it and didn't complain he seemed pissed off that i said anything about it!... this is not just a review of one time .... this is over the last three times i've been there because normally Cheese cake factory is my favorite restaurant.. but unfortunately this one is the closest one to me! the food isn't bad but I've had better! at other cheesecake factories
Chanelle W.,"Frisco, TX",85,38,64,5.0,7/11/2015,By far one of my favorite places to eat!!! The menu is so extensive and offers such a wide variety! Brunch lunch and dinner are all amazing! The warm bread they serve is my fav! Alcohol drinks are also a plus here. The only downfall is it's usually busy and has a longer wait to be seated but totally worth it! The cheesecake is the best if your in the mood for desserts.
Michelle L.,"Frisco, TX",2,5,17,4.0,8/2/2014,"So much food. The portion sizes are pretty big (at least the dinner size ones are). I recommend going with a group and splitting an appetizer and entree. Then for dessert, each get your own cheesecake and share!  I tried the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes which was super rich and nothing special. However, the tex mex wraps and avocado wraps (both appetizers) were delicious! The cheesecakes were HUGE (like u are destined for leftovers) but they were good!  I would recommend this place for special occasions!"
Devi M.,"Sherman, TX",51,43,17,1.0,2/13/2016,"I keep hoping. Poor flavor poor service.  Stop for cheesecake and go somewhere else.  This one is the worst I've been to. Servers don't care,  management apparently doesn't either.  Sad shadow of what a CF should be."
