Emma W.,"The Colony, TX",7,44,4,4.0,5/1/2015,"My friend and I had a fabulous girls night out at this Cheesecake Factory. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, and I was not disappointed. Our waiter, Joe, was great! He answered all my questions with a smile and obviously enjoys his job. He checked on us several times throughout our meal and was very friendly. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and my friend the Pasta Da Vinci. She orders the same thing every time and said it was delicious as usual. The shrimp scampi was delicious as well. I would have liked more shrimp considering the amount of pasta, but I guess I should expect much from a pricy place like this. I ordered a Passion Fruit Margarita as well, which was wonderful, but not worth the $11 I paid for it. I also got the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and it was worth every penny. There aren't words to describe the deliciousness of the cheesecake. Overall a great visit, I will be returning, but a little expensive for a college student on a budget. I'll be saving this place for special occasions or a desperate for cheesecake craving."
Sana H.,"Croydon, United Kingdom",0,5,4,5.0,10/29/2016,Great dessert and customer service. The atmosphere is always lovely at Cheesecake Factory.
Caleb M.,"Roanoke, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/13/2016,Terrible service even though it was a birthday party. Waited 30 minutes after being seated for our waiter to take our order. Was an hour before we got refills on our drinks. Waiter never asked us how our food was. Mine Kobe burger was just average and my friends Steak dinner was over done and inedible with way too much pepper. Probably won't be coming back.
Joy V.,"Little Elm, TX",87,45,7,3.0,7/14/2015,Im not a big fan of the Cheesecake  Factory. There food is not the most tastiest. There menu does give you a variety  of options but never tastes like it is describesd My server Dimitri S was great. He was very knowledgeable about the menu choices and covered every  basis of my dining  experience.  Im giving The Cheesecake  Factory  a 3 on the server  performance. It was minus the 2 stars because  the food ever impresses   me.
Brian M.,"Upper Greenville, Dallas, TX",23,9,15,1.0,1/16/2016,"Unless waiting 2 hours for Chili's grade food is up your alley, find somewhere else to enjoy your Saturday evening."
Tu N.,"Plano, TX",2,10,,1.0,12/10/2014,"This is merely a review of service, as we didn't get a chance to eat.  My wife and I walked in to this location, which is in the Stonebriar Mall, on a Wednesday evening and are promptly seated.  The good service ends there.   We sit and wait for a good 5 minutes before a waitress even walks pass us.  I make eye contact with a waitress walking in my direction, but she goes on to assist a table 3 feet from us that was seated AFTER we were. Not wanting to deal with further poor service, we get up to leave and I stop at the hostess desk to inform them of what had just happened.  The two young ladies look shocked as they didn't say a word.  So we turned and walked out the door as we were still hungry."
Brenden P.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,3.0,5/29/2016,"Pretty good food, but lackluster service. We hardly ever saw our waitress and kept having to ask for drink refills, our check, etc. The portions were huge though, so we had plenty of to-go boxes when we finished. The cheesecake was also great, as always."
Julie H.,"Irving, TX",254,84,68,1.0,1/7/2015,"Bad service. Go somewhere else I got the chicken and mushroom lettuce wrap and jambalaya pasta and they were both tasty. However, the lettuce that came with the wraps had really soggy ends..."
Chitra S.,"Frisco, TX",1,95,1,4.0,3/13/2015,"Everything was great. The check in process is a mess, however- they will text you when your table is ready. When I got the text, we went inside and waiting in yet another line to be seated.  Food: 4/5 Yumm.. Food was great- the brown bread that they give at the beginning was excellent. For appetizer, I had the fried mac & cheese which was delicious! As for entrees, I have tried the 4 cheese pasta (it's alright, nothing too great...) and Garlic Noodles (these were pretty tasty.) Service: 5/5 Service was really good! Atmosphere: 4/5 What you'd expect at a chain restaurant.. loud, but not too bad. Overall, everything was good. The cheesecake (I tried Vanilla Bean) was FANTASTIC! 5/5 for the cheesecake."
David B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",94,313,538,1.0,11/17/2013,"First I wanted to stop and think before writing this review. We have had a number of meals at other Cheesecake Factory's, and this was our first at this location. The service was abysmal, as it was obvious Joseph had no care for the customer, only a desire to increase his ticket total and turn the table.  He came up interrupting us even though the place was practically empty, not once or twice but consistently.   The food was no where near up to standard. We had to ask for bread, and once it was tossed onto the table, we found it to be ice cold, rock hard, and nothing like the normal quality warm yumminess the bread  usually has at others in the chain.  The artichoke was far from cooked properly as half of the vegetables normal edible area could not be pried off with a knife. I would have sent it back, but the next time our waiter returned it was with the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and at that point we had eaten enough it would have been inappropriate to send it back. The pasta sauce had a good flavor with plenty of vegetables, but the pasta tasted old like the stuff you get out of a dehydrated pack at the store with the word 'generic' on the wrapper.  The cost for the sodas at 2.95 was standard rate but a bit higher than it should be.  We were at table 212 ticket 0687 on 11/11 22:04."
Kellie P.,"Little Elm, TX",13,6,,2.0,1/7/2016,"It was my first time going and I have been looking forward to trying it. My waiter was fantastic and the customer service in all aspects was perfect! BUT the food was very sub standard, especially considering the prices. Everything was just ok. Nothing was nasty but nothing wowed me either. I've had much better food (and drinks) at other restaurants for sure."
Jayadeep Y.,"Fremont, CA",38,48,21,4.0,5/2/2015,"I was here for the first time in this location. There was a football match going at that time. The place was quite noise but I liked it as it was a sports weekend. The food here was simply superb. We ordered Louisiana Fried chicken pasta, Alfredo chicken, wings and chicken noodles. All the items were nice. I prefer to for lunch some time during weekends"
Kelly G.,"Fort Worth, TX",34,47,6,1.0,8/4/2016,"I would like to give no stars, but can't.  We visited this location for my daughter's birthday lunch.  We arrived a few minutes after they opened at 11am.  The hostess staff was very friendly.  We were taken to our table and the booth side had food on it.  I opened my menu and it had food and crumbs all in it.  The table was filthy too.  It was odd considering they just opened.  It was just really, really dirty.  They brought out the bread and I'd be willing to bet my life it was a couple of days old.  It was hard as a rock.  Horrible.  My daughter and I ordered fettuccine Alfredo to split.  It was dry and the noodles had a weird texture.  I've had it at other locations and it was excellent.  This restaurant seriously failed.  The waitress was nice, but not good at her job.  Not once did she refill any drinks.  Then, she had this thing about clearing plates.  My dad was still eating his burger and fries and she grabbed his plate and left the fries.  She tried grabbing others before we were done.  Worst experience at any Cheesecake Factory.  If they want to improve, they should start by cleaning the place!"
Rayna C.,"Plano, TX",201,208,205,5.0,9/26/2013,One of my favorite places to eat!  Ahi Carparccio is what I always get and love it every time. The main dishes are so huge that I always go for the appetizers.  I have worn my family out on going here and it's never a cheap visit. But the food is always yummy.
April B.,"McKinney, TX",120,728,447,4.0,5/7/2015,The food is so good. The macaroni balls are amazing. Best lemonade I have ever had anywhere. They live up to the name the cheesecake is hands down some of the best there is. I found the prices a little on the steep side.
Arhez D.,"Carrollton, TX",76,158,6,2.0,3/1/2016,Ehhh it's the Cheesecake Factory... Nothing too special about the food but this time we were more disappointed than normal. My husband got the shepherds pie and there was NO flavor at all! Sad part was the waitress recommended it and said it was one of her favorites. I definitely won't be coming here unless I want the avocado egg rolls because those are amazing.. Also I feel like the cheesecake slices are a bit smaller than they used to be
Diana N.,"Houston, TX",481,314,462,3.0,6/19/2013,"Last minute decision to stop by The Cheesecake Factory to watch the game last night because Third Base had an hour wait. The service was excellent. Our server (and the bartender) was laid back and easy to deal with and we got out order pretty quickly. He started getting pretty busy in the fourth quarter and more guests was coming in so we had to wait a bit for our check which is understandable.  The food was standard. I notice a lot of reviews mentioned the Thai Lettuce Wraps was delicious. I didn't think they were THAT great... I prefer P. F. Chang's any day of the week. The small tapas beet and goat cheese salad was great. The other tapas apps were pretty good and small sized; perfect for us since we always over order. The BBQ pizza was kinda blah. Not what I had expected. The tiramisu and cherry cheesecake was a hit, but we couldn't finish it all because we were so stuffed. A bit on a pricey side, but the dishes are big enough to take home and heat up for lunch. Very convenient location, right outside the Stonebriar mall."
Luis R.,"Plano, TX",4,10,3,4.0,4/16/2015,"Let's get right into it.  The food at the Cheesecake Factory is always amazing!   I have never been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered.  I've ordered everything from Tex-Mex egg rolls, martinis and peanut butter waffles.  (Not all in one sitting..LOL!)  The Cheesecake Factory always knows how to delight my taste buds. This location gets pretty busy.  Understandably so, the location is at one of DFW's busiest malls."
Arlinda B.,"The Colony, TX",0,12,1,5.0,4/18/2016,What can I say the cheesecake factory has the best appetizers of anywhere. Their meatloaf meal is probably one of the best meals you can order there. And when you get done with that there's the fantastic choice of cheesecakes. What a great place to go double thumbs up I highly recommend it
Katherine N.,"Little Elm, TX",1,39,,4.0,1/10/2015,Pro:  The food is always excellent. The portions are generous. The menu offers something for everyone. The avocado eggrolls/wraps as an appetizer are really awesome. The salads are huge...a lunch portion is big enough to share. The veggie burger is a great option for those who do not eat meat ad it comes with a side of your choice. It is made of grains and the flavor is amazing. Cheesecakes and and other desserts are all fabulous. The quality is consistent. The kitchen is creative. Cons:  The long wait to be seated. The long wait for service and the lack of attention from your server. The prices are a bit high. It is a chain restaurant experience.
