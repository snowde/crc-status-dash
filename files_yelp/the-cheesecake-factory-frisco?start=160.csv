Crystal A.,"Little Elm, TX",0,5,,2.0,10/12/2015,"My husband and I ate here with our friends and the best thing I can say is my toddler's spaghetti and meatballs was the better part of all of our food which isn't saying much. I ordered off the skinny menu and got the Lemon garlic shrimp and my husband ordered the Smoke House BBQ burger. We spent $70 on lunch and he requested his burger to be well, well, well done and it was still bright pink in the middle. It was all kinds of wrong when it arrived with what was supposed to be and not supposed to be on the burger and my shrimp had nooooo flavor. We as a rule after having worked in restaurants ourselves never send food back so he didn't even bother notifying the waitress. I just feel that with the prices they charge they could at the very least know how to cook a burger properly. The service was decent but food was lack luster to say the least."
Joey P.,"Dallas, TX",5,47,38,4.0,1/7/2015,Always great food and great service. Wild blueberry cheesecake is fantastic!!!!! Drinks are always strong too

Mykie D.,"Valley Ranch, TX",498,898,757,4.0,7/15/2013,Great location. Great customer service. Nice set up and awesome food! This is my fave Cheesecake Factory location. Try the Shrimp Bistro Pasta. You won't be disappointed
Myia B.,"Dallas, TX",503,698,850,4.0,1/13/2013,"If you've visited one Cheesecake Factory, then this one will be no different.  If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory...then the run down: Huge Menu: there's likely something on it that everyone would like. Favorites: Chicken Carbonara, Jumbalaya Pasta, Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes, Wedge Salad, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Oreo Cheesecake, Original Cheesecake. Twisted Salted Caramel Pretzel Spiked Milkshake is yummy (it is also around $10) Entire menu is served all day including breakfast items."
Sara W.,"Cloutierville, LA",75,11,6,1.0,8/8/2015,"Never again. They won't take reservations on the weekend for large parties. Also said they wouldn't be able to hold a birthday cake unless we were physically in the restaurant (kids wanted to go to Dave and Busters for an hour first). ""Manager"" Russ ensured that this regular will not return."
Zach P.,"Forney, TX",1,22,2,3.0,8/9/2014,"Went for my sisters birthday. The food wasn't bad,  some plates were better than others which  is expected from any place just based on taste buds and personal preference. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich,  and I really wasn't impressed much. Not surprising I guess because it's not a BBQ place but since people usually say that everything is good at the cheesecake factory I thought I would try it.  It was just pulled pork mixed with BBQ sauce on what looked like a wheat bun,  with fries and slaw (which was sub-par).  The fries were good though :)  My wife had the skinny chicken enchiladas and she said they weren't good. The waitress suggested something else (a different enchilada plate) which was more expensive so I was under the impression that she  was just trying to up sell which is why we stuck with our first pick.  My dad, on the other hand had a pasta plate,  some Chipotle pasta.  The flavor of that was awesome!  Seriously... I would definitely try that out. You really can't go wrong with that plate.  We all finished with the obvious cheesecake. I had the vanilla bean which was alright. I was sold on the ""mousse""  in the description but it really wasn't that great. I expected mousse like chocolate mousse but I just wasn't impressed. I would have rather stuck with the original cheesecake or quite simply nothing.  I say nothing only because I was full from the bread and dinner itself. It's just a lot of food- not complaining,  just saying...  Overall not a bad experience. Waitress was nice and made the experience fun.  She was working a double but you couldn't tell because she was great!   It is a high traffic restaurant.  I will say that! So if you end up waiting for food,  don't ask why.  Overall wait to get our food wasn't bad.  The only thing was that we had to ask for bread because it didn't seem like we were going to get any if we hadn't asked.  No big deal though... My only complaint is that they wouldn't take reservation. We were a party of 7 but no reservations could be made... Weird and kinda crappy but life goes on and cheesecake happens."
Chris L.,"Dallas, TX",194,878,245,3.0,10/29/2012,Had a drink and the chocolate cheese cake here. The cheesecake was tasty yet the texture was not so good. It was frozen like a brick. I've had much better cheese cake elsewhere. I was hoping for the texture to be more velvety. The chocolate was rich and good though. We wanted to get dinner here but the wait was way too long. They also don't offer reservations.
Andy B.,"Plano, TX",0,33,,4.0,12/30/2015,"My family stopped here for lunch at noon.  Wait time was about 40 minutes which we spent at the Barnes and Nobles next door.  Our waitress was very nice and the food was well presented and rich in taste.  I had Boston Beef Dip and she had some kind of salad.   Unfortunately, my wife and I both had stomach ache later in the afternoon.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the food.  We're just not used to eating very rich and salty food.  Our kids were fine who were downing lot of diet Pepsi or Coke.  Overall it was fine dining experience and I would like to go back and try some other dishes."
Monta C.,"Dallas, TX",132,29,8,5.0,12/29/2015,"Fave place while shopping:) always hot, fresh, and the wait goes by fast with delicious bread once you get to your table! My go to cheesecake is Red Velvet- fried Macaroni and cheese will not disappoint along with the sweet tea!"
Asmeet S.,"McKinney, TX",7,7,,1.0,7/20/2015,"Horrible food, good service !!! We went to celebrate our son's b'day and he ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken ( so did my husband ) and both of them turned out extremely salty, mentioned it to our server, who took it back to the kitchen to get it remade and was returned saying there is no ""salt"" in the dish!! Well, we don't care if you add salt or salty sauce, the dish was done with double the saltiness. When we spoke to the manager, all she said was that she would let the kitchen manager know !!! Really disappointed with her handling !!"
Elissa E.,"Irving, TX",17,92,121,1.0,7/4/2014,"The manager would not accept the coupon that I had, which was fine though he was fairly rude about it. I waited some time to write this review so that I could calm down. The service was horrible. The waitress could not have been less attentive. My friend was visiting from out of town and she was really looking forward to eating at the Cheese Cake Factory. The experience was disappointing. Judging by previous reviews this has been a common experience.  The food was OK, nothing special. The place was not extremely busy when my friend and I were there for dinner. Which is why I was confused as to why the service was so poor. I will think twice before I eat here again. Maybe next time I will just get the cheese cake to-go! My recommendation would be to pick another Cheese Cake Factory location, though this is the only one in Dallas."
Kristen D.,"Plano, TX",189,561,79,5.0,2/15/2013,"I am in LOVE with cheesecake factory.  They have so many menu choices.  I love that I can order a smaller portion and not feel like I am getting ripped off by the price point.    Their lunch and dinner portions are very big, so plenty for sharing.  Two of my favorite things are the spicy pasta dish and the orange chicken.  They also have fantastic chop salads, mexican salad and greek salad.  They also have a BIG skinny menu which is super nice for all of you weight watchers.  The service is always top notch.  If you dont like something, they have no problems getting you something else. (this has only happened once) The waiters check on you plenty, offer to go cups and always share with you their favorite dessert. I do not like cheesecake at all, but like I said I have recently fallen in LOVE with Cheesecake Factory and there are two cheesecakes I will eat: the Oreo Dream and Chris' Outrageous. INCREDIBLE!!!"
Douglas G.,"The Colony, TX",0,1,,5.0,7/14/2016,Amazing selection of cheesecake! Our favorites are red velvet and classic with cherries:) generally get great service here and the food is always top notch!
Madi L.,"Prosper, TX",95,354,328,2.0,4/5/2015,Cheesecake Factory used to be our favorite place to go. After today I won't be going back. This place has gone down hill. I feel like if you go to a big chain restaurant then you should expect really good food not rubber noodles and watered down alfredo sauce. I understand the kitchen can get busy and for us to have one item of our meal to be bad that is fine but for multiple items at the same table while everyone around us is enjoying perfectly cooked food....that's unacceptable. Now I'm stuck visiting the bathroom for the next 4 hours due to undercooked pasta. Thank you cheesecake factory for ruining my day. The only reason I gave the extra star is because the management and staff are actually pretty good and felt bad that we had a bad experience.
Sharath B.,"Irving, TX",0,4,,5.0,10/24/2015,Heaven heaven!!!! This is what my wife screams for this place. We just had desserts till date and indulged mostly on cheese cakes only. But I have loved each one of them.
Manisa K.,"Charlotte, NC",388,243,175,3.0,8/4/2014,"Good location right outside the Stonebriar mall. I have been this location so many times. Food here is always good. Huge portion though. You have to wait to be seated like other places. You will get a loaf of bread as a complimentary appetizer. I love avocado egg rolls. The atmosphere is so nice and clean. Good for family and friends, or even come here for a date. Last time I went here with my friends for a birthday party, it was a little disappointing though. It took out waiter forever to serve us. We asked for birthday special, and he was like we don't have it here sorry and the he was gone again. It was just so rude.  price is ok, just service."
Keene M.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",30,74,14,4.0,8/12/2015,This place was slammed full of people and I still got great service. The food was tasty.
Jennifer M.,"Frisco, TX",0,16,1,5.0,10/10/2015,"Cheesecake and a ton of food options,  can't complain. I usually order the avocado egg rolls, but tried the loaded baked potato tots, a good choice too!  With the fall season comes Pumpkin cheesecake, gooood stuff!"
