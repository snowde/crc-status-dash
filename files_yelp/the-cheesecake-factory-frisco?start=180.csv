Stephanie H.,"The Colony, TX",36,461,57,4.0,1/30/2015,the cheesecakes are really good but have a lot of calories.they taste so good but have a lot of calories.
Casandra R.,"Carrollton, TX",274,82,103,4.0,2/21/2014,Every time we come here we sit outside. I LOVE the patio here. Since we haven't been here in a while I got my favorite The Chicken Picatta. My daughter got cheese pizza and my husband got the Louisiana pasta. I got extra sauce for my dish. Everything was nice. I got Red Velvet cheesecake to go. Our waiter was nice and attentive. We enjoy coming here as a family. Of course we will be back
Yvonne W.,"Allen, TX",0,6,,2.0,5/1/2016,My daughters and I had been anticipating a visit to Cheesecake factory at Stone Briar mall. We had been to one in Michigan and the food was excellent. We went at 4:30 PM and  our wait was not long. But the area they decided to seat us in was filthy with food and papers all over the floor and I almost slipped on the grease on the floor. The grease on the floor was very thick and invisible. The women seating us told us it was just the marble but it wasn't. We were finally seated in the center section. Everything was clean and tidy. Our server was excellent and the speed of service was good.  The next issue was the food itself . I ordered the Steak Diane-which was excellent. My daughter ordered the bang bang chicken and their was no BANG in the chicken ;it was very bland. My other daughter ordered garlic pasta with chicken and asparagus. It was very bland too without a hint of garlic. Our meal of three cost $90. Actually $75 and $15 tip .Don't think we will be going back to this Cheesecake Factory anytime soon.
Kacie M.,"The Colony, TX",13,43,49,3.0,3/17/2015,Came for coffee  n dessert. Carrot cake was ok. Too many nuts. Mocha coffee was great but expensive. Sevice wasnt that great. Maybe next time i wont come 25 min before  closing.
Jennifer Y.,"Austin, TX",486,1024,9615,2.0,12/8/2011,"ALWAYS THE BEST FOOD!!!! I think the most important thing at a restaurant is FOOD, CLEANLINESS, and SERVICE.  But actually FOOD would be more important to be honest.   Of course it's super clean here .....  So that would leave us with the ""service"" part of the ordeal. That is how bad it is here. The service is so bad that it can knock out three stars and bring this restaurant down to a 2 star level!!!!  They have you doing all the things you should not have to be doing with good service. So when you go here be ready to : Ask them to take your drink order Ask if you can order your food Ask if you can order food PLEASE Ask if you can get some complimentary bread Ask if you can get refills Ask repettitive questions and requests Ask what their specials are ... Ask for them to clean the table before being served CHEESECAKE! Ask again and again for the check  and finally but not least  Ask if you can please pay so that you can leave? .... Yeah .. so those 2 stars up there are literally for the quality and taste of food and the sanitary environment they keep the restaurant in.  And the minus 3 stars would be thanks to the bad bad bad horrible horrible~~~ service."
Peyton J.,"Plano, TX",0,19,,4.0,10/16/2015,Amazing! Totally eat here! Awesome service and awesome food. Great bathrooms and cleanliness.
Marzz B.,"Houston, TX",55,25,2,5.0,6/6/2015,"Delicious!  I always love the Spicy Cashew Chicken!  I wasn't sure which cheesecake to try, but had seen another yelper recommended the vanilla bean.  We concur.....it was creamy and delicious:"
Adrienne K.,"Grapevine, TX",54,1,,5.0,9/22/2015,Sit in Alvin's section. Alvin is awesome. Tell him I said so. Also the food was good so if that's what you're into then that works too.
Robert G.,"Cedar Hill, TX",0,8,6,3.0,3/16/2015,Food is ok. Don't order the hot wings. It was so salty that I think I have high blood pressure. Celebrating a birthday. Wish I had went somewhere different.
Ginny D.,"Frisco, TX",10,7,,4.0,8/2/2014,Ok Cheese Cake Factory did just get a bad rap for the caloric content of its menu. But Sometimes you've just gotta be bad and this is a great place to do it.
Nicole P.,"Carrollton, TX",65,41,32,5.0,12/11/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!! The food has always been of great quality - love the hibatchi steak, salmon, and fired artichoke.  I can go there for my cheat meal and not feel like I just ate a bunch of over processed greasy food. It's sometimes noisy and if you're in a two person party they may squeeze yall in a awkward table (so beware and just know to ask for a booth or end table).  I've never had bad service - impressed with their overall customer service."
Mike R.,"Dallas, TX",142,44,8,5.0,7/17/2015,Always great food and great service when we come here. We usually get a few appetizers off the low calorie menu which are tasty!
Aaron B.,"Plano, TX",1,28,1,5.0,6/9/2015,This location is the best branch of Cheesecake Factory franchise. I have been to this location for over 20 times in the last three years and I never experienced anything subpar here. The service is always above the expectation. They have large portions of the most delicious food found at American restaurants. I love this location
J P.,"Dallas, TX",48,21,46,5.0,6/25/2012,"Always a good place to go for dinner. Did not have to wait to be seated and the server came over right away. Our server was Raven. She was very attentive and sweet. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Romano and it was delicious! The food was brought out quickly and was nice and hot.   The server refilled our drinks as soon as they were low. I ordered a Oreo Cheesecake Togo and it was amazing as always!! Top Cheesecakes are: Kahlua Cocoa Cheesecake White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia  and Hersheys Chocolate Bar Top Drinks are  Red Raspberry Martini Typhoon Punch This is a location in a mall but has a great patio to sit and enjoy dinner outside. There is also valet downstairs for the desirables. lol Clean Bathrooms and restaurant so A+ on that!  All in all, Great Place to eat and awesome atmosphere!"
S P.,"McKinney, TX",16,23,,4.0,7/15/2014,"Always good, never disappoints!  Service is slow when it's busy but usually well worth the wait. Chicken Madeira and the pear and goat cheese flatbread is amazing (our usual order).  The peach Bellini is great, and just about any cheesecake you can imagine is on the menu."
G B.,"Dallas, TX",80,12,,5.0,7/15/2015,"At Stonebriar Mall. Can't go wrong, the food is great and so is the selection. Last visit there our waiter could not have been better. Can't remember his name though. Funny guy"
Beetle S.,"Bartlett, IL",1,24,4,3.0,4/2/2015,"It was lunch, high noon, and we were landlocked at the mall and foraging for sustenance. The menu is ridiculously comprehensive and then there's a secondary skinny menu. This can send an indecisive (I know I'm hungry, but for what?) luncher into a death spiral of inertia and self doubt. With a menu this size, there's a lot of options and something for everyone...but in trying to please everyone there's no one thing it does well (cheesecake excepted). We sat outside...nice. Service was fine. No one ordered dessert. A textbook family restaurant.  Lunch for two with tip and water to drink...about $25. Not offensive, also not memorable."
Kelsey H.,"Aubrey, TX",0,4,,3.0,4/4/2016,"I'll give Cheesecake Factory three stars because I've eaten here quite a few times and I am  sure to return :-).  I love this place honestly I do.  However, my last two experiences were not the best.  Long story short dirty utensils and wine glasses are not desirable and that was not the first time.  Also when it gets busy its hard to get good timely service.  The food is excellent  and the atmosphere is great. Please work on the  minor details to help with the overall experience"
Lewej W.,"Dallas, TX",399,30,4,4.0,8/13/2013,Cheesecake Factory rarely disappoints. I kept it light tonight and had the Factory chopped salad. The lettuce was nice and crisp and the green apples were refreshing.  I came with a group of 16 and everyone was taken care of well.  Overall great dining experience.
David N.,"Denton, TX",39,47,55,4.0,11/18/2012,"Good service, staff is good at handling the large crowds that come in from Stonebriar mall. You can valet your vehicle downstairs for free if you bring your Cheese Cake Factory receipt back to the valet stand when your done. Otherwise its $7 + Tip. (that's not bad at all anyways). Good quality food, well prepared, enormous servings. I had the Chicken Burrito Grande and it was huge (I had to take half of it home). I added the picture so you can see for yourself. Over all it was a very good experience."
