B M.,"Frisco, TX",0,58,6,5.0,12/21/2015,"This location is the best one yet. Dimitri our server was excellent and attentive, the pizza was surprisingly good, and reasonably priced."
Jacquie J.,"Frisco, TX",34,109,208,4.0,4/27/2014,Thought I would drop in on Easter as I had not been to a cheese cake in Texas. I am literally given them 4 stars for the service. I don't know about Texans but you can not get into a cheesecake factory on any Sunday  around brunch in less then  10 minutes.  Our server was pleasant although not overly attentive. I ordered my normal chicken  Samosas with a salad and was pleased. I will be returning
Angela H.,"Plano, TX",53,99,101,4.0,4/21/2014,One of the few chain restaurants I enjoy. The selection is endless. The portions are huge and the food and service is very consistent. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Stuffed Chicken Tortillas are my 2 faves. The cheesecake is obviously delicious but please do yourself a favor and try the strawberry shortcake. It's to DIE for.
Mishelle V.,"Plano, TX",6,25,,4.0,1/11/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great restaurant. They have a wide selection of food available. They quality of the food is wonderful and you can tell that the chefs really know what they're doing. The service is friendly and charming. They are also quick and don't keep you waiting long even on their busy days. They really aim for quality in everything they do, and it's great. Impeccable restaurant overall, and their desserts are really wonderful."
Michael K.,"Plano, TX",18,234,55,2.0,2/2/2013,"The food choices I make are unavailable.  Really, no seared tuna at 7PM on a Friday? What, ten minutes to get a straw? You have a runner, you have a busser, why can't a simple iced tea be refilled?  Why can't you check on your tables after the food is served? Huhh? No salsa of some sort for fish tacos? Jeez,  Taco Bell can do better ;-)  (Actually I don't know that, I ve never been!)"
Kasey Y.,"Richardson, TX",0,7,,1.0,5/19/2016,"we went for happy hour and to have a few appetizers and were highly disappointed.  we sat outside on the patio because the weather was perfect.  the food was good and the drinks were good but when we got our bill we hadn't received happy hour prices.  We asked the waiter to ask about it and he came back and said that they didn't offer happy hour prices on the patio, that we had to be sitting in the bar area, per the manager.  we were literally sitting with only a wall in between us and the bar.  it was ridiculous.  we weren't  told before we sat down either which i think is something that a customer should be aware of.  not to mention that the waiter had to come back and tell us instead of the manager actually coming by to tell us himself.  seems like they must only have back of the house managers because their customer service blows."
Mark C.,"Frisco, TX",25,4,,2.0,3/27/2014,"The food was good at this location as it is at most of the other locations.  Our server however apparently had not been trained in proper customer service.  After she took our order, she didn't bother to return to check on us until about 10 minutes after our food had arrived.  I ordered a salad which arrived at least seven minutes after everyone else's meal had already arrived.  One of the reasons we go to this restaurant is just for the cheesecake.  When our server finally returned to clear the plates from our table, she didn't even bother to ask us if we wanted cheesecake. The manager ended up getting our check for us as the server never returned."
Heather C.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,2.0,11/29/2013,"I've eaten at The Cheesecake Factory many times over the years since I first discovered them. This review is to reflect this specific location and not the company as a whole. I love TCF and not just for their wide variety of incredible cheesecakes. I love that they have such a large, diverse menu. It might make picking an appetizer and an entree a little difficult but I can find something there no matter what I'm craving and the food has always been excellent. I have no complaint about the menu or quality of the food. This location however is awful. Their staff is rude and unattentive. Service is SLOW. I mean abysmally slow. I'm the type to give a place more than one chance (unless my experience is just beyond wretched) because I understand that crap happens sometimes. However, three chances is my limit with places and all three times I've been to this location, I've had issues with staff attitude and service. First time I went in there was in the afternoon, they weren't busy but the hostess at the hostess station didn't acknowledge me as she was talking to a server. I walked up and said hello, she ignored me and kept chatting with the server. I said hello again only to be asked to hold on one moment. They were talking about so and so's baby shower so it wasn't an important work matter. After I was finally seated, my friend and I waited 10 minutes just to have a server appear to get out drinks then another 7 minutes to receive our iced teas. I can understand if they were busy and short of staff but they were not busy and there were servers standing around in corners chatting and not looking particularly busy. So there was no excuse for the amount of time getting iced teas took. The rest of the service went that way with out server disappearing for long stretches of time. I complained to a manager who didn't seem very concerned and wasn't very apologetic that it took us an hour and a half to get through a lunch on an afternoon that wasn't busy at all just because our server was taking long periods of time between stops at our table. A second trip there, this time in the evening for dinner, did not yield better results in terms of service. We were seated within the quoted time limit. It took our server about 5 minutes to stop by to tell us she would be right back to get our drink order. We waited 10 minutes for her to return. She took our drink order. A couple minutes later, no drinks in hand, she returned to tell us she was going on a break and someone else would be taking over our table. We waited another 10 minutes and had to get a manager to get a server and some drinks to our table. Our new server was rude and impatient and seemed bothered by having to answer questions about certain menu items. After dropping off our food, we had to flag the new server down to order more drinks and get refills on water. Then before we were even halfway through our meals, we were being offered desserts and to-go containers.  This is the only Cheesecake Factory I've ever gone to and received such horrible service on multiple attempts at different times a day. I love the food and the variety there but will stick to avoiding coming to this location when I'm in the area. Which is when I'm shopping at Stonebriar Mall. It's unfortunate they have such bad service and management doesn't seem to really care to do anything to rectify it as a whole."
Sika M.,"Plano, TX",0,6,,1.0,10/27/2015,"Will never go again! Normally, we love going there, but server Patrick as soon as he took our drink orders he went to his supervisor Corey and lied about not feeling comfortable serving my husband. How could that be when we never received any drinks! We were immediately discriminated against and supervisor Corey and Press were not helpful and asked if we still wanted food! Hell to No!! Why would I Pay you money for food when you LIED, DISCRIMINATED, and refused us service. Will never go there again. CHEESECAKE FACTORY DISCRIMINATE! Warning!!!"
Anonymous A.,"The Colony, TX",16,37,,5.0,12/9/2013,Tried this location! All same :) Tried chocolate tower truffle cake here with some friends...prob was fresh as compared to other locations I tried...but none different! Long wait coz of weekend rush!
Christopher M.,"Dallas, TX",112,32,,4.0,7/26/2014,"Have ver good service here last night. Dana the waiter have a very good personality, the good was great. The only think is the wait time for a seat, but it's to be expected. Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory, just this location in the mall is heavily packed.  The steak was amazing"
Ashlea T.,"Wylie, TX",15,7,4,5.0,7/6/2014,One of my favorite restaurants now! I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It is amazingly delicious.
Preston M.,"Dallas, TX",229,151,27,4.0,1/25/2012,"After a few hours in the mall, nothing is better for the soul than cheesecake. Our server had an interesting communication style that was slightly awkward, but that certainly didn't take away from the fact that he was friendly, fast, and made sure we had plenty of water and tea. We started with our personal favorite, the fried macaroni and cheese. So delicious. I could just eat these all day instead of actual food. Because it was lunch and I wasn't in the mood for too much food, I got the lunch pizza and a Caesar salad. I opted for the white pizza, which is covered in delicious white cheese and spinach. It was good, and there was enough that I took some home and had a good snack the next day. We did have to wait for quite a while to be seated, but it was Sunday at around 1:30-2:00, so it was going to be pretty packed.  We finished the meal with some white macadamia nut cheesecake, which is exactly as delicious as it sounds."
Derek G.,"Plano, TX",1,42,,5.0,7/30/2014,"Just sit by the bar or at the bar. The staff who cover that area are amazing: intelligent, funny, personable, they make Cheesecake Factory what it is. We love going there because the staff make us feel at home. The food is consistently good as well."
Domain D.,"Frisco, TX",394,76,653,2.0,1/17/2012,"This place is really nice, the items I've tried were terrific as well. But the star is the dessert selections. Although, everything else is decent but not a big WOW to wanna run back too."
Cindy H.,"Carrollton, TX",29,14,13,5.0,7/24/2014,Michelle was great! She made sure my pasta wasn't too spicy! She recommended a good wine for the hubs as well. Hubby tried the chicken Madeira for the first time and he loved it. I had the Louisiana pasta (I don't usually like bow tie pasta) but the combination was great!!
Owen M.,"Fort Worth, TX",125,23,23,2.0,10/23/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory does not live up to the expectation and the hype, as well as the price. I was let down by almost every major aspect.  The environment is great, for the most part. We where sat at a table that was just too close for comfort to the tables next to us.  The menu is huge, a staggering 21 pages of choice. On top of that, it has advertisements scattered throughout.  I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, it came with coleslaw and French fries. A standard request. It all came out delicious, except the pork. It wasn't just smothered in BBQ sauce, it was like a sloppy joe. It just wasn't good.  Overall a bad first experience for me, the only thing that could possibly convince me to come back, is how the server handled everything. He was on top of trying to get me something new to eat, and apologized for our table."
Renee S.,"Dallas, TX",0,29,,1.0,7/7/2013,"My son took me to here at this location on Friday July 5 for my birthday. Awful experience. We were seated along an area near the kitchen. It was incredibly noisy but, we decided to stay. Our server looked rushed and harried. When we noticed a kid screaming at an extremely high pitch over and over, when the waitress came over once again, I asked if that table would be leaving soon. She said she didn't hear it. Then the kid screamed again....I mean who lets their children scream like that...ever! Anyhoo, she didn't know anything she was very disconnected. I asked for a manager.  When he came, I asked about the screaming, to which he appeared dumbfounded especially when I said I would prefer not to eat in a nursery. Anyway, he offered to move us to another booth, which was quieter.  Now when we moved, he carried our appetizer but we had to carry our drinks. Fine, but then we were brought our meals sooooo fast, no time to enjoy our appetizer with the wine we ordered.  My meal I have had countless times. Never was it so spicy that it was uncomfortable to eat. I just wanted out of there so I said nothing and had it packed for home. My son's ahi tuna was excellent and that was what the one star is for. The worst part? I came home and realized I left my pills on the first table!  They didn't bother to notice and bring them over when we moved! What terrible inconsideration. For shame.  This place is extremely noisy, rushed, and the staff are so busy I guess. And I guess they have to work when sick too...one waiter sneezed a huge one right when he was placing a plate in front of a customer and he had both hands occupied. Ew. Go to Grand Luxe instead. Same owners, but way better in terms of decor, service and experience."
Miss V.,"Dallas, TX",5,99,20,4.0,6/22/2012,"I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory because their salads are huge, and I like their brown soda bread. A few tips: --Did not like the Vietnamese Tacos appetizer --their beet and goat cheese salad appetizer is good for someone with a small appetite and priced nicely at around $5. --I didn't realize this until a waiter gave me the stink eye but waiters split their tips with support staff, so I think they only get to keep like 60% of it. Normally I tip really well, but this one particular time I only tipped like 13% despite good service because I was confused about TX tax rate versus CA tax rate which is closer to 10%. Anyway, it made me feel kind of bad because he got a $7 tip for a really easy table that was gone in 40 minutes. That kind of left a bad taste in my mouth."
Katie H.,"McKinney, TX",0,83,5,5.0,9/2/2015,"Love Cheesecake Factory! This location always has delicious food, great service, and awesome cheesecake!! They are very busy on weekend evenings, of course, so if you have a large group, be prepared to wait. The wait isn't usually quite as long as they quote, though, and they will text you when your table is ready. Their patio is also great, and has heaters for the cooler months. Takeout service is really convenient and quick as well!"
