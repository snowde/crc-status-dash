Tiffany S.,"Frisco, TX",370,18,95,5.0,9/17/2013,The crispy crab wontons are the bomb! The buffalo blast are amazing! Cheesecake Factory has one of the most elaborate menus I have ever seen. From Pasta and Pizza to yummy chicken and seafood entrees. If you are entertaining a diverse group of people this works well. The guest can order anything from A-Z on the menu. Good service. Good food. Beware of humungous portions. One adult entrée can easily feed two people. Be prepared to walk out with doggie bags to take home.
Nicole A.,"Dallas, TX",229,147,4,4.0,6/5/2012,"My mom and little sister were in town and we made a trip to Ikea, shopping/walking through Ikea can make you hungry so we decided to to treat ourselves to some lunch at the nearby Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge!  Lots of delicious food to choose from.  All of our meals were great.  Our server seemed new but she did a great job at taking care of us. The only thing that we did not really like was that when they box up your food to go, they take it out of your sight... could that be done at the table? We all split a red velvet cheesecake afterwards and oh my goodness... soo good! Everyone should experience the grandness of the Cheesecake factory at least once."
Jan C.,"Addison, TX",0,18,,1.0,10/30/2014,"Yesterday I met a friend for an early lunch.  With an almost empty restaurant, we were walked to the very back through the bar to an area under construction!  During 30 minutes of our meal someone hovered over our heads on a ladder while working on an awning.  When we left we had to make our way through an obstacle course of unoccupied wheelchairs and walkers that could have easily been stored out of the aisle.  Ridiculous!  The complete lack of respect for customers will keep me from ever going back."
Arezu M.,"The Colony, TX",1,12,4,5.0,8/13/2015,"God I lobe this place!!!! Always amazing service & food, the staff is very friendly & professional & nice, can't say enough nice things about this place!"
Jenifer V.,"McKinney, TX",195,355,39,4.0,11/18/2011,Pasta Da Vinci.  Yum.  That's all I have to say.   P.S.  My waiter was Christian and he was super fab.
Pam D.,"Frisco, TX",3,62,4,4.0,6/24/2013,"I enjoy coming here for a nice environment, knowing that I will have great service, and lots to choose from-- although I have noticed I order the same 5 dishes over and over again, but the opportunity is there to shake it up a bit.  The thai lettuce wraps are my favorite when I want to go healthy. I can usually get 2-3 meals out of this. I prefer Cheesecake Factory (CF) over PF Chang. CF's wraps are made with whole pieces of chicken...you know you are getting real whole chicken. PF Chang's is made from ground chicken-- which means you don't know what else is in it. My friend confirmed it when he told me that when he worked at PF Chang's they would put whole chunks of fat and left over chicken parts in the meat grinder to make the dish.  I also like the white bean chicken chili. It is spicy and filling. Perfect for the fall and winter. Unfortunately, this isn't as big of a serving as their other dishes. I will usually eat this in one sitting with just a tiny bit left over... too tiny to ask for a to-go container. I am not a big cheesecake eater, but the dulce de leche cheesecake is awesome and doesn't taste like cheesecake. It tastes like silky caramel. I also like the Chris' Outragous Chocolate Cake but it is so rich that I can't have more than a few bites. For babies, they will bring out a free baby plate with slices of their bread and slices of bananas. Sometimes they will bring it out on their own, sometimes you have to ask for it. This is awesome because me a chance to get settled in and look over the menu. If I could change one thing, it's the sticky and many times slick floors. It seems like there is always a layer of grease, sauce, or something on the floor and I have to be careful when I walk to make sure I don't slip. Try doing that while holding a baby, holding another kid's hand, having a diaper bag slung over your shoulder with a purse on top of it."
Brandi G.,"Longview, TX",33,28,23,4.0,3/2/2012,This is by far my favorite place to eat in Frisco. The fried zucchini is the best. Period. We are big fans of the Fettuccine Alfredo and the Fish and Chips. In fact- I haven't had anything here that was bad. It's all good. Nothing disappoints! The only reason I took a star away is the seating here is horrendous. There is just my husband and I and they constantly try and sit us in the middle seats where you are stuck listening to everyone else conversation. They don't ask if you prefer table or booth. They just assume you are okay with sitting there.
Sami J.,"Denton, TX",16,54,19,1.0,5/31/2014,"The two stars is only for tha chicken samosa. The service was very very bad. I've been to several branches however, this branch was the worst. You may be luckier than me.. Give it a try. I FOUND A SHARP PEACE OF PLASTIC IN MY FRIED MACARONI CHEESE!!!!!!!!"
Kim D.,"Frisco, TX",75,76,9,3.0,9/6/2011,"We had dinner here with our friends and both our 2 year old sons. We have always enjoyed dining at Cheesecake Factory because the food and atmosphere has always been consistent. However, the past experience has changed my mind. Not only was the service slow, but we didn't get bread. When I asked for bread, the waiter informed me that ""we only give out bread when our customers ask for it.' Ok, has it not always been the norm for them to bring out bread at Cheesecake Factory? Sometimes, I only look forward to going here because of the bread! Is the economy that bad now that they're taking that away? Again, this isn't cheap dining either.  The food took foreeeever to come out and this is made so much worse when you've got 2 impatient toddlers! By the time the food came out, we had to scarf it down. However, one dish that I always order that I absolutely love here is the Cajun Jambalaya. Everything else is always a hit or miss, IMO."
Jessica N.,"Prosper, TX",0,10,1,3.0,5/21/2014,The size of the food is huge. And the price is okay. But it think the service was bad. Our server took forever to get back to us.
Joyce K.,"Plano, TX",146,296,35,4.0,2/22/2011,"The cheesecake factory is kind of like home base - I can come here and know for a fact that I'm going to get great service, quality food and there will always be leftovers to eat tomorrow. You really can't go wrong here."
David G.,"Dallas, TX",0,28,,3.0,3/24/2014,"The menu is huge. I had fish tacos. They were ok...I've had better. I think the food is a product of trying to do too much, rather than do a few things extremely well. I think the entree prices are a little high for what you get. The place is very noisy. Wait staff a little slower than I would have liked. The cheesecake selection is awesome and I immensely enjoyed what we got."
Thomas W.,"Plano, TX",10,442,,4.0,1/6/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those places you go to when you want to fool yourself into thinking you're living the high life for a second, without going broke doing it. That is to say, it has a thin veneer of upscale elements, but the affordability of restaurants like Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Kind of like a Cadillac Cimarron. The restaurant is very nice. Polished stone floors, moody lighting and displays with cheesecakes, obviously.  How's the food you ask? Unfortunately, this is where the restaurant shares more in common with other casual dining options like Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Just like those chains, the food here does not really rely upon finesse to taste good, but rather the crude standbys of more salt, more sugar, and more oil. With this technique you can probably make a fried turd taste good. (Note the popularity of Chinese food in America? It is not only very salt and oily, but also sweet.) Good food also involves the texture, the temperature and the spices. Can't forget the spices. So their food is basically pretty mediocre and only a few notches better than most casual dining chains. The cheesecake is pretty good though. Not too sweet and somewhat fluffy. Service is inattentive. I ran out of water, and had to try a few times to flag someone down."
Kimberly W.,"Dallas, TX",161,350,33,4.0,6/12/2011,"Love my Frisco Cheesecake Factory. I always get good service. However, when I want a booth they always seem to sit me by the kitchen. It is so noisy at times that it can be distracting from the meal. But the food is always delicious. The prices have escalated but I usually try to come before 4pm so I can get the lunch entrees. The variety of cheesecakes and other desserts cannot not be compared. I love the pineapple upside down cheesecake."
Stacie W.,"Little Elm, TX",3,7,1,5.0,3/8/2014,"Our family goes here often as it's a kid favorite with a varied menu for us parents.  Plus the cheesecake is amazing.  Last night we went there for our daughters birthday, and there was a snag that was handled promptly and very well.  When my husband got the bill back to sign off on, his debit card was missing.  It had fallen out somewhere along the route back to the table.  Our server looked for it, then went to find the manager, who looked and asked around as well.  He offered to take our info and assured us the card would be put in a safe if/when found, and comped our meal.  My husband was pretty annoyed at all this obviously because shutting down a card is a hassle, and on the weekend the new one would take forever to get to us as it's from an out of state institution.  Reality is though that things happen and on a busy weekend evening in a darkened restaurant there's only so much that can be done. On the way out I asked at the hostess station if a card had been turned in and as luck would have it a bus boy had found it just a moment sooner.  The manager reduced the bill for the inconvenience which was more than fair, and all was well.  The food and service has always been very good, last night was unusual but they handled it very well."
Michael G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",244,338,12,5.0,8/21/2011,Yummy!  I only can comment on the always good cheesecake for this establishment.  My snickers cheesecake was fabulous at ate the 8 dollar piece in a 2 day session.  :)  Definitely needs to be on your to do list if you've never had a piece.
Darlene L.,"Carrollton, TX",42,286,112,4.0,1/3/2014,Had the Tortilla Soup and was very tasty!  Our server was attentive and funny. We were not in  a hurry and were not rushed to turn the table.  I like that.
Mackenzie K.,"McKinney, TX",381,66,100,3.0,9/29/2013,Ordered pick up cheesecakes ($220+) waited 20min because the cakes weren't ready. We ordered them 3 days in advance? But good cheesecake (Adam's Peanut Butter)
Kevin O.,"Bolton, CT",2,20,3,1.0,3/24/2013,"Server delivered my girlfriends food cold, five minutes later I got my steak which was nothing but fat. Horrible service."
Melissa M.,"Frisco, TX",81,234,26,5.0,8/18/2013,This review is based off the cheesecake. I went to a late movie at the mall and thought a piece of cheesecake would hit the spot. There were 3 of us and the waiter recommended the s'mores cheesecake. This was so decadent and perfect. The toasted marshmallow covering the delicious chocolate cheesecake and graham cracker= pure heaven.  I highly recommend them on their cheesecake
