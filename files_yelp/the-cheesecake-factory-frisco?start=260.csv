Dheeraj B.,"Frisco, TX",2,1,,1.0,1/26/2014,We waited for 45 mins after placing the order with a very rude waitress! We ended up looking at people who came in much later get their food and nobody bothered to check if we were ok. We spoke to the manager who obviously was not capable of helping us. We walked out after a 45min wait. Would never go to this one.
Liz G.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",8,36,4,4.0,11/24/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is my go to restaurant. I don't think I've ever been disappointed here or unhappy with my meal. The customer service is always great, sometimes there is a long wait and the waiters take a bit to get to your table that's why I didn't give 5 stars. Menu selection is great, all different kinds of food - healthy and unhealthy :)"
Chad F.,"Garland, TX",61,100,42,4.0,5/28/2013,"Pricey but good food.  Love, love, LOVE the Oreo Cheesecake."
Scott T.,"Aubrey, TX",4,29,3,2.0,7/19/2013,Service was slow for a Wednesday early evening.  One of the two meals was under cooked and had to be sent back.  Waitress was supper friendly and acknowledged our food allergy requests.
Jessica S.,"Houston, TX",14,37,,3.0,11/23/2012,We went on a saturday night and sat by the bar area. Service was bad and he didnt even clean the table off after he said he would return to do it. He even left the waters from the previous couple.  The young girl at the bar was kind enough to check on us even tho this wasnt her area.
lisa s.,"Rowlett, TX",21,87,26,5.0,6/7/2012,"So love Cheesecake Factory!  My favorite is the Southwest Eggrolls and the Thai Lettuce Wraps followed up with a piece of Red Velvet Cheesecake and a cup of their awesome coffee. Always great service, friendly staff and clean surroundings.  I think the Northpark and Allen locations are the very best though!"
Stacy w.,"Dallas, TX",20,55,,4.0,5/11/2010,"I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a very long time and after my visit in mid-April, I was asking myself why did I leave for so long? We enjoyed some dishes off of their ""small plates"" menu - the edaname and onion rings (both fabulous). I'm so glad The Cheesecake Factory and it's sister restaurant The Grand Luxe have added this to the menu. It makes these places a top spot for me to go for happy hour or late-night. But for lunch, I got the pizza and salad combo and it was so delicious that I ate it all. I can't speak to the cheesecaks, as I am not a fan, but the food is wonderful. I've dined at the Cheesecake Factory for more than 12 years (yes, since I was a kid). I'm surprised to see that their service and food has not gone downhill, as so many older restaurants tend to do over the years."
Jennifer B.,"Frisco, TX",73,224,1,2.0,2/23/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this location is not very good. I actually think the problem seems to lie with the managers. The staff (hosts/servers) seem unhappy and their work reflects this. I used to order the Lousiana Chicken Pasta, but it was never prepared consistently so I stopped ordering it. I moved onto the Crispy Chicken Costelleta...meh...chicken was always too well done. Now I am to the point where I will only go on a Sunday, and the only safe dish is the potato soup. Cheesecake (any flavor) is safe, but it is pre-prepared, so impossible for even this location to mess up."
Adriana M.,"Richardson, TX",42,51,5,4.0,2/9/2013,Great place to get just about anything you want. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is the fluffiest one on the menu. Definitely their menu items are sharable.
Jennifer H.,"Chicago, IL",3,125,126,2.0,10/10/2012,"You will almost always have to wait, though there's often a free seat at the bar. The bar and high top tables are self-seating. The selection of food is VAST and the quality is alright. I think the servers do the best they can, but I always seem to be there when my server is overwhelmed."
MICHAEL M.,"Richardson, TX",16,55,15,4.0,11/1/2012,"all cheesecake factory's are all the same when it comes down to it.   however that is not a bad thing, the food is great plus the cheese cake is OUTSTANDING!!!"
Saurabh S.,"Modesto, CA",22,68,2,4.0,8/30/2012,As good as any other cheesecake factory. This one had no wait. The food was good and heavy. The floors are slippery just like all the other cheesecake factories.
Scott F.,"Keller, TX",16,105,,4.0,10/12/2012,Huge Portions so prepare to take food home. Be sure to get there early on the weekends as there tends to be a wait. Good service for the most part too.
Geri H.,"Frisco, TX",2,50,2,1.0,7/14/2014,"Expensive and poor service from most servers. Have been often but will only now go for the cheesecake which we take out. Not worth the trouble or having to deal with  ""an experience"" (and not a good one ) when there are tons of better places to eat in Frisco. Find yourself another restaurant especially if there are 4 or more of you!!"
Rob M.,"Frisco, TX",69,225,2,4.0,6/25/2012,"We had a nice time all around, atmosphere, our waitress, and the food were all great.  They do try to pay attention to the details here.  Considering this location is at a mall I was expecting less, but I left impressed."
Chris F.,"Addison, TX",1,25,,3.0,3/4/2013,"Maybe not the best place to have lunch... how can you possibly consider everything in the Encyclopedia Brittanica of a menu they have, narrow down options, order, eat and leave within an hour? Not happening. I had to get it to go. But it was a good kobe burger..."
Mike G.,"Frisco, TX",2,104,11,5.0,9/28/2012,"Other than the fact that you're likely to wait, you really can't go wrong with this place. If you can't find something in their phonebook-sized menu that appeals to you, you probably shouldn't eat out. And of course, save room for their cheesecakes and other desserts. Afterall, that's why you're going there in the first place, right?"
Esteban B.,"Plano, TX",0,11,1,3.0,8/3/2014,the chicken bellagio is a great plate and the desert are good the service is OK. I will come back.
Tim L.,"Lewisville, TX",830,439,830,4.0,4/26/2011,"I usually come only for dessert and they have a wide variety of choices.  You can't miss with any of them!  The food is alright, not great, but they do give you a lot.  Like other people have mentioned you're most likely going to ask for a to go box.  There is outdoor seating available, but it's nothing special unless you want to look at a bunch of cars driving around the parking lot.  Service at this location is very good."
Veronica Marie P.,"McKinney, TX",80,27,91,4.0,4/7/2009,"4 stars because they have a few dish that are my absolute favorite.  1. Thai Lettuce Wraps 2. Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic 3. Garlic Noodles with or without chicken or shrimp 4. Miso Salmon Their portions are always big so it's ideal to share and be able to try different things. Even their salads are huge! Also, it's hard to leave room for a big slice of their many cheesecake.  We dine here every so often, usually before or after we catch a movie. They're open until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, 10pm on Sundays, and 11pm Mondays through Thursday.  The menu is ginormous so you have plenty to choose from and the late hours are convenient!"
