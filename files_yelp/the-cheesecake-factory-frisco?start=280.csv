Chassity F.,"Howe, TX",16,48,9,1.0,5/21/2011,"I have been here twice. The first was with my 6 month old and 3 year old for dessert and it was ok. I was thrilled they give you a free ""baby plate"" with bread and cut up banana.  They 2nd trip was horrible! I go with my husband and the two daughters mentioned above. I didn't mind the 10 minute wait because it was a Saturday and it is in a mall. I had to talk hubby into eating here as we always eat at Dave and Busters next door. We sit down and all the silverware was wet. My husband dried them off with one of their cloth napkins and we were disgusted! There was black on the napkin and a decent amount. We all got burgers to avoid eating with the silverware. We were not offered bread or a ""baby plate"" until I asked. This was different from our first visit and it seemed other tables got it without asking. When the food arrived I was upset because my daughter's plate was hot to the touch. The server had to use a towel to carry it. Who in their right mine gives a 3 year old ordering off the kids menu a HOT plate?!?!? Then I notice my bacon is burnt. Not crispy but black and burnt. I cut into my medium well burger to find it more medium rare. My husbands medium burger was more cooked than mine. I blew this off as my daughter was fussy and I didn't want to wait on a new burger. I asked for 2 more little cups of BBQ sauce and when they arrived I noticed something streaky in them. I looked closer and there were CHUNKS of something in them. YUCK! The food that was right was ok but not any better than a fast food burger. The cheesecake (that we were given to make up for everything--yeah right) was blah. It was too rich and just not that good. I had high hopes for this place and we will not go back. Plus I would rather have cheaper prices and normal portions then pay to much for extra food that didn't reheat well at home. UPDATE: I contacted cooperate via their website the day of this visit. It has now been 5 business days and NO response. I guess bad customer service is the theme for the entire company."
David W.,"Carrollton, TX",112,237,5,4.0,1/19/2010,"Mrs. Bear and I are not fans of cheesecake  -  I can't even eat it because of lactose intolerance.  So we don't go here for the cheesecake. Yes, the place is huge and the crowds are like those at Disney World.  The portions of food and drink are also huge, so we always split an entree, and seldom have room for dessert.  Every single dish we have tried on the magazine-like menu has been delicious, from steak to chicken to pasta.  Even the enormous salads are a treat, with garden-fresh veg.  Yes, we split those as well. What we like best about the Factory is the BAR.   Since Mrs. Bear and I hate the hour-plus wait for a table, we usually hover about the bar until a couple of seats become available, and then we pounce on them.  The bar service is excellent, and we like to watch the football games on the TV.  The drinks?  In a word - SUPERB.  Best Mai Tai in all of DFW can be found here.  The beer taps are covered with ice, so you know your brew is gonna be cold as a polar bear's nose. So, besides the long waits for a table, the only other thing I don't like about this Cheesecake Factory location is that the parking lot is shared by a large movie theater, so it's almost impossible to find a place to park, especially on a  Saturday night.  No valet service anywhere in sight.  Typically we park at JC Penney and walk over to the restaurant from there.  Usually we don't mind the walk, as it's a good way to shed calories from dinner."

Bryce F.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",23,250,11,4.0,4/17/2012,"The service at this location was a tad below par for this chain, but the food quality met my high expectations."
Jennifer R.,"Carrollton, TX",221,341,107,1.0,1/16/2009,"Wow, this place is huge!  Wow, this place is crowded!  Wow, this menu is big!  Wow, my food is humongous!  Yep, hoards of people crowd into the CF barns to drown themselves in mountains of food full of mediocrity. I say let them flock away! It keeps them out of the places I like to go!"
Jennifer G.,"Dallas, TX",344,608,123,4.0,6/8/2009,"It's the cheesecake factory. You know what you are going to get. Good food, a huge portion, an awesome piece of cheesecake and if you are in the mood for one - a really delicious cocktail. I think their Georgia peach is my favorite beverage for the summer of 09 so far. Frozen peachy, fruity deliciousness. I've wanted one pretty much since I finished the one I had last Saturday. Sometimes I like predictability.... and always I like Cheesecake :)  Warning: Parking here can kind of suck."
Katherine B.,"Dallas, TX",30,56,3,4.0,10/31/2008,"I've never had issues with their hygiene before, so I'm at a loss for the previous review. For food, the Sheperd's Pie and the calamari are pretty darn tasty. As is anything of theirs that is pasta. Really all the food is wonderfully done, they have a huge selection and the waiters are always attentive.  The only problem with Cheesecake factory is that I'm a light eater, and I don't want huge portions. I mean, I'm glad I'm getting my money's worth but I wish there were ""small portion"" sections of the menu. Who can eat all that food? So Cheesecake Factory isn't a place I think of going often. So a good restaurant for ""every once in a while"" occasion."
I W.,"Dallas, TX",0,338,590,4.0,1/28/2013,"I stopped in for Sunday lunch with a friend. The restaurant was busy and there was a wait but it wasn't too bad. Our waiter was prompt and attentive, the food was good and our tab was reasonable. No complaints."
Judy R.,"McKinney, TX",0,21,,2.0,3/24/2014,"This was the first time I had been at the Frisco site.  There were two of us and we ordered lettuce wrap and an omelet. The lettuce wrap was a small plate and it was good.  The woman with me could not eat the omelet she ordered  After paying that much she only ate the sliced tomatoes, which were very good.  We ordered a lemoncello tart and a tuxedo cheesecake.  The lemoncello tasted like those cheap Zingers. I tasted the omelet because the small plate was indeed too small for me.  It had a definite burned taste to it.  I don't think someone cleaned the pan properly because her omelet was not burned.  In fact it was pretty as a picture.  The waiter was very nice and offered to take the tart off the bill.  We should have demanded the omelet off too.  We were hungry and we weren't being that particular. I will go back to the one on central expressway, but won't try this one again."
Chris G.,"Dallas, TX",99,202,8,2.0,9/28/2008,"My mom and I went here this past summer. Her treat. Usually when I'm not paying for a meal, it automatically gains a star because I don't have to worry about price. Not this time. I felt bad my mom forked out that kind of money. The food was eh. The service was eh. The cheesecake? Pretty good, but nothing to make me backflip off a building for. If my momma's spending 50-70 fucking dollars I better be backflipping!"
Matthew N.,"Memphis, TN",82,54,11,4.0,7/6/2011,They do good things to chicken at The Cheescake Factory. My only regret from our experience here was that we each ordered meals. In the future I will try to get one lower carb meal. The pasta just about killed me.
G P.,"Plano, TX",0,42,4,3.0,11/12/2011,"Soooo expensive, food is great though. The single slice of cheesecake costs like $4 when you can buy the same whole box at Sams for just $10. But its business. Last time we (2 adults 2 kids) ate there it cost us $120 incl tip for the same food which could've cost is only for $80 over at TGIF or Applebees. So over rated."
Kat M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",501,299,754,4.0,11/14/2010,"I used to love the cheesecake factory and I still sort of do. However every time I go, the food never seems to get any better. Just mediocre with 47389242 options to choose from. The service is always satisfactory and sometimes it feels like the servers are just trying to get you in and out, like they are the ones in a rush? However I never turn it away if someone wants to go there. I will say I am always happy with the salads I get here, even the lunch portions are enormous."
George C.,"Plano, TX",4,19,9,5.0,8/6/2011,My mom visited and she ain't her's all in one setting.  My cheesecake was fluffy and heavenly.  Its addictive!
L T.,"Frisco, TX",0,6,3,1.0,11/3/2011,"Since today is my friend's birthday, I decided that it would be nice to take her to lunch.  She decided on the Cheesecake Factory because she loves the key lime cheesecake and I just love going there....or should I now say USED TO LOVE.   There were hardly any patrons we arrived and were promptly greeted and seated.  That's were the good birthday experience ended.  When our food came out, our waiter basically dropped off our food and left.  He didn't offer any cracked black pepper or Parmesan cheese for my friend's salad and pizza or ask if my burger was cooked appropriately. He didn't come back to check on us until we were both done with the meal.  It would have been nice for him to check in once and ask how everything was since my hamburger was very undercooked.  It was raw in the middle and my bottom bun was blood soaked.  I ate around the edges as best as I could but couldn't get through the whole thing. I also didn't want to complain and make a big scene and ruin my friend's birthday, so I just let it be.  However when the waiter went to clear our plates, he finally noticed my raw burger because it was practically mooing.  He went to show the manager my food and chastised the cook.  Those actions almost redeemed him in my eyes.  I thought he'd at least take the burger off the ticket but didn't. That's okay. I ate almost half so I'll pay for it.  What really gets me and the reason I'm giving them one star is because he said the manager would be coming by to talk to me.  ""Okay great,"" I thought.  He'll apologize and I'll definitely feel much better. The manager did come to our table....only to ask me IF I NEEDED MORE WATER.  No thank you.  I drank all the water I needed to get that raw hamburger down.  MORE WATER!!! REALLY?!? Thanks Mr. Manager. I feel really special now.  Next time I have a craving for cheesecake, I'll think twice because the service and managers are terrible at this location.  Especially the ones that worked today, Thursday, between 11am-12noon."
Victoria L.,"Frisco, TX",0,8,,2.0,9/8/2011,"We went there on the labor day weekend with friends and were upset about the food and service. My husband had hibachi steak and it was cold when served. Our 3 months old daughter was on the carseat carrier and the server said he would bring a sling for us to put the carrier and he never did. One of the friends had the hot tea, but the tea pot was very terrible. My friend opened the lid trying to see how much water left and she saw some white stuff floating inside. Of course, she told the server and the server just gave her another pot of hot water without saying anything. Too pricy compared to the serive and quality of food."
Phoebe H.,"Frisco, TX",58,75,,2.0,1/11/2011,I am really disappointed! What happened to their quality control?! I have given this place a couple of 'tries' and I walk away sorely underwhelmed by the food and the service! I am afraid that last week was probably the last voluntary trip I make to the Cheesecake factory in Frisco.  They are resting on their laurels.
Adrian B.,"Lenexa, KS",1,57,129,5.0,7/8/2014,"every cheesecake factory is at its very high level of service and food quality, the lights are a exactly between bright and low, they serve very large plates and the desserts are exquisite. they serve the best Arnold Palmer in a lot of restaurants, and its a place to return soon."
Christina F.,"Richardson, TX",44,6,,4.0,2/27/2011,"Love the food, always get dessert! The food besides pasta is good as well. Kinda pricey but I can get two meals out of every visit."
Chris R.,"Carrollton, TX",0,1,,5.0,1/23/2013,The pecan crusted catfish and the potato succotash was the best meal I've had in five years. Thanks
