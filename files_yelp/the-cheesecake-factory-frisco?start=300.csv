Haley B.,"Austin, TX",90,138,24,4.0,11/9/2009,"This place is just excellent. The service was so wonderful and everything was very delicious. They have a mint green tea that is made fresh and free refills! We like to save money, so we usually share an entree when we go out to eat. This time we got a chicken noodly thing with pesto in it. Because we told her that we would be sharing, she brought out an extra bowl of sauce for us to use as well. The portion size was huge, my husband and I left full and there were still leftovers on the table. All for around $20, what a great deal!"
RobLondon_Sports L.,"Washington, DC",137,31,53,3.0,2/17/2010,"Just what I expected when I go to a ""Cheesecake"" throughout the country.  Nothin more or less!  My waiter was attentive though!"
Kristen F.,"Austin, TX",132,693,96,3.0,8/6/2007,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory.  Grossly over-portioned food, which is okay with me because I take half home and eat it for lunch the next day.  It's not very expensive, but they totally charge too much for what it is.  $3 for a soda?  It costs you pennies.  That annoys me. Anyway, the food is decent.  They definitely have many good options for vegetarians, which is nice.  I personally haven't met a cheesecake I didn't like, so I get so excited about their extensive variety of flavors, but I'm usually too full for any once the time comes.  I should eat dessert first. This Cheesecake Factory is within Stonebriar Mall.  I went yesterday, on a Sunday afternoon, and waited 10 minutes for a table, which was okay with me.  Afterwards, it was kind of weird to walk around shopping with my to-go food, but they gave us a bag so it could have been worse.  I kept smelling grilled cheese as I shopped, but there are worse fates than that."
Vanessa M.,"Waco, TX",9,122,1,5.0,1/22/2009,I think that it is awesome!  The portions are huge and there is too much to choose from.  Pricing is great for the amount of food that you get. The variety of cheesecake is wonderful too.  I love the pumpkin cheesecake when that is in season.
Rex B.,"Lewisville, TX",11,30,4,4.0,11/4/2009,I have eaten at several Cheesecake Factories throughout TX. Great menu variety. Dishes are always freshly prepared and delicious. Great job.
Celi R.,"Denton, TX",0,13,,4.0,8/21/2009,"This place really is great. You get great food, for what I think are really reasonable prices (for the main dishes) and HUGE portions. The atmosphere is great. I guess for me it has ended up depending on the server. You can leaving feeling like you had a great time and a great meal or frustrated and annoyed. But I usually always end up pleased."
zambak z.,"Plano, TX",0,27,,3.0,11/29/2007,"WARNING! If you go here on Friday or Saturday evening, expect delays due to whatever reason they provide you. We waited for a table of 2 for 1 hour as they claimed, and then waited for another 15 minutes to be seated. If you want to enjoy the food, and it is really delicious (not all but the ones I will recommend), go in a weekday evening.  I usually go there with my gf because the portions are huge and we share a single plate with appetiser. First lets start with what is good about this place, the bad will come at the end. The food portions are huge, can be shared by two people and that makes it a great value to eat outside. Recommendations for great food: Start with Chicken Pot Stickers: They are great, great great. The sauce is so well prepared, it has the sour taste that mellows with a touch of sweet.  Or you can try the Thai Lettuce Wraps or the Buffolo Wings. For the main meal: If you want to be green and in the mood to be healthy get one of the salads. I have not seen so much greens at one plate in my life before here as a single person portion. Cobb Salad (without bacon), Chinese Chicken Salad, and Santa Fe salads are excellent. They taste great, and this company knows how to prepare dressings. If you have a stomach the size of an oil tanker you can manage the plates without a problem. IMO the salad plates will be sufficient enough to feed a family of four anywhere else in the word other than the USA. The cooked meals: MY ALL TIME FAVORITE IN THIS RESTAURANT! Beef Ribs If you like meat, you should make it a goal to get the ribs in this restaurant. They prepare it so well that they meat literally falls off the bone and literally melts in your mouth. It is that good. And the sauce they use to simmer the meat. Words can not describe it at all. Again the portion is huge, sufficient for two people at least! Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Orange Chicken, Lemon Roasted Chicken, Shrimp Scampi and Fish and Chips are really good as well, and highly recommended. When eating there do not indulge yourself in useless alcohol, instead opt for the excellent tasting Smoothies. Pick out of three and you will not make a mistake in any. My favorite of all is the Strawberry smoothie, but I love them all. As for desserts, there is an item that is not on the list, it is called something like upside down pineapple cheesecake. Try it, you will not be sad. NOW THE BAD PART! Don't think of going there on the weekends, unless you want to wait long hours and sit close to many people, hear many noises that you will think your friend/partner/friends are talking to you while it is actually the people sitting next to you talking to each other. There is no privacy. And did I mention it is excessively loud? They don't take reservations. Don't try. The restaurant is not really clean. The tables are usually not cleaned well. The silverware can be dirty most of the times, and will require a few requests to the waiter. Once I had a green particule stuck on my fork, the other time a red piece of food on the knife. Should have requested lab reports. Not acceptable! The menu can also be very dirty. Make sure to open the pages with a napkin. Usually it is sticky, and you may end up coming face to face with a small piece of lettuce on one page and some sticky residue of food in another page. For food gets 4 stars For environment and hygine gets 1 star Can not average it to 2.5 stars so I give 3 for now."
Tracey W.,"Richardson, TX",115,131,,4.0,7/1/2008,"Thankfully, I didn't go on a Friday or Saturday evening...I went on a Sunday.  After going without my DS, I had to promise to take him.  So I took off with my DS and his best friend.  I forewarned them that the size of portions there!  My DS has a special affinity for cheesecake, but I must admit, he was slightly overwhelmed by all the choices!  He actually surprised me by ordering a salad.  I was bad...and NOT at all OP and ordered a cheeseburger.  I managed a half of it and brought the other half home.  Our waitress was VERY helpful in finally making a decision about which cheesecake to order!  My DS ordered the DULCE DE LECHE CARAMEL CHEESECAKE ...he was SO excited!  It was fun to see him so excited!  He even talked about getting a job there! :)"
M. V.,"Sachse, TX",15,52,2,4.0,7/6/2011,"Good location and service, but this isn't somewhere you want to go for a quick lunch.  The whole ordering, eating and paying process takes a little longer than other places.  I have yet to try something on the menu that I consider a  ""To die for"" item.  However, the cheesecake is very good."
