Katina D.,"Dallas, TX",308,207,928,4.0,11/20/2015,"It's almost been 8 years since I've been here and nothing has changed at all. The only thing that changed is that they offer a ""healthy menu"" which includes many low calorie options for those who are choosing a healthier lifestyle. The healthy menu included drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert with the amount of calories next it.  The customer service is great as well.  I ordered the ""Skinnylicious chicken pasta"" which was surprisingly good for it being only being 540 calories. I was very satisfied with the good decision that I decided to make which later took a toll. I ordered the Smores' Cheesecake and the Oreo Cheesecake (I was sharing so don't worry lol). The Oreo cheesecake was absolutely amazing and I STRONGLY recommend everyone to try it if you're indecisive. You wont regret it! The Oreo Cheesecake contained a great combination of texture (from the actual cookie) and the cheesecake itself. It was the best 5 minutes of my life! The smore's cheesecake was too rich for me and I honestly couldn't differentiate between the melted marshmallow and white cream. I enjoyed it as well but my go-to would be the Oreo choice.  Overall: Honestly, I'm not a big fan of a big chained restaurant but I became a fan of The Cheesecake Factory after consuming the Oreo Cheesecake.  You will FOR SURE see me back here! YUM-O!!!!"
Robert B.,"Keller, TX",430,332,960,4.0,1/13/2016,"We decided we need a taste of desert before hitting the road. Nice restaurant in a nice mall. Busy place, very busy. Took 40 minutes to get a table, but I won't begrudge them for being popular. The service was top notch. I have to say the waitress was a lot of fun and spot on with service. The atmosphere is really cool. If you've not been to a Cheesecake factory before, the ambience is really different in a good way. Lots to see for ADHD people. My wife and our friend were super impressed with their deserts. Mine was ok. I will confess that the reason this place doesn't get a 5 star rating is that I simply don't care for cheesecake. So, I ordered a non-cheesecake desert. It was ok. Presentation is great, but the flavor was ok. Lemon pie type deal. Tasted too much like a fluffed up piece of cheesecake to me. If you're a cheesecake lover, this is your place."
Mary S.,"Amherst, OH",2863,716,10378,2.0,6/3/2017,"It's Friday night, your busy, our food is taking way to long....I get it, I forgive you.  But you bring the appetizers out & the food follows right behind...you are now on my sh!t list.   You would think the Manager would know how our dining experience was effected but he did not even do table checks...I know how you value your customer service.  This location definitely needs a swift kick in the A$$ to get back on board with investor relations & corporate overview. (Yeah I said it) don't hate on my yelp status! I've dined at a number of your locations from Vegas to Ohio whatever my travel status is not stated for bragging right I'm just saying that I simply adore the consistency of your kitchen & service so I def recognize your lack luster here in that dept.  I expressed my feelings to our food runner who dropped the plates...""uhm excuse me why are we getting appetizers with our meal"" she walked away must of not heard me (sarcasm) so then I expressed to our server...our tables cramped these are apps not sides what's the deal..no manager was addressed so now I have to sh!t up my yelp reviews of a situation that could of been handled in house!  So my point is I would skip this location I paid $170 (tip included) to have a mediocre at best dining experience...I'm taking 1600 calories on my hips for a slice of cheesecake after a big dinner at least let me go home happy"
Barbara W.,"Carrollton, TX",16,62,12,2.0,7/24/2017,"Went here with a large group for a late lunch.  They were very busy, as it was a weekend.  The servers were very nice but not efficient.  We waited for nearly an hour for our food from the time we placed our order.  They brought the salad at the same time as the entree, and when we questioned it, the server said you need to make sure you tell the server you don't want the salad with the meal.  Seriously?  I realize this is a casual mall restaurant, but I didn't think basic restaurant ""rules"" regarding the order of courses were suspended if it is a restaurant with table service.  We ordered a variety of foods from pizza to fish to steak.  All of them were fine, but nothing fantastic.  If it were just about the food, my review would be a 3.  I think their menu is way too large.  It is overwhelming for the customer and it's got to be maddening for the kitchen.  Our youngest son who is a little too big for a kids meal but still could benefit from the brevity of a kids menu was just overwhelmed.  We helped him order, but had problems when the food arrived.  We had to send his food back as it was incorrect, which further added to the delay.  My son's comment was ""next time can we just get cheesecake to go and get food somewhere else?""  I agree. Update:  read the response from the restaurant.  While I appreciate them taking the time to respond, the response was puzzling.  The primary issue was the slow, inefficient service that took us 2 hours from the time we sat down to order until we left the restaurant, not my youngest son's reaction to the novel-like menu."
T P.,"Allen, TX",65,185,20,3.0,1/11/2017,"I hadn't been to CF is years and decided to give it a  go today since the sun was shining, perfect for patio dining.  The wait was about 30 min and there seemed to be a nice crowd inside waiting for tables. Once outside, we noticed that the sun had scorched everything on the tables including silverware that was burning everyone that picked them up. The waitress kindly replaced ours. We ordered spinach dip for apps and the crispy chicken sandwich and big burrito for entrees. The sandwich wasn't spectacular but it wasn't gross. My S.O. stated that their burrito was so-so even though it was drowned in sauce.  I remember coming to Cheesecake factory years ago and it being a popular go-to, but I'm not too sure I would visit again based on the quality of food we were served."
Tessica W.,"Frisco, TX",3,6,1,1.0,8/14/2017,"Because the managers failed to give any support to their extremely busy bartender, my daughters and I came in happy to have a nice dinner after shopping and left frustrated with the lack of service. There are way too many options in frisco to not right your wrongs when you have them. We were loyal Cheesecake Factory but we may take our business elsewhere from now on."
Janice J.,"Dallas, TX",528,122,227,4.0,7/25/2016,"The cheesecakes here are amazing. The other food? It's ok. I usually only order cheesecake when I come to the cheesecake factory but since I got a gift card for this place, I decided to come here with a friend and order real food. I have to say I was a little disappointed. We split an order of fried calamari and and order of fish tacos. The serving sizes here are huge. The calamari was pretty good and we gobbled it up, but afterwards, we were both pretty full already. When the server came with the fish tacos, we found out that an order of fish tacos was 4 fish tacos and rice and beans (we ended up taking half of it home). The fish tacos though were not as good as we expected. The fish itself was very bland and the guacamole inside the tacos was very flavorless as well. The fish tacos came with a side of rice and a side of black beans but the rice was extremely sour -- it literally just tasted like lime to me. After mixing in the beans with it, it was a lot better, but I was still a little disappointed I couldn't just eat the rice on its own.  Also, be warned that this place is packed on weekends (so be prepared to wait). I'm leaving 4 stars for this place because their service was really good -- very friendly and accommodating servers despite it being super busy -- and for their cheesecakes."
Tamika L.,"McKinney, TX",29,22,25,4.0,8/17/2017,The service and quality of food here is good.  I've been going here since they first opened and I would definitely recommend it. Definitely go with a big appetite because the food portions are large. They have a fairly extensive selection of menu items. I have never had anything on the menu that was not tasty & good. Expect to pay on average between  $15 -$20 per person.
Anonymous C.,"Frisco, TX",0,46,26,2.0,6/23/2017,"Cheesecake Factory use to be my go to place every weekend to every other weekend. Now I just don't bother to return. After multiple incidents of terrible service, mistakes, misunderstandings, and food issues I just can't waste my time or money. No matter how many chances I continued to give this place I have been let down. I've lived in Frisco for 6 years now and I must say I have always seemed to get the less experienced servers after a while. So don't get me wrong, just ask for their better servers.  Food is good. Cheesecake is good."
Mguel R.,"Frisco, TX",1,6,5,1.0,7/7/2016,"This is the second time I've been in this Restaurant the first one was like a year ago and was very disappointed in the service then now I thought let's give them another chance maybe the service is different now so we went  And yes the service had gotten better yet not what I expected from a ""high level restaurant"" but well, it was better that the last time so, I got my food, and I noticed that the plate where I was eating had a crack right between the plate all the way through I believe that this is completely unacceptable for a chain restaurant it shows completely lack of management and very little care for the costumer I will never go to eat there again"
LG N.,"Prosper, TX",48,178,103,4.0,1/2/2017,"We visited the Cheesecake Factory in Frisco today with friends.  The food and service were great.  This place has something for everyone with so many options, all of which are done nicely.  Additionally, their cheesecake is amazing.  Definitely recommend this place!  Great for two people or large groups!!"

Glynis P.,"Baker, LA",58,7,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Don't go on a major holiday or Mother's Day. I had very slow service and our food was cold. I typically like the Cheesecake Factory, but after my experience of waiting a long time for my food I will not be back for a while."

Kristel M.,"Jackson, NJ",32,145,70,3.0,11/20/2016,"Got here at 1:16pm, was seated immediately.  Got my drink order pretty quickly.  Did not get bread on the table until 1:45. Got my appetizer at 1:50; meal at 1:54. Food was great but the service was slo"
Jana B.,"Allen, TX",19,138,40,4.0,4/1/2017,"Face it: Cheesecake Factory is known for always nailing it 3 ways--ambience, menu selection and duh, their cheesecakes.  This is usually a splurge for me but I took my niece there for her 15th birthday.  Service was excellent, food was hot and tasty, cheesecake divine, so why only 4 stars?  I had the shrimp spring rolls and got 1 shrimp split in half on each roll.  Come on Cheesecake Factory, your profit margins can surely ""spring"" for 2 shrimp per roll?"
Dan B.,"Tempe, AZ",13,1,,1.0,10/27/2016,"I ate at this store on 10/24/2016. The meal was fine, however after I was done. The waitress was ""not able to run my card, because it had a scratch"" I then paid in cash for my meal, only to find out that the cash was not turned in, my card was charged with a tip left on my card. When I called the store to talk to someone about this, I was called a liar and was told that this waitress would not do such a thing by the finance manager of the store. In fact this is a valid charge because someone signed it.  This has been the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant and will have to consider all other options before going to Cheesecake Factory again."
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,4/11/2015,"When it comes to chain restaurants, I have to admit that I actually kind of love the Cheesecake Factory. Hear me out!! Before you unfriend me, I'm all about eating local and supporting the mom and pop joints, but sometimes it's simply a matter of convenience.  Hence the other night when I was in Frisco for work, exhausted, and wanted something close to the hotel so that my coworker and I could grab a bite and promptly get back to our rooms and crash.  The thing they have going for them is consistency. I like to order from their skinny menu and have yet to find a dish off if that I didn't care for. I've enjoyed the white chicken chili, both the Asian and Mexican chicken lettuce tacos, flatbreads, and small appetizers. This visit I was craving a salad so I got the skinny Cobb without the blue cheese crumbles.  It came with perfectly grilled chicken, chopped bacon, corn, avocado, romaine, and a light vinaigrette dressing. They top it with fresh herbs and it hit the spot for me in terms of freshness and taste. I would most definitely order that again.  My coworker got the herbed salmon off the regular menu and asked for broccoli instead of potatoes. Her plate looked great as well. Of course we couldn't leave without dessert, so we each got our own slice of cheesecake too and coffee to end the meal. (Can I get an amen for per diems?!) I always browse the cheesecake menu like I plan to try something new, but end up ordering the dulce de leche. Can't help it, it's my favorite! I ate half before my stomach raised the white flag. That was the most sugar I'd had in a while but worth every bite.  She got the smores cheesecake which I'd never heard of before. It's a chocolate cheesecake that they cover in a torched marshmallow cream and serve with fresh whipped cream and graham crackers. It looked gorgeous and while I didn't try a bite of the actual cheesecake (have to be in the mood for chocolate), I did try the marshmallow cream and it was divine."
Ravikumar V.,"Plano, TX",47,7,18,1.0,2/5/2017,"I thought spicy means spicy . But here spicy means sweet here. When I ask spicy sauce, they gave some ginger garlic smelled sauce. I don't know the name."
Hammad S.,"Frisco, TX",76,48,22,5.0,12/14/2016,"Crushed herb salmon with shrimps scampy are highly recommended! Can tell fish and shrimps were very fresh. If you are a salmon lover , you must try this! Shrimps were pretty good size."
