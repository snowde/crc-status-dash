Austin T.,"Allen, TX",69,134,2,3.0,6/13/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is generally a very good and high quality place. This location is no exception, the food is great. I've been here three times, though, and had consistently slow service. The servers are very friendly, just for some reason it's always taken me over a half hour to get my meal. If this trend reverses, I will definitely increase my rating. Otherwise, a great place!"
Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,950,1677,3.0,1/28/2016,"I'll be honest, Im typically not a Cheesecake factory fan. Their menu is huge and overwhelming and there's always screaming kids. This last time I went wasnt horrible. I was pleasantly surprised to see a ""lighter"" menu. They have their massive 15 page menu but also a separate one that has 600 and below calorie items. Be careful though because even though some of the items are low in calorie, they are still high in sodium and fat. I ordered the steak medallions from the lighter menu for my dinner. They were pretty good. It wasnt an amazing cut of meat but it had a good flavor. The asparagus was cooked well but there wasnt much of it. There was a little too much of the red wine sauce. they could have gone a little lighter there. But overall a decent meal for $16.95. The noise level is really loud and there are a lot of kids. Or at least there were when I went. Tables are close together so you're basically having a conversation with your table and the one next to you. Not the best place to go for a date if you're wanting a romantic, quiet setting. Overall an ok place to go. A bit pricey but convenient if you're at the mall"
Jen D.,"Dallas, TX",55,135,37,2.0,8/20/2016,"I visited this place on a Saturday during lunch. I was expecting a long wait and for it to be busy. I only came here because my family and I were meeting some friends for lunch.  The wait wasn't super long and we were seated. We had 7 people total. Our waitress was nice and did everything I could ask for in service. She was on point and friendly!  We waited about 45 minutes for our food. It's always busy at Cheesecake Factory so you would think they'd be pros at pushing out food but they're not. So our table ate through 3 baskets of bread.  Ugh. The food. Why did I ever like this place? I got the Santa Fe salad and it was so below average. $12 for a lunch portion...and it was tasteless. I could see some specs of chicken, corn and black beans but it was like eating empty calories. But I ate it because we bought it!  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for my son and the bread was so hard! I had to pick the sandwich apart to feed him. It was so disappointing. I didn't know a restaurant could mess up a grilled cheese sandwich but they proved me wrong.  I wouldn't recommend this place for good food. It's just...blech. Dave and Buster's food is SO much better. They have an extensive menu and the wait typically isn't ridiculous like Cheesecake Factory."
Susan M.,"Dallas, TX",95,286,396,4.0,7/28/2016,"If it's Friday or Saturday night, don't come hungry because you're going to wait about an hour. This location is busy but food is solid and menu has variety to please everyone. The buffalo blasts appetizer is like buffalo wings in a crab Rangoon, delicious. I had the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta which could feed 3 people. My bf had Cajun chicken littles which is chicken tenders, mashed potatoes and corn. We could have shared that too because portions are huge!"
Wai Y.,"Dallas, TX",307,301,353,3.0,2/9/2015,"Food (***) Average chain restaurant food. Nothing great but nothing bad either. Light colored bread was cold & hard crusty. Brown bread was soft & tasty but also cold. Butter was prepackaged not creamed in house. Dishes were timid. Spicy dishes were mild. Typical chain restaurant, afraid to offend anyone, but wowing nobody. If you want fire, ask for it. Crab cakes were not 90-100% crab, only about 40-50% crab, but were good. All cheesecake are superb, especially the strawberry cheesecake, very creamy. For some reason, this location consistently has trouble cooking food that requires the chef to judge when something is done. Medium well hamburgers always turn out well done, french fries are soggy, fried fish still has gooey batter, etc. Even good reviews of the Cheescake factory point out how stuff is cooked wrong. Look at the photo of the salmon in LIly T's glowing review. Notice how the salmon is white not pink. Salmon should be cooked until the center is just fully cooked but still pink and moist inside instead of dry and white. However, their pasta dishes are good. You can over cook or under cook pasta by a minute or two and it will still be acceptable. Their Bistro Shrimp Scampi is probably the best in town. It has lots of garlic, which is just the way I like it. Also, every time I send something back to the kitchen, it turns out perfect the 2nd time around.  Service (****) Usually good but ocassionally very slow & bad. It was really good today. One waiter only, no waiter teams. Atmosphere (***) Bland, loud, typical chain restaurant. Ask for privacy booths for a better more quiet dining experience. Conclusion (***) Only the cheesecakes are memorable, I usually just get the cheesecake to go to avoid the usually long wait to be seated."
Jess K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",212,63,33,5.0,3/31/2017,Great service. Tried the skinny garlic shrimp pasta dish. Really great. Also tried the Adams pb Cheesecake! My waitress was friendly and took the time to chat for a minute which was nice and personable considering I was dining alone on a business trip. Speedy service too!
Cristy D.,"Fort Worth, TX",46,1,,1.0,9/18/2017,"I have been to this location 3 times and have had to send an order back 3 times for being undercooked. The first time, mistakes happen and they made it right. 2nd time they sent it back and finished cooking. No appology, no nothing. This time! Both of us sent our order back. Mine was a burger, sent it back twice and didn't end up getting to eat. I ordered medium well which should just be a touch of pink in the middle. Came to me, twice mind you, rare with the red juice still coming from the burger. The manager argued with me that it was cooked to temperature and it was correct. Again, no apology, no offer to make it right, just handed me the bill. Then, when I was leaving, I needed to ask the hostess something and they were all standing talking to eachother and couldn't be bothered to stop and address me. Never again. IF you eat here, stick to pasta and salads. Any meat you get will probably be undercooked and make you sick. Be warned."
Jaya F.,"Plano, TX",81,220,447,3.0,4/19/2015,"Seeing the menu today, I realized that its pretty similar to Cafe Luxe and my hubby's favorite french toast was available, so decided to go for brunch. Wait was not that bad, 15 mts. Got a cozy corner. Ordered coffees. They are good with the complimentary bread and butter. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes which was delish, loved the lemon zest which hit me now and then. But the french toast was a bad miss. It was so hard on the outside that a part of it flew off the plate while my hubby was trying to cut into it. He was pretty disappointed with his food :-( As a mark of disappointment, he stuck his fork on the piece that flew on to the table, not sure if that was the appropriate sign to show his displeasure with the food..hahahaha.... Our server was pretty attentive and service was meticulous.  Will go there again for other options on the menu but not brunch."
Michael T.,"The Colony, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Worst excuse of customer service ive ever experienced. Needed a table for 2. Several tables open, but they tried to seat us in a crowd of people who took up seats with their bags. As we were leaving, passed a table for 2 that was ready to go. Asked the employee what was wrong with that table. She replied ""thats were she (hostess at the door) sent me""."
Jane C.,"Plano, TX",8,21,44,2.0,7/30/2016,"The service at the Frisco location is mediocre at best. What saves them is location and the delicious cheesecake. I have been able to overlook their customer service issues because my family LOVES their cheesecakes... Until today.  Today was a last straw with their poor service. I called to order a whole cheesecake for a party. No special prep request or an unusual flavor choice. The young female on the phone who made no effort to be helpful or charming in any way, let me know I could not order a cake over the phone (since when??), and I would have to come to inside dining to order.  What?! I repeated what she said back to her for understanding because I am ordering a TAKE OUT cheesecake, and you are saying I have to come to INSIDE dining ( her words) to place a TAKE OUT order?  Hmmm... So 2 trips?? Or stay there an eat a whole cake??  She was adamant I couldn't order, so I said ok and hung up. I immediately called Watter's Creek Cheesecake Factory location ( extra 15-20 minutes from me, but worth it) - NO PROBLEM!! The only thing was: What time do you want to pick it up? and What name will this be under?  So simple and less than a 5 minute conversation.  Please someone help Frisco! They need a customer service intervention course!!!! If it weren't for their delicious cheesecake and fine location... They would NOT make it."
Norris C.,"Carrollton, TX",128,30,,4.0,5/20/2017,My wife and i always enjoy their food and service!! Can't go wrong with their pasta or fried catfish. And of course you can't leave the place without a cheesecake! My Lord!!! Even though I wish they never got rid of my brownie sundae cheesecake
Leah D.,"Carrollton, TX",0,25,47,5.0,10/22/2016,"Hubby and I came here to celebrate an anniversary. I had the Mexican Tortilla Salad from the Skinnylicious menu and it was so yummy, would definitely recommend plus it's under 500 calories, hubby had the Chicken Alfredo which was really yummy as well but didn't seem like a full plate of food for the price. We had a few cocktails and tried the fresh banana cream cheesecake and the original cheesecake which were very delish! Kinda on the pricy side but overall was a nice place. Our waiter was pleasant and although it's inside the mall and was crowded, it was very nice inside and our booth was very cozy. Would for sure come back again:)"
Scott W.,"Frisco, TX",0,18,,4.0,9/6/2017,"A consistent favorite.  I have dined in The Cheesecake Factory both here and in Las Vegas and found them both to be very consistent.  The menu is very diverse and offers something for everyone.  Of course, the cheesecake is to die for.  Never had a bad customer service experience.  Most recently I dined at the bar and found the food and service (like usual) to be stellar."
Nancy K.,"Lewisville, TX",22,14,22,5.0,2/5/2017,"Love this place! Amazing service! I wanna give a shoutout to our waitress, Sam! She definitely made the night so much fun and super enjoyable! Food is always good, plus the portions are huge!"
Bhinderjit K.,"Fairfield, CA",88,7,,5.0,4/9/2017,Best service I've ever gotten. Balyne the manager took care of us like no other. Made us feel like family. Best cheesecake experience of my life
Cynthia C.,"Carrollton, TX",37,635,595,4.0,7/10/2016,"I've been here way more times that I care to admit and it's always a great experience except for the one time I found a hair in my cheesecake. They gave me a new one and let me try a new flavor, so I forgave them. There's a great happy hour menu too because their original menu is incredibly extensive. If you come at the right time, you can get a ton of food for a a great price. Weekends get really crowded though, so make a reservation if possible or be prepared to wait around 45 minutes to an hour for a table."
Sarah L.,"Grapevine, TX",141,42,61,5.0,6/8/2016,"I am SO impressed with their customer service.  I placed a large catering order and the manager, Jim, walked me through the best ways to order to get the most for my money.  Super awesome, he didn't have to do that, you can tell he really cares about his customers.  The day of, he and the server (receipt says Marianne), got my order all ready and it was 100% perfect and it was ready right when I walked in.  A lot of times togo orders are missing something...  But this came with all the food, sauces, plasticware, plates, & serving utensils.  It was flawless. They even had 2 gentleman carry the order to my car for me. Everyone was super friendly.  Oh, and the food was awesome. Everything was delicious and was packaged up beautifully.  Note: This location is actually INSIDE the mall.  It's on the second floor and so you can park on the second floor of the parking garage. There is togo parking right up front ( something I didn't know because I didn't go to the 2nd floor)  I highly recommend this place for togo/catering orders."
Syed K.,"Little Elm, TX",0,20,11,4.0,3/9/2017,"The food was excellent, one star less because the serving time has dramatically increased and that too on a Thursday night seems oddly slow."
Jamie D.,"Dallas, TX",245,128,149,4.0,12/15/2015,"I don't really go here, not much of an ""American"" food kind of person and sweets aren't really my thing. But we had a holiday lunch outing with my team today and this was the place decided on. They had made a reservation  early in the morning so when we came in, we were seated very promptly. Our server was very enthusiastic! I ordered the hibachi steak (medium rare) specialty with sauteed spinach and tempura green beans. This was REALLY good. Yes, all the pink/red parts in the steak- not overdone...JUST perfect. I also really enjoyed the spinach. However, i thought the tempura green beans (or was it another green veggie....I can't remember) was kind of lacking. Too much batter, not enough of the ""veggie"" flavor...did not really like it.  For dessert, each of us got a different cheesecake, I ordered the peppermint bark cheesecake. SIMPLY AMAZINGGGGG. Especially for someone not that found of sweets ;)"
Bob V.,"Frisco, TX",0,11,,2.0,3/19/2017,Took 1:45 to eat there today. We had a lunch special of salad and Pizza. Sloooooow  Will be a while before I return
