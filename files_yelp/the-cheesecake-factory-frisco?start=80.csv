Cyndi J.,"Reno, NV",370,817,11,3.0,7/30/2015,"Eh, it's the Cheesecake Factory.  We were hungry.  It was close to our shopping path.   Our server was accommodating and efficient.  I had the Chinese Chicken Salad, and I am glad that he asked if I'd prefer the lunch portion.  I had forgotten how gargantuan the portion sizes were.  I could have fed the entire state of Wyoming on the lunch portion.  It was decent, fresh enough, if not really that flavorful.   If you like really big portions, a menu that takes 3 hours to read, and you don't mind the food not being top-notch, this is a fine restaurant to patronage."
Danielle F.,"Dallas, TX",173,5,,1.0,2/26/2017,"It's me again. We have Claudia today when we came back for our Sunday night dinner and the service was so bad I wanted to walk out. We have waited for our Jambalaya PASTA dish for almost an hour and a glass of wine for 20 min. I am a server myself and I know it doesn't take that long. I understand that the cooks take out the food in a ticket order, but this was way too long especially since all of the tables next to us got their appetizers, drinks, and entrees before we got our only dish. I wish we had Tara again like last time but oh well."
Malia R.,"Dallas, TX",498,673,1405,4.0,5/29/2015,"I don't visit this location often, due to the fact that it's always crowded, because of it's mall location.  However, when I do visit, it's enjoyable.  The Cheesecake Factory food is always delicious, and they give you huge portions that you may be able to get a second meal out of.  The check-in process here is kind of hectic, you walk in and there really is no line.. there are just people all surrounding the hostess as she tries to figure out what is going on.  But once you're seated, it's all good from there.  The bread is delicious, they bring out a wheat and a sourdough.  The food really doesn't take long to come out, considering how crowded the restaurant always is.  I've been to many Cheesecake Factory's in different states and have never had a bad meal.  The only problem is, I'm usually too full for the cheesecake, which is the best part!"
Terri J.,"McKinney, TX",130,339,570,1.0,6/14/2015,"Absolute nightmare meal. Ordered the warm crab and artichoke dip; got crab fritters and a whole artichoke instead. Took about half an hour to correct that mistake and apparently they went ahead, made our entrees and just let them sit in the window while they got out the app. I ordered fish tacos and they were ice cold. My friends meatloaf wasn't much better. Would have asked for a manager but he was too busy comping the diners next to us and blaming the kitchen to care.  Horrible service. Devontay the waiter didn't seem to care that he messed up the order and disappeared for most of the meal.  Won't be back. This place is so overrated."
Scott M.,"Aubrey, TX",16,59,19,5.0,3/5/2017,Absolutely love the Cheesecake factory!! It's one of our favorite places. The food is fantastic and of course the cheesecake is phenomenal! Great place for date night.
Lysa D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",33,274,89,4.0,5/16/2016,"The service is usually pretty good each time we've been there. We usually order some sangria which is delish, as well as the tuna carpacchio which is probably the best thing in their menu. It's something we order everytime were there because it's so damn good. Healthy and delish. You also can't go wrong with the cheesecake options. My only complaint is that they took the mini corn dogs off the menu!"
Robert L.,"Prosper, TX",8,181,54,4.0,9/15/2015,"Always great service and good food. Amazingly, they have one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I have had. The mango tea is very good. The Bang Bang Shrimp, I sub the rice for Angel pasta and it really goes better with it. Very good French Fries and bread."
John ..,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,,5.0,7/23/2017,"The two times we ate there, we were all happy with the food. Of course the icing on the cake is the cheesecake after the dinner and that is the ""sweet"" part of the experience. The staff was friendly and welcoming. We would eat there again."
Thu N.,"Plano, TX",471,158,1397,4.0,5/2/2015,"Finally found a non-sweet cocktail, strawberry  martini, to go with my Thai lettuce wraps."
Nicholas W.,"Lewisville, TX",0,5,1,1.0,1/26/2017,I ordered a blt blue cheese burger from their menu online to pick up but apparently they don't have a blue cheese burger. So I requested to have put blue cheese crumbles on it. The price on their menu online said $11.95 but when I picked it up they charge me $13.95. Wow and I said why the difference and they said they haven't updated their online menu in years. Hard to believe for a big franchise to not take of that. However I asked for medium done for my burger and it was all pink inside and called the manager and they said all mediums are all pink. Where do you get a medium burger that is all pink. I was so pissed driving back all the way back dissatisfied and demanding a refund. They gave me a refund but not going for burgers or any of their food anymore.
Jenny C.,"Frisco, TX",1,50,14,5.0,12/13/2016,"With a menu like a book, everyone can find something they like here! I come here way too much and spend way too much of my money here because the food is so freaking good! It concerns me just a little though that they don't list nutritional facts on their website... how much fat/salt and sugar am I really getting? Well, if I am concerned I guess I can go for the Super Antioxidant Salad with spinach, kale, avocado, broccoli, grapes, pear, blueberries, red onion, sunflower seeds, almonds and a lemon-blueberry vinaigrette. The dressing is paired perfectly with the salad- you have to have something to balance out the bitter taste of kale, and this dressing does the trick! All of the lettuce types in the salad appeared fresh and I did not find any of those nasty brown mushy old pieces I sometimes find in salads. The fruit and vegetables in the salad were also fresh and the salad as a whole tasted great!  My other go-to when I am not trying to be ""healthy"" is the Baja Chicken Taco dish. Mmmmmm, comes with small corn tortillas, chicken, a yummy mildly spicy orange cream sauce, cheese, avocado, cilantro, onions and tomatoes. The dish comes with black beans and a cilantro rice. They give you two corn tortillas per taco, comes with four tacos, because of the yummy sauce that drips everywhere and can make the first tortilla weak. You can get a tad messy when eating the tacos but that is what the napkin is for.  Bang-Bang chicken and shrimp is also delicious! They use a coconut curry sauce that is not spicy at all, with thinly sliced zucchini, peanuts, yellow squash, carrots, peas, shallots, ginger, and shredded coconut on top of the rice. They have brown or white rice, I prefer the brown. The shrimp is always cooked well and has a good grilled flavor."
LaToya A.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,3,5.0,1/20/2017,I get to choose once a month a treat for being good on my diet and every month I choose a piece of cheese cake from this location. There is one woman that is always their to help me and I believe her name is Starla (I really hope I got that right)! she is always so professional and sweet. The wait is never long when she is a the cheesecake register and she is always smiling! Great customer service :)
James B.,"Plano, TX",0,10,,5.0,1/16/2017,Their food is consistently good.  The menu is huge and I've tried several different items.  The drinks are expensive but they are worth the price.  Probably the only drawback is that wait times can be long.  We will definitely be eating there again.
Ardas S.,"Coppell, TX",35,17,3,1.0,12/17/2016,"You have many choices for a Friday night dinner, but this is not One of them. We went there at 5:15 pm, waited till 6:00 pm. We were seated at a secluded boot for four, even we do not feel we are at the Cheesecake Factory, did not complain. Service was horrible, waited to give order another 15 min, then three rounds of bread refill in another 45 min wait time. After that our dinners were served partially. My wife and I started to eat 20 min before my son's dinner served. No water refill..called manager, he offered free cheesecake for my son. I am sure we were not the first one, manager was so experienced with complains per my observation. 3 hours dinner for one plate food. Promised to ourselves to stay away from this place for life!"
Wayne W.,"McKinney, TX",89,164,23,4.0,4/3/2016,"Our ""GO TO"" place is the Cheesecake Factory due to the variety of selections available and the great service.  I even had a server forget to put in my meal a couple of times ago but due to the FANTASTIC service and Food we enjoy on a regular basis here I had no problems overlooking it.  He also comped my Cheesecake.  It says I've checked in here 3 times but I've forgotten 3 or 4 more times I'm sure.  Great place to hang out, enjoy some good drinks and food with great service."
Jackie S.,"Hurst, TX",0,18,17,1.0,3/6/2017,"Had a really terrible experience at Cheesecake today. Our server, Cedric, greeted us about five minutes after we sat down and didn't write down our order (a dubious sign). The first round of bread he brought was cold and rock-hard. Sawing into the loaves sent crumbs and sharp crust flying. I ordered the lunch chicken piccata and my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken strips. While we waited about twenty minutes for our food, we finished the bread and our drinks, but our server did not come back to our table to check on us. When he did come back, he brought my boyfriend chicken wings, instead of the chicken strips he had ordered. After blaming the kitchen and trying to ask my boyfriend to just eat the wings instead, he said he would run back to the kitchen and bring us back the chicken strips in five minutes. He left the table without bringing us more bread or refilling our drinks. It took another twenty minutes to bring my boyfriend his chicken strips, at which point I had already finished my meal (it was either that or let it get cold while we waited--my boyfriend insisted I eat). We had to ask twice for more bread and once for refills. The chicken piccata was good, the chicken strips were ""alright."" In all, what we had planned as a nice lunch date turned into a frustrating experience, and we left without getting any cheesecake because we were so annoyed at that point. Big bummer."
Stewart P.,"Birmingham, AL",120,269,79,3.0,1/29/2016,"I am a fan of one thing and one thing only at The Cheesecake Factory: the cheesecake. I have eaten at many locations across the country and while they are consistent, the food is bland, boring and overpriced. With that said, I did not dine here during this visit, only ran in quickly for a piece of sweet fromage to take back to my hotel room after eating at another restaurant nearby. So, to be fair, I am only reviewing the service I received and my cheesecake.  I'll start off with the wonderful part - the cheesecake. It was good. Okay, really good. Now, I've have better, artisan cheesecake that tasted like heaven and cost 5 times as much as this but let's be honest, this is the one thing that TCF does well in honoring its namesake. I ordered the red velvet cake and it was sweet, creamy and large enough that I passed half of it off as breakfast the next morning. You can do that when you're significant other is hundreds of miles away..... The location is a bit odd. It is located in a mall, which is likely the reason it is so crowded all the time, but it doesn't make for the nicest location for those who want to grab and go. I entered through the mall (I believe there is also an outside entrance) and was met with a long line of people who were waiting for acknowledgement from the hostess. I only wanted some cheesecake so it was quite obnoxious that I had to fight for an opening to get to the cheesecake display that was moronically located right next to the host desk where everyone congregates. There was no line for the cheesecake but fighting through the crowd took some time and then getting someone's attention took another 5 minutes or so. I did that annoying throat-clearing trick to get someone to look my way but they are like my children and have selective hearing. The service at this location left a bit to be desired. The person who did eventually help me looked at me with disdain, as if I was just another person plaguing the world with my quest for diabetes. The assessment would not have been wholly inaccurate but still, it would be nice for them to fake it a bit better. We exchanged money and cake with not so much as a grunt of human friendliness from their end. I'm sticking with my assessment that TCF is a cruddy place to eat anything other than cheesecake.... but once in a while you need that cheesy goodness, and this is a decent place as any to get it."
Mike M.,"Flower Mound, TX",10,77,4,1.0,3/1/2017,"How do you complain about wonderful food?  Well, let me try.  First, I met a friend there for a much needed visit.  We live several hours apart and this is our mid-way point.  The food was great! My salad was perfect, his steak was cooked just right and our waitress, Stephanie, was awesome!  So how could I just give them one star?  As I mentioned I met my friend there for a visit, but the music was so loud we could barely hear each other!  We asked them to turn it down twice with little success.  We didn't go there to listen to their background music, we went there to talk!  If a restaurant refuses to accomodate the customer in such a simple thing it ruins the whole experience!  Great food?  Yes.  Great service? Yes,  thank you Stephanie.  A great experience for our meeting?  No, not at all.  This should have been a simple fix, but was completely ignored by the manager.  We will have to find a new place to meet for our next visit."
Brandon F.,"Plano, TX",0,6,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Worst service ever at this restaurant!!!! The female bartender was the rudest I have ever experienced. The food was cold. And took over 45 min to get. And it was 2 sandwiches. I had to ask them for our food.  Then when I got the food the frys were cold, the sandwich has no avocado on it. I didn't want Mayo on it, said something to her and she said that's how they come and walked away. I then asked for a manager. Trevor McMahan came up I told him all the issues and all he did was offer me a piece of cheesecake....  if there is a female bartender DONT sit down. And if Trevor is the manager good luck getting anything. Every other time has been good service."
Tony T.,"Frisco, TX",88,89,180,5.0,10/16/2016,Rex R. thank you for treating us so nice. His service is above par. He was polite patient and caring. This is a new place for us and it's a big menu. Great service and delicious food. The bread was tasty too :) Sea Salted Caramel Cheesecake is so good! Once again Rex R. amazing job.
