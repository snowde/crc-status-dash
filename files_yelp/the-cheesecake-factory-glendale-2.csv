Katherine L.,"Arcadia, CA",184,240,146,4.0,1/4/2018,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 - 2/100 Shout out to this place being opened during New Years day, as with most stores in the Americana! Came here during New Years day for dinner, and found out that this place was packed! Guess everyone else also thought starting their year with some cheesecake won't be a bad idea ;) There was a line to put your name down with the hostess, but luckily the bar and the high top area is self seating. I was lucky enough to be able to find an empty high top table and got seated right away. ALWAYS ALWAYS CHECK!  We ordered a Steak Medallion and a Pasta Napoletana off of their special menu, items on those menu in our opinion are more worth it than the other dishes on the regular menu.  Both dishes were very filly and yummy, we enjoyed both dishes very much and I still have pasta leftovers even after stuffing my face. However, as with all other dishes from Cheesecake Factory, don't expect it to be healthy since it's cooked with lots of oil/butter/flavorings.  Overall good experience, I like that the Americana CF location is in such a prime spot because Americana is the perfect date location (esp with all the festival lights). Since I got a bunch of gift cards to CF with their promotion earlier (2 slices of cheesecake when you purchase $25 gift card), I will definitely be coming back."
Jen L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,9,2,1.0,1/3/2018,"Highly disappointed with my visit here! For one, my server was extremely slow! Two, my toast came out burnt but once but twice. By the time a decent batch of toast was served my dip was cold!  Even worse, I was given TWO dirty plates and when I notified a server, he turned around and gave me the SAME DIRTY PLATES! How UNSANITARY it that?!? I mentioned it to the manager and the server states he washed them but when I said no you did not because the plates had the same dirt stains, the server then says he wiped them.  Not only did he blatantly lie to my face but also to his manager. More so, he thought it was ok to give me the same DIRTY plates! OUTRIGHT DISGUSTING!"
Serli N.,"Glendale, CA",138,126,276,3.0,1/3/2018,"More like 3.5 stars for me... I feel like CF is a jack of all trades. They have an extremely large menu so there's something for everyone, but with this variety you compromise some quality. The food is consistent and good MOST of the time, but other times the quality hasn't been great, the wait does tend to be long, and it gets very loud indoors when it's busy. It's hard to give one rating when I've been here more times than I can remember with varying experiences but the Americana location is by far the closest and my most frequented location. I've had many items from their menu over the years...from appetizers: avocado egg rolls (delicious), fried mac and cheese (pretty good), tex mex eggrolls (just okay), sweet corn tamale cakes (amazing but so many calories!)... from entrees: Louisiana pasta chicken (good but heavy), pasta da vinci (decent as well), veggie burger (amazing surprisingly), Mexican tortilla salad (hit or miss but usually good)... brunch/breakfast: monte Cristo is my sister's favorite. Probably a few more I'm forgetting at the moment. The wait times can get long on the weekends. When majority of restaurants now use the texting system, I don't like how they give you a buzzer at this location so you can't walk around too far while you wait. They do validate for Americana parking. Service has always been good. Regardless of the average rating, CF is like a staple that I'll be returning to due to its a popular choice among friends and it having something for everyone. Also, their tuxedo cheesecake is the best cheesecake I've ever had."
Karl K.,"Los Angeles, CA",291,374,3668,3.0,12/17/2017,"Come for dinner at 4pm, skip the seafood chicken jambalaya, get the chicken piccata  ------------------- This basically sums up our recent experience here. The line at 4 PM on Saturday (admittedly, the weekend before Christmas) was tolerable at 40 minutes. If you come after that then you are screwed and be prepared to wait for upwards of 90 minutes or more. Anyway our party of four adults one kid and one toddler was seated in a seemingly large booth. However the seats felt like an airplane seating - meaning if one of us had to exit to the aisle it required a major reshuffling of people sitting in the same row. Probably because of the toddler highchair but still this felt really tight even without the highchair. The only dish worth mentioning today was the lemon chicken piccata that wifey got. It had the perfect balance of tender chicken breast, citrus zest, and just the right amount of cream without being overbearing. Meanwhile the seafood chicken jambalaya pasta was a complete hot mess and should be burned alive LOL! I mean seriously why put Jambolaya with pasta and furthermore the Jambolaya had no southern seasoning nor spice. Pass! Thank God they did not screw up the cheesecake - both the key lime cheesecake and the strawberry cheesecake were excellent - as they should be from a restaurant who's name sake is cheesecakes LOL. Last tip: they validate Americana parking for up to two hours. Assuming you find Americana parking the weekend before Christmas."
Eamon S.,"Burbank, CA",119,114,54,5.0,12/29/2017,"The brunch here on the weekend is worth it alone. In the midst of the busy Americans, Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. With my family in town for the holidays, I chose this place as a great place for brunch while also viewing the great Christmas lights of the Americana. This was a Christmas Eve, so the expectation was it was going to be very busy. However, thinking ahead and coming early as Brunch started was good thinking. We waited for around 5 mins, and was promptly seated. Our server Omar was very attentive and catered to one of our party food allergies very well. I ordered the beautiful Bruleed French Toast with bacon! Oh man this was a gorgeously tasty dish, especially after being drenched in maple syrup. To top it all off, I got myself a Bloody Mary! I love dining here and never have any issue with service. I will make this a staple for brunch in the future."
Maika P.,"Los Angeles, CA",271,113,19,3.0,1/6/2018,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory except that it's in a really busy area at the Americana. It's always packed here! We got lucky last night as we had an early dinner around 5 and were able to be seated right away. Since it's so busy, the service was just enough so that the waiters would give us water and bread, let us order, bring the food, and then give us the check. They are beyond busy. The food was as good as usual but for the Americana, there's definitely way more foot traffic so expect some sort of wait. Don't forget to give your parking ticket! They do validate."
Olga P.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/7/2018,"I don't know why this restaurant has so few stars. I really like it. At first, location is amazing. What the great view!! Secondly, it's the endless selection in the menu. And every dish i ordered was incredibly delicious and portion huge. Good service.  Thank you!"
Marc A.,"Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA",165,107,591,2.0,9/3/2017,"I usually like Cheesecake Factory but today's visit was not good at all.  I already wrote them a nice letter so I will keep this short and sweet. 1) When you page someone, don't wait 20 minutes to seat them.  Print the paper and place it in the slot like everyone else's.  And when you see me standing by the column, waiting like everyone else...Ask me if I've been taken care of... 2) Don't let dogs who are not seeing eye dogs or legitimate comfort dogs into the restaurant.  It's just not necessary. Food was mediocre, but consistently mediocre.  Lucky for you my kid likes your pasta...Why, I have no idea."
Anna D.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,2.0,12/28/2017,"I was so excited to go eat here, it was my first time. But the wait was 45 minutes. Then I ordered a papaya Mojito I waited another 45 minutes for my drink. My husband ordered the New York steak with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were cold the steak was also cold so disappointing for a $20 something dollars.My son ordered  spaghetti with meatballs. His spaghetti was mixed with pasta and their was only one meatball. The food is mediocre not all that to wait 45 minutes for. I'm Very disappointed . Its expensive for the food they serve. Will never visit again and it's not worth the wait."
Susanna O.,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",200,257,435,1.0,11/1/2017,"Figured I have a sensitive stomach and wasn't planning on updating my review, however after speaking to a few people and figuring out I wasn't alone I decided I'll go ahead and share my experience.  Had a late lunch with my family and a few hours later I felt extremely nauseous. End be all, I ended up in the hospital for food poisoning and have never felt so terrible in my life. I had one of their new Orlean style pastas and I'm not sure if it was the chicken or perhaps the sauce. Let's just say I am scarred from ever eating here.. and don't want to think about chicken or pasta.  Such a terrible experience. I never thought cheesecake to be a 5 Star, but it was always convenient. Convenience is not worth anyone's well being.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cheesecake Factory has so many options that you will find something of your liking. Those who like to watch the calories they have a ""skinnylicious"" menu.  All plates are huge; you can share!!  For those not worried about calories my favorites off the menu are: The jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp. A bit spicy with some Cajun seasoning all over the pasta, grilled bell peppers and poultry and shrimp.  Avocado egg rolls! A fun, fried, oily appetizer that everyone just loves.  Ahi carpaccio. A plate filled with an extremely thin layer of ahi, with some ginger and sesame sauce. It's not heavy and you won't feel guilty.  Recently however, I ordered the herb crusted salmon along with a dark greens mix salad (no dressing; lemon wedges on side) and was appalled when 90% of the salad was old. I mean, it smelled old from the second they sat it down.  We ordered two of these, both the same. So, it wasn't just bad luck either.  The manager apologized and told us he would send a new plate however we argued it would be the same as their salad bunch had likely gone bad. He assured us there was fresh salad in the back. (Well, good sir, why did your kitchen staff not make sure that's what they plate?) they ended up giving us free cheesecake and comping my meal. Which is great, except I don't eat cheesecake and I would of much rather had a fresh salad to eat for lunch."
Paola K.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,173,268,5.0,8/7/2017,"I forgot how amazing the food was at Cheesecake Factory.  After years of living without it, my husband and I had our date night dinner this past Friday at this location. The minute we walked in, we were greeted and seated. The service was wonderful from start to finish.  That's exactly what I love to experience whenever I visit an establishment. Fantastic service and delicious food. What more can make anyone happy?! (yeah, I know there is more but let's keep it humble)  I suggest if you dine here, you don't go without trying a cheesecake - I mean for obvious reasons (hint, hint: it's called the CHEESECAKE factory)  I tried the classical cheesecake slice and it's the best little slice I've ever had. I hope all establishments are this amazing so I can list Cheesecake Factory as a top pick."
Ruben G.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,2,1,3.0,1/4/2018,"Haven't been in a while, wanted a salad but they no longer make it.i ordered lunch pizza and salad, portions are smaller now. Place is always the same, just make sure u check your silverware, I had a thick black hair wrapped around my knife."
Paul I.,"Los Angeles, CA",285,110,315,3.0,8/10/2017,"Came here for my Godmonther's birthday. We have been coming here for years. Service is hit or miss, depending on the day, time, and (obviously) server you get.  Food is good! But very high in calories and fat. For those who are trying to watch the calories, you can choose from their skinnylicious menu (but you trade off a lot of the flavor and.. yes carbs). The hardest thing about The Cheesecake Factory is it has 100000 things on the menu. It is so hard to choose sometimes. My favorite menu items are the chicken and shrimp gumbo, factory burger, jambalaya with pasta, and chicken romano.  We usually get an order of the calamari and avocado egg rolls to start.  Great place to indulge in food for 'cheat' meals. Also a great place to go with people of varying taste since there is literally something for everyone.  There is a huge parking lot. Remember to validate! Cheers."
Elle02__ M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,33,1.0,10/27/2017,"Do not go here. So not worth it.  First of all, the wait is RIDICULOUS.  The staff is terrible.  They take forever to bring out your food.  Food comes cold.  I am only giving it 1 stars because they have decent drinks, and food but really good Cheesecake.  I don't come here to sit down and eat anymore, after this one time a FLY LANDED on our bread. And when I told the waitress, she just laughed. And asked if we still wanted the bread!!!! I thought she was joking. Obviously, she's a bimbo.  I've been here a couple of time because I live so close and used to work nearby, so I'd stop by for lunch and of the many crappy waiters, she was definitely the worst.  My boyfriends steak was so over cooked it was burnt!! And on top of that, it was COLD!! He ended up switched it for something else.  I only stop by to pick up cheesecake which is quick and easy.  The banana cream cheesecake is my fav. I craved it a lot while I was pregnant, so my lovely boyfriend did many trips and each time, I was happy. And even more that I didn't have to sit through another bad experience.  If you like the Cheesecake Factory, I recommend the location in Pasadena. No wait and better staff."
Frank S.,"La Verne, CA",0,4,4,1.0,12/20/2017,Front desk incorrectly paged us and had to ask about getting seated after seeing other being seated before us. This will be taken out in the waiters tip ($0.00). Perhaps management should share the downstream impact to earning potential.  Let's see how the rest of this goes during dinner.
Greg P.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,21,38,3.0,12/27/2017,"The food is alright and the service is very hit or miss. I've been coming here for years because it's an easy place to eat at the Americana with friends/family, since they have every type of food on the menu imaginable.  At my last visit, our server was great. Her name was Kelly B and she was very sweet, attentive, and overall one of the better servers that I have had while eating at this location.  Of all the things I have eaten at Cheesecake, I will say one item on the menu sticks out to me and I get it almost every time. That is the dressing on the Santa Fe Salad (it is a Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette). It is very delicious and I typically ask for that dressing on almost any salad I order. Definitely recommend that dressing.  One of the biggest problems I have had at Cheesecake Factory is when I adjust the specifications of a dish, it typically comes out wrong. I have no idea why? I find it hard to believe it's the servers putting in the wrong order every time (that would be just too coincidental). I like to think it's miscommunication either in the kitchen or with the expo/food runners. Whatever it is, I always expect my order to come out wrong if I change it up from what the menu has, so I pretty much try my best to either keep it very simple or just find an entree that doesn't need any adjustments. For example, I gave up on ordering a burger with the exact ingredients that I like. It's like the chef's take a look at my burger order and say ""well, that's cute, but I think he'll like this instead."" Nah... I just want my burger the way I asked please.  Overall, the Cheesecake Factory can be a very hit or miss place with both food and service. The upside to the restaurant is that the menu is gigantic, so it's perfect for a group of people who want different foods. It's a nearly impossible feat to find somebody that wouldn't like anything on the menu. I will probably always be dragged back here by friends/family just because the convenience of the large menu, but in reality, the Americana has so many better restaurants (in my opinion)."
Zoe K.,"Claremont, CA",58,224,845,3.0,8/8/2017,"This restaurant has really fast, nice customer service. Everyone was helpful and professional.  It's right where the action is so perfect for fun after.  Great drinks from the bar for sure. The food however was awful. The calamari was mushed together with some awful frying not suitable at all. The burger presentation was sloppy as well with sweet potato fries stuck together. It tasted good, but looked messy. Cheese Cake Factory is never one of my choices for  restaurants and this reminds me why. Very nice outside seating, you can just seat yourself at the bar, no wait. Great cocktails"
Tyshon A.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,161,2684,3.0,6/8/2017,"I always have mixed feelings when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory. Either it's really good or really bad. And for the most part there is no in between. My girlfriend and I are both not big on the Cheesecake Factory. We said since we've never had it together that we should try it.  After our meal there we are sticking to our no Cheesecake Factory rule.  This location is pretty cool and big. They have a lot of patrons that frequent here. The staff seemed to be on it and they seated us rather quickly even with them being busy. As you know they have a huge menu. Which can be kind of a down side because that leaves no room for pictures and too many different dishes for the chefs to make. But it is what it is.  I orders the truffle honey chicken which sounded amazing but it was blah. It reminded you chicken fried steak with a honey glaze. The coating on the chicken was overly sweet and falling off. So I had to scoop the mash, chicken n the coating to the effect. The mash potatoes were the savior of that dish.  My girlfriend ordered some other chicken dish which was not to bad but heavy on the lemon sauce. That was was ok. We also had the sweet corn tamale cakes. Those are so good. They like made up for the blah meals.  All in all I'm not gonna trash the restaurant because they have a good clientele and rep but it's not for me. Like I said this chain is a hit and miss. If I go back it will just be for the desserts."
Amanda J.,"Diamond Bar, CA",499,167,694,4.0,6/1/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory! This was my first time at the Americana. Beautiful location. Clean and so chic. We were seated on the outside patio and the weather was perfect but a little sunny.  All of the food was fresh and delicious. Service was great. We came for a lunch meeting and since they were not crowded, the wait staff pretty much just left us alone to our meeting. That was awesome.  This time we tried new things and they were good. We did leave a little hungry as we usually get pasta but all in all fantastic Cheesecake Factory experience. 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge  70/100 #yelpelite"
Jonathan G.,"San Pedro, CA",39,18,2,2.0,1/1/2018,The slowest service ever. Our waiter sucked and barely ever checked on us. The food was ok (normal Cheesecake Factory) but seriously I was fed up with our waiter. I'm still sitting at our table watching the waiter walk around the restaurant with my debit card in his apron. Thought about dining and dashing but now I'm held hostage because the waiter has my debit card.
Elvira D.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,172,742,4.0,7/16/2017,"I appreciate the convenience of the Cheesecake Factory at a beautiful location like the Americana for a late dinner. Although the wait can be long at times, it's nice to know that it's open until late and you can peruse the stores nearby while you wait. The food isn't the absolute Michelin-rated best, which is expected at chain restaurants, but it's good enough to go back.  Some favorites: *Tex mex egg rolls *Barbecue ranch chicken salad (which will be drenched in dressing if you don't specify otherwise) *Nachos *Of course, their cheesecakes (big enough to share with 2 people) And in all honesty, you're safe getting any of the menu items and being happy with the food.  Perks: *They validate Americana parking  *Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating *Amazing service"
Rebecca W.,"Los Angeles, CA",738,320,746,3.0,5/17/2017,"Your standard beloved Cheesecake Factory. I love this one because it is located in the Americana in Glendale. My friend and I came here for a quick lunch before we went to catch a movie. We ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad, the Chicken Parmesan Pizza, and the Bacon and Cheese Appetizer. The appetizer was good - very, VERY heavy. I could only eat one. I enjoyed the Mexican Tortilla salad a lot - there's two tortillas at the bottom with black beans woooo what a cool surprise. The Chicken Parmesan Pizza was literally a glop of pasta on top of a pizza LOL - so basically exactly what it sounds like. Cheesecake Factory always gives the biggest whoppingest portions, so each dish you order can be eaten over 2+ meals. Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 (80/100)"
Scott R.,"Los Angeles, CA",544,188,123,1.0,9/18/2017,"Stopped here tonight. Rude counter helper.  Barking, no eye contact. Spoke to the manager twice. The young lady at the cheesecake counter should work in a cubicle somewhere, safely away from people.  Here another night.   Same thing.  Rude.  Unconcerned."
Sherry Y.,"Glendale, CA",131,4,16,2.0,9/21/2017,"I always order tuna salad with chicken farfalle, and end it with a cake. Never changed; I was happy, until today. we ordered fish taco and pork chop. Best thing eating tacos with a Mexican friend is she will tell you what sounds good. But the bad thing is, she will know when the rice is too plain and fish is flavorless. And the pork chop. Oh my, dry, not enough sauce, green bean is too hard. Completely lost my appetite after one bite of the pork and one taco. I guess they offer the free bread for a reason, at least you can eat something to fill you up for free."
Love G.,"Henderson, NV",78,55,64,5.0,5/28/2017,"First things first: I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. I eat here any chance I get and always try a different cheesecake. I could probably say that I've almost tried all of the different flavors. My favorite dish is the pasta da vinci, can't really describe what's in it except that it was chicken and mushrooms and the sauce is amazing! Service is always amazing, the waiters I always get are attentive and make sure we're doing okay.  I decided to try something new and got the chicken riesling and it was delicious - it was a butter pasta with this wine sauce around it with chicken and bacon and some other stuff. I mixed the sauce into my pasta and it made it even better. If you're looking for something to drink, I would either get strawberry lemonade as a non-alcoholic drink, or if you're looking for something with alc, then the Long Island ice tea is the way to go. I came on a good night (Thursday around 9) and was seated within 10 minutes. Glendale has been so busy that sometimes the wait times are almost 2 hours, which is ridiculous!!! But definitely worth the wait.  Wheat bread is always amazing and soft."
Soggy K.,"Burbank, CA",58,4,,1.0,10/31/2017,"I wish I could give them zero stars!! After we ordered our appetizers we noticed the spare silverware had HALF CHEWED food smothered on it. We checked the rest of the utensils and they were all sticky and clearly not washed well. I was personally repulsed by the fact that I have eaten here before!! The manager did not even seem surprised when I informed him of this issue, like it wasn't the first time he heard this.... I did not ask for any compensation, neither would I accept it IF offered, but he barely even apologized. This is a very poorly managed restaurant. I would suggest investing an extra $2 an hour and hiring dishwashers that are not literally drinking and smoking weed on their lunch break.  Terrible experience... Id rather eat fucking McDonalds."
Yvon Meow J S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",705,268,1633,4.0,2/20/2017,"Came to Americana to check out some new yoga outfits from Under Armour, and of course one can get very hangry just shopping, right? Well, just about every restaurant was full with lines, and shockingly that The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) didn't have a line, wow!  Since I hate to wait, we decided to just try this TCF, and it was delightfully good. We shared the soup salad special (clam chowder & mixed green) and the Sheila's Chicken avocado salad.  The Sheila's was excellent and of course the portions are huge as always.  So, I know that TCF is a chain that normally doesn't get much respect.  However, I've always had pretty good experiences with TCF.  So whenever I go to the malls, I will keep on trying different locations as I run into them!!"
Blanca C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,,1.0,12/18/2017,Ohh man. I don't even have the option to pick zero stars!!! Came here last night for dinner. And I was expecting better :/ I'm up at 3am sick with diarrhea and just feel like throwing up now. All I ordered was a club sandwich and a slice of cheesecake! The club sandwich wasn't what I expected. My partner also got diarrhea. I don't know what it is but I have a feeling we both got food poisoning from this place last night. $90 spent for diarrhea NO THANKS!! Wouldn't recommend this place.
Allison C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,4,5.0,1/1/2018,Just finished dinner with my boyfriend. Had a ton of delicious food & everything was freshly served & we didn't wait a long time. Jennifer W. was our server and her service was amazing. She was also serving the table next to us & she was very detailed about certain food on the menu. Her service really made our experience tonight a lovely one. Thanks so much for a nice time Jennifer! You started our year on a positive dinner note.
Koi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,518,1171,5.0,3/1/2017,"Am I like the only one who is barely finding out about cheesecakes amazing happy hour?  Damn if I would of only knew sooner I would have so came here earlier  Amazing appetizers and drinks for about $6 M-F from 4-6pm  Drinks were really good my all time fav is the cosmopolitan  Spring rolls were gross, like you can taste that refrigerator burn smell in the ingredients gross -burger was pretty bomb tho!  All and all great happy hour menu"
Mansour S.,"Rancho San Diego, San Diego, CA",119,220,1008,3.0,3/22/2017,"I came here (3/21/17) visiting from san diego & of course you cant miss coming to americana so we decided to visit cheesecake here for lunch , it is bigger than ours in SD ( it gives you this feeling ) looks fancy as well , i chose smokehouse bbq burger because beside desserts the burgers is the best meal you can order its perfect , what i didnt like is customer service our server was kind of rude , the bread we got was cold and very hard ( in SD its freshly baked & so soft ) and they didnt bring more , orders take long time to come . I always prefer middle eastern places in LA for their excellent service & food so i guess this time it was mistake changing that . Cheesecake factory in SD is way better than this one I'll cut two stars for service . 3 stars for the outstanding burger & nice interior design ."
Joy G.,"Pacoima, CA",9,26,30,3.0,11/26/2017,"We love to come to this restaurant n we order the same food.Food is ok but the service today is a bit slow,maybe because its holidays???"
Mary S.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",0,60,11,5.0,12/30/2017,"Always consistently good food. For over 20 plus years!! Love Cheesecake Factory!! Our waiter was exceptional! He was fast, nice, and got everything correct."
Abby G.,"Pasadena, CA",2,39,14,2.0,12/27/2017,"This place has slow service and nasty food. Only the bread and avocado egg rolls were good. The food took forever to come out and when it did my food was bland. I ordered the jambalaya, which is my usual order whenever I go to any Cheesecake Factory but at this location I regret choosing it. There was barely any sauce nor flavor in the chicken. There was so much noodles that my dish just tasted like bland noodles. I ate so much of the brown bread with butter waiting for my food to come. I probably won't come back to this location for a while."
Macky R.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,3,,5.0,12/13/2017,"I usually don't yelp but I had to write a review for my experience tonight. My sisters and I don't get to go out together often and our waitress Paige made our experience so wonderful. Our favorite suggestion by Paige was Adams cheesecake. If you like peanut butter and chocolate it's a must have!! We really recommend this location, and if you are going ask for her !!!"
Janice Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,103,75,5.0,8/6/2017,"Gosh, it's been years since I've had happy hour at a Cheesecake Factory let alone happy hour but it's a nice reminder of why I liked it. We sat in the bar area and was surprised by the prices! They were reasonable! I guess generally speaking, happy hour prices are typically lower. I forgot about that. Oh details... I had the skinny cosmopolitan which was refreshing along with the blue cheese and pear flatbread. We also ordered avocado egg rolls and Korean cauliflower. The waitress was patient with my friends as they kept asking her questions about the types of tequila, beers on tap and what not. The restaurant validates parking and shall return again when I'm in the area."
Collette K.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,87,133,5.0,8/3/2017,"Why does this location only have 3 stars? I was greeted by friendly staff, had an awesome waiter named Eric, and the food was exceptional as always."
Trin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",597,339,2176,3.0,12/21/2016,"|[ b u s y ]| Very busy location seeing that it's at the mall, one of the slower services ones I've been to. They get too busy and forget about you sometimes so gotta flag down for stuff but it wasn't bad or anything. They did run out of bread at some point so there was a wait on that (I love my bread here, it's one of my fav). |[ u s u a l ]| As always though, the garlic pasta tasted great and so did the avocado egg rolls! My only complaint about Cheesecake Factory is that it's pretty pricey for the portions but it's good to have once in awhile. Always nice to dine here though. |[ v e r d i c t ]| The waiting and seating was a bit awkward, they called us up but then we still stood there waiting before finally being acknowledged. Service wasn't too attentive here, and I wish they refilled the bread without being hunted down. Average location. Nice break from shopping though."
Amy G.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,5,1.0,10/4/2017,"I live at the Americana so I speak as an expert here.  Do not EVER order takeout from this location. Honestly I'd be hesitant to go at all.  My neighbor and I both got severe food poisoning from chicken here. Mine was from takeout that had chicken - they didn't bring it out until over 15 minutes after the time quoted. It was cold. I warmed it up at home, and 12 hours later I was sleeping on the floor of my bathroom with a severe fever and not even able to keep water down. My neighbor was also sick, and it lingered enough that she was tested by her doctor two weeks later and tested positive for salmonella.  Cheesecake Factory of course denied any wrong doing, but sent us each a $20 gift card for our troubles.  Tonight I was really hungry and decided to finally give them another chance so I didn't keep carrying this gift card around. I ordered the Factory Nachos - no meat, so I was hoping it was safe.  After again making me wait an extra 15 minutes after my quoted time, my Nachos came out cold. Not even lukewarm, cold. I didn't want to take the chance again so I had them give me a refund. I went there hungry and left over half an hour later with no food and a conviction that this is the level of quality anyone can expect here.  I have been going to Cheesecake Factorys since I was a child. I always thought of them as a reliable and nice place to eat. I will never eat here again, and since I live upstairs and like the sort of food they make, that's saying a lot. Edited to add: Instead of refunding me to a new gift card, they literally fished the used gift card out of the trash and gave it back to me. Disgusting."
Evan F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,362,113,5.0,7/30/2017,The staff at this location were very accommodating. Our party size started at 6 persons. It soon grew to 9 and then 12. The hostess were kind enough to rwseat us twice and move tables together to make room for all of us. Because of the moves we had two waitresses. Both were fantastic and got our order perfect. All of us at the party had a great time. The food was delicious and there were no issues. Everything was served at the right temperature and the servers did not rush us.  Located in Americana of Glendale means finding a parking space.  There is a large parking structure next door to the complex and the walk to the restaurant is relatively short.
