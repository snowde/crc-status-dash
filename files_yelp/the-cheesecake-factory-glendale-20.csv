Scarlett O.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,31,,1.0,5/22/2017,"So incredibly disappointed. My fiance and I came for dinner tonight. They sat us down and we did not have our waiter acknowledge us. He walked by us, looked at us, and did not say a word. I went inside to ask why we weren't acknowledged and the managed came out to apologize. My food came out cold, the plate wasn't even full to the top. WE NEVER MET OUR WAITER. He came by an hour later with some bread and didn't even apologize. Then we heard he was ""on break."" I don't think I will be back."
Kivork K.,"Glendale, CA",21,4,,1.0,8/6/2017,"I really like this place but before not anymore I ordered to go cheese pizza,  steak Diane and another plate with chicken I think it's chicken Madeira. Plus cheesecakes...  The food was terrible... Frozen pizza really... After 45 min wait   I get a frozen pizza and cold food... The pizza goes straight to the garbage can... And same way the half food... No way.. If u want waste ur money... U got it.."
Otto A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,40,4,1.0,9/29/2016,"Remember when this place used to be good?  A place that was the obvious choice to take a first date, celebrate a birthday or even for an impromptu ""nice"" meal?  I do too and I sometimes miss those days.  This place is awful now in that they seem to freeze all of their food and microwave them as they are ordered.  What happened?  The food is awful and the service is just as bad but sometimes worst.  The prices have skyrocketed but it seems like the quality of food and service has been left in the dust.  It should be criminal to run a restaurant this bad."
Stephanie G.,"Glendale, CA",652,204,355,5.0,4/26/2016,"Obviously the food here is always so full of flavor! It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants! They have everything your craving, from cheese cake , to steak, to salads, to strawberry daiquiris !  My go to meal here is the BBQ-Ranch chicken salad! The onion crispers on the salad legit MAKE THAT SALAD! Lol I'm in love with it"
Leslie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,61,17,5.0,6/11/2017,"Ah the cheesecake factory.  It doesn't matter which one you go to (I've been to 4) they are all amazing!  The ambiance is good, the service is good, and the food is always good (especially the cheesecake).  Just be prepared for a wait.  This place always has a crowd, but it's worth it."
Melody A.,"La Crescenta, CA",16,102,157,4.0,7/17/2015,Always a safe choice for a meal. I particularly like this location because of the outdoor seating that allows you to enjoy the music and water fountain of the Americana. Today I came for lunch with my mom. We enjoyed the Ahi Tartare as an appetizer which was perfect for 2 people and very refreshing. We then ordered the Vegetable Salad and French Country Salad. Both were of good proportion and tasted great. I'm always excited to try something new from their encyclopedia-sized menu so I'll definitely be back for more!
Betty H.,"Los Angeles, CA",230,310,1750,4.0,5/19/2015,"Yummmyy Cheesecake Factory!  The thing I like about The Cheesecake Factory is that no matter which one I'm eating at they're consistent.  The food is always good and that heavenly bread they have.  You know what I'm talking about.. ""the brown one"" is what I call it!   Came here for their happy hour and always leave satisfied.  I think I could just eat their brown bread and leave happy. Hah!  The food is pretty good and service was just okay.  A little bit slow, but oh well... we survived.  We ordered a variety of appetizers to share.  I like the Tex mex egg rolls and chicken sliders.  The chicken samosas are $5.95 and they are pretty small.  I wouldn't order them again.  The chicken buffalo blasts are okay too.   Pretty good food, decent service...  it's The Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect."
Shahin S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",396,9,4,5.0,7/21/2017,"I ordered the steak medallions and found them a little salty but the moment I said that, the manager and waitress did everything in their power to not only re-do the dish but to make me feel like a king. I have been a regular patron a love this place."
Agustin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,20,5.0,1/24/2017,We had an amazing time and enjoyed delicious food. Really good service from Christopher. He was really attentive and kind. Coming back soon.
Natalie M.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,1,1.0,7/9/2017,"If I could give them zero I would,   After waiting for 30 min to sit we waited 20 for our waiter in a hot no air conditioned section. Flies were all around our table. We asked for side of sauce waited another 20 min. As soon as our food came we made it to go. I'm not ever coming back. This resturant is overrated. If it was clean why would they have flies. BIG FAT ZERO. The Cheesecake Factory is NOT what it used to be."
Shin I.,"Irvine, CA",0,59,2,1.0,9/26/2016,"Got three things here: chorizo pasta, a combo pizza, and a salad that came with the pizza. Chorizo pasta was very strange, it tasted Indian and yet very, very bland. Just a weird taste, not really awful but definitely not great. Pizza was very salty and very soggy in the middle. Salad was similarly salty and sloppily drenched in dressing. The veggies looked and tasted wilted. Our server came by 5-10 minutes after serving our food to ask us how the food was, then disappeared into the oblivion. We waited for 15 mins after we finished our food before we got impatient and flagged down another server for the check. You pay a lot of money for crap food and crap service. Go somewhere else."
Anna S.,"Glendale, CA",0,25,3,5.0,7/28/2017,"I love this place. This is one of my best friend and I's fave restaurant in the area. Beautiful ambiance, food is really good and so are the drinks!"
Eva H.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,49,36,5.0,6/9/2017,Chicken Alfredo is amazing every time! Most of their pastas are very tasty. This is my favorite cheesecake location.
Jim S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/20/2017,"Celebrated my wife's birthday, service was great. Dina was very sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. Also enjoyed the cheesecake with strawberries yum."
Cara H.,"Glendale, CA",537,780,464,5.0,5/11/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite chain restaurant. There is always a wait, but it makes it easier now that they text you when your table is ready. One of my favorites is the Steak Diane, they tend to over cook, so I get mine medium because I like medium-well. The sauce is really tasty, yum!  I also like the Miso Salmon and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  I recently tried the Steak Medallions on the Skinnylicious menu and it is like a light version of Steak Diane, yummy. They also have skinny drinks, the Long Island was good. My fave cheesecake is the macadamia nut, but they are all pretty good!"
Avishek C.,"Anaheim, CA",79,223,11,2.0,3/28/2016,"My wife and I came here for lunch on Easter. They place wasn't very crowded and we were seated immediately. The staff was friendly.  However, the bowls glasses and cutlery were dirty and they all stink of old egg yolk. Smell was so bad it was nauseating and were not able to finish our meal. We got our meal to go and left. The food wasn't that bad. In fact the stuffed mushrooms were made very well. But, if I can't eat a restaurant without feeling sick due to the cleanliness of the place, I cannot recommend it."
Alyssa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,19,25,3.0,4/6/2017,"I'm an occasional diner here at this location, but based on today's experience, I was a little disappointed. We came around 8pm or so and the wait wasn't too bad. Our waitress' name was Hailey/Bailey and maybe it's an off day, but she claimed she misheard my order. My family already finished eating their food before my correct order came out. Plus she didn't check on us as we'd hope for. At least to compensate for the mistake. Although she offered soup/salad while I waited, but she was nowhere to be found after. Overall, a not so good experience tonight."
Geo R.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,20,8,5.0,7/15/2017,Best fod in town love the whole grument style this restaurants provides. Workers are friendly and are always willing to fix any incoviniance.
J C.,"Burbank, CA",0,31,15,2.0,4/11/2017,"My wife and I went in for lunch.  I was amazed there was no line and we were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waitress, Stephanie, appeared nice.  However, the service went downhill from there on.  We waited a long time to receive our ordered food.  Once it came, our entrees were brought before our appetizer.  When I asked our waitress what happened, instead of apologizing, she replied, ""good question"" and walked away.  Not once did she come by to see if our food was OK or to refill our drinks.  Twenty minutes later, she showed up to let us know that Jonathan was taking over during her break. Jonathan was no better, he never came back.  We were forced to flag down another waiter to get the check. My wife and I have been here before and received good service.  This is the first time the service was this bad. In sum, my overall rating is based on the food (4 stars) and the service ( 0 stars)."
Lisa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,270,422,3.0,7/16/2015,"Even though food is kinda pricey, the amount they give you will leave you stuffed and the deliciousness of it will make you want more.  I really like the bread they always give in the beginning, but it's not great when it's not warm.  I really like the Davinci pasta and the Louisiana chicken pasta there. I think these two dishes really have a good medley of flavors.  I'm usually not a big fan of desserts, but the red velvet cheesecake was good. It wasn't overbearingly sweet as I thought it would be.  I've also been here during happy hour. Appetizers and drinks are great during this time at an even better price.  Service is great and friendly. An enthusiastic waiter/waitress makes a real big difference.  Overall, besides the children that scream and cry out every once in awhile, and having to talk over voices since it's kinda loud in there, it has a good ambience.  People really like celebrating their birthdays here (I think it's kinda exciting). Be prepared to hear them sing ""happy birthday"" maybe a couple hundred times. Jk. But you know what I mean. Haha."
