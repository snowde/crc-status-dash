Mehleye C.,"Cerritos, CA",147,105,36,5.0,5/25/2017,"I always usually have a bad experience with Cheesecake Factory but in this one my experience was fantastic. I brought my mom and family here for Mother's Day. The wait was an hour ( it was no problem, it was Mother's Day)  We probably waited 30 to 40 min and right away we got seated our waitress was kinda slow but it's fine it's Mother's Day and it's hectic and busy so we didn't mind.  The food was delicious everyone enjoyed their food, our drinks were good as well. In general our experience was great. I think this is the only cheesecake we will be attending from now on."
Dominica Y.,"Burbank, CA",32,19,4,5.0,12/22/2017,Great food and great service!  I love their Happy Hour!  The menu is full of variety!  The cheesecake is yummy!
Kelly B.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",31,11,,1.0,8/19/2017,Honestly. The worse possible service ever. I've been giving this place the benefit of the doubt for too long. I've come here for a total of 3 times and I'm shocked. I just left this location and the worst service ever. The waitress was incredibly rude. She wouldn't check up on my party. We waited for 45 minutes for our food to be brought until we asked to speak to the manager. Then she just tossed the dessert menu onto the table and the bill.  Never again will I come to this Cheesecake Factory.
Craig T.,"Claremont, CA",1,9,,1.0,11/5/2017,Food was good service was terrible. Waited 10 mins for as servers walked by us. Finally I spoke to he manager who took our order. The manager tried her best but just couldn't make up for the poor service throughout our dinner.
Isabel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,40,5,5.0,10/20/2017,Who doesn't love eating in a nice place with a view of a beautiful fountain and relaxing place . Great customer service like always . Love it love it . Not my first or last time coming .
Maribel J.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,4,3,3.0,3/11/2017,The food is good and I always have a Great servers the only thing that sucks is that the wait is usually and hour and apparently they don't take reservations. So if your hungry this isn't the place to go.
Anna J.,"Pasadena, CA",87,38,14,1.0,5/20/2017,"While waiting an hour for a table I started to sneeze. I heard a bark and looked over at the bar. There was some women and a full blown Australian Shepard at a table. It was not a service dog as it didn't have a vest. I ignored it and my sinuses.  Finally we were seated and got out good and drink. My strawberry martini was not up to corporate standards. It was in the wrong glass and watered down. Total waste of money. Next the hibatchi steak was kinda weirdly semi pre cut as were the asparagus. I am not a child and can cut my own meat lol I think they pre cut the steak so It looked more generous than it was. It looked gross. The mashed potatoes were bland and cold. I have had this same meal many times before, never was it like this. Also, our female server was indifferent. I had to ask for a steak knife even though I ordered steak. Also had to ask for refills.  If this place was cheap I really wouldn't care but for the prices they charge they should get it together. Also I love dogs but unless it's a service dog it's a total health violation. Just gross."
Jordan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,68,81,4.0,11/29/2016,"Four stars just because of the service , every time I go the waitresses or waiters are very slow with brining anything . I understand it's a very busy spot and it take time but always over an hour is too crazy . Just hire more people or get better staff that check on people's plates very often .  But regardless it's a must stop by place . The food is always good and drinks are overloaded with greatness !  It's a little to crowed due to it being in the Americana but the good part is that you can see the stores while waiting ."
Miss T.,"Glendale, CA",1,169,289,4.0,5/19/2017,"When we first arrived the hostess was super rude, we were seated out side by our waitress and she totally made up for the girl at the front.  Courtney our server was amazing! Made sure all of our food was on point and was super nice!"
Judy L.,"Burbank, CA",123,263,770,4.0,4/9/2016,"Great service,  good food and delicious dessert.  This prime location at the Americana offers a wait list like no other. Every time I come to this location in particular I grab a menu because the 40-50 min wait time for seating allows me to go thru the entire menu including fine print. By the time we get seated, I tell my server we are ready to order before they ask for our drinks because after waiting so long to be seated, I can't wait 10 min for my drink and another 30 for my food. Other than that, food quality has been consistent and I do come back often.  But if you're impatient and you come during regular feeding hours,  you might be better off crossing the street to the mall food court instead. Happy eating!"
Dimple- LudMilla B. F.,"Melrose, Los Angeles, CA",260,251,1284,4.0,3/10/2016,"This place continues to be a sure thing any time of day.  I mean the menu is so extensive there's everything from burgers and salads to pizza and pasta to steaks and ahi tuna the list goes on and on. Throughout the years there hasn't been anything I've ordered that I didn't like.  Heck, even the kids fried macaroni balls are good.   If you can avoid not filling up from the warm table bread that will be the first obstacle.  Good luck. It's fresh baked, soft centered yumminess.  I'm salivating already.  My personal favorites are  1. Chicken Madeira- it's a specialty, hearty meal with savory chicken breasts and bomb ass mashed potatoes, asparagus and mozza.  Yes I said it! Bomb! (drops mic)  2. Chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta- this is super delicious, enough for two people. All time favorite pasta dish that never gets old.  3. Avocado egg rolls- I can have this as a meal in itself. The tamarind cashew dipping sauce is what makes this super amazing. 4. Cheesecakes- the white chocolate raspberry truffle is to die for.  This goes well with extra whipped cream.  The fresh strawberry cheesecake with real strawberries and glaze is an all time classic.   The key lime cheesecake gives a cool sweet and tart finish. Great palate refresher.  The marshmallow Smores galore is one my kids enjoy.  Gooey and chocolatey madness with graham crackers.  No fast food prices here. Nice, consistent establishment that has survived the test of time.  Would be nice to have longer hours of free parking to be able to walk around and shop after dining."
John C.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/2/2017,"Came here for a nice anniversary dinner with the family, but was very disappointed.  The server was nice, but waited over 40 minutes for 3 out of 4 orders.  My son's order came out after an hour.  Apparently his order was given to another table.  Was told the manager will come, but no show.  She finally showed when my son was done with his dinner.   We were looking forward to sharing a couple of cheesecakes and enjoy the night.  But semi ruined. Had other plans, so walked out. Not the servers fault, but could have been handled a little better."
Baldemar R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",102,151,127,4.0,10/29/2017,So I am reading all the recent reviews and I am basing my review on every time that we've been here. I do know that if I show up on the weekend the wait will be very very long so I tend to come during the week and tried not to hit peak hours. Now if my family wants to come here for brunch on a Sunday then we try to be one of the first people there so we do not wait in a long line or a long waiting time. So this is like any other Cheesecake Factory with a big menu to choose from many choices of cheesecake and friendly service. This will always be my go-to when I am craving something delicious and a great piece of cheesecake.
Junior S.,"Culver City, CA",84,81,98,2.0,9/29/2017,"There Wasn't A Wait Which Is Great & We Sat Outside. The Server Was Ok But My Drink Took 25 Minutes To Hit The Table & It Wasn't Busy. The Apps Came At Different Times 15 Min Apart, Our Burgers Were Over Cooked & My Friends Chicken Sandwich Was Burnt. The Manager Fixed Our Food & Was Very Nice To Us & Gave Us Cheesecake To Make Up For It. (We Still Tipped 20%) Because They Made An Effort To Fox Things!"
Christina C.,"Glendale, CA",214,191,662,4.0,11/10/2016,Their menu is like bible!!! Always can find different things to try. Service is very good. Oreo milkshake it's fantastic but I could finish it all because it's too sweet. Fish tacos was little bit spicy but it's on my opinion. Velvet red cake melting on tongue. Every time when I come back discover more yummy meals.
McKenzie P.,"Whiting, IN",106,14,8,5.0,4/10/2017,"Yum. I love this place. I've had a few bad experiences at this restaurant before but not this time. I went a few days ago and was quoted a 25 min wait time. It was much shorter. I had a drink at the bar while I waited and the bartender was a gentleman and very kind.  We were sat and decided on avocado egg rolls as a starter, which were delicious. I love the tamarind sauce! I got the Parmesan chicken dish and my boyfriend the salmon with mac and cheese. All delicious and HUGE portions.  I believe my servers name was Gordan? Or at least I believe that's what my receipt said. He was very nice and had a good sense of humor.  I guess my only complaint would be the small table we were sat at because I felt like I couldn't talk without the table next to me hearing every word.  Overall, I was pleased and I didn't even save room for cheesecake."
Tehmine P.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/12/2017,"We where there last night with a group of 10. I ordered the chicken mango salad and specifically asked for it to be dry, no dressing. When I got my salad it look like it had dressing, so I told the waiter (Christopher S )  'it seems like my salad has a dressing' he said he's 'pretty sure it doesn't but he'll check with the kitchen to make sure it's completely dry' He came back and lied saying 'yes it is dry'. I ate 1/5 of the salad when I actually saw the dressing in my salad.  When I brought this to the waiter's attention he just said 'oh I'm sorry about that'. He offered nothing more.   We just paid  for our dinner and left. However, because of the dressing I have been sick since last night. When I asked for no dressing it wasn't because I didn't like the taste of it or I wasn't trying to be a difficult customer   but I was trying to avoid getting sick. I can understand that there can be mistakes but for the waiter to outright lie it's unacceptable. I specifically asked him after I got my salad and he looked right into my eyes and told me it had no dressing."
Naim K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,15,34,5.0,10/2/2017,The best Cheesecake Factory I always been to I always love coming her with my family never had a single issue here staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh and tasty
Michael L.,"Los Angeles, CA",371,26,1,5.0,2/23/2017,"There I found myself: adrift among a sea of tables adorned with ravenous families clad in their Tommy Bahama regalia, battered in sunscreen, flush and eager for the next round of platters like timorous expectant fathers in the hospital waiting room. These fine people had been fully depleted by the long and arduous day of parading around the Glendale Americana like prize ponies at the county fair and they deserved a hero's welcome and a hero's feast. As the servants scurried out of their holes, their arms weak under the massive silver platters and their bodies starved and shaking from their Cheesecake Factory-prescribed daily meal of brine and amphetamine, they made their way to the tables to unleash the cornucopia. The servants presented their vessels in solemn reverence and with eyes cast down for fear of incurring the wrath of their noble guests. The floor vibrated from the sheer turbulence of the collective feeding and could surely have been felt in all the far reaches of the Americana. Chairs buckled, tables creaked and clothing was torn asunder as the orgy of consumption came to a boil. Chunks of indiscernible organic matter burst forth in all directions like a food grenade, splattering the faces of the servants as they stood like cemetery gargoyles, guarding the frenzy, hiding their tears, and biding their time. The eye of the storm came to the Cheesecake Factory like a morphine drip to a recent amputee. The nobles inevitably hit their critical mass and had to pause to digest and let their pre-installed insulin pumps do their job. In this blessed peaceful intermission, the servants cleaned in silence. I used this brief moment of relative serenity to make my exit, for I dared not witness the second wave of offerings. I turned to look back upon the Factory and gave them a tearful salute. They are doing God's work."
TC K.,"Glendale, CA",85,5,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"So I order Door Dash delivery from this Cheesecake factory. To start, I'm already mad because the driver calls and says there's no parking, so we have to put on shoes, go down three flights and walk outside to get our food when he has already been tipped ahead of time. Now for Cheesecake. The food is cold. I ordered chicken picatta with extra mushrooms instead of pasta. They give me extra pasta and no chicken. NO CHICKEN! Who orders chicken picatta with no chicken? No one that's who. Jesus.  Now I'm going through it all over again and have to wait an hour to see what I get next. Grrrrrrrrrr...."
