Matilda S.,"Glendale, CA",1,7,,4.0,6/13/2014,"Try their Appetizer Rolls! you'll like their tiramisu and yum cheesckakes for sure!!! I like the Americana's view when you are on the patio! I've been there recently with my professor and classmates celebrating successfully passed finals. We were about 15 or more people with different orders, and without any previous reservation, our table was ready in about 15 mins! and were well and on time served with one waitress only!  who actually was very nice and patient indeed! :)"
Eddie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",1300,58,,5.0,4/16/2012,"Another amazing experience at Cheesecake Factory. The service was spot on, the portions were just right, the quality of the food was superb, and the menu prices are very reasonable for what it is. Great bread for starters.. Can't wait to go back.. =)"
Ara G.,"Glendale, CA",90,84,1,4.0,9/20/2011,"Great food, great cheesecakes (I love the Red Velvet). It's basically The Cheesecake Factory. You've heard about it. It's great. Just go there."
Christine A.,"Glendale, CA",0,31,,3.0,10/2/2013,"Came for lunch with two friends. We were STARVING but didn't want to go to in n out or any of the places in the Americana (and the walk to Granville was far too far)  I'm used to a long wait here, I expected a long wait here. Our buzzer rang in a finely matter, and we headed to the hostess table. We literally (not exaggerating) stood at the hostess table for at least another ten minutes. The hell? My buzzer rang, seat me!  Eventually got seated. My waitress asked us what drink we wanted and...well...disappeared. Didn't hear from her for another fifteen minutes. Finally got our drinks and bread, and we chowed down  faster than you can say carbohydrates. Didn't come by for another fifteen, but we were in such bread heaven and gossip central that we didn't mind.  I got the lunch portion Caesar salad, which was better than usual! It was actually pretty delicious, and I would definitely go back for just that!  I also got the lunch pasta Da Vinci, with fried eggplant. Couldn't even finish it, there was NO fried eggplants, just an overall weird sauce.  Friend got the turkey club and loved it. Other friend got the kale salad (which she said was awesome) and chicken bellagio, and was satisfied.  Overall, it was ok. Waitress was just a bit unorganized, but whatever. Mediocre is all I expect from this place."
Alex T.,"Seattle, WA",64,122,,2.0,1/11/2011,"No thank you. After watching a movie the girlfriend and I wanted to get something to eat, and we choose to come here. BAD IDEA. Aside from the fact that cheesecake factory food is subpar at best, the service here was worse than usual. At first it felt like one of those Russian gulags, with only bread to sate our hunger. When it felt like all was lost, a guiding light appeared, our server! It was false hope though, because after ordering we didn't see our food for what seemed like forever. We actually had to go get the manager, and he went back and got our food for us because our server was off doing god knows what. The final nail in the coffin was that our server apparently didn't know the difference between the different types of cheesecake, because he got us the wrong kind TWICE before he finally got it right, third time's a charm right? Honestly, I'd never come back here, I'd rather go to the mall across the street and eat at the food court there."
Marlon A.,"Los Angeles, CA",237,13,1,2.0,2/19/2014,Eat there today and thought the avocados in the avocado egg rolls which I usually love and turns out it made my girl and I an upset stomache.  Disappointed  to say the least. It's been a fav place on mine.
Al H.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/21/2013,"Terrible service, extremely long wait, inattentive waiters, average food, won't come back."
Shushan A.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,3,5.0,3/19/2015,"I love the place. The food is really good, the stuff is quite nice and polite And I also love the small patio that faces the whole park I would totally recommend this place if you count on good atmosphere and delicious food"
Susan C.,"Burbank, CA",96,213,242,3.0,8/14/2013,The wait is nothing I'm a fan of.  The food is good but service is always challenging.
Orsi C.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",13,3,,1.0,9/7/2013,"So we were getting lunch there, right? Since we were in a hurry, we ordered something simple. I noticed a young couple sit at the table across from us about 5-10 min. after we ordered.The next thing I know the couple is served. Are we served? No! We even told the waiter we were in a hurry! But of course he didn't listen! And yes, we were almost late for our prior engagement. Based on this information, you should take our advice and NOT go to ""The Cheesecake Factory,"" EVER AGAIN!!!"
Adriana R.,"Manhattan, NY",372,132,18,4.0,11/12/2013,"Ok let's start with the lemonade! My friend ordered the Strawberry lemonade, which looked amazing (and didn't have the bits of strawberries that get stuck in the straw - which i cannot stand). He made it look like he was drinking the best thing ever! So I had a zip (mind you they rim the glass with SUGAR) and I was in love I had to order one for myself, and then another one after that haha. The food was great - good portions and surprisingly delicious. 4 stars, because at the end of the day - their menu is so overwhelming - too many options."
Pete S.,"Glendale, CA",3,44,10,5.0,1/27/2012,"It really shocks me when someone tells me they're not a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Seriously? how could you not be when they have such a HUGE menu to choose from? There's gotta be something on there that you'll like ;) One of my friends who used to hate Cheesecake Factory is a huge fan now after she started going with me and learning which dishes to order. I've tried many different items from the menu never once had a bad meal but my favorites would have to be the Endive Salad but it comes in small portions so i usually order 2 or 3 of them. Yeah It's that good. The fried calamari are so good and so are the Thai lettuce wraps and the firecracker salmon. Usually for a main course I like to order the grilled salmon special with broccoli and asparagus. It's the perfect meal, nice and light and not to mention this dish doesn't have tons of calories like so many other dishes on the menu. The Baja chicken tacos are really good too. Chicken madeira and their pasta dishes are also recommended. I've even tried this place for breakfast and was surprised to find out they have good omelets. Also, you can't forget about CHEESECAKE of course :P My personal favorites are the fresh banana cream and the brownie sundae. They're to DIE FOR. ok I should really stop now ;)"
Yu W.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,55,4,4.0,9/4/2011,"Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp is awesom! Black beans, mango salsa and spicy shrimps are perfect match. I'm not a cheesecake fan but still their Hersey Chocolate Cheesecake is rich and unforgettable."
C R.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,25,2,1.0,5/4/2013,"A bug was in my glass of Chardonnay tonight but things happen, and we were super nice and understanding about it. I guess that's where we went wrong. We told our waiter and the manager came over to apologize; however no other courtesy was extended to us. No comped drink, no discount, etc... Really disappointing, because it is quite disgusting to find bugs in your food, some act of kindness would've been nice. Guess we should've been bitches and made a bigger deal about it. Not returning."
Ninet P.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",1,26,,1.0,4/14/2013,DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY!!! Just because the lights are dimmed doesn't mean the customer is blind & can't see the filth of this place. I don't care how busy they are the customers health comes first. When they first opened it was nice & clean but now it's nasty and dirty! Hey Health Dept it's time you drop by this place & shut it down!
richard l.,"Glendale, CA",0,12,,4.0,4/28/2012,"Service is always good here. The food is mostly good. The quality is consistent. In my opinion, everything is good except for the tex-mex items (just go to Frida if you are in the mood for mex, also in the American) For breakfast/brunch, I would recommend omelet or the hanger steak (cooked med-rare) with eggs. For the rest of the menu... salads are perfectly dressed, chops and steaks are cooked to perfect doneness as you desire.  But items heavy with sauce can be on the salty-side... The sauces seem over-seasoned."
Grady G.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,127,53,3.0,2/3/2014,"Waiting can be a hassle but a least you can walk around the shops  while you wait. I had the Factory Nachos, which to my surprise were very good. Had a Stella, like always. They toast the chips before they put the toppings on which make for good Nachos in my opinion. The thicker chips can handle all the toppings without getting soggy."
Jean C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/8/2013,"When to Cheese Cake Factory for my son's birthday, as always I ordered the Fish & Chip, to my disappointment I only got 5 fish nuggets and fries with coleslaw.  I realized times are tough but for $16.95 I should at lease get 2 decent size pieces of fish. The fish looks like it belongs in a kid's meal ! After all its the ""FISH"" that makes the fish & chips, not the frozen fries or the coleslaw, they are just sides. REALLY !!"
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",561,1194,627,3.0,9/13/2011,"I usually just grab a slice of cheesecake or two than I am out and I don't know why I am never in the mood to dine here, not once. But with the opening of Glendale Pacific Cheesecake nearby it loo.  I dine, once in a blue moon, at the Old Town Pasadena location but never here.  It must be the bougie environment, that must be it!"
Joshua E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,3.0,3/29/2015,Okay the food is alright the service sucks if you are really hungry dont come here if you are will in to Wait 50 minitues than come here
