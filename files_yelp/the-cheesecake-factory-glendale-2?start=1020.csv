Patra B.,"San Francisco, CA",1259,552,2173,3.0,12/17/2008,"There's not much to say about the food here. Its pretty much the same in every city. It was a pretty chilly night, but we opted for patio seating to avoid waiting for a table. We had a heat lamp right next to us, so that did the trick and kept us warm.  The patio is actually a great place to dine. You can people watch, and listen to the Christmas music playing. Its a pretty nice little spot, and if you're there at the right time, you can watch the wannabe Bellagio water show. "
Sam L.,"Fontana, CA",4,29,29,5.0,2/21/2014,"Awesome place to eat @ the Americana!!!! The wait time to be seated for 4 people was 7 mins!!! Im guessing we came @ the right time hahaha Our server Brittany was awesome. Very helpful in deciding with foods and drinks. Overall, I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory location to all :]"
Chris T.,"Riverside, CA",65,124,359,5.0,12/17/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory started a Happy Hour! And what a great deal their Happy Hour is. Select drinks and select appetizers for $5 each from 3-6pm at the bar. I`m sure we all know that The Cheesecake Factory`s prices can be kind of steep, so to order something for $5 with a generous portion is right up my alley. Originally, the boyfriend and I wanted to order from the full menu, but when he saw that they had a happy hour, we ended up walking towards the bar and sat in they`re high tables. It was literally a minute past 6:00, but the waiter was so nice to let us order from the Happy Hour menu if we decided quickly. I got a Cosmopolitan to drink while my boyfriend stuck to water (he`s not much of a drinker). He ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders, Buffalo Blasts, and the Factory Nachos from their Happy Hour menu. I still wanted to order something from the full menu because I was craving their Chicken Bellagio, which I ordered. I got my Cosmo and it was yummy. I wanted to get another drink, however, the Happy Hour was over and the Cosmo was really strong. I don`t think I would`ve been able to handle another one. All the appetizers came out at once and my boyfriend underestimated how much it was going to be. I told him that they`re full-sized appetizers and that he had it coming. I pointed to all the food and told him ""this is all you, honey."" The Southern Fried Chicken Sliders I liked a lot. They use the Chicken Littles from their entree menu and put them in between two buns with shredded lettuce, tomato, and onions with a side of mustard and pickles. I`ve had the Buffalo Blasts before, and I didn`t really like them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them very much. He loves buffalo wings, so this appetizer was totally made for him. The Factory Nachos were huge, but there wasn`t really anything special to them. Chips, melted shredded cheese, jalepenos, sour cream, and guacamole. When my Chicken Bellagio came out, I was really excited. The last time I was at a Cheesecake Factory, my cousin had ordered it, I tried it, and I said to myself that I was going to order that the next time, and I kept to that. And it was as good as I remember. Crispy chicken breast on top of basil pasta in a parmesan cream sauce topped with thinly sliced proscuitto and arugala salad. Oh my god, so yum! I have added a new favorite to the many favorites I have from the Cheesecake Factory."
Monique P.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,3,,5.0,2/17/2015,"Robert, the server at the bar was awesome! After experience bad service at other places in the Americana I was happy to come in and feel welcomed. Robert did a great job of accommodating  me. Definitely will come back in the future because of him."
Cynthia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",487,201,419,3.0,10/30/2013,"I have only eaten here for weekday lunch. They have half salads that are great portion. They serve breakfast all day, which I love. Its usually too busy to eat at on the weekends, so I recommend to avoid.  The service is okay, and the parking in the plaza is okay."
Dont W.,"Glendale, CA",0,39,16,1.0,5/24/2014,Worst service ever they pass by without asking if you need anything or not i would recommend bj's foods better and better service
Ngozi O.,"Bitter Lake, Seattle, WA",57,6,19,3.0,2/6/2013,"For Food you would get a 4.5 review but because I had so many bad experiences I only give a 3. I love the food (Pasta Carbonara my FAV!!!!) I get and that's why I continue to go back but maybe it's time to find a different location. I LOVE the Americana at Brand and I love Cheese Cake Factory my complaints come from staff and bad service. The first time I went there the staff didn't seem friendly or attentive. They seemed like young kids who didn't care too much about the job. I felt customer service training was needed. The last time I was there I don't feel welcomed when I'm there, feel rushed and the last time I was there the dishes were dirty and food under the table and all they did was switch the dishes out, I guess I expected more when you serve me with dirty dishes and filthy floor."
Marina S.,"Burbank, CA",149,228,124,4.0,8/6/2011,"Normally I don't like the Cheesecake Factory, but somehow the ambience at the Americana improves it tremendously. I was particularly appreciative of our very attentive and accommodating waitresses who were able to help us make a dish agreeable for my husband's various dietary requirements. No sugar, no flour, no balsamic... He ended up with a Cobb Salad, and we had to specially request Olive Oil and Red Wine Vinegar on the side - with success! The Pasta Carbonara I had was delicious too :)"
Sue B.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/17/2014,"I happened to have some guests visiting from another state and we chose the Cheese Cake factory at the Americana to relax and have some lunch at the patio.  The ""hostess"" gave us an estimated wait time of 10 minutes after which she texted me that our table was ready.  I went to the front desk only to be told: "" step to the right with your party"".  When we did, she simply and nonchalantly informed me that: ""your table was given to someone else. Anyway you did not wait the entire ""15 minutes"", so another 10-15 minutes is not a big deal"".  I was floored by the unapologetic and unprofessional  attitude I was addressed with. I get it that the restaurant is busy, but that does not give anyone the liberty of discounting customer treatment and making them feel like herd of cattle. This is exactly how I felt when I stepped to the right and observed that same hostess asking the restaurant's patrons to ""step to the right"" and wait there until someone escort them to their respective tables! There was no courtesy or a simple ""please"". This is when I had it.  I approached her and asked to speak to a manager; whom did not come until I asked another associate to get me one and after another good 15 minutes had elapsed. Finally a person came and said that he was one of the managers. His explanation was that they are a busy restaurant but he will talk to her.  He also had mentioned that he will personally check on us during our lunch time; but of course it was just talk to shut me up. I never saw him again. Well guess what?  I work with the public and I am a consumer myself.  I treat my clients with respect and I do not discount or ignore them. Their perception and feedback mean my success and therefore I take them very seriously.  i will never go back."
Dee A.,"Glendale, CA",130,289,44,4.0,3/10/2013,"I had lunch with my daughter yesterday, she & I love to dine here. I like the fact that there are many dishes to choose from and any one you choose won't leave you broke. Yes, the wait can be a bit long at times, but i feel it is worth it. My faves include the chicken bellagio(delicious), pasta cabonara, farro salad, and turkey burger from the skinnylicious menu. For dessert, you must try the fresh banana cheesecake, it's like heaven in your mouth. I will continue to take my family there, food never disappoints and you always get service with a smile.:)"
Andrea H.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,36,,4.0,2/4/2011,"For a chain (should I admit I hate chains), this place has pretty good food.  Normally chains have tasteless faire for the masses but Cheesecake factory just gives you masses of food.  The portions are huge.  This is the perfect place to share with a friend or a crush.   It was 3:00pm on a weekday afternoon and there was a wait at the door so my friend and I went to the bar where we scored a small table. Why do hostesses tell you there is a 5-10 minute wait when there are 3 open to the public tables in the bar.  Hello. One of the hostesses had a banner across her chest like Miss America that read Miss Cheesecake. She said it was a pretty slow day?  Really a wait at 3:00.  Maybe she wasn't the brightest (recall the open tables) but she sure was cute. My waitress was just as bright.  My friend asked for a salad with something other than Salmon, waitress looked purplexed said there wasn't another option, I said how about Tuna, she said no.  Then I ordered the Ahi Salad.  Note to Waitress:  Ahi is Tuna. I feel like I am picking so I should play nice. The waitress handed us off to another waiter (thank goodness) who was as cute as a bug and gave us marriage advice to boot.  I just wanted to pinch his cheeks."
Jasmine D.,"Glendale, CA",53,103,36,1.0,7/1/2014,"By far the worst experience ever. Came in waited 25-30mins for a table when the hostess said it will be 5mins. As, I approach the hostess about our table. Three of the hostess had no clue about our table reservation. They stated the table was on hold. ""Are you serious?"" Then after waiting another 5min for our table. Once we arrived at our table. The table was not properly cleaned. The table was greasy and the utensils were filthy. Overall, management really needs to train their staff a lot better on cleanliness and customer service. Furthermore, train your hostess because they have no idea what they are doing."
Kimchu R.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/9/2014,"We recently ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Glendale with my aunt, my mom, my nephew and my sister in law.  The food was quite good, especially the salmon salad.  The bread they served before the meal was very tasty.  Service was nice and the waitress was friendly.  We will definetly return here."
Beth Y.,"Des Moines, IA",172,19,,2.0,3/30/2013,"We came to this restaurant because of the skinny-licious menu options. We had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated, and then were seated right next to the server computer station. Our server (Chad) was great; friendly and helpful. However, when we got the menus, they were incredibly grimy, with dampness, visible food smears and food remnants. This dirtiness did not inspire confidence in the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. Despite the disgusting beginning, our food was very good. I loved the warm asparagus salad and the grilled artichoke. My mom loved her mini crab cakes. Good food, a bit too expensive, good service. Way too busy, too crowded, and please clean the menus."
Bea B.,"Burbank, CA",52,53,12,4.0,5/14/2011,"Their National favorite dish is, I believe, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It was a bright and sunny Wednesday. I felt like taking my father to lunch plus it's been months since I had the Cajun Jambalaya. My order came and it was the most bland and uneventful taste I've ever had. I say uneventful because y'know when you've had a wonderful mix of all those spices, you feel like a mini roller coaster exploded in your mouth.  No roller coasters this time. I ordered a Cosmopolitan thinking maybe I need a drink for this. Nuh-uh. Did not work. This lady, I don't know if she's the manager, but she was going around asking patrons how their food is. Lucky that I haven't touched much of my food but she did look at my dish and told me it was odd looking. Now, that doesn't really appease me that someone said it was odd-looking. I immediately thought about my stomach and an image of frequent bathroom breaks. The lady immediately took my food and brought me a menu. She insisted on replacing my meal but having lost my appetite already, I just settled for the bread and butter... and downing my Cosmo. I was really pleased when we got the bill and they didn't charge me for the pasta. I thought they would and I was ready to get upset. Pleasurable experience overall. Oh and no bathroom trips when I got home! =)"
Melissa D.,"San Diego, CA",5,85,2,4.0,9/12/2011,"I'm in love with the menu here. They have everything!  I recommend going here for Sunday brunch. There's never really a wait and they have the best french toast ever! The server said they were cooked with champagne, so maybe that's the secret. Their dinner menu is also amazing, but the reason I knocked off a star is because of the insanely long wait during dinner hours. It's always at least 45 minutes and you can't call to put your name on the list ahead of time. Boo! Go here for sure, but not for dinner. It may turn you off from coming here again."
Robert R.,"West Covina, CA",320,52,52,3.0,5/5/2011,"I don't really like the cheescake factory. The ambiance is ok but the food is way over rated. I've eaten the food a few times and really can't/wouldn't suggest anything. I mean it's an ok place to take a date if she doesn't know any better. if you haven't eaten here, try it but don't go back.  This location is nice, big, if you eat outside you can see the water show at the Americana. If you do decide to eat here I suggest to eat outside on a warm night, the whole atmosphere of the Americana and with the water show it can be quite beautiful.  I usually just go in and get a drink, maybe an appetizer. I go here mostly just because it stays open later than any restaurant in the Americana.."
Chrissy N.,"Seattle, WA",193,483,13,2.0,10/18/2010,"I'll keep this short. The cheesecake: 5 stars, especially the seasonal pumpkin one. OMG. The entrees/food: 2.5 stars. Eh, it's AIGHHHT. It's more like I come here for the cheesecake and just get food because it seems like the right thing to do. The service: -992489083409832 stars. They have TERRIBLE service. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SHITTY TERRIBLE. Our waiter was Kevin and he took FOREVER to do anything. We actually had to get up and ask the manager to find our waiter for us to take our order. LAME. Then, after delivering our food, he disappeared for the rest of the night although he would tend to all the tables next to us. DOUCHE.  Worst thing? We order a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. He asks ""original or pecan?"" We say original. Then, he brings us a slice of normal original (non-pumpkin) cheesecake. We send it back--we figure, honest mistake. He takes literally DAYS to get us another slice. This time we ask for it to-go. He asks again ""original or pecan?"" We say original. He puts it in a bag for us and we (stupidly) did not check the bag since we figured theres no way he'd screw up twice. WRONG. We got home and it's a slice of pecan cheesecake. WOW. REALLY?! REALLY?! WTF!  UGH. Go here if you want, but seriously, if you get Kevin as your waiter...get moved to another section."
Vazrik A.,"Tujunga, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/13/2014,"I came here with my girlfriend for my birthday and had a great dinner. I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and she had the da Vinci pasta. The food was amazing but when we were seated we didn't not get any bread and butter until we asked for it. Other than that, service was great and food was on point. Definitely a great cheesecake factory.  Also they surprised me with a cheesecake and sang me happy birthday! Awesome staff!"
Nora S.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/13/2014,Great place but the utensils have been pretty dirty lately which makes me wonder how clean their kitchen is :/
