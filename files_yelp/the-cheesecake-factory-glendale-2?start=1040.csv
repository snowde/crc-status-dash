A D.,"Burbank, CA",7,55,2,4.0,4/8/2011,"I'm well aware it's a corporate restaurant with pre frozen food and boxed sauces of all kinds. Yes, I know better than that.   Here's the thing though, but I feel like you can't take yourself too seriously and you have to bend upon a society filled by those corporate restaurants... At least sometimes...:)   That being said, I always go the one at the American in Glendale after a shopping spree with either familyor friends. There is a really cozy patio perfect for people watching and enjoy the mini Bellagio type of water show right by it...:)   The food: I always order thir Miso Salmon for lunch and it's surprisly tasty, along with an Apple Martini, even tastier! Which by the way I love for lunch time since they add Midori to it.   I never had a problem with service there, they are always right on it, but again, I always go on down time for a late lunch."
Monica L.,"Alhambra, CA",61,36,,4.0,12/30/2011,"Everything on their menu is good. And they have an extensive menu. I love this location because after a good meal you can go out and take a short stroll around the sweetly clean and family-friendly Americana. They have the best margaritas in town. I always order the insanely delicious pomegranate margaritas. It's a combination of sweet and sour, and the salt on the rim just gives it that extra bang.  The last time I ordered the Steak Diane and Shrimp combo, boy did I not anticipate the tender steak and crispy shrimp that just blew me away. Definitely one of my favorite of the many items I've tasted. It's a great place to take family and friends. Service has always been top-notch and place is always immaculate."
Greg M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,5.0,2/6/2015,Went there for lunch today to checked out the new menu items. The eggplant parmesan was soo good as well as the southern pulled pork sandwich was the best sandwich I have tasted in a very very long time. Congrats to the Cheesecake Factory excellent service and food.
Mari A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",6,19,30,3.0,9/13/2013,Great place to have dinner. My favorite meal is their Santa Fe salad! Also great costumer service.
Fia R.,"Orange County, CA",1979,421,2094,5.0,8/23/2010,"I'm writing my review in this particular location b/c it's where I discovered this...... Red Velvet Cheesecake: better save extra room for that, folks!  Who would've thought that a Chain Restaurant not only has one of the best cheesecakes, but it has the best red velvet ever (in a chain restaurant!) WITH the best cheesecake in America. Although I do prefer referring to local eateries, I do dreadfully recommend this for starters...those who NEVER tried red velvet cake o_o."
Kristine B.,"Sun Valley, CA",6,31,42,3.0,8/30/2013,"Good prices, good food, good service !! My favorite thing to get is the Santa Fe salad!!! Deliciousness! Also the avocado egg rolls are a must! Fried zucchini is really yummy!!"
Jessica C.,"Temple City, CA",364,72,37,5.0,9/7/2010,"This is by far my favorite Cheesecake Factory. It's so much prettier than most of the other Cheesecake Factory's I've seen.  The 2 times I've been there, I had a pleasant experience. The first time, my server was Ben, and I love Ben. Omg. He's so awesome. I was trying to try new food because I'd promised my best friend I would, so I asked Ben to help me out. I described what I liked to eat and we concluded with the Pasta Di Vinci w/Fettucini (because I love fettucini). And when I had it, it was the best thing I'd ever had @ Cheesecake Factory. And after I got my food, he came back and asked to see if I enjoyed it and it really seemed like he cared. He was very friendly & prompt. After that, our server switched and she wasn't nearly as awesome as Ben, but she still made an effort. The second time I was there, the server was also good. The food was delicious. And despite my party being a bit difficult, our server managed to pull through with a smile. Food was also delicious this time too.  All-in-all, my favorite Cheesecake Factory."
Sharon S.,"Canoga Park, CA",24,39,2,2.0,12/8/2013,"horrible! I dont think I will every go to cheesecake factory again. We had to wait for 50minutes, people were just crawling all around the restaurant. service was horrible and food was worse. I ordere a sandwich and my bread was toasted for so long that it was so hard to chew on it. will never go there again."
Flora W.,"Riverside, CA",121,318,65,4.0,12/20/2010,"Quick Tip: They validate your parking ticket.  Good service, our waiter was friendly, food came out faster than I have expected (they were extremely busy), drinks are strong.  I had the Evelyn Pasta w/chicken and my friend ordered the Spicy Jambalaya Pasta, both dishes were delicious."
Judy L.,"San Diego, CA",10,126,,4.0,6/27/2011,"Decided that I needed a side order of sweet potato fries for dinner so my sister and I headed off towards the nearest CF. My Garmin Nuvi is retarded but it brought us to a parking lot right next to CF --- sweet! We went in and asked for a table for two, and were told it'd be about a 35min wait (standard on Saturday nights I'm sure). We went to the nearby B&N with our pager thinking it'd be too far and planned to head back in 20 minutes, but the pager went off in the bookstore around the 20 minute mark and we were stoked!  We were seated in a four person booth near the bar .. Not bad, as I hate those little two person tables. Not enough room to move, talk, or have a place for my plate.  David was our server, I believe. He looked REALLY busy but he made sure we were attended to and came by regularly. I LOVE the wheat bread at CF, and after I devoured the first loaf, he brought me two more! Sweeeet! I love the bread!  We ordered and got our food. The portion of fries was disappointing (got nearly double the amount at a different CF) but it was good nonetheless. My sister got the Thai lettuce wraps and she loved them. Lighting was a little too dim in this restaurant, it hurts my eyes but it seems to be the norm.  Overall great experience! Got to enjoy the fountains outside while waiting as well. Definitely a plus!"
Lilly S.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",57,173,23,4.0,2/18/2013,"Crowded, the hostess doesn't know much about her job. They told us we would have to wait 40 minutes, then 40 minutes passed, I ask the hostess and she says another 40 minutes; that's ridiculous. Spoke with the manager, straightened it out, food was good. Overall pretty good restaurant."
Lala M.,"Sun Valley, Los Angeles, CA",0,34,38,3.0,1/11/2014,The location is great. Outside sitting has advantage of nice view of Americana and the fountains. The wait is a little too long. 45 min of wait and bout 15 after you have been texted. We waited bout 20min for burgers that were ordered well done. It's fun but the wait is too long sometimes. Food is good.
Alejandra F.,"Glendale, CA",121,20,6,2.0,10/14/2014,"We went in with a groups for a friends birthday an many of the people we went with have never been to this restaurant. Once we had to pay we asked the waiter, Josh , if he would split the check for us and he replied "" ill split it just make sure you give me my tip"" ....we were so shocked and thought that was so rude, we were obviously going to leave a hefty tip because we were a group but with that attitude he defiantly shouldn't have left one. IF next time we go ill make sure not have him as our waiter."
David O.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,3,5.0,8/26/2013,"Good family spot.  I love having a big meal with my family on the weekend and this is the place to go.   Even though the menu is giant, the food never is bad.  The service is normally great.   I would recommend anyone in the mood for a big portion and some good food, come here."
Elizabeth C.,"Los Angeles, CA",932,443,848,3.0,6/2/2010,"(+1) Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.  (+1) Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake.  All of my complaints from before are exactly the same (expensive drinks), as are all the positives (the space, the service, the food). With the discovery of the aforementioned cheesecake flavors, however, The Cheesecake factory: Glendale jumps up a star."
Ethan B.,"Riverside, CA",85,28,5,3.0,7/3/2013,food is good service is need work. Takes to long to see a waiter. They always seem to be too busy.
Julio M.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, CA",28,74,9,3.0,7/2/2011,+Great for groups! +Cheesecake was amazing. +Waitstaff was friendly. -Very busy and weekends. -Food sometimes takes a while.
Frankie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,32,,1.0,10/27/2014,"horrible!! server was not attentive at all.. i went there with a gift card . I ordered the chicken and biscuits... it was sooo bland and dry, the biscuit looked like it had been sitting there since last christmas!! Lets not even get started on my moms meal because it was even worse... I will never ever eat such overpriced garbage again."
Barbara D.,"Los Angeles, CA",435,205,51,2.0,9/10/2012,"This review is solely on this specific location of The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to dozens of other locations and always had a good experience but this location is ......................... Everytime I've come for lunch (work lunches so I can't turn down), my food has taken FOREVER, it comes out cold, and undercooked (hard pasta, hard chicken). Without fail, this location always fails!"
Tammy B.,"Van Nuys, CA",2,37,6,2.0,8/2/2013,"Service was barely there and food took FOREVER! it tasted good, but not impressed with service at all."
