Jen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",276,161,35,2.0,12/9/2012,"So I'm not really going to comment on the food here, since it's a chain and the food is pretty good, across all their locations.  Sure their menu is way too big for its own good, but at least you know that there will be something for everyone you're eating with.  The bread is always nicely warm and the cheesecakes decadent albeit many cloyingly sweet - the best ones that I've had that aren't as sweet are the Vanilla Bean and the Tuxedo. The main issue of this review isn't even the food service, because that was just fine as well... the stinker was the management/logistics.  We came here with a party of 9 for a staff holiday lunch.  The problem: they don't take reservations!  I understand that they don't take reservations for smaller parties since they have many smaller tables and booths, but they really need to reconsider their reservation policy for larger groups... especially during the holiday season where many offices are doing their staff holiday appreciation meals. Apparently, they only have a few tables that can be assembled/used for large lunches and since other groups had beaten us to the punch, we were told that it would take about 45 minutes for us to be seated.  As we debated waiting, we stood around for 5-10 minutes when a manager came over and informed us that we could split our group into to smaller booths, which he said were next to each other.  He took us to look at the booths and yes, they were next to each other, but they were back to back, so we decided that if anything, we would rather wait for one of the group tables to open up (they ""had just gotten their entrees"" and ""would probably be done soon"" - HA, right.. because eating expeditiously is so typical of holiday lunches).  After another several minutes (and my attempts to really make things work), I asked about the patio that we saw other people sitting on, and they said that we couldn't sit there because the patio was too small and large groups are considered a fire hazard.  I figured this went for their second patio as well, so I didn't bother to ask.  As we stood outside for another 10 minutes trying to decide what we wanted to do, what our other options in the area were, the manager came over and offered to set up a table on the second patio which was significantly larger, where we ended up having our meal. While it was nice and we had a great lunch, I just don't understand why it took them so long to (point blank) get their sh!t together.  You would think that their managers would be prepped on what to do in these situations, but they obviously aren't.  I remember when I worked at another similar chain restaurant, the managers there would bust their a$$es and bend over backwards to accommodate large groups because they knew that customers = money and more customers out the door meant more money out the door (what a novel concept!!).  I hope this place pulls it together because while I'll probably go back to Cheesecake at some point in my life, I'm pretty sure it's not going to be this one."
Felix S.,"Glendale, CA",325,26,1,4.0,7/6/2012,"I'll start with the two things I don't like about The Cheesecake Factory; 1, It takes a really long time for the food to arrive. 2, The prices are a bit too much for what you're getting. Now for the good things, the food that you get is amazing. I've never had something I didn't love. Especially the Grilled Salmon and Jambalaya. I recommend to go there, and it is very classy."
Alex M.,"Tarzana, CA",56,105,5,4.0,6/8/2013,If you're a fan of this place you won't be let down. Solid service and quality of food just like the rest of their locations. A plus here is the location. Once you're done dining you can stroll along the mall and enjoy a day out.
Marina G.,"Glendale, CA",9,128,,4.0,4/21/2013,"Cheesecake factory is cheesecake factory- great food, wonderful customer service, and big portions for a great price.  The menu is BIG which can act like a double edge sword so I hope you are decisive!  Appetizers are so big they can be a meal! Salads and sandwiches s are wonderful.  There pasta dishes are GREAT! BBQ Chicken pizza- Delicious! Steak dishes- yummy! Salmon dishes- Yum- melts in your mouth! Ahi Tuna-- OH MY GOODNESS- my favorite thing to get if I want to splurge!  I haven't had much of their ""specialty"" dishes so I can't comment much on that.  But from what I see most people order salads, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza - the things on the menu that are the biggest bang for your buck!  If it is warm out I recommend sitting out on the patio by the fountain- it  makes your experience that much better.  Overall great place!"
Eric D.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/16/2013,Worst place ever. Overrated to the maxxx. Waiting close to 2 hours just for frozen food. Bleh
Sylvia M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,8,,5.0,2/12/2015,"They are always busy, but I'm glad that they are now texting instead of giving you those wireless things that vibrate when your table is ready. Last week my husband, sister and my daughter went here for dinner. There was about 1 hour and half waiting time. We were able to go to Barnes and noble, grab a coffee and have my 2 year old play in the play area with toys. When our table was ready, we just walked back to the restaurant and was able to get into our sit and order. The server was really nice. I just ordered appetizers as I was full and he was not mean like some other servers that they look at you funny if you do that. Calamari there is okay better than most..."
Steven C.,"Walnut, CA",280,161,54,4.0,4/15/2011,"What more can I say, it's Cheesecake Factory. I came to this one because it was close to the Glendale Galleria. I would totally come to this one instead of the one in pasadena for two reasons... 1. plenty of parking 2. way more seats/tables. Service wasn't bad at all, our waiter was Max. Orders came quick, food tasted great, drinks were always full, the list goes on. Good work!"
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,3.0,9/3/2010,Food's good for corporate joint.  Can't complain about anything else except for the fact that it's the second time I've gone there with the kids and was seated at the bar.  I'm pretty old school and I don't think kids should be at the bar. Not cool so you get a 3 star.....
Eva I.,"San Gabriel, CA",471,471,3416,3.0,1/10/2011,"I have been wanting to try this place since forever. And I like it.  My favorite dishes of the meal would be Pasta Da Vinci and the Wild Mushroom Soup! Actually, the BBQ Ranch Salad and Pecan Crusted Catfish were decent too. (: Overall, a great experience and good food. $80 including tips and tax for 4 happy stomach (: Not bad. A little disappointed on their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Way too sweet and indulging. It's definitely meant to be shared with a party of 4 or more. There's no way one can eat this alone. One or two bite and your sugar level has reached the top!"
Derek J.,"Burbank, CA",23,63,2,4.0,7/30/2011,"Food is always yummy, service lacks due to over crowding. Be ready to waste half your night waiting for a table. Great menu!"
Ceez N.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,149,14,5.0,4/14/2013,"First time today, they sat me down within 15 minutes for it being a friday I'm surprised!, as for the food wow it was delicious! !! Big huge portions were pefect for my appetite,  the avacado eggrolls were off the fkn chain!!!!! I will definitely be back!!!! Very nice professional staff also!"
Jerji R.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,68,18,3.0,1/13/2013,"Always a good experience coming to this chain. No matter how many times I've came here, there's always something new to try. However I always have the usual staple.... Jambalaya, miso salmon, hibachi steak and steak diane, along with the honey wheat oats bread for starters.  Could never go wrong with those. I wouldn't get their steak though."
Beau L.,"Burbank, CA",10,39,1,3.0,2/13/2011,"Definitely go there for happy hour.  Mojitos are yumm. We just order the $5 appetizers. For myself, my babe, and our boy we get 3-4 appetizers and it makes for a good dinner. The dumplings are good. Chicken sliders are great. The buns are super yummm & nicely toasted to perfection (most of the time). It's not the most flavorful stuff I've ever eaten but ketchup or soy sauce go a long way for me and I don't mind. Parking is validated for 2hrs I think. Restrooms are pretty clean. There are a couple tv screens in the bar area so I can see some ESPN from wherever we sit (almost everywhere). The servers are hit or miss. Sometimes they're really nice & attentive and other times, not so much. The big plus for us is the water fountain and water show outside the restaurant. Our son could watch it all day if we would let him. If you wanna see the show, it's on once every hour on the hour (give or take 4mins)."
Margie M.,"Valencia, CA",96,38,,4.0,5/13/2010,"I've never EVER been to this restaurant. I've heard so many good and bad things about this place. So my co worker and I finally took me during lunch time and OMG. I am a fan of cheesecake. We got the Beer Battered Fish & Chips and The Smokehouse BBQ Burger. OMG, sooo delishhh.... The food was fabulous and the portions are huge The staff's are very friendly and very professional and always with a smile The ambiance was great The view of the fountain was beautiful Restrooms - cleaned The place got crowded by 1230. other than that this place is GREAT!!! would definitely come back again........."
Julian S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,12,9,4.0,6/24/2011,exelent!! lots of food. You better come very Hungry.
alli t.,"Torrance, CA",11,252,229,3.0,12/23/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is pretty much the same at each location, but this one didn't have the same experience. Maybe it was a busy holiday weekend, but I felt like we didn't have very much contact with the staff once we sat down. Also, we didn't want bread, but they didn't ask if we wanted any. We visited this one on a mid-afternoon weekend and it was really busy.  Thankfully the lunch sized portions are available until 4 pm or so. We ate the barbecue ranch chicken salad and chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich came with some lovely fries that were perfectly crisp and seasoned. They were the highlight of the meal for me.  We finished the meal with lemon raspberry cheesecake, one of my favorites b/c you can finish it in one sitting vs the chocolate ones that are too rich."
Lyn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,49,10,4.0,6/14/2011,Brought my parents here for their anniversary during lunch and it was a great experience. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The portions were huge and this was LUNCH only! I highly recommend coming here for any occassion. I also recommend the Factory Nachos.  I had them at another Cheesecake location and they weren't as good.
Stephen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,1103,2803,3.0,10/26/2008,"It's funny, I'm ok saying I quite like Denny's but I'm embarassed to say I came here tonight!? Anyway, it was a easy choice for out-of-town vegetarians and me on a week night work colleague outing. We got seated promptly in a comfy booth and I ordered the fish of the day cooked in spices. It was mahi mahi but was a bit bland and watery. The fries...well, you can't go wrong with French fries, right? The brocolli looked healthy, but lonely without a sauce to accompany it. Overall, an ok $25 dinner and shared dessert, but nothing to write home about...or may be Yelp about either :) At least my colleagues now know The Cheesecake Factory does more than just dessert!"
Angela O.,"Bakersfield, CA",39,18,33,1.0,7/16/2012,I must say I have dined at 10 different cheesecakes and Glendale is the worst experience I have ever had. Took my mom for lunch for her birthday and announced we are celebrating. The waitress not only forgot the birthday but didn't even ask if we want dessert. The food came out cold and it was Just an utter disappointment.
Kathy V.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",16,29,4,1.0,6/16/2012,"Disgusted!!!!  I've been to Cheesecake Factory before and never had any problems other than the wait.  I went there today and there was no wait, they sat us down right away.  We ordered the Lemon Herb Roast chicken, it comes with mash potatoes and carrots. So our food arrives and i started splitting it up for me and my bf and guess what!!! A fucken Pubic hair is in the carrots! Can you believe that??!!! I was so Disgusted!  I call the waiter over and she takes the plate and calls over one of the Managers. They both apologize and tell me they'll make another plate right away! I wasn't even hungry at that point but my bf still wanted to eat....  So our second plate comes and I inspected as much as I can. So my bf eats they kept checking on us making sure we were fine and they bring the bill over and come to find out they charged us twice!!! Wtf... The waitress apologizes and says she'll take it off, then comes back and they still charged for one!  I asked to talk to the Manager and she talks to him instead, they finally take  both off the price! But seriously the fact that I had to tell them to take it off the bill is annoying! Really? I shouldn't have to ask them to comp it, I could have caused a scene Or something! So pissed never going there again! Does anyone know if I can report them to the health dept. or something?"
