Laura T.,"Sierra Madre, CA",10,5,,4.0,7/30/2012,"I had bad service here: no drink refills, no clearing of dirty dishes, long wait for the bill, then given the wrong bill and a waiter that looked irritated at my requests for the bill and a question I had about validating my parking ticket. I complained to the manager on duty, Meagan, who covered the whole bill because she saw our table with the empty water glasses and the mess of dishes. She was awesome and I will be returning."
Hannah M.,"SUNLAND, CA",3,5,,4.0,9/20/2014,"Two friends and I went later in the evening on a Friday night so of course there was a wait but that is to be expected. Our waiter was very attentive, filled our glasses whenever they were low, and made sure we had everything we needed. Both my friends ordered 'Evelyn's Favorite Pasta' and were very happy with it. I ordered 'Buffalo Blasts' with a fruit bowl. The Buffalo Blasts were delicious and flavorful but my favorite was the fruit bowl! The fruit was fresh and they toss it in an amazing juice that just makes it! The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the wait but that just goes to show how great Cheesecake Factory is!"
Diana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,35,,3.0,6/4/2012,"i wasnt sure how to rate this place. I always feel iffy rating chain restraunts because they always change servers, they atmposphere changes day to day becuase the people who friquent these places are everyone from all walks of life and all age groups. So i cant rate them based on that. What i can say is that the food is always good,ive never complained. The service like i mentioned previosly always varies, ive never had a bad enough experience to remember.  Ive been coming to this location ever since they opened and also their sister location at the Grove. its good food, does get a bit noisy but they cant help that, its the costumers."
Amada H.,"Hawthorne, CA",110,18,6,2.0,3/9/2014,"First star goes to the wait time we had when we first walked in. It was busy, but we got seated within 10 minutes. When we were seated I noticed that a lot of the utensils had food on it. Whatever, that happens when dishes gets washed in dishwashers. We asked for water and lemons as well as bar drinks. We got our water rather quickly which is good, but no lemons. Our waiter passed us by at least five times without bringing us lemons. Finally the lemons came  and we ordered our dinner. When the food came it was excellent! That's where the second star comes! Delicious! Half way finishing the dinner, we wanted to order cheesecake. Where is the waiter again? We had to ask a guy in black clothing for the cheesecake menu. Fine. We order the cheesecakes. I ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake and my partner ordered the tiramisu cheesecake. We heard these were very delicious. A couple minutes later, the waiter comes back and says they are sold out of BOTH cheesecakes! How is that possible? It's the CHEESECAKE Factory! We didn't even order any other because chances are, it's sold out too. When I saw the reviews about this place I figured I'd check it out myself even though there wasn't very many good reviews. Looks like they were all spot on. The service sucks. Waiters were running around and talking in circles most of the time. Kudos to the cook, other than that I would not recommend this location."
Jenn K.,"Anaheim, CA",0,16,4,3.0,10/16/2014,"It's the usual cheesecake factory.  Weekends are going to be a long wait, but the food is very well worth it.  I always get the usual... Gumbo, Louisiana chicken past, chipotle chicken pasta, or Maui salad.  The bread!!! You can't hate em!!"
Susie L.,"PACOIMA, CA",49,6,12,4.0,1/19/2013,Waiter was a little soar but the avocado rolls are great!
Marianne P.,"Glendale, CA",17,25,,4.0,5/27/2010,"I average going to the Cheesecake Factory about 2 times a month, my most recent being last friday. You can never go wrong with cheesecake factory. They have a HUGE menu, and serve huge plates, so we always come home with a guaranteed meal for the next day. Service/servers is hit or miss- like any other place. They dont take reservations so have at least one person from your group sign up ahead of time to get you seated. High peak nights and weekends are BUSY so come early. Everything here is good. My usual order is wheat bread only, an appetizer, a pasta i can split with someone, and a strawberry shortcake. Every appetizer is good for whatever taste youre looking for. The Sliders are really good! (Add cheese!) For pastas- we love the shrimp bistro pasta- except that recent yahoo article had it being the WORST pasta in terms of calories to order- so we now get the garlic noodles. Still GOOD and im sure still calorie loaded. Oh well.   on a random day- i even tried the orange chicken and it was surprisingly GOOD! It tasted like fresh chicken with the orange chicken flavor, but without the oily bread shell of a typical chinese restaurants'- kinda PF Chang's Status where the chicken is more than the breaded batter.  Every time i have a family or friend get together, we eat at Cheesecake- everyone always comes out happy. Bonus: Come during happy hour. The appetizers and some items are 5 bucks when usually they're like 9 or 10 bucks. WORTH IT!"
Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,5.0,10/1/2010,"This location is now in the running to be my fave Cheesecake Factory Location (Sorry Brentwood!). The waiting area is by far the biggest I have seen for a CF.  Usually the crazy amounts of people that are usually waiting are crammed into small area and spill out to the exterior, but this was not necessary here as there was ample sitting and standing room. Our server, Alex (with the ponytail), was awesome and funny.  Made sure we were completely taken care of. Food is great, as with all CF in my opinion. Will most definitely be back!"
Deedee F.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,32,6,2.0,2/19/2012,"My husband I went there for a Valentine's Day lunch. We ordered our drinks from the bar, which were wonderful as usual. Then we ordered the Caesar salad & White pizza lunch special along with the Ahi Tartar and cheese sticks.  Shortly after we placed our order, our server returned to tell us the White pizza had been removed from the menu :( since they recently changed it. We asked to see the menu again and decided to order the Tomato, Basil & cheese pizza with no tomatoes and add spinach to 1/2 instead of basil. In essence, the white pizza!  In the mean time, our whole order was held up while the server asked if the kitchen could add the spinach. Once she found out the kitchen would add the spinach, it was time to order our second drink & finally our lunch. Our drinks arrived quickly, then tartar & cheese sticks came out then no more than 5 minutes later...so did our salad and pizza. We put aside the pizza since it was still really hot as we finished our appetizers. The ahi was fresh & yummy. The cheese sticks were hot & melted. Then we started in on the salad. The caesar dressing was pasty white with no black pepper or Parmesan cheese. It tasted like mayo!  The lettuce was super cold & wet. Really bad!!!  We put it aside to eat the pizza. It wasn't much better. I saw there was tomato seeds on the pizza but no tomato slices. I bit into a slice and could taste the tomato juice...YUCK!  Who ever made it, forgot about the tomatoes, put them on, baked it, removed the tomatoes, added more cheese, put it back in the oven to melt then put it out to be served!  Good thing I wasn't allergic to tomatoes but I can not stand them!!  The manager came over and apologized for the error and removed it from the bill.  I've never had an issue with the food at this particular location but I did this time. Too bad it was on Valentine's Day."
Veronica C.,"Escondido, CA",133,151,45,5.0,9/17/2012,"Most gorgeous location! I love how close it is to the garage & my favorite clothing store, H&M!"
Alen A.,"Glendale, CA",50,70,55,5.0,11/20/2010,"I got to go behind the scenes and into their kitchen!  Awesome restaurant, consistent food, and outstanding staff training and teamwork!"

Chris O.,"Glendale, CA",33,48,17,4.0,12/19/2012,"Great place for everything. Family, friends, workers, significant other..... Food is good, drinks are great."
Bianca M.,"Glendale, CA",13,137,25,3.0,11/8/2010,"I'm not the hugest fan of the Cheescake Factory at any of their locations.  I ordered their Clubhouse Salad off their Specials menu which apparently means ""let's go skimpy on all the toppings because the patron is paying slightly less than for a salad off our permanent menu.""  It was pretty boring.   Service was standard, highlight was the Cucumber Martini I had, very refreshing, I'd definitely recommend that."
David T.,"Burbank, CA",78,327,5,4.0,9/1/2010,"I really like Cheesecake Factory and now I'm glad that there is one close to me! I live in Burbank and before the closest one used to be either Sherman Oaks or Pasadena, but Glendale is SO much closer. Plus, it is in the Americana and just outside the restaurant is the big fountain with the pretty displays. I have been here a few times and so far everything has been great. The only problem I had here was when this place first opened, the waiter gave me the wrong order. However, the mistake was quickly corrected and I left full and happy. I always make sure to save room for cheesecake by eating only half of my meal, if even that much. I have always had to wait for a bit to be seated, but it has never been too terribly long. Plus, unlike some locations, this location has plenty of seating in the waiting area. This is a place that I frequently go to on my birthday, and while I have been sung to, so have many others on that day. Who knew that my birthday was so common? The fact that I heard a birthday song every 10 minutes should give you an idea how popular this place is! If you're in the mood for a gut-busting meal and if someone wants to take you out for your birthday or another occasion, you should suggest this place. Just plan a workout for the next day!"
Justine V.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",45,29,56,2.0,12/5/2010,"Went on a Friday night, expected it to be busy, but it took at least a good ten minutes before we had a waiter come over or even start us with drinks. Our waiter was Dusty, very friendly but we were all surprised at the fact that most of our empty dishes weren't taken away after we finished eating. In fact some of them were still there when we were eating desert, cheesecake of course. (Which was amazing.) So as far as the food goes, *at the time* it tasted good. I had a small dinner salad, no dressing, a personal cheese pizza, a water and a coke.  I ate nothing else that night besides the cheesecake. Went straight home around 9pm. And by 11pm, my stomach started acting up. *****And yup, I threw up.***** Food poisoned??? I also called them not only once, but twice to let them know what happened. They actually questioned me on what I ate the DAY BEFORE?!  Horrible customer service. I had to speak with 2 managers. Both of them who did not return my calls. All I wanted was to be reimbursed for my food or at least a slice of cheesecake. Jeeze. I really should have written a letter to corporate, but time has passed. Thanks Cheesecake Factory."
Vegan M.,"Sun Valley, CA",9,14,,5.0,12/18/2011,"Don't listen to what others say that give it less than 5 stars. Sign in, go get a bottle of wine from BevMo across the street. Order chicken billagio big enough to split, pay the $10 cork fee and viola. A cheap nice night out."
Amanda K.,"Glendale, CA",53,43,11,4.0,6/9/2010,"I love the atmosphere. I love that they give you two types of bread to eat as you wait for your meal. I love the diversity of the menu. And of course, I love the cheesecakes!  Only downsides? Well, it's almost always busy. They don't accept reservations. And it's a little on the pricey side."
Daisy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",317,193,540,4.0,8/7/2008,"I see a lot of bad reviews here, but Im going to review based on my experience. I came to this location twice (Americana cheesecake factory). So it was my birthday, and we came here around 11 at night. This place is beautiful. It is a really nice looking cheesecake factory. Our server was really nice. He gaved us some recommendations and we asked a few questions about the menu. The pulled pork sandwich is delicious! I know, it's hard to believe that a non bbq place has great pulled pork but I've been to a lot of BBQ spot and this is by far my favorite pulled pork sandwich. It comes with coleslaw and french fries. I got the Louisiana which is really good as well but I like it without the parmesan because I'm not a fan of cheese. Also their da vinci pasta isn't bad too. My next experience was a night out with my friend. The place was packed but I didn't care I wanted to try their salad. I ordered the Sante Fe chicken salad and my friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. DELICIOUS. The salad was huge! But the dressing was a little strong so I recommend asking them to put the dressing on the side so you can put as much as you want prior to your likings. Her sandwich was great too. The chicken was larger than the bread which was funny but the chicken was really good. Tender and moist while nice and crispy on the outside. Only bad side was they messed up on our bill. We wanted to split the bill say put 13 on my friends card and I will pay the difference with my cash. They rung up the whole thing on my friends card. It's fine I guess because our server felt really bad. anywhos, great experiences overall! O and our waiter gaved us the brown bread instead of the white which was great because I love the brown bread they have!"
Khalif G.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",21,3,,4.0,3/5/2013,Great place for a dinner date and open pretty late.   Ask the waitress for her recommendations if your indecisive like me!
