Wenders B.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,137,19,3.0,10/13/2012,I've been here about four or five times. I've tried different items; some good some not that great. I do love the cheesecake though. The restaurant smells weird. The waiters are always friendly.
Mary V.,"Phoenix, AZ",73,13,7,4.0,11/23/2011,"We decied to go to one of my favorite places for our manager holiday lunchoen.  Ive been to the Cheesecake factory several times and I am never dissapointed, the wait is always long - but that lets you know if people are willing to wait for the food then it must be good, and it is definitly worth the wait. The prices are very resonable and the selection of food on the menu is outstanding. The selection of cheese cake and other types of cakes/desserts is also outstanding! The service we had was not bad all though we waited a little longer than usual for our food  I have to say it was worth it."
Teresa K.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",84,11,2,4.0,2/15/2012,"Its a good place to eat, has lots of choices of food so everyone is happy. The lighting is darker so good for a romantic date night. Also the location is good because you can catch a movie next door after or just walk around the Americana. The only thing I did not like was the waiting. Took forever  to seat us and once we did get a place it took for ever to order, get our food etc.  Our waiter was very kind, just a long waiting process."
Martha H.,"Studio City, CA",35,71,5,4.0,8/24/2010,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. It's one of my favorite restaurants. This is a great location, though on packed nights they really should open up the other patio area. We waited for over an hour to get seated when the seating problem would have been easily solved by opening the other patio.  They don't take reservations which is understandable, but it would have been easier for parties of eight or more.  We had a GREAT server and our food came out quickly. A+ Cheesecake. Only docking stars for the weird seating plan."
Tyler B.,"MONTROSE, CA",0,7,,4.0,8/20/2013,The food is DELICIOUS (of course)! The service is pretty good. The prices are not my favorite! Over all I would recommend the place but maybe be warned if you are on a tight budget.
Dominguez D.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,9,,5.0,2/5/2013,"I personally love the Cheesecake Factory in general, but I have to say this one is my favorite so far. I have a 4 yr old and 2 yr old who love trains and being this CCF is at the Americana @ Brand where they have a free trolley ride and water show, it is the perfect place for my little family. They even have a car-wash in the parking structure! We didn't get our car washed, so I'm not sure how much they charge, but I'm all for multitasking and getting your car washed while you spend fun time w/ the family seems like a great idea to me.  So we signed up for the table w/ the hostess then went out and saw a water show they have right outside. After that we rode the trolley around the Americana (Free), which my girls loved. We walked around a little more and then it was time to eat. By then the kids were more than willing to sit still and my husband and I were able to enjoy our dinner in peace :) And when we left, we walked out right in time for the last water show of the night :)"
Brenda S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",42,319,125,4.0,8/4/2012,Good location.  Sitting outside in patio is relaxing
Angie C.,"Mountain View, CA",43,152,1,4.0,7/4/2012,"The only reason I can't give this place five stars is that the kitchen kept messing up my friend's dish. We loved the host and our server, who were laughing and joking with us from start to finish. Our table was dirty when we first got there, and the host quickly got someone to wipe it and the booth down, even going so far as to replace all the silverware/napkins/dishes before we sat down. The food was delicious once we all had our dishes, and our server had just the right touch of attitude to keep us enjoying ourselves. Good job, guys!"
Milagros C.,"Azusa, CA",26,3,,4.0,6/14/2013,"The cheese cake factory the tipical restaurant! It's so nice, great food, great cheesecakes haha, and great service, the only problem is the wait, but it's obvios that it's beacuase of the amount of people they get."
Fred R.,"Stockton, CA",22,47,2,4.0,12/31/2009,"Went on Monday night, very crowded. Wait was about what they said it would be. Food was good, consistent with other Cheesecake Factories I've been to. Service was good, not great. Vanilla bean cheesecake is out of this world as always."
Barbara S.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",0,16,,1.0,11/8/2013,A new low for the Cheesecake Factory. Now they want your cell phone number to alert you when your seating is ready. What an invasion of privacy.  What happened to just using the electronic hand-held device that they have been using?
Cat C.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,44,23,2.0,12/30/2012,Great food.....soso service.......
Shorty P.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,204,1,4.0,8/19/2009,"I decided to give it a 4 because of the awesome service we got. I read some other yelp reviews where they had really bad experiences, but our waiter was really good. He was very polite, friendly, and attentive. He always seemed to come just at the right time, right before we even realized we needed refills. When he went on a break, he let us know ahead of time and introduced the ""relief waiter"" to us. By the way, we came on a Tuesday evening. My friend got the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad ($13.95), and judging by the way she devoured it, I think it was good. She kept raving about it. She washed it down with a Diet Coke ($2.95). I had the Strawberry Lemonade ($4.50) which accompanied my Grilled Fresh Mahi Mahi ($19.95). This normally comes with mashed potatoes and choice of vegetable, but I requested two vegetable sides instead (steamed broccoli and green beans). It was good as far as grilled fish with no sauce/dressing goes (it came with tartar sauce, but I didn't use it). For dessert, we shared the AMAZING red velvet cheesecake ($7.50). It was pretty close to perfect as cheesecakes come. I wasn't aware of the new law that restaurants have to be upfront with the nutritional information of their meals, but the waiter gave us a booklet with all the nutritional info along with our menus. My friend refused to look at it because she didn't want her meal ruined. I was planning on ordering something else (particularly the combo of shrimp scampi and grilled salmon), but when I saw how many calories and grams of salt it had...oh. my. gawd. It was pretty scary. And that was how I ended up with the mahi mahi with steamed vegetables. I didn't REALLY want it, but I didn't want to die of a heart attack either. Seriously, after going through the nutritional info, I doubt I'll be coming back anytime soon. On the plus side, eating outdoors was great because we got a nice view of the water fountain in the middle of the Americana. And for mid-August, it sure got cold by 7 pm. The heat lamps they turned on were necessary."
Kat C.,"Orange County, CA",70,42,73,3.0,1/7/2010,"There were people coming into Chessecake Factory every few minutes, but the wait was not long... about 10 minutes. The host was extremely professional, polite, and helpful for our big group.  Our server however, possessed such plain service. Not good nor bad, just plain. She brought our drinks, orders, then our check. She never checked on our side of the table to see if we were okay, nor did she bring refills. Not once did I see her smile or say you're welcome.  Bathrooms are small for such a big restaurant with capacity 500+ so you'll be elbowing other women around the sink area. A friend and I split a steak diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes, which was good the last time I tried it. But this time it didn't hit the spot. It might have been because of the cold temperature of the food. Parking can be validated at the hosts' desk."
Breanna H.,"Alhambra, CA",48,51,4,1.0,9/20/2011,"Don't try to make a reservation... they don't accept them, I THINK, but had trouble telling because the people I spoke to on the phone were NOT helpful.  You'd expect at least some common courtesy, but no."
Alexandria S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,2.0,1/14/2014,"I usually enjoy my food at this restaurant chain but my last visit at this specific location was bad. We came here during the late afternoon, wait wasn't crazy but the host kept skipping people and it wasn't until a few people complained that she made sure they were seated next. Our waitress was terrible! She forgot to bring bread, forgot an order, and never asked to refill our drinks. I understand that it gets busy and sometimes they're under a lot of pressure but her attitude definitely didn't help the situation. When we asked for what she forgot she looked annoyed. Overall, the food was good but the service needs a lot of work."
Vivian K.,"Glendale, CA",43,357,,3.0,4/5/2014,"I actually like this place... though I only ever wind up here on someone else's suggestion.  The menu selection is quite large, so pretty much anyone can find something on it they like.  Salads are good, and portion sizes are VERY American... really 2-3 meals for the price of one.  Service wasn't great, though food arrived on time, and all together as requested.  I didn't love that they brought out my dressings (to sit in the hot sun) a half hour before my food arrived.  Also didn't love that I had to press my waiter to find out what a side of shrimp would cost.  He let me know that they offer either large or small shrimp, and I wanted to know the cost of each.  His reply was ""I assume the larger ones cost more""... and tried to make me feel stupid for asking.  No likey.  He did eventually check the details: same price (4 large for $5 is what I ordered).  Later, when we asked for some extra lemon wedges for our water... he wanted to know how many.  Awkward, nickel-and-dimey vibe, given the lackadaisical attitude about my nickels and dimes!"
Ragnar The Viking C.,"Glendale, CA",3,81,,3.0,11/16/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a place that has greatness and sadness. I gave it 3 stars, but really, it has 1 star attributes and 5 star attributes... the good... good side of Cheesecake Factory is that the food is always consistently made. I've never been to any Cheesecake Factory and ordered the same meal but had it done well one time and poorly another. It's not to say it's excellent food. It's above average... But you always get consistency.  the good... they have just a MASSIVE menu! I don't think there is another restaurant (except for Denny's) that has a menu as humungous as Cheesecake's. There are definitely a lot of choices... the bad... It isn't worth standing in line for 1 hour to get a seat. Now, if you go at the right times, such as 1 to 3 pm, you'll be ok. You'll sit almost immediately. But I've been to Cheesecake many times in the evening and the wait has been absolutely bonkers... Like 1 hour or 1 1/2 hour. Forget it... I don't care if German Nazi Orgy is served on the menu. I'm not waiting 1 hour for food! the bad... Even though there is a lot on the menu, it's fairly simplistic food and sometimes quite boring..."
Casey G.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,10,,2.0,8/4/2012,"My rating for this restaurant is based almost completely on the gluten free options. The location was wonderful!!  We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful evening.  There are heat lamps that kept the temperature perfect, and the view of the fountain was exactly what we wanted on a bustling Friday night.  The service was very nice!  Very friendly.  She was a little busy and we were a tad neglected, but it was fine.  I asked if they had gluten free options and they said they didn't.  The server tried to help weed through the HUGE menu.  I wasn't confident the server REALLY knew what was gluten free, so I stuck with a safe Vegetable Salad.  The salad came out completely dry.  A bowl full of mostly lettuce and some cut veggies.  I ate a few bites and finally asked if there was a gluten free dressing.  The guy I asked didn't seem to know what I was talking about so just I asked for oil and vinegar.  I am not a picky eater so I did eat it, but I could have made a tastier salad myself for a lot less.   My friend had a chicken dish (non-gluten free) and was very happy with the food.  FYI, there are no gluten free dessert options at all, not even a bowl of fruit. It was a fun night because of the atmosphere and the company, but all in all I was disappointed with the food.  I would think a large chain like Cheesecake Factory should have at least a couple of yummy options for gluten free meals.  Just a suggestion.  For now I will stick with Yardhouse, or PF Chang's if I desire chain restaurant food.... they love us gluten free folks and treat us very well."
Moon Diane K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",100,152,53,4.0,5/12/2012,I do enjoy their food and I love their Banana Cheesecake!  One thing I hate here is the wait!!!!!
