Serouj A.,"Covina, CA",1,13,,1.0,8/20/2015,"Im a huge cheesecake fan to begin with. My fiance and i always dine at cheesecake. I came in to the americana location with a group of 11 people. I was told it would be a 40 minute wait, we were all o.k with that. We sat outside in the cold weather for 40 minutes then went inside to see what the status of our table was. I was told it would be another 10 minute wait equalling it to 50 minutes. Ten minutes turned into 25 minutes and we still did not get called in. It took us close to ten minutes to be greeted by a server. The manager Sarah, i personally do not believe deserves to be the restaurant manager. She was not friendly at all and did not give any importance to us. After we had waited 50 minutes to be seated, she told us she would go check on the status of the table and was gone for a good ten minutes. The front end representatives were on top of their work more than the manager herself. After going to the front couple of times, we were finally seated. After we sat down, sarah, the manager tried to move us around so she can fit another party of 8. Very unprofessional and rude. From my knowledge a manager should be the leader of the team and lead by example. She is a very bad example to her employees. Upper management should re-evaluate the manager of the store and choose a better person to serve its clients.  I know for a fact after today i will defenitely not give my business to this company. I am truly dissapointed and felt disrespected by the staff."
Renee D.,"Los Angeles, CA",144,101,47,3.0,5/1/2012,"Cheese Cake Factory is one of those restaurant chains I don't want to like. It's always packed, the portions are enormous,  which are usually a turn off. However, we were invited to join friends and honestly, aside from it being packed, loud and Über family friendly, it was a good experience.   Our service was great.  I'm always impressed when a server can take an order for 4 with requests, and not write it down.... everything thing came with all the specifics.  Amazing.   The food was very good. I had the Ahi salad, dressing on the side, my honey had the burger, deliciousness with a grilled onion.  We unwittingly are able to save room for cheese cake.  Our piggy selves ordered 3 and shared and took the rest home. Red Velvet,  just because we had too.... Enjoyable.  Classic Cheese Cake- really great.   Key Lime, nice and tart.      I can see why it's packed.  The food was good. Servers were great, whatever screening/training they do, bravo!     Note to Cheesecake Factory:  I think it would be AWESOME if  a cheese cake sampler plate was added.    small bites so diners could have a taste of several varieties.  Maybe offer a selection of 4 that are about the size of a mini muffin or cup cake.  Diners would pay the same price for less cheese cake for the variety of having a small bite of several items.     The sampler plate could have the classic original cheese as a staple, then rotate the specials on a monthly basis.  This would keep people intrigued and could be a hot seller..... not that you need any more business.  Well done!"
Danielle G.,"Valencia, CA",446,662,275,1.0,7/29/2009,"**Reviewing their service Gotta love their cheesecakes right? If you'd give me the right order, then maybe I would! My brother and I came here for lunch. Service was fine. Our waitress was friendly in an ""okay why are you still staring at me and smiling, just go do your job"" kinda way. Everything was fine until it was time to order desert. I told my brother he could pick the two cheesecakes. He decided on the choc. chip cookie dough one and the other was a brownie sundae, or something like that. We get our order and I dig into what was supposed to be the choc. chip cookie dough one. Why does it taste like peanut butter? I call the waitress over and ask if my cheesecake has peanut butter in it. She says yea it's the choc. chip peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake. I said, that's not what we ordered, we wanted it without peanut butter. She told us that's how it comes. So I pointed out that my bro and I were sharing and he is allergic to peanuts. All she has to offer is an I'm sorry. Okay, this didn't make sense to me at all because why would someone who is allergic to peanuts order something with peanut butter. We checked the menu as we left, we ordered correctly and she fudged it up. She could have done a number of things to redeem herself like offer us another slice or admit that she was wrong. It's not my fault you don't know your own menu. We even pointed at it on the menu when you took our order. But nooooo.  Well that's my story. Unfortunately for the Cheesecake Factory, they have some horrible employees. Otherwise, they would have gotten about a 3.5 star rating. Try again next time!"
Maggie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",213,192,1,3.0,8/20/2009,"O.K.; I'm a little...HUMILIATED...by how much I tried but... Here's a brief breakdown of what I thought...(scale is five stars like Yelp)...

My head is low, believe me. Service was good.  Bathroom was clean.  We got served quickly.  On balance a good experience."
Holan N.,"Honolulu, HI",319,15,9,4.0,8/14/2010,"Cheesecake Factory. Always nice. Whether your in the Venetian Hotel in Vegas or Marina Del Ray (my mother's favorite one), expect to have great food with great atmosphere.  I always look forward to The Cheesecake Factory on my west coast trips because The Cheesecake Factory (opened 2003) in Honolulu, Hawaii does not feel the same way. This is my first time to the Glendale's location. I must say the restaurant and everything about the Americana is different. Having just finished a day with my family at Universal studios, it was great to leave the crowded areas to a nice sit down place in a district that is relaxing and seemingly away from the touristy areas (I ate at the one near Disneyland later that week and though food was the same, it felt different). Found Glendale's CF thanks to the GPS. The service was adequate. The food and the ambiance was well worth it and made me feel at peace which was what I was going for when I set out on vacation. I thought Avocado Eggrolls  was a peculiar combination. I would not considered ordering it until I asked for the waiter to suggest an appetizer. Avocado Eggrolls is different and I was surprised. It was very good. A taste I have not experienced before! I like different as eating out should be an adventure at times. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory is a name that I trust whenever I'm on vacation. Word of caution, do not expect the same type of atmosphere in Honolulu, Hawaii."
Josie S.,"Long Beach, CA",21,37,9,4.0,5/10/2012,Absolutely love it good price for great food. I just detest the service
Ingrid M.,"Glendale, CA",0,23,,1.0,12/15/2013,"After waiting almost 2 hrs. for a table. My husband and I thought we'd be safe ordering a sandwich, Pit Beef Sandwich. Are food took sometime, when it arrived I noticed my husband struggling with the meat. The bread on my sandwich was scraping the top of my mouth. I asked our kind waiter to take the sandwich back as they were not edible. The second time the bread was right, but my husband was still struggling with his meat. My meat was raw, not cooked. It was disgusting. If I weren't so tired I would have taken it back to the Kitchen and cooked one myself.  We thought a piece of Cheesecake would make it all better, but I was disappointed. They were tasteless, and old tasting. I looked around and wondered why were there so many people waiting to get in. Obviously not for the food.  The Manager came out and apologized. He gave us credit for one sandwich and a piece of Cheesecake Classy! I would have not charged the customer a penny, and I would have given  a complimentary gift card for a cheesecake. You get one chance to make it right!. I will not be eating at the Cheesecake factory again. There are many other Restaurants nearby that don't require such a wait, and way better food."
Drew T.,"Agoura Hills, CA",50,3,,1.0,1/7/2012,"You can't make a reservation at this restaurant.  That is a HUGE mistake when it comes to customer service.  If this chain was run with half a brian, someone would realize that would leave for a long line out the door and less people to return due to them wanting to deal with standing in line.  The whole concept of ""since I have to wait for it, it must be worth it"" is quickly winding out with technology my friends.  Click here, click there...now, now, and thank you.   Customer service, welcome to the new generation, The Cheesecake Factory."
Priscilla G.,"Azusa, CA",32,16,3,4.0,5/20/2012,"I love Cheesecske Factory! I ordered the Baja Chicken tacos which tasted a little different then what I remember but I'd still recommend them to anyone unsure of what to order. My friend got a pepperoni pizza and a Blue Moon, while I sipped on my delicious Sangria. I love Cheesecake Factory and have never ordered anything of the menu which I didn't absolutely love!!!"
Abigail L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,49,,5.0,5/5/2014,"Always delicious food and wonderful service. Their gluten free menu is SO helpful as well. This is my favorite place for a nice date! A little pricey, but huge portions and wonderful atmosphere."
Matt W.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,510,,3.0,6/25/2012,"I know CF's are always busy, but this must be one of their busiest locations. It's unbelieveable how busy they are!! They are definitely NOT shy of pouring a strong drink at this location!! The best place to sit is in the bar so you can watch the water show outside the windows behind the bar. Bar area is large and comfortable as well.  Service at the bar and by the wait staff is very good. I don't feel like they pressure people to order lots of extras like most chain restaurants do... The food itself is a 3. It always looks well presented, but we all know this isn't the highest quality stuff. It's just big hunks and piles of food. I have to say, the spinach and artichoke dip is pretty decent, though. The rest of the food was fine but nothing specially. It looks more like a decoration than something to eat.  One friend had some kind of ""Asian"" salad (I'm betting they don't have a salad this large or with this concoction of items anywhere in Asia) and it had a ridiculous amount of these noodles that were really cool looking- white, long twisty/wispy noodles. They have a simple almost non-descript flavor and it must make up 30% of this salad.  You get some bites from the salad that contain only this strange textured noodle. It's just too overwhelming. While it's a cool decoration item, it isn't good as the main part of the salad. I guess we all know that CF is more about the pomp and circumstance and less about high quality food. Chicken tenders were pretty good (but let's be real- they're chicken tenders). The mashed potatoes served with them was an enormous pile of flavorless blah. Maybe they're boxed potatoes (I'm assuming most of their food comes in frozen like Olive Garden, but maybe not?), but they could still flavor them. The corn succotash tasted like the corn had been frozen and unfrozen 6 times. It had literally 0 flavor. It was bad. The group had fun and it's one of those places to come once in a GREAT while or for drinks and maybe an appetizer in the bar. But let's be real, the food is about show not about quality or flavor."
Anosha S.,"San Jose, CA",20,209,12,5.0,2/21/2010,"One of my favorite places to eat for lunch or dinner. My boo and I came here the other day. I had the Santa Fe salad. OMG sooo good. The lunch portion was huge, I actually thought it was the dinner. So it's prefect for sharing. My boo got the fish tacos which were also good. But not as good as my salad, lol.  In the past I've gotten the 4 cheese pasta...it's very rich and great as leftovers.  I am also in love with their small plates and snacks. A great place to go out for drinks and appetizers on any night : )"
markee s.,"Oxnard, CA",19,24,16,5.0,6/4/2012,Hibachi steak is my new Fave! Number 2 is the shrimp gumbo!
Alex Lane R.,"Glendale, CA",168,21,2,4.0,8/29/2011,"i don't ever go out to eat here during ""normal"" hours, but it's my new favorite happy hour spot! you absolutely cannot beat the $5 menu deals- it's seriously so much food, i ALWAYS leave with leftovers (and i can pack it away...).  i recommend the Sweet Corn Cake Tamales, Avocado Eggrolls, and Shrimp Summer Rolls. DELICIOUS! took a minute to get some service, but when we finally did, it was excellent :) i also recommend going early (happy hour is from 4-6pm) because the bar area fills up quick."
L T.,"Northridge, CA",144,34,118,4.0,6/7/2009,"I heart Cheesecake Factory! But I never seem to venture off and try something new from the usual 2-3 dishes I rotate from. I love the Shepherd's Pie with ground beef, mushrooms, peas, carrots, zucchini and onions in a yummy gravy topped off with mashed potatoes.  This last time, I for the Louisiana Chicken Pasta-it was mmm mmm good! Breaded and seasoned chicken breasts with red and yellow peppers, red onions, and mushrooms in a mild cajun sauce on a bed of farfalle pasta.  My friend had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta that looked equally good. For dessert (heck, you are at Cheesecake-you HAVE to save for dessert!) my friend had the dulce de leche caramel.  It was light and delish all around!  I had the chocolate raspberry truffle cuz I wanted one with chocolate ganache.  It sure did not disappoint. This is a really nice location to take a date, especially if you sit out on the patio overlooking the water fountain that dances to music every 15min or 1/2 hr.  Service was prompt and pleasant for a Thursday night."
Ameera D.,"San Francisco, CA",101,117,390,5.0,1/24/2012,"Love this place. Location is romantic and food is good too! I love the skinny menu. Usually a wait, but always worth it."
Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,5.0,7/20/2011,"I usually order from Cheesecake during my lunch time since I do not have  many options at the Americana. Yes there are a whole bunch of restaurants/eateries at the Americana, but I have gotten tired of their food after working there for over three years. Cheesecake, and Foxy's (across the street from Barnes and Noble), have never left me disappointed. The wait staff is amazing at accommodating one hour lunches. If I am meeting friends for lunch, I always let our waiter know about my time crunch and they manage to get my food out quicker. The bakery is also very helpful when I call in to place an order. Even at their most crazy of times, they have never messed up my order. They have though, forgotten to put in utensils a few times. I would be frustrated at first but then managed to figure out a way to eat my meal since walking back to Cheesecake was out of the question. On to the food... Avocado Eggrolls =D..the green sauce is amazing. I always ask for extra dressing and ranch to dip my french fries in it. The calamari is also delicious. I love both the cocktail sauce and the tartar sauce that comes with it. For salads, I would recommend the ""something"" cashew chicken..and the chinese chicken salad. I have tried others and they have all been very tasty. For dinner I usually get the Herb Crusted Fillet Salmon with steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes. Their potatoes are amazing!! The only problem is that I can't really move after consuming all that greatness. For a quick lunch, I have ordered their Chicken Avocado Sandwich. Also very tasty and it comes with an order of fries. Everything tastes amazing at the Cheesecake Factory. I can't say I have tried the entire menu but I have gone through a whole chunk of it and have always enjoyed my meal. Their pizzas are also tasty, along with their alcoholic beverages. Try the Factory Beach Belini..yummm!!  And before I forget...It is Cheesecake so you have to try their cheesecake, duhh! Tiramisu cheesecake. Absolute amazingness to the umpteenth power. That is alll."
Ronika J.,"Glendale, CA",22,10,,5.0,7/2/2012,"LOVE this place. BF took me here for our first date, and have to say, its an amazing place to take someone for the first time. the vibe is great and the people are nice, especially this location. i never get tired of this restaurant. food and drinks are always good!"
Rating You H.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,51,5,5.0,2/10/2012,Had a fantastic meal and waitress! shout out to Corie B.!! I came in to have a meal by myself and Corie gave me the perfect amount of privacy with out forgetting about me she was very on top of my water and other service needs that were necessary! She was very sweet and was very accommodating when I couldn't decide on a wine she was honest and told me she wasn't sure exactly which type of wine was the best fit for what I was describing so she quickly went to the bartender and she came back with exactly the taste I was looking for! I felt a bit awkward going to dinner alone but this was a great experience! Thank you thank you thank you!! I hope next time I come I will experience the same :D
Mona S.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,28,7,3.0,3/6/2015,long long waits. was here to celebrate a bday. food was good. the famous chicken. even mash potatoes were tasty.
