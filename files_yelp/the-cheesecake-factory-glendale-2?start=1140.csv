Sabee S.,"Fullerton, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/9/2015,typical busy chain restaurant that has good service
Ryan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,46,,5.0,12/9/2011,The food is great and so is the service.  I love a sense of consistency with both food and service and this place is the best.  I am not sure what their secret is but I love going here and will remain a loyal customer.  Yum!
Anastacia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,132,10,4.0,4/9/2012,I loveee the Cheesecake Factory but dinner last night was a little unsatisfying. I ordered a turkey burger from their Skinnylicious Menu. The burger came with a fresh green salad which was kinda bitter. It probably had cheap greens in it or something and it tasted pretty weird because of it. I didn't want to exchange it because the wait was a little longer anyway (it was Easter so justified).  I still like the Cheesecake Factory and would go there again. Soon.  Hope they fix their salads.
Patrick R.,"Stratford, CT",169,551,2103,4.0,2/27/2009,"A friend of mine and I ended up at The Cheesecake Factory, for no reason in particular, we just ended up there. The place is big and loud and dark as it is always in TCCF. We had to wait for 15min. unless we did not mind to sit outside. Heck no! Outside it is dark and loud too, so what is the difference?................15min, exactly you made my point! We had to wait for a while for our orders, it was a bussy night and next to us, a couple sat down with a child that could make SOME NOICE! I got kids too, so I did not care that much about it, but it was LOUD! We got our orders; I got the White Chocolate Raspberry Latte and was thinking about a Cheesecake, but went for the soup of the day (some Mexican soup) which was allright.  I come to the understanding that if the food is okay, the service is allright and the company your in is great! The whole experience overall not that bad is after all. So this time I am generous not because of TCCF, but because of the good time I had, so 4 stars. Yay, I'm a fan of The Cheesecake Factory when I am in great company."
Curtis L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,23,,4.0,5/28/2012,"Don't kid yourself and think that Cheesecake Factory is some 5 star restaurant. It's not high class. BUT its a great setting if you want delicious food and a grandiose atmosphere.  There's pretty much something for everyone here. The menu is so big it has page numbers for gods sake!  The PASTA DA VINCI is good. Has a bit of a stroganoff taste if you're into that.  The CHICKEN COSTOLETTA is incredibly tasty and so is the MEATLOAF SANDWICH.  The KALE APPETIZER SALAD is huge with healthy little bits thrown in like cranberries and nuts.  BUFFALO BLASTS are a greasy and delicious appetizer. It's shredded chicken in buffalo sauce and cheese that's stuffed into fried wontons. Yum! The PECAN CRUSTED CATFISH was a bit of a letdown though. It wasn't gross, just kinda bland.  AHI TUNA SALAD is a great salad choice too. It comes with a wasabi vinaigrette dressing too.  We've never had a problem with the staff at this location. The waiters are always super helpful and attentive."
Will G.,"T & W, United Kingdom",4,31,1,4.0,5/20/2012,Great service and super menu. Never made the cheesecake selection yet due to overload on appetisers and the mains :)
Mark K.,"Burbank, CA",250,11,4,4.0,8/31/2011,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory at the Americana. My profile doesn't show it but I was here four times in one week and I do go there for late night snacks. The portions are HUGE HUGE HUGE as everyone knows, and I can never finish them, but they satisfy me (and to me being satisfied is where I find value in a meal).  On my most recent visit I asked the waitress to recommend a burger to me and she told me to have the Green Chile Cheeseburger (it's kind of Mexican themed with tortilla chips and spicy green jalepeños). It was fricken delicious. I don't think I have ever enjoyed a burger so much, but sadly I was too full to enjoy the fries to the full extent, I recall them as yummy though. I'd recommend it for sure! Also the Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake. I hate cheesecake (and yet I still go so much). I decided to give it a try (keep in mind I haven't put cheesecake to my lips in over 12 years). IT WAS SO GOOD. Seriously, I didn't know what I was missing. Yeah, I love cheesecake now. Oh, and you have to get a Raspberry Lemonade. Delicious. Obviously, I'd go back. The service is always great and the free bread is a plus, especially the brown bread. oh yes, the brown bread. Other things I'd recommend from past visits: Ahi Tartare, The Club, Pizza/Salad Lunch Combo, Avocado Eggrolls, and Pulled Pork Sandwich. OM NOM. This location also tends to have shorter wait times than other Factories in the chain.  Happy Dining!"
Erica H.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,352,62,4.0,2/2/2010,"I used to work for the Cheese, at a different location. I can say I've been to a handful of locations, and I would honestly put Glendale near the top when it comes to the steps of service. I have never had bad service at this location. I would ask though why their bathrooms are so small, especially because this is the busiest location  of all of them in the US.  For food options, it's endless. If you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory, I'd highly reccommend it. Especially for bigger parties. There's always something for everyone.  My suggestions are to start with the Avocado Eggrolls and the TexMex Rolls. Order a pasta dish, a steak dish, and a salad for the table. Share all the plates. Then finish off with coffee from the coffee bar and a mudpie sundae and a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake. You won't go wrong. Promise!"
Silviya K.,"Glendale, CA",5,76,15,1.0,5/25/2009,"For the prices I pay at Cheesecake Factory, I expect to get great service.  What we got today was far from it.  We asked for bread twice and finally got it with our meal.  We asked for refills for our drinks and ended up refilling them ourselves since the refill station happened to be located behind us.  Our fries were cold with our burger.  And the spicy crispy chicken sandwich had no flavor unless you covered it with the blue cheese dressing.   After all that, we waited 10 minuted for the waitress to come back to charge our credit card for the bill.  I ended up taking the bill to the manager to pay.  He was nice enough to take one of the entrees off of the bill, but it didn't make up for the terrible service."
Nouran M.,"Glendale, CA",6,49,1,1.0,6/16/2013,"Tables and menus are greasy and utensils are not always clean. Was called, ""sister"" by our waiter yesterday (the whole time I was there!) and he even tapped on my shoulder once or twice- I swear, I was about to slap the man! Unprofessional staff (not all of course) and dirty environment. Simply put, I would not recommend this cheesecake factory."
sarine b.,"Valley Village, Los Angeles, CA",12,15,,2.0,1/22/2009,"I never thought I'd complain about this place. after all, we all love the delicious comfort food in super sized portions served at all cheesecake factories.  Unfortunately, this particular location sucks. we sat at the bar and received the worst service ever. rude rude rude wait staff. The one good thing that came out of the bad service is the money I saved by tipping poorly.  Cheesecake, I'm mad at you!"
Jenn C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",509,659,640,2.0,3/29/2011,"the food was good the service was terrible.  We all ordered water and when our server said ""2 waters and a hot water"" we thought he was kidding, because my brother and I have had waiters say super obvious mistakes as a joke, but end up bringing the right food.  This guy, not so much.  He actually brought my brother a hot water and he was never around (trust me.. Cheesecake Factory has food runners and bussers so this guy was NEVER around) and whenever I needed something like.. a box... and the check... we could not flag him down!! And its just like.. wtf is going on through your head?? I ordered a slice of cheesecake to-go and he comes with the bag and instead of dropping our cheesecake first which would take about... 5 seconds, he checks on his other tables who aren't finished eating yet, with the to-go bag in his hands.  He just looked so awkward and omg.. it was terrible service, and I'm pretty forgiving in that department of customer service.. but this was unacceptable.  This guy was just not paying attention and he was just an air-head.  It literally took us over 5 minutes to get the bill, and it wasn't busy.  And even if it WAS busy, he was not.  He walks like he had nothing to do and he never checked up on us, but he was definitely spending a lot of time hitting on another waitress."
Mae T.,"South Pasadena, CA",8,41,4,3.0,12/29/2009,"I don't know what it is about the Cheesecake Factory (in general) that keeps me coming back even though I know it'll be the most crowded restaurant of the evening and the average wait time to be seated is at least 40 minutes to 1 hour; but, nevertheless, I came back, this time, to the Americana in Glendale location.  The food is standard. It's the same as with other Cheesecake Factories, so there's nothing on this menu that stands out from the rest. I will say; though, that Avocado Egg Rolls are an all time fave...YUMMY!! I had the Farfalle Chicken & Roasted Garlic. It was tasty, and the portions were HUGE, so needless to say, there were lots left over. The service is OK. It was so crowded inside, that the hostesses didn't really greet anyone walking in, and quickly asked for names, how many were in the party, gave out pagers, told them their wait times and along they went. On the other hand, the bar tender was quick to make our drinks, and didn't water down our drinks either so that made our wait just a tad more comfortable. Our server was also really nice. She checked back a few times to make sure we were still doing ok. OK, so I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory for the humongous portions. Come for dinner...have enough for lunch the next day. Most of all, I keep coming back for the consistency. No matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to, you always know what you're getting, and, so far, the service also seems to be consistent. I have yet to receive bad service."
Joyce T.,"Glendale, CA",71,91,,1.0,10/3/2009,"No. Don't. Turn your car around and go to Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena or Sherman Oaks. I've eaten here on different occasions and only once has it been a good experience. I don't often give out 1 star, but this place deserves it. I don't understand how one dish from a restaurant chain can taste so different between locations. Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dish is the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad. When I get it at the Sherman Oaks CF, the tuna is always a fresh pink with a nice sear and well-plated salad. The tuna I got last at Glendale CF was almost a gray color with plenty of tendon to chew through. If I'm consuming raw fish, I don't want it to be the color of the old laces on my shoe. On top of it all the there was salad in my dipping sauce. WHY DO YOU SEND OUT A PLATE WITH RANDOM SALAD IN THE SIDE SAUCE??? When you're spending $20+ dinner, tip, parking... you're better off going to another location for the quality. The host/wait staff have always been good and accommodating - no complaints there. If you're looking for good eats at the Americana, you're better off going to Granville Cafe on Brand (check out my review for Glendale Granville Cafe on my profile)."
Rosemary D.,"Glendale, CA",0,18,7,4.0,8/20/2012,"This review is purely on their customer service.  My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant and was greeted by our friendly waiter. He was very helpful, patient, and attentive. An overall nice guy.  But the thing that really made me write this review was, I had forgotten my phone in the bathroom, and either some customer or employee gave it to the manager. I called and they had my phone the next day and were willing to give it to me while they were still closed.  We've almost always been satisfied with this place. We will definitely come back."
Anh H.,"Burbank, CA",12,36,5,2.0,12/12/2008,"So I'm not going to write a review about the food so much just because it's the Cheesecake Factory, and if you've eaten at one then you already know what the food is like. Although I do have to say that the sheer size of the menu is ridiculous because I can never decide what to get.  Anyways...I had a business lunch here today with some colleagues and vendors. First of all we had a reservation at 1pm and were there 10min early. We checked in with the desk and they rudely told us that if the entire party was not there at 1pm on the dot we would lose our reservation. Suffice it to say, we were all there on time and 15min later when asking if our table was ready yet, they informed us that they were waiting for another party to leave before seating us. Another 15min roll by and our table is still not ready and for some reason they don't think to find another open table for us. So we speak to a manager who ends up seating us in the bar area which is fine at this point since we're all starving.  So we sit down and wait another 20min before the manager brings us spinach dip and avocado eggroll appetizers on the house and tells us our drink orders will be coming soon. To which we reply that no one has come to take our drink orders.  After this point, service did get much better. Most likely because the manager made it a point to assign one of their best servers to us and frequently checked if everything was alright. It wasn't a horrible experience but since it's a huge chain, if I was going to go to Cheesecake Factory, I'd try another location and avoid the one at Americana."
Margaret F.,"Los Angeles, CA",644,430,74,5.0,1/29/2011,Faruq was my bartender! Excellent service.  Dedication beyond demand d. Highly recommend!  A+
Marco R.,"Glendale, CA",272,81,19,4.0,9/2/2011,"Huge portions, good food and very ice cold beers. Waitresses in white pants help! I loved their grilled tuna and their avocado egg rolls!  I would recommend going on a week day since the weekends have a huge wait here."
Travis G.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",24,7,2,5.0,4/29/2012,"I'm a sucker for just about any Cheesecake Factory on the planet. I get Avacado Eggrolls and the Club Sandwich every time. Service was great at this location, and I always enjoy reading the 20+ page menu."
