Richard O.,"Glendale, CA",58,505,63,4.0,9/30/2011,"This review is only on their burgers. Their cheesecakes are too rich and thick, but their burgers are out of this world. The American Kobe burger might be the best chain restaurant burger in America. I've had burgers at TGIF and Chili's, but this place is flat out better than they are. One star off for the steep prices."
A B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,2,4.0,2/26/2011,"I love coming here with my cute husband for a nice dinner followed by a movie.  The wait time is a bit long, and they are always busy.  I love the food and I always have leftovers, the bread is amazing, and I always look forward to the brown bread before our food gets to the table.  The salads are ok, and only because they are not green, but white lettuce.  I would rather prefer it was dark green.  It's a little loud, since they are so busy, but I have learned to adapt to that.   They have great hamburgers, and the cheesecake is spectacular."
Gaby D.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",11,6,1,4.0,1/25/2012,I came here for the first time with a group of 5 people and we were very well accommodated. The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere and the service is splendid. Food wise i fell in love with the 4 cheese pasta with chicken definitely would come back to eat that! and the original cheese cake is BOMB! it might be a bit too big for one person but its amazing! This is definitely  a place i would recommend everyone to come eat!
Mark L.,"Glendale, CA",115,23,,2.0,1/6/2011,"Overrated. The best thing here is the mixture of bread and vinagrette dressing me and my friend happened to improvise. Service is nice and i like how they put your food in the to-go box for you. Ultimately, you will be dissapointed. Guys, if you take a date here, only do it if you know it will help seal the deal. If not, dump her and save your money and time waiting for a table. Girls, if a guy wants to go here he doesn't know better places to take you."
Jackie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",289,201,10,4.0,8/28/2008,"Yes, for the fiftieth thousandth time, I have not been to Americana.  Until today of course.  :)  I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories and I must say this one was similar to all other locations.  However, this location doesn't beat my favorite location in Fashion Island.   My company took me here for my one year anniversary and I was excited to see Americana since I've been wanting to go for quite some time now.  We had reservations for party of 10 and despite getting there on time, we still ended up being seated after all the individuals who had just walked in without reservations.....kind of lame and disorganized.   I got a strawberry lemonade which I thought was too sweet and to top it off they sugar coat the rim of the glass....yikes!   Starters: Avocado egg rolls (So good!)  Spinach dip (How can you go wrong with this?) Calamari (meh, just ok)  For my main dish I ordered one of my favorites, chicken Madeira topped with asparagus, melted cheese, and covered with mushroom Madeira sauce.  It also comes with their mashed potatoes.  Farfalle pasta is also another one of my favorites that I didn't order this time. Despite how stuffed you are like our waiter, Sergio said ""You are at the Cheesecake Factory and have to get cheesecake!""  So that's exactly what most of us did.  We all ended up sharing Dessert: Coffee cheesecake Peanut butter cup cheesecake   30th anniversary cheesecake Chocolate cake The last cheesecake we decided to get was by recommendation of another waiter who said it was so good it would make you cuss!  Let me tell you, DAMN it was FUCKING good.  I know most cheesecakes here are really too rich, but this one was actually the lightest one I've had.  Ladies and gentlemen, the banana creme cheesecake is to die for.  I'm not even a fan of bananas and it was so gooood!  My supervisor who had eaten his whole plate of pork chops, mashed potatoes, and spinach that was full size mind you was certain he wouldn't be able to eat any dessert.  Well, he pretty much killed that banana creme cake! hahahahaha.   Americana is absolutely beautiful and Cheesecake Factory complimented it quite nicely.  I will be sure to come back some other time!"
Mamaa M.,"Glendale, CA",25,232,6,4.0,7/16/2013,"Located at the Americana, always crowded and a wait to get a table, but once seated, we always enjoy a great meal. The entrees we order vary, but we never leave without ordering the popcorn shrimp and a delicious slice of cheesecake."
Sabrina S.,"Charleston, WV",2,27,1,2.0,10/1/2009,"Food was ok but the reason I give it 2*'s  is because a friend and I each spent over $30 on our meal and appetizer, each, and since the appetizer I got was big I was actually full & only took a bit or 2 of my entree.  We each asked for a to go container and the bags came stapled up & the waitress handed each of us our containers. She goes home, I go back to my hotel, now getting hungry again, open up my container and it's her food (which I id not want)! She is an hour away from me & while she has a fridge at home I do not in my hotel room! She didn't want mine either so we each wasted about $20 thanks to the waitress's mistake!"
Leon S.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",5,6,,4.0,1/1/2014,Love cheesecake!!! Reason why I gave 4 stars becasue you always have to wait atleast 30 mins to get seated otherwise it's a great place to eat!
Joey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,320,3,4.0,7/6/2013,"place is always busy, but its clean and the workers are friendly. my son had the kids pizza and i ended up with an expensive tortilla salad. my son loved his pizza, it looked great. my salad was huge! huge doesnt always mean good but it was a good salad. i ended up taking more then half of it home, which must be a first to have leftover salad, lol. next time ill have a slice of cheesecake!!!!!"
Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",252,773,409,4.0,5/11/2011,"This one's way better than any other cheesecake factory I've had. Yeah, I thought all of them were the same but it's not. Apparently these guys know what they're doing. The food is better and and in larger proportions. As usual though, they do have a book of a menu but I don't think I saw any advertisements. If there was one or two, I didn't pay attention to it. Sigh, ads do not belong in a food menu. Another con, I don't really like how they try to get the most out of the day's light. The sun is about to set and yep, it got pretty dark in there.  I get the whole green thing but when it's not functional, it's no good. It get noisy, crowded and there are kids banging on plates but this is what we get for paying an average 9-18 for a meal. Oh and avoid all cheesecakes. They are too sour and try to hide the sour with all sorts of flavors and toppings. The foundation is still wrong but this isn't too much of a concern when you don't have any more room left in the belly."
Robert W.,"San Marino, CA",35,30,,3.0,2/29/2012,"It is what it is right?   We all know going in what Cheesecake factory has. HUGGEEEE portions and alot of calories and fat.  With that being said, the avacado egg rolls are always on point. Any of the main entrees will be right on. But of course the best part of any visit...the Cheesecake.  This time i went for banana creme....amazing stuff.  Almost a meal by itself it was so big. Which leads to another point. Skip the appetizers or share them and make them the meal.  Otherwise, no way you are getting through appetizers , entree and dessert.  Just too much food.!"
maria r.,"Glendale, CA",113,15,6,5.0,10/18/2011,"Always a great day when we go to Cheesecake Factory!  Love the banana cream cheesecake! not so heavy like the other cheesecakes.  Love the tuna carpaccio appetizer, tamale and even the kids meal are good!  Will definitely come back whenever we can!"
Carlos R.,"North Hollywood, CA",74,335,35,4.0,5/11/2011,"good location.  best ranch ever...still.  they changed up my orange chicken recipe. it's familiar from my last visit a year ago, but different. don't think i like it.  the hosts are cool. our waitress was on point.  this one seems a bit more mellow in regards to foot traffic than the sherman oaks one.  park in the glendale galleria, walk around, cross the street. no worries about forgetting to validate a parking ticket. and walk off the food coma."
Karin A.,"Glendale, CA",187,242,17,4.0,8/26/2011,"I'm never had a bad experience at this Cheesecake Factory. Great food. Good service. Long waits off course, but I think it's worth it, and it's at The Americana! Get dinner, then go walking around The Americana and enjoy."
Foodie T.,"Glendale, CA",1,30,,2.0,3/5/2015,"Dreadful service from the host!! So we arrived at 2:55pm asking for ""a table for 2."" Literally as we said those 4 little words, the guy we were talking to walked away to do something else and completely ignored us - even though he'd clearly seen AND heard us. Excellent start. Thought whatever and told the now only other host the same thing. This guy had serious attitude from the start. Talking down to us in a very condescending way, he mentioned it would take about 45 minutes - not great, but expected given it was a nice day at the weekend. Fine, we'll wait. How about a table outside? Maybe another 5-10 minutes. Ok - great, table outside, please. He'd already taken down a name, so we gave a cell number for them to text us when table was ready - since they'd 'run out of pagers'. As far as I knew they don't even have pagers any more... weird. We checked out things in the shops and walked around the Americana till 3:45 and decided to check when our table would be ready. Just as well we did! I went to the front of the line (as anyone does when they've already spoken with the host) to ask. The same attitude-problem guy was there and wouldn't even let me talk. ""Urgh, YOU just cut in front of all these people! You need to go the end of the line! All these people have been waiting!"" As if looking to start a mutiny among guests. Oh, HELL NO!! I found a random server working at a register by the bar and mentioned the rude host and that we just wanted to check how much longer we'd have to wait. Server managed to find the manager (yeahy) to help us. Sadly the manager couldn't find either our name or our number in the list... But in the end he just seated us anyway and did actually apologize when I mentioned how rude, arrogant and condescending the host was at both interactions. Even though the rest of the experience, food and server were all fine, it still bugs me that the host - who can make or break the first impression at any restaurant - could be so rude."
Carrie D.,"Pasadena, CA",1500,416,2,1.0,7/23/2008,Went here to for an early dinner and had one of the absolute worst experiences ever! I broke my tooth on a foreign object in my salad. The company is actually refusing to pay my dental bills which included a root canal. I will never set foot in another Cheesecake Factory and encourage others to do the same.
Andrew R.,"Los Angeles, CA",477,341,9,3.0,12/2/2008,"I've really never understood the national fascination with this place.  Back in the college days at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, there was no Cheesecake Factory, but in Dallas, TX, a short 2 1/2 hour drive away was one of these chain restaurants that somehow fall under fine dining... in the freshmen year if you wanted to be the best date around, you'd drive your girl to Dallas and take her to the ole' Factory of Cheesecakes.  It was such a big deal... Well, it seems the people of Glendale, CA feel the same way.  This new Cheesecake Factory is always crowded, always has a ridiculous wait, and the food isn't that incredible, it wasn't in Dallas and it's not here.  I mean yea, it food is ""good"",  yeah the cheesecake is ""good"" and yes the servers have to go through some crazy server training to work here, but goddamn, it's not fucking Morton's! It's the same as them all...  if you like Cheesecake Factory you'll like this one."
Charisse B.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,18,6,4.0,8/11/2011,"Large portions....pretty good service.  Sometimes kids order from their own menu, other times my husband and I purchase two entrees and share amongst the 4 of us.  Sunday brunch is one of our favorite times to visit.  French toast and tasty quesadilla stuffed with eggs and more.  Yum!  Cheesecake options are vast, other types of dessert available too.   If the temperature is mild, sit outside and enjoy the Bellagio-inspired fountains dance every few minutes."
Mario D.,"Broward County, FL",40,58,12,5.0,8/1/2011,"Nice location. Massive burgers! If you ever get full, you can use the rest of your burger as a paper weight. I enjoyed eating here and I'll probably be back for seconds!"
Jim W.,"Palm Springs, CA",477,363,,3.0,7/2/2008,"Been here too many times to even count.  Why do I come here?  I don't know!  Maybe because they have killer cheesecakes...maybe.  Or, is it that I like to wait and wait and wait for a table (when they are busy). Or, is it the good service...Or...and the list goes on... Seriously, folks, this is your run of the mill Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  Nothing special, nothing great...well, maybe their cheesecake...which I really like. Actually, the one in Rancho Mirage is alot better!"
