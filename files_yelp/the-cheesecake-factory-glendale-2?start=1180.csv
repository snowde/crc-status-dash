Ryan H.,"Alhambra, CA",4,58,,4.0,10/23/2011,"I like the location of this Cheesecake Factory very much. It is in the Glendale shopping center which is great. This location is not the biggest, but it is not the smallest either. I came here for lunch with some friends, and it was, nonetheless, a good experience.  I ordered a pasta marinara with grilled shrimp, and my friend ordered the petite fillet. Both were good and of excellent quality. The petite fillet was rather small, but it was still juicy and tender. The pasta marinara was a huge portion, and it was a light and refreshing meal. For dessert, I ordered my favorite vanilla bean cheesecake. It is my favorite one from them. It is sweet and rich in flavor.  The service was nice and friendly, and the bill came out to around $35. It was a good and delicious lunch."
Jenn F.,"Glendale, CA",22,35,,3.0,10/20/2011,"I ordered the Chicken Belagio which was amazing as usual, but my grandma ordered a burger that was pretty darn terrible.  Something along the lines of the Factory Burger... it was really dry, the cheese wasn't melted in the slightest... and the burger overall was cold.  Sweet potato fries were really good though, so luckily my grandma was able to eat SOMETHING...  I have never ordered this burger before, so maybe the cheese isn't supposed to be melted, but you figure that anything that's meant to be served hot would have melted cheese.  It was just kinda weird...  Overall not too bad of an experience though."
Scott M.,"Palm Beach, FL",626,460,,4.0,9/2/2008,"There are hundreds of chain restaurants that I can sit here and hate on w/ these good ol yelp reviews, but I instead choose to write about the really great ones, Cheesecake factory is no exception...having the backdrop of the americana fountains when u sit on their patio doesn't hurt the review either. Went to lunch with the family here, and decided to venture away from my usual cobb salad (which is fantastic) and try the chinese chicken salad...yet again a wonderful option at the factory. Topped with mandarin oranges, chicken breast, crispy noodles, and a mixed in sometype of tangy vinagarette...this salad nails it, and was plenty for dinner.  The portion was huge and priced at 12.99. The service was pretty accomodating and I was equally impressed with the grt view that we had of the ""water show"" at the americana...the ppl watching that comes along with it...doesn't hurt either:) We also ordered some type of jambalya dish that my aunt was hundred percent pleased with and my little cousin got some type of chicken bacon club with avacado slices that was fantastivc.. Never a dissapointment here..."
Gennie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/25/2012,"Food is good..... BUT the wait time is horrible! No RESERVATIONS??? seriously?!? wow .... Came here last Sunday, early enough to try and get a table sooner, we were told 45 minute wait.... not pleased already....  45 minutes later, we were told another 30 minutes?!?"
James V.,"San Jose, CA",152,264,34,4.0,7/30/2011,Had excellent service from Alvin.  Sat out on the patio and enjoyed some good recommendations by our server.
Armen B.,"CA, CA",87,209,42,3.0,3/6/2011,"Very busy on weekends.  Huge menu, but no scallops?!!!  I was craving for scallops on this particular occasion....oh well.  The food is pretty good, but the best part is the cheesecake and the best carrot cake east of the pond!  I'm not a big carrot cake person, but one bite and I've converted."
Ann S.,"Glendale, CA",55,38,2,4.0,7/24/2009,"The service here is top notch....if anything is wrong a manager will make it right.  I love the salads and dining at the Americana is always a pleasure, watching the people and the fountain."
A. R.,"Los Angeles, CA",323,230,,1.0,9/17/2011,"This place is a complete joke. This is the dirtiest Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to....the silverware is ALWAYS dirty as well as their napkins! Talk about EW! Anyways, the place is always bustling, yet it seems as though there are more customers than waitiers....the service is usually slow and there is just too much food. I always feel fat when walking into that place, and it's just too noisy...reminds me of Bottega Louie."
Stan T.,"Glendale, CA",0,34,,3.0,11/17/2011,"85% of Americans have either heard of or dined at a Cheesecake Factory. Kudos to them for branding themselves so well.  5 stars for the cheesecakes. They ARE good. A lot of restaurants carry their cheesecakes and don't tell you that.  3 stars for the food. And it's OK. Not bad for what it is. Big variety on the huge novel of a menu that they have. For the most part, you will find something you like  and it's pretty consistant. 2 stars for the service. What is up with the servers here? Are they just burnt out or just don't care or just plain and simple not know how to serve or just have too many tables? They boast a long and intensive training program but what happens after? No follow ups? No evals? Maybe it's just my bad luck, but everytime I go to a Cheesecake, it's the same old slow, uncaring, robotic, no personality, fake, lethargic service. Trust me, DO NOT go when it' s half hour to closing time or just for desserts and coffee. The servers just absolutely HATE that. Cause, they make no $. Hence the bad service. I try not to patronize this establisment anymore. The only time I will step foot into one of these places is if I'm with a group of people that want to go there."
Felix G.,"Glendale, CA",67,59,58,5.0,5/23/2011,"My son loves this spot and so do I! Had their Factory Burrito Grande twice already and always puts me into a food coma everytime we get home! Free parking, great location, great dining! Will keep coming back 'til they move somewhere far like Riverside or someplace. Anyway we're happy that they're just in the 'hood ;-D"
Noel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,2,,5.0,1/24/2012,Wow the the food was fantastic. The shrimp pasta and chicken madera were well cooked and tasted delicious.
Angel P.,"West Covina, CA",27,14,1,5.0,3/9/2012,"There are many locations for the Cheesecake Factory, but I think this location is the one to go to. It's located in Americana in Glendale with the water fountain in front of it. There's a lot of shops and a movie theater as well. You are seated quickly and the service is great. The food proportions are huge, but you save room for the cheesecake. I'm simple so I just stick to the strawberry cheesecake, which is worth the price."
Craig L.,"Glendale, CA",0,24,,1.0,6/10/2014,"long wait, and overpriced, rude waitresses"
Hasmik H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,4.0,10/29/2013,"Their food is really good. and the portion of their food is the perfect amount to satisfy you but the wait is terrible and very long. I had to wait an hour and a half till my buzzer rang.. i was frustrated, but the pasta i order was amazing!!!"
Marine K.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/13/2014,I love The Cheesecake Factory! Order the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta!! To diee for!!!
Martin O.,"Alhambra, CA",230,40,199,1.0,3/14/2010,"I can't believe I am writing this type of Review. THIS IS CHEESECAKE FACTORY for crying out loud!! I WALKED OUT OF THIS PLACE. IT WAS THAT BAD So my girl friend and I walk in. We get seated in 5 mins. Really quickly! YAY! I went to the Bathroom to wash up and as I started to walk out. The same guy who seated us, was cleaning the Bath room's floor with a dirty rag and just pushing it with his feet. I thought... ok thats kinda lazy. But what ever I walked right out of bathroom and sat down with my girl. I go to sit down and I feel bread crumbs all over the seat.. I was like (ok maybe the guy who was cleaning it didn't get to wipe it down. so, I just said (what ever) i just kept on looking at my menu. Then I felt something sticky on the table... The Guy barely wiped down the table at all!!!.... let a lone... even cleaned it. Grrr. Ok that was really crazy... I my girl and i kept on waiting for our waitress to let her know. But she was taking too long as well. I was starting to get upset. But kept it cool.  Finely I get up and look for my waitress. As I did, I saw the floor below me. There was this kinda of oil on the floor all over the floor. My girl friend even told me... ""Look at my feet"" she was slip-in and sliding  on the Freaken floor!. I quickly walked over to my waitress and told her everything but the bath room experience. Since then I forgot about it. and didn't remember to tell her. My Waitress kept apologizing. I said ok ""but, i'm walking out, I'm going to look for another place""  As I was walking out. The Manager greeted me and ask if I needed validation for my parking. I didn't but just as I was going to tell him. My waitress walked up to us and asked the manager to talk to me. I told the manager. Here... Better yet. I'll show you. I showed him the floor. The Seat with the bread crumbs all over (Still on the seat!!)... and the sticky table. He apologized. I said ""ok. But i'm walking out..."" As I was driving home... I thought to myself.... ""Dude. I just walked out of cheesecake factory... WHAT THE HELL!?!?!""  ""for being too dirty!?!?!"" This is Cheesecake Factory. I shouldn't be walking out of this place... Even to this morning I still don't believe it... I don't even want to imagine the Kitchen... The Staff was great as always. I just wished the manager would have compensated me in some kind of way."
Etoiles D.,"Burbank, CA",6,55,11,1.0,3/12/2010,"three strikes and the glendale cheesecake factory is OUT! for any managers reading these yelps..your servers are *not* the problem,  YOUR KITCHEN STAFF IS! the first strike: went to Cheesecake Fuckery with my best friend.  asked the server what kind of fish is in the fish & chips.  took a while but she finally returned and said it was ""cod"".  well..do you know how many types of cod there are?? is it north atlantic cod?  is it pacific cod? is it sablefish posing as ""black cod""?  is it ling cod (lingcod) which isn't even cod??  ohh bugger, i gave up trying to ask about the fish and opted for a chicken & pasta dish in a lunch portion.   i'm allergic to dairy.  not lactose intollerant -- allergic to casein.  i noticed the menu mentioned ""served w/parmasean cheese on top"".. i asked very specifically ""any dairy in the sauce? any cream?""  our server said ""no""... and when i said ""may i have this WITHOUT CHEESE ANYWHERE IN OR ON THE DISH??""  she said, ""of course..NO cheese!"" and underlined it on her notepad. after a while our plates came..and my dish LOOKED alright/safe to eat...i poked around with my fork to make sure they'd followed the ""no cheese"" rule.  they had NOT...under some veggies i found scads of melted-in parmasean...they'd tried to bloody COVER IT UP with veggies. hi, hello...cheesecake kitchen staff -- MEET MY DAIRY ALLERGY where i will sit there, desperate for air as my lungs fill with mucus & fluid and i turn purple in the face from asphyxiation...no? no you don't want to see me die at your table? WELL THEN DON'T HIDE FUCKING CHEESE IN MY FOOD! in addition to that, the sauce was SO opaque i had to ask the server -- ""is that dairy?""  to which she answered, ""no, that's butter..."" *eyeroll*  do we need a lesson on where butter comes from? i sent back the pasta and ordered the fish & chips (no slaw) in a desperate attempt to order something that wouldn't take more than 12 minutes to come out of the kitchen on the fly. ugh.. strike 2 came with the fish & chips.  OBVIOUSLY previously frozen filets of (mystery white fish that IS NOT COD)...undercooked, soggy bottom fish sitting on a plate in a puddle of grease with equally greasy sad fries.  horrendous ""tartar"" sauce accompanied the inedible heart-attack on a plate and i pushed my plate away after pulling the grease-saturated soggy battered crust off the fish.  $16 spent on that inedible pile of artery clogging catfood. TWO strikes in one meal -- i hate you cheesecake factory. a month passed and the same friend and i went back to cheesecake factory because i needed to hit up the sur la table in the americana..we were starvin' like marvin' so we went back.  this time, i told myself...order something you KNOW has no dairy..like the thai lettuce wraps... STRIKE THREE Cheesecake Fucktory.  the lettuce wraps arrived on this monstrous platter...the lettuce leaves were ONLY the large, dark green, wilty messy leaves on the outtermost layers of a head of bibb lettuce and NOT the tasty, tender, inner palm-sized leaves this dish SHOULD come with.  WHY CUT CORNERS WHEN YOUR PRICES ARE INFLATED TO COVER 60% of the service, Fucktory?!  WHY WHY WHY?  it's lettuce...it only costs your restaurant 28 cents per head...WHY are you serving the bitter, tough and oversized leaves with this dish?!  WHAT HORRIBLE CULINARY PROGRAM DID YOUR SO-CALLED ""CHEF"" attend?!  moving on..  the lettuce was gross.  the coconut-curry noodles were 3 days overdue for the rubbish and unfit to consume.  the cold cucumber salad was SO OLD and water-logged the cucumber slices were CHEWY not crunchy/crisp and..the kicker... the chicken that they had PRE-GRILLED for grill-marks and MICROWAVED to put on my plate...was not only UNDERCOOKED  but even after microwaving the chicken NEVER hit an internal temperature of 165 degrees (the minimum for cooking chicken and reheating previously cooked items).  YOU CAN'T SERVE IMPROPERLY TREATED/HANDLED CHICKEN IN ANY RESTAURANT! i sent the dish back and the server seemed confused.  a few minutes later a manager came by and patronized me by squatting down next to me instead of standing like a man.  i am not a child.  i am a goddamned chef and i will not take this BS behaviour from ANYONE, especially not some marshalls-outfitted minimum wage making, cheesecake factory manager with a supercuts 'do. those of you who regularly visit the Cheesecake Factory are among the most lemming-like of all restaurant goers.  sold on the huge portions of food that contains THREE DAYS WORTH of fat grams and sodium per dish.  THE most unhealthy salads in america list posted by Yahoo included a cheesecake factory salad topping out over 2,000 calories... and the ""don't eat that, eat this instead"" list for the top 30 food nightmares served in the US... cheesecake proudly holds 4 or 5 dishes on that list -- that's about 20% of the list of the WORST FOR YOU foods in america..coming from cheesecake factory."
Adelaide O.,"Los Angeles, CA",248,51,6,3.0,3/18/2011,"The waitress was raving about the shepherds pie. Maybe she talked it up too much... it was really bland. I was really disappointed because it was my last meal in the states, and I wanted something good. My grandma shared some of her delicious crab cakes with me. But once I had some cheesecake, I didn't know why I even ordered dinner in the first place."
Mari D.,"North Hollywood, CA",19,69,,5.0,10/12/2011,"Love love love The Cheesecake factory! So many different choices of entrees, drinks, appetizers and of course cheesecake! I do recommend the Lemon Herb Chicken and strawberry lemonade!"
David Iceman L.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,180,15,1.0,4/16/2011,"This is the worst location--the food is bad, the service terrible, and the employees are lazy. Ordered a strawberry lemonade which didn't come and the waitress didn't apologize.  When i asked for the check, she asked if I wanted more water."
