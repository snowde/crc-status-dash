Marcel G.,"Grandville, MI",14,30,18,2.0,2/16/2017,"This is the 2nd time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory and can't say I was impressed. The Chicago location left a bad taste in my mouth and so I figured I'd given it a second chance, and to my dismay nothing changed.   [Server]: Our server was awesome, super nice and chill. Beard game was strong too, looked like he cut lumber for recreation.  [Food]: So I ordered the Chicken Marsala and I was slightly disappointed with the integrity of the dish. The chicken was vapid in flavor, there was absolutely no real good seasonings or rubs applied. The pasta wasn't cooked all the way so it was more chewy than what it should have been, and the sauce glazed over was bland. There was a better party in my glass of chianti than that whole dish.  [Atmosphere]: So this place throws me off. Because it's located in the Americana, so it comes off upscale but then you step inside and it's total opposite. The Cheesecake Factory needs to figure out how it wants to be perceived. The aesthetic of your restaurant comes off classy but if I step inside and close my eyes it sounds like I'm in Red Robin. Maybe Cheesecake doesn't wanna be considered fine dining? Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe it's Maybelline? Anyway, if you are trying to come across fine dining, you missed your mark. Between the overcrowded seating, loud ambience, and the allowance of baby high chairs in-between tables gives it that glorified Olive Garden feeling.  [Overall]: Sorry, won't be returning. Server was kickass but the food was depressing and the atmosphere was overbearing. No thanks."
ANA P.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",3,59,131,4.0,3/2/2017,Dear Cheesecake Factory my family and I love everything on your menu but the quality of the food has slightly gone down...  please be careful I just found a piece of plastic in my jambalaya..
Ana S.,"West Covina, CA",0,10,1,1.0,3/18/2017,An hour and a half to wait for a table. Thirty mins til the server gets to your table. Thirty mins for food to come out. Thirty mins for leftover food to get boxed. H O R R I B L E.
I Am T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,16,5.0,2/17/2017,"Perfection of decadence is whereby my travels thus far have lead me! Proceeding therewith the ideal of feeding the citizens of my Empire, I decidedly so was requested by my assistant lead to venture off inwards the area of fine dining.. HENCE.. the Cheesecake Factory! Seated politely, respected as the dignitary lead of Empires.. as thrown rose petals, fountains of rare beauty, master architecture surrounded my every footstep across marbled tile, towering glass doors reflecting oneself upon my grand entryway! Furthermore, I not only found myself baffled thereby the respectful crowds.. yet.. I found myself ASTOUNDED thereby the decor of the pristine.. nonetheless clean environment amidst hard service workers of the Cheesecake Factory! Holding my scepter proudly towards my seated noble citizens therein my sight at such a extravagant engagement, surrounded thereby my honored guards.. I stated outright amidst the waitress's and waiters.. situating my crown atop my proud head,""BEHOLD.. the taste of elegance.. crisp, delicate, tantalizing flavours, spices adorned, succulent fowl, flawless appetizing greeneries.. harvest bounty placed down therefor the enjoyment of LIFE'S FEAST!.. Ahem... shall we.. begin..."" Immediate applause rang out amidst cheers! As.. am I.. Moreover I give gratitude therefor the chefs and fine staff of rarity, accolades for your fine performance! ""CHEERS!"" The Emperor has spoken.."
Preni S.,"Glendale, CA",3,25,4,1.0,3/18/2017,"Probably the worst! I usually order for take out and you have to wait on the phone forever. Recently, I called to order and I was left on hold for more than 30 mins, unacceptable! The person speaking was rude and had no manners. Please change your whole staff of employees because they currently suck :)  negative stars if it was possible"
MadnRonyHops ..,"Los Angeles, CA",3,55,28,3.0,2/12/2017,"As everyone already knows. The wait time here is insane. Then after you get paged there's another wait to be seated. Cmon now.  I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits. Seeing that it was about $18. I figured I was about to get a huge plate. Well technically the ""plate"" was huge lol. The chicken portions were a joke. 3 super thin sliced pieces of chicken breasts .....Really? They were almost paper thin. You know how much a piece of chicken breast costs at a local market? You guys basically gave me .50 cents worth...If that! My only high note was the service from my waiter Orlando. He definitely is the definition of customer service."
Daisy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,66,11,5.0,4/4/2017,"Excellent waiter!  I wish I remembered his name.  My date and I were sat in a booth by the bar section.  This guy was amazing with his service, quick and efficient.  All recommendations were delicious.  Highly Recommended!  I order salmon and shrimp and date had the orange chicken.  We also order cocktails and the chocolate fudge cake.  Excellent!"
Michael V.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,7,,1.0,8/9/2017,The problem with this place is it so disorganized two people were sitting here for two hours while we were waiting for our table which got messed up three times
Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1210,765,2683,3.0,7/8/2016,"I'm not one to ever come to American chained restaurants, but it was for a gf's late bday dinner and she wanted something very simple and casual so what bday girl wants, bday girl gets haha. Since she lives near the area we chose this location, and it's great since there are many stores, as it's right in Americana mall. You can park in the parking structure, and make sure to validate at the restaurant. The inside is pretty big, a bit dim on the lighting. Very casual and relaxed setting and a small bar area in the entrance. As you are seated they give you complimentary breads. I love the oat bread. It's dark colored, like chocolate, and tasted sweet. Kind of remind me of the sweet oat bread from Subway. It comes out a tad warm and so soft. Along with some sourdough bread that is okay but not close to the oat bread. And lots of individual butter. We got another round of bread as we finished the first round first, and I must add it's dangerous because I already started to get pretty full and it's the perfect combo of carbs and sugar :) The menu is pretty big, they have such a huge selection and it's great for families since they have something that everyone can enjoy, all with different taste. I also like how they have a separate low calorie food menu. My gf's and I ordered a bottle of their pinot noir. It was slightly dry, but a nice aroma and smooth. _Endive Salad. Belgian Endive, Radicchio, Glazed Pecans, Blue Cheese and Vinaigrette. My gf usually gets this when she comes here, and I can see why. It's a perfect small salad to start off with. The salad is refreshing but really carries and overpowering and pungent flavor from the blue cheese so make sure not to grab too much as a little goes a long way. Pairs nicely with the candied pecans, for some sweetness and balances well with the cheese and slight bitterness from the radicchio. All the ingredients go well together and the dressing is nicely sweet and tossed easily, which I appreciate. _Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini. My 2 gf's split this. I tried a bite and it was pretty good, but way too spicy for my liking. It had a real strong pepper aftertaste. The shrimp was nicely cooked and it seemed they put good amounts of it as well. Nothing amazing but if you like spicy this is a safe pasta dish.  _Skinnylicious Soft Tacos. Three Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken or Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Onions, Cilantro and Crema. Served with Escabeche Vegetables. I ordered this from the skinnylicious menu. I got chicken. It comes with all the toppings on the tacos but I asked for it all on the side. Good amount for 1 person or 2 to share. It was okay, I've had better tacos elsewhere, and was not really expecting much. The chicken was overcooked and dry and very bland in flavor. They barely gave enough toppings for all 3 toppings, especially the avocados, they really skimped on that. The best part of this dish was the escabeche vegetables. It was pickled cucumbers and cauliflower, that was refreshing sweet and acidic.  _Tiramisu. Italian Custard Made with Mascarpone, Whipped Cream, Lady Fingers, Marsala and Coffee Liqueur. Topped with Whipped Cream and Ground Chocolate. Surprsingly, pretty good. I know it's cheesecake factory but none of us were in the mood for cheesecake, but actually all agreed on tiramisu. It was great, but holly jeeeeeezzzz..... can you put any more whipped cream in the plate?! I couldn't tell if the dessert was the whopped cream or tiramisu. One whip would have been enough. Nothing like taking a classic great dessert and smothering and over killing it with cheap american sugar. There was barely any ground chocolate as they mentioned. I would get this, just ask for easy on the whip cream. Nothing to rave about, and I would not come here again, unless someone wanted to go for their birthday haha. Service was good."
Caeser S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,2.0,6/18/2017,"Terrible attitudes and the food prep to go was disgusting. I wouldn't recommend it to go at all. Definitely going on my blogs ""service of shame"" where about 235+ in the Glendale area read and share my stuff. Thanks for nothing. Two stars as one segment shouldn't shame the rest."
Thomas D.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,113,495,4.0,8/15/2016,"Excellent happy hour with a variety of food options... and let's not forget about the red velvet cheesecake! I try to get here for the 4-6PM happy hour from time to time. It's definitely high on my last of happy hour favorites. The Vietnamese spring rolls, chicken sliders and crab wontons are a hit. Their strawberry lemonade compliments any meal well!  The service is usually prompt and the staff is attentive. I've only ever had one bad experience with a server, but this seems to have been an outlier. If you want a happy hour that gives you more for your money, then you can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory."
Abraham A.,"Tujunga, CA",4,80,9,1.0,8/29/2017,"Worst location, service is always horrible, imagine having to get up through out my visit to get myself water and silverware because the only time my table was approached was 1. When they took my order 2. When my food was brought to me never knew who my waiter was...I asked for my ribeye to be cooked medium rare it was brought to me medium well almost well done. Reallly poor service at this location compared to the rest I've been too"
Swaggy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,2.0,10/30/2017,"A little disappointed last visit. Love to go here for weekday lunch and Sunday brunch but last Sunday we were the first ones in the door at 10am, so the place was not busy yet at all, we got our breakfast and the eggs were actually cold. Not room temp. But cold. My mom's eggs were too. Pressing for time we didn't send them back. And I got the wrong pancakes. Honest mistake but by the time I got new ones we had to get going. Hosts & servers were nice as usual. Just expected better from TCF."
Varazdat P.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",7,5,,1.0,11/25/2017,Awful... this has to be the biggest shame of a restaurant I have been to. Used to come here all the time... it's been a year or so. Today everything was crappy steak Diane overcooked... they sent it back brought a new one this one tasted old.... funny thing is my mom's tuna salad also tasted of old overseaoned fish.... so disappointing the only decent thing is the service... wow you guys lost your quality over the years tastes like a truck stop diner food... smells old and you eat it to get by....
Nelly M. I.,"Glendale, CA",25,2,,5.0,9/27/2017,"my best friend & i love to come here right before work and just catch up. our waitress though, made the experience ten times better! Bethany, was beyond amazing. we never asked her for anything more than once and she had the best attitude. oh & food was amazing :)"
Jennifer D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",128,124,604,2.0,8/12/2017,"So this was a fail from every level. I came I after dinner, just to pickup a cheesecake, with the intent to eat it outside. They were closing, although I was the only person in line, basically the counter informed me until they figured I was not going to go away and finally took my order and waited an additional 5 mins for them to give it to me! The slice was in the box, all it needed was it's signature whipped cream. Although the guy that took my order walked away and when he came back, realized I was still standing there and then gave me my order! When I sat down to enjoy my slice, I had a runny whipped cream that was spattered all over the place and ruined the presentation and quite frankly the slice because it was basically milk pour over it!!! Mind you I just took the slice to table a outside, so just in case you thought it must of melted. Very different service from the Irvine Spectrum Cheesecake Factory."
Sue K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,48,5.0,11/4/2016,"It's all about their salads! I love getting their entree salads. It's not cheap. However, as an entree, it's well priced. Average is $15 - $15.50. I've tried most of their salads. My favorite 2 are the Luau Salad and the Santa Fe Salad. You get a large/huge portion with meat (usually grilled chicken). They are absolutely delicious.  Their salad dressings are so good! I especially like the spicy peanut-cilantro vinaigrette which comes on the Santa Fe Salad. It has a nice kick to it.  I've had takeout salads from here. Their takeout containers are large sturdy plastic containers. Takeout portions are the same as eating in. Unlike CPK, their takeout salad portions are so much smaller than eating in that it's not worth it.  If you ever feel like having a nice entree salad, head over to The Cheesecake Factory."
Kara M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/24/2017,"If I could give no stars, I would.  5 people behind a counter, just 1 on the register, and it takes 45 minutes or more for someone to grab a premade cheesecake.  You would think a place called Cheesecake Factory could at least serve cheesecake quickly!"
Lover B.,"Napa, CA",390,3,,1.0,5/20/2017,"I still have the food stuck in my throat from the bartenders' (plural) neglect to serve me a drink - just because the entire bar wants to watch the Western Conference Finals and you guys have to switch from your precious Hockey game, doesn't mean you don't have to stop serving your reoccurring customers.. You're lucky we tipped you, ingrates."
Al A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,69,2,4.0,6/20/2017,"Since recently moving to the area from the mid city.  I've noticed that my family and I have been coming here pretty frequently.  I only remember going to the grove twice in early 2000, and once at the woodland hills location(where I grew up) back in the 90's. But the Americana location??  I think I'm becoming a regular.   The sunday brunch is awesome, the neo pasta a favorite, so as the pancakes, shepards pie, and the scampi.    The service generally goes from great to just ok., but 'not gonna throw names under the bus, because thats just being a bully. The place seems busy each time we go, and the staff seem overwhelmed.  Could be cleaner, not sure if sanitation towel is used to wipe tables and chairs...silver wares were dirty, the plastic water mug always feels greasy, dirty, and cloudy. No one seems to pre-bus tables., at least our tables weren't usually pre bussed.,dirty plates weren't taken away., not sure if thats a practice at cheesecake factory.  Back in the days, I remember cheesecake factory differently...clean, polished, top notch service, and delicious food...just to name a few. Nonetheless, there's room for improvement, but the neo pasta, scampi, and the pancakes are top notch.  I'd still go, and still recommend this location. And please, wipe down your menus sometimes...it gets nasty!"
