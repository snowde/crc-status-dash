Beverly B.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/12/2013,"Always fun, electric atmosphere. Staff are always professional and courteous at least so far."
Nancy B.,"Arcadia, CA",91,50,1,4.0,4/4/2009,"""What I love about the cheesecake factory: Atmosphere, service, food and drinks. My main dish of all time is Chicken Marsala its delicious, trust me I've been to other restaurants for Chicken Marsala and none so far can top cheesecake factory. I have tried so many different dishes and cheesecakes and have no complaints. BUT my #1 cheesecake is Kahlua yummy. About drinks my favorite Georgia Peach I can't leave before I have my Georgia Peach. So, if I love the cheesecake factory so much why didn't i give it 5stars-- long wait specially on fridays and wknds and the fact that they don't take reservations. Reservations would be an ""A+"" That's really the only reason. Best time to go is lunch/dinner time on weekdays..."""
Genia J.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/12/2010,"If I could put no stars I would.   Very simple, the night of my daughters birthday was a complete disaster so I e-mailed the Corp office. Three days later I received a call from the GM and got an apology and was told to expect something in the mail so that they could have a second chance.......NOTHING ARRIVED ALMOST A MONTH LATER!!!!!!!!  I certainly did not need nor expect a gratis meal from them, that was not my intention from the beginning. Being a small businessman I simply thought that the office should know when they completely ruin an evening that was to be a celebration of my daughters birthday.  Shame on the management, no follow up. It all makes sense now. If the staff treats the customer as the GM did us there is no follow up which can make a dining experience pretty poor.  Wish I COULD GIVE THEM A ZERO!"
Elizabeth S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",32,52,2,4.0,2/12/2011,"Whenever I go here I usually try to sit outside or ask for a booth because I hate sitting at the small tables with a stranger sitting right next to me. Usually they are nice about accommodating me since I ask when I first put my name in. Don't be deterred from sitting outside when it's cold because the heaters are surprisingly efficient and you can watch the fountain show from your table. One of my favorite dishes is the teriyaki salmon which is on the little special menu they have. Like everything at Cheesecake Factory it is a big portion and has a lot of food. As for the cheesecake, I've had hits and misses. I've found that I like the cheesecake that is more simple and tastes more like cheesecake. Don't order the chocolate cake. It was dry and not good at all."
Hector O.,"Dallas, TX",6,12,1,4.0,3/6/2011,"The ambience was very nice and fun. It is at a very hip location, the Americana. The waitress told me the Sheppard Pie was amazing, I must disagree. It was okay. The meat was not seasoned very well. For dessert I got a oreo cheesecake. That was delicious. I would come back again."
Greg T.,"Van Nuys, CA",5,92,6,1.0,2/24/2012,"I used to like THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  The food was consistently good at all restaurants.  You know what you were getting.  Oversize portions, for very little money.  Tomorrows lunch was from the Cheesecake...I've ate at this location a few times.  But the last time would be my very last time at any Cheesecake Factory.  After my meal was complete, I walked around the Americana feeling fine.  Half hour later, I had the worse food poisoning of my life.  No Kidding.  I threw up 7 times during a four hour stretch.  I've never felt worse.  I'll never be back..."
Kay P.,"San Diego, CA",58,47,2,4.0,1/20/2011,"Great fast service, Great with kids, (especially the ones like mine that like to throw themselves on the floor because they didn't get exactly what they wanted) and great location. Even though I was just visiting LA to see my cousin and his girlfriend, I had a great experience."
Christina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,15,9,5.0,3/1/2011,"Love their jambalaya pasta, calamari and their lunch specials! So far all their waiters are on the top of their game. Mmmm"
Tedrik N.,"Sun Valley, CA",57,3,,4.0,10/29/2013,i reallt enjoyed the burger! i guess it was with grilled chees and blue chees.. was something i would like to go back for again
Courtney A.,"Glendale, CA",3,22,,2.0,5/10/2008,"Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came. You want to be where you can see our troubles are all the same. You wanna be where everybody knows your name. ... Only you don't, since everybody knows your name because you all went to the same high school. Gag me. And shame on you if you think Cheesecake Factory is fine dining."
Maria W.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",108,43,2,1.0,9/29/2012,"This was my first time to the Americana. We were able to actually get an outside seat and observe the water show. however the service outside was horrible! I had to figure out who our waiter was, had to get up and ask for water  (after being seated for 10 minutes). Didn't take our order for another 15 minutes! Food was served cold, had to get up again and ask for refill of my drink! So not the Cheesecake Factory experience I am accustomed too!"
Kirk H.,"San Jose, CA",1,7,,1.0,7/23/2008,"We came at dinnertime on a Tuesday night and there was a 20 minute wait. Not a big deal. But the service was terrible. They talked a good game, everything we asked for they would say ""oh, yes, excellent, right away, of course I can get that for you"". And then never bring it.  My partner choked on a piece of bread, and I asked 3 people for water, none brought any. When we finally got our waiter to bring some, he brought one glass. There were two of us at the table, but only brought one glass.  He brought a beautiful garden salad for a starter, but no dressing. Each time we asked for it we were assured it was ""coming out of the kitchen now"". What? is the kitchen staff making dressings for individual salads?  After waiting 45 minutes for entrees, our waiter handed us off to another waiter who also assured us that anything we wanted, he would bring it right away. Which he never did. He did clear the salad plates along with all silverware, and then brought the cheesecake we ordered in a to go container after the meal. When we pointed out that we had not received our entrees yet, he really had a hard time comprehending that fact. When he brought the entrees, I thought it was pretty obvious that he had cleared the table of all silverware, but he didn't catch on to that fact, so we had to go through another round of asking for something and not getting it.  Food was okay, but I seriously needed water or some kind of drink, maybe I should have brought some with me.  I will not go back there again"
David O.,"Glendale, CA",17,45,,3.0,8/30/2008,"Big portions and a never ending menu.   The food is alright, I've never had anything hear that I craved.  It's just an Ok-restaurant."
Jay C.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,572,9,4.0,10/5/2008,"Guilty indulgence, this place is great.  The food is ALL good and the drinks are stiff.  The help is also great, if you happen to be over in Glendale check it out!~"
Jon R.,"West Covina, CA",24,74,164,4.0,10/25/2008,"its been ages since i'd last eaten at the cheesecake factory and so i came here with my family after my graduation ceremony.  located in the beautiful americana mall, this is one huge restaurant!  lucky for us it was a friday lunch time and so there was practically no wait to be seated. first thing you really notice is how extensive their menu is.  good god they serve all kinds of food... mexican, asian, american, italian cuisines are all represented here.  whether that's a good thing or bad thing, i don't know as i've only really been to a cheesecake factory a few times... i try not to order asian food from non-asian restaurants.  i go for their most popular dish (according to the menu) which is a cajun jambalaya pasta which is supposed to be very spicy... i was even warned by the waitress.  i'm not a big fan of very spicy food but i figure, i could give it a try.  it wasn't even spicy a little bit.  nevertheless the pasta itself was delicious.  i had some of my mom and sister's shrimp bistro dish and the shrimp was awesome!   but this being cheesecake factory... you know we had to order some cheesecake.  they have a lot of options but i always go for the fresh banana cream cheesecake... oh my god that thing is divine!  they really don't disappoint on that front.  best cheesecake i've ever had.   we had a pretty good experience, we had a really nice waitress and so definitely no complaints on that department."
richie c.,"Long Beach, CA",0,50,5,1.0,6/9/2008,"DO NOT EAT HERE It's the only warning you will get. I hadn't ate at a Cheesecake factory for 2 years because of poor service. This time the service was great but i got the pleasure of chewing on a large piece of plastic hidden in my food. I will never, never, never walk into another Cheesecake factory for as long as i live."
Zareh G.,"Glendale, CA",22,41,44,1.0,4/7/2010,"I had a horrible experience in which I found flies in my food. The managers apologized for the mishap and assured me a new plate in no time. Unfortunately , they had forgotten about my re-order and I waited over an 1 hour and 30 minutes before realizing they had made yet another error. I will never eat here again and I strongly recommend that no one else does either.  I am disgusted and disappointed in Cheesecake Factory at the Americana. Unsatisfactory food service!"
Felicia B.,"Morrisville, NC",2,31,,4.0,6/22/2013,A great spot to visit. The ambience is lively and the service is excellent! We will most certainly visit again.
Sarah F.,"Altadena, CA",30,287,89,2.0,9/30/2010,"Our waitress was very nice, but the first time we got our salad, the chicken on it was undercooked.  Then when she brought us the new one, it seemed significantly smaller, and I wonder if they brought us a lunch size instead of the dinner one we had ordered.  They also brought out the wrong pizza and so we had to wait longer for the right one to come as well.  Seems to just be understaffed and the people in the kitchen are incompetent."
Lee S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,5,,2.0,3/26/2011,The service is horrible the hostess don't really know what's going on and if some one spills something at your table and the food comes at the same time they don't really care to help
