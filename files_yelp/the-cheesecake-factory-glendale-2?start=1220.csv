Jackson B.,"New York, NY",12,55,1,3.0,7/2/2008,"Why is the Cheesecake Factory so damn popular?   Without a doubt, I would bet that every Cheesecake Factory consistently has a wait around dinner time around the country...... what is the fascination?  I don't get it. Personally, I think that they have a major staffing issue.  I have been to numerous locations where there was a wait, but yet plenty of empty tables.....  Also, since this one in Glendale opened near my home, I tend to walk down there late at night for a slice of cheesecake (bad, I know) -- and yet, at 9:30 on a Monday, there is still a freakin wait.... As for the review.... If you really want to eat at the Cheesecake Factory -- expect a wait.  No you can't call ahead.  No you can't make a reservation.  They simply don't care.   The menu is so huge that is puts a Jersey Diner to shame.... you can really eat anything you want.... most of it is pretty good.  If you're easily overwhelmed, I suggest opening the menu and ordering the first thing that catches your eye.... if you keep looking... you could be there all day long .... holding that table... keeping me waiting... I have never had bad service at one..... other than waiting for a table..... forever....... but hey, the weather is nice ... enjoy the fountain show... or something. That's about it.   It's really not worth it.... it's close... it's everywhere.... food is fine.... but there are plenty of other places where you can get good food without waiting forever... BUT -- The cheesecakes are AMAZING..... but you can just walk up to the counter to get a slice of those.... (but yet, still, you end up waiting longer than you think you should)..... interesting...."
Leona S.,"Los Angeles, CA",407,622,664,4.0,8/5/2010,"Before the Americana, we used to go to the one in Pasadena but I'm so freakin' glad they made one in Glendale. This one is nicer than the Pasadena one, and the wait is usually shorter. They've said 45 mins many times, but we're always seated in like 20 mins. And the food is of course, always delicious. Doesn't matter what it is, it's great! I love the Bistro Shrimp pasta, BBQ Chicken salad (could eat that everday), Avocado eggrolls, etc...and their bread, YUM!!!"
Gloria M.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,29,14,5.0,9/3/2012,Very nice location! There's a view to the Americana at Brand grand fountain and water show! Extremely beautiful.
Arianne A.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,16,10,4.0,10/7/2008,"Let me keep this short and sweet.... ORDER THE THAI LETTUCE WRAPS. Seriously, you won't regret it. C'est délicieux!"
Somera R.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,88,23,1.0,7/30/2008,"Okay so I'm a sucker for special deals and today was Cheesecake Factory's 30th Anniversary... a slice of cheesecake for $1.50 so family treat was on me!  We sat in the bar area because it was happy hour time and I didn't want to wait for a booth but lo and behold this location doesn't have happy hour... wth??!! Next, the service was horrendous. I think I got a neck cramp from  continuously turning my neck in all sorts of direction looking and waiting for our server to come. The other servers and busboys passed us by many times with a ""I'm going to smile at you, but that's it"" look. Fifteen minutes in and our order hasn't been taken and the complimentary bread  and utensils were still MIA.  Mind you free parking at the Americana is only for 1 hour and after the first hour you gotta fork up 3 buckaroos.   We eventually got to order some grub and thank God the wait for it wasn't too long but geez, the lady who brought our food was a BIG grouch. No ""hi, enjoy your food"" or a smile. We didn't get checked up on and the water refills came right before we got our cheesecake. Overall, it was one of the worst experiences I've had in a LONG time. The only thing that saved the day were the delicious slices of cheesecake that left a huge smile on the fam's face.  Count me out for a comeback and if you decide to come here avoid the waiter that looks like Perez Hilton. But seriously, dont' come here and instead take your cheesecake happy self to the Old Town Pasadena location where they have happy hour and better customer service!"
Rob J.,"Glendale, CA",29,14,,4.0,8/31/2011,THIS is one of my favorite places to have dinner. so convenient and the food is so good. avocado egg rolls for appetizer and almost any pasta dish does it for me! i would have given it a 5 star but I've had bad experience with the waiter forgetting things twice already.
Amanda E.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,160,,4.0,8/14/2008,"I have been a fan of cheesecake factory for many years. I always leave feeling satisfied! I don't usually like chains, but this is by far my favorite one. Everything is delicious! My favorite items are the thai chicken lettuce wraps, avocado eggrolls, santa fe salad, and spicy chicken chipotle pasta. I came to this new location tonight with my mom and we had a lovely time. We got seated outside and it was really nice. I like how this cheesecake is bigger than the one in pasadena. It wasn't crazy crowded like it usually is. I can't wait to go back and get one of my favorite dishes!  P.S. The iced tea is amazing"
Jia W.,"South Pasadena, CA",503,169,85,4.0,3/12/2010,i come to this cheesecake every week with my friends. service is always good :) people are always friendly and the wait is always moderate. really good upbeat atmosphere!
Tracy E.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",135,92,1,2.0,7/9/2008,"It's not worth it to come to this location unless you arrive first thing in the morning. They don't take reservations, which drives me crazy! If you go here on a Friday or Saturday night, plan on waiting at least a good hour and a half.  I love their menu, but I'd rather go to the Pasadena location where I don't have to wait."
Lily J.,"Burbank, CA",0,21,,1.0,4/15/2011,"I usually try not to write negative comments but this review is about the Manager (Jason B) of Glendale CA.  There were about 10 of us that went to dinner with a child (3yrs old) .  We went and asked an employee to see if they had a few crayons we could use so we could keep our child occupied , instead of saying NO he said "" THIS IS NOT DENNY'S""  seriously !  We asked to see the manager and GUESS WHAT?  HE WAS!! Just to let you know the Pasadena location gives Crayons out, so did I go to DENNY'S or CHEESECAKE FACTORY?  I hope that the manager goes and works at DENNY""S soon.....  It is sad the our waiter was apologizing for the MANAGER, it's usually the other way around...."
Skye R.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,263,1,4.0,5/24/2008,"I came here for its soft open and everything was terrible.  I thought, ""How are they possibly going to be ready on time?""  I gave it several weeks, and it seems like they've ironed out the kinks.   There was a 20-30 minute wait on a rainy Friday at one, so be prepared to wait probably longer than that, on average.  (We got a high-top table in the bar area after waiting only ten minutes, though.)  Service was a tad slow, but accurate, considering our orders were a little ""high maintenance.""   This location is more ""spread out"" than the Beverly Hills or Grove locations.  MUCH less claustrophobic.  And it's a nice view, what with the fountain and trolley.  All in all, an A-okay experience."
Relly C.,"Cerritos, CA",0,207,1,1.0,9/20/2010,"Yes, the fountain is pretty, but the service is rude and tactless. Go here only if you are willing to risk being embarrassed by the staff in front of your guests."
Kiara W.,"Glendale, CA",1,7,,3.0,4/4/2009,"For me Cheescake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. Its good, but it gets old. However, I will review it for those CF rookies out there.  Lets start off with the bread: The white bread is good, but tough. The brown bread, pumpernickel I believe is DELICIOUS with butter if its warm. When the bread comes warm, eat the brown one first because its ONLY good warm. If you have the choice try to order ONLY brown bread in your basket.  Drinks: Iced Tea is good here. Caramel Macchiato is nice. Apple Cider's always fizzy. No complaints here.  Appetizers : Tex Mex egg rolls are good, nothing TOO great, but a nice starter. A bit filling though, so I'd recommend these on a day when you are feeling like a salad or sandwich.   My favorite thing in the whole restraunt has to be the Sweet Corn Tamales Cakes. They are sweet creamy corn patties with salsa and sour cream on top. I could eat these as a meal, but they are good to share.  Food: BLT Salad is very good and simple, but the salads here are huge, so consider splitting it and getting a soup or salad on the side. Or save room for desert :) White Chicken Chili is another one of my favorite, its not an average tangy chili, its more of a rich creamy style chili. It is served on top of rice and the best part is when you get the liquid from the chili and the rice together ! Mouth-gasm. So good! Very big bowl here too. If you plan to save half, always make sure you save a bit of rice to go along with it. Also it heats nicely in a skillet as opposed to the microwave.  Orange Chicken is not good. Chicken is dry and the orange sauce was taken far to literally, and it tastes like orange juice was poured on top of bland fried chicken, to be basic.  Pasta Bolognese is OKAY. OKAY i mean very OKAY average. The sauce is very sweet although it has meat, maybe its supposed to be like that, but for is it is highly off putting. So that was a one time order. I ordered it with truffle oil; not sure if that added or took away from the dish. Cuban Sandwich comes in second after Portos. Very good annd a good portion although im not too  fond of the fries there. Mostly I just eat the sandwich. Very buttery & crispy. Cheesecakes are good. I like the Banana and the Dulce De Leche one personally. :) happydining."
Evan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,139,5,4.0,6/3/2008,"MMMM goodie. Loved the blackened Chicken sandwich. Beautifully blackened, juicy, and enough for 2. Instead of fries my roomie and I asked for steamed Broccoli (which was all right). The chicken comes out on this Texas toast that's buttered and crispy.  Have a side of the Raspberry Mojito or a glass of White Wine and  you are good to go. I enjoyed the food and so did my friend, but we couldn't stand the fact that people were eyeballing us hard and kept asking us every 2 seconds are you almost done because we want your table. I ended up snapping at some lady because she was harasser number 12 and we just couldn't stand it.  The Cheesecake factory at the American is crazy busy at all times throughout the weekend, so I would try to go on an off day like Tuesday morning."
Sonia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,13,5.0,3/14/2011,This place is one of my favorite place!!!! Great cheesecake!! I can't get enough of them!!! Friendly service and good price. Love it!!
Ian H.,"Glendale, CA",25,11,,4.0,10/6/2010,Usually go here every few months. This is a great spot to grab a bite to eat before or after you catch a movie. Just beware it can get packed with people on the weekends.
Eduardo R.,"Glendale, CA",25,58,19,5.0,6/16/2010,"I'm a regular at this location the  mojitos and el diablo drinks are always well made,  I finally decided to try another dish the chicken madeira and Diane steak, well actually the Madeira I had before, buy this one was a combination so it is a new dish OK"
j L.,"Tujunga, CA",3,83,2,4.0,6/2/2010,"The Americana pipes in music throughout the property, an excellent sound system with great musical standards.   The Cheesecake Factory has different music on their patio, classic rock I believe, and a really, really poor sound system.  I really wish the patio music didn't exist, it really spoiled a beautiful Sunday afternoon outside enjoying cheesecake and beer!"
Chowster X.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,2.0,11/2/2010,"I'll be generous with two (2) stars.  I've been here several times before and everything has been good to great.  BUT, after shopping at the Americana, my daughter and I stopped in for a quick dinner at about 9pm.  We requested a booth.  The hostess said ""there aren't any but it will be about 5 minutes"" so we sat down.  We were the only ones waiting in the lobby.  25 minutes later I inquired with another host (since the hostess was M.I.A.) and he sat us in a booth.  While heading to the booth we passed a few extra large booths and I thought ""hmmm, an extra large booth would have been better than waiting 25 minutes"".  Thinking my past experiences were fine and this was perhaps a busy booth night, we ordered and ate.  During our dinner, our waitress told us she was going on break and introduced her fill-in.  We finished our dinner and waited for our fill-in waitress to bring us the bill.  5 minutes went by, 10 minutes went by, and I could see her playing around at the hostess area with the manager and the other hostesses.  We waited 20 minutes before she decided to stroll back over our way.  We got the check, our doggy bags and we were done. Needless to say, I was surprised to have been serviced so poorly.  But then after reading other reviews, poor service seems to be routine there.  Maybe the Manager should focus on more managing of operations and less familiarity with the employees..."
Meli G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,3.0,10/24/2011,"The food here is not worth the price.  It's quite expensive and quite flavorless.  Mind you, I've only tried the pasta dishes, but I was expecting something greater.  The bread is very good and also the crab cakes.  I'm not planning on going back."
