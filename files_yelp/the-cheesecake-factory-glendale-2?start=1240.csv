Lili P.,"Burbank, CA",39,32,,4.0,4/8/2010,"4 stars. Great food, wide variety, good service."
Pam C.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/8/2012,I love this place!! A must for the bf and myself are the Buffalo Blasts and the club sandwich. The Buffalo Blasts are beyond AMAZING!!!!!! The workers are super nice and will help you out incase you're not sure what you want. If I could I would give this place 10 stars. = )
Marine M.,"Burbank, CA",18,13,,4.0,12/4/2012,"Recently, spent my birthday dinner there with my family where we enjoyed roadside sliders and chicken parmesan. The service was excellent as well as the meal! I would gladly go back anytime!"
Adam T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,,5.0,9/15/2012,The Cheesecake Factory would have to be one of the best restaurants in Glendale. Once you walk in you can tell that it is a very great place. Once you come to the desk they give you a beeper that alerts you when a table is available. Once you get to your table a waitress or waiter takes your order. Your order usually come within 20 minutes. The food there is some of the best that i've ever had. If you eat with a few other people the bill usually comes out to between $60 and $100. So if you want to eat out at a very nice restaurant and you have a pretty average budget i'd recommend the Cheesecake Factory.
Carolyn C.,"Garden Grove, CA",545,659,418,3.0,2/7/2009,"after a trip to fathers office and no luck at a booth/table/chair..we left and went to americana..WHY?!?!?! in the POURING rain did we go to an OUTDOOR mall with NO AWNINGS or coverings WHATSOEVER?? beats me but we were STARVED.. we walk in and they tell us its a 25min wait. so difficult to please bcuz if they told us its a longer wait we would have been annoyed but the fact that we waited almost 40min and people who came after us got seated first pissed us off even more. we eventually get called up but we wait another 5 min next to the hostess booth..why? nooidea... then we have our hostess walk us to our table and we are stopped again awkwardly in front of the kitchen for literally 5-10minutes..soooooo awkward..... apparently our table hasnt been cleared out yet...  ( they do this crap throughout the nite..they need a better system... so customers are waitin awkwardly, being stopped while walkin with their hostess to their seats and servers are running into these standin groups of people gettin annoyed they almost spill the dishes, distracting everyone near by it was a hectic experience) we eventually get seated our waitress switches with a waiter and he is a dick. i mean he has an annoyed tone with us from the start. bens beer takes forever and some to come out. our friend orders her pasta with the side of sauce and it doesnt come out till nearly dinner is over and when she asks him about it he replies nonchalantly  ""um we will see i guess i have to check if theyre done with it"" what? its sauce u go and scoop it and of course he forgot but just blamed them... neways it was a nasty atmosphere everytime he came around and when we asked for water and more bread he seemed almost annoyed..i am hopin he was havin a bad day... WHY3 stars then???becuz the bff and i usually HATE cheesecakefactory BUT the food was off the hook this time around. the turkey burger, bbq salmon, salad, lousiana pasta, spicy chicken pasta, and my chicken di pana was super yum!  we were all very satisfied.. so satisfied we couldnt get our favorite cheesecakes =(  im gona say 2.75stars but give it the benefit of the doubt with 3..im so nice =)"
Clara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",767,820,613,4.0,6/29/2009,"cheesecake factory is always a reliable choice. it's not fine dining, but it's better than many other chain restaurants, plus it's tough to beat the sheer variety of choices on their gargantuan spiral-bound menu. i recently discovered the jamaican black pepper shrimp, which you can get with chicken, or shrimp AND chicken. it's delish! i also like their chicken potstickers, french country salad, avocado eggrolls, chicken marsala, lettuce wraps (both kinds)...the list goes on and on. portions are huge so i hardly ever get dessert, but of course their dessert options are solid as well. if you're not in a cheesecake mood, try their strawberry shortcake. yum!"
Jessica H.,"Pasadena, CA",0,21,,4.0,8/25/2010,"This restaurant always keeps me wanting to come back for more.  They have large portions which are good because you can always save half for take home.  My boyfriend loves the cheesecake factory, so we come here quite often.  Their bread is always baked fresh and I love eating it with honey.  They have healthier alternatives such as as the weight management chicken and an array of salads to choose from with low fat dressings made at the Cheesecake Factory.   When I arrived, I was seated almost immediately and the staff was very polite.  My friends and I were seated in a circular booth that was very nice.  We all ordered our entrees and it took no more than 20 minutes for them to come out.  The waiter was very funny and made us laugh.  Their pizzas are enough to feed 2-4 people which is good to share.   Although many of their entrees have high calorie counts, since their portions are so large, it is easy to just eat half and leave the rest.  Their weight management grilled chicken is very good.  I ordered it at first thinking that I would not be full from eating it but I was and that whole entree was only 580 calories according to their nutritional information packet.   The cheesecake factory always has that nice happy vibe and the staff has alway treated me with respect at several other Cheesecake factory locations.  I will be dining here again soon!"
Melina A.,"San Fernando, CA",0,15,,5.0,10/14/2012,"This place is amazing is always packed for sure because of  the food and nice environment ,Friday I was there with my friends we meet each other once in a while and this place is the first option for all of us .Our waiter was new I guess but he was nice and caring."
Daniel R.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",39,26,2,3.0,3/23/2012,"Everyone that worked there was real nice and pleasant. I don't have any bad words for them as we had a big-ish party and they were very accommodating. Still I had a so-so meal. Yes, I know, it's a big chain restaurant. A common place where regular folk can say, ""ah yes Cheesecake Factory... [enter opinion]"". Well it was my first time at one of their fine establishments and I had no idea what they served aside the obvious. Trying to find something to eat from their extensive menu is like trying to find a passage in a book. I really wouldn't mind the amount of food they had if they didn't have PAID ADVERTISEMENTS on every other page. Full page advertisements of realtors faces, back pain drawings and a bunch of other random things. You would think they charged enough for the food to offset the cost of menus. (I'm being picky.) So I tried to ask around the table for suggestions but nobody could hear me. The whole restaurant echos sounds so I had to yell across the table to be heard. That would be fine with a table full of hawks but I was hanging with certified Seniors. I guess nobody had been there before either so i was on my own. I ended up going for the ""Factory Combination"" of Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. Well the Shrimp would have been really good but I only got three measily prawns. I guess I should have gone for the full order to get 6 since 3 more shrimps would have been better than that super bland Salmon.  Yet everyone else at the table seemed happy with their food so I tasted some of their chewy steak Diane and a bit of the frozen fries and yeaaaaaahh maybe it's me. If I ever get dragged there for another birthday I think I'll just get a burger. Oh and if you're expecting a bit of free cheesecake for a birthday there you'll be disappointed. Two stars for good service and a half star for a good half order of shrimp!"
Jennifer V.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,32,,3.0,2/7/2010,"We have given this location 3 chances now and each time it's been meh.  The last time we went I found a piece of plastic bag in our calamari.  The manager comped us the appetizer, but still ... pretty gross.  The wait is always too long, the food hasn't been all that great, but they have a great wine selection. I've given it three stars because the staff has always been friendly and nice. I'd go back for drinks only but that's about it."
Ashley H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,37,,4.0,3/4/2010,other than the fact that every cheesecake is delicious the food is phenomenal!I know that chain restaurants don't always get the best reps but cheesecake has never failed me!I love their cream of broccoli soup for lunch and their great kobe beef burgers I swear the best burger i've ever had at a restaurant.They also have a good philly cheese steak sandwich for lunch as well. For dinner I recommend the Chicken madeira mmmm yum..it is a breaded chicken breast topped with mozzarella cheese with a mushroom marsala wine sauce topped with asparagus and a side of delicious mashed potatoes!I never finish it so it's perfect for lunch the next day!And for desert my favorite cheescake is the chocolate mousse but recently I've been going for the red velvet..mm DIVINE!
Kristi N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,29,5.0,9/22/2010,"I am a true fan of the Cheesecake Factory in all areas. The one at The Americana is one of the best not only due to it's convinent location if you want to go to the movies or go shopping with your sister, but, the restaurant is very clean, the staff is friendly, the wait time is not too bad. I have not had one bad experience here at this CF. The food is always so good. I even caught some baseball games in the bar while enjoying my food with friends waiting to catch a movie. All the staff is nice and friendly. I love CF at The Americana"
Suzi L.,"Burbank, CA",8,173,32,4.0,11/28/2011,"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory in California. We were shopping at the Americana and decided to have lunch at the CCF. Wait was less than usual, only waited 20 minutes for a table. After we were seated, the wait continued. Waitress took a few minutes to come by, then told us she would be right back to help us. Waited a little longer than expected for drink orders, and we were actually ready to order by the time she came back. We ordered our usual favorites, good thing to try the first time in a new location. Food took a long time to come out. Luckily we ordered sliders for an appetizer and those came quick. Sliders were yummy. When we finally got our meals, they were nice and hot. Prepared like we were used to! Great as always! I love the Spicy Cashew Chicken and he the Chicken n Biscuits. Waitress was nice, was attenative to refills on drinks and checked on us every once and a while to make sure we were good. She came by with the check and offered us a sample of their holiday cheesecake, but she never came back with it. oh well. No cheesecake for me this trip, but can't wait to come back!!"
Bella M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/9/2012,There is really no need to write a review.The Cheesecake Factory in Americana Way is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever been to. Location is great!!!!!!!
Melissa M.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/23/2010,"I love cheescake factory dishes but the Glendale location is my favorite. t is located in Americana which is a nice trip for both shoppig and dinning. Love the food and the drinks. No other restaurant has its lemonade, you should try it!!!!"
jeff j.,"Lancaster, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/24/2010,"Unfortunate situation that my daughter chose this place for her birthday dinner. Simply the food, the overall service and managements inability to resolve a totally nightmare situation was a complete disappointment. Not to mention a 500 word detailed account to the corp office that must have fell on blind eyes. No response so far."
L K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,,4.0,12/7/2009,"I went here on Thursday night and had a nice evening.  Cheesecake factory anywhere you go is pretty standard I think, or at least that has been my experience.  I had one of the southwestern chicken salad and it was really good, really large portions though.  What was excellent was the wine...I got the ""Cheesecake Factory"" cabernet and it had a wonderful flavor.  We also had the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert...pretty filling, and we couldn't finish any of our dishes.  The fact that this one is in the Americana is a huge plus, it's a nice place to bring a date, especially during the holidays."
Kelly M.,"Denver, CO",189,134,41,3.0,3/14/2011,"We arrived here on a Saturday night around 6pm. The place was packed and there were several groups waiting for a table. I did not expect for my party of two to be seated so quickly, but sure enough our little buzzer started going off before my boyfriend even parked the car. The hostess waited until he joined me and we were seated outside on the front patio. Even though they were quite busy, our server was very attentive. They started us off with a complimentary bread basket with a few different types of bread including a delicious brown bread with some sort of oats. It was mildly sweet and quite tasty. I was disappointed in Cheesecake Factory. I know given the name I should not expect healthy fare, but given the enormous menu I could not believe that they had practically NO vegan items. Seriously? Your menu is practically ten pages long and you can't manage to refrain from putting meat or cheese on most of the salads? Pretty disappointing. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, the Thai lettuce wraps (sans chicken), an appetizer salad, and the stuffed mushrooms. The food we ordered was good, but I don't think Cheesecake Factory will be added to our restaurant rotation."
Mindy N Shelly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,43,18,3.0,1/25/2009,"The food is always pretty good and fresh, the portions sizes are huge, and I have never had to wait long for a seat, but you can almost guarantee you will get crappy service at this Cheesecake Factory, but I keep coming back cause the quality of food, portion size and convenience of location is worth waiting a week to pay for your bill."
