Khalid N.,"Fullerton, CA",6,979,2,5.0,5/6/2011,"The food here has always been a decent 4 and I don't usually review big chains, but I had to give them mad props for a recent change to their wine list. They started offering half glasses - brilliant!  With a few dozen wines to choose from, they essentially turned their bar into a wine tasting spot (for me anyway). Love the idea and I hope more place do it.  Got the Stump Jump Shiraz and Wild Horse Pinot Noir...and the Lakers are winning. Feeling pretty good."
Christian M.,"Seattle, WA",180,135,37,4.0,7/24/2011,"We sat at the bar and ordered a couple drinks and a handful of different appetizers to eat.  The fried mac and cheese balls were the best thing ever.  I totally understand it now.  The crab dip was delicious, & the salads and pizza were both fresh and enjoyable.  The only thing I wouldn't order again are the wings, but I really didn't expect them to be the best thing we ordered.  Everything came out at once...a practice which I wish did not happen, but that can be overlooked since we were picking at everything at the same time.  I really loved this place.  Everyone was nice and attentive and I will be back for more."
Mark B.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,3.0,7/27/2012,"Great food, atmosphere and mediocre service!! Better service and there will be 5 stars! POTENTIAL!"
Lowell H.,"Sylmar, CA",229,387,3,3.0,6/21/2009,"Really overrated.  If you want to go to a restaurant the size of a football field that has pale knockoffs of the most popular dishes from every other restaurant, CPK's bbq chicken pizza, P.F. Chang's lettuce wraps etc, poor service and most sugary, rock hard frozen cheesecakes and a menu that is novel sized in length, go here.  I rather go to California Pizza Kitchen for the many of the same dishes with better preparation and service."
Robert G.,"Glendale, CA",26,27,,1.0,9/30/2011,"very bad service, had to get a manager involved, to be seated after 3:00 of wait, after being told wait time is 25 mins"
Brian J.,"Pasadena, CA",26,11,,2.0,7/22/2012,"I really like the food at the Cheescake Factory no matter what city it's in.  The reason that I'm posting a 2 is because the way that we were greeted by the hostess.  We went in there last week and the hostess was really rude telling us to just stand over to the right and then we would be seated.  The rude part was when I asked her how long it would take before we would be seated and she just replied to stand over to the right in a condescending and authoritative tone and manner.  I wish I remembered her name as I would put it up here.  She was a young asian lady who appearred to be in high school or college.  I'm half asian so this is not an asian thing.  I told the manager what happened and he made the excuse that she was probably stressed out because it was really busy.  Especially if it's busy, she should be even nicer to the patrons and thank us for waiting as appose to making us feel like cattle or chicken and lining us up.  Besides this, the food and our server was excellent.  I will be avoiding this Cheesecake factory and probably going back to the Pasadena one again when I'm craving Cheescake.  It's not worth getting irritated when your a paying customer especially when you are trying to enjoy a special meal with your loved ones.  No one deserves to be treated like that.  Also noting, she walked by twice giving me a dirty look.  Couldn't believe it... It's a big fail on the management for allowing a worker like her to be there...."
Bettye C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",2,21,1,5.0,3/1/2010,"We've eaten in many C.F. but this is the bomb! Whoever is the chef give him a 5 star rating! Seven people in our group and everyone had a 2 die for meal, scrumptious! Best yet is the Petite Filet for $24 comes soft as butter and melt in your mouth delicious. Miso salmon wonderful. Chicken Marsala over bowtie is heavenly. Appetizers: Thai lettuce wraps and the crab artichoke dip OMG. Not all C.F. alike really but this one beats all."
Rachel V.,"San Jose, CA",135,10,5,4.0,2/20/2010,"I typically enjoy the food at the Cheesecake factory, especially seared tuna salad. I decided to rate this location because I think the service and staff are very friendly and outgoing. The lighting at this particular location was a bit low, but overall a really enjoyable experience. In a very scenic area."
betty b.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,22,12,5.0,8/23/2009,"All I can say is oh my God! I went last night to celebrate my birthday and I had there Godiva Chocolate cheesecake and I was in love lol. It was so good, it was the best slice of cheesecake I have ever had in my life!"
Karolina G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",14,24,1,4.0,8/13/2009,"Everytime I go here, I get great service and the food comes out really quick. The problem is the wait, but you have to expect it at the Cheesecake Factory. I go straight to the bar and get a drink and appetizer and sometimes I just stay there and eat my lunch because the atmosphere is very comfortable. The drinks are always perfect (never weak) and the view from the bar adds to the nice ambiance."
Eddie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,27,,2.0,12/11/2009,"First I am going to rate this place, because of the service... it sucks! And it starts with the hostess, these chicks maybe incompetent, or flat out dumb or suffer from from dementia. I waited so long to be seated, I saw couples and pairs who came in way after  mt wife and I get seated ahead. Second the menu is different compared to the other Cheesecake Factory, for the worst.   The service from the servers is cool, but that waiting really ticked me off. This CF is the closest to where I live. I will continue to go to the one in Arcadia or Sherman Oaks, better service, atmosphere, and food."
Riz V.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,4.0,1/30/2012,"Love love love CF in Americana! Nice location, great food, great view! My friends and I huddled here after a relaxing walk one afternoon during my trip there last week. Appetizers are filling and breads are given generously! Hummus ftw! Yum!"
Torio V.,"San Francisco, CA",361,4,,5.0,1/24/2012,"Oh man, this factory truly is the bee's knees.  If you go, ask for Kevin to be your server.  Then sit back and enjoy, cause you're embarking on an adventure that includes not just dinner, but also a show.  If you ask him to refill your soda, he will totally do it.  FOR FREE."
Elizabeth R.,"Manhattan, KS",42,28,,2.0,5/5/2011,"I love Cheesecake so when I was going to this restaurant I had high hopes and expectations. I was completely wrong. As the hostess was walking us to our seats, the busboy had to clean the table, so we were asked to wait. That was no big deal but as soon as the bus boy finished cleaning, another couple was sat. We were then run around until we were sat at a small two person booth in the corner, I was just glad we got a seat. After we ordered our meal and finally received some glasses of water, I accidentally spilled my glass. I wasn't expecting them to come right away and clean it up, but it would have been nice if i was able to get some service. I ended up using my napkin and my friend's napkin to try and clean it up but it was like a full glass that was knocked over. When the waiter finally came back to give us our food I told him that I had knocked over my glass, I was given another drink and a few napkins to clean up the rest myself. We ended up sitting there with water soaked napkins at one end of our tiny table. Needless to say I didn't stay for desert, I was ready to go."
Kristen D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,41,,4.0,6/4/2009,"Well aside from the weirdo host guy who trying to force the outside seating on us, my girlfriend's birthday dinner was a big success.  Originally intending on eating sushi, we happened by CF and since it smelled good and the menu was HUGE, we went for it.  Activate weirdo host sequence.  BUT!  He did take note when I said, ""It's HER BIRTHDAY, so wherever she wants to sit we're sitting...""  And we got a nice booth.  DRINKS!  Who doesn't love a good L.I. ice tea?  Or two!  Girlfriend got something vodka and fruity that tasted like smarties to me.  We order those, but the server immediately got us some ice water, brilliantly skirting the issue of CA water's supply by ASKING us if we'd like some water to start.  How nice!  And she was QUITE good...re-visiting us an appropriate amount of times during the course of our meal.   We get 2 appetizers.  The fire-grilled artichokes came with 2 dipping sauces that were SUBLIME, but the artichokes themselves hardly even needed extra flavor.  And we get the infamous avocado egg rolls which totally lived up to their infamous status.  I have now printed a copy-cat recipe and I am determined to replicate in my own kitchen.  Also a nice dipping sauce, also hardly needed, as the egg rolls were SO flavorful.   Yeah that bread is decent.  I tried not eating much of it to save room for the meal.  I worried that the brown one was rye, but it was actually pumpernickel and a lot better than I thought it would be. Entrees.  For once we get the SAME dish.  Jamaican black pepper shrimp.  Eh, not so good.  Or at least not what I expected.  The shrimp were small and the tails were pulled off.  I think there was too much curry in the sauce.  I was expecting more pepper, and less ""sauciness"" anyway.  I dunno, I've made better shrimp at home.  White rice and black beans went well with it, and I was so impressed with the appetizers and drinks that I will come back.  Order a different entree tho. OH and then came the little birthday sundae and several members of the staff to effectively embarrass my girlfriend with the birthday song.  So I was happy the host caught me mentioning her birthday despite his weird fixation with outdoor seating.  All-in-all a good experience!!"
Karina S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,6,,3.0,1/29/2012,the food was good but bad service my family got their food firt and i was last and i only ordered chicen
Sintiea S.,"New York, NY",119,332,,3.0,12/6/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the places every one pretends to hate but ends up eating there anyway because it's the only thing that every one grudgingly agrees to. I personally don't dislike it but I don't love it either. DON'T go on a weekend night unless you enjoy bitching about how long it takes to get seated and order. If you want a more pleasant experience go during the day for lunch. During the weekends, and especially holiday season, the wait can be super long and the service not so great. You will probably end up sitting outside next to a crying baby with straw wrappers surrounding your chair. Also, feel free to share...the portions are way to huge for one person alone. The menu...well I don't reallt know if I would call it a menu...it's more like a book. The menu/book has a lot of options so overall, it's okay."
Lina O.,"Orange County, CA",404,485,1970,4.0,6/4/2008,"i went here on a wednesday evening. we only had to wait about 15-20 min for a table, even though it looked pretty crowded. we sat out on the patio where they have nice heat lamps that work really well. we also were able to see the ""fountain water show"" that was kind of like a mix of bellagio and fantasmic? haha also with an occasional spray of mist from the water show. anyway, our waiter was very nice and attentive. (and cute haha!) btw his name is josh. ;) the food was pretty good. he recommend the vanilla bean cheesecake which was actually really good! it tasted just like vanilla bean ice cream, just as he had described. yum! only minus of the experience was that we got our parking validated, which i thought would of covered parking. but i guess it only takes off the first hour? we still had to pay $5 =P"
I am k.,"Glendale, CA",20,41,,3.0,3/2/2011,the service is great but the food is just ok..nothing special but never gross either
Christy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,79,46,1.0,6/19/2008,"i love cheesecake factory. i've been to almost every cheesecake factory restraurant around my town.  but this americana location? i understand this is a new location. e.... terrible. i was soooo disappointed. hosts were very rude, and the manager was even worse. i would never ever go there again."
