Sophie D.,"Corona, CA",106,85,6,4.0,1/12/2009,"So, I went with my bud Tom last week for dinner to catch up on each others lives. So sorry to the waiter that we took up his table for over 3 hours! EEK! I guess good friends can really talk!! LOL They were great about it though, kept our drinks filled and even brought some bread here & there too. Food - Fabulous - we both enjoyed our meals. I had some chicken with some wine sauce that starts with an M - apparently their most popular chicken dish - I KNOW WHY!!! FABO!!! Tom had some fish (Salmon? I can't remember)- he said it was great too for a chain restaurant. It's really loud in this restaurant so I asked to be seated in the back. It was still loud - the acoustics in the place are great - for a concert! Everything is echoed and magnified in the arched, metallic ceilings of this place. Luckily I am loud and Tom is too! It was a good time, but more for the company than the food - Although the food was great. Will go again.  Didn't have room for dessert - but I have been to this location before and had some - it was delicious!! Sorry again to the waiter. We tipped well :)"
MISS T.,"Burbank, CA",0,25,,4.0,6/6/2009,"Mmm the Cheesecake factory! I really do love this place. It seems like I love whatever I get, especially their tacos. And of course, the cheesecake. What more could I ask for. Their lemonades are also really good. And the bread, yuuummy. I can't complain. The service is pretty good as well.  This place does get crowded though and sometimes the wait can be up to over an hour on a really busy day."
Victor G.,"Glendale, CA",42,35,,5.0,1/5/2009,I don't care what people say but I have to give any cheesecake factory a 5 star rating because their menu is so extensive and the food is delicious...you cannot tell me the bread they serve to start isn't amazing and filling as you wait...being here over at least 20 times i would recommend as an appetizer to have the mac and cheese balls and the chicken madeira as your entree...their soups are also pretty good along with just about everything else i have tried...from time to time i've had bad experiences with long waits both to be seated and for the food but i think it is definitely worth it
Nancy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,,4.0,5/10/2011,"The food is great. Try Avacado eggrolls, the best."
Kelly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,471,317,4.0,7/6/2010,"Who hasn't been to a Cheesecake Factory? If you live in Southern California it's a restaurant that is pretty hard to miss. In my 14 years in Los Angeles I have been too many times to count. For a nice establishment such as the Americana, I am disappointed by the restaurants that they host, so the Cheesecake Factory and Jewel City benefit from my repeat business. The ""repeat"" usually comes down to this: If I have a little cashola and the line doesn't appear to be long I go to the Cheesecake Factory and if shopping has been good to me and my cashola supply is low, I go for the more inexpensive Jewel City Diner. The best feature of this particular location is the patio. The inside looks and feels like every other location. With a view of the Americana's magnificent water fountain the patio at the Cheesecake Factory offers a great people watching opportunity. Add good food to the patio experience and you have made a fan of me. If for some reason you have not been to a Cheesecake Factory, all I need to tell you is two things. A) they have the largest menu known to mankind. The menu is so large they have to specially bind it with spiral wiring and B) they have great cheesecake. But the trick is not to eat too much food as to not be hungry for the cheesecake. Food at the Cheesecake Factory is consistently good. I basically order whatever I am in the mood for. Going here is just a matter of do I want a huge salad, a huge pasta dish or a huge (insert dish here). The food like the menu is huge! You could feed 2 or 3 people with the food they bring out for 1 person. And did I mention they are constantly bringing freshly baked bread out? And constantly refilling your drink. I seriously don't even know how people get to the cheesecake? In all the times I have eaten here I have only been able to get dessert a few times. I really, really, wish they would cut the portion sizes down a bit so I could eat that cheesecake more often but alas this is the way it is and this is the way it will continue to be. I just need to learn to split food with my hubby more often!"
Chang O.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,194,222,3.0,6/16/2008,"UPDATED: 3 stars. Came back with a larger group, was seated in a booth. The wait time was still ridiculous, but the service and the food were better than my prior experience. The review based on my initial experience follows. 2 stars. Food is a-ok. My kobe burger was delayed (the manager came out to inform of the delay but did not offer anything in return, like a complementary drink or dessert... so for all that, our server could have brought the news himself.) The delay caused the rest of the table to courteously wait for my food to arrive, despite my encouragement for them get started first... when it arrived, it still fell part, like a loose meatloaf. Service was responsive. When I asked for cream for my coffee, they brought out about half an ounce of creamer in the container... is it budget cuts, or what? The wait is horrendous. Knocked off one star solely for not taking reservations, as crowded as it gets. At the tables in the bar area, people stand around ""hawking"" for a table to clear...  not comfortable at all for diners. Expect to pay for parking, especially with the wait for tables and food, even though a small fraction of the time is validated.  Verdict: run of the mill, like any other Cheesecake factory, but crowded. It makes no sense that it would not take reservations. Half-ass validation means you're likely to shell out for parking if you spend any amount of time, whether it be enjoying your food and drink, or waiting for your table, food, and drink."
Andrew B.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",536,43,,3.0,7/20/2011,"It would be great if they had outdoor seating, but otherwise your standard delicious cheesecake factory"
Tammy V.,"Burbank, CA",28,21,1,4.0,9/22/2008,The Cheesecake Factory is old faithful.  You always know what you're going to get there.  The Thai lettuce wraps are fabulous!
alan h.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,31,,1.0,3/14/2010,"i only give them one star i order a $29 rib eye stake and i did not taste good at all ,it was hard like a rubber and no flavor at all ,i did not eat it i just eat the salad ,i was thinking to take it to go to my Dog but then i said to my self ..may be my dog will get offended because of this cheap meat .i finaly left and will never go back again . next time i will go to NORMS RESTAURANT for stake .so if you crave a stake do not try the cheesecake ."
Kayla P.,"Granada Hills, CA",282,5,,1.0,11/18/2010,i was very satisfied when i dined there until i was eating the rest of my take home. i found a sharp metal object in my food the next day and i wish i found that in there while i was at the restraraunt. it cut the roof of my mouth and my tongue and made eating anything very hard now i feel i always have to prepare my own food never going there again...beware before you eat.
Johnny S.,"Glendale, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/26/2009,I went here a couple times but did not it. The last time I was there I got food poisoned. They put mushrooms after i told them NO mushrooms. then they took it back and brought it back with mushrooms again. I again told them to take it back. the third time they brought it out the food was not cooked well and upset my stomach badly.
Lexie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/14/2008,"i came for my 21st birthday dinner, and the service was amazing! there were 6 of us and our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. he was really patient with us since everyone was arriving at different times we couldn't order until everyone got here. most of my friends got pastas, but i got the chicken and biscuit and it was delicious! after our meal, some waiters/waitresses came around to sing me happy birthday, they brought a cake with them! it turned out that one of my friends brought a cake and ask them to keep it until it was time for cake, they even lit up all the candles too! (very nice! didn't think they were going to do it). after all this, we left our waiter a pretty big tip."
armen a.,"Glendale, CA",3,11,4,3.0,5/2/2010,"this place is not bad but if u go fri, sat, sun the wait is something like 45 min. don't wait, its not 45 min wait good. for the price it is great food and the portions are huge. great for a big group."
Mr.Jelly D.,"Glendale, CA",6,15,,4.0,8/31/2008,"This is a great place to eat because it offers many different types of dishes and the waiters are very friendly. 1. The prices are alright. In my opinion, they should lower it a little.  2. The service is great, most of the people working there do an excellent job. 3. The place looks great. No matter where you sit. 4. The food tastes great. I must admit I am very impressed given what kind of place it is. They serve pretty good tasting food. Make sure to go here. Im giving it 4 stars because they have gone all out with everything....unlike the crappy one in Pasadena."
Kristin T.,"Garland, TX",194,28,2,4.0,10/24/2008,"i LOVE cheesecake factory.  i love their sante fe salad, their tamales, their fried mac and cheese balls, their cheescakes, their louisiana style pasta, their cashew chicken, their crusted romano chicken pasta, their renee's special, their drinks, and their breads!!  i HATE this specific server there.  dont know his name, but he was a BIG idiot.  he was white, cute looking guy, but a HUGE idiot!!  sorry if i sound mean.  but we had a table of 7 girls! im not sure if its 7 or 8 that they add the gratuity.  i mean, we understand and we're young sophisticate women who are ok paying more than expected for tips, BUT this guy was a huge idiot!!  we asked him to split the check, and i understand that it might be difficult.  so we decided to just split it on our own and have him charge everyone the amoutn they owed on the bill.  we included the TIP and our meals and the taxes, and im sure we all over paid a little.  the guy comes back charging us an extra gratuity on each of our bill.  WTF?   we added that crap on there already. we tried to explain to him and he was just CLUELESS!!! non of their managers or service manager or anything came to speak with us regarding this and how they can try to clear it up to help us smoothly get out of the damn restaurant and NOT miss our movie.  i was irritated and ended up charging the whole bill on my CC because he was toooo dumb to figure out how to split the check.  ive gone back because the food is good, but if they ever sat me with him, i will request for another server."
CharaGG K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,15,,1.0,9/29/2009,from all their locations that i have been to  ill never go back to this one! they served us spoiled food and after complaining to cooperate and speaking to their manager who promised a refund i ended up getting a $20 giftcard when i specifically said i did not want their giftcard.
Ana A.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/25/2010,"WARNING!!!! THIS PLACE  RESTAURANT COULD CAUSE LIFE THREATING INJURIES OR DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. bought chicken sandwiches from here and after happily eating my sandwich at home I sensed something hard between my teeth. LUCKILY! I didn't swallow. I spat out my food and there was about 1/16 of an inch in thickness metal with sharp pointy ends. There was several in my mouth and upon further inspection in my sandwich there were more. I was SHOCKED!!!! I don't know how many I might of swallowed but even not swallowed thos sharp points could jab you in your gums but if swallowed it could tear or shred you throat, esphogaus your throat, cause internal bleeding, infections and who know what else.  Upon immediatelly discovering this metals in my mouth and in my swandwich as you can imagine I lost my appetiate. I not only lost my appetiate, I grow fearfull that I might of swallowed some, I still am. I took my sandwitch back and told them everything not only for my safety but for the safety of other people, who the hell knows whats in their food if not the same thing. I requested to speak to the manager. I waited and this fellow came by and I told him everything, and give him the sharps metal pieces, or atleals the ones I ddin't swallow. I told him about my fear and that I didn't feel good. I told him I wanted to find out how this sharp metal pieces ended up in my food. He said he would look into it and would let me know. Several weeks went by and this Public Relations lady called me never acknowleding sharp metals or telling him how they got in my sandwich, was fake and didn't know what she was even calling about. Again I told her I wanted to find out how this happened so this doesn't happen again. Well she said she would get back to me. Shortly after that I got a letter that didn't mention the incident nor an explaination about an investigation, basically saying that we had agreed to this gift $40 dollar gift card. I never agreed to that she LIED.  I wanted to know why those shart metal pieces were in my food and was concerned about my health and of those poor souls that were or will be eating in that restaurant or any of their other restaurnats . I NEVER used there stupid gift card and never will because I WOULD NEVER EAT AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY. They don't care about their customers all they tried to do cover their ASSES and pretent nothing happened. THEY THINK that people are that stupid that's what they thinkg of their customers. Never ming that I could have DIED or could still have internal injuries or other people could have been in the same situation as me except they never realized it. CHEESECAKE factory you suck and your EVIL bastards. I guess they think OH who cares if a  few people DIE or suffer injuries as long as nobody knows about it. NOW EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT and I WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD THE WORD EVERYWHERE TILL EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT  FOR THE AWFUL TREATMENT I RECEIVED."
Emily J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,,4.0,2/25/2010,"i always love cheesecake factory and this place is great too. but 4 stars because what I tried called spicy crispy beef didnt feel much more than panda express...... but everything else is delicious like usual. chees and artichoke, and grilled artichoke, thai wrap are my favorite appetizer. What can I say for their entries?.. Everything is nice but spicy crispy beef...................."
Jennifer M.,"San Jose, CA",211,377,316,2.0,5/5/2008,"We were shopping at the new Americana this weekend and feeling a bit peckish decided to have lunch at the new Cheesecake Factory, sigh!  I'm not a huge fan of this chain to begin with, the food is just alright and I can think of a lot better places to spend my money.  This Saturday I was in a group and I was out voted so Cheesecake Factory here we come.  The line was impossible which we expected since it was a new mall and half of Glendale seemed to be roaming about.  So finally we were seated and we ordered some drinks while we decided on what to order, it took nearly 20 min. just to get a diet coke.  This is a really large Cheesecake Factory, and I think that they don't have enough staff hired yet for the size of the restaurant, the staff that they do have appear to be new hires still learning the ropes.  After having to wait so long just to get sodas we asked people sitting nearby us how long the wait was for their food (almost an hour) ouch!  We decided to just pay for our drinks and left, so I can't tell you how the food is but I imagine it tastes like every other Cheesecake Factory.  I do have to say that while the waitstaff appeared overwhelmed I can't really blame them since they definitely could have used a few more hands on deck!  Overall I would advise people to try this place out only if you've got a lot of time on your hands because you will be here awhile."
Cynthia G.,"Glendale, CA",4,52,4,1.0,7/30/2011,"the food is so oily, ive been here about 6 times and each time ive left feeling disgusted. i wont be going there anymore"
