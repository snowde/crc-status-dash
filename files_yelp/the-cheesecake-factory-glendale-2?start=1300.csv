T'Marie D.,"Burbank, CA",134,5,1,4.0,4/23/2009,"I always have a great experience when visiting the Cheesecake Factory no matter which location I visit (Henderson, Sherman Oaks, Las Vegas, and now Glendale). The food is always amazing and I am always satisfied.  Now this one at the Americana is at a beautiful location, the staff was friendly and personable. Our original waitress was nice but then our 'real' waiter was introduced. Either she was covering for him on break or he just started his shift. He wasn't very attentive and left us alone for the majority of the meal. Instead of coming to our table to give us our bill he reach around the corner of the booth and peaked around to hand us the billfold. It was strange behavior to us. I enjoyed my selection (Steak Diane) but my fiance didn't enjoy his so much (Jambalaya). However we both enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken Blasts. LOVED LOVED LOVED 'em!! (I will try to recreate them, wish me luck!) Over all - I love that place."

Peter E.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/5/2009,"I went to this restaurant to celebrate 3 birthdays last night.  The waiting lobby only had a few people which allayed my fears of a long wait.  We had 9 people and our party and were told to expect a 40-45 minute wait for a table.  We ended up waiting more than 1 1/2 hours with no table in sight.  Apparently, the hostess was waiting for another large party to leave (they hung around for an hour after they were done eating).  I can't believe they couldn't find another place to seat us - they just kept waiting for this other party to leave.  To top if off, when a couple of people with us complained to the manager (or assistant manager), he did not believe that we were waiting that long.  So, there was no effort on his part to get us seated.  We ended up leaving and going to La Cubana on Maryland across from Tony Romas (actually more directly across a tux shop).  We got there 20 minutes before closing and they stayed open 40 minutes after closing.  Food was great!!!  Next time, no more Cheesecake Factory for me - the food is really not worth that wait.  Plus, at least, in this one, the employees/management don't seem to care that their customers are waiting for more than 1 hour (on a weeknight!!!) to get seated, much less start eating."
