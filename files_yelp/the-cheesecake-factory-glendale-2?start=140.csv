Mary F.,"Fresno, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/1/2017,"My daughter bought a slice of cheesecake yesterday. She didn't realize until today that the cashier failed to give her credit card back. She called to see if they had the credit card and was told yes. So she had to drive  a half hour to get the card that should have been returned to her. To make matters worse, she was sent to 3 different people, and had to wait 25 minutes to get the credit card. At one point a rude customer crowded in front of her, and although the cashier saw this, she helped him instead of my daughter. My daughter did not receive an apology. If I were the manager I would have apologized and given a complimentary gift card for the trouble that was caused by the cashier."
Claudia H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/2/2017,Service: I went on a Wednesday and we only waited like a minute to be seated (for two my boyfriend and myself). The gentleman helped us right away and was always checking in to make sure everything was good. They brought our food pretty quickly as well.  Food: They don't have a lot of vegan or vegetarian options but like for my boyfriend who eats anything he said the food and the cheesecake was great.  Overall: The place was clean and very beautiful! Compared to the one at the grove this location was so much better with their customer service. Yes I would come here again especially because my boyfriend loved it :)
Angela K.,"Glendale, CA",0,12,,5.0,6/2/2017,I love this place specially in the evenings  only problem is you cant make reservations
Ada A.,"Glendale, CA",74,33,6,4.0,4/25/2017,"Love Americana si much ! What a beautiful setting at the Amerikana ! In the middle of the Americana mall , probably the best place to at between that a Glendale Gallery and it's started to evening ! Service and food were great ! Very polite and caring staff ! i really like Cheesecake Factory!"
Armen R.,"Glendale, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/21/2017,Saturday night I had guests. I was the Americana way cheesecake factory in Glendale at the front door they were not polite I had to say sorry to my guests because of them after that the waiter came to ask for the tip instead of saying sorry and he brought the check before we were done eating.
Fred K.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",3,11,11,1.0,10/23/2016,Do I really have to wait until I leave to post this. I'm afraid to order.  First the people in the front told us we were lying about what time we got here.  Then we sit down after 65 minutes when initially promised 30-40. And now this ..... really?
Kat A.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,25,1,5.0,9/9/2017,Great service the food is delicious ! Our server was awesome she was very attentive and made sure we were pleased with the visit . I recommend this cheesecake . Awesome !
Jazmime A.,"Glendale, CA",1,22,50,4.0,1/17/2017,"I love coming to ""the Cheesecake Factory"" but honestly my only problem is the wait!! Wow I've been coming to cheesecake for many many years. I usually come here see the lines way to long and go to Pasadenas but the wait for 2 people was a 1 1/2 hours long.. the customer service is always amazing and fun.. and they have delicious food.lol"
Lauren S.,"Corona, CA",143,39,,1.0,7/23/2017,"If I could leave 0 stars I would. My husbands family is in town visiting from Illinois and we wanted to stop to have a good lunch and catch up. We ordered two salads, the salmon meal, and a burger. Our salads were brought out twice, both times still being wrong. We had to ask for refills on our drinks numerous times, and felt like we were basically just being ignored. We mentioned the issues to our server and the only response was she's sorry. We asked to speak to a manager and no one ever came out. Horrible customer service, it's not okay to make a customer feel as if they are an inconvenience, and that what we ordered doesn't matter."
Joshua K.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,5,,5.0,8/31/2017,Best service that Jeffery gave to us. He made sure that our needs were satisfied and even offered more than an employee can offer. Will not forget my done with this Cheesecake Factory branch. Thank you once again Jeffery. :)
Ivy D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,10,,1.0,9/16/2017,"The most horrible service I have ever seen amongst Cheescake factory. Hands down THE WORST service, impolite staff and just CHAOS! And I have been to many many Cheescake Factories across the country. This one doesn't even deserve one star!"
Ines L.,"Los Angeles, CA",397,92,258,2.0,12/28/2016,"Overs years living in the US, first time ever in one of their severals locations! The wait wasn't so bad only 15/20mins witch was a good start, promptly seated. Then no interest from our server for some longs minutes, I assumed they were busy at this time but you can at least say ""Hi, I'll be right back with you guys"".. We got served in less than 10mins, fast for sure but I can tell you with the size of the menu and the number of items they are serving they are using frozen food. It really makes me feel inconfortable to say that but it's the truth, I can't understand why restaurant are keeping a huge menu just to cook frozen food to their customers. Sorry, first and last time ever."
Naomi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,41,,4.0,7/7/2017,"It's a tradition for me to come here every year for my birthday. The portions at Cheesecake never fail to disappoint. Our favorites include the orange chicken, meatloaf, Renee's special, most of their sandwiches, and the chicken piccata.  The ambiance is nice and dimly lit for a romantic atmosphere. Be warned, during dinner hours expect to wait 30-45 minutes for a table.  A disappointing downside is that they always seem to sit us at the back of the restaurant in the brunt ends of the booths facing the kitchen. It's been off putting a few times to be situated in the poor seats.  Also, Drake has those lyrics about ""why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?"" Well, the last time we were there some spoiled teenagers created a commotion, yelling at the waitress and demanding service. It was distasteful and the manager had to come out and intervene. You get crowds like this sometimes."
Markie S.,"Montrose, CA",112,16,,1.0,10/21/2017,"Today was my worst experience in this dump. All I did is order ahead for takeout and they had me wait for an additional half an hour besides their ""estimated"" 20-25 minute preparation time. The hosts do not have a clue about what it is to accommodate their guests/clients. I asked them for assistance and all they did is brush me off. If you do not want to work in a busy restaurant then find some other occupation. No one has to deal with your unhappiness. Moving on, if you know that Saturday nights are your busiest especially at a location like the Americana...why would you only have one person manning the cash register??? Not only is he getting bombarded by unexpected questions but he also has to receive the attitude and bitchiness of annoyed guests. I feel bad for the poor man. I'm sure he's getting a pittance of wage. Lastly, I really don't understand what the point was of ordering ahead when by the time I got home...the food was as cold as dog's nose. Take a lesson from the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove and Pasadena and learn how to run a place. Oh, and let's not forget the angry waitress who dropped some glasses and yelled, ""what are you laughing at, nothing to see here""."
Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",756,493,2422,5.0,6/15/2016,"I took my two little ones out for the afternoon and took them to Americana, hoping that the grass area would be open for them to run around, but unfortunately it wasn't.  So we walked around and walked around and I had to feed my little ones, and didnt know what to get.  One of them said that they will be okay with mac n cheese, so Cheesecake Factory it was!!  I was in a huge rush cause my little ones sleep pretty early and it was already late afternoon... So I tell our waitress, Nikki, that I have literally 20 minutes to order, eat, pay and leave!  She looked worried but handled it like a champ!! (THANKS NIKKI!!) So I ordered two mac n cheese and a chicken tenders.  She brought out bread while we wait for the food (which they downed, lol... We're Armenian, we love bread! lol).  Then she quickly brought out the food and off we go... made the kids stuff their faces as fast as possible. Which the food tasted freakin awesome!!  I got whatever the kids couldn't finish and put it in a box, paid and took off!   The food was awesome, the service was awesome, the ambiance/environment in this place is awesome... nothing I could complain about!  Its a wonderful spot! Bread is free Drinks were $6 Food was $18 Feeding my kids and getting in and out of there in time... priceless."
Brandon I.,"Monrovia, CA",47,95,34,3.0,3/11/2017,"This was my first time to this specific location so this review is meant for this location only. Came here on an early Friday evening so we had no wait time which was nice. Our waiter was OK, didn't seem to really want to be there and wasn't too interested in serving us. Food was OK as well, both my wife and I order the combination steak Diane and herb salmon. Salmon was undercooked a bit and steak was under cooked as well being we requested well done.  Like I said, this review is for this specific location, I've been to other locations and have had better service and better food!! Kind of disappointing being that this location is in the Americana!"
Evelyn B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,13,3.0,8/7/2017,"1st and foremost, The Cheesecake Factory is a top-notch place to meet friends and family and to have dinner. Always has been and I suspect, always will be!  But the thing is... THE WAIT. Sheesh, we really have to wait almost an hour to be seated inside or out.  Fortunately, we are issued a device that alerts us when our table is ready, which again, is nice.  Thanks."
Brendan K.,"Glendale, CA",0,30,,1.0,1/30/2017,"This review is of their Sunday brunch service and is written in context of my having worked in restaurant management for 4+ years. If you're looking for a place for brunch, don't eat here.  Although Cheesecake Factory's evening service is usually passing, especially considering their high volume, their Sunday brunch service reeks of a non-committal attitude by the staff, broken management, and a dispassionate kitchen team.  In a single meal, the restaurant broke several best practice rules in restaurant operation, leaving me to believe the business is struggling with how to provide service during their non-peak hours. Burnt food, forgotten drink orders, cold potatoes, and a confrontational waitress round out a number of cardinal sins committed by the brunch team which will go down as one of the worst I've ever seen.  I could go into greater detail, but when the chef plates a charred english muffin under a cold eggs benedict, a server brings it to the table, and a manager still charges you for the meal, you've got serious back-end problems plaguing what could otherwise be an enjoyable, high quality brunch.   My advice to you is to go somewhere else. My advice to Cheesecake Factory is to expect more of yourself."
Marcela H.,"Los Angeles, CA",179,291,186,4.0,6/23/2016,"Sometimes you just need a cozy booth, a great dessert, and some girltalk.  That's exactly what a friend and I found at the Cheesecake Factory while doing a bit of window shopping at the Americana. Service was on point, the lemon meringue cheesecake we shared was heaven on earth, and the complimentary bread 'n butter was irresistible.  Pro-tip:  Free parking in the Galleria structure on Broadway, just west of Brand."
Jamie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",707,289,679,5.0,10/9/2015,"I love the location of this place. It's in the Americana so you can either walk around as you're waiting for a table, or you can walk around after you eat because you will be so full. This place is always busy but I know why.  This is a great place to go for a romantic dinner because the ambience is dark and there are candles on the tables and if you sit outside there is a view of the fountain with the water show. You can also come here for group events or birthdays and they will sing happy birthday to you.  I always get some sort of pasta. Of course I love their bread as well not just because it's free, but the Brown bread with oats is my favorite because it is so fluffy and delicious with butter :-) my favorite is the four cheese pasta and the chicken marsala"
