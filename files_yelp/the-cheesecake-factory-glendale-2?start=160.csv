Chris D.,"Irvine, CA",2116,313,52,5.0,12/11/2016,"500 Stars not 5 stars.  We obviously know about the food and many choices, but what some don't know is the unmatched integrity and service of their staff. My girlfriend and I ate here on Saturday night, we had an amazing meal and were talking about our vacation to Costa Rica the upcoming Tuesday. (We have been planning this trip for some time)  The next morning we woke and realized she had forgotten her purse in the booth we were sitting at. She had her ID, cards, $1000 in cash (for trip) and most importantly her passport inside her purse.  The ONE vacation we were able to plan/save for just came to a screeching holt. When we went the next day to ask the manager if the purse was found we weren't sure what to expect.  The cleaning crew had turned-in the purse with everything still intact and every cent there. Thank you cheesecake factory, you forever earned two customers for a lifetime and it really wasnt even for the food.  TFR"
Eun H.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",459,528,640,4.0,10/6/2015,So happy they added super food to their menu!  It would've been better if they disclosed the calories though. Tried two salads from the superfoods section. Forgot the name but one was like a Mediterranean salad and the other was mexican inspired salad. Dressing for both salad was thick and heavy. So glad i got the dressing on the side. I also like items on their skinnylicious menu!
Michele B.,"CA, CA",0,52,21,5.0,8/27/2017,"Yesterday, I ate there with friends outside. I had a delicious meal of grilled salmon with white rice and corn succotash.  I am lactose intolerant so I asked for a substitute sauce instead of the tartar. I got the miso glaze which was delicious to eat by itself. I also had the Blood Orange Margarita on the rocks with a salted rim.  My friend had the Chicken Marsala where the waitress shaved cheese over it. Our waitress is from Maine and has a delightful personality and smile. We had a nice view of the water show at the fountain while we enjoyed our delicious meal."
Shahrooz G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",11,9,1,5.0,4/10/2017,Very nice place; Very Polite and Caring staff; Good quality. I really like CheeseCacke Factory @ Americana
Kate A.,"Valencia, CA",0,30,,2.0,8/27/2017,"Was a little disappointed in my favorite restaurant last night. I ordered lemon garlic shrimp and always get 6 shrimps . This time I only got 4 and for $18 that's not fair. Also, the bathroom was trashed. At 6:00 toilet paper all over the floor and none in the stalls. I had to go tell the hostess . Not okay. Trash was full , looked like no one came to clean for hours . The Glendale manager called with lots if excuses and no real apology. He kept saying , these things happen time to time. Very unprofessional!"
Giovanna A.,"Pomona, CA",1,11,1,1.0,11/4/2017,"Ordered a burger and the meat had no seasoning, it was bland overall but the fries were good but I didn't pay 15 bucks for some fries. Also I know we had a big party and separating checks is hard but she forgot to give my friend her check which is understandable since we were a big group  but when we  told her about it she was totally rude. She also forgot my check and I realize that my change was only three bucks but I wanted to make sure if it was enough for the tip or if I had to put more  I honestly forgot what my total was, when she gave me my check she was like your change is three dollars but emphasizing the three and when she gave my friend her 12 bucks of change she told me again "" I gave you back your three dollars right"" and again emphasizing the three. Before the whole issue with the check we asked  her if she could validate our parking and she said she would but when I used it I still had to pay the total amount for parking. This is my first time going to the cheesecake factory and honestly if they can't even get a ""classic"" burger right and having to deal with a waitress trying to make me feel bad for asking for my change I don't think I'll ever step foot in a cheesecake factory"
Joseph M.,"Burbank, CA",4,32,26,1.0,8/17/2017,"Last 2 times we came here, service at this place became horrible. Waiters take orders without writing it down and they mess it up by forgetting what you ordered. It was a good place before but service is sh*t now. Time for new management."
Jackie E.,"Glendale, CA",0,10,1,3.0,8/24/2017,"The service hasnt been the best the few times I've come here. But at least the Lindas Chocolate Cake is good. It's my favorite chocolate cake, it's very rich and never dry."
Shelly G.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,117,168,3.0,6/9/2016,"Nothing to rave about. The food was average, wait time was short from ordering to delivery to table , my waitress was Naomi (very nice girl), don't order the cucumber lemonade, I don't understand how that's a favorite..its diabetes in a glass with sugar around the rim. I returned it for a glass of water. The bread was cold and hard...from the looks of it none of the guests ate the bread either...it may have been recycled.  I ordered shrimp pasta thing and he got the chicken fettuchini. Both dishes were okay, nothing to thank the chef  about. I've had better at a mom and pops corner store. Finally the cheesecake I got white chocolate raspberry truffle and him carrot cake cheese cake. Both were blah, again nothing I couldn't get at a bakery in the hood. Am I going back, no. I just wanted to cross it off my list."
Alina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,46,24,3.0,6/12/2016,"Good spot for a lunch break. The menu selection is huuuge, I mean really huge. However, this place is always overcrowded and the wait time is too long. I found ordering food online is a less stressful option, yet still there is no guarantee the food will arrive on time. Then I guess we all need to stay home and cook ourselves. Oh well, there is drive thru option at some places, too. The bottom line for Cheesecake Factory is that   It's better coming here during the week in the morning when no one is in there. Bon appetite.  Besides all the waiting time, my food was delicious this time I was here."
Mish S.,"Long Beach, CA",380,500,678,4.0,1/27/2017,"They are so packed, all the time. High calorie but high satisfaction alert!!  Their food selection is great and they have a huge menu with amazing deserts but they dont let you reserve so you have no choice but to wait 30-50 minutes evrytime you want to dine here. Sometimes you get lucky and if you ask for outdoor seating after 7:45pm you're probably going to have a chance at getting a table Their deserts are delicious and their food is amazing, their selection of pastas is impressive and I am never usually dissapointed but I feel the last visit their food quality declined, the pastas were all glued and bundled up from undercooking and their sauce was just way too salty. I love their sphaghetti and meatballs and Ive tried their carbonara and loved it."
Pierre D.,"North Hills, CA",1,7,6,1.0,11/13/2017,"Ok we have been going to Cheesecake Factory in Passadena for a long long time when we didn't have one in Americana. We used to love this place and used to dine there on a regular basis, but I guess this time they lost us as a customer after giving it so many chances. This time took an hour to get us a table which is ok I understand  they're very busy. After that we ordered our appetizer and main meal @  the same time, and we asked the waiter specifically to bring our appetizer first, which didn't happened and he brought everything at the same time, ok no big deal then asked for a ranch ,10 minutes later I had to remind him again, and he sorry I'll bring it right now, that didn't happen ask another waitress and finally she brought it after my daughter Frech frys were cold. Then my wife asked for extra sauce on the side for her Fettuccine pasta ,after another 10 minutes they brought a disgusting bowl of oil which they called sauce. We didn't want the past anymore, and instead my wife asked for a bottle of mineral water and that took another 10 minutes to bring, and when I asked what was going on. Waitress told us he had to pick it up from the bar like any other drinks that's why it took a long time to bring it. Obviously they don't care since they are very busy, and since customer service does not mean anything to them. They will loose a lot of customer slowly but surely unless they do something about it. So sad that we are not going to go there anymore."
JC A.,"Glendale, CA",25,14,8,4.0,12/25/2016,"I read Krissy's review and I had the same experience.  He was black (he just happened to be black) and he did not even say a word - simple things like you're welcome, after I said thanks, or have a nice day after I had my ticket validated. People like him have no business being stationed ""in front"" -  maybe he needs to be in the kitchen or stock room or some place else where basic personal manners are not required.   I almost said something not nice to him but thankfully my wife just told me to let it go.  No manners!!!!"
Veronica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,5,5.0,4/13/2017,This is my first time going to TCF & my experience was great. The only thing I regret is ordering the nachos. They're American styled with very thick mixture of cheeses. I felt like I asked for that one who orders nachos at a pasta place? Aside from that the mixed drinks were amazing and so was the dessert. The service was good. We also went at an earlier time because as we were leaving it got extremely busy. I had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake it was amazing. I had a Strawberry Daiquiri for my mixed drink and a Pink Lemonade with vodka.
Peace R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,3/18/2017,I used to love their factory chopped salad. It used to be made with crisp fresh lettuce.  Not anymore! It came to the table and most of the lettuce was brown. Like it was weeks old lettuce.  I wanted to tell them to take it back but  didn't but I left disappointed and thought what a waste of my money because they charge about 12.50 for the salad.  I'll never go back there.  Had a lemonade that was good though.... That's why I gave them two stars.
Seta A.,"Glendale, CA",326,435,688,2.0,8/3/2015,"What happened to the consistency of the dishes? Hmmm.... so disappointed during our last stop at this perfectly located Cheesecake...  The line is always long, especially on a Saturday, so we did the bar. BUT what a disappointing meal(s)... The chicken quesadilla seemed like it was microwaved with no tact in wrapping or presenting it... my green garden salad was OK but again the chicken looked like it was still frozen and not grilled at all...  My drink was almost lemon-y with no Bacardi in it - just like Coke and lemon~! The bartenders were more interested in talking to each other, rather than socializing somewhat with the guests, - usually that's why people sit at the bar, right? Open to ""hi what's going on, busy night or something...""  The grilled artichokes were good... but that's it. I love going to this Cheesecake... but they gotta up their game. The experience was like, ""here you go, drink, eat and leave."""
Paola N.,"Los Angeles, CA",822,351,1645,5.0,7/27/2015,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. THE AMBIANCE: This is my most frequented location. The restaurant is clean, spacious, and has high ceilings. I tend to sit at the bar and there is ample room to enjoy a meal. THE FOOD: The Cheesecake Factory starts you off with a complimentary basket of warm white and wheat bread. The wheat bread (brown) is to die for and I usually request that we get a basket of all wheat bread because I don't like wasting food and the white bread rarely gets eaten. That is how good the brown wheat bread is.  My favorite appetizers are the Ahi Carpaccio (Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto, Creamy Avocado and Togarashi Aioli), and Crispy Crab Wontons (Crabmeat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts, and Sweet Chili Sauce Fried Crisp in Wonton Wrappers). The Ahi Carpaccio I can eat sometimes as my lunch entree if I am not that hungry because I always eat a lot of bread and butter at the beginning *guilty* It is soooo good. I usually ask for light wasabi pesto. The Togarashi Aoili on the side is beyond delicious. You just want to drink it. The Crispy Crab Wontons are so good and so fattening but I don't care. I would literally eat them all if someone else wasn't picking at the plate.  My favorite entrees are: Chicken Madeira (Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes), Miso Salmon (Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice (make it brown rice!!) and Miso Sauce), and the Chicken Di Pana (Lightly Breaded Sauteed Chicken Breast Served over a White Wine Butter Sauce with Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli).  The only plate I tried and didn't like was the Thai Lettuce Wraps (Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three (3) Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew). I am a big fan of P.F. Chang's Lettuce Wraps and these lettuce wraps don't even compare. It is like night and day. I would never order them again. My favorite cheesecake is the Key Lime! Perfection. All of their cheesecakes are on point. THE TIPS: Don't forget to validate your parking ticket!"
Melinda S.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,,3.0,8/28/2017,"The really long waiting periods can get annoying, however, the skinny menu has some tasteful options to choose from. We get the Ahi Tuna plate that comes with a salad."
Val D.,"Los Angeles, CA",465,160,786,4.0,5/18/2016,"I usually avoid commercial restaurants but my husband and I were given a gift certificate to The Cheesecake Factory and decided to go for lunch this afternoon. Upon first glance, the menu seems to have so many options! I had a hard time deciding between the firecracker salmon, Vietnamese shrimp spring rolls, angel hair pasta, and grilled avocado club, but ultimately decided on the veggie burger with a gluten free bun.  I love the company's history, mission statement, and their goal to make each meal custom how you like it. The ambience is nice and I also love the courtesy bread.  The food... Was delicious. My husband ordered a margarita pizza, and the crust was absolutely perfect. My burger was a mouthful filled with all the right fixings. I appreciate the presentation as well - with the little cups of Ketchup and separate container for the fries.  Our server was great. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I was still working on my food when he snatched the plate from beneath me. I still had food in my hand thinking maybe he was going to put the rest in a box? Nope. Overall our experience was good and I'd recommend it to anyone shopping at the Glendale Galleria."
Catherine K.,"Palos Verdes Estates, CA",18,13,2,1.0,6/8/2017,"Well, our waiter was on the  top of giving us the service that barely deserves 1 star, I wish I could give it 0! Basically after I finished my salad and asked to box it to go he took my plate with the fork on it and the fork dropped on the floor , he picked it up and put it back on the plate!!!!! He put dirty fork from the floor back on the plate with my salad! Unbelievable! I called manager and she said they will make the new one, afterwards he brought the new salad and acted like I was being a bitch and it was not a big deal to him. There were twice as less salad in the box than it was left on my plate. Very disappointed."
