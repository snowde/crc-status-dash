Min Young S.,"Glendale, CA",52,1,,1.0,3/29/2017,"worst experience ever... We order 4 dishes and everything was good as usual except steak.  I asked for medium however, steak came out as outer ring was burned and fully cooked and center ring was rare. asked waitress what happened to my steak... she sighed then told me that that's perfect medium should be... um.. what?   i am not talking about outside and inside/center layer... explained again and showed her again.  she gave me ""look"" and repeat herself... that's what medium is. What??   i didn't touch all the burned 2/3 of steak.  don't order steak here or question. you will get look down."

John D.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/1/2017,Visited here on a Tuesday and this place continues to be my favorite restaurant. The location here is great because it is in the Americana which is a very cool complex and the wait was not very long. The service was top-notch and the food was amazing! The Oreo cheesecake is incredible! 10/10 would highly recommend!!
Michael K.,"Glendale, CA",275,73,90,5.0,12/21/2016,"My go-to Cheesecake Factory! Honestly, I don't know of any Cheesecake location that I haven't liked, and even though I'm not a huge Cheesecake person, my wife is and she loves this place! Love the selections, close to the Glendale Galleria, and the bread though!"
Amber H.,"Long Beach, CA",133,29,59,5.0,2/1/2017,"Had the beet and goat cheese salad which was enjoyable.  I wouldn't recommend the avocado toast, too much bread; perhaps on a whole wheat or grain bread would be more suitable than a baguette. For each is their own, I guess. Overall it was a pleasant night and the service was satisfactory."
Tay P.,"Tujunga, Tujunga, CA",87,1,1,5.0,3/23/2017,I made a yelp account just to write this lol  I've been coming here since I was a kid and they've always been extremely nice and high quality food :)
M Nicole G.,"West Covina, CA",27,19,17,5.0,8/18/2017,We had an amazing dinner here! Love the food Love the service Love the place ! I just can't ask for more. I enjoyed having dinner with friends and we had lots of fun and laughs.
Charissa I.,"Burbank, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/7/2017,"We came here to celebrate my best friend's birthday. We've always liked The Cheesecake Factory but this time, we were so annoyed and disappointed. We got seated a little after 6:30pm. We put in our order right away because I have my 5yo with us. We ordered the simplest dish for my kid -- spaghetti in pink sauce. To make the long story short, at 8PM, we still didn't have our food. We suspect that our waitress, Erin N., went on a break, completely forgot about us or didn't assign anyone who will check on us. She walked back to our table after 1.5 hours saying, ""where is your food?"". Mind you, the spaghetti came last, several minutes after all 3 dishes and she said, they messed up the sauce! Of course, after we were done, it took another 20 minutes for her to bring back the check and another 10 minutes to run the card.  Let's not talk about not providing us with any water refill, not giving us the butter that we requested that we ended up not eating the bread because it was already hard, that we asked another waiter for extra forks and a different waiter for cheese for the spaghetti and she forgot the box after we handed her the payment :( It was supposed to be a happy occasion but the service just ruined it all. We didn't have the time and the energy to order dessert or sing happy birthday. A 3-hour dinner on a not so busy Thursday night, especially when there is a kid, is just unacceptable."
Jerrick T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,1.0,8/7/2017,"FRONT DESK IS EXTREMELY RUDE!! Dude with a man bun is a D**K and ignored us as if we weren't valued customers. Waited in line for 20 minutes when there was no one else around! watched 4 groups walk in after us and got seated before we did, now there's something wrong with that. Terrible customer service, when we asked about our table they gave us the generic, ""just wait to the side they'll call you over."" When we got seated they gave us a booth all the way in the back BUT, the booth seat was broken!! Cushion seemed to be ripped off by previous customers, along with dirty utensils By far the worst cheesecake location/experience I've had yet."
Eric G.,"Lancaster, CA",793,7,196,4.0,11/3/2016,Really good cheesecake factory compared to most.  I love this place and it seems like I go here every week...It's one of the few restaurants that seem to have EVERYTHING.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's always busy and sometimes the waiters could forget about you when you want to get out (movies is right next door).
Rosy D.,"Burbank, CA",71,6,5,5.0,5/25/2017,Omg best service ever!!! GILBERT IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST WAITER IVE EVER HAD!! He truly cared about serving our every need and was sooo attentive the entire time! He has such a positive attitude and spirit (keep in mind it was 12am)!!! We left him a 40$ tip because he made our dinner 10x better!!!
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,3.0,7/16/2017,Who came in for our favorite Chinese chicken salad and had great service by Courtney. A nice place to come and escape the Heat
Arpa G.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,3,3.0,8/5/2017,The food was good the cheese cake was amazing but I saw 2 cockroaches and that was very disturbing. I didn't like the pizza but my sister said the hamburger was good so five star food but those cockroaches were disgusting!
Remy O.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,13,,5.0,7/28/2017,"David the bartender gave exceptional service on all fronts. The restaurant was very busy & we were patrons at the bar; he was so attentive and accommodating even though we were just there for drinks and apps. It was refreshing to have genuinely friendly service, especially in a large restaurant on a busy night."
Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,4.0,6/23/2015,"We had a great father's day lunch here. We knew the wait would be long and they quoted us an hour. However we were seated about 30 minutes later. Our server was friendly and pretty attentive. He struggled keeping up with all the drinks at the table but that is to be expected when a restaurant is slammed. I didn't like how the food was brought out. Everyone received their plates except for the two of us. So then there was that awkward momement when no one wanted to start eating until we got our dishes...Everyone waited a bit and then finally our burgers arrived and we all dug in. Other than that...the food was great. I always get overwhelmed with their novel of a menu. I settled on the bacon bacon cheeseburger, protein style with a side salad and blue cheese dressing. My burger was cooked perfectly, seasoned nicely and lettuce wrapped expertly. The creamy american and cheddar cheeses mixed with cripsy bacon and slab of pork belly quite nicely. Hands down a great burger."
Laila M.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",107,120,34,5.0,1/17/2017,"Their food is not bad but my fav dish is chicken bellagio. I LOVE their cheesecake its just amazing & the outside patio is very cute.  I am a regular here & never had any problems with this place,"
Altravece A.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,10,2,5.0,8/1/2017,"Drove out to Glendale to go shopping at the Disney Baby Store and decided to stop at grab a quick bite to eat with my friends. I have to just say that our experience was beyond exceptional!!!!! From the moment we sat down until the moment we left. Ben, our server was so welcoming. He was great at everything, I mean everything! The customer service that Ben has cannot be taught. He has a servant's heart and that's something that you're born with. Ben didn't know that this was my fist day out after being really sick and in and out the hospital for the past week. He didn't know how much energy it took for me to even be there. All he knew was that he was our server and he wanted to make sure that we had a great experience. We order a cheesecake and he had them write ""Part of your World"" around the plate because I had an Ariel shirt on and we were talking about how much I loved Disney everything. He made my day!!!! P.S. PJ, the manager is amazing as well!!!!!!! Thank you sooo much!!!!"
Lusine A.,"Glendale, CA",4,10,36,1.0,5/7/2017,Why is it that when you dine in the restaurant they make sure to serve you what you order but when you order every time it has to be something missing. My salad dressing was missing the salad was so dry and this is not the 1st time.
Linette P.,"Los Angeles, CA",387,603,2111,5.0,6/13/2015,"One of my favorite locations, actually my favorite! This place never misses a beat or drops the ball. Service is always on point and I love the views here.  I love when I'm able to make it to happy hour here! If you are able to make it Monday-Friday 4-6 do it!!!"
Dhiren K.,"Glendale, CA",15,23,130,5.0,10/24/2016,"No matter how busy this place is. We always had a good welcome and great service. Food is top notch, n cakes are our favorite! Even the coffee is pretty good."
