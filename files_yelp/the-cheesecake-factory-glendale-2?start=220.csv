Gayaneh A.,"Glendale, CA",229,161,190,1.0,3/25/2017,"This place has lost its integrity. It has such a high volume of business with a wide variety of foods, it has lost its need to actually care. I refuse to go back. After years and years of patronage that hour wait is definitely not worth it. I'd rather give my business to small businesses. No one really cares about relationships and service. It's really systematic, in and out. In addition DO NOT, DO NOT order to go especially via DoorDash. Horrendous experience. They essentially didn't pack 4 of the 9 items, spilled all the drinks because they ran out of cup holders and had patty paper in the burger. Best part of this is they took ZERO responsibility. A big no for Cheesecake."
Katie L.,"Covina, CA",741,256,638,5.0,4/9/2015,"I LOOOOOOVE the happy hour menu! $5.95 for my favorite appetizers! Say whaat?!?!  I got a margarita, avocado rolls, and crab meat and cream cheese wontons! Holy fudge! All under $16!!! What?!?! Cheesecake Factory can be affordable too?! DAMN!  I brought some leftovers home to my mother, since the portions were normal sizes, I couldn't finish! My mom loved the appetizers and wants to go to Cheesecake Factory to try out other menu options! I'll definitely bring her to Cheesecake the next time I go! Definitely worth the price for the quality and quantity!  I'm a happy yelper for this place! (:  Service is marvelous and If you need more sweet bread, they're generous with how much they give you! Of course I needed a bunch to soak in the alcohol I'll be consuming throughout happy hour!

Jose G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,14,1.0,10/17/2016,"Let me start by saying their staff at the door are arrogant when they greet you! They junk they're doing you a favor.. second, food is not that great so what I usually order is the Thai lettuce wrap, very good!... what really struck me was that they are actually suggesting a 22% gratuity when their restaurant is not even a 3 or 4 star!!!!... I have never seen a suggested 22% gratuity on any high end restaurant!.. such ass ostreros la buca, moza osteria, bestia, etc. Not even at Patina in DTLA.... if you are suggesting 22% gratuity you better make sure your service is flawless and high quality food, AND....... NOT A CHAIN RESTAURANT LIKE Mac Donald's!"
Ricky C.,"Burbank, CA",5,13,11,4.0,6/1/2017,"The Glendale location is my second favorite location. That is because parking there is not the best. It is easier to park at the galleria across the street and walk to the factory. Wait times for a table are not that bad, average wait time is about 15 minutes with a full house. I think waiting for the food takes longer. Now the service I received the past few times I have gone is pretty good. There is a server by the name of Kevin who always gives great service. My big complaint about this place is the food. There's too much on the menu and I don't know what their signature dish is. I guess that's not a bad thing. Anyways this place is great and I would recommend anyone to go there."
Rob M.,"Glendale, CA",2,77,24,1.0,6/29/2017,I just came out shocked once again! Like last time i asked for manager and told him that burger was burned fully and he smoothly replied that they had issues with kitchen ! They did not even apologize i think it was my last time stepping into this place again! Worse customer service ! Worse management! Need training with all management and employees!
Thomas B.,"Altadena, CA",0,14,1,2.0,7/16/2017,Food was excellent. Service not so good. Waitress needs a lesson in time management. I always enjoy the ambiance.
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,3.0,2/22/2016,"This is a good sized Cheesecake, but because it's at the Americana, it's always packed! If you think you're going to get a seat in under an hour, you're probably going to be disappointed. However, once you do have your seat, service and food is on par just like all the other locations.  Oh, but just note that they don't put the price of their mixed drinks. Most of them cost $11.50. Keep that in mind."
Katie L.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,1,1,1.0,5/30/2017,"I've never left a review at yelp before, but I think have to leave one now. I have to say that I really like the cheesecake factory restaurants however I think this is the worst location. This is my second time dining in here at the Americana and I had the worst experiences for both. First time here, there was a roach on our table. We were so disgusted and lost appetite and so we decided to leave without finishing 1/4 of our dishes. We called the manager, but as he tried to catch it it disappeared behind the seat we were seating. He couldn't catch it and it made us to feel more disgusted. I didn't leave a review at that time because the manager told us that we didn't have to pay for our bill. That was about 6 months ago.  I thought I'd never coming back to this store, but we came shopping yesterday to Americana and my friends wanted to dine here. So we dined here for the second time yesterday. This time, it was the quality of food and service we received that disappointed us. Our server seemed like he's been working for only few months and seemed very unprofessional. It took him forever to get what we asked for. We didn't even get the utensils until we received our first dish. We asked for new side plates since some of the plates given were dirty. He came back with wet dishes which seemed like he tried poured some water on them. We were really hungry and stressed by long waiting. We didn't want to get stressed by complaining and the attitude of our server made us speechless. So we decided to just wipe the dishes and eat. We ordered a pasta davinci and a hibachi steak. Pasta da vinci was very dry and tasted like nothing and very oily on the bottom. Hibachi steak was all burnt. We were so disappointed because these two are our favorites from the restaurant and we know how it's supposed to taste like. I really wanted to like this place because we come here often to shop and we really like the restaurant, but these two experiences, I think I'll never come back to this location."
Tee L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,58,1.0,2/4/2017,"Dear Glendale Cheesecake Factory management, This review is written in regards to the table wait time. Let it be noted that our party of three entered your location during an off hour time today while your waiting area was practically empty (so empty that I was not given a pager and was only asked for my name). Customers who we knew were before us were being called by name and were taken to tables. As new customers entered the restaurant requesting for tables your hosts began handing out pagers. Still waiting for our table, noticing that now only customers who have pagers were being called to be seated, I approached a male host and explained that I was there earlier and not given a pager but only my name. He checked the computer, looked and me, then handed me a pager and told me it would be a 15 minute wait. I returned to my party and informed them of our status and we were in disbelief. Our party had already waited 30 minutes before the rush of new customers came in. Then to have the new customers seated before us, the apathetic attitude of the male host, and being told we had additional wait time for a table, our party chose to leave. Cheesecake Factory prides itself on customer service, and this incident has been both disappointing and unprofessional."
Tom C.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,309,497,5.0,3/22/2017,"We had a great experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory. It's in a large area of Glendale called The Americana. The area is Simply Beautiful! The Cheesecake Factory Store itself as beautiful as well, very clean and very well staff. Everybody was overly nice and the food was terrific. This will be our go to Cheesecake Factory from now on."
Liezl E.,"Long Beach, CA",159,496,230,1.0,8/8/2016,"Cheesecake factory. I normally love you, but tonight you failed me. First of all, we were seated at a booth where no server made contact for drinks or bread or anything for 15 minutes. Eventually, I had to get up and go to the hostess stand to inquire about our server. A manager (I'm guessing) walked me back to my booth where she promptly apologized and served us up our drinks. Okay, cool. No big deal. Then we waited again... for 10 minutes... until a server finally came over and apologized and brought us some bread. We gave her our food order (a sandwich and an appetizer) and then waited another 15-20 minutes for our food.  While we waited, no check up on our table.  We get our food and are finally finishing up when A GODDAMN ROACH crawls out from the crack between the table and the wall. A fucking german roach... so I am very sure there are more roach buddies hanging out nearby. I searched reviews and because I love cheesecake factory, was going to suggest avoiding any and all booths and opt to eat outside, but apparently roaches are also a problem out there... so sorry guys, I'm out of ideas.  I can give a pass for bad service because servers sometimes have bad days... but roaches? FUCK THAT SHIT. PARKING: 90 minute validation with purchase."
Razmik O.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",23,10,6,1.0,5/11/2017,"Disappointing and low quality restaurant in Glendale. Cold dishes, and dirty glasses."
Priscilla M.,"Bakersfield, CA",107,76,136,5.0,11/7/2016,"We love Cheesecake Factory! Rosio served us today and she was very attentive, went back twice because we asked for the wrong side sauce still with a smile on her face. Love the location, if you're in a hurry I do not recommend, but their in a shopping center so it's fun to walk around after your meal. Great cheesecakes!"
Selina N.,"Burbank, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/25/2017,"This review is solely based on their service and not their food. Some of the staff is very sweet and some are very rude, it's always a hit or miss. If you call them they either don't answer or when they do they put you on a hold for minimum 10-15 min. I have been here multiple times and I have ordered from them personally for pick up and also from multiple 3rd party companies like ""postmates"" and I have been fed up with them the last 2 times I ordered. I ordered a chicken Depana a while back when they were still serving this dish (very upset about that,) and when the item arrived it was missing the mashed potatoes. When I called to tell them that, they told me it was impossible and that the dish came with it. I explained I knew it came with it because that was the only dish I ever ordered but it was missing. They basically told me I'm lying and hung up on me. The second time I tried to order through postmates. I ordered everything and got a confirmation and then 20 mins later my order has been cancelled due to ""merchant  being too busy to take orders"" what does that even mean? You open your doors at 11am how are you too busy at 11:30am to take orders? I order frequently so I know bread is complimentary so When I ask for bread when I call to order for a pick up I would assume you would provide it but no. There service is just terrible!"
Scott M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",48,125,1,5.0,2/12/2017,"I know it's been said before (according to management) but Grant should be employee of the year. Outstanding service with a great smile. Anyone who can keep up with this early Saturday dinner party of 6 is pure gold. Hard to say if we ever had a better time. Take any average place with average food coupled with great service and you have a great restaurant. Food done well.  If there was any negative I would say the automatic dimming of lights at 5:15 pm. The night manager referred to it as ambiance lighting but we all agreed it was dark. I asked if we could pay for extra electricity. Maybe a hand generator at each table where guests could crank their own power would be an option. Couldn't read the dessert menu or see the faces of the others, good thing I know who was there. As luck would have it I had my trusty light meter and although I had a ceiling light directly over me showing about 10 lumens the rest of the table was less than 1 and it was a big table (in comparison a candle in front of you is about 12, the same candle 1 meter away is 1),. Jokes went around and we agreed that this would be a memory not soon forgotten. The day the lights went out at Cheesecake."
Cindy Z.,"San Francisco, CA",866,705,1110,5.0,1/18/2016,"I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, especially when it's located in a such a prominent location at The Americana --that definitely adds to the eating experience here. The boyfriend and I decided to come here for a late lunch after shopping at 3pm. It was very crowded and there was half an hour wait. We decided to seat outside because it was such a beautiful day and we had a great view of the fountain. Our server, Simon was wonderful and quick to refill our drinks and meet our requests. We decided to share the Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($13.50) for the lunch special. Despite the dish being a smaller lunch portion, it was still plentiful. This is my absolute favorite pasta ever. The creamy sauce covering the bowtie pastas is delicious. Also, it's topped with sauteed mushrooms and chopped bell peppers. The best part is their crunchy, fried chicken on top of the pasta that's just splendid. I'm also a huge lover of cheese if you haven't noticed yet, so I definitely had the waiter spend a couple of minutes covering my pasta with parmesan cheese. My pasta was basically covered with snow! To pair with the pasta, the complimentary bread is great with anything with a sauce-base. I especially enjoy their honey oat bread, which is what I crave most from The Cheesecake Factory. To end our meal, we shared the White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake ($7.95). I was a little disappointed with the cheesecake as the nuts were too much for me and lacked a true cheesecake texture. I'd be surprise if you didn't go home with leftovers from here as to why we shared our meals. It was more than enough for the two of us, which left us in a food coma right after. Make sure to not eat then shop, but to shop then eat!"
Oscar P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,1,2.0,3/11/2017,Terrible service.  I can understand they are busy but water and a basket of bread should be standard within the first 30 minutes of sitting at the table. Food was good but sadly the service really overwhelms the experience.  I probably won't be going back.
Jess R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",130,3,11,2.0,5/31/2017,"Food was awesome - at least dinner part. However, service sucked! Waitress forgot our utensils ... drinks ... never cleared our table so there were plates piled up.... never checked on us for drinks or anything and there was a fly in my tuna tartar"
Ashley R.,"Mission Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/19/2017,Love having breakfast here. Food is delicious fresh made and clean. Really love sitting in the patio and enjoy the fountain and the Americana atmosphere.
Cris R.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,6,1,1.0,6/18/2017,First off I would like to say that it's chaos. I came in for Father's Day with my fam and it was a disaster. The host that attended was lost on everything that was going on and didn't even know where to seat us.Then the manager had extreme attitude and had the audacity to even roll her eyes at me with no care whatsoever. The service is very poor and I did not have a good experience.
