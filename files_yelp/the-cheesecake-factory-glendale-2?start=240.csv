Galust K.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",4,37,19,1.0,2/28/2017,"Worst experience ive ever had at a cheesecake factory before....... I mean horrible.. As a middle class father, I was on a short 1hr lunch when I decided to go to cheescake. I was seated right aeay(which was great) and they brought the bread out for me to nimble on while Tiffany assists the other 19 tables outside. The bread? Cold, hard and bland.. did not tastle like the bread I had at any other cheesecake factory. The  black bread that they serve is usually phenomenal, but for some reason todays bread was very dry.. About 20 minutes after theu brought the bread, Atiffany came and took my order. I ordered 2 kobe beef patties on a plate of salad. I asked for medium.................. and asked Tffany to make sure it is medium.......... after 55 minutes waiting for 2 beef patties, Tiffany came by with the plate.. sure enough, it was well done. They tried telling me it was medium well, but it was clearly well done as there was not even a small hint of red. I told her I hate it, and the ""manager"" came out.. Hello, whats wrong? Said the manager(like you would to a baby) i said I hate it.. i told him I would not eat a well done patty when I specificslly asked for medium.. his response?? Well your free to go.. and he walked away.. Best hour spent of my life.. hungry, tired, and annoyed. I will NEVER return to this location. The place is run by a realtime doush...."
Lulu M.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,10,,2.0,5/28/2017,"The customer service sucks especially when you try to sit a disabled person at a small table in the bar area and she does not drink!!! All we got from the manager Sam I am sorrythe waitress was very nice and pleasant after they finally move us to a bigger table,"
Patrick M.,"Pasadena, CA",136,460,150,5.0,1/31/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a consistent and delicious meal.  I came here for lunch last week, and it was really good.  The lunch portions are perfect for a lunch-time meal, and the food was great.  I had a Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta, and I would for sure get it again.  Just thinking about it actually puts me in the mood for it again.  Followed by some Cheesecake and coffee, it was a perfect lunch. Everytime I go to Cheesecake Factory, I ask myself why I don't go more often.  Hopefully that will change, and I make it a more frequent destination."
Nessa G.,"Chico, CA",0,41,4,1.0,4/22/2017,Horrible customer experience!!! And they completely forgot about my food and the waitress was so rude about it. Never coming to this location again!!
Mickey C.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,15,21,2.0,2/12/2017,"I came here for brunch on Sunday with my wife  She ordered fish and chips witch was good , we ordered two coffees it was good, but I ordered the most disgusting Montecristo sandwich I've ever had in my life , the bread was super dick and soggy , extremely sweet and it had scrambled eggs inside and a side of strawberry jam , are you serious ? , who the hell would eat scrambled eggs with strawberry jam that's just nasty , a Montecristo sandwich has already egg on the bread there is absolutely no need of scrambled egg inside , and the sweetness should be only the powdered sugar and maybe maple syrup not the bread soaked in extrasweet French toast batter , I'm sorry guys but you need to balance that crappy plate , not everything in this world is sugar for god sake ! Whoever is the executive chef , i can't believe he allowed that to happen!, just because of that I would never come back for brunch ! Maybe I come Back for a cheesecake some day! Or fish and chips LOL  Service was good by the way !"
Alicia L.,"Fullerton, CA",26,22,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Our waiter Gilbert H was awesome during the first half of our meal. Very attentive, funny, and kind. Then all of a sudden we had a total 360. He became rude and very short with us. We tried to flag him down multiple times to tell him and also give him a list of our meals for separate checks. When we finally got his attention he said ""I'm too busy to do that next time tell me at the beginning"". So we were left to split the bill five ways by ourselves. So we get it all written out and give him EXACTLY what we want on each card, and he messed it up. He put $72 on a card that was suppose to have $20. How do you mess that up????? So we spent 1 1/2 with managers and the waiter figuring things out. A WHOLE HOUR AND A HALF. Really? All because he was too lazy to split the check. I understand it was National Cheesecake Day, but you don't let your customer service falter. Especially with  the comments he made ""All this fuss just for 10 dollars,"" ""I don't have time for that."" He should have asked another employee or asked us to wait a little longer, we wouldn't have minded. Anything is better than waiting an hour and a half for something that could have been avoided in the first place."
Emx A.,"Montrose, CA",1,3,23,1.0,9/15/2017,"Oh no, nothing is fresh or tasty and the wait is too much to handle.  I'm very disappointed and not going there anymore.  Don't recommend this to anyone and stay away from this place."
Aa B.,"Wyandanch, NY",0,3,2,4.0,11/13/2016,We went there with my friends . Food was delicious & withers was friendly. Atmosphere restaurants was nice
SittingPretty B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",5,142,8,4.0,4/28/2017,"I visited yesterday as we were waiting for our movie (The Promise) to start. We walked in around 6:45 pm. The wait to be seated was less than 10 minutes. Malia was our server. I was very pleased with her help. Other servers usually bother us way too many times, while all we're trying to do is eat. We told her we were in a rush so we wanted to order our dessert with our meal, so she independently decided to help out by bringing out our check early (with our dessert) as well. We tipped well to show our appreciation. Common sense is way underrated nowadays. I love it when people realize that bothering customers 10+ times to see if ""everything was alright"" is a little ridiculous. Thank you, Malia for realizing that. Parmesan herb crusted chicken was to die for! Fettuccine alfredo pasta was just okay. Ultimate red velvet cheesecake was amazing! My only complain: way, way too pricey. I would come in more often if the prices were a little more reasonable and the business would make more of a profit in the long run."
Cheryl M.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,57,8,1.0,9/13/2016,"Pre-ordered a 6"" original cheesecake for a bday party. Gave them 48 hour notice. Got a call while I was on my way to pick it up (10 minutes to agreed upon pick-up time: 11a) saying they were so sorry but they sold out of the 6"" original.  Sold out. Of original cheesecake. At Cheesecake Factory... And what's the point of asking people to pre-order if they can't manage the orders properly?  Thankfully this is the Americana location and I was able to get a last minute cake elsewhere."
Courtney Y.,"Glendale, CA",98,9,,2.0,1/9/2017,"I ordered lunch delivery from this location. Food was cold, almost if it had never been warm. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, there was nothing Buffalo about it. No sauce at all. Very disappointing all around . Only stars because of speed ( however likely forgoing quality)"
Amanda M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,24,1,2.0,4/9/2017,"THIS LOCATION SUCKS The outside looks amazing but the setup on the inside blows. Other locations are more spacious, but this one is is set up like a diner. What I mean is, it's cramped and you are packed in like sardines up against other tables and booths which are small.  Not only that, it's always packed so the service isn't good because they know they don't have to work so hard to get people to come.  It's not the cheesecake factory experience you usually expect, especially when paying this kind of money for food."
Henrik K.,"Lillerød, Denmark",7,2,,1.0,6/26/2016,"First off all. Some of the food is good, really good. But thats about it. We were a party of 8. Coming from Denmark, we heard of the place and decided that this is worth a try. But what a mess we entered. 4 adults and 4 kids. (3 under 10)  We had to wait 2!!! hours before we were seated. Then after that, the first thing the waiter does. Is to spill a giant coke into my lap, lucky for me our hotel was nearby... And because og the sloooow service, I was able to get there. Change my clothes and shoes and get back... And .... Still no food. Clock was about 21 and we had 3 kids that were pretty tired. 2 hours and 30 mins our food starts arriving, but not for all at once, so some of us are done before the last ones have had any food at all. Some of the food is mixet up with others customers orders, and some of it is way overcooked and dry, probably because of the long wait.  When we left we were told we could have 2 pieces of cheesecake... And the waiter insisted on a tip... What a nerve. Everything was terrible and then still wanting extra money. American greed at its best!  Point of this story! They let WAY to many people in there. And should have have more people handling the customers... But I guess thats not an option, when money talks. Dont go there!"
Diana P.,"Anaheim, CA",147,83,104,3.0,11/24/2016,"This location was just like every other. A long line, and a little too dim inside. Their food is good though, yet still expensive. Their house bread and butter is always nice though, because they have different types of bread. Our server was very nice and accommodating to our party. Overall, it was a nice experience even though the wait was almost an hour."
Maya L.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,43,,5.0,4/5/2017,"My dearest friend of 25 years was returning to England, so we ordered our proverbial Caesar's salad w/no chicken, when here came a server w/ the sweetest demeanor, Dominique D! She not only smiled sincerely, but frequently checked to see if we needed more lemons for our water/more hot water for my tea (she even brought me more than enough honey-smiles). On top of that, the bus-boy, DJ, who clearly did NOT need to get our respective parking tickets validated, nonetheless did w/out a moment of hesitation!! Now, THAT'S what we call, SERVICE!! & though it's a bit of a drive, we've decided to dine at THIS location rather than the one at The Grove near Farmer's Market. Smiles."
Gustavo C.,"Winnetka, CA",3,6,1,4.0,4/3/2017,"Anything you order here is delicious! I usually go with the Americana burger, factory meatloaf or one of the pastas. The complimentary wheat bread and butter is second to none. I rarely grt the cheesecake because I'm too full from the meal."
Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",3715,733,1722,3.0,11/1/2015,"Maybe because it was a Friday night...the service was pretty bad. There was a wait so I requested that my name be added to the waiting list. After about 30-40 minutes I got the text that a table was ready. We were seated outside, and the waiter pretty much ignored us.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times all over California, so of course the food is always consistent. Just not the service.  The still have the best calamari around. My entree was the Egg Plant Parmesan. Amazing as always. With an iced tea.  If the service was good. This was have been a 5 star review."
Melanie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",129,8,14,2.0,7/2/2016,"The service sucked, as a party of 7, 4 of us didn't like the food, and the rest felt alright about it. I personally had the Chicken and Waffles Holandiese, the potatoes were burned, hmm I am being gracious with what is being said."
ED S.,"Glendale, CA",86,17,37,1.0,3/29/2017,"I don't know why I come here.  It's too crowded, too noisy, too expensive, too slow, too much waiting, too much!"
Michelle R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/15/2017,"This is hands down my favorite restaurant. It's the one place where you always have to get an appetizer, entree AND dessert because their food is just THAT good."
