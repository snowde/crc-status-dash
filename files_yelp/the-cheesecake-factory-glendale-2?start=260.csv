Tiffany N.,"Los Angeles, CA",103,197,275,4.0,12/3/2015,"Cheesecake factory is perfect for a time when you don't know what to eat. They have everything and anything on the menu. Let me start off by saying the bread they bring out in the beginning is super tasty. Especially the brown one! All their food is good. From pizzas, pastas, to salads. I love the four cheese pasta. Super delicious and flavorful. The chicken tequila pasta is also extremely creamy and delicious. The Luau (I believe is how you spell it) salad is incredible!!!! You MUST try that when you go there. It's an amazing sweet Chinese dressing with chips and all these good vegetables in there. Also, the fish tacos! They have a huge menu with pages and pages of food, you'll find something! This particular one is a beautiful location in the middle of the mall so you have a lot to do before and after you eat. The only problem I have with this branch specifically is the wait. It really is just too long. The problem is not even necessarily the level of busyness, it's the way they handle it. I would see 6-7 tables empty at a time waiting to seat people for 10-20 minutes. Tables should not be left empty when there is a line out the door. Service isn't that great when they get too busy, but it's still decent.  To end your meal, they have of course their amazing cheesecake. I like the original, strawberry, or the oreo one. Those are my favorites."
Maria P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,49,55,3.0,7/11/2016,"Slow, and unorganized. Had to wait for 30+mins for our pasta. Our server had an attitude. WTH?!  Lucky them I did not have low sugar, or else I would have flipped out! Oh yeah, loved the breads so, my sugar was in check!"
Brandon G.,"La Crescenta, CA",301,45,7,5.0,3/26/2017,An amazing place with a beautiful customer service!! Truly love the environment in here and the employees are so respectful and helpful. One of the best Cheesecake Factories locations in California
Richard K.,"East Bay, CA",465,404,3711,1.0,10/18/2014,"God I hate this place. The only reason I go to this ridiculously unhealthy corporate restaurant that is worse than McDonald's in terms of being bad for you is because my silly parents like this place. Then again, they used to think Sizzler was the bomb and they still eat steak well done... SMH.... Look, I just don't get why this place is so popular. Service is always shitty and wait times are almost always an hour or more for food that tastes no better than Stouffer's frozen food. And honestly, I have no idea why they bother with Asian food that tastes worse than Panda Express. Trust me when I say the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice is just deplorable - I mean, it makes Mr. Yoshida's sauce seem heavenly. My silly parents ordered this... uggh... And their shitty pizzas taste pre-packaged since they probably are shipped to the Cheesecake Factory from a Sysco-owned distribution warehouse. And speaking of pre-packaged, you should know that despite its name, none of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants actually make any cheesecakes in-house. All that is done in a ""cheesecake factory"" over in Calabasas. So if you really go to this restaurant for the cheesecake, just stop by the frozen section at your local Ralph's because it's the same shit albeit a whole lot cheaper.  And, as if to make your experience even more ""cheesy"" (pun intended), their menus are as thick as college readers. That is because not only does the Cheesecake Factory have over 200 items to choose from, their menus are filled with more freaking advertisements than the ""free version"" of Angry Birds, YouTube, and the Sunday newspaper combined. I mean, sorry Artin, I really am not  ""thinking of buying or selling"" a home when I look at a menu. Go spend your advertisement money on a bus bench ""bro"".  But the main reason I hate this place is because eating here is unhealthy and will take you one step closer to a heart attack since nearly every entrée here is served with exorbitant amounts of sodium and fat. Take for instance the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta dish consisting of bow-tie pasta, chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. This deceptively healthy sounding dish comes out to 2,190 calories, 58 grams of saturated fat (three day's worth) and 1,830 milligrams (mg) of sodium.  That is more than a Big Mac combo with a large Coke (1,580 calories) and two extra cheeseburgers (300 calories each). Moreover, the current dietary guidelines for Americans recommends that adults in general should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. And you know those ""famous"" Avocado Eggroll appetizers? One serving is 960 calories and contains 1,130 mg of sodium. And their ""healthy"" salads are filled with exorbitant amounts of sodium that make Maruchan Instant Ramen Noodles seem healthy. Take a look at the Asian Chicken Salad, which the Cheesecake Factory lists under their ""weight management"" section of their menu. While the salad has only 570 calories, it has 2,600 mg of sodium... sneaky, deceptive, shameless. While I apologize for going off-tangent and turning into a health nut there (I just got a blood test and my LDL cholesterol came out high), unless you want the Fattycake Fattery to kill you, you really shouldn't eat here. But don't take my word for it.  * It's funny how they have a ""Skinnylicious"" section of the menu. That means, the rest of it is Fatty-ridiculous..."
Annemarie A.,"Anchorage, AK",1,4,1,1.0,4/8/2017,"I grew up going to cheesecake factories with my family every so often, and I'm sad that it's just not good anymore.  Literally every part of our dinner was flawed in some way. When they called our name to sit at a table, we walked to the table and it was taken, so our hostess had us wait while she walked around and looked for an open one. More waiting on top of our 45 min initial wait to get seated.  The food was even worse. We ordered the Korean fried cauliflower and the salmon scampi combo and they were absolutely horrible. The sauce on the cauliflower was choking. Granted, we didn't pick a grant dish. The asparagus in our salmon dish was cold and the shrimp was fried, but it had been soaked in the dish for too long because we had to wait so long so it had become soggy. The salmon was okay.  THEN on top of our already very slow service, their gift card system was down so it took another 10 minutes to process is by hand. AND THEN our waiter misplaced our parking ticket that we had given him to validate!!!  Horrible!"
Patty N.,"Cucamonga, CA",62,11,,1.0,1/3/2017,"Super Gross day!! Purchased 3 cheesecakes 1 had a hair inside the frosting!!! Disgusting - my 10 year old got a mac-n-cheese & a hair in there also! Today must have been a bad prep day ...... the manager ""Patrick"" refunded 1 cheesecake (where the hair was stuck in)!! Totally horrible"
Gail H.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,4,2.0,10/22/2016,"After asking for a booth at check-in and told it would be an hour, waiting patiently they still got it wrong. I mention that to the host and all she could do was scream out it's not my fault, I told her I didn't say it was your fault.  We ask for the manager and he said we would be seated  soon but we still had to wait another 15/20 minutes so after waiting well over an hour we finally got a seat. Things have changed But are waiter was great!"
L J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,48,18,2.0,12/29/2016,"The review is mostly for the service and the overall experience.  I've had good service and bad service. It's a hit or miss, busy or not.  The service from the host station is consistently bad.  The food is pretty good.  I tried their steak for the first time and it was surprisingly good.  I didn't expect it to be bad but since they're not a steak house I didn't expect it to be as good as it was."
Andrea M.,"Riverside, CA",68,10,3,5.0,9/29/2016,It was a cake that taste like cheese and it was awesome. But I should've gotten the nachos.. But the cheesecake was awesome.
Byron P.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",153,287,44,3.0,10/18/2015,"I came in with the family one weekday Summer afternoon. It was still pretty packed so I was kinda surprised. But I suppose it is in Americana at Brand so it's usually pretty busy, regardless of the day. The food was good, surprisingly good, and the service was good too. Plus they validate parking. I was happy with all of that. But I do have a somewhat minor, and somewhat major gripe. Firstly, am I the only one who is irritated by the superfluous advertisements on the damn menu? What is that? Is Cheesecake Factory going out of business? Do they need to have all those advertisements for the income? It was sad. I haven't seen so many advertisements since the last time I clicked on an inappropriate website and was bombarded with pop ups. Not cool. My major gripe is that their suggested tips on the receipts are based off the total bill, not the subtotal like it's supposed to be. To me, that's a sneaky, dishonest, devious way of doing business and I don't like it. Makes me wonder what else they are doing. Although I was happy about most of my experience, I  won't be rushing back."
Krissy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",486,114,106,2.0,12/7/2016,"I love this restaurant!!!! My favorite! All employees are great except the man who works the front wearing black. He has a pony tail! He's super rude!!!!! I asked to cancel my name in line and he just looked at me with no words. At least say ""sure"" or acknowledge me at least. Get it together cheesecake factory! I would've given this place 5 stars but that man is rude. Food is great! And they do validate!"
Alin A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",74,85,133,5.0,11/8/2015,It was the best salad of the year..  Fast service for first time usually u have to wait at list 45 min to get in but this time was so good .
Crystal M.,"Henderson, NV",210,260,371,3.0,9/28/2015,"I've been here several times and though I enjoy the food and appreciate that this location has a Happy Hour, I'm irritated that the ladies room is always a mess. Today I had to report this to the three hostesses on duty and they all seemed to be also irritated by the news. Or by me. I don't know. I got a snotty reply that was unfriendly. I followed up my news with 2 of the stalls don't have toilet tissue to encourage their sense of urgency.  I find it difficult to enjoy my food when I've ""visited"" a restroom that appears highly neglected. I'm under the assumption that all of the staff are using the same restroom that I just endured. So if they haven't felt the need to have housekeeping take care of it, they must think it's clean or acceptable for customers. Thus, I get concerned with cleanliness everywhere else.  That's all."
Erica L.,"South East LA, Los Angeles, CA",51,27,38,5.0,2/26/2017,Love this cheesecake factory always choose it when I want a great meal never disappoints the orange chicken plate is a personal favorite of my husband and I enjoy the chicken enchiladas. Have recently tried some new things on the menu and really enjoyed the chicken and steak Diane factory combination. The kids many pasta was delicious for my baby ! And we enjoyed our service and time !
Carrie M.,"Encino, CA",2,20,16,1.0,6/1/2016,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations and the service and food is very consistent. Except for the hostess at this location. We were there at 4:00 on May 31st. And when we asked if we could sit at a table in the bar she quickly yelled, ""There's NO self seating there, you can't just sit down!"" We then asked if we can be sat there by her and with her rolled eyes, she said, ""Ya, sure, wait on this side the host stand.""  The table was 12 feet from the host stand but we HAD to wait on the other side. Ridiculous and rude. We turned to her and said don't bother, we are leaving.  She said, ""Ok, that's fine!""  She is not a great first impression for your restaurant."
Lilly O.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/3/2017,"I came in today to celebrate my birthday with my family, and from minute Dina A. came to our table she was great.  Took care of us like family and made me feel special. She went above and beyond her job requirements. I will definitely come back here soon thanks to Dina."
Elina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,4,,1.0,4/22/2017,"First of all when we came, table wasnt cleaned enough,it was wet and there were some crops on it. knives werent clean.We ordered Choped salad with bacon separate, they brought it without bacon even, and forgot to bring bread and butter. Anyway we arent pleased of this service any more.We wont visit Cheesecake Factory at Americana .It was better before! We are disappointed"
Jam Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",409,161,1876,4.0,9/12/2014,"WHY the low rating?! How can anybody NOT like dining at THEEE Cheesecake Factory. Please solidify my thoughts, what is there not to love? First of all, their menu is just about enormous as their restaurant. The list of dishes is RIDICULOUS. Although, too many options can lead to indecisiveness and maybe even frustration.. But whatever, they all end up tasting great anyway. ONE DOWNFALL: They don't take reservations via phone. Walk-up only. This goes for The Grove location too. And the longest I ever had to wait was 45 minutes and the only reason I agreed to the wait was because there was a Sugarfina location at the corner I wanted to check out (which, by the way was no good) What I got/tried in the past: Da Vinci pasta. Tasted great. The sauce was reminiscent to stroganoff, except slighty sweeter. It's good! The noodles were of penne. Portion is huge, ofcourse. Club Sandwich with fries & ranch dressing. The best part of this meal? THEIR RANCH DRESSING. It's thick and the flavor just explodes in your mouth. The sandwich was good. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. Fries were amazing :) They have one of the best restaurant style fries~!! The Firecracker Salmon appetizer. It tasted great. They're like egg rolls stuffed with salmon. Comes with shredded red cabbage and asian dressing that was yum! It was sweet, garlicy, gingery and sesame-y lol. And I honestly don't remember what else I've tried in the past, but I know I enjoyed my meals every time. So.. unless their lacking in the sanitary department, there really isn't much to complain about.  OH ALSO HOW COULD I FORGET. Their cheesecakes! Vanilla bean was good, tiramisu cheesecake was good, but their KAHLUA COFFEE cheesecake was magnificent. Mm..Mm.. MM! (FYI, cheesecake/other desserts menu is also ridiculous. Good luck choosing! ;)"
Jenine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",315,36,15,1.0,11/23/2016,"11/23/2016. The day before thanksgiving. My boyfriend and I ate the Cheesecake Factory in Glendale. We arrived at the bar at 10pm (an hour before closing). We were waited on by VINCENT. Knowing the risks associated by sitting at the bar (low, minimum face to face interaction) we were ready to just order and eat. I myself ordered a Kobe burger and my boyfriend ordered chicken tikka masala, along with two pineapple Moscow mules. There was another couple next to us, also at the bar, who arrived AFTER us and got their bread basket arrived BEFORE us. That was the first red flag- starving as we were, we were quick to notice this discrepancy.  Brushing it off and attributing it to being ""rush hour"" for serving/dinner time, we disregarded this.  What really pushed our buttons was not being asked how our meal was AT ALL, NOT ONCE after receiving it. We are both servers, so we understand how it gets when it's busy, but when you ask the couple next to us who arrived AFTER US how their food is, we take it personally. We usually tip 30% and LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but will probably NOT be back after this experience. Living in LA, there are plenty of better options.  Avoid the bartender VINCENT at the GLENDALE CHEESECAKE FACTORY."
Minah K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,4,5.0,8/31/2017,"I won't go into details about the foods because we all know how great Cheesecake tastes; however, the service I received from Jeffrey was above and beyond. I don't think I ever felt like home at another cheesecake restaurant locations. I would highly recommend Americana Cheesecake Factory only because Jeffrey was amazing!!! Made my night :) Thank you Jeff!"
