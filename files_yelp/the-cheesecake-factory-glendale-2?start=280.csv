Katrin A.,"Glendale, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/11/2017,I have been coming here for years. These last two times I have had food thrown on my table almost spilling hot food on my kids. Then the manager offered me free dessert. Really how about firing the dame fool who doesn't know how to do his job. Then the second time one of the servers cleaning the table next to me spills juice on me and walks away never apologizing and the waiter witnessed it and he said sorry never had the lady come back and at least apologize. This is a hot and miss when it comes to service. I wouldn't go back ever again
Paulene C.,"Evesham Township, NJ",10,77,51,1.0,1/30/2017,"I normally love the Cheesecake Factory, but my experience here was not up to par. While waiting for our iPhones to get fixed, my sister and I popped in for a quick dinner. I ordered the chicken alfredo, like I do every time I come. When I got my food I immediately spit it out. It was EXTREMELY salty. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my sister try it and she agreed. It was not eatable. I told the waiter about it and he asked if I wanted a new one, but we were on a time crunch so I said no. After this the manager came over to talk to me... he said that they boiled the pasta in salt...But everyone does this. That was no excuses for how ridiculously salty it was. Then he said that it was supposed to taste like the sea... totally lost me there. They obviously took the plate off our bill, but I left without eating any dinner. I definitely won't be back to this location."
Samantha C.,"Carson, CA",0,3,6,2.0,3/18/2017,The food is great but the cleanliness of this place is terrible. My wife and I had opened two wrapped silverware and they still had food on them and one napkin had a lipstick stain. It's ridiculous that these essentials were not cleaned properly. Check your silverware and plates before you eat wherever you go.
Grant P.,"Glendale, CA",4,20,12,5.0,10/16/2016,"If you walked past 9021Pho, crossed the street, and walked into Cheesecake then you're on the right track. Even though the wait may seem long at times, but you can always enjoy the Americana while waiting and they'll text you when your table is ready. Yes, they use modern technology to make the experience better. I know!! Unheard of!!! Love this place. Everything is great. A place to go with the whole family. It's a legit restaurant so expect to pay a little more than that crappy place across the street.  Favorite Foods: DaVinci Pasta, Steak Dian, Roasted Chicken. All great choices.  They're alcohol selection is pretty good. But I will say that this is not a place to go to if you're only interested in alcohol. Taste will be great, but you will be paying more for a drink here than you will at a bar.  5 stars all the way!!"
Mansta A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,186,70,1.0,12/18/2015,"The food was decent and the servers were very fast BUT there was a hair in not one but 2 of our dishes! Someone is definitely not tying their hair up in that kitchen. We first found a hair in our burger but I thought maybe it could have been mine so I didn't mention anything. I'm not one to complain especially since I wasn't certain it wasn't mine. But then my brother found a hair in his dish and he does not have long hair.  We mentioned it to the server and she offered to replace the dish, but at that point who would want to eat more? They didn't even deduct the hair dishes from our bill. Apparently you have to throw a fit about something to get better service . Nice guys finish last ."
Veronica T.,"Gardena, CA",82,32,120,4.0,1/7/2016,"Celebrating my good friends birthday with some delicious lunch I love their oat bread with butter, avocado egg rolls I got Chicken Madeira-chicken with asparagus, mushrooms in a Madeira sauce and mashed potatoes"
Cristina T.,"Sacramento, CA",208,145,869,4.0,12/7/2014,"Closest Cheesecake factory if you're in the Glendale, Silverlake, Highland Park area. It's located in the Americana right next to a Sprinkles Cupcakes. If you're on a budget I definitely recommend coming on a weekday during their Happy Hour which happens 4pm-6pm. Make sure you ask for the specific happy hour menu, sometimes they forget to do so. The appetizers are still the same portion as if you were going to order during the normal times. The best bang for your back are the spinach and cheese dip w/ chips and the friend chicken sliders. Cheesecake Factory is a reliable go-to. :D"
S R.,"Palmdale, CA",0,8,10,1.0,3/27/2017,"When you think about dine n shop, while at the Americana in Glendale, you think Cheesecake factory, right? Think again, while location is great and the food is fair for the price $$, waited 40 min to be seated, hungry and thirsty, we end up. With a sour experience my waitress, brought my food cold, disappeared for the whole time while we where there, only talking with other servers, how she already made 172.00 in 3 hours of only tips, while my wife and 5 year old, glass was empty from the time she dropped our food. I remain calm when she showed up, just to leave the check ignored our glasses where empty, then left again. When i read the check said, that I ""must"" tip a min 20% of the total, That's when I became outraged, took check paid directly to mgr explained and left, just to be confronted by my wonderful waitress at the exit asking that I need it to pay!!!! What!! I told her tip was In the check, she turn around an disappear. ""Lesson learned"" never again will go there, they're serving culture is to hustle money out of the patrons and not to serve with customer excellence. Be aware your service, could end up, very, very, ""selective"" if you know what I mean? :( Who?? The store manager?? I talk to him, for 10min, even call him to update him on his waitress move, to face me, at the door. Manager acts surprised, his comments didn't assured my concerns about her Poor decision"" I have a daughter and a son and happily, married, for 20yrs, would never disrespect this waitress. But in today's society, you never know some people, that kind of behavior could get her, in a lot of trouble."
Roxana Q.,"West Covina, CA",818,342,1593,4.0,7/15/2014,"I love cheesecake factory and I don't care if you judge me! What shits me about people hating on chain restaurants is that they didn't become chain restaurants because the food sucks. They became chain restaurants because people like them! Doi! So many good options but my favorites are: Spicy chipotle chicken pasta Bistro shrimp pasta Shrimp scampi  Orange chicken Mac & cheese balls (app) Ahi tuna (app) Avocado egg rolls Salads Ok, I think that's enough. Clearly you can see I like their pasta the most. This location at the Americana is really big so it makes for a shorter wait time generally. Another thing about it is that you can always count on cheesecake factory to be really clean. From bathrooms to silverware & table tops, I can't say I've ever had a bad experience in that regard. I've been here a hundred times and will keep coming back!"
Jeremiah M.,"La Crescenta, CA",620,68,86,4.0,4/23/2016,"Never seems to fail me except when I don't order cheesecake. The other meals are good but just not their specialty. If you decide to come here, come for the cheesecake. Also, Majid was a great host to my buddy and I. Very friendly and personable."
Rachel R.,"Glendale, CA",72,17,7,5.0,1/17/2017,"Every Cheesecake Factory is blessed, I love it. I'm always in the mood for their great food especially their mashed potatoes and lime rice.... I can eat it for days..."
Roxanne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,29,1,1.0,8/11/2015,"I'm a pretty patient person, but wow this particular Cheesecake Factory location is one of the worst.  The last time I was there, the service was pretty bad. Waiter completely disappeared after taking our order. Never got refills, had to ask another waiter to find our waiter to get the check.  Should have known getting a takeout order would have been just as bad. Long story short, I wanted to edit my order and was on the phone for 33 minutes before someone answered and hung up. My friend called on her phone and was put on hold, bam, another 20 minutes. Terrible management, terrible service. Sorry, I wish I had nicer things to say."
Yulia G.,"Glendale, CA",7,9,1,1.0,2/25/2017,"Poor customer service. Me and my husband were going there for couple years until recent experience.  Long story short. We have been asked to seat. Ppl next to us were very loud and we kindly asked to seat in a different place (there were plenty table empty during the day). The server refused and gave us a look.  We decided to change seats ourselves. The host came and told us to go back to the old seats.  My husband called the manager. The manager showed up and told us that if we don't seat at that table, we are welcome to leave.. At that point we were out of words... Great job Cheesecake Factory... keep up the good work.. meanwhile we'll go to a better place!"
Rachel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,471,237,4.0,10/10/2015,"All right, I changed my mind. Just finished up a delightful early lunch at the bar with my husband. They have SLIDERS ALL DAY! I've been craving sliders like crazy but most places only have them on happy hour menus so I never seem to be able to get my hands on them.  We shared the kale salad from the starters menu and it was like 6 bucks and awesome. Perfect size. Most restaurant salads are expensive and huge and you can never finish them but taking it home is rarely an option. I got the Roadside Sliders and Ernie got the Fried Chicken Sliders. All great and awesome! The order is around $9 but it comes with FOUR (count 'em) sliders with pickles and you can add fries for a buck.  Service was friendly at the bar, i swear, I don't know why anyone would wait for a table here when there are lovely gathering height 4-tops, booths and seats at the bar for no wait with the SAME FULL MENU!  Thanks TCCF, thanks Americana. Now I'm going to drag my basic ass over to h&m to find a dress for this wedding."

Erin W.,"Studio City, CA",737,205,815,5.0,3/30/2016,Service & food is always good here! I've honestly tried everything here haha I love their cheesecakes. It's lovely to have lunch or dinner outside the patio to watch the fountain show. :)
Charles G.,"Pasadena, CA",522,257,1103,5.0,8/19/2015,"I frequent this place quite often not sure why I never wrote a review. The Cobb salad is fabulous it's the best in Glendale. The rest of the food is also amazing and comes in large family portions. Enough food to feed an army.  So if your in Glendale, this place is a must!!!!"
James K.,"San Diego, CA",473,370,602,3.0,6/6/2015,"First time at this location, but not the first time at Cheesecake Factory.  To sum it up, great food but average service.  It was a Friday afternoon so it was pretty busy.  I asked how long the wait and they told us 15-20 minutes.  That was fine and they use your mobile number to notify you of your seat so you can go out walking around if you want.   Once we received the text, I went up to the counter and they told us to ""hold on"".  It's odd because why send me the text if you aren't ready to take us.  I realize some people may have left the restaurant but it seems most hang around so when you send the text, I would think you would be ready.  We stood by and noticed many other people and some groups coming up and getting seated.  After watching about a half dozen other people get seated, we went back up to let them know we were texted about the seat.  They looked at us a little confused and it seemed as if they had given our seat away to another couple.  However, they finally took us back to a table that hadn't been cleared.  I certainly don't mind waiting for a table to be cleared because it's only a few minutes.  But the isle is so tight, we had to stand right over someone else's table and I felt bad for those people trying to eat.   Ultimately we were seated and our server came out and took our drink orders.  When she came back with our drinks, we already knew what we wanted and placed our orders.  I had the club sandwich with a side salad.  I'm a big club sandwich lover and when they delivered it, it simply looked spectacular.  Three slices of white bread with a generous portion of fresh turkey (not processed).  Lettuce, nice full strips of bacon and tomato.  Cut into quarters as is traditional and there was a small cup of fries that came with the sandwich.  I bit into the sandwich and it was SO good!  Normally I'll eat half the club sandwich and take the rest with me but this time I ate the whole sandwich it was that good.  If I were to make a comment, it would be the tomato.  They put too much tomato and they should try buying fresh tomato's from a farmers market or something because these were not quite ripe.  I pulled off the excess tomato and it was perfect.   I had iced tea to drink and it was fresh brewed tea!  So great especially when so many other places use instant tea for their iced tea.  We decided to take some slices of the strawberry cheesecake to bring to our friends we were going to see after dining here.  Our server brought out the cheesecake slices in individual plastic containers (recyclable) with forks and napkins for each slice.  The only problem was when we finally got to where we were going, the cheesecake slices looked more like pudding!  The containers for the cheesecake slices are way too big for a single slice and they must have moved around quite a bit while driving.  The car was air conditioned so it wasn't a heat problem.  But it's shocking since the car is a luxury car and the ride was smooth.  Of course it tastes the same, but it just looked terrible when I went to give these to our friends. If you were reading closely, you might have noticed I mentioned a side salad and yet didn't talk about it at all. That's because they never brought it and I didn't realize this until long after we had left.  But of course, they did charge us for it.  I hope our server is enjoying the 20% tip we left her!!!  She did provide good service but it was reflective of our overall service at this restaurant.  Cheesecake Factory is known for being slammed all the time at every location I've ever visited so this isn't anything new for them.  But to forget about us after notifying us that our table is ready, taking us to a dirty table and our server forgetting the salad.  Very unsatisfactory.  The only reason I give the three stars and not lower was because the food was very good.  Our server was very friendly and for the most part, very attentive.  If it weren't for the missing salad, I would say she was perfect.  Frankly, I don't really mind so much except that I was charged for the salad and ended up paying for it.  If she had realized (which she should have) she could have taken it off the bill.  Last, I'm so happy they use recyclable containers for the cheesecake, but try getting a bit smaller so the slices to move around so much and end up looking pudding when you get home.   Good place to eat when you are shopping here and I would probably go back to a Cheesecake Factory just for the club sandwich."
Perla C.,"Bremen, OH",0,61,18,1.0,1/28/2017,"They are too busy to give good food or, service!  Asked to be sat in main dining room and as a result was put at the bottom of the list.  Watched as guests that arrived way after my party be sat in the main dining area as I was made to wait and another party took our seats..."
Aida H.,"Glendale, CA",15,10,,3.0,3/2/2017,"Not a bad location, a bit busy, takes a long time to get your order but it's alright and the food is okay"
