Karla M.,"Monterey Park, CA",70,43,12,1.0,6/18/2017,"Never ever again! The service is extremely terrible here the Two female managers are useless and horribly rude. We waited two hours to get seated and they finally call us up . The host walks us to our table then says wait this isn't it let me check again... she leaves us waiting there like we don't matter at all. We then see the manager walking by and we tell her what's going on. She then says ""the table we wanted to seat you at is still dirty a baby threw up on it"" she sends us back to the waiting area. We are there waiting another 30 mins and see that they keep passing other parties to get seated after us. We are waiting and waiting and I went up to the rude host and told her that it's very wrong to have us waiting while others are eating seated after us. She has the worst attitude along with the manager and when they seat us, they roll their eyes at us. Disgusting service!!! I will contact HR ."
Miranda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,5.0,2/26/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, and this location is no exception. It gets REALLY busy on the weekends, which can be kind of stressful and loud, but if you can get a table outside, it's a great place to eat, drink, and talk. You can't go wrong with the menu of drinks or food. It's packed with delicious comfort food and has a wide variety of options, depending on what type of food you feel like, and whether you're feeling healthy or not. ;) I ate here last night and there was some kind of mix-up with the food that the people next to us had ordered. The manager came out and spoke with them, and it was handled very professionally. The service is always great. I have been nothing but impressed with the wait staff. The only thing to be careful with when eating at TCF is that the food is so good it's hard to stop. The portions are really big and delicious. Also, with this location in particular, it's located in a really nicely designed mall (The Americana), so it's fun to walk around and shop either before or after eating."
Ruth V.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,185,2387,4.0,4/17/2016,Their bread still fresh n   Neverending jambalaya seafood pasta taste the same n original cheesecake still best as ever.
Anna H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,3,1.0,11/18/2016,"The worst service ever! Placed an order 3 days in advance other then was on hold and disconnected for few times it was all wrong ! All they could say is sorry that did not help the party! Workers there just to do the hours , nothing else !"
Jodie S.,"Monterey Park, CA",296,271,134,4.0,9/8/2015,I had the chicken scampi pasta and the avocado chicken. It was really good with a huge portion. I came here for lunch on a Tuesday. There was no wait whatsoever and great customer service :)  I would definitely come back!
Daisy S.,"El Segundo, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/10/2016,"Sunday October 2, 2016 at 2pm my family and I (a party of 8 consisting of 4 adults and 4 children) arrived at the Cheesecake Factory for my early birthday lunch, 2:04pm we were put on the waiting list with an approximate seating time of 30 minutes. It was a beautiful sunny evening so naturally we waited outside to enjoy it. Surprisingly, by 2:18pm we received a call letting us know our table was ready. We rushed back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Our server Nikki L was extremely pleasant and attentive. We ordered appetizers as soon as we sat down. Shortly after we ordered our Entrees. We were enjoying ourselves too much to notice any prolonged delays in food arrival, so I will say it was a moderate wait. Again, Nikki L came by checking on us numerous times being extremely attentive. Food was great, no complaints even from our most finicky eaters: the kids. Soon after finishing our food Nikki L graciously offered dessert we were so full of yummy food we almost declined, but who goes to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake? Simply Unheard of. Sometime after placing the order for dessert Nikki L and 2 of her best voiced coworkers came out to sing the awaited birthday song. While working on dessert a man approached our table telling us to leave table, using offensive language. It is hard to describe the disbelief we were in after this, in total shock. We were frightened. The kids were nervous and confused. We asked for the check immediately after this. Nikki L picked up on the mood change at our table and proceeded to ask why. I described the incident, she immediately apologized. Grateful she did this, however she has no control on what goes on at the front desk. She went on to let her manager know.  Within a few minutes the Manager Bentley came over and sat next to me asking me to describe the incident. So I did just that; her facial expressions changed as I described what happened going from empathetic to ""Oh I know exactly who you are talking about, man in a white collared shirt low haircut. Yes, he did tell me he was going to come over here and tell you guys to leave as he also has a big party and is desperate to be seated we laughed about it ,but I am not going to seat him here anyway I am going to seat him there"" as she pointed to the tables behind us. I was not sure if I had understood correctly so I asked her directly, ""You knew this aggravated man was going to come to our table, and you didn't let him know that was unacceptable?"" to which she replied without hesitation ""Yes but it could have been a joke"" to which I responded with a simple ""Thank you"" She continued with apologies but again I said ""thank you"". I was in utter disbelief that she knew beforehand and took it so lightly. Nikki L came by again bringing the copies of the receipts. She asked if the manager had come by and I said yes, went on to let her know Bentley already knew so it only made me feel worse. She was so upset on the manager's reaction to the event she insisted on letting the general manager know. Rick stopped by gave his apologies for the 2 incidents and assured me this is not a reflection on The Cheesecake Factory.  We are ready to go and move on with our day, as we are walking out the man in the white shirt is at the door and immediately begins to yell out offensive words and approaches the only male adult in our group calling him out to engage in a physical altercation. This causes havoc. Thankfully we were able to walk out without being physically hurt.  As I reflect on this I think perhaps if the Bentley would have taken a more serious approach and had not made a joke out of letting an aggravated impatient man approach our table. Why joke about something so invasive and downright rude. Is there a Policy in place for situations like this? Was this a racial issue? Why did she not care? *****I sent corporate office a message the day after the fact a whole week went by and no response.*****"
Maple M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,15,5.0,8/4/2016,"Pretty much everything I've tried here is delicious. The wait and seating arrangements are always a hit or miss depending on the time of day, but it's the Cheesecake factory, there's going to be a wait! I love their lunch menu and of course their chessecakes."
Lexi V.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,10,1,1.0,7/17/2016,"First off, after waiting 30 minutes for our table, we were sat and didn't have any menus or silverware. Once the silverware came, we had to flag someone down for menus. Then we waited another 25 minutes to order but no one seemed to care. Eventually we had to flag someone down again and order. We also didn't receive any of the brown wheat bread, the best bread, while every other table had some. We ate rock hard/stale white bread. Waited almost 35 minutes for our food to come out. Food was decent. My side salad had a tear drop amount of dressing. Might I add that I am a teen and was eating with another teen. I feel as if this was a teenage hate crime. Not coming back to this Cheesecake Factory location."
Karen L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",246,340,482,4.0,7/18/2015,"Dinner on Thursday, 7/2/15 Don't forget to get your parking ticket validated. We walked in for a party of 3 and it took about 45 minutes. It was pretty busy since it was before a holiday weekend. The wait wasn't too bad since it's in the Americana plaza with lots of shopping stores, the Apple Store, the movie theater, and dessert places such as Sprinkles.  We got seated in a booth and it was dimly lit inside. The music was loud but we didn't mind. Service was prompt and the food was delicious. We ordered the Steak Diane and buffalo wings with ranch dressing. We tried to make room for a cheesecake but still ended up being too full. I think we ate too much of their bread and butter. It was too good to pass.  So far, I've been quite pleased with lunch and dinner meals at Cheesecake Factory. They have such a wide selection on the menu that it usually pleases a majority of your party. I can't wait to come back again."
Lui Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/2/2017,"I usually don't write reviews, and have never wrote a negative one, but the service here is horrible! The waiter had a really bad attitude and was extremely rude, I didn't even wait for him to bring the food to the table, his attitude made me want to leave as soon as possible and that's what I did. I didn't even finish my drink, took two sips and left."
Ted B.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,101,57,4.0,6/4/2015,"Definitely the best Cheesecake Factory around! The decor is beautiful. And being at the gorgeous and classy Americana really adds a lot, with it's fountains, music, people, and so forth. I've been here many times and the service is always good, and the food is always really good. This place blows away the one in Pasadena. The only thing I don't like is that they keep raising their prices, like at all Cheesecake Factorys. Everything on the menu is expensive, even appetizers and side orders. But I must say they usually give large portions here. Which I love. My wife and I took home our leftovers and had a second meal out of it the next day. I only wish they would start offering organic food. That would be awesome. It's unfortunate that they don't."
Bryan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,5,3,5.0,1/8/2017,I had a great fun experience! Ashely P! Is an amazing server! Thank you for recommending the Oreo Cheesecake as my BDay dessert it was delicious ! And also for singing happy bday!
Katrin A.,"SUNLAND, CA",57,74,31,1.0,6/16/2017,The food quality is horrible. I went there 2 days ago and had to use the restroom. It was so dirty that I washed my hands and left. I'm very disappointed with this location
Ruya M.,"Honolulu, HI",24,13,,4.0,7/30/2017,"We waited 45 mins to get seated, but all in all it was a nice experience; Good customer service and delicious food. The bread was probably the best bread I've ever had and the cheesecake was amazing. We ordered chipotle pasta and one plate was more than enough for us (two people)."
Brandon R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,2,,2.0,3/16/2016,Had dinner the other night in the back of the restaurant and over heard a table complain of roaches.  The bathrooms were disgusting and some of the servers had attitudes. The only good thing I could possibly say about this restaurant is that the host and hostesses are attractive and lovely to look at. However I won't be coming here often.
James W.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/6/2017,"Avoid this location! They are too busy to care about your business.  Tried to redeem my free cheesecake vouchers from the holiday promo and worker there gave me a hard time about it.  She counted that I had 4 people and told me I couldn't redeem 6 vouchers.  Made me feel like I was trying to take advantage of the promo.   I came back and sent a complaint on cheesecake website and got a call back after a few days from Tamara. She offers me a insincere apology and said they did what they are trained to do and they did nothing wrong.  I told her I never had this problem with other locations and why are they making a big deal about a small time thing as redeeming a voucher?  I explained, they make me feel like I'm getting a hand out. I bought gift cards to get those vouchers. She just wanted to argue with me, and kept saying those vouchers were free!  I told her don't worry, I will go to the other locations next time since they don't give me a hard time. Then she pretends to say she was going to give me a gift card but since I'm not going back, then forget it."
Tigran B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/27/2017,"The host said that we have to wait for 15 minutes. Waited  1 hour and than he said that i have to wait 20 more minutes. Waiting system works terrible. He didn't even say "" I'm sorry"". Everything is messy. Plus there is awful smell‍‍"
Norma H.,"WINNETKA, CA",19,6,5,2.0,7/4/2017,"We were really looking forward to dinner here with the family, especially since it was my parents' first time there. The evening turned into a 4-hr eternity. We checked-in and were told about a 40 min wait, after well over an hour we go check on status and we were told our buzzer hadn't been registered. They apologized and said they seat us right away. After another 15 minutes or so of waiting they went to seat us at a booth, but we had requested anything but a booth. They finally take us to a table, and the evening dragged on some more . By then my parents had already requested that we just leave and go somewhere else for dinner and maybe go back another day, but after so much waiting we figured everything would move along. Other groups came and went, and we were still there. We got out of there past midnight. The food didn't make up for all the waiting around. We don't plan on going back to the Glendale location."
Tammy K.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,,3.0,2/4/2017,"This place is packed at night. I suppose there is plenty to do at the Americana while you wait, but when you're hungry, you're hungry. We ended up sitting at the bar. The bartender was very professional and friendly. Besides getting splashed with water a few times (the barback was washing glasses in the sink in front of us), we had a decent time. The food was very good. I'll be back, eventually. The menu has too many choices, but if you're with a large group, it's great because you can please everyone."
