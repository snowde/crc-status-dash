Rosie R.,"La Crescenta, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/4/2017,Bad service lady manager completely useless. Will rethink to go back Going out to eat shall be a pleasure and a manager should be properly trained
Elizabeth G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,4,1.0,10/15/2016,"Do NOT eat here! They served me a stale burger bun and the manager did nothing about it except tell me ""we will talk to the bakery"" ...but what about my food today? Incredibly rude and gross. Never eating here again."
Sarah G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,5,1.0,7/16/2017,Just left and iam so furious with our service and waitress kelly. She not once asked how were doing only came to us when we asked for her. And we found a bug in our lemonade and all she said was oh ill get you a new one. The management here is the worst. Already wrote an email to corporate. The service needs to be better and the manager should really take the time to train and discipline the employees
Paulina S.,"Glendale, CA",39,57,26,1.0,9/5/2016,"Literally one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I would give cheesecake 0 stars if I could. I hadn't been here for a very long time because my experience prior to this hadn't been so pleasant; however, I decided to give it another shot.  As I sat down, I noticed our utensils were gross and covered with gunk, so I immediately asked for plastic ones. We were served the coldest plate of bland pasta I have ever ate in my life. The sandwich we ordered was topped with a piece of burned bread and our waiter provided horrible service, he did not even ask us if everything turned out ok or if he could grab us anything else. I will NEVER come back here again and I recommend everyone tries out one of the other many amazing restaurants in the Americana."
Stephanie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,24,4,1.0,11/20/2016,Today was by far the worst service i have ever recieved here. My husband and I sat by the bar so he can watch the game and when he asked to change the channel the bat tender lied to him and said they dont get that channel when we have watched it here before. Thats strike 1. Strike 2 we asked for bread and they gave us a stale batch. When we asked again they gave us another stale batch and it took twoce as long to come out. The food took just as long to arrive. The bartender did not attend to us even though he doubled as our waiter. I am very upset with the service here and i wont be returning. I would rather go to a farther cheesecake factory than be disrespected at this establoshment ever again. If i could give this place negative stars i would.
Kathy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",139,173,281,2.0,4/13/2014,"The stars are for the food because the food never really disappoints me. The servers were terrible... At least the two who we had today. To begin they didn't keep up with our table (only 4 guest) as far as drink refills or bringing more bread. The server had a bad attitude when she finally brought the bread and us declining-- she brought it when we were ready to leave, it was by then pointless. She also had the nerve to underline the amount of tip she thought she deserve-- I never have seen this! She was rushing towards the end, and this other server pointed at me as if I was leaving without paying. I was heading to pay upfront  so I could complained. Overall this was a terrible visit.  I tipped the guys serving cheesecake instead, who were more pleasant."
jennifer d.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,3,5.0,10/23/2016,"Came back with my group of friends tonight, the guy who served us (can't call him a server because I'm above nobody.) GILBERT YOURE AMAZING! He has such a bubbly personality and he was full of jokes he got all our orders perfect with a splash of humor which is great. U can tell he loves what he does. 5 stars Gilbert !"
Edward C.,"North Hollywood, CA",120,2,,1.0,7/28/2016,"Had a disapointed experience today...we arrived at 1:50pm with a party of 10. I understand it was around lunchtime so when they told us an hour we said fine. We checked back in at 3pm and they told us to come back at 3:30 and again they said come back in 15min. So when we checked again at 3:50, again they said we need it to come back in 15 min.  Soooo, in 2 hours they couldnt accomodate us and its truly disappointed becuase we were there to celebrate my brothers birthday and they wasted 3 hours of our time and were minimally apologetic and we had the sense that the whole situation was humorous to the female host and one of the african american managers. No sort of management attention and ultimately took our business elsewhere. NOT coming back to the Cheesecake Factory."
Tina T.,"Tujunga, Tujunga, CA",0,13,,5.0,1/23/2017,"This place never disappoints. With a menu as extensive as the wait on a Friday night, this place is well worth the price on your breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I love the pasta davinci, and the orange chicken plate - must haves - not to mention their pizzas and burritos! You have to try the spring rolls while you wait for your main course."
Marie Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",389,397,353,4.0,7/8/2015,Love Love Love cheesecake factory. Drinks are huge. Dishes are huge. Food is delicious.  My husband and I always get the Farfalle & the Georgia Peach cocktail. And the free bread? Crack. The lines are usually long but we just sit at the bar so there isnt as long as a wait for tables.
Priya G.,"Glendale, CA",492,247,236,4.0,8/3/2014,"Disclaimer: We only came here because we had a gift card. Always packed! In the Americana. Always a long wait for a table but you can get a number and walk around the Americana. They'll text you when table is ready. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Generous portion of complimentary bread. Butter made it better. You can choose between sourdough or wheat but if you don't mention it, they'll bring whatever is available.  No vegetarian menu and only a few veg options on the ""skinny"" menu but what we ordered was good. I had the Asian lettuce wraps and margarita flatbread. Both were good. The flatbread was thin and crispy - perfect! I would have liked it with less cheese though. Service was great. We asked for the chicken on the side for the Asian lettuce wraps and they did that for us. We also asked for a side of marinara for the pizza crust and they brought it out piping hot!  I probably wouldn't come here again because of the shortage of vegetarian items but it was still an unexpectedly good experience!"
Joyce G.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",302,617,2801,4.0,8/3/2015,Love this place but very busy.  Waiting area large but limited seating.  Receptionist rude so I went to the other one.  Food very good.  The bread is very good to munch on while waiting for your meal.
Gail F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",3,12,,4.0,12/3/2016,Fabulous food and drinks.  Nice friendly atmosphere and quiet enough to carry a conversation without raising my voice.  Parking was convenient across the street and valet parking can be validated.
Tanya D.,"Glendale, CA",107,61,28,5.0,3/3/2016,"Great service and amazing food! This location is very convenient since there's plenty of parking. There's always a wait, yes even on weekdays, so definitely don't come expecting to be seated right away."
Theresa R.,"Lakewood, CA",89,72,161,4.0,5/7/2016,"Met here with a group of friends for a late lunch.  We were seated in the patio area which was perfect as we are a noisy bunch. Our waitress was very efficient and helpful. Service was fast and the portions are huge. I ordered Pasta Da Vinci - noodles were al dente, sauce was delicious.  I was just wondering why I wasn't offered freshly grated cheese.  Oversight or they just don't do that - not sure. Passionfruit iced tea was refreshing and our waitress came back to refill without being asked.  (The place was crowded so again I must stress the service was good!) The girls ordered cheesecake but I opted for coffee instead as I wanted cupcakes from next door.  Great place to meet up with friends!"
Lola C.,"Orange County, CA",22,123,12,5.0,2/18/2016,"I've been to this location 2 times and both times was great!  The first time I came I had a long, complicated take-out order yet they got everything right and were super friendly.  The second time I came (recently) was on a Saturday when they are insanely busy/packed; however, my wait time was not too bad and we didn't have to wait forever and a day for the food to arrive! Great location too."
Susan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",322,63,138,5.0,4/25/2016,"My all time favorite restaurant, ever! Complimentary bread with butter is always a plus. Favorites: (basically all their pasta, haha)  Pasta Da Vinci (all time fave) Bistro Shrimp Pasta Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Pasta Carbonara  Four Cheese Pasta Steak Diane Cesar Salad Ahi Tuna Salad (their homemade house dressing is delicious!) Ahi Tuna Poke Mint Green Tea! Cheesecake: Red Velvet Cheesecake  Tiramisu Cheesecake  White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake  Overall: always satisfied!"
Lara J.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,30,30,3.0,5/25/2016,The food is great as always... The wait is too long.. Sitting outside is a hassle the loud music and too crowded!! People stare at you eating.. Wierdosss
Ren M.,"Bakersfield, CA",18,94,31,4.0,9/10/2016,"Cute place to eat when you want to break from shopping.  Sandwiches are good.  Salads too, but it can get quite bitter when they put too much arugula in them.  Soup is good.  Pasta? Could be better.  Sandwich? Alright.  Burgers? Yes I like their burgers.  Cheesecake?  Huge selection!  I think there are more than 15 kinds to choose from."
Genevieve K.,"Lancaster, CA",8,90,126,3.0,6/13/2015,"It was packed! We arrived at 7 pm and our  wait was approximately 50 mins.  The service was good but the food was slow to arrive.  Food was good! We had three different dishes: Thai Salmon (not on the menu), mushroom hamburger, and crispy spicy chicken sandwich.  When we left at approximately 9, there was still a lot of people waiting to be seated."
