Carl M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,40,15,4.0,1/16/2017,"Love the food here, i always order the skinny hamburger.. Save some room for the vanilla cheesecake.. Really like this place after a full stomach always shop next door at the mall"
Krishna C.,"Fullerton, CA",1,512,3268,4.0,3/29/2015,"We went here to meet our friends for lunch. Ian decided not to cooperate at the restaurant so the Mrs. did not get to enjoy the experience at all.  We ordered a Margherita Pizza, and Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta.  Pros: 1) Service was prompt. Waitstaff was pleasant. They boxed up our pizza for us. 2) There was a lot going on at the restaurant. All the tables were full, but it did not appear that anyone was left wanting for service (+1) 3) Portions are huge as always. Pasta was also good with adequate shrimp pieces in it :) 4) They validated parking.  Cons: None I can think of."
Senaida M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,4,2.0,6/17/2016,"So disappointed in take out. I'm a returning customer always just because I love their food, but this time they came short on their portions!!!!!!! The pepperoni on the pizza is burnt, the steak medallions is nothing compared to what I usually get which that is the reason why I ALWAYS GO BACK!"
Mr. C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,34,3,5.0,11/27/2016,"This is really about our awesome server Gilbert.  Everyone out there already knows how great the food is. Obviously, or we wouldn't wait so long to eat there. Just wanted to say that Gilbert was an awesome server, the kind of guy you would want to sit down and have dinner with. Laughed the whole night with him. Appyha irthdayba !!  Sorry, inside joke......"
Blessy B.,"North Hollywood, CA",722,242,817,4.0,1/14/2015,"Love their lunch menu. All your favorites in a smaller portion.  Louisiana pasta- love love love. Must try pasta. 4 cheese pasta- really good if your into a lot of cheese.  Fried portobello mushroom appetizer- so good, we always order this.  They're really busy here when it gets to dinner but other than that they will seat you fairly quickly. The service is really good.  They have outdoor seating, which is a must on a not so cold day because you can see the fountain from there."
Donna L.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",128,147,9,2.0,4/8/2017,"I come here about once a month because it's walking distance and my mom likes it. Today's lunch experience wasn't as pleasant as our other visits. Once our buzzer went off, we went up to the front to get seated. They took our buzzer and had us stand and wait for another five minutes while they were seating others.. which defeats the purpose of the buzzer but whatever. When it was our turn we found out that they had inputted our information incorrectly (requested a table for 3, they inputted a table for 2). Instead of apologizing, he rudely told us that we'd have the next table and just moved on to seating other tables. I'm assuming he wasn't a host or waiter because he was dressed in more professional attire than the others. What a damn shame it is- you'd think he'd make an effort to be a prime example of customer service. The experience put me in an unpleasant mood and will impact my choice in whether I will visit this establishment in the future."
Cbfreela T.,"Los Angeles, CA",360,24,51,5.0,4/17/2016,It's been a while since we celebrated our SonDay FunDay at the Cheesecake Factory. We had a great time and the food and service were amazing. Next time you're here try their Falafel Salad or Crispy Chicken Sandwich Korean Style. #CBFreeLA
Jason C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,23,,4.0,2/3/2016,"The pyramid of flavor power.  We all know this place offers, from the top down, everything under the food chain arranged with inspiration from every corner of the globe...on one menu. Then bread and butter and/or oil and balsamic on request, and dammit if that bread isn't addicting. Tall glasses of any beverage that make bringing Europeans here a real treat.  Cheesecake pioneered gluttony in the 1980's (as far as I knew, but '78 upon looking it up) when they began as a sandwich shop in Bev's Hills. Big sandwich's, then big portions became all the rage. And it was good. I'm here to report it still is today.  Speaking of the bread, it was about a year or two ago I noticed they changed the yeast they were using to produce the sourdoughs, which made a HUGE difference in the structure and flavor of the bread. How the hell they implement that across 180 or so locations is probably a news segment worthy of producing, and an surprisingly interesting one to watch.  When we think of chain restaurants, the title is not one of glamour. So how is a chain restaurant defined? 5 restaurants? 10? It's technically 2 or more, with a unified architecture regarding both the type of food, and sometimes the construction of the building. Cheesecake therefor qualifies. But that does not make it bad.  In fact, the chicken parm sandwich was served on this new sourdough, with their perfect tenderized and fried chicken (yet why the fried chicken salad was taken away I'll never know), and very tomato-y marinara, making it a great sandwich. Sitting at the bar allowed for an insight into the bartender's life in a 300+ seat restaurant pouring enormous drinks. Busy. Yet still the service was exemplary. Yes. That stupid word. Mostly because ""great"" sounds like when someone describes someone as ""neat"", but when they mean it in a good way. The guac was solid too. Really. Chicken wings, just right. Not reinvented, but done well. People are surprised when I say this. Why do people have to hate? Because of the butter thing? Sure, they put butter in everything. And when it can't be butter, it is another fat the vegans and vegetarians can all agree on. But so what? Isn't this what those diners that we all love to love because we find something charming in their dinginess offer the world? Okay, I lost some of you there, but that is fine. Those left standing probably agree: It's a Jersey diner on a national level. And it's good. Just bring back the fried chicken salad. I realize it's not a healthy salad. That's not why I go to a place named after the most fattening form of dessert ever invented - sugary cream with a buttered graham cracker crust. Or keep coming up with new dishes.  I'm a fan. I'll be back."
Melody K.,"Los Angeles, CA",621,265,78,5.0,1/13/2015,"I don't really eat at the cheesecake factory anymore because I feel like their food isn't good anymore. Idk when they lost it but they definitely have.  However today we decided to eat here and it was a hit! Absolutely loved our waiter, wish I had his name so I could do a shout out! lol!  I ordered the Shrimp and Bacon Club which I had never really noticed before. Like all their other sandwiches, it was super sized and hard to eat but omg it was worth it!  The avocado egg rolls were amazing! And the red velvet cheesecake, not my favorite but still delicious!! In fact I'm having the left over right now. Yum!!"
Jen B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2152,243,200,2.0,1/12/2015,"Two Words: Frozen Dinner Worst service ever. It was horrific. We had to wait an hour to be seated, and half an hour to order. I am very patient, but when I receive attitude from a waitress, that is unacceptable.  I ordered the shrimp pasta. Huh, that's odd, I never asked for my dish to be served cold. Oops, I guess they forgot to microwave mine. My friend ordered the chicken pasta and his plate was pipin' hot! He claimed that his tasted like frozen dinner.  The waitress came over and said that I need to order dessert. I said, I need the check. The waitress rolled her eyes so hard, I am sure she saw her brain. Come here if you want to wait over an hour to eat, receive a one-star ""service,"" and if you love paying for overpriced food"
Sydney T.,"Garden Grove, CA",39,537,2458,4.0,5/30/2015,Saturday night so there was a long line and the wait time was 30min.  They take your phone number and text you once your table is ready.  Foods were good and service was friendly and tentative.   Very lively and nice atmosphere.  We had a good time.  Our server Anthony was very nice and cool. We would love to come back here.
Keith B.,"Burbank, CA",108,3,1,1.0,1/2/2017,"Almost 2 hours into a ""30-45 minute wait"" and when we ask they say that the one table they had for us has people that won't leave. Terrible table management, if you had a party sitting longer than expected, juggle your other tables around and fix it, don't blame your other patrons.  I can't believe what a shit show of an operation you are running at your Americana location. I NEVER write negative reviews, this situation was so bad that I felt compelled to.  My advice, go somewhere else. I'll never return."
susie a.,"Burbank, CA",0,91,97,5.0,5/16/2016,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory!! Best fried mac n cheese, great pastas, yummy fish tacos, had the orange chicken and it was delicious!!! Best banana cream cheesecake!!! (Although they ran out on Mother's Day). Always satisfying!!!"
Zachary K.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",6,4,1,1.0,7/20/2016,"Normally I would be giving this place a 5 Star rating but just got some of the worst customer service from a worker who claims to be the manager named Kevin. Though I believe that one worker should not determine the rating of an entire restaurant, let this be a wake up call to whoever decides to read my experience. So to give a little detail on the situation: I call in to place a take-out order for my little sister who works inside of the Americana, who at the time happened to be getting off from her night shift at 10:30. She was extremely hungry so I wanted to set up an order for when she got out to walk over and pick up. When calling in I spoke with a guy named Andre who kindly transferred me to the Bakery so I can place my take out order.  After waiting almost 5 minutes on hold, this guy Kevin picks up and right off the bat is rushing me to place my order. I tell him what I want and without giving me a chance to speak another word he goes ahead and puts my order into the kitchen. And this is before I could mention that I wanted it set for 10:30 pick-up. Following this just before he is about to hang up the phone I barely slip in my directions for the order , only then he claims that its late and that it will be ready in 10-15 minutes. Long story short, after an argument over the simple fact that I want the food to be prepared at 10:30 so it is not cold he rudely argues back saying it was my fault that I did not mention it before, and that he was going to see what he could do. I told him go ahead do what u can and hung up feeling disgusted with the service I just received. So I had to call back in and get a manager on the phone and sure enough he is the one to answer. When I realize this , I ask to be transferred to a manager, and he claims to be it. So I straight up let him know that is no way to treat a customer before I cut the conversation short and got off the phone. To wrap things up without going in more detail, I am writing this review in disgust of the fact that someone like that answers the phone for take out orders. I feel sorry for the company if more situations like this happen to others when calling in to place an order. Anyhow I will leave it at that . Take care !"
Gisela S.,"Glendale, CA",48,66,49,5.0,4/9/2016,"Awesome service Vanessa thank you! food and dessert suggestion was appreciated! Love the mango key lime cheesecake as a recommendation  Keep up the ""smile"" and good customer service... Cheesecake Factory thank you for all the good employees that you have. Good customer service keeps people coming back"
Katy L.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,1,3.0,6/21/2017,I went yesterday and it was horrible! We got our food really late to top it off our food was cold! They took another 20 mins heating it up at this point we were done eating and we told them not to bother. The waitress had the nerve to say they took it off my bill. OBVIOUSLY!
Mary K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,24,2,2.0,11/29/2016,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for several years. The past few times that I've been here, ive been super disappointed. My pasta has come out cold the last 2 times that I was here. We are always having to send back utensils due to them being dirty. They were all little things that I was willing to ignore, until today. When they brought out the bread and butter, the plate that the butter was in had excess food all on the outside and was absolutely disgusting. For a higher end restaurant, the least you would expect is clean plates and utensils."
Rigo Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,6,4.0,5/14/2017,"My Family and I always have a good experience. We usually get an excellent waiter and do not have to wait long to be seated and served. my only complaint would have to be last few times we have come we have ordered the buffalo blast, which you used to be the best, but lately many tend to not be stuffed properly. So it just ends up being pieces of flat greasy wonton."
Elizabeth W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/30/2017,"Literally the absolute worst cheesecake factory location i've ever been to. I live in the area but would make the DRIVE to the Grove location just to avoid this awful service. I ordered two identical four cheese pasta dishes to go. One of them was great, the other was plain without any cheese and the pasta was FOUR cheese pasta. How do you let an order be sent out without the main ingredient? My order came out to $35 and i got what tasted like high school cafeteria style spaghetti noodles with marinara sauce. All was fine until i called to complain and the man at the front desk told me he would connect me to a manager. I stayed on the line for 10 minutes and still no one said a word. I have to listen to their hold songs on repeat starving because i can't eat this crappy pasta because i do not want to get sick. So beyond upset. I feel like they are keeping me on the line just so i give up and they don't have to refund me!! DONT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!! Get your pasta somewhere else"
Joshua R.,"Oakland, CA",286,3,1,1.0,6/18/2017,"Sat for 20 minutes without a server and got a dirty spoon for silverware. Manager took 15 minutes to come after asking still no server. Manager finally comes and gives the same generic excuse that the servers switched shifts and didn't do a proper changeover. Than asked if she could get us anything to drink and proceeded to card us for the two Jameson mules we asked for which she had no clue of what a Jameson mule is. Finally we get a server after what seems to be 30 minutes into Taking our seats. We immediately place all orders from drinks to appetizers to main course for fear we might die waiting. Ben takes out orders and than we get another server because bens going on break. Overall just poor management. The manager did a good Job at fixing our lack of attention but didn't go out of the way to fix the whole experience we encountered. If your out of the area don't go out of the way to come here because it's at the beautiful Americana. You'll be disappointed with the wait, food,and service. There are several other reviews that I read earlier today that say the same thing. And the 3 stars they have currently should be worth observing before making the decisions to spend your money here. Sad sad sad. On father days too. All bad."
