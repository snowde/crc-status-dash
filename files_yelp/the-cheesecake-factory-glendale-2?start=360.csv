Joselito T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,5.0,6/18/2016,"Great meal and excellent service from ""Ben"" our waiter. I am regular at this place and I must admit that our waiter today is one of the most wonderful and excellent waiter Ive ever had while dining at this place. Excellent food, great service and wonderful attitude!"
Larry T.,"Tracy, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/17/2017,"We went here because my daughter wanted to celebrate her birthday.  She ordered pasta and the menu stated it came with basil.  When it was delivered it had pesto and we checked to see if nuts were used to make it because my daughter is allergic to nuts.  It was, so we sent it back.  We had waited a long time for the first dishes to be served but did not know why.  We waited for the corrected pasta for almost an hour and guess what .... it was delievered EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST PLATE!!!  Since the manager could not do anything and the waitress was completely embarrassed, we realized that the kitchen staff do what they want, when they want, and with what they want.  So we decided to leave.  If i were the manager I would comp the whole dinner, but she just avoided coming to our table even though I asked to speak with here twice.  HORRIBLE SERVICE AND HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!"
Ann K.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",226,403,3514,2.0,12/5/2013,I've been coming to this location since Americana opened. At first I was blown away by the siZe and decor of this place but after two years of the same old thing I got tired. The wait at nights is usually 20 minutes plus everyday of the week. At first they used to hand out little buzzers to inform you when a seat is available but now they take your phone number and text you instead -( that way u can stroll out and walk around! How convenient right??!!)  I gave cheesecake two stars because everything is drenched in oil ( unhealthy) and  garlic( hate the after taste) the skinnylicous menu is new I guess to accommodate those who don't want to eat big portion sizes. But everything on the menu is the same!!! I'm tired of seeing the same items everytime!!! I've tried almost everything on the menu and yesterday after going again I realized that a lot of the menu items contain CHIcKeN! What about the folks who are vegan or vegetarian???? Does cheesecake care to accommodate those folks?? Please add more dishes with no garlic and no meat.   Now as far as the cheesecakes YUMMMMmmmmm!!!! I love the cheesecakes!!! Excellent taste and texture! I probably won't be going back anytime soon or ever unless it's to eat a cheesecake but I went for a friend last night! Cheesecake Factory no mo for me! :)
Marie-Katherine W.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,82,1088,5.0,1/8/2015,"This is my go-to spot when I'm feeling lazy. The atmosphere is casual to dressy but that just tells you that it's a place for everyone. The menu is huge (and a little exhausting) because there are pages for days... But that's also a good thing because there is something for everyone!  I tend to go around evening, it's less crowded than at ""peak meal times,"" but one time I went for Sunday brunch and it was CROWDED so I turned around and went elsewhere. There is a special secret I discovered about the Americana location: they can still make the BBQ SALMON if you order it! It has always been my favourite, but it was removed from the menu at all restaurants.  I think either the staff is always changing or they have a million servers, because I go A LOT and I have not yet gotten the same server. But they have all been pleasant and helpful and that's one of the reasons I like this place so much!"
Anna R.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,23,21,1.0,7/31/2016,The place is way overpriced. The cheesecake is better on other local bakeries. Also the waiting time was very long.  The Americana is very nice so i recommend going to Americans but not cheesecake factory.
Violet K.,"Glendale, CA",7,2,,1.0,2/18/2017,Just had a 4 hour dinner at Cheesecake Factory. After waiting an hour and a half for a table the restaurant managed to lose my debit card while charging my card.  That's not the worst of it not only they lost my card another table used my debit card to charge their $98 bill to my card. We had to wait an hour for the managers to give us bunch of reason or ways our card must have gotten lost. Like I care how it got lost. All I care about is why they lost it on the first place and how someone else got to use it while I am still at the restaurant. The manager had the nerve to tell me something like this happened 2 weeks ago. REALLY!!! That only means someone that works there is obviously doing more than just serving food. All I can say DO NOT PAY WOTH CARD AT CHEESECAKE.  ESPECIALLY DEBIT CARD. The servers and managers handle the situation where bad.
Ellen J.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/3/2017,"My son, daughter-in-law, her niece (adult) and I had a meal here on Sunday, Oct. 1,  late afternoon.  When we got here we waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated, no problem, but then the ""fun"" started.  We waited for 20 minutes before any waiter or waitress appeared.  Finally one waiter came who said that he wasn't really our waiter - our ""real' waiter hadn't shown up, he said - but he would take our order anyway.  So we waited for our meal for about 20 minutes.  Then three of us were served but not the niece..  She had to wait 20 more minutes for her dish.  The manager came over and said he would comp a piece of cheesecake for her.  After we finally finished eating we waited another 15-20 minutes for the bill which had to be adjusted because of the comp.  So more wait.  This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  It was a memorable meal, for all the wrong reasons."
Safwat R.,"Glendale, CA",4,3,3,1.0,3/4/2017,Don't believe in the 'fake news'. Cheesecake Factory's food doesn't taste well. A restaurant that puts too much effort on ambience is trying to cover for their unsatisfactory food.
Ilena A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/30/2015,Waiter was super nice! (Gordon?) dinner was a nice time as well.... Until we spotted not only 1 roach but 2!!!! At our booth that came out In-between the booth seats and the wall. 1st roach was small and 2nd roach was bigger and waiter came around at the time we were trying to take photo of it and notified the manager.  I hope something is done about this.  Imagine? 2 roaches coming out during the busiest time of the restaurant. When it's super loud and busy. I'm sure there is more in this place.  We ended up getting free dessert for everyone at the table and took it to-go but  it still got us grossed out.  Keep an eye out for those gross things!
Joseph G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,2.0,6/11/2017,The food is pretty bad.  It used to be better.    But the quality has gone down recently.
Ross B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,39,4,5.0,11/1/2016,"Always satisfying and delicious with generous portions and creative/delicious sides.  Ordered the chicken costoletta which has a crispy coating and a light, creamy lemon sauce, angel hair pasta and asparagus.  Some new flavors of cheesecake to try in the future...too full after this visit to try!"
John J.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/28/2016,"Always on top of their game, I have never had a problem once at this particular location. The portion sizes obviously are massive, but they don't lack in flavor! Love this place."
Michele H.,"Altadena, CA",15,20,3,4.0,2/14/2016,"Good food. New menu. Salads are improving.  Wine menu needs a lift, but this location is nice.   Samosa's are always a winner, even though they are a tad spicy for me.  We had a pleasant server. Prompt and courteous."
Noon A.,"Glendale, CA",7,30,7,1.0,12/27/2015,"Silverware was gross. Plate had left over food particles on it. Simon, our server was nice. But that's about it. One star, merely because of Simon."
Jaime C.,"Glendale, CA",201,3,4,1.0,5/10/2017,"I came here last night with my family for my Dads birthday (he absolutely loves this place) and we are seated immediately and get our drinks but our waiter was literally standing there waiting for our orders. This place has a HUGE menu. I had to go through this thing 5-6 times to make sure I knew what I wanted, I felt so rushed. He didn't have any personality, he didn't smile. It was one of the saddest waitering experiences I have ever witnessed. But I figured out my order. Cuban sandwich with a Caesar side salad. So yummy. When we were finishing up and the waiter asked if we would like boxes. I still had salad left and BOTH sides of my sandwich only one side was eaten half through. Handing him my plate knowing he will pack up my order for us and all excited for my salad the next day. BUT NOPE. Here I am at home looking at only one half of my sandwich while the rest of what was on my plate was discarded. What I payed for and didn't get to finish and was looking forward to got discarded. How lovely."
Ray R.,"MONTROSE, CA",1,7,,5.0,4/21/2017,This place is amazing. Cheesecake factory's my favorite restaurant but the girl I've been talking to for 3 months doesn't like it so we never go. If it were up to me I would go to cheesecake everyday for the rest of my life.
Moni Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,24,4,2.0,10/3/2016,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a handful of times and I always say, ""I'm never coming back."" Nothing special about this place, the food is subpar, rich and always over salted. I waited over 15 minutes to receive my check the last time. I can say I won't be returning, there's much better places to get a bite of food. The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is probably their bread."
Aj A.,"Chatsworth, CA",12,210,2030,3.0,11/12/2014,"I have to say our server was right on the dot. She was very attentive to our needs and she constantly kept on checking on us. Oh yeah, the place was packed so and we still got excellent service. ***** for the service. The food on the other hand was just OK.   Pasta with Chicken and Scampi sauce-The pasta was cooked perfect and the sauce was creamy delicious. My problem was with the chicken pieces. Cut too big and they were not soft and tender. They were rather chewy. I did not finish them all, just ate few pieces. *** for this. Vegan Jambalaya- My daughter's favorite dish. Made out of Pasta instead or rice. Did not have enough sauce she had to order extra. **** for this. Bread was fresh. Asked for ranch dressing for dipping instead of butter.  They give you validation. I am not sure if it was 2 or 3 hours.  Parking at this Mall is very expensive if you are spending the whole day. We arrived at 12 until 7, with the validation still ended up paying $18.00."
Rachel P.,"Arleta, CA",230,4,,1.0,2/7/2017,"My family and I go to Cheesecake Factory maybe 4 times a month.. now that's a lot... why because we really like it... but today I had the worst experience!!!! And on my mom's bday! A manger by the name of Tamra scolded my kids! In front of me! Instead of telling me what happened she yelled at my kids like they were hood rats! My son and daughter were coming back from the restroom and decided to run, my daughter stopped but my son didn't. The manager comes up to our table, looks at my kids directly and scolded them. She didn't even bother to ask who the mother was so she could of spoken to them directly. I spoke to the other manager that was there and informed him of what had happened... he stated that he would talk to her and have her apologize...when she came to our table it felt like she didn't even want to apologize and just said it to satisfy the manager. She even said that she thought that my daughter was the mom! Ok..my daughter is 10! She has so many excuses.. first of all she shouldn't have assumed anything... and second of all.. so if she thought my daughter was the mom... she thought it was ok to yell at the customer?? What kind of managers do they have and what training do they provide them. This lady TAMARA .. let me say has been the worst manager I've ever ever had to deal with. Quality control sucks.  What was worst was the apology was not sincere."
Khurram I.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,8,,1.0,11/18/2016,Americana Glendale Location Frustrating and a bit more  FRUSTRATING..specially after they make you wait 40 minutes just so they can give you that device which would buzz in another 45 minutes and then one server came and offered to seat us outside.. we are with a 15 month old and it's cold... its fine i get it you guys are busy.. but we'll since I asked for a booth I was handed that buzzer again.. now that it rings and approach counter I am asked to wait on the side and wait for my name to be called...now we are seated   in the aisle  which hardly fit us and we are in a way of every customer that passes by ... that's fine too but then after taking the order not even water came to the table for another 30 minutes.... WHY DO YOU GUYS TAKE CUSTOMERS THAT YOU CAN'T HANDLE... OR HIRE A BIT MORE TRAINED STAFF For restaurant... rather than on call models... Oh and our little one dropped our settings from the table ..so now we are without any fork or spoon to eat with and no one is going to ask anytime soon
