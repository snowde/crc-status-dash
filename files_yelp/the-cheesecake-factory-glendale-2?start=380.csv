Brandon S.,"Pasadena, CA",54,14,7,5.0,5/1/2016,"Just stop by for a light snack. The weather is beautiful today, great atmosphere. The food was great and our waitress was amazing.  Thanks Jocelyn for the amazing customer service.. You were very attentive and moved throughout your tables very efficiently. CHEF ROB would be proud of you.  Pure awesomeness. And BOHAN  although you have little arms the Beard makes up 4 it. Haha. You have a great personality and good sense of humor. Cheesecake is lucky to have you...."
Shannon M.,"Burbank, CA",21,396,21,2.0,11/11/2015,"The menu is ridiculous. So many pages of different dishes they created a book for their menu. The appetizers alone take up 3 whole pages!  I've been here several times, and the food is hit or miss. I love the caesar salad, their tex mex egg rolls and the sweet corn tamale cakes are great, and of course the endless cheesecake is always a selling point.  But today I tried the chicken chipotle pasta. It was not good. It tastes like a taco, but in pasta form. I thought the peas were an odd vegetable choice, and the dish was topped with these fried tortilla chips. Just bizarre."
Haydee T.,"Glendale, CA",9,115,2610,3.0,3/21/2015,"I love the cheesecake factory but from back in the day. the quality has gone down but still a good meal and high quality items. what I mean by the quality has gone down is this. the pasta dish I always order . use to be  wide past and chicken flavored with the flavors' of the recipe.  this dish was always sooooo hot that the menu has warnings of heat and when I was pregnant and ordered this dish the informed me that it is so hot it could induce labor.  Now when I order this dish I have discovered... thin skinny pasta and not even spicy hot. the chicken bland and just added to the sauce. when I ask it make it spicier  A. they don't B. The answer to that was let me bring you some pepper flakes, which he didn't bring.  but regardless pepper flakes is not the same hot as the cayenne pepper hot that the dish is made with and just needs more of.  so I guess you can not add to a dish that is already pre prepared  back in the day the dish was prepared together not place item on top and ad sauce. and very little sauce at . the waiter brought us more sauce from the start due to he said "" I brought you extra sauce since everybody want's more sauce""  if the demand is more sauce to each customer why are you serving dry pasta on a wet pasta dish???? my husbands dish completely different menu item the chicken tasted just like my chicken . bland . it seems like chicken is just boiled in salt water and added to any dish as needed.  As for this location......  fake friendly. what  I mean is lots of OH Yes no worries. still lots of mistakes.  no consideration, no jump to make things better. sloooowwwwww service. we were there 2 hours just waiting. waiting for a table , waiting for food, order was no shrimp , shrimp arrived waited for new order, just too much. many times our experience is the same. A ~just we are the cheesecake factory well oiled machine that is going to make our money anyway so we do not care about customer service~  I find in the marina del ray location the ambiance and feel and customer service is more pleasant . going to try Pasadena next hope its better than Glendale location. Glendale is my local stop and will still stop in but maybe just not for my favorite just drinks and appetizers."
Leilani I.,"Glendale, CA",77,35,6,5.0,9/9/2016,"I'm always craving the Hershey's Cheesecake and Fettucinie! BEST PART about this location??? Fech24 offers delivery !!! They are speedy and precise, not sure if Cheesecake delivers in-house bu I definitely recommend using fech24 for delivery, they are always so nice and never forget my complimentary bread"
Jade H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,2,1.0,10/2/2016,"I came in today to enjoy their foods but it's so frustrating when I got my order--Renee's special. The soup was served cold and no soup spoon with it.  Then since I ordered the chicken almond sandwich, the chicken wasn't cooked well!!!! I lost my appetite. Then my husband offered me his food (Chilaquines) and boy they're way so bad too, part of the chicken was cold and part was warm...yes the presentation was good but I guess they just microwave their foods here.  Can't even warm them enough.  I would like to give a 0/5 if possible.  The food quality in this restaurant is very poor. Their service is below average! In this certain cheesecake restaurant---I won't dare to eat again and I will for sure tell my friends about this."
Joanne L.,"Valencia, CA",92,1,,2.0,11/6/2016,"I got a pasta carbonara and pepperoni pizza and shrimp gumbo which were alright. But the service was horrible! After getting our food, our server only checked up on us once right after to ask us about our food and after that it was a nightmare. I was here with 2 other people so once the shrimp gumbo was delivered, the server said she'd be right back with a bowls and spoons for us to share. 15 minutes pass and she's nowhere to be seen and our server is nowhere to be seen. So we asked another server who then went and just brought back ONE spoon. So now, we're trying to find another person to ask for spoons and plates and when we finally flag down someone else, they said they'd let our server know. Another ten minute passes and still no spoon or bowls. Finally, we see our server and after half an hour of asking servers for three spoons and bowls, we finally get it."
Armando B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/8/2017,"Me and my girl friend are both servers, we left our restaurant to eat some where ""nice"" the food was good the service sucked my server was a black girl that sadly didn't induce her self so that's all I can say I gave her 30% tip cuz I felt bad maybe she was busy butt she went out of her way swapping my validation with hers like she thought I was an idiot once I called for the manger she gave me mines back saying oh may be I stamp it wrong like if we didn't know her part time job was almost over .. Last time i give a tip for piddy"
Shirley W.,"Alhambra, CA",300,219,577,4.0,2/18/2015,"This location has the best service of all Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  It was jam packed on the rainy Saturday night, we had to settle with the bar area since we were starving and don't want to wait 45 minutes. The servers were tentative, and made some great suggestions on what to order. I had the skinnylicious angle hair with shrimp, my friends ordered the meat ball lasagna with prosciutto, and pamersan chic hen pasta.  The portion of the food from the regular menu is huge, I would call it family sized. The skinny menu is perfectly portioned for one, and they do use a yogurt instead of heavy cream for the white sauce. That compromised the flavor quite a bit, so I was not super happy with the taste, but it only has 500 calories. In comparison, the regular menu with full on ingredients are much tastier--I could taste the generous olive oil and heavy cream and cheese topping. The flat bread with pear and blue cheese was delicious, and of course we had to end the meal with a lovely slice of white chocolate macadamia cheese cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!! Speaking of an happy ending! Will definitely recommend the restaurant!"
Mr B.,"La Crescenta, CA",0,99,,3.0,1/11/2017,Great food great bartenders fast service at bar for breakfast but my three star rate is for the ridiculous kids sitting at bar thing WTF ? when we go to have a great brunch early in the morning and spend well over a hundred bucks on drinks and food for 2 hrs it is very clean great atmosphere and then all the sudden people start bringing their screaming ill-behaved kids to sit at bar they kick the foot panel they cry they scream etc and the parents just set there in a daze not hardly spending a dime on food or drinks and most of the time they are just using the establishment for a place to sit while waiting for a movie at the theatre I'm fed up with it and we no longer will go here every week. yes I know cheesecake factory had a permit for this but it is stupid as hell
Kenny H.,"El Monte, CA",0,16,11,1.0,5/26/2016,"I usually love cheesecake factories and always go to the ones in Arcadia and Cerritos but since I was in the area shopping I decided to have a quick lunch here. The wait wasn't long (like 5 minutes) for 2 people. The food was just as good as the one at the other locations but the thing that ruined our lunch was the waitress. She was very passive aggressive and seemed like she didn't want to attend us. Mind you, she only came to our table a total of 5 times. To greet us and take our drinks, to bring us our drinks, to take our order, bring the food, and then for the bills. Not once did she ask if we needed a refill on our drinks nor did she check up on us.  I had ordered a San Pellegrino and my friend ordered an iced tea. My San Pellegrino didn't come with ice. At other locations, ice is always provided but this time it wasn't. Then when we got our food we never saw her come to us. She went to the other tables, started conversation with the other guests, but to us she wouldn't even look at us. 10 minutes past by after we were done with our meal and she came and asked if we wanted the bill. We wanted dessert but after playing the waiting game we decided to go to sprinkles instead of cheesecake.  The blonde waitress with tattoos introduced herself as sky but the name on the bill said Brittni, and another waitress said my waitress name was Tiffany. Sky/Brittni/Tiffnay or whatever her name is, should treat all of the customers with the same respect. Never coming to this location. I'll just stick with the Arcadia one."
Suzanne I.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",24,51,86,3.0,7/9/2016,Every cheese cake I've been had the worst service! Takes forever to get your food and always packed and not staffed enough. Been waiting 40 minutes to get our food! Grrr annoying! I always get chicken Madeira! My favorite! Georgia peach drink is Great!
Kacie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,2,1.0,4/4/2017,"It seems the staff cannot keep up w/ the demands of this restaurant. Initially, I called to place a carry out order - I was put on hold, and the person never came back. I drove to the restaurant and placed an order at the counter. I was told it would take 20-25 min. An hour and 15 minutes later, I got my food -- a vegan Cobb salad, vegetarian pasta, and a slice of red velvet cheesecake (nothing too complicated). On top of that, I had to pay for parking since it took over an hour. The cashier was very apologetic and threw in an extra slice of cheesecake, but I won't be returning."
Vadim d.,"Los Angeles, CA",224,395,46,4.0,9/19/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is!  And while you can't expect something new or gourmet, you can always expect cheap prices and lots of food.  Their happy hour is especially a good deal!  The service is always spot on. I don't come here to be blown away.  I just come here when I am hungry and with a big group.  It doesn't take much to get a fill."
Cam C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",520,579,974,5.0,12/5/2013,"I came for brunch on an excellent day and had an excellent server, Alvin, who introduced himself as one of the chipmunks.  We came right before the rush so had plenty of their freshly baked bread (you know those sweet brown ones we all love) with butter. I think we asked for extra three times. I ordered off the lunch menu and ended up with a beautifully prepared herb crusted salmon. Presentation was beautiful, taste was pretty darn  good, only problem was it wasn't hot."
Richard B.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,51,9,1.0,1/2/2017,"Rude and mean server. Would not take our party of 25 and made it a big deal.  Told us the wait was going to be 2.5 hour even though we would sit in different area. If i could give no star, i would. Would definitely not come back. Will be in contact with corp soon"
Patrick G.,"Glendale, CA",13,35,4,1.0,3/6/2017,Very rude servers. I waited 85 minutes to get a fork as my fork was dirty. We were still working on our plates when the server left the bill on our table with attitude. I felt so embarrassed as I had guests from overseas. Very slow service. Very small portions compare to other Cheese Cake Factories.
Alina M.,"Glendale, CA",5,23,35,3.0,4/1/2015,"I give this place 3 stars because I have ordered so many things were they screwed up then I am still upset. BUT I now only order things I have tried so for that reason I would give it a 5  I love heir buffalo blast appetizers as well as their avocado roll appetizer. As far as a meal goes, I only get the ranch bbq chicken salad or their children Alfredo pasta.  One thing I hate about this place is that heir portions are way to bigggg!!"
Diane R.,"Glendale, CA",113,18,4,1.0,10/12/2015,"I am so very disappointed.  This used to be the best deal - healthy food, huge servings, reasonable prices.  We went tonight because I am recovering from the flu and behind on dishes.  I am so disappointed.  I ordered my usual Chinese Chicken Salad.  There was no wait to get a table, by the way, and I found out why.  I was served a huge plate of iceberg lettuce with a mound of tasteless Chinese noodles on top, with a few bland bites of chicken and canned mandarin orange slices.  What happened to the delicious California greens????!!!! I asked the waiter if there had been a menu change, to which he replied simply ""yes"".  I told him I was very disappointed in the iceberg lettuce - nobody I know likes it anymore - had anyone else complained?  ""No.""  I asked, hypothetically, ""Why would they change a thing like that?!""  He replied, ""It was a decision by corporate."" So there you have it.  Worthless non-nutrition.  Tasteless food.  Not the best way to make money -- this place used to have lines out the door - 45 minute waits - and for good reason.  Now -- well I'm not giving them another chance.  It only takes one lousy meal to lose a long-time customer forever. PS-I asked him if they still had baby greens, to which he replied, yes they did (that and romaine (which is similar to iceberg, only slightly better in nutrition) and I asked him if he could bring me a small bowl of it and then I would be satisfied.  I was given a bowl of romaine.  I don't think he or the kitchen even knew what baby greens are anymore.  I could taste the fillers in my daughter's meatballs (breadcrumbs and low-quality beef with gristle) as well."
Valerie P.,"Downtown, Glendale, CA",112,2,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Their Fettuccine Alfredo is very watery and strawberry smoothie is watered down, more of an icee than a smoothie"
Jess D.,"La Crescenta, CA",147,218,156,4.0,1/4/2015,"My mom and sister love this place because they offer So much variety and it's close to where we work.  We usually get a margarita pizza and side caesar salad for the table to share which is the best pizza I've ever had. It's so thin, crispy and just right. The salad is also crunchy and creamy enough, it's just the garlic in it is sometimes hard to digest.  The tex mex eggrolls are also a winner on our table, it's just a bit spicy.  So my favorite thing on the menu is the americana cheeseburger. It's the best cheeseburger I've ever had, it is So cheesy, meaty and filling. Just eat this and it's all you need for the whole day lol  Chicken Marsala is also a nice comfort food Service is also overal always 3-4/5 Will always be back, thanks!"
