Peter S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,7,4,1.0,12/7/2017,One of the worst service ever! Waited 45 plus min for our food and still not here! About to walk out of this shit hole!
Frank S.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,172,240,1.0,12/24/2016,"I'm beginning to think that the Cheesecake Factory may not be what it use to be.   This is literally the 2nd time in a row a t this location that the service has been mediocre.  I give up!  Waited for over 10 minutes with no service!  Then....At towards the end of dinner, I requested a manager and a manager never took the time to show up.  DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION! TERRIBLE."
Joelle K.,"Burbank, CA",65,13,3,3.0,12/27/2017,"The food here is sometimes good but some times not so great. All the times I had been here the service was amazing but this time I went the service was not so great. The waitress didn't smile, wasn't friendly, talked with a attitude with my friend and I and hardly came to check up on us. Maybe the whole hour we had stayed there she only came once and that was about it."
Nova N.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/22/2017,You can not accept anything better then this very busy place nice staff. I love to seat out side to have some view but most of the time they dont have spot for me and family. Over all if you like to wait for table go to plsce place.
Lindsey K.,"Acton, CA",9,42,37,5.0,12/19/2017,"Okay, so I am not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory so I am rating this solely on when I do go there, which is during Christmas time. My husband, family and I have been doing this for the past 8-9 years. We sit outside and have a gorgeous view of the Christmas tree and lights. They have heating lamps so it isn't too cold. The service has always been good- so they never lack there. It was extremely hard for me to find a dish that I'd actually be excited to get each time I go, versus just being excited for the view/ambiance. This past time we went (last week) I have finally found a dish that I'd order again and again. The Seared Ahi Tuna. Being a big fish eater, I was always concerned getting a fish dish from a place that serves so many different types of food and doesn't really specialize in any particular entree, but I am so glad I gave it a shot. It was seared perfectly. The veggies and rice were cooked perfectly. This place is a must go to during the Christmas season. I highly recommend it."
Billy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,94,2,3.0,12/11/2017,I ordered a salad and the lettuce didnt seem that fresh for being a 20 dollar salad. Probably not ont eat here again for a salad
Hailey D.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,154,444,5.0,5/23/2017,"I like this location. Have been here many times, almost always get the grilled salmon from their skinnylicious menu. It has been consistently cooked to perfection.  I hate over-cooked fish. They get this one done just right for me, each time. I'll include a picture of the fish cut in the middle so you can see.  I like to douse my salmon in lemon juice and a touch of Tabasco. Yum! Of course, the bread goes without saying is one of the best. I do have to warn you, stop eating the bread or you'll get too full before your meal arrives. I do it every time.  They validate for parking, so make sure you get your ticket stamped before you leave."
Rachel E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,21,132,4.0,10/9/2017,"Saturday brunch was solid. Our service was good and efficient. Cheese artichoke dip and avocado egg rolls were delicious. Omelette was perfectly done, not overlooked, which I hate."
Edward T.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,27,4,1.0,1/6/2018,"Yesterday during happy hour , the Arminian lady refuse to give us a booth , she said it's reserve for non happy hour clientele only !  I think this is another form of discrimination ! Just because we order happy hour we are subject to regular tables the left overs !  How sad discrimination existed because another party of her race was given a booth. Right away"
Fritz V.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,9,5,3.0,11/13/2017,This is the first Cheesecake Factory I've been to in such a long time. I went on a Sunday night and packed! it was about a 40 minute wait (which wasn't bad). The bread and butter was delicious and fresh. My boyfriend ordered the catfish (it was pretty good but a bit greasy). I ordered the chucked mushroom pasta which was decent at best. The waiter was kind and attentive.
Michael C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,2.0,8/15/2017,"Just had lunch - indoor.... Clean and a nice temperature - as usual .... However, the Asian chicken salad that I ordered had only 5 or 6 pieces of chicken - literally finger-nail size    $13.95 Buyer Beware !"
Spencer H.,"San Diego, CA",196,712,4863,3.0,11/1/2016,"I've been to many different locations and this one is on par with the others except for one thing - which I will mention in a bit. The service is fine, attentiveness is average.  We ordered the classic burger and the lunch salad/pizza. I didn't eat the burger but it looked fine - bacon was added to the burger, and as a note it's on the less cooked side.  The Caesar salad is fine - the Caesar dressing seems to be more of an oily dressing than usual.  The Lunch pizza is where I bring attention. I ordered the pepperoni and it looked fine when it came out. I started to eat it and then I noticed that it had some sort of strange smell, so I smelled it and I thought it maybe was just a different pepperoni. I started to smell the rest of the pizza, such as the cheese and crust. I couldn't put my finger on it because the entire pizza smelled like this item. After eating half of the pizza, we realized that it probably smelled like bleach. I was worried I was going to get sick, so I kind of stopped eating it but then I thought well it means they clean but maybe they spilled bleach into the crust or something. Thank goodness I turned out OK.  Aside from this incident at this particular location, the Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite places to go."
Sami S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,109,296,1.0,8/14/2017,"Seriously folks, this was the very first time that I have ever stepped foot in a Cheesecake Factory, and probably will be the last time. I always thought of the Cheesecake Factory much like the Spaghetti Factory but just one step higher, but now I think of it as just a 1/2 step higher. The reason for our big discount on my receipt was that my guest had to complain about the broken glass under our table near his feet (someone before us broke a glass salt shaker).  When my guest mentioned the glass under our table to the waiter at the time we placed our dinner order, the waiter looked under our table saying ""OMG!"" but he never brought anyone over to clean up the broken glass.  When our dinner plates finally arrived they gave my guest only 2 small shrimps with the rest chicken chunks and pasta. My guest complained to the waiter and the dinner server about not having enough shrimp, so the waiter requested some more shrimp. When the shrimp (just 4 more pieces) finally came 15 minutes later my guest food had gotten cold. When he asked if they have a microwave to re-heat his plate the waiter said, ""Sorry, we do not have a microwave."" I then offered to the waiter buy this place a $13 microwave at Big Lots. The waiter thought that was funny. When I told to waiter to ""Just blow on his dinner to make it hot again"" he just laughed again and thought that was funny too.   My guest left a bit upset about his dinner and having to take his dinner home in a doggie bag, but I have to say that I did warn him ahead of time about choosing to go to this place for dinner since I saw the low rating of this location.    On the other hand, my dinner was just ""okay"" but bland tasting and a bit luke-warm. I did not complain about anything during our time at this place because my friend was doing all the complaining about this place himself."
steph s.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,33,1,1.0,12/6/2017,i just ordered delivery and one of my dishes was a $17 fettucine. the portion is a joke. i can't believe they have the audacity to send this small plate and charge me $17. absolutely ridiculous
Luis M.,"Burbank, CA",103,57,22,2.0,8/19/2017,"Have mixed feelings about this place. The food was alright but the service needs serious improvement. It was a pretty long wait on a weekday to get a table. When we requested a booth since we saw a couple available, our waiter tells us that they're about to be taken, which wasn't true, they got filled in til about 15 minutes later. I was bothered that they cramped 4 of us into those small tables where you're forced to sit next to complete strangers yet were seating 2 people at various booths. Our waiter was honestly quite terrible, I'm pretty sure he must've been new or training. He spills my friend's drink all over the table and on his food and while he did apologize he never offered to bring a replacement for the food he completely ruined. Food does come in big portions but is just average, nothing special, not worth the wait & service so won't be coming back."
Christine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,8,2.0,10/8/2017,"The food is pretty similar at most locations. However, I was here yesterday and experienced pretty poor service. We had a server who started out well, but she was inattentive at best. We had to remind her more than once for every request. One of our waters had something floating in it, and after that the service went further downhill. She stopped coming around, and we had to ask someone to track her down so that we could put our order in. She brought us full portions of all the lunch items that we ordered. And she asked us if we really wanted to change to lunch portions because the kitchen would have to throw the food away. I really wanted to pipe back at her that she could just readjust the order and let us keep the food instead. I felt like she was staring us down to try to change our minds. In the end we got our lunch portions, but she definitely left a sour note."
Harry G.,"SUNLAND, CA",202,56,3,3.0,11/10/2017,"Americana is a beautiful place that attracts all types of people. I prefer many of the other restaurants at The Americana. Cheesecake is crowded, noisy and a long wait time. Its food is okay at best, but nothing special."
Rome D.,"North Hollywood, CA",4,20,14,1.0,9/5/2017,"Worse place to dine at the Americana. My wife and I stopped in last night after shopping and let me tell you, the management team is weak therefore the service is weak.  1. After waiting about 45mins for a table for 2, the host walks us over to our table. Well the busier was still clearing it off, so the host says as soon as he's done you can sit then walks away. So my wife and I are standing around between other families and their tables looking foolish.  2. We were seated for about 4 to 5 minutes before our server stopped by. When he did stop by he simply slid a basket of bread onto the table and walked away. Then the host returned with menus.  3. After another 5 minutes after that the server comes back by drops off water and says I'll be back.  4. Another 3 minutes the server returned and says ""do y'all want drinks?"" (Clearly this behavior is signed off on by his management team, since he believes when dealing in customer service/ hospitality you should probably introduce yourself) So my wife orders a drink then he looks at me and says nothing but just gives a blank look. So I said ""water is fine, I'm ready to order"".  We place our order and almost 15 minutes later (I had my phone out and was timing him at this point) my wife's drink comes. He drops the drink off and never returned.  I see him taking with some girls in the bar so I flag him down like I'm directing traffic. He comes over and says ""what's up"" (I guess we're homies now). So I asked for the check, at this point we've been setting for about 40 minutes. He give my check to the manager (again didn't introduce herself).  So give a quick summary to the manager. She quickly offers free cheesecake. I declined and told her, I simply want to pay my check and leave.  As I'm waiting for my card, the server shows up with the food and looking confused. So I had to tell him ""no thank you, we're done here"".  Walked across the courtyard over to Katsuya and had a much better experience and time with my wife. I went from BBQ Pizza to Sushi. Not what I was craving but when I'm paying for a service that what I expect simple, polite service. I understand we all have to wait, that's not the issue. The issue here was Service, Etiquette, Hospitality, and Professionalism! My wife and I got none of that.  We won't be back!"
Angela M.,"Burbank, CA",172,224,143,3.0,4/3/2017,"Sadly disappointed in my service last week. Went here for a late lunch and ordered 2 salads. Took about 50 mins to get our food. I'm pretty sure the server forgot to put them in (which happens) however he was avoiding us and acting really awkward rather than just apologizing and giving us some kind of accommodation. Food was tasty but I was shocked in the lack Of service since Cheesecake Factory workers are usually some of the best waiters...... management needs to be more involved on the floor directly rather let servers ""attempt"" to resolve issues, especially when they don't resolve anything at all."
James Y.,"Cerritos, CA",311,115,23,4.0,11/9/2017,"Farfale with Grilled Chicken and Roasted Garlic is fire! So bomb! That's probably my go-to entree when I'm eating at cheesecake. Of course, NEVER skip out on the cheesecake! Their cheesecake is done right! The spring rolls are surprisingly good too, as well as their calamari. Only thing they fall short on is their salad. The salad is worse than soup plantation, and hometown buffet's salad bar. For anything else, this is the right place!"
