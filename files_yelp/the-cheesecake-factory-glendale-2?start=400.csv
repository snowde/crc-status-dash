Marco P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,1,1.0,3/16/2017,"Really pissed off. I talked to the waiter ""Pete"" ""Peter"". Something like that. I gave me an advance tip because it was my sister and dads birthday. I didn't want anything extra but to have a good dinner with the family and everything go smooth. The service was bad. In never got my food. He came and apologized, blamed it on the chef that he has been doing this all day. Blaming him that he has been missing plates and not finishing the orders right. The rest of the family ate. My dad just watched me sit there wait for my food. My mom offered me food and so did my girlfriend. It was awkward. They were just about done when I got my plate. Super hot, i took it home because f**k, I paid for the whole dinner. He took that plate off the bill.. that's ridiculous. What kind of service is this.. we pay for the food and service and it was crappy. I won't be going to this location anymore and I hope you don't get that waiter. Very disappointed."

Queen B.,"Alhambra, CA",78,8,,5.0,9/25/2015,"I have been going to different cities for Cheesecake Factory. My husband and I along with our little dog  went 2 nights ago with my step daughter and her BF. ALthough it was a long wait (45 min) for table for 4, I did not mind at all. The staff, they were very nice and courteous. The wait for indoor was less.  I have always ordered the same pasta which is the shrimp angel hair. But that night I ordered something else for a change and it was absolutely delicious! Not to mention the amount of food for the price! I had to take 1/2 home and ate it the next day and it was still great! The service is excellent and I will come back here again for sure! AAAA+++ rating! Love love love!"
Maru M.,"North Hollywood, CA",84,4,1,1.0,10/3/2016,"waited 15 minutes at the bar area for a menu and order drinks. Ordered bread, took another 15 mins for it to come. Drinks came, short of a straw. Ordered food- ahi carpaccio, crab cakes and a cheeseburger. 25 mins + and still no sign of food. Waiter, is clueless, introduces us to another waiter and tells us that was our waiter. SMH. Still waiting....#wow"
Rochelle L.,"Pomona, CA",193,10,10,3.0,4/12/2015,"So we went here for my sister's birthday and the food was A+ (I got the Monte Cristo sandwich for Sunday Brunch) and the service was A+ but my forks were dirty. I was holding on to a piece of cheese or something crusted onto the underside of the fork??? So I was like no biggie, I got another fork here. But nope. That one was crusty at the end, too, but on the top side and not as much but still ew. LOL. So yay for service and food. Ew to the dirty forks"
Whitney P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2785,365,400,4.0,8/7/2014,"If you want gain 10 pounds in one meal, this is a good place to start.  I've been to a million of these locations throughout my youth but have not been in years and years.   We actually came here to try some of the cheesecakes for our wedding.  We had a small backyard wedding only 14 guests so we were not going all fancy and having a huge expensive wedding cake.  What led us here was over the holidays my mom's friend brought over a lemonchello mascarpone cheesecake from Costco that was pretty much the best dessert I've ever had.  Costco only carries it during the holidays so it wasn't available for our wedding, so we searched and found a similar one here we wanted to check out. It's the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, it was SO good, but not as good as the Costco one.  It was definitely good enough taste wise for the wedding but the way it looked whole didn't have a wedding cake look, so we went to the second runner up, the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which easily doubled as a casual wedding cake.  It was about $50 and we picked it up the day of the wedding. As far as food, I ordered the same thing I used to get when I was a kid, the Louisiana Chicken pasta, it never disappoints, but after about 5 pieces of bread, I can never finish even half of the portion, but it makes for a great doggie bag. The nice part about this location, which we like to refer to as the 'knock off Grove' since it's so very similar, but not quite, the Grove in West Hollywood by our house.  The one thing I did like better about this one was that while you sit outside at the Cheesecake Factory, you can get a great view of the fountain and watch the fountain dance along to the music and rainbows.  It's quite magical if you can forget about the mega mall type shops you're surrounded by in retail hell."
Edgardo R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,1,,1.0,10/2/2016,Cheese cake factory. I was here a few hours ago. I love the food here. Today i felt that me and my family were  discriminated here. They gave me  a really bad service starting from the waiter through the manager.. boy i was really disappointed. I will never comeback to this restaurant again.
Ashley S.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",8,6,,1.0,8/25/2016,"Called ahead on my birthday to see if small dogs were allowed on patio and they said they were. When we got there, manager came out and said that no they weren't allowed. Terrible customer service. I do not recommend this location. Check out Frida's down the street, they were pet friendly and offered our pup water. You need to do much better Cheesecake Factory at Americana!"
John E.,"Valencia, CA",171,272,1474,4.0,12/11/2014,"Took the family out to eat dinner at this Cheesecake Factory in a Saturday night about 7:00.  As usual the wait was 1 hour for a peak night. We always are pleased with the food at CF so we put our name down. At this CF they take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready which is nice.  This way you can roam around the Americana shopping area. Usually you are given a flashing pager and you can't leave the front lobby area so they texting method is nice. We went to Barnes and Noble for a bit and before you know it our table was ready.  Again the food here is great, come hungry because the portions are large. The menu usually has something for everyone in your group including kids. I had the fish and chips for the first time there and wasn't disappointed.  5 big pieces and lots of fries. The slaw was tasty too.  Service was great, our waiter kept out glasses full and checked in often even with the full restaurant.  Had to take some of our plates home but that's ok - lunch leftovers the next day. So much food no room for cheesecake.  Although when I do get cheesecake it's awesome.  So there is a wait but is you don't mind and appreciate good service and lots of delicious food I recommend cheesecake factory. If the place is crowded the food must be good enough to wait."
Jorge M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,3,1.0,9/30/2014,"Big mistake showing up Sunday night . I attempted to get a refund on the chocolate tuxedo I ordered since the whole top was burned .

Long story short no refund left with a cake but no happy Costumer service no good"
Alex B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",160,470,4,2.0,9/26/2015,"To start, the food was good for The Cheesecake Factory. My meal was good compared to other times I've been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants. As for the bad, this place seems mismanaged. When we got there, we were told it would be a few minutes before a table would become available. No problem. We are told the table is available but to stand off to the side. Okay, fine. Then, we move to another area and told that our table isn't ready yet. We wait a few minutes in this little walkway being constantly bumped into by employees and other people. Sure, the overall wait wasn't that long but it's incredibly annoying to go from seating comfortably out of the way to being right in the middle of everything and feeling bombarded. The other problem was that a woman and her daughter were walking around begging for money. I feel bad for the woman and her daughter but when I'm eating is really the last place I like to bother at. The woman went to a few tables and no one gave her money so other people don't seem to want to be bothered while eating as well. With those two problems, it didn't seem like there was someone in charge at this Cheesecake Factory today."
Lauren V.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,7,3,1.0,5/29/2016,"We went to the cheesecake factory on a saturday during lunch. Waited for over an hour with 2 diabetics and a handicap. They kept telling us that they were waiting for a table when we asked 4 times how much longer. They told us that the manager was supposed to speak with us earlier and it wasn't until the wheelchair was blocking part of the hallway did he come out to us. When we complained that the wait had almost doubled from the estimate the hostess with the curly hair said well we are only 10 minutes over your wait ( in reality it was 20 minutes). The front desk was incredibly rude, unprofessional, and the attitude that was given to my aunts, mother, best friend, and myself was uncalled for. Cheesecake factory usually has a great friendly staff in their other locations around southern california and las vegas."
Christian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,7,1.0,3/23/2017,"Went to CF on 3-18-2017 for dinner.  Busy as usual.  When the hostess took us to our table it was not ready and very dirty.  They cleaned the table but did not wipe down the seating area.  I sat down on some type of oily bread crumb and it stained my Theory shorts.   The stain will not come out, I should have stayed home...."
Serge G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/18/2015,It's good. I went there once and I heard it was a good place and decided to give it a try and it was beyond swell there is tons of food but I only have a problem with the menu cuz it's kinda big.  Story time: one time I ordered a burger that was so big (I didn't know it was that big) it took me 2 days to finish it. Went to sleep with a stomach ache but I don't care cuz it's delicious
Amy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,12,2,4.0,6/21/2015,"So yes, the place where one plate can feed 3. Come with a big appetite. There food is very filling, so you might have to get you cheesecakes to go. Overall my server is always upbeat and seems to know what is going on. The wait is kinda long and they don't take reservations over the phone which is upsetting if you have a party larger than 4-6. Parking only lasts for an hour before you actually have to pay, which can also be troublesome. My favorite dishes here are the avocado eggrolls, Bellagio, and the Oreo Cheesecake. All which have more calories than I want to know."
Christopher S.,"Los Angeles, CA",420,144,169,3.0,10/28/2014,"Quick & Easy: Shrimp Bistro Pasta, Chicken Piccata, food took forever.  Down & Dirty: I think people give The Cheesecake factory too much crap for being a chain/franchise. Although it's not my go to, it's a decent place for dinner when selections are limited.  The food here is acceptable, portions are big, but the wait time was way below par. I felt like I was on a research paper assignment while deciding what to eat. This menu is enough for 15 standalone restaurants. I couldn't imagine being a line cook here. I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer and the Shrimp Bistro Pasta, she got the Chicken Piccata.  We waited over 30 minutes for the food to arrive and then noticed that the Stuffed mushrooms never made it to the table.  I could've grown my own mushrooms in that time. The waitress apparently forgot to put it in the system and then blamed it on the kitchen. Now that's some high-class service. But I get it, I blame my farts on the dog whenever it slides by someones nose.  Aside from that, the food was okay. The Shrimp Bistro had good flavor but the texture could've been a bit crispier. I took a bite of the Chicken Piccata and enjoyed the citrus component of the dish. If it wasn't for the company, I'd give it 2 stars but we had some good laughs about it.  Just don't bring a date here for anything special.  That'd be a paramount mistake ending with a cheesecake in your face."
Jessica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,113,42,4.0,12/17/2015,We got their friend chicken pesto and penne pasta with mushrooms and chicken but the pesto was a lot better in my opinion. The penne pasta was too sweet for my taste. It was also a bit dry. The pesto one was a bit oily but it paired really well with the thinly fried chicken.  I didn't know this but they serve fresh strawberries with whipped cream. I don't exactly know what it is but their whipped cream is really good. It's not overly sweet and it's really fluffy. It really paired with the fresh strawberries. The sweet fluffy whipped cream and fresh tartness of the strawberries are a match made in heaven. It was so good! I would buy it again even though it was $7
Vicky A.,"TUJUNGA, CA",0,20,1,1.0,8/14/2016,"Cheesecake used to be a good restaurant a few years ago, however, it gets worse day by day. Last time we were here there was hair in my food when I called the server to show it to him, he took my plate and didn't even even apologize for it. Then, came back and said I'm sorry but we don't see hair in your plate. After that I just decided never to put a foot in this restaurant."
Andy G.,"Burbank, CA",2,4,,1.0,2/25/2017,"I just remembered why I stopped coming here years ago. Hour and half wait for garbage, overcooked frozen food and even worse service."
Tash E.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",362,141,990,5.0,7/11/2014,"Oh i love every cheesecake factory i go to!!!  This location is in the heart of the americana in Glendale. I love it.. When you sit outside you have the view and breeze of the gorgeous waterfall. The staff is usually friendly although sometimes you get a few hiccups in the bunch.  They now have a skinnylicious menu.. Although  i rarely order from it, it has great tasting items for low calories. They always bring out fresh baked bread which i like to dip in blue cheese dressing .  Their lump crab cakes, buffalo blasts , tex mex egg rolls and avocado egg rolls are my favorite..!!! I always get On of those....  I highly recommend any of the burgers , pastas and chicken dishes to share..!! Heck i recommend it all loll..  From 4-6 appetizers are half off..  Not all theres a menu which i have uploaded... Enjoy!!!!!"
