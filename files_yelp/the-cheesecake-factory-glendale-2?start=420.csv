Ren C.,"Bakersfield, CA",254,31,34,3.0,11/24/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this has to be one of the worst location. Super packed, but understandable since its in Americana. Took 2 1/2 hours for our party of 8 plus 3 kids.  We were finally sat and we ordered 3 appetizers to start. Buffalo wings, wontons and the calamari. All of the appetizers were bomb like always but one of their buffalo wings were way under cooked. They need to watch out for those type of things. Our server OW was nice enough to bring it up to management and they handled it for us.  We ordered all of our main lunch entrees, majority of us got pasta. I tried the bistro shrimp pasta and omg it was so bomb! I've tried the pesto before but this one tasted way better! Good suggestion from my boyfriends sister in law.  Taste was delicious! Portion size was pretty big for a lunch size but worth it. Overall after a rough beginning everything ended well. Our server OW was on point, attentive and kind."
Varant C.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",284,160,43,5.0,2/5/2015,"For you Mexican food lovers, try their Baja fish tacos! I got half grilled half fried and it was amazing. Huge portions. A LOT OF FLAVOR."
Suzy A.,"North Hollywood, CA",69,61,23,5.0,7/25/2015,"Service and food are so amazing!! Especially considering how busy they get, they still manage to get your food out in less than 15 mins, and make sure that you are satisfied. Our waiter was really fast and friendly. Portions of the food were huge even though we got the lunch sizes, I still couldn't finish it. I wish I could though because it was delicious. Prices aren't too expensive either, they are good for their portions."
Giel M.,"San Diego, CA",2,52,63,1.0,1/10/2016,Long wait and the last two times I got sick from the food.  It's good for happy hour and thats about it
Casey M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",24,4,6,1.0,8/29/2015,"This is about my visit about 2 weeks ago .... I generally LOVE coming here! We always sit in the patio by the water fountain! Such a beautiful view. It was dinner time ... We got our seat quick so that was nice. However, the waiter took FOREVER to tend to us. Once we finally got service, my and my guest began to talk and relax and unwind. About 20 minutes after waiting, I was starting to get irritated but luckily I had good company. All of a sudden...A HUGE ROACH ran across our table. I started to panic cause I'm deathly afraid of them. Idk if this has to do with us sitting outside or what but I was terrified! I made my friend kill it but I couldn't even enjoy my time there anymore. We just asked for the check (which took another 20 minutes to get), paid and left!"
Laura M.,"Glendale, CA",2,81,,2.0,8/4/2017,"I have to agree with the bad reviews that I see posted over the past few days.  The service at this Cheesecake Factory is definitely not good.  We were seated and the waitress came over and said they were out of bread, which was fine, but 20 min later she brought bread to the table behind us who arrived later.  We ordered a cobb salad dry with blue cheese dressing on the side, they brought it out with dressing.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken from the Skinny menu, which I order all the time and is usually good, it looked like they had put a teaspoon of farro on the plate, it is normally served with quite a bit of farro under the chicken.  There was no flavor in this dish, and we almost finished eating by the time they brought my husbands salad, we took the rest to go.  I asked to speak to the manager, Ashley, and told her the situation, she acted like she could care less and it showed in her body language.  It was not crowded at all outside, there were only two waiters for five tables, at least 7 tables were empty.  So I told the manager, you aren't even busy and there is no service out here.  I would think it would reflect on our bill but no they charged full price for less than adequate food, awful table service and careless management.  I will not make it a point to come back.  There are many restaurants in the area that actually care about good customer service and definitely have better quality food."
Sam P.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",1,4,2,1.0,1/28/2017,This location has bad customer service. We have gone multiple times and each time the waiters hardly checked on our table. Tonight we went in for a cheesecake to go. They were not busy and after waiting 20 minutes at the counter we asked where are cheesecake was. The lady had it there behind the counter the whole time but didn't let us know it was ready and was rude when we asked for it.  Won't be going back.
Elin A.,"Glendale, CA",1,36,,4.0,7/31/2016,"Call me boring, but everytime I come here I order the same thing, either the Louisiana Chicken Pasta or the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. Both are delicious and part of the reason I continue to return time and after time. Trust me, order these dishes and you won't be disappointed!!  The complimentary bread has also got me hooked.  There's nothing too spectacular about the service or the ambiance. I prefer the outdoor seating as the lighting is quite dim inside!  If I'm in the mood for cheesecake, I always go with either the Tuxedo or the Banana Cream, both of which are to die for. I'd eat them everyday if I could, they're that good!!"
Gail A.,"Austin, TX",224,142,308,4.0,9/24/2015,"I will give this big box chain a good rating because it does provide a wonderful place to meet, and this location especially if you sit outdoors near the singing fountains.  In this high-price area, it is an oasis because it offers up its traditional low prices."
Julia B.,"Glendale, CA",45,10,1,5.0,8/15/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants at Americana! Great food, good service! The only downside is that it gets pretty busy on weekends and there is at least 15-30min wait time"
Melissa G.,"SUNLAND, CA",0,63,3,2.0,1/24/2017,"I used to love this place but I'll probably never come back. Shrimp scampi was so bad, each battered and fried shrimp still had the shell completely on, even my husbands was the same. I've never had a battered shrimp that still had the shell. The sauce was sour like sour milk absolutely horrible. Also dirty silverware and a dirty table. The most pleasant part of our visit was the service. Other than that this place is to expensive to be lacking so severely."
Jenn T.,"Redlands, CA",899,939,162,3.0,6/8/2014,"This location is pretty big, very very crowded all the time, but given the location, it's nicely run.  They will take your name down and text you when your table is ready so that you can walk around freely, without a buzzer range chaining you down.  Once seated, the menu is so vast, it takes a lot to pick just one dish!  The portions are huge as always and always reliable.  The cheesecake is where it's at, lots of good choices to choose from.  Parking is either in the parking lots or street.  The staff is friendly and helpful."
Alejandro A.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/11/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but today was the worst experience just to buy a slice of cheesecake! Yes, one slice of cheese cake. The guy literally was ignoring us because he stated with attitude that he was backed up. I continued to be patient but my patience wore off after 25 mins of not being attended. It's unfortunate that the people are what make the experience a bad one. I hope the management can better execute time management for their employees because it was just a waste of my time..."
Jennifer L.,"Cambridge, MA",0,4,,1.0,10/3/2016,"Horrible, disgusting hostess experience!  I came here with my two small children and a friend who also has two small children.  We were seated by a host and asked if we could keep one stroller at the table since my toddler was sleeping.  He was accommodating and said yes.  So while we were eating, another hostess (i.e. The horrible hostess), brought patrons to the table next to us.  She told us we needed to move our stroller that had the sleeping toddler to the ""designated"" stroller area.  When we said we weren't going to do that, she said ""I don't care.  Wake the kid up then.  The stroller needs to be moved.""  And made a face.  Other patrons started to help us adjust the tables so we could keep the stroller with sleeping toddler with us.  The rude hostess laid the menus down and just watched until the people she was seating said they wanted to sit elsewhere.  I asked to speak with a manager after experiencing this hostess behavior and attitude and explained the situation.  All he did was say sorry but he didn't give me comfort that he was going to talk to her about her treatment.  As we were leaving, a couple of staff said they didn't know what happened buy apologized.  When I told them, the rude hostess interjected and said ""are you still talking about this?""  The  manager came by and took her away while I was simply explaining that she was extremely rude and shaming us for having a sleeping toddler. Wow!  I thought Cheesecake Factory was suppose to be a family/kid friendly restaurant.  But this person made such a terrible experience for me and the kids that I would never go back here again!"
Andres Z.,"Canyon Country, CA",23,7,,1.0,1/1/2017,"If I could give this place zero stars I would... recently, I've gone twice. The first time, service was horrible and I ordered a Cobb salad and found a plastic twist used to seal the plastic bag in which the bread is packaged in my salad. Second time going takes the cake. Never have I been treated so badly in my life. Was gonna order the steak tacos but wanted to substitute the steak for shrimp, and a Jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp with extra protein. Not only did the waiter and the manager wanted to charge me the plate full price + the extra shrimp, he wanted to also charge me for a full pound of shrimp added to the Jamaican (one pound of shrimp is never gonna be served in a restaurant). I understand being charged extra for shrimp but I'm not gonna pay for the steak that I'm not going to eat. Then both the waiter and manager promptly proceeded to throw the prices in my face ""it's gonna be this much, can you pay?"" Cheesecake Factory is not a high end restaurant, it's a chain, it's preposterous to charge $30 for a plate. Not even high end restaurants charge $30 for a pasta with lobster. Now I wonder if I wasn't Latino would I still get treated like that."
Husam A.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,1,,5.0,7/19/2016,"Food's fantastic and this location's staff is amazing. They're friendly, helpful, and willing to cater to your dietary needs. As a vegan, my server helped me find an option that was satisfying and delicious (vegan cobb ftw!)"
Ryan T.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/2/2017,"Went to eat for Sunday brunch and the manager tamra was just absolutely horrible to us. She raised her voice at us and told us if we didn't like the food we could always leave and not come back. How dare she say that to us!! I was very, very, angry. Asked for another manager, Chris was his name and he showed up and took care of our bill and after explaining to us that we aren't the first to report a problem with tamra, we told him it's just a matter of time before she's looking for another job."
Vitaly E.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,8,,1.0,8/19/2016,"The food is horrible, and there is the most arrogant service I've ever seen. I got pasta and noticed it was warmed in the microwave. When I asked a waiter to exchange it, he told me they can not. All managers in this building want to make costumers unhappy. Never go back and DO NOT RECOMMEND."
Susie K.,"Burbank, CA",53,17,,3.0,2/16/2017,Love their menu and food! Love their affordable prices and their drinks! But this particular location is just too busy! I don't like the wait and then after we're seated wait again! Just way too much! Time is off essence and there are plenty of other restaurants I'd prefer.
Isabelle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",472,122,707,4.0,6/4/2014,"They now text you when your table is ready. Customer service is always on point. They come whenever you need something. More ketchup? Water? Aioli? Mustard? ""Ok, we got you."" Ask for a table outside on a weekend - it's fun watching people posing in front of the waterworks. *peace sign* MUST TRY:  Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries  Luau Salad  Pasta Carbonara Pasta Da Vinci Arugula Salad"
