Ritzi I.,"Studio City, CA",205,129,424,5.0,5/17/2015,"Unlike the other Cheesecake Factory that I have ever been to, this location is by far one of my favorite. Besides the obvious fact that it is at The Americana, and although there is always a wait here, it is worth it. I always get great service here. The staff are always very polite and accommodating. They check on you often to see how you're doing, but not too often that its overwhelming. The food is always good, big portions and its worth your buck. Although this place is good for large parties, the ambience is also dim, very subtle lighting, romantic almost for an intimate night with your SO."
jennifer h.,"Alhambra, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/16/2016,"SECOND TIME ORDERING CATERING AND THEY MESSED UP AGAIN! I expect you to be on your P's & Q's when I call a couple days before to place my order, call to confirm order the day before, and I CALLED THE MORNING OF PICK UP TO confirm order....YOU GUYS STILL MESSED UP!!!  3 times I called to make sure the order was correct and this place never ceases to surprise me at how well they perfected the art of ""making an honest mistake""  __________DO NOT ORDER WITH Paige OR Eric___________ ASK TO SPEAK WITH MATTHEW (RESTAURANT MANAGER day shift) DIRECTLY, he'll offer to give you ONE slice of cheesecake for an order that serves 6 people. you do the math."
Mackenzie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,1,1.0,4/14/2014,"****my sister already wrote a review but I felt it was still necessary to explain why I was upset as well.  To begin with - my family & I come to CF a lot. Though I've had more good experiences than bad ones at this location, I decided to never come back. Anyways, the service sucked. At the moment I just thought whatever, it happens, I get it, they're probably just understaffed & hey- it's Sunday brunch. Being a server myself, I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt & insisted on tipping well (again- I live off of my tips as well & HATE when I get stiffed.) However, after receiving the check, I noticed the server thought it would a great idea to PERSONALLY  UNDERLINE the highest ALREADY SUGGESTED TIP & WROTE ""thanks."" I immediately get upset & tell my mother to pay at the front desk to avoid seeing the servers faces again. While I'm the last one to leave the booth, one of the servers points to my mother & sister & tells the other to run after them. HE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DITCH.  I yelled at him & told him we were paying upfront.  HOW DARE THEY?! Not only did they assume that 1) we weren't capable of reading the SUGGESTED gratuity, 2) assume we weren't even going to tip AND 3) to also humiliate my sister ON HER BIRTHDAY by dramatically stopping her because they thought we were stealing.  I spoke with the manager (or supervisor) Mathew & he was pretty accommodating. He asked me to email picture of the receipt to management & I did it right there on the spot.  After I did so, the server came up to me & apologized for not providing the service that we expected. I explained to her that's not why I was upset but rather her passive aggressive ""thanks"" message she personally hand wrote.  I've never seen this anywhere & it's completely unacceptable. Sorry but they ruined it."
K E.,"Glendale, CA",1,70,2,3.0,6/23/2015,"Nothing to write home about. I've been here only during non-peak times, but the service both times have been mediocre. Once, we arrived late at night, around 10:45 on a Saturday, and there was about a 15 minute wait for a party of 4. The hostess, when getting my name, wasn't particularly warm in her greeting. The hostess the second time I was there (this time in the afternoon on a weekday) was also simply there. The woman who showed us to our table was also cold and merely pointed to our booth and said, ""It's this one here,"" and then continued on her way. Basically, this place feels like a factory indeed - its employees going through the motions, distant and inaccessible.  Our waitress on this second trip was warm and interacted with the kids; unfortunately, she got my mom's order wrong. We asked for then salmon from the Skinny menu, and it arrived with the mash potatoes (the regular menu entre). She also got one of the steaks wrong: we asked for medium rare, and we received a medium well. She made other mistakes, but ultimately, she was pleasant and smiled every time she came by.  The pesto is good and so is the rib-eye steak. But I'd say you could get similar-quality or better food at a lower price elsewhere."
Joseph Y.,"Chatsworth, CA",4999,701,684,5.0,4/7/2014,"Oh how I love The Cheesecake Factory. I usually order the grilled chicken avocado club sandwich with sweet potato fries and it is always made to perfection. My wife orders either the miso salmon or their luao salad and swears by them both. Our favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls that come with some delicious dipping sauce. The service here is great, but the wait times to get a table, particularly on the weekend in the evenings can run you about 45-65 minutes. Make sure not to arrive hungry! They have indoor and outdoor seating with heat lamps.  I particularly like this location because it's located in the Americana so you get to enjoy the atmosphere, take a walk nice walk after, enjoy the water fountain show, go shopping or ride the trolly. Guys, a great place to take your lady on a first date. You'll score points here!"
Jin H.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/5/2017,Always a good experience when going here for lunch.  The menu items are extensive. They are a kids favorite. Thank you.
Ars A.,"Tujunga, CA",24,35,143,1.0,8/6/2015,"Worst worst worst management I've ever seen in my life!!  The manager sucks (Asian guy who was on the floor on the afternoon of 8/5/15)... I called two days in advance to make reservation and been told they don't take reservations.. This is the policy ok understood.. They asked me to be there on the day of the party at 5:30pm to make reservation for 7:30( this was told by one of the managers): so i showed up at 5:30 and all I was told was oh we can't make any reservations now, and I mentioned that I've been told to be here by manager and guess what no f** was given. Manager asked me to check back at 6:30 again..So since already the plan was set for this location and didn't want to change it last min had to work around it and stayed till 6:30. At 6:30 they put me on waitlist and it took them an hour and fifty minutes to give me a table for just 15 people (this wait is after 6:30 but in total I was there for 2.5 hours)!! This tables wouldn't be set if I hadn't set the tables myself!! They made my guests wait and because of their lack of understanding the surprise birthday party for my sister in law was about to be ruined if I had not took an action and start setting the tables!!  A manager should at least have a good planning, delegation, and communicational skills, and unfortunately this manager had none of them!  After causing all the inconvenience for his customers, he didn't even took the time to apologize. This is something that the dumbest manager would know to do as part of their job but this one wasn't even close to dumb... He was wayyyy bellow the level of dumbness!!"
Becky L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,3.0,6/30/2016,"I enjoy coming here once in a while, every time I come it's busy but I mean why wouldn't it be? BUT, Service wise I mean I expected more but it is what it is. The only friendly service I even get is from the host/hostesses. I love the food here! Maybe need to try another location?"
Christina G.,"Lakewood, CA",130,334,3802,5.0,10/15/2012,"I'm a big fan of the cheesecake factory, Went here just for dessert, and was not disappointed! Oreo cheesecake is always super delicious, server was very friendly and attentive even tho all we got was dessert. It was game time and they had football and baseball on in the bar area and could be seen part of the way thro the regular dining area but not heard, which is a great way to have the game displayed.  Good experience!"
Maribel E.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",1,10,21,5.0,7/11/2015,"A good first time. Definitely will be returning, the food was good & hospitality was outstanding."
Miriam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",238,70,2,5.0,7/2/2015,"Its safe to say that all Cheesecake Factories are pretty great, but this location is especially good.  Izeem was my server the other night, and I couldn't have been more satisfied. He was knowledgeable of the entire menu, patient when asking specific questions, and a positive energy to be around! He was WONDERFUL, and I will be requesting to be sat in his section every time! Thanks Izeem for a pleasurable dining experience :)"
J. T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",499,326,137,4.0,6/2/2015,I love every cheesecake factory. From decor to the food and service.  Got the smoked bbq burger. It was so amazing!. Very juicy and tender. Love their bbq sauce.  Also the garlic chicken noodle has great flavor. But for $17.99 id expect more than 5-6 small pieces of chicken. Complimentary bread is super good: )  Awesome service. Def coming back
Nicholas L.,"Los Angeles, CA",360,36,,4.0,5/3/2015,"So everyone and their mom knows about Cheesecake Factory.  It's not the best food, but it's far from the worst.  It's tasty, consistent and offers almost too many choices on the menu.  Not always a bad thing. The real review here goes to their star server Josh, who served us yesterday on a busy night, between the premiere of Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, and the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight.  The place was slammed as usual, but Josh not only provided the best, most attentive service ever, but his personality and sense-of-humor was amazing.  One of the members of our group was on a VERY strict diet, and when he had made mention of wanting an impossibly zero-carb/fat/gluten/calorie/taste carrot cake, Josh brought out a little ramekin of shredded carrots with a cherry on top!  It was the most hilarious (and charming) thing ever. Seriously.  That made our night."
Lilit M.,"Glendale, CA",173,14,2,1.0,4/1/2016,"My friend and I come here at least once a week and we usually have a good experience, but today when we came and they took us to be seated the table was dirty if that wasn't bad enough when we told them our friends were gonna be joining us they told us we could move our table but instead of moving our food they waited for us to move ourselves and then when u think it can't get any worse they bring my food with hair in it!!! SO FREAKIN NASTY. Our waiter kindly took it off my check but then gave me a comment like why didn't u just eat it, it was just a tiny piece of hair? LIKE UHM HELLO WOULD YOU EAT SOMETHING THAT HAD HAIR IN IT???? Worst experience ever"
Ritchie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",146,4,1,1.0,4/16/2015,Very disappointed at this branch.  Found a disgusting dirty spoon on my table when I arrived.  I stopped going to the branch in Santa Anita due to multiple hair strands were found on several of our dish.  I don't even feel like eating here again
Pam M.,"Simi Valley, CA",121,88,50,1.0,10/9/2015,Why say 30 minutes when you mean an hour plus?   Why make the buzzer go off and when I come in side I'm waiting another 20 minutes to be called to a table that isn't even clean!  Now I'm standing outside waiting...... Only advice I can give is if you walk in and see a line almost to the door walk out save yourself the headache and hunger pains and grab something else from the variety of other restaurants. Daniel and team tonight while your food may be great you failed in customer service.
Brenda P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/21/2017,"I am outside the Cheesecake Factory. I just had dinner with my family. Outside, at central street waiting for an Uber a waiter disrespects me saying to me are you waiting for me baby? I wait for my Uber and while I'm getting in he yells baby why are you leaving me?! And gets back in the restaurant with his white uniform that with very clear logo and letters says Cheesecake Factory. They were two of them. One was dark skin and the other one was white skin with a mustache (I think he looked Mexican). It was an awful awful feeling how can they treat women like this just getting out of the restaurant? Anyways I was hurrying up to get in the car while they yelled at me and got back in the restaurant through the central street door. I feel terrible writting this review. I've never been a 'snitch' but if I don't do something about it who will? Are workers at Cheesecake Factory supposed to treat like this to women? Gross."
Vanesa G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,25,22,3.0,5/16/2015,"It started great service app, had the cashew chicken plus hair. Yes hair service was good not gret she forgot about us. Dessert was to die for"
Jenna H.,"Chula Vista, CA",818,295,1232,5.0,4/8/2014,"Cheesecake factory is like my second home!! Since high school, my girls and I came here every friday to eat and update each other. Perfect location for outdoor seatings, high energy of people!  We especially love this location, SHOPPING PARADISE :) Also, perfect area to visit if you have a bf or a gf, very fancy and romantic. Just be careful with all the tourists with cameras flashing at you lol Service here has always been great, come and checks on us frequently. Theres never time where our drinks were empty. I forgot what its called but try something like strawberry lemonade :) rich with flavors. Btw, I've been ordering the same dish for the past years. I only eat fettuccini alfredo and pasta carbonara with a lot of lemons and tabasco sauce.. Yes, I destroy the true taste of the pasta but thats how I like mine :D fantastic! Each plate is about 10-14 depending on if I order shrimp with mine.   Should try this location for their ambience, great service & food. Perfect for group of girls tired from shopping too much."
Frank W.,"Valencia, CA",0,388,10,1.0,6/8/2015,"Worst Cheesecake Factory location that I've ever been to. Took about 15 minutes after we were seated for our server to finally show up at our table. Our server didn't look like she was in a good mood, she had the ""Why do I have to work here"" look all over her. While she was taking our order, she kept rubbing her face and nose. Good thing we checked our silverware before using it, one of the forks was dirty. Our food runner grates cheese over our pasta and drops a giant chunk of the cheese on our table, all he said was ""oops"" and didn't even bother pick-up the cheese and just left. I also saw another food runner dropped some pieces of chicken tender as he was deliver the plate to a table, he noticed that he dropped some of the food but just kept on walking. I hope that table get a discount on the chicken tenders because they didn't get their full size order."
