Kaori T.,"Burbank, CA",1494,793,1274,4.0,9/10/2012,"I am a fan. I have been coming to The Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years and it is rarely a disappointment. .. I always get the Summer Rolls, and sometimes I'll get the Pork Chops.  When I'm feeling like a bad girl, I'll dive into the Shrimp Scampi, Jambalaya, or the Pasta Bolognese. On a good day, I'll get the Cobb Salad... But that breakfast - The Breakfast Sandwich that my mom introduced me to is amazing. As is the Monte Cristo that you can land during brunch sundays. Sit at the bar, and you can watch some sports during a nice breakfast. For the price, it's really reasonable - You think about how much you pay at a smaller joint and the quality isn't as high, and it's not nearly as reliable. I love pretty much everything on the menu... Down to the coffee.  My favorite cheesecakes = Vanilla Bean, Red Velvet, and Strawberry. Oreo (which they appararently renovated) - You are my next target... Until then...."
Linet M.,"Glendale, CA",85,29,83,3.0,10/12/2014,"I love this restaurant a lot , but today , after I checked in ( which was the first time I didn't wait for ever) , our waiter didn't have any idea of customer service , no smile (looks like she is not happy with her job ) , I order avocado roll , I never got it , my child order side of fruit with his food , we didn't get it , and then we had to tell other waiter to bring it for us , she never checked how our food was or do we need any refill in our drinks . I order chicken salad ( hey where is the chicken ) I count it , I count it , was less than 10 pieces in there ( I am not paying for lettuce) , I am so disappointed, I love this restaurant, why they are doing this , it is a busy restaurant, then they should hire employees that they really happy to perform services, I am not a bitch , but sometimes you know , that side comes out , specially when comes to my food"
Myra R.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,14,4,1.0,6/30/2016,"This is second bad experience I had at this restaurant.  Yesterday, I ordered a $20 dish to share.  It came on a super hot plate, but the food was exceptionally cold.  So I asked for it to be heated. 20 minutes later, after most of my party had finished, I was still waiting.  When it finally arrived, they seriously just microwaved it. This I expect when I go to Denny's but when you are paying so much for a meal it's ridiculous.   The wait staff act like we are at a club and they, including the manager had no concern for this issues at the table.  They offered me a cheesecake which I declined as we had already been there so long and then they just carried on.  I get it they are busy, but they should have the same expectations that the other restaurants set for themselves."
Ashelly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,8,3,3.0,1/30/2016,"Had a dinner with my friend Saturday evening . We arrived around 6:15 pm and they told us to wait 45 min, in fact we waited more then one hour .  The place was soooo packed it was crazy ...!!!! The service was good I love the waitress who served us unfortunately I didn't catch her name . As for the food , big disappointment.  I ordered Louisiana pasta and returned it , this is not my first time ordering this dish I don't know what was wrong this time . We wanted the Toxido cheesecake after the server promise it's very good ... No !! It wasn't very good . Next time I will have dulche de leche"
Aram T.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,26,9,3.0,3/17/2016,"The wait is horrible! I hate going to this place on a weekend only because it's so loud and wait times are 20 minutes at best from my experiences here. The food isn't really 5 star quality but I guess you get what you pay for. In this case, it's semi good tasting with a great portion. I feel you can share a full plate with 2 if it weren't too awkward looking in public. To cut it short, food is 3/5, staff are always friendly 5/5, wait time is 1/5 which just evens things out with overall 3 stars."
Paeng M.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,138,151,3.0,8/4/2015,"So I'm a fan... and in full honesty I've only ever had cheesecakes from here, I've never actually ate here.  So this past Sunday, we randomly did and the food was surprisingly really freakin' good. For appetizer we got the fried zucchini, avadodo, and portobello mushroom basket. Seriously, no regret it was fantastic. I've only ever had fried avocado at a bar in hollywood and it's been years, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this on the menu and had to get it. For dinner, my friend had the crusted salmon/ mash potatoes (they don't do roasted potatoes)/ and esparagus (lunch size). He loved it and it filled him up, so also surprisingly they were not at all greedy with their lunch portion. I had the mushroom burger with side salad. Vinagrette on the salad was light and not to sour or sweet, this is a total plus. my burger was B- because the bottom patty was soaked in grease and juice, however the texture was there for the rest of the burger and that's another plus. Even the bread they give you when you first sit down is really good... or maybe I was that hungry. Anyways, to sum this up, I would go again. Price was average for a $$ rating.  Why the 3/5 stars?  MENU needs to be edit down, a little overwhelming.  An even though they were way busy and not to blame our first server for ending her shift and the new server stepping in (though I felt like there shouldn't have been a 25 min gap from taking our drink orders and taking our food orders - - I get it, everyone was busy), it didn't help seeing a BUNCH of the waitresses just texting on their phones and socializing with each other. Why did I notice this, because I and tables around me were really waiting for a fair amount of time to be helped out. And trust me, they have a ton of people working there, maybe only a handful of the waiters looked stressed-out-busy. Get your act together Cheesecake Factory... your staff needs a sit-down and training."
Shawn B.,"Los Angeles, CA",853,71,1,5.0,5/11/2015,Between the atmosphere of the Americana and the classic cheesecake dining we always have a great time here. It's always clean and friendly and their menu selection is crazy.  I give it an extra star because there is no place in Glendale that is better for big parties at the last minute unless on a busy weekend. They have accommodated us so many times and are happy to do so.
Annalou L.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",891,103,24,5.0,3/30/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory for it's wide assortment of American food and of course, cheesecake! The Cheesecake Factory also has the best kind of appetizer bread to exist, in my humble opinion. I live for the dark brown bread!!  Great place to have a fancy dinner or family brunch. Especially in the location at the Americana, it is a beautiful restaurant with a gorgeous outdoor view of the water fountain."
Scotty W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,7/13/2016,"Ordered the hibatchi steak, my date and friends food came out fine, however everything on my plate was cold. I told the waitress, she did not say one word, just took it and brought out another one and this one was just as cold as if it was sitting on a counter for twenty minutes. She never apologized, I downed as much as I could handle (which wasn't much.) and left.  Very dissatisfied with the service and her attitude towards me."
Rowena S.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,11,68,5.0,10/25/2015,"Very surprised that there was no crowd waiting for their turn to be seated. We are seated in less 2 minutes. That's great! It's been awhile that we never been here for that reason but because my daughter chose to eat here. We missed the wheat bread & the usual pasta & wraps. Happy with their new menu ""skinnylicious"" with calorie count ranging 590 & below. Kids enjoyed their food & of course the red velvet cake for their deserts ."
S S.,"Glendale, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/19/2016,"The 'manager' Alicia has absolutely no customer service skills, and needs to be more presentable. It bothers me to even give 1 star."
Karo G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3,,4.0,7/8/2016,Everything was great including food and beverages. Service was a tad bit off... I would've wanted just a little bit more attention for the money I paid to the restaurant and also the tip I left!
Justine Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",493,343,108,2.0,2/15/2015,"Had lunch with my mom and son. Ordered two items, California cheese steak sandwich that comes with regular fries but instead paid extra for sweet potato fries and a burger. Received the sandwich and burger but no fries. Let our server and the woman that delivered our food, on three times and still nothing. Finished our meal and asked them to cancel fries and they removed the fry upgrade from the check.  Servers were nice enough, but couldn't get an order of fries to our table in the hour we were there?!?!  Sandwich without fries?!?! Come on!!  Sandwich and fries were good enough, nothing to come back for. Not a satisfied customer."
Day M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,80,8,1.0,11/29/2016,"This is the second time to this location, and I've been to A LOT of Cheesecake Factory's, in California and other states... This is by far the worst service out of every single one of them! Seated fairly quickly and we were a party of 5...then the wait begins. We wait, and wait....and a waitress comes by to greet us and take drink orders. 4 waters and a Diet Coke takes 20 minutes to come back to us, and the waitress tells us she's handing us off to a colleague. That's fine, we'd just like to order food please. He tells us he'll be ""right"" back. We shouldn't have let him leave. He returns another 15 minutes later to take our food order. Mind you, a few managers have shown up on the floor to start directing patrons to tables and put out fires between servers. I don't know what was going on, but it seemed extra chaotic and somewhat unprofessional being that we were watching these conversations unfold before us.  Food comes out half an hour later, no joke, and with apologies from the server and the manager who accompanied him to our table. We ate very fast as we had limited shopping time and didn't think this ordeal would take so long.  Asked for boxes to pack up what we couldn't eat and our waiter offered to do it for us. We politely declined since we assumed that would take another 30 minutes. Almost...we had to wait another 15 minutes for our boxes and the check. Love Cheesecake Factory, but won't be coming back here anytime soon. Our first visit to this location wasn't exactly stellar, this second visit solidified the fact that sentiment."
Anna H.,"Cerritos, CA",124,76,139,5.0,6/26/2014,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE everything about this place. I love that it's in the Americana and I could walk around with my family. I love that it's family friendly. I love the food there. I love the portion. I love the service. I love everything about it.  Would I suggest coming here? Definitely. You could never go wrong. Bring your husband, wife, kids, family, in laws, everyone."
Megan M.,"Glendale, CA",0,12,1,1.0,11/28/2016,"Disappointing to say the least.   Should have known better than to pick this for my birthday lunch. But was hopeful for a good selection/ salad nearby. Mistake. Our waitresses were not attentive at all. She said she would bring bread while we selected our dishes. We waited. We reminded. She gave us some excuse about it being baked fresh and went over to chat with Jennifer B, another waitress. They gabbed, they bitched loudly about some customer, they checked their phones and receipts. After asking again, we finally got our soggy, cold bread after we got our meal. No apologies. No fresh baked bread. Our waitress never returned. No explanation that she went on break or wherever. We were just suddenly served by Jennifer B who gave us minimal attention.  Staff, Omar, was the only saving grace. He was kind, attentive when asked for something (mustard) and worked feverishly. Jennifer finally brought mustard but well after Omar had and after I had to flag her down. Ridiculous.  If I could tip Omar, over the waitresses, I would have. The food was mediocre at best. Tasteless, bland, yellow lettuce. Sad experience in service and food."
Veronica R.,"Los Angeles, CA",283,112,,4.0,5/30/2016,"We ordered the original cheesecake 6"" to go. It was $18.95. Usually they have frozen and you need to leave 1 hour out before eat. It was great!"
Rose V.,"Glendale, CA",0,26,2,5.0,10/13/2015,"Very beautiful restaurant. This large building has very lovely artwork and designs, great attention to detail and fitting for being in the luxurious Americana. The wait is not so bad if you go for lunch, and for dinner, the wait is understandable. Cool how the hostesses can shoot you a text when your table is ready so you can shop around until then. That makes it very convenient. I've had some of the best service here. The waiters are very friendly, and they are very helpful. The food is amazing, and I crave eating here every now and then. Oh, and the cheesecake...So yummy! So many to choose from, but I very much prefer the plain cheesecake."
Rhumz M.,"Arcadia, CA",84,73,126,5.0,3/15/2014,"You have probably already read about how great this place is. It's nearly always crowded.  Make sure you either make a reservation or get there early.  The food is appetizing.  Our main course was the Luau salad, which was awesome.  It has grilled chicken breast layered with mixed greens, cucumbers, green onions, red and yellow peppers, green beans, carrots, mango and crisp wontons with macadamia nuts and sesame seeds tossed in their vinaigrette.  Piled high- it's an impressive sight.  We started with Tex Mex eggrolls- comprised of a yummy spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese served with sour cream and salsa. And for weight watchers delight, they just added a whole menu with calorie counts at 2 levels."
Mel D.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",375,166,105,5.0,5/24/2015,I love the portion size. Get a lot of bang for your buck. The kale salad is my favorite from the entire menu and it's only 6 bucks. Oh and the servers are always really kind and offer suggestions. You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.
