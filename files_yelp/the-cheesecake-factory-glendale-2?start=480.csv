Ina S.,"Glendale, CA",9,51,19,5.0,4/20/2015,Probay the best service ive had as far as restaurants. They dont look at you like theyre gonna kill u when u ask for extra bread and butter  :)
Juno S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",11,40,38,4.0,3/1/2016,I feel funny eating at the Cheesecake Factory because there so many great local places to eat but the food is consisted & they do curbside which is great when I have my daughter in her car seat and I don't want to disturb her. Great views and a busy bar area.
Jacqueline S.,"Montrose, CA",3,116,,1.0,8/27/2016,"This restaurant is normally my fallback for lunch but today, I had a really bad experience. My companion and I tried to get a seat at the bar. A woman cut us off and took the chair. She had words with us.  The woman, who started all this, insulted me by saying that I was a 'purchased bride'. I am Asian. She also called my companion 'old'. She asked the waiter to call security. When the manager came, he took sides. He stood by during this conversation, then offered to seat us elsewhere. As far as I am concerned, the manager contributed to this situation in which we were discriminated against on the basis of age, sex and race. I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory and been here many times I will never come here again."
Nikki Y.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,22,1,1.0,6/3/2016,"We've celebrated a few birthdays at cheesecake factory before & always had complimentary birthday dessert. So today we decided to go to this location for my sister's birthday. I told our server that we're celebrating her birthday & he looked at us in a weird way. When were about to finish our food, he handed us our bill. I told him again that it was my sister's birthday, so we told him we would like to order a cheesecake. He told me that he charged my card twice & that it'll be fine since the first transaction will be voided. We expected a better experience & hoping we get what we paid for. If we only knew, we would have went to a different place & paid about the same for a better birthday lunch. There are alao cheaper places with better guest service."
Min K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,11,4.0,6/23/2016,"Having been to mutiple locations, my visit today was pretty standard. Food was basic, the usual huge portions. Service was pretty meh - we were seated quickly but didn't get to place any orders for a long while. We came at 5 and noticed some servers leave so maybe the wait was due to a shift change. Otherwise we enjoyed our meal."
Iliana A.,"Huntington Park, CA",4,8,1,1.0,12/19/2016,It was my step daughters 16 bday dinner so we went to. Go have dinner at the cheesecake factory we get there at 800 pm and its a 20 minute wait plus ten more after and 10 more after the first 10 so 40 minute wait which we don't mind this was Dec 15 a Thursday so as we are seated we order 4 waters with lemon wedges our appetizers and our plates of food not to mention the kid has school the next day her eyes are puffy due to going to bed early not to mention a waiter comes at 950 pm to let us know they don't have the food I ordered that they didn't have those ingredients no more so we asked for our bill to pay and leave then the manager comes with the server and all the dishes with food it had turn out it was a mistake .... I completely understand a busy restaurant but as busy as it gets they should be more organized with their order and tables.... We didn't pay for the appetizers thanks to the manager he was so polite and nice but I do apologize the service was so bad I had never ate so much bread with butter I was starving
Regina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",302,167,102,5.0,1/20/2015,"I really, really love the service at this Cheesecake Factory. First of all, my waitress was super gorgeous. I mean, she was beautiful. Not only the way she looked, but the way she talked, she called us ""lovebug"" or ""hun"" or things that would make us feel special. Call it manipulation. Call it hospitality. I call it, ""OMG YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE OF HOW NICE YOU ARE."" Water cups were filled and refilled again. I ordered a Midori Sour, which was made very alcoholicky (as alcoholic as Midori Sours come, anyway...) They took really good care of my seafood allergy and made sure not to cross-contaminate anything. Fried macaroni cheese balls are a MUST at this Cheesecake Factory--they really, really know how to do them (better than the other Cheesecake Factories, except for maybe The Grove.) I got the Chicken Fettucini with the sun dried tomatoes and pink sauce--pink sauce was perfect, Fettucini was perfect and piping hot, and there was a generous amount of chicken. My friend (who insisted on taking me here for my birthday because she had never had Cheesecake Factory--it's okay, I gasped too--) had a roasted chicken thingy with mashed potatoes and carrots (which she bit into, and proceeded to sigh in contentment.) We had to order the Original Cheesecake (since it was my birthday.) I got a very out-of-tune chorus from the staff and the nice table sitting next to us. Basically, I felt super uber happy. I'd come here again and again just for the service and the food. Who cares if the wait is 1 1/2 hours? Yum!"
Derek F.,"Glendale, CA",123,20,3,4.0,4/29/2016,"Cheesecake factory is always good. One thing that gets me though is that their menu is so huge that it's kind of overwhelming. I really enjoy their lunch special that comes with a cup of soup and a half sandwich. It's definitely worth the price. Their service is amazing and I have to admit, they saved me a lot of money. I accidentally left my ticket validation there and also went over the free time (the penalty for losing your ticket is the max price for the day). I went back and found out that not only did our waitress save our ticket for me if I came back, they validated it for two hours so I didn't have to pay anything. I'd recommend this place for their delicious food and friendly service to anyone that is in the area."
Theresa D.,"Los Angeles, CA",195,74,10,5.0,1/27/2016,"HUGE PROPS TO CHEESECAKE FACTORY- AMERICANA!!!!! I went here on Monday because my mtg was cancelled, so it meant I had a whole day off!  My friend's birthday was on Tuesday, so I asked her if we can celebrate at the Americana w/ lunch, a movie, and a lil retail therapy... and we did! Our first stop was the Cheesecake Factory... I'm in a chair & my friend is too..  From the hostess (didn't get her name) to our waitress, Dina... this was customer service at it's best. We ordered the Avocado egg rolls & the Skinnylicious sausage & ricotta flat bread (gotta leave room for dessert!) Our food came promptly, and we ordered a banana cream cheesecake for my friends birthday. I know that Cheesecake Factory sings to you on your bday & most of the time it's just your server & someone else... well, Dina went the extra mile and got 4 other waiters/waitresses to sing my friend ""Happy Birthday!"" In a society where so many people don't understand individuals with disabilities or how to approach or talk to people in wheelchairs, Dina went above & beyond for us... Thank you Dina & everyone who made my friend's bday so special... thank you for looking beyond the chair and treating us with dignity and respect... just like everyone else should be treated!!!"
Jared S.,"South Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",8,10,26,1.0,6/30/2016,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Roaches, disgustingness unparalleled. The waiter even tried to squish one of the roaches, like that's going to make the meal any more appetizing. Not to mention the 40 min wait. Manager shrugged it off and acknowledged he knew of infestation. As another waiter tried to squish the many roaches practically flowing out of a bush. Never going to come here again. Disappointing for the standards of the Americana at Brand. And eating establishments that bear the name ""The Cheesecake Factory"""
Gabriela C.,"Goleta, CA",147,7,7,4.0,8/11/2015,"The food and environment were great.  I love that they have outdoor heaters so that you don't mind eating g in the patio.  I had the veggie burger and if was definitely one of the best ones out there! However,  it did fall apart.  Sadly.  The service was actually really bad, which unfortunately reflects on the entire restaurant and I wish it didn't. I had to wave my hand after after minutes that our waiter didn't come by for a refill,  and he just did not give a friendly vibe the entire time.  His coworker however,  offered to replace my burger after I accidentally forgot to tell them no cheese.  That was really nice of her. Overall it was good food,  and a good setting."
J H.,"Burbank, CA",0,7,1,3.0,5/29/2016,"Ordered to go. All the staff I encountered was either rude, or took forever to acknowledge that I was waiting there. AND my food is cold. Not even warm. When I took it back, the guy got an attitude with ME for the food being cold. Smh. My food is currently being remade."
Tomaso M.,"Los Angeles, CA",284,174,32,4.0,3/12/2015,"Yeah I know it's a Cheesecake Factory and we've all been to one or two of them, but this one is unique with the outdoor patio facing the fountain in Americana. Great people watching spot on any afternoon or evening. The service is normally great except for the one time mentioned in the last paragraph of this review. My wife and I have been here dozens of times. The lunch menu on page 8 of the menu is perfect for those of us who don't wanna carry 10 extra pounds of stomach out of there after we eat. Overall, the chicken madeira dinner is my hand down favorite. Have had repeat orders of Shepard's Pie (it's heavy on the meat) and most of their chicken/pasta dishes. Wife is vegetarian and likes the menu, there's plenty of choices and if they aren't slammed, they will make her order however she wants to adjust it, except for the one time mentioned in the last paragraph of this review. Only had one bad experience here. We were seated on a really slow early lunchtime and the server seemed like she may have had a bad audition that day or something. We weren't thrilled with the extra late greeting, we're easy going people, but the aloof attitude followed by no effort to get wifey a slightly altered sandwich to fit her needs, caused us to get up and walk out after taking a few sips of water. That dropped this rating one star. I still say check out the patio and try to save enough room for dessert."
Robert S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,8,28,3.0,4/1/2014,"Its The Cheesecake Factory, everything is generic, the staff is decent, the food is decent, at the Americana specifically the parking is structured 2 hours free. If you want a decent meal but nothing special for around twenty bucks this is the place for you.  If you are looking for a wow factor this isn't the place for you. Side note: there area few gems on the menu. See pictures."
Josh A.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,26,21,5.0,2/24/2016,Great place for lunch. There is outdoor patio. View of the fountain and nice music. Great cheesecake but don't eat too much (I'm watching my weight.)
Monica U.,"Sun Valley, Los Angeles, CA",30,28,22,4.0,6/6/2014,"I always love the set up and layout of any Cheesecake Factory.  I've never been a fan of the food, but I think it's because I've been ordering wrong this entire time!  They're salads are amazing, they're the pre mix kind. So forget about picking it if your just trying to be healthy.. It's the yummy, enough dressing, enough cheese and just flavorful.  And of course dessert! Yummy!!"
Gloria R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,9,5.0,6/15/2016,"Had lunch with my friend yesterday and enjoyed the food as well as the service. Josh R. Was amazing!! He was always checking on us, full of smiles and with a great attitude. We usually eat there once every two weeks and we had never experienced such great service. I also made sure the manager knew how fun we made our lunch time. Will try to sit in his section when we go back!!!"
Sandy H.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",30,164,83,2.0,4/2/2016,The service was so bad tonight. I've been to this location a few times before and it was never this bad. We had four adults and two kids under two in our party. Our pager buzzed and when we got to the counter they asked us to step aside and wait to be called. We waited at least ten minutes before checking again and they said we didn't make it in time when we were paged so they gave our table away to the next group. Not true. When we were finally seated the service was really really slow. No bread came out no drinks came out. When drinks finally came out they were served in plastic to go cups because they said they ran out of regular cups. Never coming back here on a Saturday night again.
Nicole Z.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",50,20,6,1.0,1/27/2016,"Worst experience ever....which is unfortunate because I love the cheesecake factory. My friend called to make reservations for my birthday and they said they don't take reservations. She said, ok, then we'll just show up but there will be 10 of us. The manager then said,  ok I'll write that in the book. So, we arrive and I try to explain that to the manager and he wouldn't give me the time of day. Wouldn't even look up from his iPad and kept rudely repeating as if I was incompetent ""we don't take reservations."" Yeah dude, I know, I was just trying to tell him about the book that the person in the phone earlier stated. (Asian guy, didn't get his name but could care less at this point). Neither would the snotty hostess (also Asian) So,  we left and at elsewhere and had a FANTASTIC  time! The cheesecake factory in pasadena is way better and don't treat you like trash."
Jonathan K.,"Montrose, CA",5,6,3,5.0,4/23/2016,"First of all, a celebration for what is looking to be an establishment of a lifetime. What a year what a year. Truly and humbly, honestly what a  fucking year. What a fucking year it's been. And let me please, in your greatest regards, allow me to explain why. One word: Majid the host. Majid let us celebrate hand in hand and reach a high we've never reached before. One base further from a grand slam. Majid you awre as my brother Big T says, Rat a tat a slam dat kat."
