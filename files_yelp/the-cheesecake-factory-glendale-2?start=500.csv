Jasmine C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,13,,5.0,11/5/2016,"My friends and I had a wonderful experience at this location. Great food, drinks and service. Our waitress was Jocelyn and she was super sweet! We will definitely come back soon!"
Joebella B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,32,5,1.0,2/10/2016,Food was the same as other factories however the service sucks.. The waiter didn't attend to us like she did to the table next to us and sadly it was due to our skin. Seemed upset that tip was not given but a tip is earned. Worst experience ever!
Shab T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,6,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Having bad luck with cheese cake factory.  Ordered a Chinese chicken salad, 2 ingredients were missing. Server took for ever to come back...  However we were in a rush to catch movie I paid for the bill, expensive lettuce !!  When the main ingredient is chicken but no chicken in mine.  I did write on ticket, even tipped our server.  Will not go back"
Kristina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,114,9,1.0,12/6/2016,"Worst experience ever! Decided I'd give this place the benefit of the doubt and try it again and nope! Bad experience yet again! Came here about 3 weeks ago with my sister, we live in the area and I was craving pasta so we said why not. After coming here I was reminded why I NEVER come here..... It was a Thursday night, we went in and there were about 3 or 4 parties ahead of us waiting to be seated but they were big parties. We walked up to the host at the counter. He completely IGNORED us. It was an African tall guy, not sure what his name was. We were literally right in his face and he was ignoring us, no hi, no how can I help you. Hell, even just saying ""I'll be with you in a moment"" would suffice. NOPE. Ignored us for about 2 minutes until my sister got upset and said ""Hello? Can you help us????"" and he was like ""What do you need?"" WTF? You saw us walk in, what do you possibly think we need? We want to be seated! My sister asked how long the wait was and he asked us how many, she said two. He said ""No wait, I'll seat you guys in a minute"". 5 minutes had gone by and my sister was raging pissed and she walked over and said ""Are you going to seat us now?"" and he was like ""There's 2 parties ahead of you it's going to be about 20 minutes"". Why did you lie and say it would be a minute when you just came back with saying a 20 minute wait. What an idiot. We walked out pissed off and ate somewhere else. Worst service ever. OK, there was no one at the counter when we approached him, he couldn't acknowledge our existence? Worst attitude ever too ""What do you need"". Whatever. If you hate your job no one is forcing you to work there - just quit. A week ago I ordered through Uber Eats because I was craving pasta and my sister wanted a burger. Order came in an hour. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta because supposedly it's like the ""Best thing on the menu"" NOPE. Disgusting. Probably the worst pasta I have ever tasted in my entire life. Bland, and something I could have made for $5 bucks getting all the ingredients at a store. The noodles were nasty and the chicken had so much cartilage I wasted every piece of chicken. It's still lingering on my palette honestly. $18.50 for this pasta has got to be the most insulting joke ever. $18.50 for something that tastes like a wet diaper. No thanks. NEVER AGAIN. I will not support or give my money to any Cheesecake Factory establishment moving forward. Worst experience twice, and disgusting food.  Wish I could give zero stars. Everyone who works here should be embarrassed because they are supporting crappy food and have the worst attitude makes the reputation twice as bad."
Meriam B.,"Glendale, CA",64,6,1,5.0,1/26/2016,This is my place to go to whenever I want to have a good yummy meal. I have tried several meals and they are all good. The customer service was really good today (Bahan) was really nice and made me laugh on a boring Tuesday so thank you for that .
Libby A.,"Monrovia, CA",43,54,10,1.0,1/25/2015,"I will never ever come to this location again. I came here on Saturday at noon, and I requested if me and my fiancé could sit outside on a bigger table instead of this tiny table by the wall.   They said no that was for a party of 4 coming up. Ok...so i get my food, and i had to wait longer because some other waitress took my food, and then they sat 2 girls where I requested to sit. Totally NOT COOL. I am insulted and shame on u Cheesecake Factory to lie to me like that and have the nerve to not care and sit 2 people there right in front of me!!They got food and ate with only 2 people still while we got our check.You guys need new people in the front to sit everyone properly and be more courteous. This is not ok! Oh and by the way ... my chicken club was cold n soo bland ..it was the worst sandwich ever had at a Cheescake Factory."
Jade C.,"Los Angeles, CA",308,171,192,4.0,1/14/2015,"Great service, great food, good portions, delicious wheat bread, and beautiful venue.  Came here for a Monday lunch birthday celebration and we were immediately seated. The venue is spacious and beautiful. Our server Natalie was very busy (we had to hunt her down a few times) but totally amazing. Excellent Service. We tried her recommendations which included:  1. Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken with extra sauce on the side $17.95 during lunch 2. Steak Diane  $19.95 during lunch Both dishes came with mashed potatoes and were absolutely ON POINT. DELICIOUS.  The dessert (Kahula Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake) on the other hand tasted like diabetes. I was so excited to try it but after the first bite, I couldn't bring myself to eat another bite. Even for my friend who is a sweet tooth still thought it was way too sweet. I'd skip this and try another in the future. I'll be back! 3 small cons:  1. The birthday freebie is a joke. It's a tiny cup of ice cream. Cute but TINY.  2. The regular (not wheat) bread was hard like a brick. We could not even bite into it, let alone break it into pieces. The wheat bread on the other hand was DIVINE. I'd come here just for that wheat bread! 3. The Coffee Cheesecake is WAY too sweet."
Anthony N.,"Washington, DC",101,134,256,4.0,5/6/2015,Went there today for desserts. This place is usually very busy but on a Wednesday it's pretty chill. We got seated right away and our waiter was very nice and friendly. I had the usual: Reese's pieces chocolate cheesecake! Loved it! it's truly a piece of art. Reese's crumbles on the side and a chocolate cheesecake filled with peanut butter. Delicious. You can't ask for anything better than that!! I also had the Oreo milkshake. the shake was good I enjoyed it.
Kecia M.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",9,12,22,4.0,7/2/2015,Service was excellent .. Just hated the long wait.. Then we got the text are food was ready and waited another 10 mins .. Food was also excellent.. Order the teriyaki chicken and a Georgia peach drink
Tara F.,"Glendale, CA",490,135,132,5.0,3/15/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory !  I have been coming here for years now and every time I've come here the food and customer service has been great! They do not take reservations which sucks but their bar seating is almost always open. Their portions are so big, and every bite is so tasty!"
Stacy P.,"Burbank, CA",2,60,6,1.0,11/25/2015,"Slow service, oily food and when we asked the server why the food took this long he responded ""beats me!""..... Are you kidding me!!!!"
Arnold J.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,184,527,2.0,12/20/2015,I ordered a $30 dollar rib eye steak and I honestly had better cheaper Steaks at Denny's or norms. I had the dynamite shrimp that's always a great appetizer!! The only downside this night was my steak and the server that almost spilled all the steak juice on me. Close call.. That's why I give my 2 stars...
Norma M.,"Glendale, CA",8,13,,1.0,12/30/2015,"Where do I begin.... As usual, the wait was about 35 minutes long, no big deal. The service was ok except for the fact that one of the servers dropped an entire appetizer all over the table. Not only did the Tater Tots go flying into my friends lap, but the plate that it was in shattered as it hit the table. Accidents happen, this I understand, but they wouldn't have taken the food back had we not asked them to. The manager came by the table and had someone kind of wipe the table. There were still pieces of glass around the table, and our food was not ready at the same time. When my friend finally received her food, mine was cold and I was annoyed.  The manager didn't attempt to rectify the situation, they didn't move us to another table, he charged us for everything(no discounts), not even a free slice of cheesecake. I believe that anyone in the customer service industry knows to at least attempt and fix the problem with free dessert. We were completely disappointed, don't think we'll be coming back."
Christian M.,"Bakersfield, CA",433,4,1,5.0,8/14/2015,"I've always had an infatuation with Cheesecake, so when my work sent me to Glendale on business, I just HAD to bring my coworkers for dinner, and of course, a slice of delicious cheesecake.  I've been to a few of the other locations, but by far, the Americana location is my favorite. We were seated outside in the patio area that overlooked the fountain, and our server, Simon, was absolutely attentive to our every need. Our food was served promptly and our drinks were topped off almost immediately.  I would recommend this location to anyone visiting the Glendale area."
Aileen E.,"Monrovia, CA",245,373,569,3.0,12/7/2013,Pretty much the same as any other Cheesecake Factory I have gone to.  If it's nice outside request a table on the patio and if your timing is right you'll get to watch the hourly fountain show put to music.   Instead of pagers they ask for your cell phone number then send you a text once your table is ready.
Matt D.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",1,23,4,1.0,10/26/2016,"Probably the worst cheesecake factory experience I've ever had.... I used to love this place I don't know what the heck happened to it. I decided to bring my cousins who are visiting here on vacation from a different country today for lunch and had the WORST service/food experience...... Our server, a mid age blonde lady, was so slow, lost and seemed like she had no idea what she was doing! This particular experience was beyond anything I've ever had. We literally waited 20min for every single step in the whole ""steps of service process"".... The Greet,  took about 10min, drinks 20min to get...... bread 20min to get after that, cocktails 20min AFTER that... already been here over an hour and STILL no food. Once our food came out, everything came out separate and we literally had to ask other servers for everything we needed, i.e. Ranch, napkins, refills......NOT ONCE DID OUR SERVER ASK IF WE'D LIKE A REFILL ON OUR DRINKS! Beyond frustrated, I decided to ask another server if we could get our check because I wanted to leave and spare anymore embarrassment in front of my cousins... Another thing, not once did I see management presence and if there was a manager present they would have noticed how agitated we were with the horrific service we received and stopped by the table....never going back again....."
Nicole F.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",110,8,1,2.0,9/25/2016,"It took a very long time for the waiter to stop by our table. We asked for the wheat bread and he brought the other one. We ordered and 2 minutes later they changed the waiter (which was actually a good thing) and when our food came, we asked for THREE different waiters to bring an extra plate and parmesan cheese and it took them around 10 minutes to bring. The food tasted like old pasta that was heated in the microwave and there were around 6 waiters just hanging out in the patio area while many tables were pissed off waiting for someone to take their order. Our second waiter was nice but he was super overwhelmed, they are certainly needing more waiters and improve their food....And...the outside table had flies coming to our food."
Laura B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,55,11,5.0,11/21/2015,delicious food! I ordered fettuccine pasta with shrimp add ons. Meggan was our waitress and she delivered our food very quickly! 5 stars for Meggan!!
Nora G.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",0,52,,4.0,10/8/2016,Good food and great selection but a bit pricey and the portions are way too huge. I rarely see waiters taking away clean plates. Food waste is massive here.
Glenn R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",834,56,32,4.0,4/2/2015,"Had a birthday lunch for my friend here yesterday. I forgot the lady who served us but she was Amazing! Very attentive and nice.  Strawberry lemonade wasn't that good in my opinion, way too tart. Calamari to start is the way to go. Both sauces that come with it are a must, mix'em up for best results.  I got the Hibachi Steak dish, which was delicious as always!!!! Bread is on point. The Red Velvet Cheesecake is to die for. I haven't tried any other cakes here but I really don't feel the need because I have already found my match. Service and Food is good for this price point."
