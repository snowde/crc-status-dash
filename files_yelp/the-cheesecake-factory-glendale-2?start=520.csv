Andrew B.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",60,9,,5.0,1/17/2016,"Too many options can give you a headache! Luckily though the food will be the medicine. Everything tastes like what crack must feel like because I am literally addicted!! After losing 85 pounds 2 summers ago I stopped going to CCF as I would call it in my texts. Gotta love the Orange Chicken, Oreo Cheesecake, Sweet Potato Fries, Calamari, Rocky Road Cheesecake, MexiCali Tacos and the Mimosas. I have my health in check and I used to think Cheesecake Factory being so good was the reason for my obesity but it was really my lack of selfwill and selfcontrol. I have gone through a very intense spiritual journey with my weight loss and the loss of my child but now I realize it is the finer things in life that make food and life fun. 5 Stars."
Wan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",642,587,6635,4.0,4/25/2012,"Located at the Americana at Brand in Glendale, this is one of the nicer Cheesecake Factory that I've been to.  This place is always packed.  It doesn't matter what time of the day you go, there's always a wait.  Food is always yummy and service is good. My fav dish here is Evelyn's Favorite Pasta.  It's penne pasta tossed with eggplants, broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, bell peppers and pine nuts...Mmmmmmm healthy!  If you're not a fan of creamy and saucy pasta dishes (like I am), you will love this dish!  It's light, full of veggies and oh so yummilicious!   Their Miso Salmon dish is quite tasty as well.  It's a grilled salmon filet drizzled with teriyaki sauce atop a bed of white or brown rice with five snap peas in a pool of creamy miso and teriyaki sauce.  The sauces were a lil too sweet for my liking but complemented well with the salmon and rice.  The salmon was very tender and didn't have that fishy smell or taste, thumbs up!  I was impressed with the presentation of the dish, very nice! :) For cheesecakes, I love the Vanilla Bean and the Ultimate Red Velvet.  Both are so Yummy and so bad for you :)  Their slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake is massive! Don't be a pig and plan on sharing this collossal piece of yumminess.  Trust me, your body will thank me.  Cheesecake Factory:  great food, good service, reasonably priced and big portions!"

Nicole M.,"Glendale, CA",386,194,1266,3.0,11/30/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! It's good to go on a day when it's not packed though because if you go during the holidays and shopping season you'll have to wait 45+ minutes to be seated.  The service is usually good except for this one time when I went with my family for my fathers birthday the waiter was a complete JERK! He was inattentive and rude. My dad had asked for chicken Parmesan and the waiter was being condescending and was pretending to not understand what my dad had said. So I yelled ""chicken"" and he pretended that he couldn't hear. That was the only time I've experienced bad service at this branch. That experience tainted my image of the restaurant. Usually the staff is friendly and they provide us with great service! That same day they forgot my sisters pasta order. So everyone had got there food and she had not. Our goat cheese salad also came out with NO goat cheese. It was just a bad experience. On the other hand I am fond of most of their food. Like the chicken enchiladas, the jumbalya pasta, their green mint tea, burgers and their original cheesecake is good. Not sure if I want to come here as often because of that bad experience though."
Laurie N.,"Simi Valley, CA",291,224,95,5.0,4/4/2015,"Service was great, food was wonderful but the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake was heavenly!! I will never forget how amazing this Cheescake was!!"
Kaneki D.,"Carson, CA",21,7,38,3.0,5/15/2015,"Staff was very nice, unfortunately my steak was over cooked. I asked for medium and received well done. Ci didn't want to send it back because I thought it wasn't worth the time to wait"
Maria S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,15,10,5.0,4/20/2015,"My first time going there and I have nothing negative to say about it. The food was AMAZING, I love the bread you get at the beginning and my service was really good. I got the Chicken Madeira plate minus the cheese, I will definitely be going back !"
Ano M.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",29,84,71,3.0,12/29/2014,"Their wait time is ridiculously long. We came in at 6:55 and were told the wait was an hour & 10 minutes long. They took my phone number & said they'll send a text as soon as our table is ready. An hour and 30 minutes later still NO text. We go to the front desk to complain and finally we get seated. Our waiter was running back and forth like crazy. We had to get her attention a couple times before she came to our table to check on us. However over all her service wasn't bad. Food came our pretty Quick & it was delicious as always so the kitchen deserves an A+. I got the chipotle spicy chicken pasta, my usual and it was amazing. However they're not that sanitary. My fork had a piece of dried lettuce stuck to it. So our waitress brought me a new one. I hope the manager looks into how their utensils are being washed because this was just gross!"
Anna F.,"Pasadena, CA",12,17,,4.0,1/19/2016,One of my favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurants. I always get good service here although there is usually a bit of a wait. Plus it's at the Americana and it has a good atmosphere. My favorite dish is the Louisiana chicken pasta. Never disappoints! Good place for date night as well.
Mary M.,"Pasadena, CA",275,129,99,4.0,2/25/2015,"Now I have to start my review by telling you I've never been a huge Cheesecake Factory fan, HOWEVER, today was especially delicious.  My brother and I went during lunch on a weekday and sat down right away. We browsed through the menu for about 15 minutes before we made a decision. For those of you that are familiar with Cheesecake Factory, you know just how long it takes to pick one item, as there are 100,000,000 different dishes.  I chose the southern fried chicken sliders and my brother chose the chicken picante. My sliders was so yummy! It was the perfect lunch portion and I topped it off with a delicious strawberry lemonade. My brother was very pleased with his dish and gave it a 8 out of 10. Then the dessert menu arrived... which is always a problem, as we are always too hungry for dessert, but order it anyways. We ordered the white chocolate blondie cheesecake and raspberry cheesecake. Both to die for! Overall, we had a positive experience at Cheesecake Factory and will be back!"
Tiffany C.,"Rosemead, CA",14,121,411,5.0,3/26/2015,"Service was amazing here ! Everyone was so nice and this cheesecake factory is way more classier than the one in Arcadia. When the waiter brought the food to us he claimed it was one of his favorite's here and he had quite a sense of humor. Later on during the meal he introduced to us a different waiter and omg we was mad hot xD he had blonde hair and blue eyes. not to sound creepy but he was real cute. Okay so anyways, the food was really good but if you ever decide to get the sandwich I got eat it first ! The bread gets hard quickly."
Helmq C.,"Burbank, CA",22,10,4,4.0,4/11/2016,Love the menu but the place has a long wait the servers are good and very helpful with their recommended selections love their  big serving of Caesar salad and great desserts
Ebony G.,"Brooklyn, NY",152,30,11,3.0,2/17/2016,"The last time I went to The Cheesecake Factory was a few years ago and ppl absolutely love this place Mugabe it's because I didn't get the dessert (cheesecake). Well for my entree I had the Chicken Madeira which the waiter raved about and it was actually good except my mashed potatoes were drier and the Madeira sauce should of been poured over it to give it more flavor. As for my BF he has the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with chicken. He was very disappointed because his nationality is Jamaican and, it was nothing like a Jamaican dish because it was missing the flavor and spices. Instead it said it was on the sweeter side I guess with the mango salsa. He said the rice was hard and the actual best thing on the plate was the Plantains. For drinks we had a Caribbean cooler which was pretty good I just wish it was served in a bigger glass because by time my food came I was done. Overall nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and prices were reasonable in addition to portion sizes. My BF doesn't want to come back but I would love to try a few more menu items."
Alexandrea B.,"Ontario, CA",0,6,2,2.0,4/10/2016,"I've been to a few different locations of Cheesecake Factory and there's never been a problem or difference until I came to this one. It took forever for the waitress to get our drinks, our bread, our entrees, and the bill. And not only that but our drinks, we had ordered hot cocoa & a cafe mocha (hot drinks obviously), they came to us almost room temperature. And even our entrees weren't even fresh since they were cold too. I'm really disappointed with this one. I wouldn't come again."
John M.,"Beaver Dam, WI",86,9,,1.0,1/5/2016,"Definitely not worth the hype, only thing we enjoyed was the cheesecake and our friendly waitress.  Host and seater were slow and rude!  Horrible inefficiency.  Burgers were average at best!  Save your money dont bother"
Janelle M.,"Burbank, CA",5,22,13,4.0,4/10/2014,Great happy deals! A lot of options for just $5!  Eventhough it's not on the HH menu I always get the Ahi tuna tartare ($6.95) and the tomato and basil flatbread pizza ($6.50)..  Always save room for their bread!
Bella S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,81,30,1.0,9/16/2015,"Went here on Sunday for lunch...I get it, they're busy. Long story short...I asked for bread 3 times...never got it....and was never offered a refill on a drink, not even once! As a matter of fact, after we received our food (not from our waiter, someone else brought out the food) I didn't see the waiter again. Except when he brought the bill....like I said...I asked for bread 3 times...that's the service at this location."
Mars 5.,"Los Angeles, CA",387,16,19,5.0,3/20/2016,"As busy as it was last night, the service was excellent. We did arrive late and had food at the bar, which was alright. Had the chicken sandwich with veggies. The Old Fashion w/ Makers Mark was done perfectly. We had a great visit here. Coming back soon. #Marsphotoz"
Sharon H.,"Irvine, CA",124,122,101,1.0,9/21/2014,"First off.... No wait when we came which is a plus. Sat down and silverware was disgusting. Fork had leftover spinach, spoon had nasty spots with leftover food... And knives were broken with spots on it as well.  Our waiter is terrible. Takes 30 mins just to get our drinks...."
Amy B.,"Canyon Country, CA",633,113,460,5.0,9/22/2014,"I am never disappointed when I leave here. At this location I normally like to eat outside on the patio. If seated outside you have a full view of the large fountain which is always running, and the opportunity to ""people watch.""  However today we choose to be seated inside (actually we told the host which ever seats were available first). I think being seated inside today was a great choice due to the heat. We came around lunch time on a Saturday, and although it was crowded we only waited 10-15mins.  I was delighted to discover their ""skinnylicious"" menu. They have organized the menu into four or five different sections based on calories in each of the following dishes. Ordering from this menu allows you to enjoy your meal guilt free. This was my first time ordering off this menu, I am not sure if it is a new addition for them, but I was left completely satisfied.  The best way to order, at any restaurant, is to order two plates to share. By doing so you have the opportunity to expand your culinary palate. We ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables and it was delicious. The carrots, offered on my plate, where huge and cooked to perfection; so moist and soft. The asparagus was also cooked perfectly and my favorite part was the absence of fatty oil.  We also ordered steak medallions (also on the skinny menu) and substituted the mash potatoes for more veggies. Delicious. Another friend ordered a salad from the same menu, it was huge! She could not finish it all... it looked very fresh and she said it was good. Today we opted for no cheesecake and I did not feel like I was missing out.  I will always love this restaurant and look forward to returning. In addition to the amazing food, the service is always great."
