Saydie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,28,7,5.0,10/23/2016,"I went there with my husband and kids randomly. We were planning on going to the one in grove but with traffic it said one hour so we decided on here instead, it was closer. When we walked it we were told 45 mins wait which is always expected. Once we were seated we had such a nice server and we told him about the kids and how they were famished so he got some bread and bananas for them right away, thank god that really helped! Our food came out rather quickly, as always the avocado egg rolls were on point, fish tacos were great, fish was fresh and the jambalaya pasta was OK, it could have used a bit more flavor. Overall good experience!"
Ellen R.,"Lancaster, CA",9,9,,5.0,12/20/2015,We went to dinner the weekend before Christmas. You could tell the staff was extremely busy yet they were still able to execute excellent service. the food /drinks were really good. And the peppermint bark cheesecake was fantastic !
Victoria H.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,15,1,2.0,12/15/2015,The food is good but I was extremely annoyed when they removed my favorite pasta dish from the menu. The service varies from each location. The waitress had a lot of attitude after I took a little longer to figure out what I wanted since I was so dead set on my usual meal. Will definitely never come back to this location.
J.P. B.,"Torrance, CA",276,225,566,4.0,10/6/2013,"I've been to this place plenty of times and most of the time, it is really busy.  They don't take reservations, so if you are planning on dining here on a Friday or Saturday, definitely come early.  With recent additions of new business in the Americana or across the street from the newly remodeled Glendale Galleria, the Americana at Brand is sure to see a lot of people.  They seem to have done away with the paging system, and are now using your phone as a point of contact (via text messaging).   The food here is usually pretty good, and I usually gravitate towards the specialties.  The salad could be a hit or miss... but I don't come here for the salad anyway.  Since their portions are all pretty sizable, with the complimentary bread, I usually skip the appetizers.  If you had to choose an appetizer, I am quite a fan of the lettuce wrap.  The cheesecake are all pretty amazing, that is if you still have room.  Anyway, all this stuff about the food is not news if you are a frequent CF customer, and they stay pretty consistent with any location. Seating, I usually pick indoor, or first-available if I'm hungry and desperate.  After eating there a few times, I realize I don't like dining outdoors.  The buildings surrounding the Americana can kind of make a mini wind tunnel.  It can get a bit cold during the fall-winter-spring months.  You might also experience napkins flying off your table.  Secondly, there's a lot of people walking around and if dining privacy/intimacy is something you might be looking for, then I'd recommend indoor seating instead.  If you don't want to wait, you could always try the bar area and find the first available seat. Service, I haven't really had any issues with the service of the several times I've been here.  I think I can only recall 1 instance in which we felt neglected... that was when we were dining outside and there was a big planter that blocked our visibility of the staff and vice-versa.  It is either we were just fortunate to have received good service, or we're just easy going dinner patrons, but I haven't experienced terrible service as I've seen in the other reviews. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this CF location and have picked this place as a dining default while at the Americana."
Nari C.,"Los Angeles, CA",678,221,1597,5.0,7/6/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a good default when you want to show your foreign guests to a good American meal. Watch out because the portions are enormous. We shared two pasta entrees among four people, and it was the perfect amount.  Atmosphere, decor, and lighting is perfect. It's a bit loud and bustling, but I love it. The waiters are always friendly and accommodating, which is a plus. WHAT TO GET: 1. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - It has a little kick to it, but it's bearable, I promise! The sauce reminds me a little bit of Indian curry. Soooo good. My favorite entree. 2. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The shrimp and chicken are bursting with flavor. If you're a fan of pepper, you'll love this. It has a rich peppery taste and the sauce is also amazing. My sister's favorite."
Linda A.,"Glendale, CA",1,7,4,1.0,4/1/2016,Our waiters were the worst possible. My friend and I came and sat a two top table. Our friends said they were gonna join us so we asked to move to the table next to us because it sat four and they said yeah sure and we had to move our plates and food ourselves. Our waiter then brought us a burger with HAIR IN IT. And her response was that was the littlest hair !!! Dirty ass place. Don't eat here.
Julia C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,11,3,5.0,3/11/2016,"My favorite place to eat. Have had different dishes and have yet to be disappointed. Even the hamburgers are delish. Farfalle chicken with roasted garlic pasta is my favorite, the cheesecake with strawberries, and the tropical iced tea. My husband gets the pasta carbonara and the raspberry lemonade. You will not be disappointed."
Anton N.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",22,128,92,5.0,2/7/2015,"My girlfriend and I came at around 10:45 before us there was 10-15 people the lady upfront told us its going to be a 10-15 mins wait. After about 3 mins we were seated. Our waiter was great, nice, and brought everything out very fast. By far the best cheesecake factory."
Tina T.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,35,5,2.0,10/27/2014,"Happy Birthday to me. What should've been a good time was marred by the service my friend and I received. We sat down and waited for 15 mins before our waiter finally acknowledged us. I had realized after he left that he was the same guy walking past us three times and he never once stopped.  He set down the napkins and walked away. Came back and half heartedly told us the soup special. Then asked if we were ready to order. Really? We can't even get drinks first? Of course, with the way the night was going, it's not surprising our food was taking its time.  I should've asked for the manager but I didn't because it's my birthday and I didn't want to ruin it further by being negative.  The two stars is me being generous. Just like the tip. I've been to this restaurant before on a busy night and still had great service. Tonight however, probably won't be coming back for a long while.  Our waiter, Moses? I believe that was his name, needs more training. Just a heads up."
Una N.,"Carson, CA",0,7,2,1.0,9/6/2016,"we ordered from Cheesecake Factory. the lady cashier and the gay|guy near the cashier were both rude to us. i guess preferencial treatment and racial discrimination because maybe we don't look like middle eastern or white. but she gave them tip still.  we didn't deserve the kind of treatment they both showed us earlier. the food served to us, the shrimp scampy in angel hair - the noodle was not even cooked right, the dressing for the salad doesn't even compliment it. the QUE-SA DEA is the only thing that tasted right and the complimentary dark brown crusty in the outside but soft in the inside french bread. we waited for more than 30minutes for the order while the ones who came in later were already served theirs.  the gay|guy shouted to us when i jokingly said QUE-SA-DILLA, he yelled and sneered at us like he was talking to somebody stupid with raised eyebrows. i was so pissed, i turned away from him like he didn't exist. the lady cashier  was not even facing us when she was taking our orders, she was either doing something in the cash register or something below it so she couldn't hear us. she was just so rude and she was making faces while she reacted to us while we tried to figure out our order.  if they are saying that Americana is a high end place then they should get waiters and waitresses with high class sophistication and refinement that of a learned and educated individuals."
Spunky M.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,201,,3.0,12/19/2014,"I used to love The Cheesecake Factory way back when.  My favorite is the Marina Del Rey location with the patio facing the ocean.  But now I no longer go as much because it's just too much food, too heavy and too overpriced.  I usually just go once every year.  And then I usually regret it.  I no longer have a stomach made of iron. Last night I was at an event at the Americana during rush hour, so I was basically stuck there.  There was a lot of free booze at this event--a VIP store opening--so I thought it would be best to suck up some food at The Cheesecake Factory.  My assessment:  1)  you always fill up on bread 2)  the portions are a good explanation of why America is filled with fat people  3)  the ambience and service is what you really go for.   Will I go back?  I always seem to go back...but not for a long time..."
Judith M.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,17,5,1.0,10/22/2015,"My parents came into town for a week and we were in the area so we thought this Cheesecake Factory would be a good choice since it was so conveniently where we were but boy were we wrong!  The hostesses are horrendous and very mean! It was a very hot Sunday and we only waited 25 minutes inside which wasn't bad at all. The bad part was after out timer lite up we got up from our seats and thought we would be seated right away, but instead they made us stand off to the side and wait for our table to be ready. 10 minutes of standing time had passed and my dad (who has a bad knee) was wincing. Since they made us get up (for no reason) after our timer lite up we had no where to sit for the remaining wait time. There was also a woman who had to be 7 months pregnant and her husband waiting for their table to be prepared after getting up when their timer went off as well.  I got a little frustrated and went up to the hostesses and asked when we were going to be seated stating that my dad had a bad knee and the 7 month pregnant woman shouldn't be standing unless the table was actually ready to have us seated. She turned to me, looked me up and down, sighed and said ""Well the tables aren't ready and I don't know how long it's going to be. They can wait a little longer."" She didn't even care at about the physical state of my dad and the poor pregnant woman! So appalling. I used to work in the service industry and that is not how you handle the situation at all. I then told her I just didn't understand why they buzzed us when they weren't even ready to seat us. She ignored me and just typed on the register. Then because I was annoying her they ended up seating me and my parents while they were still cleaning the table. The poor pregnant woman waited another 10 minutes to be seated and they were there before us!  Our waitress saved the day and made our meal more enjoyable but I still had a bad taste in my mouth that couldn't be fixed. I will never go to another Cheesecake Factory again and I will be advising my friends to eat at better managed places as well. The fact that the hostess thought she was better than everyone is just ridiculous. Maybe it's the LA complex but it made me never want to go back."
Anne M.,"Pasadena, CA",15,194,404,4.0,2/17/2014,"Had to meet up with friends at Cheesecake.  Good thing I had a snack before coming here because the wait is long.  It took us almost an hour to be seated. We were group of 7 and 1 child.  We requested a pizza t be served first for the child and they did.  Awesome waiter and awesome service who gave us 2 desserts for the 2 who's celebrating their birthday. Cons: bathroom is filthy and ran out of toilet paper and seat cover - which we informed the waiter. The place is big,lights are dim for a cozy feel and decor is awesome.  I enjoyed the food - had salmon n steak dianne plus calamari.  Happy tunny for happy people."
Rx4reason _.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,57,5,1.0,3/5/2016,"If it was possible, I'd give this location a negative 100,000... I have ordered meals from this location several times within the past few weeks. Each time, my order has been wrong; it has always been missing something--cheesecake, beans, rice, bread, butter, etc. Grant it, when I order through a third party delivery service, that party should check my order before delivering it to me. However, it is The Cheesecake Factory's fault for plating and bagging it wrong in the first place. PLEASE train your crew better. Make them take their time and do their job to satisfy the customer and his/her palate."
Armine S.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",5,6,11,2.0,8/28/2014,"I go to cheesecake once in a while, and usually the one in Pasadena. But this time we were shopping at the Americana and my bf was hungry so we just decided to eat there. I gave 1 star for the wait time, which was only 2 minutes, which was great and 1 star for our waiter, read and find out why. I was not too hungry so we ordered a shrimp Alfredo to share, and while waiting I realized that my small round plate was dirty. I didn't make a big deal about it, I just didn't use it. Then we noticed our forks were dirty, so my bf asks for another set. He brings 3 forks, and I'm assuming he didn't even take the time to check to see if they were dirty or not, because they were DISGUSTING. This all happened within the first 5 to 10 mins we were seated and that's how long it took for them to bring our food, which made me suspicious, is it fresh? Or not?  Usually the presentation of the food is nice but no not this time, because it seemed liked they didn't care that the sauce was all over the plate. Anyways, my bf asks for plastic utensils and our waiter forgets about that but he did bring 2 plates so we can share, and of course those were dirty as well. So our food is getting cold and my bf decides to go to the front and get the utensils. When we finally started eating,  the Alfredo sauce was very sweet and did not taste the same. I literally had 3 bites of it and I just couldn't force myself to eat more. This is why I probably will not return to this location, unless I'm with a group and I just sit and don't order anything.  I've attached 2 pictures of the plate and forks, zoom in and look at the dirt on the forks."
Gabe F.,"Glendale, CA",519,15,4,5.0,7/6/2015,"Drinks here are great!! Strawberry martini is really strong, Mai Thais are great, my favorite is the Georgia peach (great slushy drink for summer or Sunday brunch!)  Line is always so an long though so a little trick is: don't even both putting your name down. Head over to the bar and wait for a seat.  Always get the bang bang coconut and shrimp. Sometimes it's good other times it seems like they missed the mark but still edible.  Service is ok depending on who you get."
Harout H.,"Carlsbad, CA",13,63,108,2.0,3/3/2016,Food was good but took for ever (35 min) service sucked very bad. Had to ask three different servers for a napkin.
Ryan S.,"Pasadena, CA",146,423,7,3.0,12/13/2013,"So, I have been to Cheesecake Factory many times; however, this is the first time at the Glendale location.   I am giving them an average 3 star rating.  I am not letting certain things influence my rating.  I am letting the beautiful Americana center influence my rating.  I am not letting the fact that Cheesecake Factory is one of the most unhealthy chain restaurants influence my rating...besides, I was the one that decided to go! It was a Friday evening at about 6pm.  I put my name in, and they quoted me about 40 minutes.  I received a text message after about 30 minutes, so good job on the time quote.   Things first started to get a little ""not so great"" after the host brought us to a table that was not yet cleaned and cleared.  There were dirty dishes all over. Despite the fact that there were many ""ready"" tables around us, he made us stand there for about 2 minutes while he cleaned it off.   The server than came over; however, came over so quickly, that we weren't even fully seated, ready to take our beverage order.  I enjoy prompt service, but possibly a little too prompt.  Our server also seemed embarrassed, shy, and awkward during the evening. The good news is that I had the Mac and Cheese Burger, which was pretty darn amazing.  Of course, always big portions, which means that I did not have room for Cheesecake.  :-( So, if it was based on location, food and decor, I would give it a 5.  However, a few somewhat significant slip ups made me give it a 3.  A few better improvements, could up this score significantly."
Julia N.,"San Francisco, CA",17,33,,4.0,7/1/2015,"It has solid service and pretty pleasant waiters. The meatloaf is really good because they sear the sides out so when you take your fork into it, you first get a crisp bite, followed by that smooth texture you associate with meatloaf.  Definitely a star is their bread that you get prior to all of your food. I just ask for the dark brown bread exclusively as it's that good."
Melania A.,"Glendale, CA",5,57,7,2.0,1/25/2016,"My usual experience here is ok. Service is usually decent, and food pretty good for the most part. Thus time I was a bit grossed out though. Two of the dishes we got had hair in it. We were very nice about letting them know about it but all we were offered was a replacement plate. At this point two plates with hair in it didn't really earn our trust that other plates wouldn't have hair in it too. So declined the free food. We had 3 birthdays on our party and really didn't want to spoil the mood so we just left it at that. I think if we had made it a bigger deal we would have not had to pay for those plates. But why do you have to be a jerk or corner a restaurant to do the right thing? I think they showed their true character by offering nothing else to make up for the hair in the food. Considering this place isn't the cheapest I'd probably opt for a better place to dine next time."
