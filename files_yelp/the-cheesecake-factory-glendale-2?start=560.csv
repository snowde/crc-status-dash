Arine B.,"Glendale, CA",18,17,3,1.0,12/17/2014,This place seriously has the worst workers. So far I've called five times to place a pick up order I've waited over seven minutes. I complained the girl said she'll go tell them to pick up right now. Currently been on hold for 6 mins and 48  seconds. Worst service ever!  Stuffed mushrooms is good tho
Sara M.,"Peyton, CO",62,19,1,4.0,2/4/2015,"Crazy selection of food.  I can't decide.  I usually end up going with the renees special.  It's a half sandwich soup and salad for under $10.  I LOVE their bread and butter.  It's the best!  Also great Martinis.  The service is generally good even though they are always packed.  I like that they give the ""baby plate"" for the kids to keep them happy and occupied while we are waiting for the food to come.  Only down side is wait time... 9 times out of 10 you'll end up waiting 15-20 min."
Blanca C.,"Azusa, CA",0,3,,3.0,10/4/2016,Food was really good but the service was strange. All the waiters were really stiff.
Kenneth H.,"Torrance, CA",1,10,6,3.0,2/27/2016,The Cheesecake Factory was okay but the workers are so slow and when we ordered something they would always give us that awkward smile.  And the pizza I ordered the cheese was keep falling down.  But I guess it still taste good.
Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,799,7321,3.0,11/27/2011,"(Dined 11/27/11 SU): Yes, their namesake is truly the main reason for dining at this restaurant...although their burgers are pretty good too! It was a glorious day with temperatures in the low 80's, had a gift card that needed to be used, and a good reason to catch up with a friend and grab a bite. Amazingly, The Cheesecake Factory at the Americana in Glendale wasn't as busy as expected this noontime, which bode well for us, as we were able to get a table outside and do some people watching while we enjoyed out meal. There are plenty of tables and booths inside and a decent bar with several TVs to catch a game. We each started with refillable lemonade (raspberry and regular [approx. $4.50 ea.]) and water. Then, we moved onto the avocado egg rolls ($9.95), she the smokehouse BBQ burger w/fries ($11.50), and me the wild mushroom burger w/substitute sweet potato fries ($12.50). Complimentary bread is also served. Disappointingly, we didn't leave enough room for dessert and their scrumptious cheesecake, which is truly a sin. I usually like their lemonade, but this time it was a tad too sweet. I still contend that the best lemonade can be found at Red Robin. The avocado egg rolls (6 halves) are one of my favorite appetizers here and have never done me wrong. In addition, their burgers are also my favorite and one of the main reasons (along with the cheesecakes) why I dine here. The burgers are a good size and the side order of fries are plentiful. Needless to say, the portions are decent, thus, we just couldn't order dessert.  The service was shockingly good. I say this because historically I've had pretty shoddy service at each location I've dined at (e.g. Glendale, Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Sherman Oaks, The Grove, Woodland Hills). The hostess greeted us and immediate sat us down. And, our waiter (Daniel) was armed-and-ready to take our order. Our drink glasses were constantly filled, which is huge for me. A shutout to The Cheesecake Factory - please do whatever you can to maintain this type of service!  Parking is ample as there is an expansive parking garage (1 1/2 free parking then nominal fee after). Or, you can park at The Exchange (1 1/2 free parking then nominal fee after) a couple blocks away. Or better yet, park at the nearby Glendale Galleria across the street for free! Remember, I advocate walking whenever possible. Overall, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, and honestly, there are only a handful of chains I truly like. The Cheesecake Factory offers a borderline experience for me. Although they have an extensive menu and I've tried items from all category selections, it really is about the cheesecakes. As much as I enjoy their burgers, I believe Red Robin's burgers are comparable if not better, at a better price and bottomless seasoned fries. Based on the prices quoted above (approx. $46.00 before tip), I feel the lack of value is prevalent. The atmosphere is casual, but please dress appropriately depending on the time of day you dine. Thankfully, they take my credit card of choice...AMEX!"
Irene B.,"Pasadena, CA",21,94,218,2.0,1/29/2015,"I love this restaurant and come very often. Had the passion fruit mojito. Service is usually very good. Today i came had lunch and it wasn't what i expected. I love the Cobb salad lunch special, but today it was not good at all! The lettuce was brown and it didn't look like it usually does. No tomatoes didn't look like a Cobb at all and the waitress poured vinaigrette dressing on it. I've had many cobbs here! Never with vinaigrette dressing I was very disappointed they only reason why I give it 2 stars is cause I like the drinks."
Eric K.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/1/2016,"First option to my family, great service and food but better to go early on the weekends."

Christine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",320,8,3,5.0,8/26/2016,"Went in for my grandmother's birthday last night (8/25). Our Hostess Lexi was very SO helpful. My sis and my grandma were kinda being a pain in the *** about the seating. As a restaurant worker for many years, Ill admit I was a bit embarrassed. Lexi was super accommodating, and at the same time, did an awesome job of taking control and being proactive. Of course they had to have a table that was just used and super dirty, but we were sat within 3 minutes. She continuously stopped by to check up on us as she was passing. Bianca was our server. Outstanding, prompt service from beginning to finish. Loved Bianca's upbeat, friendly attitude. Never had to wait long for anything. Took care of our needs before we had to ask for anything. She did a great job of making my grandmother feel special on her night. My grandma couldnt stop talking about how impressed she was. (Believe me, that says a lot.) We were all so very pleased. Thank you so much for everything!!"
Matthew O.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,18,8,5.0,9/27/2015,"Everyone knows about the food. I would like to thank our waiter JOEL. We ordered only appetizers at 10 minutes to closing and you not only treated us with respect and friendliness but made sure our drinks were full, the food was right, and that we got it all fast. Thanks again!!"
Jany N.,"Glendale, CA",4,14,1,5.0,10/13/2013,"It's worth the wait for this place!  Gilbert is an amazing waiter!! Great attitude, very friendly. Checks on you to make sure everything is just right. In addition to that, he made a great recommendation on what dish we should get. It is by far one of the best pastas I've eaten which is called Chicken Bellagio!"
Grace S.,"San Diego, CA",32,88,483,2.0,3/3/2013,"This review is purely on the service. I love Cheesecake Factory food, and this location's food still lived up to its name. Anyway... I don't care how busy you are, once you sit me down, please remember that I am sitting there. This location was probably the busiest Cheesecake Factory I've been to, and considering how busy all the Cheesecake Factories I've been to are like, that is saying a lot. The line to put in your name goes out the door. Waiting time to sitting down is about 45 minutes. Once my friend and I were brought to our table, we sat there for possibly another ten minutes, fifteen minutes before someone came to ask us for our order for our drinks. In fact, other bigger parties were sat down and ordered before we were asked to. I'm not usually an impatient person, but seeing others order before us despite being sat down a long time before they were does not make me very happy. They did not automatically bring us bread either - we had to ask for it. The waitress, though very friendly, seemed to forget about us a couple of times, and then, when we decided to pack up our food and take it home since it was getting too cold out side to eat comfortably, they brought us boxes, but asked us to pack up our food ourselves. Normally, this would be fine, but seeing as every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to packs up your food for you, this was irritating as it was easy to create a mess trying to pack fairly full meals into these tiny boxes.  The two stars are for the food. The minus three stars is for the lack of service. Since it's not my normal destination for Cheesecake Factory, it's safe to say I won't be going out of my way to go here. A side note: My favorites are the luau salad, the tamale appetizer, and red velvet cheesecake. My friend also ordered the spring rolls with shrimp that was ultra delicious as well."
Linda A.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/28/2016,Favorite to go place! Their chicken chipotle pasta is revering and I recommend every one to try it!
Monica S.,"Sun Valley, CA",0,5,2,5.0,4/2/2015,Food was great   The service is great  actually while I had lunch there was a really rude lady made a scene aright next to my table bc they accidentally didn't have the table ready and yelled at one of the hostess. The lady was verryyyy rude and I have to say that the hostess acted so professional and apologized and acted so professional... I left pretty upset even though I had a great experience. Simply bc people don't need to be rude and if they're that picky they should take their attitude/rudeness somewhere else . They are walking into a busy restaurant  it's not the end of the world .
Wendy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,5,1,1.0,9/6/2016,"One of the worst customer service I experienced. First of all the wait time for your food to get there is ridiculous it's a Tuesday why does it take so long, I understand if it's a weekend but a Tuesday. Second the people next to me an behind me got there food before I did. Can I say I don't think it takes long to make 2 plates of spaghetti with meatball. Third I was trying to get someone's attention so I can ask why my food was taking so long while a server was looking my way that individual failed to acknowledge me despite me waving at them. After they arrived to our table she still came with an attitude and quickly brushed us off. Not until my husband stopped one of the waiters and requested to speak to the floor managers. Once he arrived he apologized and tried to make the situation better but the damage had already been done. I explained to the manager that the waiter that had approached our table was really rude and instead of coming to our table with an attitude she should had tried to make her best to find our waiter. Let me tell you this I will never come back to this location. Mind you I always go to the one at The Grove and never experienced this. They should maybe hire or train the waiters and waitresses how to properly speak to a guest and how to handle a situation that was so simple as to saying ""I'm sorry let me go find your waiter""."
Jessica C.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,19,5.0,3/6/2016,Came here with my sister on a busy Saturday night. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated and our server Kelly came to our table right away. She was really friendly and brought our drinks fast. After we ordered and our food was brought out she came to check up on us and made sure everything was good. As we were finishing she offered to pack up our leftovers. I will definitely be going back soon.
Albert A.,"Glendale, CA",9,31,6,1.0,9/23/2016,We went there to celebrate my son 14-th Birthday around 7:30 pm on a Thursday night. The host informed us that the patio is closed and the wait should be no longer then 20 minutes. We got are table around 8:15  45 minutes of waiting. Around 8:28 our clueless server came to take our orders. 3 sodas at $3.50 each took almost 15 minutes to arrive. I asked her can you please clean our table its greasy and sticky she said she will send some one to clean it but no one ever showed up. Dirty tables and booths and I guess no one cares and finally our food ( 2 pastas and a chicken sandwich) arrived at 9:15 after 45 minutes of waiting. When I asked her again no one cleaned our table yet she said sorry we are busy there is nothing I can do. Ha what a nice answer any way she dropped off our food and we didn't saw her until  she dropped off our check. Funny thing is first thing you will notice is percentage of tips already printed on the bill for you but guess what how about a 0% tip for not showing up and checking up on us young lady. The quality of food was horrible they didn't even use fresh garlic in pastas they used jar minced garlic which tasted bad really bad. And the chicken in the sandwich was dry and cold like been cooked hours ago I know a lot about food business you can't fool me. I used to go there a lot but lately in my past 3 visit I noticed that the service is going down and I'll not go there ever again. Over price poor service low quality food Rude servers. I don't know what has changed but this place is not what it was used to be.
Jessica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,2,1.0,3/23/2016,"Came here to celebrate a birthday... Sadly it was not what we expected.  The food was good but the service was horrible. The server had a HORRIBLE attitude. Not only did we have to wait tons of time to be seated, we also had to ask for EVERYTHING. The server had no intention of being polite.. Like I mentioned she didn't even bother to ask if everything was fine or if we needed anything.  What was very upsetting was that the server asked the other two tables next to us if they needed anything. Yes, we were a large group and we weren't speaking english all the time, but when it was time to order and ask for what we all needed we perfectly spoke english and we really tried to be as polite as possible even though the server had a nasty attitude and at ALL times had this ugly expression on her face.  Like I said, service was horrible and while everyone there had been singing happy birthday to their loved ones, we just sat there being  ignored by this nasty server."
Ojitos S.,"Los Angeles, CA",804,44,226,1.0,12/21/2015,"Very disappointing visit... 45 min wait then they call our name and ask us to wait off to the side then 20 min to get walked to our table and leave us standing there because the bus boy wasn't finished cleaning it up (unprofessional) then we sit down and we have hot fresh silverware with food on the spoon. The bartender is terrible!!! We ordered a passion fruit mojito and a long island they were mehhh as if it was a happy hour at a whole in the wall place with a bartender in training.. so we tried the berry mojito... even worse! I had to ask the waiter to bring me the sweetener... I'm a promoter for a nightclub so I know my drinks ;) I ordered the chicken madeira had no flavor but was ok after I added salt and pepper. My boyfriend ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta and it was terrible no flavor! Their was also a table accross from us who didn't even eat what she ordered and the waiter asked her if she wanted to take it home and she said no I didn't like it. They must have a new chef because we eat at the Cheesecake Factory frequently but it was really bad this time! We were there Dec 13, 2015 ordered about 4pm I would give the waiter 5 stars  he was amazing... but I forgot his name lol tall stocky guy brown hair with a beard..."
Yael F.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",9,10,2,4.0,10/10/2014,The service was pretty slow...but the food was great! We ate the stuffed mushrooms and fresh guacamole was delicious!!! And grilled salmon for main course was perfect!!! I guess we will come back soon...
