Lora K.,"Glendale, CA",3,13,,4.0,2/14/2015,"TRY THE BBQ SALMON! Honestly guys this is the place to go when you can't decide what to eat and you're so hungry that just about everything sounds good. Granted you won't get the same quality of Italian pasta you would at an authentic Italian restaurant or the same quality of anything for that matter but this is as close as its going to get. Plus you still get to have whatever you are craving and so does the boyfriend and that saves you so much time on deciding where to go eat. Overall,the food is good and the servers are friendly and attentive not to mention the huge portions Favorites: bbq salmon, avocado eggrolls, thai lettuce wraps, chicken parmesan sandwich...."
Diane K.,"Buena Park, CA",315,136,62,3.0,12/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a super popular place for special occasions so this place was packed on a Saturday night. There was an hour and a half wait for our group...the good news is this place is located in the Americana in Glendale so there's plenty of things to do/see while you wait for your table. You can go on ahead and get a drink from the bar or take pictures in front of the fountain or roam around the three-story Barnes. Cheesecake Factory actually takes your phone number and TEXTS you when your table is ready so that's really convenient!  It's really dim inside so it was kind of hard to read the tiny print on the menu or take any good pictures without flash. Well our group of 11 ordered an array of dishes...here's what we got: - Avocado Egg Rolls (Appetizer: Avocado, tomato, and cilantro wrapped in a crispy wonton wrapper) - Tex Mex Egg Rolls (Appetizer: Chicken, corn, peppers, black beans, onions, and cheese wrapped in crispy wonton wrapper) - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Chicken, asparagus, peas, peppers, garlice and onion with penne pasta tossed in Chipotle cream sauce topped with tortilla crisps) - Hibachi Steak (Angus hanger steak with mushrooms and onions and bean sprouts served with mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus) - Chicken Bellagio (Crispy chicken on basil pasta and topped with prosciutto and arugula)  - Spicy Cashew Chicken (Mandarin-style chicken served with cashews over white rice) The egg rolls were superb! The outer skin was flaky and crispy and delicious while the inside was HOT and creamy and so full of flavor. They are both served with dipping sauces which complement the egg rolls very well. All the entrees, however, were disappointing. Everything was too salty! The cashew chicken and hibachi steak, especially.  My favorite item was the spicy chicken chipotle pasta!  Most items here range in price from $12.95 to $18.95. MOST items. I really liked that they had a ""Skinnylicious"" menu as well for those watching their caloric intake!  Service here was great! Super packed but we felt taken care of and attended to! Our server was very pretty too (:  Parking can be complicated because there are so many structures...but you can park in the Americana parking structure and Cheesecake Factory will validate for you! Or you can park at the Galleria and walk on over~"
Harut Y.,"Burbank, CA",179,228,208,5.0,10/12/2013,"You can NEVER go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  I've been a fan for as long as I can remember, but just recently, I tried the Smokehouse BBQ Burger for the first time, and I found out that I've been missing out all of these years!  It's possibly the BEST flavored burger I've ever had!!! Instantly became my most favorite thing on their menu!!! Give it a try!"
Paul P.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,152,59,1.0,8/31/2015,Takes forever to order something... The tables weren't even ready and they were trying to seat us. Hostess was super rude and didn't look like she was trying to be nice. All the servers here suck! One looked at me and I tried to get his attention and straight ignored me. It's 1pm and it's not that full and they look like they are walking around aimlessly. This cheesecake is by far the worst I Have ever been to.
Richie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,64,6,5.0,1/12/2016,"What an amazing experience at the Cheesecake Factory ! Quick Service, Delicious food, and Jessica's customer service was fabulous ! 5 stars across the board !!"
Steven A.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",1,9,,1.0,9/26/2015,"I am done with this corporate company. Every f****ing time I go here, the FROZEN,PACKAGED,STOUFFERS like plates are outrageous for such a high price. First time was in Pasadena ordered a pesto pasta was DISGUSTING! And the server even said ""yeah I wouldn't have ordered that"" at the end of my paid meal, well thanks for not warning me ahead of time! Then at this Glendale location, 3 days ago, I got the Pasta with Shrimp and sausage, tasted like frozen microwaved sh*t, I had to order a Dr. pepper to wash this frozen sh*t down, and later that day I kept THROWING UP the pasta, and had bad diarrhea, for a couple of hours, felt a mini food poisoning. Ugh why Cheesecake ? Why you gotta have 30 pages of food, but can plate it fresh? Why do you charge so much, I forgot you are a corporate money guzzling conglomerate. The servers are always attentive and sweet ! I guess cheesecake needs that so the food wont taste as shit."
Sarah D.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",91,46,23,4.0,12/21/2015,Love the shrimp Scampi.... Love the strawberry lemonade love the ambiance I just hate the long wait. But at the end of it all I love love this restaurant .
Nancee C.,"San Francisco, CA",16,47,204,5.0,9/13/2015,"We ordered nachos but didn't realize they were so big ! We cancelled enchilada order and servers were so nice and accommodating about it , even tho the order was just about to come out !"
Anna E.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,100,13,3.0,12/11/2014,The food and service is good but the wait is ridiculous. Only reason we came was to see the Christmas tree lighting and we were hungry. We had to wait 2 hours for a table. If it wasn't for how hungry we were we Would've never waited. I got the carpaccio and the fries so good. The waitress was super helpful and nice. Overall good place to eat if ur dressed casual and are hungry.
Tiffany W.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,242,37,5.0,11/20/2012,"The food here is no different than any other Cheesecake Factory.  I like Cheesecake's food.  Great portions, delicious food.   But what I really love about this particular location is the service.  We brought our little puppy with us and happened to remember that there is happy hour M-F 4-6 pm.  We were gonna just give up because we remembered that happy hour requires you to sit at the bar, but my boyfriend went in and asked anyway.  They were gracious enough to allow us to sit outside and still get happy hour prices.  WIN!!  So if you have a dog and still want to enjoy HH here, don't be discouraged.  Only caveat is that you have to tie your dog so that your dog is on the outside, but that's understandable.  We were given no grief by the waiters and thoroughly enjoyed the HH.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory!! Rejoice pet lovers!!! (:*"
Jordan Liam D.,"Calabasas, CA",882,82,39,3.0,3/5/2013,"Farm house burger is pretty good, the wait not so good!  As far as a dining experience it was very rushed, due to the busy nature of the Americana the wait staff were overwhelmed.  Prefer the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove, sorry Glendale!"
Yassi B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",253,49,12,4.0,6/7/2013,"The only reason I deducted a star was because our table was so squished and the resturant was awfully loud! Also the forgot to give us a bread bowl!  Other than that the service was great! My ice tea, appetizer, and salmon came deliciously on time! Only wish I had room to finish my food or even try some cheesecake!"
Regg M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/5/2017,"The food is good... but our server, a white lady that came  to give us our food was so rude. First of all she was taking our plates to the wrong table and then she just basically threw our plates at us after we told her those plates were ours. She then started to walk away and the stupid Mexican(me) asked her if she could get us some bread, she turned around surprised as if I had insulted her, she asked if I wanted both kinds of bread and immediately her tone made me feel that I was wrong by asking a white waiter to give me more bread. That moment I knew that white people serving food are there to serve only other white people. I just wished I had gone to another restaurant and not to the one where most people are white. But come on when there is a white person in a Mexican restaurant they expect us to treat them like tourists going to Baja, I'm surprised they don't try to bargain their bill."
Peter G.,"Valencia, CA",28,51,10,5.0,8/13/2015,"Only came for a quick appetizer and a drink before going to a concert, but Vince the bartender was great. Best martini I've had in a long while. Thanks bro!"
Taylor G.,"Los Angeles, CA",270,368,129,4.0,6/27/2014,"I like this location a lot. They are very accommodating to large parties and the service is great. Had a family gathering the other night and everything was smooth. I had the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus, all very good.  Also, they have Stone IPA on tap served by the pint or 22oz. Not too much craft beer other on the menu but they have a huge fully stocked bar. Validated parking and a lot of space to walk around for after your meal."
Don G.,"Quartz Hill, CA",275,338,49,2.0,10/27/2014,Service is not friendly at all. We started at the bar area while we we're waiting for our food and the waiter that was helping us was rude when he found out we we're waiting for a table. It's understandable that whatever we order there that we would need to close out the check first before moving to the main dining. But to make me wait almost 10 mins to get my check since he hopped from one table to another was unacceptable.  So then we moved to the main dining and it seems even our new waiter has some attitude and seemed snobby/irritated. But he was attentive and refilled drinks. Maybe he was just having an off day. Here's my feedback on the food: calamari - even though it was cooked right. way too much breading and too salty. corn tortilla soup - was amazing pepperoni pizza - crust was great but it was too salty chicken alfredo - pasta was al dente and it tasted great. I have eaten at this Cheesecake Factory before but first time in the Glendale location. The food was better at their other locations.
Fad F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,2,2.0,7/27/2016,"First off, i'm the very last person to post a bad review unless I feel strongly obligated to do so. My family and I came in on a Wednesday (which is usually not a busy day over here seeing that we live within the americana community, and we're pretty familiar with their busiest hours) seeing that the weather is lovely and my youngest feeling a little nauseous, I didnt want to be seated inside so we walked up to the reception and asked for a table outside. We were told that the table would be ready within 40-50 mins (which I understand is only an estimate & inaccurate), ignoring the fact that the two ladies who we spoke to were immensely rude. An hour and 15 mins later, we get a call notifying us that the table is ready, we get there and had to wait ANOTHER 15-20 mins even though the table was obviously ready. Unprofessional, blood boiling and downright unacceptable."
Courtney E.,"Meridian, ID",183,95,319,4.0,10/22/2014,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory!  I'm pretty sure they have the largest menu I've ever seen (especially for a chain restraint).  The food is amazing, there is something for everyone (variety), and the staff is friendly.  I usually visit this location every time I fly in/out of LAX. I really can't think of anything I've tried that wasn't delicious but the Crispy Chicken Costoletta is my absolute fave.  The Chicken de Pana runs a close second if I'm looking for a smaller portion.  Speaking of portions... I could eat 2-3 meals off each order."
Espy B.,"Sun Valley, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/23/2016,"I came here because of drake. It's a nice spot for a Saturday evening date. Yes, the wait is long but I didn't mind it. I ate the shrimp and sausage pasta, so delicious!! And service was friendly."
Alina Z.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/20/2016,"This truly breaks my heart because this is so often my go-to place for good food with good friends and just a grand ole time, but today just really surprised me.  I ordered the Parmesan Garlic bread and the Asian potstickers. I really don't know what happened - just everything seemed so mediocre and half-heartedly prepared (as well as served). Perhaps it was my fault for ordering potstickers from this establishment, but I didn't think it was possible for them to be as awful as they were; the filling, chicken, was very dry, and the sauce seemed desperate to overcompensate for the other flaws in the dish, and honestly, even that was just all over the place, trying way too hard, and failing just as hard, if not harder.  The garlic bread, which I usually love so much, was mostly burnt at the ends, with just lazy presentation. Now most of the time the food is pretty epic, so I believe (and fervently hope) that this was just one bad night. I'll let it slide this *one* time, Cheesecake. For old time's sake."
