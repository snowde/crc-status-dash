Jade H.,"Burbank, CA",0,74,98,2.0,7/23/2017,The menu is huge so if you have a large group you might end up lucky. They validate for the parking structure.  Went in at 5 PM on a Saturday with a group of 10 and I think maybe two people were satisfied with their meals.  Cons: -Watered down drinks across the board.  -Sandwiches that were mostly bread and messily assembled.  -Sad fries that tasted like they'd been under the heat lamp for days and also undercooked.  -pasta with no taste at all  Pros-  Our service was fine.
Andrea K.,"Auburndale, MA",101,123,30,2.0,9/20/2017,"Every time I come here ( this is the 3rd time), it gets a little worse. Despite what the Cheesecake Factory Guest Relations person wrote after my last review, this is not an isolated experience. It's been 8 months and it's just as 2-star as it was back in January. I sat at the bar, which was completely empty. I ordered a Greek salad and the bartender walked away. I had to flag him down to order the rest of my meal. The salad came promptly but for some reason had kernels of corn at the bottom of it. At first, I didn't know what it was and was almost feeling sick because there were dried yellow particles in it. I realized it was corn and felt slightly better but - gross. I asked the bartender about it, he said, ""wow. That shouldn't be there"" and walked away. I asked to speak to the manager who was apologetic and accommodating. He said, ""it just falls into the salads sometimes"". I asked if he'd take half off of the salad, since I'd eaten half before I saw the corn. He took my check & said he'd be back. 20 mins later I asked the bartender if he knew where my check was. He said he'd ask the manager but eventually just reprinted it, the manager had removed the salad. That was nice, and above what I requested, but to not come back and to keep me waiting so long was a bit.... crappy.  I can see how corn ends up in salads if the GM doesn't have the customer service etiquette to follow-through with the customers; there's a low standard of service set at this location and after reading other reviews I can see it's an ongoing problem here."
Maria G.,"Ventura, CA",0,8,16,2.0,5/6/2017,"We didn't go at a bad time, we were seated almost right away. Service wasn't bad, but one of our cups still had a tag on it. Like it obviously wasn't brand new and had gone through the washing system a few times but the cup still had it on. I would have figured that at least it would have been taken off at some point in time before it reached the table. I got the pizza and salad lunch special and my pizza was so hard. Like it was so over cooked and difficult to eat.  Either way it was okay."
Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",144,208,1030,1.0,8/24/2017,"Tamara's actions lead me to believe that she's a novice manager. I'm definitely disappointed with my experience here, tonight. I used to frequent this location. However, after tonight's experience, I don't know that I'll be coming back anytime real soon. Unfortunate. The dish that I ordered was supposed to come with both pasta and chicken.  The chicken was to be breaded after it was pounded to death, to make it thin and easy to cook. Anyway, the chicken was presented to me in pieces, looking like someone had taken it possibly to a different table, it being cut into and then taking it back to bring it to my table.  Anyway, it was definitely not what I'd received in previous visits.  I explained to the manager that the plating alone made it very unappetizing.  So, she offered to take it back and to have a new one made.  I said that would be OK.  After a few moments, she brought my dish back to me and showed me that it was OK and that I was basically sending back a dish that was perfectly fine.  Why would you do that? I told you that I was disgusted by the appearance of the dish and yet you bring it back to me. Why? To say that I was wrong and throw it in my face? Not cool!  This was not the best performance from this particular manager.  You don't bring the dish back and try and prove to the customer that the manager or kitchen staff were right, and not you.  It took forever for my replacement to come and just before it did, I told them to forget my order and just remove it from my bill.  By the time that I'd just finished saying that, the dish appeared behind the manager.  I told them I still didn't want it and that my experience there had just been miserable and embarrassing even.  I don't appreciate behavior like that. So, I told them to take the dish off my bill and to forget it. I was no longer in the mood to eat there. The manager refused. I told them that I would NOT be paying for something that had been ill prepared and that I never ate. I NEVER took a bit from the first plate or the 2nd one that FINALLY came along. I eventually was able to speak to their GM.  They had the dish removed immediately without my really having to go through the re-cap of my horrible experience. They even offered me a complimentary dessert for that night or a future night. Whatever. That didn't make it OK. I'm still NOT a happy camper!  I haven't been back since early this year, February 2017."
Amantur S.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,86,168,5.0,5/17/2017,We got attended by Demarise this last time I went and I would love to say that she had fantastic customer service. She was very helpful in getting our orders right and exactly how you wanted it. She was also checking on us here in there to make sure we were OK and was enjoying our food. The food is always good at cheesecake if you haven't tried it you were definitely missing out.
C. C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",9,154,13,2.0,12/22/2017,Not impressed with the service. Appetizers took 30 minutes after the server apologized twice. Entrees came out two minutes after the apps. Again server apologized. I don't care about the money but she should have comped the apps. Only going to go back because I have credit on my gift card. After that probably not. Two stars because the burger was tasty.
Emmanuel M.,"Hanford, CA",2,23,5,1.0,12/22/2017,"This is a story of the last time I will ever give my business to a Cheesecake Factory. This review isn't about the food, it's about an item that was left at this particular restaurant. 12/17/17, has dinner here with my girlfriend. We leave the restaurant and once we're home we realize we left an item (cologne from Sephora) back at the restaurant. I immediately call once I realized it and luckily, one of the staff members set the item aside with my name and number. A day passes, I call the restaurant and tell them I'll be there in a couple days to pick it up. They assure me it fine, item is still set aside. 12/22/17 I drive to the restaurant for the item, one of the host says he can't find it, but he can take my name and number so he can speak to a manager later to locate the item...I explain to him I'm not from the area and drove an hour and a half to pick up my item and I was told it was set aside for me with my name and number attached. After beating around the bush a little, a manager finally comes and speaks to me and says it's not in the managers office and it's not in the lost and found, there's isn't anything they can do, and it's gone. I ask if he can speak to the waiter from that night and he says it wouldn't be possible to find out who was working that night....he gives a corporate number for loss prevention, which I call and goes to a voicemail. Do not leave anything at Cheesecake Factory, especially if it's a gift for a loved one...unfortunately their loss prevention is negligible and they employ thieves."
Geoff Y.,"London, United Kingdom",147,349,86,5.0,2/28/2017,"In the middle of the Americana mall, probably the best place to eat between that and the Glendale Galleria and it's just started to rain. Of course it was going to be busy. But go to the desk, put your name down, get their estimate and mentally at 15 minutes, take the little buzzer and walk away from the immediate area. Find a quiet spot in the waiting area if you can, or break ranks and leave the family behind and do some shopping while they wait. What you don't do is constantly go to the desk asking for an update or make a big deal about how long the queue is. People got there before you, deal with it, the hostesses don't need for you to give them a hard time. As it was for us, I managed to get a little shopping done at the Apple store and Barnes and Noble during the 30-minute wait (on the dot! No extension to their estimate). And we were taken to our booth and a high chair was brought for my niece. Good service from the waitress, not great but she did have a very busy section. Menus were looked at and dishes chosen, a mixture of appetisers and entrees. These were ordered and delivered in good time, and the table quickly got crowded with plates, which were quickly whisked away once emptied. Their spinach and artichoke dip is great, although the nachos were slightly too big for a non double dipper. They were definitely two biters. The egg roll platter didn't do anything for me although lots of tables were ordering it. The mains looked great and were apparently very tasty, I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp, which was great. Thai spices, peanut sauce, good amounts of chicken and quite a few shrimp (although I'd have preferred more shrimp, less chicken) and a nice load of vegetables. It was a bit much though and I was happy sharing it with other members of my family. No cheesecake eaten at the cheesecake factory, but I learned a long time ago that you can either eat a main course or a dessert there, never both if you want to continue functioning!"
Debbie F.,"Santa Monica, CA",229,235,493,4.0,4/6/2017,"Let's start with location.  What a beautiful setting at the Americana.  It's located in a nice shopping area with plenty parking (small fee) and beautiful grounds.  It is right as you walk out of the parking garage, so easy to find.   The food here is good.  I have been going to various locations for years and always enjoy each meal.  I have come to love the healthier options menu where the portions are still quite big.  Everything is tasty and big portions to go with the semi-pricey cost.  The bread they serve at the beginning of the meal is delicious, esp. the pumpernickel.  Now really what they are known for is the cheesecake.  With a very overwhelming menu of choices, there is something for everyone.  I recommend sharing as the cake slice is large too.  You really can't go wrong here."
Rola T.,"Burbank, CA",193,178,116,4.0,4/6/2017,"The food is always good here. The bread and butter is always a plus as well. Pretty basic otherwise. They have a large large selection of items, they're menu is many pages. Many cheesecake flavors to choose from. Definitely some of the best cheesecake I've ever had. Service was prompt, and the location at the Americana is very large and pretty. We showed up for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and we waited about 5 minutes for a table. We love this location, and would return."
_annahh M.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,108,31,5.0,9/6/2017,"My favorite place to enjoy dinner. I basically try a item on the menu that's new to me bc the taste and quality never lets me down at any location. Complimentary bread and butter upon arrival. The strawberry cheesecake is to die for, they even have a sugar free strawberry  one too.  Cocktails here is on point, it does of course get busy on Friday & sat evenings. Service is great, you don't wait long for you food, appetizers are all am A+"
Veronica L.,"Monterey Park, CA",131,97,381,4.0,9/2/2017,"I have to start off by saying they have one of the best menus I've ever seen! Like literally, it's a long menu and you have soooo many options. Also, leave room for dessert because you ARE at the Cheesecake Factory so it's a must. You have to try the avocado egg rolls they are delicious! The only thing that sucks about this place is that the wait is always long. The bread they start you off with is so good too by the way."
Kristine J.,"Los Angeles, CA",887,442,2827,4.0,2/5/2017,Service and food were great! This is probably the best location I've been to.  None of the foods came out lukewarm or frozen tasting. See pics for what we ordered. Also got the calamari--very crunchy & chewy. Perfect sauces came with it. Tuesday for lunch was a good time to go. Didn't have to wait even though it looked kinda packed!
Reneh M.,"Glendale, CA",57,8,,5.0,1/3/2018,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The  variety of food here is amazing, starting from salads, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, etc. Every time I've came here my waiter/waitress has treated me in such good manner. I always get the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and it's amazing!  Also my go to appetizer is the avocado egg rolls, they are so delicious. Hands down best restaurant I've been to in Glendale!"
Minsky C.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Pre ordered a whole truffle tower chocolate cake that my daughter requested for her bday Party. Ordered it yesterday for pick up today. Went to pick it up at 5:30 today and the cashier said they didnt have the cake. It was for my daughter's 15th bday and New Years Eve party. Spoke to the manager who was useless, unprofessional and unapologetic. Didn't even make an effort to call other locations to check availability. All he said pretty much is that the order taker messed up... oh really? Did she? Like I said , USELESS. I called other locations and Had to drive all the way to Arcadia to get one."
Ninella K.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,1,1.0,10/9/2017,"I ordered Louisiana chicken pasta which is my favorite but as I was eating I noticed the plate was covered with a thick layer of oil. I asked the waitress if this is the normal amount of oil they usually use for this dish, and she said ""yes, I'm sorry""!!! I didn't finish it cause it was so disgusting."
Juan C.,"Glendale, CA",2,4,,1.0,11/22/2017,"Just saw how a fork fell in the floor on the disgusting outside patio floor and the waiter grab it and put it in the utensil set and took it to a table. Also all 4 forks in my table for 2 where dirty and I am not talking about water stains I am talking about big dry food chunks. When they change our utensils the new hanker shift had a fresh stain of ketchup on it.  The main dishes were ok, the presentation was OK not great and the flavor was good. But after seeing the lack of higiene we could not eat at ease. I am definitely not eating here again."
Lauren K.,"Irvine, CA",2,26,30,3.0,5/27/2017,"Went out to dinner here last night, and it literally took TWO hours to get seated. We had a group of about 10 people, and checked in at 620pm. After going in a few times for a status update, and even requesting to talk to the manager, we were finally called in to be seated at 810pm. Even on a busy night, I think that's pretty unacceptable. Our waiter, Gilbert, introduced himself and said he was going on break. His replacement was so stone-faced that we wondered if he was having a bad day or if he was just like that every day. But when Gilbert returned just when our food was coming out, all was well again. Gilbert is honestly one of the most charismatic and caring waiters I have ever had! He was so on top of it and had the best attitude the whole time! If I could just rate the point of the dinner from when Gilbert returned to our table after his break, I would give the restaurant five stars because his service is amazing, the food tasted great (presentation is nice, and the portions are huge), and we all had a fantastic time (and practically forgot about the beginning of the night). The manager is also incredibly friendly!"
Gia K.,"Escondido, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/30/2017,A hidden gem! Just made a quick stop here for an appetizer after I picked up my daughter at the end of her prom as I wasn't super hungry so I had the chicken taquitos along with a raspberry lemonade and I wasn't disappointed. The food here is always on point and the ambiance is always lively at any of their locations!
Ruby S.,"Glendale, CA",140,335,385,1.0,7/31/2017,Never will we EVER return to this Cheesecake Factory. The parking sucks. The people suck. The food sucks. The prices suck. The service suck. Everything is just horrible. Regardless of the day or time you will have to wait even if there are tables open. They always stick us in this tiny corner by the wall with chairs which SUCK and are very uncomfortable. We came here last week again to give it 1 last shot and it was completely horrifying. My girlfriend got the steak and ordered it medium well with potatoes. Her steak came out so well done it was super hard and black. She had a very hard time cutting it and she was chewing it as if they left it on the stove for 30 min. My orange chicken was okay but the rice itself wasn't fully cooked and tasted very starchy. We told our waiter and he apologized and took it back. We had to ask a different waiter for water because our server was so slow to return and it wasn't very busy either it was on a weekday. 25 min went by and no steak. He said they were cooking it as fast as they could...now I don't know about you but I can cook a steak on my tiny BBQ with 1 single propane tank in about 10 minutes especially how thin it was. The man returned after and still no steak and offered her a salad/soup. She asked for a salad and they brought her a tiny garden salad that was OLD!!! The leaves were stale and turning purple and tasted gross!!!  Another 10 minutes went by and by that time she had finished the orange chicken with me and her steak came. It was cooked great this time and the potatoes tasted fresh. We waited for our check for so long. He did not offer to take off any items or to discount anything and there was not a manager in site. Horrible customer service. We even ordered a cheesecake to go and even that wasn't on the house.... he charged us for 2 steaks since they had to make 2 and he had to have his manager take off 1 so we still payed for the steak. The best thing about this place was the free bread. That's pretty sad.....and even the white bread was super old and hard just the black ones were great. We will never return here and I was so embarrassed to take my girl here. We were here a total of 2.5hrs for a steak and orange chicken and we ordered waters.... HORRIBLE!!!!
