Farhana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,436,2031,4.0,10/7/2014,"This is my absolute favorite Cheesecake Factory location! The service we received was phenomenal! Had the best waiter! The location is also awesome beacause it's right inside the Americana! Shop, eat, watch a movie and enjoy the view! Love the happy hour specials which include the fire roasted artichoke, buffalo blasts and mini sliders!"
aris n.,"Montrose, CA",158,144,74,5.0,9/7/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory, what can i say its a perfect marriage for the American in Glendale.   I love almost everything on the menu, the decore and the service. We ordered filet Mignon and got a bad cut,  manager made it right by taking it off the bill.  If you wabt fine dinning and a place to walk around this place is the spot.  Perfect for date night."
Judy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,16,,5.0,2/22/2015,"i was so pleased with this restaurant!   My bf and I go out and have dinner and so many times we are disappointed.  But not last night! Our server Gordan, was so very attentive.  I'm not the easiest person to get an order from.  I wanted something fruity and chose a vodka infused lemonade.  My bf wanted a peach smoothie.  Both drinks were great.  The peach smoothie had some raspberry in it and some fresh fruit garnish.  My vodka lemonade came in a sugar rimmed glass and was crisp and refreshing.   I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and my bf ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Burger medium rare.  Our food came quickly and we were so satisfied!  Mine was 3 pounded chicken breasts with a delicious lemon sauce, a generous portion of smashed red potatoes, and crisp asparagus.  It was so good!   My bf is pretty picky about his burger being cooked medium rare and his burger was perfect!  It came piled high with onion rings and fries.  It looked more like an art project and he loved it.   We decided to have coffee and split a slice of Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake.  We both like coconut and this dessert has a layer of chocolate cake, a layer of brownie, coconut-pecan frosting and chocolate chip coconut cheesecake.  It' was the bomb!  Super rich and flavorful, we dug in!   My bf got a phone call from a client and we had to split.  We asked Gordan for some to go cups for the coffee and a box for the rest of the cheesecake.  Now, I figured he would bring empty cups so we could pour our coffee into it.  No!  He brought us 2 fresh coffees in to go cups!  I thought that was really nice and considerate of him!  He didn't have to do that.   I have to say the wait staff at this restaurant was exceptional.  This is a HUGE place with tons of tables and we were there on a Saturday evening so it was packed!  Despite that, our waiter was very patient with us and that was so refreshing.  He really cared about us and was very intuitive as to what we needed.  The table next to us had a different waiter and I made eye contact with her while she was talking to her table.  After she finished at her table, she came by and asked if I needed anything.  I didn't, but what if I did?  I liked that she was attentive and willing to help another table  that wasn't hers.  So many times it's like, pfft...not my table.  But not here. I would definitely come here again.  The food and the service was fantastic!   (I don't get the negative reviews about the food.  Especially that lady complaining about the calories and the fat content.  So don't eat here.  It's not that hard of a concept.)"
John B.,"Glendale, CA",1,7,2,1.0,2/20/2016,Typically I love the Cheesecake Factory...tonight the service at the bar SUCKED! It took forever to get a drink. The bartender (bearded guy) asked if I was having drinks? Dinner? I said both. He gave me a menu but never came back to ask me what I wanted to order. I was at the bar for over a half hour. I finished my beer...pint glass completely empty. I waited 5 minutes (there were only 4 other people at the bar) NO RESPONSE from bartender. Finally I had to flag him over to get my bill and get the hell out of there before I starved!!!
Mary M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,24,14,5.0,1/14/2016,My husband brought me here for a romance and no regrets! Great place with nice service and wonderful menu ! We had a realy great time here! Get the salt caramel cheesecake! That's as delicious as you can imagine !! Thanks to my husband for making my day!!
Jackie F.,"Menifee, CA",0,11,1,1.0,7/31/2016,3rd time at cheesecake and I just can't deal with their customer service all 3 visits were worst than any restaurant that I've ever been to. The food is good but nothing you can't find anywhere else .
Mangas C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,36,5.0,8/4/2014,This place is the best me my fiancee   at least twice a week and last night I called them and talked to their manager and I asked for a favor to have a ice cream with a plate n write I love you on it n send to my fiances table a surprise and he said np I was willing to pay anything for it but he said its on the house and she got it ans she was soo excited n surprised I called back and thanked them I really love this people I work at a big mamas and papas pizzeria as a manager and I would love to help.out with special requests like this and they did it thank you cheesecake factory for what u have done for us she was havin a bad mood and.u changed that thank u soo much as I told the manager I love you guys cant wait to go there again.
Christopher K.,"Los Angeles, CA",264,10,43,2.0,8/8/2015,Food here is ok. Super high in calories. My main complaint is more about customer service. I can't believe places like this do not take reservations.... absolutely absurd. Actually they are just doing what dumb ass venues do in LA... try to make people wait in front to show they are busier and to create hype. Ugh. Pathetic actually. There is no reason for a restaurant of this size to not take reservations. #fail
Stephanie R.,"San Francisco, CA",7,89,488,3.0,8/15/2015,"Don't get me wrong, I love cheesecake and the restaurant is always a favorite. But the fact is that they're overpriced and their actual food is mediocre, especially their pasta. The best thing to do here is order apps and cheesecake and dig in. Don't bother with the real meals and expect more kids than the usual cheesecake factory since its right inside the americana.  On the plus side, you can wait to be seated and grab sprinkles next door before getting a table."
Mitch F.,"Yuba City, CA",77,4,2,4.0,2/4/2015,"Cheesecake Factory always has pretty good food,  I almost went to one of the other restaurants in this mall tonight,  but I'm glad I came here. My waitress was Trintee and she fantastic.  (like Connie K said in another review about possibly a different waitress) She was beautiful and extremely pleasant to talk to.  I'm down here for business for the next two days,  and feeling kind of lonely,  it was refreshing to come across someone who is so wonderfully inviting,  it all seemed very genuine. I got the Pineapple Moscow Mule which tasted great!  And per my waitresses recommendation,  I got the stuffed tortillas,  which was also very good. It seemed to me that this Cheesecake factory is staffed with a good group of people,  if I'm in the area again,  I will seriously consider coming here for food over other restaurants specifically for this reason.  Cheers! :)"
Ernie B.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",236,73,18,5.0,9/21/2014,"Pros: This was my second time here and I must say that the food and the service were 10+ rating in my book. I loved our waitress, she was friendly and was attentive the whole time we were there even though they were busy. They will text you while you wait for your seat to open which is kinda cool. Cons: Takes about 1 hour to get a seat, so visit the Apple store or something while you wait"
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,4.0,7/16/2012,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, so there's always a wait.  The good thing is that this is located at the Americana, so you can browse the area while waiting for your beeper to go off. My daughter and I have gone here on occasions.  One thing about a corporate owned restaurant is that the food and service are generally consistent.  I had the buffalo wings this time.  My daughter had the rib eye rare.  The arugula salad is really simple yet exquisite.  The cheesecakes are a delight.  One slice can serve four people-no joke."
Chuck D.,"Los Angeles, CA",654,1172,8489,4.0,3/4/2013,"Cheesecake always has consistency going for it. It never really disappoints. The food is always good. The portions are huge. The service is almost always dependable and the prices reasonable. My regular order here is the crusted chicken romano. I opt for linguini pasta rather than the angel hair. It's a slightly breaded thin breast of chicken with a little cheese to its crust. The pasta is in a standard tomato sauce. It's my go to dish here. I also like the road side sliders. Perfect little burgers of ground beef & onions served on dinner rolls. Already comes with ketchup. Genius! Hold the pickles, yo! The pizzas are good, the salads are monsters.... The most popular dishes are probably the jambalaya and chicken madeira. The bread is good, the butter is delish... The pulled pork sammich... was surprisingly disappointing. The chunks were too big. Couldn't eat it in that sandwich. It needed to be shredded or actually pulled apart more.  I had the fish & chips before and I really liked it. I found myself craving it last Friday night. And being Lent, it was perfect for a take home dinner. Called it in, avoided the madness that is the Cheesecake Factory waiting area and took it home. It was crispy, delicious, the batter was perfect. It comes with coleslaw, tartar sauce for dipping & french fries. A good serving of coleslaw, I might add. The only thing I would add is an extra container of tartar sauce. I'll ask for that next time. Good meal, nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
Jamee R.,"Irvine, CA",0,31,6,5.0,6/23/2014,"Where do I start? I absolutely LOVE this place. The customers are not my favorite, but the staff is excellent!  I came in last week with my grandmother to have the infamous Peach Bellini and salmon! It is OUT OF THIS WORLD. My grandma was visiting from out of state and always requires a trip to the Americana with a pit stop at Cheesecake Factory. I have always been a fan, but last friday (6/20/14) was one for the books. Our server was one of the most PHENOMENAL people I have ever encountered. He made our experience well worth it. Not only did he suggest trying the salmon special (which we LOVED) he also complimented us on our taste of the menu! My grandma was beaming from ear to ear. Jason is one of a kind and he makes that restaurant glow! I hope management treats him like royalty. I wish I was a big wig in Hollywood so I could hand him everything on a gold platter! Jason - if you read this, thank you for making my grandma and I's special dinner date the best we have had yet! Also - if you love S'mores, GET THEIR S'MORE CHEESECAKE! out of this WORLD! We took it home and ate it later, it was incredible."
Tanaz S.,"Irvine, CA",8,160,127,1.0,6/4/2015,"I asked for a table for 2 and a poppy for outside patio. They said sure. After waiting 20 min to be seated, they told us the poppy has to be outside the rail meaning outside the restaurant. We left and got so upset that they didnt tell us that from the beginning. So disappointing and unprofessional"
Mara F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",50,79,21,3.0,8/14/2015,"The service is nice and timely, the food is delicious and the portions are large (at least the salads are), but the temperature in this place is unbearably low. It is so cold, that after a few minutes you literally want to run out! I had to put on the sweater I had just purchased at one of the stores before coming here. If not for that sweater, I wouldn't be able to finish my plate. I mean it is really very bad. Minus 2 stars for that stupid cold."
Grace A.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",203,113,286,4.0,9/23/2014,"Let me start by just saying i absolutely love the Cheesecake factory! There isn't a thing I've tried here that i have not liked. Although it takes me like a good 20 minutes to decide what I want from the decent sized menu.. i usually always opt for my fav dish here which is hands down the ""jambalaya"". Full size.. Eat half of it there and since Im a major fan of left overs.. I always have to save myself a good amount for my next meal. Although , Ive always left room for a cheesecake.. The older i get.. I can't fathom denting my wallet with a $10 slice of my whole days calorie intake. But thats just my 2 cents.."
Trevor G.,"Tujunga, CA",16,89,3,4.0,11/20/2015,We come 3 or 4 times a year for happy hour and appetizers and never disappointed. Today we tried lunch and from the hundreds of selections chose something we ended up not crazy about. We both ordered the Asian chicken salad. I ate about 10% of mine and my wife maybe 50%. When asked if we wanted it boxed I just mentioned we weren't crazy about it. I wasn't complaining as we were trying something we hadn't ordered before (my bad). When the bill arrived the server told me the manager had taken one of the salads off the bill. I'm not used to restaurants taking food off the bills so we added most of the meal cost to the tip. I'm dropping one star for a $14 martini with lunch. For sure we'll be back but no Asian salads and no martinis. They have lots more to offer.
Seven J.,"Dana Point, CA",5,68,35,5.0,1/21/2015,"Omg,  i love this place.  I had the best waiter ever! Please sit at Kevin section.  He was funny and made me try the fried mac n cheese burger, which was to die for. Thank you Kevin for you checking on us,. It was so good I instagram it. Plus the Georgia peach drink taste just like like a peach. Please go,  the area is beautiful and sweet. Even the manner Ashley was nice.  Thank you for the best experience.  Coming from orange County is wroth the drive. I'll be back!"
Jowita C.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,1,5.0,7/18/2016,"Jessie the bartender was extremely rude, unapologetic and beyond unprofessional. The worst cheesecake experience ever and I will not get into detail. However, Ashley the manager turned the whole situation around. She turned my friends birthday from a nightmare to a fairytale .. We appreciate awesome customer service and managers who could be leaders and about customer satisfaction. Thank you Ashely! True definition in upmost management. You're the best!!!"
