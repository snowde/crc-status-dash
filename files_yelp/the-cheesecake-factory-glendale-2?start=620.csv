David B.,"Calabasas, CA",0,382,14,1.0,8/4/2016,"I went for Brunch and the manager Chris was called to deal with our food that was made wrong.  The manager Chris gave horrible customer service with an attitude.  It took twice as long to bring the food out and when we asked Chris how much longer,  he raised his voice and said ""I don't know! """
Tal B.,"Glendale, CA",78,16,,1.0,12/12/2015,"I would have given them zero star actually! Their service is horrible! I have three points to support my disappointment...  1) came with my best friends to this location- they brought order VERY late. Besides they had forgotten my friend's order and when they brought it, it was actually NOT the right food she had ordered!  2) came with the same friends months later, and they were experiencing some issues with their oven. Since we were going to order salad only we decided to still go in, specially that there was no wait time. So after waiting for 20 min i went to the register and reminded them that we were waiting for them to come take the order. Even though they said they are going to take our order NOW, we waited for ANOTHER 10 min and then left UNSATISFIED.  3) came here for a date and the waitress that was assigned to us had some sort of attitude. She did not smile or greed us at all! She then came to us to report that our order was going to take 20 min to be ready, because ""they were making it from scratch"" i mean c'mon!  Regardless of how busy their business is, i think their management must consider that their loyal customers will eventually choose to not go to this place in Glendale because  of their service."
Will C.,"Burbank, CA",0,44,42,1.0,2/1/2016,"Went there for an early dinner around 3:30. Waited 20 mins for a table then we sat down and waited 20 more mins for a server. Guy came and we placed our entire order 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and 2 waters. Crab artichoke dip came after 15 mins and edamame came 10 mins later. Still no waters. Then 20 mins later my Asian salad and my girls steak medallions came. Still no water. Bread sat empty for about 30 mins before they finally brought it. Waters came....woo hoo!  Then about 2/3 way through the Salad I come upon across a 3 inch tooth pic. Told the waiter and he says ""Man you're having a rough day"". Needless to say I expect a discount or something. He didn't offer so I didn't ask. But I was never a huge fan so I prolly won't be back......"
Mary A.,"Glendale, CA",0,69,,5.0,8/3/2016,All i can say is YUMMMM!!! Cheesecake Factory is my absolute favorite place to dine out. Food is amazing with the best prices. Exceeds my limits :)
Noel P.,"Glendale, CA",0,14,,5.0,8/2/2016,It's aug 2nd 10:13 pm. I'm waiting to be seated and it's such a packed house. So many people making orders and requesting tables. Lots of people being demanding and rude. You guys are doing great. Vanessa at the front is handeling the traffic very well. There's no way I could take or handle all of this mayhem. You guys are awesome. Keep it up!

Dona H.,"Pasadena, CA",6,48,2,5.0,10/16/2015,"Today was a good night here. Server was Josh, and he was on top of it with a sense of humor. Had a glass of Mark West Pinot Noir with a vegan cobb salad w/ chicken. Absolutely would do it again."
Natalie H.,"Glendale, CA",4,5,1,4.0,2/10/2016,"My meal was exactly what I expected from Cheesecake Factory and exactly what I wanted.  Who can't find something that sounds good here??  I thought having to park in the structure would be a pain and a bit of a walk, but but really wasn't.  There was no wait and the waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I'll be coming again for sure."
Marianne A.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,57,,5.0,1/5/2016,"My first review was two stars because of the outside seating atmosphere - kids running around uncontrolled and throwing toys on the ground. This review is five stars because we ate lunch in the bar area late one afternoon and it was a completely different and really nice experience - because the bartender Katherine E and the guy bartender (whose name I didn't get) were friendly and fast and took great care of us. Saturday afternoon about 5pm after a movie and the line of customers waiting to check in with the hostess was lined up to the doors. When we got to the front we found that the wait was over an hour for two of us and would've been way longer for more people. Open seating is first come first served in the bar area but nothing was open. They were out of pagers so we were given a paper ticket to come back at a certain time.  We walked around the Americana for about thirty minutes and then wandered back to take another look at the bar area to see if anything had opened up in there. There were two stools at the very end of the bar top with a flat panel tv overhead and a good amount of space there, not crammed together. I have no clue why they were empty and why there was nobody else standing there waiting to snag anything that opened up. Lucky for us that we were only two and were glad to sit there.  When I went to take our name off of the list it was total chaos around the host/hostess stand -with the people with tickets trying to get to the stand to claim their arrival time right next to the people just arriving and trying to put their name on the list. I heard them saying to those just arriving that the wait was an hour and a half.  For our experience this time, it would've been worth an hour and a half wait. Katherine was the bartender who greeted us and laid out two clean white napkins like a tablecloth on the bar top when she found out we were going to be eating there with them. She and the other bartender were so welcoming and super nice to us even though they were slammed and taking care of drink orders for (I guess) the whole restaurant as well as for people in the bar - and punching in the food and making drinks and getting refills for those of us eating. The food runner guy was also really nice. Even though they were so busy, all of them seemed to really care about making it as good of an experience as possible for us and the rest of the customers - and I think most of us at the bar that afternoon were eating food, not just getting snacks or drinks.  To add to a really great experience, the food we ordered came out absolutely perfect - especially/even the burger - which can be hit or miss almost anywhere when you request it to be grilled medium and especially if the kitchen is jamming. The bread and butter basket was given to us just as if we had been at a table or booth. Factory Burger on wheat loaf with swiss cheese, sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo on the side, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - then we had two complimentary slices of cheesecake from gift cards so we got a slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake and a slice of key lime cheesecake and took some of it home.  We live about thirty miles from here- this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to us - for whatever it's worth, we will totally come back here and try to get a spot at the bar top again !"
Christy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,60,22,4.0,9/1/2014,"Been going here for many years and its still awesome. Service here is the best.  A bit slower if it is packed. Prices really range, But to me its a 4 star chain so expect to pay a bit more. Love the shephard's pie. Very creamy and yummy. Recommend going to any Cheesecake Factory."
Arbi G.,"Glendale, CA",333,230,81,1.0,4/11/2014,"Why write a review for a place that does not have any consideration for anyone or anything. Just surprised on a restaurant this magnitude does not take reservation. Place like Americana which is build for families to enjoy a night out. People with children have to wait an hour or even more to have dinner. It all comes from pure management, and you can't blame them, why take in consideration for their costumers comfort when the place is packed and makes money either way. If there was zero stars only!!!!!!!"
Calvin F.,"Burbank, CA",76,288,2,3.0,2/16/2013,"I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistent in taste throughout their chains. The food portions seems to be shrinking from previous visits. White Chicken Chili-Delicious, tasty and rich with flavor. Served with white rice. Tex Mex Eggrolls-Spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions, and cheese. Great.  Portion size-aprox 2 cups of chili and 1/3 cup rice. Cost $12.50                       3 eggrolls cut in halves. Cost $9.95 Service-1 hour wait, quoted 30 minutes. Waitress was very pleasant, and cordial. Parking-Free with validation. Very large parking structure. Choice of valet or self parking."
Falon D.,"Pasadena, CA",271,15,1,1.0,2/1/2016,"If I could rate my experience here a zero I would. Typically my ""cheesecake factory experience"" is delightful however at this location it was not even close. My father was from out of town visiting so I took him here for a nice relaxing dinner before his flight. We waited ""15 minutes"" which was 45 minutes. When we got seated half of us got our drinks and then 15 minutes later after we had to ask the waitress the rest of us got them. 3 out of 4 meals came out, at the same time as the appetizers I might add. My father's food came out a full hour later after hassling the waitress who was avoiding us. By far a horrible experience and will never go again, let alone this particular location may have ruined the cheesecake factory for me for forever."
Art M.,"Burbank, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/16/2015,"57 degrees outside...the ac was blasting (guess they found a way to get guest swallow down the food and get out under 15 min).  After asking to adjust the ac, it was turned off for 5 min and came back on (to make the quick turnaround of ""customers"") Never again!"
William S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,27,2,5.0,10/17/2015,"There are few places that prepare fried calamari this well. Light, crispy batter outside, moist, tender inside.  I also recommend  fish tacos tempura style. I was delighted with the generous plate of four hearty tacos and spicy black beans. Attentive service, too."
Greg G.,"Fresno, CA",41,100,86,2.0,9/23/2015,"I've been to this location enough times to finally leave a review, vary mixed experiences here however I don't remember any of them to be that pleasant. It's Cheesecake Factory, workers scrambling for seats and taking us back 3 times to a booth to only realize it was still occupied. Service was okay, food was actually great like always. I've personally never had an issue with the food except when I ordered Evelyn's 'Favorite' Pasta, from then on I realized that it would continue to only be her favorite because it was pretty disgusting."
Moe S.,"Breistroff-la-Grande, France",3,69,4,4.0,9/17/2014,"Alright ima review this place in 4 simple things the seating, the food, the service and the cheesecakes: 3/5 for the seating, I'm not a big fan of the decor of the place it's nothing special at all 3/5 the food is good but nothing that left me to crave it again 5/5 the service was amazing I loved out waiter he was nice and very helpful 5/5 the cheese cakes here are amazing ive had my share of cheesecakes here and they are defiantly top notch  So over all I'll give this place a 3.5/5  but I'll round it off to a 4 because I only go there mainly for the cheesecake :)"
Lakashia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,69,64,4.0,6/23/2015,First time eating at this location. The wait was fast we arrived during Happy Hour. Our waiter Moses was very attentive and provided great customer service.
Rosie W.,"Glenview, IL",0,3,,4.0,1/12/2016,"I know it's a chain but we've had pretty good luck previously . Located in the Americana shopping center, you have to park in the garage to get there. Parking is validated. It's right outside the garage so it's convenient to get to.  Dinner was good as expected. My daughter had the orange chicken which could have been shared by 3 people! My husband had the full size chicken Caesar which could have been split by 2 people. I ordered a side salad & ordered from their skinnylicious menu which is a normal size plate. The steak medallions was very good. We shared caramel cheesecake (  natch!!)  But the best of the night was our waiter Josh. OMG, what a character. He made our dinner so much fun. He was a cross between Roseanne Barr &  Nathan Lane. Very entertaining. Thank you Josh."
