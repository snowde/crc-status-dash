Patty D.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,1,1.0,7/14/2016,Went as a big group and got seated quickly. Food was great. The only reason why I wouldn't go back to this specific one is because the waiters tend chase after you and harass you about how unhappy they are about the tip we left. That's so uncomfortable and honestly rude.
Lynette K.,"La Crescenta, CA",159,5,2,4.0,6/24/2016,Good overall food and service; cheesecakes are obviously bomb(though a bit on the sweet side). The cons would have to be long line and large portions. They give too much food so I always end up feeling full at halfway and no matter how yummy I can never finish. Usually it's the three of us sharing two meals but even then we only finish half. I guess this could be a good thing for those who like to eat once a day or something.
Mia L.,"Glendale, CA",0,27,1,5.0,12/2/2015,"Had a wonderful experience. I made a phone order with Albert, and he was extremely efficient. I went on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't busy. The food was absolutely excellent, fresh and delicious. I will be back."
Margo A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,8,6,5.0,1/5/2016,"Great place and very friendly customer service. The food, drinks and cakes are delicious. We received great service from Shy ( who is not shy :) ). She even refilled my tea when I did not expect it. Recommend this place to everyone."
Billy S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",250,2,1,5.0,9/25/2015,Five Stars to Daniel the Manager and Jennifer our waitress excellent service.  Our appetizers came out a bit late understandable. They came over apologized and really demonstrate d superior customer service.  I love this location..
Evelyn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",368,289,566,5.0,1/11/2013,"I loveee Cheesecake Factory and the Glendale location is one of my favorites, I love the Americana.  I finally tried Evelyn's favorite pasta, I had never tried any vegetarian or vegan dishes there and I loved it. It has brocoli, grilled eggplant, artichokes, roasted tomatoes and garlic. It comes with kalamata olives but I don't like olives so I asked for them to take them off and put mushrooms instead.  I also wanted to say how wonderful the staff is, I forgot my phone after dining there and did not notice until I was in the parking lot. I returned around 30 minutes later, gave them a description of my cheap phone and the manager looked for it and found it for me!! Great restaurant, great food and great people who deliver exceptional service. There are restaurants that I want to try at the Americana and I always end up on Cheesecake Factory, now I know why."
Ferre P.,"Glendale, CA",6,31,,4.0,8/31/2014,"I enjoy going to this Cheesecake Factory because it's spacious and has a lot of parking choices near by. My favorite dishes is the chicken Cesar salad, chicken piccata, and herd crusted salmon. Cheesecake Factory ales allows me to substitute any side dishes. Waiters are nice and friendly. Cons: this location can be very busy at certain time if the day like lunch and dinner (6pm) so try to avoid those times. Overall, great place to eat especially in trying different types of cheesecakes!"
Andre B.,"Tujunga, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/18/2016,"Went there with my gf on not even a crowded day. Sat at the bar area. Ordered a beer and a wine then 2 small appetizers. 45 min went by still didn't get our drinks nor our appetizers. Finally reminded the waitress and she brought them over like she was doing us a favor. Food came about an hour after ordering. Next obstacle was trying to get the check, we had to go ask another waiter to bring it for us because our waitress was nowhere to be found. I didn't have a good experience."
Tracy T.,"Seattle, WA",0,9,,4.0,12/30/2015,"The fish tacos were to die for as always! I've never been disappointed in this dish! What better way to end the meal than with a nice slice of cheesecake!  Service was alright but due to the massive amount of people, it wasn't the best..."
lisa l.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,67,5,1.0,8/8/2015,"Had relatives visiting from overseas and wanted th to try the food. Friday 730pm went in and was told the wait is 40 mins to one hr by two people one of them was the mngr. At 830 checked in to see how much longer and was rudely told 'I told you 1:40mins'. There is a huge difference when you tell someone 40 mins to one hr vs an hour and forty mins. And I'm not that old to need a hearing aid. So asked the manager to check if there were any possibility of it being sooner with less people since two were babies not needing a seat. She again brushed me off by saying ' if you want to wait now it's two and a half hr wait'. This is a coming from the manager. I'm not sure she understood my question but I just didn't want to deal with it anymore. So we went to Frida and they were attentive and professional. No thanks, will not be returning back to sleezecake factory."
Rachel T.,"La Puente, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/18/2016,I was very disappointed  because this was my first time going and I don't think I want to come back gist my salad was over cheesy and plain then I open up my silverware and it was disgusting it had food and hair on it and I think they should have given us one of our meals for free and the waiting service was horrible

Nana G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,1.0,7/4/2016,"I usually love going here for any type of food, but after yesterday I must say it was so dissapointing. I ordered the club chicken sandwhich i asked for wheat bread. They put it in the rolls you get when you first sit on the table. I dont think my dog would eat it. It was so small and so not worth the $14 i paid for. Also got the chinese chicken salad, it tasted like I was eating fish. Im not sure if its just this location, usually I dont have problems with cheescake."
Suzy T.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,8,5.0,10/10/2015,"I think Cheesecake Factory has to be my all time favorite restaurant. Everything on their menu is so delicious I just wish I can order everything. Their regular dishes are pretty big, I can never finish the whole thing therefore I usually share it with my mom. My favorite dish is their steak Diane- words can't describe how good it is. I also like their fried calamari and avocado roll appetizers. Even their wheat starter bread is so good; regarding cheesecakes, they taste perfect as well. They have a variety selection of all kinds of cheesecakes. Love coming here!!"
sherrie y.,"Alhambra, CA",54,69,32,2.0,6/30/2015,"Lacking good customer service.  I met up with some girlfriends for dinner the other night.   Izeem was our waitor, I felt he was in a rush to get us out because we didn't order alcohol, appetizers, and dessert.  He took away our small plates b4 we finished with our bread and asked if we wanted our food to be wrapped up to go.  My friend and I were still eating and had our forks in our hands when he came and asked.  I just felt we were not welcomed there and he wanted us to leave right away.   The food was good and that's why I gave a second star.  I had to give one star in order to post this review, otherwise it would had been a total of one star for the food because customer service was rude."
Nairi P.,"Glendale, CA",108,26,7,4.0,3/17/2014,"Amazing food, excellent quality, huge portions (always have to take home leftovers), great atmosphere, very friendly staff, offers the most time for parking validation (ask at the front), reasonable prices, always offer fresh-baked bread before meal (white & brown respectively). Only negatives (occur during weekends): - the wait can be ridiculous (up to 1hr) - air can be warm and stuffy - can be incredibly loud (really hard to carry conversation) - dark lighting may not appeal to most (but I like it) Major advice: avoid going during weekends/holidays, otherwise weekdays are perfect"
Carlos P.,"Burbank, CA",18,106,120,3.0,7/8/2014,"This review is based on the plate I ordered. I had for the first time the chicken bellagio and it was good, the only down fall was the pest pasta was a bit too salty on top of that they prosciutto ham on top of the chicken so it can be a bit overwhelming with salt but the service was great and you can never go wrong with the cheesecakes"
Coolit C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",10,82,36,1.0,2/24/2015,"If you want to use your free cheesecake card. Good luck! Why would you give out free cheesecake gift cards if you don't want us to use it. The manager is very inconsiderate.  He needs to be fired. Doesn't deserve to be in a cheesecake factory team. He was on duty Feb 22, 2015 around 730pm...if you ask me fire him. A disgraced person"
Gary S.,"Glendale, CA",56,53,22,5.0,7/21/2015,This is for the service my daughter and I received from David A. He provided excellent service and was extremely attentive. We have been there many times and have received just alright and good service but this time was exceptional. I think everyone knows the food is decent. We have had good food and bad food there before. My tacos were good and my daughters pasta was ok but it's the service that made me stop and write the review. I hope the restaurant  recognizes David's value. He is the reason we will go back again and request him as our waiter. By the way we took home a piece of snickers cheese cake and that was really good but still not as good as the service we received from David A.
Lucy K.,"Fairfield, CA",109,36,46,4.0,8/9/2015,"IT WAS SUPER YUMMY!!!!!!! The portions are huge you can easily share a plate!!!!  What I did not like was how dark it was, I could barely see me amazing food."
