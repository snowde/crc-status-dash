Magali P.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",15,60,14,1.0,2/11/2015,"This restaurant does not even deserve a star rating. I don't even know where to begin with this train wreck of an experience.  First off the waiter could he be any more clueless?! He had to come back twice to keep asking how we wanted our margaritas. Secondly they came after my appetizer. Already irritated!! Where is my food? Who knows while individuals who came after us are already eating. I had to ask a different server to please check on our food, a couple minutes later they brought it out.  But where is our server? Who knows.  He brings the check which came out to $63.  I hand him $65 and my validation ticket. The nerve of this guy he comes back with only my validation ticket. How does he take it upon himself to keep my change. Never in my lifetime has something like this ever happened!!! What if I was going to tip him more? Or nothing at all.  I ask to speak with the manager who's a complete idiot. I tell him the situation and all he does is agree and apologize. Like go fucken bring me my whole tab you fucken idiot. It's not even about the change obviously, it's the principle!i ask for my receipt and this human being comes back with ONLY THE RECEIPT I ask where's my change his fucken reply OH IM SORRY I THOUGHT YOU ONLY WANTED THE RECEIPT. And to top it off the food rating is a B. Fuck you Cheesecake Factory. NEVER COMING BACK HERE. EVER."
Shadi S.,"Tujunga, CA",1,5,,5.0,5/29/2015,Everything is awesome! I really liked the foods & the employees were so friendly! I enjoy spending time there.
Wiiload K.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",38,78,103,1.0,8/27/2015,I found a hair in egg plant Parmesan the manager approached me about it and I told him the situation and he offered me another batch of pasta and I said no but he didn't take it off my bill if some like this happens you compensate the customer this is very wrong a big company like cheese cake factory
Fhria G.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,15,76,5.0,7/15/2015,"This my go to place on my day offs. The service is way beyond exceptional. The best Cheesecake factory I've been. The best Service, Food, Ambiance and Crowd. Good for all crowds.. kids, family, friends and couples. All week or day its always full. Weekends or weekdays. Brunch or Dinner. And ample if parking. The location is just great.. right in the heart of Glendale. Love this place. My favorite here is Calamari, Jambalaya pasta, Redvelvet and Tiramisu cheesecake.. Plus there coffee is so good.."
Valerie C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,5,13,3.0,4/18/2015,"A BIG FAT 3 THREE! Only because our server was amazing. Other than that I would have given it a 1 Start rating because I have a few complaints... This was my very first time at a Cheesecake Factory. I though what better place to have my first time be somewhere I've never been, The Americana. It was a Friday night so I was expecting a long wait time which by the way was supposed to be ""55 minutes"" that turned into 80! Finally we take our seat after 1.5 hours of waiting, yay!! Upon being seated we encounter Complaint Number 1: The table was sticky and clearly had someones meal still smeared on it. Luckily a busboy was near by and cleaned it right away. After meeting our server receiving our drinks and bread basket we encounter Complaint Number 2: We notice that one of us had some dirty silverware and asked to get it changed. After a rough start we receive some delicious food. Filling and very satisfying. After a great meal we head for a diaper change for Baby T. This is when we encounter Complaint Number 3: This restroom definitely set the bar. 4 small stalls and 1 big stall that has the changing table. World smallest restroom for such a big restaurant. No one is paying any attention to the restrooms at all because a teenage boy walked in to use the restroom with no problem. Not ok! The changing table had no liners as well as no way to safely retain my child to it either. The trash in the big stall and the paper towel wastebaskets were overflowing. There wasn't even any toilet paper the the big stall. The was hardly any soap the floors were filthy. We had the Lemon Merengue Cheesecake which was amazing and I highly recommend it if you love the sweet and tart taste."
Alison C.,"South Pasadena, CA",6,75,,4.0,4/12/2015,"Just had our baby's party here.  We had 50 people, which they put us in the larger patio next to sprinkles.  I already picked out the food and they had it ready to go and right away.  We had two slight issues, the food was all coming out at the same time--which is difficult when people are eating family style. You run out of space.  And there was a small mix up of chicken Marsala vs pasta da Vinci (I ordered the latter for the party).  But both issues were resolved so well.  The manager was really great and he made sure to have a ton of waiters on hand for us.  I let the partygoers order their own cheesecakes at the end, the servers didn't give that many menus for people to look over, but overall the party was a success.  They can only host from 11-1 for a party this big, but if you ever needed a venue you could totally consider this.   The patio was great because kids could also run to the fountain and hang out for a bit  as well.  And just FYI, we ordered our favorites.  Pasta da Vinci, Santa Fe salad, Thai lettuce wraps, and bang bang chicken and shrimp.  All were made well and crowd pleasers."
Dannerz R.,"Azusa, CA",632,1,,1.0,9/17/2015,"Dinner was fine, service was fine. But when my brother spits a dead fly out of his mouth after taking a drink from his beer all the manager offered to do was take the beer off the bill. Nothing more was offered. Most places with high standards of customer service would normally offer some type of gesture of compensation.  When I worked at in n out if a fly was found in the food we comped the entire meal. I'm not asking for a comped meal but how about a scoop of ice cream?"
Leslie H.,"Sylmar, Los Angeles, CA",18,31,11,5.0,7/26/2015,"I was here yesterday, so good! I recommend the lemon herb roasted chicken, I always ask for extra sauce on the side. If you love that lemony flavor, this dish is definitely for you! And also had the lemon meringue cheesecake, amazing!"
Brian S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,2,1.0,8/17/2015,"This is the second time I have tried this restaurant, the first time was not a good experience, and I figured I'd give them another try because my family wanted to eat here. Once again It was a disappointing experience. I have eaten at many Cheesecakes before and by far this location at the Americana is the worst. The waitress had a pleasant personality, however our food took a long time to come out, and when it did, it looked as though it had sat under the food warmer for at least 8 to ten minutes. My pasta was gummy and dry, with the sauce sucked out, and my guests potatoes on her breakfast dish were very dried out. The last persons dish was the best out of the 3, but the tacos were overly crisp and the meat looked dried out. We didn't have time to exchange things out because we were headed to a concert and couldn't wait. After reading many other reviews on this locations yelp page, I would hope that the management would take a more active role in the kitchen and dining room. Many things in the restaurant industry are forgivable ie, screaming kids (parents fault not the restaurants), Long wait (Welcome to Los Angeles deal with it, part of living here), Parking (Also part of just living in LA).  Now the ones that just can't happen if you want repeat customers is inattentive waitresses, overcooked or cold food, poor organizational skills, and constant mistakes. It's really not that hard for a customer like me. I am understanding, as I have worked in the food industry for 8 years, but this location seems to just flat out not care about a guests dining experience. I hope management reads this, because I only write this to help them know whats going on in their restaurant."
Bobby C.,"Los Angeles, CA",379,1502,703,2.0,10/1/2012,"Love the Cheesecake factory. It's just a bummer the way they do substitutions. Asked if substituting veggies in pastas is tough. Waitress replied ""It's no problem at all."" Fast forward to the check. A pasta with asparagus mushrooms and tomato has been upped from $14 to $20... wow. Thanks waitress. Just came out of her tip though. When we asked her she said ""my manager made me do it."" FYI next time that happens tell your customer he's about to pay more than your streak price for some noodles and vegtables."
Laurice F.,"Los Angeles, CA",362,742,109,4.0,3/23/2012,"I go to Cheesecake Factory once in a blue moon. It's just not my style. It's a major chain that's always packed and with an absurdly large menu. With that being said, we did end up dining here last night to use up a gift card. We waited about 10mins or so before being escorted to our table. It's a huge place - my husband said it best regarding the decoration: ""It's opulent but without being classy."" So true! It's almost Vegas level, but even Vegas seems a little more unique. We were taken care of by our friendly - probably a model on the side - waitress. We started with a MARGARITA and RED SANGRIA which were both really good. The sangria was mine and I enjoyed the hint of cinnamon in each sip. We started our meal off with SWEET CORN FRITTERS. These came from the Small Plates & Snacks section and I was surprised to receive 6 decent sized fritters that came with a nice spicy aioli. Quoting my husband again (who btw has his own yelp account - hmph!): ""These fritters would make a smaller restaurant famous!"" So true again! Crispy, savory and sweet. Excuse the drool. Onto the entrees. Husband ordered the CHICKEN BELLAGIO - well-portioned and flavorful (especially the basil pasta). I had the GRILLED SHRIMP & BACON CLUB - along with shredded lettuce and a cream sauce, the grilled shrimp and bacon were great, though I was intimidated by the size of this sandwich since they stick another slice of toast in between the 2 proteins! It was a bit much, but still good. We were stuffed but decided to take home a couple of cheesecake slices - I got CLASSIC KEY LIME and he got the HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE BAR (0.25cents is donated to Feeding America). My key lime was yummy, but a little on the too-tart side. The Hershey's was just pure decadence. Both were impossible to eat in one sitting. So though we wouldn't usually frequent a place like CF, we didn't have a bad time."
Selena A.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,16,2,1.0,8/12/2015,"I wish I could give negative ratings. My biggest regret about going to this particular location is that I got FOOD POISONING from the four cheese pasta with added chicken. FOOD POISONING! I just went there a few hours ago and I haven't been able to leave my restroom. Now let's talk about their ladies restroom. There were 6 stalls 1 out of order 3 so dirty with used tissue all over the floor and the big stall literally has PISS on the floor. There was only one semi-clean stall to use. You can hear the staff chit chatting through out your entire meal. 3 staff members were standing maybe 8 feet away from my table talking about their car problems, bad mouthing their boss for being late, 2 guys hit on a female employee. I'm upset I had to pay for my meal. Not returning."
Leanne A.,"Placentia, CA",0,10,,4.0,5/10/2015,"Horrible long wait. Can't believe they would not take reservations on mother's day. We were told hour and ten Minute wait and it was an hour and forty minutes. But once we sat down for our meal, the waiter was great and our food was perfect."
Darcy W.,"North Hollywood, CA",7,15,,2.0,9/10/2015,"Came here for lunch on the recommendation of a co-worker. Had a salad large portion, but was not organic, it was just okay nothing special..Bread was good. I did not like the fact that the silverware is just laying on the table instead of the napkin...gross..How do you know the table is clean????? I asked for a new fork. When I asked for a to go box the waitress gave me a bag and put it in the box, again how do I know the bag is clean? and I am supposed to eat food from a tainted box???I just threw out my leftovers when we got back to the office. Very unsanitary practices for a restaurant, I expected better, won't be back."
Rose K.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,36,244,5.0,2/17/2014,Delicious food... Extremely friendly waiters/waitresses... Chill enviornment... Love the outdoor seating area.. Patrick is the best :)
Kari C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/16/2016,I love this place! The four cheese pasta is the best I get it every time. Let's not get started on their cheesecake they are delicious.
Clariza P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,5/27/2016,The customer service at this place is awesome. Came here for my boyfriends birthday dinner. Our waitress was Jessica. She was super friendly and welcoming. We did have an issue with our food order. I had order ordered an everything pizza and when I finally got it and was burnt all over. When we complained to the waitress; without hesitation she apologizes and takes the pizza back. A few minutes the manager Bryan  comes comes to our table and apologizes himself about the pizza. He then tells he himself is paying for my dinner and I get a brand new pizza. I was in impress with the customer services
Megan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/15/2015,"Drinks, food and service are all good. Visited this location in a crazy Saturday evening (line was super long..like those black friday sales line). Waited for a pasta for over 30 mins I guess.. Manager came to me and said kitchen has to remake it so pasta is on them.  Ohh it sounds good to me and then I ordered another drink.  Food came out.. it tastes good but still a little bit different from it used to be. But my overall experience here is good."
DJ R.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,80,166,2.0,5/9/2014,"Usually I love this place but tonight was just horrible. Food was fine but the waiter's  (Izeem) service skills were terrible. I would understand if it was a busy hour but it was slow. I had to flag him down to get service, he didn't seem to want to serve us and when he came to give me the check he stood over my shoulder to see if I was going to tip. Usually I do but I wrote on the receipt, ""service was unacceptable!"" Right in front of him. This shouldn't reflect how great the Cheesecake Factory is most of the time but this is something that made me not want to go back"
Zhi Hong Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,42,25,3.0,3/9/2015,"I really enjoy the atmosphere.I tried the chicken alfredo, greek salad, and the calabrian pizza. The food was delicious. The only reason i would give this place three stars is because of the service. My waiter threw the napkins on my table and accidentally spilled water on me. He didn't even say sorry, he just said ""Thank god you're wearing shorts."""
