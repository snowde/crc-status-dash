Julie M.,"Burbank, CA",4,78,453,2.0,7/25/2015,"Good time. Sat on the patio for dinner. When the sun went down it was a bit cool so we asked when the heaters would be turned on.  The waiter said it was by request. My daughter was getting cold so I asked to turn them on. They looked like I was asking for the moon and made a big show of trying to get the heater started, moving umbrellas, etc. 30 minutes later, numerous requests, and still no heater on. We received our bill and left."
Maureen C.,"Fairfield, CA",176,405,541,4.0,3/6/2012,"Al though this is a chain restaurant, I give this particular one a 4.  It makes a difference how you're treated when you come in and I appreciated how our hostess and waiter  treated my sister and I.  First of all we were starving after hanging out at the mall and we didn't care if we sat inside or out.   Luckily we sat outside because we had a chance to see The Americana, which was really nice at night.  We also had a chance to look out at the fountain that had opera music playing along with it.   For the most part the food was quick and so was the service.  The waiter was efficient and gave us ETAs on when our food would come out.  Overall it was a nice and pleasant place to eat at. I ordered my chicken farfalle and my sister got her jambalaya.  There wasn't any variation from the flavor I'm used to and I didn't get food poisoning so that was a plus."
Divya G.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,189,26,3.0,2/26/2015,"This restaurant really isn't bad, I just was not extremely impressed by it. It's a really large space and if you come at the right moments the wait time for a table isn't longer than 10 minutes. The menu is super humongous so it's ridiculously difficult to decide what to order. I ended up ordering Pasta with Chicken and Scampi Sauce. It took a while to arrive at our table (about 30 minutes or so). The pasta and sauce were so heavy, but delicious. They went crazy with the chicken and the garnish though. There were so many pieces of chicken that I started thinking that I ordered Chicken with Pasta and Scampi sauce instead. Normally I wouldn't mind such a generous helping for the price paid, but the chicken was weird and bumpy looking on the outside (as if it still had skin on), not sure why. The herb garnish was so thick that it started to get in the way of the pasta at one point. Of course I had no room for dessert after that large plate of pasta--I couldn't even finish it!  The service here was alright. My friend and I split the bill--I paid part of it with card and she paid her portion with cash. The server made the mistake of assuming that my friend's change is his tip so he kept it and just brought back the receipt. I mean, there wasn't much change so it probably would have all been his tip, but assuming that right off the bat and keeping it is kind of annoying. He should have waited until she left the tip at the end instead.  Not a bad place for dinner once in a while, but the service and overindulgent portions of heavy food will probably keep me away from here for a while."
Rachel V.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,24,8,1.0,3/1/2015,"If I could give this Cheesecake Factory a negative star, I would. At first my visit seemed like a normal one, I go to the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena occasionally and enjoy it. I ordered my normal small plates, I really enjoy the small plates menu because then I can try a bunch of different things. So I ordered chicken samosas, crispy crab bites, and loaded potato bites to share with my mother. They were tasty as usual but we had small appetites so we decide to take some things home with us. We had a few crab bites left and the great majority of a LARGE plate of loaded potato bites left over. I thought ""Oh great I'll have an entire meal for later."" The server offered to take the food and wrap it up for us, I replied yes and several minutes later he arrived with our take-home container.  The next day while at home I took the container out of the refrigerator, eyes filled with glee, excited about my lovely loaded potato bites waiting for me. This is where things took a turn. When I opened the container my heart dropped and my stomach growled. There were only 4 potato bites inside the container. I HAD AN ENTIRE PLATE LEFTOVER, I had been cheated. The server had taken my food to the back and either dropped it, eaten it, or just plain threw it out. I DO NOT enjoy paying for things I will never get to eat. TOTALLY CHEATED. I won't ever be going to this Cheesecake Factory EVER again unless I am compensated for my lost Loaded Potato Bites. Thanks for NOTHING."
A R.,"Honolulu, HI",0,12,7,1.0,8/15/2015,"The worst management and overall team. Hostess' stated ""an hour wait"" which is understandable given it was a Friday night. They ask for your mobile number so they could ""text you when your table is ready"". Well... hostess Jacqueline is very incompetent. It doesn't take rocket science to take a phone number. Had to give it to her twice because she got it wrong the first time (despite me speaking aloud). I returned to the restaurant 2 hours later (after having eaten elsewhere - because the wait was ridiculous) and still ... no text. I spoke with the manager who also is unqualified to be a ""manager"". She offered to seat me [after 2 hours of waiting].  Seriously?! Oh and the best part...she comps me a free slice of cheesecake! Cheesecake factory management and staff at Americana needs major overhaul. Do not dine there."
Lin B.,"Studio City, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/26/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory so much. I go here every week. There are so many options and great service and great locations. My experience has always been amazing. I would give it 5 stars but unfortunately they took away from the menu my favorite dish, the Linguarian Pesto Pasta. Bring back PESTO PASTA!!! If they do I will give this place 5 stars."
Todd N.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,583,496,3.0,8/1/2012,"This review is a little overdue, but I'm finally writing this now! I don't have too much to say about this place because it's really no different from the other locations I've been to.  The service, food, and service (from my experience) has been pretty much on point with the other and haven't had a horrible experience yet. My table wasn't up for a large meal, so we just opted for the appetizers and small plates.  This is definitely the way to go if you're not in the mood to eat a lot nor drop $20 for an entrée.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare, and it was delicious; however, they put way too much ginger in it, that it was more that than tuna.  I would ask they be more generous with the tuna, since you are paying for it and should get the most out of it."
Jasmine S.,"San Jose, CA",7,11,41,3.0,8/13/2014,"For starters, the location of this restaurant is so convenient. Located at The Americana in Glendale California, it is a perfect place for a nice dinner and lunch. The service was exceptional and the food turned out great. I usually sit inside but this time I decided to sit on the patio. The only thing that bothered me was the flies. Although it was outside I do feel there are things  that can be done to help avoid the amount of flies around the food."
Eran Z.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",8,33,8,1.0,6/21/2015,Not the best service I much prefer the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman oaks service. I had a very bad service experience here at the amircana Glendale
Joshua O.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",13,38,19,5.0,9/14/2014,Over all wait for 30 min it's worth it. Friendly staff and good food. I will recommend cheese cake to all hungry yelpers.
David R.,"Norco, CA",0,29,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Like some other establishments, CF will bring you a marguerita that has virtually no tequila in it, in the hope that you will order more drinks to make up for the lack. This is what they did yesterday and I complained to the waitress. I asked her to bring some tequila that I could pour into the drink, explaining to her that the drink was weak. Then she charges me extra for the tequila. I objected, and she sends the manager over who then argued with me. What an unclassy place."
Malena G.,"Glendale, CA",1,10,1,3.0,9/9/2015,Came here a couple of times and sat at the bar. service is great and food is enjoyable.!
Stephanie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,53,7,1.0,11/16/2013,"The service here is horrible. The host tried seating us at a couple of tables that were not set up. The server took a long time to greet us and to bring our check.  The food also was not good at this location. The bread and entrees took awhile to come out, were not fresh and didn't even come out that hot."
Alodie D.,"Riverside, CA",38,53,131,5.0,8/26/2012,"One spontaneous trip to Americana, me and my companions couldn't figure out what to eat for lunch. I finally just said to eat here and I don't regret it!  First of all this place is gorgeous! Of course its Americana-Glendale and not Riverside.  Second of all, the food was really good! I'm glad I gave a chance to try the ""Macaroni Cheese Burger!"" I'd rather get it than the ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"" appetizer. Plus the fries were just...perfection!  Lastly, the customer service given to our group was just...GOLD (like what my cousin said). Our waiter Scott was on top of things always refilling our drinks, checking up on us while we ate, and just being an awesome human being. I'm honestly speechless with this visit we had. I don't go to Americana every week but whenever I go back and eat here I hope to get him or request him.  So thank you Scott for your excellent service to us and for Cheesecake Factory inventing the Macaroni Cheese Burger! :D"
Doris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,32,17,4.0,5/23/2015,The hostess are not friendly they make it seem like the wait is a drag. the waiter was nice but food took forever to come out. But it when it did it was delicious.
Mayra G.,"Sylmar, CA",2,50,27,2.0,7/4/2015,"I really hate leaving two stars for restaurants. But came here to have lunch with my mom the waiter was rude with my mom so we moved to another section still our wait staff was indifferent I think it was the end of their shift so we got tired and bored employees ready to leave and had, had their fill of work! So stay away from coming around 4:00 pm you'll get grumpy tired staff.! The food was overlooked and cold when we got it. Overall not s good experience after expending over 80.00 for two"
Tony Y. Jr. Y.,"Glendale, CA",63,490,1443,4.0,9/15/2011,"I hope I don't sound cheesy saying I like the Cheesecake Factory.  This was my favorite restaurants years ago.  Though they have good food, and give gigantic portions of it, I've learned to discipline myself in terms of food intake.  Guilty pleasures can get the best of us and, thank God, I haven't been guilty in a long time until recently.  My good buddy Miguel V, who is also a Yelper, and I decided to dine at the Cheesecake Factory, as we were both hungry and knew this place would satisfy our hunger. This location in Glendale always seems to be crowded.  To our surprise, we were seated in less than 30 minutes.  The vibe in this restaurant is mostly young and fun.  However, it's hard to have fun on an empty stomach, so we started to place our orders immediately.  Miguel started by ordering a Stone IPA (Indian Pale Ale), which is a drink I'd never heard of.  I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade.  In terms of food, Miguel opted for the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, which consists of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic in a spicy cajun broth with steamed rice in the center.  All I can say is the food looked delicious when I saw it brought to the table, as it was totally devoured shortly after being placed on the table.  As for my order, I opted for the Spicy Cashew Chicken, which is spicy fried chicken with green onions and roasted cashews that's served on a bed of rice.  The spicy flavor of the chicken was guiltily pleasing to my palate, as it's been over a year since I've had this dish.  Our meals were satisfying, plentiful, and affordable, as each dish was less than $20. All in all, everyone can find something satisfying on the menu at the Cheesecake Factory.  Our server was friendly, the service was good and, again, the food was good.  Given the big portions of food, we couldn't fathom the idea of getting dessert.  The desserts alone can easily be a meal, as they're served in big portions too!  We enjoyed our visit to this Cheesecake Factory!    *3.5 Stars"
Justin W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",357,7,18,4.0,7/30/2014,Great experience before and looking forward to yet another amazing dinner and date night...
E V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/28/2016,Strawberry Cheesecake with less than 4 half slices of strawberries on it. I thought it was strawberry season.   Also very light on the strawberry glaze.  Didn't get my money's worth and definitely not worth the wait.  Also got our order wrong. I think employees are over worked and dropping the ball.
Natalie H.,"Glendale, CA",26,36,9,3.0,2/10/2015,"Mixed feelings towards Cheesecake Factory. I don't think I have ever walked in and been seated right away. It seems as though there is usually a 40 minute wait and I would much rather dine somewhere else when I'm hungry and don't want to wait. I don't get why they don't take reservations? Anyways, regardless of their long wait, everything else is pretty good. The waiters always inform me on new items on the menu and are super friendly. I have tried many items on the menu and my favorite appetizer has to be the avocado egg rolls and my favorite entree is the Louisiana Pasta. Would recommend this place if you don't mind waiting."
