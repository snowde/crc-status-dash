Jadira R.,"Las Vegas, NV",327,425,2079,4.0,1/12/2012,"I came here in a group of 20 on a Sunday afternoon and we were very well accommodated. They sat us in a booth area with two side by side long tables. The only problem was that half of our group was running on Filipino time, so they were an hour late, but we didn't bother waiting because that always happens, so we just ordered all our food and appetizers. We got Thai lettuce wraps and calamari as appetizers. I split grilled salmon with my sister and my mom had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and roasted tomatoes.  The Calamari came with Garlic Dip & Cocktail Sauce. The Calamari itself was crunchy and perfectly cooked. I really don't like getting cocktail sauce with Calamari, so I stuck with the garlic dip. The lettuce wraps were very large and came with strips of chicken satay. I kind of wish the chicken would be more chopped up though. It'd just make it easier for the lettuce wraps and make it so you can have more servings. They were very good though. It came with a lot of toppings which were all very fresh. The Grilled Salmon was delicious! It was a big portion and more than enough to split between me and my sister ( ). We ordered mashed potatoes and green beans for our sides, but they have lots of other ones to choose from. Everything was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. It's definitely one of my favorite dishes here now."
Sam C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/29/2015,"I've been to this place at least 10 times, and I never know what to get/what I'll like. The place seats large parties, which makes it convenient to go to, but I've never had an amazing experience while there. I've tried various things on the menu, and there has been nothing I've loved. The food is average and is definitely not worth the price you pay, it is absolutely overpriced. Customer service is meh, it honestly depends on the waiter/tress you get. Sometimes they're extremely friendly and helpful, other times, well... All in all, this place is OK, could do a lot better."
Anita C.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,34,5,1.0,10/30/2013,"My one star reflects the poor service our party of four received tonight. When our food was served, the server spilled the sauce from the pasta dish on my mother! Sauce went dribbling down her sleeve, pants and arm. The server apologized but did little more than wipe the table. The sauce was not on the table, it ended up on my mother! The server did tell our waitress what happened. At the end of the meal and after I paid the bill, we mentioned to the waitress that the server spilled on my mother and should her the stains on her sweater and pants. She claims she didn't know about it! Liar! Fess up and admit wrong doing. She did offer a slice of cheesecake to go but we declined. We just wanted to get out of there! And on top of all this, we didn't get one dish comped for this sloppy error. I will be sending a formal complaint email to the general manager to ask for a comped meal and some cash to cover a dry cleaning bill."
R N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,216,60,3.0,8/25/2015,"This review is for the carrot cake, which was unexpectedly dry. The peanut butter cake, however, was fabulous! Decadent, but delicious. Totally worth the calories :)  Ultimate red velvet - too much plain cheesecake, red velvet layer was very thin."
Josh L.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",80,17,2,1.0,5/29/2014,"Food is fantastic but service is straight lousy. Every single time we've gone there my fiancé and I have had to wait 20 mins, plus just for drinks. I'm not talking popular nights like Saturday, and Fridays.  I'm talking Wednesday's at 7pm.  But the service I had on May 28th has made the Cheesecake Factory OFF any potential restaurant list period.  I asked for lettuce and tomato to be removed from my burger and the waitress gave me attitude I've never experienced. As if my request was truly ruining her day. Reb argued with me in how the burger was gonna be... Huh? I thought I was in the Twilight Zone, my fiancé even took note of it. So, for atleast a year, I will not step foot in this Cheesecake Factory. Maybe great to go, but no way will I ever done in there for a while. Never have I had such an aggressive and RUDE waitress. Maybe she was just having a bad day so I won't say the name she gave as it's pretty distinctive.  But wow."
Alisha Angelina Belladonna L.,"Glendale, CA",122,14,3,1.0,4/20/2015,"Today is my birthday and not only did they forget my fiancé meal, but our waiter hardly provided a service. Later, some guy in a tie asked us about our experience and we explained our situation the lack of effort to have us leave as happy customer was his last priority."
Marlyn S.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,2,2.0,8/14/2014,"I placed my order over the phone and the  person that I spoke with, her name was Alicia was very rude. She was very condescending. Being in a service industry, I expected more customer service from her. This is The Cheesecake Factory and not some small restaurant.  I love their food, it's just this person that made my experience with the restaurant regretful."
Ashley D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",605,118,100,5.0,4/8/2014,Came here for a quick lunch and my boyfriend and I shared this amazing sun dried tomato fettucine alfredo. It was to die for! We also ordered the J.W. Lemonade and it was so delicious. All of their drinks are amazing!
Maximus Decimus Meridius M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",12,92,1,1.0,9/17/2013,"sorry i hate to slam a chain restaurant and i realize the futility of reviewing a corporate chain but we took grandpa here for a birthday dinner and the service was so appalling that i'm forced to yelp. I give this place my coveted BYOW rating (Bring Your Own Waiter). there were 8 of us, which put us into the automatic 20% gratuity charge so the waiter completely ignored us for an hour and 45 minutes because he knows no matter what he does he's going to get his 20% so what's the point of doing his job??  bad policy, bad restaurant.  We sat down at 5:15 pm ordered drinks at 5:17pm. at 5:30 another party of 8 people were seated near us.  They ordered their drinks. 5:35pm the table next to us received their drinks. no sign of our waiter anywhere. at about 5:40 pm i flag down a host to ask him to look for our waiter.  right as i finish talking to the host i spot our waiter walking towards us with our drinks. i had ordered a hefeweizen without a garnish and a water and the birthday grandpa had ordered a coke with no ice.  I can't comment on the other orders because i don't know what they were. i received a hefeweizen with a garnish and no water.  the birthday boy received a coke with ice. happy birthday. about 15 minutes after that 4 of the dinner orders arrived.  but the other 4 including the birthday boy's dinner and my dinner didn't arrive for another 20 minutes. i am not exaggerating.   this really happened.   this place is a train wreck.   get your cheesecake to go folks.   Dine at your own risk."
Loida M.,"Burbank, CA",11,9,,4.0,8/8/2014,"Would of been a 5 star review but I gave it a 4 just because of the extremely long wait time. You would think they would build this place bigger. On the other hand the food is always cooked perfectly and the portions are huge. They have a lunch menu, which is smaller portions. OHH and their bread is so delicious. I think they make it in house."
Gary W.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/15/2014,"This is the ultimate restaurant.  I know you're not supposed to say that because it's a chain. But everything they make is delicious and the menu items are vast. It boggles my mind that it all tastes good. You can never go wrong with the cheesecake factory. the cocktails are delicious, the appetizers are amazing and the entrees are as good as it gets! And of course the cheesecake is out of this world. But for me, the dessert takes a back seat to all the other great things going on here.  I'll confess to eating here at least once a month. And lately, I believe I have the belt line to prove it. Looks like I'd better get in some extra golf sessions to burn off those calories! Great job Cheesecake Factory!"
Kevin B.,"Signal Hill, CA",211,855,4993,4.0,7/25/2011,"Saturday a friend was heading to Glendale on a shopping quest and bribed me to go by offering to buy lunch.  Free food?   Sure, where's my seatbelt?     So we schlep up to Glendale, hit the store and only find half of what he was looking for.   Now with a partial quest in the can, we hit Cheesecake Factory for some grub.   It was a beautiful day so the outdoor seating was calling to us and who am I to argue?   THE FOOD:  I order the soup of the day, a cream of chicken that is surprisingly very good.   Great flavor, nice diced veggies, chicken, etc.    I also order the Cobb Salad and I have say the salad was VERY good!   My friend had the same soup and the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp.   He let me have some and... I would definitely order this, it was very good!   As much as I normally pursue cheesecake, I usually bypass it here.   They do have good cheesecake, but just give me the normal, plain cheesecake thank you.   You can keep all your cookie chunks, coffee or fruity swirls and 17 other flavors in the first bite.   THE SERVICE:  We were seated pretty quickly and our server was very friendly and an absolute hoot!   However she didn't come by often enough as I had to ask another server for a beverage refill. Yes Cheesecake Factory is a big nation wide chain.   I've been to a handful of other locations and have enjoyed the food and rarely have complaints.   For some reason this one seemed to be a notch above the others... or maybe it's just me."
Mark C.,"Simi Valley, CA",50,15,345,5.0,4/3/2014,"We popped in here late evening, so it wasn't bad on a week night! The other restaurant we were going to had closed down & this was in the area!  Noise level was ok for a business meeting, service was great! Our attentive server was Grant H, kept refilling our coffees & iced teas. Very helpful in offering options on menu. Tried Roasted beets w/Goat Cheese, Asian Lettuce Wraps, Salmon & Chicken Madeira Combination. All were very tasty! Looking forward to another visit soon!"
Samantha M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,9,1,1.0,6/30/2015,"Worst Cheesecake Factory location I've been to. I made the mistake of bringing my nephew to celebrate his birthday here. Long wait, bad and superficial service. I asked for a birthday candle twice no one bothered to follow up . I asked for a table outside I been told the patio is closing , very disappointing to see after our dinner that they were still seating people outside.I expressed my disappointment to Lawrence the manager and he mentioned ""he 'll make it up to us next time... Really?! The birthday was already ruined, it will never be a next time!!"
Emily K.,"Alhambra, CA",147,166,172,5.0,4/1/2015,"I love sitting in the patio area, such a great location.  I always get their Bite-Sized Little Crab Cakes Served with Mustard Sauce, Avocado eggrolls and their Caesar salad."
Francine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1577,1657,3140,2.0,7/18/2011,Wow I can't believe the service I had gotten at this Cheesecake Factory !!! I really like The Americana and I always come here to just walk around and do a little bit of browsing. The other day I was feeling like eating Cheesecake Factory since I haven't step foot into one in a long long time after many horrible experiences.  I don't know why or how it goes about but I always always end up with a kid that just started training! This guy needed a lot of help and his fellow staff members didn't help him one bit.  We were sitting for refills on drink forever and even ordering took forever. He already had three tables and seemed like it was too much to handle. People are demanding yes and people want things fast especially for lunch time.  Our Waiter was nice and sweet but I think if he is still new that they should also get help from another member of the staff. So things will run more smoothly.  I ordered a lunch portion meal which was huge and I ended up not finishing half of it. But the food was alright I  think it just was killed by the lack of service and attention to us.  I think I can live without coming to another Cheesecake for awhile.
Nathan C.,"San Francisco, CA",560,42,2,3.0,12/28/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory did have some good food, but it was definitely not delicious enough that I would wait for about an hour with my friends to eat lunch at. Granted, it was great that Americana had other stores that I could shop at while waiting, but when you are in a state of immense hunger, this doesn't satisfy. I don't remember the pasta dish I ordered, but it was spicy and had chicken (I think it was Louisiana Chicken Pasta?). The dish was pretty good, but again, it took quite a bit of time for the food to come out. My friends ordered other pasta dishes and theirs looked good as well. The food is quite heavy like other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, so ordering the minimum is a good idea. The Avocado Rolls are quite delicious and I would recommend these for appetizers. Overall: delicious pasta and avocado roll, LONG wait, decent service"
Raul H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,28,1,2.0,4/3/2016,"The quality of the service, the food, the vibe and the neatess is unsatisfactory in comparison to other visits to other branches with way much better experience. Very disappointing"
Dennis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,41,4,5.0,5/1/2015,"Is there an option to give 6 stars?!? I can probably eat here everyday because of the wide variety of food entrées in their menu. I pretty much get the same thing all the time tho. Have you tried the Sunday brunch?!? Amazing!!!! I look forward to it every Sunday. Great service as well. You can call this place commercial, but whatever they are doing,  they are doing it right!"
Meg S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,1,1.0,7/24/2015,Longest wait ever! The dumb waitress forgot about my party had to wait longer! If you want Cheesecake Factory don't go to the Glendale one!
