Joshua K.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",13,159,44,5.0,3/17/2014,Popped in super late the other night.  Although we were right before last call the bartenders were very nice.   We didn't get treated any differently.  I believe they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and I really appreciate that.  You guys have a good thing going with good staff. Thank you!! Drinks were great along with the cheesecake;)
Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",504,559,1042,5.0,3/27/2012,"I LOVE! the Cheeeeeseecakeee factory :) I got the Crispy Chicken Costoletta! You have to try it out! Dang, I want some now. This place, like every other cheesecake factory, is CUTE! Always busy, but that's good! The servers always take care of us when we come, our food always comes out on time! Not to mention, I love the bread:) It is so yummy! Especially when it comes out hot!"
André N.,"Stockholm, Sweden",2,30,,3.0,10/29/2013,I really hate to only give this place three stars. im in LA for a longer visit and have been to 2 other cheesecake factory's and had a really good experience at these.  At this place they told us there was a 40minutes waiting time but after 50minutes nothing happened so i asked them how long time we had left. They apologized and told us that we would be seated in 5min.. After 10 minutes they called us on the beeper thing and told us our table was being prepared .. 10 minutes later we got to our table. The food was not as good as it usually is which after an hour of waiting was disappointing.  But as always the cheesecake was great! i tried the kahlua and my gf tried the key lime.

Tom G.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",8,29,2,5.0,7/11/2014,"We went to cheesecake factory because Outback was closed. I wanted to good steak and I found one! I thought Outback was the spot for steak but I was mistaken. The wait was about 7 minutes long and we got a nice booth seat. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and I have to admit it was probably one of the best strawberry lemonades I've ever had. They put a ring of sugar around the glass and fill it up to the top with fresh tasting lemonade.  I ordered a ribeye steak cooked medium and it came with an order of fries. Usually I have to ask the server if I can substitute for fries but I was delighted to see that it was already included in my meal.    My steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were kind of cold but they reminded me of room service which was really good. The server was great, she kept filling up my strawberry lemonade to the top. I think I had about three or four total. For dessert I had an epic tasting strawberry cheesecake topped with real strawberries and whipped cream. I could barely finish the cheesecake but me being me I had to push myself to it and I ate every single bite! This is probably the best cheesecake factory I have been to in my life. Makes up for all the bad cheesecake factory experiences I had in the past."
Alique B.,"Glendale, CA",191,214,146,1.0,6/24/2013,"I had the most traumatizing experience here. The hostess at the front desk was incredibly disrespectful and humiliated me in front of about 20 people.  Spoke to the manager... And he did nothing about it. Finally I had to call the corporate office, and he was quick to respond and was very apologetic.  Overall, I was so embarrassed that I would rather pass on this location and go to Pasadena instead."
Linda E.,"Culver City, CA",16,77,20,3.0,3/23/2015,I came here for dinner a week ago and got the BBQ chicken salad. Cheesecake has good food but this location is always super packed. There was an hour wait. We got seated inside and it was soo loud I could hardly speak to my friend.
Tina A.,"Glendale, CA",235,56,198,2.0,4/10/2014,Im a loyal client of cheesecake factory but Im slightly disappointed at the service i received.. It took the waiter 30 minutes to take the order and about another 20 minutes to bring me the check to check out .
Gerald W.,"Burbank, CA",21,157,23,3.0,4/10/2015,"I brought my Girlfriend here for her birthday just to hang out and have dinner, she also LOVES cheesecake.  This isn't the first Cheesecake Factory that I have been to and for the most part its typical Cheesecake Factory.  The service was a little slow and it seemed that our waitress was spread a little thin.  Overall, typical Cheescake factory."
Andony C.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/11/2015,Good place and good food. It's a bit crowded though but that's alright.
Rhonald N.,"Glendale, CA",177,271,1618,4.0,3/1/2014,I always get the Carrot cheese cake or the pineapple upside down cake.  Nothing beats their cheesecakes!
Greg Z.,"Hesperia, CA",64,33,15,1.0,11/4/2014,"The one star is for the overall experience, like I said before, the food is ok, nothing special and not worth what they charge but it's location def adds a few dollars to the menu, which I understand. Service was slow, but friendly, but here's the kicker...I guess my 15 percent tip wasn't enough because they tacked on an extra 25 dollars to my bill. Now that won't break my piggy bank but I'm not in the business of just giving away money. Told the waiter and the managers and they said their system was down, that they would fix it right away and it was a mistake. Again, mistakes happen and I understand. It's been weeks and still nothing. Enjoy the extra tip Cheesecake Factory because I am never eating there again, stay classy."
Kathleen K.,"Kingston, NY",29,8,,1.0,6/27/2015,The fried macaroni & cheese was cold. The cheesecake with strawberries was frozen. Our bill came to $94.94 before tip and was totally not worth it. I have never had bad food at any other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants - what a bummer. The only plus was the waiter. Ended up deathly sick all night. I found out that my daughter also got sick
Abel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,146,365,5.0,2/23/2014,Great service.. We had a party of 12 and we waited a little more than 30min which was less than wait time they gave us.. Appetizers came out quick and the staff was very attentive and they gave us everything we asked for except for the bill..lol   ... Food came out delicious
Soseh K.,"Los Angeles, CA",121,50,89,4.0,4/1/2015,"They have pretty great food but I mostly like their lunch special. I like it because the portions are smaller than regular dinner portions. Their mojitos are also really good. I always get Evelyn's favorite pasta, avocado egg rolls or Santa fe salad with no chicken (vegetarian)."
Lola S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,136,7,1.0,5/22/2013,"Went here on my birthday with my boyfriend and ordered lemon herb crusted fish. The server was decently nice to us until the food came out. Apparently she put in the lemon herb crusted chicken. I told her I ordered the fish, (I don't even like chicken! I would never order it!). She called me a liar to my face. I didn't want to make a big deal (because I am a really tolerant person), but I asked her to fix it anyways and bring over the manager. Manager never came and the food came out THIRTY minutes later. By then my boyfriend already ate his food (because I told him to) and when my food came out, I was too upset to eat it (by being called a liar). On my birthday, I was upset, I will never forget what happened here and I tell everyone about what happened.  xoxo, -Birthday ruined"
Elsa P.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,6,2,1.0,8/1/2015,I was traveling from Northern California and stopped by the Cheesecake Factory to enjoy a meal with my family.  It seemed the waiter josh and manager tried to get us out of our seats.  I would not recommend the cheesecake  factory in Glendale at all.  The staff was rude.   The cashew  chicken  cold and tasteless.  Ice cream was warm and melted.   The manger almost kicked us out while we were talking.  Do not go McDonald's has better service and ice cream
Edvin N.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,10,1.0,4/23/2016,"Shocked....! A family of 4 with two 6 year old kids and the parents kicked out for NO REASON..... I'm not setting foot in that institution anymore. I was at the Cheesecake Factory at Americana at Brand in Glendale California last Friday.  It was a Zoo.... Over 30 parties of 2 to 6 people waiting in line, all frustrated because of wrong information the reception was giving to customers. Telling people the wait is 30 minutes and providing the table in 90 minutes. We were seated at last, witnessing a shocking experience of 2 hungry and thirsty kids crying terrified of the police officers that were denying them service..... For no reason... Imagine that!  The gentleman was not aggressive at all; he was mad at the situation and all he was asking was ""I need to know who's kicking me out, I need his business card""  I overheard the officer say ""this is the only Brian here and we're not obligated to give you his last name..."" The family was escorted out..... Do you wanna have a taste of Cheesecake Factory?"
Kaitlin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",269,385,81,3.0,12/18/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a good place to go when you don't know what you want since their menu is endless. The food never really blows me out of the water, but it's good. The reason I go back is because there's something for everyone, the staff is very friendly, and there's typically no wait. Being right in the Americana also makes it a great location. If I'm already there shopping, it's easy to stop by and grab dinner."
Andrew T.,"Canyon Country, CA",5,19,4,5.0,1/11/2015,"Amazing food and service, we loved our host Raymundo and the manager Matthew! They are just amazing and take wonderful care of their customers! :)"
