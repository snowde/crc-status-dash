Samantha J.,"Montrose, CA",515,21,11,1.0,9/21/2014,"45 minute wait, to get called up to say my table is ready. 30 minutes later to be sat at the worst table on the patio. The hostess couldn't have cared less about their mistake of seating numerous tables who had arrived later than us. Having previously worked as a hostess at a very busy restaurant, let's just say, I am not impressed by the level of service. To top it off, we were not greeted by a server for another 8 minutes."
Phillip W.,"Crenshaw, Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,5.0,6/18/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has never failed me. This one is in a great location at the Sherman Oaks Galleria. The first of is always great they give you enough to eat for the next thing which isn't a bad thing, there is a wait the later that you come and on the weekend but that just shows how great there food is. The staff is nice and always polite."
Albert G.,"Glendale, CA",3,125,603,4.0,3/1/2015,Food for all walks of life and all tastes.  This place is one of the best restaurants around.  Great food with great prices and service.
Shannon S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,4.0,7/19/2015,"This place is reliable. The food is always consistent. My boyfriend and I love sitting on the patio at the americana and people watch. I recently had their farmer chicken salad, I think that's what it's called. Anyway it was delicious!  All the pastas are great! Service is good. Not great but good. Our servers seem to forget stuff we ask for. But it's ok because the food is amazing. We both love cheesecake but tried the carrot cake last time. It was heaven."
Keely G.,"Los Angeles, CA",797,262,55,1.0,5/18/2013,"TSK, TSK Cheesecake Factory!  Before I commence with my scathing review about our lunch yesterday, let me state that I eat here all the time and normally I receive the type of service I've come to expect at a CF: excellent. That being said, yesterday's experience from top to bottom sucked. Big time.  The only positive was being warmly greeted by the hostess Maddy.  As a huge Laker fan, I recognized her right away as one of the Laker Girls. : ) Being that it was a gorgeous day, we asked for a table outside on the patio. Wish granted.  However, the girl who took the four of us to our table, brought us to a party of 10 people and started to put our menus down, which created an awkward moment where we were wondering ""who are these people and why do we have to sit with them?"" while said people were looking at us thinking, ""who are these girls crashing our party?"" So I told the girl, ""Hold on, you know we're not with those people right?"" Clearly flustered, she just sat us at the closest table, dropped the menus and bolted. Well, the table was as close as any table could possibly be to the huge party, & we just wanted a nice, quiet lunch away from parties & kids, so we asked to be moved. Little did we know, we were moving to a new area that would bring us to the worst service imaginable.  1.) Drinks came & I had some foreign object floating in my iced tea. No harm, no foul as it was replaced. 2.) My friend decided she wanted a lemonade, so she ordered one at the time our initial drinks were being delivered (more on that later). 3.) Normally, we request a basket of that delicious honey wheat bread (no white bread) but a mixed basket was plunked down before we had a chance to ask. No worries, less carbs is probably a good thing. 4.) We order two Skinnyliscious Factory Salads, a Skinnyliscious Chicken Salad sandwich and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  After what seemed like an eternity, our food shows up. But, not all the food, only the TWO salads. One of the salads had a hair in it, but my friend wasn't sure if it was hers (her hair was in a ponytail) or not. She convinced herself it was hers (EEK). Surely, the other two dishes are right behind it, right?  Wrong.  It was about 10-15 minutes before the Grilled Chicken sandwich showed up, leaving one person at our table with no food. And not wanting to be rude, we all just sat there & waited & waited & waited for the Chicken Salad sandwich to show up.  It was around this time, that my friend's lemonade showed up (30 minutes later!)  Our waitress never came by during this entire debacle until my laser beam glare caught her from across the patio and I motioned her over.  When informed that we were missing a dish & that we had been waiting a really long time for it, she went to check it out & came back with just the side salad in a small bowl and plunked it down. Honestly, it looked like mixed greens and dressing that would have taken 15 seconds to make. Well, finally, we can all get started eating... but by that time we were pretty much fed up.  We flagged down some random girl & asked for the manager. Clearly, she goes and tells our server of our request for a manager instead of sending him directly over because after 10-15 more minutes the joke of a sandwich shows up, delivered by our waitress. Huge white plate, with a mid-sized sandwich sitting in the middle--not even a garnish. No joke, it was two slices of toasted white bread with premade chicken salad, lettuce and a tomato. THAT IS WHAT WE WAITED 40+ MINUTES FOR??!!!  I've made sandwiches at home that looked better than that!  And mind you, it wasn't even crowded in the restaurant. Instead of apologizing, she asks ""Do you still want to speak to the manager?""  Are you crazy lady? Of course we do! Even more so now. 5.) The ""Manager"" - Oh boy. I think his name was Julian or Justin and I'm still not convinced that he was even a manager given his demeanor dealing with us. It was evident that our waitress had given him her (very skewed) version of events prior to his arrival because he comes over and very nonchalantly says, ""So, I hear there was a dish that took a little longer to arrive.""  Really, dude?  Honestly, I think he apologized but I'm not entirely sure as he spoke very fast and mumbly, which came off as totally insincere. He offered to give us a complimentary dessert, which we declined being that 3 of the 4 of us ordered from the SKINNYliscious menu (Hellooo, summer is upon us!).  I think that threw him for a loop and he looked unsure what to do at that point. Finally, he offered to comp the meal that took ages to arrive and he left. In summary, a nice quick bite to eat for lunch turned into an irritating, unsatisfying nearly 2 hour experience. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory, I really expect so much more from you."
Diana S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",73,248,57,5.0,3/14/2014,"I love cheesecake factory! It is my family's favorite place to go. Great quality of food, large portions and very yummy. I think we go there like twice a month. Not just this location but others as well. Pastas: try the jambalaya or chipotle chicken pasta both are spicy but soo sooo good Appetizer's: Try Lettuces wraps, Stuffed Mushrooms, or wings YUMMY Salads: Luau Salad, BBQ Chicken Salad, Kale Salad, Cesar Salad All really good I haven't had burgers or sandwiches but they look amazing Cheesecake: Tuxedo or carrot cheesecake OMG amazing"
Kathrin P.,"Alameda, CA",28,116,61,2.0,3/12/2014,"I went back twice recently for my birthday week. The first time on my birthday we ordered appetizers and drinks. The menu's were dirty, which was gross. My sister ordered the Fire-Roasted Artichokes which were not so bad and I wanted fries for the table. When we got them they were cold, tasteless, and not crispy at all. The next time I came we ordered fries again with the sliders hoping they would taste better and the Portobello Mushroom and Zucchini fries as well. The fries were again not crisp and tasted like they were leftovers, the sliders were bland like microwaveable frozen burgers, and the Portobello Mushroom and Zucchini fries were too fried and did not taste good. Both times our servers could have been more welcoming.  Next time I will stick to what I usually order at Cheesecake, which are the specialty plates and pasta's. The salads are not to bad either."
Eli G.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,44,84,4.0,12/20/2014,"food is always great! This place has a little bit of everything i like. Good Service, Great Pasta and cheesecake :)"
Christina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,5.0,6/2/2015,I would like to say that this cheesecake is fast friendly and very on it the food is always great Courtney was my server she had great service and always came to check up on us ty!!
Steven G.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,106,205,2.0,3/8/2015,"I love cheesecake factory, I want to make that clear, however this was a disappointing experience. We got a table relatively quickly, considering how busy it was, but then the service took a dive. We weren't offered bread, while the tables around us were. I ordered a kettle soda, which might as well have been water. Had to ask twice for glasses of water. Then the food, bland, under seasoned, boring. I ordered the chicken madiera, which I have had, and enjoyed, at another location. Here the chicken was cold, under seasoned, and literally drowned in an overly sweet wine reduction. My girlfriend had the Cajun shrimp jumbalaya, which was also under seasoned, she had to ask for salt.  Then the grand finale, the cheesecake...we ordered the lemon/raspberry cream cheesecake...a slice literally 1/2 the size of an average cheesecake factory slice, of course, why stop at mediocre food, might as well rip us off with their name sake item...poor management.  Unfortunately it is clear that quality has given way to quantity  at this location."
Leyva R.,"Glendale, CA",69,47,115,3.0,9/11/2013,Eh.. place is a bit pricey for the service you get if you ask me.. nice decor. Food is very flavorful that's the plus side..
Maria R.,"Glendale, CA",22,23,,4.0,5/18/2013,"Great place with amazing cheese cakes! I love cheese cakes!! of course it is about 1000 calories in a small tiny piece but 2 hours in the gym you are good to go for another piece. Plus, this place has a big selection of appetizers. Most of them are so big that you dont even need to order anything else. Plus, this place is located in Americana +100 points. I jult love this restaurant"
Jayne T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,47,31,3.0,3/29/2015,"Food is delicious. I always order the pasta with chicken, peas, pancetta. The garlic pieces in the sauce are so good. I recommend the lemon raspberry cheesecake and banana cream cheesecake. Always a delight.  Service is always pleasant with the exception of the host/hostess. One host there walks around with a stank face like he doesn't want to work there anymore. That's fine, but don't take it out on the customers by not acknowledging guests when greeting or seating.  Prices are reasonable. This place is always busy, but the food won't disappoint."
Willie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,84,110,5.0,3/7/2015,Came here about 3weeks ago I dined with my boyfriend great food but our waitress Isis was above & Beyond and the reason why I'll be coming back requesting her.
Anisa P.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/21/2016,"For something like the Cheesecake Factory, you would expect a better quality product. The food was dense and left me feeling empty, both physically and emotionally. The food lacked a sense of creativity, and when they truly tried- it failed. The guacamole was still left in hard lumps and needed salt; while their fries were unnecessarily soggy. I do have to say however, that their service is good -and the bread is always a plus."
Fred H.,"Burbank, CA",2,90,,2.0,2/17/2016,"I brought my wife to this location on 2/15/16.  There were a few things that we were disappointed about.  The first was that our waitress forgot to return my credit card upon giving us the bill.  This resulted in my having to cancel that credit card and have a new one sent to me.  This server had seemed very tired while serving us and failed to check in on how our dinner was going.  So we had to wait quite a while to get our drinks refilled, more butter for our bread, etc.  The second thing, and this has more to do with the company, is that on their bills, there is a section near the bottom where they ""suggest"" levels of gratuity such as 15%, 18%, and 20%, followed by dollar amounts which are automatically calculated based on the bill's total.  The problem with those ""suggestions"" is that they are based on including drinks and taxes, both of which should not be included when calculating gratuity in the United States.  This means that a lot of less informed people, those who don't calculate their own gratuity, are trusting the miscalculations that are listed on the bills for gratuity, which greatly favor the servers.  It's not ethically right for the restaurant to do this since an uninformed customer would be trusting a miscalculation.  Both of these variables in our experience that night determine that we will not visit this location again.  They need to have alert servers working, and they should not mislead their customers in the way of what is considered normal gratuity percentages.  I only wish that I could have taken back some of the gratuity that I left for the waitress who left my card at her register forcing me to cancel the card.  Oh well, if she does that a few more times, she won't be working there much longer."
Victoria S.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,96,140,4.0,1/23/2014,"Good place to have a normal lunch. Maybe I'm not a big fun of those flavor, but the avocado egg roll was kinda weird with sweet sauce. The chicken salad was just a little bit chicken inside and I'm not satisfied with that. Good location, located in Americana and the architecture are good like always."
Beatriz C.,"Huntington Park, CA",1,43,81,5.0,3/25/2015,"My all time favorite restaurant! I love their delicious bomb cheesecake!!! The clam chowder is amazing. I am in love with the crispy shrimp platter I always order that specific plate.  It could get very crowded but it is definitely worth the wait. Also, the wheat bread with butter is awesome. I recommend this place to everyone."
R M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/3/2015,"I Have been to many Cheesecake factory restaurants but this one gets the gold medal for having the worst front desk/host person ever! Andrew was rude and had no respect when he talked to me. First he told us - my family and I that the wait was 15 to 20 minutes. We waited 50mins. Andrew needs to know that when you are the face of the house, you as a host, must be pleasant, polite and nice to the restaurant customers and not ARROGANT!!! No matter what the situation is. Unfortunately, Andrew chose to have a bad attitute towards costumers that will no longer feel comfortable going to The Cheesecake Factory restaurants. It was a very disappointing situation!"
Ovia L.,"Altadena, CA",0,45,1,3.0,5/24/2015,"Super super ordinary American food. We waited one hour and a half for our table and it's not worth it. I don't understand why it's so popular. It's loud and packed, I can't find myself comfortable in that kind of place. With that number of customers don't expect any good quality service."
