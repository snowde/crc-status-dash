Jae F.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/30/2015,"I only have 2 stars cause my food was good. But  the service deserves no stars worst ever come here 1 month ago  and I had to get up and go ask for a waiter, came here tonight and once again service  is horrible, ide say don't come here unless you want to wait  almost two hours for food and not have any service."
George H.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,50,12,4.0,8/5/2013,"The cheesecake factory has been great and not so great. It's a good go to restaurant and the food is delicious. The service is the only thing that lacks here most of the time.  I go here often, and they have messed up our orders more than once. We go later in the night always so not sure if that is a factor or not. The servers take a long time to return and our drink sit waiting for a refill most the time. If you do come here I recommend eating at the bar if you can find a seat. They have the full menu and the bartends really work hard and are good at what they do. Plus from there you can see the water show behind the bar through the huge glass wall.  The bar and the quality of the food pushed this review higher then it should have been overall. I would honestly rate it 3 and 1/2 if I could. Some of the staff go the extra mile but there are those that are just there messing around with nothing to do sometimes. Its not enough to discourage me from coming back but its not my first choice anymore.  It will always be a good back up in my book for now"
Julie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,586,6,4.0,3/25/2011,"I came here recently and got some avocado egg rolls to go.  When I got home, I found the avocado filling to be kind of brownish/black!!  (The last time I had avocado egg rolls was at the Grove location and the avocados were so green and fresh looking)  I don't think the ride home from Glendale to L.A. would make the avocados turn color in that amount of time so I think they used overripe avocados...It didn't look very appetizing at all. I called and spoke to the manager.  He was very nice and apologetic and offered me a gift card for my next visit.  I commend them for making things right."
Lorren C.,"North Hollywood, CA",587,36,30,2.0,8/30/2014,"Ok, let me say the place is fine, the food is fine. My SERVER was horrible! Shy is her name. Here's what happened: We were a party of 10. She greeted us, all was fine. She took our drink order, great. Then she asked for our order, instead we asked for bread. She responded, ""Let me take your order, then I'll get your bread"". Awkward, especially since we weren't all ready, but ok. We asked if we could get separate tabs, she said she could do no more than 3. Fair enough. Then she said she could only do 1 credit card per tab. Eyebrow raise...since when?  She said it would take forever even if we wrote the info down. Oooookay. She precedes to think NOW is the time to split the tabs because it's a process & asks that we settle who will be on which tab. Very awkward. She then asked if we knew whether or not we'd be ordering dessert. We said we weren't sure.  She said she needed to know now because she can't add to the tabs after she splits em. Now annoying! Food comes, we eat, fine. She brings the tabs. We pay but not well because we're annoyed (no idea why gratuity for our large party wasn't automatic). She takes the payment, leaves, and comes back to address the tip, saying there are suggested amounts on the receipt for us to go by. Wow.  Shy, if I ever see you coming towards my table, I'm changing sections."
Luis F.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2,17,,1.0,4/16/2015,"+1 on the slowness and cleanliness @ this place. They had dirty glasses(2 of them) so had to request new ones. Waiter was a total jerk when we wanted to know where our drinks were as if he was doing us a favor. 20 minutes, more water comes in. Waited for 40 minutes to get 2 beers and a Tropical drink and an hour and 15 to get appetizers (Nachos) which were disgusting! The worst part honestly is the fact that it was a party of 4 and all 4 of us were sick the next day - All different dishes. Do yourself a favor and skip this place..."
Lindsey W.,"Pasadena, CA",312,25,13,1.0,5/15/2015,"I had a really terrible expierence at this location. I got to the place 2 hours early as directed to do so for a party of 30. They took close to 4 hours and kept ""accidentally"" seating people in the space they had reserved for us. The manager was incredibly rude and so was the hostess."
Bin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,521,,1.0,2/16/2013,"Review is not about the food, but the HORRIBLE service. My mom and I asked the hostess to be seated outside since we had our dog with us. With prior notice from the hostess that our dog needed to be leashed OUTSIDE the fenced area, which we completely agreed to, we were seated out in the patio. Everything was fine; my dog was behaving fine (with the leash tied to the black fence outside), my mom and I were served our waters & bread, and we were waiting for our server to show up. Then comes a 'manager' that tells us they couldn't serve us because we had our dogs with us and other diners had an issue with this. We were asked to leave the restaurant. SERIOUSLY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Your 'competent' hostess already knew we had our dog with us, and he was (as indicated), OUTSIDE the dining area. We only noticed two occupied tables that were far away from our table, so where did you get this ""complaint"" from? They didn't even notice our dog because my mom leashed him prior to coming in through the side door. I wouldn't have an issue with this, and I've seen diners at this particular branch at the Americana with dogs in the past. But there are so many things wrong with this picture. You could have refused to serve us FROM THE GET GO because we had our dog - when I walked in the restaurant to ask, my mom was waiting OUTSIDE by the side door so we wouldn't disturb diners. You also didn't have to disrespect us by wasting our time getting seated only to be kicked out minutes later. I still have yet to receive a reply from you even after writing an email to explain the situation in a detailed manner. I'm sure you guys provide your staff with extensive training on customer service, but please make sure the left hand knows what the right hand is doing, because apparently, our experience here turned out to be horrible because of your lack of competence in coordinating situations professionally."
Mesrop J.,"Burbank, CA",26,17,2,5.0,2/17/2014,"I usually don't leave reviews, especially for restaurant chains, but I had to make an exception. I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations all around LA, but this was my first visit to the Americana location. The line at the door was pretty long and the wait for a table was even longer, but that was no surprise, especially since it was Presidents' Day. We were greeted by our hostess, Jackie, who seated us right as we were called in, as opposed to having us wait another 15 minutes (which is usually what happens at the other locations). Our waitress Paige, took our order right away and the food came out shortly after. Both Jackie and Paige were sweet and helpful, which was a refreshing change. Even though the place was packed, we weren't rushed nor did we have to wait very long for service. If I were to get service as great as this more often, I would definitely dine at the Cheesecake Factory more often. As for the food, both our plates of pasta were delicious, and the passion fruit iced tea was very refreshing. No complaints from this happy diner."
Bree N.,"Burbank, CA",515,154,172,1.0,12/14/2014,"Basing this review on my phone experience with the bakery.  Told the guy I wanted to reserve a Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake for Christmas Eve and he said ok, the 26th?  I said no, the 24th.  He said they were out and wasn't sure if they were getting anymore so I asked if there was any way to know for sure.   He suggested I call back a couple of days before to see if they had it.  I said no, I'd rather call other stores but asked if maybe a manager would know.  He put me on hold, came back and said that whatever they had was all they would have (love that response) and all they had was Pumpkin Pecan and Peppermint cheesecakes as far as seasonal went.  Well that's great because I asked about the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake.  I said great, lets reserve that one.  He said ok I can try to hold it for you.  I said you can try or you will?  Because if you can't guarantee it's availability I'll just pick it up today.  He said oh no, I'll make sure it's here.  I said great, are you closing early that day?  He said well we're open Monday through Friday til 11.  I said no, I'm asking because it's Christmas eve and I just want to make sure I don't miss you.  He confirmed (?) they're open regular hours.  Not feeling especially confident, I called back and asked to speak to a manager.  I was on hold for quite a while.  Probably a busy Sunday.  No problem.  But the guy sounded incredibly bothered to be on the call regardless of how brief.  I've had decent experiences at this location. Not sure what happened to the customer service but its pretty disappointing, to say the least."
Nikki C.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",85,58,19,1.0,1/5/2015,"In December 2014, to celebrate the holidays I made reservations for my coworkers and I for a table of 20 for 4:00. The date of the event, on 12/18/14, I receive a call from a staff member/management stating that my reservations will not be honored as I requested because the staff member who took my reservation was ""not authorized"" to do so. (??? How was I suppose to know that and why should their problem become mine?) Instead she insisted that all 20 of us show up by 3:30 or the tables will be given away. This was unreasonable because as teachers having to work with parents and preparing lessons, it is VERY difficult to decide last minute to leave work early, not to mention the obvious: the difficulty of getting 20 teachers to leave early the DAY OF -as this call was made to me 4 hours prior to the event time.... At this point, it was necessary for me to asked to speak to the manager above, on site. Needless to say, I was feeling panicky and thinking, ""I can't believe this happening! CHEESECAKE would do it??! What they are doing is wrong AND will all 20 of my coworkers have a seat?"" So I basically begged the manager to honor the reservation that was taken two weeks prior, FOR 4:00, and that 20 PEOPLE SIGNED UP to attend and are counting on the reservations. I was stern but remained respectful. He was not empathic. I told him I was very disappointed and yet he didn't seem to care. He would not honor the original 4:00 reservation. W-O-W. I will NEVER make reservations again at CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  OUTCOME of the event: After being stress out and scrambling with my committee members, we spread the word to our coworkers and told them the situation and asked them to please arrive at 3:30, if possible.... Fast forward to 3:30: our tables were occupied and were NOT available for us UNTIL 4. (Interesting, I was threatened that we would lose our tables if we were not present by 3:30.) the good news is, we all got chairs so I was relieved at that point and decided for the evening I will enjoy and forget management and deal with the upset later. At the time it was easy to be happy because I had good company, the holidays were approaching and the servers were friendly and prompt.  I was debating to write this review, however the two staff members/managers of Cheesecake treated me wrong and I hope they will not do the same to others."
Lana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/11/2016,One of the best experiences I've had. I enjoy going to Cheesecake Factory especially the one in Americana. The waiters and waitresses are so friendly and always on top of their game. They make sure everything is in your favor. They give you honest opinions of all the dishes and you never leave unhappy. This is my GO-TO
Scott T.,"South Pasadena, CA",237,681,285,4.0,11/10/2011,"If I had to whittle down my review to two words: farmhouse cheeseburger. But here's the expanded version: go with someone, each of you get a farmhouse cheeseburger, try to walk around the Americana a few times to make sure your heart hasn't stopped from the burger, grilled smoked pork belly with fried egg on top."
Amy B.,"Glendale, CA",126,45,32,5.0,1/19/2015,"Brittany is a really REALLY great server. She was super personable, offered lots of excellent choices and made so many modifications because we are trying to be good these days;). The food was fantastic (which is saying a lot because we got very basic, healthy and low fat food and usually people comment here for how amazing the pasta and cheesecake is!)."
V E.,"Pasadena, CA",13,273,9,4.0,3/30/2014,"The burgers are the best item on the menu (aside from the cheesecake). Trust me. Everything else is too salty/overdone/not-as-good-as-you'd-like-it-to-be. But enough about Cheesecake Factory! Let's talk about Americana. Or, an Armenian's vision of the Bellagio in Glendale. Geez, what a place. This place is so nice they should charge admission."
Xochitl H.,"Glendale, CA",34,26,11,1.0,3/19/2013,"If I could give it negative stars I would. Terrible customer service! I don't care how good the food is, if the service sucks then I'm not spending my money there. If you're at the Americana GO TO GRANVILLE INSTEAD! DON'T GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO EAT. We were seated very quickly, and the place was actually pretty empty so I can't explain why the service was so awful. Our waitress was very nice, Victoria, BUT AFTER WAITING OVER 45 MINUTES WE NEVER GOT OUR FOOD, and our very friendly waitress, Victoria, disappeared! I left work early to take my daughter to a fun lunch at the Americana, and opted to go to the cheesecake factory.  My daughter ordered a burger, and I ordered a salad, simple enough.  Well, we got the appetizer fairly quickly; however, after the appetizer came we waited another 40 minutes and the food never came AND our waitress disappeared.  I flagged down a different waitress who then checked on our order, and a few minutes later showed up with the burger which had obviously been sitting under the heat lamps for a while since the cheese was all cold and puckered looking, and the beef was rubbery, um if I'm paying $13.00 for a burger it better be hot and cooked correctly.   After a few more minutes the manager shows up, and tried to make us happy, but by that point my daughter was crying because she was so angry, and she just wanted to leave.  I explained to the manager that I don't have issue waiting for food, but they should have at least checked in with us and let us know that our order was delayed.  A waitress shouldn't just leave the patron waiting...we were there so long someone even came by and packed up our appetizer before the food even came, that alone speaks volumes. Anyway, I've come here before and had a good time; however, this is the last time that I step foot in this location."
ShareBear L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,7,1.0,3/27/2015,I got food poisoning last night from the lemon garlic shrimp pasta. My friend are the ahi tuna and got diarrhea. I'm not coming here anymore. Stay away from seafood.
Catt S.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,79,4,1.0,9/21/2014,"What a huge mistake it was to go here! They couldnt do ONE THING correctly. First, I waited for a table for 30 minutes before i asked about it, and the dumb broad had crossed my name out already, so instead of getting the next table i went back on the bottom of the list. Now we're seated and I cant get a server or a drink order to save my life! another 20 minutes goes by and he comes by asking if were ready to order. Sure! god knows we'll never see you  again. Ordered, and 35 minutes later, he comes and tells me they're out of my pasta and to order something else. I am ready to walk. He says he'll rush it. Fine. we get our food... its not great, but edible and slightly above cold. I want coffee afterwards so another 10 minutes goes by before I get black coffee which is sooo burnt, i choke on it. Forget it! No tip and storm out. NEVER AGAIN!! P.S. he asked to validate my parking stub, gave it to him... Saw a movie and went to pay for parking, NO VALIDATION! PAID FULL PRICE!  I will be telling everybody I know about this God forsaken joke."
Trayna N.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,94,45,1.0,12/27/2014,"Probably the worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory ever.  Came here the other day with a few friends.  Walked in and asked for a table outside and they said they would text me when our table was ready.  Came back when they texted me and when I walked in another party just came in and they got seated before I did!  They even sat outside too.  That was annoying.  Came to our ""table"" wasn't even cleaned yet.  We sat down and didn't have napkins or any utensils. I tried flagging down a few waiters but they took forever, I was even ignored!! When our bread finally came we didn't even have knives to put the butter on.  There was only sourdough bread (no wheat and wheat is always the best) the bread was rock hard I felt like I was gunna break my teeth!  The service was horrible. It constantly took about 5-10minutes to have a waiter bring back what we wanted (utensils, water, sauces, our bill...).  Our food almost took 45 minutes to bring to the table.  The food was decent but having experienced the poor service, my dinner was ruined.  Avoiding the Cheesecake Factory at all costs!  Not worth the time!"
Aeri K.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,267,49,4.0,1/16/2012,Honestly I never realized how good cheesecake factory was. Maybe I was just really hungry but it was really good.  Ordered shrimp scampi and a Monterey burger.  The shrimp scampi was okay. I didn't lie how the shrimps were fried. Pasta seemed a little over cooked and bit dry.  The burger was really good though. Had avocados. I had lettuce and tomatoes added on the burger though.
Foodmurderer O.,"Brea, CA",0,44,13,3.0,10/3/2013,"The ambience is casual.  The menu has too many selections. It should be trimmed down. Just because the menu is packed, it doesn't mean they're all good choices.  The food is not bad, but nothing sensational. The portions are huge.  I like the Sunday brunch best.  The Belgium waffle is pretty darn good! The portions justify the price.  The service is usually good, but lags when they're busy.  The bartenders are awesome.  I try to sit at the bar whenever possible. Notable mentions: Jamaican black pepper chicken, roadside sliders, and any slice of cheesecake."
