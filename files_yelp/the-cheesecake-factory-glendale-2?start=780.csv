Jason S.,"Glendale, CA",5,48,3,1.0,2/22/2015,"Sat at the bar waited 15 minutes just to get some bread and finally when the bread came the waiter gave me attitude and said, ""what do you want me to do about it."" no apology no I'm sorry for the bad service no nothing just additude and ignored me. Staff doesn't even care I would just eat somewhere else don't eat here."
Ed T.,"San Marino, CA",59,365,133,1.0,12/22/2015,"came here for dinner last night. all the review is true. bad service, but the worst is their manager. we came here at 5;20 and were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes.   I asked the manager if they would help out those who are handicapped. he said there are no policy but he would see what he can do. His allitute was poor and did not seem to care. we were not seated until 45 minutes later so he didn't ""help"".....hate it when people lied! I would understand if the staff was not professional, but a manager should be nicer!"
Lars B.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",2,6,6,5.0,3/20/2014,This place is heaven!!! I got the Kobe burger and it was the best ever!!! I want to come every day!! I love the service is the best!!!
Danny S.,"Loma Linda, CA",62,511,2,4.0,10/9/2013,"Went here on a Sunday evening (first time at Americana) thinking that it wouldn't be crowded...boy was I wrong.  It was around 7:00pm and the place was full.  We put our name down for a party of 5 and requested the patio.  Wait time was 40 mins.  No pager was given, but they took down my cell number and texted me.  Luckily we found a table at the bar to hang out.  Server came right away to take drink orders.  Drinks were brought out right away.  Around 30 mins later, my cellphone went off and our table was ready.  There are 2 patios and both were nice.  The weather was perfect outside.  Our waitress was really nice and friendly.  We came for dessert and drinks.  We decided to try the new smores cheesecake and the traditional white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  The smores cheesecake was really rich.  Too rich for my taste.  All in all, a decent place to hang out and chill on a sunday evening.  Validation gave us free parking too!"
Tina K.,"Burbank, CA",98,87,73,3.0,1/5/2015,"This location has worst service the waitresses are under experienced and make the Cheesecake Factory experience not worth my trip to the Glendale spot...our waitress today was slow, and probably lied on her application."
Luis D.,"Los Angeles, CA",333,153,72,3.0,11/18/2013,"Been to too many cheesecake factories and this one is just about the same as the others. Pricey, semi elegant atmosphere, great location, big plates, big food, ok service and big menu.  Food is ok, most portions are huge and the menu is like reading a cookbook with ads.  And hey, they do have great creamy cheesecakes and many to choose from too. Try to seat outside so you can catch a view of the water show that the Americana has.  You have to try this place at least once when you're at the Americana."
Briana G.,"Glendale, CA",1,20,,4.0,5/26/2014,"I'm here all the time and always love my experience. They have a large menu, in which you will be sure to find something that you'd like. Did I also mention how divine their cheesecake is ?  Parking is great, because they validate if you park in the Americana or you can park in the galleria for free and cross the street. Every waiter/waitress that I had was skilled in knowing details about each dish and always make good recommendations. Overall, great place."
Kim S.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",1917,972,2299,4.0,1/11/2013,"Here is a tip for sweet eaters.The best cheesecakes in America? I am normally not a  fan of chain restaurants but the cheesecake factory was one place that I  was sure to talk my Dutchman into trying out. He finally caved into trying a slice of cheesecake at  the Cheesecake Factory, which is known for their exceptional and special cheesecakes and deserts.  The Cheesecake Factory  without a doubt has the best cheesecakes in the world. Although, they are criticize for their large portions, it's  a perfect combination of plenty and sweet. I say manage what you eat through good judgement. Sweets are good for you in moderation. The problem is not sweets but how often you find yourself in here.You will find a Cheesecake Factory in almost every part of the USA.  Enjoy!"
Lucy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,930,538,3.0,9/22/2011,"I have been here a few times and service has been ok. However, the last time I came here i found old dried spaghetti on my silverware, and my friend didnt have any silverware, napkins or anything. We had to request it - the waitress was definitely not on it. Unlike other locations i dont think I have ever waited more than 5 minutes to get a table here. Its a huge spot with indoor and outdoor seating.  The food is what you would come to accept from Cheesecake factory"
Lisa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,119,21,3.0,12/14/2013,"Its been awhile since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory, now they have a system where they text you when your table is ready which I find really nice so I always hated carrying around that beeper that you get. We didn't get paged for our table, I asked if it was ready since it was 30 minutes+ and they said it was only a 20 minute wait.  My friend got the surf & turf (Salmon and Streak) while I got the spinach dip and the baked potato tots. My friend really liked her food while I only liked the dip. Nevertheless, I will go back to the Cheesecake Factory."
Yessy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,3.0,3/17/2016,"Not surprised the wait was long, but I love the Cheesecake Factory. We didn't have to wait the whole 30 min to be seated, which was good, but it took forever for the waiter to acknowledge us. When he finally came, we ordered our drinks and told him we were ready to order. My fiance ordered water with no ice and to add a lemon wedge and I asked that when we got our bread, if we could only get the wheat and no white. When he brought our drinks, he forgot to bring the lemon, and we had both kinds of breads. It didn't  bother me, I was hungry and just wanted to eat. My fiance asked for lemon again, and even by the time they brought out the food, we still hadn't gotten lemon. Finally, he asked again, and he brought it. He didn't apologize or anything, even after we had already asked a couple of times. Then, before we finished our food, we ran out of our drinks, but he we wouldn't come to ask if we needed anything or to refill our drinks. By the time we finished our food, he ended up coming and we asked him for water but we were all done with our food. Wasn't so impressed with the service. I usually get pretty good waiters but this last one wasn't so great."
Jack K.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,82,6,5.0,1/14/2015,This place is magical. I always end up finishing my entire plate even though the portions are huge. This place is the best dam restuarant in town.
Cydney M.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",82,670,3555,4.0,2/5/2011,"This is a great place if you want lots of choices. There are so many different appetizers, entrees, desserts and cocktails to choose from which is nice. My husband ordered the hot wings and be warned because they are blazing hot. My son ordered the nachos and popcorn shrimp. They skimp on the toppings on the nachos. It is a big plate of chips with a tiny bit of sour cream and guacamole. There are a lot of jalapenos which is good. The Popcorn shrimp very good. I had a chopped salad and that was great. It was quite large. Mojitos are good, but the alcohol content was minuscule. It's a great place to bring kids and it's nice to stroll around the Americana when you are finished. They validate parking which is nice.  Get there before 5:30 p.m. if you don't want to wait too long to be seated.  It is crazy after 6:00 p.m.."
Emily C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,9,5.0,2/3/2015,Had an encounter with a real sweet and awesome manager I believe her name was Sara our meal was not what was expected and she very sweetly exchanged our dish for    The correct one which was awesome since we had encountered a lengthy wait and it was awesome to be taken care of.
Mary T.,"Glendale, CA",11,49,3,4.0,12/20/2014,"Yes, this place is ALWAYS busy and over-crowded but what are they gonna do? Turn away customers? You can't deduct stars because everyone loves cheesecake factory lol. The santa fe salad is soooo good!!! My husband and I always order it and it's big enough for both of us to share. Of course, they have amazing cheesecakes, too!!! My favorite is the NY style plain cheesecake. It's really dense and not too sweet."
Sevag G.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",49,14,5,3.0,1/28/2014,I love coming here specifically for the jambalaya pasta. It is by far my favorite thing on the menu and is just perfect. I have specific ways of eating it also like getting the sauce extra on the side and the waiter always brings some over. Price is fair but only complaint would be the pasta felt like it was microwaved the last time I visited. However im sure it's a one time occurrence.
Nikki S.,"Palmdale, CA",1,27,3,1.0,9/20/2015,"Waited 40 minutes for a table and they tried to sit us in a section where the air conditioner wasn't working, we were asking the hostess to be sat in another section and was told it would be an additional wait meanwhile the manager was continually saying excuse me excuse me excuse me trying to rudely just move us out of the way so she could pass through (we were unaware she was the manger at this time) we went to the front and asked to speak to the manager. When she arrived she was extremely rude and acting as if she were a high school student in a stare down. Her name was Cher. She was completely unkept and unprofessional. I'm seriously shocked she was the manager. I will never revisit this location again."
Bethzilla F.,"Burbank, CA",76,72,13,2.0,1/20/2013,"I will NEVER understand why we keep eating here under the Eye of Sauron. There's always a long wait. One does not simply walk into a Cheesecake Factory and find seating right away.  The place is always super packed, the seating is always uncomfortable and the food is always mediocre and boring.  Every Cheesecake I've ever been to has been a disappointment.  Why?! Why do we do this to ourselves!? From now on when someone suggests this place I'll just go ahead and stab myself in the eye with a fork.  Every single dish I've had has been boring and bland. I've never gotten sick from it like some people have, but then again maybe I'm part goat. I can digest almost anything. However, I still have taste buds and enjoy a tasty meal.  Also, you can NEVER find your waiter/waitress when you need them. They're probably all hiding from possible Orcs. Ugh. I'm not even a LoTRs fan, but seriously..... have you seen the light fixtures over the booths. That's evil staring at you while you eat your crappy meal."
Walter C.,"Los Angeles, CA",428,55,88,4.0,7/13/2011,"Review: HAPPY HOUR (not dinner or any other dining time) I love their HH. It's Monday thru Friday from 4-6PM. The servers seem like they are kind of out of it sometimes. There is this one girl...she takes forever. She will walk around your table like a dozen times and each time that you try to get her attention, she gives you that lil motion about oh i'll be back. Never mind her. Avoid that one. She isn't of any help. She's the reason that I give my review 4 and not 5 stars.  I like their vietnamese tacos. They are bomb, with the pork belly and sauce on top. SOOOO damn good. The buffalo blasts are HUGE. So, if you are looking for something to share, that would be perfect. The potstickers aren't bad in their tamarind sauce but there aren't that many of 'em in there. I think there were 5 in the order that was $5. I could get a whole bag of 'em for $4 at trader joe's. But, if that's what you're craving then go for it. They are tasty.  Drink Specials are $5.00.  They have mojitos, JW Pink Lemonades, Long Islands and probably a few others but those are the ones that our friends usually order. The JW Pink Lemonade is tasty and has a nicely sugared rim. It's like the minute maid lemonade with a TINY kick. The mojitos are muddled just enough and the bartender is a pretty good pour, same with the Long Islands.  I'd suggest you get her a lil before 4PM. That way you should have a pretty good chance at getting a table or a seat at the bar. This is a good spot to catch the soccer game."
James M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",128,233,424,2.0,10/7/2013,"not a huge fan. This place was so insanely busy, it seemed like you were more at risk of being run over by the staff than by anyone else.  Service was meh, food was ok. On a good note, the coffee was decent."
