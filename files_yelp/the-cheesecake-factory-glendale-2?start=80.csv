Robert G.,"Glendale, CA",0,9,1,3.0,12/5/2017,"Considering it's in Americana, there is always at least a 30 minute wait anytime past 6PM. Huge portions, average quality, average price. Service overall similar fastfood restaurant, everyone running around due to large volume of customers. Unhealthy but tasty food!"
David R.,"Glendale, CA",27,12,2,1.0,12/16/2017,This place sucks. I called five times to place a take out order. I finally gave up on trying to have someone from this moronic restaurant take my order for take out. Thanks for wasting 20 minutes of my life
Elina T.,"Glendale, CA",0,51,66,3.0,9/11/2017,"I was craving cheesecake today so I decided to come here, especially since I hadn't been here for few months. Wait was just 30 minutes so it wasn't bad. I used to enjoy this place a lot more. Now, no matter what I eat it tastes okay and it's nothing special for the amount you pay. I had the Cajun jambalaya with chicken on the side. They literally put 4 pieces of shrimp in my pasta. If I'm paying $20 for pasta I expect few more shrimps and not just plain pasta with spices. I also got their strawberry cheesecake and even though I was craving that cheesecake, it didn't hit the spot. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the cheesecake was kept at a cooler temp. My fiancé got chicken lettuce wrap and he didn't like it due to the little amounts of chicken they put in it. This used to be one of my favorite places to eat but not anymore. Everything about this place is average."
Agatha B.,"Glendale, CA",9,34,,5.0,11/9/2017,Always a crazy wait but always worth it too. Everything I come to Cheesecake Factory I enjoy myself. For me it's not about how long I wait but the overall experience instead. I love the happy hour from 4-6 amazing deals. My favorite is the Buffalo blasts from the happy hour menu only 5 dollars and huge portions. When I go for dinner I love the Louisiana pasta which has a hint of spice but also so good with the bow tie pasta. You get to walk around Americana during the wait so it's not so bad.
Mary T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,7,3.0,10/23/2017,"My meal wasn't what I expected it to be, but waitress was really nice her name is Andrea. On top of it all the plate was extremely dirty and we waited extra 10 minutes for our salad."
Giulianna G.,"Torrance, CA",2,71,54,3.0,2/5/2017,"We went this Sunday and it was pretty busy. We were seated within 25 minutes which wasn't too bad. We ordered the super antioxidant salad with chicken added , falafel salad, grilled fish tacos, and carrot cake.  I can honestly say that the salads were delicious and healthy. The service was not that great. It took the server a long time to even bring us water or bread. In the middle of the dessert we got the bill. I don't think it is proper to give customers the check mid grub."
David D.,"North Hollywood, CA",382,7,,5.0,11/17/2017,Decided to stop by and grab a small bite around lunch time. I sat at the bar. The bartender Justin was great. He was very attentive and made me feel A1!! I'll be back on the account of how impressionable the staff was! Great JOB!! Keep smiling!
Lisa Q.,"Oakland, CA",2,46,9,4.0,8/13/2017,Great place to go get some lunch after shopping. Was here from out of town and we went there after hitting Nordstrom's. Got a table in the outside patio. Service was good and the food was great. The only thing that I didn't like the fact that tables are red on top of each other.
Ray B.,"Glendale, CA",67,85,44,1.0,6/10/2017,"One word: incompetent. From management to servers and cashiers. Dear yelp, please let me decide for myself if I want to post a tip or a review, you can also ask me to go away and post my reviews somewhere other than yelp but please don't make my decisions for me. Thanks"
Tony M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,21,,1.0,10/1/2017,I just called and tried to place an order  and a lack of customer service and  of phone  skills girl by the name of Britney answered and kept hang up the phone THREE times.  Stupid girl should just go home and  Learn how to treat customers.
Sarni N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1725,40,361,5.0,5/20/2017,"Lovely Atmosphere, very friendly staff, great service & the food was delicious. The cheesecakes as always are amazing. The prices are also good as per the quality of their food!"
Charlie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",171,175,91,4.0,7/25/2017,"Ugh, why must you tease me with that wheat bread every time?! Its soo good here.  I love the bar area, best place to go when you don't want to wait for a table. Customer Service isn't  bad, considering that there are so many patrons there. Our waitress was awesome because she was able to get us our drinks and tab quick. We told her we were trying to catch our movie, but not without a drink first.  We caught it, so thanks!! :)   Also *** we stayed more than 4 hours after our movie and had to pay $15 for parking. Next time, I'll park in the other lots for free."
Elin K.,"Burbank, CA",83,20,17,4.0,6/24/2017,"This place has great food at a reasonable price. I love their chipotle chicken pasta, Chinese chicken salad, steak Dian, and their cheesecakes are amazing!!! If you're looking for a nice dinner with a large group I definitely recommend going here. The only negative thing is that there usually is a long wait so be prepared. However, there is so much to do around the restaurant so the wait time isn't too bad."
Kevin L.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",90,12,12,3.0,7/24/2017,"As a regular, I know how busy it can get on the weekends especially on Sundays. But here is one of my lowest experiences dining here. Wait time was short, surprisingly. 15-20 minutes for a table of 3. We followed the hostess to our table and was seated, then assuming our waitress comes and already asks for our drinks without giving us some time. Didn't give us a name, which would of been nice.  While looking at the menu she comes back and takes our drink orders. Comes back with them and see if we're ready to order. My little brother already knew his order so he ordered first while we continued to look at the menu. Suddenly another waiter comes and doesn't introduce us, neither does the first waitress informs our new waiter. Anyway, he came in sounding like he just wants us to order already so we did. As time went by, we noticed everyone else receiving the complimentary bread that is usually served while we wait for our food but this time around we had to ask one of the waiters/waitresses if we can have some. My brother then receives his brunch combo, I'd give it a 9/10 because the waffles the substituted were spot on. My mother and I split a Kobe Burger, it was cooked the way we wanted it with sweet potato fries so I'd give it 9.5/10. Overall, I gave them a 3/5 mainly due to the service. First of all, we had a waitress at first then a waiter and never got informed their name. Second, neither asked if we needed anything else as for condiments or more water. Lastly, neither one came to our table after we received our food to see how it is. Of course, we always come here for the amazing food and I hope to have a better experience with their customer service."
Natali F.,"Glendale, CA",248,131,222,5.0,6/27/2017,"Seriously their Orange Chicken is the best thing in the world. Also, this review is for their take out that I ordered from door dash. The food was SO GOOD! I ordered the orange chicken of course, and the steak Diane and it arrived hot and fresh and cooked to absolute perfection. I was seriously impressed and I'll do it again in a heart beat!"
Deza S.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,53,39,3.0,10/5/2017,Went for lunch on a weekday. Seemed pretty busy but didn't wait long for a party of six. Our waitress was decent and the wait for our orders was not too long. Had the avocado toast and the chicken tacos which is always a good start. Their squaw bread is addicting and by the time I got my dinner size Chinese chicken salad i was satisfied and couldn't finish. My friend had their new Celebration Cheesecake and raved about it. Parking is usually at the structure next to the Americana and they do validate but only a certain amount of time. Love that they are consistent and their large food selection. Quality is ok.
Aura Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,9,1,1.0,9/30/2017,"Came tonight and and every time I come the waiter is polite but NOT TONIGHT. I came with a party of 7 and was attended by a waiter which he didnt introduce himsekf by the way ,after that we saw Connor. He came and introduced himself while walking away which was rude. We let that go but once he came back and served our food, I was missing ketchup and fries. He said, ""let me know if you need anything"" and I said ""ketchup please"" but he flew. He came back for another table and i tried to flag him down but he didn't pay no attention. I had to scream and finally he turned after several attempts. I'm not sure why he was being rude and having no patience. I know it's a busy night but we usually have a party of 15 and never treated this way."
Tania O.,"Anaheim, CA",13,76,184,4.0,12/20/2016,Merry Christmas  yes I said it!!! It's a Christmas feel here at this place which is making this review a 4 stars. My utensils were immaculate this time. The passion tea I always get was brewed on point. It's like management changed or decided to have a meeting and coordinate with their employees. Definitely a huge change from the different other times I've come before.
Hala Hana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,131,720,4.0,5/9/2016,Love cheesecake!!  My go to spot when i want to eat something tasty but know anything will taste good off the menu.  Cheesecake Factory always has so much flavor and an extensive menu. Almost tried everything off the menu and have many favorites I always seem to choose as well. Some of my favorites  Appetizer Avocado rolls  Spinach artichoke dip  Pasta Jambalaya pasta  Louisiana chicken pasta  Salad  Bbq chicken ranch salad  Cheesecake Banana cream pie cheesecake  Can't wait to try more off the menu!
Julie L.,"Arcadia, CA",60,58,41,2.0,4/23/2017,"There was absolutely no connection with our server this afternoon. She never cracked a smile throughout our visit and the anxiety displayed by her was marked. We had to ask for water, bread, and beverage refills. We had to mention the celebration of a friend's birthday several times. Usually, a birthday celebration - we ordered cheesecake- is plated and has a beautiful presentation. Instead, a small ice cream Sunday was brought out, then the cheesecake slices followed. Cheesecake Factory- let's see more quality control. The survival of a business has much to do with customer service. It can make or break a business, chipping slowly but surely.   The luau salad no longer on the menu, we opted for the Asian chicken salad, or was that Mai fun salad?  The salad was smothered with rice sticks. 3/5 Lemon pancakes- we all shared and realized mid-way that the waitress did not bring syrup!!!   Pancakes 5/5. Waitress 0 Pasta Devinci is a go to dish. 4/5, as the portion was smaller than usual Salmon on rice. Is a favorite 5/5 Pasta with veggies. 3/5. Pass on this dish.  The stoic waitress made it very uncomfortable for all, thus, 2 stars."
