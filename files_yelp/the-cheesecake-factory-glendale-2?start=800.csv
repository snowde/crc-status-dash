Tanya K.,"Zürich, Switzerland",118,628,337,4.0,8/20/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistently good. Large selection of menu options to choose from, each one as good as the next.  The seating situation is often disorganized and it is always best to request a booth otherwise you may end up elbow to elbow with complete strangers and unable to hear anything. A bit pricey considering it's a chain that advertises in it's menu."
Ketty J.,"Glendale, CA",26,58,4,5.0,9/1/2015,"Last time I went to a Cheesecake factory was about 5 years ago in Boston, I had a bad reaction  from the smell of the cheese and decided not to eat there ever again. However I was given a gift card for my birthday this year so I decided to stop by for happy hour. We walked straight to bar and were seated immediately. We did not make a reservation and finding a table was a breeze. Service was slow but our server Kelvin made it a pleasant experience. Let me start by saying they have one of the best happy hours in town! Drinks (selected margaritas, mimosas and couple more)were $5.50. Drinks were well made and strong. They have a bunch of appetizers 1/2 off and big portions too. I had the happy hour burger and my girl had the buffalo chicken. Everything was delicious. Kelvin also brought us 2 complementary bowls of clam chowder soup :) made my day because it was unexpected. Happy Hour is Mon-Fri 4-6 and they validate parking for up to 2 hours."
Lily R.,"Glendale, CA",1,4,,2.0,3/8/2016,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but they honestly deserved one. The food is alright, but my main reason is the customer service. The workers are so rude if you dare ask them for something they give you so much attitude. I've been living in Glendale all of my life and they have the worst customer service ever. Would not recommend."
Joseph L.,"Orange County, CA",447,182,805,5.0,11/25/2012,I love this place.  The food and service is always  great.  The only thing I hate is seeing the waiters' dirty white shoes....doesn't do much for my appetite.
Tara A.,"Glendale, CA",17,8,3,4.0,2/16/2015,"Im going to start with the one negative i saw: sanitation. The utensils were not clean and the replacements were not clean either. Over all i love the atmosphere and the food. i live their burgers and pasta dishes. As the name goes, try their cheesecakes, those are amazing!"
Cindy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,48,76,4.0,1/25/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory has one of the BEST outdoor seating areas of any of them. It faces directly into the water feature in the middle of ""Americana at Brand"". As a Vegetarian, they offer me many fantastic choices.  Be sure to put your name in early though as this place ALWAYS seems to have a wait."
Stephanie K.,"Pasadena, CA",103,19,15,5.0,1/14/2015,This place has been a Great Experience!!! And it was all because of Omar! He gave us great service! The manager was also a great help. It was crowded because it was the fist of new year. The food came out quick. We had lots of fun!
Kerop H.,"Glendale, CA",140,59,41,4.0,5/25/2015,This location has good service and consistently good food. Most of the waiters are courteous and knowledgeable about the menu. We've been coming here for several years and have tried lots of items on the menu but my favorite is the Miso Salmon. The bar does a great job too. Portions are very large and enough to share.
Damiean S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,3,5.0,4/23/2015,"Loved it when the baker knew my drink and my wife's there was Zara , Maryanne and Daniel and Sonia  and Sebastian and Albert those are the only names I remembered then the servers there are amazing as well I would come in in the morning and they already had my table ready and my favorite servers as well Brandon and Myra,Damearis, Robert and they always new what drinks and entree I wanted. The tale out service is good too unless you get the full of attitude Nora I asked for extra napkins and she gave me a smirk and made some sarcastic joke about me (I couldn't understand her) but other than that it's amazing here I have spoken to the general manager Rock and he is so nice"
Rene G.,"Glendale, CA",60,214,36,4.0,9/11/2011,"I really never had a bad experience with the food at cheesecake factory because i really only order one thing from the menu, but the service really is a hit or miss. You either catch them in a good day or bad day. So lucky the last times i have gone the service was good.  Quick Tip- BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad... simply orgasmic"
Tanya M.,"Glendale, CA",0,13,1,1.0,8/31/2014,I have been to Cheesecake Factory for years and never had a problem. Sure the food has been mediocre but it's a good place for groups. However the service I received today was horrible. I went there for brunch ordered an egg sandwich. I got the whole second half to go because it was really big. I came home to find that someone had clearly taken huge bites out of the sandwich before packing it up. I can't believe someone would do that so disgusting. Never going back there again
M S.,"Glendale, CA",1,86,66,3.0,2/2/2014,"Don't order the Vietnamese summer rolls. They're cold!   The serve was disappointed that we didn't order more food, although we also ordered a steak (which was tasty).  there is a huge selection of items to choose from."
Thomas S.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,1,4.0,4/15/2015,"Great time at this restaurant. Food was good, great atmosphere but just a but too busy when I went so not the best service. Overall I would come back here and try other items on the menu. I recommend the pasta :)"
Cameron P.,"Los Angeles, CA",360,353,399,1.0,10/2/2012,"Look, we're not living in easy times. The economy's in the shitter, both sides of the major political parties are equally frustrating, and I'm fairly certain that with this crazy ass weather that can't make up it's mind (guess that's why it's MOTHER Nature) we're close to a major earthquake in LA any minute. So if you're a waiter at an established eatery like The Cheesecake Factory and you have a table full of paying patrons, then WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU ADD TO THE STRESSES OF THE WORLD AND MAKE IT BLATANTLY OBVIOUS TO WANT US TO LEAVE?! Asshole waiter (whatever your name is), I realize that maybe we didn't drink as much as you would have liked us to in order to raise the tab (thus raising your expected tip) but we DID ORDER FOOD, WE DID ORDER DRINKS, WE WERE EXTREMELY POLITE, WE WERE QUITE ACCOMMODATING TO YOUR BUSY SHIFT, and most importantly, WE PAID OUR BILL INSTANTLY PLUS A 20% TIP! Truth be told, it's a testament to our level of sobriety and manners that we left anything for this waiter at all. Cause folks, he was the very definition of an unprofessional, unpleasant employee of the service industry. Look, I certainly don't fault people for having a bad day. Everyone has those and is entitled to vent. JUST DON'T DO IT TO YOUR PAYING CUSTOMERS WHO ARE TRYING TO RELAX AFTER A LONG WEEK OURSELVES. It's sort of like our stresses and work week extended out past our clock out time at the office. Not cool. Definitely NOT coming back to this particular Factory again and probably will not return to other cheesecakes as well. Factory, you sir, have lost a customer. Over and out."
Marney V.,"Long Beach, CA",23,13,4,3.0,1/31/2014,"Things have changed! Yummy food is now blunt! And serving size is smaller now. And may I suggest LIGHTING SYSTEM is so horrible -you cannot appreciate the beauty of interior -because the dimness is too much. Feels like always Halloween. Nevertheless, it compliments the room(s) for improvement because service is good."
Dave T.,"Burbank, CA",46,71,24,3.0,12/27/2014,Had a Cosmo - ehhh not good at all. If your use to having Cosmo this is not the place for it.
Alexis A.,"Glendale, CA",65,95,22,1.0,7/29/2015,I come to cheesecake once a month or so. There's always a long wait to be seated so I usually avoid it. Today my friend and I went and got seated right away. Our waiter greeted us took our order brought our drinks. One star for that! Now the waiting game begun. We decided to get the buffalo blasts for appetizer and share a chicken avocado sandwich. Our appetizer came out pretty quick and tasted great! Then came out our sandwich after hmmmm a good 30 minutes or so. Got this nice looking sandwhich that tasted not so nice! Let me start off by saying the chicken was disgusting! It was not chewable and no it wasn't dry something was just wrong with it. I was chewing chewing chewing and I couldn't swallow it! Then finally I drank water and somehow took my food down. Then my friend had the same exact problem. We both ate a little but got really disgusted! Oh and as a matter of fact it was not even busy. So I'm curious why my sandwich was made so poorly. Moving forward..... A few hours pass we both felt nauseous and our stomachs have been hurting. If I could give 0 stars I totally would! The quality has dropped drastically!! Sorry  cheesecake but you just lost 2 customers!
Marissa A.,"Burbank, CA",18,71,169,4.0,12/7/2012,"Ok...so in all fairness, we visited on a Friday night (heavy dinner-out night)...but nonetheless, our food was prompt, hot and yummy.  The restaurant was crowded so we opted to sit outside.  Even though there was a light sprinkle and a chill in the air.  There were umbrellas and heatlamps...so we were great!   I am mostly writing today about the service.  I realize that servers have to start somewhere.  I am hoping that, for our server that night, that is the case.  He was so attentive, observant, polite, charming, professional and on the money...he deserves a promotion!  Headwaiter?  A move to a more upscale restaurant (sorry Cheesecake)?  He was just so fantastic!  I wish I could have tipped him more...but because our bill was so reasonable he may have thought we were requesting ""favors"".  Thank you for a great dinner.  Even in the rain!!!"
Alyan S.,"Granada Hills, CA",89,15,,1.0,11/22/2014,Horrible service they never tell you how long do you have to wait you can't get my business with lying to me. Such disappointment for the cheesecake factory name.
Kimberly N.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",860,101,35,5.0,5/6/2014,"This is one of the bigger Cheesecake Factory locations. They have a great staff, food is always good, other locations can be hit or miss, they are consistent. They have a great year round patio that is always welcoming to pups. We will always support a place that respects and welcomes our 4 legged child. He's better behaved the most 2 legged ones!"
