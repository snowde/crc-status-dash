Greg V.,"North Hollywood, CA",50,61,159,5.0,10/14/2014,I'm going here very often. Love the good the service and location. If you have to bring done guest in here or have dinner with your loved one. Try it out. My favoring dish is chicken Romano and chicken Madera. Not to talk about cheesecakes. They are the best!!!
J V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/14/2014,"Let me start by saying that the food was not the problem, it was actually good. The problem was the service. The bathroom was really dirty, no seat covers and was almost out of toilet paper, also there was napkins all over the floor. I decided to let one of the employees know, and instead of being thankful that it was even brought up to their attention she seemed really annoyed and dismissive.  The waitress was just ok, hardly saw her. Maybe it was because it was a busy night. Anyway the wait to be seated was also long. Been here before and this is the first time the service was this bad."
Florencio A.,"Panorama City, CA",11,24,11,5.0,2/20/2011,"Pros: 1. Hibachi Steak was delicious and so tender 2. Mushroom burger was best ever 3. Calamari was bomb! 4. Service (Dominique) = A+ 5. Architecture was beautiful Cons: 1. Steak was a bit too salty and too dark (soy sauce?) so A- 2. Fries portion was too small Bottom Line = A Best value compared to other chains, and even fine dining Providence on Melrose."
Yana K.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,49,69,5.0,12/12/2014,"Always good and fresh, and always line here:)) but it's ok :)) food is delicious and cheesecake!!! Yami, my favorite is tiramisu :))"
Helen C.,"Torrance, CA",36,505,126,2.0,1/20/2013,"We ordered: WARM ASPARAGUS SALAD: this was very good... especially with the egg on top FRIED ZUCCHINI, PORTABELLO MUSHROOM, AVOCADO: It was a little too breaded for me... the fried avocado was interesting... not sure I liked the texture CAESAR SALAD: this was very good... slightly over dressed, but very good NACHOS.. i liked this a lot bc it was very simple and clean tasting.. no beans SKINNYLICIOUS SHRIMP CREOLE: not great.. did not like the texture of the shrimp and the sauce was meh."
Laura S.,"Pasadena, CA",948,1507,6131,3.0,5/19/2011,"I hate and love the fact that this place puts calories... but it limits what you can eat.  FOOD: I ordered the Vietnamese Tacos: Steamed Asian Buns with Roasted Pork, Marinated Cucumbers, Carrots and Onion with Chiles, Cilantro and Sesame Seeds. They were good. I love the Asian buns (who doesn't?). You get three small ones because this is from the Small Plate Menu and it was the only one less than 500 calories - yes I was worried.  I'm sure the other food is good and I've had it in the past, but now with the calories showing... I am too scared to eat something over 600 calories in ONE sitting.  ALCOHOL: Got some cocktails and they were ok. They weren't strong but I actually like that because I don't want to get drunk but for those who buy alcohol for the alcohol... this is not for you. LOCATION: Parking in Americana (3 hours free with validation) Parking also at Target and Glendale Galleria for free Around lots of shopping and Americana is pretty. AMBIANCE: Busy. This is a typical Cheesecake Factory look.  It's always busy! Always.  SERVICE:  Busy... this place is always busy and hence, they were busy... but good note, they do take multiple credit cards.  Why a 3? I don't like waiting for more than 30 minutes at a chain restaurant... if it was a small popular non-chain, I'd be ok with waiting.  Also, the calories - I'm glad they post it but man... make some meals less than 500 calories pleaseeee."
Anna C.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,26,10,4.0,10/27/2012,"One dish that I ALWAYS go for, without fail: Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic.  Seriously? This pasta just makes my day and lights up my life... :)  The gumbo is another personal favorite when I'm sick.. Mmm..gumbo... I salivate just thinking about it...  Despite the long lines, I always got seated relatively fast, perhaps due to the fact that my parties are usually no larger than 5... so no complaints there~  Yes, I am a fan :)"
Alejandra S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,149,4,3.0,11/8/2014,"Food is usually pretty good and service too. You can pretty much come here anytime u r craving anything, the menu is so extensive."
Luiza T.,"Burbank, CA",0,8,4,5.0,1/19/2016,"This is a go to date night restaurant for my boyfriend and I. We have been coming here for years and absolutely love their food. The calamari here is our favorite calamari for sure! The service is great, and even though the wait is about an hour on the weekends it's okay because there is so much to do in the Americana that that hour passes by so quickly. Will always be a returning customer!"
Nicolette V.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",1,18,6,2.0,12/23/2014,I don't understand why the workers here are so rude. I think the only reason this place is doing well is because of the location. It is very beautiful to sit outside and look at the fountain and the food is OK but they really need to hire new people. Waiters are very unwelcoming and are tired and cranky all the time.
Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,1.0,9/3/2012,"Sigh. I was extremely saddened by my one and only time at this place. Our waiter was so bad that I don't think I'll ever be back.  First off, this place is a zoo. It is not organized, people here are rude too. Luckily our wait was not too long and the table accommodated my daughter and her stroller. We were seated outside and it was a nice, warm night. No complaints until we met our waiter. This guy didn't seem to know anything and had zero personality. Granted, he could have been new, but really, he didn't know ANYTHING.  I asked if they validated, he said he didn't know. I ordered a to go meal for my husband and wanted to order a small cheesecake to take home, not a slice, and he told me that the small cheesecakes were $30 to $40. I really should have checked online (why the hell don't they list dessert prices on the damn menu?) because they really were $23. I wasn't going to spend the price that he stated on that cheesecake so I passed. But I have to ask, what kind of a waiter doesn't know what a small cheesecake is? Before our price conversation happened he actually came out with just a slice of cheesecake to go. That was NOT what I asked for. So much for listening skills. He also had major attitude when he was asked if we could have a side of lemon wedges for our iced tea, as he served us all iced tea without any lemons at all. I ask again, who does that? We were each given a side of lemon wedges on a cocktail napkin and not in a small dish or bowl. Service was turtle slow, it took him a half hour to bring us our checks. When he was asked to put my to go order on a separate check, he got confused and put it all on the same check and asked us to put numbers by what was on each check. Really now. Don't think I'll ever go through the trouble of eating here ever again."
Antuan M.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",3,8,,5.0,7/21/2014,"Don't know where to start. this place became one of my favorite restaurants. food quality is excellent, extremely tasty food of all kinds.

Sergio G.,"Castro Valley, CA",506,582,1798,5.0,7/28/2010,"What a wonderful wonderful place to eat at. In our stay at Burbank the night before going to Universal Studios the kids and the wife wanted to do more shopping. Once they saw the sign to "" The Cheesecake Factory "" they all of a sudden got hungry?? ( yeah go figure )  The restaurant is located in a super nice mall on Americana way. The wait was only 20 minutes and the food was wonderful. The waitress was super friendly and we did birthday dinner for Sara & Gaspar ( nephew ). I had the Hibachi steak with Tempura Asparagus, Bean sprouts and mashed potatoes. My wife had the Pasta Da Vinci, Sofia of course had a burger, Sara and Gaspar had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane.  The service was great and they got their happy birthday song that was the highlight of the night.  $$$ was decent but who care? We're on Vacation and the food was great."
Sharon S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",3,24,,4.0,2/5/2013,"The only reason I am giving The Cheesecake Factory 4 stars is because of the wait time.  It's not their fault, really.  In fact, it probably is a plus.  In the several times that I've eaten at this location, I've never felt rushed.  Perhaps that is why there is usually a crowd to get in to this restaurant. One thing I can count on is good, consistent food.  The waiters are very nice, and accommodating to special requests.  Refills on drinks are ample, and without having to ask. Good service - consistent food.  Servings are ample. If you are able, enjoy dining on the patio.  Great ""people watching"" and a really pleasant atmosphere."
Andy L.,"Alhambra, CA",49,29,3,5.0,11/23/2015,Has one of the best customer service experience anyone can ask for. The guy named Gordon was extremely attentive and knew the menu really well. He came back numerous times and gave bread and water refills with a smile on his face. Will gladly come back.
Christina A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",125,1,1,1.0,11/19/2015,"This place deserves a 0 for service. They are very unorganized, it took us 2.5 hours to get a table. When we were finally seated, three people were crammed into one small table. If you can, I encourage you to avoid this place."
Lyn G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,3,2.0,10/26/2014,"Long lines, followed by kids in tantrum mode I'm sure it's because the hour plus wait time. By the time we were seated and were served 2.5 hrs  was too hungry to notice that my bang bang chicken was missing shrimp. ugh well should checked this place out before going. Overall way way too long of a wait. skip!"
Cesar T.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,49,15,5.0,12/16/2014,"Chicken Louisiana Pasta my favorite. You also can't go wrong with the Hibachi steak w/ asparagus, mash potatoes, and a great sauce to go with it. The whole wheat bread is to die for. One of the best complimentary breads served out there haven't anything better than the one here at Cheesecake. Come here for brunch with my wife very often. Great pastas and a variety of very delicious salads."
Robert S.,"Glendale, CA",22,63,69,4.0,9/23/2013,The cheesecake factory at he Americana is my families go to for dinner or desserts. My go to dinner here is the spicy cashew chicken. That meal is WOW good!!! -Cheers-
Matthew S.,"Chattanooga, TN",18,103,2,4.0,4/4/2013,We were fortunate enough to get in before the lunch rush on a weekday. Very good service and large portions. I had the chicken and biscuits and it did not disappoint. However my friend tried the teriyaki chicken and was disappointed due to the lack of white meat. Lettuce wraps portions were much smaller than expected. Only 4 small pieces of chicken and lots of lettuce. Menu here has terrific variety and that keepsake coming back. And the cheesecake of course.
