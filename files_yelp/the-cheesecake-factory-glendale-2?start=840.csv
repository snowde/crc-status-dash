Danny R.,"Burbank, CA",119,61,58,2.0,10/4/2014,It's a Cheesecake Factory and I'm just not a big fan. There's really nothing more I can say about it.
Talin Z.,"Burbank, CA",22,69,5,2.0,7/3/2014,"food is good, but utensils are always so filthy. I always ask for plastic utensils due to the lack of cleanliness of their china.  Sometimes the food is cooked to perfection and sometimes the kitchen totally does the opposite.  overall food is good, just need to work on the cleanliness of the restaurant"
Brenda G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/9/2016,"I would give it a 3 star but the wait time to be seated was not worth it. It was an hour and a half wait on a Saturday night (kind of expected judging by the older reviews). With that said the waitress was great but the food not so much. I've never tasted fettuccine alfredo so bland before. Such a huge disappointment. The sauce was watery on both the fettuccine and the marina sauce for the mozzarella appetizer, which I wasn't impressed with either. I'm willing to give it another try just not during prime time and maybe next time I'll try a steak plate."
Daniele G. L.,"Tampa Bay, FL",65,28,4,4.0,11/21/2012,Very nice service & good food! Requested a chicken type milanese plate and they got it exactly right. Cooked as it should be and very good taste. - I could go anytime at The Cheesecake Factory and is going to be a winner!
Brenda M.,"Glendale, CA",67,8,,1.0,1/9/2016,"Never again will I go back, took 25 mins to get our appetizer out after the server asked us if we ordered when she was the one who took our order and then I grabbed the manager because it took too long after the server saw us! Then the food took another 15 mins after the appetizer came by that time I wasn't even hungry anymore. After, when we took a few bites we asked for the check and I wrote down that the soup and salad was on my card and the burger on another, she still got it wrong and I had to get the manager for the second time to charge us the correct amount, I'd get it if we were a big group but it was literally just us two and the soup was cold by the time I got it but after waiting 40 mins for it, I didn't even want to wait anymore. Never again, this location's service is always terrible and I'm a server so I have a lot of patience when it comes to servers but this place is just terrible!"
Yolanda Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,2,1,4.0,12/4/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory! Be ready to wait up to an hour for a text message letting you know your table is ready..

Zachary C.,"Los Angeles, CA",299,25,16,5.0,11/21/2012,"Fried Calamari $5  Ultimate Nachos $5  Getting wasted on $5 cocktails and 4$ drafts, Priceless!  Five stars to their happy hour (Mon. - Fri. 4pm-6pm) These guys dont play around, portions are HUGE. Went with a buddy for some snacking... ended up taking leftovers home. oh yesssssss."
Rose S.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,215,430,3.0,7/15/2012,"Surprising I have not wrote a review of this place yet. Well here it is.  Went here with my bff, bff's brother and his girlfriend for dinner. Normally this place is ok to eat out sometimes if I want to get some cheesecake or eat their bread. This location is kind of bad because well it gets extremely crowded on weekends except for when we came. I expected at least 10-20min wait but I was wrong it was more like a 5min wait.  Our waiter I think his name is Brandon/Brendon or something like that. He was nice and very patient with us when we were waiting for my bff's brother. He also had a very energetic feel (I like). Although it felt like we were a bit ignored when we wanted more bread or wanted to order some cheesecakes.  So I love love love their bread so fresh and so good lol. For starters the bff wanted some wontons, so she got 'Chicken Wontons'. it was good but it was also way to salty. High in sodium anyone? So here were our entrees  Mine-  The Stuffed Chicken Tortilla no cilantro smothered with cheese on top and tomatoes with black beans and a corn bread topped with sour cream. This meal was GREAT! Normally when I come here I get something fried or pasta good thing I did not make that move. I would gladly recommend this dish and would get it again when I come back. BFF - Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, she seemed to enjoy it a little except for the toasted coconut flakes on top. Although she kept staring at every ones food. It displayed with a massive amount of rice (brown) in the center than surrounded with fried chicken and like 5pcs of shrimp topped with toasted coconut flakes. In my opinion it looked good but I did not try.  BFF's bro gf - Grande Burrito Factory - this thing is HUGE, (I know because the bf got this before). So she seemed to enjoy it a little too. She complained that it had way too much rice in it which I kind of agreed. She gave my bff one end of the burrito and it contained mostly rice than anything else.  BFF's bro - the most expensive meal out all of us. Herb Crusted Salmon & Shrimp, for a $20 meal I would find this as a disappointment. For that price you can get more for your buck elsewhere even with those options. Salmon was like 3 little pieces and well this wasn't your average size shrimp they normally serve - more like a little bigger and only got 4pcs. Mashed potatoes right on the center and asparagus on the side. I wish I could've took a picture of this food.  After getting our grub on, we waited for quite some time for me get a to go box and for our waiter to let us order some cheesecakes. Was also another wait to get our check. It was busy but it was not extremely busy.  Overall our waiter was very helpful and happy to be there even though we got a little ignored. Pointers when he noticed our drinks and gave us new glasses. That was awesome!  P.S. I got the Red Velvet cheesecake to go and I was very disappointed. It was too sweet for my palette and the red velvet was not as red as I like it to be. It also did not seem so flavorful. That was a disappointment."
Tongie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,53,23,5.0,11/14/2012,"This place is absolutely fantabulous!!! My son and I have eaten there four (4) times this week...the ambiance, the staff and just being in the ""mix"" of great company and please let's not forget the food...with such large portions, I had leftovers each time I frequented the establishment...a hearty ""thank you"" to Wendii who made our dining very special... Best, Tongie"
John T.,"Glendale, CA",2,7,,5.0,2/7/2015,"Went to Cheesecake Factory at Americana for lunch with a couple of friends.  The waiter, who was absolutely fantastic, suggested we try some of the new additions to their menu.  We agrees to order a few and split them among us.  First was the Eggplant Parmesan.  Was the closest recipe to my grandmother homemade eggplant that I've ever had!!  Amazing!!  With a side of Angel Hair pasta with pesto that is to die for!!  I cannot recommend this enough! Next we tried they new pulled pork sandwich with bacon!  The meat was juicy and lean.  Melted in your mouth with a BBQ sauce that had just the right amount of ""bite"" to it.  The thick cut, smoked bacon just added to the flair!!  A must order if you're a fan or BBQ or pulled pork! Next up we the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp dish.  This is very similar to their version of Orange Chicken and Shrimp.  Big generous pieces of both and the rice was very flavorful .  This was yet another winner and was completely devoured!! Finally we had the Herb Crusted Chicken Filets with a side of mashed potatoes.  Made to perfection!!  You could cut the chicken with your fork and the lightly crusted herb topping was perfect!!  The mashed potatoes were home style and chunky!!  With such a huge selection to choose from it's always nice to try something new!!  I highly recommend any of the four items above and out service could not have been any better!!  An all around enjoyable experience and one that will keep me coming back many times again!!!"
Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61,4.0,6/6/2012,"Love this location...  Came here to get some appetizers and dessert...  Got seated within 15 min outside.... they were really busy it was very obvious that the waiters were running around like chickens with their heads cut off....  I asked the waiter to turn on the heater as soon as we got seated, he said he'll get someone to come by and close the umbrellas down so they can turn it on.  He got our drink orders, and I asked him to bring us the balsamic vinaigrette with the bread... He forgot to bring it, but got it with the second basket of the bread when we reminded him. =] (we were nice about it too) Ordered the Nachos....  After about 20 min the waiter came by and said they had messed up the order so if we wanted a cup of the soup of the day while we waited, and he was very nice about it. We took his offer and got the lentil soup (he brought us a bowl instead of a cup) Then the Nachos came...  WOW! Never have I had Nachos that taste so horrible. The cheese was not melted, there was barely any ingredients on it. It was just so bland.  The BF and I NEVER EVER EVER complain about the food that we get. It has to be sooooo horribly wrong that we MIGHT say something...  Bf said ""I don't mean to be sounding rude or offend YOU in anyway, but could you tell the chef that this was by far the worst nachos we've ever had. It had no taste what so ever, so we were dipping the chips into the soup to get some flavor"" Nice waiter apologized and came back saying the chef said he would be happy to make another one, we said it was ok and we just wanted to mention it. Then he left and came back and asked us to order something else so they could make it up to us.. .we just got a Tiramisu and IT WAS FANTASTIC.... we were planning on getting it anyways.. =]  Bill came, he had only charged us for the nachos...  soup, dessert, nachos  plus tax = $13!!!!! We waaay over tipped him just for his service...  after we paid and got up they turned the heater on! =]"
Julia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,42,6,4.0,4/12/2013,"So, of course I've been here a million times before as a carnivore and also as a vegetarian but yesterday was my first time as a vegan. To start, I got the moscato wine (yum!!) and a guacamole appetizer with my boyfriend. I didn't eat the tortilla chips (wasn't sure if they were vegan) but the guacamole was satisfying. For my meal I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wrap with no chicken/portabello mushrooms instead. When I said ""no chicken"" to my waiter, his eyes nearly popped out of his head and he was in such a state of disbelief that a person could not want chicken in their meal that he had to ask me again, ""so, that's no chicken?"".  None-the-less, it was surprisingly very, very tasty. Sadly, thats about the only vegan thing on their menu! The Skinnylicious Veggie Burger sans the mayo and cheese might be vegan, but that depends on the ingredients in the bread. Cheesecake Factory -- please, in the future, have more vegan items!"
Jill H.,"Glendale, CA",18,8,18,5.0,8/31/2012,"I'm a creature of habit here and always order the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I also only eat about half because it's So Much . . . so here's my leftovers :)  btw, they're Awesome!!"
Michael M.,"Glendale, CA",241,53,45,4.0,9/12/2014,"Our service is always good, but it's also always loud. Even when it's not full it's like eating at Dodger's Stadium volume. Good food, good service, but not a place to go if you want a quiet relaxing lunch/dinner. Tip: order 1 cheesecake slice to share for two to three people as they are quite large."
Winnie L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1014,858,39789,3.0,7/31/2008,"Thumbs up for $1.50 Cheesecake  Thumbs up to our waiter for his attentive service at the bar area  Thumbs down for explosive diarrhea Thumbs down for Cheesecake Factory, the whole chain/concept Today Cheesecake Factory was offering their 30th anniversary special with $1.50 slices of cheesecake.  Lured by the gimmick (like those 'buy more to save more' ones), we decided to take advantage on the discount on dessert. My friends grabbed a table early at the bar and we had excellent service by our waiter.  Great directions to our friend on the road, meaningful answers to questions, complimentary extra guacamole, etc.  We gave the waiter a 25% tip. I had the rye bread, a Factory Bellini, and nachos.  It tasted great going down, but within a short time of leaving, I started to feel sick.   Let's just say driving while your intestines are about to explode + your exit from the freeway to go home is blocked off = not a good time.  I usually get the same explosive feelings when i eat kimchi from korean places.  I'm just thankful that I made it to my bathroom before unleashing a bowl of fury. In general, I'm just not a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  Nothing in the menu excites me like the ones at hole-in-the-walls do, although I do find things I would like to try if I am obligated to eat there.  I just feel like it's an overpriced excuse to eat together. see pics"
Matt H.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,49,636,5.0,10/31/2010,"You do't really expect a lot from The Cheesecake Factory... it is, after all, a factory. You certainly don't expect great service, especially not on a Saturday afternoon when the place is inundated with stroller types.  However, Tracy, at the Americana at Brand location, was a marvel!!! She knew the (honestly way too extensive) menu backwards and forwards, had a great upbeat (and not overly perky) demeanor, was quick, was smart, dealt with the family next to us in a wonderful way... She was one of the most professional servers I've ever had, and certainly better than any of the arrogant, privileged and self-satisfied waiters at places like Grace, Comme Ca, and most recently, BLT. Don't assume you'll get mediocre service at a casual dining restaurant (in the same way, don't expect you'll get good service at a high-end restaurant)... you may be lucky to be waited on by Tracy!!!"
Allyson E.,"Los Angeles, CA",962,418,2162,4.0,8/19/2010,"One of my favorite Cheesecake factory locations... Doesnt get as packed as the one at the Grove, and its just as nice or maybe nicer,,,, Service is always great, Foods always deicious, i always have a fantastic experience here whether im just having a casual lunch, out with the girls, or on a date with my bu. ...even if its too packed i just go on straight to the bar.."
Katie G.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,1,5.0,12/20/2015,"Had lunch and was waited on by server: ""Bahan Z"" - awesome service and the food was good!"
