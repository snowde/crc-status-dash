Nicole H.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",61,48,2,5.0,4/30/2013,"My go to place for GNO, date night or a family get together. You can never go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory!  My favorites: Appetizers- Fried Macaroni and Cheese & Buffalo Chicken Blasts Cocktails- Strawberry Martini & Pomegranate Margarita Entrees- Louisiana Chicken, Jambalaya & any other of their huge salads!  Dessert- Red Velvet Cheesecake & Oreo Cheesecake. Just talking about these makes me want to go there right now!"
Tina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2231,326,1248,3.0,5/3/2010,"Okay really? Why me... I came in with a couple of my friends, ordered the Thai lettuce wrap; the lettuce came out dirty, not once but two times. What's going on? Okay... I have to agree that the Fried Zucchini appetizer I had ordered (along with the lettuce wrap) was delicious. After... when my entree of Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp came out... which was delicious (extra sauce please) hit the spot! Kind of paid off for the dirty Thai Lettuce Wraps. Overall... the service was remarkable and the speedy sitting down service; including the entrees were delightful. I do recommend coming here, since their foods are amazing, but do check your food before you eat. You may just be eating dirt! C+ 3 STARS"
Sara A.,"Glendale, CA",136,180,30,3.0,9/18/2012,"There are certain reviews one feels rather silly writing. This is one of those reviews for me. Not because funny things happen here, just because the Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory. You know every time exactly what you will be getting, which for some is very nice because it's safe. It's a very corporate restaurant and well done at that. I mean lets face it, when is the place not packed? This location looks almost identical to other locations - aside from the lucky ducks at the Marina Del Rey location on the water.  I occasionally find myself here when strolling the Americana (aka I am obsessed with Anthropologie) and feel the need for a little bite or drink. For this it is perfect. Shopping, appetizer, drink. That's usually what happens. I do appreciate that they now have the small plates menu and healthy menu. That's pretty much that. End."
Raquel L.,"West Covina, CA",25,97,6,4.0,3/7/2013,"A friend and I came here for lunch on a Friday, so we experienced some of the ""rush rush"" atmosphere that others had mentioned but it wasn't to terrible. Once seated we had a wonderful waiter!! I would go back here just for ALVIN. He was so funny, and he would break out into song or dance out of no where. I didn't realize we would experience a show with lunch!  We each got a salad ( I got the skinnylicious chopped salad, and my friend got The Carlton salad) both were very tasty and had ingredients that paired well with one another."
Youbi K.,"Burbank, CA",56,60,13,4.0,7/6/2013,Basil pesto with chicken tomato Quesadilla with chicken and avocado eggrolls are a must !!
Yerin k.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,1.0,11/1/2015,There was a piece of cardboard in my food. NEVER coming here again. Been feeling sick ALL day after. I feel like throwing up constantly.
Jacky D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,61,94,5.0,9/11/2014,"Love everything on their menu..some of favs are chicken samosas, spicy chipotle chicken pasta, chicken jambalaya, mango key lime cheesecake, hersheys chocolate cheesecake, godiva brownie sundae"
Richard K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,172,7,4.0,8/1/2014,Long wait and had to yell at the manager for forgetting about us. The food was good and the server was on point. You must be very patient due to the location.
Michael H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",12,82,137,4.0,5/4/2013,"Located in the Glendale galleria, this Cheesecake location is huge. Even on a Saturday afternoon at lunch time the wait wasn't very bad (less than 15 minutes). Our waiter was excellent and the food was what we've come to expect from Cheesecake factory (good quality, large portions, and not very expensive). The outside seating is very nice. If you park in the adjacent garage of the galleria, they will validate parking."
Max V.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,44,,4.0,1/9/2015,"The wait time is 30 min on a busy   is always crowded. as soon as we got seated  we got our bread  and butter right away and that is  great esp after a long day of walking /shopping at the mall .our pasta Alfredo, is good.and i like their passion tea its refreshing. service is great. if you go here on weekdays they have happy hour  appetizers are good and they are about  price right.weeknd just be prepare to wait a little longer.. been here a few times and we always get a good service.next stop FRIDA next door."
Billy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,89,,1.0,7/25/2015,The people here are extremely rude and unfriendly.  We were first greeted by a host that seemed like he was about to quit.  He was the dark tall guy with bleach hair.  The management here also didn't seem friendly at all.   I could go on and on but what's the point.  I won't be coming back.
Sandra R.,"Montebello, CA",0,83,32,5.0,9/23/2014,"I love this place... Went to celebrate a,bday Saturday night..the,wait was an hour ...but here's the great part...

A M.,"Arleta, CA",65,323,114,5.0,7/24/2014,My friend and I came in for a drink before our movie started.  I ordered the blueberry mojito and it was so refreshing and so yummy!  Too bad we had to go.  Staff was great!  Thanks!
Mele R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,10/3/2012,"What:  Dinner ""to go"" Price:  $35-$40 Recommended:   Yes Reasons: 1.  Huge menu.  Tasty dishes for a chain restaurant.    2.  You can hang out at The Americana while you're waiting for your food. 3.  Getting dinner ""to go"" means you can eat in the comfort of your home and avoid paying tip (though we occassionally leave a tip for the person at the counter if s/he is helpful). Other comments: They don't have a dedicated staff member to take phone orders.  It's a person at the bakery multi-tasking between phone orders, plating desserts, making change for the servers, and taking orders from customers at the restaurant.  So, calling ahead with your order can be frustrating sometimes because they place you on hold for a long time.   A better option is to place your order at the restaurant and chill near the fountain or walk around outdoors until your order is ready."
Alla I.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",45,10,,5.0,12/19/2013,"This is my favorite place!!!!!  Food is great (there's always something for everyone), the staff is very friendly, and there's typically no wait. Being right in the Americana also makes it a great location!"
Kevin F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",88,29,1,1.0,12/30/2015,"Worst service ever. Waited 1.5 hours for a ""55 minute wait"". Manager was horrible. Refused to help and lied. Left without eating. Poor staff."
Milton W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,2,2.0,11/22/2015,The waiter was ok the manager who i complained to was even nice but the 'server' guy who brought my tea was a total creep! He was cocky and appeared to be 'high' on something. I'd rather spend my money with someone who appreciates my patronage. Tis the season to lack customer service.. I really hope the manager addressed this situation because this was an extremely uncomfortable encounter.
Gevo Z.,"Tujunga, CA",344,24,,5.0,7/24/2013,"I love this place if i could put 10 stars i would, after having a bad service at a different restaurant  and coming here was all worth it. The service was Amazing the Service was also Amazing, we had an amazing waitress her name was Migalina omg she was fantastic.  At the end this place is a great restaurant you cant go wrong. I do recommend you come here."
Cynthia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,41,43,5.0,4/7/2014,We were told it was a 30min wait but only waited 10min. Waitress was very nice. I had the Louisiana Chicken pasta... very good if you're craving semi spicy pasta. The chicken is breaded ane very good too. I also had an oreo cheesecake to go... yum!
Elliott C.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/19/2012,"Really great cheeseburgers and cheesecakes and butter on bread. The bread and butter was very luxurious and has great soft, heat and sweet quality. I enjoy Cheesecake Factory bread appetizer more than the plain bread containing butter already inside by bakeries.  The Americana and the Macaroni and Cheeseburger was very very delicious, with fries on the side. For me, ketchup is required with this because the heavy meals are so needing it - ketchup to cheese, potato and pure ground beef all together is equivalent to milk to cookie. I had to pause for a bit after halfway eating it but after finishing both burgers I still ordered dessert to be full. CheeseCake Factory proves capable of various culinary tastes. CheeseCake Factory deserves praise for their hardworking efforts and superior talents for how they serve and make food.  The Oreo Cheesecake and the Hot Fudge Sundae were marvelous.  I am willing to judge all the other foods I have not ordered from the menu yet."
