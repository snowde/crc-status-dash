Marin C.,"Glendale, CA",32,35,12,5.0,2/25/2013,"This is one of my husband and I's favorite date night restaurants. The service has always been excellent, and the food is always delicious.  We love sitting in the patio by the fountain, the outdoor music is fantastic at the Americana, and the ambiance is great too.  Plus, you get a water show every hour from the fountain! :) all in all, i love this place."
Karen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,9,146,5.0,10/13/2014,Love Cheesecake Factory as always. But there is an extra star for Mathew ..... Thx dear .
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,674,4,5.0,2/25/2014,"ambiance//***** as my tip says, i HIGHLY recommend outside seating...particularly if you can get a view of the fountain and its show for a mini bellagio experience not to mention lovely cali weather it's what makes this cheesecake special~ the indoors are much more typical set up of cheesecake...and sometimes stuffy as well service//***** oh my goodness! i would give 6 stars if i could because our server, TAMARA just about blew us away ~we had a LARGE party, 8 adults and 3 small children and she handled it like the pro! ~constantly checking on us, bringing things by, making suggestions based on preferences ~her timing was impeccable whether to offer refills or to take group photos ~ brought a lovely birthday cheesecake and entourage to sing for my niece ~ and the list GOES ON!~ very impressive and personable!~ food//**** calamari is always a safe bet! =9 gyoza is pretty standard what impressed me about them is that even though we were a large party with varying orders, they were able to bring everything piping hot and served everyone within 5 minutes of each other ~*~ as far as cheesecakes goes, what sets this one apart was mostly tamara~ if you get her, you're in the hands of an expert!^^"
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1464,987,1073,5.0,2/27/2012,"B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L. With Disneyland resemblances (waterfall ""show"" in the backdrop, perfectly manicured lawn resembling astro-turf, a local ""train"", and picturesque stores...) this is truly a magical place to eat~ Well, all fairytales aside, Cheesecake is a successful :( commercial business :( that we all can't help but LOVEEEEEEEE.  Some get irritated at the pricing, but with the breadbasket (! -- what's your favorite, the wheat or french??), the goblets of water (!! fancy!!), the fiesta style plates of pasta (flakes and flakes of seasoning / peppers / flaky goodies), the freshest parmesan cheese in the world (sigh this is Italy huh), and the list goes on.... well one annoying thing is the cheesecakes that start at ~$7... sigh, so luxurious to those who order, ... but anyways, there lunch size portions are still *hefty* and *left-over friendly* (girls speaking).   If you want a more authentic restaurant, I don't know what to suggest.  Cheesecake is like McDonalds.  It's the same regardless of the location, even though some locations are better than others, and it's a universally great place to celebrate any location~ happy birthday~ and you will never be let down by the wonderful white-clad staff. ** love the chicken chipotle pasta --- would be **perfect** with red pepper, but black peppers is alright, just wish they made it SPICIER.  the chicken is tender and not over cooked and not in huge SLABS that have no sauce and you have to cut.  so perfect~ ** factory burger is GIANT, don't compare the burgers to mcdonalds please and how much value you could receive from there, because mcdonalds doesn't give free bread FTW!   ** fries are one of my favorite food(s) group(s) and these were a nice 7ish/10."
Evan P.,"Glendale, CA",8,26,50,4.0,5/15/2013,Well wait was way too long tonight. Glass was dirty BUT service was great by Monica our waitress she change  it all food is great.

Great job Monica i hope they read this. Great night all together....
Christina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,112,35,4.0,1/8/2013,I come here a lot with my mom. She really likes this place. I usually stick to the same thing cause some of the food is kinda on the bland side. The portions here are enormous so I usually split my order with someone. Their lunch specials are great and the portions are plenty as well. The waiters are friendly and try their best to accommodate to your needs.  P.S. This place validates parking.
Mimi A.,"Ventura County, CA",35,20,11,1.0,4/13/2015,"Slow and horrible service. Make sure you check your spoons, forks, and knives. We had to request for a new set 3 times because they had food on it. Their water glasses are old and should be replaced at least every couple of months. We had to ask for new glasses because they looked so gross to drink out of. Expect slow service because the place is just too busy with too many people. Very disappointed with this Cheesecake in particular. All the ones I've been to don't have this problem. Good Luck!"
Matthew S.,"Long Beach, CA",17,36,1,5.0,9/4/2014,Best chicken I've ever tasted!!! I ordered the cachou chicken.
Billy K.,"Honolulu, HI",12,32,26,1.0,7/23/2015,"Went there on 7/22. Worst experience ever. I ordered the mushroom soup, ribeye steak, and pasta with shrimp and sausages. It was multiple screw ups tonight. First I cut my lips on a chipped glass. Then they drop off a steak 30 secs after my soup came with wrong starch. Later to find out that it wasn't my steak. Then my steak came and brought me the wrong starch again. I order my steak rare and it came out med/rare and dry. I was so hungry I tried to eat it but I only can  finish half the steak because it was so salty and dry. Later on manager came by ask me what my opinion is and I gave her my 2 cents. Obviously the steak and the pasta was fire at the same time. So the steak dried out under the heat lamp hence all the juice came out. That is why the steak was swimming in plate. What kill me even more after the night of horror is the manager. She came up never introduced herself and said I ate too much of the steak lol. came back with the check and said "" try to run a business here so I only charge you for the steak and wine"". Cheesecake factory is one of my all time favorite because of the consistency. The kitchen and the front of the house has successfully made me not want to go back to any Cheesecake Factory again. One bad apple makes the bunch look bad"
Frederick D.,"Glendale, CA",14,1,,3.0,11/3/2015,"Our server was really nice, which is why I'm giving 3 stars. However, it was not so busy when we came in, and two other tables received their bread before us even though we were seated before them. My gf also ordered a lemonade which was somehow completely forgotten. Then once again, the food for the other two tables came WAY before ours. I understand servers can get busy. But the fact that we were there first and got served last sucked. Isn't that the reason there are food runners in the first place?"
Juan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/11/2014,"I love this place, I always get great service and I love their burgers.  Ive only been there On weekends at night and it's really packed, sometimes 2 hour wait but it's worth it."
Tim E.,"Brea, CA",631,1154,2475,2.0,8/31/2010,"We came here about a two week ago for desserts and have been experiencing some really bad restaurant quality food. Why is this happening to me? You would think that Cheesecake factory the home of the cheesecake and would have awesome cheese cake and desserts, right?   When we first got here the wait time was a approximate 40 minute wait. I glanced over to the bar to see if there were any seats open cause if you didn't know you can sit their and eat too.  Minutes pass and I was getting agitated because I really wanted some sweets in my mouth. Bam! the vibrating thing a ma ding rang. we got seated and we ordered the Godiva Chocolate cake and two scoops of vanilla ice cream and the Red Velvet cheese cake.  Man I was thinking  we are in for some yummy treats. Well guess again. My chocolate cake was hard as a rock and the whipping cream was probably just taken out of the freezer cause it didn't move and it was so heavy I wanted to barf.  Neither the two desserts had a standing ovation or an applause. I felt so cheated. We left unhappy and hungry.  I probably won't be back anytime soon for their are other places to eat near here."
Carolina H.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",16,68,25,1.0,8/3/2014,There was a fly on one of their cakes! I wanted some dessert but after seeing this it was a complete turn off!
Sherin O.,"Temple City, CA",3,11,,5.0,7/15/2012,"Always filled with great customer service, to whichever Cheesecake Factory I go to. Never once have I been disappointed. It's always funny to see how the waiters/waitresses ask if you need refills on drinks, but you don't want to waste because you know you won't be able to finish the whole thing, and so you tell them it's okay. And they double check and ask if we're sure. I think that's very  nice of them. :) Great ambiance!"
Jennifer H.,"Poway, CA",1,24,,4.0,9/22/2014,"This place was so busy all the time like every other cheese cake factory stores. We checked in, the host told us 45 mins wait and they will text us when it ready.  55 mins later still waiting.  We checked back she said she tried to text us but did not get through... I think she trained to says this to everyone,  so DON'T WAIT FOR THEIR TEXT. They DO VALIDATED your parking ticket for the MAX of 3 HOURS. Good food except my husband did not like the factory burger it used dry/hard bread for the burger,  luckily my husband had very good teeth.  Otherwise,  our others food were good.  Our server was extremely nice even though I know she was tired because end of the day.  Less one star for them because the text did not come as they promised and the hard bread burger."
Ruzan A.,"Glendale, CA",27,16,,5.0,1/4/2013,"I just wanted to mention the service, It was my little sisters birthday and we were a party of 17. I walked in at 4:40 and asked when we can be seated and they said 20 minutes, and they did seat us at 5:05 to be exact, I was actually shocked I thought we would wait so much longer on a Friday. However, they were fast! our waitress Lauren was the best waitress that i have ever encountered coming to Cheesecake.  I've had another big party here before and two servers served us but they didn't do a better job than Lauren, who took care of everything by herself. She was patient, and always came by to ask how we were.  The manager was nice and helpful too. So the five stars is for the service. Thanks Lauren!!  * Since we were a big party gratitude was 18%*"
Karena H.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,171,20,4.0,8/18/2014,Great Kale/Quinoa Salad. Delicious Garlic Noodles. Good Service.
Narine N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,,1.0,5/16/2014,I had a very bad experience here frist my niece found a hair in her food then my sister found used toothpick with pink lipstick on it in her meshed potato it was terrible the words cant describe what we felt there and then no meter how many times the managers said they are very sorry that didn't fix anything we left the restorant hungry
Lyn M.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,10,,5.0,10/16/2015,"My family and I, a group of 10, went out last Sunday to celebrate the anniversary. The best service ever. The waiter( sorry I didn't get his name) was really enthusiasm and energetic. My family were very happy with all the experience on that night. I bet we made his night too cause we gave him the big tip too.. Well, he deserved it!!"
Shelley H.,"Tujunga, CA",65,40,23,1.0,4/2/2015,"I have been here a couple of times. 1st when it opened. that was okay it was busy and basically I had a kick ass server, I remembered I ordered the lemon chicken it was bad. Okay moving on like a year later I had to meet up my mom because she was shopping and got hungry so we meet up and it was 4;30, she was doing the happy hour thing and the waiter was shit. Then like a year later I was coming with a classmate of mine who was nice enough to buy me dessert and the waitress kept flirting with her manager and ignoring us after a few minutes she came over. My classmate was indecisive so I told her to come back in a few, she took our order the second time, proceeded to flirt with her manager again, dropped off the check and it took her like 15 minutes.(Obviously it wasn't busy so customer service should have been awesome but it sorely lacked.) Now I won't even come here because of the fact that the servers are mainly shit and the only time they give decent customer service is when they are packed. NOPE instead I dive to Pasadena much better service."
