Gen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,21,,4.0,10/13/2014,I love this place since I'm such a cheesecake fan! The raspberry lemon cheesecake is my favorite so far. The food is great too just as long as you order right. I've been unlucky a time or two before so choose wisely!
Tim R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,2.0,11/18/2014,"Overrated, overpriced. Food is not bad, but nothing to write home about either, honestly. Serving time is also a bit on the slow side, but the servers are friendly and accomodating."
Leilani H.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,29,8,2.0,2/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant...you can't possibly come here for reviews on the food. It's the same great food you'd get from any of the Cheesecake Factory restaurant...if however you're reading this review to gain a better understanding of the service you'd receive at this particular one, look no further. This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. The grove is far superior. The waiters generally don't make it a point to fill your water throughout the meal...is it just me or should water not be on my mind during my dinner?!? They make me feel like I'm in a drought in some dessert and I have to ration my water out. The last time I went, I asked my server for a side of lemons and she literally brought me three lemons on a makeshift skewer she created out of those sticks they put olives on in Martinis....really? Look MacGyver, stop being lazy and grab a bowl or a cup!! She literally came to my table holding out a skewer of lemons and said to me ""you can grab the other side"" huh?!?!? Why don't you squeeze the lemon juice out for me since you're fingers have already familiarized themselves with the lemons while you were building a raft for them to ride to my dinner plate on."
Greg K.,"Valley Village, Los Angeles, CA",114,30,7,4.0,8/3/2014,"Definitely like this location better then the Sherman Oaks one. The service is MUCH better and last night our waitress, Tasha, was really outgoing and made our experience very pleasant. The food always tastes fresh and their ""skinnylicious"" menu is EVERYTHING."
Armando A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,4.0,11/10/2014,The best cheesecake period. Place has a huge menu so pretty sure everyone in your party can find something they like. One downfall is there is always a wait to get in this place so expect it.
Renee C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/12/2016,So bummed. Went here today for my birthday. I have frequented the marina del Rey location my entire life and have visited other CCFs so I thought this one was a sure thing. I get restaurants get hectic and servers/ hostess' are under all sorts of pressure but the way the hostess & manager spoke to us today was so ridiculous. We were composed and just wanted to understand why after we handed our pager in we had to wait another 40 minutes.  She acted as if we asked her something personally offensive. She obviously forgot about us but instead of speaking to us like an adult she threw a tantrum. This young woman -Jackie-threw up her arms and rolled her eyes as if we were screaming at her. We were finally seated by a super overly nice hostess. I cannot stress enough that we didn't need coddling. We had normal laid back questions met with the worst attitudes. The manager Daniel came to speak to us and was just as bad as Jackie. He didn't care about anything we had to say. Just sucks since now I live near this Cheesecake Factory and I can never visit it as I don't won't to deal with such a wait staff. Thank goodness for our other hostess but just dealing with the first young lady and manager was enough for me and my family to never want to go back.
Kdu b.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,58,4,4.0,6/18/2013,"What a beautiful space!  The decor and lighting in there are fantastic.  Very loud, but I like that.  It's lively, it's bustling.  Been here quite a few times and always enjoyed whatever I ordered - guess that's mostly why it's so hard to decide - everything is good. The visit started out sadly, as I was starving, and there was a 40 min wait.  So we got our buzzy thing, and hit The Americana.  Good thing we didn't go far - we were buzzed in 10 mins!!  Oh sweet........ Tried a new menu item the other night - chile relleno burger.  Our waiter was honest and said it was ""different"" but that he like it well enough.  Sold.  I like different.  Oh yeah!  There was even crispiness to the relleno, and the flavor of the meat is great!  I saved half for the next day and it heated up just fine and I again got to enjoy it.  The waiter we had - Jason I think, was excellent.  He was never far away - and was nice, funny, and efficient.   One complaint - the Ultimate Marg, which is not priced on the menu, but is $12 !!!!  - was good, but definitely not large, but was thankfully strong - two types of tequila, two types of orange liqueur. Mmmm...."
Armenak S.,"Glendale, CA",3,25,15,4.0,8/23/2014,"We went here yesterday for no reason just like why not and I gotta say the cheesecake was so good but thats for the end. The food here was price nice not to much not to little, for what we got it was a lot so if your not hungry don't come here big man big so much food I didn't even finish my stuff, it tasted OK not too good it was like stuff you make at home which isn't bad but not that good either. The waiter and people there where great man thats one of the reasons this place gets a 4. Last but not least I guess the cheese cake , it tasted great so good like I want more but the size of that was not like the size of the food it was mini and expensive, I remember not to long ago they used to have cheese cakes  the size of my head."
Christy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,12,40,5.0,7/24/2014,Instead of waiting for a normal table my husband and I opted for the bar where there were tables available. It was a great choice we had excellent service and the server gave great recommendations. The shepherd's pie was the best I have ever had. The flavor was great and so was his recommended strawberry cheesecake. Definitely going back.
Haykush A.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,4.0,6/9/2016,"i love this place, really fresh drinks there, food was excellent as well, but service sometimes was really slow , that's why only 4 stars, anyway, I'll be back for sure!"""
Laramae E.,"Long Beach, CA",281,490,553,4.0,1/4/2014,"It's nice to know that they finally have the texting system where they will just text you once your table reservation is ready. We waited about 40 minutes on a Thursday night, which I thought wasn't pretty bad. Once we were called, we had to wait another few minutes for them to clean the table for us. As for the atmosphere of Cheesecake Factory, I've always loved the warm feeling of the restaurant with its dim lights and candle lit. Unlimited breads were so addicting (got full before I got my order -_-) I always loved the brown bread, yum. I ordered Chicken Bellagio ($14.50), and it was very delicious. Its portion is huge and the quality is above standard! Crispy chicken breast topped with prosciutto and arugula salad with parmesan cream sauce over basil pasta. It's a big portion that I didn't even finish the pasta ;/ Cousins got two different kind of pasta, and I am not really a fan for their pasta specialties. However the Wild Mushroom burger ($11.95) was delicious. You can taste the sautéed mushroom covered with swiss and fontina cheese, ugh yummy! Service wasn't much of a problem: Sister and the cousins thought that our server was pretty hot, so they managed to handle the tip. Uh yeah, their thirst is reaaaal, haha."
Cassie M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",109,152,101,4.0,8/27/2012,"I really really really enjoy their Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo.  Spicy and creamy... always served HOT, lots of sauce... Jumbo shrimps... tender juicy chicken. I am always down for this dish.  Never disappointed.  Oh, never ever order the linguini jambalaya, gross!!  My boyfriend was starving.. you know how guys are, big portions matter at this point. I like the option that we can sit at the bar without reservation, otherwise we would be waiting 30 mins"
Charlene G.,"Glendale, CA",76,10,1,2.0,5/10/2012,"I really don't understand why people wait for hours for this restaurant. Every time I try to dine here, the food is either flavored wrong, has too much flavoring, or just flat out tastes nasty. The only two things I'll order at this restaurant are the Fried Macaroni Balls and the Renee's Special. I went to this location with my boyfriend for lunch today and of course, I ordered the Fried Mac, the Renee's Special, and my boyfriend ordered the Bacon and Shrimp something Sandwich. We asked the waitress if she's ever had it and she said no. She also told us that a lot of people order it, so we automatically thought it would be good. She ALSO told us it's a pretty big sandwich, so I cancelled my Renee's Special so we could just half the bacon and shrimp thing. HORRIBILE IDEA! Let's review this disgusting sandwich real quick: 1. It's about 3 stories high ... it goes from toast, lettuce, tomato, bacon, toast, more lettuce, then 4-5 small pieces of overcooked, disgusting, ""grilled"" shrimp, in some nasty sauce that should be in a nasty coleslaw.  2. I gave that ugly thing a chance... I ate it. wanted to puke each time.  3. That thing was $13-$14 bucks with BURNT bacon ... and smart&final shrimp... WTF  4. The best thing about that sandwich was the buttery toast, and the tomatoes.  Service was alright. She didn't ask if our meal was ok. The passion iced tea we had tasted like nasty lipstick...and the Manager walked by, mumbled something to us, and before we got the chance to answer, he walked away... Whatevs....Cheesecake Factory will, and always suck.  P.S. why in the world are there a million advertisements in their menus? As if they don't have enough money?  I'd rather spend my money at a taco truck...That sandwich could have bought me a carne asada burrito, 4 tacos, and a quesadilla...."
Ellis J.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,251,28,3.0,6/30/2012,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Then why 3 stars you say.... Well..every entree i have is always so amazing, from the pork chops to meatloaf to the fish. The size is always enough to fill me and im a fatty! ha! SOOOOOO why the 3 stars...its because everytime I get cheesecake to go..the slice is small and the toppings are skimp.Which sucks cause Im easy to please and love cheesecake! I'll be back for the food...but many diners have better cheesecake....."
Mike D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,124,1,2.0,9/24/2014,"The only positive experience I had here was that we did not have to wait for a table. Our waitress took forever to bring our drinks. We saw her chit chatting with other waiters and never payed any attention to our table. Additionally, I had to ask for some bread which is a first for me since usually it arrives without a request. I guess she forgot since she was too ""busy"" walking around chatting with her co workers. After some time, she came by with another waiter saying that the gentlemen would take over for her. The guy was really nice but he never came by for a drink refill which was very disappointing. Over all, the service at this location is very terrible. My advise is to go to the one in The Grove."
Joe M.,"Glendale, CA",2,3,1,1.0,8/13/2014,I went with a group of 10 last night for a special event and this was not a good experience. We waited for one hour to be seated.  Our guest of honor got her dinner after we finished our dinner...the waitress never figured this out and was not around to do more than get orders.  Then I go into the ladies restroom and it is full of hand towels all over the floor and NO TOILET PAPER in the stalls!  This restaurant needs to think about their costumers!!!  DO NOT GO THERE WITH A LARGE PARTY!!!
Kris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,97,116,5.0,8/12/2014,Always great experience here never had a bad choice great food great service the only thing is the long wait for a table because they dont take reservations
Maria N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,5.0,10/22/2015,"I like the atmosphere, the area, and the of course the food. I usually get the crab cake bites and a lemon drop martini. I also get the seared Ahi tuna salad. Food is always delicious here. No complaints."
Hannah K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,4,4.0,5/14/2011,"4.5 for the Cheesecake Factory.  I've never had a main dish here, just appetizers. The avocado egg rolls and the chicken samosas are a must- have for sure. The last time I went I got the taquitos too, and those are pretty good. The cheesecake....need I say more? Its delicious and decadent. I've had the chocolate raspberry and the chocolate tuxedo UGH to die for!!! I am always seated quickly and served promptly, but both times I've been to the Cheesecake Factory, the waiters/waitresses have changed during the meal. Also, the bathrooms are really clean."
hrayr o.,"Burbank, CA",79,7,5,3.0,9/12/2013,Food is delicious; especially the cheesecakes.  But the service is poor and slow. No one approached our table till about 20 minutes after we were seated and it wasn't even a busy day.
