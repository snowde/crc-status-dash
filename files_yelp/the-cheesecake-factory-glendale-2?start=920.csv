Patrick K.,"Glendale, CA",1,19,4,2.0,10/2/2014,"We got seated right away (that's for the stars). Next we ordered food and I ordered a beer. The beer arrives right when I barely had two bites left of my meal. Gee thanks! Later, our waitress brought in a sub, so she could take her break; which in itself is fine. But when the sub brought back the credit-card slip to be signed, she left the check-holder and dashed off, but forgot to leave us a pen for signature and tip. Seriously?! Is that code for not wanting a tip? I should have just left instead of having my friend look for a pen in her purse."
paul a.,"Glendale, CA",32,17,2,1.0,10/27/2011,"Went for lunch with colleagues. 1.waited to be seated 2. waited 45+ min for food 3. table and cutlery were dirty - sent forks away, they cleaned the table and brought the same dirty forks back. (gross) 4. When food finally came, we had to leave to get back to work, so they boxed it up. 5. got back to the office and one order was wrong, one salad had no dressing provided, and there were no napkins or cutlery provided. 6. Almost $60 for 3 sandwiches and iced teas. 7. Sandwiches were adequate at best. 8. Will never do that again."
Paige L.,"Vancouver, WA",28,61,17,5.0,5/24/2014,"I gave this location 5 stars because they have outside seating by the courtyard that has a fantastic water show, and our server Grant was amazing. We got in quick, and got our food quick. We got a Caesar salad which was delicious, the potato soup is kind of like a baked potato and is also delicious, and the steak and salmon plate is to die for! I couldn't have had a better dinner!"
Britt B.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",136,172,40,4.0,9/29/2012,This was Hubs and I go-to for date night for a while.  I love that I have been there literally dozens of times and can still find new things to order. The service is great and the cheesecake is even better. There are tons of selections and options.  My Favorite is the Pumpkin Cheesecake that comes out around October! To-die-for!  The one time we had a poor experience we spoke to the manager and got a full refund for our meal.  Downsides - The wait is usually pretty long. Very noisy. Super expensive kids menu and sometimes the service can run pretty slow.  TIP if it is just you or 2 people check the bar area for an open seat or 2. All the tall tables and the bar are self seating.
Honest A.,"Reno, NV",29,261,324,4.0,4/13/2014,"Do you like to eat? Never diet? Gain weight?  Then this is for you.   Amazing place where every item on the menu is appealing,  without cheese or cake.  Orange chicken with brown rice yummy as mac and cheese."
Nicole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,110,19,2.0,7/13/2012,"Man....the host counter sucked! They made table promise times of 10-15min outside; 55min inside! We actually sat down (after 40mins) outside, while it seemed that other parties of 2 were seated ahead of us with NO wait....wow! Manager/Management of Glendale is tremendously awful! Vanessa our waitress was a doll.....happy & cheerful! It's lucky you have SOME very dedicated help!"
Kari L.,"Pasadena, CA",280,79,97,5.0,7/9/2012,"I have honestly never had a bad Cheesecake Factory experience.  The food is always great, the portions ample and the service can't be matched. I went with a couple of friends yesterday and we got a table right away.  The host was super cool.  Our waitress was prompt and lovely and took care of our every need. My friend had the CHARGRILLED COULOTTE STEAK cooked medium.  The temperature was perfect and it was melt-in-your-mouth good.  My other friend and I both had pastas, which were also very good. Overall, it was a lovely lunch and, provided I don't have to wait long, I will be back."
Gary L.,"San Gabriel, CA",256,628,19,4.0,9/5/2009,"I can't remember the server's name, but he provided pretty good service.  A nice young man with dashing blond hair. I ordered the orange chicken which I haven't had in years.  The last time I had it was probably 7 years ago and I didn't like it, but I decided to try it again out of curiosity, to see what it was I didn't like about it back then.  Oddly enough, I enjoyed it.  It had a slight taste of orange to it, stronger than what you'd find at Panda Express.  The chicken was tender and the batter was not too tough or hard.  They give you a good amount of rice which I wasn't able to finish.  We also ordered my favorite dessert there, or at least it used to be.  I haven't had it in awhile either since I don't come here often, but I had it pretty hyped up in my head.  Strawberry Shortcake.  Vanilla ice cream, a biscuit, strawberries, strawberry glaze, and way too much whipped cream.  I think it met my expectations.  It was good.  I had to move the whipped cream aside, though."
Yoojin J.,"Glendale, CA",1,54,5,3.0,7/5/2014,"Honestly not that great compared to the price. Went for my sister's bday and they gave us a free chocolate layered tiramisu kind of thing which was cool :) the wraps (?) were pretty good, but you have to wrap everything yourself x)"
Melanie O.,"Glendale, CA",340,661,63,3.0,5/29/2012,"I want to rate this at least a four, because the food is good.  Not $$$$ fine-dining good, but well, for what it is, it's good.  Oh, and so is the bread.  But, the wait.  That dreaded wait.  It almost makes me want to bring it down to two-stars, but it was Mother's Day after all, and NO WHERE except their FRONT DOOR did it say that they would take reservations, the DAY OF, AT 9AM.  So since I don't sit outside this establishment every single day, I was not aware. Moving forward.  J & C get there first, and are told the wait will be 1 - 1.5hrs.  Okay, that's fine.  We're just pulling in to the jam-packed parking lot, and it'll take us maybe 20 minutes to find parking anyway.  Fast forward after taking some strolls, a little window shopping, and a quick nibble on something, the boys check in on our wait.  Well, despite the fact that we've been waiting an hour and fifteen minutes, the boys come back and tell us that we'll be waiting another hour and a half.  Wait, wahhhhhhh?  2.5 hours?  For D's mom to order chicken alfredo?  No.  Not happening. Well, we didn't end up waiting that dreaded extra hour and a half.  We were sat outside and repeatedly asked to have the heater turned on, the staff just kept on saying he would until finally we overheard him ask someone else how to do it because HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW.  Why wouldn't you just say so?  Well, bottom line, we'll never return on a holiday.  D's mom just REALLY had to try it here, and hopefully we shall never return for such a dull experience. Overall:  on a non-holiday:  parking is easy & validated, staff is friendly, food is alright and you get sprayed by the fountain if you sit outside."
Crystal V.,"Tujunga, CA",149,83,41,3.0,4/4/2015,"They really need to come up with a different system for seating, like the buzzer or a text notification letting the customers know their seat is ready. I think it would go a lot smoother that way people won't have to sit here hoping for their name to be called and instead, shop while they wait. This place is always so crowded and can use a little help."
Dawn S.,"Covina, CA",8,10,,1.0,9/12/2015,"I've only been here once and I will not be visiting again. I was visiting with a couple friends. The server was very slow in getting to us to take our drink orders 15 minutes. She showed up 15 minutes later to take our order. Then, 45 minutes later, to ask us if we wanted dessert at which time I asked her for a water refill, and 30 minutes later to deliver the checks we had asked for instead of dessert along with my water. I had every intention of ordering dessert before she arrived, but with an empty water cup that I had asked numerous other servers for assistance in filling, I was starving to get out of there and get a drink of water. This is not service. She was a minimalist and so was her tip."
Gina D.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,224,25,5.0,9/28/2011,"Yes. This place is great! Take it from me! I used to work here as a hostess!  The staff is above and beyond, the management is on point, bartender knows his work, and the food is always hearty! DEF my favorite cheesecake factory!"
Robert- Bobby C.,"Buena Park, CA",168,174,496,4.0,5/16/2010,"I love it here.. Even though it's in a crowded area where people gather especially in the weekends but great place to eat.. It's next to the Glendale Galleria.. After shopping, why not go there to eat.. Service is excellent, not one of them had a problem with me yet. Burgers and steaks aren't top notch but they are well known for their pastas and of course, their cheesecakes..  Ambiance is great with a choice of sitting outside and enjoy the fountain scenery or inside where you can watch sports.. They have have a full bar there also.. Restrooms are very clean..  Salads are good also with a variety of flavors.. Chinese Chicken Salad is excellent, I always get it when I'm sick of pasta that day.. Their other desserts are yummy also.. I love the 30th Anniversary chocolate cheesecake.. Wide selection of good food in their menu..   My wife loves it there.. She always gets the Chicken Marsala and the Crusted Chicken Romano..  There is a lot of parking spaces.. I would come here again for their great pasta, salads and desserts..   I better stop talking about food, I drool every time I write reviews like these.."
Agnes A.,"Encino, CA",25,9,,5.0,10/6/2011,"T'was  James (my grandson) 2nd birthday.  Had dinner with my family, wait was not bad, in 5 minutes we were seated.  We were given all the accomodations for the kids (high chair, coloring paper, etc.).  I had Hibachi Steak (medium well) it was done perfect and the salad was yummy. The server was very nice and everything we requested was with fast service. My second time and it is worth it."
Erik R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,1.0,10/5/2015,"Two weeks ago found a hair in the salad. They didn't charge me for the salad, they didn't apologized either. I don't care about the money apology from the management would have been nice. Last night with my three kids 19month old, 6 year and 10 year old. I was told 1 hour to be seated. Hour and half later I was told any minute. 15 min. later kindly asked African American manager we have been waiting for hour and 45min. and have 3 kids. He didn't even look at my face and told me we are working on it. My wife got nasty with him and we got table. We order Santa Fe salad same one we found hair the salad that we get ones a week came half a size. Really? anyways, my bill came $73 and change I gave her $20.00 a tip. Good food, reasonable prices. out of control management."
Ainaz R.,"Chino, CA",140,49,5,5.0,4/13/2014,Jason is an amazing waiter!! Definitely request him. He gave great advice on what to get for desert and has such a welcoming personality.
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2735,19385,2.0,6/29/2011,"***This location in the Brand at Americana seems like any other Cheesecake Factory out there; for dessert, it would probably be better to opt for one of their cheesecakes rather than their ice cream desserts*** We went here for dessert after a meal at nearby Raffi's.  I am not the biggest fan of cheesecake so I opted for one of their ice cream desserts instead.  I went with their hot fudge sundae, which was vanilla ice cream topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and almonds. Everything about it was okay, but it was not one of the better sundaes out there.  The ice cream was a little too whipped and light and did not have the firmness and density I prefer.  The hot fudge was okay and the almonds were crunchy.  The whipped cream seemed similar to what you would get from a canned whipped cream. I have had their cheesecakes (at other locations) and while they are very dense and filling, they are probably a better option than their hot fudge sundae. Service was pleasant but a little slow and disorganized on our visit.  I haven't been to that many Cheesecake Factories lately so I am not sure if this is a common thing.  I remember the service at the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks being more efficient. The atmosphere was like any other Cheesecake Factory (a more upscale atmosphere than a lot of the chain restaurants out there).  And like other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, it was very busy. While I did not try their regular menu here, I imagine the overall experience would be similar to other Cheesecake Factory locations, which probably makes this a safe option for Cheesecake Factory fans.  If you are not a Cheesecake Factory fan but are in this area a lot, you may want to consider giving nearby Palate a shot (a good upscale Glendale restaurant). This Cheesecake Factory is located right in The Brand At Americana There are many parking structures nearby (some are paid and some are not).  We opted for the Glendale Galleria parking structure, which is free."
Kylie S.,"La Crescenta, CA",1,4,1,1.0,7/26/2014,This place sucks ass. They told me I'd be seated in 45 minutes. I'm currently writing this review after 70 minutes of waiting. Very unsatisfied with the service here.
Matthew D.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, CA",8,26,22,5.0,4/12/2014,"My weekend regular, I recently tried their Beef Kabobs and WOW! a new favorite appetizer that I will order on the regular. Despite this expansive menu, I have had the opportunity to explore a majority of the dishes. I love this place and their cheesecakes (A LA MODE) are epic. Call me crazy, but I always look forward to dining here each week."
