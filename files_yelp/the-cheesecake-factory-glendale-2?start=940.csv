Garland M.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,4,,4.0,5/23/2014,"Came here for An early dinner on a date place was packed so decided to eat at the bar was served by Justin but all the bartenders helped out. All the bartenders were very clean cut and they were also very professional and tentative. The only reason I have 4 stars was because the steak Diane I ordered with the salmon, (which was perfect) was a bit overcooked. Will definitely be visiting this cheesecake location again"
Ashley H.,"Hyattsville, MD",2,23,8,4.0,6/20/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory. Pretty standard to every other cheesecake. Nothing special other than the beautiful outside seating with the water fall. Kinda romantic if you are into that kind of thing.
Andy J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,109,5,3.0,8/31/2014,"I came with a buddy and were promptly seated outside. Once seated, i ordered a Blue Moon and it came out cold and refreshing. I ordered a Jamaican shrimp plate which was flavorful. Our waitress, although very sweet and nice, was wearing sunglasses and not checking in frequently.  We ordered several cheesecakes to share and taste...banana creme which was suprisngly my favorite, mango lime which was tarty but forgetabble, and godiva which was heavenly"
Adam F.,"Irvine, CA",97,105,108,4.0,12/8/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory looked very impressive with its marble-like colonnades and standard beaded door handles at the entrance.  We got seated in minutes, but had to stand at our table for a few more because it hadn't yet been cleaned.  I hate having to see a table I'm about the sit at be a mess.  For starters we got the spinach artichoke dip and the fried mac and cheese.  OMG, the friend mac and cheese was so amazingly good.  The cheeses they used in the pasta was strong and powerful, yet the dish still carried that delicious fried flavor.  On the other hand, the spinach artichoke dip was just so-so.  I thought it lacked flavor, but that might have been due to the mac and cheese being so strong.  Personally, I really like the spinach artichoke dip from Claim Jumpers the best.  My main course consisted of a delicious, well seasoned turkey burger and fries.  Don't be fooled by the word ""turkey.""  Though, I picked this dish to be a little more healthy, it was far from it.  The turkey was full of flavor and tasted so juicy that I'm pretty sure it was fried sometime during the cooking process.  My gf had the Pasta Da Vinci which was so sweet I thought I was eating candy.  Though sweet, the homemade pasta held its nutty flavor.  I didn't try my sisters chicken parmigiana dish, but she certainly thought it was good.  Pictures for all these dishes are on my blog.  I have decided that when going to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner, never get something healthy because nothing is ever healthy at this restaurant.  The Cheesecake Factory is a comfort food joint, and they are darn good at making that kind of food.  So fess up to the fatness and enjoy!!!"
Libia J.,"Claremont, CA",166,101,807,4.0,3/4/2014,"Here is a place that can satisfy everyone's cravings! Their menu offers a international verity of food. Also if you are too full to order a cheese cake, you can take it to go and it still tastes good the following day! Due to the fact the Americana can get crowded, don't always expect great service. Also the mixed drinks aren't the greatest."
Darylynn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,1705,7786,2.0,4/7/2010,"THE BIGGEST DOWNFALL of this location is the location itself.  It's too crowded & unorganized!  This location is NOT a typical first date Cheesecake Factory. You wait 10 min in line to reserve a table. -_-   Depending on time/day you wait a minimum of 15 min to sit.  So RESERVATIONS ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Their food is good of course, service is decent."
Ani G.,"Glendale, CA",0,31,,5.0,7/19/2014,"Great location, typical cheese cake factory with always the best food and service, love to sit in the patio there. We had our 1st day and date over  ever there with my husband several years ago"
John O.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",5,7,41,5.0,10/11/2013,The Renee's special was really good and definitely makes you full.  Plenty of food and hard to finish.
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,5.0,3/31/2010,"This Cheesecake Factory is located at the Americana and it's very European.  Whether you sit inside or outside, it's always a great experience.  The staff are professional and friendly.  The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory.  From the drinks to the meals to the deserts, they are all excellent! Been here so much that I've had everything on the menu over time and everything is excellent. They validate the parking as well. It's a great place for dates and families.  You can eat here then go to the Movie Theater or shop at many stores at the Americana. Highly recommend it!"
Jimmy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,5,4.0,9/15/2012,"Went here cuz they have outside seating and it was a nice day.  Hostess was little clueless and wouldn't seat us at the empty tables outside cuz she said the section was closed.  I asked for a manager, told him we'd like to sit outside and he immediately sat us outside and got us a waiter.  Hostess needs work, but the manager knows how to treat customers, and that is like a guest that you want to make happy.  THunbs up for the manager!"
Esh K.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/15/2015,"I went to Cheesecake Factory with my friends and were 6, 17 year old kids, the waiter sits us down, then takes order orders for drinks 20 minutes after we sit, after we got our drinks we were waiting 30 minutes to just give him our orders, we asked other waiters if they can serve us and we even complained to the manager, all they can say is ""Your waiter will be right with you"". It took the guy 40 minutes to take our order. We were there for 1 hour and 50 minutes after eating our food fast cause it was after our curfew and there were 2 different tables that came after us and left before us. We told the guy were not giving you a tip cause your a terrible waiter and you just lost a solid $20 tip. We didn't give it cause why should a person deserve $20 for righting down something on paper and bringing drinks. He also gave us attitude when he actually did serve us. Hate Cheesecake cause of the workers having self-opinions on people because of there age and race. The foods not even that good for being that expensive. I can go to Charley's and get chicken tenders there for $5 with much better service that I don't need to give a tip for with much better food.  Im never going back there and they should fire workers that take there time with different types of people."
Molly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,34,6,4.0,10/29/2011,"My work partner and I eat lunch at the bar at least once a week here, and really, these stars are all for my girl Amy.   Amy is a wonderful gal and super-server-bartendress, and she seriously has turned this place into Cheers for us.  You wanna go where everybody knows you want a water with lemon, a little house salad (easy dressing) and white bean hummus with warm pita wedges.  Thanks Amy :)   Also, as much as I dislike the naming of it, the new Skinnilicious (see?) menu is pretty great for lunch."
Courtney K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",1,2,,2.0,6/9/2014,"The service was horrible, had to wait 30 minutes for the food to come out so my food came out mushy/dry/stuck together, charged me for something unnecessary, and the waitress was giving attitude. Such a disappointment."
Rebecca S.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,119,61,2.0,9/2/2013,"Went here for lunch on Saturday, August 31st. Service here was bad. Food was good. I ordered a veggie burger and they gave me a turkey burger. When he assured me that it wouldn't take more than 5 minutes it finally arrived when my friends were almost completely done with their lunch. They never came over to refill my friends water or to even ask how our meal was. They didn't remove the veggie burger off of our bill and it just seems like they don't care about service at this location. Won't be back."
Jeanna T.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,29,2,1.0,3/9/2014,"The only reason we come back is for the food. The last 3 times, service has sucked. I'm paying too much for crappy service. The hostesses are slightly incompetent without fail."
Maite H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",606,470,2336,3.0,6/1/2011,I attended a celebration luncheon at the Cheesecake Factory with some friends and family. I've been to the restaurant numerous times and have always enjoyed my dining experiences. I ordered the shrimp scampi and steak Diane (medium) with pasta and a side order of the shrimp scampi sauce. My lunch was delivered as ordered and was delish! The food was yummy and the service was great!  3.5 Stars
Amber G.,"San Fernando, CA",98,115,57,5.0,2/6/2012,Super good food. Patio area is romantic. Music and water show. And the dessert is super Yum. And the wildberry mojitos are the best
Jimmy W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",10,109,109,4.0,11/11/2013,"Depending on the time you come to this location it's usually very busy. We decided to come here for Sunday brunch and it was no different. Even though there were a lot people waiting our party of 3 got a booth right away. Restaurant is always clean and the service is about B+ in my opinion. We ordered a pasta dish, Kobe burger and I had the brunch special Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs, which was very good! Honestly I thinking it was more like a 3 1/2 star experience because nothing was really spectacular but a 3 star wouldn't have been fair. Overall the staff and food was good and we will defiantly come back."
Nick T.,"Glendale, CA",136,310,116,3.0,11/20/2011,"It's not he same anymore. The food used to be very delicious and service was excellent. Lately, this branch seems to be screwing things up. Last few times we were there, the service was very substandard. The very last time, the server was all over the place, didn't get plates to share, tables were not being cleaned, just an overall mess. The food was not that great either. I remember their chicken littles being so soft and juicy, the last ones were hard and tasted like the ones you would get at a pizza delivery place. Another example is their ranch dressing, it used to be so good, however, the last time it was so salty, we barely touched it.  I hope the management is reading these reviews. I used to love this place as evident by my prior reviews, but that is slowly changing."
McKenzie J.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",28,11,3,3.0,6/4/2014,"Let's start off with the rude waitress Britney, she was nasty, absentminded, confrontational, and unprofessional. She had a horrible attitude. I was not going to tolerate it, so I asked for the manager, whose name is Chris. I told him about the Britney's despicable behavior and the cold pasta I was served. He was very helpful and understanding. He was apologetic and replaced the cold food and rude waitress. Josh, the replacement waiter, was the best. He was fantastic and provided great service. We were more than satisfied after the Britney drama. Watch out for her. Avoid her. Thank you."
