Pamlyn C.,"Pacoima, CA",3,105,,4.0,6/3/2014,"I came here for lunch on Sunday and ordered the Original Hamburger with fries.  I like my burgers well-done and they did an amazing job.  It was still juicy and tasty; just the way I like it.  I felt that their french fries were too salty.  Next time I will tell them ""no salt"" on the fries.   My sister ordered from the Sunday Brunch menu.  She enjoyed their waffles because they were fluffy and light :)"
Donna G.,"Los Angeles, CA",576,580,1164,4.0,9/28/2011,"I had a delicious lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.  Crab cake appetizer, then for the main course Salmon and Asparagus and an Iced Tea to drink.  The restaurant was really busy with customers even on a weekday for lunch.  The people across from me seemed to be business people having a lunch meeting.  And the people next to me were obviously tourists who were taking lots of photos of each other.  The waitress was really nice and helpful. She brought my Ice Tea and Crab Cake Appetizer right away, and validated my parking for me.  I was debating about a slice of cheesecake, but I was way to full from my appetizer and meal.  One thing I noticed as I was leaving, was that the bar area seemed to be busy with many people hanging out. It looked like a popular place, so I will have to go back and check it out some time soon."
David P.,"Victorville, CA",70,217,331,2.0,6/2/2012,"Yeah, it's pretty much like any Cheesecake Factory you've ever been to. Noisy, lots of larger parties. A menu with way too many choices. A bar with over-priced mixes of top-shelf choices. Ties on the servers. Noisy.  You know, the garlic noodles were tasty ...and maybe too hot out of a microwave? It's just noisy and lots of people eat here. I don't really know why... predictable..."
Martha L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,58,428,3.0,10/29/2011,"The wait was only 10 min fir a Saturday afternoon, not bad. We had a margarita with moctezuma tequila while we waited very good. For appetizers we had lettuce wraps which don't come as a mixture like pf changs and other restaurants, you have to build your own. The chicken, carrots, cucumber, etc come individually on a platter and you add whatever u want which is cool I guess. We also had crab cake bites, delicious. For our main entrees I had chicken Romano, my bf had jimbalaya with chicken n shrimp. The Romano was good it is served with spaghetti in a tasty sauce but I always order marinera on the side because I find it a bit dry. The jimbalaya was spicy and tasty.  Overall the food was great, the server...meh. We only saw her when we ordered and when we paid, oh yeah and she refilled my ice water with water only and no ice, it was kind of gross. A fresh cup of water with ice and a new lemon would have been nice. The busser brought us our boxes and removed our plates.  Sometimes it's unfair that a server doesn't do much and takes home all the money and the hard workers just get a cut. In this  case I believe it to be true. I love it when your server is there to take ur order, refill drinks, brings napkins, takes ur plates away, checks on u but isn't overwhelming.  We still left a tip though, we understand there's a lot of people involved in our experience and for them we tipped today."
Hemang S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1346,577,433,4.0,8/26/2009,"One of 100 places alike. BUt this was IS newer, so the decor has been stepped up a notch. Don't know if they still have it but the Chicken Bellagio soothed my soul. If not, Chicken MAdeira keeps me satisfied, every time.. especially after 3-4 rolls of free oat wheat bread/butter. Yum!"
Ro M.,"Elkhart, IN",1,54,,5.0,8/7/2014,"This was the perfect late night meal. The only place in the area open past 10pm on weekday.  Closing is listed at 11 but when we walked out after we were done eating at 11:15 there were still other customers lingering.  Being out late after watching the sunset and viewing the stars at the Griffith observatory, we jumped on bus line 180/181 which dropped us off right in front of Cheesecake Factory.  Due to the late hour, we had no wait time for a table. Our waiter Robert was very pleasant, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the huge menu.  His recommendations were spot on. The food was delicious and well portioned for hungry tourists like us.  We all enjoyed our food: Sliders and fries from kids menu (fries crisp on outside, fluffy in center) Chicken Littles - large pile of crispy chicken strips with corn mix and mashed potatoes Chicken Madiera - moist thin chicken  Lemon Herb Chicken"
Ani H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/29/2014,I went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time just a few days ago and have to say that it is a wonderful place! The food was fantastic and the waiter was very attentive without being overbearing. I really recommend going to this restaurant. :)
Kathy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,62,,4.0,4/26/2014,"Going back to basics was a pleasant surprise. While this is a very busy place, the service was excellent. The food absolutely delicious. I didn't expect it from a chain restaurant. The cook prepared my piece of salmon rare to perfection. And to be noted there is a gluten free option for the mashed potatoes."
Jan Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",282,465,1,1.0,5/17/2011,"This place blows balls. Their happy hour is undeniably good (which reflects on this Glendale location not at all), but the service is enough to make me want to patronize one of the zillions of other venues in Glendale. Not only was service poor (our server Kenneth demanded my girlfriend pass him the menus when he simply could've rounded the teeny tiny table to get em. He also slammed the plates as he collected them after our meal, and REALLY??? we could've done without the FIERCE ATTITUDE- not in the good way). When we went to complain afterwards, the super crappy (and tubby) manager barely apologized, barely took us seriously, and in essence, ushered us out the door. Good job cheesecake. GOOD JOB SUCKING!!!"
Craig M.,"West Puente Valley, CA",69,74,79,2.0,11/5/2014,"I keep going here because my Dad is forgetful these days and he doesn't remember he is always disappointed when we go here, in any case I order what I feel to be one of the simplest items to make in the kitchen ""Cheezburger"" and while the content of the Americana Cheeseburger was done gracefully and it was delicious it was also not hot... or warm... it was room temperature at best. I guess I'm weird in that I feel hot food should be served hot but apparently the servers at Cheesecake feel your dish should sit on the service counter for a good 10 minutes before they bring it to your table, how is it that the servers at Apple bee's manage to bring your food while it still sizzling but they can't master this craft at Cheesecake factory. You might think I expect too much but the burger cost 13 dollars so maybe yeah I should expect a certain level of performance from the service crew but at this point I've written so many bad reviews for Cheesecake in Glendale that if no one has taken notice then it really isn't effective to continue; five star restaurant this is not.. or four star or even 3."
Tina A.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,1,4.0,1/24/2015,"I come here at least once a week, and this place never disappoints!! I love their Stuffed Mushrooms and Chicken Bellagio. MUST TRY !!!"
Ani N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,57,5,1.0,10/24/2013,"I came here last night and was very disappointed with the service. I am a frequent customer to this location and every time I come, something always goes wrong. We were seated within five minutes and our waitress was very prompt. But as soon as our food came out, she didn't even bother to check on us once. It was a Wednesday night and it did not seem very busy. The person I was with is new to the area and he even asked me why the workers seemed so miserable. Next time, I will make the drive out to Sherman Oaks."
Lily M.,"Springs, PA",0,9,,1.0,8/2/2014,I have been waiting to get a table for almost 2 house. The workers keep on giving me stupid excuses. I wish that I could give -5 stars. I went to the worker and she said about 10 minutes so I went back 10 minutes later and she said 10 more minutes. It's really pathetic that I have to wait 2 hours to get a table.
Varduhi N.,"Glendale, CA",1,81,3,4.0,5/21/2015,"Good food, many choices. Even though they have a lot of things on the menu, they all are good. I have been to this restaurant at least one a month and the food has always been consistent. The customer service given by the waiters has always been great. All the waiters and waitresses I have come across were very nice, friendly and pleasant. The takeout/dessert counter employees have also been very nice.  Great customer service, but SOME of the hostesses should smile a little. Some of them tend to give an attitude when you initially approach them."
Negar G.,"Glendale, CA",2,17,6,4.0,12/16/2014,"it was the third time I was going to cheesecake Factory. I loved the fresh baked bread with butter that they always bring for the appetizer. I ordered roasted vegetable pizza, it was nice and bread was fluffy. My husband ordered Filet Mignon which was nearly $30, quiet pricy, and the quality was not as expected. The other negative point was that we waited for 30 minutes to get our table, it is always busy specially for dinner. All in all I would go over there for pizza but not steak anymore."
Gor M.,"Tujunga, CA",39,4,,4.0,7/28/2014,"Their menu is good and they have plenty of options to choose from.  I love their salads!!!  My personal favorite is the French country salad - it's just very well put together.  I also Love their salmon dishes! They prepare them in several ways and I, including my family like them a lot.  The last but not the least is the bar! Their drinks are good and their mojitos are the best in town!"
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,9/19/2011,"HUGE & BEAUTIFUL LOCATION! ...and HUGE and Beautiful Cheesecakes!  This is a great location at the Americana.  The biggest location I've ever seen for the Cheesecake.  Because of their seating capacity, there's never a wait here.  The parking is not the best since it shares the lots with everything else at the Americana, but validation is offered."
Chad G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,10,,2.0,8/16/2014,I have yet to sit down and not have crumbs under my feet. I'm not sure when they started using bamboo outdoor furniture inside so get a booth otherwise your back is done for. Food is  okay  it's just always dirty.
Marc E.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,311,49,4.0,5/27/2012,"Its a great place with great food. My only advice is to be careful with the person taking your order. They will try to add this and add that to your bill. Just be clear with them and you wont have a problem. The waitress tried to get my 2 year old daughters to get their own dish! Its like come on!The portions are huge! If the girls can share the womb, they can share a plate."
Nicole E.,"Burbank, CA",5,14,2,2.0,8/13/2011,"I normally love the cheesecake factory, but this time, not so much!   We get there for lunch & fortunately didn't have to wait too long to be seated. They just opened up a section & we were the first ones seated in that section. Now cut to 20 min later when we still haven't been waited on... Not even our drink orders taken!  I looked around & saw all the other tables around us were now filled, with drinks & some of them beginning to get food!!!!!  We were soooo mad & it didn't help that we were so very hungry! Finally I had to stop a waitress & ask where ours was. He finally came. We ordered. We ate. He was pleasant & did apologize for the wait, but that NEVER shoulda happened in the first place! To boot, I LOVE the avocado egg rolls & they really weren't that great this time.  All in all, this was not a great dining experience!  Hope yours is better!"
