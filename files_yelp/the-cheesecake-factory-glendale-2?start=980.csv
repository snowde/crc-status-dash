Seviant I.,"Glendale, CA",305,14,24,1.0,6/7/2014,"Ridiculously rude service. This location needs an attitude check and management/HR refresh. Long wait times are understandable but bad attitudes, unprofessional behavior and employees mumbling under their noses is absolutely unacceptable. You should stick to the Pasadena location. This Americana location needs a lesson in American Hospitality Services."
Laurie K.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",7,13,2,5.0,5/2/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory on a fri. Night. Amazing food, staff and evening. Will definitely go back. The bartender made the best Mint Julep for me - tomorrow is the Ky Derby. Thank u for a great evening with my husband."
Melanie K.,"Glendale, CA",20,86,3,4.0,8/31/2013,"I know it has been here already for a really long time but it was a very good idea to make this in the Americana. You can't really go wrong with the cheesecake factory. They have a HUGE selection of different kinds of foods which makes it very easy for someone who pretty picky. I've been here many many times and never had a problem with the staff, everyone is pretty friendly (some more then others). I've tasted a bunch of different stuff on the menu. Some I wasn't a fan of, most are okay, few are great. My absolute favvvvvv is the Louisiana chicken pasta, it's a little on the spicy side and I like how the chicken is breaded. The avocado egg rolls are the best from anywhere else I have tried. I was not a fan of the orange chicken. Oh and the drinks :) yummmm! Pretty much all the drinks are good, but if you like rum you MUST get a mojito (any of them are amazing). In the end the cheesecake factory isn't the best but it's not bad either. If you do come here it's best with a group, and if you come for dinner on the weekend arrive early because there is at least a 45 minute wait.. even if it's just for 2."
Hannah P.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,157,284,4.0,6/3/2011,"I seriously hate the lighting here. I know, it's for mood/ambiance, but really, I can't see the food that I'm eating. Also, it'd be nicer if it were a bit quieter (it's like Bottega Louie). We were seated at a table that was so tiny I wasn't sure how it would fit even one plate. And sure enough, it could barely hold our food on the table, and my elbows were banging into the wall by me. The food and service, though, are GREAT. I believe our server's name was Omar? He was really kind: went through all the specials, soups, etc.; and came to check on us often enough that we didn't have to wait around to order or ask questions, but not too often that he was breathing down our necks. For starters, the bread is amazing. And the butter. YUM. We ordered the appetizer Avocado Eggrolls and the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. They were both delicious! The eggrolls had a perfect crunchy outer shell with a contrasting soft and ripe avocado filling. This dish is like a classy level up from the regular eggrolls. And the sauce/dressing/whatever was delicious too. It brought a sweet tanginess to the slightly insipid flavor of the eggroll itself. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was sooo good. It's not like the other pastas that make you feel like barfing after a few bites because the sauce is too creamy or bland. And the pieces of chicken were grilled nicely too."
LaFlora H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,6/1/2015,"HORRIBLE!!!! Never again will I ever support this Cheesecake Factory. I went for my after party wedding dinner. The service was horrible. We had a guest list of 25 people. They made us wait more than 2 and a half hours before we finally complained and they sat us wherever. The party was a various different tables and we could not all sit together. Then our food was not cooked all the way and several of our guests had to send there food back. It was the absolute worse experience and I expected so much more, being such of fan of the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena, but this was bad. I wouldn't recommend anyone going with a large group of people"
Vincent T.,"Oakland, CA",66,116,47,3.0,2/12/2014,Really not that impressed with the quality of the food for the price we paid smh even the drinks were watered down down down
M J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",620,151,,4.0,1/20/2014,"My fave here is Herb crusted salmon, bang-bang chicken & shrimp and orange chicken, of course the tempura roll appetizer and the wide-selection of cheesecakes! best place for big parties!"
Kristine C.,"Glendale, CA",109,20,106,2.0,10/29/2011,"So disappointing! We ordered the Fire Cracker Salmon, the Thai Lettuce Wraps and Herb Crusted Salmon w/ Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta The Fire Cracker Salmon lacked flavor. So I tried to use the dipping sauce which was too spicy and salty. The Thai Lettuce Wraps had way too much garlic and was over seasoned with soysauce. The Herb Crusted Salmon was overcooked and the herbs  didn't help the salmon either.   The shrimp with angel hair pasta was a little better because it was the only thing we ordered that wasn't over seasoned. Then again, it was bland. Unfortunately, the best part of the meal was the complimentary bread. And that's why I'm even giving this experience 2 stars. Will we go back??? Nope! Sorry!"
Melissa N.,"Rosemead, CA",672,107,220,5.0,2/25/2011,"I hate to admit, but Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants! I LOVE where this one is located, right in the middle of the Americana. We were seated outside with an awesome view during dinner. The fountain show was happening with music and the lights everywhere just made everything look so much more beautiful here. I had my pomeranian with me so one of the servers outside went out of her way and got us seated near her in the outside patio section because she thought she was such a cutie(she is and she knows it too, which is why she usually gets her way lol). We were seated right next to a heat lamp so we had a warm dinner.  FOOD: Pasta da Vinci: sautéed chicken, mushrooms and onions in a madeira wine sauce in penne pasta..my favorite pasta to get here! It was a little undercooked this time and can sometimes the wine sauce feels a bit heavy and greasy but this time it was made just right! A must try! :) Crispy Crab Bites: Bite sized mini crab cakes that come with a mustard-tartar sauce, it was crispy and real crab inside, so good but only 5 small pieces since it is part of their ""small plates"" menu :( Chicken Madeira: their most popular chicken dish and always recommended by all servers..for a good reason! Its sautéed Chicken Breast topped with asparagus and mozzarella cheese, covered with mushroom madeira sauce and a side of mashed potatoes. You get a HUGE portion so its plenty to share or take home and the chicken is not dry, the mushroom sauce is delish and so are the mashed potatos!  We didn't have room for dessert but I love their Banana Cream Cheesecake :)   Total tab was about $50 something before tip. It was a good experience, and my first time eating outside on the patio. Service was excellent! We got special attention because of my dog but hey, whatever works! Don't forget to have your parking pass validated before you go!"
Jane L.,"Studio City, CA",12,98,116,3.0,5/27/2012,"I just wish they would take reservations, especially for large groups.  Service was good, and the food was tasty."
Leticia D.,"Glendale, CA",1762,726,226,2.0,3/28/2013,"OMG this place was so noisy, the service was terrible. My salad portion was small and i left there still feeling very hungry. They are way over priced too!"
Anne D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,52,,2.0,5/21/2015,"Great location, beautifully designed restaurant and waitress was very nice and attentive.  Food was horrible. First plate was one of their pasta dishes, completely bland, tasteless, so I returned it.  Then I ordered pizza and since I am vegan, I skipped the cheese.  My pizza arrived with all the toppings cold, I mean I put my finger in the marinara sauce, it was ice cold, tomatoes on it, were not cooked , as well as the basil.  They cooked the dough and threw the cold toppings on it.  It was so awful.  I would not go back."
lolita b.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Today at approximately 1pm, I had the worst service experience at Cheesecake Factory ever. I sat at the bar and upon taking my order the bartender immediately noticed how dirty my side plate was and switched it out ASAP. This impressed me because I'm a slight germaphobe and I didn't have to point it out to him. Now this is where he goes wrong... I ordered a glass of wine and the glass that it was served in was dirty. I asked the very same bartender for a clean glass and he looks at the glass and ask if it stinks or is it dirty. I stated that it's very dirty. He tell me it's just hard water. Seriously?! If you're aware that your dishes come out looking dirty after they're cleaned, maybe you should take an extra step in ensuring that customers do not get ""dirty"" glasses. At this point the exchange became mildly patronizing on his part. My meal arrived and not once was I checked on by either bartender. I shared my story w/the woman who sat beside me. She told me to let the poor service reflect in my tip. I couldn't do that, I reluctantly left 18%. As I was leaving I said to woman beside me, ""watch...they're not going to say goodbye, thank you or offer me a parking validation."" Sure enough, got I got it right.  Just FYI, it wasn't busy at all."
Claudia P.,"Palmdale, CA",1,5,5,4.0,5/15/2015,The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is for our waiter grant h his service was the best I went yesterday with a co worker for lunch we had 3 hrs before we had to go back to work first the hostess was a little rude asked my name how many told us to wait as we sat their for them to call our name I kept seeing people come in and right away being seated after the 3rd family being seated my co worker went to ask how long the wait was the hostess said oh let me have them seat you now that meant if we would have not said anything we would just have waited we the get seated in a small table just enough to have our drinks I felt I was sitting on the guys lap next to me Lol! When our waiter grant arrived we asked if we were able to move to a booth which he help us do his service was the best !!! A little tip for the hostess if you are not a people person or having a good day you should not work with people  as for good it was average
Alexandra L.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,5,,1.0,5/12/2015,This place is the worst location!!! Bad service and bad food! It's basically over priced gmo food. There are better restaurants than this glorified chain food restaurant that makes you fat!
Melinda D.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,5,6,5.0,9/2/2013,Labor Day weekend sitting outside at Americana in lovely weather. There pina colada was amazing. They don't have my favorite sandwich ( Navajo) anymore which was a disappointment but the chicken  avocado sandwich was really good. You can never go wrong at cheesecake.
Arpineh K.,"Glendale, CA",37,164,99,5.0,11/13/2011,"How can you not love this place? Everything is delicious. Best appetizer ever: crispy crab wontons. And recently I tried the fried macaroni and cheese balls which were amazing, but nothing can compare to the wontons. There's usually a ton of people there especially on weekends. So don't go if you don't feel like seeing people =) The patio seating is great on a nice day because you get to see the water fountains and hear the music and people-watch. The wait is almost never as long as they say, so that's always great. Plus there's plenty of stuff to do while you wait for your table. The waiters are really cool, haven't had a bad one so far. And the drinks are the best! Tropical martini and key lime martini are the best martinis. Pumpkin cheesecake for dessert is a great idea, as is the strawberry shortcake."
Sandra F.,"Whittier, CA",28,7,,1.0,10/14/2013,"Nice Patio.... But service is so unprofessional.. There was a silver knife on the floor., after 4 employes stepped on it the 5 the one picked it up., we had to ask for every item we needed.. Manager needs to take notice of these things!!!"
Joanne C.,"San Jose, CA",331,341,627,2.0,4/6/2011,"I don't think Cheesecake Factory ever has good service.  Garlic noodles with chicken taste like shit. It tastes like the chef boiled the pasta and put it on the plate, straight from the pot.. and then he steamed up some chicken and placed that on top of the pasta and served it to us. Seriously, I've never tasted pasta at a restaurant so PLAIN before.  Buffalo chicken was good... until my cousin bit into one that was COMPLETELY RAW and STILL BLEEDING! Fucking disgusting. We stopped eating that shit and called our waiter over and told him. He called the manager over and they took it off our bill.  I think the only part our waiter was excited about was singing happy birthday to my cousin, lol."
Jen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,46,17,5.0,9/29/2011,"Happy hour - Until 6pm. Select appetizers for $5 is the business! The calamari plate was big and stacked; they didn't try to cheat just because it was happy hour - i love it! HH is only good at the bar, I believe.  They still give you the bread, though! No worries my carb-loving friends!"
