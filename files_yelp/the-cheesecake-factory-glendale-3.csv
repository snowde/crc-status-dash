Ophelia M.,"Milwaukee, WI",1718,591,2048,4.0,12/27/2017,"I don't tend to come here for full fledged meals--but for cocktails and/or dessert, I'm definitely a fan. We've been to this location on a couple occasions now and have been pleased each time.  If you have a cheesecake lover in the family, this is your spot. Their cheesecake menu is vast and varied. In addition, their slices are ample (like whoa). So ample, in fact, that my main dining companion and I almost always share a piece (if we can agree on a flavor). When we don't share, we almost assuredly have some left over to bring home.  Their cocktail game is strong. My current favorite on their signature cocktail menu is their bourbon & honey. It's lightly sweet and made with Four Roses Bourbon, orange blossom honey, and finished with a sprig of thyme. If you've never had bourbon paired with thyme, let me be the first to tell you--they make an excellent combination.  We tend to sit in the bar area and have been more than pleased with the service we've received (kind, accommodating, and just plain friendly). We've always found the servers to be helpful and ready with recommendations when called upon. They're open late (midnight on Fridays & Saturdays) for those looking for a little late night dessert in a lovely atmosphere. Get to it!"
Meghna S P.,"Milwaukee, WI",14,73,47,4.0,11/7/2017,"I have visited several Cheesecake Factories but this one stands out to me. They always have good staff and is very conveniently located in the Bayshore Mall. Typically during rush hour there will be a wait (more on the weekends) but otherwise they seat you almost immediately.  Their bar has amazing drinks and I really like that they have a skinny menu for the health conscious ones. Their food choices are in abundance.. you can get overwhelmed because you would want to eat everything! I like how they break down their menu into seafood, or specialities and pastas and so on. I love their herb crusted Salmon and a few pastas. The new Thai coconut chicken is amazing! A must try.. it's a very flavorful entree. My husband often enjoys a pineapple or blueberry Mojito which they make really well!  Coming to the cheesecakes... isn't that the best part ? Assorted endlessly, their cheesecakes are one of the best. My favorite one is a caramel one called dulce and its to die for! So good! My mum loves the red velvet here and recently I saw a few new ones, amongst which mango key lime stood out to me.. mango and lime.. what not to like?  Unless you are allergic to a flavor, I highly recommend experimenting with your tastebuds here. You will not regret it!"
Michelle L.,"Racine, WI",82,1,,1.0,12/24/2017,"Worst overpriced food I've ever had in my life in a cheap, tacky ""Aladdin-like"" structure. I asked for hash browns with my eggs and received deep fried greasy potatoes served with catsup. Not acceptable. Orange juice was full of pulp and barely drinkable. Menu outside advertised ""brunch"". Was seated and found out ""brunch"" was brunch foods on a menu, not a serve yourself all you can eat. Menu is designed to confuse you. They do not make it clear what you'll be getting until it arrives. Stay away from here. Mediocre food that shows obvious corner-cutting. Not worth the extravagant price."
Marian Q.,"Milwaukee, WI",143,121,149,4.0,1/29/2017,"As a broke college student, the Cheesecake Factory was my idea of fine dining. And as far as this location is concerned, I've never had a service issue and I've eaten in and carried out from here quite a few times.  Over the years, i have expanded my horizons but I occasionally find myself making my way back to the Cheesecake Factory because with their expansive menu there's always something for everyone. The way I have conquered their huge menu is to find one or two things that I like and I know are consistently good and stick with them. I have made the mistake of trying new things and have been mildly disappointed. Go for the chicken bellagio, the Jamaican black pepper chicken or a burger and you will not be disappointed.  Great place to go for groups- but make a reservation if you're going in over the weekend because it definitely gets filled with shoppers but the wait is a good time to do some shopping!"
Carter Andrew L.,"Hainesville, IL",5,4,3,5.0,10/29/2017,The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants while most are very packed and the waiters don't have much time to talk it's just in and out here they take time.The food was perfectly cooked not under or over cooked I got the almond cranberry salmon salad it was good it had a large amount of kale the salmon and abvacado eliminated some of the kale flavor overall it was stupendous
Joey Y.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,2,,1.0,9/5/2017,"VERY RUDE STAFF  Their ""top host"" called me names, was very rude, and sat us with attitude.  The manager filepe was also very rude and made my whole family uncomfortable. This is a horrible establishment.  The place was dirty the employees were unprofessional I would never come back here"
Geoff H.,"Green Bay, WI",1,65,17,5.0,2/16/2017,Great food and a great time. Had the steak Diane with the salmon. The wife had the chicken pot pie. Great food and great service.
Chadrick J.,"Milwaukee, WI",175,484,1304,4.0,1/4/2016,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. If you have a menu the size of a graphic novel, well that's more than plenty. The Factory has everything, literally. Despite it being a standard restaurant around the United States the fact that they have pretty much whatever you're craving, it can't be beat. Hands down the Bistro Shrimp Pasta is my absolute favorite. Happy Hour is prime to try a little bit of some of the apps. They have good deals on drinks too. I prefer the Bayshore as it is less busy than the Mayfair Mall location. Oh they have a million cheesecakes too! Can't go wrong."
Mark P.,"Milwaukee, WI",258,285,532,3.0,6/27/2016,"The server was kind & thoughtful, my beverage was never empty which is basically a miracle.  But we go out to eat because food is delicious, much more so when you don't have to make it yourself & that is where I ran into some problems.  I ordered a burger off of their (way too) large menu.  So many choices.  When your menu has ads for other items, you need to trim it down a bit.  The server said it could be cooked to order & didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for medium / rare. After a moderate wait, the food came & I ate the French fries first because obviously fries lose that special something when they get cold, they are just never the same.  Then I cut into my burger & it is super well done. Not a hint of pink to be found, at all.  The server decides that this is the perfect time to transport to an alternate dimension, fall in love, have children, grow old, & then come back to this dimension & check on us. I tell her about the burger & how I can't eat it since it is wildly overcooked.  She asks if I want a replacement. I say no because I had filled up on the bread & fries and since there was the long wait until she came back, my body got the memo that it was full. So she brings out the receipt and my burger is still on it. I ask her to remove the burger that I couldn't eat & that she took away & just charge me for the fries.  I have never seen someone look so lost and confused before.  Ten minutes pass. A manager comes over & starts talking about the burger. Saying it is a delightfully tasty entrée & that he is sorry it was mixed up. I said I was sorry as well but we would really like the check now please.  He comes back with another burger and tries to give it to me.  I explained, again, that I didn't want the burger. I was full & it was unnecessary & it wasn't even the right burger.  Fifteen minutes later, we finally get the updated check. They did comp my entire entrée & fries but that was not the issue.  I would have happily paid for the fries because I ate the fries. I left my tip and moved on with my life.  This location is pretty but a bit cramped since it is in the mall.  Nice server who still was tipped heavily because she didn't do anything wrong.  Maybe speed service up a bit? Nobody likes to wait thirty minutes for a check."
John S.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,75,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Sometimes you have to go to the CF because its a group thing.  But that still does not excuse the moldy beet salad and then a manager who tries to explain to you that it is beet skin, not mold.  I know beets.  I know mold.  I know what I had was moldy beets."
Kristen C.,"Chicago, IL",64,409,709,3.0,6/22/2016,I really just don't get this place. For 18$ for 2 pieces of cheesecake with tip to go I was not crazed with the CF excitement. The cake is insanely rich and really is nothing mind blowing. We had the red velvet (nothing great-just approx 5lbs of sugar and tasted like most red velvet cakes I've had) and the oreo ( better than the red velvet but too rich and we love sweets). Staff is friendly and helpful but don't see myself or my mother visiting another. I'd rather have the 18$ in my purse.
Carol T.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,18,,2.0,7/9/2017,"I've had otherwise good experiences with the cheesecake factory, however this location's service was inexcusable. I met a friend for a late dinner and the restaurant was nearly empty. We ordered water and 2 orders of lettuce wraps. After 40 minutes waiting for our food, our server (Trey) assured us it would be right up. Another 20 minutes passed with no sign of trey, a manager, or our food. I felt he was avoiding our table. When the food (lettuce wraps) finally did arrive more than an hour after we ordered, both Trey and the manager on the floor (Brittany) insisted it was delayed due to lettuce leaves not being prepared. I don't buy it. The manager never offered to compensate even a portion of our bill.  The food was ultimately tasty. Had the employees chosen to be honest and simply apologetically explained that the ticket was forgotten and quickly corrected the mistake - I would have been inconvenienced but satisfied. Instead, I left disappointed and angry with a story worth warning others about"
Isaias C.,"Rosemont, IL",1,26,115,3.0,12/18/2016,The place was nice and clean. There was a wait but service was prompt. However the hot tea was brought in at the middle of our meal. Food was ok and portions are big. Prices are reasonable. We like coming here because of the ambiance.
Rachelle W.,"Fredonia, WI",31,4,3,1.0,7/31/2017,"Thank god for good company.  This place sucks!  My pasta was literally dried and crusty like it sat under the light for 45 min.  Well it took long to get our food, forgot our appetizer, over cooked a kolby beef burger.  Yeah, I don't need to come back."
Georgina J.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",130,28,9,2.0,7/7/2017,"I made the mistake of getting their Cuban sandwich. The meat tasted like it was microwaved, which it probably was. The mustard tasted like it was Heinz. The sandwich had no flavor and was kind of gross. With how much their food is you'd think it'd be at least okay but it's a money hungry chain so I guess I shouldn't expect much. Their cheesecake is of course good though."
Amber V.,"Fall River, WI",39,159,305,3.0,2/20/2016,wasn't really impressed with the waitress. But I've had worse service.  The food tasted good. I got a flat bread and of course cheesecake.  Prices are a little high I think.  Overall id probably go back.
Dave S.,"Milwaukee, WI",63,180,961,3.0,8/5/2015,"Been here many times. Yeah I know it's a chain. Sometimes thats ok. My problem was this visit and it figures I am writing my review now.  Previous visits were ok at this location. Today wasn't. From the time I ordered until a salad came out was 30 minutes. Now I wasn't in a hurry but also wasn't looking to spend my day here either. Waiter came by once to say ""almost ready"". It's a salad for peets sake. Some lettuce and stuff on a plate. What did they do organically farm the stuff while you wait? Check came and my body language was so obvious ""wait and let me give you my credit card now"" but no, Capt oblivious disappears again for 10 minutes.  Epic fail this time. With so many food choices at this mall I may not come back, save for a piece of cheesecake of course."
Melissa S.,"Milwaukee, WI",29,199,866,4.0,9/26/2015,Been coming here since the 90's. Always good food for a chain. I love love love the avocado eggrolls!! Especially after hours. Place is jumping. Who doesn't like cheesecake at midnight. Salads are gigantic. Great place for poor students who want leftovers. This location like most is in the mall area. Perfect place for lunch and better than fast food. Oh and you don't have to feel guilty eating the low carb cheesecake. Absolutely delicious.
Jill O.,"Lansing, IL",69,375,949,4.0,8/13/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I know it's a chain, and I know it is what it is, but there you go. Sometimes familiar is a good thing! The ceilings are high and the decor is pretty, giving you something to look at while you wait for your food. Like all Cheesecake Factories, your meal starts with a basket of bread. The honey wheat bread is always delicious, and is one of the best things about The Cheesecake Factory.  We started with an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms, which were stuffed with Fontina, Parmesan, garlic, and herbs and served in a wine sauce. They were delicious, and we kept dipping our bread in the sauce. We'd definitely order them again. My mother in law ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, which is chicken smothered in gravy and served with mashed potatoes, biscuits, and veggies. While it's not the best thing she's ever ordered here, she liked it well enough. My girlfriend ordered a factory combination with both Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon, which came with mashed potatoes. She love, love, loved it. I ordered my usual Chicken Madeira, which is chicken covered in a sweet Madeira sauce and topped with cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus. It comes with mashed potatoes as well. It's always delicious, and the sauce is amazing. Why order something else when this is perfect? And of course, we had to get dessert. My mother in law got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which is stacked layers of chocolate cake, cheesecake, and truffle cream. She loved it. It was so rich, she could only eat about half. My girlfriend ordered the Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores Galore cheesecake, and she loved hers too. It's Hershey's chocolate cheesecake topped with ganache, graham cracker pieces, and melty marshmallow. There was lots of marshmallow goo, which made her happy. I had the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake, and it was really good. It's lemon cream cheesecake with lemon mousse and meringue, as well as candied zest on top. It tasted delicious but the presentation was horrid. The meringue was a melted hot mess."
Nicole K.,"Casselberry, FL",122,219,236,4.0,6/11/2016,"The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful. It is big and has enough natural light coming in. It is also very clean. The staff are usually nice as well. The waitress we had was kind of rude at first but as time went on, was nicer. There are plenty of food options. I got the Chicken and Avocado Club Sandwich and it was delicious. Now to the cheesecake (which is it's namesake after all), there are so many options it can be overwhelming! I decided to go with the S'mores cheesecake because it seemed unique. It was very rich but oh so good. Overall, I absolutely recommend that if you are in the area, that you check this place out, especially if you like cheesecake."
Valerie W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",93,256,56,5.0,12/17/2016,Excellent hosts and waitstaff.  Cozy booths that are private.  We enjoyed the chicken Marsala and salmon for dinners (warning they are huge) The flour-less Godiva chocolate cheesecake was excellent!
David P.,"Cedarburg, WI",87,129,51,3.0,7/28/2014,"Been here a few times and almost every time I am extremely impressed by the portions of food that this place can dish out. The service was good but the one problem we had with this service was one of the family members ordered a martini or some kind of drink on the rocks. The drink literally had about 4 sips of alcohol and was around 80% ice. After saying something to the waitress, the manager game over and offered to get her another drink, which she ordered a beer. You'd think the beer would be free right? Wrong.... They were going to charge us for both drinks even though he gave the impression that he was getting a substitute drink for the 1/4 of a drink she had earlier.  So! If you go to eat, enjoy the food and get a beer, the drinks are overpriced for the lack of drink that you get."
Michelle R.,"Longwood, FL",35,72,160,4.0,7/29/2015,Very good service and surprisingly empty during the week. Coming from Florida if it's a Cheesecake Factory is always no less than a 30 minute wait on a good day. This location makes it easy to come with a group or for happy hour which is a fantastic deal.  We ordered the sweet corn tamales which were huge and delicious. The nachos are also good and the avocado rolls. But of course you have to have their cheesecake and there's so many to choose from.
Mostafa A.,"Milpitas, CA",85,2,1,1.0,7/4/2017,"Went to the Palo Alto University Avenue restaurant on 6/30/2017. Food arrived very late and the pasta was very overcooked. My total bill was $43 and being unpleased with the service, I did not leave a tip. 2 days later, I look at my bank statement and I see they charged me $55. I'm not sure what happened but it seems the waitress decided she could just put in whatever tip she wants so she goes for 28% tip - TOTAL NONSENSE. Used to love this place but never going back."
Brian F.,"Kansas City, MO",55,61,38,3.0,6/27/2015,"About what you would expect from a chain restaurant.  We were here on an idle Tuesday afternoon just after the lunch rush (around 2p) and it was completely dead. Service met my expectations but nothing more. She offered complementary bread, and every few minutes she popped over with ""bread is just coming out of the oven, should be right out"" which made me laugh. I mean, how many times can bread come out of the oven?! We ended up getting the bread pretty much with the food, half of which was stale/hard (the other seemed warm and fresh).  The menu is absolutely atrocious - 20+ pages, half of which is advertisements of businesses in other states (which makes me wonder if business is not going well?), and is organized all kinds of backwards. It's not an easy menu to navigate because things are spread out all over the place with full page ads in between.  The food itself was good and the Sangria my date had was actually very good. Prices were a little high for what you are getting but I don't think it's unreasonable. I think Cheesecake Factory has done a nice job of meeting (not exceeding) expectations as a big box store. I would prefer this to Applebee's or similar style, but I do feel there are places higher on my list to repeat."
Angel M.,"Milwaukee, WI",16,9,5,5.0,12/22/2016,Went to dinner with my family and the employees act like they do care about how they serve and are friendly as well. Thank you
Jamie G.,"Billings, MT",68,1,,5.0,12/17/2016,"Stopped here on the way to Chicago, Kathleen was an excellent waitress!! She noticed my husband's order had been miss-made before the plate even hit the table, apologized profusely, and asked if we would like a salad, etc on the house. Then the manager (or head chef??) came out and apologized as well. Both of our meals were delicious and the service continued to be on point through the rest of our meal."
Connie P.,"Milwaukee, WI",3,7,,4.0,12/14/2016,"I love me some Cheesecake Factory! They have got to have the largest menu I've ever seen at any restaurant. Good and bad thing, bad because it took us forever and I mean forever to order!!! But they have the most wonderful choices. Suitable for anyone. I had a ""glam-burger"" just because of the name itself, I had to check it out! It was tasty. Portions were nice. Our waitress Sarah was so very nice and attentive. Very large place, to go along with there menu!"
Luke R.,"Milwaukee, WI",143,61,128,4.0,11/18/2015,"Holy dear Lord sweet bearded baby God, I did not expect such high ceilings. Nor did I expect such dirty tables. Or staff in legion. Invisible, cosmic forces flow through several (overall) destructive industrial complexes & meet to pull something like The Cheesecake Factory through the membrane & into this Universe. I was very happily surprised by the falafel salad. Solid falafel & dressing. It was big & they don't skimp on the good stuff. I'm not used to being in places like this & the dominant paradigm radiation bath stuck with me for a bit, but I totally enjoyed the falafel salad. The service was great, too. I feel like the Ghostbusters should take a close look at The Cheesecake Factory."
Nikk T.,"Gary, IN",34,34,6,5.0,7/4/2015,"Great service, food exactly as expected. I always get the same thing each time I dine at a Cheesecake Factory.  This was our first time at this location, and were both pleased with the all around experience. We would definitely be back."
Angie O.,"Shorewood, WI",354,411,274,3.0,9/17/2013,"I've been here several times, and if I had to describe the Cheesecake Factory in one word it would be: overwhelming. I have always had good service here - the wait staff has always been friendly, but sometimes it does take a while to get the check. The food I've gotten has always been good, and the portions are very large so I feel you get your money's worth. But I personally feel that their menu is too large - they literally have everything. You want burgers or steak? They have it. Fish? They have that. Italian? Yep. Chinese/Asian-fusion dishes? Got that too. Normally I would love the variety, but CF goes a little overboard. I have never come here because I am craving a particular food or dish; I come here because I'm bored. As it definitely lies in the realm between expensive and cheap/moderately priced, and I am a very busy person, I don't frequent CF often. But the times I have been here it takes me and my dining partner(s) ages to decide what we want. I mentioned previously the food here is good, but due to the ginormous menu there is a lack of stand-out items. Everything I have ever had is the standard ""pretty good."" Cheesecake Factory's ""thing"" is the cheesecake. With this, I greatly appreciate the variety!! The cheesecakes I have tried have always tasted fresh and are delicious. But the vast majority run $7.95 + tax a piece. The pieces are large, definitely enough to split with another person. When I have a few extra dollars and have had a long day of working, I do like to splurge and get a piece for myself as an ""I can't believe I got through the day"" treat. I have to address the décor. Does anyone else feel like they've stepped into a Vegas casino upon entering the Cheesecake Factory? That could just be me... but I feel like its Caesar's Place meets The Venetian, which leaves me unsure of what look they are going for. And during the dinner rush it gets very loud. Perhaps I'd venture to CF more often if they offered some sort of happy hour special. They are definitely lacking in the specials department. And if they currently offer specials then it is not advertised very well! I'd recommend CF for picky eaters, because they would definitely find multiple dishes to choose from in their book of a menu. I don't recommend CF if you are short on time... or cash."
Vika R.,"Savannah, GA",9,35,125,4.0,4/22/2015,"We've been here a few times in the past and we've always had a pleasant experience. The most recent time was no exception. After trying to find any restaurants that were open on Easter Sunday, we decided to stop in here for lunch. Our waiter was friendly and social, the food was great, and surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded for being one of the few places open. We only had to wait less than 5 minutes to be seated!  My husband and I shared the dynamite shrimp, which were absolutely amazing, and for our main meals, I had the Southwest Chicken sandwich, while my husband opted for the Spicy Crispy Chicken sandwich. My meal was delicious, but the bread was over-toasted, so it was fairly difficult to bite into. My husband enjoyed his meal, as well, except ""spicy"" is the last thing we would call the crispy chicken sandwich. Perhaps we just like our ""spicy"" to equal three alarm fire for our tastebuds.  But despite a few little hiccups, we had a great lunch. I definitely think we'll be back next time we're in Milwaukee."
Shandafay M.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,15,2,2.0,11/30/2015,"Unfortunately as I was prepared to take a bite of my food , my husband jumped up mid meal and left me sitting with my girls. We were perplexed by his abrupt departure but as it turned out.....HE HAD A FINGERNAIL IN HIS FOOD. We were not charged for the food we didnt eat But yeah...it was not a great evening. On a good note the girls were given cheesecake. The manager tried"
Rae M.,"Little Chute, WI",0,14,3,4.0,4/11/2016,"This is 100% my favorite restaurant, hands down. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars: $$$. The prices of most entrees are ridiculous. The food? Amazing. I've ordered a number of different things on the menu, and have been impressed every time. (Would complain about the meatloaf, my husband's last meal there, the onions on top included the onion peeling..not good..but that's about it.) I guess, while I'm getting the negativity out, I was a bit disappointed, when they took the Thai Chicken Pasta off the menu. It was my all time favorite meal, but I'm sure it was removed for low demand reasons. I guess I can understand. People have complained about the menu being too large, but seriously people?! That just means they have variety! In appetizers, entrees, and desserts! People also have complained of wait time. This place is huge. Honestly, we've gone at peak hours once. Waited about 10 minutes for a table, and maybe 15-20 minutes for food. Any other time we've gone we've been seated immediately, and served promptly. This past visit, when we went at peak hours for restaurants, the appetizer was delayed. The manager ended up coming and apologizing for the mishap, and offered the app on him! It ended up coming out with our food (a little disappointing), but the customer service upon handling the situation was superb. He was very considerate and apologetic. Another day were there, we bought another table's meal. In return, our waitress covered our cheesecake! It was an act of kindness, which she definitely did not need to do, and it was an extremely generous and appreciated! The waitstaff is always polite and on point, with the way they serve. I love this place. I don't care if it's a chain. It's delicious, and the employees are great! I used to live in the area and ate there a lot. Now, we live 2 hours north, but return here every chance we get."
Kevin R.,"Port Washington, WI",7,142,3,2.0,12/12/2015,"So, based on the food, this would be 3 stars, but I need to knock it down to 2 for the price and ridiculous menu.  If you have ever been subjected to their menu, you'll know exactly what I am talking about.  20+ pages, 1/2 of which are ads, and a disorganized mess to boot.  Honestly, does this company even realize how stupid their menu is?  Anyways, the real gripe is the price... Now, The Cheesecake Factory has always been expensive, but it has gotten out of hand.  My wife ordered the ceasar salad with chicken - $16.50!... And it had about 2-3oz of chicken.  C'mon, really?  $16.50 for some romaine, shredded parmesan and 1/4 of a chicken breast?!! We also had a cobb salad ($14.95), which was seriously overdressed, and a Cuban sandwich ($12.95) which was barely recognizable as a Cuban sandwich.  If I was actually Cuban, I think I would be insulted. Bottom line - our party had 3 entrees, 2 kids meals (they range $6-9 each), 1 drink (other had water) and the bill was over $80 with tip.  For mediocre chain food?  I should have eaten local rather than a chain.  Oh, I will next time for sure!"
Sue V.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,3,,1.0,2/4/2017,"I don't care how good the food can be. If the service is not good, then the whole experience and food goes down the drain. My compliant is about the hostess. She did not do a good job. We waited more than 1 hour and 30 minutes, as quoted. But somehow 2 seaters and 4 seaters are sitting before our large group. Granted we do have a group of 13 but that doesn't mean we should wait longer than quoted. And an excuse that ""we are waiting for customer to get up from their seat, sorry."" You can simply grab a table from a different section and add it. But instead you choose to wait for a table from that particular section to get up! Is it the users experience that matters the most or you convenience of setting tables up more important?! Just doesn't make sense to me. I'm humiliated and embarrassed that 3 ppl from our group had to leave bc the wait was dragging on too long! Either hire a new hostess with more experience or who has more intuition or give better training! It doesn't take a lot to recognize that a customer isn't happy, especially when they ask more than once when they can be seated! I know I can do a better job. It's common sense and doesn't take a masters degree to figure out what you should do to accommodate all your customers especially when your rely on customers to stay in business!"
R M.,"Two Rivers, WI",0,2,,2.0,2/27/2017,Not a good experience.  My family and I ate there for the first time yesterday and the service was terrible.  They tried to make up for it by giving us free desserts but only compounded the problem as they then had to have the manager remove the desserts from the bill.  Strike one.
Alexis D.,"Glendale, WI",55,7,,2.0,8/15/2016,"I ordered steak, mashed potatoes and broccoli, and my boyfriend ordered Alfredo with chicken. My food came out cold, and his pasta was all clumped together except for maybe 1/3 of it. Afterward we got cheesecake, and we didn't get silverware with it. For the price of dinner, the quality should be much better. This is the 3rd time we've had to sadly make a complaint about something from here. As always though, the cheesecake was great, but unfortunately we will not be back in the near future for food."

I had the chicken tacos. Freaking yuck!! No flavor what so ever and they were cold. I told my waiter and he said. 'Yeah I wouldn't recommend them'. You could have said that before I ordered man."
Hanna E.,"Milwaukee, WI",92,3,,3.0,5/31/2016,"Food was great, service not so much.  We usually have great service but tonight it was lagging.  The server stacked plates in front of us on the table splashing the food and the dirty silver wear almost fell on us. We had a birthday tonight as well,  we had two number candles on the top and it was in a box.  We asked them to bring it out lit, they did but they didn't light our candles, they lit their own that they added to the cake and kept the cake in the box as they brought it out.  Not sure why.  Overall it wasn't terrible but I'm used to better service from them."
