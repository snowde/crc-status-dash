Joanna T.,"Wauwatosa, WI",416,2212,1021,1.0,5/19/2013,"So.........slow......... I'm pretty well indifferent to the Cheesecake Factory, but I'll go if someone else wants to. Today, that someone was my sister and she wanted a late lunch @ CF. it was a catalog of ""fails"": 1. We sat on the patio because it was a gorgeous day. They had the patio heaters on, making the seats near them unbearably hot. FAIL. 2. Our app was delivered without silverware or napkins. FAIL. 3. Our entrees arrived - still no silverware or napkins. FAIL (A kitchen runner took mercy on us and got us ome because our server was nowhere to be seen) 4. When we were finished, we waited. And waited. And waited. We finally gave up and had to beg the check from the hostess, who was not especially pleasant either. FAIL 5. Finally, our server appeared and excused her absences with an ""ohhhemmmgee, I have like 18 tables on the patio and I'm soooooo busy"" Shenanigans, miss - I was one of your tables and there were not 18 people on the patio total. It was 3:30pm and the place was dead - hitting on the bartender does not constitute ""work"". FAIL. Let's face it - I set the bar low when I choose to patronize CF but they managed to come well below it. FAIL."
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",480,1448,1175,3.0,10/9/2013,"Just another cheesecake factory. The host took us to a table that was dirty, the seats were dirty too. I asked him to put us at a different table. I had the pasta here- lunch portion, which was still huge. I really like the bread here, especially the brown bread. The pasta portion for lunch was super filling, I think I was full because of the heavy cream sauce. I was originally planning to have a slice of cheesecake after but I was way too full."
Bri W.,"Milwaukee, WI",74,103,184,4.0,12/29/2013,"After a bit of window shopping or dinner with a friend, go here if your in the area. You may want to look at the menu beforehand if your starving (its massive!!); but good.  Love the pineapple upside down cheesecake and red velvet too. enjoy!!"
Joanne S.,"Brookfield, WI",0,1,,2.0,12/31/2015,"My husband, mother-in-law and I were there Saturday night. It was so dark we had to use the flashlights on our phones to read the menu. I don't know why do you think sitting in the dark is a good thing. We could hardly even see our food. Don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon."
Kristina P.,"Menomonee River Valley, Milwaukee, WI",0,13,12,1.0,8/25/2014,"I think our waiter was high. Slow as hell. My Chinese salad had a wadded up butter wrapper in it. It was my daughter's birthday and they didn't sing to her, even though we mentioned it right away. This place sucks."
Nicole H.,"Milwaukee, WI",153,468,141,2.0,1/2/2013,"I always feel like the hosts here make way more of a production about seating people than it needs to be.  My last visit was about 8 pm on a weekend night and most of the restaurant was empty - despite that, my part of three stood at the host desk for upwards of five minutes while they decided and figured out where to seat us. I'm aware this had to do with figuring out which sections were still open and which servers were not yet cut, but the whole thing was way more difficult than it should have been and just kind of started the whole thing off poorly. It felt like they should be way more organized than they were.   To me, Cheesecake Factory tries to be everything to everyone and therefore is not really anything to anyone, if that makes sense. The menu is giant and overambitious and tends to mean that they do a ton of dishes ok, instead of doing a few dishes spectacularly. I usually find the menu overwhelming and have a hard time deciding on anything.  In the end I had some sort of chicken pasta that was fine, though it came with arugula and the arugula was kind of EVERYWHERE. I think it was meant for garnish (I hope), but it ended up in practically every bite and just so wasn't necessary. It was a warm dish - with random fresh arugula thrown on top. It didn't meld and it didn't enhance - it was just kind of wilty and in the way.  The only memorable part of the experience was the waiting awkwardly to be seated when there were tons of empty tables, which doesn't bode well for any of the food, you know?"
Milwtown D.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,53,67,4.0,2/7/2015,"I love cheesecake factory. Their red velvet cakes are delicious. This place has a gigantic menu and offers  lots of options for your taste buds. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and Steak Dianne are something that one should try. They always serve 2 different kind of bread with butter before your food comes in and the brown bread tastes so good.  From our personal experience, The only issues we had over here are with the servers, they are nice and knowledgeable but I believe that this establishment is huge and always busy, so they forget sometimes if you have special order. I personally don't like Avocado (I know it's weird) and during my 2 different visits, I ordered Fish Tacos and I mentioned that NO AVOCADO PLEASE but I still got them. This is something which will NOT ruin my evening but  some customers take these things very seriously."
Meghan O.,"St. Charles, IL",7,5,4,4.0,8/25/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but one of the main problems of the export emcee is the menu. It is very big and a bit disorganized. I recently ordered take out and called in my favorite order- tomato basil pizza- it was off the menu. I want to eat somewhere reliable. When eating in the actual restaurant the lighting is very dim and one can barley see the menu.  The brown bread served before r meal is absolutely fantastic. It's not only soft but sweet as well! The servers are always very friendly and when asking recommendations along with opinions on dishes, they are very honest.  The Cheesecake Factory is the best place to go for a birthday as well. The birthday song is great and fun.  The bathrooms are beautiful.. Always clean and artistic.  Great for a special event or just a Monday night dinner!"
Dominique S.,"Chicago, IL",211,78,283,4.0,12/11/2015,"Great customer service. Food was fresh and delicious. One star knocked for food taking a while, but they were extremely packed."
Brian M.,"South Milwaukee, WI",23,24,,4.0,12/10/2014,It's the Cheesecake Factory ;  a corporate chain dining experience.  ...and this specific location looks like 99% of the other Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to (the one near Michigan Ave in Chicago is the nicest)... The food is good.  The menu is humongous (maybe too big).  ...and compared to everything similar the prices are more than fair.  That's why there's almost always a wait during normal meal times.
Ashley B.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,2,1,2.0,1/2/2015,"I went in excited to try something new. As soon as I was seated I was disgusted. The silverware wasn't wrapped up in a napkin. Instead it was on the filthy table that looked like it was never washed, or just washed with water. The table needed a scrub brush. The silverware was dirty itself even off the table. Cheese, grease , and all types of stains weren't effortly washed off. Now to the food. The food was expensive. Which had me confused because it wasn't even good. They don't know how to cut up chicken properly. The chicken wasn't effortly cut. There was one big chicken in my Alfredo but looked like they were trying to cut it into three small pieces.  I don't know who our waitress or waiter was because there was over three people coming to our table. I lost count after the third person. I asked for something from one of them and never received what I asked for. My alcoholic beverage was tasty. Didn't really taste the alcohol though. I tasted more ice than alcohol. So I'm guessing the tasty part came from the strawberry that was adding to the glass. Joking. The drink was good even though it was lots of ice. Lastly, the cheesecake. The cheesecake was good. Too much for a slice. Especially since it was my birthday. I probably won't come back to this place unless I'm buying a cheesecake."
Neuy D.,"Chicago, IL",36,403,3,2.0,1/11/2013,"I used to love cheesecake factory but there aren't any in my area so it has been a few years since I've stepped foot in one.  Maybe it is just this locaiton but man have they gone downhill.  First off, the service was good. That part is still the same about the Cheesecake factory.  My plastic water glass had a crack in it (unsanitary because bacteria grows in the crack) and  slowly leaked all over my table.  The food was not that good. It was barely edible. I had the chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce."
Patrice M.,"Wauwatosa, Milwaukee, WI",1,6,10,1.0,3/27/2015,"I am a frequent visit to the Cheesecake Factory (visit about 4-5 times a month with my children ) and this visit on 3/25/14 was the most unpleasant. My server (IGNACIO, P) was not focused. When we ordered our drinks my son ordered root beer and he brought him milk, which he was able to fix upon request. When I placed my order I specifically asked to have the avocado remove (as I am allergic) after 45 minutes our food arrived. The first taco I did not see the avocado as it was at the bottom of the taco. Our server had not returned so I went to the greeter and asked him to get our waiter. The manager was present and prompt and very supportive. I guess what I am really thrown back by is when I paid for my meal, my bill was 22.07, I gave the waiter 40.07 and he gave me $8 back. I then informed the waiter that I had given him 40.07 and he laughed and said oh I'm sorry and gave me $10 with me telling him the amount. This was very suspicious and the straw that broke the camels back. I was satisfied with speaking to the manager and even more pleased that the greeter was nice enough to give me a soda to settle my stomach. I just thought it should be public information that this waiter really needs training on people skills as well as communication, courtesy. Really disappointed.  Patrice"
Paula P.,"South Milwaukee, WI",0,3,,2.0,9/14/2015,"I have eaten here many times in the past; enough times that I know exactly what I love to order when I'm there. I would say that it's been nearly a year since I have last eaten here, and I was really looking forward to their green salad with their delicious blue cheese dressing that has, in the past, automatically come on the side, no request necessary. The salad had become one of my favorites because of the variety of fresh and flavorful greens, a wonderful combination of textures, flavors, and colors, just about exactly as seen here: what I got was a garnished up bowl of what might have been this: pre-dressed, just slathered with what, I will give you, is one of the best ever salad dressings. But slathered. Not on the side, as it had been every other of the dozen plus times I had ordered it. Had it not been for my love of the dressing, I might have quit after the first bite, but I admit, I had been so looking forward to that dressing that I soldiered on, until, a third of the way through, I realized I was not even enjoying the dressing. The server, Ricky, was wonderful, and when I explained my twofold disappointment to him, he was very solicitous and concerned. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go, and when the check came, there was no charge for the cheesecake. I feel as though the waitstaff and whomever authorized the complimentary cheese cake did a wonderful job of customer service, however, I am very unhappy that such a delightful menu item has been replaced with something so obviously inferior. Bring back the real deal, Glendale Cheesecake Factory, people who want to order a salad in a restaurant are looking for quality greens, not soggy, flavorless iceberg."
Julia C.,"Milwaukee, WI",102,1,1,5.0,8/3/2015,Had not been there in years and was surprisingly satisfying! The raspberry white chocolate cheese cake was incredible!
Molly M.,"Shorewood, WI",6,57,45,2.0,5/21/2015,"I feel like the Cheesecake Factory has mediocre food with a high price tag for what you get. The food is nothing special. The cheesecake is delicious, but maybe eat lunch/dinner else where and go here for dessert. The wait staff has always been friendly and efficient. Not my least favorite place, but definitely not my favorite."
Sarah P.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",476,503,259,4.0,7/30/2011,"It's a chain, we all know what it has to offer - I'll keep it short. The Carlton Salad: Romaine Lettuce, Grilled Chicken, Feta Cheese, Avocado, Organic Dried Cranberries, Raisins, Pears, Fresh Orange and Pecans Tossed with Vinaigrette. HO-MY-GOD   Best Salad Ever!   Outdoor seating while munching on this heavenly mix?  Excellent."
Courtney H.,"Cedarburg, WI",0,24,2,3.0,11/4/2014,It is slow but friendly staff.  The best thing about it is its size of the inside. My rice was undercooked and the chicken was the only thing that tasted good.  Cormac 8
Maretchel J.,"Dallas, TX",99,101,66,3.0,4/10/2015,Food is slightly overprice in my book but their portions are HUGE! Went here for happy hour all the apps and select drinks  $5.50 which was a great price. Cheesecake is fabulous though!
Gary H.,"Milwaukee, WI",3,109,2,3.0,9/29/2013,"The food today was fine, but, Oy, do they need to get their stuff together.  A couple of years ago we got into the habit of having lunch at the CF once a week. The manager was  great and the service superb. We even had regular servers stop over to say hi. A bunch of health challenges have changed our lunch planning, but we like to stop in from time to time.  The current day manager seemed to be great. You see she came to our table after I cancelled my sweet potato fries, having already waited 15 minutes for a burger. She explained that she would comp them. I replied that I was finished eating and didn't want them. She offered to give us a dessert. We thanked her and explained it wasn't necessary. Our server was very, very social. I am sure he thought that this constituted service. It doesn't. I told her that while he was a nice young person, he needed additional training. While we waited for 15 minutes, he visited many tables, kneeling at them and chatting up the customers. This might be a tip builder for some; for me it is annoying, especially when I am waiting for my food. I reiterated that we were fine and needed nothing comped. After our table was cleared, we again waited for our  bill. When it finally came, our server said he had asked the manager to comp my burger. I told him I was unhappy with that decision because it is not what I had asked. He asked if there was anything he could do differently. I said, ""yes, listen."" This is a departure from the great times we had at CF in the past and I am hoping it is an anomaly."
