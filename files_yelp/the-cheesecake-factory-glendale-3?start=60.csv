Todd H.,"Denver, CO",56,322,1869,3.0,1/1/2012,"Your average chain establishment. I had the ahi tuna salad, the tuna wasn't seared properly, but it was ok. Service was friendly and prompt. Cheesecake was delicious."
Adin H.,"Glendale, WI",1,71,17,3.0,5/3/2015,"I eat here all the time and now in confused why I keep going back. The pizza here absolutely SUCKS! I had to take off all the pepperoni Cuz it tasted like cardboard and the spaghetti is atrocious. There cheesecakes are really good (obviously) but the other food is terrible. The service is good and it's a nice restaurant. The restrooms are very very nice and quiet, which I like. If you are looking for a restaurant to have a graduation dinner, or a family reunion dinner, this is the place. There are so many people that go, that Italy's so loud there so you won't have to worry about if you're being too loud. Not the best place to eat but f Good for every once in a while."
Brandon E.,"Rockford, IL",39,16,2,4.0,10/11/2014,Great food. Thought it was a little pricey. Overall the atmosphere was nice. VERY clean for a factory. I was a little disappointed that I didn't see any sort of assembly line where the cheese cake was being made. A random person sitting near me kept trying to correct me any time I tried to speak to the factory workers. Would recommend to others.
N. E.,"The Colony, TX",4,19,2,4.0,10/10/2012,"The place is nice. The location is nice as well. Always seems clean. Staff is not as welcoming as you'd think. The wait can be long. I remember the first few times I went there, it'd be over an hour wait. And JAMMED pack. (Weekend). But lately I haven't ran into super busy nights.  Their portions are HUGE and they basically charge you for 2 meals. So if your starving, or want to share a plate with your date, then this is the place for you. But if you just want a quick bite, I'd recommend else where."
Peter C.,"Milwaukee, WI",168,421,542,2.0,1/17/2013,"Yes, there was a big buzz when this place opened up yet I find it to be a calorie bombing chain restaurant without a personality.   I have ate here for lunch and dinner on multiple occasions.  The wait staff is slow and not the best at recommendations or explaining the product.   To my delight they did just add a ""lite"" menu for lunch that has smaller options (their normal salad and pasta dishes could feed 4 people and are 3000+ calories).  These smaller dishes are still huge and could stuff one person or be split by two people comfortably.  The food is pretty run of the mill, nothing special.   The cheesecake, on the other hand, is amazing but that is just a special occasion splurge every now and then."
Nancy R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",255,471,386,3.0,4/12/2012,"Of course, the cheesecake is great and I do enjoy there food.  It is after all just a chain, however. I prefer the local places. I was very disappointed with my last visit because I just stopped in for a beer and dessert.  They only had one Milwaukee beer on the entire menu...Spotted Cow...and the keg was empty. This is sacrilegious in Milwaukee!"
Laura B.,"Two Rivers, WI",8,22,11,1.0,12/3/2013,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to.  Chopped salad had way too much garlic. Factory burger was mediocre and service way to slow, even though the restaurant was empty."
T B.,"New York, NY",122,70,,1.0,6/9/2012,"So, last Sunday a couple of friends and family went to have brunch at this Cheesecake location in Milwaukee. We were in town for a wedding. I've been to the Cheesecake a million times in a million different cities in the country and I love the large portions, great food selections, and of course-the cheesecake. This location was by far the worst Cheesecake I've ever visited. The servers and busboys were terrible. Our particular server-Alex, was so kind, sweet, and accommodating. The hostess was rude and obnoxious. The busboys who were cleaning up the tables on the patio were dropping glasses, spilling water everywhere, laughing, and essentially spoiling a perfectly good weekend brunch.  I won't be going back to this location since the managerial staff appeared just as incompetent as the rest of the staff."
Sandy S.,"Duluth, MN",14,210,30,5.0,9/30/2012,"My sister took me here for lunch.  I opted for the trio of soup, half sandwich and Caesar salad.  It was all very good but I did think the bread/toast had too much butter on the outside.   Then we split a piece of turtle cheesecake.  It was good but really too much.  I would have liked a sampler of very small cheesecake squares or balls or something.  I'll try a different type of cheesecake if I go again."
Robert S.,"West Bend, WI",0,5,,3.0,3/17/2015,"All in all a satisfactory experience. I had a shrimp pasta which was well seasoned and left me satisfied. Try the Godiva chocolate cheesecake- we took a slice home and it didn't even last the rest of the night it was so savory. Only minor critiques would be with service quality. The menu is quite extensive and takes a bit to sift through (even if you've been there before like I had) and I felt as though our server was a bit pushy trying to get us to order. Also, my water was only refilled once the entire visit (and I had to ask for it). It wasn't too much of a problem though because I was enjoying a delicious strawberry lemonade (also recommendable). In general, my visit was decent."
Maggie M.,"Chicago, IL",169,78,83,3.0,9/13/2013,"The cheesecake factory is what it is. The outdoor seating at this location was awesome though. My review is mainly to let fans know that the Navajo Sandwich was taken off of the menu. I don't even order the Navajo! My friend that I ate lunch with though was so disappointed by it's removal from the menu, I felt compelled to let others know. My friend and our waiter spent a good minute talking about how sad they were that this item was recently taken off the menu. So Navajo fans, be prepared for disappointment. On another note, the skinnylicious menu rules."
Marshall S.,"San Diego, CA",53,102,8,3.0,1/16/2012,"One word to describe this place: Huge. The menu is huge, the building is huge, the portions are huge. I've been to several Cheesecake Factories and they are all about the same. I usually don't like to go to chains, but it seems to be a frequent dining options for birthdays or other occasions.  It is a good place for groups since they have the space to accommodate large tables. The food is generally good, the servers are generally good, and there is something for everybody on their menu.  One food I always get is the Texas Eggrolls. Delicious, greasy, and almost a meal by themselves. I usually pass on the cheesecake since I'm full from the huge portions, but they always look delicious."
Kelsey S.,"Milwaukee, WI",144,409,90,4.0,7/2/2011,"It only seems fitting to write this with a slice of cheesecake next to the computer.  Having been to the Cheesecake Factory off and on throughout the past few years, I've often felt kinda ""meh"" about it -- good variety, but overpriced for okay food.  While shopping at Bayshore yesterday, my husband requested that we pay the Factory a visit.  We were pleasantly surprised to find better-than-usual food, accompanied by even better service.  Seated immediately (impressive for a beautiful Friday evening at 7 pm), our server was attentive, provided good recommendations, and was just generally pleasant to be around. We started with the stuffed mushrooms small plate ($4.95), which featured six mushrooms stuffed with cheese.  Portion-wise, I wouldn't recommend splitting this among more than two people, but for us, it was perfect.  As an entree, I ordered the Chicken Di Pana ($13.50) -- lightly breaded chicken breast pan-fried friend and served over a white wine sauce and with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  As usual with the Cheesecake Factory, the portion was gigantic.  It was definitely delicious too.  I can't recall ever having something so tasty there.  My husband ordered the Steak Diane & Chicken Madeira ($19.99) combination plate and raved about the flavors and tenderness of the steak.  We both agreed we'd readily repeat these orders again in the future. And, of course, you can't leave without a slice of cheesecake.  Knowing we were taking ours to go anyway, we opted for one each, including a slice of the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake and the Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake.  I don't remember the cost of these particular ones, but slices average around $7 and are large enough to feed a small village.  Tasty tasty tasty.  But who would expect any less from a place with Cheesecake in the name? Overall, our bill averaged out to around $62.  This wouldn't be our every day pick by any means, and we generally prefer local spots to the national chains, but this was a nice once-in-a-while treat, and I'm sure we'll be back again sometime."
Nicole A.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,6,,5.0,6/18/2015,"Food is AMAZING!!!! Obviously the cheesecake is to die for as well. I am a re-occurring customer, but I went in recently and had an amazing server, Kimberly. She rocked! I will for sure be back!"
Traci P.,"Salem, WI",1,31,1,1.0,12/17/2014,"I called in advance to order 3 slices of cheesecake to go. We came in 20 minutes later to find our order had not been prepared.  Even though we called our order in advance we had to wait as long as people who had just come in to order, I don't understand the point of placing a telephone order if we could have walked in and waited regardless, they should have explained when we called that placing orders in advance was only a courtesy."
Jen L.,"Greendale, WI",0,22,,5.0,7/30/2014,Fantastic service from beginning to end every time we come here. We always get BBQ pizza. It always seems to be old dough. The gluten is breaking down and the pizza is doughy. This doesn't happen as much at Mayfair. Overall a decent experience. If you are here for the cheesecake and you like tiramisu get the dessert instead. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake always makes everyone happy.
Rita B.,"Schaumburg, IL",22,150,31,4.0,9/10/2011,"Working late around Milwaukee leaves one with very few options for good, sit-down, late night dinners. Luckily, Cheesecake Factory was open! I travel to WI for work once a week so hotel food is yuck.  My server was Lea (think that's how you spell it). She was not only very friendly but she was hilarious! Great recommendations (even though I've been to CF sooooo many times). Half way through dinner, Lea's shift ended so Nicole was my new server. She too was awesome!  Now, on to the food...I had a new item on the menu. It is called ""Mac and Cheese Burger"". Let me just say that it was DELICIOUS!!! It was so good and filling. I didn't touch my fries and was only able to conquer half of my burger.  I don't know how else to encourage someone to try this burger except that  YOU GOTTA TRY THIS BURGER! It's the bomb diggity."
Bao Y.,"Maplewood, MN",28,49,34,3.0,8/4/2014,"The mister and I decided to eat here for our date night, and it was national cheesecake day so all slices of cheesecake were half off, score! There was quite a wait so we got our little buzzer and went outside to enjoy the fresh air, after about 30 mins we were seated. I had the tomato basil pasta, the portion was ginormous, well a lot more pasta than I could ever eat in one sitting. The chicken on the pasta was a little dry and lacking in any flavor but the pasta noodles were perfect and the combination of the basil and tomato was delicious. The mister had some steak and chicken combo plate with mashed potatoes. The potatoes were my favorite part of his dish, super buttery!! The steak and chicken were smothered in some mushroom sauce which I thought was just a way to cover up the lack of flavor from the meat. But even with all their food options the Cheesecake Factory is supposed to be better known for the cheesecake right? Sadly we were too full to order more than one slice which was the 30th anniversary cheesecake with chocolate cake, it was delicious with fresh whipped cream, and it was a ginormous slice, but I don't know if I'd regularly want to pay $8 for a slice of cheesecake, good thing we got it for half that price, and it was date night. Our waiter was nice but very busy, and only came back a few times to hurriedly ask us if we needed anything, which is fine since it was so busy. Overall, I'm too cheap to pay the prices for the food here that I feel I can make myself at home, and more to my liking. Sorry no pictures this time, forgot my phone."
Julie O.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,24,,4.0,10/28/2013,We love the Cheesecake Factory at Bayshore! There is a huge variety of menu items to choose from....even with a group everyone can find something they like. The portions are enormous so I usually solve that problem by ordering an appetizer. And I always take a slice of cheesecake to go....which keeps me in dessert for two or three days! I like the consistency.
Malek K.,"Milwaukee, WI",29,75,96,4.0,3/8/2011,You can find many many choices for everyone with different taste and their desert are soo tasty - the only thing is that the plates are huge so usually not enough room left for deserts Remember their plates are huge!!! so what i do is i order always to go - and get a plate with it - i put half on my plate and the other half take it home - they have chicken Marsala excellent choice Da Vinci Pasta good choice Pizza many choices Factory burger !! best sandwish go for the one with bacon  Miso Salmon i love it especially the buttery sauce  Steak - filet mignon - the safe choice Orange chicken if you feel chinese Fish taco or burritto (huge) f you feel mexican Omelette for power breakfast  Lettuce Wrap are amazing Avocado Eggrolls is good too Tuna is good tooo they have everything - also many salads - it is important if you order also a side of chicken they wll get you a good size and you can incorporate with your salads these are some tricks it cost 3 $ the size of chicken - grilled chicken very nice many drinks you can taste their Lemonade - i love it  their deserts are amazing you have to pick the godiva cheesecake or oreo cheesecake or just the Plain one! all of them are amazing!!  their service is all relevant on who is the server so i will not rate it but the place is like any other cheesecake nice ambiance - nice place  expect to pay 25 $ or so
