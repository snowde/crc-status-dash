Roberto R.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,37,,4.0,6/21/2014,"Consistently good food, they even have a gluten free menu, and the cheesecakes, insane variety, always hit the spot.  Portions can be a bit ridiculously large, especially with the salads, but better too much than not enough, plus you can take it home.  I've had very good experiences there.  The one thing that bothers me is that they don't take reservations after 5pm if I recall correctly."
Brad E.,"Milwaukee, WI",53,338,91,3.0,11/8/2011,"The ambience is like a fancy Egyptian inspired and Vegas-type atmosphere. We came for drinks, appetizers and desserts. The onion rings are not that great, but the chicken samosas and calamari were winners. The cheescake was delicious (go pumpkin!) I would save an outing here for special occasions, it's a little pricey."
Chris S.,"New York, NY",5,101,,1.0,11/13/2012,"I am not really sure what the appeal is with a place like the Cheesecake factory. Their cakes may be good, but I don't typically like cake and these cakes weren't that good. This is a place for comfort foods at about as standard as you can ever hope to achieve. Cheesecake factory is just not my type of place."
Joya W.,"Milwaukee, WI",5,24,,3.0,5/21/2012,I've been a few times. The service is average.  The decor is average. The food is delicious but I've had better. My favorite is the 4 cheese pasta. You can definitely tell this place is a chain restaurant The cheesecake is the best I've tasted. I would go again but I would like to try other places before I do so.
Noabeth S.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,16,,2.0,5/10/2015,"Thank god this place has good cheese cake because everything else is pretty bad. We recently went to the one at bayshore and we will not be coming back. The fact that the menu is 10 or so pages long shows that the meals won't be anything special. We started off with the tex mex eggrolls which were actually better then the entree itself. We then split a full size pasta dish, which was nothing special and could easily whip this up at home, which says something because I suck at cooking. The cheesecake did make this trip worth it, the mango slice was very good. So the food was disappointing and to top this off - our server was HORRIBLE. She had trouble with any serving tasks. She asked us multiple times in a short amount of time if we were ready to order, we can't look through a 10 page menu in 3 minutes. She only told us the specials after we asked. We had to ask for our water to filled 3-4 times. She also brought our entrees out when we weren't even half way done with our appetizer. We also noticed she completely screwed up the tables order next to us. The hostess was more pleasant to us then she was. Bad food and incompetent servers. We would give it one star if it wasn't for the good cheesecake. Also this place has very ugly decor and the whole building is just very strange and does not look good."
Ryan D.,"Milwaukee, WI",27,54,15,2.0,4/20/2010,"Is it bad that the only thing I can remember about my experience here was the ridiculous wait for a table? ...If you are an overpriced chain restaurant that wants 5 stars, yes.. yes it is.  No really though, I can remember nothing else about my experience at this Cheese Cake Factory."
Susan T.,"Oak Creek, WI",1,27,3,2.0,1/3/2010,"My kids loved it when we went there and can't wait to go back. I told them for the amount of money we spent, it would be awhile before we all go back. The service was OK, even though we noticed that people who arrived quite awhile after we did, had their orders taken first. The cheesecakes all look delicious, but they are so expensive that I don't think they are really worth getting after having a meal there. I think the next time I would go, it would just be for dessert."
Eli M.,"Milwaukee, WI",15,15,,2.0,11/21/2009,"SUPER overpriced, service is not horrible, but nothing to remember, food is not really very good. Definitely not even the best chain food at Bayshore, it's possible that Applebarf's is better. Lower the prices by 50-60% to bring them in line with the quality of food served.  Desserts can be awesome if you pick the right one, but 2 pieces of cheesecake would cost more than dinner at a restaurant that serves 2x better food.  For some reason the CCF under the Hancock tower in CHI is 2x better than any of the mall stores I have been to."
Jamie J.,"Thiensville, WI",0,27,,2.0,2/21/2012,"Oddly pretentious.  Tables too close together.  I had the calamari -- sent it back, it was RAW.  My partner begged for condiments like parmesan cheese, that came in dribs and drabs from a harried waitress.  Overpriced, over rated."
