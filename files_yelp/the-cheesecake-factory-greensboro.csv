Christina L.,"Summerfield, NC",127,137,97,3.0,11/19/2017,"Best Chicken Piccata I've ever had! But go when they're not on a wait. We went on Saturday night when one of the local universities had a earlier football game, so they were predictably slammed. No problem with them being busy, but the host staff did struggle to give accurate quote times. We we're quoted 40 minutes, but waited over an hour to be seated. They would only put parties of 2 at 2-tops, which is of course maxing their seating capacity by not seating us at a 4-top that came open well before our 2-top, but when you're over quote there should be an exception to that practice. Also, we never got an apology or even an acknowledgement that we had waited well in excess of the quoted time. We also had to ask for menus while we waited... should be standard practice. We were encouraged to wait on a heated patio, and we're curious as to why they don't turn that into a dining area. Maybe the kitchen wouldn't be able to keep up with that many more tables. We had to go to the crowded bar to get drinks. 10 minute wait for those as well. Once seated, our Server came and introduced herself and inquired about a drink order. We had already made our decisions about drinks, appetizers, entrees, and of course cheesecake, due to the long wait for the table. But there wasn't any attempt to consolidate her steps of service, so we laid it out for her before she could run off. She was friendly and efficient otherwise. Edamame was a nice starter, served with kosher salt and maybe a hint of garlic. My Chicken Piccata was absolutely sublime. Creamy and delicious, and a generous portion. My dining companion's steak Madeira was unfortunately well done despite being ordered medium-rare. The second one was perfect, but by then I was nearly done with my entree, making it awkward. She was offered a salad while she waited, but I was not offered anything in recognition of the uneven finish times. Small thing, really, but a good best practice to adopt in an upscale restaurant in my opinion. And still no manager visited us. I'd definitely go again, but not on a busy night. And avoid the $15 martinis."
Steve A.,"High Point, NC",15,9,,1.0,1/7/2018,"The final straw for The Cheesecake Factory for me. The wait for a table wasn't bad, but the entire place smelled like the patina of an old diner. The menus were insanely grimy and the food was ridiculously slow to arrive. We spent a total of two hours in there from sit down to departure because the wait for everything was long. Our server was attentive, but a little dry and it was a bit off putting when they reached out from the podium to hand my wife an extra wrap of flatware and napkin. The food was ok, I had Shrimp Carbonara. They were very heavy-handed with the peas and bacon, though. The portion size was really small for the $20 price and I had actually wondered if I was mistakenly served a lunch portion.  Overall, I've been very underwhelmed by my last few experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, and I'll rule it out as a dining option going forward."
Miranda H.,"Lexington, NC",34,13,,3.0,11/12/2017,"Great food as usual. This time I didn't get my normal orange chicken, I got fish and chips instead. I really like them and will try them again in the future.  My #1 concern is the slippery floor. Why is the floor always so dang slippery? Every-time we go it's always like that. I've been to the one in Charlotte numerous times and never recall the floor being that slippery."
Megan V.,"Greensboro, NC",190,80,208,2.0,8/11/2017,"The inside of The Cheesecake Factory is grand, loud, and touristy like a restaurant at Universal or Disney World. The menu was incredibly extensive, and everyone had a hard time parsing through it to pick their food.  Maybe it's just us, but no one in our party of 5 liked their meal. Is that a coincidence?  I ordered a crispy shrimp pasta with diced tomatoes, various leafy greens, all in a lemon cream sauce. I thought it was safe enough. Someone was very heavy handed on the parsley, lending the dish a lot of grittiness. Shrimp had 0% crispness, got soggy in the pasta sauce. No go :(  We got the strawberry cake to try and save the meal - beware, it is most definitely not cake! It's more like 2 ice cream sandwiches with thick sugar cookies, and 4 inches of whipped cream on top. Maybe 2 cut up strawberries at the bottom.  All in all, we were grandly disappointed. Maybe we should get a cheesecake. _______________________________  EDIT 8/19/17 Not sure what's worse - guest services having to apologize on a review, or guest services obviously skimming and apologizing for something I didn't order..."
Oana D.,"High Point, NC",28,50,264,4.0,11/5/2017,"We waited over 20min for 2 slices of cheesecake. Is it that good? Why yes it is. Why not a 5 star then? Because as much money as I'm paying for these 2 slices, these Togo lines need to move along. I'm not ordering a bunch of dinners Togo, it's cheesecake that's already made, there's no reason it should take 20 min for someone to put it in a box a hand it to me."
Michael S.,"Kernersville, NC",117,543,688,2.0,7/31/2017,"Not unlike any other Cheesecake Factory, this one too leaves a lot to be desired....as service goes! Arriving at 10am on a Sunday, ordering three apps, Cheesecake, and not walking out until a little after 1pm.  That's got nothing to do with extended conversations either! We watched server after server com out to the dining area practically auctioning off plates of food as none of them knew where to take them! That's so embarrassing for them, and unacceptable for the customers! We had to ask our server for our apps, nearly a hour after ordering them! The cheesecakes are phenomenal as usual, and on National Cheesecake Day we sampled three for 1/2 price!  You can't go wrong with ANY of them, but know it's the ONLY thing that keeps this chain alive!!"
Rita H.,"Thomasville, NC",94,19,158,2.0,11/12/2017,"Slow service today:  kept having to remind our server what we asked for, what we were waiting for. Just not worth the drive and the money when you have nothing to drink with your food when it finally comes.  The food was good. Service Poor. 2 stars today."
Tia B.,"Greensboro, NC",2,23,4,1.0,1/10/2018,"If I could give this no stars I would! Walked in for dinner on a Wednesday night was seated in a booth, waited about 15 mins a waitress finally walked by. We asked where our waitress was, she stated she would be arriving to work in about 6 minutes. Not sure why they seated us here, because the area was closed. We decided to move to the bar, walked up to the bar to dirty plates, the bartender walks by me goes in the kitchen...leaves dirty dishes there and me standing. The waitress from the back walks up with our bread and places it down to go look for the bartender. After 15 mins of standing we decided to walk out. For this name to be under the Chessecake Factory establishment, it is HORRIBLE. Clearly a management issue, oh and the cute girls standing at the podium to greet you are pointless. We had to walk up to them to say we were there to be seated. This was my third bad experience, first time writing about it. Will NOT be going back to this location. The place was far from busy and packed, not sure how they survive the weekend rush."
Stephanie B.,"Greensboro, NC",0,1,,2.0,1/5/2018,"I have been to this location twice, and on my most recent visit with my husband, I was quite disappointed. I understand it is their policy to not take reservations, but after waiting 45 minutes outside in the cold (waiting area inside was quite crowded) I expected we would have better service at the table. Took twenty minutes to have someone greet us at our table, and that was only because I asked a server if we could have two waters. Took an additional twenty to get a cup of coffee. Our server was not friendly or welcoming. The food was good, but the service was definitely a damper on the whole meal. Probably won't go back."
David L.,"Greensboro, NC",33,158,38,3.0,9/21/2017,"This is the second Cheesecake Factory location we have visited and have decided that it is not a restaurant we want to go for a meal, but is a destination when we are looking for a good dessert.  We visited a location in Charlotte and the one here in Greensboro.  The service at both was below par for a meal and the food was just passable.  But we did enjoy the cheesecake!  And others in the groups had other desserts that were very quickly consumed.  It is a shame they can't get their service and meal act together so you could get a great meal and excellent dessert at the same place.  But it does give us a place to go to after a great home cooked meal to be able to top it off with a relaxing and enjoyable dessert."
Nicole N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",140,148,122,3.0,3/4/2017,"I have been waiting for months to go here because I figured from the previous reviews that they needed to work out some kinks. I was hoping time would improve the overall quality & experience. Sadly, I left a little disappointed. Let's start with parking; there is never going to be a parking spot in front of the restaurant. Just go straight to the right and park in the larger lot and save yourself some time.  The wait is absolutely ridiculous! It doesn't matter what time or day you go (talking from experience, this was our third attempt) they will always quote you anywhere from an hour to a three hour wait. I swear they are banking on the fact that you hang out in their bar area and keep ordering drinks. Now let's talk about the drink list. You can pretty much find whatever you're looking for ... cocktails, wine, beer (even good craft beer options) & an endless supply of whiskey choices. However, this is the only section on the menu that doesn't give the price. It leads me to believe that this is where they are making most of their profit. A craft beer from Asheville cost $7 and a whiskey cocktail cost $12 (I think this is a little steep).  The menu itself is expansive; even the pickest eater can find something they like. I think this is where the confusion occurs with the servers, there is just too much to memorize. Even our server was honest and said that she didn't know when I asked her a question about one of the cocktails.  Everything is good, I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory chain for years and have never been disappointed with the food  and that still remains true. P.S. - you have to get cheesecake, that was the whole foundation for the restaurant in the first place... at the very least you can get it to go :-D My reservations on returning are as follows: parking is a nightmare. Everybody is racing to either get your spot or steal the spot you want. The wait is just simply ridiculous. Greensboro has other great restaurants, even in the same plaza that are comparable in food (if not better) and will seat you right away. The drinks are way over priced. When I go out I usually like one drink before dinner and one during... I just can't convince myself that it's okay to pay $24 for two drinks that I can make at home.  With that being said maybe I'll try the to-go option next time if I find myself really craving the chicken Madeira & cheesecake."
Karla B.,"Kernersville, NC",15,1,3,2.0,9/4/2017,"First time ever eating here and it wasn't good as some make it out to be. We ate outside and I'm glad I made that choice, because it's really loud inside. It sounds like an auditorium that was on a long intermission with the lighting still dimmed, lol! As for the menu can we say overwhelmed?! I like choices and all but damn y'all!  If the prices were lower I probably wouldn't feel as if I rolled the dice and everything I bet, I lost.  Anyway I may try it again, but no time soon. The way my budget is set up I'll enjoy a whopper jr. first any day."
Alex R.,"Greensboro, NC",249,359,155,2.0,1/4/2017,"The only thing I liked about this place may have been...the lighting? Maybe? I will say it was clean. That was good.  The atmosphere was decent and interesting.  It was a bit heavy handed for my taste.  The table/booth two seaters were very close together and made the dining experience a little awkward. But yea, the lighting was nice.  Our waitress was great to start off with! She was nice and personable.  After we ordered, shift change happened and our new waitress was very slow. We spent half the meal with less than a half glass of water. She didn't ask if we wanted more until after she took our bill. Really?! When we are getting ready to leave? No thanks.  This menu was ridiculous.  They have 6 pages of ""specialties."" Six pages?! Of specialties? Everything ranging from pasta to tacos to burgers and hibachi. Seriously? I would recommend trimming the menu so you can focus on doing a handful of dishes very well instead of dozens upon dozens of dishes less than mediocrely.  My pasta carbonara with chicken was terrible. I had to load this thing up with salt and pepper as it literally had ZERO seasoning on it at all. The sauce was very watery and didn't hold to the pasta very well at all. The bacon had no crunch to it and became very chewy. The chicken looked and tasted like it had been boiled. It was awful; no color. Honestly, I could have made this much better for about half the cost. I ate about 9 bites to make sure I wasn't crazy and then boxed it up. At least at home I could doctor it up a little bit to make it eatable.  I also had the carrot cake cheesecake. It was confusing. The cream cheese icing in top was nice.  Pass..."
Erik S.,"Greensboro, NC",87,211,198,4.0,11/15/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is a favorite of my wife and I, as it was one of the first places we ate at when we first started dating, albeit at the Durham location. We were very excited to learn that a location was being built in Greensboro, but as with many others, were a little perplexed to hear about where exactly they were going to cram this thing in at Friendly Shopping Center. Full disclosure: We knew that the wait times were going to be ridiculous. They have never not been ridiculous at any location we have ever been to. I would assume they are even worse than usual at this location, since it is definitely one of the smaller ones I have seen, and i'd guess would be even worse on a hot or cold day, as the patio seating would lose some of the appeal. With that in mind, we came here at 8:30pm on a Thursday night. To our elation, the wait was a short 10 minutes. Based on the feedback of others, we will continue to only come here during ""Off"" times. Nothing has changed on the food front. The food is very good, which is why people wait for it. This is consistent across the locations. The menu is huge, and that would normally be a turn-off, but for the fact that they actually do most all of it pretty well. I could list everything I've ever had at these places, but really it isn't necessary, just know that you're going to get good food once you get seated. You could tell this location is not a well oiled machine yet. Lots of confusion up front, lots of disarray in what I'm guessing is the kitchen. Our server did the best he could, kept us informed, got us the items as they became available, and was super friendly... but here were the mess ups: No bread, we waited quite a while for any bread at all, and it was only 1 of the 3 types. For awhile, they were out of tea, so my wife and I shared hers until more got brewed. Up front, there was just a backlog of people who all got summoned together, so no one really knew who was supposed to follow who. I am sure that everyone else who has reviewed is 100% right, there is absolutely no way that the parking situation here is even slightly passable during the hours where other businesses in the shopping center are running. We avoided this mess by coming so late, but I would think that during the normal lunch hours, you are going to have a very hard time parking. I would suggest parking in the back of the Whole Foods lot across the side street there. I would also suggest dropping off your car-mate and having them get in line while you search. This is just a horribly selected location by the ownership. This restaurant needed to be bigger, and there certainly needed to be a lot more parking consideration made. I hope the other restaurants nearby are getting rent discounts due to this nightmare. FOUR stars is a generous review given by me, based on my experiences at the chain in general, and the hope that this location becomes better with time and experience."
Vivian M.,"Stokesdale, NC",8,7,,1.0,10/14/2017,I have visited many as we love this franchise but OMG !!!  What happened here??? There is always something wrong with the food.  Can't even get the salads correct.   Been there more than 10 times and they always forget the chicken in my Santa Fe salad.    The staff is friendly and they try to correct mistakes from the kitchen right away but the kitchen needs help.   So excited when we heard one was coming to Greensboro and given it many chances but please I'm tired of getting my food order  wrong.
Wendy N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",69,231,180,4.0,10/20/2016,"I had lunch here yesterday; they just had their Grand Opening the day before, so it's still more of a training session than a smooth operation, but I had a very nice lunch in lovely surroundings. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, so I was surprised at how beautiful the interior was, especially for a place with ""Factory"" in their name. The place was PACKED at 11:55 a.m., and my coworker and I considered ourselves lucky to snag an open bartop table inside (there was one remaining available table on the covered patio offered to us).  The menu is pages and pages and pages long, but rather than overwhelming me, it just made me want to come back a million times to try everything they are offering. I had a wild mushroom soup that was delicious, an egg roll sampler that was pretty good, and the tres leches cheesecake was divine! The food here is 5-star.  The service is what prompted my 4-star review. Everyone working here is friendly and delightful, but like I said, this was day two for them and things just weren't quite ready for prime time. I had to repeatedly request a straw, the servers (working in tandem) didn't know what all came on a sandwich we inquired about (coworker has to avoid avocados currently), my lunch was delivered but then the manager/server blinked at my coworker and asked if she had ordered anything to eat (she had), she was eventually given a sandwich that she hadn't ordered, then she was given the sandwich that she actually did order, little annoyances like that. And it took us TWO HOURS to get out of there... that is unacceptable for a lunch ""hour.""  I think once they work out the kinks and get more smooth/confident with the service, this is going to be a fabulous place to eat. I'm excited about this very welcome addition to the Greensboro restaurant scene!"
Jasmine D.,"Winston-Salem, NC",2,8,8,2.0,9/3/2017,"Soooo I am a very huge fan of spinach dip and I actually was craving some today, so I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory. The spinach dip that I ordered was very bland, the artichokes were huge, kind of watery, lacked the creamy consistency, and it was just a disappointment altogether that cost nearly $14 with tax. DEFINITELY WILL NOT be ordering spinach dip from here again."
Stephen Y.,"Oak Ridge, NC",21,92,67,4.0,6/18/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory seems infamous for its poor service, but I've been twice (once with a group of four and once with a group of three), and I haven't noticed any huge issues with the service, although wait time for the food is a bit on the long side. Seating has always been within 20 minutes, which is an acceptable amount of time to wait for me. Parking, however, is pretty terrible. There's parking at the shops nearby that you'll probably have to utilize. The interior ambiance is nice, with an upscale, glitzy feel and well-themed decorations. The food is definitely good and tasty, but not anything exceptionally special. In my opinion, it's also overpriced. In terms of a minor issue, for me, the huge range of menu selections actually works against the experience, complicating it rather than enhancing it. I'd like to try all of the flavors that Cheesecake Factory has to offer, but I'd prefer that they condense those flavors into a select few representative dishes so that I don't have to flip through all 20+ pages of the menu trying to decide what I want. Overall, though, I'd consider this Cheesecake Factory in the future for gatherings with friends and family dinners in a setting that feels slightly more high class than a typical restaurant experience."
Pragna A.,"Greensboro, NC",361,226,708,3.0,3/6/2017,"This time we had a Gift Card and wanted to take advantage of it. We were here on a Sunday afternoon and wait time for 2 people was about 45 minutes . The table we got this time was alright and not as bad as the one we got last time near the bar area. Our first round of appetizers came in quickly and we chowed down in few minutes ,we ordered another appetizer and main which took a very long time about another 30 minutes to come out, Our waitress was serving numerous tables and was busy and didnt quite think about us for a while . Someone else served our rest of the order and I got Chicken and Biscuits for Main . There were 3 tiny tenderloins of chicken with huge pile of mash and dry biscuits in this dish which was $18 .I have been to Cheesecake Factory in few other places and I never got lucky with a Main Dish that does justice to the price ,may be if I ever go back I would stick to ordering appetizers to justify the price."
Abry O.,"Greensboro, NC",115,15,,3.0,11/2/2017,"The food is absolutely delicious but I can't ever go back, I've been there twice and both times I have had diarrhea (TMI, I know) but the pain I get after eating there is unbearable. Hope this doesn't happen for anyone else!"
Mike D.,"Jamestown, NC",15,4,,2.0,8/20/2017,"This was my 4th visit,we were looking forward to the Cuban sandwich. This was not available, the service was the worst we have ever experienced- our server disappeared for 15 minutes and we had to grab another server to bring forgotten items.  Net result I will delete this restaurant from my list until I hear they get their act together."
Barrie P.,"Winston-Salem, NC",182,541,554,4.0,3/24/2017,"I really enjoyed my first visit to this location of the Cheesecake Factory. The service and food were very good. We came at a great time and did not have to wait and our waitress was very understanding of us having a baby. We started out with the delicious bread and a bacon grilled cheese appetizer. The grilled cheese was buttery, crisp, and delicious. I had the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. It was pretty good but a tad too sweet for me and needed more shrimp based on the price. My husband's pasta dish was really good and next time I come to the Cheesecake Factory I think I will order Italian. We were so full that I had to take my cheesecake to go. I try the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake which was really really good."
Jtc C.,"Durham, NC",5,119,18,2.0,1/15/2017,This review is getting 2stars because I do like the food at Cheesecake Factory. I was planning an office lunch for about 8 people and wanted to call it in ahead of time in order to plan ahead and not wait until the last minute I called 2 days before and one day before. I had no problem paying for the 300$ order in advance like I do with most other restaurants. Nope - they wouldn't let us call it in until the day of and also not until they opened - this was also 30 minutes before the time I needed to pick it up. I do about 3 of these lunches per week. Will be using outback in the future because of their much more accommodating policy. Also- they don't give you bread with your to go order.
Pat F.,"High Point, NC",8,24,24,5.0,11/26/2017,"Excellent food. Had the skinny pasta. Huge serving size, super tasty with fresh basil. Service was great. Lets not forget the cheesecake, Godiva chocolate.  Off the chart.Would recommend this to all. Some prices were a little high for some dishes but all in all good food and decent prices."
Philippe B.,"Morrisville, NC",2,6,18,2.0,1/26/2017,"This was my first time going to Cheesecake Factory so I had very few expectations about what I was in for. This location is usually packed but we hit it just before the first dinner rush so service was prompt and friendly. Upon being seated we received two sprawling menus ""skinnylicious"" and standard. While both offer a huge number of choices, upon further inspection most of the items were variations on a theme(chicken and mashed potatoes or pasta) with only small details to separate the various entrees.  The food itself was nothing to write home about, both dishes we order received a 'meh' response. The chicken & biscuit dish was a poorly conceived imitation of the traditional southern dish with pan gravy with peas and carrots instead of red eye gravy and grilled chicken instead of fried. The actual biscuits were fine but mashed potatoes were an odd savory choice to go with the dish.  Evelyns pasta dish was a slightly healthier option but were slightly dry and rather cold as if the pasta had been sitting for a while. The dish was also overwhelmingly garlicky.  Now that I've been I don't think I'll ever be tempted to go again with such good alternatives in the immediate vicinity but the prices were reasonable and portions fair."
Kevin S.,"Greensboro, NC",3,14,,1.0,5/29/2017,"Okay, 2 nights in a row in our hometown we've had a terrible dining experience.   I am being kind and offering 2 stars, only because our waiter was exceptionally apologetic over the insane amount of time it took the kitchen to deliver a hamburger. The food was decent.  Our waiter was good, but the kitchen messed up a burger and it took nearly 45-minutes to get another one - and they aren't even busy! The manager also stopped by the table with a very insincere and obligatory half-hearted acknowledgement of their mistake - with no apology, or attempt to make things better. Again - there are many choices in Greensboro, this probably shouldn't be one of them. After watching the manager stuff his face while we waited for my son's food, had to drop them to 1-star.  2 was borderline anyway."
Chad T.,"Greensboro, NC",44,114,13,5.0,6/12/2017,Went here for the first time Friday night.. They were crowded so was expecting a wait. To my surprise we got seated right away. We choose to sit out on the patio area which was nicely done. The whole place had a nice glow that lit up the whole restaurant. I ordered the meatloaf and a side of baked mac and cheese. Everyone has said the portions are huge but its something you really have to see for yourself.. My meatloaf could of fed 4 people.. in fact I was eating on it the next day for breakfast and lunch. The mac and cheese was perfect and came served in its own skillet.  I'm glad I got to finally visit this cheesecake factory location. everything seemed great  from the staff to serving time of food.
Johnnie W.,"Greensboro, NC",0,59,23,2.0,5/1/2017,"Do you love to wait 25 minutes for your meal? Do you love to wait 37 minutes to be seated? Do you like to spend $19.95 for chicken Alfredo? If you said, YES to all the above this place is for you. NEXT!!!!"
Jim K.,"Greensboro, NC",101,366,162,3.0,11/3/2016,"This place is a huge hit in Greensboro!  While still in their honeymoon period, Cheesecake Factory has everything going for it to be a top draw: great ambiance, extensive menu ( there's something for everyone), great location, and knowledgeable service.  We had an hour wait for our table on a Wednesday night and there was still a waiting line at 9 when we left.  While the crowds will most likely dissipate in coming months, this place will probably always have a line.  I strongly recommend making a reservation, especially if you have a party of more than four. For a chain restaurant, the food is really good.  I had a mushroom burger that would stand up to the best burgers in town.  A few in our party had the flatbreads and loved them.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The knock here is the pricing: $14 for a burger and fries? Really?  I'd be a big fan if the pricing was more in line with similar restaurants.   Now that cheesecake - man that's some good stuff!  We had the salted caramel cheesecake which was awesome!  Make sure you save room for dessert.  There's a bakery area where you can buy cheesecakes if that's all you are interested in. Service was good. Our server knew the huge menu and provided good recommendations.  The service from the bar was a tad slower than expected, but is understandable with the huge crowd.  These servers are working hard to see that everyone has a good time. Speaking of having a good time, it's obvious everyone is because it's a lively and loud place.  If you haven't tried Cheesecake Factory you should definitely go.  Be patient with the wait and expect to shell out a few more bucks, but you will enjoy the experience."
Linda J.,"Greensboro, NC",9,24,15,5.0,7/8/2017,"Love this restaurant. I had the Shepherd's Pie...so good. Way too big to eat, so I'm taking it home. Also taking a piece of Carrot Cake and the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake.  Yum!  Will definitely be back"
CiCi A.,"Greensboro, NC",64,10,15,5.0,7/6/2017,"It's a chain restaurant (which I am usually not fond of), but it never disappoints! Chicken Bellagio.... soooo good. Georgia Peach.... yum. Whiskey Smash.... yessss. No complaints. One of my fave places!"
Josh S.,"Eden, NC",53,15,14,1.0,9/4/2017,Came here for lunch specifically to get a cheese cake dessert. Service so poor I couldn't stay long enough enjoy cheesecake. Sad.
Dharshini B.,"Greensboro, NC",9,22,,4.0,6/13/2017,"The food is good. As is with most big Chain restaurants that charge you over 20$ for an entree. Their cheesecakes are wesome and I am a big fan of the macadamia caramel cheesecake.  The biggest thing about this place is that the wait time is horrible. When the restaurant is crowded, you almost forget what you ordered. Lol. OK and then I think the drinks would help me with this misery. But there is virtually no alcohol in it. Then you are forced to buy, because why not!!  In my honest opinion, I think a couple of dishes are worth the wait, but otherwise it is just decent. Well at least you can gobble some cheesecake and take a long walk to your car, because parking is very limited."
Nazmul S.,"Greensboro, NC",86,140,331,4.0,11/12/2016,"Due to the long long long wait for my take out order I wanted to say something bad about the food. However the taste was great, I loved the Sheppard pie, may not be an authentic one but it taste good, really really good. I didn't know they sold savory meals I only thought it was exclusively a cheesecake spot. However I was very impressed with the food here, the cheesecake was oh just magnificent! I would like to wait less than an hour for my food, it was busy but come on an hour is too long when your in the mood for something good"
Jess R.,"Richmond, VA",135,124,66,2.0,2/21/2017,"Food is the same food at the Cheesecake Factory chain.   Portions are ridiculously big- see the calorie count on the menu. You may want to  split entrees! The truffle cheese bread was delish.  Caesar side salad was average.  Jamaican jerk shrimp turned out delicious.  Our biggest issue is with service.   Terrible service.  Our waitress disappeared several times repeatedly, and our entire meal took 2.5 hours because we were waiting on waitress and food so much.   Drinks stayed dry and empty, plates weren't cleared, and servers kept running into one member of my party's chair, effectively moving her away from the table every time.   I probably will not return anytime soon, the service is not worth the food. Not by a long shot."
Rosso T.,"Winston-Salem, NC",1,4,2,1.0,8/5/2017,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  That is until I went here.  I took my family and a friend and was excited for them to go.  The wait was almost 2 hours. Got seated at 8:36 pm and ordered.  Drinks took 30 minutes.  Food took over an hour received at 9:49 pm.One order was wrong - the most simple order - a cheeseburger with fries. Bun burnt and no fries.  After waiting another 25 minutes for fries we asked for them again after seeing several orders of fries go by our table.  Then told ""we are out of fries"".  What a complete letdown and the friend who was supposed to get the fries was a first time customer.  Asked for a manager but they never came.  Got a peice of free Cheesecake though which was so ridiculous.  An overall  horrible experience and  I have not gone back to any Cheesecake Factory since.  What's worse is I contacted them about this and to this day have never received any response back so I decided to post this review. A HUGE letdown!"

When it was time for dessert we just ate whatever John suggested and had the banana cheesecake which was SO good! Thank you for an awesome lunch."
Suzie G.,"Carolina Beach, NC",17,9,,3.0,4/30/2017,"When we arrived we were quoted 45-50 minute wait time. Our pager went off after about an hour. I went to the hostess stand and a woman took our pager. She then answered the phone, spoke to a co-worker and then walked away. Another employee walked up and asked if we had turned in a pager. We replied yes but he had no idea what to do with us. The original employee returned about 5 minutes later and we were seated. My issue is that she never once communicated while we stood their unsure what was going on for well over 10 minutes.  Once seated the whole process took longer than you would expect. The food was good but I've had better at other Cheesecake Factories. My husband ordered a NY strip but was served a Rib-eye. He decided to eat it anyway because we had waited long enough already.  Overall, I'm willing to give it another shot."
Tom B.,"Greensboro, NC",10,4,,2.0,1/19/2017,"The atmosphere is loud and glitzy.  Visually it has a high-dollar, upscale feeling.  Not a good place to have a nice warm and intimate conversation. Also I felt our server was a bit too pushy -- wanting us to buy supper.  Whereas we were there at 4 pm today to enjoy a snack, and nothing more. So we both ordered the Greek salad. At least three fourths of my salad were chunks of cucumber. Yes that's right, not slices, but chunks!  Wrong.  It was not a Greek salad, but rather a cucumber salad. Not likely to return anytime soon."
Michael H.,"Kernersville, NC",3,27,,3.0,1/23/2017,"When we approached we were told the wait would be 75 to 90 minutes and were given a pager.  Since they had a very nice area to sit in an enclosed heated patio we elected to wait it out.  At the 75 minute mark I started to notice other parties, both larger and smaller being seated that came after us so went to the hostess for an ETA.  When she tried to look up my pager number it was not in the system.  They apologized profusely that there was an error, promised to expedite us and gave me a new pager.  We were seated within 20 minutes. As some have said, the noise in the restaurant is very loud.  We found ourselves almost yelling at each other across the table, but the food made up for it.  Service was efficient and friendly.  Drinks came out quickly followed by fresh bread and then our entrees.  We were so full we decided that we just had to have cheesecake but had to get it to take out. Probably won't return now the novelty has worn off.  May just come back for desert to go."
