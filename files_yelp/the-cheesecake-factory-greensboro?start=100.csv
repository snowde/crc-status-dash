Michelle M.,"Greensboro, NC",0,9,,5.0,1/21/2017,Had mid afternoon meal for 2 after a 30 min wait. We were told 50 min so that was a good start. We shared the sweet corn tamale cakes appetizer. Wow bursting with flavor!  Next we shared the spicy cashew chicken entree. Large quantity. Delicious sauce and blend of chicken and cashews. Two kinds of bread brought that were great as well. Attentive servers. Brought our cheesecakes home because we were stuffed!
Dee H.,"Burlington, NC",46,9,16,3.0,1/16/2017,"This place is still very new and very popular. For a table of 8, we had to wait about an hour. Nonetheless we still received great service and the food was delicious!"
Jeanne L.,"Greensboro, NC",20,77,2,2.0,7/6/2017,"I went here for lunch the first week it opened and it was wonderful in every way. Not so this time. We got to the restaurant around 11:00 and it was not at all crowded. The hostess led us to a half booth. Why do they always try to sit you at a bad table when there are good ones available?  We opted for a full booth. It was a good thing we were comfortably seated because we sat for a full 15 minutes before getting our drinks. Slow restaurant-three managers-15 minutes. The food was fine and the servers who ran the food were good. They were friendly and took notice of what we needed without being asked. We were there for 1 1/4 hours. We decided to order cheesecake to go from the counter, just to avoid another long wait. I return to restaurants that provide a pleasant experience. Won't go back here. And for heavens sakes, when there are three manager looking men working someone should be watching ticket times and touching tables!"
Kayla M.,"Trinity, NC",25,1,,1.0,4/26/2017,"Worst service, worst food, and worst management I have ever seen.. complete disappointment to be honest."
Sasha B.,"Greensboro, NC",0,11,,4.0,2/28/2017,"Having tried Cheesecake Factory in different cities, I couldn't wait for it to open in Greensboro. I've been there several times with friends and actually didn't wait too long to get a table. I think it's that I never went with a big group of people. The food's good, but not great, as it is with a lot of these chain restaurants. The portions are huge. I tried different flavors of their cheesecake, and the passion fruit one is amazing!"
Colby M.,"Kernersville, NC",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2016,"Complete rip off.  Great staff!  We ordered a seared salmon salad that was $18, it had a piece of salmon the size of a fish stick,  1 or 2 tiny pieces of avocado,  and very little of everything except Kale.... Plenty of that.  The Poblano and Carnitas brunch special was the same,  $15 for eggs and about 7 tortilla chips.  I would say  completely avoid this place until they get it together."
Wes H.,"Gibsonville, NC",86,19,20,5.0,10/18/2016,So far so good!!! 30 min wait to a table on opening day is not bad!!! And the service is great!!!
Brittany G.,"Falls Church, VA",0,3,,1.0,11/7/2016,Upon arrival to the restaurant there was no wait for a table. However we were told we had to wait 15-20 minutes before being seated. Other parties entered and were seated before us. Spoke to the manager about the situation she did absolutely nothing. The waitress did not come and take our drink order until after 10 mins of being seated. Once she took our drink orders she did not return until another 15 minutes to take our food order.  The customer service was horrible and unacceptable for Cheesecake Factory. Do not plan out on returning to this restaurant. Nor would I recommend others to eat at this establishment.
Ginger H.,"Danville, VA",27,3,,2.0,11/8/2016,"We went anticipating a wonderful meal such as we've had at other Cheesecake Factory locations.  They still have lots of kinks to work out. Of the 4 meals ordered none were as expected. Shrimp were tough and over cooked on 1 entree. Pasta was dry on another, all entrees were delivered at room temp. Not hot. 4th entree was delivered 10 minutes after the others and the fries were not with it. Fries brought 5 minutes later. Server never offered drink refills and at the end never offered dessert! Never had a manager even stop by our table. We had to go to counter at the front to order our cheesecakes to go! We ordered 5 pieces and server lost out on that up sell! Our family has always loved the Cheesecake Factory and will give this location another shot but hope that there is serious improvement."
Judy R.,"Atlantic Beach, NC",0,7,,2.0,7/17/2017,"I have been very dissapointed both times I have eaten at this restaurant. Service is great but the food is overpriced and not very palatible. We have been disappointed in simple fettucine alfredo. Cheesecake, however, is great but overpriced."
Rebecca S.,"Greensboro, NC",20,7,2,2.0,10/30/2016,Although the food was mediocre I have been to a Cheesecake Factory in another town and their service and food was beyond. Coming here expecting the same was severely disappointed.the service was terrible and I will probably never come here again. Definitely a disappointment.
Kelley R.,"Greensboro, NC",0,6,,1.0,10/28/2016,"I had an interesting experience when I called this evening to get information about wait times to be seated. After a lot of ringing, someone answered and said they had to transfer me to the hostess desk and after holding for almost 5 minutes a girl finally picked up and she was very unpleasant, seemed almost annoyed that she had to answer the phone. She gave me the wait time and when I started to ask another question she hung up on me, didn't say goodbye or anything. I get that they're busy because they just opened but it is possible to be efficient when working and still be polite. The hostess I spoke with should have at least said ""have a good day"" or something so I'd have know she was trying to abruptly end the conversation. Not the best first impression from Greensboro's Cheesecake Factory.  I hope this one experience with the FOH isn't a reflection of this Cheesecake Factory location as a whole. I might still come at some point to at least get the full experience. But the experience I had talking to the hostess wasn't exactly what you'd call good customer serc. Perhaps this Cheesecake Factory should reconsider the people they have up front. Someone else left a review describing a similar experience when speaking to a hostess.  Update: So, was someone supposed to contact me or something? I completed the online review form as I was told to do in the response from ""Guest Services of The Cheesecake Factory"" because you wanted to ""speak to me directly"". I have received no response from anyone to speak directly to. So........yeah."
Valerie J.,"High Point, NC",7,17,,1.0,10/23/2016,"Dirty plates and forks, potatoes over cooked or maybe left over from last night... and we were first of the morning buisness. Talked to management, nothing done... won't go back!!!"
Cookie T.,"Winston-Salem, NC",6,3,1,1.0,12/30/2016,"Cheesecake Factory in Greensboro. The service was awful. The waitress was rude and had an attitude. We waited close to an hour and a half. Hoping the food was worth the wait; however, the food was disgusting, oily, salty, and to top it off I found a hair in the food. The first time going there and last time. When going to a so call classy restaurant you expect to receive good service; which there was none, you expect to receive excellent food, and there was none. If you want to get sick this would be a great place to eat, which I was sick by the time I got to my house. I could not give this place even 1 star. What a shame had to click on star to post."
Mary M.,"High Point, NC",55,7,,1.0,4/7/2017,"I'm just glad Harper's was next door to pick up what CF dropped. After learning a week ago that CF refused reservations or even, advanced seating on a Friday night, my 16-yr-old was still insistent that she have her birthday dinner for 9 at CF. I was ok with her learning this lesson the hard way. When we arrived at 6:30, the hostess advised us that the manager would need to quote a group so large (seriously? 9 is large?). Anyway, the manager quoted us 3-4 hours and refused me a pager until I checked back in at 7:30, to be sure we still wanted to stay. The kids arrived and were distraught at having to wait so long, but couldn't decide on another restaurant, so husband took the wheel and called next door to Harper's, who could accommodate us easily. At 7:15, I told the hostess that we would be leaving to go to an establishment that could accommodate us. She said, ""Are you sure? We just got a cancellation and were cleaning off a table for you!"" Strange...but we decided to stay and canceled next door. We waited patiently for another 1/2 hour, during which time, that same hostess asked if we were another party and I replied, ""No."" She looked up from time to time, but would look down quickly when I caught her eye. Finally, at 7:45, I approached her again and asked if the promised table was almost ready. She asked my name and looked at the computer and proceeded to tell me that we had come in at 6:30, they'd quoted us 3-4 hours, hadn't given us a pager and it was now an hour later, so we still had 2-3 hours to wait! I reminded HER of the whole cancellation thing and she said there'd been a ""miscommunication"" and that that message was actually for another party of 9 and that we still had to wait. She said she didn't recognize faces and hadn't realized that she'd told the wrong people. All 9 of us were very disappointed with the roller coaster ride of trying to get dinner and we have all sworn off ever trying to eat there again. I can't imagine there'll be much problem getting a table a year from now with the way this location is being ""managed."""
Ebony M.,"Browns Summit, NC",136,32,35,4.0,11/1/2016,"Let me disclaim by saying I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! OK, now that's out the way, here is my honest review of the new Cheesecake Factory in Greensboro. I have dined three times since opening (one being the training night which was superb). This review is based upon my experience last night with my teenage daughter in tow. We arrived on a very busy night (end of GHOE festivities) so we were not offended by the 60 minute anticipated wait time. We found a seat outside and chatted with another patron who had never dined there. Much to our surprise, we were buzzed back within 30 minutes. Score! We were immediately seated outside and the views underneath the awning are great. Very serene and romantic, if you are looking for that type of atmosphere. Our server did take a while to greet us. Matter of fact, he greeted the table that was seated well after us first. At any rate, he redeemed himself by apologizing for his delay and immediately serving us bread. My daughter opted for the Chicken Bellagio and she LOVED it. She was super happy with her choice. I tasted a bite of it and the noodles were seasoned to perfection. My entree was the Kobe Beef Burger and fry. YUMMY! The Burger was moist, full of flavor and topped with plenty mushrooms. Even the fries were tasty and crisp. The only issue we had was we were repeatedly brought the food of the table to our left. At one point, the food was even placed in front of us. When their cheesecake came and the young lady tried to hand it to me, I just politely shared it was for the table next to me. Other than that, we had a great experience. We left very full and very satisfied. Oh, how could I forget, my daughter begged me to get the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake for us to split. We ordered it to go but it was served on a plate. No biggie...We split it down the middle and enjoyed the rich goodness of this cheesecake.  I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I did enjoy this one. I do prefer all chocolate and will get that kind in the future if I decide to splurge."
Demetrius A.,"Greensboro, NC",86,4,,1.0,6/17/2017,I have Been to Cheese Cake Factory all over the US and  I will drive 45 minutes to go to Another Cheese Cake Factory Worst Customer Service I have ever had in my life Then at the end of this to top it all off Lady spilled food on my son WTF
Abby W.,"Greensboro, NC",104,10,,1.0,3/8/2017,"Waited 2 and a half hours to sit down 4 of us. They forgot to make my friends entree while our food came out a hour and a half after we ordered. finally his meal came out and we began eating. I don't think they know what salt is because the food was VERY bland. No seasoning just tasted like mush. Very overpriced. It was a nightmare to say the least. I've given other cheesecake factories a chance (South Park Cheesecake Factory in charlotte) that one was terrible as well. Thought I'd give this one a try to see if maybe it was just that one restaurant that wasn't good, no it's the entire chain of them. I do not recommend, but if you are dying to try it, be prepared to be there several hours. we watched 2 groups of couples come, eat, and go as we were waiting for our food to even get to our table. Only thing good was the cheesecake and we call and order that an hour in advance and then drive and go pick it up. That's the only way to have a decent experience with this place"
David M.,"Greensboro, NC",2,41,,4.0,10/28/2016,"Went there last week.  Typical experience as with all the other factories we've been to in various states....crowded, great food, big portions and extra time at the gym!  Took forever but glad they came to GSO finally.  Building is nicely done inside though they did have limited space, so waiting area and aisles are skimpy on space.  Parking is stretched too.  Until the newness wears off a bit, be prepared for a wait.  And some great food choices, including amazing cheesecake of course!"
Becky B.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,1,,1.0,6/6/2017,Giving reviews on products I buy and foods I eat is very important to others. My experience eating Cheesecake Factory in Greensboro was terrible! It left a bad impression with my family.  My daughter and I have ate Cheesecake factory before in Charlotte. Great experience! My daughter was looking forward to eating her birthday at Cheesecake factory in Greensboro since it was much closer. It was a 2 hour wait for a party of 9. We were all starved by the time we were seated. Waitress who waited us was friendly. But only brought us one small thing of bread for 9 of us. We order appetizer. Which we only got half of the appetizers. Our glasses were empty for a good while before she came back to refill them. Never offer to bring more bread.  We didn't see our waitress for awhile. Waitress finally came to our table in inform us one of the steaks was taking awhile and that was the hold up. Really does it take a hour to cook steaks! By the time we all gotten our food everything was COLD! Even the Steak was almost rare which it was suppose to be medium to well done. Only one person out of 9 liked their food! Food tasted horrible! Someone of us sent our food back. That's when the manager came over and apologized. Second time around our order was wrong even parts of the steak wasn't done!  I ordered a cheese burger there was no cheese! Manager took it back came back with cheese on it. I could tell the hamburger was put in the microwave to melt the cheese! They never came around to sing Happy Birthday to my daughter as requested! Even though everyone else around us they were singing happy birthday! We all did ordered Cheesecakes to go.  Highly recommend if you never been to Cheesecake Factory go to the one in Charlotte! Seems this place lack a lot in Management!
