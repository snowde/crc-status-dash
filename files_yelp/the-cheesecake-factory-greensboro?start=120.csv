Alexandra G.,"High Point, NC",0,14,,4.0,11/2/2016,"I've dined at the Cheesecake Factory in 7 different states and was elated to learn it was finally coming to Greensboro. My husband and I decided to wait a couple of weeks after opening to allow the staff to work out growing pains.  We arrived today, on a very busy night, and had an approximately 40 minutes wait. The whole experience, start to finish, was as delightful as in any CF anywhere else.  The host was smiley, cheerful, and very polite. Our waitress provided for a prompt and courteous service. I would like to commend the whole of the staff for doing a great job making guests happy. Being such a busy restaurant, these young people have to work very hard, and they most certainly do.  We ordered cocktails, the avocado rolls (of course!), the giant Cobb salad, one of the pastas, and several cheesecakes. All food and drink was of superb quality and arrived promptly.  My only gripe would be about CF company policy in general and not Greensboro location in particular - rather than charging too much money for the gigantic portions (most every guest ends up getting a doggy bag), I'd be happy to see portions reduced to healthy, normal size, and prices appropriately lowered. Dear CF managers, have you ever truly looked at the size of your Cobb salad, for example? What human can possibly consume that much food? Your present portion size policy encourages overeating, and being in a country known as the most obese country in the world, this shows lack of care for consumer's health. I understand the corporate desire to sell more and get more income flow, however there are other, more appropriate ways to achieve growth. Attitudes are changing, if you don't keep up with the times, in the near future you'll see your company name blacklisted by the health conscious consumer. Getting a plate of food considerably larger than one's head is borderline offensive. We are not pigs. Take it home for lunch the next day, I hear you say? Well, if soggy salad or cold pasta you'll have to stick into microwave is your deal, you might. Personally, I pay for fresh food, and having to consume half of it the next day really takes away from the value. As for our family, we will continue visiting your wonderful restaurant, but only about once a year, for special occasions, giving the bulk of our weekly business to other establishments that care a bit more about health of their patrons."
Elizabeth H.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,,5.0,10/28/2016,"Went there for lunch today. Even though we got there when it opened and it was packed, we got seated right away. We had appetizers for lunch - the Loaded Baked Potato Tots, Chicken Samosa and Caesar Salad. All were delicious and delivered quickly.  Looking forward to going again and next time getting some cheesecake."
John D.,"Greensboro, NC",2,210,12,1.0,12/9/2016,"We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Thursday, and we were seated immediately (party of three).  They put us in the bar area.  Our server seemed friendly enough.  The music was kind of loud.  We ordered our drinks.  The table next to us was given a bar menu, in addition to the regular menu.  We overheard their server telling them about happy hour specials that run until 6 pm.  When our server came to take our food order, I asked her about happy hour and she said it goes until 5 pm, so we ordered off the main menu.  While waiting for our food to arrive, we grabbed a bar food menu (from the unfriendly bartender) and saw that the specials are available from 4-6 pm.  Our server came back and told me that they didn't have the sandwich that I had ordered, and asked me if I would accept chicken salad instead of turkey.  I showed her the bar food menu and asked her about the timing.  She said that it was good and asked me if I wanted to order anything off the bar menu.  Perturbed, I answered ""no"" and just opted to take the chicken salad, figuring it would be faster.  After 45 minutes, our food still hadn't come, so we left.  I told the manager.  He looked ashamed, apologetic, and at a loss for words.  We will not be going back."
Jessica H.,"Greensboro, NC",132,1,,1.0,10/26/2016,"Went in around 4 pm and was immediately seated. The wait however in between the hostess seating our party and even having a server acknowledge us was at least ten minutes. In addition to this, our waitress walked by at least three times and looked at our table before she said she would be right back, she didn't even offer to get our drink orders or offer us water. Then a second waiter come up and said he would be taking care of us. No explanation was given as to what happened to our original server. Instead of apologizing he rudely said that he would just take our order. I'm sorry but both me and the girlfriend I was with wait tables and know that all that was needed to clear up the situation was a ""I'll be right with you"" and a simple apology. Neither was offered and management did nothing to help. Needless to say we walked out and went to another restaurant in the Friendly Center. I understand being busy, but all that was needed was a simple acknowledgement that wasn't given. Also, management please pay more attention to when you see guests leaving before placing an order. We are not likely to return."
Alaria M.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,,2.0,12/24/2016,"The food was amazing but the service was terrible. Besides it being a new restaurant I assumed there would be a wait time to be seated but not a wait time for my food. I waited over 40 min for my food to be brought to our table and watched other tables be seated, receive their food and leave all in the time i waiting for the waitress to being our food. If i decided to go back it will be a to-go order."
Christopher W.,"Greensboro, NC",0,2,,4.0,1/19/2017,Delicious food and classy/comfortable atmosphere.  The menu is large and they consistently provide a very good dining experience.
LaQuista W.,"Trenton, NJ",131,7,1,1.0,11/4/2016,"I just attended a luncheon for a military co-worker at this Cheesecake Factory. It is a beautiful location but that's about the only thing nice I have to say. It took about an hour for our order to be taken. I ordered my usual Lemon Herb Chicken. Waited forever for it to come out and I was starving. The chicken looked like it was freeze dried. It was dry, black, and the meat was hard. I immediately brought it to my waiter's attention. They offered to make it over or I could order something else. Well, I asked for them to remake the dish. Everyone else is finished eating, still no food for me. Well I finally asked could it be packaged to go. Waited another 15-20 mins before it was brought out. The waitress that was helping with the table finally starts bringing out receipts. Imagine my surprise that I have to pay full price. While it's not about the $19.75, I felt I should have at least been offered a discount.  I wasn't even offered any fries or anything to eat on while my new order was being remade. I asked to speak to the manager on duty. After waiting over 10 mins, I get up and go to the hostess. I ask for the manager again. She finally comes up to me and I explain the situation. How she never offered to make it right, never came to the table to see what the issue was. She had a really bad attitude. I told her that her customer service was horrible and they can keep the food because I refuse to pay for it. I left the food and I left. I'm hungry but I would rather go to a fast food place. Don't waste your time here unless you have ALL day to wait. Hopefully they find a manager with a better attitude."
Thomas H.,"Greensboro, NC",0,21,,2.0,11/12/2016,"Large and somewhat noisy.  Food was good but they serve large portions at high prices. Service ok but slow. Cheesecake comes in a lot of flavors but is typical restaurant fare, also not large portions which you would expect. Will not return."
Martin F.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,,1.0,11/29/2016,"We were thrilled when a new Cheesecake Factory opened right around the corner from us. We eat out 3-4 times a week, usually after 9 PM, so it was great to have a new restaurant with a large diversified menu expand our dining choices. Boy were we wrong. The wine was fine as were our salads, one of which was my wife's entree. For my main course I ordered the jambalaya over linguine. It looked great when it arrived, but in the interest of eating I had to put a fork in it. The entire mass of linguine lifted off the plate. It was so overcooked that the pasta had solidified into one large gloppy mass. The restaurant had provided a soup spoon for twirling the linguine; they should have given me a steak knife to cut the goo into bite-sized chunks. So I sent it back to the kitchen. Iteration 2.0 was marginally better. The linguine was still overcooked but edible and twirlable (I should mention it was 10:30 by now, and I was hungry enough to eat almost anything.). But then I noticed something else. The jambalaya, which the menu described as a Cajun dish contains shrimp and chicken, had no shrimp at all. I guess they ran out and, rather than taking it off the menu, the management figured their customers were too stupid to notice and served it anyhow. After a perfunctory  and unsatisfactory meeting with the manager, the cost of the ""jambalaya"" was deducted from the bill. But this was easily the worst restaurant experience I have had in twenty years, and The Cheesecake Factory missed an opportunity to create a relationship with a once-a-week,regular, high-end, wine-drinking customer. Yecch. And from the point of value, the price was way too high for ""industrial"" food. For a late night meal, Lucky 32, Print Works, Positano's, Green Valley Grill, Village Tavern, and even McDonald's offer better food and better value."
Jackie C.,"High Point, NC",19,1,,5.0,1/7/2017,"We had dinner here on New Years Eve night, had an hour wait, which I expected, but when we got seated, service was fast and the food was delicious.  Had Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon and of course cheesecake."
Angela M.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,,2.0,1/4/2017,"This was my third visit to The Cheesecake Factory, and it was also fraught with problems. My first visit was on opening day, and after ordering and waiting well over an hour, I left without haven eaten, due to having another appointment for which I was going to be late. On my second visit there was a mix up with the food, but due to the excellent waitress we had, it was promptly straightened out. I wasn't quite so fortunate on today's visit, and I'm beginning to feel there's unseen powers having a good laugh at my third attempt to actually, receive the ordered food.  I'm a huge lover of the spicy Mexican, Huevos Ranchos dish, and when I saw they had it on their menu, I ordered it.  It was actually, my reading the description of it that helped seal the deal for me; sunny side up eggs, Ranchero sauce, corn tortillas, avocados.  Yum. The dish that was served to me fifteen minutes later in no way resembled the dish I ordered; it was a beautifully designed plate of fluffy scrambled eggs on two corn tortillas, with some salsa and a couple of slices of avocado on top.  No sauce, no sunny side up eggs.  I told the waitress that it wasn't Huevos Ranchero, and she informed me that was how they made their's. It was only when I insisted to her that the description on the menu didn't match the dish she served me, did she go and check and found out she had made an error inputting the order.  She did offer to have them make me the correct dish, but by this time my lunch companion had eaten half of her food, so I ended up eating the rather boring, although deliciously well made, scrambled egg dish.  Any other well maintained restaurant would have picked up the tab, but not them.  Not sure I'm going for a fourth try, even for the yummy food."
David E.,"Danville, VA",0,1,,5.0,7/15/2017,"I just wanted to take time to give recognition where it is deserved.  Friday 7/14/2017 was our third visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  We drive down from Danville, VA once a month to go to dinner in Greensboro.  Our other two visits were good but we had a GREAT experience tonight.  From entering the restaurant to the quick greeting from the hostess and the nice person that set us in about a 15 minute time frame.  Our server Ronnie made us feel very welcomed and he was very sincere and a nice person.  He helped us with menu suggestions and took the time to have conversation with us during his visit to our table.  It was my wife's birthday and even though we at first didn't order cheesecake the staff came over and sang for her.  SHE LOVED IT!!!!!!!!  After such a great performance we ended up getting desert.   Ronnie seemed like he was very comfortable in doing his job and seemed to be be handling a lot of things at one time.  He also was very professional when another customer approached him while at our table and inquired about their food.  The gentleman was very rude and inconsiderate but Ronnie handled it with ease.  We will definitely make the Cheesecake Factory in Greensboro a monthly stop.  Thank everyone for our dining experience and making us feel welcomed."
Gary W.,"Troutville, VA",0,4,1,1.0,12/16/2016,Food was cold never got bread although it was promised in 10 minutes then 20 minutes 30 minutes we said forget it. It took over 1 hr to get food. Waitress was terrible never refilled our drinks had to go to the bar. Spoke with the manager she didn't give a crap!!!wont be back there. What a shame!!!
Ann B.,"High Point, NC",0,1,,1.0,5/30/2017,"I read back through the reviews and see that ever since the opening all that is replied to each complaint is this or similar to this "" we are sorry about the mistakes during your visit and will look into it""   how about FIXING the situation, get a cook like the other cheese cake factories have, one that knows what they are doing and managers that watch to make sure its being corrected and when something ( chicken blasters)  are  ordered instead of being too lazy to make them or wanting to keep them till later in the evening, so you don't run out  you can ACCOMMODATE the customer!!   I am in search now of other sites to put reviews on like I said after 8 months it's time to step and do what you are suppose to do!!  Several times the reviews have said they should have kept their money and went to mcdonalds etc.....it's not just me this cheesecake factory is not being operated correctly!!!!!!!! It's ruining what should be a great place to dine!"
Ryan O.,"Browns Summit, NC",0,3,,5.0,10/20/2016,"The wait was short considering it was grand opening night. Service was amazing. The Chicken Bellagio may be my new favorite chicken dish. The decor was amazing, they put a lot of thought into the ceiling design. It was really nice to look around at it all while waiting for our food. The cheesecake is also absolutely amazing. The bathroom was also very nice and clean. I would definitely check this place out if you haven't already!"
Holly B.,"Greensboro, NC",0,4,,2.0,3/10/2017,"I have visited this location several times. The restaurant is decorated well and has a nice atmosphere. I've tried several dishes - the nachos and Louisiana chicken pasta have been my favorites. Huge portions and pretty pricey. The cheesecake flavors I have tried have all been delicious! I did not have a very pleasant experience last night - our waitress was very rude. I had dinner with two people I haven't talked to in months. I felt our waitress was trying to rush us - excuse me but when I'm paying $10 for a mixed drink and $17.99 for pasta I would like to visit with my friends some. Our waitress came by after we had filled out the check and cleared the table - that was ok. Then she stopped by a few minutes later and said that she needed to bring us pillows and blankets since it seemed we would be staying there all night. Not even 5 minutes later she came back and said we needed to leave because she needed to make more money tonight. I was appalled by her behavior - no I did not say anything to management because 1. Never saw a manager 2. According to these reviews they manage problems very poorly. There are plenty surrounding restaurants, I plan to take my business elsewhere for a while, somewhere I can be appreciated"
