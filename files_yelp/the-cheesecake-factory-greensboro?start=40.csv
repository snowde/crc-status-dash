San W.,"Anaheim, CA",1,1,,5.0,1/14/2017,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory!!!   So, so happy a location opened in Greensboro. I have been a few times, since they have opened and have never been disappointed. I am not one to write a lot of reviews, but after seeing how few stars this location has- I felt I needed to let you Yelpers know to go! If possible, to avoid the crowds- be there when they open at 11:30am.  They have a large selection on their lunch menu and the Tropical Ice Tea is amazing!  Great salads too (I somehow feel like I deserve Cheesecake after eating a salad)"
Dawn W.,"Greensboro, NC",99,78,78,5.0,3/18/2017,As always I love the Cheesecake Factory. Sit at the bar for the best service and drinks.
Laura A.,"High Point, NC",0,1,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Sad to say but I hate to even give one star.  Terrible customer service.  Unorganized chaos. Party of four tried to have dinner .. over an hour wait time.   Went elsewhere but stopped back by on the way home to buy cheesecake.  Spent 45 minutes standing in line just to order cheesecake with only 4 others in line in front of me.  Appears understaffed and not prepared for busy evenings, despite employees stating every Saturday night was like that.  Will not return anytime soon ... not even to purchase cheesecake."
Kimberly P.,"Burlington, NC",8,25,3,4.0,11/3/2016,"We're very excited to have a Cheesecake Factory in Greensboro.   The wait was a little longer than expected.  They only allowed a handful of people inside each time (7 minute wait per group).  Once we were inside, service was excellent, along with the food.  Out waiter (Terek) was awesome!  He knew the menu very well!   We will definitely be back!"
Deidra C.,"Greensboro, NC",0,16,2,2.0,11/21/2016,"I had a larger group (~12) planning to come here for a special occasion.  I understand that large groups are difficult, so I called two days ahead of time to see what my options were.  I offered that we could be split between two tables of 6 or even three tables of 4, whatever was easiest for them. The person on the phone said we needed to come in four hours prior to the time we wanted to be seated.  An actual person needed to come in and speak with the manager.  We expected to eat around 7, so we came in around 3:30 to let them know.  We gave them a phone number and they told us they only block off seating for three hour chunks.  They said they would call us between 5 and 6 to let us know when we would be seated.  No problem. They actually called at 4:20 and expected us to be seated by 4:45 since the party that was at our reserved table is leaving sooner than expected.  Four of us were able to be available by 4:45, so we went there.  Then, they wouldn't seat us because the entire party wasn't there at 4:45 (well, of course not, that's why we said around 7).  I offered to take the table for the four of us if they put the other 8 folks on the list for a table around 7.  They said no.  So we went elsewhere. The total we spent at the alternate venue was $458 and this was only 9 of the 12 people that were originally planning on going to the Cheesecake Factory.  So, they basically missed out on ~$600 of sales because of their terrible seating policies, as well as any future business from us, because I don't want to deal with this again."
Brendie W.,"Summerfield, NC",208,270,46,1.0,11/27/2016,"Walking in the door, they said the wait was 20 mins - after 1 hour of waiting we finally got our table. It took 10 min to get a glass of water. 30 mins to get our dinner. The dinner was average. I would not have paid that much for something that was as good as IHOP. I would not recommend going to the restaurant. They need to get OpenTable!!!!"
Christina H.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,,3.0,11/16/2016,"We tried to go here the Saturday before last, around 5:30 p.m., but were told the wait was about three hours, so we decided not to take part in that crazy. So we tried again the following Monday evening around 6:00 p.m., and waited more like 45 minutes for a table. Our server was very friendly, but not the most efficient. It took an overly long time to get our drinks and, at the end, our check -- the two duties of which she was most in charge, as other runners brought our food. Our meals were really very tasty, and portions are monstrous, so be prepared to be stuffed or to take leftovers home. I would actually rate the food above the cheesecake. I had the Cobb salad, which was really yummy, and my husband had a chicken dish that came with the most delicious mashed potatoes. Our daughters chose gluten-free alfredo pasta and chicken sliders, which they thought were okay. My main complaint would be the decided location of this popular chain restaurant. Parking is now going to be even more of atrocious in that section of Friendly Center, and I feel pretty bad for the other businesses around there. The restaurant is smaller than other Cheesecake Factories I've been to, so I would expect wait times to always be pretty long as well, at least during more peak times. It seems like a decent addition to Greensboro, but does not seem very well planned and thought out."
Manuel B.,"Greensboro, NC",0,1,,1.0,4/12/2017,"My family and I decided to have dinner at The Cheese Cake Factory last night, I wish we had gone to McDonald's instead. I have never been treated so poorly and the food was terrible, inedible!  We arrived and luckily didn't have to wait, we sat down and waited 10 minutes on our waitress, she was polite and seemed nice, we ordered our drinks and place our order. We waited an hour for our meals and if you're a parent you know a 3 year old boy will not display his best behavior when hungry. Not only our food was ridiculously late but it was ice cold, 10 minutes later our waitress came to check on us and 3 of us cancelled our orders and sent the food back, the manager on shift arrived at our table once the waitress cancelled our meals, she offered to reheat our meals but who wants to pay $25 for reheated food?   I asked for the bill, the waitress sent a different waiter with the bill and again waited another 15 minutes for her to take my card, it was a terrible experience that I don't wish upon anyone else. Needless to say we will not visit them again."
Alley D.,"Greensboro, NC",59,41,,3.0,8/5/2017,"Started out good.  Hostess told us it would be 15 minutes before we would be seated and it was only like 5.  Service was slow.  Food was ok, a little pricey for the quality. Serving sizes were very big.  Probably will not go back.  Got cheesecake to go. Will let you know."
Eliana A.,"Greensboro, NC",2,5,3,5.0,3/30/2017,"It is my favorite place, I feel at home, whenever the waiter suggests something to me is my taste, they are very clean, elegant and I think the attention they give me is impeccable, we were on Saturday with some friends and it was super cool, me I felt like somewhere outside of NC, this is definitely is my favorite place ... Oh I forgot to say that the cheescake are unique ... very good job guys!!"
Chris R.,"Greensboro, NC",1,20,38,2.0,11/4/2016,"The short version:  Arrived at 5:25pm and got in line, 5:36pm given pager( told 50min wait), 6:50pm called to be seated outside ,700pm order, 705pm bread, 720pm bread ,food arrived 750pm, asked to remake wife's meal @757pm To-go box of wife's food brought to table @8:17pm . At car at 8:25pm Price $81 (after 20%tip  ) nothing comped AND no follow up from manager.  Basically 3 hours of misery. There are so many other gems in greensboro to go eat. Do not come here unless you are very patient, have eaten a meal in the last few hours, or don't mind overpaying for semi-good food. Longer version: We have been to other cheesecake factories in different states and the experience was drastically better. ~80 minutes actual wait instead of 50 min. ""Patio okay "" means ""patio only "" as other groups of 4 who came way after us had their pager go off first and sat inside. It was busy and we had to make our way through the herd of people asking us when we got there and how long we were waiting. The friendly hostess took my pager and shortly after we were seated outside. The server greeted us and we got our drinks. My raspberry lemonade I planned to share with my daughter was not available when they brought the other drinks. I ordered strawberry instead and it came about 10 minutes after being served a water. Bread was delivered but no plates or silverware with it. A nice bus boy stopped to give us plates and silverware after we asked. Good luck trying to get anyone's attention in white. They all seem to be overwhelmed. Our food was ordered and waiter gave my wife the suggestion to order ""spicy cashew chicken"". After seeing other tables getting food who sat after us, we were offered more bread. Now I understand a table of two can get their food ""faster"" but a kid's grilled cheese doesn't take that much longer added to two regular adult plates.  We got our food almost an hour after ordering, and to top it off, my wife's rice was soaked in sauce to the point I wouldn't even eat it or trade. She also said the fried chicken pieces were soggy because the thick black (soy ?) sauce was extreme. We sent it back and I was hesitant to have them remake it considering we waited an hour for our food. So they ""cancelled"" the original one and entered the meal again on our ticket. I was brought the bill before my wife's food even came out. This time her food took 20 minutes and I assume since I had my meal boxed already and my kid's grilled cheese boxed and our pre-ordered cheesecake boxed, the waiter decided to get them to deliver her food in a box/bag. My wife never ate her meal and we left having had to pay for it even after asking the waiter why there were two orders on the bill and one of them being the remake ( remake +$17/-$17). I guess their policy prohibits them actually comping the meal like normal restaurants when food is made improperly or wait times exceed 1 hour and 20 minutes. My crusted chicken Romano was fairly good but it's not enough for me to want to go back anytime soon. So buyer beware. You have been warned. Keep your expectation low and keep your wallet upside down and open."
Shawn W.,"Danville, VA",0,17,11,4.0,2/4/2017,The wait wasn't as long as I thought it would be they told us a hour which seemed to fly by the serves was amazing. They made our night memorable. We went to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. The food was good. The drinks were too! I wish they had bigger heaters for the outside wait because it was a bit cold but overall we enjoyed our visit.
Kara M.,"Greensboro, NC",16,4,,1.0,8/13/2017,"The worst experience I've ever had at any Cheesecake Factory & I've been to ones in GA, VA, FL, and before the one in Greensboro opened, the Durham one was my go to spot. The service was awful & the food very bland & cold! It was a Saturday evening & as expected, busy, but come on-this is THE Cheesecake Factory, they're used to this, so I thought. My meal was missing one of the sides, the rice was dry and cold, and the beans were bland and cold.  I was never given a refill of my beverage & although we asked for bread & were told it was being made & would be brought out shortly-never received it. It also took forever to get our to go dessert-because, ""the bakery was backed up"".  I may call in an order of Cheesecake to go at this location, but I doubt that I'll be returning to dine in. I'd rather take the hour long drive to the Durham location. Do better Greensboro!!!!"
Leigh T.,"Charlotte, NC",80,2,,1.0,3/7/2017,"They have curbside pick up but don't even answer their phone 90% of the time and when they do you are on hold for 7-10 minutes (no exaggeration). Then when you get there and call curbside, they do the same thing of not answering on the phone (once I had to call 3 times and was then put on hold the third time for 20 minutes while sick in my car!). Clearly they need to staff better because good food doesn't do anything for you when you have terrible customer service. Both times I have gotten to-go curbside pick up there have been people waiting just as long or longer than me. The only good service I got there was when I sat directly at the bar."
Melissa H.,"Oak Ridge, NC",37,3,,1.0,8/8/2017,Waiter had very very poor service and this is the second time the food was mediocre to say the best . This restaurant is too expensive for this type of service . We don't be back .
Heather T.,"Greensboro, NC",69,59,63,4.0,11/12/2016,Food and ambiance is amazing. I went to the mock dinner prior to official opening and it was a little chaotic as to be expected but we will definitely be returning.
Doha M.,"Greensboro, NC",1,25,1,1.0,5/1/2017,"Overpriced. Long wait. Mediocre food. If you want good cheesecake, buy local Cheesecakes by Alex."
Testdummy L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3,19,3,1.0,7/29/2017,"This place was horrible. The wait for just my uncle's drink was 45 minutes, so imagine how long the food took. Also my friend never got his fries because they forgot our fries and gave them to other people, when they remembered us they were out of fries. Also on the burger we ordered the bun was burnt, now how you burn a bun I don't know. Overall it was horrible."
Susan L.,"Summerfield, NC",0,7,,3.0,2/8/2017,"I wish I could rate the food, service and wait time to be seated separately but since I cannot, 3 stars is the best I can offer. The last time I went to the Cheesecake Factory was on my birthday (01-28-2017).  I really wanted to eat here so my husband, my sister and I waited 2 hours to get in.  We were seated and our waiter (do not know his name as he never introduced himself) brought our beverages and promised us hot bread soon.  We received our bread approximately 20 minutes later and only after we pointed out to our nameless waiter that other tables seated after us had bread. It was mentioned to our waiter that it was my birthday and he did wish me a happy one and that is all I got for my birthday at the Cheesecake Factory.  Before we got our food, there was the ever popular shift change.  We were introduced to our new waiter but I do not recall his name at this time.  Our food arrived about 45 minutes after we were seated.  The food was good and our new waiter was attentive.   I normally do not allow anyone to let restaurants know when it is my birthday.  But I did this time and it was the first time.  After all, turning 60 is a big deal.  As stated before, our first waiter wished me a Happy Birthday.  I felt there should have been more but that is all I received.  I could have made a fuss but felt it beneath me so I kept quiet.  I watched the young woman at the table beside us receive a dessert and a chorus of Happy Birthday from the wait staff.  May this is reserved for younger patrons.   Any who, I do plan to come back because I do like the food and have had very good service before this.  I hope you can find a way to reduce the time one must wait to be seated."
Sun A.,"High Point, NC",39,42,431,4.0,11/28/2016,"Always a favorite pick. New to town still busy. Food was decent and drinks were good. I always recommend the chain, servers we're nice. The wait was long but not surprised."
