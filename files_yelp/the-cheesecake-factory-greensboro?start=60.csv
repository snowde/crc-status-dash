Omri B.,"Winston-Salem, NC",150,4,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Worst experience ever!  Been there at Saturday evening  All the floor was oily  We waited more then an hour for 6 people table  30 minutes for drinks  40 minutes for appetizers  After 90 minutes some of us got the food , it was cold, not what we asked and tasted horrible. Absolutely disgusting place"
Peggy P.,"Greensboro, NC",31,36,33,2.0,5/23/2017,We went at 2:30 in the afternoon so we didn't have to wait. Our service was great. We share chicken marsala and asked for it over mashed potatoes instead of bowtie pasta. There wasn't a lot of sauce so the potatoes were a better choice. The chicken was tender but it wasn't​ anything special. I was most shocked by the price of a glass of Pinot grigio being $9.50 and it was the house wine. My fault as I didn't check the price before ordering. Also the iced tea was $3.00 per glass. Too expensive for my taste considering it was just ok. I'll probably go back but just to pickup cheesecake to go. Probably should have gone to Green Valley Grill for the same price and their food is amazing.
Eric S.,"Greensboro, NC",28,25,105,4.0,11/13/2016,"Okay this may sound a little cheesy....  This is a great addition to the restaurant scene here in Greensboro. Very versatile, you could go on a romantic date or take the kids here for a family outing . This restaurant has a big dining area and is very attractive to look at. The food and service we received here were very good ."
Samantha T.,"Winston-Salem, NC",22,4,1,1.0,2/21/2017,"If you have a large party (over 4) don't even go.. don't think about going.. nothing.. the wait time is over 2 hrs even when they aren't busy. My family went for some celebrations, both visit we ended up waiting for 2 hrs. Friday night we went for a birthday, and when I got there at 7 I was told it was an 2 hr wait.. I contacted the rest of my party and they told me they called an was told it was 15-20 min wait.. when I mentioned it to the young lady at the hostess stand, looked at me confused and claimed no one would have said that.. Now the dining room was full and few people where waiting.. the bar was not full at all.. So I told my party the news and they requested to stay then I went to get a table, when I grabbed the clicker, I was told it was now 90mins.. Hopeful we waited and waited... and waited... and waited... about 75mins in.. I went to asked how much longer and they inform me I had wait so many amour of minutes.. and that another large party (who arrived after me) was in front of me.. when I mentioned they came after us why do we have to wait longer.. she just looked at me like I was stupid.. Very frustrating and mangers should have stepped in and fix the situation.. People who arrived was seated before us, even though we was a party of 6, and all you had to do was push 2 tables together.. We was walked over and seated last.. I hope someone sees this.. We should have been approached by a manager for waiting this long.. most other restaurants do.. we was simply ignored...   We was seated and our food was great and service was good. Better than when it was opening day."
Ashley B.,"Thomasville, NC",16,24,25,5.0,12/28/2016,For a restaurant that is highly reviewed and just opened we had to try it.  We only had a 45 minute wait for two on a Sunday night.  They had plenty of waiting area and you could have a menu to look at before sitting down.  Once we were seated our waiter was very nice and every course was amazing!
Kim S.,"Montgomery, AL",108,2,5,3.0,4/17/2017,"Eat here all the time. Food is good. Got to go twice. Ok service. First time pizza was cold. Got chicken salad sandwich with side salad. Had to ask for dressing. Got plain cheesecake. Bathrooms were gross‼. No paper towels as they are a green restaurant‼. Gross and unhygienic ‼. Discussed issue with manager about bathrooms and waiting in long line for to go food. Get curbside no wait. Chicken salad sandwich ok. Salad just greens added my own tomatoes, almonds and yellow peppers and now it's  better than just mixed greens. No more to go for me. Eat in restaurant on off hours and no wait."
Angel B.,"Winston-Salem, NC",4,2,8,1.0,3/11/2017,"Ive been to many Cheesecake Factory's (Vegas, California, Georgia, etc..) and this one is probably one of the worst. I have been several times and each time I go something is always wrong either they forget to place my order or finding a hair in my food. I placed a curbside to go order at 2:50, I was told it will take about 30 minutes, so I get there around 3:25 I park at the curbside to go parking and call them to tell them I'm here parked at the curbside to go and she says ok. She didn't ask me for my name ,what car I'm in or anything which is stupid because how are the going to know my order or what car to bring it to. I wait 25 minutes and nothing so I call and I tell them Im here waiting for my order to be brought out and they ask me for my name and what car I'm in. Another 10 minutes go by and she brings me order and my fries are all thrown in the bag my burger is soggy, my salads are dilapidated. If I'm spending almost $100 for my food it shouldn't look like that, I tell the girl that I just want my money back and she gets a attitude, like what the hell are you mad about I should be the one with the attitude. I got down and spoke to the manager so they could just give me all my money and leave. She did offer to put the order in again but I don't have time for them to make the food all over again I was already there for 2 hours. I live 15 minutes from this Cheesecake Factory but I would rather drive 2 hours to the one in Charlotte they have way better service."
William C.,"Jamestown, NC",0,37,,2.0,6/20/2017,"Not bad crowded at 5:00 pm on Tuesday.  Nice decor.  Service lady was nice.  Took 20 minutes to get food.  Food was EXCELLENT!   Way way way way way too expensive.  Twice what it ought to be. Had chicken Parmesan pizza style, and chicken reisling. Great taste-very spicy.  Drank lots of water!"
Keela D.,"Kernersville, NC",1,17,,3.0,10/11/2017,"The food is good but the cheesecake is mediocre. You would think it would be made from scratch since it's the cheesecake factory but majority, if not all, of the cheesecake is pre-made and from a box."
Angela S.,"Manchester, NH",34,20,23,1.0,3/19/2017,"Waited over 2 hours for a table of 8 at 3:30 pm.  Outside of the parking lot being full, there were open tables, so I was slightly confused when the Manager had to approve the host accepting my table request for the long wait; apparently this restaurant can't handle large parties.  We were seated a little before 6 and promptly ordered appetizers. They were served timely but save your money or order a salad. The Korean cauliflower was smothered in sauce and way too sweet. Over an hour later we we had to get a manager to expedite our food.  Folks all around us were being served so I'm assuming something went wrong with our order. We were there to celebrate a birthday and it turned out to be a very bad decision. I dine out a lot and don't consider 8 an unusually large group, if you have a large party I'd recommend finding another place to go - this restaurant is not worth the wait or price. They should stick to what they do well - cheesecake plain."
Jordan S.,"Greensboro, NC",34,13,1,5.0,6/14/2017,"Cheesecake is amazing, but it should be; it is the cheesecake factory. The food is also just as good though. I had the grilled Salmon with Rice and Green Beans. Salmon was cooked perfect. My wife's however, was close to swimming back off her plate it was so raw. Service was superb and cheesecake as always was fantastic."
Deon H.,"High Point, NC",1,10,,3.0,3/17/2017,"My job gave me a $50 gift certificate to this place so I figured $50 off a meal would ease the headache of a possible hours 'plus' wait.  I took about 45 minutes to get seated.  Overall my eating experience there was slightly above average (as was the food).  The exception to the meal was the small plate tuna tartar-- this had to be the best tuna I've ever eaten.        The bar that night was top notch, no matter how busy they seemed, I only had to wait maybe 30 seconds to get a noticed and served.  Daniel behind the bar made my drinks and they were spot on.  So if I was just rating the Bar 'that night', I would give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars no problem, but the menu is too long, the food was ok, and the cheesecake that I had was slightly still frozen.         If I get another gift card, I would go back.  If I find out that the wait there is only 15 minutes, I would go back. If I only wanted drinks, I would go back.  Unless at least one of the prior three conditions arise; I would probably go somewhere else.        To sum it up, this place was not bad, and it was not mind blowing.  It's just a place that has a long, long wait for slightly above average (moderately overpriced) food."
Kenny P.,"Eden, NC",3,22,,2.0,9/10/2017,"I went here for the first time yesterday for my early birthday dinner! The outside, and inside of the place looks fabulous, the wait time is very acceptable for the crowds that line up outside.  I was told 20 minute wait time, however it was more like 35-40 mins, still no problem.  The parking lot is too small for this place, you will probably have to park at one of the shops.  The employees were somewhat friendly.  The friendliest employee was the cook who brought the food out! Haha.  The waitress was pretty good also, but....she offered to refill the drinks only 1 time! I have to mention the cleanliness of the place inside.  I noticed that there was a napkin on the floor against the wall, food laying on the floor, and tables were not being wiped off, before other customers sat down, employees were just laying plates on the table, and leaving.  Now for the food, my bro. ordered the macaroni & cheese burger with fries, I ordered the fish & chips with fries, & coleslaw.  For the apps my bro. ordered the buffalo blasters, and I ordered the loaded baked potato tots.  The burger was pretty much burnt, my fish had no taste whatsoever, the tartar sauce they make is nasty! My tots were very good though.  The prices do match the quality, or quantity at all.  Also just to let you know this place is not a quiet place by far.  I have figured out if you eat here do not order something that you can get pretty much anywhere, everyday.  For example order something like a pasta plate, or steak.etc otherwise you probably will leave unhappy like myself.  That's it folks!!!"
Corey W.,"Greensboro, NC",208,7,2,2.0,3/11/2017,The Raleigh location is 100 times better and they take reservations. I won't go back to this one until they start taking reservations.
Tish C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,9,77,4.0,11/3/2016,"Great food. Great atmosphere. Awesome staff. Our waiter Zack was excellent. Fully expected their to be a few hiccups with the service or food since it's newly opened. However, everything was great! No problems at all. One thing to note though is that the floor was very slippery through the restaurant. I heard quite a few other people comment on the same thing. So be careful. Hopefully they'll fix this. Otherwise, can't wait to go back."
Bernard L.,"Greensboro, NC",296,7,4,2.0,6/1/2017,"I've given this location four times to get it right. Each time the service gets slower and slower. Which is disappointing when their competitors have literally mastered how to make a lunch meal for a person who has a lunch time frame to stick within. Do yourself a favor and make the trip to a nearby city. I imagine you'll travel, order, eat and be home all before you ever get your dish. Poor poor job!"
Wendy C.,"Tucker, GA",1,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,"The food is okay but the service is pretty bad. I came here for lunch, the waiter supposed to take care of us but he DID NOT!!!! The coffee supposed to be refilled but he NEVER came to our table to ask. The other tables that he serviced were good. That's suck! I will never come here again."
Lou R.,"Greensboro, NC",24,32,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Ok, what's going on here! I gave them 6 weeks after opening to get things worked out before trying to visit.   At 4pm, 50 minute wait for 2.   Went shopping for about 10 minutes, checked in, oh its about 40 -45 minutes! Then about 20 minutes later, beeper went off! Go figure! Then,  took 10 minutes for server to arrive, then another 10 minutes for drinks. Then, 40 minutes for 1 order to arrive, then another 10 for the other one! Check took 20 minutes! Food is good, but a bit overpriced and  I for one don't have 2 hours plus to spend. Tried takeout a week later- hung up on twice, then when phone was answered, the order taker was rude to me. Maybe I'll try again in a year or so. Maybe."
Alison F.,"Greensboro, NC",0,2,,1.0,2/16/2017,"We waited several months before trying this restaurant - to give the opening crowds a chance to die down and to give the restaurant time to ""iron out the kinks.""  We should have waited longer.  We arrived after the lunch rush on a Thursday. The restaurant was perhaps 1/3 full. We were seated at a two top that was very close to another table and began our wait.  Our server rushed by with a quick ""I'll be right with you"" and then we waited another 7 or 8 minutes before he returned.   Our order was simple, two cold appetizers off the ""skinnylicious"" menu and an order of sliders.  35 minutes later we got up to leave..no food, no server.  We spoke with the manager about the long, long wait and about that time the food came out - which we did not want.  The presentation on the sliders was awful, they were small, squished and the grilled onions we asked for were nowhere to be seen.  The cold appetizers (summer rolls and a salad) looked okay, but not worth a 40 minute wait. The manager said she wouldn't charge us - seriously? With a 40 minute wait and telling her we did not want the food after that amount of time she better NOT charge us.  She did offer to box our food to go. Out of curiosity,we took only the summer rolls.   A good manager would have offered an incentive to come back, but that didn't happen. At this point, we won't go there again. And, by the way, the summer rolls were basically dry and tasteless.  The only reason to go to the Cheesecake Factory is for the Cheesecake and since we don't eat sweets, there's really no reason to return."
John H.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,3,1,3.0,1/5/2017,"This is the first time that I dine in this location. I ask the waitress about the salmon on the menu if it was farm or caught in the wild. She said that it was not farm. So I ask where it was from. She left to find out and when she return, she told me was farm out of California where corporate was in the Atlantic Ocean. Never the less I did not order the salmon. They should train their wait staff. I bet she doesn't have a clue that the Atlantic Ocean is not on the coast of California and that you can't farm in the ocean. She was not a blond."
