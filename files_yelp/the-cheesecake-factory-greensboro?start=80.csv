Cari S.,"Charlotte, NC",8,11,10,3.0,3/29/2017,"My grilled tuna salad was extremely bland. The cheesecake excellent. If you're one of the unfortunate ones seated in the bench seating areas, with several tables for two placed side by side, be prepared to feel like you're eating dinner with folks you don't know. Impossible to have a private conversation. The noise level in this restaurant is ridiculous. Will come back for cheesecake though....and get it to go."
Carla J.,"Greensboro, NC",0,4,,3.0,4/11/2017,Because it is new it is still ok. I have been here 3 times already and each time the service has. Even spot on and food good. If you can stand the wait you will enjoy.
Mark B.,"Winston-Salem, NC",58,86,48,1.0,12/29/2016,"We decided to try a random Thursday night. It's been open a while, so we didn't expect a crowd. We were give a hour and a half wait from the hostess booth and went to sit on the heated porch. After an hour my wife went back to the hostess station for an update and was met with a very rude reply. It didn't seem to be the crowd but a very disorganized staff that was creating the wait. A little over an hour and a half we were seated. My wife and son ordered pasta and I got the bacon-bacon burger. And.. we waited. So long in fact the server and manager appeared to apologize for the length of time. It was explained they had dropped my sons pasta in the kitchen. Once received my wife's pasta was cold and my burger burned.. the meat, bun, and bacon. And.. my fries were missing. When they finally did come they were not the sweet potato fries I had ordered. After a mediocre dinner at best we ordered a price of cheesecake to share. This too took forever. It was very good however, but not to warrant the cost. In the end we were out $60 for 2 adults and a 10 year old and had a lower than standard dinning experience. No attempt to come my sons pasta for the wait, I guess because apologies are free. No returns for us."
Charlie W.,"Madison, NC",0,1,,1.0,11/30/2016,"Absolutely terrible service, especially given the price of the menu items. Will definitely not be recommending this chain to others in the future. We decided to go during off-hours, when it might not be so busy. For reference, we arrived at 2:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon---it was by no means busy when we got there, maybe a half dozen tables had patrons. We were seated fairly quickly, but then waited half an hour for someone to even ask us if we'd been helped yet. 45min of sitting before we finally got drinks and were able to order an appetizer. By the time the waiter came back around to see if we were ready to order, it had been almost an hour and a half since we'd been sat. The folks in booths behind us had been sat after us and managed not only to be served, but ate, paid, and left before us. We got our food two hours after we'd sat down, and they got my fiance's order wrong. But, we were unable to catch any waiter's attention to correct it, and opted for taking our meal to-go in hopes that we'd be able to leave sooner and just take what we were paying for. It took us a total of two and a half hours to eat a small lunch during off hours. While I know they've just opened and are still fairly new, that's no excuse for the terrible service. If you don't want to spend nearly three hours eating a small, unnecessarily expensive meal, then save yourself the trouble and go to Cheesecakes by Alex instead."
D D.,"Laurinburg, NC",0,9,,4.0,3/27/2017,"I am a fan of the desserts. I am one who likes cakes, it doesn't matter what knid of cake. The cheesecakes here are something special. I have tried every flavour they have. I use it as a treat when I have to go in the town they are located in. I live about two hours away from this gem. So, when I have to visit any town they are located in I treat myself and my family."
Blake L.,"Greensboro, NC",0,2,,1.0,2/4/2017,"This was a horrible experience. My friend and I went into the restaurant just wanting two slices of cheesecake. We went to the Togo side of the restaurant and tried to order. We stood at the register for 5ish minutes while the women working the register stood there and complained about how annoying ""black customers"" had been that night. We ended up ordering and she did not speak to us at all only looking us prompting us to speak. Just overall very disrespectful attitude and unlike anything that has ever happened to me at a restaurant. I will never have her take my order again. Would not recommend."
Amy R.,"Greensboro, NC",1,4,,2.0,12/8/2016,A party of 11 for our Xmas lunch.... seated in bar at 3 cocktail tables. I don't write many reviews but the food and service were some of the worst I've had and I eat out a lot. The Hibachi steak ordered medium. Rare with heavy grizzle. I ate the potatoes and vegetable and never said a word as I rarely saw waitress and knew it would be an hour to cook more. I can understand A Saturday night perhaps but we are talking 2 pm on a Thursday. Never saw a manager. The two stars were for the cheesecake only. Can't tell you which one because I just had a bite. This place won't last long in Greensboro with this staff.
Mike M.,"Greensboro, NC",20,4,,2.0,4/7/2017,"Ordering carry out proved to be a difficult task as the app does not give clear instructions. I started the order online, then was given a number. Had to call restaurant to place order and then they entered the number and I could then use the app to pay. Went to pick it up and had to wait 10 minutes before they came out to tell me that i still owed money. I showed them my receipt and after another 15 minutes they came back out with my cold food. Never again will I order carry out from this place. Awful"
Amanda W.,"Durham, NC",1,124,45,4.0,3/7/2017,"This is a favorite restaurant of my family!! We were in town and decided to try this one. Service was great by our waiter! Food was good as usual! I order from the bar, passion fruit margarita, super yummy with plenty of alcohol!! The drinks are pricey but awesome! The only reason I gave four stars was they were out of some of the items we wanted to ordered which is a bummer. They need to keep food items in stock! That was frustrating...especially when u have your tastebuds on particular food item."
Akisha J.,"Wilmington, DE",141,182,127,3.0,11/11/2016,"Having been to plenty of Cheesecake Factory's this was my least favorite experience. First the location is awful in terms of parking. I always have to park all the way over in the Belk parking lot, I wonder how much of that was considered when they were building it at its current location. The food is good.... as usual. The most consistent part of a Cheesecake Factory is your favorite dish is always going to taste the same no matter the location (the Miso Salmon is the BEST)! The service is pretty good too. I sat at the bar this last time and the servers were nice and pretty on point. The restaurant is way to small to meet the demands of the G'boro market. I've heard of 2 hour waits at this place. It's also very tight in there... I feel like everyone is sitting on top of each other. But like I said.. the food is good.. you really can't go wrong you just have to manage your expectations when going."
Kenny J.,"Kernersville, NC",0,3,,5.0,8/21/2017,Very good food.  Good service.  Coffee cheese cake was awesome and Orange chicken dish outstanding.
Terri B.,"Cherokee, NC",0,2,,5.0,3/24/2017,The food and cheesecake were all fantastic! Our waiter was awesome and very helpful! I'm sorry I didn't get his name. My 8 year old loved the extreme Oreo cheesecake and the white chocolate raspberry truffle was heavenly
Travis P.,"Elon, NC",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2016,"The worst experience I have had at a restaurant!!! Waited 25 minutes more than the 40 minutes I was told for a table. Then the service was the worst. No silverware no bread nothing!! Finally the food came cold with no apologize, ask for the manager. She said oh that's not right sorry and brought me the bill for 55 dollars!!! Avoid it's not worth it and the manager or management needs serious help!!! Avoid at all cost!!!!"
Lisa L.,"Greensboro, NC",9,23,,3.0,12/11/2016,Extraordinary food but management seems to not understand how to successfully run a restaurant where the customers comfort comes first. It's been open for two months and is still run pretty rough. Common sense says let the line run through the warm patio not out in the cold.
Maureen S.,"Greensboro, NC",18,35,8,2.0,10/23/2016,"This review is 2 stars only because of service issues.  I thought all the food was excellent.  We had the avocado and zucchini fries and grilled artichoke appetizers, both of which were good.  The flavor on the grilled artichoke was out of this world.  For entrees, we had the anti-oxidant salad, the guacamole salad, chicken mushroom marsala, a kids chicken tenders and a kids grilled cheese.  Took home the white chocolate raspberry, banana and original cheesecake.  Everyone loved their food. Now for the service.  I want to preface this by saying that I completely understand this is the first week they opened and that deserves some leniency.  But my issues are listed below:  -Time between being seated and getting a drink order in was to long  -time between getting drinks and getting food was way too long  -had to request things multiple times (beer order 3 times, ketchup twice, etc)  -was asked TWICE if I had paid for my beer that I brought to the table from the bar.  Once is almost understandable for new wait staff.  Twice was rude, offensive and forgetful/negligent.  Learn how your bar works our as the bar and not the customer if the tab has been closed out.  -on a separate occasion (today), I called in at 3:20pm to check on the wait.  I was hung up on twice before finally getting someone to transfer me to the hostess station where a woman in a deadpan voice rudely told me of course there was a wait.  After a few moments of silence I asked what the wait was.  Exasperated, she asked how many in my party and then told me 2.5-3 hours and hung up.   I get that there will be growing pains but if you are going to charge these kinds of prices, the service needs to be better and the hostess needs a serious attitude adjustment, no matter how far in the weeds they are.  The food was good, the cheesecake was excellent, the service was pretty bad.  I will amend my review if we go back after it slows down and the service improves."
A A.,"Winston-Salem, NC",1,45,18,4.0,2/7/2017,we love cheesecake factory!! Cheesecake factory has not let us down yet! we were told the wait would be 30minutes but we only waited 15-20mins. Awesome waiter!!!
Rob G.,"Greensboro, NC",0,1,,1.0,8/8/2017,"Let me start with the only good thing, and that is the ambiance.  The restaurant is very nice as far as looks and layout.  Now onto the bad.  There were 3 of us that went there for a dinner on a Sunday evening.  They brought us bread, with no plates.  I caught a waitress and asked for some bread plates.  She came back a minute later and said they were out of bread plates but would get some to us when they had some.  First....that wouldn't work as by that time we would be done with the bread.  Second....how do you run out of bread plates?  And how are we supposed to butter them without laying them on the table....so we used our napkins as plates.  And the bread plates never came. We had 3 simple orders.  2 were a hamburger and fries, one was a steak and fries.  They brought out the hamburgers and steaks with no fries.  I asked where the fries were, and they explained they weren't ready yet but they didn't want our burgers and steak to get cold, so brought them out first.  Really?????  I expect that at a McDonalds, but if I am paying $14 for a cheeseburger and fries, I think they can do a little better than that.  The fries came out about mid way through our eating our burgers/steak.   I had 2 beers....Red Oak.  Pretty popular around here, and I expect to pay $4, maybe $5 for that beer.  I got the bill and it was $7/beer.  My fault, I should have asked, but wow, that's ballpark prices.   Food is good, so I guess that is the second good thing, but I'll never go back.  I can get good food a lot of places, good service is getting more rare, and these guys aren't even close."
Sarah M.,"Greensboro, NC",121,3,10,3.0,12/2/2016,"My mom and I came for a late lunch and the atmosphere was wonderful, the building really is a vision. The entire restaurant is clean, neat and absolutely beautiful. Our food was incredible. We had the skinny summer shrimp rolls as an appetizer and then we both had the Vegan Cobb salad with salmon and it was perfection. The service however is where my experience loses stars. Our server was very polite but paid very little attention to us, sometimes taking 10-15 minutes before returning to our table. Perhaps this wasn't the best call for a quick bite when you have other obligations in the near future."
Bashir D.,"Greensboro, NC",10,10,6,1.0,7/9/2017,"Don't waste your money nor the time. Cheesecakes are the only thing that they do right. Not sure if it's worth the 10$ though.  You'd expect better service and hot food when you pay 20$ or more per plate. We ordered the 15$ nachos appetizer, for 15$ I'd expect fresh chips, not cold chips that tasted as if they were fried two days ago. We didn't eat that.  For the entrees, we ordered chicken enchiladas, miso salmon and the bang bang chicken and shrimp. The rice for all the entrees were not edible, the rice was still crunchy and wasn't cooked well. Told the waitress, she said she'll bring us a bowl of rice. That took around 10 minutes, by then the food was cold.  The worst part of the trip was when a mosquito fell on the chicken enchiladas. We stopped eating from that, the waitress asked if we needed a box for the enchiladas, we told her no we're not going to eat that after a mosquito fell on the plate. She didn't seem to care and asked if we need the check.  We left paying over 100$ for three not cooked well plates and a cold appetizer."
Kim R.,"Raleigh, NC",0,21,4,3.0,11/12/2016,The food at Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. I have never had a dish that I did not enjoy. The Gboro Cheesecake Factory......why did developers choose this location???! Parking and traffic is horrible. No options for Valet. The service is extremely slow. We sat down at 12:30pm. Had to flag another waitress to find ours as we sat for 20 mins waiting to place our orders. Left at 2:30pm. Just slow slow slow. Will stick to the locations in Durham and Raleigh!
