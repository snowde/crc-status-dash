Kyla J.,"Simpsonville, United States",92,6,1,5.0,16/12/2017,"The perfect place for a night out with my family. With a hungry 8 year old boy, the cheese sticks were out in 3 minutes!!!(lifesaver!!!) I had the eggroll sampler and the hubby enjoyed his  . Service was great, food was cooked to perfection. 5 star dining experience."
Kelly J.,"Simpsonville, United States",63,6,,4.0,25/10/2016,"Shannon, the bartender, greeted me immediately. I came in starving and a little ""on edge"". Ordered a glass of red wine. I had the ahi tartar for an appetizer. Refreshing and enough to hold me over for dinner. I decided on the   medium rare for dinner. Mark cooked my steak to perfection! Ended with (no judgement, but enlightened encouragement from Shannon) on 3 cheesecakes Togo. My first time at his location and won't be my last! Thanks for making me feel welcome being all alone! See you soon!"
