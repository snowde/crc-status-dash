Abigail M.,"Greenwood, IN",21,4,2,5.0,1/4/2018,"My boyfriend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory. We had ordered the Chicken & Cheese Quesadilla for an appetizer, following with our main courses: The Macaroni & Cheeseburger and the Parmesan & Herb crusted Chicken.       This restaurant is absolutely phenomenal! Their facility/restrooms are always spotless clean, with an artistic decor that is stylistic and refreshing. The waiter/waitress staff are always prompt, knowledgeable on the restaurants' food and beverages. They're also sharply dressed, and on their toes, and show impeccable customer-service skills at all times.      The food is made from pure scratch, and their beverages are always fresh. The prices are about the same as Olive Garden, however, you receive much better quality food and service here than at Olive Garden. You definitely get your money's worth at the Cheesecake Factory. I highly recommend this restaraunt!"
Nikki M.,"Indianapolis, IN",27,12,1,2.0,9/24/2017,"Unfortunately, I don't think we will be back to the Greenwood Cheesecake Factory location. Our food was fine and our server Peyton had a terrific personality and great attitude despite being slammed in a bar area she had to herself. I could even forgive that the hostess stand messed up and underquoted our wait time by nearly double (quoted 40 min, but sat in us 75 for a table of 5). What did it for me was witnessing the hosts tell a manager the situation, watching the manager come to the host stand and avoid eye contact and refuse to acknowledge us. Then when we were being seated, I expressed my displeasure about the excessive wait time to the host who said she would have a manager come speak with us.  A manager never came. It would have cost the restaurant nothing to simply come and say, ""we messed up and we are sorry you had to wait longer than we told you, but we are glad you stayed. Let us make it up to you."" Instead, nothing.  The ONLY reason we didn't leave was we were celebrating my step-daughter's birthday and she chose this restaurant 2 weeks ago and has been looking forward to it. We have celebrated her birthday there every year for the last 4 years. We waited because it was what she wanted, but she even said afterwards that she won't choose here next year because no one ever came to apologize.  I worked in restaurants all through high school, college, and graduate school. I know how things work. We weren't looking for anything for free, but a manager who cares about their restaurant and their server knows that evaluating the satisfaction or lack thereof by a patron is fundamental to the success of the business. It is essential to ensure a server isn't subjected to an irrationally angry customer as much as it is to win over a dissatisfied customer and ensure they come back.  As far as chain restaurants go, I had considered (up until recently) Cheesecake Factory a step above the likes of Applebee's, Chili's, or TGI Friday's. This experience tonight showed me it isn't any better from a service perspective, it just has a larger menu and a higher price point.  For the money, there are better places to go like Stone Creek, Fireside, or Revel. Skip the chains and spend your money with locally owned establishments who value their customers. That's what my family will be doing from now on when dining out on the south side."
Clumxee W.,"Indianapolis, IN",24,2,,3.0,8/4/2017,Dinner time! We had a 30 minute wait. Food was great but service was slow. :) We waited for a good 10 minutes for our waiter to get us a refill. The miso salmon was so good.
JR F.,"Plainfield, IN",23,58,53,3.0,6/11/2017,"Overall a great experience as far as food and service, but there were a few draw backs to dining at the Cheesecake Factory.  Walking in your greeted by the hostess in their spacious waiting area and right in front of you is a giant display of all of their mouth watering cheesecake options. Seriously, so mouth watering. The average wait time is about 15-30 minutes but lucky for us, we were seated immediately.  The menu has a WIDE variety of food ranging from pasta and salad to steaks and shrimp. The portions provided are very large and definitely something you'll have to pack up and take home. However the cocktails were pricey for what they were. Nothing special or unique. Just expensive. (AND THE MULES ARE NOT IN COPPER CUPS!? What?)  The restaurant has many seating options for all different party sizes. (Long tables, high tops, bar top, booths, outdoor patio) whatever you may prefer they'll have a table for you. My main complaint is that the tables are very close to each other and it makes for a impersonal experience in my opinion. Also, this place is extremely expensive for what it is, we paid $90 for two people. Glad I got to try it but I probably wouldn't return."
Tori C.,"Indianapolis, IN",29,104,92,3.0,6/9/2017,"My boyfriend and I had both never tried the Cheesecake Factory before and decided to try it out on a Friday night for our anniversary. We both had friends that told us it wasn't worth it, but we actually both really enjoyed it. I don't think we would have picked it as our anniversary dinner if we had been there previously and knew what to expect, but we are still glad we tried it.  We were seated immediately around 7:30pm on a Friday night, but the table was less than ideal. We were at one of those really long booth areas with small tables and then chairs on the other side. Convenient when pushed together for large parties, inconvenient on a date when there are two different couples approximately 2 feet away on each side. We could hear both conversations throughout the dinner. We were disappointed we got sat there because there were plenty of open tables, but I'm sure they had their reasons so we didn't ask for a change.  We each got an alcoholic drink. Sangria for me, pineapple mule for my boyfriend. The menu didn't have prices for alcohol and once we got the bill we were less than thrilled to see they were $10.50 each. Pretty steep price.  The meal includes complimentary bread and butter, which was good, but not spectacular. I ordered the chicken parmasean pizza style -- it was DELICIOUS. It was off the ""special"" menu inserted. It was a large chicken coated in bread crumbs and covered in marinara in cheese. My boyfriend truly thought it was a pizza. Then on top there was angel hair pasta in alfredo sauce. I loved it -- he wished he had ordered it too. He got the four cheese pasta and added chicken. He liked his, but was definitely envious of mine. The servings were big enough to fill us and we both still took leftovers.   We got a slice of the Adam's peanut butter and caramel cheesecake to go. Very good and just the right size for us to share! The menu also didn't list prices for cheesecake -- $8 for this particular slice (not sure if that varies??) Overall -- delicious food and we were glad we finally tried the place out. However, the meal was $75 for two people before tip which was pretty pricey. This is definitely not a place that I would go to ""just because."" Yet it didn't really fit the bill as a formal restaurant either. It was one of those in the middle type restaurants -- great and expensive food but still casual (and crawling with kids)"
Pals S.,"Greenwood, IN",41,33,94,5.0,5/7/2017,"One if my faves. Beautiful interiors, clean. Fast service. Endless vegetarian options available and a variety of food choices available.  Our server was very warm and personable. It was my son's birthday and Jordan or server went an extra mile to make him feel special by giving him a chance to share his opinion and experience that night with dinner. She was very patient with us as we were deciding and made great recommendations!  We had a great time!  Quality and quantity: perfect.  Great service.  Great food choices.  I am glad they continue to serve on the South side of Indy."
Brie G.,"Chicago, IL",151,326,691,5.0,3/26/2017,"During my most recent visit, I was looking for lunch during Lent on a Friday. This is tricky unless you want breadsticks or pizza, neither of which I wanted. I was so happy to see options on the menu and even more so to actually eat the avocado eggrolls. They are so flavorful! It's actually an appetizer and I could only eat about half. As always, the portions are generous here. During previous visits, I have really enjoyed the factory chopped salad. It has a great mix of chicken, bacon, lettuce, dressing, and a whole bunch of other tasty ingredients... including avocado. I continually visit this location because more often than not I am seated right away, have friendly service, and really delicious food. Oh, and I hear the cheesecake isn't bad either."
Aaronsdigitaldj V.,"Indianapolis, IN",7,22,7,4.0,10/7/2017,"Great ambiance. A very nice restaurant. The menu is vast. It is very easy to get lost with so many different choices. We had appetizers, soup and salad, steak, pasta, and dessert. Everything was good and everyone said they were satisfied and that they would order it again. I really appreciate the honesty of the waitstaff to be blunt and speak the truth. I always ask the staff because they eat there all of the time. I highly recommend the dessert. If you have to, eat dessert first."
Brittney R.,"Indianapolis, IN",38,236,660,4.0,2/17/2017,"Who doesn't love cheesecake...a restaurant designed around cheesecake...yes please!  I honestly have to say that I don't frequent this restaurant, but I can't tell you why.  It just never crosses my mind when thinking of places to eat, even though I love their desserts.  But, this time when a friend wanted to take me out for my birthday, I wanted to go somewhere I don't frequent.  I was really happy I chose TCF.  I ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich which came with a salad, from the ""skinny"" menu.  It was soo delicious and filling.  My friend ordered the herb crusted chicken with the green beans and mashed potatoes.  There were a couple complaints about the warmth of the food, but the waitress made it right immediately with little wait time.   We had a hard time deciding on which cheesecake to order for dessert because they have so many to choose from.  We finally settled on the white chocolate raspberry and lemon meringue.  Both were heavenly.  They load the pieces with whipped cream!  I will definitely start frequenting this restaurant more often."
Nancy Z.,"Indianapolis, IN",62,81,130,4.0,7/30/2017,"Don't go around dinner time because the wait will be long. We had an early dinner and got a table right away (5pm on a Saturday). The waiter was very attentive and did a great job refilling our drinks.  My only complaint was that during dessert I ordered a latte and my latte came in a tall glass instead of a coffee cup.  The complementary bread was delicious - hot, crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I could seriously fill up on the bread alone.  We ordered mango chicken from their new menu and it was delicious. There were small chunks of mango in the dish with the perfect ratio of mango and chicken. I will be getting this dish again when I return!!!"
Ashley J.,"Greenwood, IN",64,63,13,4.0,9/10/2017,"We don't go here often, but when we do we're always satisfied! The food is great and the service is very good. Drinks are a bit pricey and not very strong, but if you don't drink or stick to beer and wine, you'll get what you pay for."
Stephanie B.,"Columbus, IN",46,75,44,5.0,3/10/2017,"We stopped by for some cheesecake for Valentine's day. I got the Hershey's piece & my husband got the Oreo Dream. They were delicious! they are a bit pricey for 1 piece of cheesecake but it's worth it :) It took me 3 or 4 nights to eat my piece b/c it was so rich! Delicious & tons of options! When i'm in the mood for cheesecake, we come here! so see you soon!"
Michael U.,"Columbus, OH",284,267,2,2.0,1/16/2017,"Okay I should know better.  If you are okay with chain restaurants you will be fine with this.  I DO NOT like chain restaurants but sometimes, graciously go with someone who picks one so as not to be a bitch.   If you live in a small town with no options and go to the mall you probably think this is fine.  And it is..but JUST fine.  Not great.  The service is robotic, the food is assembly line with absolutely no heart.   Why would ANYONE go to one of these places when you can go to something original and thoughtful?"
Michele M.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,10,15,5.0,10/23/2017,"Our mommy and son date was great.  The food was amazing.  I had the eggplant parmesan and he had the Cajun chicken little dinner.  It was one of the best meals we have had out in a long time.  All the food was fresh and hot.  Our waiter Nathan was great.  The typhoon punch I had is my new favorite drink and my son loved his Georgia Peach.  Oh, and don't forget about the complimentary warm honey wheat bread and butter.  Just a great dining experience with no wait to eat in the bar area.  I can't wait to go back."
Nikki H.,"Snellville, GA",154,212,429,5.0,4/9/2017,"You can't give a low rating because of too many selections and that's my only issue with Cheesecake Factory. There's so much to choose from and then they added more menu items. I had the Riesling chicken. It was sooooo good. The servings are enough to feed two people. It was a Friday night and the wait was long, but well worth it. Even though this is the place for cheesecake, I can't resist the chocolate tower truffle cake. Another menu item that can feed two people."
Robert E.,"Louisville, KY",5,22,16,5.0,9/16/2016,"Thai so one of our favorite places to eat. The clam chowder was AH-MAZING!! The Cajun Jambalaya was a bit too ""tomatoey"" for me, but it was fantastic. Also, the service was great...& our waiter, Brandon Summers, did a great job!! One funny thing that happened during this visit... When the young lady brought us our food, she offered to put fresh parmesan cheese on it. Of course, we said 'yes!' When she started to grate the block of cheese, it broke & flew out of her hand & it hit me in the side of the head!! LOL. Too funny. We wound up getting the whole block left at our table. LOL!! At any rate, this is a great place to eat. Happy dining!!"
Ashlee S.,"Greenwood, IN",5,3,,4.0,10/6/2017,The Greenwood Cheesecake factory is probably my favorite restaurant.  The chicken Marsala is exceptional and large enough to take left overs home. I recommend the red velvet cheesecake for dessert and if your to full is always a great take home for later. The Peach Bellini is my favorite drink and is a must try if you like fruity drinks.
DonnieBillie P.,"Madison, IN",11,12,5,2.0,9/23/2017,"We took our adult kids out to a birthday dinner Thursday evening. We had a very personable and professional waiter who took out order in a reasonable amount of time. Everything after that was very unfortunate I got my meal and we waited for the other three. The manager came out and explained something about a problem producing my husband's order and  asked if he'd like anything else. He didn't have time to wait and then eat so he declined. Eventually my sons meal arrives and he was happy with it. After another wait of about 10 minutes the birthday girl's chicken alfredo arrived. By then I had been done for a while, and my son was nearly finished so he ordered dessert.  Birthday girl found a tiny worm I her meal after a couple bites. The manager was very apologetic and professional as well. She brought out a full cheesecake in apology.  Birthday girl ordered another meal and eventually a birthday choir sang to her and brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake. Which she loved.  My son still didn't have his dessert. We asked again.  In the end, we were charged only for the 2 alcoholic drinks.  We appreciate the comp and the nice staff but this place was having serious issues. Won't go back.o"
Ruth T.,"Indianapolis, IN",10,65,386,4.0,1/8/2017,"I have only been to this restaurant once, and i have to say i was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't like i had imagined. It is a mid-scale restaurant, clean and nicely laid out. There was a very long wait time (close to 40mins) when we got there, but then again, we went on a Saturday. Everything on the menu sounded so delicious that it was hard picking an item. I ended up getting the Renee's special which included a choice of sandwich, cup of soup, and salad.I got the chicken salad sandwich, potato soup, and Caesar salad. The brown bread is awesome, and the meal was fantastic! I was extremely hungry by the time we got seated, so that might have contributed to everything tasting extremely good. Anyway, dinner was topped with a slice of mango key lime cheesecake. I had to take my dessert to go since i was extremely full after the main dish. The cheesecake was extremely good, light and sweet."
Doug T.,"Greenwood, IN",0,6,,5.0,11/14/2017,"One of my favorite places to eat.  Food is excellent and the cheesecake is to DIE FOR!!!  Like others have said, going at peak times can extend your wait times for service but if you keep that in mind, you will have a wonderful meal."
Alajawan P.,"Zionsville, IN",40,22,40,4.0,8/10/2017,"What is there not to love about fried macaroni and cheese balls amazing!!!!! When dinning the cheesecake factory you can rest a sure that there will be something tasty for everyone. It's a Classic American  menu with the wide variety of options. The inside is very well decorated with a elegant vibe, my dining experiences was very  pleasurable. The Cheesecake Factory is a perfect place for a great for date night, or a birthday dinner. You have to absolutely try the fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer and they are simply amazing and one of the main reasons why my family and I dine at the cheesecake factory because the macaroni and cheese balls are fried to perfection with crispy crunchy golden outside and a nice creamy layer of cheesy macaroni goodness on the inside ...food for the gods !!!! For dinner I order the filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Steak was prepared very well, and side also matched full of flavor.  Now for desert .....how do you come to the cheesecake factory without dining on a piece of cheesecake ???? I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it was absolutely everything I expected and much more delicious!!!!"
Jalee L.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,122,244,4.0,12/30/2016,"The only thing I'm dinging them for- They don't take reservations or even call ahead on weekends or evenings. Making a dinner there a guaranteed wait time.  My favorite thing about The Cheesecake Factory- Their giant menu. It has every type of cuisine so no matter how large your party everyone can find something delicious (or many things!). Hence my recommendation to put your wait time to good use by asking for menus and mulling over your carvings prior to getting seated. As a creature of habit I usually go with the Spicy Cashew Chicken (ps- you can ask for it not spicy!) Every once in awhile I will mix it up and go for the chicken pot pie smothering biscuits or one of their numerous pasta selections.  I am also a fan of large portions. Their prices are a little steep for one meal, but when you make it two the math works out perfectly every time.  And of course we must mention their cheesecake. I've never had a bad piece and this is definitely an area of the menu that I like to mix it up. My favorite piece that I truly melted over was at my most recent stop- Their Peppermint Bark Cheesecake. It was light and fluffy, not a true dense cheesecake and it has the slightest hint of chocolate to balance the mint. Not to mention the sprinkling of peppermint bark on top. Delicious!"
Zachery S.,"Indianapolis, IN",94,5,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"Worst experience from a restaurant and only been here 20 mins.  If you want a hostess to speak to you as if you are a idiot please feel free to come here.  Then to be seated and be pushed past by a waiter.  Nope I'm good thanks though.  We did the ""call ahead"". Just to sit and wait 30 mins. Sooooo why didn't you tell me when I called we would still have a 30 min wait and that my waste of time phone call was pointless.  Other than that the waiter is totally on it and very responsive and helpful"
Beth A.,"Indianapolis, IN",153,3,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Everything took a long time this evening. Our server was not available most of the evening. Everything was backed up per the server, the excuse for the long wait on food, bread, and desserts.  Bread was offered but never brought to our table. However all the other tables were delivered bread. We felt like she was pre judging us, little did she know we tip very well because I am a server. We will not be back to this restaurant."
Jesse W.,"Columbus, IN",18,19,88,3.0,10/23/2016,Why the 3 stars? Just because of the simple fact that the food is pretty bad. My girlfriend and I ate here twice and both times it was just horrible. So we've decided to only eat here when we are in the mood for their cheesecake. Thats the only reason we come here is for their cheesecake.       Also the only reason they got 3 stars was because they take more pride in making their cheesecakes than they do with their regular food. Their cheesecakes are the best I've ever had.
Brandon S.,"Greenfield, IN",32,72,97,3.0,3/27/2016,Always love the Cheesecake Factory.  This was a Monday night and we wanted to try on a less busy night which it wasn't busy at all.  We got seated right away.  Once seated we where asked for drinks.  We got water.   On my wife's water cup it looked like it had not been washed.  It had major floatage.  Something crusty around the inside.  She didn't notice until after drinking for a a few minutes.  We let waiter know.  He immediately got fresh cup.  The food after that was very tasty and the service was very good.  Bread was good as well.
Aaron D.,"Indianapolis, IN",74,21,3,5.0,7/9/2017,This place is always great. Came here for my 1 year anniversary and it was more than perfect. Food was excellent and the service is even better. Highly suggest a visit if at the Greenwood Park Mall.
Diane S.,"Franklin, IN",31,205,179,4.0,5/5/2017,Excellent food with a huge menu my personal favorite is the lettuce wraps and all the cheesecakes of course. Love it here
Jason A.,"Indianapolis, IN",18,213,2,4.0,3/6/2016,"Just like Webber grill and Bonefish, Cheesecake is one of those chain locations I have no real problem with. Not sure I would have spent my own money here but had a $50 gift card with 2 complimentary slices of cheese cake, so yeah I'm down. Like others have commented the menu is the size of War and Peace, can you imagine prep time for all of that? Decided on the grilled pork chop, wife got the bang bang chicken and shrimp combo, kid got the grilled cheese. Pork chop was good, moist all the way through, sides of mashed potatoes and green beans were competent, wife's meal was good, too much rice for me even the kids grilled cheese was good.  Service was kind of slow, slammed for a Sunday afternoon our waitress was overwhelmed, once it lightened up was much more efficient she was very nice and apologetic. Cheesecake was wicked good, huge not sure what it cost as it was free, if it's free it's me, could have ate the whole thing myself, kid and wife got in the way.  I know it's hip to bash chains, but really every time I've eaten here I can't complain, would I have eaten here without a gift card? Meh it's a push, if somebody else is buying, I wouldn't complain."
Maryanne C.,"Toledo, OH",47,5,11,5.0,8/27/2016,Portion sizes are amazing!! Cheesecake is out of this world!! Beverages are a bit over priced but worth it if they are the handcrafted frozen drinks. 4 people=$144
Andrea S.,"Indianapolis, IN",15,12,,5.0,2/11/2017,"Last night we just wanted cheesecake, so we waited through the to-go line. It was pretty long, but we were in and out in 5 minutes. I was so happy to see that they still had their holiday cheesecake on the menu!"
Elissa V.,"Plainfield, IN",33,5,,2.0,5/12/2017,Delicious food- absolutely horrible service. We literally asked for bread 4 times. Came after our meal. Martini had something in it and the olives were old. Drinks and meals for the four of us came at all different times .
Tiffany K.,"Bloomington, IN",66,129,708,5.0,8/19/2016,"I've been wanting to come here since last year but with the construction in Martinsville, it is hard for me to get from Bloomington to Greenwood. We drove up to Greenwood on a fairly busy day for the Cheesecake Factory, but the wait wasn't too bad. All the staff members were really friendly. We didn't have any problems ordering. They had a wide selection of all kinds of food, and of course, cheesecake. The only thing i wish they did have was a cheesecake menu at the table at all times. My boyfriend asked our waiter if we could keep a menu for later. That was a very good idea on his part. I saw other customers having to ask their server for menus later on and that just seemed very inconvenient for these busy servers. Everything we had was simply amazing. My boyfriend did state that he couldn't really taste the mac and cheese balls on his burger, but I would eat that chicken and biscuit everyday if I could. Neither my boyfriend or I are very big cheesecake fans, but we did share an Oreo cheesecake, and it was great."
Laquetta D.,"Indianapolis, IN",127,101,446,4.0,2/1/2015,"Trying new things and loooving every bit of it. My new favorite is the ahi cappacio (not sure if I'm spelling it right) but it was absolutely divine. The cream of chicken soup with artichokes and mushrooms....delicious. And my entree, the fish tacos were really good too.  My tummy was super happy to be here today."
Rachel T.,"Brownsburg, IN",8,10,2,5.0,9/11/2016,As expected on a Saturday night we had a relatively long wait. They told us 50 minutes but our table was ready in less. The food was awesome and great portion sizes. The cheesecake is delicious. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive even with the rush. It was my first time and I know we will definitely go back. We spent about $120 for two adult and two children. My kids loved the kids menu choices.
Rachel S.,"Greenwood, IN",103,138,29,4.0,6/6/2016,"Service started out a little slow, but the server went out of his way to make up for it (he was swamped with a larger party). My friend and I started with the portabella, avocado, and zucchini fries ( yum!), then split the macaroni and cheese burger. A) Glad we got it! B) Glad we split it! Such great flavor and texture! We should have split the cheesecake, too. Woof. I always forget how overwhelming their big desserts can be! Tasty, but overwhelming. I branched out with the Reese's Cup cheesecake and c was not disappointed with its salty-sweet flavor and the texture of the peanut butter cups. A good experience overall!"
S H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,10,,5.0,2/21/2017,"Best meal I've had out in a long time. Probably in about a year. And I eat out a lot. I was just looking for a good meal somewhere that wouldn't close at 10, and I am really glad this was about the only nice place open in the area. The menu is monstrous, so maybe I just got lucky but the Thai chicken was amazing. Drinks are overpriced ($4.50 for OJ? $8 milkshakes??), but what are you gonna do. Just save your sugar fix for their eponymous cheesecake. My waitress, Peyton, was ever-present without being overbearing, which is actually a very hard balance that most restaurants seldom ever seem to manage. Even the free bread was impressively flavorful. I will be coming back."
Jen F.,"Indianapolis, IN",131,313,209,3.0,5/16/2015,"Mr. Jen F lured me here one Saturday.   The food is actually pretty decent, but seriously the menu is a book.  How is that even possible? We started with the house made guacamole, which was super yummy.  Seriously, though, guacamole is kind of like pizza.  Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  I spent many years not eating guacamole without ever trying it.  I declared that I didn't like it, despite not really knowing. I'm a weirdo like that sometimes.   I had fish tacos and Philip had some kind of pork bbq sandwich.   Portions are huge.  Fish tacos don't reheat well."
Tiffany B.,"Indianapolis, IN",372,821,1983,1.0,3/17/2015,"Ever been to a place where the human experience tanks the taste of a good meal? That is this place. We  What set this one apart in a bad way was the poor management. Never experienced a more rude and clueless manager.  Don't make the mistake we did and think that you can request a channel change in the bar--even if the bar is empty. And even after bringing the poor behavior of an assistant manager to the attention of the GM, not only was my experience not validated or taken seriously, but to not be wise enough to ask what she could do to win our business back. Will never spend money in a place that treats customers as we were treated."
Aaron S.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,4,3,4.0,6/20/2016,The food was Awesome. The service was average. We went for lunch during the week and we were seated immediately. We quickly got our order in and food arrived quickly and was very fresh. All ingredients and portions are great. Even something as simple as a kid's spaghetti was delicious. We got the smores cheesecake to share and we were blown away by how good it was. Only downside was waiting for our waitress who disappeared a couple times for 10 minutes or more during the desert and time to get our check. This is especially annoying when you have toddlers who are finished eating and ready to get moving. We will definitely go back but hope we get a different waitress!
