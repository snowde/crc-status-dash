Patricia N.,"Indianapolis, IN",142,573,281,5.0,3/8/2011,"This review is solely based on cheesecake, not the food, not the service.  (I usually don't come here for a meal, since the food is mediocre and over-priced.  Though, if you do eat here, I would recommend the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta.)  So back to the cheesecake...Over the years, I've tried pretty much all of their cheesecakes.  Usually all delicious, though my favorite is the Vanilla Bean.  However, I might have found a new favorite after trying a bite (ok half) of my roommates Ultimate Red Velvet.  I always thought it would be too rich and indulgent to be good.  But let me tell you it was DIVINE!"
Matt F.,"Indianapolis, IN",73,276,40,3.0,7/13/2011,"The food is so-so. The cheesecake is the bomb (sorry, I had the time circuits set to 1992). It's a bit overpriced and not worth the hour wait that often precedes your meal. As far as sit-down dining at Greenwood Park Mall goes, it's probably the best. Of course, that's not saying much because the only competition is BJ's, Bravo!, TGI Friday's, and Applebee's. I'm sure I'm forgetting one or two sterile, corporate restaurants that claim to be a ""neighborhood favorite.""  Have dinner somewhere else and come here for desert and a drink at the bar."
Lauren H.,"Sterling Heights, MI",178,155,29,2.0,3/8/2013,"Most people know what to expect when they walk in here- it's a chain where they serve overpriced decent food and have amazing cheesecake also expensive.  My recent experience last month made me obliged to write this review... it was the service.  I have been to this specific location twice, the first time had service that wasn't memorable but this last time it was absolutely horrendous.  My boyfriend and I ordered our meals, then only saw our waitress again when she dropped off our food at our table... nevermind that we had empty drink glasses, wanted to order cocktails, and wanted more bread.  Then, while we were eating I had to flag over the manager to request refills on our beverages- the manager didn't even apologize for the waitress.  We decided to order cheesecake at the counter to go because we did not want to be at the mercy of the waitress or have our tab even higher for a waitress who barely deserved the tip we left for our meals.  I am more than understanding if it is a bustling evening during the peak dinner time- this is in a suburb of Indy (not downtown Chicago) and was a Tuesday night at 9pm... the rush was over if there was one for the night.   Side note-What is it about Cheesecake Factory's that require the seating to be as close as possible?  It's like a requirement for a new restaurant opening to cram in as many tables as possible.  I would rather wait an additional 10 minutes for a table to open up that can actually accommodate me and all my food on the table instead of sitting at a little 2 top sandwiched between 2 other tables!"
Scotty Z.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,124,2,5.0,11/19/2011,"I'm bumping this place up to five stars. Everything here is solid!. I've been to this particular restaurant a fair number of times already...enough to be impressed with their consistency. Every meal is hot and fresh, every server is friendly and attentive. If you've never been, the restaurant itself is beautiful. Enjoy a drink while you get lost in their expansive menu. It may take a while to choose an entrée."
Chianne H.,"Greenwood, IN",0,9,,5.0,2/24/2014,"Great service and great food! Being vegan it's sometimes hard to find options besides salads and fries but luckily for me and vegans everywhere they have a delicious veggie burger. Also, let me make the distinction that this is not some frozen microwaveable veggie burger option, it's handmade perfection! Even if you are not vegan I would highly recommend that you try this burger next time you go to the Cheesecake Factory!"
Andrea G.,"Indianapolis, IN",17,102,20,3.0,6/23/2013,For the most part I like the Cheesecake Factory especially now that its trying a lite menu.  They certainly have something for anyone with their menu reading more like a book than your average menu.  I really like their pasta carbonara and of course their cheesecakes.  Their Godiva chocolate and lemon raspberry are always good choices and if the fall their pumpkin is a fun selection.  The service is hit or miss here.  I've had great experiences and then I've also had drinks spilled in my lap with little more than a quick apology.  It is noisy so it may not be the best place for larger groups.
TOMMY o.,"Indianapolis, IN",111,540,1320,5.0,3/23/2008,I LOVED Everything about this place  & the food was FAB order the sauces before you head out the door because that To Go Bar is hoppin!!!!!!!! the ENTIRE Staff was so Wonderful handicapped parking right by the Front Door great place to people watch during short wait for Dinner i can't wait for our next Lunch there
Britt M.,"Nineveh, IN",0,7,,2.0,3/18/2014,"I tried this place a few different times and always end up disappointed. I do enjoy the fried mac n cheese appetizer and the cheesecake, but those are the only dishes that are consistently worth the trip."
Ed S.,"Indianapolis, IN",25,16,,2.0,2/12/2011,"The food was OK, but a bit over priced for my taste, I would have much rather have eaten at Bravo's next door. Aside from their deserts, nothing on the menu was worth mentioning. Also, their Greeter/receptionist, was extremely rude & full of herself! If our friends had not been sitting down already when we got there, we would have definitely left! All in all, I would say skip this place, and walk 30 feet to Bravo's! The food is better, the atmosphere is nicer, and the wait staff is much more attentive.  Oh, and on to top it off, it took them 45 minutes to bring my wife a Fettuccine Alfredo! All in all, I say pass on this place"
Devin H.,"Indianapolis, IN",469,27,27,4.0,12/8/2010,"$48 for a whole cheesecake, ouch! I think I will pass and buy from another establishment. Thanks! Devin Huner"
David I.,"Vancouver, WA",867,449,459,4.0,2/2/2008,"This place has an enormous menu!  I have only eaten a few things off of it in the many times I have eaten here.  The cobb salad is to die for, the portions are insanely huge.  The ahi tempura rolls are also great, very light and tasty.  I would stay away from the chicken pot stickers, they are heavy and doughy. The cheesecake is good, but they stopped making them onsite and started trucking them in frozen.  As a result, the quality has suffered."
Richard H.,"Indianapolis, IN",66,643,12,3.0,11/18/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, so you pretty much know what to expect.  What you may not expect is that this location is much, much smaller than any other  CF I have seen, so the wait is terrible."
Tita P.,"Chicago, IL",146,252,,3.0,8/30/2009,"If you know me you know that I love breakfast.  I used to enjoy the brunch at Cheesecake Factory a lot when I lived in Birmingham but since moving to Indy I have tried to go to places that I have not  been to in the past.   Today my sister and I went to Cheesecake factory for breakfast.  It was like seeing an old friend.  MM good!  I tend to have a signature dish at every restaurant.  Today was no different.  I ordered my regular breakfast and accompanied by good coffee and a really good server I found it to be an enjoyable experience.   So, the plan is to wait a few months and rediscover breakfast at The Cheescake Factory all over again."
Thuy T.,"Indianapolis, IN",174,59,6,2.0,3/2/2011,"I hear a lot of negative reviews about the Cheesecake Factory in general...mediocre food and high prices.  I'm going to have to add bad service to their repertoire.   I've been to this location quite a few time just to get their Red Velvet Cheesecake to go.  It is so divine!  A while back I went to the Keystone location for their happy hour specials.  Their bar food was nothing special to me, good thing it was discounted because I would  never pay full price for it.  Due to that experience I never was in a hurry to try their dinner menu.    I finally got the chance to try out their food during a birthday lunch.  I was excited because my friend had just recently told me about a great dish she tried.  Upon arriving at our table I saw how packed this place was, they had to be doing something right?  Let's just say it was a bumpy ride from the beginning.  Our waitress was not exactly lively and it seemed like she was rushing us to order.   We all wanted to try something different so we can share with each other. We started out with the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, it reminded me of corn bread which I love by the way.  The tamale cake was sweet but the sauce was citrus-y, I thought it went together really well.  We all really enjoyed the tamale cake.  When we got our entrees, I realize the portion was pretty nice but I wouldn't expect anything less with the prices we are paying.  I ordered the Garlic noodle (suggested by a friend) because I love garlic!  As soon as I took a bite, BANG I was hit by a brick of salt.  All I could taste was SALT.  Everybody had a bite of my dish and we all agreed this was inedible.  I sent the dish back and they assured me that they will have a new dish within 10 minutes.  10 minutes passed...20 minutes passed...30 minutes passed... 40 minutes passed and everybody was pretty much done with their meal.  I hate being put in this situation because I felt like our party didn't want to order dessert until my entree came out.  I went ahead and told the waitress to pack my meal to go and we were ready to order dessert. At this point I'm having a pretty crappy lunch but I know the red velvet cheesecake will turn my frown upside down.  Almost half the table was planning to try the red velvet cheesecake as well, thanks to me raving about it throughout lunch.  I couldn't believe what was happening when the waitress let us know that they are out of the red velvet.  AHHHHH!!!  You can say I had a pretty horrible experience at the CF.  At least the manager waived my meal for free since I did not get to eat with my party.  Let's just say this was my first dining experience with them and will also be the very last."
Marcie M.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",434,519,29,4.0,4/6/2009,"Unlike the previous poster, i do not consider this an ""upper end"" of any spectrum.  There are some MUCH nicer and more upscale restaurants in Indy...this just made me giggle b/c everyone's perception of upper end is different.   Anyway, fear not, it's a great lunch and dinner location. I agree it can get VERY busy.  If you want a table on a weekend, don't attempt to make a reservation (they don't take them -  yet another clue it's not upper end), but you can seat yourself at one of the five tables in the bar.  Yah...not a lot of choices there.   We went for my sister's birthday last weekend.  We got in fine right around 6 and there were 7 of us in the party.  Our total bill with tip was around $160.  Yet, ANOTHER reason this CANNOT be considered upper end. :) Sorry, dude.  But upper end is $100 per person, not total for 7 people! It's affordable, the portions are RIDICULOUSLY offensively big but also delicious!  I always get and recommend the Crusted Romano Chicken...It is my favorite...The menu is FUCKING huge. I hate to use the word fuck (well, no I don't) but it is.  I mean, it took my poor father (his first time) nearly 15 minutes to read it and then another 15 to make a decision.  I see NO reason to have/offer that many options! However, I agree....everything is good and our entire table was satisfied from the Mahi Mahi to the fish tacos to the chicken entrees and MAN, they were fast!! Our waitress ...was good, though not that personable.  I'm sure she was busy!  But I like someone to be a bit sweeter.  However, she did take the time to embarrass my sister and sing happy birthday.  Love that option (another clue it's not ""upper end"" - yes, I'm pounding that guy but seriously??).   The cheesecake is great, but for anyone who thinks they make it in house, you are sourly mistaken.  It's shipped in from CA to all the Factories around the country - yep, just another chain in Indy. Awwww...Le Sigh. No matter what, it's a always a great option and if you have picky eaters who never know what to get, this place offers ENDLESS food options and has something for every taste bud. Can't beat that or the $160 tab for 7 freakin' people who order three courses.  Not bad at all."
Nikki B.,"Greenwood, IN",9,57,,4.0,2/8/2011,"This place alone is one of my regular monthly strolls! I heart this place so much. now I'm still shedding pounds from delivering the new man of my life, so I figured that since I only gained 30 lbs why not splurge today. Most of which I already lost at his birth! I'm loving it, now there's just a strong urge to be pleased with The Cheesecake Factory pleasantries! Let's just say that I was feeling a little velvety! lol!  Okay I watched a youtube video about this couple that brags on how you can be young & married & happy. I don't quite know what attracted me to this since I'm almost divorced, but the situation at hand is she mentioned red velvet cheesecake from here. Now I knew that I wanted to eat something that was sweet so I stopped by here to see if it was really all that! Well as stated The Cheesecake Factory not only took the recipe & up'd the ante, but they put an whipping on my grandma's ole traditional red velvet cake & I have yet to see anyone do this. I paid about $8.00 for the slice of cake, but it was definitely worth every single bite that I took. I had to give the rest  to my kids, it was to much for me to consume in one sitting.  Since I like to try new things, I will order the pineapple upside down cake when I go back. Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts & I know where to go get my itch scratched if I'm in need of a good sugar fix!."
Elisa C.,"Dallas, TX",51,141,7,4.0,12/4/2011,"Depending on what day/night you go...your experience can differ. I feel that's like most places anyway. The 2 times I have been here I've had a good experience but others not as much. The food is excellent and their menu is huge. If you can't find something to eat here then I am not sure where you will. The cheesecake is like a party in my mouth. Seriously, you can't go here and not get a slice. The drinks are great as well. Then again that depends on the bartender but both times my were excellent and strong. I can see why this place has such a wait and you should avoid those days, Fri-Sat."
Catherine K.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,378,44,3.0,9/25/2011,"Yeah, they're a chain. But a tasty tasty chain with ridiculo-humongous-gigantasourous portions that I get like 3 meals out of. So WINNING. The giant menu is a gimmick, yeah. But they deliver. It's always good. I want to hate them, but I can't. The waiter talked us into taking home a slice of the Hershey bar cheesecake and it. was. so. good. You spend a lot, but you get a lot."
Joel F.,"Indianapolis, IN",102,274,19,4.0,9/20/2013,"This has always been one of my favorite restaurants. The food is always delicious and I love the open bar tops especially on busy evenings. Tonight, we arrived about 7:10pm and were told about a 40 minute wait...which turned into 50. Not a huge deal, after all we were a party of 5. Typically we have excellent service, but tonight that was not the case. It took quite a bit of time for us to get our drinks and for him to come back and take our order. When the order was placed, however, our food did come out pretty quick. The food was delicious and no one had a complaint. We did have to ask several times for drink refills, and I had to ask for parmesan on my pasta di Vinci; which typically is offered when they drop off your food. When we were all done with our meal we of course ordered cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious, however everyone at the table was given a drink refill but me. Apparently he thought I wanted to drink my 1/4 cup of melted ice and diet coke. All in all i wasnt impressed tonight with the service, but have had such great expereiences in the past that i will definetely be back."
Mark J.,"Indianapolis, IN",6,35,,4.0,7/21/2008,"This place is definitely on the upper-end of the spectrum, though not to terrible as far as fancy restaurants go.  The service is not bad, but the place can get really busy, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings, which slows down the frequency of free refills.  The staff itself is incredibly knowledgeable, having tried a huge variety of their own dishes.  Even in light of how busy it was, our waitress was able to chat with and discovered that she attended the same university that I had. The atmosphere at this particular location feels very much like a slightly-fancy place for suburban families.  Dressing up isn't necessary, but one might be out of place wearing jeans with holes in them.   The menu itself is riddled with just downright interesting dishes.  Lots of high quality pasta (as you might expect), but also neat twists on more standard dishes.  Check out their omelets.  Oh, and, unlike a lot of places, here they sing the real Happy Birthday song.  The copyrighted one."
