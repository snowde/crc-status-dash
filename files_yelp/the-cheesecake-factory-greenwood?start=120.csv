Music M.,"Greenwood, IN",0,8,,3.0,11/8/2012,The food is good (not great).  I find the service great.  You have to work at finding menu items.  My biggest  complaint with this location is it is so loud.  It is hard to hear others in your party.   I rarely go here and it is ok once in a while and of course the cheesecake is wonderful.
Eric M.,"Evansville, IN",0,13,1,2.0,2/28/2013,"I've eaten at probably 10 different Cheesecake Factory locations. This one is probably the smallest as well as perhaps the worst experience from a food/service perspective. I really do like the CF menu/food/experience, just not this location..."
Swt P.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,124,1,3.0,11/10/2010,"My family and I always enjoy having special meal at Cheesecake Factory. Though it is always packed in the weekend (both locations and it is also true for its Chicago area location), I stil think this is a fun place to go with your family, friends or just as a couple for any special occasion.  Also, the noise level is high, but we can still make a good conversation. Their menu is very extensive - from breakfast menu, pizza, pasta, Asian, and many more - that will definitely please everyone (...or might confuse the first timer ;) ) young or old.  This particular location in Greenwood - service is good, but the place is small compared to other CF location at Keystone or other states. Be prepared for the long wait in the weekend evenings - it can be 1 to 1.5 hours long. In this case, you may as well go eat at the mall foodcourt and finish the meal plus ice cream from Maggie Moo's in less than 1 hour, then browse the books at BN store for half hour, and you can come back for a cheesecake...LOL... Their price tag is moderate, at $11-$17 per entree, or more for specials and steaks. Appetizer costs at around $8-$10. You can easily spend $125 or more plus tip for a family of 5 (= 2 adults + 3 children under 10). However the meal is huge and you can always share, especially the dessert - because you will be full by the time you are ready for it. Remember, you can also order ""lunch"" until 5pm - the price is about $2-$3 less from regular price, but the portion size is still BIG... Thai Lettuce Wrap is a good one to try for appetizer. Their guacamole is good too. I love their Crispy Spicy Beef. The kids' meal is well prepared and it comes with a drink. My favorite dessert is Strawberry Shortcake that I usually share with my husband - it is delicious and a great dessert to end the big meal. Their coffee is very good too (maybe it is Illy coffee?). But if you have room, you should always try their cheesecake. Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake is my new favorite one. CONS: Previously, my favorite was Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I love the breaded shrimp and arugula in it. I could only have 3-4 bites and have plenty left over for the next days. However, this dish is in the ""not that"" list according to David Zinczenko ""EAT THIS NOT THAT"" with 2,730 calories 78 g saturated fat, 919 mg sodium, 141 g carbohydrates Many of their dishes are loaded with fat and sodium, and high calories. In summary: Cheesecake Factory is a fun place to be with your friends and family. Choose and eat your dish wisely..."

The time I went for lunch I believe the salad gave me food poisoning. That was not a good experience. The dinner I had was just fine. The dessert I had was by far the best. There is a reason they name this place after their desserts. Can I recommend the raspberry chocolate cheesecake? Yum yum! Their coffee cheesecake is also quite great."
