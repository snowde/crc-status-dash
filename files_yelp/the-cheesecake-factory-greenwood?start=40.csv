Anwesha D.,"Bloomington, IN",0,19,,5.0,6/3/2017,Amazing Food! We had the pasta and the crab dip. And of course the cheesecake! They were delicious!!
Josh M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",55,59,219,3.0,4/16/2016,Went in with high expectations. Service sucked. Waited for refills and hour for food. The place looked cool. Cheesecake looked cool. Prices are outrageous. You're better off going to a better fancy/pricey restaurant.
Kara P.,"Greenwood, IN",31,142,34,4.0,1/1/2016,"I took my daughter here for a 'fancy' girls lunch a couple of days ago. It had been years since I'd been to the Cheesecake Factory, mostly because this place is pricey. That hasn't changed. But the food and atmosphere are still great. Our service was kind of slow, which always annoys me when I'm hungry, but the waitress was very nice otherwise. I had the margarita pizza and managed to eat half of it. My kiddo had the kids mac and cheese and the portion was enormous. She also managed to only eat about half of it. We split a piece of the 30th Anniversary chocolate cheesecake and it was divine. And we brought a piece of the Oreo cheesecake home for my husband, who said it was delicious.  Our two entrees, two drinks, and two pieces of cheesecake came to $50, including the tip. Which quickly reminded me why it's been so long since I've eaten here. But it was a nice little treat for me and the kid, so it was worth it."
Jessica C.,"Beech Grove, IN",61,8,18,4.0,9/29/2016,"Went for dinner with one of my gal pals and had a Wonderful Server named Tre who was very knowledgeable of the menu and a Great waiter, he took very good care of us! One of these best I've had in a long while, I must say! I had the small plates which wasn't overly filling but wonderful and left plenty of room for my desired cheesecake! Sometimes I get a regular platter meal and the servings are so huge that you struggle not to over eat! Loved the small plate concept! I had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and it was nice and light but could've used a little more salt for the Salted! I did request hot fudge drizzle to be added! Small plate Caesar Salad wasn't too over dressed but was still good size (I didn't finish it) and the Dynamite Shrimp was super light, crunchy, and tasty! The dynamite sauce was good and not too spicy, best word to describe it would be Zippy! Strawberry Daiquiri and Pina Colada were also very good! My friend said her cheeseburger was good as well! We also started out our meal with the Crispy Fried Cheese and it was the perfect bite, hot, crispy, and very good!"

Jessica G.,"Three Oaks, MI",0,10,3,3.0,3/31/2017,"Today is my fiancées great grandmas birthday. His brother wanted to take her out to a nice dinner so we chose the Cheesecake Factory. We arrived before their dinner rush and we had a very short wait; we put our name in and almost immediately got called for our table. The hostess brought us to our table and was very pleasant but when we got to our booth the seats were COVERED in bread crumbs and the hostess watched as my fiancée knocked off all of the crumbs so we could sit instead of taking us to another table that was actually clean. It looked as though a large group of rowdy two year olds crushed up all of the bread and  and threw it on the floor and on our seat. It was not  clean at all. After sitting down I noticed the music was very loud and we were struggling to hear each other. Our server arrived she didn't tell us of any specials or suggest us any dishes she just asked what we wanted. But she was very nice. We ordered our drinks and shortly after they arrived and she also brought bread. Which she forgot to give us plates for our bread. Which is very small inconveniences but they add up. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 like I wanted to is because of the food. It was delivered about 15 minutes after we placed our order. It was all very fresh! I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, my fiancée and his grandmother got the Catfish, and his brother got the Ribeye cooked medium-well. We all enjoyed our dinners the only complaint was about the green beans and the steak was mostly fat. At the end of our meal we all ordered cheesecake. Overall this was a nice establishment but I would definitely recommend visiting the Cheesecake Factory up by Carmel, it is much cleaner."
Evan F.,"Whiteland, IN",0,1,,5.0,4/16/2017,"Very efficient cheese graters. In under 5 seconds, my crusted chicken Romano was covered in a hearty amount of Parmesan. I would definitely recommend."
Elizabeth L.,"Louisville, KY",1,9,1,1.0,8/3/2015,"The food was poor, the service was snail-like, and our waitress, Whitney B,  did NOT ever smile or appear to remotely enjoy what she was doing.  When we needed her, she was rarely visible, and did not heed our attempts to hail her down. When it came  time to pay the bill, she had to be hunted down. We were seated within 5 minutes of arrival for a Monday lunch after what would be the END of a lunch period (12:45). The food took a L-O-N-G time to arrive, and when it DID finally come out, the child's meal for the 16 month old baby came out LAST,  leaving us to try and keep a baby from melting down from hunger since the limited amount of bread had been consumed during our lengthy wait. One of the meals was luke warm as if it had sat for a while waiting  to be served. Offers to refill drinks were not made...I had to ask for a to go refill, even though my glass was empty during much of the meal, and this request took an extreme amount of time, even though we'd communicated more than once the need for us to go.  We asked for our cheesecake to go since we'd indicated a need to leave in a timely manner. When it finally came, there were no forks/spoons, so I asked a bus boy. We received more service and friendliness from him than our waitress, and it was his first day. When the waitress eventually returned with the to go boxes and no bag, she stuffed them in the  bags that had cheesecake in them.   I'd say if the service was this poor during a non-rush time, I'd dread to attempt it during a busy time. I would NOT recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone...or if you DO decide to attempt it, allow for extra time and definitely  don't have anything of importance scheduled for later in your day.  When people spend the kind of money we spent for lunch, smiles and friendly service should not be optional!"
Ali M.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,26,14,5.0,8/12/2015,"Service was kinda slow for a weeknight, but that wasn't a big deal, especially when you dine in at Cheesecake Factory where menu is so extensive, nevertheless the food was excellent and on spot as usual, my meal was the Chicken Madeira, highly recommended :) Oh, and the best part of the visit, was of course the one and only, Red Velvet Cheesecake !"
Andrew L.,"San Francisco, CA",208,134,222,4.0,6/4/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory has been on my ""list-of-restaurants-to-go-to"" for a long time. I am proud to say I was finally able to cross it off my list today. I must admit, I had high expectations going in but the Cheesecake Factory exceeded all of my expectations. The restaurant chain has locations spread throughout the U.S. and today I visited the Greenwood location for an Easter afternoon lunch with my lovely parents. Upon walking into the restaurant, my first thoughts were that the place was very nice and that it had an almost ""high-end"" feel to it. When I was presented the menu, I was a bit confused though. What was said to be the ""menu"" looked more like a short novel. It especially felt this way when the waitress instructed us to turn to page 8 for a list of lunch specials (page 8 was about half way through this ""menu""). It was a bit overwhelming at first. After navigating through the menu for about 15 minutes, we finally decided on our orders. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and my parents ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Carlton Salad, respectively. The Chicken Costoletta was lightly breaded, served over a creamy, white sauce and garnished with finely sliced lemon peels. It was accompanied with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Honestly, this may have been the best meal I've had in the year 2013. It was that good. All of the flavors complemented each other very well and the chef prepared the food perfectly. My only regret is that I didn't save room for cheesecake, but luckily I was able to take a piece to go. Given the fact that the place is called ""Cheesecake Factory"" it shouldn't come as a surprise that their cheesecake is really, really good. I ordered the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake and it was one of the best pieces of cheesecake I have ever had (the best cheesecake I ever had was at One Market Restaurant in San Francisco). It was a combination of fudge, chocolate cheesecake and vanilla mouse, and yes, it's as good as it sounds. I am greatly anticipating my next visit to the Cheesecake Factory and I look forward to trying new things from their voluminous menu. I would encourage anyone to go and try one of the many cheesecake flavors they have, in addition to any of the main course options. You can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory."
Nirali P.,"Clinton, MS",21,6,,4.0,7/20/2016,"Great food, great service, and especially great dessert. However, it was pretty crowded and loud. Great music choice and the waiter also divided our appetizer and dessert that we shared."
Wanda M.,"Indianapolis, IN",466,716,5597,3.0,4/2/2013,"We had a special event a few weeks ago at this location for 16 of us; many of us had not seen each other for a couple of years which is why we explained and requested the Rotunda.  Our reservations were misunderstood and the service was LESS than desirable but our dinner reviews were 3 to 4 stars and one 5 star from our group.  I will preference this review with the Manager, once aware of seating and vast service issues did everything in his power to correct our unhappiness with the experience. The Manager was phenomenal and handled the situation with grace and we only wish we had made our situation known sooner to him. Apparently we were told our waitress was the best they had...??? Hard to believe!!!   Our Manager comp'd appetizers and desserts for the entire group which helped many of the groups ruffled feathers in the beginning.  However, several will not return due to the numerous issues experienced.   The Managers' effort was greatly appreciated and most did enjoy dinner so another chance could in order.  Even if we had interrupted folks in our booth getting in and out, there wasn't room to stand around the booths socializing with our friends without disturbing the family seated at the center table of the rotunda which we requested with our reservations.  The Managers game plan was to take over their table once they left to allow us space to move around from the 4 booths we were in. However, they stayed for hours, and rightfully so!!!, visiting with friends showing off their new baby which didn't resolve our situation as planned since they left as we were receiving desserts.   Regardless, we felt the evening was a bust!!  Basically, due to being separated into 4 separate, private booths, we only conversed and dined with the 6 friends confined within our booth. Because of this, many people couldn't mingle so hello and goodbye was the extent of their conversations.  Our total evening for dinner, even with the Managers assistant, from beginning to end was 4  1/2 hours!!! All were frustrated from the beginning with our seating arrangements to the length of time it took to correct and pay our bill. 4  1/2 hours is unimaginable for dinner here regardless of the size of the party or the 4 booths to serve. On a positive note, my husband stated his Club sandwich was the best he'd ever had. It was not lunchmeat but instead shaved turkey chunks piled high on his sandwich. The Chicken Carbona, Roma Chicken, Eggplant sandwich and the Steak Diane at our table was enjoyed by our group."
Keith H.,"Greenwood, IN",128,149,552,5.0,7/3/2014,"I like this restaurant very much. I just wish that they weren't so pricey. My favorite entree is the Miso Salmon. I also like their Orange Chicken. Their cheesecakes are really good, but a little too rich for my liking.  The restaurant is clean, the staff are always friendly, and the food is always delicious."
Mrs J.,"Greenwood, IN",7,14,,5.0,5/25/2016,"The appetizers are so filling, we don't have room for an entree! We usually split the delicious Avocado Egg Rolls and then choose a slice of Cheesecake to bring home. So delicious!"
Tristan K.,"Batesville, IN",537,13,7,5.0,11/15/2015,Excellent food and wait staff! Tops across the board.  Peak times have long waits but that's to be expected when it's a good place.
Akua O.,"Sterling, VA",27,193,202,4.0,4/27/2015,"My love for cheese cake factory continues. Although the wait was madness, they were great as usual! They were able to throw together a vegetable medley for me that wasn't on the menu which was great! The reason I love cheesecake factory, is that the quality is great and no matter which state you visit them in, you will get the same great food and service."
Peter P.,"Indianapolis, IN",167,1140,660,3.0,8/27/2013,Just stopped in for dessert and a drink on a Friday night.   Sat at the bar and it wasn't too busy (which the bartender said was because Friday night football had started that weekend).   Bartender was fast and friendly (without being too chatty). The cheesecake selection was so extensive it took me a good 5 minutes to decide on one.  It was a very good rendition of tiramisu cheesecake.
Natasha E.,"Ellettsville, IN",0,13,11,5.0,3/19/2016,Skinnylicious Asian Chicken Salad with iced mint green tea & S'more Galore or Vanilla Bean cheesecake for desert!!
Mark W.,"Indianapolis, IN",39,273,376,4.0,1/29/2015,"The service is always good and the menu is a bit overwhelming, it is a book.  I had the fish taco's and loved them.  My mom had a huge bar b que sandwich and could only eat half. My son had one of the burgers, but it came out on a hoagie bun which he didn't care for.  The kids loved free refills and I enjoyed my water.  We were all too full to try dessert."
Ana S.,"Indianapolis, IN",17,40,3,3.0,9/4/2016,"Went for a Sunday Brunch around 10am.  Good hostess, promptly seated and excellent waitress.  Reason for 3 stars:  Music with lyrics!! was so loud that we could not carry on any conversation unless we yelled.  Maybe it was the octagon room we sat in but we told the waitress and there was no change in volume.  Hey, it is early SUNDAY for brunch and there were very few customers and no one in the bar.  No reason for loud singing as there is no other noise to drown out.  Food was timely, we ate it all and had no room for cheesecake.  If we ever choose to come back, we will check the music first and leave if it is as loud."
