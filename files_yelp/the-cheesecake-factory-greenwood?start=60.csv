Ayla W.,"Indianapolis, IN",22,121,106,4.0,1/29/2016,"Love Cheesecake Factory. Love it! The only bummer about this place is that I think you pay more for the atmosphere than for the quality of food. The food is good, but not 5 stars at all. But the cheesecake is 5 stars!! That alone should get five stars. On of my favorites being the pineapple upside down cheesecake. If you can afford the calories...Get you a slice :)"
Hannah T.,"Terre Haute, IN",31,4,,5.0,3/17/2016,"Is the Cheesecake Factory really worth all the hype/price? Not really. But do I still come here all the time and make great memories with family and friends? Absolutely. I am not a picky person. The food is good, service is always at least passable, and I will probably never stop coming here."
Anastasia H.,"San Antonio, TX",179,287,165,4.0,11/26/2015,"hubby and I went for a appetizer date night. we shared the avocado egg rolls and the best part of the appetizer is the sauce- not that the egg rolls are bad at all. i had the guacamole ""super food"" salad but at first is was brought out with chicken mixed in and took some time to get the right salad out. hubby got the falafel (super food) salad and the falafel was probably the best of the times we had bought it because it was warm and crispy and has been pretty gooey the other times we had ordered it."
Sharee M.,"Indianapolis, IN",232,520,152,4.0,11/15/2014,I only come here to pick up cheesecake slices. Ive never been to the restaurant as its not my favorite chain. But the cheesecake service is great and fast whenever I go.
Marie R.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,,5.0,2/2/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  I really love the one at the Greenwood Mall.  And there are only two in the entire Indianapolis metro area, which leads me to my only complaint:  They are ALWAYS packed and wait times can sometimes be lengthy.  In good weather, no problem because you can wait outdoors; however, in rainy or cold weather, you are packed like sardines in a small area.  Ugh!!!! Now the good things:  The 32 page menu with so, so many excellent choices!  The wonderful, knowledgeable servers who hustle and work hard for a living and will do their best to make you a satisfied customer if you give them a chance.  I have been there three times in the past three months and enjoyed everything I tried each time.  My favorite was the miso salmon, which I cannot rave on enough about.  I also liked the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta; however, I really like spicy foods and this could have been spicier for my palate, but is still great as is and this is not a complaint.  I love potstickers, and their chicken potstickers do not disappoint!  YUM!  The Caramel Royal Macchiato is to die for and is huge.  It was great after coming in from a cold winter day of shopping.  It was like having dessert.  Everyone I dine with LOVES the cheesecake......of course!  When I eat dessert, which is not very often because I am too full from the wonderful food offerings, I prefer plain cheesecake and it is wonderful.  My friends prefer the many and varied flavors offered and they are always happy with them.  I also enjoy the pleasant atmosphere of Cheesecake Factory.  I realize some people complain about the prices at Cheesecake Factory, but I personally do not feel you are paying too much, considering all you get: the atmosphere, great servers, huge portions and wonderful flavors.  I also appreciate that there are lunch size portions available until late in the afternoon at reduced prices, but their ""lunch portions"" are still very large, in my opinion.  And, as unusual as it may seem, their lunch portions are available on weekends, not just week days like some places.  Overall, I give Cheesecake Factory at Greenwood Mall two thumbs up and will definitely return......OFTEN!!!!"
Javier M.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,3,,5.0,1/20/2016,"Very pleased with service, everything from our appetizer to drinks, entree, and desert were superb. Even our server, who was in training, was great. Will definitely be back"
April H.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,15,,3.0,11/21/2015,"Food is absolutely amazing I've never been dissatisfied with the quality of it. Very happy with our server as well. The front of the house was the only problem we had. During this instance we were told there would be a 60 minute wait. Ok, no problem. We go next store to Barnes and Noble for a bit and after 50 minutes check back in to make sure we didn't miss our summoning. I was told at that time it'd be abother 10-15 minutes. Ok, sounds about right.  30 minutes later. I go to make sure we haven't been skipped or overlooked or forgotten or erased because surely the people who came in after us shouldn't be getting seated as quickly as they were.  I'm told that they paged us 'about 20 minutes ago' and was asked, 'did your pager not go off?' Um, clearly it did not. That is the reason for our current conversation and I was actually standing here talking to you right around the time that you say we were 'paged'.  You came through shouting the name for a party of 6 at least 3 times but never once called out for our party of 3. There were no apologies, no recognition of a problem or mistake or miscommunication or anything on their end. They wanted to act like heroes because they 'could seat us immediately'. I'm not impressed, we should have been seated 20+ minutes ago. Offer me an apology or a free appetizer or something for our wasted time. They need to work on the consistency and thoroughness of the front end of things then they'd get a solid 5 star rating because everything else is on point."
Suzy B.,"Plainfield, IN",68,4,,2.0,12/13/2015,"A family member called weeks ahead to reserve a table for 20. They were told they don't take reservations. No problem, we all show up early and are told our wait time would be 45 minutes. A little over an hour and 50 minutes later we were seated! When the manager was questioned politely, she became argumentative. No apologies, no offerings to amend anything! However, with all that said, service was great!!! I ordered the fabulous nacho appetizer, it was very greasy, the chips were over baked, husbands loaded potato soup was very good. They have a vast array of dinner selections which are ""pricey!!"" We paid $65 for a bowl of soup, nachos that were not fabulous and a sandwich, and (3) soft drinks! Enjoy! If you have a large group go somewhere else!"
Anthony L.,"El Paso, TX",20,9,2,5.0,10/2/2015,I only went for the cheesecake but it was amazing. The staff was also outstanding and the bartender made a pretty mean mojito. The inside was clean and looked amazing.
Heather D.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,7,,2.0,8/13/2015,"My friend and I came in around 9pm tonight and it wasn't busy at all. We were immediately seated and given our menus, but sat there for 20 minutes and our server never came. We saw a lot of servers walking around and cleaning; even one server was waiting on a table close to us... Still, no one approached our table. We decided to just leave, which is really unfortunate because I usually love this place."
John-Scott S.,"Marietta, GA",9,1,,5.0,5/29/2016,"Great food, as always. One can always expect to get a good meal at this place. We had a waiter named Nick. He was a pleasant guy, just like any decent waiter, but what made him special was his personality. He had a special flair that showed a hard working attitude and strong managerial ability."
Pete F.,"Greenwood, IN",59,97,2,5.0,11/2/2015,I like cheesecake but it really isn't the best place for kids.  It is a bit upscale and it seems like they struggle to find something they like.  But the deserts make it all better.  The best times though are sitting at the bar and having a full meal sans kids.
Steven B.,"Alsip, IL",18,4,,1.0,9/11/2015,"40 minute wait,  not a big deal,  it is what we were quoted.  So they call us up that our table is ready.  We are then stuck standing at the hostess stand for 15 minutes because the staff is slower than dripping Heinz ketchup.  Finally get seated.  20 minutes just to actually get a waitress and drink order.  We order the nachos with chicken as well as beverages.  I think it's sad when we get our nachos before our drinks (note no alcohol was purchased).  Our nachos came out without chicken on them.  We then waited another 35 minutes for our food.  This is without question the worst service I've had.  I will not be returning to this location again."
Ashley S.,"New Palestine, IN",316,101,307,5.0,10/19/2014,"Most restaurants with such an eclectic and extensive menu tend to be a ' jack of all trades, master of none ' ( Gordan Ramsey taught me that ) but not the Cheesecake Factory. They have perfected nearly every dish - as I've never had something here that was bland or anything but delicious. The salads are always fresh and this is one of the few places in Indy you can get pine nuts added to a caesar salad (try it!), the Italian dishes here are divine, as is the pan-Asian cuisine. Personally I like to order a few small plates and share among the table since the portions of some items can be HUGE and overwhelming. The corn cakes are one of my favorites and the cheese bites are great too. And you can't forget about the cheesecakes - over 20 options to choose from! They are creamy and amazing and oh so rich it makes your heart pitter patter. The prices aren't outrageous but this is a nice place so expect $15-30 per person excluding any beverages."
Suzanne S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,24,,5.0,1/11/2016,Everything I have eaten has always been delicious. The food is pretty expensive. The cheesecake is very good but expensive. The portions are good and the food is hot.
DeAnna P.,"Indianapolis, IN",254,816,313,2.0,9/4/2013,"We sat at the bar for dessert.  The bartender was attentive and fast, but I just could not enjoy the cheesecake.  The first one was supposed to be raspberry white chocolate, but I tasted neither and it had enough whipped cream to feed a small army.  I sent it back because it was completely tasteless.  The next one I tried was mango key lime.  A bit more flavor, but with none of the zing you expect from key lime.  I felt bad sending back a second one, so I choked it down, but it wasn't that great.  The kid in me always likes to order milk with my desserts, and I was bummed that they did not carry skim milk.  I was also disappointed that my not so great cheesecake was nearly $7 a slice.  Probably will not bother going back."
Amber E.,"Indianapolis, IN",37,167,236,3.0,2/24/2015,"I was really excited about going to the cheesecake factory since I have never been but always wanted to go. The menu is extensive and has just about anything you would want. Unfortunately, I believe that this may be their downfall. It seems as though their dishes are just there for a variety. Nothing is done ""really well"". They should just stick to cheesecake-which is excellent."
Kimberly M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,12,3,2.0,11/16/2015,"Only good thing I have to say is our food arrived hot. My mother and I arrived and we were seated right away, of course our area only had 2 or 3 other occupied tables and wasn't busy at all. Our server, initials M.C, asked if we wanted bread and said he will bring it right out, 25 minutes later, after he had brought 2nd and 3rd servings of bread to the other 2 tables, socialized with them, and basically waited hand and foot on them...probably because they were dressed really nice and looked like good tippers, we finally got our bread. During these 25 minutes a woman was seated next to us and had gotten bread, order taken, order delivered, and had just asked for a to-go box. After receiving our bread we waited another 30 minutes for our lunch, which was grilled salmon, to arrive. It was delivered by a different server and in fact the only time our server interacted with us was to get our drinks, tell us he'll get our food right away (yeah...ok 55 minutes for salmon), and he was very quick about getting payment.  My mother and I both felt he neglected us because we didnt look as well off as the other 2 tables and therefore probably wouldn't tip well. We normally tip between 30% and 40% because we know a lot of servers dont make much. It was his loss though."
Kaci S.,"Indianapolis, IN",32,18,,2.0,10/21/2014,The menu was far to lengthy and the the menu items are expensive. The food was just O.K. I had a gift card and I'm glad I used it up because I do not plan on going there again to dine.
R T.,"Auburn, IN",17,190,1164,3.0,4/16/2013,"A clinical supervisor once told me that you should never try meth. He said that it's a horrible idea, because if you loved it, I'd use more and more and it would eventually kill you. Three stars for The Cheesecake Factory. I'm so screwed. For some reason. I am glad I live so far away. This place reminds me of a grade A--M.C., television channel series? It is the one where some guy runs a chain of fast food chicken restaurants. Everyone is commenting about how great it is, and they always want to drop in. Also he runs some sort of side business with it?"
