LaNae B.,"Larsen, WI",53,31,7,4.0,2/12/2016,We consistently receive good service and food when we dine at this location. Our favorite entrees are the cajun chicken littles and smokehouse bbq burger. Their skinny flatbreads are excellent as well.
M A.,"Bellevue, WA",46,81,16,4.0,1/15/2015,"It's good, but crowdy that's why I gave 4 stars."
Chris Y.,"Greenwood, IN",72,186,192,2.0,8/17/2011,"Enormous quantities of mediocre food with long waits and slow service. I don't understand why people wait an hour for this experience. I'm not a vegan health nut and each serving is two big meals for me. There's just no reason to serve that much food. Most people are leaving with shopping bags full of leftovers. I love the decor. The exterior and interior of the place are loaded with nice architectural details and great lighting. The cheesecake is good, I suppose, and there are dozens of varieties. However, I've had problems not being able to order the kind I want as availability of each flavor varies."
Susan F.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,180,50,4.0,1/21/2013,"I like Cheesecake factory-mostly for cheesecake. Their food is good, just kinda on the more expensive side for what you get. I usually go there for just dessert. On this trip, we had cheesecake and drinks for our birthday (a friend and I have the same birthday). I got my old standby, the Tuxedo cheesecake. It is delicious. My friend had the banana coconut cheesecake. She liked it too!  We also had chocolate martini's, which were yummy, and strong! A definite plus!"
Liz S.,"Indianapolis, IN",104,132,40,4.0,9/25/2013,"I get three things here: the brown oat bread & butter, the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake and the Firecracker Salmon appetizer. Those three alone might be worth the waiting... The brown oat bread is just so soft with that little texture from the oats baked on top... I don't even understand why that bread is so delicious.  The firecracker salmon is a decent enough size, that it's really my meal. It's delicious salmon wrapped in spinach and a crispy wrapper, on top of a bed of red cabbage and a sweet sauce that makes the red cabbage into a crisp, fresh salad on its own. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake has that right about of chocolate cake and mascarpone cheesecake that just melts in your mouth... JUST GET IT, OKAY?! It is ALWAYS packed. I don't even understand it. Honestly, this review is towards the Greenwood location ONLY. The Keystone location SUCKS. The service always sucks. But the Greenwood location is extremely friendly and quick on service. If you have a small party (2-4) and you're over 21, just rush over to the bar and seat yourself. No wait! :)"
G K.,"Brownsburg, IN",0,3,,2.0,1/23/2016,"Very disappointed in my last visit at this location. I ordered the orange chicken and asked my server if it was made with any nut products (I have a nut allergy and sometimes Chinese food can be made with nut products).  The server assured me there were no nuts in the orange chicken. When I received my dish, it smelled like ""peanut butter"". I again told the server and he said ""no"" there was no peanut butter in it. Well my husband thought the same thing. I took one bite and realized that yes, there was a nut product in there.  I told the server and I ordered another dish. He did not admit to any nut product, nor did he offer to fix the situation or comp part if our meal. Within 15-20 min I was having an allergic reaction. I began Coughing uncontrollably and I had to leave.My husband was left to box up the food and pay the bill.  The server did not offer anything...... Another waitress, whom my husband had summoned over, seemed concerned but did not rectify the situation.  Fortunately, my reaction was minimal."
Sarah T.,"Huntington, WV",29,165,83,3.0,12/10/2012,"I have to agree with other reviews.. giant portions of 'so-so' food. I wasn't amazed, but I did leave full.  I was kind of disappointed with my ahi tuna.. it didn't have much flavor (the ahi tuna salad is one of the few menu items that is not enormous), but everyone else at the table was pretty happy with their food (giant, overflowing plates of cashew chicken.. at a whopping 1810 calories a plate by the way. It should be good- that's all you get to eat that day) The redeeming quality.. the dessert. My group split a strawberry shortcake and a tiramisu.  The shortcake was less spongy than I've had at other restaurants and tasted more like a cookie.. and it wasn't ridiculously sweet. I liked. And the tiramisu.. well. It was Amazing. Loved. Knocked this place up from 2 stars to 3."
Gregg M.,"Dayton, OH",488,989,1104,4.0,12/24/2010,"For the third year running, three friends from the old neighborhood and I have met over the Christmas holiday at the Cheesecake Factory for our annual reunion.  Cheesecake Factory is a known quantity.  There are no surprises with the food.  The food will be tasty and in portions that will be obscenely-large, but reasonably-priced.  The selections on the menu are likely researched and test-marketed with scientific precision for mass appeal and corporate-approved.  The only variables at a Cheesecake Factory are the crowd and the quality of service. This time around, the crowd for lunch on Christmas Eve was sparse.  Service from Nicholas was solid.  However, I did find one surprise with the food.  The Cheesecake Factory has followed the tapas/small-plate trend and added a page to their phonebook-sized menu with small plate selections.  I had the arugula salad, crispy (read fried) artichoke hearts served with a lemon-garlic aioli, and Vietnamese tacos, a banh mi-style taco with a fluffy flour bun/""shell"".  What can I say?  It wasn't bad at all!  Cheesecake Factory delivers yet again!   I'm sure I'll be back same time, next year."
Howard L.,"Park Ridge, IL",54,1064,9128,4.0,6/3/2011,"All Cheesecake Factories are the same across the country, except Hawaii's which has a slightly different menu I'm told.  That's a good thing, as you should always get a good, generously sized meal and a good deal.  Wife had pork chops and I had the cajun shrimp and chicken linguine.  Both were very good selections from their extensive menu.  Our party of 4 also split a chocolate coconut and banana cream cheesecake, with the BC being the better choice.  Festive and vibrant scene, and excellent service.  Nice to have a reliable, nationwide franchise like CF around."
Pam P.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,39,293,3.0,7/21/2013,"Came here for lunch with Husband & Relatively spry Mother In Law (age 90, tiny little thing) who has a wheeled walker. They don't appear to have space for walkers to ""park"" while the guest is at a table.  The tables are pretty close to each other thus compounding the problem. I didn't see any ""handicap"" tables on a quick survey inside.  The restaurant was relatively full.  The walker sat next to the table like another chair was added.  The guests at the next table had to shimmy to get by it, the tables are that close. The entrees were great as usual for me & husband.   My MIL ordered off of the ""diet"" menu (SkinnyLicious) since she wanted sandwich and salad but NO soup or bread on the side, and that was the only way to order that combo that we found.  She doesn't eat huge portions to begin with. Her mixed greens salad came without any dressing at all on it (she ordered with extra dressing on the side as she always does). We had a waiter in training.  He was accompanied by his trainer.   It seemed long time before they checked on us to realize no dressing at all had been provided.  The trainer handled it when the trainee didn't seem to believe there was no dressing.  Once they did bring dressing, apparently it was a pretty flavorless vineagrette.   She ate half her chicken salad sandwich, which she said was good (and took half home). I had Pasta Da Vinci, he had Pasta Carbonara.  My MIL liked our pasta better than her items to my judgement. We all 3 had cheesecake for desssert, I had plain w/ strawberry topping.  Flavor is awesome but the cheesecake itself seems ""fluffy"".  I'm used to a denser cheesecake I guess. Hubby got one with lots of ""stuff""  like candy pieces & chocolate etc.  A bit sweet for me but he liked.  MIL got key lime and we all liked it as well."
Jared D.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,2,,3.0,1/2/2015,"Not too bad! Better food than other reviewers led me to believe. What was off putting was the chincy plastic glassware, paper napkin under the fries, etc. Presentation was a problem. This establishment would justify its prices if they executed just a little better. Wait staff was fine. Ate at the bar. Chianti was not good, but not the restaurants fault,I don't believe."
Pieter D.,"Berrien Springs, MI",4,16,32,5.0,2/19/2014,It's cheesecake factory. Nuff said. Oh wait... their gluten free menu is extensive. Which was awesome.
Kristin L.,"Plainfield, IN",19,4,,4.0,10/15/2014,"My favorite item has been removed from the menu, so I had the chopped salad which was a bit disappointing- not bad but not impressive. Our server Darby was very attentive and provided excellent service."
Mark V.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,70,98,2.0,1/25/2014,"Well, I had decided for the most part to give up chain restaurants for good.  That is until the company Christmas party.  Guess what?  I won a certificate to Cheesecake Factory, so why not do a review.  Overall, this place is a train wreck, and I have no idea how this place stays in business.  People stop wasting money on garbage like this and find some better places to eat, and save a lot of money in the process.  Just click on my lists of reviews.  I will help you get to better places.   First of all you come in and guys with guns grab your wallet and purse. Take all your cash or charge a huge sum to your credit or debit card.   Ok not literally!   I left there feeling taken advantage of.  Two people could easily spend $60 to $80 and that would be without alcohol.  It was freezing cold so I ordered coffee at $3.00.  Why will people shell out $3.00 for five cent cup of coffee?  I don't understand this is ridiculous to say the least.  (Remember I am working with a gift card and that is the reason I did.  I didn't want any balance left on the card which would force me to come back.)  $2 drinks are crazy, but now places are charging $3 for what a local gas station would charge $.79 for the same thing.   Ordered the pizza at $12 as an appetizer.  It was the best thing I had there but that isn't saying much.  The sausage on the pizza was great.  The mozzarella cheese was fresh and made in house.  However, the crust was limp and doughy and the sauce had no flavor.  I think it was a 10 inch and overpriced in my opinion. Everything was overpriced as I looked through the menu.  I was going to get the fish and chips for $17.00.  I asked the waitress to find out if the fish was fresh or frozen.  The fish is frozen she told me.  $17.00 FROZEN FISH!  I just wanted to get up on my chair and scream to all the customers to get out and start listing all the great local restaurants we have in Indianapolis.  You can charge $17 for fish and chips but you can't use fresh fish. OMG!  I went with the $12 chili rellenos burger.  I am not sure if the burger was fresh or frozen at this point I just wanted to eat and get out of this nightmare.  The burger was nice size but lacked seasoning.  The problem was the chili rellenos on top was a greasy mess and tasted awful.   I have ate really good chili rellenos and this was worst one I have ever had.   You have $1.50 in food cost and charge $12 but you can't even make it good.  I didn't like the fries either and I know those were frozen and came from a bag in the freezer.  No fresh made fries on this $12.00 plate of garbage.      I didn't have the cheesecake on this visit, but I have had it before.  I know people love this, but I think it is just slightly above average and way overpriced at $7-$8 per slice. I have ate much better cheesecake at other restaurants.  Besides, who wants to eat 1000 plus calories for dessert....NOT ME!  Portion size is not an issue as I watched plates come out to the tables, so I can understand a slightly higher price point.  However, mediocre food is still mediocre food regardless of portion size.  This place is for people that have more money than they have common sense.  If you are bored of chain restaurants and think for yourself and are not manipulated by millions of dollars in TV commercials to make yourself believe you have to eat average to below average overpriced food at some chain restaurant, I am one of you.  Let's all keep supporting the true food scene in Indiana."
Tom F.,"Plainfield, IN",0,2,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Brought my daughter here for her 15th birthday and they totally forgot about her! Told them upfront that it was her birthday, and they still blew it. 30 minute wait turned into 53 minutes. Food was ok but they have: terrible wait times, no sweet tea, ridiculous pricing, dark dining room. Caesar salad was covered in dressing and not worth eating after a few bites. Never been here before, and now I know why."
Greg D.,"Rushville, IN",0,4,,1.0,8/3/2015,"Ok, was excited to try Cheescake Factory for the first time. I can't deny it's role in ""Big Bang Theory"" got me interested. In fact, when my wife and I were having trouble deciding where to go, I said, I got it, follow my directions(she's driving). She gave me a funny, but curious look. So off we go. We get to Greenwood Park Mall and says, ""hmmm, have we been here before. I said no and then she guesses Cheescake Factory, because we have been to the Fridays there a dozen times.   We enter, I'm surprised by the size, especially it's ultra-high ceilings. A hostess is right there, she asks how many and I tell her 2, then ask her ""Is there bar seating?"" She replies yes, I ask if we seat ourselves, she says yes and we head that way.(9 times out of 10 we sit in bar areas at places like this-primary reason-no kids around). My wife usually prefers booths and we found an open one and sat down. A waitress shows up promptly and says with a distressed look on her face, ""Did they seat you here""? I reply, ""No, the hostess said it was self-seating in the bar"". The waitress replies, ""only for those sitting at the bar"". (I never hinted to the hostess I was looking for 2 bar stools at the bar). So I explain, ""Oh, this is my first time hear, I didn't understand that. So then, can we sit here?"" She says, ""I guess, but it needs to be wiped down"" in a fairly unfriendly manner. I said, ""That's fine, it just needs a quick wipe"", joking that the ""last people here were pretty clean"".   So, the confusion thing seemed over with, but we waited at least 5 minutes, when I reached the conclusion that between this ladie's attitude and the wait to get a busboy to come wipe our table, this experience might not even get better. (cue in back of mind-""Big Bang Theory"", the episode where Penny screws with Sheldon about sabotaging his food).   So I decide we're leaving. Well, the cheescake display is in front of us and I decide to order a whole cheescake to go(white-chocalate, rasberry truffle- MMMMMM, very, very rich)and this gives me time to ask for a manager.   Manager arrives, I say, ""I'm choosing to not eat hear for lunch today, would you like to know why?"". He does, so I explained how the confusion of which seats are in the ""bar area"" and which seats are not, which seats are ""seat yourself"" and which seats are not, added to a non-friendly reception from the waitress, made me lose faith in the restaurant. He then explained the design of the place, which area was bar and which areas were not (extremely strange set-up, very undefined, kind-of sectioning the bar area off, but kind-of blending the far side of the bar area into the family side). The protocol of the bar/family-side, who seats who thing, was now finally getting clearer.    So then, this has been a little twilight-zoney already, but the first part was nothing. I asked the mangager, ""So, should I return to this restaurant to give it another chance?"" He said, ""Yes, you should"". I say, ""Why? He looked puzzled, apparently nobody had ever asked him for reasons to dine at the restaurant he is managing. He sure didn't have any reasons at the top of his head and gave he this funny look (the only thing it reminds me of is when my kids were little and I had to take one of their bottles away for a second). So then I express my very real questions about eating at a place where the manager can't give me any good reasons to eat there. He starts getting uptight, says I didn't give him a chance. So I say, ""Ok, try again"" and back up a step and put my arm around my wife in a ""I'm ready to listen"" stance. So, he starts out by asking me a question, rehashing the seating thing. So I answer him, but he doesn't let me finish my answer, interrupting me. I said, ""You asked, let ME finish"". He then says, ""You didn't let me finish, you won't give me a chance"". I say, ""No, Sir, I gave you plenty of chances and you failed miserably"".     This could have been the end of it, expect he walked away mumbling, then turned around, walked past me mumbling something. So, I said, ""You know, I understated it, YOU are a failure...as a manager. My advice to you is that you should find an occupation more suited to your skills"". Before I got that out he muttered something else, which prompted me to wrap it up with the phrase, ""You just plain suck at it (managing)"".    Again, the white chocolate rasberry truffle cheesecake was amazing."
Big John D.,"Plainfield, IN",8,18,,1.0,6/15/2015,"The food was good, service was slow, but the cheesecake was odd.  Both my girlfriend and I became really sick within hours."
Diana L.,"Puyallup, WA",0,31,30,5.0,5/20/2015,"The husband and I love coming here on our Friday date nights.  We always sit at the bar since the wait is like 45 min.  Weve been pretry lucky with the bar and usually find seats with 5 to 10 min... the calamari appetizer and miso salmon are really good dishes.  Highly recommend getting your drinks made by the blonde bartender.   Always make the drink perfect.  There is another brunette male bartender who makes pretty good ones too.  We came in earlier one day when a lady bartender made our drinks.  Although she was friendly her drinks werent that great.  Anyway, we still like to go there everytime were back in indiana!"
Michael H.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,34,1,3.0,4/7/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory always has decent food but the prices are a stretch.  We ordered some appetizers, both around $9.00 a pop.  The deep fried macaroni came with four balls, luckily we only had four people and the egg rolls which were pretty good.  I had the soup and salad and I will say the salad did not taste very fresh but I did like the soup.  Oh I had a beer on tap that was very cold which washed down the bad salad.  I like this place, the atmosphere but their prices need to reflect the market."
Thavarin K.,"Decatur Township, IN",60,3,,1.0,8/16/2013,"Had a horrible experience today for carry out. I was treated poorly even after I paid for my meal and even tipped for carry out. Thanks I will avoid this place if you don't want crap treatment and it wasn't even that busy where I could have not gotten help from the 6-7 employees I saw, I had to turn around after finding out I had no plastic forks or knives to go with my CARRYOUT. Most place offer these in the bag, obviously if you dont ask you dont get here from the Cheesecake Factory brand. You pay more here then other places, you would think they would provide these... long story short. Noone helped I waited in car when I was told too and waited well too long in the bright sun, thank you!"
