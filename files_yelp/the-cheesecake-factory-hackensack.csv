Dianna N.,"Pequannock, NJ",39,172,2,4.0,1/9/2018,"I usually hate chain restaurants but I wanted to post what a good experience I had here.  My waiter was a pleasure , very friendly and gave prompt service and great suggestions. I had an Asian pear martini which was delish. Not overly sweet and not too boozy. I really wanted a second one but I was driving. My veggie burger was outstanding. I love the combo of grains and veggies and it was enough for two meals for me! It is something I will certainly be back for! My only complaint is a common one, it is super busy and loud but there is nothing you can do about that ! It's good for a bite while shopping in the mall"
Jessi T.,"Maywood, NJ",286,351,201,4.0,1/6/2018,"Good, ol' reliable Cheesecake Factory.  The food is good, the portions are big, you always know what you're getting.   If you're looking for stability in an unstable world, have a meal at The Cheesecake Factory.  You're going to feel safe, secure and full. I ate here recently after not having eaten here probably since my last review of this place in 2008.  It was great.  The service was nice, the bread still tasted the same, the menu was still mostly the same.  And now that I have a job, the prices don't seem that bad.  Maybe some would see those things as cons but hey, I liked it.  Honestly. The only thing I didn't like is when they went to seat us the table was still dirty and they bum rush cleaned it while we awkwardly stood and waited.  Why tell us the table is ready if it isn't?  Ah, well.  Water under the bridge my Cheesecake Factory.  I'll see you soon."
Cindy F.,"Ridgefield, NJ",165,260,380,1.0,12/28/2017,"I stopped in here to dine at the beginning of December with my mother and 2 children ( 2 1/2 and 7 months old) after taking photos with Santa in the mall. The hostess was horrendous and the manager did NOTHING to compensate us.  First when we entered the hostess told me to stand with my double stroller behind the hostess desk. Which honestly I was just going to ignore. Even though I felt she was trying to hide my double stroller or something. Instead I sat down anyway. To make more room I decided to take one of the detachable seats off the stroller and place it in the car. It took all of 45 seconds, my car was right outside. When I got back my mom said someone came to sit us. I went to hostess desk to inquire. Omg she was the biggest b*#tch. Almost laughing that we were going to be put on the list again. Even after the person who came to sit us came back saying it was okay. At this point we are arguing and I asked to speak to the manager. The girl was pointing and rolling her eyes at me it was completely ridiculous. The manager finally comes and they sit us in the 'bar' section. (Because people sitting in the bar really want to be entertained by my two young children.). The manager apologized but did NOTHING to rectify the situation.  Our waitress was however very nice. My children go to restaurants all the time and are always well behaved. This was my first time dining at this Cheesecake Factory since they moved locations in the mall. I will not be back. Which is sad because I frequented this restaurant when pregnant with my son."
Jenny K. L.,"Oradell, NJ",166,489,472,2.0,12/14/2017,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this place. It's my favorite chain restaurant for every type of meal, and since they moved to a larger location, I've been going even more often. However!!! Door Dash has changed our lives.  They are wonderful.  However, the take out/delivery experience at Cheesecake when it comes to the packaging of the food is always sub par at best.  The quantity and quality of food is significantly less and there seems to always be a little something missing.  For example this time they forgot our bread, which I was looking forward to to lap up the sauce on my chicken Romano which has quickly become my favorite entree here."
ToniAnn D.,"Maywood, NJ",189,115,137,4.0,10/1/2017,"I used to be the biggest fan of Cheesecake Factory, but It faded. They have a extensive menu and the best cheesecakes, but every time I go I never know what to get lol. Probably because the menu offers So much. I must say, I always get the same usual things: the skinnylicous salmon, the chicken Romano, or Santa Ve chicken sandwich- all great options. I also love that they serve the best warm and soft bread when you sit down. It's definitely a perk of eating here! For dessert, you have to get the cheesecake! That's a given. Some of my favorites include the Oreo, s'mores, snickers, & the plain strawberry. I've had many things on their menu and everything is always good. Some people find them pricey but they do serve big portions, so there's room for left overs !"
Belle D.,"Dumont, NJ",444,60,72,4.0,9/22/2017,"My family came here on a Sunday night for my parent's anniversary. Since we all have different food preferences, Cheesecake Factory is always a great place for us since they have a very extensive menu. I ordered the turkey burger and was in love. The garlic aioli was such a perfect pair for the burger. My sister ordered her go to item, the Louisiana chicken pasta. The food has always been consistent through my numerous visits. For dessert, we ordered the Oreo and the coffee cheesecakes. Both were delicious and very rich, so they're both best paired with coffee. I was surprised that the chocolate cake layer on the coffee cheesecake was very dense, almost brownie-like. Either way, it was a perfect way to end our meal. The service seemed subpar - the waiter took 15 minutes before he was able to even greet us, but he apologized saying there was an issue with the credit card machine. Overall, great place for dinner, especially for large groups."
Dor I.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",4,9,7,1.0,12/17/2017,"If I could put no stars, I would. 45 minutes to get drinks. Unbelievable/unreal. The waiter was no where to be found so we couldn't even tell anyone that we were waiting. Very unpleasant experience. The place is extremely hot and without drinks we were definitely getting dehydrated. Still, no drinks. We got appetizers but no drinks. We asked the food runner and he said that he will check. No drinks for another 20 minutes. We got the food, again no drinks on the table. We again told the food runner that we were waiting for the drinks, but he ran away like he couldn't care less. We have food but no drinks. I'm not gonna say anything else about this place, use your judgement. [we asked for plates-we got dirty ones; see picture]"
Rohit S.,"Dumont, NJ",8,73,201,3.0,8/29/2017,"My last few visits have not been so swell, but today was an exception. Everything was going fantastic till the entrees (which needed an inordinate amount of time to prepare- NOT WORTH THE WAIT) came into the picture. Nevertheless, let's discuss the good before the bad. The Pina Coladas were great! The starters (both new to my taste buds) were exceptional.  I wish we had gotten up and left prior to the following events. The chicken parm-pizza style pasta was a disaster (Ah! What a mess). The texture is hard to put into words; it was grainy and chewy. Besides, I ate so much bread waiting for the arrival of my entree I could not fit only but a few bites."
Carlos C.,"Newark, NJ",79,106,103,3.0,10/26/2017,"Food was okay but the best part of dinner was the service and the cheesecake. Our server Malcom was fantastic and a very cool dude. We were greeted promptly with water and bread, and our waters were always refilled. The s'mores cheesecake was outstanding. The texture was silky and not too chocolaty, well balance with marshmallow and graham crackers with a dollop of whipped cream."
jason K.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,63,2,2.0,1/2/2018,"The quality of the food was poor at this location. I suspect there is lack of oversight in the kitchen.  After disappointing food, I looked through yelp and found a significant number of bad reviews for this place.  I think management needs to urgently get to the bottom of the problem and figure out why the food coming out of the kitchen isn't at  par with  other Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The food feels un-fresh, not expertly cooked and flavors are off."
Elaine C.,"New York, NY",36,16,13,3.0,12/3/2017,"Fried chicken and waffles!!  The brunch was ok and I had a mimosa to accompany my food.  Unfortunately, you can only be served a mimosa after 12p.  Although you can still order from the regular menu,  I decided to be daring and try their brunch menu for kicks!  The portion was perfect, but for the price you pay I expected a little more.  Maybe I'll give it another try!!"
Jewel Y.,"New York, NY",120,759,3318,5.0,10/25/2017,"I almost never Yelp about the waiter but I gotta give big kudos to our waiter Angel, thanks for being so accommodating and making our dining experience so pleasant tonight!!! He made up for our not so great last visit, in which we were hardly getting any attention from our waitress perhaps due to our table location (outside facing the indoor shops) and she didn't look very happy working there. In contrast with the last server, Angel was super attentive, made sure we were happy with everything and maintained a very positive and friendly attitude throughout our dinner, which was very refreshing to see. I can see he enjoys his job and takes pride in what he does, which is so rare to see these days... nowadays too often we encounter unfriendly service and I wish more waiters would smile more just like this waiter Angel. We were observing him and we were impressed how hard he was working so I decided to ask his name, so that I can surprise him by mentioning him in my review. I come here quite often but I must say he was the best server I've ever had at Cheesecake Factory. Excellent customer service and big smile go a long way, please keep it up!"
Alice M.,"Cresskill, NJ",141,1,1,5.0,12/30/2017,"Came here at around 930 PM and the greeter told us the wait time would be twenty minutes but we were seated in less than ten. Our server, Angel, was very polite and checked in multiple times throughout the course of the meal and made it an overall very enjoyable experience. Will definitely be coming back for more."
Anne S.,"Paramus, NJ",0,11,7,1.0,12/26/2017,"This review is solely based on the food experience. I would give ZERO stars if I could.  It was my family's first time at The Cheesecake Factory after they reloacted to the other side of the mall but if I can turn back time, I wouldn't have gone there.  The food was inedible and I still cannot believe that the food came to our table in the condition that it did. Our family went on Christmas Eve around brunch time, probably a bad idea for future reference.  The food took FOREVER to come out, although the restaurant itself didn't seem as packed as it would be on a usual Sunday brunch time.  When the food came out, the server informed me that the plate was VERY hot, so becareful.  At first glance, the food looked ok.  I had ordered a meatloaf, took a bite and it had a burnt taste so I looked at the dish more carefully and I saw that all four outer sides of the meatloaf was burnt.  Our waiter came to check on us and I told him that my meatloaf is a bit burnt.  He asked if we wanted anything else to replace my dish but I declined since we waited so long for our meal to come out and told him I'll just eat around it.  I took a bite of the mashed potato that came with my meatloaf and it was quite cool and the outer part was some what hard - almost as if it had been sitting out for a while.  I then tried to eat the ""unburned"" part of my meatloaf by trying to cut the burnt sides off of it and flipped the meatloaf around only to find a disgustingly burnt meatloaf on the othter side.   I wanted to speak to the manager at this point so we were waiting to flag down our waiter.  Our 10 month old baby was getting fussy while all this was going on so I tried to give him some pancake from one of my kid's dish.  I grabbed the pancake with my hands and I felt a hard, crunchy texture - almost like a toast! I flipped the pancake over and that too was burnt! Our waiter finally came around and we told him we NEED to speak with the manager.  He was more than willing to get the manager so we waited.  While we were waiting, my husband and I were questioning all of our food so we took a bite from the other kid's dish - spaghetti and meatball.  My kid is 2 years old and he was just happy to finally eat his food so he was just digging in but when we took a bite, the pasta had a rubbery texture and the pasta was all clumped together.  Five minutes later, a chef or a cook wearing a cook's uniform came to our table.  I showed him my dish, and explained that my child's pancake was burnt and that he should try grabbing it to feel it himself.  I also told him the spaghetti is either undercooked or it was sitting out too long because it has a rubbery texture.  He looked at our food and told us that the meatloaf and pancake is definitely burnt and apologized.  He asked if we would like something else to replace our dish, but we declined and told him we just want to pay for our drinks and one ""edible"" dish that we barely touched because of everything that was going on.  The chef/cook left and our waiter came to the table and informed us that the bill had been waived so we didn't need to pay anything.  My children were still cranky so my husband had to goto Smashburger across the mall from The Cheesecake Factory to get some burgers for them.  I'm just sorry to my three little children who had to spend an hour at the restaurant without having a proper meal and I'm sorry for myself for losing my appetite and I'm sorry to my husband that our meal was a disaster.  I'm also sorry for our waiter who had to get the chef/cook and apologize on behalf of the cook who cooked or tried to cook that food for us to eat.  If I could, I would like to see that person try to eat the food that was sent out."
Christopher D.,"Lodi, NJ",255,342,2303,3.0,5/30/2017,"As I am typing my review,  I am tasting the sweet plantains from my order that was surprisingly good at my desk at work. Lol  I've been here plenty of times but it has been a while. My recent visit was yesterday with the fam per their request. There was 45 minute wait but we were seated in about 30 minutes which was a world record for me coming to Cheesecake Factory establishments so off to a good start.  Our waitress was pretty attentive and very energetic in a good way. She went a head and took our drink orders as we were still deciding of what to eat. As we got our drinks, we went ahead and ordered our meals. I ordered the Jamaican Shrimp with black beans and rice and plantains. I was expecting a mediocre dish at best based on previous experiences lol but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised it had a decent flavor and tasted pretty good. My daughter ordered the Four Cheese Pasta. which she enjoyed but I tasted it and was not impressed at all. I didn't taste 4 cheeses and the flavor was bland to average.My son had the Mac N Cheeseburger which he enjoyed and the fries it came with tasted very good. He crushed it. Kids both ordered cheese cake slices which of course is the one thing they do have that's pretty Damm amazing lol and earned the right to be called Cheesecake Factory. I am not a big cheesecake person but I have to admit I like their cheesecake's in particular.  Overall listen it is a huge Chain spot and the food is okay you pay more for the name than the overall quality in my opinion. The sister company Grand Lux Cafe to me has way better food quality. I would recommend this place if you are a true Cheesecake fan because that they do extremely well no doubt about it. Kids were happy which is all that matters I guess lol."
Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,62,15,4.0,10/27/2017,"Couldn't believe this was my first time coming to Cheesecake Factory. The menu was huge as it took me a long time to order a meal. Finally I decided to have white rice with orange chicken and it was delicious. Sat outside as it was a nice night and the service was also good. Staff was very helpful as they gave suggestions for different meals they felt I should try. With a menu like what they have, I would definitely come back so that I can eventually try everything. Also the cheesecake they had was good."
Nichole S.,"South Hackensack, NJ",169,80,33,4.0,6/27/2017,"I opted to come here after a very long hiatus - and didn't even realize they moved locations within the same mall square. My friend had recently mentioned the Cheesecake Factory and I decided I needed me some oversized portions for a good price.  I was seated immediately and my server was a little slow but nice nonetheless. I knew exactly what I wanted due to my extensive research during work hours- shhh. Anyways I ordered the chicken Riesling dish- but customized it with crispy chicken instead of that grilled nonsense. It added the perfect texture against the rich and creamy mushrooms and bacon with buttered pasta. It lacked a little seasoning but I was able to counteract that with the salt and pepper provided on the tables. I was extremely satisfied with my choice so I decided to try dessert as well.  I have been craving carrot cake for a while now so that's what I went it. The cake itself was moist and tender, the cream cheese filling was pleasant. All in all it was a very good dinner."
James C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",2,6,1,1.0,10/11/2017,"If you want to enjoy foods, then find other place. Maybe cheese cake only, but really???"
Andrew D.,"Teaneck, NJ",96,82,40,1.0,10/24/2017,"Ok Here goes...  Our servers name Edward M. Probably the most boring server I have EVER encountered. Absolutely no sense of urgency and no personality. Def a desperate hire for Cheesecake Factory.  Here was the biggest issue. Our appetizers came at the exact same time as our entrees. The server warned us, but did not attempt any guest recovery! He offered a free cheesecake? Servers don't have any authorization to provide comped items for guests. Instead of sending a manager over, we had to request for one to explain the situation. There is no reason for us to pay for these appetizers. The whole point of ordering an appetizer is defeated.  Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience. I've had much better service. This is def an experience to share with more social applications."
Inder K.,"Morristown, NJ",119,2,,1.0,12/16/2017,"This is probably the worst service we have experienced in a while. The waiter was inattentive, too slow, got the wrong order and unapologetic. I love their food but the service makes me never want to come back."
Eunice Y.,"New York, NY",5,84,82,1.0,10/7/2016,"I haven't been to Cheesecake factory for a while and I was so excited about it until this happened.  I ordered mojito and I found not only dirt on mint leaves but also an ALIVE WORM.. First of all, you guys clearly did not wash leaves at all and second of all.. alive worm!!! come on.. so disgusting........ totally ruined my appetite. not coming back here :("
Jenny Y.,"Palisades Park, NJ",301,62,127,4.0,5/1/2017,"My friend and I came for lunch on a Thursday and it was surprisingly busy! The host offered indoor or outdoor seating, but we chose to go to the bar because we were in a slight crunch for time and bar service is usually quicker. Our bartender was really nice, forgot his name but made me a pretty weak Long Island Iced Tea. It came in a huge glass but tasted like too much sour mix... I'm a 102 pound girl 5 feet tall, I usually feel tipsy off one glass of wine....sooo... don't know what happened there. It was kind of difficult to get his attention, even though we were the only bar guests there. He was preoccupied stocking and cleaning or whatever and paid little attention to us. I ended up sucking down my drink like a lemonade and enjoyed my meal, regardless. The Sheila Salad definitely brings this review back up to 4 stars because it was phenomenal! Food came fast and hot, delicious and perfect!  I love the interior of this particular Cheesecake. It's very open, so you're not confused about where the bathroom is, where to find your table after you use the bathroom, where the indoor dining, bar area, and outdoor seating is. And most conveniently, it's part of the Riverside Mall, right next to Barnes and Nobles."
Rusheida A.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,11,3,1.0,10/24/2017,Worst service ever! Server name was Edward M. He really didn't care nor did he provide any type of great guest service. Everything was beyond mediocre. It's sad because Cheesecake Factory usually has some amazing servers. What happened to the hiring process here? If you do go to this location avoid EDWARD M at all costs. He needs to be EDUCATED about hospitality.
Silvino P.,"Manhattan, NY",319,103,609,3.0,3/22/2017,"The food wasn't bad but for the amount I had for the amount I paid for, it was too expensive. Ended up paying about 23.00 bucks for steak that added up to 3oz and a chicken breast that was probably 3oz as well. Food was actually good and that's why I have them 3 stars but the size of the portions could be a little bigger(chicken Madeira and steak Diane)"
Carlos Q.,"NJ, NJ",90,56,193,3.0,5/13/2017,"Decor: nice cheesecake atmosphere, 4 stars Service: well trained staff and large menu, 4 stars Food: I like the wide variety cheesecake always offers so anyone can find whatever they like. The food is always alright. 3 stars"
Emily C.,"Rutherford, NJ",444,74,89,4.0,9/7/2017,I don't care what anyone says...I'll always love The Cheesecake Factory!! I like the food here and portions are always super large. I personally think the lunch sizes are more reasonable but we don't always have time to sit here for lunch. Love their pasta dishes and the stuffed mushroom. Service was slow when we came. This specific restaurant is clean and spacious. The bathrooms are always clean too. There's outdoor seating but not much of a view since it's literally in front of a big parking lot.  The best deal for The Cheesecake Factory is when they give you free slices of cheesecake when you purchase a $25 gift card around Christmas time (buy it and use it on yourself!) or when it's Cheesecake Day and all their cheesecakes are half off.
Catherine Edre B.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",27,1,,1.0,10/9/2017,"My first review on yelp, mainly because i had a bad experience with this restaurant. I ordered on the phone for pick up, a margarita pizza, chix Alfredo, chopped salad and two cheesecakes. Said 25 mins, okay sounds reasonable.  I Come in after 25 mins to pick it up, they already charged me for it, so I thought maybe the food was ready. Waited for quite sometime only to find out that my food was just waiting in the kitchen to be picked up. First of all, don't charge a customer whose order is not even ready to begin with and has to wait for 20 mins to get it. Now, I get my food finally and I check it out and the Pasta they used was penne instead of linguini. I didn't ask for it, and it looked like slop. Manager was there and I asked him if it normally comes like this, he then apologizes and I changed it to angel hair. Waited again for another 30 mins, all for a corrected Alfredo. It has been an hour that I've been waiting. They couldn't even communicate to rush it. Finally the guy in the counter saw me and tried to rush my order from the back. I finally got it and didn't even bother to check it.  Now comes the tasting part. The pizza, as you expect, was already cold. It was a bit undercooked too. I can still taste some raw pizza dough. Sauce was good tho. The salad was okay, had balsamic vina. The only bad part was the chicken, it was one of the leftover ones you get from the slicer. The end pieces of the chicken. They didn't bother to chop that. The two cheesecakes were good, as expected. But the damn Alfredo, was a disaster. The sauce was not even seasoned, along with the chicken they use. It was like eating reduced heavy cream with just a touch of parm. Horrible, so horrible. I can't believed I payed for that slop.  Just come here for the Cheesecakes, that's it. Everything else, just a big N-O. NO."
Jacqueline G.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,20,,3.0,1/2/2018,"To start off, I really love The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is big offering all different types of food and I've never gotten a meal I didn't love. I've been here twice since they moved to the other side of the mall, most recently yesterday, 1/1/2018, with my sister after a little New Year shopping. One thing that baffles me is why, when rebuilding, they didn't open the foyer area up more. You come in and are given a pager and told your wait time and then after it goes off you wait some more on the other side of the hostess stand. I don't mind waiting & always come prepared to wait because I understand the high demand of this place however waiting on top of strangers in heavy coats is frustrating since they just redid this place and had the chance to fix it. Moving on - we were seated, given menus and soon realized it was going to take our waitress awhile to get to us as another table next to us was flagging down other servers trying to find her. I'm assuming she had another section to wait on since I rarely saw her in the area, which is fine but if you're going to give a server two sections try to make them somewhat near each other that way she can easily check on both. Eventually she came over and took our drink order, which, thank God because between shopping and the wait, I was thiiiiirsty. I got the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta from the Skinnylicious menu and my sister got the Mac n Cheese Burger. I love the Skinny menu because I usually order apps (all time FAVORITE is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - GET THEM) and can still order a meal and not feel like I can't breathe after. My sister asked to sub out regular fries for sweet potato ones and was told that's fine however when the food was brought out the woman delivering it said ""Oh yeah we don't have any more sweet potato fries so we gave you regular fries is that ok?"" Not having an item is no big deal but bringing the food out and THEN asking if that's ok when its already in front of the patron? Maybe next time take the time to come out and actually ask if there's another side she may want instead. Besides that, everything got devoured pretty quickly and afterwards we ordered a piece of our go-to Dulce de Leche cheesecake to share. Fluffy, sweet heaven is the best way to describe any of the desserts here so always try to save room. Overall, I know I'll be back because I genuinely enjoy the food - just not those few minor issues."
Michelle I.,"Wayne, NJ",244,5,,5.0,11/7/2017,Ate dinner at the new renovated Cheesecake Factory . Atmosphere is great and the service was better . Angel was attentive and sincere . Great experience !
Scott W.,"New York, NY",31,24,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Other Yelpers hit it spot on! Came here for a casual Sunday Brunch and while the food for fine the service was not. From start to finish we had a terrible experience, from needing to ask for water each and every time to plates and glasses not being clean up. I am not sure management actually cares about the business. Each time it took so long that we needed to ask where the drinks were, where the appetizers were and where the entrees were. We got our 2nd round of drinks only after we asked another server to check on it and after we finished our meals, clearly someone forgot to place in the order. This is a management issue, they are clearly either understaffed or untrained.  We paid our bill and told the manager our comments but outside of a few rehearsed ""sorry"" lines, he walked away. Given that its owned by the same parent company with similar menus go down the road to to Grand Lux. The management team actually wants your business. Yelpers I encourage you to not only leave your comments but speak with you wallet and go to a different spot. Only when this location feels it on their P/L do they have incentive to change. Don't pay full price for a fraction of the service."
Michael L.,"Carlstadt, NJ",1,39,5,2.0,7/18/2017,My wife likes this place but every time i agree to go to this place it keeps on getting  worse. The management is to blame here. I believe it's the lack of experience and not aware what's going on in the restaurant. They think just because the customer is seated their job is over. Wrong guys and gals ..... you need to walk to the floor and see wHrs going on at the tables and all the customers waiting for their food. Offer a refill of their soda ask the customers if everything is ok . The place is so disorganized and everyone is running around doing nothing . Last time I am coming to this place .
Frank H.,"Pompton Plains, NJ",0,30,319,3.0,9/24/2017,Typical Cheesecake Factory but newer.  Always crowded and NO WIFi??  Really??  Make the kids wait 40 mins for a meal how about some internet since there are not seats most of the time
Patrick D.,"Chesterfield, VA",1,208,66,3.0,4/6/2017,"Food was excellent, but service was VERY lacking.  I've eaten a lot of places, but this was actually my first trip to The Cheesecake Factory. I was very happy with my meal, as was my wife, but server was lacking. He was probably having an ""off"" night, but he didn't smile, talk much or check our table often. That was a disappointment.  We waited a long time from being seated to getting drinks. A long time waiting to have our order taken, and a very long time to order dessert. So long that we asked to see a manager. He was kind and comped desserts and also took our tea and soda off the check. From ordering to receiving our entrees was not bad at all.  That was a review saver, because without that the service was so bad - it could have been only 2 stars."
Dorothy T.,"Ridgewood, NJ",7,3,,2.0,7/1/2017,"First time at the new location - disappointed. Had guests from out of town - arrived at 8:25 finally got a table at 9:45. 20 minutes later got order taken. After another 15 minutes one of the wrong drinks arrived. An hour later at around 10:45 food arrived. One of the dishes that should have had chicken arrived without chicken. Manager says ""did you want chicken in that"" - seriously.  I know it's not the Ritz and it's a Saturday night but come on."
Jackie M.,"Montclair, NJ",84,27,38,4.0,8/12/2017,Great food! We've been here many times and at their new location (at the other side of the small mall). The staff is attentive. Service on point. It does get really busy a lot. Hopefully you get a good waiter. BE ready to enjoy a delicious loaded meal. :). A tip: please get those yummy Factory nachos! Hahaha all time favorite!
Mikhail V.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",20,273,209,3.0,3/7/2017,It's a decent representative of the chain.  Nothing more nothing less.  The place matches every other Cheesecake Factory out there.  Large in a busy mall with large amount of food traffic and large menu to compliment its largeness. The only problem with the large menu is that the food becomes hit or miss proposition for the patrons.  Depending on the time of the day the day of the week and the chef running the kitchen today but if you're looking to come to a place fancier than let's say Panera Bread then this place is for you and it the choices are going to be the same across the various places in the chain. One good thing that I do have to note is that the kids love their cheesecakes.
Alex S.,"Paramus, NJ",33,110,129,5.0,3/9/2017,"It's a very good restaurant with good service and delicious food. I don't understand some people leaving a negative review with reasons like ""didn't service me right away"" or ""didn't seat me the second I came in"" and so on. I'm regular here and never had any problem.  Fresh food all the time, great drinks and excellent servie"
Missy S.,"New York, NY",502,215,142,4.0,11/27/2016,"This place consistently delivers quality lunch at the mall. What else could you really expect or ask for? Service is great. Atmosphere is good for any size party and the menu could accommodate any human any or every day of the year, as it is so varied. Salads, sandwiches, burgers, and apps are all solid choices. Portions are gigantic, so be sure to share or be ready to be stuffed and take something home.  Note: anything not on the skinny menu has SUPER high calories. So proceed at your own risk and/or share appropriately.  Four stars because it is reliable, consistent high quality (mall) food.  Best dishes: Thai lettuce wraps Any of the salads on the skinnny or non skinny menu Burgers Cuban sandwich Enjoy. And yes of course, the cheesecake is light, fluffy, and bangin'. But best off for your health if you skip it altogether. Not so tough considering how full you'll be anyway. Oh what the heck, be bad, share a slice. Hit the gym later."
Daniel H.,"Rutherford, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/8/2017,I went to The Cheesecake Factory tonight was very disappointed with the food and the waitress service the food came out very cold. The waitress was not attentive whatsoever did not come by and asked if we wanted anything while we were waiting nor when we got food asked us if we wanted anything else refills on our cold drinks or cocktails did not bring out any kind of condiments when going up to the manager of the restaurant explaining what went on she did not do any kind of compensation on the bill or to buy us a cup of coffee or dessert very disappointing on this manager do not recommend this place to anybody for poor mismanagement and poor service and food quality coming out cold prices were high especially from Cheesecake Factory which is nothing special whatsoever which has dim lighting where you can't even see the food menu which is horrible you don't even know what you are ordering and less use your cell phone to see their menu very sad maybe they were thinking you're on a romantic date LOL but how can you be a romantic date when they have music cranking when you can't even hear yourself think it's so loud very poor establishment do not recommend whatsoever 1 stars from me Dan H
Pamela M.,"Manhattan, NY",4,148,90,4.0,5/8/2017,Always without fail takes me back to my college days. The Cajun jambalaya pasta is always my favorite. And cheesecakes are great. Can't ever decide on what to get!
