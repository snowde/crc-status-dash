Michael O.,"North Bergen, NJ",1,44,4,5.0,1/15/2015,"I came here for lunch with my family and we loved it. It is located in a very well kept 5 star mall with high end stores. I had the Crusted Chicken Romano with pasta and it was spot on perfect. The others had salmon and chicken teriyaki and they said it was the best they ever had. We then got two slices of cake: Chocolate cheesecake with Tuxedo Cream and a slice of Red velvet - both were outstanding. The coffee was really good too. Our waiter Mike was on point and never missed a beat.  The wait was short [about 20 min] and well worth it. I recommend that you come here for a late lunch to avoid the busy crowds at night. After you eat, walk around the mall and go to the trendy furniture store Arhaus - very cool place to visit."
Gabriel G.,"Leonia, NJ",132,177,169,3.0,11/25/2014,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. Same vaulted high ceilings, same booth style, same items on the menu, same taste, and same (over)price.  I will say one thing though, and that is that the portions are excessive. I ordered a salad which turned out to be enough for 3 people.  Nothing is ever really bad here, but sadly nothing is ever good. Cheesecake factory is the safe choice. You always know what to expect, and you can be very confident that your (moderate) expectations will be met."
Harvey A.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",252,207,336,5.0,9/9/2012,"I've been loving this Cheesecake Factory for years. Let me put it another way - since the Thai Lettuce Wrap app was $9.99, but is now $12.99. That's awhile.  To fully appreciate the Cheesecake Factory you need to follow a few tips:  1) Sit in the bar area - it's less noisy and crowded, has more efficient service, and TVs for sports. 2) The menu is humongous, so let your server help - figure out what you're in the mood for and let the server make recommendations. You'll save lots of time and energy. 3) Portions are large, so share apps and don't eat all of your meal - otherwise you won't have room for cheesecake. 4) Get cheesecake! But first carefully look over your options by going to the cheesecake display counter and fully peruse the selections. It's life changing. Then consult the expert - your server. It really helps. You'll learn stuff.  If you follow these simple tips you'll have a fun, enjoyable, entertaining, tasty, interesting, and fulfilling dining experience. If you don't you'll over eat and feel stuffed, uncomfortable, have no room for cheesecake (but you'll get it and eat it anyway) and then you'll fall asleep in your car and get in trouble with your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend and/or weight watcher group leader. GO THERE! but follow the rules. You'll all be thanking me later :-)"
David M.,"Union City, NJ",20,6,,1.0,8/29/2015,Came here for a Birthday dinner waitress was nice but food took forever 2 managers came to apologize for the wait we got our food it wasn't what we ordered for one of us so had to wait again for the correct dish to come out and now my dish is cold waiting for hers I haven't been here in 11 years and for good reason just don't do it and if your in here reading this please leave now .
Besaida M.,"Glen Rock, NJ",31,15,4,2.0,6/27/2015,"Was thinking if I should send this review or not when we visited a couple of weeks ago, but it's always a good idea to give your opinion on your own experiences. Might help others. So here goes: I went with some friends for dinner and our disappointment started when our waitress took forever to come over to our table. (By forevever I mean about 15 minutes to bring us our menus.) Without a hello, the waitress said, ""I'll be back to take your order."" Umm, can we order some drinks first? Guess not because she walked away and came back about 10 minutes later, she didn't say hello; just asked for our order. My friend said hello and asked her for her name, and she said ""Cece."" She quickly said, ""what can I get you."" Let me just say, she was not a nice, welcoming waitress. She was full of attitude and we couldn't understand why?! but wow, our experience just got worse. My fries came cold and sadly were burnt. I ordered just some juice and it came warm, no ice. Thankfully, our friends liked their drinks but told us their food was ""ok."" Our waitress just seem not to want to serve us even though she constantly checked on the table across from us. Huh?  Employees will make or break your business and it can effect how customers view the place and the food they eat. The evening was dissapointing and embarrassing as our friends were from out of town. And omg how I glorified this place to them. Would recommend to those who can handle waitresses with bad customer service. EEEK. Hopefully this doesn't happen often at the Cheesecake Factory."
Jayniece M.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,3,3.0,1/30/2015,"My bf treated me to dinner here and I found hair in my food. BLONDE hair! The customer service sucks here, I also celebrated my birthday here in Dec and the food was horrible. My food was cold and my drinks were blah. I would go to any other location but this one."
Sasha F.,"Teaneck, NJ",6,37,35,2.0,12/5/2015,"I'm not really a fan.i went here a couple of times and had bad experiences both times. The first time the food gave me a tummy ache and the second time, they got my order wrong and didn't even budge to fix it. I just had to take what I got. I won't be going back"
Edward L.,"Palisades Park, NJ",26,26,,3.0,12/27/2014,"Only saying 3 stars, due to the price of these foods. I can only afford these foods on a special occasion. If they were cheaper even for college students and college student discounts. I wouldn't mind coming to this place on a weekly basis than an annual basis."
Rene H.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,6,11,1.0,1/15/2017,"Just left this place and I had to make a review. This is the second time I've ate here and I cannot believe how horrible the food and drinks were. Me and my boyfriend arrived here around 8:30 and were seated immediately. We ordered our drinks and apps within the first 10 minutes of sitting down and thought that was a good sign. WRONG. My first shot of patron came out, it was small but I didn't mind and drank it anyway. The first app came out, it was just ok not very hot but we didn't complain, it took 45 minutes for the second app to arrive and it came out cold!!! We asked our server (who was so sweet) to send it back and he did with no issue. I then ordered a second shot of patron, do you know this shot came out in a dirty glass?! I did not complain, I simply poured it into the first glass I had and took the shot, to my surprise, it was WATER!!!! Now I am livid, I called over a random server and told her about my drink and she didn't seem surprised at all. She took it away and our original sever came back with a new drink. How is this normal?? What if I didn't notice?! What if I poured it into my juice on the side?! I was still going to be charged 11 dollars for liquor that was not even there smh!!! Our dinner came out a little while later,which was extremely mediocre. I will never be going back to this place. 109 dollars down the drain, I am so disappointed in this establishment"
Christine A.,"Ramsey, NJ",0,54,,1.0,4/29/2016,We had a horrific experience last night at this location . We asked for a steak with no sauce no seasonings for my 2 kids and it came with sauce. Sent it back and it came back with cracked black pepper. Sent it back and asked for cheeseburgers which came out so late that we asked for them to wrap it up. My shrimp dish and my husbands tuna dish both were saturated in black pepper. They used to be so much better and we were so disappointed mostly for the kids that they didn't get to enjoy their dinner. I hope you guys pull yourselves together .
Virginia T.,"Dumont, NJ",156,314,264,5.0,3/14/2013,"One of my absolute favorite places to go to! Drinks are fab and every single dish i have ever ordered has never failed! All are great! Wings, avocado rolls (apps) buffalo chicken blasts, calamari, the jamaican shrimp dish, chicken and biscuits, louisiana chicken pasta dish, all salads and cheesecakes are delish! Note: if you dont like crowded, noisy places then you may want to try this place during the week because it gets very crowded weekends and wait is quite long around dinnertime."
Elys V.,"West Orange, NJ",27,2,,3.0,9/9/2015,"I am not discouraging people from coming here but just know that you must come with lots of patience for the shortcomings of the staff. However if you speak Spanish then just ask the bus boy or girl for spoons, napkins basic cutlery to eat and that way you won't be so upset on having to wait for the waiter to figure it out. Food is okay and plentiful. Very relaxed atmosphere."
Angie A.,"Bronx, NY",1,8,2,5.0,12/28/2014,I swear I only go here for the avocado eggrolls. They're the bomb! and that tamarind cilantro sauce it comes with is my weakness. The Marsala chicken dish is also good and they're star berry lemonade heaven. The wait is always so long though. Whenever I go there's always at least an half an hour wait. Good news is that you can wait by the bar and order some apps while you wait. Definitely recommend this place. Everything is so tasty. There menu is huge! They serve Everything from Italian to Tai to Mexican... Can't go wrong with this place.
Ksenia G.,"Fort Lee, NJ",7,48,3,1.0,6/14/2015,"I've been to this place at least twenty times. I never thought anything of it, it was just on of those chain restaurants that I would go to if I happened to be around, hungry and nothing better came to my mind. However, after what happened last night, I will never ever go back there again. Ever! So there were 10 or 12 of us. Sure enough they don't take reservations. We got there before 7pm and were asked to wait so we ended up at the bar. We were all starving so after getting a few drinks some of us got a little drunk and one person was louder than he should have been. One of the custumers at the bar commented in a rude manner asking for us to keep it down. The drunk one out of us decided it was a good idea to become louder. I get it, he was wrong! As a result another guy at the bar started a verbal fight with him. The manager showed up asked if our group  could leave. We were there for almost two hours waiting for a table!!!!! All we needed was to get sited and get food! One person in our group was pregnant, another one was a nurse after a long shift at the hospital and overall we were a normal group of  people of our age. We just needed to get some food into the system. DO NOT go there with big groups. Terrible management!! They ruined my night!"
Natalie E.,"Queens Village, NY",171,193,3,4.0,7/28/2014,"After all these years, I still have my to go to place as Cheescake Factory....  I don't know why but something about it draws me in.... Is it the huge portions that I can take home and enjoy for 2 meals? Is it the vast amounts of cheesecakes and desserts calling my name..... or perhaps the way I can customize my lousiana chicken pasta with angel hair with extra sauce mmmmmmm The prices are decent for the portion sizes. I feel the apps are a bit higher priced but they are yummy. Cant wait till my next cheesecake venture."
Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",878,671,797,3.0,2/16/2014,"Ahh, the Cheesecake Factory. As long as I have living relatives, I am sure the road of my life will always lead to a Cheesecake Factory somewhere in the country. My family, and my wife's family, and most peoples' families I know, all have a special place in their heart for the Cheesecake Factory. Me, well? Not so much. I mean, as far as chain restaurants go, you can definitely get a decent meal here. Half the battle is navigating the menu, which is like a yellow pages, complete with ads and local promotions sprinkled throughout. I am a firm believer that the more items on the menu, the less spectacular the food. The Cheesecake Factory bucks that trend ever so slightly, for with literally 100+ items to choose from, you'd flat-out expect all the food to suck by my formula. But the food is OK. I have yet to find something on the menu that would give me cause to give them more than three stars, but you could certainly do worse eating elsewhere. Here's what I think MY perfect Cheesecake Factory scenario would be:   It's been a long day, say, having attended a bourbon festival with friends for hours on end. We've just gotten done telling our driver that for all the booze they had at the festival, there wasn't much food to eat, and now we're starving. And, of course we all have both feet in the bag. As we drive down the highway, we spy a Cheesecake Factory, and ask the driver to make a stop. In an unusual twist of fate, we are pleasantly surprised to find there is no wait for a table. In fact, not only is there no wait, there are no screaming children to be found anywhere. Still, we decide to eat at the bar. Once sat, we get a few more adult beverages, and then proceed to order *EVERYTHING* on the appetizer menu. We stumble out full, accompanied by the sound of our arteries hardening, and proceed back to the limo for the long ride home. We are happy. Very, very happy. We'll have to try that some time. Maybe a 4-star review isn't completely out of reach under the proper circumstances..."
Ileidi M.,"Magnolia Park, Miami, FL",11,23,16,5.0,9/1/2014,"Love love love the food and love the staff. Walter, our waiter, was phenomenal and went above and beyond for us. Can't wait to come back."
Michael L.,"Waldwick, NJ",48,358,136,2.0,8/7/2012,"Great cheesecake, scrap the rest. Lines are huge here to be seated and eat.  (Waited 3 hours once)   Ate many of their salads and entrees.  The steaks are salty and tough, even when ordering their Filet Mignon rare as possible.  (Which came out medium rare and had me asking if what came out really was Filet Mignon.) The salads look green and fresh, but comes out warm, which is unappetizing.  Their sister branch chain Grande Lux Cafe is far better. Their cheese cakes are wonderful when looking for variety and for heavy New York Styled cheesecakes. Entrees: 1 star.  Desserts:  4 stars.  Hence bottom line 2 1/2 stars."
Richard B.,"Westwood, NJ",0,1,,4.0,7/8/2016,Weate at the cheesecake factory last night. Patria sat us at a table and she was very pleasant to us but we saw she was pleasant to everyone she sat. Our waiter Mike was terrific. With a big crowd our service was great.
Mohamed A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",66,36,66,5.0,8/30/2015,Food is excellent here and staff is friendly and on point. There is nice outdoor seating in the summer. Great cheesecakes! Very popular place so only downside is sometimes the wait time can be pretty crazy like one hour or more!
