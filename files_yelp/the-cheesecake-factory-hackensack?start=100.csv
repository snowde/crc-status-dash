Heather F.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",1,77,5,4.0,6/7/2016,"Like other Cheesecake Factory locations, they get very busy. They do not take reservations or call a heads so be prepared to wait if you come on a Saturday night. I came early to avoid the rush, and waited only about 20 minutes. The food was delicious as usual. I had the Cajun chicken littles, which is basically adult chicken fingers- I just wished they were spicier. My boyfriend had the ribeye, which was perfectly cooked. The drinks were tasty, but not very strong. I had the red sangria (11.50 a glass) and he had the pineapple Moscow mule (11.00 a glass). For dessert, I had the tiramisu which is fluffy and delicious. They offer cheesecake tiramisu and regular tiramisu. Normally I get the cheesecake one, but this time I decided to try the regular. They are both amazing!!! Overall, I am never disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory"
Christine J.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",132,25,6,4.0,8/6/2016,"I love coming here. Their caesar salads are very rich and delicious. The smaller size could still feed more than one person. I usually get a salad with chicken as my main meal, but I decided to try the four cheese pasta the other day and it was pretty good. Their food is always well-presented."
Gene G.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,2/20/2017,Love the chain - hate this location.  Just horrible. Over 50 min wait time instead of promised 40. To get 2 pieces of cake from the front - over 25 min.
Suzanne T.,"Secaucus, NJ",202,207,132,3.0,5/2/2015,"Our server Brittany K. was great.  She greater us with a smile, was eager to serve us, was pleasant through our entire meal and kept checking to make sure everthing was ok. Our food came out just as we ordered it and was the quality you would expect from Cheesecake Factory.   This location tends to be very very noisy.  Patrons are always loud.  Plates, silverware and dishes always seem to be banging around."
Kweeing N.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,7,2,1.0,7/15/2017,"TCF had moved to a bigger location at riverside sq mall but it seems that they did not hire additional chef to pick up the workload.  We had ordered our food 30 minutes ago and still waiting.  We ordered salad and pasta, how difficult this is that it had to take more than 30min and counting for our food?  Never again!"
Klim K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",717,241,2087,5.0,6/14/2015,"Delicious food every time! Service can be a hit or miss, but today, we had a waiter named Walter who wash great! Remember everything without writing it down! Never missed a beat!  The bread is delicious, but careful you don't fill up before the great food arrives.  Try the: Avocado egg rolls - they're amazing!  Stuffed mushroom - delicious  Miso salmon - greatness  Ruslan chicken - healthy and delicious at the same time. I have this almost every time!  Cheesecake? Ha! You can't go wrong!"
S K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",2,61,12,1.0,1/26/2017,I STARTED GOING THIS PLACE SINCE 2007~ it was the most cleanest place in the town and the food was amazing... now all are gone.... I ain't going this place anymore. And I will never ever going again.
Monica L.,"Hackensack, NJ",1,34,58,5.0,7/27/2016,Came here with a friend and we both enjoyed it. At first it look like a long wait but once we got in we were actually seated. The bread they bring out is good. We had ordered the calamari to start with which was really good. Then i had chicken tacos which were delicious. My friend had ordered a pasta with chicken (forgot the name) which i tried that taste good as well. Our waiter was also very nice and made sure we were satisfied with our food. And I'm not a cheesecake fan but they had other options so i took home a slice of chocolate fudge cake which was great!
Phillip M.,"Paramus, NJ",0,10,,1.0,1/19/2017,"First off, let me state that I have been a loyal customer at Cheesecake Factory (at this specific location, as well) for over 10 years. Never had a bad meal or a bad experience here... until last night. My buddy and I ordered two rounds of the same drink each. Ketel One and club with a splash of Campari. We were taken aback when we received the bill and saw that they banged us for $20 worth of Campari. To be charging $5 extra for a SPLASH of Campari is outrageous. Never experienced this anywhere else.  We talked to THREE managers. They each gave the same ''this is corporate policy'' BS. ZERO effort made to help us out with the inconvenience. We were expecting the ridiculous $20 Campari charge to be taken off, but they couldn't even offer up a coupon and couldn't even utter a ''sorry'' to us. This is absolutely inexcusable. Not to mention we ran up a $160 bill as well... 2 rounds of drinks, an app, entree and dessert to go... EACH. Extremely bad look when management can't be the least bit considerate with long-time loyal customers spending good money. Thanks to the stubbornness of management, Cheesecake Factory has lost my business forever. Great job!"
Alyssa S.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",2,48,45,3.0,3/3/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite commercial chain restaurant. Their food is great. Service is inconsistent which is why they get 3, not 4 stars. A must try is the chicken costelleta (sp?) comes with crispy chicken in a lemon cream sauce, asparagus and delicious mashed potatoes. Yummy!"
Robert B.,"Totowa, NJ",2,38,6,1.0,10/10/2016,Food is mediocre here they need to fix there cloth napkins it left lint all over my lap and pants !!!!! Fix it fast
Nina A.,"Garfield, NJ",0,37,73,3.0,6/3/2016,"I've dined here four times. Our waits have ranged from none to over an hour, so I avoid TCF on the weekends! The staff is very nice. Our last two visits weren't great. The appetizers are good, I loved the cheese bread and guacamole. However, the rice was very hard in my ""Factory Burritos Grande"". The burritos were great besides this, just a bit hard to chew. So far, I've only had the banana cream cheesecake. It was great at the restaurant! But when I ordered a slice to-go, it was a bit plain, with no banana slices or Bavarian cream."
Mariah W.,"Montclair, NJ",3,26,8,4.0,5/10/2016,"Went to this location for lunch and it wasn't all that bad. It didn't take much time to be seated 5-10 minutes, and the staff was very welcoming and nice.  Once we were seated and ordered drinks the waiter asked us if we were ready to order right away, which I have never had done at a restaurant usually they wait a couple of minutes before asking. We all ordered burgers and they were cooked the way we ordered and all the food seemed fresh, the only complaint I had would be with the fries, some of them were hard as rock, which isn't very appetizing.  Also towards the end it took the waiter a long time before coming to ask if we were done. We were waiting for him for about 20 minutes.  Besides those issues this location is pretty good, fairly clean but could be a bit better, would go again if I had the time."
Sharon Y.,"Ridgewood, NJ",275,34,,5.0,5/8/2016,"There's always a long wait to get seating which is to be expected, and the food is on the pricier end, but everything is always SO good and we always have things to bring home because the portions are huge, which makes up for the price. Seating is a little packed but the staff is always welcoming and friendly, constantly checking up on us to make sure everything is going well."
Lashawn P.,"Paterson, NJ",93,105,443,2.0,7/28/2015,"Looks can be deceiving when you pull your car in the parking lot.... It appears as if there are a herd of cattle waiting to get inside the restaurant. For a party of two, your wait is always 15 minutes...so don't be discouraged go inside and ask how long will of a wait to be seated. Food is always fresh..service is usually good but there is always a slip up at some of our favorite spots.... Our server Caitlyn appeared inexperienced and nervous. Nervous for what.... I don't know... She kept telling us ""one more minute be right there"", huh..Finally she came to the table and maybe that was when she head me say to D, ""If she say one more minute again"" I don't know... She was acting really weird with us... Nevertheless of the weird server,  food was great!You only have to screw me once I won't return here or perhaps visit another location. There are other restaurants for me to use my AMEX at......"
Hamlet P.,"Whippany, NJ",0,8,,1.0,3/3/2016,"Worst service ever. Was told the wait would 1 hr. turned out to be 1:20 mins.  We were a party of three. My wife dish came out first. 25 mins later mine came out.  When I complained as to why all the food was not brought out at the same time  he said ""we are not allowed to carry trays"". When after 15 mins later and my daughter turkey sandwich still wasn't out, I complained again then the manager came out and said they had used the wrong bread. Really!!! It's regular white bread.  Waiter was terrible.  Manager did comp her meal but we will never go back.  BTW The table next to us walk out due to too many problems with their meals."
Bharath B.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,5,,3.0,3/6/2016,"So went to cheesecake factory at Hackensack yesterday, must say it took 15 mins to find parking... with a baby we had to wait for 30 mins to get a table. We were lucky to sit while we were waiting and there were many seniors and kids waiting to sit before they got a table. When it's cold outside, restaurants need to give people some extra seating arrangements at least while waiting. Ordered kale quinoa salad and veggie melt sandwich with fresh tomato basil mozzarella flatbread app. The Good: Veggie melt sandwich was heavenly. Even as I sit the next day I can feel the flavor calling my name. It was just rightly balanced with lots of veggies and less cheese. The toast on it was crunchy and you can hear that if you run a knife on it. Rustic and Awesome!! The Fair: our TBM flatbread was too good to look at (artistic and all)... however one bite and I knew someone had gone overboard with salt. Surprisingly the hubby was ok with extra salt, so, mheh... who cares for skinnylicious qpp having more sodium :p The Ugly: the so called super salad was horrible. First it was like someone just threw torn kale on a plate. Then inspecting a bit I could see quinoa. The taste was not right. Basically kale is a bit bitter so instead of making a salad with a hint of kale for bitterness, the entire dish was bitter. Cut grapes here and there helped a bit but once there were no more grapes left, it became inedible. The waiter was great to get me extra bread to cleanse the bitterness from my pallet. So all in all, it was an average experience. Might come back here just for the veggie melt."
Steven L.,"Clifton, NJ",16,59,,4.0,10/22/2016,"There is a large selection of reasonably priced menu items. They have a lot of salads to choose from if you are looking for a healthy option. The cheesecakes are all delicious, and the portion sizes are large."
Duaine M.,"New York, NY",13,10,24,3.0,2/3/2015,"I first want to say this place is called the Cheesecake factory for a reason. I've been here a few times mostly for the cheesecake which is why this place has a solid 3. But I sat down to actually eat here twice. The first time, I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was mild in the spice department and could use more seasoning.  Then the second time I went to eat I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. Which when you read the description sounds very promising, but unfortunately was not. First they forgot my sweet plantains but somehow they put them on my boyfriend's plate, so he thought it was his and ate them. Kinda made me sad lol and then when I actually tasted the dish it lacked in flavor. Like it's crazy how a little bit of salt can make a big difference in a meal.  After those two disappointments in two separate meals, I'm convinced they don't put any salt in their food.  But as far as the cheesecake goes it's pretty stellar"
Lori M.,"Cresskill, NJ",1,16,9,3.0,10/24/2016,Had Luau salad. Very good. love the food always good. the cheesecake is delicious. too much food so I always have to take the cheesecake to go.
