Sh N.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,71,117,4.0,6/24/2015,A cool place to hangout with a group. The bar looks nice and cocktails were good(we tried 3 different types of martini) Food was really good!  We had avocado egg roles for an appetizer and miso salmon and pork sandwich for an entree. Everything tasted really good!!!  The only downside of this location of the Cheesecake Factory is that the cheesecake(we ordered strawberry cheesecake) was very disappointing. It wasn't that good at all...we really expected it to be something special :(  Overall a nice experience. I would go back but wouldn't order dessert!!!
Deedee C.,"Leonia, NJ",0,49,11,3.0,10/18/2016,No complaints.... Not bad for the price and it being a chain restaurant.
Deborah C.,"Lodi, NJ",98,49,25,4.0,12/27/2015,Place was packed on a Sunday but that's to be expected. Wait wasn't bad at all. Service was steady. Food was on point. We had spicy buffalo chicken meatballs and they were awesome. Dinners were fantastic. Chicken Romano and tomato basil pasta worn grilled chicken were our entrees. Grabbed a cookie dough cheesecake to go. Will definitely be coming back.

Arshi K.,"Hoboken, NJ",670,317,569,3.0,11/20/2014,"There's something for everyone at Cheesecake Factory and it's out go-to place when we have family visiting.  This location is a little dull compared to the one in Shorthills Mall which has better customer service than this one. Here the staff is politely indifferent and once you ignore that  and concentrate on the real reason you're here...the cheesecake...you can have a good time. This time we just had a range of apps and didn't opt for the main course and couldn't be happier - we unanimously feel that the small plates are much better than the main course at the Cheesecake Factory and they have an extensive menu to choose from. The Avocado egg rolls, Dynamite shrimp and the Warm crab & artichoke dip served with crusty bread are always a hit and this time was no different. This time we also got the Beets with goat cheese salad (gotta get those greens) and the Crispy crab bites. The salad was  good, the crab bites were strictly average and smelt fishy.  You can never go wrong with the red velvet cheesecake."
Nareefa Y.,"Englewood, NJ",11,20,8,4.0,1/2/2016,"I often come there for happy hour after work on some Fridays. The bar is always crowed but the service is good.  The quality of the mixed drinks depends on who is making it. Over the course  of a few years, one tends to know who will make a proper margarita and who's just serving lime juice.  The happy hour menu is tasty, affordable and great portion size. We have come for dinner here but I prefer to stick to their happy hour options. The cheese cakes are super delicious, tons of options and never that a bad experience. The dinner menu has a lot of food that isn't to my liking but my husband seems to not mind it. The staff are always friendly and courteous and that what keeps us coming back."
Andrew L.,"Jersey City, NJ",51,65,8,3.0,1/8/2016,"Went out to eat here on a Wednesday evening. I was surprised to see how crowded it was for a weeknight. We were able to get a seat right away nonetheless as this location can accommodate a lot of patrons. We started off with the chicken quesadilla appetizer. It was very tasty, although the portion of guacamole that we received with it had black chunks of avocado. Not a good look. One thing I hate that some restaurants do, this one included, is that they don't list drink prices on the menu. We each ordered a sangria. It was served in a wine glass, mostly filled with ice. They came out to be $11.50 each. Definitely not worth the price. Should have none better : / keep that in mind if you go here. For my entree I order the chicken parm sandwich. It was definitely flavorful and tasty, however, the portion was small.  Overall, the food is good here. Good quality as well. I just feel like you don't really get your money's worth here. The price doesn't justify the quantity of food you receive. Other than that, no complaints."
Amanda S.,"Lackawaxen, PA",0,63,,2.0,4/9/2017,"My family went this Sunday evening for a birthday dinner. Food was okay and about $3 / dish overpriced. Service was mediocre. Our waitstaff served everyone from one end of the table rather than starting from one end and then going to the other. There was definitely enough room to do so and we would have been spared having to pass a cup of hot tea to the other end of the table as well as large glasses filled with soda. We also had to ask for our bread dishes and empty cups/glasses to be removed from the table before dessert was served. When a bill comes to close to $260 for 5, I would hope for better service. Note - fried calamari was excellent - stay away from strawberry shortcake dessert (doughy, heavy, strawberries in a layer on the side rather than between the biscuits) - stick with the cheesecake. Also give yourself 3 hours+ to get from start to finish. No one in our party ordered anything exotic enough to warrant such a long wait. I just read several of the most recent reviews and have seen management's notes- rather than apologizing over and over again, I would suggest fixing issues that are coming up."
Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,937,15249,4.0,12/7/2015,"My family would make the trip to this mall at least monthly many years ago. If you live in NYC and want to eat at Cheesecake Factory this used to be the closest location. We also like the feel of home we would get from shopping in a Mall such as this one.  Like most reviews say, it is higher end stores. I like the Barnes and Noble location. You can always find gifts in there. During the time we went to this mall it was undergoing renovation. It has now become very luxurious inside. The tile floors and glass roofing are great. I love the seating area. When you shop until you drop you can sit down to rest comfortably in the mall.  The reason we don't shop here any longer involves the transportation. In Winter. We had to wait in the cold on the highway for the bus to and from NYC. I remember one day climbing over huge piles of snow to cross the highway to get the bus back to NY. I can't tell you how many times we would be flagging the bus down as it passed us by. It became to much trouble and unsafe to be out on the highway.   Someone told us about Park and Ride and the bus going to the Mall in Wayne. We started going to Willowbrook Mall. It is much easier to access from NYC. I often wonder if they started providing bus transportation to and from their parking lot. An over hang with protection during inclement weather would be nice at The Riverside Shops.  If you don't live nearby, or own a car keep this in mind when you go.  Maybe if enough people express an interest they will help us by providing this service. I would certainly like to return to Hackensack for a visit. The food and service were always great at this CCF. I miss going there!"
Theresa V.,"Fairfield, NJ",36,281,20,4.0,4/15/2015,"The s'mores cheesecake is the best! That fresh burned caramel taste of the marshmallow just adds to the delight. Wonderful!  I also I am a fan of their summer spring rolls, with two sources that are bound to please people who don't have a spicy palate. Another menu fave is the Asian lettuce wraps, making a good light meal in itself. Steak Diane is also great if you prefer a more substantive dinner.  Choose the paradise tea (comes unsweetened), if you are aching for a treat sans alcohol."
Marsha B.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",48,3,,1.0,9/30/2016,"Ambiance is great but the cocktail drinks are what I consider Virgin drinks. There is NO taste of alcohol what so ever. When asked if alcohol was the in drink, the bartender says ""it's blended so you won't taste it"". Well for an adult having alcoholic beverages for over 15 years, I am aware when I'm being gipped. And for $11.50 a cocktail, I could've easily bought a bottle a rum at a liquor store and still had change. Just terrible."
Mark S.,"Jersey City, NJ",511,613,955,4.0,5/25/2013,"Went here for lunch today with the Mrs.   We ordered off the low calorie menu.  We had the chicken dumplings which were so good.  I was even sopping up the sauce with the bread like it was gravy. For our entrees, my wife ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries.  It was ok, just a little too much mayonnaise for my taste.  I had the Turkey & Avocado Sandwich with a Side Salad.  It was really good and had thick slices of smoked bacon. All was healthy up until this point (and filling).  We then strayed a bit, (a lot actually).  We ordered two slices of cheesecake to go (can't go to a place named The Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake right?)  We ordered the Key Lime and the low carb (will have to let you know about the low carb when I actually eat it).   Once again, thanks Lor A for a great tip. Sorry couldn't resist the cheesecake."
Porsche A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,,1.0,4/16/2017,"Don't waste your time here!!!! I have been to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations this location by far is the worse. It is Easter Sunday and I wasn't in the mood to cook so I figured I would go out to eat I thought it was perfect that they were open but I have to say the service and the food was horrible. My nearest Cheesecake Factory is the Newport Mall location which is normally very busy and a little annoying crowd wise so I figured I would try this location because it was only 30 minutes away from me. The wait time was not bad however the waiter I had was not good at all. It took 10 minutes before someone came to wait in my table I was with my son and my husband, when my waiter (Samir) arrived to my table he introduced himself and asked  to take our drink order since we knew what we wanted we ordered an appetizer and our entrees together. The drinks came very late we got our appetizer before our drinks when our drinks arrived our food took another 20 minutes. I have to say I am very disappointed by the quality of the food at the Riverside Mall location I ordered a grilled salmon with sautéed spinach and asparagus it was literally only cooked not seasoned at all not even a pinch of seasoning. I have had the same entree at other locations and it was amazing this time I was beyond disappointed. I told Samir that I was not satisfied with my food and the reason why I was unpleased and he seem to make me out to be crazy by looking at me with a confused look as if he did not understand my issue. He went to the kitchen and brought back a new plate of sides exactly the same as the original with no flavor what a ever. My husband ordered fried catfish which he said was also cooked poorly. Samir did not take any responsibility for his job he did not show any concern or made any attempt to try to satisfy us in anyway. I didn't even bother to ask for a manger because I felt like it would be a complete waste of time I got so upset I left my husband to wait for the check after waiting an additional 20 minutes for Samir to return with it. Samir just took our order brought us our food and drinks and never returned to ask if we were ok I think that if you care about service and good food when you want to go out to have dinner you should stay far away from the Cheesecake Factory at the Riverside Mall because they are HORRIBLE at everything!!!"
Shayna M.,"San Diego, CA",139,31,337,2.0,9/21/2015,"Never disappointed by the food at the Cheesecake Factory. However, the past couple of times I've come... It seems that the quality of the servers keep going down... And down... And down. I once asked my server how the coffee was and she replied ""the coffee here sucks. You should get the cappuccino."" (Because that's how you up sell) and then another time I asked my server the different types of mahi mahi that they had an all she said was "" I don't know"" (because that helps). The food is always delicious.. Always... But who are they hiring these days? It's supposed to be an upscale place. It's right next to sax fifth avenue for crying out loud. Managers if you are reading this... Re evaluate your staff."
Julie T.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",30,392,337,5.0,2/21/2015,"I enjoyed a lovely lunch here. The half-size portions they offer for lunch are about $11 and still a good amount of food.  The BBQ ranch chicken salad is amazing. I loved every bite. Service was great too. My child enjoyed the kids pepperoni pizza, and my spouse loved the orange chicken. We got a slice of cheesecake to go. With two alcoholic drinks the meal came to $62."
A. P.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",4,44,11,2.0,12/5/2016,It is a very nice restaurant but the food was ok. Appetizer was good we had cheese sticks. I usually get chicken Madeira which was good a little . My husband ordered pasta with sausage and it was salty and my sons grilled chicken was very dry. The mac and cheese had no flavor so I packed jt to go. Heated it up today (next day) and I kid you not it was bathed in mean bathed!!!! In oil I couldn't heed that to my kid. Other than the bread I give it a two star.
Hope D.,"Westwood, NJ",262,90,60,4.0,9/16/2015,"I LOVE there cheesecake, if i could live off of it forever i would. There food is okay i do like it, but there are times when I will go strictly to get the Hershey's Chocolate Cheesecake!! It is amazing if you have not had the cheesecake here you are seriously missing out! It's pricey but it is really good so if you haven't you gotta go!"
Michael S.,"Mahwah, NJ",2,92,62,3.0,8/20/2016,"Why do so many people rave about this very mediocre and overrated place? For starters, we all ordered drinks. The waitress got all of them wrong; giving me a Dr Pepper instead of root beer. I don't know how she could mess up a simple task. Then, we got a spinach dip. In the sour cream I noticed that there were white, dry strings of something that shouldn't have been there. For the dinner, I ordered chicken costeleta which was fried and oily. It didn't taste too good. We didn't even bother with dessert. Very high priced for what you get. Average service. Not the best food. I do not recommend this restaurant especially since there are so many better restaurants in this mall."
Kimberly C.,"San Marino, CA",27,399,172,4.0,7/16/2016,"Please keep in mind that this is a chain restaurant so it's already starting with customer-centric decor and time tested dishes. Came on a Friday night and was told that the wait would be 20 min; it ended up being 25 min but it wasn't too bad. Walking over to over table, I noticed the floors were freshly mopped to the point of being sticky and slick at the same time. Our waitress was busy closing out other tables when we were seated, but she made sure to come by and let us know she'd be right back. The complimentary bread wasn't delivered until the same time as our appetizer, which you can interpret as the bread was delivered late or the app came out really quickly, up to you. The food and cheesecake is always on point, since again, it's a chain. Overall, not a perfect experience, but definitely solid. I wouldn't avoid this location at all."
MaJo M.,"White Plains, NY",0,8,6,1.0,7/27/2015,"I had to wait 1 hour for tacos... Ask to pack my salad and they throw it away... Waiter didn't even bother to say sorry was a mistake, instead she just didn't come back to the table. We order cheese cakes and she took almost 20 minutes to bring it to the table.  2 and a half in a restaurant is just absurd. Been here before and I never had to experience such a delayed specially a Monday night that was NOT busy."
