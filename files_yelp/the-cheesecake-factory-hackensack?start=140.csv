Sara R.,"Teaneck, NJ",2,9,26,4.0,9/7/2016,"this is our favorite, staff is friendly place is clean and the food and portion size is always on point, the cheese cakes are decadent"
Adam A.,"River Edge, NJ",1409,131,316,2.0,5/29/2014,"Cheesecake factory... I have eaten there a few times in the past, but I have since given it up.  I now stick to driving up in front of the restaurant to run in and pick up a slice of cheesecake from time to time. Let's talk about the food.  First, they have an overwhelming menu of which I usually win the unfortunate prize of choosing whatever they do NOT have available (Sending me back to the endless menu of doom to choose again, ugh).  If you are lucky enough to find something that is available expect giant portions of mediocre, 'stuff yourself' food; Not my thing. The cheesecake on the other hand is very tasty.  The ability for me to drive up in front, throw my hazard lights on, and run in and grab a couple of slices of great cheese cake when the craving arises is what has saved this place From a one star review. Hey, at least the people eating there keep them open nice and late so I can show up and grab a slice of cheesecake from time to time,.  I'm sure they would close earlier if they were cheesecake-only establishment =] 2 Stars."
Janice L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",607,884,123,4.0,6/20/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory. What's even better is they have a small plates / tapas menu now. The staff here is always friendly and polite. The food is always good. The cheesecakes are out of the world.  I don't think I've had a bad dish here and I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory since my high school years (oh goodness, that's over a decade ago!). They have never disappointed. However, warning you that Friday and Saturday nights get a bit crazy so expect to wait or go on off nights like I do. Another tidbit: if a table opens up by the bar area, there is no wait for those, hop onto a stool and enjoy your meal! (I've often gotten around the 1 hour wait this way.) Best cheesecakes include the Godiva and Chocolate Turtle (Caramel & Nuts)!"
S G.,"Hackensack, NJ",4,18,,5.0,7/22/2016,"The food is very good. I come here with my 70 year old mother, my husband and our two kids 11 and 9. There is something for everyone. We are always happy with the service. Very happy with the service every visit!  It's a busy place so prepare to wait depending on what time you go."
Camille A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,12,27,5.0,3/21/2015,"Delicious food and great service; I have yet to order a dish that I haven't enjoyed. The lighting is a bit dim for my liking, but overall the atmosphere is nice. I recommend the crab cakes as an appetizer, and thoroughly enjoyed the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish as a main course. Their chicken and biscuit dish was yummy as well. Of course, the highlight of the restaurant was the dessert - cheesecake. My favorite still has got to be the original cheesecake, but I also enjoy the Oreo cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake.  Downsides:  - long wait (can range from 10 minutes to 2 hours)  - it's a bit pricey  Would still recommend to a friend, however."
Tyson S.,"Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",0,49,53,4.0,4/29/2016,"Big place. The food is good , price is decent and the drinks are standard. Dessert is the best a lot of options . There's 2 TVs by the bar to watch a game. Have a take out section if your on the go ."
Rich V.,"Garfield, NJ",99,92,485,4.0,9/18/2015,"I don't know if this was a fluke or did i just become a fan of the factory. Guacamole was fresh and well seasoned, although the chips tasted old and stale. The guac was too damn good to care as i shoved it in my mouth with anything on the table. i didn't know what i wanted to i opted for the cup of soup, half sandwich and salad dish. The cream of mushroom soup was full of mushroom flavor and had a nice texture. The sandwich was turkey and cheese which was toped with a  beautiful ripe tomato and then I slapped some of that guac on it and DAMN!! That just happened!!!... The caesar was cold, creamy and tasted exactly what i had in my mind. Service was average and the place was filled with a bunch of weirdos but i really enjoyed the food and will be back for this combo again."
Mike B.,"Fort Lee, NJ",61,123,41,5.0,4/27/2015,"This is a review of a slice of banana cream pie cheesecake I picked up from here. I think the fact that I was compelled to write a review about a piece of cake speaks volumes about how good it was. But it wasn't just good, it was unbelievable. Ordering that slice of cheesecake was one of the best decisions I ever made in my life. I've made a couple good ones over the years, but I am particularly proud of this specific one.  Now to the cake. I've never had cheesecake that was so rich and moist. Each bite was heavenly. The crust at the bottom had a soft and crumbly texture that was also really good. The banana creme had a great texture and tasted like a creamy banana. The cake was served with a generous portion of sliced bananas and whipped cream. No joke, I ate this thing for three days--savoring every bite. OK this is getting weird."
Amanda R.,"Maywood, NJ",0,3,,4.0,12/31/2016,"The Cheesecake is truly the highlight of the Cheesecake Factory. The food, not as worthy of five stars but the cheesecake truly makes the experience worth while. Service varies from time to time, yet nothing too bad that would be worth noting. Would also walk in just to get cheesecake alone and take it to go. The wait varies as well, but every time I go there has always been a wait. Sometimes they tel you the wait is really long but it will actually be way shorter which is great! I guess they give you the extreme to prepare for. Overall, 4 stars because I don't think the food is always the greatest, but great for the price point."
Cristina M.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2/1/2017,"Our waitress seemed to care more about her phone than us. It was my boyfriends first time here and now it will be the last (i love cheesecake factory so this is very disappointing) I said 3 times i would like a hibiscus lemonade and was brought a regular one. Our appetizers took 30 minutes to come out and by the time our food was brought out we had to leave. We couldn't find our waitress the whole time we were here! We ended up eating our food then we asked for boxes and to-go cake which also took way too much time. I asked the waitress to split the bill and she made it seem like a problem. Don't waste your money here. If you get sat with a waitress named alexis, request for a different waitress quick!"
Laurel M.,"Rockaway, NJ",0,6,,2.0,2/1/2017,"I was there with a small group, there was hair in my food and instead of comping the meal, thus gave me a free piece of cheesecake which was less than half the price. Meal and dessert should have been comped being I couldn't eat my food!!! Disgusting. Will not return"
Michael Z.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",225,500,312,2.0,3/17/2014,"For the longest time I have heard nothing but great things about the cheesecake factory. After putting it off repeatedly, I finally came in for brunch. Unfortunately, it's reputation did not precede.  Pros: We were sat almost immediately. Our order came quickly We came in under our $50 gift card Cons: Where do I start? Now, let me start this by saying that I realize this is not a diner and that done of these things may just be personal grievances. First off, my coffee mug was dirty as there was food remnants stuck to the outside. More than that, when someone orders coffee, why would you not bring cream and sugar? I ordered coffee, a custom omelet with mushrooms, ham, peppers and cheese with potatoes and toast.  If someone orders toast with their meal, doesn't it makes sense to bring pats of butter and/or jam? Who wants to eat plain dried bread? In general I want impressed with the food. It wasn't anything I couldn't get elsewhere.  I ordered a slice of white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake and still wasn't impressed. There was absolutely nothing that caught my attention, it was just bland. I also wasn't a fan of the chocolate graham on the bottom."
Tasha W.,"New York, NY",116,10,3,1.0,6/13/2016,"The level of service has declined drastically. The waitress seated us and didn't return with water or even to ask for a drink order before servicing two other tables seated after us. When she finally brought water it was for three not 4. In addition she messed our order bringing the same order twice and forgot my friends order. She then looked puzzled until my friend said she was to hungry to wait for what she actually ordered and kept the mistake. We sat outside where is was very windy. She brought us the check and didn't return for awhile to retrieve it. We placed a salt shaker on top of the check holder. All flew away. We  retrieved most of the cash except $10. The manager came to our table in a a rude tone said he couldn't control the wind and we needed to come up with the 10 l dollars even though they charged us for the incorrect ORDER. We said, no problem it's her tip. He then adjusted the bill but also CHARGED MY FRIENDS CARD THE ENTIRE BILL AMOUNT IN ADDITION TO TAKING OUR CASH! so the waitress received a 70 tip. We are calling the better business bureau. These big businesses can't do what they please and not be held accountable. L"
Wayne F.,"Wyckoff, NJ",53,29,6,4.0,3/26/2016,"Pleasantly surprised!  Hadn't been in years.  Went at 5 pm on a Saturday. Hostess said it would be a 20 minute wait and it was exactly that.  Waiter (Justin) was fantastic.  I had a delicious chicken dish, my wife had an omelette.  My daughters pasta was perfect and my sons meatloaf very good also.  And yes, the cheesecake!   Best anywhere.  Get there early.  Much more economical option btw than Mortons or Oceania.  Also at Riverside."
Nasha U.,"Hackensack, NJ",97,9,24,5.0,6/28/2015,"This place is the best. We got seated right away, the waiter was good, and the food was phenomenal. I recommend the Imperial chicken and shrimp to everyone."
Jeanna G.,"Paramus, NJ",438,627,2800,4.0,3/3/2014,"One of my favorite restaurants to go to in the area on a last minute date night with my boyfriend. Came in around 8:30 pm was seated rite away, which was nice and unusual for the cheese cake factory. We looked over the menus and our waiter came over rite away to take our drink orders and came back with bread and butter. We ordered the fried mac and cheese, shrimp scampi for me (as usual) and my boyfriend ordered two appetizers for his meal even though he only needed one and barley touched the other one. He ordered the buffalo blasts which were really yummy and he ordered the southern fried chicken sliders. The service was great and friendly as usual I had a great experience here."
Leela K.,"Bergenfield, NJ",382,225,622,4.0,8/9/2014,"Happy hour, happy hour, happy hour! The price is right and so is the food. I never leave hungry as the portions are generous. The salads are tasty and the happy hour apps easily lend themselves to a full meal (order two and you will likely take home leftovers.)"
Carol B.,"Bloomingdale, NJ",24,44,39,1.0,7/19/2015,Do not recommend pasta dishes. The sauce was watery. The mozzarella appetizer was not good either. I should have stuck to the salads.
Amy P.,"Sewell, NJ",149,133,292,3.0,3/28/2015,This was only my 2nd time at a Cheesecake Factory and it was satisfactory. It was pretty busy for a Sunday at lunchtime but we were seated right away.  I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were horrible. There must have been an entire can of black beans on the bottom of the plate and then tortillas and VERY runny eggs on top. I like my eggs over easy but these must have been in the griddle for 10 whole seconds.  The salsa and avocado on top made the meal edible.  The tortillas were completely soggy. Next time I'll just order a simple sandwich.  My friend ordered the skinnilicous (sp?) chicken tacos and she really enjoyed them and wanted more (hence the 3 star rating). I was so disappointed by my slop of a meal I didn't bother ordering a piece of cheesecake.
Zoey L.,"Passaic, NJ",0,25,,1.0,8/28/2016,"This place was so dirty I did not even get to eat what I ordered. We walked in and the podium the hostesses stand behind was covered in straws and straw wrappers, cups and lids. Between the 7 of them behind there no one could pick this stuff up? We proceeded anyway... They sat us at one of those annoying, small, totally not intimate tables where you're right on top of your stranger neighbors and have to smell their cheap cologne and whisper if you want to have a conversation that you don't want others to be a part of. We proceeded anyway. As I was trying to squeeze into the booth end of this table without crushing the shopping mall bags of my stranger neighbors, I slipped on something. I'm going to say it was baby food? I really don't want to say it was vomit, because I'd lose my shit if it was, so we'll go with baby food. We proceeded anyway. Slipping in the ""baby food"" prompted me to peek under the table and the tables of my stranger neighbors. COVERED in garbage and brown bread crumbs and, mine, that peculiar slime. No one had swept or mopped in days. I looked up and the ""mural"" on the ceiling is COVERED in flies. I gagged, but proceeded anyway. The waitress took our order. My boyfriends salad comes out first. The plate has lipstick smeared all over it. At that point we finally got up, apologized to the waitress, told her how disgustingly dirty that place was and left. I will never set foot into a Cheesecake Factory, ANY Cheesecake Factory, ever again. I've eaten in dive bars that were cleaner. Gross!"
