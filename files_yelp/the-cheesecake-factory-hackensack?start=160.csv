Yahya S.,"Bergenfield, NJ",210,238,89,4.0,9/1/2015,"This location is my go-to at night if I want some cheesecake and consistently good food. The whole grain bread and butter is my staple appetizer lol.  The service is usually very good. The wait isnt too long, given that its packed every time I go there = Sign of a good restaurant.  I recommend this location to friends when we hang out because it's close by me and it's always good food. I have yet to have a bad experience and I hope that keeps up."
Christopher Y.,"Oradell, NJ",89,42,10,3.0,11/12/2016,"Good comfort food and great cheesecake. They used to have a good pesto dish some years ago, am bummed that it's no longer offered on the menu. At least their cheesecake has always been consistently good every time I've had it."
Jack S.,"Paramus, NJ",3,3,2,1.0,3/13/2016,Wooow its been 1 hour we still waiting for food and not even the salad is here!!!! This is ridicilous. The waiter is absolutely mean and terrible server!! Will never ever sit on her table again!!!
Khanh T.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,73,128,5.0,1/22/2016,"This place is really good, beats out any Friday's, Outbacks, Chili's , and Applebee's! The portions are huge so be prepared to stuff your face. My fiance and I had skipped appetizers and ordered to entrees. He had the meatloaf and I ordered the Thai glazed salmon. I'm not a fan of meatloaf, but I tried it and it can change any vegetarians. The Thai salmon had a soy and sweet ting to it. We were so stuffed that we ordered our cheesecakes to-go. I had the tiramisu cheesecake and he ordered the banana cream cheesecake. The fluffiness was melt in your mouth heaven. I definitely recommend this restaurant! Everyone should go at least once in their lifetimes."
Ahmed A.,"Jersey City, NJ",663,359,566,4.0,6/16/2014,"I usually am not to fond of eating at franchise restaurants, however cheesecake is as good as it's going to get. The food and service are usually consistently good. Usually it doesn't really matter which restaurant you go to they are pretty much all the same. Now with my experience, we started with a few apps. Some good choices are the crab and artichoke dip, buffalo blasters, and crab cakes. We all got different entrees but I like the steak, herb crusted salmon, and pastas are a pretty solid choice as well. This place has really huge portion which is usually a good thing but not always, so expect to be bringing something home. Now regarding the deserts, where can you go wrong depending on your preference. You have two pages of assorted and unique cheesecakes to choose from. My two favorite are the Reese's and the Godiva cheesecakes. But keep in mind I am a chocolate and peanut butter lover! Overall, good selection for lunch or dinner and you should have a decent to good experience here all the time."
Jun C.,"New York, NY",25,166,107,3.0,2/12/2015,"People like making jokes about the Cheesecake Factory, but the food here is actually pretty good.  In fact, despite its status as a chain, it serves better quality food than a lot of the independent, classy restaurants you may find in the American suburbs.   Food: Taste is obviously the most important aspect of a restaurant, and most of the food items that I have tasted at The Cheesecake Factory have been excellent.  Two other big reasons why I like this franchise is 1) the quantity, and 2) the range of choices.  The Cheesecake Factory is famous for having absurdly huge portions for all of their meals.  I would consider myself a fatty when it comes to food, but even I don't have a high success rate here when it comes to finishing my meal in one sitting.  Also, it's great that the menu here is so varied, and gives us a wide array of different foods to choose from.  A personal favorite of mine, which I'm admittedly embarrassed as a grown man to order, is the ""Cajun Chicken Littles"" lol.  They are essentially chicken fingers, but with Cajun seasoning and spice on the thing layer of breading, with very tender white meat on the inside.  Another good one is the ever popular dish, the ""Bang Bang Chicken."" Decor:   I like how this place is set up.  There are plenty of tables and the restaurant is very big, but the tables are separated by booths and barriers so that despite the large number of customers, it still to a degree feels like a private experience, and doesn't feel all that like you're sitting in a giant room with strangers.  They also keep the lights dimmed throughout most of the day, and the dark yellow/orange/brown colors make it so that it looks even darker than it is.  This dim lighting, combined with the comfy cushioned seats and the massive amount of food, admittedly makes me tired every time I'm here.  I just want to curl up in a ball and go to sleep haha.   Service: I haven't had any complaints about the service here at all.  Every server and employee that I have interacted with here has been incredibly friendly and helpful.  The wait time for the food is never too long, but the waiters and waitresses will still come by often to check up on you and bring you drink refills before you can even ask for them.  They also keep the bowl of bread full as well.   Overall, I can see why The Cheesecake Factory franchise is so widespread and still seemingly thriving.  Don't let the fact that it's a chain prevent you from trying out the food, which is very reliable and tasty."
Irene H.,"New York, NY",124,1083,187,3.0,6/10/2014,"Saturday night, around 8pm. Wait for a table of 2 was 15 minutes. We parked ourselves at the bar and our table was ready just as we got our drinks.  We were seated quickly towards the back. The waiter took our orders at the same time as the table next to ours. They got their food and were almost done when a manager stopped by to apologize for the kitchen backup. Our food took a while to come after that. We also ordered an app but they forgot about it, which is for the better anyways.  I love their savory food but the process of getting the food sucks.  I love the Chicken Madeira. Not a fan of cheesecake.  Weird note on the bread basket: some baskets have variety, some don't. What gives?"
A M.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",0,8,,2.0,2/21/2016,Very disappointed with the food. We order a mac and cheese burger and it was completely burn. We told the waiter and all she said was sorry. We still couldn't eat it so sorry doesn't help.
Arnie S.,"Maywood, NJ",5,110,9,4.0,6/7/2015,"Never had a bad meal here. I love the jambalaya and fish n chips. The breads in the basket are tasty. I recently had the lemon herb chicken. Very tasty and moist. The cheesecake..take your pick, and warm apple crisp are delicious. The only caveat is..u should get there during off hours. Big crowds waiting, but I guess they're there for a reason. Good service as well."
Jacob L.,"Tenafly, NJ",10,74,26,4.0,7/13/2015,"I feel like a Cheesecake Factory shouldn't deserve 4 stars. But the reality is, they have good food, it's reliable, and safe, and it's definitely better than 3 stars. They have a ridiculously extensive menu. The portions are large. People should probably share more instead of ordering a dish each. If you eat here on the regular, you will probably also become large. My favs: BBQ Ranch Salad Louisiana Chicken Jambalaya Negatives: The quality of the bread. I am pretty sure their bread used to be fresher and of a better quality a number of years ago. The sourdough is usually ok, but that honey oat bread frequently comes out flat and dense. It also sometimes seemed reheated instead of baked fresh. Servers are usually great and hustling."
Sean C.,"New York, NY",218,218,367,3.0,5/29/2015,I came in for lunch and decided to sit at the bar since I was alone and like the interaction with the bartender.  The moment I sat down the bartender welcomed me and asked if I wanted something to drink.  After that he asked if I was going to dine in which I said yes he put down a setting.  The order was taken and the food came out in under five minutes.  The food was good and my glass of water was never left empty as I kept getting refills.  Overall this was a good experience and I'll be back.
Emmie G.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",1,11,13,1.0,9/11/2015,"Not worth the $70 bill we got AT ALL. The chicken Alfredo- one note, one color. I couldn't believe it. I thought it was a mistake. No green garnish, no tomatoe, watery cheese sauce, just all white pasta and cheese. Extremely bland cheese at that. So bad that I couldn't make myself eat the whole thing. I just ate the chicken.  For $19.50, higher than most places,  I was pissed. The Passion Fruit ice tea had no passion. I don't know how they made it but it was VERY bitter and had no fruit taste at all. Had to put about 6-8 packs of sugar to get it to taste somewhat good but then got a s u gar rush to the head after 3 packs. So headache, bad dinner, stomach ache. The cheese and bacon tots tasted terrible. There was creamy, watery cheese inside :-( My husband's fries were stiff and practically stale. The carrot cake is dry, doesn't use the traditional icing. Moreso got strings of carrots and nuts than cake batter. :-( Only good thing: Lemonade, mozzarella appetizer, cheeseburger. Serve and hostess was good and very polite. Verdict: absolutely will not waste my money here again. I could do better at a local pizza shop- True Story! And pay only $22 for everything."
Dean T.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2016,"Don't go, they can't even handle sitting their customers in an orderly fashion. After waiting an hour to be sat I asked how long to find out the buzzer was ""broken"" and we had been passed over. After being told we would be next we waited another 10 minutes. I then watched as someone else walked up with the same issue and the girl told them the same thing (and they got seated). Don't waste your time going here, there are plenty of better restaurants to go to in the area that won't make you waste an hour for mediocre food."
Marissa S.,"Hackensack, NJ",72,39,,4.0,2/9/2016,"Would you like to gain a few pounds in one sitting? Then cheesecake factory is the place to go! Everything is good but really large portions. Even the salads are colossal. But the dressings are packed with flavor and probably lots of calories too so ask for it on the side because they really pour it on if you don't. The cheesecake slices are humungous so share with someone .... or be a glutton. Whatever the case, the cheesecake is yummy but super sweet. The specialty drinks are sweet too so just get a whiskey on the rocks like i do and keep it simple."
Hana L.,"Macungie, PA",14,70,374,4.0,4/5/2014,"The ambiance was nice and the servers were friendly and helpful. My factory burger was good, but I don't think I would order it again - the baguette was a little hard to bite through. I think it was an interesting bun choice that didn't work for a burger in my opinion."
Gina M.,"Morris Heights, Bronx, NY",1,6,1,4.0,9/26/2015,2 thumbs up for the tuscan chicken on the skinnylicious menu... So tasty!!! Highly recommend this dish
Amir R.,"Englewood, NJ",0,7,119,5.0,5/18/2016,Great food and good service! Love their Cheesecakes and lotsa other entrees on the menu!
Pauline C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",121,106,347,4.0,1/24/2015,"Always a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu can be quite overwhelming, but I usually stick to what I like anyway... Their prices are decent and their portions are HUGE. There's always a wait at Cheesecake Factory, so get here early or plan on waiting. They have happy hour at the bar with cheap plates and drinks! Here are my favorites: Appetizer: Avocado Egg Rolls / Buffalo Blast Salad: Luau Salad Sandwich: Turkey Burger Pasta: Bellagio Entree: Chicken Lettuce Wraps Drink: Skinny Mojito Cheesecake: Vanilla Bean"
Shaquana E.,"Clifton, NJ",1,79,72,2.0,6/20/2015,"I love the orange chicken here but the service here is not one of my favorites. I'm. Customer service queen so if on more than one occasion I'm not a priority of the staff, then Ill pass on returning. Today I ending up here craving orange chicken but didn't want to wait so I decided to order to go. The lady told me the food should take 15 minutes. After 15 minutes I asked how much longer, and she didn't know. 8 minutes later I asked the same question she then told me to have a seat and she'll bring it to me when it's ready. I waited 40 mins total."
Dani S.,"Paramus, NJ",144,159,325,2.0,1/15/2016,"Service sucked - food was ok! Cheesecake Factory is a solid pick if you are with a group of people and everyone wants to eat something different. They have a huge menu where everyone is bound to find something that they like. Its always busy at this location and there is always a wait. This time around we waited for 1.5 hours - which sounds like a long time but with the mall next door you just put your name in and then do some shopping in the mean time. This place will NOT blow you away but it's still a good place. However the service the last few times just SUCKS! Our waiter only stopped by to bring us drinks, our food, and then the check. He never asked us if we wanted another drink, or anything else. He could have probably doubled his check if he had done so. Dinner was about 2 hours long, not because we ate or drank that much but just because of the super slow service. Their cheesecake is pretty good tho :)"
