Jasmine F.,"Garfield, NJ",112,2,,1.0,5/12/2016,"I came here yesterday around 7:30 pm with my parents and sister . I ordered a veggie burger with no cheese (I'm highly allergic to cheese) of course my burger comes out with cheese. I send it back and they brought me a ""recook"" only problem was it wasn't a recook . It was the same burger they just ripped off the cheese . How do I know ? Because there was still some cheese left on it . I was so angry ! People are really so careless that they would really give a person who's allergic to cheese a burger with cheese ! I wish I ate it though because They would of had the biggest lawsuit they have ever seen on there hands ! This place is dangerous . If you have allergies don't trust this place they clearly don't care ."
Vivi N.,"Englewood, NJ",246,144,453,3.0,4/23/2015,"Always good to come here for a lunch with one of my girlfriends to catch up. The lunch menu is slightly cheaper but still has generous portions. I ordered the Asian Pear Martini and Louisiana Chicken pasta for lunch. If you like pasta and a little spice and extra kick, go for it. Then we had cappuccinos for dessert."
Hungry K.,"Boca Raton, FL",3057,796,6348,3.0,2/21/2015,"Greeting- yes Vibe- mad hatter Service- good Bathrooms- Pass Parking- free lot Price- moderate Food Big salads $15 mostly lettuce.  Turkey burger tastes weird, would not get it again Good potato fries Blackout chocolate cake very good WIGB? Yes Overtime the CCF has cut back on its main ingredients. Portions have reduced in size and prices have increased. It's not as great a place as it used to be. The desserts are still the standouts."
Michael M.,"Raleigh, NC",10,14,,1.0,7/29/2016,Lost my credit card ther recently. Called immediately and no one got back to me.  Now I have a fraudualnt charge posted and had to cancel the card and put in a claim.  Have called twice and no one has taken the time to call me back.  Very poor customer service.
Sui B.,"Jersey City, NJ",161,766,1235,3.0,8/25/2011,"Stick with the pasta and salads which are super good. Th turkey burger, philly cheese steak... Not so much.   That said, I've also been here so many times that I can say the staff are always friendly (can't say the same for the hostesses)."
Mysti R.,"San Diego, CA",75,127,161,2.0,10/17/2014,"I've been to many of the cheesecake factories and this is the one with terrible service. They do NOT listen at all. My order ALWAYS comes out wrong and they take forever.  This location has the worst service possible. Even at the bar it's terrible. I sat at the bar with my husband and still it took forever for a drink. The bartenders look like they rolled in the dumpster and then came to work. They do not smile at all.  It's called a CUSTOMER SERVICE position, which requires to have a smile.  This place needs to train their servers and bartenders to have better service and to make sure there are no mistakes on customers orders."
Christopher L.,"Edgewater, NJ",151,18,54,3.0,12/30/2014,"The service is still good, but either the buns are getting a lot bigger or the hamburger patties are shrinking. And I'm pretty sure the bun size hasn't changed, so......"
Alexandra S.,"Rutherford, NJ",0,15,6,1.0,10/3/2015,"Let me make one thing clear...this review for the majority is not based of off the food served at Cheesecake Factory. After having an extremely poor experience at this Cheesecake Factory, I reflected on what had actually happened before writing this review as to not overreact. One evening about 2 months ago my boyfriend and I decided to venture to CF, I was having a craving for cheesecake, and the food is also pretty decent. So we were off to get dinner. When we arrived the the hostess took our name down and told us that it would be a short wait, which was fine. When we were seated it didn't take very long before we knew what we wanted to order because we always get the same thing. Our server came over and was polite. We placed our order with him when he arrived, for me the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, and for my boyfriend, a cuban sandwich. We also ordered an appetizer, fried calamari. Now for the appetizer we had a specific request, neither myself or my boyfriend like the tentacles that are normally served with fried calamari so we asked if we could have the rings only. Now this is something that we have asked for on more than one occasion and at more than one CF. The server said that there was no problem and left the table to go put in our order. A few minutes later he came back to the table and told us that he was sorry but that his manager said that it was against policy to serve the fried calamari without the tentacles. I explained to the server that we ask for this every time we come in and it has never been a problem, we asked to speak with the manager... A man came over, unfortunately I do not know his name, but he was very nice and told us that he would oblige our request for us. He did explain that it's not normally something that they do but that he would do it for us. A few moments later our fried calamari came to the table with the tentacles, so it seemed like there was some miscommunication. We explained to the food runner that the manager said he would make our order rings only, this she was not aware of, so she took the plate back to the kitchen. A few minutes after that a woman came charging over to our table and said, ""just so you guys know we can never do this for you again!!"" I replied by telling her that we already spoke to a manager and everything was taken care of. She condescendingly replied, ""I'm the manager and I don't know who told you that we do this but we don't, It's against our corporate policy!!"" I told her that this is a regular occurrence and that we have never had such a problem before. She argued with me that she doesn't do this for anyone and that our request would never have been granted at HER CF and that if corporate found out that she did this she would be in a lot of trouble. At this point there was no arguing with her. Every thing we attempted to say was shot down by her. She was so unprofessional. She had no interest in giving us a good guest experience from the start. She was right and that was it!!! We asked her for her business card with every intention of complaining to corporate and as she went to give us the card she just tossed it at us like she was doing us a favor, and then stomped away from the table like the beast that she was. If you are planning on visiting this CF remember a few key things. 1. this place is run by a female dog named, Stephanie Bucciarelli, on a power trip who obviously has no training on how to give customer service. 2. Be prepared for a mediocre experience with an upscale price tag. and 3. get your order of cheesecake to go as to spare yourself from the rudeness that is oozing out of this place. 4. If you have a complaint, voice it, because without feedback issues cannot be known or corrected. Needless to say that my boyfriend and I have not visited CF since. P.S. Many other chains like Houlihan's, Long Horn, Olive Garden, even Maggiano's don't even serve the tentacles or will hold the tentacles with no argument. I don't understand why this caused such a big problem, never has this ever been an issue at any other restaurant establishment no matter what the cost. I would think that with CF's price tag that they would want to cater to their guests and keep them as returning patrons."
Steffie E.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",249,6,2,1.0,1/13/2016,"Can I give ZERO stars? My mom and I used to go here consistently a couple of years ago when I would be back home from college and we always had the best time. We came back here for the first time last Thursday night, and I have been SICK for A WEEK because of FOOD POISONING. I ended up getting the STOMACH FLU. I ordered the ahi tuna salad from the skinny menu and my mom got Renee's Special. We also got the skinny salmon rolls (which they said they ran out of, then they suddenly appeared). Overall, we were unsatisfied with the food and service which has never happened before. I got chills when I got home that night and a slight fever in the morning which I didn't think much of (it is the cold season afterall). My mom felt fine (Thank God) but I have had consistent fevers every 4-5 hours all week (102-103) and have had TWO VISITS TO THE HOSPITAL where I needed IVs for  dehydration because my body was rejecting everything. I eat sushi and raw fish regularly and have never had this reaction before, and honestly this week and my body have been through hell. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.  POINT IS: STAY AWAY. SERVICE SUCKS ANYWAY.  WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING."
Hannah H.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,5,5,4.0,2/21/2015,"The food was very good actually I had the filet mignon and the dulce de leche cheesecake. The food was truly mouth watering. Steak was deliciously savory and the cheesecake was so sweet, perfect for my tastebuds. The reason for subtracting one star is that the waiter was so busy it took him so long just to get us our drinks other than that every else was beautiful. Very nice, very nice"
Tiffany H.,"Manhattan, NY",84,81,16,5.0,8/2/2013,"You know you are going to have the cheesecake, the only hard part 1) where are you going to put it after all the delectable and large portions of  food that somehow made it from the plate to your piehole and 2) which perhaps the hardest part... which cheesecake do you pick?!! I mean they only have like 50 something options to choose from, enough to make your eyes cross and your heart swoon.  (Note just like I don't count the calorie content, I have never actually counted the # of varieties so don't hold me to fact checking)  Pro's Service was great. Standard Cheesecake factory fare.  Con:  Only sad thing is they stopped making the thai chicken pasta :-(.  Always good  food but don't ever look at the calories and if you're diabetic take your insulin before you come. (They do have a healthy options menu...but I haven't ever brought myself to ordering it. It just seems wrong.) Overall: Big portions, come hungry and leave for lunch for tomorrow.  I got lucky and have something sweet to wake up to tomorrow.  Gluttony at its best."
Douglas M.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,16,,5.0,10/8/2016,"Thai lettuce wraps, but the waaaaaiiiiiiiiiiittt like everyone I've been to, from RI to FL."
Krystin B.,"Lodi, NJ",0,22,1,1.0,7/21/2016,"A place I used to call my favorite when I was younger has turned into a place I will never go to again. Not only did I give this Cheesecake a second chance after a terrible experience with undercooked filet mignon 2 years ago BUT I absolutely blame the restaurant for ruining a surprise birthday dinner I planned for my boyfriend. Let's start with the fact that this crazy busy joint on a Wednesday night in the middle of the summer does NOT take reservations. So going in there 2 weeks early in the blistering heat and finding out they don't take reservations was disappointing enough. I had to carry on and plan for my party of 12 to arrive an HOUR early (7PM) and get a table. Well, simple tasks just aren't simple. As I have someone from my party arrive early , the host tells her the table will take an hour to get. ""Perfect,"" I thought. Wrong. Not only did I have to stall my boyfriend until 815 PM but my surprise did not go as planned. Since a party of 12 adults for a birthday was not the restaurants top priority (and 3 parties of 4 is) we show up at 830 and the host says another 20 minutes (after telling my friend 10 more minutes when I was on the way). Well of course we had to ask for a manager and OF COURSE that is when magically an open table for 12 appeared. To compensate for the ruined surprised we got FREE NACHOS (yay [NOT] )! The service was nothing to brag about. The food and the drinks were probably the only thing I was satisfied about. To add to my disappointment, I asked the host who should I speak to about sending a cheesecake to the table for the birthday boy. Not only did I tell the host ""a whole cheesecake"" and that my boyfriend does not like chocolate & to make it a cherry cheesecake, BUT when its time to sing happy birthday, they brought one peice of cake and it was chocolate. One last thing: my friend who came in early, as well as myself, and another person from the party requested seperate checks (to the host, manager, and server). Once that time came our server Shey acted as if it was the end of his cheesecakefactory career to split the checks. Now, I have served tables for over 6 years, I get it, it sucks and its a lot of trouble to do, BUT we were are party of 12 from the ages of 23-30!! We all have jobs and proper morale to know how to TIP SUFFICIENTLY if that's what the server was worried about. Well anyway to wrap it up, this cheesecake (and most likely others) have lost a customer due to terrible service, lack of priority, and because they disregarded each request I had. For a place that you can easily spend 500$ on a full course meal, I suggest going to a mom and pop bar before experience this mess of a business. Good luck"
Elizabeth E.,"Lodi, NJ",20,8,2,5.0,9/13/2016,Great restaurant in town. Excellent food and service. My favorite dish is Crusted chicken Romano and for dessert fresh strawberries cheesecake.
Jessica T.,"Hackensack, NJ",81,34,30,1.0,8/13/2014,"I try to avoid chain restaurants in general but my fiancée and I were looking for a place to grab a drink after shopping and this was the only bar with open seats at the Shops at Riverside.    The beer my date ordered was tapped out so he got something else, no big deal, but still annoying. I ordered a skinny sangria, which tasted fine and I would get again. FYI it was in a wine glass, not a giant goblet or anything, so we were a little surprised to see one beer and one sangria cost us $26 with tip, definitely not worth it in my opinion.     The major issue was actually that the entire bar smelled really gross, like dirty wet rags. It was not the nice night cap we were looking for, it was overpriced and smelly. Definitely not recommended."
Mah S.,"Fort Lee, NJ",5,24,24,3.0,2/26/2016,It worth trying it ! We went two times and tried the pastas. The food quality and portions are good. The Chipotle pasta has a very rich spices and you may not be able to finish your dish.
Benjamin K.,"New York, NY",60,16,12,5.0,9/28/2014,"Every visit here is a great one.  The menu is so plentiful, you don't know where to begin.  We went w the stuffed mushrooms for starters.  Although there on the small plate appetizer page, you get 6.  My friend and I shared, and it was perfect. For my entree I had chicken & biscuits. It's grilled chicken breast, mashed potato, and the flakiest, most delicious biscuits you've ever had, all smothered together in thick gravy. Need I say more! Comfort food at its best!! Drinks are always great here. I usually go w the mojitos, which come in a variety of flavors. Cheesecake Factory will always be on my top 5 list! おいしい  おいしい"
Arthur L.,"Norwood, NJ",2,153,9,4.0,2/1/2015,"For some reason I find eating here a better experience than its more upmarket counterpart  Grand Lux Cafe. For those not caring about calories it is hard to pass on the meatloaf along with the addicting buffalo  bites. Everything seems fresh and well prepared , and I just love the low carb cheesecake ."
Damian D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,3,5.0,7/11/2014,"Love the caesar salad, A+ on service and food temperature, food was served hot.  Would recommend going 2hrs before closing time, atmosphere at that time is like the hallway seen in the movie Drive(2011).  You remember!?  When Carey Mulligan(Irene) sat with Ryan Gosling in their hallway after her ex-boyfriend returned home from jail.  Anyway, I had a great food loving time, yummy."
Sarah P.,"Bergenfield, NJ",6,17,3,2.0,11/1/2015,"I usually love the CF, but this location (Hackensack, NJ) NEVER has what we want! We have been to this location about 3 times in the past two months and every time my husband and I go he ordered the turkey club sandwich. And every time they tell us they are out of it. How difficult is it to keep those ingredients in stock? He's a simple guy and that's all he wanted, yet you can't carry lettuce, tomato, bacon, turkey and bread? When I know most of those ingredients are on other dishes. I understand places get busy and may run out of something. But not three different visits in a two month span. So this location gets a bad review from us not because of service, but because we can't get the food you offer on your menu."
