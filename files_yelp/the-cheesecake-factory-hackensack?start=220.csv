Shema P.,"New York, NY",45,83,47,5.0,8/30/2015,I personally am a fan of Cheesecake Factory but this was my first time at this location. Of course all the same decor. The staff was really nice. Came here with my boyfriend and his parents. His father was not a fan of their food but he enjoyed his jambalaya. My friend ordered Alfredo sauce with pasta and chicken and he did not enjoy what the waiter recommended. He said it was bland and dry. His mother ordered a sandwich which she said was tough. I ordered the farfalle pasta with chicken onions mushroom and peas and it was delicious. That's usually what I order from Cheesecake Factory and I usually  enjoy it. It was extra saucy which I loved even more. I would definitely come back as for the people I'm with I don't think so
Samantha M.,"Wayne, NJ",13,18,,4.0,5/4/2015,"I love this place. They have the best salads and appies!!! Best bread too. However, the take out here is disastrous. I've been working in the mall almost a year and 9/10 time I've taken out from The Cheesecake Factory, there's been an issue. The portions are always off, they always forget things that you've ordered, and it takes a really long time. Service when you're planning on sitting down isn't bad, but just warning you from Thursday-Sunday night, expect to wait 45 minutes or more."
Jessica C.,"Belleville, NJ",28,77,14,2.0,4/24/2015,I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory in the Willowbrook Mall and I think the food and service is much better in Willowbrook. I ordered a dish from the skinnylicious menu (something with beef medallions) that came out dry and charred bc I wanted the well done. I ended up sending it back at the suggestion of the waitress. The manager suggested I order another dish bc the remake would come out the same. I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich. My main complaint is that I was there for almost 2 hours without ordering an appetizer or dessert. The service at Willowbrook is faster and the food is better.  I wouldn't be surprised if they spit in my food bc I have a sore throat today.
Crystal R.,"New York, NY",14,47,3,4.0,8/28/2015,Love the food here in general. The decor is fantastic and the waiters try their best but service can vary. It's a classy place and prices are fair for the portions you get. It's definitely a great go-to when you want good food and can't think of anything. Definitely recommend.
Sanela K.,"Rutherford, NJ",5,11,2,4.0,6/14/2014,Obsessed with the ahi carpaccio dish and lemon drop martini's. The cheesecakes are a must too! I go every so often and never get disappointed..
Wai W.,"Waldwick, NJ",119,448,203,3.0,5/25/2014,Service was friendly and helpful but didn't remember that I asked that my english muffin ahould be served on the side.  This wasn't why I gave my visit 3 stars as the food was nothing special or out of the ordinary even though they had a huge menu. Then again I should know better just by the name and stuck with maybe ordering a slice of cheesecake.  I will maybe visit next time just for the sweets.
David B.,"Englewood, NJ",0,20,,1.0,2/16/2016,Don't bother. 1 hour for fish tacos & kale salad. No explanation or comp until asked.  Yes I know it's not fine dining but half hearted mea culpa while asking for something to ease their error is unacceptable. The management should be let go. As it their responsibility to train staff how to handle kitchen miscues.
Nina S.,"Secaucus, NJ",1,26,47,5.0,8/19/2015,"I have yet to meet a cheesecake I didn't like. The salted caramel is my favorite by far. Chicken costeletta, bang bang chicken, miso salmon, are some of my favorites. Their fruit drinks are also delicious! Try a peach Bellini or the pomegranate mojito! Will always come again and again."
Suzanne G.,"Westwood, NJ",1,29,,4.0,10/23/2015,"Tuna tartar was flavorful, small, quality.  Lettuce wraps with chicken and mushrooms delicious.   Of course, wings, pepperoni pizza and nachos are huge portions and go down easy. Loud but lively at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon."
Jeff W.,"Hillsdale, NJ",92,434,33,4.0,1/19/2014,"It was lunch time and while in the area I decided to settle on this place. I've been to the one in the Palisades Mall so I knew what I was in store for. Server was friendly, not too chatty and didn't mind the fact that it took me about 20 minutes to study the million page menu they hand you....I always do that!  There are way too many decisions to make, and every time....every time!!!....I still have no clue what to get. I usually end up getting my old standby Chicken Bellagio. The last time I had it was in Palisades and it was too dry and nightmarish. However this time it was spot on. Nice and juicy, not overbearing, just delicious. The great part is that you can get a second meal out of their servings. Not a bad thing, but sometimes reheating food like this can completely ruin it.  The only problem I had, their beer fridge for kegs was broken. :( Which meant no draught beer! What kind of country are we coming to?!"
Steven N.,"Hackensack, NJ",71,37,14,5.0,8/7/2015,"What can I say. It's "" The Cheesecake Factory"". Eat slowly, and carefully. Why?? The desserts!! Many types of cakes and of course, Cheesecake!! I like the Pit Beef Dip sandwich. My wife either the chicken picata, or the bang bang chicken and shrimp. The ice tea is phenomenal. Parking can be difficult, but worth it."
Raymond G.,"Manhattan, NY",127,8,,2.0,12/27/2013,"The only reason this place got 2 stars was because of the food. My friends had the macaroni and cheese burger which was amazing. It was smokey, cheesy, and very nice. I had the chicken chili which was alright. It smelled weird but it was creamy, and nice. The service? Was HORRIBLE!!  Our server was Ashely (or Ashlee) it's Friday night and I understand it's busy I work in hospitality but this is completely unacceptable. When we got to our table, it was dirty. We had to ask the table to be cleaned. Then it took forever for the bread to come. We had to ask for straws for our water, rarely was our table asked if we were doing fine. When our entrees came we were happy! :) then my friends asked for water (there were 3 of us) and they both got their waters refilled but my cup was empty and she just kept moving? It's an industry standard to refill a guest water WITHOUT asking. My friends shouldn't have even asked for THEIR water to be refilled.  I wouldn't come here on a Friday. My friend (who was with us tonight) said she came on a Saturday and it was seamless service.  I'm not overreaching here, these are just regular industry standards. I love to tip my server and I have friends who are servers so I get it. It's hard but dirty table? And dirty floor? How clean can everything else be? I wouldn't waste my time but I'm sure others have had a great time. It was honestly just our server."
Calvin W.,"Irvine, CA",162,236,169,4.0,9/9/2012,"The service is good and the food is better.  I usually get a seat, but I sat at the bar today. The popcorn shrimp is in a beer type batter which was awesome. Mini corn dogs were a little oily but delicious. Nachos were okay since the chicken was almost non existant.  Stella on tap is a plus. Turkey club was good, but they use the thicker turkey slices which i don't care for too much, but the bacon was semi crisp.  The bill was a lot more than what I expected though so expect to pay some hard earned cash in here."
Donna A.,"Rutherford, NJ",19,39,63,1.0,1/14/2015,"I do love this place but my experience coming here was a lil different from the last time. The server wasn't attentive and was pretty rude to me and my group. The food came out good but I was stunned at the lack of service we had there. I used to be a waitress when I was younger and no matter the situation, a smile is a must and patience is a virtue. I normally don't say bad things but it was a must. I won't be back at this location anymore."
Jonathan M.,"New Milford, NJ",0,8,,3.0,9/28/2015,"I have been going to cheesecake for years. Its a great date spot but lately it has gone down hill. Past 3 times i went my food was badly burned, they seeved me raw chicken and the waitress denied it was raw, and tha last time i ordered fried zucchini and they were burned n inside were brown. Some hostess dont know anytging about tha menu. On a brighter note the cheesecakes are crazy good! I probably tried atleast everyone and simce have not had any bad ones. My opinion dont sit down and eat take order out cheesecake its much better."
Thomas L.,"Manhattan, NY",195,142,32,1.0,2/16/2015,"YES! My cheeseburger tasted like it was cooked 2 nights ago. I will save the time and read to get to the point. My lunch was salty and ugly, and pasta taste so salty we couldn't even finish 1/4 of it. #struggleisreal and #nogreatcomebackhere."
Alyssa N.,"Alpine, NJ",0,60,,4.0,2/1/2016,"I love it here!  The food is great, the service is awesome and the cleanliness is appreciated.  My only wish was that the bar area was bigger.  There is almost always a wait, so it would be beneficial to have a large bar area where customers can sit and have a drink while they wait.  Other than that, I enjoy coming here."
India U.,"River Edge, NJ",14,71,50,2.0,5/15/2015,"I am surprised that people actually think this place is in anyway shape or form good / fresh food!!! I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner in years but recently went for a friends birthday.  First thing I noticed that the menu was 14 pages long, 14! How can freshness be a priority when you have that many items on your menu?  I ordered a spicy pineapple margarita.. Aweful.. So bad that I didn't drink it and our waitress kindly took it off our bill and said yeah, I don't know why they keep it on the menu everyone hates it.  I ordered from the lighter side of the menu and got the ahi tuna salad. What a disappointment. The tuna slices were sad looking, and the vinaigrette on the salad was a little over powering.  Bad food seemed to be the theme of the evening.  The table to my left sent back their appetizers, and the table to the side of us sent back one of their entrees.. No one seemed happy with their food!!The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because I tried a couple spoonfuls of my friends cheesecake and it was very good.  I highly doubt I'll go back.."
Kay B.,"Hasbrouck Heights, NJ",2,22,4,4.0,9/19/2013,I like eating here because it's usually pretty consistent .. only once I came and ordered the free range chicken and they used wayyyyy too much lemon like i felt like I was eating one of those sour candies that makes your face pucker up lol.. (i had ordered that lemon chicken 2 previous times and it was great but the last time it was too much lemon)  but usually I can count on them that my food is gonna taste fresh and good... they have such a huge selection too so that's great
Burak O.,"Hoboken, NJ",143,5,,5.0,5/13/2016,"Great food. Love the appetizers!! Calamari is amazing. Over all great food, big menu, big portions and reasonable prices."
