Gracie J.,"Irvine, CA",216,682,329,4.0,12/20/2013,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factory - large portions, large caloric intake, insanely large crowds. It's decent food, but I have always been confused by the chain's popularity (I wouldn't wait 2+ hrs for a seat here, but others do).  I like eating here, but not if I have to wait more than half an hour (as is usually the case). It is more 'affordable' than Houston's and the new seafood place right next door, though."
Sukeerthi A.,"Hackensack, NJ",26,29,14,2.0,7/2/2015,Horrible service. They made us sit in the corner where I was getting some weird smell. Later my friend realized there was some sticky liquid on the floor maybe cold drink and his shoes got spoiled. It's pretty expensive for the service we got but the pasta was not bad.
Nicole P.,"Lodi, NJ",970,321,563,2.0,10/31/2014,"Ok so the foods good. The service is shotty. Theres always a wait and I would rather go to the Grand luxe cafe. I have never tried the cheesecakes. But I have tried their very watered down cocktails- not a fan. The food tastes great but leaves a bloated feeling almost always, even if you have a salad.... Not sure if I am such a fan these days...."
Jersey's C.,"Teaneck, NJ",2,33,3,5.0,7/20/2015,Went on Saturday night and it was just amazing.  The wait was 10 minutes but worth it.  The Steak Diane was to die for.  My husband loved the shrimp scampi.  Only issue was the lady next to me had 3 kids  under the age of 3 crying.  Wow that was annoying since I left my rugrats at home to enjoy a semi quiet meal lol.  After my first drink I zoned the kids out and had a blast.
Eric S.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",1667,173,38,4.0,2/15/2014,"I don't think I have ever been disappointed with a meal at this location.  This is probably the only one I have been to in fact.  The other day I joined an old friend for lunch and tried a new item on the menu; Greek Beef Kabobs.  It was really good.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  They were little ground beef kabob meatballs with mini flatbread wrapped with tomato, feta and tzatziki.  I look forward to going back and enjoying again soon..."
David G.,"Maywood, NJ",49,145,27,3.0,11/14/2013,"I had never been to the cheesecake factory prior to this weekend and it was pretty much as expected. The food was decent - bread was undercooked but my Smokehouse BBQ Burger was acceptable. The meat wasn't flavorful but the toppings made up for it, although at nearly 100 g of fat that shit better be delicious. Our server was awesome though. Super helpful and into her job. I was kicking myself after I left for not leaving her more than the 20% tip that I did."
Nelson B.,"Rutherford, NJ",0,33,,3.0,2/25/2014,"I only gave it three stars because I truly like their food-even though it always upsets my stomach. Most dishes are served in some kind of a butter or cream sauce which is tasty as heck but does me no justice. I also assume the calories aren't the best. Service is hit or miss-just depends on who you get and the mood they are in. The wait is ridiculous and I always find myself asking why I choose to wait an hour and a half to be sat for dinner. I guess it's not the restaurants fault-people like it and show up to eat-but perhaps they should expand the seating area or have a lobby where you can order appetizers while you wait.  So my experiences here have always been a 50/50. If the food is good, the service is not. I usually find the servers to be absent more than they should be during the course of the meal. I've had to get out of my seat to get servers before. Eh. Last thing-I hate the seating-its not super personal. Booths are great-their tables leave you no room for privacy. Kind of annoying."
Jim U.,"Washington, DC",666,1303,3041,3.0,4/30/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory makes my very short list of chain restaurants that don't suck.  It's not fine dining, but if you are stuck in a homogenized, American suburb somewhere, this is the place you should probably choose. This particular location was rather large.  The very high ceilings and outdoor seating only increased the effect.  It is so refreshing to eat outside of the city, because you can easily find a table with plenty of room around you and not have people sitting so close by.  In short, it was relaxing. The menu was ridiculously long.  They have specialties that number into the hundreds, I dare say.  Being Easter Sunday, I thought I would try for something with ham in it, but no such luck.  Out of all the very many selections, they don't do ham steak, even on Easter.  Oh well, a passing thought really.  I decided to settle in on the shrimp and chicken gumbo (1530 calories).  The dish had so much color.  There was a large mound of white rice in the middle surrounded by a soupy gumbo.  There was plenty of nicely cooked shrimp, green onions, and tomatoes, but no sign of any chicken.  There was trace amounts of andouille sausage, but it did not have much flavor.  Overall, it was okay.  The dish had a lot of flavor, but it wasn't seasoned as nearly as heavily as I would have liked for a gumbo.  The portion size was more than fair for the price though.     I did stick around for dessert and stayed for the obligatory cheesecake.  Another long menu was presented to me.  I opted for the Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake (1330 calories).  This particular cheesecake has the dubious honor of having the most calories out of any of the selections at Cheesecake Factory.  Lucky me.  At least it was pretty good though.  It couldn't have been larger really.  It had just about everything in it too.  There was cake, fudge, peanut butter, cheesecake, a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream, and so forth.  It was a sinfully delicious way to shorten my lifespan, really.  I loved it.  Outside of New York City, I would probably rely on the Cheesecake Factory for my cheesecake indulgences, because they actually are pretty good at it.   4 stars for the cheesecake 3 stars for the food 3.5 stars overall"
Stephanie S.,"Miami Beach, FL",25,24,2,5.0,8/21/2015,Always packed but that is because the food is always good. The cheesecake is fabulous. It is their specialty. Was that hard to figure out?! Lol
Myron F.,"Wanaque, NJ",49,1,,1.0,7/19/2015,The first glass of water we received had a fruitfly in it.   We then received  a dirty glass.  The last thing we got was a piece of cheesecake with paper in it. I would never recommend this restaurant go to willow brook
Maria M.,"Wyckoff, NJ",81,110,62,4.0,5/22/2013,"I can always count on good food, great cocktails, and of course yummy cheesecake galour each time we come here.  There seem to always be a wait for tables so we usually just grab a seat in the bar area.  The staff are always friendly and energetic.  Always a good time. Cheers!!!"
Meena N.,"Little Ferry, NJ",305,51,200,4.0,11/25/2014,"I usually get there pastas, Fried Mac cheese Burger , Factory Burger, and etc.. Always good. Most of the time their customer service is good. I love their drinks!"
Elena V.,"Palisades Park, NJ",0,6,6,4.0,5/23/2015,"Love that place! I have been there 4 or 5 times and not once I have been disappointed. Food is always delicious and service is great. The only con is that is extremely loud,the clattering is a bit annoying,but as soon as I take a bite of their avocado eggrolls or a sip of their delicious strawberry lemonade,everything is fine by me."
Logan M.,"Glen Rock, NJ",328,139,31,2.0,6/25/2013,"This restaurant is almost identical to the Grand lux cafe and both fail in my book. While the bread that they serve is delicious, everything else in my opinion falls flat. I've tried sandwiches, burgers, steaks, pastas and salads and nothing to me really stood out as delicious. It's not a horrible spot for dinner but its overpriced and nothing there keeps my wanting to come back. I think its more of a novelty place, the portions are usually large and the staff is friendly, but the food is seriously boring."
Jeff B.,"Secaucus, NJ",29,6,8,5.0,7/25/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory they have good food, good service a lot of option in the bar and the best dish is the hibachi steak. I'm not a big meat fan but this steak is just art. Our waiter today was very courteous and nice, gave us bread 3 times and the food came fresh like always! A+"
Yael S.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,145,43,3.0,2/14/2015,"well, it's the Cheesecake Factory. it's that diabetes-inducing, heart-clogging wonderland of America. and I love every minute of their food. cheesecake is my reason for living. but the service... my Gd. I couldn't believe it. my friend and I ordered a ton of food, as all sane people would, and the server actually called us fat. now, I don't know if he was just straight up trying to get fired, but my friend and I just sat there, too stunned to say anything."
Sar P.,"New York, NY",323,577,152,5.0,6/25/2011,I love this location! it is At the Shops at Riverside so you get less high school kids lurking around! (I have tried the Menlo Park location but it is absolutely horrible - food and service) The food is always fresh and the staff is very pleasant!! not a long wait unless you go on a saturday! The food options are plentyful and portions definitely allow you to take out so it is value for money with great taste!
Anonymous Yelp Critic 21 ..,"Saddle Brook, NJ",231,264,59,4.0,3/5/2013,"A place like this is good to come to every once and a while. Whether it's with just another person, or a group of 4, this place has you covered. The food isn't bad, the portions are pretty big, the only flaw that I experienced, was that they get busy, so the waiters tend to pass by every once and a while. We were flagging waiters down left and right before ours finally came back to our table. We went in for a quick lunch, place wasn't too crowded, and we still got stuck there."
JJ P.,"Washington, MI",0,16,,1.0,12/31/2014,Garbage!  How does a place voted most unhealthiest restaurant in the country stay in business.  I had bugs in my drink and vegetables so overlooked and processed then should be locked up
Farah Rose N.,"Dumont, NJ",291,143,114,4.0,8/18/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  For a chain restaurant, this place is awesome.   I absolutely love the bread they serve, especially the whole wheat.  The menu is endless (sometimes overwhelming) but offers something for everyone.  I've tried a lot of dishes in the past few years and I've never had anything I didn't like.  Service is always great at this location and mixed drinks are good as well.  Desserts are also amazing, if I make it to that point!  The one downside is the wait is always crazy long if you come at busy hours ie weekend dinner-time and they don't take reservations but it's right in the mall so you can shop or go for a walk while waiting!  If you haven't been to the cheesecake factory yet, I highly recommend giving it a try!"
