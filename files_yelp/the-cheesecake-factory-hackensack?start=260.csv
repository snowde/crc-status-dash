John S.,"Secaucus, NJ",121,81,10,5.0,3/7/2015,Always a long wait nut well worth it. Had the chicken and biscuits today. It was fantastic. A must very
Myla G.,"Carshalton, London, United Kingdom",37,88,65,3.0,1/11/2015,Long wait to get a table. It is a very noisy place and parking is impossible. Large menu and food is fresh and big portions but quality was average. Drinks are pricey. For the money and cost. there are lots of better places to dine in.
Princess T.,"Passaic, NJ",8,30,,5.0,10/25/2013,"Fabulous restaurant!  Great food (large portions), great service!"
Evan T.,"Dumont, NJ",0,27,12,1.0,5/20/2015,Not sure how guacamole ended up brown on my take out order ...not the first time I had a bad order here
David V.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",59,24,58,4.0,4/8/2015,"I like this place a lot . The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the feeling I get after eating here .. It's the feeling of dying great food and great environment .Love the place though , just needs work on the wait time ."
Ben C.,"Tappan, NY",102,295,1463,4.0,1/6/2015,"Celebrated my birthday here and went off with a bang. Didnt have a long wait,sat next to the bar and ordered a few appetizers. The Fried Calamari was pretty good. Not rubbery or too chewy and served with the standard cocktail marinara and the oh so good Garlic Dip which is a twist. The Crab Cakes were so-so, not too deep baked and not too burnt,served on top of crispy noodles.I then went out my comfort zone and ordered the Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip with several grilled slices of bread. The dip was good however i tasted more artichoke and cheese with a hint of crab. Next were the main courses. The Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon was juicy soaked in lemon sauce with 3-4 pieces of asparagus and a big heaping of mashed potatoes and with a side of shrimp scamipi, if you pick the combo for an extra dollar. The mrs had Steak Diane. I also ordered the Filet Mignon. It came out not as fancy as the other two entrees. came in a single dish, just the steak sitting in its juices with a side of fries and two pieces of onion rings. Cutting into it was smooth and the tasted is soft and juicy. Not too tough and ended it with a slice of original Cheese cake. A perfect way to end my birthday."
Rafael B.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,,5.0,3/9/2016,"I have been @ cheesecake factory over 100 times and really enjoy the food, the decoration of the restaurant. My wife and I find this exceptional. However we have an experience yesterday that we didn't like. we arrive at the restaurant just after opening hour 11Am and my wife ask the host if we can be seated next to the window, there were only 3 other table occupied at that time. The host explain to us,nicely that those table are for more than 2 person.That's fine if is a general police of the restaurant. However what I find insulting is that the same host seated 4 different couples in the tables by the windows. If there is a rule I understand but if is apply to all costumers, no only for the ones that fell like. everybody is there to enjoy good food and have a good time.  I drove from NYC to enjoy one of my favorite place. Its only fare to say t to be that I only want treated the same as any other pay costumer. We never ask for anything else.  if anybody wish to contact me"
Anatoli L.,"Stamford, CT",80,263,233,4.0,4/6/2011,"Should be 4.5 stars Considering that Cheesecake Factory is a chain, I was pleasantly surprised. We came there for lunch. Excellent service, got very good recommendations. Luau salad was outstanding, with very delicious dressing. Chicken Chili was also very tasty.  Will definitely come back."
Richie R.,"Paramus, NJ",3,80,,4.0,2/1/2015,Been her a few times & I am never disappointed. Love the food & environment. Weekends get crowded so I have my personal assistant always make my reservation. Want a free personal assistant? Reach out 
Talia G.,"Rutherford, NJ",103,29,,1.0,11/9/2015,"Went here a while back. Ordered a salad, don't recall the shard of metal in it being on the menu, though. 0/10 wouldn't recommend."
Dee K.,"Hackensack, NJ",4,11,3,4.0,8/23/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory restaurant-chain has one of the best interiors of any restaurants I've ever eaten at. The murals on the ceiling are beautiful combined with the sand-colored tone throughout the place conjures up a feeling of being transported to a des(s)ert oasis - but with lots of cheesecakes!  Food-wise, I ordered the lunch carbonara but it didn't quite do it for me. I kept thinking about the pasta carbonara I had at another restaurant in Central NJ the whole entire time and how I wish I were eating that one instead. It might be because the carbonara at the other restaurant was made with prosciutto which made it more tasty but here at the Cheesecake Factory they just use tiny bacon flakes. I would skip this next time and suggest to the restaurant to consider putting prosciutto in their carbonara dishes because it would be a wonderful improvement. The peppery-ness of the lunch carbonara here was good though, keep that. I'm giving this review 4 stars despite so-so carbonara because of the service I received from my waiter today. Super attentive and was able to handle all the constant little requests my party and I had today. Overall, I had a good time and will come back again!"
Samuel F.,"Hackensack, NJ",1,7,3,4.0,9/21/2013,"The cheese cake factory is a pretty classy joint. Always a wait, but that's a sign of a good restaurant.  The place is a tad high but the level of service and quality food make it worth it. The bread is great! I really enjoy all the baked goods too! Must try for any one in the area! The price keeps it from 5"
Amy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",471,356,301,5.0,9/28/2010,"*Must Try: Chicken Piccata (Sautéed Chicken Breast with Lemon Sauce, Mushrooms, and Capers. Served with Angel Hair Pasta.) And Chicken and Biscuits (Sauteed Chicken Breasts Covered with Gravy. Comes with Mashed Potatoes, Vegetables, and Buttermilk Biscuits.) *Dessert: Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Tiramisu. (Not the cheesecake, this one was under 'Specialty Desserts'.) Can't go wrong with their dessert here. *you can't compare Junior's to Cheesecake Factory. Both are amazing. But can we please bring a CF closer to NYC?"
Sera S.,"Cheshire, CT",0,15,,1.0,9/27/2015,"WORST CHEESECAKE FACTORY EVER!!!! We went there on a Saturday night hoping to enjoy some good food. They told us that we would wait for 15-20 mins. And we waited. In 15 mins they called us and showed us our table. When we sat at our table our waiter came and took brought us our drinks. Just when we thought that the service was great, our waiter disappeared and didn't come back for 30 mins!!!! We didn't want to wait for 30 mins so we talked to the host saying that nobody took our orders. She called her manager and when the manager came he said that he was talking to our waiter, since there was a problem with him. We didn't like the manager's attitude, since he looked like he didn't care. We asked to be seated at another table. Our second table was a disaster, too. Our waitress took our orders, and brought our food just on time. I ordered pasta, and I asked if she could bring some parmesan with the pasta. While she was putting the parmesan on the pasta, her hand slipped and parmesan got all over me!!!! She started laughing like it was funny. All in all waiters in this place are rude, and food is the worst of all the cheesecake factories in U.S.  DO NOT GO THERE!!!"
Raul A.,"Saint Louis, MO",125,335,209,3.0,6/10/2013,"My two favorites of Cheesecake Factory (other than the cheesecakes, duh) are their Mexican offerings... The Grande Burrito is MASSIVE.  Big enough (seriously) to share or if you plan to do dinner and then a lunch.  I can't imagine people having it all in one sitting, if you've done so, God Bless. The other is the chicken stuffed enchiladas.  Again, enough to share but great flavor and those tamale cakes are fantastic. Favorite cheesecake is White Chocolate Raspberry. Service was particularly good during this visit, waitress was very friendly. Side note, whoever designed that hallway to the bathrooms is an idiot."
Jessica S.,"Newton, NJ",64,8,2,5.0,2/11/2015,How can anyone not like the Cheesecake Factory.  Service is fast.  One drawback is I wish we could walk right in instead of having to wait....
kushal p.,"New Brunswick, NJ",1,2,,5.0,1/5/2015,Awesome food. Great service. Have to wait about 15 mins for seating and bit expensive but worth it.
Brenda F.,"Garfield, NJ",0,13,,4.0,9/26/2014,"I had my first yummy experience at The Cheesecake Factory about three months ago and was pleased. :) The portions were huge and the prices were fair for what you get. As for the cheesecake, it's darn good!  My birthday is in a couple of months so guess where I want to go? :)"
Theresa B.,"Manhattan, NY",36,44,19,5.0,11/18/2014,I love the Cheese Cake Factory! Very nice and clean atmosphere. Great customer service and you truly get your money worth. I can't leave without purchasing two slices of cheese cake.
Carmelina E.,"New York, NY",0,16,33,2.0,2/24/2015,"Where's the service?? I came yesterday and waited 12minutes for a juice, pasta was dry and cold!!! Today my nephew wanted their pizza so I came back, the soup was ice cold by the time I received it!!! Wtf?? This place is empty why can't I get my food while it's still warm??? Seriously get it together Cheesecake Factory"
