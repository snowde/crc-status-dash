Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,3.0,5/3/2014,First time in a long time at this location. Food is good. Beverages kind of weak. I had the shrimp scampi. Yummy!!
Nick C.,"North Arlington, NJ",12,65,41,4.0,11/7/2014,Big fan of cheesecake factory . Make sure to come to this location we have been to the one at willobrooke  mall 2 and had some terrible service and bad food. The avocado egg rolls alone are worth the trip. We have had everything from cobb and bbq chicken salads which are huge portions and always great. Burgers are awesome the mushroom swiss is always a good choice and when you order it rare they actually cook it that way ! My wife loves the farfalle pasta with chicken and garlic. Cuban sandwich the list goes on and on and the Oreo cheese cake and the Adams cheese cake have been my faves lately . If your in there area and want a good meal a good drink and good service stop in. They do get crazy busy most night especially weekends  but its worth the wait
Jenna U.,"Mahwah, NJ",376,378,49,4.0,5/8/2013,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory?  This restaurant really has it going on.  From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, you have an amazing time and experience.  The atmosphere is great, the servers really know their stuff and the food (especially the cheesecake) is to die for!"
Divya M.,"Jersey City, NJ",26,161,12,4.0,9/29/2014,"I love it.. all the appetizers, entree.. they have so many varieties and the best part is dessert! I like it so much here"
Working M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",1,5,,2.0,12/19/2014,It just keeps getting worse. And i cant tell if my tolerance for mediocre food is just lower or the quality is just going down. Which is wierd b/c its in a snazzy mall. Pasta alfredo was so salty. Spaghetti was bland. Chicken fingers were fine but nothing special. Buffalo wings were actually decent. Not worth the price.
Stephanie K.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",34,68,16,5.0,9/30/2014,Food is always delicious. Service was slower than most cheesecake factories I've visited.
Josh C.,"Mahwah, NJ",195,211,142,3.0,5/2/2013,"Standard cheesecake factory food, so-so service I've been to this particular cheesecake factory a couple of times. You know what to expect when you visit one. On my last visit I had the veggie burger with a side salad which was excellent. I had this based off of another visit in which someone else had ordered it. I would never typically order a veggie burger but this is the best that they come. I actually didn't get dessert on this occasion but I think that speaks for itself. The service was a little slow and it took about 10 minutes to get our check at the end of the meal. Also, my water glass sat empty for quite a while.  Overall, if you like cheesecake factory, this one will do just fine."
Diana Z.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",19,21,13,1.0,10/3/2014,"It took 15 minutes to get through to place an order, was put on hold for 10 minutes and had to call back several times. Then when arrived could not get through main line and  when called curb side pick up line. 201 488 7835 nobody answered. Called again and when about to be placed on hold again asked  for manager. He said curb side pick up phone line does not exist. When I asked why it's on their website he said it's not up to him and that he will call General Manager. To me at that point I  did not want to come back and if I did not have a gift certificate from my son, I would turn away during my one hour adventure many times. That's ridiculous that such a big famous brand chain has this low level of customer service, miscommunications, no focus on how to deliver a smooth order and purchase transactions."
Scott M.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",0,11,,5.0,1/8/2016,"See a lot of reviews saying the wait is too long. They must be doing something right, I know when I go there plan on waiting a half hour. The food selection is great and the prices fair. They seem to have plenty of staff to keep things moving as quickly as possible. I never had a bad meal there."
N G.,"New York, NY",0,9,,1.0,11/23/2015,"Always a super long wait time and extremely chaotic inside. Even after the buzzer goes off to tell you that your seat is ready, there was another 10+ mins wait until we were finally seated. Our water took forever to arrive. Took a long time for the waiter to come around to get drink orders. When we finally got to place our order which included a turkey burger, we were told that they were out of turkey. With a menu that extensive, running out of anything was a complete surprise and a total disappointment. Service was meh which is consistent with my experiences at this location. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
Victoria D.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,2,,2.0,6/15/2015,"Sunday lunch-Crispy Cuban Rolls, very good as always- the server who we've had previously, very nice. Margherita pizza and interaction with the manager, not great. The pizza was dry and tasteless, if you want similar ingredients order the Flat Bread with cheese, tomato and basil-very tasty. We ordered Ultimate Margaritas not too much ice (hate when drinks get watery), these are normally delicious. Drinks arrived in the smallest daiquiri glasses we've ever seen so we asked the server if this was the correct drink and she stated we ordered regular, not Ultimate Margaritas as we have in the past. She offered to exchange the drinks. The manager then came to our table to ask what the problem was. He proceeded to explain that when you order a drink with less ice, you get a glass that is not filled, just as ordering a soda with less ice you will get less soda. We were shocked he came over as this was already resolved. We explained that we know what to expect when limiting ice as we always order drinks this way so they don't get watery and we ordered this very drink a week prior at Cheescake. We further explained that the issue was a regular not an Ultimate was ordered. He said okay and again mentioned the glasses would not be filled. Ultimately, the Ultimate Margaritas arrived with not limited ice but only 2 ice cubes and warm...SMH. So, not only were the pizza and drinks unenjoyable but that interaction made us uncomfortable."
Andrew L.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",151,138,190,1.0,8/24/2012,"Eating here is like driving into NYC and eating at TGIF in Times Square.  Service is short-handed and getting there is hell thanks to NJ traffic.  Parking lot is almost always full.  Their cheesecake is nothing special and the food is over-loaded with fat(butter/oil), sugar and salt... but this place is bursting at the seams at all times.   This place makes me lose faith in humanity."
Jennifer F.,"Manhattan, NY",230,694,1107,5.0,9/21/2014,"Yum yum yum. Everything I've ever tried from their insanely extensive menu has been delicious. The pasta dishes are my favorite. You must get the fried Mac & Cheese appetizer; I get this every single time I go. The prices are good and the portions are huge (enough to share with someone else). Not to mention, the cheesecake is one of a kind."
Bernie P.,"Little Ferry, NJ",0,1,,1.0,12/13/2015,I ordered food to pick up at 9:30 and I was told that it will take 20 minutes. It is now 10:09 and I'm still waiting on line for the cashier to pick up my order.she went inside the kitchen and have not come back
Joel P.,"Leander, TX",9,22,30,4.0,8/18/2014,"Definitely try the seafood/chicken gumbo if you're not afraid of spicy food! The calamari appetizer is surprisingly very fresh. Of all the pastas on the menu, our top pick is the Garlic Noodles because it's the least heavy. Our favorite dessert is the Godiva cheesecake."
Anthony F.,"West New York, NJ",6,114,147,2.0,7/27/2014,"Food wasnt anything to write home about thats for sure.  Would not go back again.  Sorry, I enjoyed you in Boston..........."
Fatima S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,,5.0,12/5/2015,Amazing service and amazing food! Have been here countless times and it's always a good visit! Servers are very prompt and make sure you're satisfied! 5 stars all the way
Lyra B.,"Oak Ridge, NJ",0,27,1,1.0,8/3/2013,"Extremely overpriced; I bought a piece of the chocolate truffle cake in the To-Go section, and they gave a FOURTH of what they serve in the restaurant. I pointed this out to the server slicing the cake, and he apologized and handed me another piece that was still about the same size. Do not waste your money here; the quality is poor, and you certainly do not get even a fourth of what you paid for."
K E.,"Teaneck, NJ",4,14,,3.0,7/24/2013,"The food is okay, but definitely not worth the typically long wait and price. On the weekend you need a reservation unless you plan on waiting several hours for a seat. I normally go for the cheesecake, which doesn't require sitting down and doesn't have as long a wait. The 30th anniversary cheesecake is my favorite. However, as the desserts are fairly expensive I don't make a habit of coming here. Overall the place isn't worth the time you spend trying to eat there, but every once in a while it's fine."
Whitney P.,"New York, NY",10,40,39,5.0,9/14/2014,"Took my mother here for the first time. Our waiter was fantastic! We ordered the dynamite shrimp and firecracker salmon appetizers. Everything was delicious and our waiter made every effort to make sure my mom had a great experience.  We had the red velvet cheesecske for dessert and as usual, it never disappoints. Great experience,  will definitely be back."
