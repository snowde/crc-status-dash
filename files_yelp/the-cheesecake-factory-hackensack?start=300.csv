Ashley W.,"Belleville, NJ",143,96,9,3.0,6/6/2012,Love their cheesecake and mixed drinks... Especially the tropical martini. YUMMM. I was really disappointed when they got rid of the tres leches cheesecake. Their menu is large and food is tasty. However the service is lacking here sometimes and if you come on a weekend evening prepare to wait up to two hours even if they tell you 45 minutes
Juliette J.,"Fort Lee, NJ",228,389,475,3.0,10/26/2010,"I avoid this place like a plague and only go there for luncheons and get togethers. I only awarded it 3-stars because the food is pretty decent, unlike their 'cheesecake'. Good god, their cheesecake is awful. All I taste is sugar and crust! Terrible flavor, terrible texture, ugh ugh ugh! Don't get me started on their Red Velvet Cheesecake. Blasphemy!   Maybe if I lived in the sticks, I would be willing to put up with the ridiculously long wait times and obnoxiously loud setting that makes for a very frustrating dining experience. There are too many gems in the area. Plus NYC is a stone throw away. Simply not worth it!"
Subilak K.,"Yarmouth, MA",26,42,54,4.0,10/24/2014,I can actually say I have never been to a cheesecake factory where I've actually been disappointed and this place holds true to that rule. The parking can be a little difficult at times but this place is always booming with a nice mixed crowd. Food is consistent. Service is as well.
Amp R.,"River Edge, NJ",0,26,,4.0,8/14/2014,I give this place a 4 stars just because I like their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.. Awesome dish.. could never go wrong on that one.. They have nice shrimp appetizers.. I think Bang Bang shrimp or Dynamite Shrimp... The cocktails are pretty nice and they have lots of variety.. I dont like parking in this mall... Unless you go after 10pm you are bound to be out of luck for parking..
Paola W.,"Danbury, CT",152,130,922,2.0,2/8/2012,"My usual is the Teriyaki Chicken and it's okay. I am not a big cheese cake fan so my only reason coming to this restaurant is for the AMAZING, and I can't stress this enough - AMAZING sweet corn tamale cakes. I absolutely love them and they take me back to my country."
Danny R.,"Clifton, NJ",7,3,,1.0,12/26/2011,"Visited the Hackensack CheeseCakeFactory for my birthday, and unfortunately my worse experience of all CheeseCakeFactory I've ever been too! Gave us a wait time of 1-1:30 hours, and we're seated after a 2:15-2:20 min wait! Well after the horrible wait time we had all the time to look through the menu, so we all already knew what we were all gonna order. We all got our meals but my wife who ordered a Salad! Ok, apology accepted, it was on the house. Well to my surprise, I ordered the Chicken Marsala and started chewing on what I thought was hard dry pasta. Well ended up being a strip of plastic! That was a wrap!  Can't say that all are bad, but this one is probably one that I'll never return to again!"
Emma T.,"New Milford, NJ",15,7,1,4.0,7/5/2014,My husband and I had our wedding anniversary dinner here. It was a fun experience. The food was plentiful and we didn't have to wait for a table thanks to their special seating area.
Mega M.,"Jackson, NJ",65,452,,2.0,8/31/2011,"OVERRATED! The lines in this place are way too long and not worth it just to have cheesecake. Its pretty good, but I have had better elsewhere.  The service is also very sloppy and organized. They are very busy but the service people don't seem able to handle the large amount of customers. You can find better elsewhere"
Christian L.,"Bergenfield, NJ",57,31,9,5.0,2/17/2014,"Pasta Davinci is glorious. Horrible wait on busy nights, but well worth it :)"
Yasmin R.,"Teaneck, NJ",225,274,170,1.0,11/21/2011,"I've tried cheesecake from Cheescake Factory and they really need to change the name because they don't have it.  The texture is awful, the taste is tangy, and the appearance is just not enticing to the palate.   I wouldn't feed this to my dog, probably give it the runs."
Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,2.0,7/17/2012,"First of all, this mall is in serious need of a few hundred more parking spaces. Good luck finding one when it's busy. Rather than wait for a table here, because there always seems to be an evening wait, I opted for takeout. Their website advertises a seamless curbside experience, but this requires a phone call to notify them you've arrived. And that'll only happen if you've managed to actually find a space in a ""designated pick up spot"". I waited a solid 10 minutes (the max limit for the pickup spots) but NO ONE left or came outside during that time frame. Fed up & impatient, I parked on the opposite side of the mall. Sure, you can have someone wait in the car for you right at the front, but in my opinion the narrow road makes navigating around your car a little difficult for other drivers. When I've dined in I've always thought the atmosphere is noisy, the tables are cramped, the table service is not bad, but not very good either, with the exception of those behind the takeout counter. They've got it down pat. Drinks & desserts could be worth the rare visit for me, but not the food. With an endless menu, much of it tastes mass produced to me, like cafeteria food. You're lucky if you choose wisely because it's a hit or miss list of stuff. And expect to wait long for whatever you want among the hungry shoppers here, from a parking space to a slice of cheesecake."
Jennifer L.,"Windermere, FL",290,349,259,3.0,12/14/2011,"Not a huge fan of the place but like someone else said, it's an ok option when at the mall.  Although I'd rather pick Houston's in heartbeat.   The menu is way too large that it's obvious they can't do all those dishes well.  If it was paired back, it'd be much better.   I've been ordering from the 'healthier' menu lately since I think Cheesecake is always rated in the worst category in terms of healthy choices.   Service has usually been decent, although it ALWAYS takes forever when asking for something extra like ketchup or dressing.   Obviously the cheesecake is pretty damn good though.  I'll splurge and split a slice with a few friends every once in awhile!"
Kaelly B.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,4,,3.0,7/21/2015,Wish this place had more of a variety. Also not the cleanest - much rather Grand Lux - but aren't they the same? Haha I enjoy coming here with my family
Jen And Chris P.,"Richmond, VA",1,8,,3.0,2/22/2014,"What we ordered: - Dynamite shrimp, yum! (especially the chipotle sauce) - Fried calamari, yum! - Pasta Da Vinci, ok (two of us liked it, the other two of us were meh about the sauce) - Crispy chicken costoletta, yum! - Grilled mahi mahi special, BIG FAT NO... - Key lime cheesecake, yum! - Oreo dream extreme cheesecake, yum! Food: 3/4 stars Everything was pretty tasty. The appetizers and cheesecakes in particular are delicious. Our main complaint was the ""grilled mahi mahi special."" The dish came with two small pieces of fish, while the other 2/3 of our $21.95 plate was mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli (most which were yellowing and looked unfresh). The fish tasted OK, and was only slightly better after slathered with lemon sauce. Do not recommend this dish in particular. Value: 2 stars Portions are large, but still way overpriced. Definitely unhappy about how much we paid for the mahi mahi. Service: 3 stars The wait to get a table is way too long (especially on weekends! We came Saturday at 2:30 and had a ~30 minute wait for a party of 4), and the waiting area is crowded and has limited seating. Parking is also a pain in the butt. However, our waiter was great- informative, attentive and not too overbearing. The food also came out pretty quickly.  Ambiance: 3 stars Clean, well-lighted, pretty average décor. Not one of our favorite restaurants (especially because of the crowds and long wait times), but often a last resort when we can't think of where else to go."
Rishi P.,"Dumont, NJ",18,42,30,1.0,10/28/2013,"Disappointed Good: We were seated immediately since it was just me and my wife BAD: The Server definitely does not like his JOB and should probably not be in the service industry, it's not for everyone, I get it. I go to this specific Cheesecake fairly often and have always had a great experience but not Today, NO SIR. The Server comes to our table does not tell us about the Specials, does not care to ask us about beverages and walks away taking our order as a favor to us. He comes back a few minutes later with 2 glasses of water and say ""Did you say you wanted water"" No Sherlock I wanted a drink but you did not ask.  My Wife wanted mash potatoes as a side order which never showed, the Alvarado Egg rolls seemed like they had been kept on the side for a while before it made it to our table, they were skinny and soggy. The rest of the dinner was ok, cause the Chicken did not show up to work and definitely was missing in my dish, but by then my wife and I just wanted to eat and get out.  We asked for a take out box which showed up after a wait and without a bag. All in all I don't think the Server deserved a tip but we still left one.  Cheesecake of Hackensack, I will give you one more chance to Wow me after which you're off the list permanently."
John C.,"Newburgh, NY",0,21,,3.0,7/15/2015,Food is god. This store seemed really noisy. Maybe the clientele here is the problem. Usual food but the server w a s lackluster. Like most the store was busy at lunch
Monica B.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,16,1,1.0,12/11/2014,I will never go back to the Cheesecake Factory at The River Side Square mall in Hackensack again after witnessing the bartender sticking his finger in a customers drink to serve to a customer that sent back her drink it. A few servers watched and laughed. When I reported the incident management on all levels they where condescending to me and blew off the incident. It's a shame it was on of my favorite places. I will now give Houston's my business.
Eileen G.,,4,24,,4.0,4/5/2015,"T went there and had a cheeseburger with fries n a coke. Cost me 17.00 without the tip. Dont get me wrong it was delish, but i think overpriced. And their cheesecske forget about it. I personally dont think its all that the slice is so small  and too too expensive. You want good cheescake for less than 5.00 a slice and their slices are BIG and delish. Go to the Scotchwood dinner on route 22 in scotch plains. You wont be sorry"
Roxanne S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,2,3.0,6/6/2015,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years now. It's always crowded and the waiting area to get seated is kind of a hot mess, but the servers are generally friendly and capable (I don't ever think I've had an incompetent or rude server here ever) and the food is good (generous portions)."
Alex V.,"Wayne, PA",109,353,54,3.0,6/8/2011,"I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory's all over the place. I have to say that the Hackensack location is definitely one of the most disappointing.  The food here is continually mis-executed. I had the Hibachi steak the other day and my steak was not cooked right and my mashed potatoes were very old. Other meals I've had here in the past were not at the same level as other locations. The service at this location is inconsistent too.  Its not a bad option if you're stuck in the mall, but don't expect it to be as good as other locations."
