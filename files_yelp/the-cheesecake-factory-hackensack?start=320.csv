Stephen Z.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",31,69,1,3.0,2/9/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that is most popular for certain thing they are good at and that is their cheesecake of course. I definitely recommend the Brownies Sundae, but the food is just ok as I have the Glam Burger and I really couldn't taste anything but grease in every bite.. It supposely came with fried Mac and Cheese but i could see it but there was no taste.. I will consider just coming here for dessert rather than the food."
Dee C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",2,17,15,2.0,8/4/2013,SO .... The servers were annoying and truly wanted to be someplace else.  THe food was ok.  But I was more annoyed with the attitude of the servers.  just lazy.
Jackie F.,"Brick, NJ",29,139,,4.0,9/22/2013,"The menu is so big! Sometimes that is a problem when you're hungry because you cannot decide what you want. Some of the things I have enjoyed here are the pretzel encrusted chicken, polenta fries, chicken samosas, and Asian chicken salad (one of my all time favorites). I'm not a fan of cheesecake but their pumpkin cheesecake is amazing!"
Catherine C.,"Hopkinton, MA",4,79,1,2.0,7/14/2011,"To be honest, I'm not really a huge fan of Cheesecake but it's a decent option when at a mall.   The good thing about Cheesecake is their selection is huge.  There's something for everybody.  For apps, we had the nachos and fried artichoke hearts.  The nachos were very good and the artichoke hearts were okay.   For entree, I had the shrimp pasta special.  The portions on this was huge.    But flavor is lacking.   Hubbie got the tacos.  The portions on this was not as good.   One of our friends had the shepherd's pie.  Worst looking shepherd's pie ever.  The meat itself wasn't right.  It looked like salisbury steak.  Then it was covered with a little bit of mashed potatoes.  The potatoes looked hard and not that appetizing.   The service was  good though."
Al S.,"Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ",48,12,4,3.0,3/16/2014,"Food is good, hostesses are rude though and the restaurant is drafty in the winter the temp of the place is not well maintained. Servers are friendly and courteous."
Rosann L.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",82,23,6,5.0,10/3/2013,"Sitting outside on a gorgeous night as the ambulances, police card and fire engines  are screaming by on route 4. The service was attentive, the salad satisfying and the pumpkin cheesecake was orgasmic!  Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Petr P.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,4.0,5/4/2015,"like the food, avoid on Fri, Sat evenings - it's packed. Stuff is friendly and helpful. Food is tasty (whatever i tried), deserts are huge .... Best lemonade (not some chemical watered down drink, rather nice tasting real thing)"
Tessa L.,"Jersey City, NJ",16,93,3,3.0,1/15/2013,"So I went here 3 days ago on a Saturday for my birthday with a party of 5 total. The wait time alone was 75 minutes. We stood in the vestibule all that time. Mind you, im not a fan of chain restaurants, but Ive heard a lot about the CF and decided to give it a whirl for my special occasion. The good: cheesecake in all varieties. I had the tiramisu cheesecake and it was a generous slice of deliciousness! The menu items are reasonably priced between $9-30. The bad (brace yourself): The food! I had the steak Diane & Salmon combo. My steak was overcooked for being medium well. Both meats were bland. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were the only tasty items on my plate. My sister's Bang Bang chicken looked and tasted  like regurgitated indian food. Yuck! The plates are huge, the tables are small. Thats a recipe for an accident. My mom spilled her larger than life glass of coke and it shattered all over the floor. Another  table, 2 booths away also smashed glass like they were at a Greek wedding. The frozen drinks come non-alcoholic yet were tasty. All in all, the food was not worth the time nor money spent. I advise you try the Houston's restaurant 2 doors down."
George S.,"Brooklyn, NY",78,34,1,4.0,1/5/2011,"I took my mom here for dinner last night, since neither of us had been to a CF in years. We used to go to the one in White Flint Mall, in the Washington, DC area. Anyways, some of the tried and true dishes are still on their varied and long menu, including the Tex-Mex Egg Rolls, which were as good as both of us remember. I had a Santa Fe salad, which was as yummy and huge (I only was able to finish half of it) as I remember it being from years past, and my mom had some shrimp pasta dish which I think she enjoyed, since there was none left on her plate. She tried to get me to order a slice of cheesecake so that she could have a ""bite"" but I'm not a cheesecake fan at all, so we just had some coffee. This place is huge, but it still gets busy and while the waitstaff pays attention to detail, they aren't always around. One big advantage is that if this place is too crowded, there are 6 other restaurants in the mall to go choose from."
Annie W.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,73,,4.0,4/12/2015,"Great service and great food.  One of the best restaurants in the area.  I'm not going to apologize for it being a chain.  It's a great chain restaurant.  Favorites are the BBQ chicken salad, Asian chicken salad, herb-encrusted salmon, and the warm whole wheat bread."
Pedro T.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",0,1,,1.0,3/23/2015,"I was last night having dinner with my son. We had chicken somosas, cesar salad and tostada salad. We both are sick vomiting and competing for the restroom all night!!!!!"
Austin Y.,"Manhattan, NY",37,166,83,3.0,9/5/2012,"Cheesecake Factory remains a reliable, if calorie-disastrous, chain. Sweet corn tamale cakes are still delicious, and their pastas and burgers, while always a bit too heavy, are always well done. Everything about this restaurant, from the wait, to the service, to the food - is unbelievably consistent. A well-known surgeon commented that hospitals should run like a Cheesecake Factory does. To have such a wide selection of items that consistently taste good is quite an accomplishment. It's no wonder the wait is always so long."
Ershad Z.,"Little Ferry, NJ",177,84,366,1.0,7/8/2012,"The service is super slow... If you decide to come here and get stressed over the slow service, I'd recommend ordering the Thai Lettuce wrap.."
L N.,"Chester Heights, PA",0,53,13,4.0,9/25/2011,"Good for a chain resturaunt. The wait can get long around peak hours, especially since it's in a mall, but if you can get there early and brave the eardrum assault, it's worth it. There's plenty of good food, the staff is friendly, and it offers an all-around good experience. Oh, and leave room for dessert. It's hard, but it's worth it The menu is massive, if you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. There's room for full-page ads on it. It's a book of food selection, totalling at around 15 pages. My Smokehouse BBQ Burger was above average. Not bad at all, but not absolutely amazing. It was a solid burger, though. The fries came in a little can, which was cute. Another person ordered the pizza, and was left a little disappointed due to its sogginess and the incredibly thin (and soggy) crust. The Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae was heavenly, but I could only finish half of it lest I burst in an explosion of calories and sugar. The other people at my table ordered the Hershey's cheesecake and the Strawberry Shortcake. They enjoyed their desserts as well. Oh, and the parking can get crazy. We had to park a ways away, but again, it's in a mall, so that's forgivable. All in all, would go again, but not after 5; The wait gets crazy past then!"
Danny C.,"Rutherford, NJ",51,126,1,2.0,7/12/2013,Hmm... This menu is far too big. I come here semi-frequently and try something new everytime. I have been here like 20 times and don't have a go to dish yet because nothing is THAT GOOD. I'd pass unless your shopping in the mall.
Chamile U.,"Anchorage, AK",16,47,31,5.0,9/20/2013,I love Cheesecake Factory because there's soo much to choose from and they give you big portions for a good price. I've been here twice and it's been nothing but great customer service and great good. I wish there were more locations so I don't have to drive an hour but it's so worth it.
Damian P.,"Bronx, NY",24,107,82,4.0,11/21/2012,Most of the menu will satisfy your taste buds.  Portions are enough to take home no matter what type of eater you are.  Mixed and specialty drinks are quite tasty too.
Altaïr I.,"Ridgewood, NJ",4,26,10,3.0,11/19/2012,"A little on the pricey side, too long of a wait, but you get what you expect. Good service, nice staff, clean bathrooms and good food."
Jomarys M.,"Bogota, NJ",0,9,,5.0,2/7/2015,"Love it here! I eat here all the time, the food and service is great! The cheesecake is beyond delicious and you can feel safe if you ever want to try something new because everything, literally everything is absolutely delicious! this is a great place to celebrate a nice birthday dinner as well. You can never go wrong with this place"
Wendy P.,"Wanaque, NJ",44,263,1011,5.0,4/27/2011,We love this place and always have a great meal..Drinks are also great. Could be a little cheaper....
