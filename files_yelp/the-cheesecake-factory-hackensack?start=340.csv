Amy K.,"New York, NY",16,175,44,4.0,9/19/2012,"UNbelievable!  I've generally disliked this place every time I've gone, for years, and haven't been there for a couple of years as a consequence.  And then, this evening, my mother-in-law chose it, so my husband & I took her there for dinner.  And amazingly, we had a pretty good meal!  We live in NYC and we're accustomed to very good food, and we never ever go to chain restaurants in the City - but tonight we were very pleasantly surprised. I ordered a small Greek salad and the soft shrimp tacos.  There was more feta on the salad than I'd gotten at a diner for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  And the tacos were surprisingly tasty; a bit of a kick, served with lime wedges and a decent (tho' not fresh) salsa.  The ersatz Mexican rice had peas & corn in it, not great but passable.  Can't complain, for the price($12.95)! My mother-in-law didn't like any of the menu options, so we asked the server if she could have just plain grilled shrimp with some sides.  She was very agreeable, saying that their menu is so vast that they can meet almost any special request.  So Mom received 4 (5?) grilled shrimp, with a large portion of mashed potatoes that she loved, and a good-sized portion of steamed fresh broccoli. My husband enjoyed his grilled fish tacos, served with a side of rice and black beans. Did I mention that each of the tacos had a slice of avocado on it also? Funny, there was an article in The New Yorker a few weeks ago talking about how Cheesecake Factory strives for uniformity and quality while being profitable.  I guess they must be doing something right."
Bella M.,"Edgewater, NJ",26,51,28,3.0,1/9/2011,"Good chain. I like their service. I wish that they'd let you know that the chicken piccata was more of a creamy base, more like a francaise. How can you expect to get a perfect cheesecake when you offer dozens of them? Obviously they're frozen and mass produced.  Damn, get with the program people! Be a little bit more insightful and realize the sub-categories of dining establishments and rate accordingly."
Tai M.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",0,6,,4.0,12/29/2013,"Food is great, portions are big...I love the cheesecake.  There is a couple of things i dont like:  1. Too expensive 2. Very loud"
Anjali G.,"New York, NY",0,15,,1.0,1/3/2015,There are way too many dishes on the menu. We ordered 4 different dishes and nothing was good. I usually avoid going to restaurant that have more than one cuisine on the menu. Pasta was just about ok. But definitely do NOT order any Asian dishes. I'm not going back to any Cheesecake factory restaurant.
Mark C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",266,43,166,4.0,12/10/2012,"One of the only food chains that I have enjoyed for a long time now. They have pretty much anything your stomach wants. The one in Hackensack is almost always packed but if your only a table of two you will be seated quickly. Staff have always been professional and polite. I have enjoyed the Kobe Beef Burgers, tempura fish tacos and the usual advocado eggrolls and sweetend green tea with free refills."
Andrew G.,"Summit, NJ",543,497,315,4.0,11/10/2010,"The biggest worry when going to ANY Cheesecake Factory is the amount of waiting time. I went there with a date last weekend (on a Saturday night) and we only had about a 20 minute wait. Upon getting seated, I was worried we'd be waiting FOREVER for the waiter and food for the dinner. However, everything was the COMPLETE opposite. Even with the place packed with people, the service was prompt and extremely efficient with our orders."
Lina K.,"Edgewater, NJ",400,540,57,4.0,1/25/2008,"I like this Cheesecake Factory in particular as this is the one I go to consistently but have also eaten in Wayne, King of Prussia, Boston and Costa Mesa locations.  I can see how the opinions may vary on ratings as I gave the CF a 4 star review but only after settling into a 'groove'.   I have tried many dishes and consistently love: 1.  Meatloaf - what is it about crunchy french fried onions; this is an exercise in gluttony. 2.  Thai lettuce wraps - the lower cal alternative to a pig out meal but you don't feel like you're eating a salad because of the yummy sauces. 3.  Avocado eggrolls - yes, you can OD on these but I had them a lot before switching out to another appetizer. 4.  The dark bread with the butter - not an entree, I know, but I have gone to CF in anticipation of the bread!  But only the dark bread. 5.  The lunch specials are really good and a great value.  There are smaller portions than dinner but really good pricing on almost anything you'd want including the meatloaf, most pastas, salads and sandwiches. Dishes I really like generally include most of the salad dishes because I was on a 'diet' for a really long time: 1.  Chinese chicken salad  2.  Cobb salad - yes, I know, still fattening but the fiber .... 3.  The combination appetizer plate is great for sharing and trying items that you may not order on your own like the corn cakes (yummy but small) and crab cakes mixed in with the run of the mill buffalo wings, mozzerella sticks. There are definitely one or two dishes that I did not like, including the salad with gouda and pear.  I had this in Wayne and literally asked the waitress where the pear was?  She was pretty snooty and told me that there were (obviously miniscule) pieces of diced dry pear in the salad.  Righhhhhhhht.  If the taste is THAT subtle, why the heck headline it in the description?!?!?!? Generally, all of the cheesecakes are delicious, but the challenge is in finding the room after eating dinner.  The low carb cheesecake is okay but I like stuff on mine and this was a plain version.  Could never get myself to try the fish tacos but I hear that is really good too. I like two of the drinks:  the well mannered dirty martini with extra olives (they're huge and stuffed with bleu cheese) and the candy apple martini (very girly and with red sugar on the rim).  My only issue is that I always get extra olives with the dirty martini and the last time the bartender wanted to CHARGE for them .... WTF?  BTW, I asked about buying a bottle and the waitress told me that the CF workers stuff the olives themselves. The atmosphere is loud and noisy in the bar area but I like the place.  It's the perfect end to a hectic shopping day."
Jocelyn A.,"Wayne, NJ",3,19,1,4.0,3/25/2012,I've been going to the CheeseCake factory for several years but just two nights ago my boyfriend and I decided we'd go for dinner at the Hackensack location. The waiter was extremely accommodating. We weren't sure what to get so he brought out samples of recommendations he had made. We ended up getting the Ahi Tuna and Crispy Honey Asian Chicken along with a bowl of their New England Clam Chowder. Everything was great but I must say what made it really amazing was the great wait staff! Oh and the slice of cheesecake topped it all off.
Heart T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,50,95,5.0,8/4/2012,"Oh.My.God.Where do I even start? This place is just so amazing.Once you walk in it`s like you`re in a giant castle or something because of the decorations.The decorations were beautiful and the place was HUGE! Since this place is known for their delish cheesecakes there are a lot of people who come here everyday so you`re gonna have to wait a while before you are seated down.Also,they serve you bread you can eat while you wait for the food and man are those breads good.There`s one dark bread that tastes just like chocolate and the white bread sort of tastes like lemon-or white bread with a hint of lemon rather.Over all,this place did not disappoint by any means and therefore I think this place deserves five stars (:"
Sue Z.,"New York, NY",180,68,9,4.0,1/3/2010,"One of a few good reasons I now live out in the 'burbs: Nothing beats the cheesecakes here! I have yet tried half of the cheesecakes on their menu but I always look forward to trying a different one each time.  Their food reflects a wide range of cuisines, big portions, decent prices, & we've not had anything bad here yet. The service here can be a bit spotty & the wait during peak hours are notoriously long (at least 15 mins but we've waited over 30 mins sometimes).  Still, I always look toward the end of the meal where I get cheesecake! (Sorry, Junior's, I don't think your's is as good...)"
Magdalena N.,"Passaic, NJ",25,38,3,2.0,9/13/2012,"We stopped at the restaurant on a busy Saturday afternoon. Restaurant was packed. We were seated outside (it was too noisy inside). Our waiter was friendly. There were two menus to look at-the regular one and the light one. I ordered french country salad and crab cakes appetizer plus side of mashed potatoes and my friend ordered tuna appetizer. Waiter suggested another tuna dish and after that another tuna dish with the explanation that my friend's choice was too small. Somehow it turned out into  a longer discussion and my friend ordered original dish anyway.  Salad arrived with a long hair in it. We pulled it out and showed it to the waiter. His reply was that his manager will stop to say ""Hello""... It never happened. My crab cakes were undercooked. Bommer! Mashed potatoes were cold. Another bommer! It took forever to get refill of an iced tea. While waiting to be seated I noticed a lavish display of desserts which had a separate counter. I chose a carrot cake in attempt to soften traumatizing experience of being deprived of attention and not satisfactory meal. Carrot cake was stale. At this point we stopped counting bommers and left."
Cynthia A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",464,718,330,4.0,12/19/2009,"Not the biggest fan of Cheesecake Factory, but this one ain't so bad. I've enjoyed their Sunday brunch specials.  They have delicious french toast. This trip, I noticed they had a brand new page of snacks and small plates, which was just perfect for me.  They offered fire roasted artichokes, sausage and cheese stuffed olives, stuffed dates, and other interesting sounding small plates.   Sure beats the typical sliders, spinach/artichoke dip or any other deep fried fare you'd normally get..  Since I wasn't really hungry, I tried to be somewhat healthy and opted for the fire roasted artichoke w/two dipping sauces - garlic aioli and some spicy vinegarette.  The artichoke was ok.. there wasn't really enough plant meat on it for it to be worth getting.. one thing I learned though you can dip a shoe in garlic aioli and it'll taste delicious. My friend and I shared a caesar salad (good) and the spinach artichoke dip, also good - not very saucy, but tasted fresh and not greasy. The topper was the red velvet cheesecake they offered..  RED VELVET CHEESECAKE it's a cheesecake . w/red velvet cake and frosting..!!!! It tastes as decadent as it sounds =)  Yum bill for small plates and a slice was $30 somehow.. and really good service, our waitress was super nice and attentive"
Peter G.,"Westwood, NJ",5,185,4,3.0,9/9/2014,"The older I get, the less I enjoy Cheesecake Factory. Although they have me hooked on their fluffy cheesecake, I usually take it to go after a visit to the mall. It just seems like the entrees are cliché and not as flavorful as they used to be. Maybe a little salty. And the waits are too much when I have such a large selections of alterior restaurants at the same location. I have been very happy with the service, though."
Yana Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,172,6,3.0,9/26/2010,"I went here recently and even though I have gone to several other in various cities this one was pretty GOOD. The service at the bar (where I sat because it was packed) was impeccable. I absolutely LOVED my bartender! He was so attentive, friendly and helpful.  My only faux-paw with my overall experience is fairly similar at all chain restaurants I go to... over doing portion control! As a patron and bartender I feel bartenders should be able to free pour...  But otherwise a Nice place!"
David R.,"Upper Saddle River, NJ",60,119,2,2.0,2/2/2012,Never understood the hype. The cheesecake isn't even that good not too mention the food itself.
PJ D.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,17,,3.0,11/8/2014,Phenomenaly good chicken madeira.  Mediocre salmon from the SkinnyLicious menu. Way overpriced $11 skinny sangria in a wine glass.
Adam W.,"Edgewater, NJ",43,45,19,3.0,1/26/2011,"Been coming here for quite a few years now, nothing disappointing but nothing that impressive either. Being the Cheesecake factory and all, they do have some damn good desserts and cheesecakes to go. I usually pick some up before meeting up with friends or some sort of gatherings.  Nothing terribly bad about this place, and always has consistent food. They do some things phenomenally well though, like the Avocado spring rolls which I personally rave about.  The menu is ENORMOUS. They have almost every conceivable dish on the menu ranging from various cuisine, some of them pretty good. Burgers from what I remember are pretty good if you order the right one. Salads are great here, some of my favorite including the Asian salad, and the Cobb. Cant say I remember much else about the monster of a menu, though a few things are a bit too salty and just not suited for my taste.  Get the dessert!"
Aimee C.,"West Milford, NJ",18,33,22,5.0,4/16/2007,"This place is always crowded from like 6-9pm. They dont take reservations. The food portions are huge and very yummy! I like the Chicken Pot Stickers, Spinach Dip, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Chicken Madiera and for dessert.............Tiramisu, Strawberry Shortcake, Brownie Sundae..........or you can choose from like 30 different types of Cheesecakes! Service is good. The glasses for the soda are BIG. My favorite alcoholic drink is the Georgia Peach (ice blend, peach and raspberry flavors)"
Marc A.,"Edgewater, NJ",63,30,,3.0,9/21/2014,I went for a drink at the bar prior to dinner at another place.  I thought the long island ice tea I got was overpriced and didn't have the alcoholic punch I was looking for.
Mafood H.,"New York, NY",21,28,8,5.0,1/2/2013,"I honestly loveee Cheesecake Factory.  I don't think I've ever tried a meal that I did not like.  My friends and I always order the Luau Chicken salad, lemon herb roasted chicken, tomato-basil pasta and most importantly tuxedo cheesecake to top everything off almost everytime.  Yes, they're to die for.  I've also tried their other pastas and they were pretty good as well.  Their service is usually pretty decent too."
