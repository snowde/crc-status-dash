Jadean F.,"Burbank, CA",0,21,,1.0,11/14/2009,"I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factories over the years, so I'm pretty familiar with their menu, layout, and service. I thought it was pretty standard. However, my recent trip made me belive that service, food quality isn't standard even at fairly large chains. First of all, our waitress was horrible. She was one of those chatty people who end up going on a tangent and forgetting everything you asked for before she started talking, venting, and shooting the breeze.  For example: I asked for the ""brown bread."" She went on for eight minutes about all the names she's heard the bread called. Toward the end of her rant, I repeated that we only wanted the honey wheat bread. I didn't want to waste food. Fifteen minutes later she comes back with one slither of honey wheat and two sourdough rolls. Of course we didn't eat them. We asked for the honey wheat again. Then we asked for it three more times before she ever brought it out. When we finally got the bread, she brought out five pieces right before our meal...this was pointless. We no longer wanted the bread. Now we wanted lemon for our water. We had asked for that in the beginning as well.  Clearly, this was starting to feel like work... We sat in the back of the restaurant where it was supposed to be quieter. Until little Mr. Terror sat down with his mom and grandmother. This child was unruly and promptly began throwing objects i.e. a cell phone toward our table. Our waitress decided to go into babysitting mode and began mimicking the child's annoying squeal every single time she passed his table (which unfortunately happened to be across from ours). I ordered fish tacos with black beans, yellow rice, and guacamole. My mother order the chicken and biscuits. I usually order the shrimp club sandwich.  When my fish tacos arrived, I could tell the plate had been through hell. The rice was clearly overcooked. The black beans were overcooked. But worst of all, when I went to put my fork into the black beans, I saw the half of a french fry. It made me sick. It really made me wonder what was really going on in that kitchen. These are not the thoughts you want to have while dining out. You could tell that the ""chefs"" back there could careless. I immediately called my waitress over. In her typical unprofessional fashion, she began to try to explain why my plate looked like a Bottom Chef disaster. ""Your rice was probably overcooked because they didn't bring it out right away. It usually sits under the lights. Yeah that is a french fry. It probably dropped over from another plate. Your tacos seem ok. Want me to love those on the plate?""  Um, no.  At that point my mind started to imagine all kinds of things. I really didn't want to order anything else . I wanted to get out of there. However, I didn't want to make my mother feel bad while she was attempting to eat. So I went back to my trusty shrimp sandwich. To her credit, she did tell the manager. He came over with an apology. He validated my complaints and said that this was unacceptable. He told me he would watch my sandwich. This made me really uncomfortable about that kitchen once again. The sandwich came out fifteen minutes later. It was cooked to perfection. However, the belligerent toddler was back to throwing items. All I really wanted to do was leave and forget I ever showed up here. The manager should have comped us for at least a dessert for the inconvenience. The waitress should have been more professional and focused. The parents of Mr. Terror should go home and pray for mercy. They really shouldn't take him out in public until his behavior is under control. For all these reasons and more, we won't be back to this location."
Justin M.,"Hackensack, NJ",58,150,,3.0,12/30/2012,Pretty good food. The menu is a bit overwhelming. A few too many choices. Ok decor and ambiance. Service is up to chain restaurant corporate standards.
Elizabeth B.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,3,,3.0,10/14/2014,"I absolutely love happy hour at The Cheesecake Factory. The $5 price is a real deal for the appetizers. They serve a large amount of food. Also, the Long Island ice tea is flavorful. I would definitely rate them higher, however, the bathroom is always gross. Also, it is hit or miss with the managerial staff. Depending on the day, you will have an amazing, helpful and professional manager."
Joe P.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,2.0,12/11/2013,"Hit or miss. I've had good experiences at the bar. Tonight, however, I chose to be seated. It took 15 minutes to receive water. My caesar salad consisted of iceberg lettuce (a la Wendy's), 4 small, cold pieces of chicken, and thinly grated Parmesan, which tasted like it was grated off of my grandpa's crusty feet. The bread was good, until a fruit fly large enough to terrorize Tokyo landed on it. Server was nice, but definitely had too much on his plate (as did I, when I left)."
Stewart C.,"New York, NY",39,85,29,3.0,10/13/2010,Another dreaded chain restaurant.... the food here isn't bad but it isn't great. It seems that they load all their entrees with butter which makes most of their dishes very heavy.  I don't go there often but once in a blue moon i will and i usually order the pasta de vinci or the bang bang chicken and shrimp :P one of the few times you will catch me ordering something kind of asian at an american restaurant :P
Tonya C.,"New York, NY",0,129,18,4.0,6/29/2012,"Came here for an anniversary and break from a low carb diet (which ruined it indefinitely).. I always love the food here! Had some small plates with my bf.. Hummus was amazing and so were the corn fritters....they were all really good (although we could only eat a few bites from each). Finished the meal with some champagne and cookie dough cheesecake (Yummm).. Fruity drinks during the meal were delicious as well! (peach belini was great) Waiter was alright, didn't have much of a personality. The wait was around an hour, but we came around 8 pm on a Friday night."
Robert B.,"Paramus, NJ",2,27,2,5.0,2/26/2013,Food was fabulous. Timing was great. Appetizers were a great start to the meal. Main meal tasted great. Are waiter was very nice and filled up drinks every time we needed one.
Wendy T.,"New York, NY",5,23,5,5.0,1/13/2013,Everytime I visit this place it never fails me...from customer service to its food..I don't ever visit any other location...and its never crowded on Friday evenings around 6pm
James P.,"New York, NY",1,41,,2.0,1/2/2014,"Food was good but not great and the portion was small. Customer service was poor, waiter lost my credit card and wasn't very helpful. Neither the manager/supervisor apologized -- or offered any help or compensation."
Greg B.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",30,452,4,2.0,3/15/2012,"I am not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory but they should be commended for recently adding  a low calorie menu.  The grilled chicken, ordered with sauce on the side, was very good and was not greasy at all.  The menu does not mention fat or sugar calories, so beware of overly sweet sauces."
Grace R.,"Dayton, NJ",18,29,,3.0,9/15/2010,"On par with all the other Cheesecake Factory's I've been to.  The pizzette were relatively new, and we ordered couple.  They were great tasting AND very well priced!  I ordered a peach smoothie, and found that it tastes almost exactly like their Georgia Peach, sans alcohol.  My friends ordered a glass of sangria each, 1 white and 1 red.  The taste was great, but it was a bit steep at almost $10 a glass!  For my meal, I ordered the lemon-herb chicken.  The meat was a little dry, but the skin was crisp and well seasoned.  The mashed potatoes and vegetables were fresh and very flavorful. Generally a run-of-the-mill Cheesecake Factory... no real surprises here. Try the pizzettes!"
Phil M.,"Paramus, NJ",0,7,,5.0,1/29/2013,"I've been going to this place since 2006. Their crab cakes are amazing (better than any crab cakes that I've tried in the Maryland/DC area), their cheeseburgers are incredible, and so is the cheesecake of course. The food isn't exactly cheap, but it's well worth it. Service is typically pretty good, too.  Easily my favorite restaurant."
Soy L.,"Putnam County, NY",4,553,52,4.0,8/1/2012,"The food is quite tasty here and the prices are reasonable.  There are negatives- -impossible to find parking at night; -the restaurant is warm.  The air conditioning is barely on, presumably to save $; -the waitress could not remember who ordered which entree, which is bad form. Recommended dish - Chicken Romano Recommended dessert - carrot cake"
Kathy L.,"New York, NY",37,116,6,3.0,3/20/2009,"Every once in a while, I like to indulge in a day of suburbia and drive across the GWB to Route 4, which is the highway of supermalls and big box stores.  I love their huge salads. BBQ chicken and Luau are especially good. Their burgers are great too if you want to eat yourself silly. You could easily put together a 2000 calorie meal with an entree and a dessert.  It's also fun to see the ridiculous amounts of food that people get... and gawk at their huge plates of pasta and chicken.  This CF is in a huge mall with high end stores like Ferragamo, Louis Vuitton, Cartier... Kind of funny that the people who shop at these stores eat at Cheesecake Factory and McCormicks and Scmicks... but I guess that's life outside NY. To further extend a day of suburbia, you can drive down to the Bergen Commons mall a mile or so west on Route 4 and shop at the new Target, Whole Foods, and Nordstrom Rack."
Mars X.,"Oradell, NJ",2,39,,3.0,4/8/2012,For a chain restaurant it's good! Lunch size portions are just right. Dinner size portions are large enough for left overs. Dessert... Well they don't call it the cheesecake factory for nothing & you can't leave without trying it!
Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,4.0,6/5/2009,"I'm definitely a fan of the cheesecake factory. The appetizers and entrees are definitely very yummy, and if I gain a few pounds from the huge portions... well it's worth it! Appetizers: I like the Ahi Tuna and the pot stickers. Since the entrees are so large, I generally do not get an appetizer. Entrees: I generally get the beef ribs. The ribs are huge (they are beef, after all) and the meat is so tender that it falls right off the bone. The BBQ flavor tastes like it's been slowly cooked in, and I only wish I had enough room left over for the sides that come w/ the dish. The burger is also a must try. They put hand battered onion rings into the burger so you get a bit of a crunchy texture as you bite in. The burger is also quite large such that it is usually pretty difficult to finish everything.  The hibachi steak is usually very tender with a light sauce. Not my favorite, but still very enjoyable.  Desserts: I ALWAYS get the chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake is fantastic, very moist with 4 or 5 layers of very rich chocolate icing. You get this HUGE slice, and with the ice cream and whipped cream, it is decadent. That being said, I've tried their cheesecake and was not very impressed. The price is quite reasonable given the large portions and the tasty food. Also, as an ""up scale restaurant"" an entree that runs you $15 to $30 is really not that bad. My only issue is that they do not take reservations, which means that you will be waiting at least an hour (if not longer) to be seated on a Friday or Saturday night. At least it's located as part of the riverside mall so you do have the option of browsing the surrounding shops (not that many) while waiting."
Carlos C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,557,36,3.0,1/2/2011,"This is the first time that I dine in this place, I usually come here to buy cheesecakes, can you say Godiva chocolate cheesecake. OK about the dining experience, I was here with the fam having Sunday brunch, I ordered the French Toast Napoleon. It was real good, I love the pecans and the strawberries and the Chantilly sauce,with eggs were ok and bacon needed to be more crispy. The waiter was real friendly and attentive. I must say that the food isn't all of that, but its edible. Their cheesecakes are real sweet and hey who don't like a Godiva chocolate cheesecake? Some of the other reviews are just hating. This place is chill."
Oliver K.,"Oradell, NJ",25,47,2,4.0,4/24/2012,"They have pretty decent food here considering the menu is ridiculously large!  They almost make a diner appear to have no options.  I, by no means have tried everything on the menu, but what I have tried has been tasty.  It is a chain, indeed, but they pride themselves on good service and consistent quality.  Without needing to be said, but I will say it anyways, the cheesecake factory has excellent desserts and they pride themselves on their vast number of different types of cheesecakes which are top notch.  I'll go here sometimes just to take out a piece of their cheesecake to eat later on, yea, it's like that!"
Maria H.,"Hackensack, NJ",129,149,73,3.0,11/13/2011,"What I like most abt Cheesecake Factory is it's consistent. The bread is fresh out the oven, the small bite appetizers are tasty and quite the variety.. and despite having such a large menu, I haven't been disappointed.   Although I'm loyal to the Bow tie pasta w/ sun dried tmto n mushrooms, red peppers & chicken in cream sauce... heavenly!!"
lisa m.,"TWP WASHINGTN, NJ",81,36,3,4.0,10/31/2011,"It's the cheesecake factory, need I say more? The cons are always the long waiting period but I guess that is due to the fact is is part of a high-end shopping mall. Our waiter was very polite and extremely helping in choosing food from the insanely large menu. I love their new lower calorie menu. The Skinny Sangria was amazing!"
