Lexy M.,"New York, NY",1103,197,50,4.0,9/19/2008,"I can't believe I'm actually writing a review on a popular chain mall destination restaurant but... I can't help myself damnit! This place is Awesome!  Rarely do I (Miss NY City Girl) get the treat of eating at ""The Cheesecake Factory"" being that there are none in the city of New York and to visit one you must have car which I don't have. Or you have to drive, and I don't know how to that yet either (yes, i'm 25 and can't drive). So when I do have the pleasure of being in a car and i'm in the New Jersey or Long Island area or shopping at the MALL...it's CHEESECAKE FACTORY TIME BABY! ;o)  I am a super pig when it comes to their fresh free bread baskets. The bread is really good! Almost all their dishes are my favorite, I honestly can't pick one out that I like better than the other. The dishes are HUGE, I always have enough to take home with me and eat for dinner almost the next two days after. The drink selection here is surprisingly good also. Really good mixed drinks and of course you can't leave with sharing or taking home a piece of cheesecake. That is after  you take 3 hours to decide after looking through their 500 diff types of cheesecakes lol.  My advice.... go for the Adams Cheesecake. It's a done deal! ;o)"
Natasha K.,"Fairview, NJ",11,14,,4.0,6/25/2011,"I love this place and never get sick of going there, even though I always order the same things!  The Grilled Portobello on a Bun is awesome, though a bit messy to eat.  All of the desserts I've had were delicious and pretty darn big (as are the food portions in general here).  I was disappointed with the fish and chips when I had them and will stick to my mushroom sandwich though!  Also, it gets really crowded and if you're there on a weekend, you will be waiting for an insane amount of time.  Otherwise, it's great!"
Anny P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,2,,1.0,3/31/2013,"PARENTS STAY AWAY!!  I give these guys one star because I have no choice. Rude staff, lack of proper management and nonexistent customer service. After waiting an hour for a table, which is common here, we waited an additional twenty minutes after our buzzer went off. Typically if the place is packed this is understandable, but when they start sitting groups (of the same number of people) that came in after us there is a problem. Our extra wait was due to having small children with us. In my opinion this is unacceptable. My children are very well behaved, even with a hour and a half of wait. But the staff there simply continued to sit others. When we approached the hostess, she was very dismissive and extremely rude. They just don't really care!! I recommend you take your business and your money somewhere else , we definitely did!!"
Chelsey R.,"Oradell, NJ",118,3,,2.0,1/16/2015,"10 seconds ago this was my favorite restaurant... not anymore. The food and service is always remarkable and I've come here numerous times. Today, I decided to come here with a couple of friends of mine. Usually, were used to crappy service.. sadly most restaurants will treat us like crap due to our age because they'll assume that we'll give them a horrible tip due to being teenagers. This service was beyond horrible. We started out our stay with a waiter who told us that she'd be starting us out but they were under shift changes so our new waiter would be taking our order afterwards. After thirty or so minutes we finally got fed up and had to ask someone to bring us a waiter. She brought us our food but didn't come back until another thirty or so minutes to check on us and at that point we hadn't even ordered our dinner yet. We were fed up and eventually got to order our food and eat.   Once we were done we paid for our check and waited to get my friend's card back, but we never did. We had to speak to the manager to actually get anything done. Afterwards our previous waiter gave us attitude and a dirty look on our way out."
Kate C.,"New York, NY",14,160,6,2.0,10/5/2008,"I'm convinced this must be Bergen County late teens/early 20s mecca. Have passed by considering stopping there to eat, only to be shocked by the massive line and giant crowd, vibrating buzzers clutched firmly in hand, outside. I did eat here for lunch awhile back, and was pleasantly surprised by the price/portions of the salads ratio. The taste was fine. As for the cheesecake, I had a bite. It's okay. I'm spoiled by New York and real bakeries. I guess that about sums it up really. Why stand in line for Cheesecake Factory when a 20 minute drive could put you at a great New York restaurant with no wait? Hm."
DJ S.,"New York, NY",75,25,,5.0,5/24/2011,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! you can never go wrong here when it comes to food. Great portions, great prices, and it's SO F'N YUMMY!!!.. any chance i get, I'd go to this place whether it's on a date, birthday, etc. I especially love the cheesecake.. anything you pick, you'd love.. and did i mention the drinks?! they are well mixed and fantastic!!"
Brian V.,"Bergenfield, NJ",3,24,,4.0,1/22/2012,"My rule of thumb applies specifically to this place. Rule of thumb states that if a place is packed at lunch or diner than they are doing something right. If you don't want to wait and hour to sit down and eat than quit squawking and go somewhere else, i mean really its that simple.  .          My favorites are the kobe burger the navajo sandwich and just about any salad on the menu they are large very large. Stay away from there steaks they are a bit pricey and a little small for the coin your shelling out for them not to mention they just aren't that good. The selection of cheesecakes to choose from is quite nice and the portion is quite nice also. If your a fan of carrot cake or strawberry shortcake i would recommend them also the the slices are huge.     I have never had a problem with the service here it has always been excellent the place gets really really busy so if your waiter isn't back in 2 shakes of a lambs tail with drink refills or something extra take it easy and enjoy the scenery.Come to this place early for lunch on the weekend 11:30 to 1 if you dont want to wait to long.If your gonna get your panties in an uproar b/c you don't get seated right of way at 6:00 pm on a fri sat sun than do yourself a favor and go someplace else. It cracks me up how people call this a chain restaurant your not gonna get food like this at tgi fridays or applebees so its really not fair to compare them to those types of low standard eateries. I come to this cheesecake factory since it has opened and highly recommend it, always consistent."
workingstiff x.,"Bradfordsville, KY",0,14,,1.0,7/1/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory, Inc., has a fabulous menu and I enjoy their selection. Tho it could be healthier, they even have brown rice now. And by all means, eat there, but know how they conduct business. A friend who works there informs me that longterm staff with health insurance and higher hourly wages at her location are being frozen out with reduced hours, or baited so they'll quit or get themselves fired. She says the general manager has frequently talked openly about the fact that he will not keep people on staff who make a higher wage, and people who work at other locations say the same thing goes on there. By the way, at this location, hosts and cooks receive a regular hourly wage, but servers, bussers, and bartenders basically work for tips, because by law the Cheesecake Factory only has to pay them $2.15 an hour as long as that plus their tips adds up to $7.95, or minimum wage...but if their tips don't make minimum wage (if for example they work slow shifts and don't get seated) the Cheesecake Factory forces them to declare, and therefore pay taxes on, more tips than they made.  Just an FYI."
Mark N.,"Point Pleasant Beach, NJ",46,196,177,4.0,5/7/2009,"If you're looking for great food, you have to check this place out at least once. Situated in the Riverside Square Mall, this restaurant has great food with huge portions (not for the faint of heart). My personal favorite is the Steak Diane - great mashed potatoes. They have a nice beer menu, one of the few restaurants I know of that serves Sierra Nevada. If you're a health nut or on weight watchers, you probably will want to steer clear of this place - it's not exactly the healthiest. For the few of us with great metabolisms, you'll leave VERY full. This is not a place for those with tight budgets - I've easily spent over $100 for two, many times (not that there's anything wrong with that, but it will hurt if you're college age). As the name suggests, this place is famous for serving two menu pages worth of cheesecake slices; it would be sacrilege not to order something from it before you leave.  As for the negative: parking for Cheesecake Factory in Riverside Square sucks, for lack of a better term. Don't even think of getting a spot outside of the restaurant (unless you want to battle maniacs who are willing to sit around for 30 minutes and wait for spots to free up), but look toward the parking lot around the corner. For some reason, there is a never ending amount of people coming to Riverside Square for reasons I can't explain. You'll probably want to order some kind of appetizer right off the bat, since the food can take awhile to be prepared - I don't blame the cooks, it's mostly because this place is swamped with customers on a regular basis. There's also a full bar near the entrance. The wait time at Cheesecake Factory is usually long. Expect a good half hour or more on average, far more than that on a Saturday night - or simply don't bother on a Saturday night. In short - great but pricey food, bad parking, long wait time. I weigh my ratings on the food above all else, but keep it all in mind!"
Derick R.,"Millville, NJ",37,113,335,3.0,4/9/2011,"Went here for a early dinner today. On a sat night around 5 pm a 25 minute is wait is not bad at all. However the parking is just ridiculous due to the mall and like 6 other restaurants. There's only 6 parking spots! (exaggerating) but I did have to park pretty far. So we were seated and greeted. The waitress was very pleasant and attentive, no problems with her or any staff at all. Ordered the calamari app and it was great, lightly fried to perfection although to me it seemed like the portion had gotten smaller since I was there last. I had the Steak Diane and the ever so popular Chicken Madeira combination. To be honest I didn't like either all that much, the steak was definitely not seasoned, it was obvious they just cooked it and poured the sauce over top. Ive had this steak here before and it wasn't nearly as bad. Now the chicken I didn't like all that much either but I think that was due to preference bc the gf loved it. It was just to sweet for me. She had the Chicken Castelleta and that was better than both my chicken and steak. It was lightly breaded and cooked well. Actually despite the taste (of my dish) everything was cooked perfectly. The strawberry lemonade is goooood too. And finally, you need the Red Velvet Cheesecake in your life... WoW, I don't even know anyone else who even makes this, but they DO, and they do very well. Get it to go like I did and enjoy it at 1am."
Hulu Y.,"Little Ferry, NJ",0,12,,3.0,10/31/2008,"Last year, I reedemed my rewards from AMEX with a bunch of Cheesecake factory giftcards and since then we have been frequenting this place.  I like Cheesecake factory in general. One thing that I don't like about Cheesecake factory is that I feel like there is too much pressure in terms of turning the tables. Almost every single time we went there, we are in-and-out in one hour and first half hour is spent in the waiting area. So the average dining duration is only half an hour and I hate that. It truly is a factory that takes you in and fixes your stomach and kicks you out. When I go out, I would like to enjoy the ambiance and the company of my friends. It is not just merely about the taste of the food. If it was only the taste and quality of the food, I would rather stay at home, since both me and my husband can cook spectacular dishes."
Bryan V.,"Savannah, GA",6,31,,3.0,6/16/2009,"Eat in: Noisy, long wait times, hideous decor, and service that is only so-so. Take out: Reasonable wait for most orders, and they do curbside delivery which is a bit awkward given the layout of the parking lot. It's better to just run in and grab it yourself. The food: I love their turkey club sandwich. It's gigantic and tasty. The fries are better than most, but not as good as some. All of the cheesecakes I've tried were spot on. Their stone ground whole wheat bread is amazing and I wish I could buy a hundred loaves of it. I give them three stars because of the less than pleasant in-house dining experience, and the quality/cost ratio makes this an occasional dinner option rather than the goto spot."
Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",48,51,518,3.0,8/6/2010,"Beautifully decorated and lively environment, although the staff could use a jolt of life! I had the grilled portabella burger (that's how they spelled it on the menu) and a side salad which was very tasty and extremely filling!! I didn't finish either but would come gain just because it's such a cute and spacious place. Service ok and the bathrooms are super clean."
Jessica F.,"New York, NY",87,252,49,3.0,8/1/2007,"Oh my god, spare me the snotty elitist attitude about popular chain restaurants.  I love it when people have to hate the big guy when all he is is big.  I will grant you, Cheesecake Factory isn't a fine dining restaurant, but there is nothing wrong with it--it is a lot of fun, the food is decent, and you wind up with leftovers.  And excuse me--you think you can get a better meal at Houston's than you can at Cheesecake Factory?  Please.  It's practically the same menu--steaks, salads, cheesy goopy appetizers.   I keep saying this--it's all about managing expectations.  It isn't McCormick and Schmick.  It's a loud, fun, busy, tasty place.  That's it.  If you don't want to wait, there are a number of other restaurants now at the Shops at Riverside, a new addition to the mall with Maggiano's Little Italy, PF Chang's Bistro, Rosa Mexicano and other similar high-quality chains.  If you do want to wait--and you will--they hand out beepers, so you can head into the Barnes and Noble next door, or head into Bloomingdales, also next door.   I have come to this location of CF at least ten times since it opened about ten years ago, with crowds, with family, and alone, and it never fails to satisfy.  If you like bargains, this is the place for you.  If you like abundance, this is the place for you.  If you like variety, this is the place for you.  I didn't realize that tourists patronized Riverside Square Mall, but I guess if you live in Nyack, you could be considered a tourist, if you come to avoid sales tax on clothes and stop off for a salad before heading back to the Palisades Parkway. I will say the cocktails are pretty bad.  As did other Yelpers, I also ordered a strawberry martini.  It's vile.  Don't do it.   The latest thing they offer is small plates of some of their most popular dishes at the bar from 4-6 PM at reduced prices.  Caesar salad was substantial, garlicky and $2.95.  Three sizeable balls of fried mac and cheese on a bed of pink sauce was $3.95.  Ahi tuna tempura roll was tasty, light and yet filling, and was $4.95.  A reasonable way to try a number of dishes and not get enormously stuffed.  Also, no leftovers.   Personally, I think while $6.50 for the 6-carb cheesecake is a little steep, when you throw in a slice of carrot cake so big and dense and intimidating you need to invite people to eat it with you for $6.50, it all evens out. Yes, it's a chain.  So is everything else these days.  The thing about Cheesecake Factory is that the food tastes like it has a point of view.  I don't feel like I am going to hell for eating there.   Everything doesn't have to be a new culinary adventure and a flirtation with a violent bout of food poisoning to keep me feeling vibrant and alive."
Carla L.,"New York, NY",120,240,22,4.0,4/25/2008,"It's a Cheesecake Factory.  Obviously one location of a large restaurant chain.  If you've been to one, you've been to them all.  However, this is one of the smaller restaurants.  It's standard middle of the road restaurant fare.  What's nice is the incredibly huge menu selection - definitely something that everyone would like here.  I would recommend the very spicy Jamaican shrimp which is served with rice and beans and a mango salsa, or the tuna tataki salad which is light yet filling.  Those are my two favorites.   The portions are obscenely huge.  Always bring enough home for another meal or two.  The atmosphere is nice - casual, relaxed, fun.  It's great to go with a group of friends.   I've eaten at this one several times.  On two separate occasions, they have screwed up my order.  Once was a problem with strange ingredients in my Caesar salad, and the other time was a similar problem with a pasta dish.  Perhaps the kitchen is so busy that they get sloppy.  Both times my meal was comped.   Of course, the cheesecake is the real star of the show.  Go in November or December and order the pumpkin cheesecake - it is their absolute best!"
Janelle M.,"Princeton, NJ",54,456,105,3.0,3/8/2008,"I'm not into chain restaurants, but the Cheescake Factory is pretty damn good.  This is the only location I've tried, and everything went pretty well the few times I've visited. Clean, bright, and inviting atmosphere.  Extremely lengthy and varied menu with quite a few vegetarian options.  This is always very nice.  So, yeah, the food is pretty decent; however, I'm not a huge fan of the cheesecake.  It's ok, but I've certainly had better. I imagine all of their locations are busy, but each time I've been to this Hackensack location at Riverside Square*, I've had to wait an hour plus for a seat. *check out the Shops at Riverside or Riverside Sq Mall (whatever you wanna call it) (see review)"
Su R.,"Westwood, NJ",214,401,3,4.0,1/2/2011,"My friend and i went here New years Eve and had a great time. The wait was 40 mins which wasn't bad for nye. they give you one of those vibrator things to hold onto so u dont have to worry about hearing ur name shouted out. we pushed through the crowd and found our way to the very clean restroom and then the bar, which had a corner seat open. so we were comfy for the wait. the waiter was very nice and attentive. huge menu with something for everyone. i had the steak diane which was perfectly cooked and then decided on the tiramisu cheesecake, which was DIVINE. There are so many cheesecake options it is nearly impossibble to make a decision so you might just want to close your eyes and point. One missing star is only because it is a long wait, and crowded and a bit pricey."
Jee K.,"New Milford, NJ",0,2,,1.0,9/12/2013,"I've been here several times, the food is good. But the service is terrible. I think this particular branch has the worst service of all, nothing is done efficiently. They take forever to bring you even your drinks and bread. Waited twenty minutes for a cup of tea and left because I did not want to wait any longer. Not worth the wait at all."
G M.,"New York, NY",24,149,2,2.0,1/7/2009,"I have to admit - I ""use"" to come to CF a lot (keyword: USE to)...Chicago, Balitmore and now Hackensack.  CF seems to be my last resort on dining only because it's located next to my town and there's not a lot of good places to eat in Bergen County - why??!!! I have stopped coming here - just thinking about the huge portions makes me want to gag. No wonder America is so fat. The oily pasta makes me want to go on a diet and the entree's started to have a similar taste?!  I have tried the meatloaf, sheperd's pie, steak diane, roasted chicken, chicken marsala, chicken picatta, louisiana pasta, chicken romano, nachos, taquitos, salads, sandwiches, cheesecake, etc.!!! God, thinking about it makes me wanna puke!!! The dessert counter in front of the restaurant is evil.  You pack on 10lbs just starting into the hypnotizing glass of cheesecakes.  I don't care for them, actually.  They are too sweet and the only one I usually order is the Keylime or regular cheesecake with strawberries. The restaurant is so dark it makes me wonder what it would look like with the lights on?!  Probably sticky tables and floors *quivers* This place is packed on the weekends so if you have at least and hour to kill - by all means, wait otherwise I don't know what else to tell ya!"
F B.,"San Francisco, CA",41,81,,2.0,12/30/2006,"So-so food, crappy music and  watery mixed drinks. This place is a haven for tourists from bum-fuck nowhere, bearded men in their 40's who are on vacation with their wives with their badly sun bleached super frizzy hair.  ""Honey I got the tickets to San Francisco, city of love! "" *Shaking tickets to his wife in her herb garden. ""Oh Lester.."" *putting spade up to shield the sun from her eyes. ""I love you so much, it's like a second honey-moon. Remember the 60's?"" *Lester peers into the mountains from his porch, hearing gunfire in his head and the sound of people screaming............... Omg, I blacked out. What was I writing. Whatever, I've never gotten the Cheesecake. Even if it was made of gold and diamonds and cocane it would only bump this joint up to 3 stars."
