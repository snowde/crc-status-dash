Esmeralda C.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",108,287,2613,4.0,6/17/2016,"This is my second time going into a cheesecake factory and due to the time, it was extremely busy but my party of four didn't have to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated which was my cut-off time.  Anything above that is not worth the wait when you can be seated quicker in another neighboring establishment.   As we walked to be seated we all realized the floor was slippery so once our waiter arrived we informed him of our concern.  He informed us that he would let management know of the slippery floor to ensure the safety of their patrons. We all quickly scanned the huge menu and decided on our drinks and meals.  My drink of choice was a mojito which was very good. I took a chance trying a pasta dish with vegetables, and was pleasantly surprised to find it was cooked to perfection with an abundant of flavor.   Overall our experience was good and the waiter was very accommodating to some of my fellow diners needs. :)"
Jemell A.,"Middletown, NY",121,72,245,5.0,7/25/2017,This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory close to New York City. I always find a reason to go to this restaurant. I haven't had a bad meal or service since I've been going to this location.
Alyssa D.,"New Milford, NJ",144,122,374,3.0,11/17/2016,Service was excellent our server's name was Carlos and he was extremely attentive. He came by every 15-20 mins to ask if we needed anything. It's really great when you don't have to wonder where the hell your server went !! Food is average- good . It tastes how you'd expect a chain restaurant to taste. Nothing really stood out in a sense of great or terrible.  The drinks are great though. Very fruity and beautifully presented! Great flavor! :) Cute spot for a date ! Quality vs quantity($) ratio is Not that even though
Nicole R.,"North Bergen, NJ",48,5,6,5.0,10/24/2017,This is literally where I always go on my time off. I love their pasta and cocktails. Greats service long wait at the door.
The Critical J.,"Cresskill, NJ",64,94,,4.0,7/25/2017,"PROS: As with any cheesecake factory, the food is great and there's a lot to choose from. The prices are just right and they offer you big helpings of whatever you ordered. The wait staff is very nice and knowledgable about the menu. Parking isn't an issue since it's in a mall and the bathroom are very clean. CONS: Theres always a long wait, not just because it's popular, but because the bus boys are slow at turning over tables. When it's not busy the restaurant will stick you in the corner by the window looking into the mall rather than in the center of the room. The plastic menus are always sticky and the food takes a long time to come out. OVERALL: This is a typical cheesecake factory. It has a few problems like cleanliness and time management, but the quality of the food is good and the wait staff is always cheerful and ready to serve you."
Denée O.,"Secaucus, NJ",38,1,1,1.0,1/3/2017,"When me and my family got here, the place was packed. It was about 5:30 p.m. on a Monday. We had to wait an hour which is fair because it was 7 of us. But after getting called up, the hostesses told us to move to the left. It looked like other people were waiting to get seated too. Why call us up if we're gonna have to wait 5 extra minutes for a table to clear up? My aunt and grandma can't stand up for long as they have knee issues so they were definitely feeling annoyed. But whatever. When we sat down, it took a good 10-15 mins for a server to come and ask us for our drinks. Like I know the place is packed but still. We were also missing one small plate and we had to ask two different servers to get one.   My family and I shared buffalo wings, calamari, crab cakes and the egg roll sampler. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it was very dry so I asked for more sauce. It tasted alright but the chicken tasted like it had too much olive oil. I think they refried it. I wanted to try some cheesecake because they're famous for the cheesecake so why the hell not? So I got the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake. That was the only good thing apart from the brown bread. After we finished paying, I got really nauseous and it wasn't until the next morning that woke up in a cold sweat and threw up. It was the god damn pasta. Never again am I eating the food here."
Emma M.,"Manhattan, NY",93,24,22,5.0,6/12/2017,"The place well.... it's amazing! The Wait line was a pain but worth it. I ordered salmon with veggies (good, a bit dry but it was still pretty good), flat bread with pear and blue cheese (holy crap. I love this combination will definitely order this again!) and of course the cheesecake, what can I say, that's is what they're known for and they did not disappoint! The cheesecake fixed everything!!!!"
Paula C.,"Morristown, NJ",274,167,374,4.0,9/8/2016,"I have been to a few Cheesecake Factories at this point in my life and I am always impressed with the size of the menu, the variety of plates they have to offer and that every single thing on the menu is actually good!  They must have an enormous orchestra of chefs in the kitchen working to prep and cook such a wide variety of menu items for such a large restaurant.   The portions are reliably large so I always leave with leftovers for later or tomorrow's lunch.  I especially appreciate the big water glasses so that I am never empty.  This Cheesecake Factory in particular has very friendly and quick service, we never have to second guess this place when it's suggested for our lunch stop."
adam v.,"Manhattan, NY",13,128,,2.0,3/13/2017,"I'm not a big fan of places that let you wait 40 min when the whole place is empty, just to create a line . Food is ok , you gotta wait for like another 30 min after you wait in line , at this point you are so hungry you will eat a horse . Last think is not cheep at all , $100 for two salads and pasta ."
Tony R.,"Teaneck, NJ",14,2,,5.0,9/28/2017,As large as the menu is. It's  incredible that every item on the menu is delicious. Looooooove Cheese Cake Factory
Tonya J.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",69,338,4501,5.0,12/15/2015,"Years of Cheesecake Factory Satisfaction keeps me coming back no matter the location, the food is always outstanding, drinks top notch and dessert exceptional. That's my opinion and has always been my experience, solid service, food and drinks.  This location I've been to several times with both family and friends and we always leave here satisfied with the service, quality of the food and the cocktails (I love my booze friends) and Cheesecake factory even got the drinks on lock down. I just want to note that for a franchise chain that Cheesecake Factory has the food service industry on lock down with the quality of food, portion sizes to prices, quality of servers (they seem always aimed to please and well versed on the palate  & plate offerings to me and my company) and let us not forget the outstanding selection of cheesecakes that you just can't go wrong with no matter what you choose! Cheesecake Factory is always a top choice when out and about and near one!  You know why? The menu is extensive and everything I've had thus far is delicious and done right, the drinks are on point and the cheesecake is everything creamy and dreamy (that one is for you my good friend Germanicure) but Truth! If you haven't experienced lunch or dinner here then I highly recommend it! My favorite and keep's me coming back and you should give it a try, I'm sure you wont be disappointed is: See Below... Tex-Mex Egg-Rolls Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp/ White Rice, Black Beans/ Sweet Plantains/ Mango Chutney Any Variety of their Cheesecakes Any one of their signature Cocktails Now you've been served!"
Kat S.,"Manhattan, NY",124,25,23,1.0,3/6/2017,"Very disappointed in this establishment? As soon as I walked in I already saw red flags ? Employees talking to one another while customers stand waiting to be acknowledged. The food was awful ! I ordered the skinnylious burger and was like rubber meat ? I imagine this is now a burger would taste like a week later ??? The service was dreadful ! Our waitress had a difficult time hearing our order and was constantly saying "" WHAT""?? No excuse me, what ! I absolutely can look pass those things, however, she barely came back to check on things, our food came out cold, never asked if we needed anything else, that was a blessing though, I couldn't wait to leave !  I would have rather went to Burger King ( which I don't go too) for better food, believe that ?!?  Find somewhere else to have lunch/dinner or cocktails, it truly is a terrible restaurant."
Naaz I.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",24,86,163,5.0,4/11/2017,"Delicious food and absolutely delicious cheese cake. I recommend the mango cheesecake ! Besides that i thought the manager was super rude, which sort of ruined the experience. Otherwise i would still come for their food and cake!"
Lina R.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",0,4,,4.0,9/22/2017,"I've been coming here for years and I am satisfied every time! The food is great, and I've sampled the whole menu. The service is great and if there's ever an issue, management is so great in helping solve issues and/or making you happy"
Lori Y.,"Harrison, NJ",62,45,19,5.0,3/4/2017,We love this company. And this location did not disappoint us. We went and sat at the bar without knowing it was Happy Hour. So we ordered off the happy hour menu and it was great! The food and the drinks. We were in and out within an hour. Service was excellent!!!
Vivian M.,"Hackensack, NJ",69,28,1,1.0,1/21/2017,Shame on you Cheesecake Factory.  Lousy service. Dirty plate. You lost my business.   You sat my husband and I at a small table behind a pillar. Ten minutes go by no waiter. Tick Tock Tick Tock. Still no waiter. A very nice waiter offered to get us bread till our waiter comes. I said no thank you. I do not want to sit here and wait any longer. He was very nice and sat us at another table. HA!!!  We sit down and the first thing I noticed is a dirty plate with a napkin on it.  Yeah right. My husband and I walked out.  I went back inside to talk to a manager. She questioned the dirty plate. REALLY!!  That's not possible. REALLY!!  I know a dirty plate when I see one.  And I know bad service and a manager with a attitude when I see that too!    Bye bye
Bunny E.,"Fairfield, NJ",2,8,1,3.0,7/22/2017,"Very good food, used to go to the old location alot. The new location has different people and the service just isnt that great anymore. Needs better service"
Jose G.,"Teaneck, NJ",64,7,3,1.0,7/14/2017,"Done with this place, even within their new location nothing has been improved. Tight sitting areas where you can barely hear because your so close others. Also, botched our steak dinners. We order medium cooked steaks and it came out well done. Very disappointed."
Tom G.,"Rutherford, NJ",165,217,2217,4.0,5/8/2016,"Not long ago I saw a photo taken by Yelper Tina C. of Plainview, NY of an Oreo Cheese Cake. I was craving for a taste and I looked up the Cheesecake Factory and realize that they are a franchised and their are at half a dozen near me within driving distance and one in a place I used to live, Hackensack NJ. The web site menu had more than a dozen cheese cakes and had take out too, which made it even more convenient for me since now I don't need to do a solo sit down just for dessert. The decor of the Hackensack restaurant is nice and it is big with two dinning sections and one with a full bar. They have a parking lot and they are part of the up-sale River Side Mall. So it was easy to do some shopping and have a bite to eat on my visits I must have gone to the Cheesecake Factory 8 times and half of that I stayed to eat there. Always for dessert, and mostly for cheese cake, the other times I had Strawberry Shortcake, Black Out, and Carrot cake. So for the cheese cakes I had Oreo, Strawberry, Godiva Chocolate, Red Velvet, Snickers Chocolate, Salted Carmel, Lemon Mousse Meringue, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. And this is only a third of what is available. They all taste good and better than you would think from a franchised restaurant, but of course some of the cheese cakes tasted better than the others. They are light cheese cakes and they don't give you oversize slices, with lots of cream and pliantly of strawberries for the strawberries cakes including a 6 inch round mini. My top three are: 1) Strawberry Cheese cake and the Shortcake. 2) Salted Carmel 3) Raspberry Truffle The atmosphere and staff were friendly but real busy so be a little patent they will get to your needs ASP..  One note is the cake slices are huge like 10 inches high so plan on shearing with someone and make it even more fun. Plus you can ask for more strawberries and whip cream with your dessert."
Michelle M.,"Bergenfield, NJ",24,4,,1.0,8/31/2017,"Slow service, a bit disorganized. Very unenthusiastic staff, and food and desserts are not proportional to price. Compared to other locations, same chain- this is an inadequate representation of other restaurants. Going to grand luxe at garden state plaza next time instead."
