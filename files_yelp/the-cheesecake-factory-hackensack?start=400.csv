Kat K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,,4.0,6/28/2012,You just can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory:-) There is something for everyone in the family. Portions are generous and food is good. If your lucky and there is no long wait then you only need to enjoy the food! Staff is very friendly and nice.
Michael W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1677,536,1162,3.0,5/6/2009,I ate here like 4 years ago...so I cant remember what I ordered...I did eat at the location somewhere in california tho.
Marc F.,"River Edge, NJ",111,71,11,4.0,10/1/2009,"Honestly, i want to hate this place because its a chain restaurant, but its definitely not bad at all. Large portions, good cheesecake, Above average food...its nothing to cry home about but definitely a ""yes"" if anyone suggests going here. I dont feel like adding to what other people are saying or even take away, because i agree with the haters and the lovers alike, but its still overall...a great chain restaurant. You will never hear me say that again."
Steve C.,"West Orange, NJ",64,98,2,1.0,7/21/2012,"Horrible. We went during the day at around noon on a weekday. Hardly peak hours, not all the tables were full. I was expecting good service and food that was given care when prepared. We didn't receive either. We didn't get a bread basket, we didn't get drinks until we hammered passerby waiters for one. We waited 30 minutes for tacos in a lettuce leaf. Horrible, will not be returning."
margareta b.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,2,,5.0,12/14/2010,"They have an excellent assortment of cakes. My favorite is the Tiramisu cheesecake. For every festive occasion I buy a cake from their menu.I would recommend them to all who appreciate good taste.  Sincerely,  Margareta B. Stanojevic"
Vanessa M.,"New York, NY",0,100,,3.0,7/4/2012,"The food is not bad, but I feel they can do better!!! The dessert is awesome!!! They are all good!! Any dessert you try you will fall in love with it, trust me you will not be disappointed!!"
John L.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,3,,4.0,5/30/2014,love this place...veggie burger is the best. sometimes it gets extremely busy ( weekends). Best bet is to go between 3 - 6.
Andrew W.,"New York, NY",13,108,,4.0,9/12/2007,"I've eaten here way too many times. I still like it once a month now. I have been weaned off my edible crack, however I can and will have that relapse. I suggest the Orange Chicken.  The specials never change. I never order them. I will eat at least 2 baskets of their wheat bread.  Corporate food, me encanta tu!"
Roberto M.,"Anaheim, CA",8,29,,3.0,1/8/2008,"Been to CF too many times to count. I won't be suprised it it's over 100. When they first came to NJ I was very impressed with the food. They had alot of good stuff to try. But as time went by the food seemed very simple. It's just dressed up better. If I have to pick CF or Houstons. Houstons anyday. But if it was about desserts CF will win that battle.  Maybe i'm just grumpy they took out my favorite meal many ages ago. I do miss my Chino Latino Steak. Oh well maybe I will find another love, maybe."
Sasha N.,"New York, NY",139,258,15,3.0,7/12/2009,"what a disgraceful experience...! the food however was good so i cannot complain too much on that front. between the three of us, we ordered garlic noodles, porto burger and cajun pasta (minus chicken)... we also had the spinach and artichoke dip which was fabulous...  but the guy serving us was filling the retard quota... i mean really... i usually have no issues with servers because i am not fussy.. but he was just.. well... special me: hi, may i please have some extra napkins him: napkins? you want more napkins? me: yes thank you him: r you sure?  me: um yes i asked for them  him: ok how many did you say?  him: what would you like to drink?  me: water no ice please  him: lemon and ice?  me: hmm, okay lemon but no ice him: no lemon and ice it is  me: no no .. just regular temperature water and lemon  him: you want lemon?  me: it doesn't matter - just water will be fine too  him: so no lemon?  me: yes thats okay he brings water with ice  argh"
Caroline A.,"Fairfax, VA",1136,1178,22,4.0,9/2/2008,"Yes, we drove all the way to Hackensack because this is my friend's favorite restaurant. In fact, he couldn't believe I never went to the CF on Michigan Avenue back home.  I realize this is a chain, but I like it and can always expect consistent quality of food. I love the brown bread. It is my absolute favorite. I can eat a whole roll by myself. Steve thought I was a weirdo when I  kept asking for the brown bread. I can't help it. I am obsessed.  I had the lunch size portion of their cobb salad. It was HUGE and I only finished a third of the salad. It was seriously one of the best cobb salads I've ever had. Steve had the Chicken Picada. He ate the whole thing and loved it. The mashed potatoes at CH are pretty special. I'm sure they use half a stick of butter in them, but they are so deliciously whippy, chunky and good.  Yay Jersey!"
Julie L.,"Orange County, CA",152,140,55,2.0,8/14/2009,"I'm usually not a huge fan of Cheesecake factory food, but my sister wanted to come here for lunch so I came with here. We both ordered lunch specials; I got the BBQ Pizza/Salad and my sis' got the Shrimp with Angel Hair. First off my salad, was just horrible, i don't know if it was the dressing, veggies, or both but i took one bite and just but that aside. Then came my pizza, it really greasy and really salty. I was pretty disappointed. My sister's shrimp with angel hair was a fail too. She said it just did not taste good, and she ended up leaving most of it too.  And our server took forever to come around with our check and refills and such. It was a busy because of it being lunch time, but the quality of food and slow service, makes me not want to come back. I want to like cheesecake factory, i really do, but I always choose the wrong item and end up being really disappointed. The only thing that redeems Cheesecake factory is their cheesecake, my recent favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Its Cheesecake and red velvet cake in one. I took it home, but I enjoyed it with a nice glass of milk. It hit the spot.  Maybe I should just come here for the cheesecake cause the food has disappointed me one too many times."
Lauren G.,"New York, NY",23,123,1,1.0,12/29/2012,"Ugh. I just discovered the fried macaroni and cheese burger which is absolutely mouth watering but, I will NEVER return here again. I came here with my mom and grandma and a hate for cilantro runs in our family. We ordered our food and asked our waiter to make sure there was no cilantro in anything. A few minutes later, he came back and told us that the fish tacos that my mom had ordered has cilantro in the salsa. So, without any problems, we told him we'll just take the salsa on the side. When the tacos came out, we noticed that there was cilantro not only inside but sprinkled on top. We asked the waiter to take it back so, he did. Then, he came back with the same plate (although it looked like the cilantro was picked off a little bit) and said that it was parsley. No. It was still cilantro. A lot of it. We didn't even bother sending it back because the kitchen staff refused to take responsibility. This is nothing on the waiter - he was very nice... well, maybe it's on him a little but, mostly the kitchen staff. Their attitude towards this problem really ruined the entire meal and my entire feeling towards this place... so much that I'm giving up my fried mac and cheese."
Fred G.,"Ridgewood, NY",25,93,62,5.0,9/24/2011,order the Mai Tai and the Wasabi Ahi Tuna! a mini vacation as far as im concerned!
Carla M.,"New York, NY",236,341,1,4.0,5/24/2009,"The food at this place is great!  The menu can be a little overwhelming, they offer a plethora of choices.  The wait can be long at peak times but it's worth the wait!"
Lisa R.,"Cranbury, NJ",1,13,,4.0,7/14/2008,"I have been going to Cheesecake for years. I've been to the Hackensack, Edison, Freehold, Cherry Hill, and King of Prussia locations. Everytime you go expect a wait, expecially during peak hours. The shortest amount of time i waited was 10 mins and the longest was over 3hrs. Luckily it was in a mall so I shopped while i waited. The portions are huge so be prepaired to take home leftovers. The options for food is endless. The menu is a book, literally. The deserts are never a let down and again they are big. I love the decor of the place, very tuscan-ish like. It's very warm and inviting. So for food and atmosphere alone it's a 4, for wait time it's a 2. Waiting can definatly suck, but the food is worth the wait."
Edward I.,"Jersey City, NJ",67,536,11,5.0,5/14/2006,"Hear Ye all who are poor and hungry, they've opened a new Cheesecake Factory in Wayne but this location in Hackensack is convenient for those in the northern NJ area who can drive. There's parking but of course there's so many people wanting to chow down that the line is a little long. Just hang out next door at the Barnes & Noble while waiting. They've got average priced food but they feed you a LOT! Sometimes I don't even get the appetizer because I'd be too full to finish the main dish. But I still like the one in Union Square San Francisco better."
Melissa M.,"Teaneck, NJ",24,3,,1.0,9/5/2011,"I went to cheezecake factory on saturday placed an order to go and noticed the fridge in back of the cashier where all the cheezecakes are kepted, with all the delicious tasting strawberries they have right? WRONGGGG, there is a bin at the bottom of the fridge where all the strawberries are kept inbetween a soaked up rag of strawberry juice. The bin looks old and dirty and who know how long that soaked up rag of straberry juice has been in the bin. I asked the cashier when a customer orders a fresh bowl of strawberries is that where it comes from, she made a disgusted face and said yes. So before you think about ordering a strawberry cheezecake take a look at that bin."
Maome S.,"Emerson, NJ",28,209,4,5.0,11/4/2007,"we had dinner and lunch here many times... i've written about CF in other reviews and b/c it's a chain i won't add another substantive review here. however, i will add my 2 cents to combat bob p.'s review below.  he signed up here to lower the rating?  what a riot.  what kind of business meeting is it when a ""rich guy"" and his wife takes him out to dinner to discuss business?  perhaps bob p. was on a prepubescent pornography interview where he does the ""rich guy"" and his wife after the cheesecake. but bob p. mentions that he didn't have the cheesecake.  perhaps the ""rich guy"" and his wife were so repulsed and saw right through bob p.'s pretentious attitude there was no boinking afterwards. thanks bob p.  we will hold our breath and look for you starring in upcoming XXX features."
Shipra K.,"Leonia, NJ",17,38,49,1.0,1/1/2011,"I have been here a few times and honestly, I have no good reason why. I mostly come for big lunches or dinners that other people have planned. The only thing that makes up for the food are the sizes of the portions but who wants to eat a huge plate of overpriced diner food? Not to mention, I have always been treated with atrocious service at this place--something ALWAYS goes wrong. Recently, I had to wait 40 minutes and was given a pager and was not told that I couldn't leave the restaurant. I went to the Barnes and Noble which was literally next door, came back after 40 minutes demanding that I be seated only to be told that I was called long ago and that they can't guarantee that the pager functions outside of the restaurant.  I was LIVID. What is the purpose of a pager if I have to stay within an arms reach anyway? The cashier didn't even apologize for failing to mention this vital detail. I demanded to speak to the supervisor who patronized me with a measly appetizer to shut me and my family up. He and the cashier were even whispering to each other and smirking right in front of us. We finally left after being seated--the idea of paying for such horrendous service disgusted me."
