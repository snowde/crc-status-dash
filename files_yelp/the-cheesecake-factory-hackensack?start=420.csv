Koku K.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,219,91,4.0,11/25/2007,"I've never had a problem w/Cheesecake Factory.  The food is good, and they have nice specialty drinks.  It gets packed and LOUD in here, so be prepared to yell at the person sitting across from you. Of course the cheesecake is tops, but I'm always annoyed by the advertisements plastered all over the menus."
James Ryan Alexander M.,"Wall Township, NJ",35,82,3,4.0,8/26/2008,"Had never been to a cheesecake location till this one and have now been several times. -Even though I am not a big cheesecake fan, the menu for this location and the assortment of other foods other than cheesecake is very impressive. The nice thing is that with the current economic situation the once 2 hour line is now 5 mins. Excellent servers and good food."
Janethy D.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",0,6,,5.0,1/8/2010,"We had the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes. I loved it. I ve been there 9-10 times and everytime i had a good experience with delicious foods. You must try the strawberry cheesecake, it is yumy, yumy and yumy."
Maria D.,"Denver, CO",301,1115,3,3.0,12/28/2006,"Faaabulous lighting, but almost undrinkable cocktails. My strawberry martini tasted like fucking rubbing alcohol and my cousin refused to let me order another one, especially since we dodged a bullet when they didn't card us and, as  another yelper noted, I have ""good genes"" and look like I am 15, and I forgot my ID at my parent's house. Two apps were more than enough food for two hungry ladies, but as expected, I was less than impressed with either of them. The buffalo blasts were basically fried dough with a little bit of chicken and the egg rolls were supposed to have this avo cream salsa with them that basically tasted like green mayo. Speaking of the egg rolls, they were like all onions. It's just like... is this really the best the suburbs have to offer? They also insist on playing music even though the place is so loud you can hardly hear the Blues Traveler & Matchbox 20. Of course I was able to pick them out since that is the fine music of my fine generation. Anyway, for your money, if you're gonna be dining at the Riverside Mall, I think you could probably do better at Houston's or Morton's.  Or the Coach House & Hooters across the road."
