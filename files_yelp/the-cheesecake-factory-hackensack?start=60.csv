John B.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",27,11,3,5.0,8/25/2017,I finally had the opportunity to check out the new location and it's nicley done interior.  The wait was about 25 min but the host was very friendly and made time go by with a polite conversation. All my food came out in a timely manor and was spot on.
Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",325,963,1662,3.0,7/14/2015,"This place always has a wait on weekends, but the wait times they give are pretty accurate, so you can walk around the mall. Their skinnylicious menu is actually pretty decent too. I had the Tuscan Chicken. Not sure how restaurants do it, but they always manage to not overcook chicken breast, which is awesome. It was a pretty generous portion, especially with the vegetables. Cheesecake factory is a good option when everyone wants something different. Of course the best thing here is dessert, so go for some cheesecake. I occasionally pick one up to bring to a party or something."
Kimberly K.,"North Bergen, NJ",2,12,19,5.0,2/18/2017,Drinks are tasty. Food is great. Avocado rolls and sauce are a must have. Service is always great. No complaints here.
Laura S.,"Tenafly, NJ",0,13,5,1.0,8/3/2017,"Atrocious.  This is a high priced diner with awful food and terrible service.  Multiple requests for bread, only to arrive an hour after seating.  Filet mignon ($30) arrived moo-ing. No offer to comp.  Even after it went back to oven while everyone else was done with meal. Still not cooked properly. Shrimp overdone. Service and management unresponsive.   Wanted to know if we were interested in dessert.  If dinner was this awful, and took over an hour to arrive, why would we be interested in dessert? Safe your money and head to a diner."
Deepti B.,"Bronx, NY",1,14,4,4.0,8/12/2017,"Every single time has been amazing. There's one bartender on week days around happy hour (4:30-5:00) ish; she's the best. Very attentive & sweet & friendly. Even though I go there every once in 2,3 months she remembers exactly what I like. I like their food a lot. Drinks are very consistent & well made."
Alex G.,"Ridgewood, NJ",0,6,,1.0,10/29/2017,Worst service ever. It took 30 minutes to get appetizers then they gave me my sandwich with no sauce. The person I was with never got a hamburger that he ordered. Manager was apologizing to everyone all night and forgot about us. Pathetic service! 2nd time this happened to me at this Cheesecake Factory and I will never go back. The funny part is the food is actually pretty good.
Kam G.,"Bergenfield, NJ",0,6,5,1.0,2/26/2017,"I'm going to keep this short because my real review will be going to corporate but yesterday night I had a terrible experience with this Cheesecake Factory and I didn't even dine in. I was kept waiting for over 20 minutes on the phone to place the order and over 30 minutes for my food once I was there because my order was non existent. It is clear that there is poor management (who I directly spoke to) and staff: It is far more understanding to hear a manager take responsibility on behalf of the staff than to justify the problem with different excuses in a rude manner. This location is a hot mess.  In addition, the specific order that the manager took himself was incorrect."
Jay R.,"Old Tappan, NJ",0,2,,4.0,5/6/2017,Really enjoyed meal here early on Sat night. Avocado egg rolls were delicious as shared appetizer. I had grilled pork chop which was perfectly cooked. My wife had shrimp with pasta that she really enjoyed. Big portion size and decent service in a busy night. Good value for food.
Chris H.,"Manhattan, NY",48,146,9,1.0,3/4/2017,"If they put as much energy into seating people as they did making sure my 7 month pregnant wife didn't sit at one of their 20 empty tables, maybe they wouldn't have a 30 minute wait."
Miriam G.,"Teaneck, NJ",198,36,16,5.0,4/22/2017,One of my go to places for salad. The salad are generous portions for the price and always filled with amazing flavors. I never second guess my order even if I try something new because I know it will be amazing.
Thomas A.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",122,302,72,3.0,8/17/2015,"After years of having friends recommend the place and them always ranking in the 'Top 10' for worst dishes (calories, fat content) we decided to check them out.    A big busy bustling place with a big diner-style menu and they show a page worth of pizzas so by default they were added into 'The Pizza Project 2015'. Like all other chains - it's hard to resist being able to feed the entire family and the adults get their slosh on all for under $70 (and that's with some serious doggie-bags to bring home).  Similar to Donald Trump's current lead with the GOP's - you can't help but admire that the Cheesecake Factory is so brazen and in-your-face and just plows ahead with ridiculous portions and could care less about obesity and heart disease. The pizza lunch special - the salad was completely okay for a few mouthfuls of lettuce and a sliver of tomato. Their Portofino Pizza - surprisingly good crust, solid amount of chicken and peppers.  Only real gripe was the thin and watery pesto that was leaking underneath to make the pie soggy. After my next yearly check-up I don't think my doctor will allow me to go back there but otherwise it was a completely decent pitstop when you're at the mall shopping for back-to-school stuff."
Irene C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",215,231,700,4.0,5/6/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, I am not afraid to say it out loud. I always have a great time here with great food and nice service. I was here tonight with coworker and we had a blast. Our waiter Koriey is very attentive and constantly checked our table to see if everything was alright. Food was always decent and in huge portion, you can always make sure you will have leftovers for next day's lunch!"
Beth C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",23,3,19,2.0,6/23/2017,"It's Friday night, and I just called and was told that they don't take reservations.  Hopefully when we walk in around 7pm, it won't be too packed for a party of 4."
David L.,"New York, NY",808,1096,1003,4.0,9/3/2015,"Three of us had a wonderful experience here last night. Although there were a lot of people waiting in line, since the place is so massive, we were sat in about 5 minutes. Our waitress was really friendly, as was the busser fellow who brought everything out.  What really won everyone over at our table was my order of Hibachi Steak -- a large portion of Hanger Steak (which I asked for rare) which was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender, on a bed of bean sprouts and onions, with a side of skin-on red-potatoes and wasabi butter, accompanied by a sort of light teriyaki sauce -- this dish was banging, and my friends kept offering to trade me bites of theirs just so they could keep taking more bites of mine. Oh, and the breads they brought to our table, three different types, were warm and delicious. My friend's salad was everything she expected, while my other friend's Chicken Tortillas came with excellent beans and amazing corn cakes but the main component was underwhelming. For dessert, I didn't care much for the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake but the Key Lime Cheesecake was absolutely addictive... I never got to eat at chain restaurants or even fast food as a kid, and living in NYC it's really never even been a consideration for me, but I've always heard great things about the Cheesecake Factory and now I know why. This was my second experience and it was terrific. Although my first experience at the Yonkers location was a nightmare, I'm glad I gave the company a second chance, and this location was just great. I cannot wait to return again for that Hibachi Steak!"
Christina C.,"Hackensack, NJ",15,104,11,3.0,3/5/2017,I only come here now to get a slice of cheesecake for my husband. They are way to crowded for my liking. I used to like their orange chicken but I guess they changed cooks and it is mediocre now to say the least.. their cheesecake is great but they give u a smaller slice now with the famous chocolate cake they have. Also the girl who is the cashier in the front for the cheesecakes has the nastiest attidude I've ever seen. She's a heavy set Caucasian girl and is absolutely rude. Asking for more whip cream is like asking for $100 to her I guess- u should see the way she looks at u. Other than that this location is ok.
Dariene S.,"River Edge, NJ",11,40,7,4.0,6/25/2017,"Chicken Katsui tastes awesome as well as Godiva cheesecake. The wait was a bit ridiculous, so can't give it a better rating until they start taking reservations. They should at least adopt a mobile approach like California Pizza Kitchen where they just text you when your table  is almost ready so you can roam the mall in the meantime. Update.... I'm really sad the chicken katsui as been taken off the menu. Don't order the tiramisu... a subpar tiramisu shouldn't run you ~$10. Order a Chris' Outrageous cheesecake instead."
Nafin E.,"Hawthorne, NJ",45,8,3,1.0,9/28/2017,"Don't even bother coming near here. They do not take reservations, which is why the whole restaurant is a zoo. The wait for a table at night takes longer than eating a meal. The wait for a table combined with the hour it takes to make your food makes this the worst restaurant to ever go to. Not worth the wait ever. You're better off at Grand Lux Cafe on 208."
Nicole J.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Horrible service!!!!! I will NEVER come back to this Cheesecake Factory!!! My server Rachel couldn't have been any less interested in taking my order, she was super rude and super inattentive...every time I asked Rachel for something she always seemed to be bothered by my request...even when I was asking for more water she rolled her eyes as if it was a huge inconvenience....she also gave us all the wrong food ( proving my point she couldn't have cared less about taking my order, she clearly wasn't even paying attention to what I was saying) it was honestly the worst experience I've had in a restaurant...who ever hired her should have to be trained again...my 8 year old daughter would have done a better job!"
Philip D.,"Glen Rock, NJ",0,24,,1.0,6/16/2017,"The food is usually good here, but I have to share my last experience. My wife had 2 gift cards that I received through work. She tried to use them recently and was told that 1 card had a 0 balance.  She was embarrassed as we had just received the cards in the mail. She paid the balance in cash and we called the distribution company the next day. After several emails and calls the Cheesecake Factory refused to honor the card and said that it was used the day they refused to honor it. I am not sure if it was the waitress or computer, but someone got our money.  Not returning in my lifetime."
Rachel H.,"New Milford, NJ",5,31,106,2.0,11/24/2016,"Came at 5 for an early dinner at happy hour. Service was slow, food was alright. Placed in the bar, which wasn't too kid friendly. Don't order the nachos: the chips were actually deep fried and way too greasy. Just ""meh"" overall. Usually I like it, but it not this"
