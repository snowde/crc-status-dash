Jamie S.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",1,9,6,4.0,9/10/2016,"I have never had a bad experience here. It does get a little too packed around dinner time. Sometimes, the wait time can be around an hour. Other than that, the food is amazing as always. The chefs never disappoint me. Their Long Island iced tea is pretty good. I've tried several plates from here. I love The Factory Meatloaf and Jambalaya Pasta, but the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken is my favorite  it's such a flavorful dish. I'm pretty used to spicy food so I'm gonna say nothing is spicy here even though they say they are.. but I don't care cause it all tastes so good anyways! Really great customer service. The waiters here are all really nice. Never received a rude one. Definitely come here for a nice dinner and be prepared to eat a lot. their places are pretty full."
Allyson S.,"Palm Coast, FL",20,26,,3.0,5/12/2017,"We have gone for dinner at this location a couple times now where they have messed up our dinner or forgot something. Last night, our waitress seemed to be in such a hurry to get our order, and guess what, it was wrong again. We will start to try other spots locally before coming back."
Pats F.,"Mahwah, NJ",0,3,,5.0,9/25/2017,This is such nice restaurant the setting and the lighting is cozy. Their crispy chicken costelleta (not sure if I spelt that right) is out of this world. The lemon sauce that is drizzled over it adds to the flavor . The Nutella and Godiva cheesecake after dinner is also a plus. Definitely craving that cheesecake now!
Carina L.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2017,HORRIBLE SERVICE- waiter was terrible! Super slow and couldnt answer simple question!
Marissa K.,"Teaneck, NJ",86,116,366,3.0,9/15/2016,So I would only go here for the happy hour. The food and drinks are otherwise way over priced for what you get. Drinks are basically half off during happy hour. The food menu is great for a happy hour. They have a lot of selections. This place gets really busy so come a little early. They also have a skinny menu.
Nancy R.,"Mahwah, NJ",0,28,,4.0,5/26/2017,"Always a bit of a wait, but it is for good reason. The food is great and the staff is very professional. Portion sizes are big and fit the price. The buffalo blasts are amazing!"
Karen S.,"North Bergen, NJ",16,44,139,4.0,1/12/2016,"No wait on a Saturday afternoon which was lovely. First timer and the menu was overwhelming! They sure want to be all inclusive!  Mac and cheese bites were an awesome start and a recommendation from our waiter.  I had a sale from the skinnylicious menu and it was perfect and more than enough! My friend had garlic chicken which I tried and enjoyed as well. Large portions, great drinks. The cheese cake of course was to die for. We shared the salted caramel and had left over!"
Armel J.,"Paris, France",139,51,82,2.0,2/26/2017,"I'm not very at ease to write a negative review but the way you're received when you call them is very disappointing for this kind of place. I spotted that they don't get reservation but the way to tell it and the way they let you understand that you have an accent is really bad. My conclusion, they don't really need new customers."
MaryRosr E.,"Hackensack, NJ",2,8,25,5.0,10/6/2016,There is nothing negative I can say about Cheesecake Factory! Fabulous food and grand desserts! Love it!
Sara S.,"Union City, NJ",52,60,1,1.0,8/16/2017,We received our bread and it was hard as a rock. The chicken dish I ordered tasted like old chicken with no flavor. Had to ask for water refills. Never going to this location.
Ava R.,"Lodi, NJ",0,13,24,5.0,4/7/2017,The Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta is amazing! Don't forget to ask for extra sauce on the side because the pasta sometimes gets dry. Amazing customer service!
Gloria H.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",222,238,161,4.0,9/18/2015,"My 4 star are ALL for my server the last time I was there- Maribely S. I loved her. She was the image of the perfect waitress- friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and patient. Normally I wouldn't pay much attention to my meal at a place like The Cheesecake Factory, but our waitress really made the meal so enjoyable. I was out with some coworkers and we were being ultra difficult, not being able to decide on drinks and food. Maribely was the nicest, most helpful server at a chain restaurant I've ever encountered. She recommended the avocado egg rolls, which we all ended up loving, even though we don't generally like deep-fried anythings. I ended up getting some sort of fish tacos that I actually really enjoyed, on her suggestion. I walked away very happy with my overall experience and would go back if I was in the area. It's conveniently located in a high end shopping center (there's a coffee bar and some comfortable couches around the mall), five minutes from endless other shopping options."
Meg F.,"San Jose, CA",0,58,30,5.0,9/6/2016,"Kale salad (very good!! Would be better without the raisins) Calamari and texmex are great appetizers but will make u full. Chicken madeira (most popular meal) tasted incredible, so did the pan-seared salmon and chipotle linguini.   Spicy Chicken cashew was amazing too! Banana cheescake lovely! Service and ambience were outstanding. Next time I wouldnt order appetizers to enjoy my main meal fully."
Isaac W.,"West Nyack, NY",8,10,7,4.0,10/19/2016,"We did my sons birthday party here. Meal was OK but Ribeye steak is literally terrible. It was dry, thin and I received well done instead of medium rare. The reason for 4 stars still is a great service by Novell who didn't charge us for teas and Birthday cake as well because of steak. She is very kind and caring."
Jungmoon P.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,3,,1.0,3/4/2017,The food is good but when u go there when it's full you get terrible seatin g. And when you want to move your seat they say u need to wait 50 or 50 more minutes.
Ashley B.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,1,,1.0,6/14/2017,"This place is getting zero stars for me. Customer service sucks. Waited 60 minutes for our order only to find out it was ""sold"" like this is some fast food restaurant. Manager was not helpful at all throughout this entire process. Will not be returning. Even though they have a new location, it's the same BS wervic"
Nick A.,"Teaneck, NJ",82,23,21,1.0,10/22/2016,"Came to have lunch with my wife and daughter.. went to check in and the host with the piercing through her lip was fooling around while the other host was being serious. We sat down to find a very friendly waitress Kendal. We ordered our drinks and my 1 year olds food. Spaghetti and meatball.  Her food came right out. I tasted her food as always. Restaurants tend to undercooked pasta for children just to get it out. Anyways when I tasted it it was beyond salty and still kinda raw. The server was very sweet and took it back to the kitchen. She totally understood. She came back very upset stating that the manager couldn't remake the pasta without salt. This raised several questions to myself. A restaurant this large with so many locations, who claim to make everything here. They don't have a pot to boil water and make pasta? Well I asked to speak to a manager. A sloppy looking manager with his shirt untucked and stains under his armpits came to the table. Very offensive told us he can not do it. Every time I asked him if they had a pot to boil water he would respond, the pot we use has salt. When I asked if I looked at the kitchen would I find a pot, cause I would cook I if they don't want to. At this point he told me they would do it but would take a long time. As if he was trying to selling me out of buying the pasta. Needless to say my daughter loves pasta. About 15 mins later Kendal returned with a huge smile with the pasta. Again I tasted it the pasta was still undercooked and still salty. Looks like they used pre cooked pasta and tried to wash the salt off. COME ON... the server felt so bad telling us she wanted to cool it right for us but she isn't a cook.  the 3rd time it came out I thought for sure the manager would stop by the table. Nope it was the server. Pasta still had salt on it but st this point I was tired of waiting  I got the Shepard pie which was average My wife got the grilled salmon with mash and asparagus. She asked for it cooked med and it was charred on one end  We asked them to hold the food until my daughter food came out. It appeared that the food was made and it just sat. Mine was cold and my wife's was at room temp at best. So no one really ate since my daughter takes naps at 12 and started to get cranky. She always naps after lunch today she didn't eat lunch. Thank Cheesecake Factory  So when the check came out I thought I would see the manager maybe get an apology from him for my kids food. Nope We were charged full price even though my daughters pasta took a 35mins to be cooked right!  When we left I asked the host the managers name and her response was ""he doesn't like us to tell people his name"". Agains thanks for a $70 lunch that no one ate."
Aysha S.,"New York, NY",458,64,14,4.0,12/30/2015,"This one is massive. Service is mediocre but I never had a terrible experience here. Their strawberry shortcake is always delightful. I really like their veggie burger - it's ingredients are very different compared to any veggie burger I've ever had. I tried the Louisiana pasta tonight and it really did blow away my expectations. Well seasoned, not drowned in sauce and there was a lot of chicken, very well proportioned to the amount of pasta there (and I ordered take out!) I suggest trying it.  It's a chain, just keep those expectations in mind."
Taaj F.,"Edgewater, NJ",85,53,82,5.0,8/27/2016,"The Cheese Cake Factory, especially this one in particular has been around for a while and I have to say it has yet to disappoint me... Pros: The food is A+ as well as their drinks. (I normally order their avocado rolls & margaritas) Their staff are always on point and attentive. Their menu has a lot to offer. Great for dining solo, date nights, happy hour etc.. Cons: Parking can be an issue sometimes but it's  totally worth the wait. - I highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory ~"
Meline V.,"New York, NY",579,242,511,4.0,8/19/2015,We went there for quick afternoon treat. It was quiet busy the service was good. The best part cheesecake & coffee! It's a good spot to stop by after shopping.
