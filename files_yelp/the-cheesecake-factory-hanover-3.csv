Loryn C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",262,53,94,4.0,12/1/2017,"Great place. I love the interior of the restaurant. We came at night and it had a nice dark lighting that really made the ambiance. I ordered the NY steak. This was easily one of the best steaks I've ever had. Juicy, good seasoning, and stayed true to its medium-well done cooking. Also the portions were big. They have a wide variety of food items on their menu, as well alcoholic beverages.  Giving this 4 stars because the service wasn't good. The food took forever to come out - more than 30 minutes. Even our initial drinks took like 15 minutes to come out. Our party was one of the only diners in the restaurant so I'm not sure why it took so long. I would come back. Hopefully they'll get faster at preparing food and stuff."
Erica S.,"Houston, TX",121,112,110,4.0,9/9/2017,"Visiting from Houston and decided to pop in here for the consistent food and a few drinks while sitting at the bar. Bartender Janie was professional, prompt and friendly! God bless the staff for the drunk morons they must have to put up with on a daily basis!  I ordered the Renee lunch plate which I didn't really care for only as the sandwich had far to much celery in the chicken salad for my taste. It wasn't chicken salad...it was celery salad. The baked potato soup was very yummy! It also comes with a garden salad but I opted to change to a Cesar for a $1 more. Not wild about the Cesar dressing either. It seemed watered down.  Drinks were great and poured on the heavy end. I ordered cheesecake to-go only as I was tired of the loud, drunk women sitting beside me at 3pm in the afternoon. (Eye roll!)  Cheesecake was perfect later on! I'd return to this location if back in the area."
Felicity W.,"Doswell, VA",15,7,4,3.0,9/5/2017,I give 3 stars cause the food was great!! But the service was horribly slow and our waitress only checked on us twice. She acted like we were inconveniencing her. We went in the middle of the day it wasn't busy at all. Will go back again because I love the food but wish service was better.
Kevin L.,"Towson, MD",0,7,1,5.0,1/7/2018,"Personally, from my experience, I do not understand the low reviews this place has received, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will be back again. My girlfriend and I came here for a New Years Eve dinner before heading out for our festivities for the night. Initially walking in, the interior fascinated us, as do all other Cheesecake Factory locations. It was well kept, neat, and very professional looking. The host/hostess were very nice and immediately placed us in a wait, though the wait was long, it was expected as Cheesecake is infamous for not taking reservations. Our waitress was very nice and uplifting, she recommended what was good on the menu and she was completely right! Overall, would come back again. Nice job!"
Julie P.,"College Park, MD",248,30,29,2.0,1/5/2018,"Unfortunately, my experience here was an incredible disappointment. The main issue my boyfriend and I had was with the pastas we ordered. Not only were they dry and bland, it felt like it was made in a rush or was frozen food. We could not even finish the plate or even half. The pasta was on the hard side and even the chicken did not have a taste. We heard great things about Cheesecake Factory and really wanted to like the food, but that was not the case. We also got the calamari as appetizer and it was good in my opinion. I would give that maybe 3.5 or 4 stars if I could rate the dish. The service was also great. Our waiter Long was amazing and friendly, but we will not be returning. In addition, the floors were not clean and made my booties slip! Being inside a huge casino I really expected better of the food & the floors."
Kenneth C.,"Washington, DC",96,50,77,3.0,12/19/2017,"I came on a weekday with a friend and the the Factory was predictably relatively quiet and clean. This location was pretty big and spacious and throughout the meal I had a great view of the reactions to the day's gambling/slot results. The food was good and similar to any other Cheesecake Factory meal which is really a product of the saying ""you get what you pay for and nothing more."""
Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",28,188,220,5.0,11/18/2017,"Great service! Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and helpful. I was torn between two dishes and he helped me decide on the Chicken Bellagio. It's crispy chicken over basil pasta and Parmesan cream sauce. It's topped with prosciutto and an arugula salad. It was very good and flavorful!"
Matt L.,"Dublin, CA",0,26,13,4.0,12/11/2017,Maybe you just need the right server. Food was good. Had the firecracker salmon and cauliflower for appetizers. Ribeye for the dinner... everything good I'm a fan. Walk out and gamble ... good in my book.
Kylie B.,"Arbutus, MD",49,42,67,5.0,12/18/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always good. I've been to a lot of locations in the area. I always get the fried mac and cheese balls, Chris' outrageous cheesecake, and strawberry lemonade. They're good but can be a little pricey so I usually omit an entree unless my parents are taking me. I like their Caesar salad too."
Madison K.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,2,,3.0,1/8/2018,"Just okay. Not my favorite Cheesecake Factory, I typically go out of my way to avoid this location although it's closer to me. Staff isn't the best."
Evie B.,"Silver Spring, MD",39,41,599,1.0,12/6/2017,"I've been to many CF locations and this one has the absolute worst customer service and is super slow. I ordered a lunch portion Santa Fe salad with no torilla strips and salad dressing on the side. I received a dinner portion with no torilla strips and it was already dressed. When I asked the server if this was a lunch or dinner portion he just shrugged instead of giving me an answer. When I inquired with the waiter he told me it was a dinner portion to which the entire table included me responded with ""I/She ordered a lunch portion. Then the waiter gave me the salad dressing I ordered on the side. I told him the salad was already dressed even though I ordered it on the side. So now we have two mistakes. The waiter never attempted to correct my order but instead offered me cheesecake. I didn't want cheesecake. I wanted my order correct. The reason why I wanted the salad with dressing on the side was because I knew I would not finish it and dressed salad does not work well for a doggie  bag. When I received the bill all the people at my table wanted to know if I was charged for the lunch or dinner portion. I asked the waiter and he said the dinner portion. I didn't complain because at this point I was over this entire experience. One of the people at the table suggested to the waiter to offer me a gift card but he stuck with the initial offer for cheesecake. I ended up picking something random from the dessert menu since I'm not big on dessert. I gave the dessert to my neighbor. So thank you CF for my $20 dessert that I didn't eat. As I suspected I was also unable to eat the rest of my salad for dinner so I trashed it."
Raymond A.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,9,10,5.0,11/26/2017,"Greetings, I was at your restaurant November 25, 2017. The Food was Delicious and Exquisite. My Lunch was Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and My Dessert was White Chocolate, Caramel & Macadamia Nut Cheesecake!!!  Great hospitality from the staff, our Gracious waiter was Gregory, he exemplifies what a waiter suppose to be... He was Kind, Knowledgeable & Polite. I had a Grear Afternoon!!!  I most definitely will recommend my Family & Friends to have Lunch or Dinner there!!!!"
Tishea D.,"Baltimore, MD",421,196,285,5.0,6/24/2017,"It was a great time here. I have NO complaints about anything. Well just a small one. They ran out of the Ahi Tuna and I really wanted it. My server was Antoinette and she was really on it. Not one time did I have to wonder where she was or look for her.  When I go to the Cheesecake factory I always order the exact same thing. Shrimp Scampi. I am going to grow up one day and try something different. I also tried the Korean Fried Cauliflower. That was delicious. I am actually about to eat it for breakfast in a few minutes.  The Cheesecake factory never disappoints me. I also had a peanut butter fudge cheesecake too as well.  This is a place for families, that drive Camry's and go to Disney. -Drake"
C J.,"Severn, MD",2,63,16,2.0,9/5/2017,First of all the food sucks. Second the server was inattentive. We asked for bread and was told the bread was still cooking. When we got the bread one loaf was hot the other two were old and stale. I ordered buffalo wings and asked for them to be cooked a little crispy instead it looked like they were double breaded and hard. My Aunt ordered the chicken Campanula. She said it was good. He didn't ask if we wanted more drinks which we did. He did not fill up my water until I asked. He did not ask my sister if she wanted anything when she joined us. He did not give us the check until we asked him to give it to us. What a mess! This guy's not getting a big tip from me today.
Tiffany A.,"Sterling, VA",54,44,130,2.0,6/11/2017,"Meh..it was okay. We ended up here after spending 3 hours in traffic trying to make an event. We were so hungry,  we just chose TCF by default.  The menu is so overwhelming..too many items to choose from. How can you really specialize is 100 dishes?? I ordered a simple cheese burger with fries.  The fries were soo incredibly salty and just warm. I didnt complain, I just didnt eat them.  My friend ordered a pasta dish that BARELY  had any sausage. The drinks were okay. If you're looking for a real basic experience, this is the place to go.  Not a foodies paradise by any means."
Gary G.,"Washington, DC",9,204,102,3.0,8/25/2017,"Arrived around 5:30pm on a Friday night and waited about 5 minutes before being seated. We tried a Carne Asada Steak Medallion dinner special that was delicious and reasonably priced compared to the rest of the menu. It came with six medallions, corn that was nicely seasoned, and enough rice to feed a family. It reminded me of a Japanese steakhouse that piles on the rice to have you walk away full. My wife and I were shocked at our $81 bill that included two bar drinks priced at $11 and $12...mojito and pink lemonade. My wife said we'll go elsewhere next time we want dinner and drinks at that cost. We bought cheesecake to-go which I'm looking forward to trying in a bit. Other than the cheesecake, I might try elsewhere before hurrying back."
Amanda B.,"Petersburg, VA",128,288,84,3.0,8/14/2017,"Your general Cheesecake Factory.  Large portions, good service, Elijah was amazing and attentive all night.  Drinks took a little while to come out, but food came out pretty quick.  The tables next to us both loved their meals as well, and ours were also fantastic.  The only thing is that the floors are slippery.  Not sure if it was just a fluke or if they are always like that."
Carmen M.,"Rockville, MD",310,130,611,4.0,8/19/2016,"Cheesecake Factory food usually comes in huge portions and is very delicious. This time, I didn't think that the food tasted all that great. I usually stick with the Farfalle pasta or the Jambalaya, but I wanted to be adventurous and tried the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta because it looked good in pictures. Honestly, I think it was a little too sweet. It had a weird sweet and sour taste, and the only spicy thing about it was that there was a little kick at the end. My sister got the Louisiana pasta which is pretty similar to the Farfalle pasta dish, but the Louisiana pasta didn't really taste like anything. It was just very greasy and the chicken seemed a bit dry.  After reading other reviews, I can see what they mean about the service. The hostess said that there wasn't no wait, but we still waited about 15 min. Also the waiter took a while to take our order and bring our check after we were done."
SonSo ..,"Hanover, MD",0,14,47,3.0,10/8/2017,The brunch at Cheesecake Factory was very enjoyable. Waffles and French Toast were very good and filling. Do not overlook the Cheesecake Factory when wanting a good brunch
Tava W.,"Bowie, MD",83,104,235,5.0,9/13/2016,Tex mex egg rolls and a pineapple mojito!! When I come here that's all I want!  This past visit I got the salmon and scrimp that came with asparagus and mashed potatoes & my hunnie ordered the fish tacos. Mine was delicious and flavorful. His tacos I really wasn't digging bc of the corn tortilla...and something about his rice and beans...??? They were bland...I told him he should've ordered his usual.... Anyhoo- we always come back...especially when we are feeling lucky!
William P.,"Charleston, SC",846,581,4633,3.0,6/28/2016,"Yeahh! I sat at the bar and ordered an healthy salad: chicken was a little dry and it was a little sweet. Lights at the bar were kind of dimmed! Menu was not exceptional, I was on the mood for fish, but only salmon was offered; tuna and shrimps were offered as appetizers. Of course a lot of cake selections were available, but that is not my kind of nourishment. Bartender was nice and attentive to my needs. Wine selection is limited and a little expensive, but the wine I got was decent!"
Candyce B.,"Charlotte, NC",320,767,877,3.0,11/30/2016,"So this place is pretty much like all the others. It's packed so expect a wait. Initially I was irritated by the hostess service level because when I walked up to put my name on the list another guy just rushed up to the counter in front of me (and the other folks in line) and asked what the wait time was. Instead of telling him that she'd be right with him she told him the time and then asked how many were in his party. And gave him a pager...so he was in front of everyone! Are you freaking kidding me?! Did you not see the line of other folks standing here waiting?!   Ugh. Thankfully our wait wasn't that long and our sever Erin was fantastic. But the food was just okay. We ordered a pina colada, house salad, sausage flatbread and teriyaki chicken. Meh. It was all just okay but I'd probably pass on this place next time."
Tiera K.,"Baltimore, MD",31,77,397,4.0,6/26/2017,"All my friends I'm a fan of This particular restaurant chain...this location in Maryland is one of my favorites. I'm not sure if it's in my mind but I get larger portions at this location than others I been too. Of course this location can get busy since it's connected to the Maryland Live Casino. The customer service I received the few times was excellent of course I never had a problem my last visit my sever name was Antionette, she was such a doll. She was prompt, she gave good insight of my indecisiveness with both my meal and dessert choices. She was able to keep up with all those high top tables on a busy Friday. My favorite meal is always the Chicken Madeira and for cheesecake is a toss up between red velvet and Lemon meringue. Please be mindful parking is in the garage with the casino so I recommend trying to get a parking on the 3rd level because the parking lot close to the mall is like a needle in a haystack. The bathrooms was super clean which I always pay attention to in any restaurant. If needing to pick a CF in Maryland I recommend this one."
Sarah C.,"Pasadena, MD",68,18,3,5.0,3/10/2017,Wow! We have been here before and have had good food and good service. But tonight was great! Erin F was our server and even on a Friday night she treated us like we were her only table. She is so sweet and attentive! The food was also very good my husband got the like curry chicken which was a special. I got the truffle honey chicken which was amazing!! We had the key lime mango cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake. Update my husband left his wallet here. We were searching frantically around the movie theater and went back. Richard found it and was completely amazing about finding it. Thank you so much Erin and Richard!
Alexa S.,"Glen Burnie, MD",14,2,,2.0,9/28/2017,"We came on a Sunday night and they said we would be seated in 20 mins and we got seated in a little less than an hour. The hostesses seem disorganized. They sat us in a table that had the previous check sitting there. It took about 20 mins for our waitress to come over. It took forever to get our waters and our food a bread came out at the same time, which was maybe 45 mins. Our waitress took forever to check on us, fill our waters, and to bring us our bill. The worst service I've ever had."
Brandi C.,"Randallstown, MD",50,10,20,4.0,6/24/2017,I love the variety of the cheesecake factory. This location is near my job and I find myself eating here alot. This location is not as large as other locations because it's located inside of a casino. It does have an outside entrance so kids can come in. I had the shrimp scampi and steak Diane platter it was delicious and it was my second time this week eating it!
Richard B.,"El Paso, TX",9,93,118,2.0,7/14/2016,"So this is the second  time my family and I come to this establishment, and just like the first time and all the other cheese cake factory 's that I've been to, the service is extremely slow. For a restaurant that's not busy what so ever, they really are very slow. Now the server, her attitude was great very cheerful and nice. That does not excuse how slow the service was. We entered the restaurant at around 255 pm got seated at around 305 and the server did not come to the table until 315 and then got water until 320. The food came out at 350 when the server took the order around 325 or so.  The food on the other hand was great. No complaints their, and very good portions. I almost wanted to give this review one star due to the service but because of the food i gave them two. To me the experience starts as soon as the customer walks in the door. I can understand slow service when the establishment is busy, but i can honestly say that their was maybe ten tables with customers at the time. I was very tempted to walk out and go across to Bobby Burgers,  but i waited it out since my daughter loves to eat at cheese cake. I can say that i will not return, at least to this restaurant. But heres the pictures of the food. If you want slow and somewhat bad service but good food then go, but i don't think it was worth the bad slow service."
Deidra L.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/26/2017,"Our visit was disappointing, my mom's 70th birthday and none of us were happy. It took one hour to get our dinner, the waiter was apologetic but the manager was only concerned with us knowing the food is on its way. He did not introduce himself or apologize for a bad experience. Bye bye Cheesecake Factory"
Joshua G.,"Roswell, GA",172,4,3,1.0,10/22/2017,"I'd give this location zero stars if I could. Service was horrible, our server checked on us maybe twice, forgot to bring out our food after we waited over an hour. The one appetizer that did make it to our table was made wrong. When the manager, Donna Yu, came we told her what was going on and she never came back and didn't try to change our experience into a positive one and correct the errors. When we finally saw our server again and asked for the check we waited another 10 mins before we got up and left to pay our check up front. To top it off the bathrooms were a mess. Keep in mind, this was a Sunday night and they weren't busy at all. HUGE waist of time!"
Lil Birdie N.,"Severn, MD",10,169,550,3.0,12/8/2016,"Always loves coming here. It's the only place that opens later than most restaurant. Loves their wheat bread , and of course their wide selection of cheesecake. Service is hit or miss here.  Sometimes we waited for 15 mins to be seated because host is nowhere to be found. And server forget to give us utensil at the table. But the food has always been consistent.  Ahi carpaccio- delicious.  Chicken Alfredo -  delicious  Miso salmon - delicious."
Andrea H.,"Marathon, FL",0,8,1,1.0,3/29/2017,"It's the little things that make a difference. The floor near the kitchen/bathroom was like an ice skating rink - I nearly fell on the grease on my way to the bathroom. Once there, there was no toilet paper, except scattered on the floor, and the automatic sinks barely worked. When servers walked past the table, some left behind their body odors - old sweat or cigarette smoke...or both (very unappetizing). I had to ask for a refill of water three times. The food was ok but not anything to brag about.  It was kind of a let down for my birthday meal."
Kara W.,"Millersville, MD",0,1,,5.0,12/12/2017,Awesome lunch flawless service from Zach B! Everything we ate was hot fresh and delicious
Kesha J.,"Silver Spring, MD",69,115,302,3.0,4/20/2017,"We went on a Wed night so we didn't have too wait to be seated. The customer service was ok , but the food wasn't the greatest.  I ordered the Shrimp Alfredo and it was terrible. The noodles were over cooked and the sauce was bland.  I returned it and got the crab dip and bang shrimp which were better. This is my 2nd time having to take my food back at place and 3 strikes your out. They do have a very large menu so I'm sure something tastes good. Stick with the cheesecakes."
Robert W.,"St. Pete Beach, FL",1,3,2,1.0,3/7/2017,The WORST service by our server Allen tonight.  We saw him 5 times during the night. We were here for an hour and a half. Our entree took an hour from the time we ordered and it had been sitting under the heat lamps so long the garnishes were cooked to mush and the food totally inedible. The table to our left had another server...they were seated a half hour after us and they had appetizers and entrees served and eaten before our food arrived. The server didn't alert the manager nor offer to make it right. I told him I wasn't going to pay for my entree but my wife nibbled at hers didn't demand hers be taken off. It was also inedible.  I will not return to this location ever again!   They have ruined Cheesecake Factory for me!!!!!!!!!!!
Joseph S.,"Severn, MD",5,89,248,4.0,1/30/2016,"We like to come here occasionally for a family treat. Cheesecake Factory is usually a fun place to go for dinner. I don't know how they manage to do a pretty decent job of pulling off such a large and varied menu. This location at Arundel Mills has consistently provided a pleasant experience. Every time we have been the service has been good, even when they are very busy on a Saturday evening. The food is usually good. A few times we have had something cold or not quite cooked through. But overall they do a good job. Portions are huge. The restaurant is clean. We keep going back. And Sunday brunch is a must to try!"
Johnny L.,"St. George, NY",165,4,,1.0,1/3/2017,"I started this review with 3 stars it has since moved to 2 after waiting 45 minutes for our check.  Besides the dry pasta, yes the food was good, which was expected for this chain.   However the service was horrible.  After a mid meal switch, a drink refill was forgotten.   It is not busy in here.  Even now as I am currently waiting for my credit card back.  From the time we ordered til the food arrived.  45 plus minutes.   We did get our free bread though so we have that going for us right.  Update.  It only took 14 minutes to get my credit card back so for better or worse I'll be cutting this review short.  It's a shame really.  My wife and I actually wanted to get cheesecake, however we didn't want to wait an extra two hours to get it. Update. Just got sick from my salad.  Down to one star."
Shanea C.,"Manhattan, NY",54,61,137,4.0,7/17/2016,"I went to LIve casino and was pleasantly surprised when I saw there was a Cheesecake Factory next door. I checked my watch and saw that it was after twelve midnight so I was even more happy when I found out they didn't close till 2am  I order the banana foster cheesecake. It was priced at about $8 which is a little more that a Juniors cheesecake slice, however juniors don't have no where as many flavors as the Cheesecake Factory. The banana foster cheesecake was so delicious and moist and it came with nice chunks of bananas on the side.  The staff was friendly and it wasn't any wait."
Ky T.,"Laurel, MD",2320,213,469,2.0,9/16/2015,"Service is consistently hit or miss at the Arundel Mills location. They also have a regular problem of citing waaaaay off wait times at the host stand. Almost every time I've visited during the evening, I witness customer complaints being made to a manager or the hosts about why they were quoted a certain wait time, but then have actually been waiting an eternity to be seated. The thing is... I don't think people really mind waiting an eternity for monster size portions of food with slabs of cheesecake to wash it down. I think we mind having our expectations set for 30 minutes before being seated and then actually waiting an eternity for a table when we could have killed some time in the mall or casino had we been advised more accurately. The bathroom here is always an utter disaster. There are no paper towels ever in sight to dry your hands/ open the door with, as was the case this past Saturday at 7pm. Toilets were unflushed. Toilet paper was strewn across the floor. Soap dispensers were empty. Even chick fil a appears to have a regular schedule for employee bathroom checks but I've never seen a staff member attending to the ladies' room here. The miso Salmon entree is always spot on. There's an abundant selection of cheesecake to choose from which have all worked out great for me over the years, and I love many of their appetizers. The kitchen and menu don't seem to be an issue here but overall management of this location could stand to see some improvement."
Cathy A.,"Temple Hills, MD",0,1,,2.0,11/11/2017,"We arrived with a party of 14, we reserved. Our table was given away witho it explanation. Then we were inform of our 2 hour wait. No reasonable accommodation was made. Out party was split up into multiple parties of 2 and 4 dispersed all over the restaurant. No conveyed concern for our dining experience only that we stay and place a food order. UNFORGIVABLE!"
Bridgette S.,"Tampa, FL",389,95,105,3.0,6/6/2016,"As it was Sunday evening after 7pm and most of the other mall restaurants were closing, we got our pager for the standard Cheesecake Factory wait. But as luck would have it, we were able to snag a high top in the bar area. Yay! It took a long time for a server to come and greet us and overall just seemed to be moving in slow motion the entire evening. Though he was very sweet and kind, there was just no sense of American urgency. If I were in Europe dining, the pace would have been expected. The only issue - we were starving!  We got our bread and butter, which helped to stave off the 4 hungry ladies.  The CF menu is extensive, but I ordered from the Skinny Lite menu and got the chicken enchiladas. They were yummy, but tasted slightly over cooked. The veggie salad that came with it to keep it ""skinny"" was a vinegar laced dish made with cucumbers, carrots. It was yummy. Another friend got the crab bites and stuffed mushrooms and polished those off. The other got the pasta Diablo and said that was her fave. And another got the Thai lettuce wraps which was a beautiful presentation with huge, leafy green lettuce leaves.  All in all, it was a yummy meal, just a bit slow."
