Dean F.,"Laurel, MD",0,16,4,2.0,5/17/2015,"I really looked forward to coming here for the first time. Unfortunately I was mostly disappointed. Wait was 45 mins..I figured it's Saturday night in the casino..of course. So ok. We got seated one thing I didn't like that much was how close other people are to you. Such close proximity you can hear each other even if you whisper. A lot of people don't mind I like privacy at least to some degree. Waiter came and dropped off bread and took drink order promptly.  Started off with a long island ice tea. Friend got a Guinness. Drinks came in a good amount of time.  My drink a was lame, no strength, mostly ice.  Friends was bottled so is what it is. Ordered the chicken sliders asked for the mayo on the side. No tomatoes, pickles on the side. They came out with everything on the side, even the chicken..... Friend got the tex mex eggrolls. They were good. Both took a little too long to come out. I ordered a angry orchard as it's bottles and they can't screw it up. It took so long to come out I almost said take it back I'm not interested anymore. Ordered our entrees in got chicken Alfredo. Wife got shepards pie and friend got steak. Again took quite a long time to come out . Had ordered another beer that took even longer this time. The food was all delicious I must say. I have no complaints there . Ordered cheesecake to go. Atebat home later and it was delicious too. So in summary. The cheesecake factory has great food. It is pricy but you get a lot of a good amount of food so its okay. The service is what gets 2 stars . The waiter Jennifer was awful . She had this attitude on her face like she didn't want to be there. She was slow. I know she was busy butni have been to busier places with 10x faster waiters. So its no excuse. Won't go back this location. May give the Annapolis one a try in the future. We will see."
Toya B.,"Odenton, MD",70,8,1,1.0,9/20/2015,"I've been to this location and never had a problem until last night but it's enough to encourage me to another location.  I was there to celebrate my friend getting married along with the other bridesmaids so it was a special occasion. It didn't take long to get get seated or to get drinks. Food came out quick and hot but  the guacamole that came with my quesadillas wasn't fresh at all and the chicken marsala that someone else ordered had too much oil and barely any gravy. We worked down our meals because we were starving we literally just left our dress fittings. We finally ordered dessert and the to go cheesecake slices were small and on one half was broken off and covered with whip cream to make it look as though a whole slice which is ridiculous considering your paying $8 a slice. But to top off our loving evening when trying to pay for our meals they lost my debit card!  You read right!  Our server lost my debit card. Instead of paying attention to how many people were at the table matching up with our individual bill folds from us paying separately he came back to me twice asking me for my method of payment in which I already gave him along with the rest of the table. All while trying to ring out another table of 3 people before finishing us completely off. He looked himself for almost 30 minutes before I even saw a manager come to our table. Finally the manager came and we explained what happened and the manager helped him look for another 35 minutes just to come back and say ""Sorry we really looked but we still can't find your debit card but we'll comp dinner for the whole table "". EXCUSE ME? ! I appreciate that he at least did that but you still managed to lose my debit card!  I was so furious!  I have to call and cancel my debit in the restaurant because I was blocked in the booth we were eating in because the restaurant is attached to the casino and I didn't want my card being used being they couldn't find it. So now did they not only lose my damn debit card but now I have to figure out another to get to work seeming how I use my debit to add money to my metro card being I work in DC. They need to get better about payment handling considering they're attached to a damn casino!"
Walter B.,"Bel Air, MD",0,79,,2.0,4/5/2016,"Service was fine, but food at this location left something to be desired.  The meat in the dip sandwich was very gristly, and I received very little au jus.  It was also served on a weird sesame seed bun like a hamburger. My wife's salad had very few of the advertised yummy bits.  My mojito was $12.25 and didn't pack a punch worth the price.  We didn't stick around for cheesecake."
Calvin Y.,"Baltimore, MD",24,77,,2.0,3/11/2013,"Since my girlfriend and I had a gift card, and we had just finished shopping at the nearby mall, we thought we would have a bite at the Cheesecake Factory across the mall at the casino. I have eaten at several other Cheesecake Factory locations nearby, and am very familiar with the way these chains are run. While I usually enjoy my visits to Cheesecake Factory, this visit proved to be not only unpleasurable for the both of us, but also seriously made me reconsider the overall quality and standards of this chain altogether. Things were amiss from even before we were seated, as we were given a broken pager.  We were seated in a small table that was accommodating in size, but not in its proximity to the surrounding tables.  While I understand that this is an extremely popular restaurant, I did think it was slightly strange that the tables on either side of us were placed less than a foot away from ours.  I am by no means a claustrophobe, but seating felt pretty cramped and slightly uncomfortable. I'm not exactly sure how servers at Cheesecake Factory work together in terms of sharing tables, but I do recall being helped by three servers total, and regardless of whether taking care of one table is an individual or a collaborative effort between servers, I felt that the overall service left much to be desired, while my girlfriend was positively furious regarding the service that we were given during our visit. Our server seemed to be decently helpful, at least when she was around.  While I did appreciate how she explained to my girlfriend what exactly their polenta fries were like, she was hardly around for the duration of the meal.  It took her roughly ten minutes for her to take our order, which isn't bad, unless you count in the fact that it took an additional ten more minutes for our water to come, which we had ordered ten minutes before our order was taken, making it a grand total of sitting twenty minutes at the restaurant with nothing to eat nor to drink.  We had to flag down another server for straws and lemons for our water, of which only the straws were given to us.  The lemons never came. Our order consisted of one order of the skinny turkey and avocado sandwich with fries substituted for the salad, and an order of the chicken and shrimp jambalaya, which took 40 minutes to come out after we completed our order.  I understand that this sometimes can happen at restaurants, but  there were at least two free tables in our seating zone alone and the restaurant did not appear to be busy. We were neither offered an apology nor an explanation as to why our food had been so slow to come out.  In the meantime, we had ordered a second serving of bread to stave off our hunger, which is usually very soft and tastes very good. This time, though, the bread was not only cold, but hard. By the time our food had come, we had almost  satisfied our appetites from the bread alone.  This was roughly fifty minutes, almost an entire hour, since we were initially seated. The food was hot, which I was grateful for, but when my girlfriend immediately noticed that she needed ketchup for her fries and voiced her request for ketchup, the server was nowhere to be found. This usually wouldn't be a problem, but the fries were neither seasoned and actually tasted inferior in quality to fries that are available at fast food places. The quality of the food was a little less than what I have come to expect from this restaurant chain; the chicken and shrimp tasted bland, as if they were plainly cooked and the jambalaya sauce was tossed on top of it when finished as an afterthought, and several times I bit into the jambalaya and felt and heard a crunch, and really couldn't figure out what on my plate should be making such a sound when biting into it. It felt a lot like undercooked rice. By the end of our meal, my girlfriend was so put off by the restaurant that she opted to skip out on cheesecake for dessert, a decision that is quite unusual given that she had specifically ordered from the skinny menu so that she COULD have a cheesecake for dessert.  When we asked for the check initially, our server was unable to produce it, and said she would go and find it for us. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with the way our visit ended up, as it came up way below what I came to expect.  I'm usually not a hard person to please, and typically if any one or two of these things were to happen on separate occasions, I wouldn't have really cared too much.  However, since they all seemed to happen in combination at once, it seemed that what could have been a simple mistake or mishap appeared to be more like a series of unfortunate points which resulted in sub-par service.  Even though there was still a balance on our gift card, she seemed to be quite adamant about never returning to eat at the restaurant again.  I'm not sure if I could personally recommend this Cheesecake Factory if most customers end up having this sort of experience."
Christal W.,"Lanham, MD",1,52,4,4.0,2/19/2015,"I have been here about ten or so times and have never been disappointed.  My favorite appetizer is the Tex Mex rolls and sometimes I will come here for dinner just because I want those.  I've tried the artichokes and they are delicious as well.  For main entrees I've gotten salmon and chicken dishes for the most part and it's always been fresh and delicious.  The dark ambiance is a treat most times, sometimes it'd be nice to have a little extra lighting.  The drinks are fine as well; especially the cocktails; they are never watered down.  The cheesecake in and of itself is a special treat.  It isn't as good as Juniors, but for this area; it's some of the best.  I also like the carrot cake.  The staff has always been engaging and helpful.  Not a bad word to say about the place."
Wendy Q.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,2.0,2/27/2016,"Been to many cheesecake factories over the yrs  sorry to say this particular location did not make the cut. It's a good thing we weren't secret shoppers. One pet peeve I have is I like my food served HOT. It was warm at best while the buffalo blast was waaaayyyy salty. left me parched and not impressed. The plates were hot but we weren't eating the plates. Caesar salad was very good no complaints with that. Had our server Albert  come back to ask how our food was I would have immediately commented but did not ask until he presented the check. While the food portions are usually humongous the drinks were scaled down. Not worth the wait or the price. another issue, when our buzzer alarmed hostess still left us waiting to be seated and good 6-8 additional minutes."
Shawn C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",2,4,1,5.0,3/10/2015,Labor Day and we got sat in 10 mins. Curious well attentive server and drinks that hit the mark. I don't like avocados but their avocado egg roll were awesome! Just goes to prove that if you fry anything its delicious!
John V.,"Lansdowne - Baltimore Highlands, MD",0,4,1,1.0,2/21/2016,This place is horrible the service is horrible and the wings are overcooked and the manager is absolute trash never come here please don't waste your money on this establishment!!!
Chris B.,"Towson, MD",0,17,9,5.0,5/24/2015,"Delicious !!! Perfect evening, service was right on and the food was hot & fresh they have something for every one . Make sure you save room for dessert they really live up to there name!"
Ingrid W.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,89,5,2.0,11/9/2014,The most unprofessional Cheesecake Factory I've ever dined in. The staff was at the counter laughing and talking loudly. They were Huddled instead of working. The quality of the food horrible. My Tex Mex egg rolls we greasy as well as my calamari. I will not be back to this location.
Jennifer Y.,"Ellicott City, MD",6,24,155,4.0,1/9/2015,Cheesecakes are rich and delicious.  Did the slices get thinner over time? For the price I expected a thicker slice.  Love the variety of food in their extensive menu.  They make the best mojitos.
Ken Y.,"Baltimore, MD",22,108,6,3.0,10/3/2013,"The C Factory is usually an overall good experience, so I'm not exactly sure what the deal was this time with the kitchen staff. My friend and I met up here one weekend night before checking out a movie.  We ordered a couple of salads with sandwiches to keep it quick. The farro salad and eggplant sandwich were good.  The kale salad was anything but a kale salad with romaine lettuce and some other stuff.  A veggie burger also came out with no top bun. (No mention of open-face on the menu...) The waiter joked it off and said that he would have the kitchen correct the issue.  About 10 minutes later, he brought out a small plate of wilted kale and a bun top - the size of a slider roll.  Yeah, there were a few laughs about the whole issue, and sure, it was a busy weekend at a casino, but come on now... Our fault for not bringing it to a manager's attention."
Nancy M.,"Bel Air, MD",9,59,16,1.0,1/6/2016,"i have always enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory for its food..somewhat predictable, but always very well prepared and tasty.  My daughter went to this location last night at about 530.  It wasn't busy yet and I gave our name to the hostess.  we were told we would be seated in just a few moments.  I had left something in my car and went to get it..in the parking garage, up elevator, walk to car, from car, back to elevator and to restaurant and still waited another 10 minutes to be seated.  Not sure why, it wasn't crowded.  They always give you a lot of food, so my daughter got the orange chicken (always a favorite) intending to share with me, and i got the Crab Ball Appetizer.  The problem was with the Orange Chicken.  Since it was huge, we shared and I thought there was just something odd about the chicken.  Were starved so ate most anyway (plus my daughter would not let me say anything).  The chicken was ""mushy"".  i mean if you cut one in half you could mush it apart with a fork or your fingers.  It was almost like a puree formed into chicken chunks.  My guess is it was over tenderized.  At least I hope it was over tenderized because the only other thing that makes chicken meat do that is a lot of bacteria.   The service was not good enough to offset the food.  I won't be back to this location.  blech."
Dave O.,"Alexandria, VA",14,1,,2.0,9/24/2014,"First bite I took had a big plastic shard in it. The manager said it must have come from the container it was stored in. Usually they'd comp you the entree or at least a free drink or piece of cheesecake, but nothing. Replaced the entree and kept it on the bill."
Lhoi R.,"Glen Burnie, MD",2,27,66,3.0,1/29/2015,"The ambience is great but seating space/ table  is too tight & small. When we requested to be transferred the receptionist said we have to get up at the front desk and wait for another 5 mins when there are to many tables available! So we just suck up the tiny space. The food server did not check on us while we are waiting for our order which took forever to be served. Chicken Marsala didn't have much taste - the pasta bow was not salted. Fried calamari have way too much breading and salt while the Thai lettuce wrap was the best thing served so far- chicken satay strips has good taste, a bit dry though and the whole presentation is grand but it has too much garnish than the actual food itself- it occupied the huge plate & our table. I'm just so hungry and just ate the Thai wraps and get out... I didn't have this experience previously but maybe just the wrong server, receptionist, & cook today."
Debra M.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,3,,3.0,2/13/2016,"Visited on February 12.  My friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich that consisted of bacon and gobs of fat--no pulled pork.  Server said the sandwich was pulled pork, bacon and pork bellies-What! Called over the manager who said the same thing.  When my friend showed her the sandwich had bacon and no pulled pork she said the sandwich probably had been made incorrectly.  What is this-a version of Hell's Kitchen?  He re-ordered a turkey burger (which was his original choice!) which he was charged for--he did receive a fresh order of sweet potato fries at no charge.  Ladies room was dirty; gentleman seated next to us complained about waiting over 15 minutes to receive his check.  We were told earlier the pulled pork would not be on the menu much longer--good!  My cheesesteak and salad were good; salad only had one small slice tomato.  Generous portions, still!"
Javier S.,"Ontario, CA",10,7,2,3.0,10/12/2013,"Food is amazing and its given in the appropriate portions. This is NOT the place for an intimate date, or any type of date for that matter. The environment is just too noisy. Service was amazing when our waitress wasn't attending the three other tables. Location isn't the best, if you didn't know that the casino had restaurants in it then you might never find it. Overall, great food, great service, not enough waiters per tables, and noisy."
Giselle W.,"Atlanta, GA",317,159,110,1.0,7/12/2014,"Here only because of the casino, glad they were open latr but was very mediocre because of the service! Definitely not better than any other cheesecake factory ive been into"
M C.,"Clinton, MD",0,3,,2.0,8/9/2012,"I don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory very often, given that I live deep down in the wastelands of southern PG County, and the price of gasoline is comparable to the cost of a down payment on a small townhouse. Yet I have always had good, if not stellar experiences at each of the locations that I've been to. Until now. I did not deduct any points for the wait. It was a Saturday night, and this location is inside of the new Maryland Live Casino. I actually found an hour wait for two people to be pretty reasonable, given the circumstances. The ambiance and decor is the same as every other Cheesecake Factory, although a bit smaller. The waitress was very attentive and polite, which was great. The same could not be said for one of her colleagues, who while turning to service the table next to ours bent over and put his ass directly in my face. It was so close I had half a mind to bite it, but I imagine my date might've had a problem with that. Interesting view aside, my only complaint with this particular Cheesecake Factory is the only thing that a restaurant should be concerned about. The food was, for lack of a better word, gross.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon, given that salmon is one of those things that is fairly difficult to really screw up. ""That's what you think, lady,"" said the chef, as he proceeded to really screw up my salmon. Basically, it was blander than a Lifetime Original Movie. The asparagus was built Ford tough, which while desirable in pickup trucks is not so desirable in vegetables. And the potatoes were just glad to be there. They were neither part of the problem, nor part of the solution.  I don't remember what my date ordered, but I believe it was some sort of chicken mushroom pasta thing, that vaguely resembled a small sea monster. He was not overly impressed with the taste. Needless to say, neither of us finished our meals. He threw his out, and I took mine home and cooked it the right way.  I'm willing to chalk this little mishap up to growing pains, as this location is still fairly new. Hopefully the chefs will get better, if not I'll have to start carrying around some sort of seasoning utility belt like the world's lamest Catwoman impersonator."
Tiffani N.,"Wheaton-Glenmont, MD",404,210,224,4.0,6/26/2012,"Had a chance to enjoy this beautiful outpost known for its ginormous plates of fattening, yet delicious, decadent food and desserts BEFORE they opened last Wednesday to the general public. Seems incongruous to open The Cheesecake Factory in a casino, right? The national chain of popular resties is known for it's family-style environment, in which many celebrate birthdays, anniversies and the like. Well, they could probably put a CF anywhere and people will flock to it like bees to honey. It's on the outside of the Maryland Live! Casino so families with youngins' not fit for the slots can come and go as they please.  It's a smaller member in the group of area CF's, yet it's elegant and the decor is more upscale than the others. I can't wait to come back for happy hour or on a romantic date in the evening. From what I hear the lighting is lovely, ladies! As far as the fare, you know the drill. The menu selection is massive and the portions are even bigger. You can basically find ANYTHING to eat here. But, beware, don't overdo it or you won't have space (without a trip to the bathroom) to sample their namesake specialty cheesecakes. I had the latest limited edition Hershey's one and I savored it for 3 days because it was THAT good. Drinks are also served in huge glasses and fail to disappoint, if not a little on the overly sweet side. I tried a Pinaepple Mojito and it was fantastic, which is interesting since I usually avoid them because I can't get with sweet and minty. That cocktail was a welcome exception."
