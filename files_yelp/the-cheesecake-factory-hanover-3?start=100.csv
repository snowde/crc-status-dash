Justin R.,"Hyattsville, MD",2,8,,2.0,11/5/2016,"As others have posted, the food is always great. The service; however, is almost always poor. I'm not sure how this continues but maybe because of the casino being right next to it, service can be poor because the audience will always be here.  I've been here 20+ times because I enjoy the mall, casino, and food and virtually every time the service has been weak. This time it took nearly 60 minutes to get our order. The waiter did not visit us for over 45 minutes of the wait as we sat with empty drinks. After the food finally came out (not by our server), we were never checked on. I've noticed Cheesecake Factory has commented on this before but nothing is changing. Please do better, Cheesecake Factory."
Jackie G.,"Silver Spring, MD",35,28,55,2.0,9/7/2016,My experience that this locate was the worst! We waited for an hour for our and it was cold. The manager on shift informed us that our food wasn't sitting out for long since she was the one who brought it out to the bartender. I told her that will eat the food since we waited an hour for it. The restaurant had a funky smell to it as well.
Nicoleen R.,"Washington, DC",188,160,649,3.0,2/16/2015,Only had the pecan cake it was awesome. The bar a bit too small. The place and staff are nice. Our bartender Jason was great and interactive (congrats on the baby) certainly will be back.
Kisha G.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,8,,5.0,12/11/2016,Food was great! Considering the location expect a wait.  My only complaint was the waiting area is too small but my first time there i was very pleased.
Sharon C.,"Gambrills, MD",127,461,1653,4.0,5/9/2015,"Came here with co-workers to celebrate a promotion & birthday. Even though it was a Friday afternoon it wasn't terribly crowded, it was an enjoyable amount of space where you could still move around and not feel stacked on top of one another.  The host for our tables was even-keeled and was very attentive when we needed anything. I apologize that I can't remember his name but he earned a respectable tip for his service. I chose the calamari for my lunch and it was piping hot when it came to the table. I enjoyed the marinara sauce but the white dipping sauce...not so much. Cooked just right and not chewy the amount for the appetizer was enough to share. For my dessert to go I went with the chocolate turtle cheesecake. At first glance; I was like dang, these slices are getting smaller with each visit. It actually turned out to be more than enough and I actually shared some with my favorite carnivore. The menu at Cheesecake Factory is so vast that you'll need a good 15 minutes to decide what you'd like. I actually make it a point to try to order a different item each visit so I can experience the menu more. Good dining experience and I'll return in hopes of experiencing their brunch items."
Christine A.,"Monterey, CA",162,422,464,5.0,3/15/2015,"Absolutely the best service and food we've had at any Cheesecake Factory, ever! We arrived 45 before closing, but the entire dining experience felt like they really didn't even know/care what time it was.  We ordered Pineapple Moscow Mules for drinks and the calamari appetizer. The cocktails were refreshing and beautifully garnished. The calamari was perfectly tender and seasoned.  For dinner, we had a duo of ribeyes. His came with a velvety macaroni and cheese side and mine came with the normal fresh fries. There is an up-charge for changing sides, but no big deal. Lastly, for dessert, my husband had the pineapple upside-down cheese cake and I had the dulce de leche cheese cake, both to-go. His cheesecake was a little over-sweet, but my cheesecake was ah-ma-zing!  Will definitely come back again...and knowing what I know now, I will plan to come on their non-peak hours. I can only imagine the madness during the dinner rush."
Latrice R.,"Richmond, VA",17,130,380,5.0,2/20/2016,They had the best service here. The host was awesome and personable. The waitress delivered our food in a timely manner. The food was fresh and great as expected!
Chanhong L.,"Charlottesville, VA",57,196,15,5.0,2/17/2016,"Note: this review is for The Cheesecake Factory's veggie burger only. Although I will note that this particular Cheesecake Factory was super busy last Saturday night for some reason unbeknownst to me: the wait for a table was up to 6 hours! Needless to say, we got carryout. Anyways, as a vegan, I was super excited (and surprised) to find the veggie burger on the menu, one of the only vegetarian items on the menu not labeled as a salad. I got it without the cheese and mayo, and it was still super tasty thanks in large part to the toasted bun. Apparently, The Cheesecake Factory is known for their bread i.e. I also tried some of their side bread, and it was delicious. The burger also came with a side of fries, which is always a big plus for any fry-lover. All in all, this is something everyone could and should order, not just vegans or vegetarians!"
Christina G.,"Beverly Hills, MI",83,249,1096,5.0,3/26/2015,Good typical Cheesecake Factory food.   Everyone had a good meal. Good beer selection. Fast service.  Friendly.  We had a really nice dinner.
Peter L.,"Germantown, MD",1,44,3,1.0,8/6/2016,"Great food and atmosphere, but kind of creeped out and disgusted by that nasty paper napkin sitting up in my face. I was waiting for the server to notice, even though it would be in their eye level and she never did. Sure, I could've told her but, if her and everyone else who works there can't keep the restaurant clean, why should a patron have to tell you how to clean your own restaurant. Don't think we'll be going back to this Cheesecake Factory. NASTY !!!!"
T P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,12,,2.0,3/19/2017,"I can remember a time when the Cheesecake Factory was the place to go! I'm not sure how this chain had diminished over the years but my recent visit to this location put things into perspective for me..first let's start off with the table...the seats were filthy! And then the server came over and she smelled like cigarettes..I ordered the chicken and waffles which was mediocre at best...I saw a couple next to me return an order of French toast after flipping it over and discovering that the bottom was completely burnt...maybe if the cooks, waiters and management just paid a little attention...this place wouldn't be so bad!"
Shaakirah D.,"San Diego, CA",116,60,11,1.0,6/19/2016,"I feel like the running excuse here is, ""I'm new here"" or ""she's a little new"". I don't know if the job sucks so bad that they filter people in and out THAT FREQUENTLY or if they use it as an excuse for constant poor service. I've eaten at this location many time, but this is my first time for brunch. The service is ALWAYS mediocre.  Drinks take forever, the waitresses tend to not know the menu, and in this particular instance, she took our orders and never came back. Someone else brought our appetizers (before we got our drinks ) when I mentioned to that person that the appetizers beat the drinks, she went and got our drinks (I'm sure she worked in the kitchen ). Our food then came out by the same person. Meanwhile I'm wondering, can I tip HER instead?!?  Then our waitress finally brings us bread and disappeared again, never asked how our appetizer or food was. Once we were done with our food pretty much, she asks us do we need another drink, comes back and asks if we ever got oir appetizer. Seriously?!?  The fried zucchini was pretty good ,the chicken and waffles is like a baby portion of waffles, so my husband ended up ordering a second meal and we had to ask for condiments, including syrup. I don't eat pork so I didn't have many options for breakfast meat either because everything came with Bacon or ham. I'd rather eat ihop for breakfast. Smh."
Eric L.,"Elkridge, MD",9,240,5,2.0,2/25/2015,"I can sum this up in a few words...lack of attention to detail. We arrived and the hostess told us the wait was 20 minutes for a party of 4. It took 40 minutes (give or take a minute) for us to be seated. Our waiter was attentive and took our drink and appetizer order promptly. We ordered the factory nachos. They came out about 15 minutes later, however they nacho chips were quite greasy with quite a bit of oil built up at the bottom of the plate.  Our meals eventually arrived and that's when the experience continued to go downhill. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my wife the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with white rice. My pasta had virtually no sauce and was simply hot pepper on pasta (maybe its supposed to be this way, it looked like the picture on their website - I ate a few bites and decided to take the rest home where I could doctor it up with more sauce.) The server did not offer any grated cheese. My wife's dish came out with brown rice. My son's pasta didn't come out until about 5 minutes after ours. When our waiter came over about 5 minutes after that, my wife asked for brown rice. He asked if I wanted grated cheese and I said yes please. He was shocked the server didn't offer it. He then took my wife's dish back and it came out 'replated' (their term) a few minutes later and by then her food was luke warm.  It was a busy night, but if you spend $70 and up to take out a family of four, you shouldn't be walking out of the place complaining about the experience."
R.o.f.l M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,11,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Sat here with 2 family members, no one ever same to server is for at least 30 mins till we asked, wouldn't recommend"
C M.,"Bethesda, MD",563,63,242,4.0,10/19/2015,"My wife and I found the outlet mall while heading home Friday evening, needless to say after several hours of shopping we had to eat something so cheesecake factory caught our attention.  The wait was 20 min even though it was a busy Friday night. We had an awesome server (ask for Mike). And the dinner was good I had 5 cheese pasta and my wife had some healthy salad. We ended the meal with salted caramel cheesecake which was delicious to say the least.  Overall one of the better Cheesecake Factory experiences I've had in a while."
Harold B.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,141,15,2.0,2/12/2017,"Had a lunch here but it was disappointing. We had soup and salad combo and pasta carbonara. Soup of the day was loaded baked potato soup, the presentation was nice but it didn't have a whole lot flavor and it tasted watery. The salad was literally two tomato slices with greens straight out of the bag, not very impressive. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was good. Pasta was greasy and not very good. Green tea was regular ice tea with mint essence, it wasn't even green as usual. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen that day but there sure weren't any standards used on cooking. In the future may have to only do a cheesecake pick up and eat somewhere else."
Jae M.,"Washington, DC",51,207,51,3.0,12/3/2015,"Typical Cheesecake factory. It is attached to the Maryland Live casino. It does have an entrance that is not attached to the casino so that those under 18 can dine. I went on a Saturday night around 730p with one other person. We were told that it would be approximately a 15-20 min wait. After about 25 min, we were told that it would be another 15 min. At that point, I was annoyed. One of my pet peeves of restaurants is when they can't give adequate quotes for wait times. I think they often (Cheesecake in particular) will tell you less time and then add on because they know that you are already committed and will likely just continue to wait. I can understand if we were a larger party, but it seems silly if you can't adequately estimate turnover for a 2 top table.  Overall, food and service was good. Food wait time was probably about 20-25 min total for appetizers and entrees. Probably wouldn't return again if there is a wait."
Amir P.,"Hyattsville, MD",5,18,,1.0,5/22/2016,"This happened yesterday: arrived with a 5-month pregnant woman and her sister. My glass of water had a chip in it which cut my lip. I told the manager that I cut myself but not to make a big deal about it because I didn't want to upset the pregnant woman. He ran over and made a big deal about it which upset her. Then they screwed up my order (Cobb salad) and, in the end, I just ended up hungry with a cut lip and an upset pregnant lady. Wait staff was very nice and the place was packed as usual but, after this experience,  I'd recommend staying away from this spot :("
Pepper H.,"Little Rock, AR",0,42,4,3.0,3/12/2017,Went there on a Saturday night and it was a long wait of 45 minutes.  Then after the buzzer rang we waited another 10 just to get seated. So we basically waited in line to get into another line.  Our server was very good and personable.  The quality of the food was good to however the kitchen was slow to get it out.  In all this place is like controlled chaos and not sure it was worth the time waiting.
Tee C.,"Washington, DC",0,22,11,3.0,7/24/2016,So the server spilled a drink all over my left side and I was offered no discount.  The server even asked the white couple everything before us.  #BlackLivesMatter
