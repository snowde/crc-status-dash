Chastity W.,"Glenarden, MD",31,38,18,2.0,8/21/2015,"I normally wouldn't review a chain restaurant, but I decided to make an exception. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants to dine at and I'd say I eat at Cheesecake Factory at least twice a month. With that said, I consider myself to be well-versed in all things Cheesecake Factory. This location in particular leaves much to be desired each time I dine here. Each time it's either the food, the drinks, or both that fail to live up to the standards set forth by other (better) Cheesecake Factories. For instance today I came in for an appetizer and cocktail before doing some shopping. I sat at the bar because I didn't feel like waiting for a table when it was just me. I ordered the Tex Mex egg rolls and White Sangria. Both being some of my favorites. First, my drink came and I thought it was interesting that the bartender poured it from pitcher of pre-made sangria and used a spoon to scoop out some of the fruit from the same pitcher and place that in my glass for what in assuming was supposed to be 'garnish'. Not impressed. The drink was more like a thick, syrupy juice and when the egg rolls came out, they weren't any better. The egg rolls were a bit greasy, filled with what seemed like chicken and onions only. I didn't taste any of the corn, black beans, or any of the other stuff that's normally in there. The avocado ranch dipping sauce was very watery and tasteless.  The service here was ok. This is pretty typical for this CF. I'm not hard to please but it always bothers me when wait staff and bartenders lack personality. I won't say that I won't be back here because the reason I come back is because it's convenient, but I do hope this review and the others reach it to someone in management who could possibly work on this."
Carolyn C.,"Baltimore, MD",342,293,974,5.0,6/22/2015,"There is usually so much hatred towards a chain restaurant; however, The Cheesecake factory is a chain restaurant that I adore. The only way you can go wrong here is if you don't order more than one dish. The menu is extensive and can be over whelming but when it comes to food, overwhelming is great.  I like this location because I can run in and out super-fast, get my shopping on either before or after, never have to fight for parking because the casino parking is always open and I leave happy and full knowing that I made healthy decision eating here rather than in the food court (ew). Side note for the drinks...they can be SO expensive but they are SO GOOD. Blueberry mojitos are the best. They make me so happy I can cry. *Ask for Tiffany if you want a wonderful little burst of energy as a server, she's adorable and happens to be a great friend of mine. The only downside to this location is that they do not do happy hour! If you want happy hour at Cheesecake Factory then you have to visit the Columbia Location."
Kristie L.,"Columbia, MD",176,118,472,2.0,4/25/2016,"We've been eating at cheesecake factory's for years now. The only reason we still go is for the vast variety of choices and the fact that they are pretty consistent. For some reason, this location is consistently on the lower spectrum of cheesecakes. Food is either really under or over seasoned. The service isn't bad."
Brittany S.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",24,18,15,1.0,3/20/2016,Today we stood in line for 40 minutes to order a piece of cheesecake and then waited another 20 minutes to get the cheesecake. No need speaking to a manager because he told us that this is proper protocol. This is the worst trip to the Cheesecake Factory ever.
Ayana P.,"Silver Spring, MD",26,61,23,3.0,3/14/2016,"Full disclosure, but I've never been a fan of the food at The Cheesecake Factory, just the dessert. I went yesterday with a friend, we were promptly seated, meals served piping hot and the service was great. My only gripe is that I am just not a fan of the food. If you are a fan, than I highly recommend going to this location."
Monique P.,"Riviera Beach, MD",81,100,27,4.0,6/29/2014,"I want here last night around 9pm and it was a 20 minute wait, which is usual. I ordered the fish tacos and split an appetizer of wings. The food was average. The fish tacos were kind of bland so I was a little disappointed.  Our waitress was great. She was very attentive and catered to our needs.  Overall a decent experience and I am still on the hunt for great fish tacos."
Edgar R.,"Marina, CA",0,20,2,1.0,6/25/2016,"Stay away!  Waited 1 hour to finally get my Diet Coke, no sign of bread or anything else for another 25 minutes.  Wait staff is totally dysfunctional.  Food is just okay and overpriced.  The worst thing though is the service: abysmal!"
Elaine H.,"Arnold, MD",46,88,11,5.0,6/6/2016,The service is great and the food is so good. I love Vietnamese egg rolls. So good. And the cheesecake is so yummy. Its a huge slice so if you can you should share. The kaluha cheesecake is great For The coffee lovers. My favorite.
Kevin M.,"Baltimore, MD",163,288,68,3.0,6/18/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory it is always my ""go to"" restaurant. I recently learned about the happy hour, which is amazing. An entire delegate menu is given with many choices from drinks to appetizers for only 5.50 each!  I've so far enjoyed all the drinks offered. The jw's pink lemonade is my favorite not to sweet or overly loaded with alcohol. It's delicious and gets the job done. But all the drinks are good the margarita is refreshing and the Long Island is on point.  My boyfriend ordered the factory nachos and buffalo blasts. Even though they are very generic bar food they were very good for 5.50 each.., Finally the cheesecake is amazing I mean you can't go wrong with any of the selections. I had the Reese's peanut butter cup cake cheesecake. It's huge and was absolutely delicious for this peanut butter lover. The service is a different story.... Normally I sit at the bar and have the same bartender a very nice light skinned overly energetic woman. Absolutely love her! Now no joke, every other time I have a different server or bartender it leaves me wanting more... You can tell a lot of the staff does not follow the cheesecake dining experience that they are taught during training. The servers tend to be over whelmed and running around. I do think the management needs some tweaking to make service better. I remember when they first opened and for the first few years they were definitely on point. I hope they can get back to that perfect 5 level!  I will always return"
Courtney L.,"Burtonsville, MD",95,4,3,2.0,6/16/2016,Food was subpar. No happy hour. Bartenders not very attentive. Bread was hard a a brick. Go to the one at Columbia Mall.
Lisa H.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,6,,1.0,6/21/2016,Just walked in the bar and walked right back out.   Only a few customers in there but No where to sit because of dirty glasses everywhere dirty bar and tables. No one to bus the tables. What a mess. Won't go back there again.
Alexis T.,"Pasadena, MD",14,11,20,4.0,7/2/2015,"This is my go to restaurant. We always ask for just the brown bread, it is so good! I tried something new and got the garlic noodles with chicken. The chicken was way too overcooked and very dry. It was just ok, I wouldn't get it again. I always get the smores cheesecake for dessert. It's sweet but it is sooooo good. You have to at least try it if you haven't before. This location is convenient because we just go into the casino while we wait for a table. I've only been here once without having a wait so expect to have one."
Alyssa D.,"Providence, RI",16,140,30,5.0,2/21/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is good. It's been around for a while and there are a lot of them. I like it!  I've been a bunch of times over the years. But today, we lucked out with the best service ever!  Erin went above and beyond our expectations. The food tastes better when your treated well!  My entire day was better because I had a good meal and a great experience. So thanks again Erin!  Keep shining!"
Steven P.,"Yorktown, VA",0,3,,2.0,12/17/2016,"Food was good, but my wife forgot a TJMAXX bag on the table with some Christmas gifts and when we returned about 6 minutes later nobody saw anything. Funny since It was a booth in near the casino window in the back corner so the only people that would have seen the bag at the table were the server and busboy. Unless people just randomly walk by tables and take things left behind. But apparently they have 5 managers per shift (none of which could be found) so nobody could tell my wife anything so we left. Merry Christmas. Yeah and the bathrooms were gross with toilet paper all over the floor. But again the food was good."
Rebeca F.,"Pikesville, MD",50,193,1,4.0,5/26/2015,"Extensive menu. So much food you can share a dish, which helps make up for the high prices. Go on off hours to avoid a long wait!"
Bryan N.,"Arcadia, CA",245,419,94,3.0,5/22/2015,"I come here quiet often. The food selection is definitely overwhelming and delicious. I highly recommend the the steak maidaira and shrimp scampi and the chicken Cobb salad. And of course, the cheesecake is the best!  Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the wait could be long at times due to it being attached to a casino and the service could be horrendous at times. I've been here numerous times where the service is just at an all time low. Other than that, I think it is pretty good."
Shamelle W.,"Washington, DC",51,48,12,4.0,4/26/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants of all times. I have been so many times, I can't count. I love the Louisiana chicken, but every now and then I try something different. I got the orange chicken last time it was just okay. I always get the strawberry lemonade and the red velvet cheesecake is the best. This place can get a little crowded considering where it is, but still really nice overall."
Carlo C.,"Rockville, MD",0,23,,2.0,3/30/2015,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory but the location at the Casino is not typically up to the standards of the others I normally go to. The waitstaff can be very hit of miss, some are excellent others shouldn't be employed there. I've never had issues with the food at any other location but this one at Arundel Mills really needs to re-evaluate who's working in the kitchen. Some days they do just fine, others it's pretty bad. Things like under-cooked meat (chicken), not following what is on the order ticket, putting out poor quality food, missing items, etc.  I'd like to see this location up their standards to those of the other locations."
Sade P.,"Columbia, MD",84,106,136,2.0,1/7/2016,"I usually love the Cheescake factory but not today, 1st we waited 30mins for a seat but thats really not that bad considering we could gamble a little. But by time our buzzer called toneat we still waited another 10mins to be seated, that was crazy. So at the table the waitress was very nice but we could tell she was in a rush. We ordered and it didn't take long for the food to come out, but not all of it didnt come. By time my Aunt said something everyone els was ready to go because our waitress was m.i.a. So when she found out she voided it off our bill and we ordered cheescake to go, by time we got home and opened the boxes they were the wrong cheesecakes. So needless to say I dont think I will be eating at this cheesecake factory again. I just dont like the rushed feeling and all the errors, especially because they're so expensive!"
S J.,"Pasadena, MD",0,20,9,1.0,5/18/2017,"Giving 1 star because 0 is not an option.  First off I could not understand the hostess and had to have her repeat herself a couple of times. Next the server also mumbled and then told my husband they had no Sam Adams on tap. When he walks away my husband can see the Sam Adams tap right there at the bar, and confirms with the bar tender thy have Sam Adams. Then order our food (server again mumbling and had to repeat). Server comes back and says ""oh we don't have that"". Manager comes back and says we have that but not one of the sides. We talk it out and asparagus would be subbed. Food comes, no cheese on my husbands cheeseburger and no asparagus. Track down the server who eventually brings a cup of shredded cheese and says that is all they have, still no asparagus and then disappears. Finally track him down and I ask for a manager who comes over and gave lip service. Another 10 minutes the asparagus shows up when we are done eating. Got the check and was never asked if we wanted dessert.  Will not be going back."
