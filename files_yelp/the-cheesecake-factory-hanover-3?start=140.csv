Katie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,16,,3.0,4/18/2016,I never want to wait for a table so I just eat at the bar. Never had to wait there. The food is decent and the cheesecake is amazing. I've always felt things were a little over priced though. You do get huge portions which means I always order my cheesecake to go.
Gorgan G.,"Carmel, IN",1,58,5,1.0,5/7/2016,"Super stale, impossible to eat bread was a bad start. We only saw our waitress for ordering and the check. The fish tacos were nothing special but the rice that came with it was a major fail boat. It was white rice with pesto (I think??) Mixed in it. The beans were awful and my wife's 20 dollar chicken Alfredo had 7 small pieces of chicken. Bad service and bad food, we decided not to risk the cheesecake."
Abi O.,"Baltimore, MD",0,17,25,3.0,8/30/2015,"Service was good. We always order the chicken piccata and chicken costoletta, and they made them perfectly. My only concern is that some of the utensils were not washed properly. The place also had a mild foul odor, like a wet rag that didn't dry properly."
Matt P.,"Laurel, MD",0,6,,3.0,11/4/2016,"They've been around long enough you know what your getting.  My only criticism is it's loud and dark. Trying have dinner not be in a night club.  The wife had to use the light on her phone to see the menu. So good food, sub standard atmosphere."
Alison M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",223,1102,3407,3.0,11/17/2013,"This location is insane.  The crowds, the wait, etc.  They quoted 50 minutes and the wait for two people at 10pm on a Saturday night ended up being around 37 minutes so it wasn't terrible. The server was very nice and good - he was fast and friendly.   Food came out quickly for how busy they were constantly so props to the kitchen for their efficiency.  I eat at CF ALL the time in Virginia Beach, it's my favorite restaurant, so I'm really familiar with the food and menu but since it was so late I ordered from the skinnylicious menu and finally tried the mexican tortilla salad that I've been eyeballing for a while which is under 590 calories, it was really good.  I really liked it.  I'll probably get it again and again.  It had tomatoes, black beans, corn, chicken, and some vinaigrette dressing topped with a little avocado dressing and a warm toasted tortilla underneath.   Got the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake (my fav) and it was delicious as well.  Nom noms.  Only complaint is that everything here is crazy busy on weekends and that it was REALLY loud inside.... like almost miserably so."
Renee B.,"Baltimore, MD",78,567,653,3.0,3/3/2015,"This was my first time at this location. It was late night on a Friday. I was shock that the wait was only ten minutes. While I was in the bathroom (that was not too clean) we were called for our table. Table of two. I ordered a shirley temple. It was ok. I also ordered a buffalo blast which I though was shrimp but it was chicken. It was just ok. I also had shrimp as an appetizer. I was using a gift card that I received for my birthday so that pretty much took care of the bill. I just had to tip. The server was ok but, not all that great. Not sure if this would be my place of choice to dine in the future."
Danny M.,"Hanover, MD",0,16,,1.0,8/7/2015,I hate to submit a poor review but I can't lie to you. Been to this particular establishment about 5 times & only once did I have a better than decent experience.  The servers are hit or miss way too often. The managers are out of site & hardly appear when requested. The food comes out as expected but the wait is entirely too long in my opinion no matter how busy or not busy the Resturant is.  Beware! Do not order from this particular location if they are closing within 75 minutes!! You will have a horrible experience just as I have had.  Safe to say I won't be dining at this particular establishment again.
Jason L.,"Highland, MD",5,86,1,3.0,3/23/2015,"Fantastic service. The food was pretty good, but very salty. One of the most difficult parts is deciding what to get, the menu is quite extensive. Our server was helpful, and made several recommendations. My chicken sandwich was very tasty, but the fries were waaaaaaaay over-salted. Inedibly salty. We did not stay for desert, but will instead save that for our next trip."
Keith T.,"Charleston, WV",0,9,7,2.0,10/4/2015,really dirty restaurant. we haven't gotten our food yet but the the glasses were disgusting. when she got new ones they were dirtier. the men's bathroom  had no soap. one dispenser was broke the other was empty and both water faucets were broke and dangling from the sink. hope the food is good but we'll never come to this one again.
Lisa S.,"Cranberry Township, PA",32,1,,1.0,10/10/2016,"Don't go here.  Service is horrible.  Got seated and waited 15 min, couldn't get anyone to wait on me.  Went back to the hostess stand, she was as rude as can be, and said she would send someone over.  Waited 10 more min.....still no service, so I told the manager and just left.   Worst restaurant I have ever been to."
Ric P.,"Severn, MD",388,311,2378,4.0,12/18/2013,Great menu!  Great food!  Great service!  What more can be said...
Shayna W.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",1,6,7,2.0,2/12/2016,"This chain is usually a crowd pleaser however this was not quite the same CCF experience I am used too.  We were sat in a table that looked out into the casino slots, hmmm... My pizza was really salty and the waitress forgot to enter my appetizer order. I will not be back."
James C.,"Poolesville, MD",1,62,16,2.0,7/29/2014,I went into the restaurant after hitting the casino with some friends. I walked in the the bar area and sat myself. For 10 min I sat without being acknowledged by any staff. Eventually I was able to grab a server who was walking by to put in a drink and food order.  Overall the food was solid but the reception I had from the staff was very poor. I have eaten at Cheesecake factories all over the US when traveling for work and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at one.
Laura V.,"Sumter, SC",5,13,,3.0,7/22/2014,"We ate here 7/19/14 which was a Saturday so they were super busy as expected. The wait time was reasonable for a table for 2. Had the crab and artichoke dip for an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious - a huge serving of hot dip and plenty of bread with it. Our entrees were good. I ordered the skinny chicken lettuce tacos which had really good flavor and were actually filling. My husband had something that included chicken, steak, and a huge portion of mashed potatoes. All very good. Only issue was our server, it was almost as if she totally forgot we were in her section. She'd help the tables immediately around us and then just skip around ours. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying."
Joe J.,"Gambrills, MD",566,247,1188,4.0,8/1/2015,"Have been to this location several times, and though there have been times I wasn't completely happy with the meal. There has never been a time that I have had a complaint about there service. Now let me clarify that I am an adventurous eater. I like to try new things, and it doesn't always work out in my favor. I can't hold that against them on my review though, and i'm not. Some dishes I have had are the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp (Spicy, but Good.), Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo,Shrimp Scampi, and a Variety of cheesecakes (Ultimate Red Velvet,White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, Tiramisu, Dutch Apple Caramel),and Craigs Crazy Carrotcake being my favorite. This spot is obviously located at Arundel Mills (Note The Adress), and can get rather crowded seeing as how its located just outside the casino. My last visit we waited about 25 minutes for a table. Overall It's a pretty nice restaurant."
Zara K.,"Rockville, MD",63,192,15,1.0,8/29/2014,"Went here a while ago, definitely the worst  Cheesecake Factory iv been to. They really are feeding hungry gamblers here. The food was tasteless, the same food elsewhere tastes amazing .  Worst cheesecake branch ever !!  Cajun jambalaya was horrible Avacado rolls were sickening  Mac and cheese balls were chewy  What else do u wanna know?"
Amber M.,"Anne Arundel County, MD",0,3,,1.0,8/25/2016,A few days ago a friend and I went to go here for dinner. It was during the week and so it was not as busy. As soon as we walk in to the hostess desk two girls are standing there . One of them yawns while the other just looks at us. For some reason I'm not sure why nowadays the workers wait for you to greet them. After being seating in a corner I noticed the table was not even wiped down. Crumbs were all over it. So we moved a table over . Ten minutes had passed and no one came to greet us. We asked the bartender if we could please get some service and he said yeah . Still nothing. My friend and I decided that we were not going to give our money to a business who's staff is very unprofessional. So we decided to go to another restaurant close by where the staff was very friendly. Rude and unfriendly people really drag businesses down these days.
Rocky B.,"Fort Meade, MD",31,63,10,5.0,11/20/2015,Love this place great food reasonable drinks and excellent service! Couldn't ask for a better dining experience!
Ma-e M.,"Baltimore County, MD",0,1416,569,3.0,9/7/2014,"If you want to go big with gusto, Cheesecake will give you the calories you need on the target. Cheesecake is a factory of all food fairy tales. The food look and taste very good but watch out - they food-foul you. The magic starts when your tummy gets as big as you don't want them to be. But have fun as the food is attractive and pretty tempting too in price. I'm sure you can handle it otherwise why would you come to cheesecake if you can't."
J T.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,4,,4.0,8/19/2016,"Had a date night here about a week ago with my boyfriend. We had a 40 minute wait, but that's too be expected on a Saturday night I guess. Once we were seated, Lauren greeted us and offered us drinks and appetizers. She was a great server. Very knowledgeable and upbeat. The food was good and so was the cheesecake! Enjoyed my wine as well. I like this location better than the Pratt Street one. We will definitely be back."
