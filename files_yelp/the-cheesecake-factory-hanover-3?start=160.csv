Katey K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,4,,2.0,12/30/2015,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants in several states and this is by far the worst one ever. For the price that you pay for their food, which is usually always excellent, I would not waste your time or money at this location. I have been to this location several times but after my experience tonight I will never go again. Expect to wait at least 20 minutes while they have plenty of clean tables available to seat guests, don't expect a friendly greeting from the hostess either in fact expect the opposite. We complained to the manager he apologized and that was it, no comps, no what can I do to ensure your future business etc, the women's bathroom was disgusting. The food was fine and our waitress was great but this is not up to par with how a Cheesecake Factory is run. They have many other dinning options at the mall, don't waste your patience on this one."
Jasmine W.,"Baltimore, MD",8,48,5,3.0,7/22/2014,"I have been here several times since its opening for different occasions. It's okay, I guess. I like the atmosphere. The restaurant is nice inside. The outside seating is nice too, however, it does not have the most pleasant view (the side entrance to the mall/parking lot).  The food is okay. The best thing that I've had there was the Chicken Bellagio which is really good, but the proportions are ridiculous. I was barely able to finish just a quarter of the meal. The Peach Bellini is also really good, but it depends on who makes it and I don't like to play roulette with my drinks so that is no bueno."
Nancy S.,"Greenbelt, MD",25,43,79,4.0,9/29/2013,"4 stars just because of the cheesecake alone.  The varieties are to the max and they seem to be ALL good although I have not sampled all of them.  The carrot cake is delish, the classic strawberry is always good, white chocolate raspberry is divine.   Yes, I'm forgetting about the food!  Everything I had was good- French country salad, pot stickers, spinach dip, calamari, chicken sliders.  I could go on and on..  Everything is good and in large portions.  You just can't possibly finish in one sitting.  Leftovers!"
Christina O.,"Baltimore, MD",220,145,1315,4.0,9/25/2014,"It's difficult to find if you've never been to Arundel Mills before-- but overall I had a great time, the floor is very slippery so beware if you're wearing heels!! The service was terrific, the food was awesome, the decor was amazing. I would definitely come back here soon."
Jayson W.,"Washington, DC",207,36,12,1.0,7/20/2014,"My order was screwed up 3 times. If that was bad enough, my sister and grandmother's orders were messed up too. The manager came over to apologize but that was it. Im not necessarily looking for free stuff but I would have been nice to have them acknowledge their mistake by offering to cover at least one of the meals. H*ll, a slice of cheesecake for my grandma would have worked wonders.  On the upside, when he wasn't avoiding my table, our server did have a LOT to say about gambling in the Casino tho..."
Raja K.,"Hanover, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/16/2016,Terrible customer service!  Arrogant and incase if you call them to place a to go order they will put you on hold for more than 30 mins and no one cares when u call them
Mark P.,"LOXAHATCHEE, FL",0,23,,4.0,2/24/2016,"My review is based on one dinner here.  Everything was on the money - exactly what I expected.   I was seated instantly.  Decor is very nice, but a bit dark.  Waiter was attentive but busy, and very polite.  Seared tuna entree was terrific, well executed and delicious. Some may complain about quantity, but I wanted a light meal.  Dirty martini were done right, dirty as requested.     They have espresso machine, yeah!  A bit pricey, but I enjoyed it. I'll be back."
Jenny H.,"Baltimore, MD",508,817,673,3.0,8/24/2012,"I should have originally given this place 3 stars, because I came back two nights ago and my food was not very good. My loaded baked potato soup tasted like clam chowder soup- I do not know why.  It seems like they made the soup in the same bowl, or somehow used a clam chowder base?  It was not as thick and creamy as I like, and not as ""loaded"" as I would have liked, as they barely sprinkled some bacon bits and a sliver of sour cream on top. I ordered their small side dish of kale salad, and they forgot to put marcona almonds on it.  I asked them to take it back. The service was spot-on though, our server is really nice and attentive but not overbearing.  He was nice about making sure our food order was right and getting us more bread!"
Elle Z.,"Vicenza, Italy",131,133,227,3.0,9/25/2015,"It's a cheesecake factory. Standard food. Service sometimes average, sometimes good. 20-40 min waits on weekend nights probably bc it's attached to the casino."
Hoyt H.,"Ellicott City, MD",9,76,3,3.0,9/13/2012,"I like this location better than the Columbia one, but your results may vary. I've had good food both times we've been here, but the service was mixed. Awesome the first time, meh the second. Same with the tables. Nice and quiet the first time (on the outside wall by the windows), ridiculously loud the second (next to the casino floor).  Standard cheesecake factory menu, so no surprises there. They have a bit of everything. I like to get an entree from their skinnylicious menu so I don't feel so bad about getting cheesecake later. The soft tacos with spicy shrimp are very tasty, and the tuscan chicken is good too. The cheesecake is always good. Just need to eat nothing but gruel the next day to make up for it."
Tim H.,"Silver Spring, MD",151,419,187,4.0,4/19/2013,"I have been to this restaurant a few times at various locations but more recently, I have been to this location the most in the past two years due to the fact that it is located near my job. The size of this place seems pretty large and due to it being fairly new everything looks nice and clean. The bar is kid of small compared to others I've seen but it seems to do its job without any problems. I am sure most people come here for the great cheese cakes that this place offers and is probably best known for but for me I come for the tasty appetizers and entrées that this place has to offer.  The appetizers are big enough to be a meal in itself but if you are in the mood to do some serious eating, then get an appetizer and an entrée. You will most likely feel really stuffed after wards but it is well worth it. I have tried their pasta dishes, several in fact. I normally get the lunch size portion since it is very filling. I like to eat and I can eat a lot but between an appetizer and a lunch size pasta dish, I get full easily. The menu here is full of great choices. Even though I stick to the pastas most of the time, I do like their salads and sandwiches. All their items are large and filling despite being called Skinny or lunch portion.  If you like good food served in large portions for a reasonable price, give this place a try. If you are a regular here, try something different. I've tried several things over the past few months and everything I've had I've enjoyed. Thanks for reading my review. This review is based off of my personal opinion and experience."
Dark K.,"Sumter, SC",0,10,,3.0,11/27/2015,"Food was pretty good and as always the portions are huge. Service was decent although it took a little while before our server cane to get our drinks. Once she  came things started moving decently enough. I warn you though parking is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The guys directing traffic may as well go home because their value is zero. If course that has little to do with the restaurant, however it diminished the experience a bit."
Eileen S.,"Rockville, MD",0,21,21,5.0,12/22/2015,The food was amazing! The waitress I had was very professional and friendly. She recommended the cucumber flavored lemonade and Chicken Bellagio as an entree.
Sean P.,"Charlottesville, VA",7,11,1,1.0,10/31/2015,Came here at 1130 pm on a Saturday it was not crowded.  Takes well over 30 minutes to get a drink. Way too slow especially since the place is empty.  Food came out before the drinks. Also asking for hot fudge with your Sunday gets you warm Hershey syrup.
Jack F.,"Dallas, TX",559,1045,799,3.0,6/17/2014,"Whether your up or down in the casino, you'll inevitably end up hankering for a bite to eat.  Cheesecake Factory is one of the few nearby options between the hours of 9:00PM and 11:30PM so bet it all on black or bet it all on a slice of cheesecake.  The portions are large enough to whether you're eating your sorrows away or celebrating a winner-winner-chicken-dinner.

Diana E.,"Hanover, MD",154,119,30,1.0,2/18/2014,"Worst experience ever! Especially for a group! Called the day before to give them the heads up for a medium size group. Who ever answered the phone disregarded me the whole time speaking with her. Swore that for a Tuesday night, my group would have no problem getting seated. I even asked her if we should get there a half hour early to make sure. Of course the next day they were swamped their were 4 other parties at the restaurant and we were quote over an hour wait! We spoke to the manager, who could give us no explanation and once we did get seated he never came back to check on our table or our experience. The food was horrible, with the exception of the bread. The waitress was extremely slow especially with a group. I have contacted the general and corporate manager. So after that experience I will never be back!"
Kim K.,"Landisburg, PA",0,70,,3.0,11/16/2015,"This was my first Cheesecake Factory experience.  It was acceptable but some improvements are definitely needed.  My friend & I could see the place was mostly empty when we arrived yet the young lady at the front desk asked for our name and made us wait a few minutes to be seated.  Strange when so many empty tables are visible. As soon as we were seated, we found at least two pieces of silverware that had crusted food on them.  We had a very polite and friendly young lady waiting on us; she apologized and brought clean replacements right away. We had trouble deciding what to order so our server gave us extra time and brought our drinks.  We were also given a bread basket of two types of warm, tasty bread but not until very close to when our meals came.  I would have liked it much sooner, in order to nibble while waiting for our meals. My friend had strawberry waffles and I had the steak tacos.  Both were very good, nice portions, except the cilantro rice on my steak taco plate was not full cooked.  The rice was very crunchy and dry.   We passed on dessert.  I know in a metropolitan area like this and attached to a big casino the prices will be higher but $8 for a piece of cake seemed crazy to us.  Overall it was an ok meal but I am not sure we will hurry back."
Brittany J.,"Oakton, VA",58,39,6,5.0,1/28/2014,"Dined here with 9 of my of my friends to celebrate my birthday. I've been in the restaurant industry for almost 14 years and I always say your experience at any restaurant truly depends on the server/bartender taking care of you. That being said our server Adam made sure we had an awesome night at Cheesecake.  Food and drinks were delivered promptly and as ordered. Drinks stayed full, plates were promptly pre-bussed and all of our requests were fulfilled. Must add I ordered the filet and it was cooked perfectly!! I've been dining at Cheesecake for years and while the food is usually good it is not always consistent and neither is the service. This was the first time both were spot on. Thanks Adam for a great night and for taking care of us!!"
Rachel S.,"Laurel, MD",204,29,100,5.0,3/16/2014,"Love love, did I say LOVE this place!!!! The servers are so professional, speedy, friendly, honest (with recommendations)! Every dish I've tried here is outstanding. We havnt even gotten started on the cheesecake!!!! I get this turtle caramel cheesecake with whip and it's too good to be true!!! I had a friend that was a chef here for a while and we even requested she cook our food. She came out to greet us and came back to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. OF COURSE IT WAS!!! I don't go to LIVE! Casino but I do go to the Cheesecake Factory inside of it :-)"
Rummy V.,"Columbia, MD",316,232,988,1.0,1/30/2015,"Always great food but the service was not expected to be so lazy. It took a great amount of time to receive our food and water. Each time we received something we were missing something. We spoke to two managers, one manager said they can't do anything for us. But it should not take an hour to get water with lemons and 2 hours to get food."
