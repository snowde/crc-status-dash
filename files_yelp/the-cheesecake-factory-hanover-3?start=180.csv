Amy N.,"Millersville, MD",0,9,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Went there today to celebrate my sons and my friend's kid birthday and we waited for over 1.5 hour, then got seated and yet waiting for 10 minutes for the server to show up. After that, he took our order and we had told him to bring us some water because the kids were thirsty. We didn't get anything for about 20 minutes later. Mean while we request for the manger, and the manager was too busy talking and entertain his family that he didn't bother to come see us right away until 10-15 minutes later. He raised no concern about it and acts as if its not that import to us. We have 5 kids with us and we weren't too happy about the fact the manger and the server didn't do their job. I understand the restaurant is busy, but at least the manager should do something about it rather than just listen to us and walk away. I would not return to that location ever again. The worse service i ever been to a cheesecake factory. At least other locations they serve you better and nicer. This location are the worse!"
Jordan K.,"Glen Burnie, MD",340,531,436,3.0,10/9/2012,"We went on Columbus Day around 130 PM and no wait in line whatsoever.  If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, the menu is intensive!  A lot of variety from mexican to chinese to italian.   We stuck with the lunch specials.  I had the fish and chipsand my wife got the grilled salmon.  Both were good!  I enjoyed my coleslaw and fish. Service was a bit slow on refills and our bread plates were still dirty.  You can feel the grime and see the sheen of grease on it."
Mr J.,"Washington, DC",3,7,,1.0,6/4/2016,Horrible service. The waitress brought me the wrong order and stated I had to pay for it because it was cooked. The manager stated he would not take it off the bill and threatened to call the police if I did not pay for it. The entire time he was talking the food was on the table and he was talking over the food and spitting as he was talking. Very unprofessional and no class at all. I would give them a negative star if it was available.
Jojo K.,"Beltsville, MD",76,1,,2.0,7/29/2015,Sooo I came for dinner alone and in the midst of eating my food a roach appears on my table. I had to leave start away.
Oliver G.,"Brentwood, MD",18,6,2,1.0,9/1/2015,"Well to be honest, I haven't been to this restaurant in years, but my mother, aunt, and sister been there yesterday, they ordered me a turkey burger and french fries, the fries are good, but the turkey burger tasted terrible, its as though this burger been frozen not fresh, I'm glad that I'm not eating that crap again."
Brandee S.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",102,56,,1.0,9/24/2013,"This is a chain...so the review is not about the food. Of course its good. Its the same as every Cheesecake Factory in America. This review is about the service. I was recently there to celebrate my mother's birthday. She turned 67 which is f'in amazing and we had a blast with her telling stories of her past. That is until the waitress comes over and tells us she'd received ""several"" complaints about us laughing loud. Really. Really (in my Amy Pollard voice). I mean...its the Cheesecake Factory. A chain restaurant. Inside a casino. We had to hear 3-4 birthday songs, machines going off, babies crying, people laughing, and we have to be checked out our volume. UGH! I HATE SHISSSHING! ABSOLUTELY HATE SHUSSSHING!!!  If you come out, to a busy restaurant, or you know what if you come out the house, don't think you can control other people. And servers, tell people to get a life. Managers, seat quiet people somewhere else. Don't ruin a 67 year old's birthday with the shhhh game!!! At a chain restaurant. In a casino. Really. Ugh! I wouldn't go back. To this place. In the casino again."
Quin A.,"Silver Spring, MD",15,185,377,4.0,5/8/2015,"Nice lunch and dinner here. I got their sliders, tortillas, and fish and chips. Food was tasty. The wait before being seated was long and the booth they gave us was crowded. Service was friendly and fast. Overall a good experience."
Linds M.,"Columbia, MD",2,5,10,4.0,9/29/2013,"Came here for date night on a Saturday night. It was about a 40 minute wait, which was expected. Overall, delicious dining experience. Maybe I've been very lucky, but all of my Cheesecake Factory experiences have been great.  We got the Pasta Carbonara, huge portion! It was surprisingly light to be a cream sauce, which was great. Our favorite dish was the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane... I highly recommend it. It's the perfect potion and absolutely delicious!  Two regular Margaritas (compliments to the bartender, they were beautifully crafted and tasted amazing), and two entrees later it was about $57 without tip. Not extremely cheap, but for the quality of food and the portions we were very satisfied. Only wish I would have saved room for dessert! Lessons learned... Will definitely be back!!"
Maria J.,"Washington, DC",158,1,,1.0,8/1/2015,"Was seated right away, waited 15 minutes before server came to the table.  Waited an hour before eating because food was over cooked and they left the other guests plates sitting too long and had to make all the meals all over again.  Was offered free cheesecake as a consolation.  Terrible service."
Luis S.,"Montgomery, AL",35,16,3,1.0,6/27/2015,"While wait time to get seated wasn't bad (30 mins), after being seated, waited 10mins before we saw anyone for drink service, after drinks came the girl avoided coming by the table as we were ready to order. After ordering our food, 15mins after appetizer came in. 1 whole hour after only one plate of the three entrees order came in and no sign of the other two..., still I blame ourself for not looking at the reviews of this place before coming here. Please please please re-consider coming to this place at all, this is our last time!"
Chandra O.,"Columbia, MD",13,119,63,3.0,2/27/2016,"This CCF is located directly outside of the food court at Arundel Mills Mall. The mall shoppers and casino gamblers means this is one VERY busy location. We arrived around 5:30 and had an hour wait for a table. Our server, Amanda, soon greeted us and took our drink orders. We had to wait a bit for the bread but not much of a big deal. I ordered the jambalaya with rice and extra sauce however there was no extra sauce when it arrived so dish was a bit dry. Since this is a hot location I can say I was quite pleased at the speed in which we got our meals. Now to gripe...there are only 2 stalls in the ladies room! 2! All the people this location seats and majority of patrons are women yet only 2 stalls! Absolutely ridiculous! On top of that, the bathroom is quite small so definitely will have to squeeze in if more than 2 people are waiting to use the facilities. Yep...it's that small. Smh epic fail."
Christina S.,"Severn, MD",180,54,12,4.0,4/14/2015,Love love love the Cheesecake Factory. I come here at least once a month. The food is always amazing. The only thing is Arundel mills does not have a happy hour (they'll get the business regardless). For happy hour you should go to Columbia.
Darrell K.,"Seal Beach, CA",507,1662,2605,3.0,10/4/2013,"I avoid chain restaurants when I'm on travel.  Why go to them when you can go to them while at home.  I'm at home.  Even with that, I prefer the local establishments.  But I have to say, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains.  Nicely decorated, good atmosphere and a menu with plenty of quality choices.  This particular one is basically the same as the other ones.  It is part of the casino, although it has its own door so you don't have to go into the casino.  Unlike the other chains, it has opened windows to the casino, raising the decibel level higher while you listen to all the slot noises.  Don't worry about the people noise because casino patrons are typically losing their money and suffer silently.  The meals are quite large and because of that, I never go for a cheesecake.  Rather ironic.  Today was an exception.  As I thought it would be, it was great., particularly the Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Service was friendly and fast.  Come here, eat good food and be entertained by the losing slot players."
Nani A.,"Elkridge, MD",3,25,12,4.0,5/30/2015,I come here all the time cause I live super close and literally never have a problem with the food/service. It's a chain restaurant so I really don't expect crazy five star quality food but it's still very good! Huge menu with lots of appetizers so I always go here with people because theres something for everyone and lots of apps to share. I come here all the time (its almost embarassing lol) and haven't had a bad experience yet!
Jane D.,"Weybridge, VT",0,26,6,1.0,7/2/2015,"I hadn't been to cheesecake factory since i was a teenager and I realize why. The waitress didnt care to be there. I got a beet salad which was fine, a little too much dressing, and big globs of goat cheese. My dad and grandpa got the ribeye and they could only eat 2 bites. it was just saturated in salt. The mashed potatos were flavorless and cold. The asian salad was alright but also far too much dressing. I also got the chicken taco lettuce wraps but they were also salty. How a lettuce wrap could be that salty I have no idea. It really says alot when a restaurant uses so much salt to try to make food taste good. Unfortunately, all the salt in the world couldnt mask the cheap taste of the food, and trust me, they used a lot of salt."
Yeong M.,"Hanover, MD",3,22,,2.0,8/11/2015,My wife loves Cheesecake Factory except this one.  Typical casino marketing trap. It's ok if you're being comped but if you're paying cash the food is nowheres as good as other cheesecake factories.  The decor is swank but if you want decent food go to the one in Columbia or inner harbor
Erica C.,"Odenton, MD",266,173,121,3.0,3/11/2014,To my surprise this was one of my better CF experiences. We went on a Tuesday evening  and were seated promptly. Drinks were flowing and service was polite and attentive. Standard CF fare...the toddler enjoyed her Chicken Quesadilla and I my chicken Littles.  We tried the CF Merlot and it wasn't trash...so that's good!  I will visit this location again...on a weeknight.
Ms S.,"Fort Washington, MD",1,42,15,4.0,4/3/2014,"Short and sweet of it...Service was great, FOOD WAS AWESOME!!!  You cannot go wrong with a meal at the Cheesecake Factory.  They give you hefty sized portions and I have never had a meal here that I did not like!  On my last lunch here we arrived at around 11 AM. There was no wait and the hostess seated us immediately.   I ordered the Chicken Carbanera pasta and it was delicious!!  This was the first time I tried this pasta and I was not disappointed.  I ordered my usual strawberry lemonade as well.  I was way too full to get cheesecake but trust me next time I will get one to go!"
Leslie O.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,,1.0,6/13/2015,Rudest hostess ever!  And the bathrooms are dirty and smelly  I love my Cheesecake Factory in Henderson but this east coast version is for the birds - bleh!
Tamara F.,"Washington, DC",165,27,1,2.0,12/30/2014,"Disappointing food, drink and service. And I LOVE this chain. But no good. Cheesecake was good though."
