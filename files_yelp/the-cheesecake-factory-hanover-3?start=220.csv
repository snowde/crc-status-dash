M N.,"Williamsport, MD",2,3,1,2.0,12/17/2014,I was disappointed with the service before and during my dining experience. Our seating took more than 20 minutes after we were told a wait time of 10 minutes. The hostess appeared bothered when I asked her when my party's table would be ready. The management informed my party that a large group arrived which created an extended wait time.  I strongly encourage management at this location to huddle with staff to ensure staff remain focused on the mission during busy periods.
Crystal S.,"Washington, DC",16,15,9,2.0,9/6/2014,"It's always hit or miss with this place. Today was a total miss. I ordered the ""spicy"" chicken sandwich. The chicken was over breaded and incredibly greasy. The only thing that could've been mistaken for spicy was the chipotle sauce. Don't waste your time or money ordering this one."
T. B.,"Glenarden, MD",8,112,53,1.0,8/19/2012,"At first I was impressed when I went on a Thursday night with a group. But went on a Saturday late afternoon and it was horrible. We had to wait 20 minutes for our waitress. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes for our beer and milkshake. Okay then we had to wait another 30 minutes for our order and when it came it was wrong. Our waitress, Melody made excuses that the entire afternoon all her orders were messed up. Like I believe that BULL Shit!!! Not!! Will not eat there again. Thsnk God parking was free."
Grecia O.,"Anne Arundel County, MD",83,36,4,5.0,9/19/2014,Omg this place is delicious! I've been here a couple of times.  If you go during the day I suggest you get the lunch serving because it is huge! The staff is also very friendly.  The only thing I suggest is adding more lighting inside. It's too dark in there at night!
Lamont W.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,6,1,1.0,1/16/2014,"Part 1 I am writing this review in advance of being served my food. For starters, this wasn't my first time eating here. When me and my family were seated I noticed that the lights were dim. Too dim for my liking.  Upon, sitting down my wife noticed that some of the silverware was dirty. After using my flashlight on my iPhone we discovered that all the silverware was dirty!"
Elizabeth S.,"Arlington, VA",306,459,864,4.0,8/23/2012,"I really like how there is a cheesecake factory attached to the casino. The service was good, there wasn't a wait, and the food was pretty good. We sat on the side that we could watch other people gamble. Everything is the same as other cheesecake factories. Will come back."
Ethan H.,"Alexandria, VA",1,10,,4.0,7/21/2013,"Okay so I love this chain. First time at this location, tried previously but the lines were too long, through no fault of their own obviously.  I had the chicken carbonara, which I loved. My date decided to try the chicken enchiladas which she didn't like at all, and ended up getting garlic noodles to go.  The staff was all very pleasant, absolutely no complaints there, especially considering that it was after midnight on a Friday night."
Nicki M.,"Baltimore, MD",787,81,269,3.0,3/23/2013,"Somehow I got talked into going to Maryland Live Casino in the middle of the day for a ""girls day."" Since I'm not big on gambling and cards, the lunch was the highlight of the trip for me. The Cheesecake Factory had no wait around 1pm on a Saturday. Score! So I went for the savory Chicken Madeira (Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes.). Not bad. And as always... the cheesecakes are always fun. I just can never eat them AFTER those huge meal servings. Cake to go!"
Keith S.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,7,,1.0,1/6/2016,"I had a bad experience eating at the Cheesecake factory.   The service was slow, and the food was not up to the normal cheesecake factory standard.  I was informed my wait would be 20 minutes so I took the buzzer.  Once my buzzer alarmed I then had an additional 15 minute wait to be shown to the sitting area.  After sitting for 15 minutes, the waiter appeared to get the drink and food order.  I ordered fish & chips that was still raw in the middle it tasted disgusting.  My wife wanted some ketchup and that took an additionally 15 minutes to receive.  We ordered deserts I knew this would be done right since it's the cheesecake factory.  I was wrong I received a tiny piece of carrot cake that was very dry.  In conclusion I was very shocked and disappointed in the slow services, bad food, and small portions of desert.  This was a 2 hour evaluation that normally takes normally 30 minutes."
Rob P.,"Manhattan, NY",43,181,,4.0,8/20/2014,I play poker a lot at Maryland LIve and I must say that the only place to get a decent meal is at the Cheesecake Factory.  I really like the asian grilled chicken salad.  I substitute regular grilled chicken for the breaded chicken that normally comes with the meal.  they also have good sandwiches including the chicken salad and turkey sandwiches.
Dave B.,"Odenton, MD",0,15,6,4.0,12/20/2015,"We stopped only for cheesecake and coffee - first visit to this location.  Great cheesecake, overpriced.  The waitress (Miley Cyrus/Scarlette Johannsen) was outstanding."
ML V.,"Washington, DC",42,72,12,2.0,8/6/2014,"I went here for National Cheesecake day, where they were offering 1/2 off on cheesecakes. Who wouldn't take the opportunity to buy one? The wait to order was not bad. We waited for about 5-10 min. However, the waiting process to pick up our orders was ridiculous. There was no sense of order on the tickets. The pile was sloppily set aside, which kept getting knocked over. I ended up waiting 1.25 hrs for one slice. A group of us had to bombard the cashiers to finally get our order. Apparently the only way to identify any sort of order was through time stamps. As bad as I felt for the workers, I can't completely give them the benefit of the doubt. They should find a better process to obtain orders and distribute them. I will probably comeback, but definitely not to this location on National Cheesecake day"
Pr S.,"Washington, DC",483,35,15,3.0,8/13/2014,"Good customer service..food is ok. Sometimes I have got some dry rice and untidy utensils.. But still worth visiting them. Try their Georgia peach drink, it's really good."
Mady J.,"Bowie, MD",128,154,111,4.0,5/5/2014,"I've been here a few times while shopping, going to the casino or catching a late night movie. The food is great. Much better than the other locations I have been.  Fun place for a meal. Large portions served up but they also have the slim menu for those watching the weight/cholesterol. Reservations are highly recommended because this place gets really busy on the weekends.  If you don't have a reservation, chances are you won't get in, especially on weekend nights. Recommend!!"
Vicki K.,"Laurel, MD",0,3,,1.0,11/23/2015,Anyone who knows me knows that I loveeeeeee the cheesecake factory. My first time visiting this one in Arundel Mills amd my last time. About a month ago my husband and I were at the casino and decided to try this one since right here we usually go to the one in Columbia.  BAD CHOICE wow the wait time was beyond normal then when we vibrate and walking to our table we are greeted by another couple and there escort so they were mot sync and not consistent so per the employee this couple was here first then after another 25 minutes wait we get seated...had to keep repeating order sent food and drink back twice then when wait 25 min to get cheesecake to go it was the wrong two wow this was so draining and a waste of money I am beyond dissatisfied
Robert J.,"Hanover, MD",15,24,3,5.0,5/4/2014,"Great service, great food, great environment! Even though its attched to the casino you still get a full restaurant experience. Very clean and professional and the wait isnt long at all. Love it!!"
Rabi J.,"Waldorf, MD",17,51,3,5.0,11/21/2012,I love this place! What else can I say! The menu is like a sensory overload! I always want to order everything!
Liz H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,21,42,2.0,7/26/2014,"Tea glass was covered in stuff, spinach dip was cold, burger was suppose to be medium and wasn't,  pizza was good, but no bread was provided. Refills were rare if  not non-existent.  The bathroom was without toilet paper (even after being reported).  Overall there seems a real lack of attention to quality on the part of management and staff.  The servers effort and willingness to apologize was the redeeming thing on this trip."
Ericka T.,"Washington, DC",105,99,37,3.0,1/25/2014,"Came here one night while gambling at Maryland live & had a great time. The service & food was good. I ordered the skinny chicken chili and a Cosmo. I was pleased with my meal. For dessert, I chose the pineapple upside down cheesecake and it was delicious!"
Sarah H.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",8,24,7,3.0,6/23/2014,"Went here for lunch with some ladies from work and got less than stellar service. I enjoy the food at Cheesecake Factory and my order was correct but I can't say the same for all of the people I was with. Simple things such as extra mayo took forever to get! Plus, my friend ordered a small appetizer and a Greek salad. Most people were about done their food before she got her 'salad'. I put that in quotation marks since it looked like it was all the toppings and fixins' of a salad but no actual lettuce. Why call that a salad? Just seemed strange to me. But, like I said - my food was correct and tasted good. Just not too crazy about this specific location."
