Megan R.,"Washington, DC",1,104,4,1.0,9/4/2013,"I WILL NEVER BE BACK.   I went out of my way to stop by on a Tuesday afternoon - at 12:30 pm - to pick up a could of slices of cheesecake to take home.  Easy, right?  Not so much.  I walked in and headed straight to the Bakery.  No one was behind the counter.  After waiting for a few minutes, I tried to check at the hostess station to find out who could provide the service.  But no one was at the hostess station either.  When someone finally did show up to the hostess station, they said that there is only one person assigned to the bakery, the person was probably in the back doing something about carryout orders, and would be back shortly - and that there was nothing they could do to get me on my way.  Another employee came up behind me to get a receipt from the bakery counter, but did not say anything to me, and certainly did not try to help me.   After waiting another bit of time for the mythical person working the bakery, I walked out - without any cheesecake.  I considered asking to speak with a manager, but considering how the employee at the hostess station was unable to help me out in the first place, I figured that would be a further waste of my time.   The lack of service at this location makes me seriously consider ever going to another restaurant location, even though I have had good experiences at other locations."
Sonja B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,16,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Came into Cheesecake Factory on this evening for dinner;  party of one.  Paige B. was my server,  never knew her name until now, looking onthe receipt.  She never introduced herself as my server.  What prompted me even more so to leave this note for others yo review, was the fact that I asked for a manager after sitting about 15 minutes to pay my bill once Paige B. left the bill.  I expressed to the manager; young Asian kid, that Paige B., never offered me any bread while waiting on my meal... when my meal was served,  she came by dropped the plate on the table, as it slid across the table and walked away... the guess across from me comments where my exact thoughts, as if she toasted a plate to an animal.   She did not stick around to ask if I needed anything; no condiments at all,  and it came with the meal...  it took her 10 minutes later, in passing is when I was able to catch her to ask for condiments.   By then, my meal was cold.  She never gave me a refill nor offered.  After sharing this with the manager,  he not once apologized for Paige B. actions, nor offered to compensate me after telling him my service was horrible.  I don't come here often,  but when I have, on a Friday or Saturday night as busy as the place is, service had been exceptionally well,  considering that high volume of customers waiting to dine.  Paige B. doesn't give a care because it's obvious,  neither does the manager!"
Anna B.,"Rockville, MD",304,126,546,4.0,8/14/2013,"I love every Cheesecake Factory, most likely my favorite chain restaurant. They're always very consistent in their food execution and presentation. When I visit, I'm ordering the Thai lettuce wraps 90% of the time as my entree. I use it as an excuse to get a slice of cheesecake to go. :) Thai wraps to me is like the one thing I could eat once a day and never get sick of. You have the sweet, heat, and sour... My fav flavor combination. It's also a textural heaven with the julienned veggies of cucumbers and carrots. The coconut thin vermicelli noodles sprinkled with sesame seeds for crunch.. Cilantro.. Chopped peanuts.. Ahhh! Soo good all wrapped into a butter leaf lettuce! They have 3 amazing sauces that accompany this dish.. A spicy peanut sauce, a tamarind sauce, and a cilantro/honey/cumin sauce. It's messy to eat but worth all the wet napkins you'll be needing. You can forget the bread basket they give you at the start that's complimentary and if it wasn't, I would be happy paying for it. It's soft and chewy and with the whipped butter.. Ohh wow. Look at me with my run-on sentences. Now I either get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake slice with sliced strawberries ( you have to ask ) and whipped cream. I'm not a chocolate person but when I do get chocolate.. I do it right and it's dark chocolate. The strawberries balance out the richness of this dessert which can easily be divided over 3 days. My new discovery, is their pineapple upside-down cheesecake. This is just crack.. Plain and simple. I want to go door-to-door with plates of this stuff and spread happiness everywhere."
Michael C.,"Camp Pendleton North, CA",40,50,27,5.0,12/29/2013,"A buddy and i sat at the bar. He ordered steak. I got Cuban sammich. He ordered med-rare. Came out med well. They gladly fixed with another BIGGER cut. Bartender apologized. Manager came out to apologize and checked up on us when the syeak situation was rectified. The Cuban was super dry but it was all good. Overall, bartender and manager played a big role by being cordial and professional. 4 stars only because of Cuban. Otherwise, 5 stars."
Wendy M.,"Silver Spring, MD",196,73,13,2.0,5/30/2013,"I WILL NEVER BE BACK. Firs of all let me say that the reason for giving them two stars is because their food was edible. That's it.  I was very surprised to know that to apply to be a server at Cheesecake Factory, you have to have years of prior serving experience. I think my emotionally sour, angst-filled, people-hating teenage brother could have provided better service than the THREE servers COMBINED who came back and forth to our table, who probably have had ""years"" of experience serving. It seemed as if my boyfriend and I had not walked into a Cheesecake factory, which is supposed to be a great restaurant with delicious food and EXCELLENT service, but rather an institution for people with memory loss and horrible customer service skills. Let's start by saying this chain itself is not too bad. The Cheesecake Factory location in Columbia, MD, is better. Go there if you have a hankering for yummy mango cheesecake and good food.  It was a weekday night, so this restaurant was decently busy. We were informed our wait would be about 15 minutes. That was fine, since I had expected around half an hour. EXCEPT...15 minutes went by, then 20...then 25...then 30...We took our pager back to the counter, just to find that we had been buzzed already and that our pager was broken. It would be another 15 minute wait. OKAY FINE, but could we get an apology? Nope, the girl at the desk made it seem like it had been our fault our pager was broken. Like we'd actually spent the past twenty minutes huddled over the pager with screwdrivers, giggling and taking all the wires out.  Finally, we were seated. The waitress seemed decently friendly, and gave us both menus and asked us what we'd like to drink. Both my boyfriend and I ordered waters. It took about fifteen minutes for the water to actually come out. What were they doing, milking the great cow of wonderful tap water? We placed our orders, him for some Jambalaya and I for the skinnylicious turkey sandwich. I noticed the people around us had straws for their water, so I asked our waitress to come by with some straws and lemons. Fifteen minutes later, I asked another waitress for straws and lemons. Ten minutes later, my boyfriend finished his nasty tap water. That's when the second waitress decided to come by with straws. No lemons. I asked her to bring lemons, and she said she would. Maybe she was scared we'd squirt them in her eyes in revenge for the horrible service, but I couldn't do that because she never came back with lemons. It took this terrible cheesecake factory an additional 40 minutes to cook our food. Seriously? The skinnylicious turkey sandwich requires no cooking and is only about 4 inches in diameter (warning to everyone! THE SKINNYLICIOUS MENU IS ONLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR ANOREXIC BABIES WHO WANT TO PAY ADULT PRICES!) The fries I got with my sandwich were soggy and limp and seemed like they had gone for a nice, hour-long swim in stale oil. To make this worse, the waitress did not seem to understand that most people like their fries with ketchup or some sort of seasoning. I had to actually ask yet another waitress (our first one never came back until the end) to bring me some ketchup for my sad excuse for fries. The ketchup came in about five minutes, the quickest thing that had been served so far. Maybe next time I go to a cheesecake factory I should just order ketchup. My boyfriend's jambalaya looked like some middle school science experiment, and the rice was crunchy - not in a good way, but in a this-chef-does-not-know-how-to-cook-rice way. The seasoning was too strong, and not mixed in very well.  So in summary, we starved for about 40 minutes before we were seated, about fifteen minutes for water, starved another 45 minutes for our food...and all the things you'd think servers with years of experience would know to do, such as give customers straws, ketchup, and requested lemons, were completely absent. And following our disgruntled prodding at our food, I at my gerber-bite-sized sandwich and he at his puke-looking-uncooked rice, our original waitress finally showed up. I have to give her props for being so obliviously cheerful. She came up to us and told us she hoped we had a great dinner, and asked what we'd like for dessert.  I was so fed up with the terrible service I told her I wanted nothing but the check. She looked extremely surprised, like two people who had just paid a horrible amount of money for crappy food and even crappier service should give Cheesecake factory the opportunity to show them how rock-bottom they could get. My boyfriend and I paid the bill and left.  I can't speak for the actual cheesecake here, since I didn't actually have it. But I do know that I will never, ever, EVER be back for the dine-in experience at this restaurant EVER AGAIN. It wasn't that busy when we ordered our food, since the two tables to our right were completely empty. So what's your excuse, Cheesecake Factory?"
M J.,"Columbia, MD",1,12,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I am very disappointed in this location the hostess she said her name was Amanda she was horrible, unprofessional and beyond rude. Then I went to the cheesecake counter to order takeout and was greeted the same way which was no way at all. I will never go to this locations again and encourage everyone else not to either. As far as I'm concerned no one there should be working in customer service especially the hostess."
Kenneth L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,86,,2.0,7/6/2013,"I came to this Cheesecake Factory yesterday for dinner. This is one of my favorite places to dine and I come here constantly. Over the years, the quality of food has gone down hill. I have been loving and ordering the Miso Salmon for over 10 years. This time it was alittle bit different,  the miso stated like a watered down miso that someone made on budget. There was a very light hint of Miso and a mixture of water on top of my fish. I was very unimpressed. They need to bring back the quality of the food."
pseudo n.,"Severna Park, MD",3,244,2,2.0,10/4/2014,"Disappointing.  The margherita pizza had almost zero cheese, and the taste was not even as good as a $0.99 Totino's pizza you can get at Safeway.  The cheesecake was OK, but it's been better in years past.  Pizza = one star, cheesecake = 2, and only the server kept this from being a one star review overall as she was pleasant and attentive."
Claudia R.,"Alexandria, VA",8,17,1,2.0,3/4/2014,"I been here a lot  of times but this time it was bad. Food was flavorless service was terrible, waiter took the orders wrong we let him know and didn't bother at all.. I will not be coming back for a while.."
Veronica J.,"Dallas, TX",170,149,29,5.0,9/7/2013,"I went for lunch before a little shopping and gambling. The service was awesome. Our waiter was great!!  The food was great. This was my first time trying the Louisiana chicken pasta. Wow, it was awesome. I've never had a bad experience at any Cheesecake Factory so I wasn't expecting anything other than the food and service I reviewed."
Greg A.,"Elkridge, MD",0,8,,2.0,1/25/2015,"We came here for my wife's birthday on Saturday evening. The 40 minute wait was more than an hour, but no big deal it was Saturday at a casino. The problems all started at the table, it was sticky and dirty. The silverware was dirty. Now i know why is so dark in there. Our food came out wrong and our waitress was no where to be found. When the correct food did arrive it was cold and bland. Not worth the wait. We left without dessert, we had enough of their lackluster effort. I won't be going back to this location."
Tracia D.,"Laurel, MD",81,28,14,4.0,10/11/2013,"I am no stranger to The Cheesecake Factory, but this was the first time I stepped out of my comfort box.  I ordered the Kale salad and the Spicy Tuna Roll which is flash fried tempura style.... Both were very delish.  I am now a fan of Kale salad's thanks to TCF!"
Huggie H.,"Alexandria, VA",4,16,4,3.0,9/15/2013,It's your average Cheesecake Factory.  Just a tad more crowded since its located in the casino.
Joseph W.,"Columbia, MD",75,229,48,4.0,6/9/2013,like the food cheese cake a little high but i would go again
Heather J.,"Washington, DC",44,657,416,3.0,12/16/2012,"I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in probably 5 years until yesterday. Every time someone suggested it, I'd nix it because the menu is so overwhelmingly huge, and I remembered it being just kind of generic - like Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. But yesterday I changed my mind. I met some friends here for lunch before going to a movie and really enjoyed the meal. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. The food was all really good. The buffalo wings and spinach-artichoke dip were especially good, and I love the chips they serve with the dip. The avocado egg rolls were great, as well. The nachos could have used more cheese, or at least have the cheese dispersed more evenly over the chips - some chips didn't get any. Anyway, next time someone suggests the Cheesecake Factory, I won't turn them down!"
Chris D.,"Cleveland, OH",1,65,10,3.0,10/25/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. I know what I am getting into. Too much of everything, good service, decent food. This one was all these things. And it's fun walking thought the casino. Parking can be a challenge though."
Vivi N.,"Lanham, MD",16,82,111,4.0,8/26/2012,"I honestly didn't know that this establishment came along with Maryland Live!, a very much publicized casino. It was only when I ran into a friend at Arundel Mills that she told me that Cheesecake Factory was inside of the casino.  Interesting. I walked in and went straight to the Take-Out cheesecake counter. I was feening for some quick sugar. (I ain't ashamed!). Peering inside the see-through counter, I was impressed with their variety. Each slice was either $6.95 or $7.95. I almost lost my shit when I saw a Snickers cheesecake. I heart Snickers (from time to time, of course). After probing, the associate pulled out the cake to show me. My excited quickly dissipated. The cake looked gooey, and quite honestly, like a baby threw up on top of the cake. That's where the Snickers part was located. I'm pretty sure it's tasty but seeing it up close, I just found myself giving a stank face. A few minutes later, I'm pretty sure I fainted when 'Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake' flashed across the screen above the register counter. I heart Reese's (all the time, of course). I made a mental note to come back and taste this heavenly wonder. Yes, I'm already proclaiming it to be heavenly. In the end, I went with the vanilla bean cheesecake (DELICIOUS!) and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake (It was for my Mom but I sneaked a bite. All I have to say is when did nuts come with Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough? Not impressed).  All in all, I was fine with my orders."
Deborah N.,"Columbia, MD",116,632,231,4.0,6/30/2012,"Being only a mere mortal, unlike the Yelper with the FTR, I had an opportunity to sample this outpost AFTER it opened to the general public. It was tha' bomb dot com. It was the Cheesecake Factory, which is always awesome (except while you are waaiting in line to get in). Who doesnt like cheesecake? Well, okay, me. But I still love this resfaurant with its fresh ingredients, 30 page menu and mashed potatoes of which I dream..."
Dennis T.,"San Antonio, TX",6,29,1,3.0,11/9/2014,"I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which consisted of 4 or 5 small pieces of chicken and 6 medium sized very, very tough shrimp. My companion ordered the Shrimp and Angel hair pasta, which came with 5 medium sized shrimp. That is a very small quantity of protein for the prices charged. I remember when Cheesecake Factory was synonymous with a lot of good tasting food. Not at this particular CF. Never again."
Eric E.,"Nottingham, MD",2,35,14,3.0,3/22/2013,The stuffed mushrooms are to die for but the chicken and avocado club was so so! But the dulce de leche milkshake is delicious!
