Courtney F.,"Carmel, IN",5,130,10,2.0,3/5/2013,"I've never understood the appeal of this chain. Sure, the cheese cake is good, but the food is average at best while being slightly expensive."
R E.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,1,,5.0,12/24/2014,Have been to this Cheesecake several times & had great service each time. The food is great here - just like any CF. Impressive for how extensive the menu is. I would recommend having a meal here. Guessing you will be too full for dessert but don't forget to take a piece of cheesecake home. It's fabulous!
Angie M.,"Galien, MI",68,37,16,4.0,3/31/2013,"Avocado egg rolls are amazing! Loved entree too. Small bar, waiting area, and bathrooms for a big busy restaurant.  We will be back:)"
Michelle H.,"Rockville, MD",39,6,1,4.0,10/27/2014,We were looking for a casual place to have coffee after our meal at another restaurant in the area. We were greeted and seated promptly. Nicole was our server and she was very gracious to our needs. Refills were served regularly and she was very knowledgeable of the desert menu. It was my daughter in laws first experience of the Cheesecake Factory and our server Nicole made it a good one. We'll definitely go back.
April C.,"Laurel, MD",0,7,,5.0,10/26/2014,"10.25.14 Reggie is the best server we have ever had anywhere. Despite our app arriving minutes  (and not so warm) before the meal, Reggie made sure it was taken off bill AND we got a free one to bring home.The manager (asian man, didnt get his name, sorry) even stopped by the table to apologize. The best service and food. Thanks guys!"
Shakeem B.,"Washington, DC",62,139,73,4.0,3/3/2013,"I always enjoy my visits to the Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is conveniently located in the Maryland Live Casino so it's usually pretty busy. The food is always good and the service is hit or miss. I've never had a bad experience but there, as with most restaurants, those special servers and hostesses that go above and beyond to give you a memorable dining experience."
Juliet K.,"Arlington, VA",266,498,56,3.0,11/25/2012,"cheesecake is pretty same every where. there are always so many options its hard to decide what to get. i got the miso salmon this time, and it was a little bit overcooked. also when we ordered the calamari, there ended up being a bunch of chicken in it... so they comped that for that us, which was nice. ehh.. its cheesecake."
Ms. Toni D.,"Washington, DC",0,21,22,3.0,3/26/2013,We came here for my sister's birthday dinner.  The wait wasn't too terribly long especially with them being as busy/crowded as they were.  I had the Chicken Madeira which was not only plentiful but really good!  My sister had a Cobb salad that could've fed the table and she said it was good.  My brother-in-law had the Firecracker Salmon appetizer which was also delish.  Our drinks from the bar were great so we will definitely be eating here again!
Samuel M.,"Baltimore, MD",2,35,5,3.0,9/3/2014,its really not worth your money for the food I ordered a the crab cake and fries and I received 4 small ice hockey putts cakes and a handful of fries it was a little for $34 but the cheesecake was pretty tasty
Lola L.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,25,,3.0,11/2/2014,"My boyfriend and I come here once in a while, but have been only disappointed three times and on the same night! We came here for a friend's birthday and it was obviously busy as it was a weekend night, but the most ridiculous thing was that we didn't get our bread until we had finished our meals. That's one.  Two - my bf and I shared a dish, because come on, their dishes are big enough to feed an entire family. I don't remember what we ordered, because it wasn't memorable. It did have brown rice, chicken and peanuts, but the chicken was so salty, we couldn't finish it.  Three - our server, very sweet but really really talkative. Which is not a bad thing. I""m sure he was excited to talk to us because he was young and asian, and we were young and asian. The only thing that put us off was that he said we had to get this amazing alcoholic beverage (I believe it was a mixture of fire ball and blue moon?) and he hyped it up so much saying it was so good and what not. We got so into it that we all decided we wanted to get one. His reply? ""oh... we don't have fireball at the bar"" ... WTH? What a let down. It just felt like all he wanted to do was talk talk talk, while we wanted to eat eat eat.  It would've been perfectly okay if he said something like ""we don't have fireball at the bar right now, but if you guys go out, try this drink"""
Kristin H.,"Pasadena, MD",2,33,,3.0,1/5/2013,"We arrived on a Saturday night at 6pm and waited under an hour so I would consider that pretty good. I wish their seating wasn't so close. We were seated so closely with the couple next to us that we could clearly hear their awkward ""first date chat"". Their menu is huge! I ordered the Crab cakes and was getting all excited until 5 minutes after I ordered our waitress came back out to tell me there wasn't any. I ended up with the lemon chicken which was good but it was NOT crab cakes :(...They give very large portions which is good because their dishes come with a hefty price. She did a great job at keeping up on drinks and checking on us. Of course we got the cheesecake which was pretty good but not as good as everyone makes it sound. All in all, I probably wouldn't fight my way out of the door but I wont be jumping up and down to head back there."
Christina C.,"Odenton, MD",0,3,,4.0,7/23/2013,"This was the first time I was trying out this restaurant. It was my friends birthday. We went about 6pm to have a small dinner and mainly to go for desert. We ordered bbq pull pork sandwich and it was amazing.. the bun was soft and meat was cooked right. They only fault it had was that the fries were cold... Our server, Ciara was awesome, she was nice and pleasant. They were efficient at what they were doing. we didnt have to wait long for anything really. Also when it was cake time she remember it was my friends birthday as she told her when we got seated and she sang happy birthday to her and she made it truly special for her.  It was quality service and excellent food along with very reasonable prices.  I would recommend anyone to head out to the cheesecake factory at the arundel mills mall."
Ros W.,"Baltimore, MD",13,39,55,4.0,4/3/2013,"I went on a Friday night with a group of seven and the wait was only 10 minutes.  A little surprising for a Friday night but the were seating people fast. Otherwise, cheesecake factory is the cheesecake factory."
Mel M.,"Anchorage, AK",4,91,,3.0,7/10/2013,Is this the one next to MD Live Casino? If so; I love thier Chicken Marsala.  Better than Buca di Bepo's. The reason is that they portion are LARGE and flavorful. Buca does not give you pasta with the MArsala....weird!
Wesley S.,"Baltimore, MD",2,27,4,5.0,9/10/2013,There are a few things I like about TCF. They always appear to be clean. The service is always pretty good with only one exception coming to mind. They have a very wide variety of food. Every dish I've ordered is well prepared and well presented. Recommended.
Meg W.,"Washington, DC",31,2,,1.0,9/29/2015,"This was the worst experience I ever had at the Cheesecake Factory. It started with the hostess who said it would be 15 minutes and it was actually 45 minutes later after many other people that came in after us were seated and finished their meals before we even sat down. That is not even the worst part of the experience. We were finally seated and our waiter took forever to wait on us. We waited forever to get our food and each person was served in 10 minute intervals. They got my order wrong ( I ordered quesadillas and they gave me enchiladas) so I had to wait a good 15 minutes for it and it was terrible. I asked for the manager who was very rude and when I finished telling her what happened she said ""What to do want me to do""? I was shocked and said she needed to adjust our bill. We argued and each time our voices got louder and she mumbled that she didn't have time for this nonsense. She finally took my bill and adjusted it and then came back and thrust it in my hand. Very poor customer service all around. Untrained employees and disgruntled bad attitude manager. I will never go to this restaurant in Arundel Mills again. They have serious managerial issues, poor training as well as poor service."
Daniel Z.,"Odenton, MD",0,24,,3.0,5/14/2013,"Great food.  Service could be a bit better.  I definitely did not enjoy the experience from the hostess.  It's ok to have a bad day, but don't take it out on my family.  When someone asks a question, no matter how annoyed or busy you are, try smiling and answering instead of rolling your eyes. Professionalism truly lacking, but the cheesecake defintely made up for the experience."
Jacob S.,"Severna Park, MD",26,17,3,4.0,1/30/2013,Would be a 5 out of 5 but seriously common why would they leave the building open to the noise from the casino. Food was great as all cheesecake factory is but it's so noisy. It kinda changed the atmosphere from quiet hot date to noisy obnoxious date. Only good thing is that the wait isn't as long at this location.
Ed B.,"Baltimore, MD",60,53,1,2.0,3/18/2013,Service was sooooo slowwwwwww. We sat in the bar area and it took 2 hours for 2 people to eat. Chicken was burnt and bread arrived with our lunch. Never again.
Lesley E.,"Millersville, MD",1,66,,2.0,11/5/2012,"This location still being fairly infantile, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Server was awesome. The food? Nobody at our table really cared for their meal. They consisted of the Chicken Littles dish, Ahi Carpaccio, Fried Artichoke Hearts, and Turkey Burger. Maybe in a few months it'll be the well-oiled machine that TCF is known to be! :)"
