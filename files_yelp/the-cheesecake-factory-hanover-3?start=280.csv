Temeko W.,"Fayetteville, NC",37,21,,3.0,9/4/2013,The food was cold and the wait was extremely long which is to be expected on a Saturday due to it being connected to a casino.
Betty L.,"Allen Park, MI",0,1,,1.0,7/28/2014,"I ordered the Shepherd Pie, it was awful. Look like they throw se veggies together and heated it, potatoes were raw. Will never order again. Wad very disappointed we were celebrating my daughters Birthday."
Sashique D.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,3,1,5.0,7/27/2014,i have bin here multiple of times & the service is always phenomenal . i love this place.
Lisa M.,"Gainesville, VA",0,33,1,2.0,4/12/2014,"This was the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. The hostess was friendly, efficient, and organized, but the food and service otherwise left much to be desired. We had to finally ask for drink refills. The waitress didn't check to see how our orders went or if we needed anything additional. She was obviously untrained. My quinoa and kale salad had no quinoa to be found. I mentioned this, but the waitress shrugged and pointed to the non-existent quinoa, saying, ""see, there it is!"" (Um, no, but okay). The fried shrimp was super greasy. All portions of all items ordered were smaller than we receive at other locations. The food didn't look or taste like the Cheesecake Factory food that you'd expect; it was like diner food, but not in any positive way."
Nytisha F.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",4,6,3,4.0,9/16/2012,Love this place & location. 3rd or 4th time visiting. I came to the grand opening and have only been slightly disappointed once. Even then consideration and extra steps were taken by management to accommodate.
Cassandra T.,"Fort Meade, MD",27,5,,1.0,2/10/2014,Horrible service! My husband and I went here for our anniversary. We came late afternoon and it was not very busy which we prefer. We both ordered drinks and I ordered the artichoke appetizer. The waiter who took our order delivered our drinks and informed us his shift was over and we would have a new server. The new server came and took our dinner order. After about 15 minutes out dinner came out and I still hadn't received my appetizer. I told our server and she said our original server must not have put it in and she would put it in now. When it was finally brought out to me it was completely under cooked and not edible. I told her and she said she would et me another one to go as we were basically finished up with our meal and were ready for our cheesecake. When I got home I tried the artichoke only to find again it was not cooked and not edible. We spent $90 on this meal and service and food were not even close to worth that. I contacted corporate through email and have not heard a thing!
Cherie J.,"Washington, DC",59,70,18,3.0,4/7/2013,"Came here to celebrate my 21st bday and we (the fam) had a great time. I should warn you (even though i shouldn't because this is common sense) the wait on friday nights can be up to an hour long. I wasnt bothered because an hour in a casino can go by fast like a thief in a jewelry store. By the time i had played 10$ worth on the quarter slots plus a trip to the bathroom it was time for us to eat. The very first thing that i said walking in was ""where are the lights""? like seriously....this isn't a nightclub. I'm not too sure why most CF's have the lights dimmed so low but they need to fix that because i would like to see my food. To start i had the dynamite shrimp that weren't very dynamite...just mite. they claimed it was supposed to be very spicy but a toddler could eat one and be fine..the sauce was also lack luster. To drink i ordered a strawberry margarita and it was good...what would've made it better was a bit more sugar and a bit more alch por favor! As an entree i wanted to try something new and i really wish i didn't...i had the cajun jumbalaya with chicken and shrimp over rice...it was just so meh..i had a firm grip on my hot sauce bottle the entire time while eating it. And for dessert i ordered the tuxedo cheesecake...OMG...THIS CHANGED MY LIFE LOL...its my new favorite...it was so good that as i started eating it, my mom asked for a bite but decided to get the money ready for the check..BIG MISTAKE MOM! lol because it was gone!. all in all the waitress, nicole, was so nice and patient. I think i might try Bobby's burger place next time i go to maryland live."
Jamilah S.,"Columbia, MD",97,3,,1.0,1/19/2015,"I came on my birthday to celebrate, it wa my second time at the restaurant, (I'd been there previously and didn't have a great experience but chalked it to being very busy) I was disappointed once again and mad that I gave this location a second try. I relocatd from philadelphia and frequented the King of Prussia and South Jersey locations. Once again I found that the food tasted horrible in comparison and the service sucked. I understand that this location is located in the casino but thats no excuse to  prepare subpar food. My dinner was no where near what I expected (I've had the dish at other locations several times) and I had to wait 20 minutes for another dish to be prepared while my guests ate, only to find when I got my dish the pasta was hard (either over or under cooked) at this point I wanted to leave because I was yet again disappointed and did not have the patience to wait another 20 minutes for them to get it right. The waiter seemed unavailable and Ive never got out of my seat and darn near yelled to get a waiters attention as much as I did that night. Given this is my second bad experience I felt the need to write these comments and I will also share my review on yelp. This has left a poor taste in my mouth and I've learned my lesson I will not be returning."
Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,2.0,2/17/2013,"Clearly with a menu that large they can't be good at everything! This was my 2nd visit to this place and I was quite disappointed. The service was excellent. Servers name was Kiana - she wanted a good tip and she knew how to get it! I was disappointed with the food. I had the pizza and mac n cheese. I've made both better at home. The mac n cheese was lacking flavor and extremely oily. And the only flavor on the pizza was the pepperonis. Quite a shame really to spend almost an hour waiting to be seated (saturday around 5pm - seated at 6) only to have the best part of it be the $4 strawberry lemonade. BTW the mac n cheese was a side dish and at $6.95 seriously overpriced - both for the size and lack of flavor! If you are looking for a good meal I suggest trying something other than the two dishes I've mentioned here. This is definitely a place where if you find something you really like, stick with it."
Frances M.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,10,,5.0,9/6/2013,We ordered the burger sliders besides being a HUGE appetizer for $1 more you get a side! My fiancé ordered culotte sirloin and that was DELICIOUS!!! Cooked to term requested and PERFECTLY seasoned! For dessert we got the ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake and the only thing I can say is DEAR GOD!!! Delicious!!! Everytime I go to Cheesecake Factory the experience is excellent! Love it!
Jillian A.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2012,"OOk I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in both Annapolis, and Columbia many times.. and have never received anything but quality service, and decadent food..but now I have visited the Cheesecake Factory in Arundel Mills@MD Live! Casino 2x and both experiences were horrible, the 1st visit was on July 4th,my husband and I had been in the casino and thought we would check it out, we walked in, and were seated immediately..but then we get to the table, our waiter took our drink order..we waited abt 10mins,he came back and told us the bar was ""a little backed up""?..mind you we only ordrd 2 glasses of Sangria, long story short,he takes our order for the food..promises again he would be RIGHT back..well we waited for another 20mins..he was nowhere in sight..all of a sudden he and a waitress bring the food out..we got our food b4 our drinks?!! Were nvr offered any water..bread..nothing! The food was ok,but did not make up for the slow..just neglectful   even aft this negative experience, we just wrote it off as growing pains..waiter may have been new..whatever.  Now our 2nd visit was just this past Thurs night when My husband,sister and myself took our Mom out for her Bday..I'll try to sum up the series of horrible events we witnessed. We walked in, and were welcomed by the   sister did mention my moms Bday,and we were completely ignored..got to the table our waitress Erica,came over..took our drink order..we wait over 15mins..she comes to the table and apologized for the wait, returns abt 5mins later..with only 2 of our drinks..stood there and asked ""ok..everything ok here?"" Hmm..my husband and I would like a drink..with no remorce,she walked away..a bartender returned with our drinks, the drinks that did come were also from the bar..so not sure why only 2 came out..somewhere in all of that we order our food..when my husband ordered his food, their 'bang bang shrimp' she told him..its very ""coconutty""??..without him even asking anything abt it..long story short we wait ANOTHER 20mins for the food..and see her other tables also looking to see where she was as well, we look over and can see out the window right@the booth that were sitting at..outside she is standing at some guys car..and they're literally making out!! As if she is not even at work..she has no one waiting..nothing.At this point we were just disgusted..FINALLY after she dry humps her BF she decides to walk back in..brings food out with another waiter, again food wasn't bad, but we were all just ready to leave..no desert..no singing for our Moms Bday,which she could've cared less at that point anyway. We finished and left a $3 tip..and that was honestly too much.Now when we asked for the MGR we were told he would be right out..hmm how long do u think we had to wait for that??..We were all just irritated even more so now, and had to just get out of there. My sister called the next day..did say the actual Mgr seemed embarrassed and apologized. Supposedly sending a gift certificate..I usually am not a tough critic..especially in restaurants,but this was just ridiculous. IF we even visit a Cheesecake Factory again, it will definitely NOT be at Arundel Mills -_-"
Toni W.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,64,,1.0,4/2/2013,This was unlike any Cheesecake Factory I have been to.  The food was terrible.  The Spinach dip came with cold stale chips.  The quality of the food in general was not as good as other Cheesecake Factorys.  Service was slow despite restaurant being about half full.  We didnt get our water until about half way thru appetizer. Beware this is NOT the same standard Cheesecake Factory.  I wont be back
Jules R.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",2,18,,2.0,7/1/2012,"I've always had good meals here, but not this time. We ordered a chicken caesar salad and hibatchi steak. After 10 minutes, the waitress came back and said they had to restart the steak because she never told them how its done. We said we wanted medium and then she said my salad was ready. I said I'd wait for his steak to come out, but she said it would take 14 minutes. I said that's fine and she said she'd get us cheesecake as desserts on her. We didn't eat the cheesecake as we waited because that would be stupid, so we just sat there. When the hibatchi steak came out, my husband said it was good until he got to the 2nd piece. The rest of the steak was purple...disgusting. Not even red, or bloody...raw and right out of the fridge purple. My husband was sickened by this and couldn't eat. We asked for our cheesecake to go and we wanted to leave ASAP because he was getting nauseous. The comped the steak and cheesecakes and we left $0 tip."
Tom S.,"Dundalk, MD",0,3,,2.0,8/6/2013,"Food was ok, nothing spectacular, wait staff was fast and efficient. They couldn't find containers large enough for our leftovers and tried to put soup into a open coffee cup, just not a good idea. The table was still crusty and covered with crumbs for whoever previously sat there. I wouldn't go back."
Robert C.,"Columbia, MD",0,1,,1.0,6/14/2013,"I got sick eating there 3 times. 2 of my employees got sick after eating there multiple times. It took us this long to come to the realization that this ""upscale"" restaurant would serve bad food. Other than that, it is an attractive, well serviced venue."
Jim B.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2014,"Today I went here with a co-worker whose appearance looks questionable but he's wealthy. We were seated in the back of the restaurant in one of the booth's farthest from the front door (really thought the staff thought we may run out on our check and thus the seating arrangement). Then we were greeted by our waitress ( I will not disclose her name in this venue) who then asked us what we would like to drink, I explained that I am driving so I would just like a diet coke, my co-worker asked for a cranberry juice. No alcohol involved. She returned with our non-alcoholic drinks but then informed us that there would be a shift change and then passed us off to another waiter. To be honest I felt that she assumed based on her assumptions that she was not going to get a good tip from us so she passed us off to another waiter. The new waiter arrived and we ordered our appetizers and entrees, the new waiter then asked my co-worker if he would like another cranberry juice, when my co-worker responded yes the new waiter said "" I hope she informed you that these are not refills and are charged individually"" I immediately responded that that is not an issue and the waiter left. I ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls as an appetizer and the Chicken & Shrimp  Jambalaya as an entrée. My co-worker ordered a Margherita Pizza and the Chicken & Biscuits. the Salmon rolls were mediocre at best, tasted more like salmon rolled into wonton wrappers, fried and put on a plate with a bed of soy sauce and red cabbage. The Chicken & Shrimp Jambalaya was even worse. It tasted like cooked pasta was put into a bowl, pre-cooked shrimp and chicken were then added, then a frozen bag of pepper strips and a can of tomato sauce. Oh, and then garnished with cayenne pepper to make it ""spicy"". Also, there was so much water in the bottom of the dish there is no doubt that the ingredients were not fresh and the plate felt hot as if it had been microwaved.  If those ingredients ""were"" fresh and not ""frozen"" then they need to check their suppliers. All during this time the Waitress that was supposed to be off was still there waiting on other tables that arrived after we did. Just FYI, my mother raised 6 kids as a waitress by herself before working for the federal govt. I worked with her for 4 years during my teens in the same restaurant steaming crabs. She relied on her tips and I ALWAYS leave a good tip. The ""replacement waiter"" did a good job. The food sucked but on a bill of $75.42 I gave him the check back with $120.00 cash and told him to just give me $10.00 back because I did not have change. In other words he got a $34.58 tip. Which is roughly a 47% gratuity. As a result of this experience I will never eat at The Cheesecake Factory again and I will inform all of my friends not to do so as well. Bye the way, If you want a great Jambalaya go to Kramer""s Bookstore on Connecticut Ave. in NW DC and get the Fettuccine New Orleans, they've been serving it for years and it's absolutely delicious."
Kathy M.,"Manassas, VA",0,51,8,2.0,8/4/2014,"This location is going to ""sink"" the brand.  I have frequented many Cheesecake locations I ordered the Jambalaya pasta at the Hanover, MD location and it was horrible.  No where near the dish it use to be.  They have basically stripped out all of the flavor so that all you get is bland over-cooked pasta with protein and vegetables and cayenne sprinkled around the edges of the plate.  NO FLAVOR cooked into the dish at all.  This use to be one of my favorite dishes and it was extremely flavorful.  I would rather they have raised the price of the dish instead of lowering the quality of it.   I cannot believe that the quality of the food has diminished like this and that they are deceiving folks.    I complained on their website and was contacted by the manager and sent a gift card and asked to try it again.  I went back on Saturday night 8/2/2014 and tried the dish again (thinking perhaps it could have been an off night for the kitchen) but no such luck-- Same story--dish cooked the same unacceptable way so I sent it back again FOR THE SECOND TIME.  I will not return to this location."
