Ebony H.,"Baltimore, MD",63,224,756,4.0,7/13/2016,Came here on Mother's Day and the wait wasn't too bad but I am used to not having to wait at all at this location. I ordered the shrimp basket and had mashed potatoes vs fries because I adore their mashed potatoes. The shrimp and the cole slaw were both good and filling.  Had enough food for two meals.  My mom got the shrimp scampi with fettuccini noodles instead of the linguine and my gma got the turkey club.  Both liked their dishes.  For dessert we all got the same cheesecake but can't recall which one (this is what happens when you take too long to write a review) but it was delish.
Jason S.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,2,,3.0,10/25/2017,"The Vegan Cobb Salad was delicious, but I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries that never came. The waitress was very nice and said she had asked for the fries 4 times but they never came. She obviously took them off the bill, but I was really disappointed. How do you order something (that they have available) and never get it? Kind of sad."
Peter V.,"Hedgesville, WV",0,10,2,1.0,10/22/2017,Very average food and poor service. If that is what you are looking for you have found your place. Every time we go they tell us that they are making fresh bread and make us wait. When the bread comes it is always cool. I think they lie to save bread and to encourage you to buy more expensive appetizers. If you don't want to give us bread just don't offer bread you cheap jerks. Half the times we have eaten here our meals have come out at different times. Nothing worse than eating alone. I cannot recommend this restaurant.
Alicia M.,"Laurel, MD",2,17,2,2.0,7/25/2017,The food was good but the service was horrible. We sat there for literally 23 minutes before we were acknowledged and had our drink order taken.  The bread and butter never came and finally the busboy brought us bread with no butter.  Once the busboy told our waiter he finally stepped his game up but was already to late in my book.
Mia E.,"Temple Hills, MD",43,19,77,4.0,8/26/2016,"As usual this location did not fail to satisfy my taste buds or damage my pockets. Love the location adjacent to MD Live and depending where you're seated you might get a view of the slots and perhaps a winner or two. Vast menu including ""skinny options"" but wait...who want SKINNY at The Cheesecake Factory?! Mmmmm...nah. Had my favorite Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Cosmo. My date had the amazing special. salmon in a lemon caper sauce with mushrooms with mashed potatoes and broccoli ($19.99). Ahhhhh-ma- ZING. Salmon was perfect,  flaked easy and not a lot of sauce. We opted to nix the cheese cake because chicken sliders AND avocado egg rolls ( packed with red onion and whoa...) are enough to shut down the city.  Top that with the fantastic service. ..Shout out to Nicole. The Fat lady sings, no cake required!  The Cheesecake Factory chains are great and seldom disappoint. Why mess up a good thing"
Linda P.,"Hedgesville, WV",18,5,1,5.0,7/15/2017,Very busy but only waited 5 minutes for a table. Waitress was very polite and friendly. She came back several times to see if everything was good or if we needed anything. Food came out quickly. Food was delicious. One negative is a 2 stall women's restroom for a huge restaurant and one stall was out of order. I did not like how the silverware was wet and laying on the table not wrapped or laying in a napkin. We would definitely choose to dine here again.
S C.,"Waldorf, MD",0,1,1,2.0,1/13/2017,"Was there Thursday afternoon. Food was very disappointing, service and manager are excellent. The only good thing about food was the wheat bread and cheesecake flavor.  We had crab bites as an app, it was okay. My husband ordered a prime rib steak, medium rare. Came out very well done. My husband mentioned it to our server and the manager came by. They did offer to replace it but we were so hungry to wait again. Manager offered a free dessert. Which was very nice.I ordered Thai salmon, it was ehhhh. It's sweet and spicy, but after a few bites the sweetness kills all the flavor. I even told my husband maybe savory food is not their forte, since they are known for cheesecake. We ordered hazelnut cheesecake. They did make a come back, but they could have plated it better."
Rose A.,"San Antonio, TX",161,83,314,3.0,6/21/2015,"Came here around 2130 for a late dinner after a long drive back from South Carolina. The wait for a seat wasn't bad, food was decent and our waiter was super nice!  However, we waited about 30+ mins for our entrée. Our neighbor's food took even longer to get here. Correction, the whole table got their food first except for their young daughter.  One of the other waitstaff in the restaurant got mad at her table and was cussing at the machine behind our booth. Also they have the world slowest busboy. There was a table that left uncleaned for over 45 mins. We finally saw him clean it when we paid out bill."
John S.,"Hanover, MD",4,17,,2.0,9/2/2016,"Returned again for my fathers recent birthday.  Large portions, but the food seems to be lacking flavor all over.  I had the steak tacos because the description sounded great.  Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to the hype:  there was very little steak in the steak tacos. What steak there was, was way over cooked and hard. The tacos had no traditional Mexican flavor at all. There was also this weird crema on them. The plate was complemented with a heavy helping of flavorless Mexican rice, and black beans.  The black beans were the best part of the dish and I would only give them a 3/5.. The other members of our party generally liked their food. The Vietnamese  Summer Rolls had good taste but seems a little dry, and dry, like they  were prepared earlier (days?) and then served.  All,in all, I cringe when my family want o go here.  I'm batting zero out of three or four visits.  I think the Cheese Cake factory may have grown too job fast, or its just this location.  Why is it that the retardants at the casino are mostly fast food and not great food like you get in Vegas.  The casino seems li,e a step down from Vegas for sure, especially the food options."
Julie P.,"Annapolis, MD",4,48,9,4.0,3/16/2017,The food here is yummy and giant.  Three people could split a meal and go home full.  Service is attentive.  My real issue is the disgusting bathroom.  Seriously!  Two stalls with a constant line.  Trash and water all over the floor.  Yuck.
Lauren B.,"Tulsa, OK",0,30,,3.0,9/30/2017,"Our waitress was super nice, but they were very busy, so she seemed like she was overwhelmed. They could definitely use more staff on a Saturday. I ordered the ahi salad... after 40 min of waiting she brought it to me. The ahi was supposed to be rare but seared... they brought it out and it was completely frozen. It almost broke my tooth it was so hard! She took it back to get me a new order-- but then informed me that they keep their ahi in the freezer and that all the ahi was still frozen so I'd have to pick another entree. Didn't even get new entree for free. Just seems weird to have frozen ahi-- I thought ""seared"" meant it would be cooked on the outside at some point."
Vito C.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",1,5,1,1.0,3/14/2017,I wish I could give 0 star worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been all my life small portions and low quality
Neil S.,"Reisterstown, MD",34,102,14,1.0,1/11/2017,"Ten minute wait for a table is okay considering it was a Saturday night. When our buzzer went off the hostess nonchalantly told us to wait until our name was called. A two part seating system, whatever.  The table was a small booth next to louvered windows facing the slot  machines in the casino. The combination of a tight booth, loud casino noise and the view from my table of casino customers spitting on the casino carpet was more than I could stand. The food was really bad. The portions were not prepared correctly. The pasta and chicken dish I ordered was severely lacking chicken and the sauce was overpowering and salty. My wife ordered a steak that was dry and over cooked. The boys entrees were disappointing as well. The waiter while not overly friendly, was highly efficient. He was the only thing about the place that wasn't disappointing. This place is not worth it."
Desarie B.,"Ellicott City, MD",24,8,1,3.0,4/18/2017,"Ate at bar, service was painfully slow. My husband loved his shrimp scampi, my herb crusted salmon was o.k. Bland. I liked the mashed potatoes tho lol"
James R.,"Yuma, AZ",7,43,25,2.0,4/16/2017,"Where to start?  The hostess Station was unusually disorganized. This was not the cleanest restaurant I've ever been in, much less the cleanest Cheesecake Factory. I don't think this place is up to their standard (Granted they were probably slammed by earlier crowds on Easter Sunday). Floor was greasy and could very well result in a customer slipping and falling. We had to ask for new (clean) silverware. My menu had food stuck inside it. Our waitress (Nicole) was the only positive part of our experience. We won't be back to this location."
Erica C.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",61,279,506,3.0,4/28/2015,"Our experience today at the Cheesecake Factory was mediocre. First, the service was extremely slow! Took a while for our waitress to take our order even bring our drinks. And the place wasn't even busy.  We ordered calamari, crab and artichoke dip and pot stickers. Pot stickers were amazing but crab dip tasted disgusting!!! Tasted like tuna smothered in mayonnaise.  Our entrees were just ok. Disappointed that my chicken bellagio was missing 2 components (the procutto and the arugula)."
Lisa O.,"Baltimore, MD",166,211,148,2.0,6/26/2016,"The food here is always good. It's the same food you find at every Cheesecake Factory. So they have consistency going for them. However, the service is almost always poor. It often takes 15-20 minutes to get a drink after sitting down. I won't even go into how hard it is to get a refill. Having more than 1 basket of bread is apparently a burden. We always ask for another and sometimes never receive one after asking multiple times. Today, we had to ask our waiter several times to even get silverware and napkins. I'm sure there are at least a few good servers here, but we are never seated in their section. While we leave full, we do not leave happy."
Shane W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,3,3,1.0,7/30/2017,"The worst dinning experience I've ever had. I've dined in multiple countries and this by far was like eating at an establishment run by inexperienced monkeys. Waited 1 hour and 10 minutes and received nothing, not even silverware. The manager was not concerned with his staff's lack of customer service. I will be writing the corporate office after this review. Today is July 20, 2017 and we arrived at 6pm and finally walked out at 7:20p after not receiving anything !!!! Poor service. I will never dine here even if the food was free !!!!!!!"
Lauren C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",88,118,211,2.0,11/9/2015,"There are plenty of dinner options in this mall. We went to the Cheesecake Factory because we were on the casino side and knew they have a great reputation for a sit down restaurant.  This location does not hold itself to the same standard. The service is slow.  Our server was seen many times around the restaurant but it was really difficult to get him to come by our table.   One of the entrees we ordered was the falafel salad and it was very disappointing.   The falafel was dry and there were not enough toppings on the salad for the amount of greens.  We were hoping to signal our server so we could exchange it for something else, but I ended up just sharing my sisters dish.  By the time he came over, we did not want to wait for another to entree to be prepared.   Dessert was another disappointment. We wanted to order a slice of cheesecake. We told the server we needed a minute to decide.  He never came back. Again, we saw him but not by our table.  By the time he came we just asked for the check.  He never apologized for the delay.  We even did a playful ""We thought you forgot about us!"" - no response. Then he had another server leave our check on the table - no ""Thank you for coming in."" or anything.  They need to step up their game."
Samasama P.,"Maryland City, MD",4,7,13,2.0,4/2/2017,"Only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because the server was great. Other than that I would've gave them 1 star. Anyway as appetizers we ordered mac and cheese balls and chicken nachos . The mac and cheese balls were greasy and nasty. The nachos had a long piece of hair in it. I ordered the orange chicken and my best friend had pasta she said the pasta was ""alright"". My orange chicken was ice ice cold ! Unacceptable ! The managers comes over and I explained and he gives me a snobby remark saying ""well what do you want me to do"" umm excuse me ? Not happy !"
