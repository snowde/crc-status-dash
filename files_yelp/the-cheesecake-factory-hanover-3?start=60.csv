Natasha F.,"Fairfax, VA",112,10,1,1.0,4/1/2017,Bad service today. Took forever for food. First time going into this location. The hostess was awful and smelles like smoke. Proper handling of food of wait staff was a no go. Just unsettling. I'll stick to the one in Fairoaks and Tyson's
De'Leisa N.,"Washington, DC",128,233,24,2.0,7/9/2016,"So, everyone knows that the Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu. We stopped in for lunch and I just knew I wanted to get the BBQ Bacon burger I fell in love with many moons ago before BBP popped up next door. Well, the burger was charred to a crisp and the bacon was so well done it was inedible. The app samosas were good...great curry chicken mixture but for 4 small triangles not worth it. I also ended with Linda's chocolate cake. Now, I know the public has said the portions were huge but at least I could snack on it for days. Well they got the message and cut back. We got the most slim slice of cake ever and it wasn't even that great. Maybe my tastebuds have evolved but Cheesecake Factory doesn't do it for me anymore."
MamaBear B.,"Washington, DC",3,5,,2.0,7/22/2016,The waitress was great but I have the worst stomach ache and case of diarrhea. I barely made it to the Walmart outside of the parking lot to use the bathrooms I went twice and then I gladly made it home and I haven't stopped running to the bathroom. For a place that is so busy the food looked great but something was wrong with it because I'm sick now. I just left 2hours ago. This is sad. Unless you want food poisoning don't eat there.
Sarah D.,"White Plains, MD",23,15,3,1.0,8/12/2017,"I have to say after reading all of the reviews, I had pretty low expectations for this Cheesecake Factory. I had even lower expectations with it being sat night (8/12) at almost 11pm. We walked in to a group asking how much longer because they were given incorrect expectations to start. 4 people stood behind the counter. One was a sever the other a hostess. Another hostess and what looked like a manager (female Caucasian) addressing the concern of the group in front of us. We stood there for a solid 10 minutes with no one acknowledging us. After the group left, the employees started to talk very rude about the customers that just left. None of them looked at us and we were standing right in front of them. Another couple walked in and asked if we were waiting.. after standing for a minute we decided to leave. I've been to several Cheesecakes and have never had this type of experience. It's definitely not the establishment it's those people. I'd fire them a week ago."
Corey W.,"Glen Burnie, MD",74,6,,2.0,4/23/2017,It's serviceable food at best. The brunch use to be good but the portions and flavor have went down while the prices have stayed the same. Will not return.
Sam E.,"Laurel, MD",1,25,,5.0,8/30/2017,Went here for my birthday with the wife and kids. We all were able to find something we liked off the menu. The kids got pizza and my wife and I shared two entrees. The main feature of course was the cheesecake. Can't go wrong with the Cheescake Factory.
Amayi G.,"Glen Burnie, MD",36,42,126,2.0,3/18/2017,"This is MY experience only. My fiance , daughter and I went out for dinner on a Friday night. Their meals we're awesome and both we're pleased me on the other hand not so much. First had a little wait time for our seats which was fine because it was packed. What didn't make sense is to ring our buzzer and have us wait at the hostess counter for an additional 10-15 mins while other guests are being buzzed after us and seated. Finally seated and was given waters & bread. I started to drink from my water when I spotted something green floating in the water. Looked like chopped spinach/lettuce/garnish whatever is green. Either way I was grossed out def wanted to leave but my fince convinced me stay so I did but was very paranoid after. I asked for another water ordered bang bang chicken and Arnold Palmer. Recieved my order pretty fast water didn't touch it kept thinking there was a piece of residue food floating around in it. Bang Bang chicken looked ok sauce was a little crusty had that film over it like when you leave gravy out to long uncovered and has that film over the top. I had the brown rice which was under cooked still mushy and clumpy so just ate the chicken. The ""Arnold Palmer"" was the worst how they managed to have the (unsweetened)iced tea sit at the bottom and lemonade on top is beyond me. It was like oil and water it wouldn't mix lol. I was already done at the dirty cup so the meal and drink was icing on the cake. NOPE!  here's a cherry in form of a strawberry shortcake I ordered. Should've known with a place named cheesecake factory why order anything else. We'll I did and regretted it. Took mines to go because I was ready to go. I should've left it. It  tasted as bad as it looked boxed. I won't be returning here. Maybe others are good but this one lives up to it's 3 star rep."
Susanna M.,"Hanover, MD",0,9,21,1.0,5/8/2016,Ordered firecracker salmon rolls to go. Picked up my order. Drove home. Opened my bag and saw THIS! So unacceptable. Don't provide carry out if you have to lower your food standards!
Jennifer G.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,19,11,2.0,2/24/2017,"First time ever. Me and the family thought we would give it a shot. First off customer service is everything in a business so when I walk in and ask to be placed on the wait list I didn't expect the hostess to look at me like I was bothering her. Our waitress, we saw her 3-4 times total. Drink order, order, ask if we want desert and check. Needless to say she was MIA the rest of the visit. The food wasn't anything to brag about either. Menu is huge from Thai to burgers to tacos. I'll just get a piece of cheese cake to go next time and bypass the rest all together. Very disappointed"
Lisa S.,"Yorktown, VA",95,1,,1.0,6/25/2016,"STAY AWAY!!!   Food is not being prepared correctly, ordered the avocado toast and instead somebody put the guacamole with jalapeño peppers on the toast instead of fresh avocado and lemon.  Mouth was on fire and could not eat.  Gnats hung out at the table, and also had a ROACH running around the booth!  Very bad experience, but good waitress.    I will never spend money there again!!! Update:  Cheesecake Factory contacted me on here/yelp to tell me they were sorry to hear about my experience and to contact them via the website.  The sad thing about their public relations is that I  did exactly that BEFORE I posted this review, and still have not heard a single thing from them to this day!  I even responded to their reply telling them I had filled out the info and sent to their site, and never got a reply back... what was the purpose of contacting me?  Telling someone you're sorry about an experience is one thing, however, acting on it is another!"
Glenn P.,"Morgantown, WV",1,8,,3.0,8/12/2017,Don't pick up your order when they say it should be ready. This is twice now that I have waited an additional 30 minutes. I don't know why they do this. I had enough to do than wait in a lobby until they were good and ready to bring my order out. But the food was good.
Jesse C.,"Austin, TX",0,22,1,1.0,4/4/2017,Stupidest rudest hostess greeted me and parents like she was doing us a favor. Obviously personnel here are not trained to give a customer service for Cheesecake Factory I am used to in other cities. Apparently she feels so entitled to not even recognize a celebrity. Fuck this place! Never here again
Danielle M.,"Edgewood, MD",128,123,300,3.0,1/6/2016,Sooo this was a weird experience. Lunch with my besties is always a great thing.. Lunching when you are on  hardcore diet.. Not do great. So of course I was mindful of what I ordered .. No shrimp scampi for me  :-*{. So I ordered Chicken samosas and a Tortilla salad from the skinnylicious menu . The samosas were good and flavorful. I would certainly order them again. The salad was meh.. Now I didn't expect it to be like a Chipotle salad.. But it was just rather bland . The grilled chicken for example was not flavorful at all.. And I think when you cut back on high calorie items you have to amp up the flavor.. Marinades work wonders! But it was nice to be out with friends eating actual food and not sucking on green swamp juice was nice.. I just won't order a salad (as my entree$ from there again!
Gregory H.,"Millersville, MD",455,16,56,4.0,5/26/2016,"These a big menu with lots of different choices and they bring you a good amount of food on a large plate. And their Strawberry-Lemonade, do your self a favor by ordering it. You can tell that the food is made to order with fresh ingredients. A all around great experience."
Kenneth Patrick J.,"Reston, VA",254,241,164,3.0,11/21/2016,At the casino - pretty typical Cheesecake Factory offering. A step above fast food with an enormous menu!
Layaka N.,"Fort Meade, MD",31,2,,1.0,6/22/2016,"This past Saturday, June 18, I went to have a late dinner with a friend around 10:30pm.  We were seated in the rear of the restaurant and the walk to our table was almost as tedious as walking a tightrope, I imagine.  The floor had a greasy sheen and I was nervous that each step was going to end in an embarrassing fall.  We made it to our seats and ordered two appetizers, two cocktails and a beer... all of which were fine.   After paying for dinner, I decided to carefully 'ice skate' my way to the restroom prior to leaving.  This is where things became the stuff of nightmares! I entered the empty restroom and opened the door to the first stall and immediately almost hurled at the sight! The toilet was full to the brim with bloody toilet paper and a tampon.  There was also used tampon on the floor in what appeared to be urine. The seat had blood all over it. I quickly moved to the next stall and to my surprise it was more sickening!  There was vomit all over the floor and toilet seat.  The toilet was filled with vomit!  I actually panicked because I'd left my inhaler at the table and the sigh of all of this caused me to lose my breath as if I was having asthma attack.  I immediately left the restroom and grabbed the first employee that I saw and described the whole horrible scene in the restroom.  I asked him to notify a manager immediately.  Then I attempted to make my way to the table so that I could get a couple of puffs off my inhaler.   However,  I forgot that the floor was as slippery as the lanes at a bowling alley and I nearly lost my footing trying to get back to the table.  I turn and ask the manager if there was something spilled on the floor and to my surprise he casually stated, ""They are always like this"".  Then he asked whether or not I had fallen and I said, ""not yet"".  He said, ""good"".  I cautiously glided back to my date and we immediately walk the tightrope to the exit.  Thankfully, we made it out...alive! I actually have to say that I didn't think this was typical of the Cheesecake Factory 'experience', but I have to say that I think this particular location has a few issues. After sharing my story with my daughter, she told me that she slipped, but did not fall at this same location, two weeks ago.  She stated that her friend had gone to the ladies restroom and one stall was 'disgusting' and thev other was out of toilet paper.  Recounting the story to co-workers about this location and heard at least a couple similar stories about the restroom or greasy floors.   The manager's lackadaisical attitude was annoying.  Had I entered that restroom and witnessed the horror prior to eating,  I would've immediately left!  Instead I had to deal with almost unbearable nausea after dinner whenever I pictured the disgusting scene :(  So disappointing."
Robert P.,"Columbia, MD",0,38,167,4.0,9/18/2016,Went there on a Friday evening got seated right away on the patio. Service was great and the seating outside was very comfortable. I got the fish and chips which was good but I felt like it could have had a little more flavor all and all it was a very good experience.
Charlie K.,"Chicago, IL",32,226,89,4.0,12/4/2015,"Came to the Cheesecake Factory for a team dinner at the Casino in Arundel. Cheesecake is usually a safe bet, as I've been to the locations in Chicago on several occasions. We started with orders of the buffalo blasts, cheese sticks, and chicken pot stickers. I wasn't a big fan of the buffalo blasts, as they were deep fried with too much dough and very little filling. The other apps were good, but only 6 of each served. I ordered the miso glazed salmon with brown rice as my entree and it was cooked to perfection. The sauce was also mild and complemented the salmon very well. We will certainly be back in a couple weeks when we're back in the area. Best, Charlie"
Cecilia J.,"Washington, DC",100,52,15,5.0,11/16/2016,Great place to eat. Pleasant atmosphere. The menu has so many items on it that it takes time to make a decision - many delicious choices. The strawberry lemonade is the best I've had. The fish tacos come in grilled or tempura. I chose tempura-delicious!!! The portions of food are large so there is almost always food left to take home.
Jimmy J.,"Odenton, MD",7,2,,4.0,3/27/2017,"The wife loves this place!!  we sat in the bar area, drafty from the outside doors, but food and service were great! see you next Month!"
