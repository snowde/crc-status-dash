Vanessa S.,"Joint Base Andrews, MD",0,10,5,4.0,1/21/2017,"Quick service and food was great! I server was very nice and helpful. The menu is very big, but I like that you can order the lunch special and it really is still a lot of food. Everyone had to take at least half to go. If you can't take food home I would definitely recommend splitting a meal."
J R.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,1.0,8/7/2017,"Service in the dining room was absolutely terrible. Took my daughter there to celebrate her 9th birthday and by the end of the extremely poor dining experience, we decided to not stick around for the staff to come around with the birthday song. Ended up grabbing cheesecake to go and ate it at home.  Will never eat here again."
Kim A.,"Silver Spring, MD",146,393,26,3.0,4/11/2016,Update !!! Better service on a Sunday: come an hour before closing . Food is good less people . I've ordered the tamale corn cake it was good! The food here is very good. Cheesecake good !
Molisa T.,"Hanover, MD",0,7,,1.0,7/17/2016,"Terrible phone service. Called twice and nobody EVER picked up. The zecond time I called, I called to let them know I was on hold for an extremely long time, and she placed me on another LONG HOLD! I called to speak to their manager and the person answering keeps clicking the hold option. Terrible customer service! People that want to place orders over the phone should not be penalized! Somebody should always be on phone duty and if it is busy, then turns need to be taken. However, the phone should ALWAYS be managed! ALWAYS! Due to your terrible services, I am taking my business elsewhere, and telling people I know not to visit this location. EVER."
Conni R.,"Arlington, TX",103,8,,1.0,11/6/2016,"bad service, bad food....stay away..... terrible waited 40 min for meal and it was not good asked for dressing on side of salad  and it was drenched. salad tasted like dead fish.   waiter did not check back on us never got fresh bread  just a terrible experience for meals with high prices."
Kim H.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",0,10,,5.0,10/21/2016,Hands down the BEST service I've had at Cheesecake! Ask for Zach B. he is unbelievable ... his personality and charm added to the delicious meal we had. I had Tuscan Chicken off the Skinny menu and my husband had the cheeseburger ... Both meals were great!  Would definitely come back!
Vy B.,"Smyrna, GA",7,40,4,1.0,12/7/2016,"First off, I called for take out and was told it would be 20 mins...40 mins later, my food was just coming out. Secondly, I requested extra wheat bread but they didn't include it. Third, my rice was undercooked (chewy), while my salmon (miso salmon) was overcooked as it was charred on the top. By charred, I mean black! Fourth, my husband ordered the Steak Diane and it came with 4 tiny pieces of steak. Seriously? Did I just pay $20 for a steak that looked like it was left over from someone else's meal? This is unacceptable!!"
Adam M.,"Washington, DC",47,34,14,2.0,8/8/2016,"Food was amazing as always! Cheesecake was amazing as always, ambiance was typical cheesecake (very good but loud)  Service was the WORST I have EVER had at any Cheesecake Factory... Restaurant was half full on a Monday evening at 8 when we got here... 920 by the time we got to order Cheesecake... The waiter came to the table once for drink orders, when he finally came back with drinks we ordered food... Then we stopped him after we had finished eating to order cheesecake. That's all the contact we had over an hour and a half. Had better service at ""dicks last resort"".  Again food was great, cheesecake was great, ambiance was great, service was horrible."
Khoi N.,"Silver Spring, MD",241,257,644,5.0,5/8/2016,"I've eaten here many times. This place has always had great service whether your dining for lunch or late in the evenings. You can never go wrong with their cheesecakes. I would recommend if your plan on taking a cake home give yourself 30-60 minutes for them to get it prepared. I came here for lunch the other day. We ordered the Kobe style burger, garlic parmesan bread and the Cajun Jambalaya pasta. The Kobe burger wasn't actually the Kobe beef, but just seasoned with mushrooms and onions. Nothing really special here. Our garlic parmesan bread as an appetizer was delicious. You get the tough crust of the ciabatta bread but the soft interior with the melted cheese and their special seasoning. Delicious I'm not sure why I never ordered it before and why a lot of people don't comment on it. The Jambalaya was amazing. You get large shrimp with tender chicken and plenty of roasted pepper. Its advertised as very spicy but I'd give this a 1/5 on the heat scale. Very large portion and expect a to go bag. If your really hungry and want large portions this is the spot."
J. Michelle A.,"Baltimore, MD",51,59,12,2.0,10/21/2016,This place has really gone down in service and food.  We had 14 people in our party and at least 5 of us returned our food because it was horrible.  Our waiter was too occupied in chatting with the male customers at other tables than giving us good service.  He hardly came to our table to refill our water or drinks.  We had to literally get up to get him.  Then he seemed to have had an attitude with us.  Won't be back to this one ever again
Meg T.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,14,,1.0,1/29/2017,"This location is the worst. The staff is rude. Others got their food way before me who had arrived later. The waiter was very dismissive and wasn't helpful towards us. The food is great, otherwise this would have been a complete waste of my time. Maybe being in a casino makes the service terrible. I will not be coming back."
Stan J.,"Henderson, NV",0,58,43,1.0,4/17/2015,1st time visiting here and we are big Cheesecake Factory fans from where we live near Vegas. This one is just not up to standards. The low carb cheesecake with strawberries was embarrassing. Literally ONE strawberry cut into 6 tiny pieces. Waiter went back to the kitchen and staff told him it's supposed to be that way! Manager came over and admitted it was embarrassing and brought some extra berries. Shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get it right......
Ishita V.,"Reston, VA",32,112,334,5.0,7/21/2014,"Believe me, I'm the biggest cheesecake lover you can find lol. I always always have either the red velvet cheesecake or the original one. They are my favorites! I get scared to try anything new lol. But I tried the mango key lime cheesecake today.  And I wasn't satisfied :( it firstly has the coconut macaroon crust which I don't prefer. Graham cracker is the best you can have in cheesecake. Secondly the mixture of lime and mango didn't go well with me. It isn't that bad but it's not great either!  My friends called for Kahlua coffee and the lemon and raspberry one. If you like coffee in desserts you'll love the Kahlua one. I personally don't prefer coffee in my desserts so that's not for me! Lemon and raspberry was good, but too lemony for my tongue. Original and red velvet for the win!  But of course I love Cheesecake Factory :D"
Patricia R.,"Mechanicsville, VA",53,10,1,1.0,11/23/2016,"Absolutely horrific service. Took 10 minutes for someone to bring a high chair to our table and another 5 minutes for our waitress to come to the table just to take our drink order. It was a really slow time, 4:45 the Tuesday before thanksgiving for dinner. Kitchen was horribly slow as well. Our waitress was super nice and friendly but management here needs to figure out how to improve on a lot of areas. Considering its newer and next to casino, I was horribly disappointed. I'll never be back. This one puts Cheesecake Factory to shame."
Allen P.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2017,"This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I have seen - and I have seen plenty.  The service tonight is terrible - way too slow, dirty dishes left at the table, wet slick nasty floor, and lots of dirty dishes."
Meik C.,"Florence, SC",0,22,20,1.0,12/28/2016,"The service was horrible. Brianna was our server. Dishes collected on our table. We had to pile them up to make room for food that was delivered. Not only did the lady who brought our food not remove these dishes, but our server didn't remove them either. Even when we asked her to do so.  The Cuban egg rolls were good. The rest of what we ordered was mediocre. The Jamaican chicken and shrimp was disappointing and the shrimp were over cooked."
Pooja H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,4,,3.0,6/30/2017,This place has too many dishes in the menu! And they do have limited options for vegetarians. The place is too crowded due to casino.
Gray M.,"Rockville, MD",29,81,82,1.0,10/19/2016,NO HAPPY HOUR because of the casino. NO RESERVATIONS or call ahead seating. We left to go to the Columbia location.
Kenny W.,"Silver Spring, MD",111,166,580,3.0,3/20/2016,"First time in my experience of eating at Cheesecake Factory that I had to share: The garlic bread appetizer marinara sauce came to our table cold. The quality of the Calamari appetizer did not meet my expectations.  Asked for more brown bread but never received.  The ""Garlic"" Noodles seems to be more Parmesan sauce (kinda watery) than Garlic. Came here on a Saturday night around 11 PM. The service was pretty good though seemed slow."
Anne A.,"Baltimore, MD",7,36,42,2.0,2/22/2016,"[TL;DR] Food quality was OK, but an unfriendly and inattentive hostess made us wait 10-15 minutes to be seated during a nearly empty night. If you're expecting typical Cheesecake Factory service, this is not the place. Since we were in the area to shop and my friend and I had free vouchers for cheesecake slices, we decided to stop by here for dinner. It was in the middle of the week, so nearly all of the available seating was vacant. When we approached the hostess desk, she never greeted us or looked up from whatever she was doing. She took down a name and told us that someone will be with us shortly. 10-15 minutes later, our server came over to seat us. We commented that we had to wait to be seated, even though the restaurant was nearly empty. Our server was confused, saying that there shouldn't have been a wait at all, and that the hostess should've seated everyone right away instead of making everyone wait. She apologized and took down our orders since we were ready and hungry. Everything after that was uneventful. Our server was attentive and friendly, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. It was typical CCF quality, and the free cheesecakes were delicious."
