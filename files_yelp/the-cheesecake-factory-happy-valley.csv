Teresa N.,"Vancouver, WA",426,84,177,4.0,1/10/2018,"Honestly, based on all of the BAD reviews that I read upon coming... I didn't expect a whole lot. My standards weren't very high. Also, I thought the food probably wasn't going to be that great because it's a restaurant chain. Usually, I try to stay away from big food chains because the quality or flavor isn't usually that great. To my dismay, I was quite happily surprised.  My boyfriend's parents got us gift cards to this place so we wanted to put it to good use. When we first walked in, it took a few mins to get greeted by anyone. But it didn't take long for us to be acknowledged and seated right away. It wasn't very busy. The servers are friendly and provide great service. Everyone we encountered were very prompt and attentive. We appreciated that very much. The ambiance is delightful. Romantic, dim lighting, and the noise wasn't too loud.  I always do my research before going anywhere new. I checked out the menu to see if they had offered Vegan options. They literally have a MENU BOOK! Lots & lots to choose from. It was a little overwhelming at first.  They have something for everyone whether you're vegan, gluten intolerant, pescatarian, love your steak, chicken, pork, etc. Everything sounded delicious! It was hard to choose, but we managed to narrow it down to the Avocado Egg rolls, Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and the Diane steak & Crusted Herb Salmon Combo. We were blown away by how good tasty everything was. We finished our plates lol.  The flavors were on point! The food came out at a very timely manner as well. Huge plus! Can't wait to go back!"
Super Saver Special 2.,"Portland, OR",0,7,,1.0,1/1/2018,HORRIBLE FOOD!! Stay away from the food just stick with the cocktails and cheesecake you'll be Ok Maybe a salad on a good day but that's it !! To Bad one location can be so different than the other there just winging it over there in Clackamas Sad!!
Katrina T.,"Vancouver, WA",16,38,9,1.0,12/30/2017,"So unhappy!  First, we waited two hours.  We were told 1 to 1 1/2.  Okay, I get that.  Can't push people out the door..  but we were told multiple times that there were two people in front of us or that a table was being cleaned for us..  anyway, finally got seated. Ordered drinks, then ordered food.  Waited about 10 minutes while noticing that the table next to ours (seated AFTER us) was eating bread..  from previous visits to other locations, we knew we normally got bread.  Had to ask the server then she explained it was baking.  Okay, we'll wait... Got our food..  husband ordered steak tacos without cilantro.  Menu said they came with tomatoes, avocado, rice and crispy onions.  His had only steak and some crispy onions, some marinated onions.  The rice that was served with it was green (cilantro rice, not mentioned in the menu).  To top it all off, everyone's food was cold, especially my husband's! Asked for a manager and when he finally got to our table several minutes later, he was apologetic and explained that what actually comes on the tacos is PICO DE GALLO and GUACAMOLE, both of which have cilantro in them.  He also told us about the CILANTRO rice.  He did get a new meal made for my husband, but it took at least another 20 minutes to get it, after the rest of the table was completely finished.  AND.. the fries were cold! I get that this place just recently opened.  Obviously lots of kinks to work out.  But we ended up being there, between waiting to get seated, waiting for our cold food (first round) and cold food again, it was close to four hours and almost 11 pm!  Manager did not come back to check on my husband's replacement meal.  He did comp my husband food, but nothing else.  I feel like we should have at least been offered dessert!   We won't be back for quite awhile!"
Heidi H.,"Gresham, OR",120,78,521,4.0,12/19/2017,"I'm caught between a 3-4 for this rating. The reason I bumped it to a 4 is because I know the restaurant just recently opened and they are still trying to iron out all the kinks. It took way too long for bread & drinks to arrive. The bar was backed up. Our server, Mark, was excellent! Below is a rating on our food items on a 1-5 scale with 5 being the best. Chicken Madeira: 4, only because it wasn't piping hot when it arrived. Seemed like it had sat waiting for other dishes. Asparagus was slightly over cooked too. Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: 5, Rich & Creamy Orange Chicken: 5, Delicious! Chicken Romano: 3, slightly cold & hardly any sauce  Thai Coconut Chicken: 3, flavor was good, but way too spicy and menu said nothing about ""heat"" for this dish. We will be back, but will likely wait a month until things are running more smoothly."
Mark S.,"Portland, OR",67,192,3094,5.0,12/15/2017,"Hot and Happening! This place is jumpin' ... so hurry on by for the:  Food, the Cheesecake, the Vibe, the Service, the Portions OMG! More Cheesecake? Cheesecake Factory is an excellent addition for ye olde Clackamas Mall-Landia.   The buzz is real, and it's real, cause they're doing it well.  The Cheesecake crew is numerous, it's moves fast. Endless menus...  I've never seen so many people ordering up cheesecake in my life! Which one should I have? That IS the question... After your food? ... you can have a mall experience! Tip: This place is busy, plan your arrival time, if you don't wanna wait."
Tina C.,"Portland, OR",75,26,2,3.0,1/9/2018,"I am giving three stars based upon my previous experiences with the Cheesecake Factory.  Their food is generally very good.  Portion sizes are pretty big, on this particular occasion I was hoping for the beet and goat cheese salad.  With the grilled artichoke as my second option.....  much to my dismay they didn't have any beets which also eliminated two other dishes I was considering and the artichoke was out of season (can fault them for that).  However when you have at least three menu options that include beets you should Make sure that you have them on hand.  Their menu is extensive but in Jan I like most others are watching calories or at least making healthier choices when possible, so their fried options which were aplenty just weren't on my list of ""can eat"".  This is a new restaurant to the area but a chain where these things should all be ironed out already."
Valerie A.,"Portland, OR",64,72,259,2.0,1/6/2018,"I wish I could post some glowing review with photos but we were given a 3  hour wait for our group of 10 on a Thursday night. Cheesecake Factory will not accept reservations. We sent someone in an hour early to hold our spot and 1/2 way through our 3 hour wait we changed our request from 10 folks to 8 and the manager told us it makes no difference because this location is smaller than Washington square and only has 3 ""larger"" tables. Parties of 2 are the ideal customer for this locational they were being told only a 20 minute wait. Cheesecake Factory will not combine 3 small tables for 2 in order to create a space for 8."
Chris G.,"Portland, OR",71,104,75,5.0,12/6/2017,So happy that this location opened up as it us much closer than the Beaverton one.  We went here for dinner yesterday and the food was amazing as usual. The menu is like the Torah but that's a good thing because everything on it is AWESOME. You can get pretty much whatever you're in the mood for. The only downside is going to be my bank account after how many times I come here.
Diana T.,"Portland, OR",12,46,17,1.0,1/8/2018,"Do yourself a favor and just drive to the Wash Square location, this place was terrible. Food was the worst that I've ever tasted and I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times at Washington square and others out of state. On top of it, I passed along feedback to manager and he could care less."
Josh N.,"McMinnville, OR",85,57,22,5.0,12/29/2017,"My servers name was Alex. He was super fast, kept checking the table to make sure everything was good, my drink was NEVER empty. Was there at 3:45ish. I ordered the Louisiana pasta and red velvet cheesecake, passion fruit mojoto and an amazing margarita! Alex is cute and great! I want him as a server again!"
Kelly K.,"Portland, OR",47,101,123,5.0,12/6/2017,"Had lunch here with a friend. We have been waiting for this place to open for months.  Food was fantastic and service was great. Great lunch specials that have huge portions. Great menu, something for everyone. Definitely gonna be regulars here!"
Sharmaine C.,"Portland, OR",74,9,55,5.0,12/6/2017,So happy about this location opening up! I had the honor of being invited to pre-opening night & it was such a great experience amazing food as I wouldn't expect anything else from Cheesecake along with the outstanding service.
Kayla T.,"Corvallis, OR",1,18,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Waited 40 minutes to be seated and then a meal for two took 2 hours. As I write this review I'm watching my cheesecake sit on the counter where it has sat for 10 minutes while people walk by, look at it, and breath on it. The worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. The famous food and cheesecake doesn't make up for the absolutely horrible and long service. Will not come back here."
Kim And Bill R.,"Clackamas, OR",1,7,,1.0,1/3/2018,"I have to say it's one of the worst meals my wife and I have had. She ordered a pasta dish that sat under warning light way to long. The sauce was burnt, noodles dried out, and oil puddled at the bottom of the bowl. I ordered the grilled chicken/avocado/ bacon  sandwich. They brushed it with oil/butter and soaked the bottom layer of bread. It was a big greasy mess. It was bad. Not worth the wait time or money."
C P.,"Portland, OR",0,2,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"We love going to the Washington square location. They always give realistic time expectations and food is always great. I know the Clackamas location is fairly new...but I've not been impressed...We ordered two pasta dishes over the phone. Went to pick it up 25 minutes later as the person taking our order suggested this timeframe. The girls in the to-go area told my boyfriend they were just waiting on the pasta. Pasta is literally all that was ordered. After my boyfriend had been waiting AN HOUR AFTER THE ORDER WAS PLACED, he checked in again and they said they were still waiting on the kids marinara pasta plate...they FINALLY gave him our order an hour and 15 minutes after the order was placed..this is the kids pasta dish that took them an hour and 15 minutes to make.."
Jeannie D.,"Vancouver, WA",0,42,4,5.0,1/3/2018,"Not sure how you could go wrong with all the options here! Everything that was brought to our table was delicious. Plenty of gluten free options! If you're lucky you'll get Jaylynn for your server, she was amazing & absolutely made our night."
Jasmine M.,"Happy Valley, OR",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2017,Do not go here if you want a good nachos!! Burned my first serving after waiting a half hour and sent it back waited another half hour and came back the same! First time I've ever been and the last. Horrible nachos! Just awful
Elizabeth A.,"Portland, OR",85,14,3,1.0,12/18/2017,"Ordered on Grubhub. Order came stone cold, burger was literally burnt and had a thick layer of salt on top, didn't come as described. Hardly worth the expensive prices."
Kyle M.,"Vancouver, WA",1,12,3,4.0,1/7/2018,"Had a really good experience! Took my gal out for a late lunch. We were sat immediately. I had the steak Diane which was amazing! Definitely recommend it. My gal had the New York steak. Great flavor, but I have to knock off a star because she wanted it cooked medium rare and it arrived medium well. It was also a very thinly cut steak. Overall, we were both pleased and will definitely be back. Glad they opened at this location!"
Katie W.,"Portland, OR",127,15,2,5.0,12/31/2017,"Went here on a Friday night and of course packed (plus it opened a couple weeks ago) but totally worth the wait! Their menu has a variety of dishes for meat eaters to vegan. My fiancé and I tried four cheese pasta, guacamole avocado salad, cauliflower honey bbq appetizer and pot sticker appetizer. All amazing especially the cauliflower appetizer. The cheesecake was lemon raspberry. Everything was awesome! Will go back! Plus when they seat you, you receive bread. :)"
Sheila A.,"Vancouver, WA",0,3,,3.0,12/15/2017,"Tried this restaurant last Saturday  Got right in and help was bountiful  We ordered appetizers and they were good Husband got Shepherds Pie and I ordered lemon chicken  I got 3 pieces of chicken and not all 3 pieces were completely done (yuck) We never were offered refills on our very expensive ice teas But, we would go here again as they are brand new and I am sure this was just a one time mistake plus I really did not need 3 pieces of chicken anyway Did not get dessert this trip"
Jc E.,"Boise, ID",1,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,Had the worst service. Server monica came and took my order. Always good tell I waited 15 to 20 minutes. No drink water no customer service. Got up and left table 11 Sunday
John K.,"Orchards Area Concerned Citizens, Brush Prairie, WA",264,1,,2.0,12/27/2017,Very disappointing. Service was good and helpful but I came here for the Tuna Tartare appetizer (during lunch and it wasn't even packed) and they ran out of it. I drove out here from Vancouver just to eat here and mainly for that dish and was let down. I'm not sure if I'll come back here again. The food here to me is mediocre.
Carissa M.,"Happy Valley, OR",201,10,,4.0,12/28/2017,Good food and better desert! Service is a bit slow usually but the servers are always nice.
C H.,"Portland, OR",0,5,,3.0,12/27/2017,Probably i was too expected of foods? Cheese cakes are absolutely good but I got lunch time spaghetti and pizza Horrible taste... especially spaghetti was really bad
Alyssa F.,"Clackamas, OR",0,39,1,2.0,1/5/2018,"As a HUGE Cheesecake Factory fan, I was extremely disappointed with our first experience here last week. We had a larger party (13) but called ahead (at 1pm) and went early to check in at 2:15. We were told we had to speak to a manager due to our parties size... then we were told about a 1-2 hour wait (which is a large time slot window but we were ok waiting a bit). At 4:45 (2 1/2 hours later) we were finally seated. It went from bad to worse. Service was ok, didn't seem to hurry to get us ordered or bring anything. We waited for bread, waited even longer for drinks and then apps. Our drinks were empty and all apps/bread gone LONG before our food finally arrived. We finally got out of there at 6:45 (2 HOURS after sitting down) and didn't even want to eat dessert. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and was told a manager would have to add it to our bill because they'd totaled it already. Very weird. I would not recommend this location because the management/service/wait time. Also the food was smaller portioned than past cheesecake experiences. Maybe once they get better service/management or have been there some time I might try it again. Not worth the time commitment!"
Angie G.,"Damascus, OR",7,49,34,5.0,12/9/2017,Great service! Great food! Our waiter was super nice and friendly. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. Got my usual the baja chicken tacos and they were great as usual. The white chocolate peppermint bark Cheesecake!!! Yum!!
Ellie M.,"Clackamas, OR",12,20,22,1.0,12/21/2017,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. My roommate and I live about 5 minutes drive away from this location and placed a delivery order through Grubhub at 11:45 am today. She received a message from The Cheesecake factory at 12:30pm saying the food wouldn't arrive till 1pm and they were throwing in some free food for taking so long. The food arrived at 1:03 pm and it was just my salad. A cold salad with nothing but lettuce, chopped veggies, some cheese and dressing. She ordered several appetizer items. She called both Grubhub and Cheesecake factory to complain Grubhub was wonderful and gave her a full refund. What was the Cheesecake factorys response? "" oh well we ran out so that's why we didn't send the rest of your order."" A direct quote. Why wouldn't they send another message like they did before saying they were out of her items? Where is the "" free"" stuff that was supposedly coming with the food? Why did it take over an hour to send out a cold salad if they ran out of her items? By the way my salad was disgusting and had several pieces of dark brown salad going bad. You suck cheesecake factory and I hope you go out of business."
Bob D.,"Portland, OR",0,5,1,5.0,12/30/2017,I had ordered take out and received the wrong thing. Contacted the manager Eddie and he was amazing to work with and compensated me for the mess up . Was very easy going to work with and will 100% be going back due to this great experience.  Thank you Eddie !
Sara S.,"Newberg, OR",42,3,,1.0,12/30/2017,My family of five tried your new establishment today for lunch. We were quoted a 50 minute wait time & chose to do so. We were seated within that time. We ordered our food & our 3 kids food. Theirs arrived in under 20 minutes (Mac & cheese) but ours took over 30 minutes and our kids were completely finished by then. We ordered the Chicken & Waffles Benedict and the Fish Tacos. The syrup that came with the waffles was straight oil. We waited for some normal syrup. The hollandaise sauce was disgusting & inedible! The manager removed it from our bill. When we ordered the Fish Tacos we specifically asked if they had cabbage or lettuce on them. It was not an ingredient in the description but common. Our waiter said no. They arrived with red cabbage. I removed it but along with it came most of the sauce & avocado. The fish was soggy (maybe thawed too quickly) & tasteless. They were not good & I have been burping fish all afternoon. I DO NOT recommend eating at this location until their wait staff had been properly trained on the menu and their kitchen staff can figure out how to decently fry fish & anticipate the amount of customers. The wait was way too long for a seat & way too long for food & very disappointing once it arrived. Our waiter was friendly & apologetic but for their prices I want good food!
Monica W.,"Estacada, OR",74,1,,2.0,12/26/2017,"I've always liked this restaurant, but once the one in clackamas opened up I got a shrimp pasta, unfortunately the shrimp still had that translucent color and was cold to the bite."
Roxy G.,"Portland, OR",0,4,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Worst experience I've ever had at Cheesecake Factory. Hoping it's because it's a brand new location at Clackamas Town Center and they're still working out the kinks. We walked in and was told it would be a 20 minute wait (even though there were several empty tables) or we could sit in the bar. We proceeded to a table in the bar and sat down. A waitress immediately told us we couldn't sit there. I explained that the gal at the front told us we could. Not even 15 seconds later, another waitress came back with the first one in tow, to tell us we couldn't sit there. I again explained that we were told we could sit in the bar. Long story short, we just got up and left, instead of arguing with the 2 ladies! So sad, because I was hoping to have my birthday dinner there later this month. I don't know what the big deal was, especially since there were several available tables in the restaurant and in the bar!!"
Julia C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/12/2017,"Awesome service! Awesome food! Awesome atmosphere! I'm so glad they finally came to this side of town.  I had a great ""skinny"" salad and then indulged on the fresh banana cream cheese cake....yummmm! Love this place! Go...you won't regret it!"
